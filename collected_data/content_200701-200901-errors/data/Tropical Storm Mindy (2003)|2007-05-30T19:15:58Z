'''Tropical Storm Mindy''' was a weak tropical storm during October of the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Forming from a [[tropical wave]] near the [[Mona Passage]], Mindy encountered moderate amounts of [[wind shear]] throughout its life. The storm reached a peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h) as the system developed into a [[tropical cyclone]], and steadily weakened as it moved northwestward. After passing near the [[Bahamas]], Mindy weakened to a tropical depression, turned sharply eastward, and dissipated on [[October 14]]. The precursor tropical wave dropped moderate amounts of rainfall across [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], causing light damage.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Mindy 2003 track.png}}
A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[October 1]] and moved westward.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Miles B. Lawrence|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Mindy Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-10-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003mindy.shtml?}}</ref> By [[October 6]], the wave was located 900 miles (1450 km) east of the [[Lesser Antilles]], and upper level [[wind shear]] were forecasted to become more favorable for gradual development.<ref name="oct6two">{{cite web|author=Franklin|year=2003|title=October 6 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-09|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2003/Oct/2003100621.ABNT20}}</ref> On [[October 8]], convection and gusty winds began to spread across the Lesser Antilles, and the wave slowly became better organized as wind shear decreased.<ref name="oct8two">{{cite web|author=Beven|year=2003|title=October 8 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-09|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2003/Oct/2003100821.ABNT20}}</ref>  Convection became more concentrated on [[October 9]],<ref name="oct9two">{{cite web|author=Pasch|year=2003|title=October 9 Tropical Weather Outlook|accessdate=2006-10-09|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2003/Oct/2003100909.ABNT20}}</ref> and in response to a weakness in the [[subtropical ridge]] the wave turned to the west-northwest as it continued to organize. Despite strong southwesterly wind shear, a closed surface circulation developed over eastern [[Hispaniola]], and late on [[October 10]] the system developed into Tropical Storm Mindy just off the northern coast of [[Dominican Republic]]. Upon forming, the storm reached its peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h).<ref name="tcr"/>

Deep convection near the poorly-defined center decayed as Mindy moved to the northwest. Initial forecasts predicted upper level winds to decrease, allowing for the storm to intensify to a prediced peak strength of 65 mph (105 km/h).<ref name="mindydisc2">{{cite web|author=Beven|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Mindy Discussion Two|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al182003.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> However, the convection diminished towards the east of the storm as the center passed near the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] on [[October 11]]. Continued vertical shear weakened Mindy to a minimal tropical storm late on the 11th, and on [[October 12]] the system degenerated to a tropical depression as it turned to the north. An approaching short-wave [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] turned Mindy sharply eastward late on the 12th. Devoid of deep convection, the circulation continued eastward until dissipating on [[October 14]] about 445 miles (715 km) south-southwest of [[Bermuda]].<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
The [[National Hurricane Center]] recommended interests in the [[Lesser Antilles]] and [[Puerto Rico]] to monitor the progress of the developing tropical wave.<ref name="oct92003two">{{cite web|author=Beven|year=2003|title=October 9, 2003 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-09|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2003/Oct/2003100921.ABNT20}}</ref> Coinciding with the first advisory issued on the storm, the government of the [[Bahamas]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|Tropical Storm Warning]] for the Southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands.<ref name="tcr"/> Initially, Mindy was forecasted to threat [[Bermuda]] later in its lifetime, though the threat subsided when the storm dissipated to the east of the Bahamas.<ref name="bah">{{cite web|author=Bermuda Weather Service|year=2003|title=Bermuda Weather for October 2003|accessdate=2006-10-10|url=http://www.weather.bm/data/2003-10.html}}</ref>

Tropical Storm Mindy dropped moderate amounts of rainfall in the [[Dominican Republic]], including a maximum of 2.63 inches (60 mm) in [[Santiago Rodríguez Province|Santiago Rodríguez]]. The rainfall caused flooding and overflown rivers, and damaged 320 houses in Santiago Rodríguez with two feet of mud.
