'''Susannah Constantine''' (born [[8 January]] [[1961]] in [[London]]) is an [[England|English]] [[television presenter]] and fashion journalist. She was best-known as the co-host, along with [[Trinny Woodall]], on the [[BBC]] style series ''[[What Not to Wear]]''. Following her success on the show, she went on to co-host ''[[Trinny & Susannah Undress]]''.

==Background==
Constantine was a fixture in [[1980s]] British gossip columns as the result of her relationship with [[Princess Margaret of the United Kingdom|Princess Margaret]]'s son, [[David, Viscount Linley]]. She is now married to businessman Sten Bertelsen, and has three children: Joe, Esme and Cece.

She was educated at [[St Mary's School, Wantage|St Mary's School]] in [[Wantage]], [[Oxfordshire]], and Queens Gate School in [[South Kensington]], [[London]]. Constantine is best known as a fashion guru, where her fashion career started when she worked for many years for fashion designer [[John Galliano]]. <ref>[http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=6606 Susannah Constantine on itv.com], itv.com</ref> She teamed up in [[1994]] with [[Trinny Woodall]], to write ''Ready to Wear'', a weekly style guide for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' which ran successfully for seven years. Constantine and Woodall were also co-founders of [[Ready2shop.com]], a [[dot-com]] fashion advice business that ceased trading after running out of funding in November [[2000]].

==Television career==
Constantine was well-known for co-hosting ''[[What Not to Wear]]'' with Trinny Woodall, which required using her fashion expertise and some brutally honest remarks in order to reform people's appearance and style. They hosted the show from [[2001]] to [[2005]] where together the pair were sometimes known for their tactile behaviour. 

During her time co-hosting ''What Not to Wear'' for five series, she and Woodall gained recognition for their work on the show, where they won a [[Royal Television Society#Awards|Royal Television Society Award]] in 2002, for being the best factual presenters. <ref>[http://www.rts.org.uk/awards_det.asp?id=1457&sec_id=336 Susannah Constantine award], Royal Television Society website</ref> In 2003, Constantine and Woodall did a spin-off show; ''What Not to Wear on the Red Carpet'' in which they transformed the appearances of [[Jo Brand]] and [[Sophie Raworth]]. ''What Not to Wear'' also gained her fame in America, when the show was aired on [[BBC America]].

Constantine voiced a robot version of herself in the popular [[science fiction]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. In the episode ''[[Bad Wolf]]'' in [[2005]], Trine-e and Zu-Zana were two robots acting out a deadly futuristic version of ''What not to Wear''. In the same year, Constantine appeared on the live BBC coverage of [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles|The Royal Wedding of Charles and Camilla]], where she contributed as a fashion and contemporary social commentator along with Woodall. <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/03_march/30/wedding.shtml Susannah Constantine commentates on Royal Wedding], BBC Press Office</ref> 

Constantine and Woodall have defected from the BBC to [[ITV]], where they started their new show, ''[[Trinny & Susannah Undress]]'' on [[3 October]], 2006. Since then, ''What Not to Wear'' on [[BBC One]] has been hosted by [[Lisa Butcher]] and [[Mica Paris]]. Constantine has also appeared regularly as a makeover expert on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' (with Woodall), where she gave fashion advice and guidelines on how to better your overall appearance. The show saw them giving numerous American citizens makeovers and a thoroughly improved appearance. <ref>[http://www.oprah.com/tows/pastshows/200405/tows_past_20040518.jhtml Susannah Constantine on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''], Oprah.com</ref> She has also appeared a couple of times on ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'', ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', [[Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car]]; a recurring segment on the [[BBC Two]] motoring programme ''[[Top Gear]]'', amongst numerous other talk shows.
