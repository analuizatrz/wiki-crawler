'''''Doctor Who''''' is a British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] programme produced by the [[BBC]]. The programme depicts the adventures of a mysterious alien [[time travel|time-traveller]] known as "[[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]" who travels in his space and time-ship, the [[TARDIS]], which appears from the exterior to be a blue 1950s [[police box]]. With his [[companion (Doctor Who)|companions]], he explores time and space, solving problems, facing [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens|monsters]] and righting wrongs.

The programme is listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world<ref>{{cite news

In the United Kingdom and elsewhere, the show has become a [[Cult following|cult television]] favourite and has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. It has received [[#Awards|recognition]] from critics and the public as one of the finest British television programmes, including the [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA Award]] for [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series|Best Drama Series]] in 2006.

==History==
{{main|History of Doctor Who}}
''Doctor Who'' first appeared on BBC television at 5:15 pm ([[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]) on 23 November 1963,<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), p. 54 </ref> following discussions and plans that had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|Head of Drama]], [[Sydney Newman]], was mainly responsible for developing it, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the Head of the Script Department (later Head of Serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial [[Television producer|producer]] [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157&ndash;230 ("Production Diary")<br>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947–1979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', due to the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.<br>Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode "[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.</ref> The series' title theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]].<ref>Richards, p. 23</ref>  The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3</ref>
The BBC drama department's Serials division produced the programme for 26 series, broadcast on [[BBC One]]. Viewing numbers that had fallen (though comparably increased at some points), a decline in the public perception of the show and a less prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by [[Jonathan Powell (producer)|Jonathan Powell]], Controller of BBC One.<ref name="powell">{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> Although it was effectively [[cancellation (television)|cancelled]] (as series co-star [[Sophie Aldred]] reported in the documentary ''Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS''), the BBC said the series would return.

While in-house production had ceased, the BBC was hopeful of finding an independent production company to relaunch the show.  [[Philip Segal]], a British [[expatriate]] who worked for [[Columbia Pictures]]' television arm in the United States, approached the BBC about such a venture. Segal's negotiations eventually led to a [[television movie]]. [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|The ''Doctor Who'' television movie]] was broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] in 1996 as a co-production between Fox, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], the BBC, and [[BBC Worldwide]]. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1 million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series.

[[Doctor Who spin-offs|Licensed]] media such as novels and audio plays provided new stories, but as a television programme ''Doctor Who'' remained dormant until 2003. In September of that year, [[BBC Television]] announced the in-house production of a new series after several years of unsuccessful attempts by BBC Worldwide to find backing for a feature film version. The executive producers of the new incarnation of the series are writer [[Russell T Davies]] and [[BBC Wales]] Head of Drama/BBC Television Controller of Drama Commissioning [[Julie Gardner]]. It has been sold to many other countries worldwide (see [[#Viewership|Viewership]]).

''Doctor Who'' finally returned with the episode [[Rose (Doctor Who)|"Rose"]] on BBC One on 26 March 2005. There have been three further series in 2006, 2007, and 2008 and Christmas Day specials in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. The fourth series began on BBC One on 5 April 2008. There will be a rest year in 2009, with no new series, although David Tennant will star in 4 specials in that year. After the 2008 Christmas special and four special episodes in 2009, a fifth full-length series is planned for Spring 2010,<ref name="BBC2009/10">{{cite news

The 2005–present version of ''Doctor Who'' is considered a direct continuation of the 1963–89 series, as is the 1996 telefilm. This differs from other series relaunches that have either been reimaginings or reboots (e.g., ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and ''[[Bionic Woman (2007 TV series)|Bionic Woman]]'') or series taking place in the same universe as the original but with a totally new cast of characters (e.g., ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and spin-offs).<ref>[http://www.gallifreyone.com/newseriesfaq.php Outpost Gallifrey: TV Series FAQ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

With popularity came controversy over the show's suitability for children. Moral campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] repeatedly complained to the BBC in the 1970s over what she saw as the show's frightening or gory content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925766/bio|title=Biography of Mary Whitehouse|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> The programme became even more popular — especially with children. [[John Nathan-Turner]], who produced the series during the 1980s, was heard to say that he looked forward to Whitehouse's comments, as the show's ratings would increase soon after she had made them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/new_media/1965981.stm|title=Doctor Who Producer Dies|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> During the 1970s, the ''[[Radio Times]]'', the BBC's [[listings magazine]], announced that a child's mother said the theme music terrified her son. The ''Radio Times'' was apologetic, but the theme music remained.

There were more complaints about the programme's content than its music. During [[Jon Pertwee]]'s [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 8 (1971)|second season]] as the Doctor, in the serial ''[[Terror of the Autons]]'' (1971), images of murderous plastic dolls, daffodils killing unsuspecting victims and blank-featured android policemen marked the apex of the show's ability to frighten children. Other notable moments in that decade included the Doctor's apparently being drowned by Chancellor Goth in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976) and the allegedly negative portrayal of Chinese people in ''[[The Talons of Weng-Chiang]]'' (1977).

It has been said that watching ''Doctor Who'' from a position of safety "[[behind the sofa]]" (as the ''Doctor Who'' exhibition at the [[Museum of the Moving Image]] in London was titled) and peering cautiously out to see if the frightening part was over is one of the great shared experiences of British childhood. The phrase has become commonly used in association with the programme and occasionally elsewhere.

[[Image:TARDIS2.jpg|thumb|The Mark II fibreglass [[TARDIS]] used between 1980 and 1989.]]
A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that by their own definition of "any act(s) which may cause physical and / or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental", ''Doctor Who'' was the most violent of all the drama programmes the corporation then produced.<ref name="times-violence">{{cite news|title=Violence is not really Dr Who's cup of tea|publisher=[[The Times]]|first=Philip|last=Howard|date=1972-01-29|accessdate=2007-01-17|pages=2}}</ref> The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as "very unsuitable" for family viewing.<ref name="times-audience">{{cite news|title=The Times Diary - Points of view|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=1972-01-27|accessdate=2007-01-17|pages=16}}</ref> However, responding to the findings of the survey in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that: "to compare the violence of ''Dr Who'', sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously."<ref name="times-violence"/>

The image of the [[TARDIS]] has become firmly linked to the show in the public's consciousness. In 1996, the BBC applied for a [[trademark]] to use the TARDIS' blue [[police box]] design in merchandising associated with ''Doctor Who''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patent.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=C&trademark=2104259 |title=Case details for Trade Mark 2104259 |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[UK Intellectual Property Office|UK Patent Office]] }}</ref> In 1998, the Metropolitan Police filed an objection to the trademark claim; in 2002 the [[UK Intellectual Property Office|Patent Office]] ruled in favour of the BBC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patent.gov.uk/tm/t-decisionmaking/t-challenge/t-challenge-decision-results/t-challenge-decision-results-bl?BL_Number=O/336/02 |title=Trade mark decision |accessdate=2007-01-17 |work=[[UK Intellectual Property Office|UK Patent Office]] website }}<br>{{cite web |url=http://www.patent.gov.uk/tm//legal/decisions/2002/o33602.pdf |title=IN THE MATTER OF Application No. 2104259 by The British Broadcasting Corporation to register a series of three marks in Classes 9, 16, 25 and 41 AND IN THE MATTER OF Opposition thereto under No. 48452 by The Metropolitan Police Authority |accessdate=2007-01-17 |last=Knight |first=Mike |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=[[UK Intellectual Property Office|UK Patent Office]]|format=PDF}}<br>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2352743.stm |title=BBC wins police Tardis case |accessdate=2007-01-17 |date=2002-10-23 |work=[[BBC News]] }}</ref>

''Doctor Who'' originally ran for [[List of Doctor Who serials|26 series (seasons)]] on [[BBC One]], from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989. During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or "[[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]") — usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Notable exceptions were the epic ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'', which aired in twelve episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, "[[Mission to the Unknown]]", featuring none of the regular cast) <ref>''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]].''

The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule. Initially, it alternated stories set in the past, which would teach younger audience members about history, with stories set either in the future or in outer space to teach them about science. This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.

However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme and the "historicals", which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after ''[[The Highlanders (Doctor Who)|The Highlanders]]'' (1967). While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: ''[[Black Orchid (Doctor Who)|Black Orchid]]'' set in 1920s UK.<ref name=Orchid>''[[Black Orchid (Doctor Who)|Black Orchid]].'' Writer [[Terence Dudley]], Director [[Ron Jones (television director)|Ron Jones]], Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]]. ''Doctor Who''. [[BBC]]. [[BBC One]], London. 1 March 1982–2 March 1982.</ref>

The early stories were serial-like in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes. Following ''[[The Gunfighters]]'' (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, with the individual parts simply being assigned episode numbers. What to name these earlier stories is often [[Doctor Who story title debate|a subject of fan debate]].

Writers during the original run included [[Terry Nation]], [[Henry Lincoln]], [[Douglas Adams]], [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]], [[Terrance Dicks]], [[Dennis Spooner]], [[Eric Saward]], [[Malcolm Hulke]], [[Christopher H. Bidmead]], [[Stephen Gallagher]], [[Brian Hayles]], [[Robert Sloman]], [[Chris Boucher]], [[Peter Grimwade]], [[Marc Platt]] and [[Ben Aaronovitch]].

The serial format changed for the [[List of Doctor Who serials#Ninth Doctor|2005 revival]], with each series consisting of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes, with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended episode broadcast on Christmas Day. Each series includes several standalone and multi-part stories, linked with a loose story arc that resolves in the series finale. As in the early "classic" era, each episode — whether standalone or part of a larger story — has its own title.

751 ''Doctor Who'' instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging from 25-minute episodes (the most common format), to 45-minute episodes (for ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'' in the 1984 series, a single season in 1985, and the revival), to two feature-length productions (1983's "[[The Five Doctors]]" and the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television movie]]), to the two 60-minute [[Christmas special#Television series specials|Christmas specials]] produced for the revival and the more recent 72 minute 2007 Christmas Special.

The current series is recorded in 576i25 [[Betacam#Digital Betacam|DigiBeta]] wide-screen format and then [[filmizing|filmised]] to give a 25p image in post-production using a [[Snell & Wilcox]] Alchemist Platinum.

Some episodes have been returned to the BBC from the archives of other countries who bought copies for broadcast, or by private individuals who got them by various means. Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved, as well as excerpts filmed from the television screen onto 8 mm [[cine film]] and clips that were shown on other programmes. Audio versions of all of the lost episodes exist from home viewers who made tape recordings of the show.

In addition to these, there are off-screen photographs made by photographer [[John Cura]], who was hired by various production personnel to document many of their programmes during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''Doctor Who''. These have been used in [[Doctor Who missing episodes#Reconstruction|fan reconstructions]] of the serials. These amateur reconstructions have been tolerated by the BBC, provided they are not sold for profit and are distributed as low quality VHS copies.

[[Image:Anim doczoe.jpg|thumb|The animated reconstruction of ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'']]
One of the most sought-after lost episodes is Part Four of the last William Hartnell serial, ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' (1966), which ends with the [[First Doctor]] transforming into the [[Second Doctor|Second]]. The only portion of this in existence, barring a few poor quality silent 8 mm clips, is the few seconds of the regeneration scene, as it was shown on the children's magazine show ''[[Blue Peter]]''. With the approval of the BBC, efforts are now under way to restore as many of the episodes as possible from the extant material.
Starting in the early 1990s, the BBC began to release audio recordings of missing serials on cassette and compact disc, with linking narration provided by former series actors. "Official" reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on [[MP3]] [[CD-ROM]] and as a special feature on a DVD. The BBC, in conjunction with animation studio [[Cosgrove Hall Films|Cosgrove Hall]] has reconstructed the missing Episodes 1 and 4 of ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'' (1968) in animated form, using remastered audio tracks and the comprehensive stage notes for the original filming, for the serial's DVD release in November 2006. Although no similar reconstructions have been announced as of early 2007, Cosgrove Hall has expressed an interest in animating more lost episodes in the future.<ref>''Flash Frames'', a featurette included on the DVD release of [[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]], [[BBC Video]], 2006.</ref>

==Characters==
===The Doctor===
{{main|Doctor (Doctor Who)}}
[[Image:10dr19.jpg|thumb|right|250px|<center>The ten faces of the Doctor.</center><br>'''(Top)''' L-R: [[William Hartnell]], [[Patrick Troughton]], [[Jon Pertwee]]<br>'''(Middle)''' L-R: [[Tom Baker]], [[Peter Davison]], [[Colin Baker]], [[Sylvester McCoy]]<br>'''(Bottom)''' L-R: [[Paul McGann]], [[Christopher Eccleston]], [[David Tennant]]]]<!-- FAIR USE of 10dr19.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10dr19.jpg for rationale -->

The character of the Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery. All that was known about him in the programme's early days was that he was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable old time machine called the [[TARDIS]], an acronym for '''T'''ime '''A'''nd '''R'''elative '''D'''imension(s) '''I'''n '''S'''pace. As it appears much larger on the inside than on the outside, the TARDIS has been described by the [[Third Doctor]] as "dimensionally transcendental"<ref>. Now an entry in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] the word "TARDIS" is often used to describe anything that appears larger on the inside than its exterior implies. {{cite web|url = http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/424|title = Full record for Tardis-like adj.|work = Science Fiction Citations|accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref> and, due to a malfunction of its [[Chameleon Circuit]], is stuck in the shape of a 1950s-style British [[police box]].

However, not only did the initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellow into a more compassionate figure, it was eventually revealed that he had been on the run from his own people, the [[Time Lord]]s of the planet [[Gallifrey]].

As a Time Lord, the Doctor has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] his body when near death. Introduced into the storyline as a way of continuing the series when the writers were faced with the departure of lead actor [[William Hartnell]] in 1966, it has continued to be a major element of the series, allowing for the recasting of the lead actor when the need arises. The serial ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' established that a Time Lord can regenerate twelve times, for a total of thirteen incarnations (although at least one Time Lord, [[Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]], has managed to circumvent this). To date, the Doctor has gone through this process and its resulting after-effects on nine occasions, with each of his incarnations having his own quirks and abilities but otherwise sharing the memories and experience of the previous incarnations:

Other actors have also played the Doctor, though rarely more than once (see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]).

Despite these shifts in personality, the Doctor remains an intensely curious and highly moral adventurer who would rather solve problems with his wits than by using violence.

Throughout the programme's long history there have been controversial revelations about the Doctor. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the [[First Doctor]] may not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted may have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). During the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s era it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television movie]], he described himself as being "half human".<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The revelation has become controversial amongst series fans, given that there have been no references to the concept during the original or revived television series.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml BBC - Doctor Who - FAQ - Plot and Continuity]</ref> The 2005 series revealed that the [[Ninth Doctor]] thought he had become the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed. The very first episode, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', revealed that the [[First Doctor|Doctor]] had a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]]; in [[The Empty Child]] (2005), in response to Constantine's statement that "before this war began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither", the Doctor remarked "yeah, I know the feeling"; and in both "[[Fear Her]]" (2006) and "[[The Doctor's Daughter]]" (2008), he remarked that he had, in the past, been a father. Also in the latter, his cells are used to produce a daughter (played by [[Georgia Moffett]], the real-life daughter of [[Fifth Doctor]] actor [[Peter Davison]]) who is subsequently named [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]] by Donna as a result of his describing her as "a generated anomaly".

===Companions===
{{main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}
The Doctor almost always shares his adventures with up to three [[companion (Doctor Who)|companions]], and since 1963 more than 35 actors and actresses have featured in these roles. The First Doctor's original companions were his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]) and school teachers [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]) and [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (actor)|William Russell]]). The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]''.

Dramatically, the [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] characters provide a [[audience surrogate|surrogate]] with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes — or loves — on worlds they have visited. Some have even died during the course of the series.

Although the majority of the Doctor's companions have been young, attractive females, the production team for the 1963–1989 series maintained a long-standing taboo against any overt romantic involvement in the TARDIS. The taboo was controversially broken in the 1996 television film when the [[Eighth Doctor]] was shown kissing companion [[Grace Holloway]]. The 2005 series played with this idea by having various characters think that the [[Ninth Doctor]] and [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] (played by [[Billie Piper]]) were a couple, which they vehemently denied (see also [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Romance|"The Doctor and romance"]]). The idea of a possible involvement was suggested again in "[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]", when the [[Tenth Doctor]] kisses his soon-to-be new companion [[Martha Jones]], although the Doctor insists that the kiss was simply for the purpose of 'genetic transfer'. In "[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]", the Doctor is kissed by [[Donna Noble]] to shock him in order to neutralise a poison in his system, but again, a romantic purpose is unstated.

Previous companions reappeared in the series, usually for anniversary specials. One former companion, [[Sarah Jane Smith]] (played by [[Elisabeth Sladen]]), together with the robotic dog [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]], appeared in [[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|an episode]] of the 2006 series more than twenty years after their last appearances in the 20th Anniversary story "[[The Five Doctors]]" (1983). Afterwards, the character was featured in the spinoff series ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''. Sladen once again appeared as Sarah Jane in the final two episodes of the fourth season of the new ''Doctor Who'', with K-9 appearing briefly in the final episode, "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]".

The latest companions of the Doctor included a large ensemble cast ranging from Catherine Tate reprising her role as Donna, Billie Piper as Rose, [[Noel Clarke]] as [[Mickey Smith]], [[Freema Agyeman]] as Martha, Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane and [[John Barrowman]] as [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack]], all of whom departed in the episode "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]".<ref name="qprhig"/> Agyeman appeared as Martha Jones in three episodes of the spin-off series ''Torchwood'' before returning to ''Doctor Who'' halfway through the fourth series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2007/07/02/46692.shtml |title=More Martha! |accessdate=2007-07-02 |work=[[bbc.co.uk]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6260374.stm|title=Doctor Who to get extra companion|accessdate=2007-07-02 |work=[[bbc.co.uk]]}}</ref> [[Billie Piper]] briefly reprised her role as [[Rose Tyler]] in the fourth series episode "[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]" and returned to the series from "[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]" to "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7114699.stm |title=Billie Piper to return to Dr Who | accessdate=2007-11-27 |work=[[bbc.co.uk]] }} </ref> For the 2007 Christmas episode "[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]", the Doctor's companion was [[Astrid Peth]], played by Australian performer [[Kylie Minogue]].

Though not always considered a companion, [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] was a recurring character in the original series, making his first appearance alongside the Second Doctor and his final alongside the Seventh. The actor [[Nicholas Courtney]] who portrayed the Brigadier had previously also starred as Bret Vyon alongside first Doctor William Hartnell in the 12-part ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'', and he appeared on television with every Doctor of the classic series except Colin Baker, and appears with the Sixth Doctor in the charity crossover special ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'' and in audio adventures from [[Big Finish Productions]]. Lethbridge-Stewart's photo appears among Sarah Jane Smith's personal items in ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''. He and [[UNIT]] appeared regularly during the Third Doctor's tenure, and UNIT has continued to appear or be referred to in the revival of the show and its spin-offs.

==Adversaries==
{{see also|List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens|List of Doctor Who villains}}
[[Image:Dalek - Dr Who.jpg|thumb|The [[Dalek]]s are perhaps the best-known adversaries faced by the Doctor.]]
When Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the cliché of the "bug-eyed monster" of science fiction. However, [[list of Doctor Who monsters and aliens|monsters]] were a staple of ''Doctor Who'' almost from the beginning and were popular with audiences. Notable adversaries of the Doctor from the series' initial 26-year run include the [[Auton]]s, the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]], the [[Sontaran]]s, the [[Zygon]]s, the [[Sea Devil (Doctor Who)|Sea Devils]], the [[Silurian (Doctor Who)|Silurians]], the [[Ice Warrior]]s, the [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]], the [[Yeti (Doctor Who)|Yeti]], [[Davros]] (the creator of the Daleks), [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] (a Time Lord with a thirst for universal conquest), and, most notably, the [[Dalek]]s. This continued with the resurrection of the series in 2005.

Current executive producer, Russell T Davies, stated that it had always been his intention to bring back classic [[Cultural icon|icons]] of ''Doctor Who'' one step at a time: Daleks in series 1, Cybermen in series 2 and the Master in series 3. He also stated that he was not finished and would continue reviving villains from the series' past.<ref name="Confidential">{{cite web

 | publisher = [[BBC News]]}}</ref> Series 4 saw the return of the [[Sontaran]]s and the Daleks' creator, [[Davros]].  Since its 2005 return, the series has also introduced new aliens, including the [[Slitheen]], the [[Ood]], the [[Judoon]] and the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Hath|Hath]].

===Daleks===
{{main|Dalek}}
Of all the monsters and villains, the ones that have most secured the series' place in the public's imagination are the [[Dalek]]s, who first appeared in 1963 and were the series' very first "monster". The Daleks are [[Kaled]] mutants in tank-like mechanical armour shells from the planet [[Skaro]]. Their chief role in the great scheme of things, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to "Exterminate!" all beings inferior to themselves, even destroying the [[Time Lord]]s in the often referenced but never shown [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. [[Davros]], the Daleks' creator, became a recurring villain after he was introduced in ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'', in which the Time Lords send the Doctor back to either destroy the Daleks, avert their creation, or tamper with their genetic structure to make them less warlike. Davros has been played by [[Michael Wisher]] (first introduced in ''Genesis of the Daleks''), [[David Gooderson]] (''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]''), and [[Terry Molloy]]. Davros returned to ''Doctor Who''  portrayed by [[Julian Bleach]] in the 2008 episodes "[[The Stolen Earth]]" and "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]".

The Daleks were created by writer [[Terry Nation]] (who intended them as an [[allegory]] of the [[Nazism|Nazis]])<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nationterry/nationterry.htm | title = NATION, TERRY | accessdate = 2008-05-19}}</ref> and BBC designer [[Raymond Cusick]]. The Daleks' début in the programme's second serial, ''[[The Daleks]]'' (1963–64), caused a tremendous reaction in the viewing figures and the public, putting ''Doctor Who'' on the cultural map. A Dalek appeared on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Lord Snowdon]].

===Cybermen===
{{main|Cybermen}}
Cybermen were originally a wholly organic species of humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet Mondas that began to implant more and more artificial parts into their bodies. This led to the race becoming coldly logical and calculating, with emotions usually only shown when naked aggression was called for. The 2006 series introduced a totally new variation of Cybermen created in a parallel universe by transplanting the brains of humans into powerful metal bodies, sending them orders using a [[Cellular network|mobile phone network]], and inhibiting their emotions with an electronic chip.

===The Master===
{{main|Master (Doctor Who)}}
[[Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]] is a renegade [[Time Lord]], and the Doctor's nemesis. Conceived as "[[Professor Moriarty]] to the Doctor's [[Sherlock Holmes]],"<ref>''Doctor Who Magazine Special Edition'' #2, 5 September 2002, [subtitled ''The Complete Third Doctor''], page 14)</ref> the character first appeared in 1971. As with the Doctor, the role has been portrayed by several actors, the first being [[Roger Delgado]] who continued in the role until his death in 1973.  The Master was briefly played by [[Peter Pratt]] and [[Geoffrey Beevers]] until [[Anthony Ainley]] took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's "hiatus" in 1989. The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of ''[[Doctor Who (1996 film)|Doctor Who]]'', played by Gordon Tipple in the ultimately unused pre-credits voiceover, then [[Eric Roberts]], and in the three-part finale of the 2007 series, portrayed by [[Derek Jacobi]], who then regenerated into [[John Simm]] at the conclusion of the episode "[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]".

==Music==
===Theme music===
{{main|Doctor Who theme music}}
{{sample box start variation 2|Audio sample composed by Ron Grainer:}}
{{Listen|filename=Doctor Who theme excerpt.ogg|title=Doctor Who theme excerpt|description=An excerpt from the theme music to ''Doctor Who''}}
{{sample box end}}
The original 1963 [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop|radiophonic]] arrangement of the ''Doctor Who'' theme is widely regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, and ''Doctor Who'' was the first television series in the world to have a theme entirely realised through electronic means.

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]]. The various parts were built up by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[Oscillation|oscillator]]s and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 17 (1979-80)|Season 17]] (1979–80).

A more modern and dynamic arrangement was composed by [[Peter Howell]] for [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 18 (1980-81)|Season 18]] (1980), which was in turn replaced by [[Dominic Glynn]]'s arrangement for Season 23's ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' (1986). [[Keff McCulloch]] provided the new arrangement for the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s era which lasted from [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 24 (1987)|Season 24]] (1987) until the series' suspension in 1989. For the return of the series in 2005, [[Murray Gold]] provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode "[[The Christmas Invasion]]", Gold introduced a modified closing credits arrangement that was used up until the conclusion of the 2007 series.

A new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, "[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]".

Versions of the "Doctor Who Theme" have also been released in a [[pop music]] venue over the years. In the early 1970s, [[Jon Pertwee]], who had played the [[Third Doctor]], recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, "Who Is the Doctor". In 1988 the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (later known as [[The KLF]]) released the single "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" under the name The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including "Rock and Roll Part 2" by [[Gary Glitter]] (who recorded vocals for some of the CD-single remix versions of "Doctorin' the Tardis").<ref name="guardianmusic">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/07/doctor_who_a_musical_force.html |title=Doctor Who: a musical force? |accessdate=2008-07-07 |last=Peel |first=Ian |date=2008-07-07 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=blog}}</ref> Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]],<ref name="guardianmusic" /> [[Pink Floyd]],<ref name="guardianmusic" /> the Australian string ensemble [[FourPlay Electric String Quartet|Fourplay]], New Zealand punk band [[Blam Blam Blam]], [[The Pogues]], and the comedians [[Bill Bailey]] and [[Mitch Benn]], and it and obsessive fans were satirised on ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]''. A reggae/ska version of the Doctor Who theme tune was released on the Explosion label in 1969 by Bongo Herman and Les. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs and has made its way into [[mobile phone]] ring tones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme.

===Incidental music===
Most of the innovative incidental music for ''Doctor Who'' has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, although in the early years some episodes also used [[Royalty free music|stock music]], as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or [[cover version]]s of songs by popular music acts such as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]].

The incidental music for the first ''Doctor Who'' adventure, ''An Unearthly Child'', was written by [[Norman Kay (composer)|Norman Kay]]. Many of the stories of the [[William Hartnell]] period were scored by electronic music pioneer [[Tristram Cary]], whose ''Doctor Who'' credits include ''The Daleks'', ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'', ''The Daleks' Master Plan'', ''The Gunfighters'' and ''[[The Mutants]]''. Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].

The most frequent musical contributor during the first fifteen years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee / Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).

Beginning with ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' (1980), the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. [[Paddy Kingsland]] and [[Peter Howell]] contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included [[Roger Limb]], [[Malcolm Clarke]] and [[Jonathan Gibbs (composer)|Jonathan Gibbs]].

The Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after the ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' season, and [[Keff McCulloch]] took over as the series' main composer, with [[Dominic Glynn]] and [[Mark Ayres]] also contributing scores.

All the incidental music for the 2005 revived series has been composed by Murray Gold and Ben Foster and has been performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales from the 2005 Christmas episode ''The Christmas Invasion'' onwards. A concert featuring the orchestra performing music from the first two series took place on 19 November 2006 to raise money for [[Children in Need]]. [[David Tennant]] hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert. [[Murray Gold]] and [[Russell T Davies]] answered questions during the interval and [[Dalek]]s and [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] menaced the audience whilst music from their stories was played. The concert aired on [[BBC Red Button|BBCi]] on Christmas Day 2006.  A [[Doctor Who Prom]] was celebrated on 27 July 2008 in the [[Royal Albert Hall]] as part of the annual [[BBC Proms]]. The BBC Philharmonic and the London Philharmonic Choir performed Murray Gold's compositions for the series, conducted by Ben Foster, as well as a selection of classics based around the theme of space and time. The event was presented by [[Freema Agyeman]] and guest-presented by various other stars of the show with numerous monsters participating in the proceedings. It also featured  the specially filmed mini-episode [[Music of the Spheres (Doctor Who)|Music of the Spheres]], written by Russell T Davies and starring David Tennant.<ref>{{cite web

Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, including works by [[Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick|Ian Dury and the Blockheads]], [[Mr Blue Sky|Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Tainted love#Soft Cell version|Soft Cell]], [[Voodoo Child (song)|Rogue Traders]], [[Toxic (song)|Britney Spears]] and the [[Ta-Dah|Scissor Sisters]].

===Special sound===
''Doctor Who'''s science-fiction themes and settings meant that many sound effects had to be specially created for the series, although some common sound effects (such as crowds, horses and jungle noises) were sourced from stock recordings. Because ''Doctor Who'' began several years before the advent of the first mass-produced [[synthesizer]]s, much of the equipment used to create electronic sound effects in the early days was custom-built by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and until the early 1970s audio effects were produced using a combination of electronic and [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop|radiophonic]] techniques.

Almost all of the original sound effects and audio backgrounds during the 1960s were overseen by the Radiophonic Workshop's [[Brian Hodgson]], who worked on ''Doctor Who'' from its inception until the middle of Jon Pertwee's tenure in the early 1970s, when he was succeeded by [[Dick Mills]]. Hodgson created hundreds of pieces of "special sound" ranging from ray-gun blasts to dinosaurs, but without doubt his best known sound effects are the sound of the TARDIS as it de-materialises and re-appears, and the voices of the [[Dalek]]s.

The basic audio source Hodgson used for the TARDIS effect was the sound of his house keys being scraped up and down along the strings of an old gutted piano, and played backwards. The famous Dalek voice effect was obtained by passing the actors' voices through a device called a [[Ring modulation|ring modulator]], and it was further enhanced by exploiting the [[distortion]] inherent in the microphones and amplifiers then in use. However, the precise sonic character of the Daleks' voices varied somewhat over time because the original frequency settings used on the ring modulator were never noted down.

''Doctor Who'' has always appeared on the BBC's mainstream [[BBC One]] channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers. The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings.<ref name="ratings chart">{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Hilton |title=Doctor Who - Top Chart Placing - 1963–2008 |url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/picview.php?ret=news&sub=news&id=season4_final_4.jpg |work=Doctor Who News Page |publisher=[[Outpost Gallifrey]] |date=2008-07-16 |accessdate=2008-07-16 }}; {{cite web |url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/picview.php?ret=news&sub=news&id=2007_ratings.jpg |title=Doctor Who Top Ratings: 1963–2007 |accessdate=2008-07-17 |last=Matt |first=Hilton |date=2008-01-11 |work=Doctor Who News Page |publisher=[[Outpost Gallifrey]]}}</ref>  The first of these was the "[[Dalekmania]]" period (circa 1964–1965), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought ''Doctor Who'' ratings of between 9 and 14 million, even for stories which did not feature them.<ref name="ratings chart" /><ref>{{cite news

 }}</ref> The second was the late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12 million.<ref name="ratings chart" /> During the [[ITV]] network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16 million. Figures remained respectable into the 1980s, but fell noticeably after the programme's 23rd season was postponed in 1985 and the show was off the air for 18 months. Its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time and was, according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme's 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the [[soap opera]] ''[[Coronation Street]]'', the most popular show at the time. After the series' revival in 2005 (the third noteworthy period of high ratings), it has consistently had high viewership levels for the evening on which the episode is broadcast, and often attracts the most viewers on that evening.<ref name="ratings chart" /> The BBC One broadcast of "[[Rose (Doctor Who)|Rose]]", the first episode of the 2005 revival, drew an average audience of 10.81 million, third highest for BBC One that week and seventh across all channels. The largest audience for an episode of ''Doctor Who'' since its revival was achieved by the 2007 Christmas special "[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage Of The Damned]]", which received 13.31 million viewers, a feat which also made it the second most watched show of the year.  The highest weekly chart ranking is first, for the 2008 series finale "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]", which was watched by 10.57 million viewers.<ref name="ratings chart" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=weeklyterrestrial&requesttimeout=500 |title=Weekly Viewing Summary: Terrestrial Top 30 - Week ending 6 July 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-16 |publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] |date=2008-07-16 }}<br>{{cite web |url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/cgi-bin/viewnews.cgi?id=EkEykpAEuAeSoAAghE&tmpl=newsrss&style=feedstyle |title=Journey's End: Officially Number One |accessdate=2008-07-16 |last=Hilton |first=Matt |date=2008-07-16 |work=Doctor Who News Page |publisher=[[Outpost Gallifrey]]}}</ref> The current revival also garners the highest audience [[Appreciation Index]] of any non-[[soap opera|soap]] drama on television.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2007/11/these_scifi_people_vote.php | title=“These sci-fi people vote” | author=Mark Wright | publisher=[[The Stage]] | date=2007-11-01 | accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref> Its continued viewership has resulted in becoming part of the UK's popular culture.

The series also has a fan base in the United States, where it was shown in syndication from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations (see [[Doctor Who in North America]]). New Zealand was the first country outside the UK to screen ''Doctor Who'' beginning in September 1964, and continued to screen the series for many years, including the new series from 2005. In Canada, the series debuted in January 1965, but the CBC only aired the first twenty-six episodes. [[TVOntario]] picked up the show in 1976 beginning with ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'' and aired it through to Season 24 in 1991. TVO's schedule ran several years behind the BBC's throughout this period. From 1979 to 1981, TVO airings were bookended by science-fiction writer [[Judith Merril]] who would introduce the episode and then, after the episode concluded, try to place it in an educational context in keeping with TVO's status as an educational channel. The airing of ''[[The Talons of Weng-Chiang]]'' resulted in controversy for TVOntario as a result of accusations that the story was [[racism|racist]]. Consequently the story was not rebroadcast. CBC began showing the series again in 2005.

A fan base exists in Australia, where it has been exclusively first run on [[ABC1]], and periodically repeated - including screening all available episodes for the show's 40th anniversary in 2003.  Repeats have also been shown on the subscription television channel [[UK.TV]].  The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation| ABC]] also broadcasts the first run of the revived series, on [[ABC1]], with repeats on [[ABC2]].  [[UK.TV]] also shows repeats of the revived series.  The ABC also provided partial funding for the 20th anniversary special episode "The Five Doctors".

Only four episodes have ever had their premier showings on channels other than BBC One. The 1983 twentieth anniversary special "[[The Five Doctors]]" had its début on 23 November (the actual date of the anniversary) on the Chicago [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] station [[WTTW]] in the United States and various other PBS members two days prior to its BBC One broadcast. The 1988 story ''[[Silver Nemesis]]'' was broadcast with all three episodes edited together in compilation form on [[Television New Zealand|TVNZ]] in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there. Finally, the 1996 television film premièred on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in [[Edmonton]], Canada, fifteen days before the BBC One showing, and two days before it aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the US.

A wide selection of serials is available from BBC Video on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]], on sale in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States. Every fully extant serial has been released on VHS, and BBC Worldwide continues to regularly release serials on DVD. The 2005 series is also available in its entirety on [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] for the [[PlayStation Portable]].

As of July 2008, the revived series has been, or is currently, broadcast weekly in 42 countries,<ref>{{cite news |first=Gavin |last=O'Connor |title=How the Daleks invaded Earth |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/07/13/how-the-daleks-invaded-earth-91466-21331115/ |work=[[Wales on Sunday]] |date=2008-07-13 |accessdate=2008-07-17 }}</ref> including [[Argentina]] ([[People+Arts]]), Australia ([[ABC1]]), Austria ([[ProSieben|Pro 7]]), Belgium ([[Één]]), [[Brazil]] (People+Arts), Canada in English on ([[CBC Television|CBC]]) and in French on ([[Ztélé]]), [[Catalonia]] ([[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]] and [[BBC Entertainment]]), [[Croatia]] ([[Croatian Radiotelevision]]), Denmark ([[Danmarks Radio]]), Finland ([[YLE TV2|TV2]]), France ([[France 4]]), Germany ([[ProSieben|Pro 7]],[[Sci Fi Channel (Germany)]]), Hong Kong ([[Asia Television Limited|ATV World]] and [[BBC Entertainment]]), Hungary ([[RTL Klub]]-owned COOL TV), [[Iceland]] ([[RÚV]]), Ireland ([[TV3 Ireland|TV3]]), [[Israel]] ([[yes stars Action|yes stars 2]]), Italy ([[Jimmy (TV channel)|Jimmy]]), Japan ([[NHK BS2|BS-2]], a channel of [[NHK]]), [[Malaysia]] ([[Astro (satellite TV)|Astro Network]]), the Netherlands ([[Nederland 3|NED 3]]), New Zealand ([[Prime Television New Zealand|Prime TV]]), Norway ([[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]]), Poland ([[TVP1]]), Portugal ([[People+Arts]], [[SIC Radical]]), [[Romania]] ([[Romanian Television|TVR]]), Russia ([[STS TV]]), Spain ([[People+Arts]] [first run], [[Sci Fi (Spain)|Sci Fi Channel]] [second run, new dubbing]), [[Latin America]] ([[People+Arts]]), South Korea ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS2]] (dubbed in Korean) and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (subtitled in Korean)), Sweden ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]]), Switzerland ([[ProSieben|Pro 7]]), [[Thailand]] ([[BBTV Channel 7|Channel 7]]), [[Turkey]] ([[Cine5]]), the United States ([[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] [first run], public television [second run] and [[BBC America]] [second run]), Greece ([[Skai TV]]), [[Style UK]] (part of [[Showtime Arabia]]) for the Middle East, [[North Africa]] and the [[Levant]] territories.

The series one episodes aired in Canada a couple of weeks after their UK broadcast, a situation made possible by the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]] which left vast gaps in CBC's schedule. For the Canadian broadcast, Christopher Eccleston recorded special video introductions for each episode (including a trivia question as part of a viewer contest) and excerpts from the ''Doctor Who Confidential'' documentary were played over the closing credits; for the broadcast of "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" on 26 December 2005, [[Billie Piper]] recorded a special video introduction.

==Adaptations and other appearances==
===Dr. Who movies===
{{main|Dr. Who (Dalek films)}}
There are two "Dr. Who" cinema films: ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'', released in 1965 and ''[[Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD]]'' in 1966. Both are retellings of existing TV stories (specifically, the first two Dalek serials) on the big screen, with a larger budget and alterations to the series concept.

In these [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|films]], [[Peter Cushing]] plays a human scientist named "Dr. Who", who travels with his two granddaughters and other companions in a time machine he has invented. The [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)#Other appearances|Cushing version]] of the character reappears in both comic strip and literary form, the latter attempting to reconcile the film continuity with that of the series.

In addition, a number of planned films were proposed including a sequel, [[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]], loosely based on the original series story (the third to feature the same antagonists), for the Cushing Doctor, plus many attempted TVM and big screen productions to revive the original [[Doctor Who]], after the original series was cancelled. (See [[List of unmade Doctor Who serials and films#Proposed films|List of proposed Doctor Who films]])

===Spin-offs===
{{main|Doctor Who spin-offs}}
''Doctor Who'' has appeared on stage numerous times. In the early 1970s, [[Trevor Martin]] played the role in ''[[Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday]]'' which also featured former companion actress [[Wendy Padbury]] (Pertwee's Doctor made a cameo appearance via film). In the early 1990s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a musical play titled ''[[Doctor Who - The Ultimate Adventure]]''. For two performances while Pertwee was ill, [[David Banks]] (best known for playing various [[Cyberman|Cybermen]]) played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while [[Terry Nation]] wrote ''[[The Curse of the Daleks]]'', a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor.

A pilot episode for a potential spin-off series, ''[[K-9 and Company]]'', was aired in 1981 with [[Elisabeth Sladen]] reprising her role as companion [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and [[John Leeson]] as the voice of [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]], but was not picked up as a regular series.

Concept art for an animated ''Doctor Who'' series was produced by animation company [[Nelvana]] in the 1980s, but the series was not produced.<ref name="nelvana">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/planetofthedoctor/tb_gallery.html|title=Planet of the Doctor|accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref>

The Doctor has also appeared in webcasts and in audio plays; prominent among the latter were those produced by [[Big Finish Productions]] from 1999 onwards, who were responsible for a [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish|range of audio plays]] released on CD, as well as 2006's eight-part [[BBC 7]] series starring [[Paul McGann]].

Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled ''[[Torchwood]]'' (an [[anagram]] of "Doctor Who"), set in modern-day Wales and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on [[BBC Three]] on 22 October 2006.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/whatson/prog_parse.cgi?FILENAME=20061022/20061022_2150_2075_8189_50 Torchwood programme information], BBC Three listings.

===Charity episodes===
In 1993, coinciding with the series' 30th anniversary, a charity special entitled "[[Dimensions in Time]]" was produced in aid of [[Children in Need]], featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. Not taken seriously by many, the story had the [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]] opening a hole in time, cycling the Doctor and his companions through his previous incarnations and menacing them with monsters from the show's past. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', the action taking place in the latter's [[Albert Square]] location and around [[Greenwich]], including the ''[[Cutty Sark]]''. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]] requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look perfectly normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.

[[Image:Curseoffataldeath.jpg|thumb|[[Rowan Atkinson]] as the Doctor and [[Julia Sawalha]] as Emma in the [[parody]] "[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death|The Curse of Fatal Death]]".]]
In 1999, another special, "[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]", was made for [[Comic Relief]] and later released on [[VHS]]. An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased. (The version released on [[video]] was split into only two episodes.) In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Hugh Grant]], and [[Joanna Lumley]]. The script was written by [[Steven Moffat]], later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.<ref name=RTDgone />

===Spoofs and cultural references===
{{main|Doctor Who spoofs}}
''Doctor Who'' has been satirised and spoofed on many occasions by comedians including [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Lenny Henry]]. [[Doctor Who fandom|''Doctor Who'' fandom]] has also been lampooned on programmes such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'', ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

[[Image:Simpsons Doctor Who.jpg|thumb|The [[Fourth Doctor]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]'']]
The Doctor in his fourth incarnation has been represented on several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', starting with the episode "[[Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming]]". [[Jon Culshaw]] frequently impersonates the Fourth Doctor in the BBC ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' series. Culshaw's "Doctor" has telephoned four of the "real" Doctors—Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy—in character as the Fourth Doctor. In the 2005 ''Dead Ringers'' Christmas special, broadcast shortly before "[[The Christmas Invasion]]", Culshaw impersonated both the Fourth and Tenth Doctors, while the Second, Seventh and Ninth Doctors were impersonated by [[Mark Perry (impressionist)|Mark Perry]], [[Kevin Connelly]] and [[Phil Cornwell]], respectively.

Less a spoof and more of a [[pastiche]] is the character of Professor Justin Alphonse Gamble, a renegade from the [[Time Variance Authority]], who appeared in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' #79 and ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Annual'' #22. His enemies include the rogue robots known as the Dredlox.<ref>{{cite web

In the Channel 4 series ''[[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|Queer As Folk]]'' (created by current ''Doctor Who'' executive producer Russell T Davies), the character of Vince was portrayed as an avid ''Doctor Who'' fan, with references appearing many times throughout in the form of clips from the programme.

==Awards==
Although ''Doctor Who'' was fondly regarded during its original 1963–1989 run, it received little critical recognition at the time. In 1975, [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 11 (1973–74)|Season 11]] of the series won a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award for Best Writing in a Children's Serial. In 1996, BBC television held the "Auntie Awards" as the culmination of their "TV60" season, celebrating sixty years of BBC television broadcasting, where ''Doctor Who'' was voted as the "Best Popular Drama" the corporation had ever produced, ahead of such ratings heavyweights as ''[[EastEnders]]'' and ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''.<ref name="auntieawards">{{cite news|title=Viewers spurn TV's golden age in poll of small screen classics as the BBC fetes its 60th birthday|first=Andrew|last=Culf|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=1996-11-04|page=4}}</ref> In 2000, ''Doctor Who'' was ranked third in a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the twentieth century, produced by the [[British Film Institute]] and voted on by industry professionals.<ref name="tv100">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/911085.stm|title=Fawlty Towers tops TV hits|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2000-09-05|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> In 2005, the series came first in a survey by [[SFX magazine]] of "The Greatest UK Science Fiction and Fantasy Television Series Ever".

The revived series has received particular recognition from critics and the public. In 2005, at the [[National Television Awards]] (voted on by members of the British public), ''Doctor Who'' won "Most Popular Drama", Christopher Eccleston won "Most Popular Actor" and Billie Piper won "Most Popular Actress". The series and Piper repeated their wins at the 2006 National Television Awards, and David Tennant won "Most Popular Actor" in 2006 and 2007, with the series again taking the Most Popular Drama award in 2007.<ref>{{cite news
