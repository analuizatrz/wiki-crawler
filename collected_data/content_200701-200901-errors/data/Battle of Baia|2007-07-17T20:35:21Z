The '''Battle of Baia''' was fought on [[December 15]], [[1467]] between the [[Moldavian]] Prince, [[Stephen the Great]] and [[Hungary|Hungarian]] King, [[Matthias Corvinus]]. The battle was the last Hungarian attempt in subduing Moldavia, as previous attempts had ended in failure. Corvinus invaded Moldavia due to Stephen's annexation of [[Kilia|Chilia]] &mdash; a fortress and harbour at the coast of the [[Black Sea]] &mdash; which at the time was controlled by Hungarian and [[Wallachian]] forces, though it had belonged to Moldavia centuries earlier. The conflict ended with a bitter defeat for the Hungarians that put an end to all Hungarian claims on Moldavia. Corvinus almost died after being injured thrice by arrows and barely made his escape back to Transylvania.

==Background==
In 1359, [[Bogdan I of Moldavia]] rebelled against Hungary and founded an independent Moldavia. The Hungarian ambition of seizing control over Moldavia did not end there, however, and in 1429, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] &mdash; and also King of Hungary &mdash; met with [[Jogaila|Władysław Jagiełło]], [[King of Poland]] to try to persuade him to launch a common attack on Moldavia and divide the country between them two.<ref name = "p.449">The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 449</ref> Sigismund argued that the Moldavian nation does not "owe allegiance to anyone, is accustomed to live by theft and brigandage and so is everyone's enemy." He also complained about not receiving any help against his struggle against the Turks.<ref name = "p.449">The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 449</ref> In the Annals of [[Jan Długosz]], the [[Poles|Polish]] chronicler wrote the following on Władysław’s reply to Sigmund:

{{cquote|Wladislaw replies that it would not be right to wage war on the Wallachians, who confess the Christian faith and have given him and his kingdom obedience and submission; indeed, to do this would be an act of savagery. Though some may live by brigandage, they cannot all be tarred with the same brush, nor can they be blamed for not helping King Sigismund against the Turks, because they had gone with the Poles to the given rendez-vous on the Danube and got there on time, yet had to waste two months waiting there, and then return home. Rather does the blame for this attach to King Sigismund, who failed to turn up at the appointed time. The squabbling continues for several days, at the end of which Wladyslaw stubbornness compels Sigismund to abandon the plan and seek other ventures.<ref name = "p.449">The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 449</ref>}}

In 1442, Hungary again had to renounce its claims on Moldavia.<ref>The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 487</ref> On [[October 17]], [[1451]], Prince [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]] was assassinated by [[Petru Aron]], a pretender to the Moldavian throne. The country was thrown into civil strife which lasted until 1457, when Stephen, son of Bogdan, gained the throne and ousted the boyars loyal to Aron. The latter fled to Poland, but were later forced to seek asylum in [[Transylvania]], after Moldavia and Poland concluded a new treaty. Stephen’s objective was to regain the region of [[Budjak]] with the castle of [[Chilia]] and Cetatea Albă. The region had previously belonged to Wallachia, but had been incorporated into Moldavia since the late 14th century.<ref>’’Moldavia in the 11th-14th Centuries’’, p. 218</ref> Due to a decline of Moldavia during the civil war, the region was reverted to Wallachia, with Chilia being co-ruled by Hungary and Wallachia. 
{{See also|The Night Attack}}
In 1462, Stephen sent a letter to his cousin, Prince [[Vlad Dracula]] of Wallachia, asking him to return Chilia back to Moldavia &mdash; a demand that was most likely refused.<ref>Vlad Tepes si Stefan cel Mare - prieteni sau dusmani?</ref> On June 22, when Dracula was fighting Sultan [[Mehmed II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Stephen launched an attack on Chilia, with some Turkish assistance, with the objective to capture the fortress.<ref name = "p. 149">Dracula: Prince of many faces - His life and his times, p. 149</ref> The Wallachians rushed to the scene with 7,000 men and together with the Hungarian garrison battled the Moldavians and the Turks for eight days, defeating them and wounding Stephen in his foot with a shrapnel<ref name = "p. 149">Dracula: Prince of many faces - His life and his times, p. 149</ref>—an injury which would hasten his death. In 1465, when Dracula was imprisoned in Hungary, Stephen again advanced towards Chilia with a large force and siege weapons; but instead of besieging the fortress, he showed the garrison — who favoured the Polish King — a letter in which the King requires them to surrender the fortress. The garrison complied with the King's demand and Stephen enters the fortress escorted by Polish troops where he finds “its two captains, rather tipsy, for they have been to a wedding.”<ref name = "p. 552">The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 552</ref> Mehmed was furious about the news and claimed Chilia for being a part of Wallachia &mdash; which now was a vassal to the [[Porte]] &mdash; and demanded Stephen to leave it over to him. However, the latter refused and recruited an army, forcing Mehmed &mdash; who was not yet ready to wage war &mdash; to accept the situation, if only for the time being.<ref name = "p. 552">The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 552</ref> Długosz recalls that in the beginning of his reign, Stephen reformed his army by extending rights for men to bear arms:

{{cquote|This Stephen's rule has been so strict and just that no crime has gone unpunished and people now obey his every order. He has insisted that not only the knights and nobility should bear arms, but that farmers and villagers do so as well, for everyone has a duty to defend his fatherland. If the Voivode learns that a farmer does not have a bow, arrows and a sword, or has mustered without a spear, the culprit is condemned to death.<ref name = "p. 566">The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 566</ref>}}

In 1446, Stephen regained [[Khotyn]] from Poland in a diplomatic victory, but in the same year, Corvinus comes on bad terms with King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] of Poland,<ref>Istoria lui Ştefan cel Mare, p. 91</ref> which frustrated the Hungarian king further, knowing that Moldavia was a Polish [[fief]]. One year later, in 1447, the locals of Transylvania started a terrible uprising in which Corvinus had a difficult time in putting an end to;<ref name = "p. 94">Istoria lui Ştefan cel Mare, p. 94</ref> he later found out that Stephen had supported the rioters—probably in order to find and kill Aron. Długosz writes in his ‘’Annals’’ that in 1447, a certain ‘’’Berendeja’’’ went to the court of Corvinus and promised him to make Moldavia his vassal, if the King would in turn make him Prince of Moldavia.<ref name = "p. 566">The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 566</ref> This was denounced by Romanian historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], who argued that Corvinus started recruiting troops and took Aron with him to put him on the Moldavian throne,<ref name = "p. 94">Istoria lui Ştefan cel Mare, p. 94</ref> but Długosz adds in ‘’Historiae Polonicae’’ that Corvinus brought with him both Aron and Berendeja,<ref name = "POL">Historiae Polonicae</ref> making it more confusing to know whom the king considered for the Moldavian throne.

===Preparations for war===
The Hungarians recruited an army of 40,000,<ref name = "POL">Historiae Polonicae</ref> many drawn locally from Transylvania. Many knights and Hungarian aristocrats followed, one of them being [[Stefan Báthory]].<ref name = "p. 95">Istoria lui Ştefan cel Mare, p. 95</ref> With them, they brought 500 cannons<ref name = "POL">Historiae Polonicae</ref> and other heavy siege equipment.<ref>Sfântul Voievod Ştefan cel Mare, Letter of Stephen to Casimir, January 1, 1468</ref> The Moldavians, being fewer in number and seeing that the Hungarians were determined to wage war, started to evacuate the population close to the Hungarian border and blockaded the passages by cutting down trees and placing them on the roads.<ref name = "p. 94">Istoria lui Ştefan cel Mare, p. 94</ref>

[[Image:Battlbaia.png|left|350px|thumb|Map of the battle, showing the Moldavian attack.]]

==Battle==
The Hungarians departed in the middle of October<ref name = "POL">Historiae Polonicae</ref> and reached the realm of Moldavia at the beginning of November, using a passage near [[Bacău]].<ref name = "p. 95">Istoria lui Ştefan cel Mare, p. 95</ref> On November 19,<ref name = "p. 95">Istoria lui Ştefan cel Mare, p. 95</ref> the Hungarians arrived at the [[Trotuş River]] where they met some Moldavian resistance, but Corvinus, to ensure the “loyalty of his troops, avoids a pitched battle and limits his efforts to surprise attacks and ambushes, yet is himself prevented from foraging or doing further damage.”<ref name = "p. 566">The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 566</ref>
The town was destroyed and the Hungarians headed for [[Bacău]], which they also burned down; then they continued to [[Roman, Romania|Roman]] and stayed there between November 29 and December 7. According to a chronicle, Stephen sent envoys to negotiate a peace treaty, but the two factions could not agree and the war continued.<ref name = "">Historia Pannonica ab Origine Gentis AD Annum 1495</ref> Roman was put to flames and the Hungarians killed everyone they encountered, “without considering their sex, age, or looks.”<ref name = "POL">Historiae Polonicae</ref> After three days of marching and more pillaging, they reached Baia where Corvinus met with a Hungarian by the name of Sythotus, who revealed to him the Moldavian position, their numbers (12,000), and their plan to attack before dusk.<ref name = "">Historia Pannonica ab Origine Gentis AD Annum 1495</ref> The Moldavians were encamped further north, between the rivers of [[Moldau]] and [[Szamos]]. Corvinus ordered the city to be fortified with “ramparts, ditches and a ring of wagons,”<ref name = "p. 566">The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 566</ref> as the men were told to be prepared for battle and guards were sent to guard strategic points. 

A peculiar report mentions that Stephen himself was captured by the Hungarians on December 14, but that he managed to trick them in releasing him.<ref name = "MOL">Moldavian-German Chronicle, The</ref> On December 15, when dusk was approaching, Stephen sent smaller detachments that set the town on fire from three different places: —thereafter, noise and confusion set in<ref name = "">Historia Pannonica ab Origine Gentis AD Annum 1495</ref> as Stephen ordered his men to dismount: then they launched their attack<ref name = "POL">Historiae Polonicae</ref> and made battle until dawn. Descriptions of the battle say that the fire made the night equally light as the day and that many Hungarians were consumed by the flames.<ref name = "">Historia Pannonica ab Origine Gentis AD Annum 1495</ref> The two armies started to butcher each other at the gate of the city; then the fighting continued onto the streets “with such a wrath, that nothing could be seen as more horrible than this.”<ref name = "">Historia Pannonica ab Origine Gentis AD Annum 1495</ref> The Moldavians got the upper hand of the battle and launched another attack against the royal guard, which was made out of 200 heavily armed knights and the aristocrats and Corvinus. Many Moldavians were put to death in the tumult that followed, as Báthory and the rest of the knights tried to defend the entrance to the market.<ref name = "">Historia Pannonica ab Origine Gentis AD Annum 1495</ref> Corvinus was wounded by three arrows in the back and had to be “carried from the battlefield on a stretcher, to avoid him falling into the hands of the enemy.”<ref name = "p. 566">The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 566</ref> 

The retreating Hungarian army, on its way to Transylvania, was stopped by a blockade; there they decided to dig down the 500 cannons and other treasures, so the Moldavians could not lay their hands on them. According to Długosz, Corvinus escaped the Moldavians due to the assistance of another [[Vlach]] (Romanian), whom Stephen found and had executed because of treachery.<ref name = "POL">Historiae Polonicae</ref> The ''Moldavian-German Chronicles'' say that a certain Isaia failed to launch the cavalry attack which would have blocked the path for the Hungarian retreat; for this, he and others were later executed.<ref name = "MOL">Moldavian-German Chronicle, The</ref> Around 10,000 Hungarians were said to have been killed; most of the barons escaped with their king.<ref name = "POL">Historiae Polonicae</ref> A Hungarian chronicle mentions 7,000 casualties for the Moldavians,<ref name = "">Historia Pannonica ab Origine Gentis AD Annum 1495</ref> but the chronicle is given little credit due to being the only one mentioning the Moldavian casualites in numbers; and given that the Hungarians had no opportunity to calculate the numbers of their fallen enemy. The entire conflict, with the Hungarian invasion and retreat, took around forty days.<ref name = "POL">Historiae Polonicae</ref>

==Aftermath==

Some of the Hungarian standards that were captured came with a "huge booty of tents, waggons and guns," were sent to Casimir as proof of Stephen's victory.<ref name = "p. 566">The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 566</ref>}} Upon his return to [[Braşov]] on [[Christmas]] day, Corvinus took revenge on the people who had rebelled against him by torturing them to death; thereafter he fined the Transylvanians a sum of 400,000 [[Italian coin florin|florins]], which they had to pay immediately, in gold. With this money he raised an army of foreign mercenaries, which would prove more loyal to him.<ref name = "POL">Historiae Polonicae</ref> In 1468, Stephen campaigned in Transylvania, found Aron and had him executed.<ref>Istoria lui Ştefan cel Mare, p. 99</ref> Stephen and Corvinus would later negotiate a peace treaty and become allies; in 1475, Corvinus sent 1,800 soldiers that assisted Stephen in his victory at the [[Battle of Vaslui]].
