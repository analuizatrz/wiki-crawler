{{Nihongo|'''''Death Note'''''|デスノート|Desu Nōto}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] series originally written by [[Tsugumi Ohba]] and illustrated by [[Takeshi Obata]]. The series primarily centers around a high school student who decides to rid the world of evil with the help of a [[supernatural]] [[notebook]] that kills anyone whose name is written in it.

''Death Note'' first began as a manga series. It was first serialized by [[Shueisha]] in ''[[Weekly Shonen Jump]]'' from the first issue in December [[2003]] to May [[2006]], with 108 chapters in total. The series has been published in its entirety in 12 [[tankōbon|graphic novel]]s in Japan, and is currently in publication in [[North America]].  The series has been adapted into a pair of [[live-action]] [[film]]s (released in Japan on [[June 17]] [[2006]] and [[November 3]] [[2006]] respectively), and an [[anime]] series which commenced airing in Japan on [[October 3]] [[2006]]. Also, a [[novelization]] of the series, written by [[light novel]]ist [[Nisio Isin]], was released in Japan on [[August 1]] [[2006]].

==Plot==
{{main|Plotline of Death Note}}

[[Characters of Death Note#Light Yagami|Light Yagami]] is a brilliant, but bored, high school student who resents the crime and corruption in the world. His life undergoes a drastic change when he discovers a mysterious notebook, known as the "Death Note", lying on the ground in the year [[2003]]. The Death Note's instructions claim that, if a human's name is written within it, that person shall die. Light is initially skeptical of the Death Note's authenticity, believing it is just a prank. However, after experimenting with it and killing two criminals, Light is forced to admit that the Death Note is real. After meeting with the true owner of the Death Note, a [[Shinigami]] named Ryuk, Light seeks to become "the God of the new world" by passing his judgment on criminals.

Soon, the number of inexplicable deaths of reported criminals catches the attention of the International Police Organization and a mysterious detective known only as "''L''". L quickly learns that the serial killer, dubbed by the public as "''Kira''" (derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the English word "''Killer''"), is located in Japan. L also concludes that Kira can kill people without laying a finger on them. Light realizes that L will be his greatest nemesis, and a race to prove mental superiority between the two begins.

{{main|List of Death Note characters}}

===Main characters===
[[Image:Raitoindeepthought.PNG‎|thumb|left|[[Light Yagami]]]]
;{{Nihongo|'''Light Yagami (Kira)'''|夜神月|Yagami Raito}}
:The main character of ''Death Note'', Light is a brilliant but bored 17-year old student. When he finds the Death Note dropped in the human world by Ryuk, a [[Shinigami]], he decides to use it to kill all criminals, his ultimate goal being to cleanse the world of evil to create a [[utopia]] and to be the [[God]] of this new world. He calls himself Justice.

[[Image:LandhisTea.PNG‎|thumb|right|L]]
;{{Nihongo|'''L'''|エル|Eru}}
:L is the world's top-rated detective, tasked with tracking down and arresting Kira, and Light's nemesis. His disheveled appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. L has many quirks, such as sitting in an odd manner, snacking on sweets in the middle of meetings and holding his cellphone in an odd manner. He often takes drastic strategies to confuse and force his opponents, and on several occasions he has willingly disclosed several of his weaknesses to Kira at the risk of his own life in the hopes that he would lure him into a trap.

[[Image: Misa Amane.jpg|thumb|left|Misa Amane]]
;{{Nihongo|'''Misa Amane'''|弥海砂|Amane Misa}}
:A girl with an immense crush on Kira. She is a popular [[Japanese idol|idol]] in Japan, and tends to wear clothing in many different styles, depending on what she is doing. She is immature and has a tendency to refer to herself in the third person (calling herself "Misa-Misa") in an attempt to be cute. Misa is totally devoted to Light, and she once said that she loved him "at first sight". Light, however, only views her as an asset to his plans because of her Death Note and her "[[Shinigami Eyes]]" (that she obtained at the cost of half of her remaining life span). These "Shinigami Eyes" give Misa the ability to know people's names by looking at their faces, thereby giving Kira an edge in his battle against his enemies. Misa read in the newspapers that the murderer of her family was punished by Kira, explaining her total devotion to him, regardless of whether she thinks of his actions as good or evil.

;{{Nihongo|'''Mello'''|メロ|Mero}}
:Mello was an orphan who grew up with Near in Watari's shelter for gifted children. Like Near, Mello was one of the candidates to become L's successor. Similar to L's fondness for sweets, he is often seen eating bars of chocolate. Contrary to Near and L, Mello, although quite intelligent, often lets his emotions get the better of him.

;{{Nihongo|'''Near'''|ニア|Nia}}
:Near was a primary candidate to become L's successor and calls himself N during the course of his investigations. He too shares a similarity to L: much like L played with things such as sugar cubes and forks, Near is seen playing with toys and his hair throughout the series. He offered to join forces with Mello to fight Kira. When Mello turned down his offer, he gained the support of the US government and formed the Secret Provision for Kira (SPK).

===Shinigami (The Death Gods)===

[[Image:Ryuuk.gif|thumb|right|Ryuk]]
;{{Nihongo|Ryuk|リューク|Ryūku}}
:The original Shinigami who dropped the Death Note in the human world, which Light would pick up. Acting out of pure boredom, Ryuk begins the story of Death Note on a whim. It is stated that Ryuk obtained the second Death Note by tricking the King of Shinigami, although it is not known how<!-- Didn't Ryuk take/steal the Death Note the other tentacled shinigami dropped? -->. Perhaps neutral by nature, Ryuk often refuses to aid Light and instead enjoys watching him struggle for his goal. The most important facet of Ryuk's character is that he is not Light's friend. He acts for his own interests and entertainment and often fails to tell Light key details about the Death Note. Ryuk is selfish, however, and will aid Light if it serves his own goals, such as providing amusement or obtaining apples.

[[Image: Rem.gif|thumb|left|Rem]]
;{{Nihongo|Rem|レム|Remu}}
<!-- Rem is female. She is the only female Death God we know of, but she is indeed female, so please do not change this section again to imply that she is male. Thank you. This comment is invisible. -->
:The female Shinigami who first gives Misa her Death Note and "eyes." Similar to Ryuk, Rem possesses two Death Notes; however, she purposely gives a Death Note to Misa Amane. Rem inherited her second Death Note from Jealous and thought it only right to pass it on to Misa. Oddly enough, Rem inherits Jealous' love for Misa as well and is prompt to defend Misa even at the cost of her life. She brings this to light when she openly shows her lack of trust for Light stating that if Misa dies before her time, Rem will kill Light thus ending her own life as well.

==Death Note==
A Death Note is a book held by a Shinigami which has the power to kill people if certain conditions are met. All Death Notes follow a long set of specific rules, and the writer revealed a few of these rules with each volume of the manga in Japan.

===Rules of the Death Note===
{{main|Rules of the Death Note}}

====Written rules====
Before releasing his Death Note into the human world, Ryuk wrote some of the rules on the first page in English, because he believed that English is the most popular [[language]] in the world. The rules written by Ryuk are the following:
<!-- NOTE: All of the rules that belong in this section are here. Please do not add any other rules to this section, or remove any of them. Thank you. !-->
*The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
*This note will not take effect unless the writer has the subject's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
*If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the subject's name, it will happen.
*If the cause of death is not specified, the subject will simply die of a heart attack. 
*After writing the cause of death, the details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

Each volume of the manga has a page containing new rules or possible uses for the Death Note. In the anime series, each [[eyecatch]] contains a different rule written in both English and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], similar to how they were revealed in the Japanese manga. Two new rules are revealed every episode.

====False rules====
In addition to these original rules, Light persuaded Ryuk to add a set of fake rules to mislead L and company. The reason behind this was to remove all suspicion of him and Misa being Kira and the Second Kira and preventing L from destroying the Death Note.

*If the owner of the Death Note does not kill within 13 days of the last entry, he or she will die.
*If the Death Note is burnt, destroyed, or otherwise damaged in any way, all those who have touched that Death Note will die.

==Media==
''Death Note'' began as a manga series which was later adapted to become a set of live-action films, an anime based on the manga, and a [[Light Novel]].  A game has also been released for the Nintendo DS in Japan.

A ''Death Note'' video game for the [[Nintendo DS]], entitled '''''Death Note Kira Game''''', was released on [[February 15]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Death Note Ads Starting To Make Their Way Into Magazine Pages|url=http://ds.qj.net/category/Death-Note/cid/2230|work=[http://www.qj.net/ QJ.net]|date=[[2006]]-[[08-19]]|accessdate=2006-12-18}}</ref> 
''Kira Game'' is a strategy game where the player takes on the role of Kira or L. These are just titles, as any character can be Kira or L. The player will attempt to deduce who their enemy is (Kira will try to uncover L's identity and vice versa). This will play out in 3 phases: Investigation, where the player will discuss the case and clues with other characters; Voting, where each member of the investigation team casts a vote on who they suspect is L or Kira based on the player's performance in the previous phase; L/Kira, where the player can either focus their investigation on one member to see if they are Kira (L part) or force a member off of the team (Kira part).<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Konami Website for Death Note: Kira Game|url=http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/deathnote/index.html|accessdate=2007-02-03|language=Japanese}}</ref> The gameplay is very similar to that of the common party game [[Mafia (game)|Mafia]].

Several characters from ''Death Note'' appear in ''[[Jump Super Stars]]'' and ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', a fighting game featuring a plethora of characters from ''[[Shonen Jump]]'' titles. These include Light/Kira, Ryuk, L, Misa, Near, and Mello.

===Soundtracks===
{{main|Death Note original soundtracks}}
There have been several soundtracks released for this series, such as the ones for the movie adaptations and also for the anime adaptation.

==Shenyang incident==
Some schools in [[Shenyang]], [[China]] have banned the manga after some of their students started to tease friends and teachers by altering a stationery notebook to resemble a Death Note and writing their names in them.<ref name="shenyang">{{cite news|title=Death Note Stirs Controversy in China|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=6111|accessdate=2006-11-07|date=[[2006]]-[[02-06]]|work=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>

The newspaper ''Shenyang Night Report'' called ''Death Note'' "poison, creating wicked hearts".<ref name="shenyang"/> Others however, including one major Chinese newspaper, feel that the ban is an overreaction and is inappropriate.<ref name="shenyang"/>
