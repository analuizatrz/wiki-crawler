{{Audio-IPA|Bangladesh.ogg|'''Bangladesh'''}} ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]:<!--The following spelling is correct. If you see anything odd, your browser isn't Unicode compliant:--> বাংলাদেশ  {{IPA|[ˈbaŋlad̪eʃ]}} '''{{lang|inc-Latn|Bangladesh}}'''), officially the '''People's Republic of Bangladesh''' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ ''{{lang|inc-Latn|Gônoprojatontri Bangladesh}}'') is a [[country]] in [[South Asia]]. It is bordered by [[India]] on all sides except for a small border with [[Burma]] to the far southeast and by the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the south. Together with the Indian state of [[West Bengal]], it makes up the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]]. The name ''Bangladesh'' means "Country of Bengal" in the official [[Bengali language]].

The borders of present-day Bangladesh were established with the [[1947 Partition of Bengal|partition of Bengal]] and [[Partition of India|India]] in 1947, when the region became the [[East Pakistan|eastern wing]] of the newly-formed [[Pakistan]]. However, it was separated from the [[West Pakistan|western wing]] by 1,600 kilometres (1,000&nbsp;mi) across India. Political and linguistic discrimination as well as economic neglect led to popular agitations against [[West Pakistan]], which led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|war for independence]] in 1971 and the establishment of Bangladesh. However, the new state had to endure famines, natural disasters and widespread poverty, as well as political turmoil and [[Military coups in Bangladesh|military coups]]. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative stability and economic progress.

Bangladesh is among the most densely populated countries in the world and has a high poverty rate. Geographically the country straddles the fertile [[Ganges Delta|Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta]] and is subject to annual [[monsoon]] floods and [[cyclone]]s. The government is a parliamentary democracy; however, political rule has been suspended under emergency law since January 11, 2007. Bangladesh is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]], [[BIMSTEC]], the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference|OIC]], and the [[Developing 8 Countries|D-8]]. As the World Bank notes in its July 2005 Country Brief, the country has made significant progress in human development in the areas of [[literacy]], gender parity in schooling and reduction of population growth.<ref name="worldbank-brief">

{{seealso|History of Bengal}}
Remnants of [[civilisation]] in the greater [[Bengal]] region date back four thousand years,<ref name="bharadwaj">{{cite book |last=Bharadwaj |first=G |editor=Majumdar, RC |year=2003 |chapter=The Ancient Period |title=History of Bengal |publisher=B.R.

The exact origin of the word "Bangla" or "Bengal" is unknown, though it is believed to be derived from ''Bang'', the Dravidian-speaking tribe that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC.<ref name="congress">{{cite book |publisher=Library of Congress |url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/bdtoc.html |chapter=Early History, 1000 B.C.-A.D. 1202 |title=Bangladesh: A country study |editor=James Heitzman and Robert L.

After the arrival of [[Indo-Aryans]], the kingdom of [[Gangaridai]] was formed from at least the seventh century&nbsp;BC, which later united with [[Bihar]] under the [[Magadha]] and [[Maurya Empire]]s. Bengal was later part of the [[Gupta Empire]] from the third to the sixth centuries&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]]. Following its collapse, a dynamic Bengali named [[Shashanka]] founded an impressive yet short-lived kingdom. Shashanka is considered the first independent king in the history of Bangladesh. After a period of [[anarchy]], the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]] ruled the region for four hundred years, followed by a shorter reign of the [[Hindu]] [[Sena dynasty]]. Islam was introduced to Bengal in the twelfth century by [[Sufism|Sufi]] missionaries, and subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread [[Islam]] throughout the region.<ref name="eaton">{{cite book |last=Eaton |first=R |year=1996 |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-20507-3 |oclc=26634922 76881262}}</ref> [[Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiar Khilji]], a Turkish general, defeated [[Lakshman Sen]] of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal. The region was ruled by dynasties of [[Sultan]]s and feudal lords for the next few hundred years. By the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled Bengal, and Dhaka became an important provincial centre of Mughal administration.

European traders arrived late in the 15th century, and their influence grew until the [[British East India Company]] gained control of Bengal following the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757.<ref name="baxter">{{cite book

In 1950, land reform was accomplished in East Bengal with the abolishment of the feudal [[zamindar]]i system.<ref>Baxter, p. 72</ref> However, despite the economic and demographic weight of the east, Pakistan's government and military were largely dominated by the upper classes from the west. The [[Bengali Language Movement]] of 1952 was the first sign of friction between the two wings of Pakistan.<ref>Baxter, pp. 62-63</ref> Dissatisfaction with the central government over economic and cultural issues continued to rise through the next decade, during which the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] emerged as the political voice of the Bengali-speaking population. It agitated for [[Six point movement|autonomy]] in the 1960s, and in 1966, its president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was jailed; he was released in 1969 after an unprecedented popular uprising.

[[Image:P015.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], founder of Bangladesh.]]
In 1970, a massive [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] devastated the coast of East Pakistan, and the central government responded poorly. The Bengali population's anger was compounded when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose [[Awami League]] won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections,<ref>Baxter, pp. 78-79</ref> was blocked from taking office. After staging compromise talks with Mujib, President [[Yahya Khan]] arrested him on the early hours of March 26, 1971, and launched [[Operation Searchlight]],<ref name="salik">{{cite book |last=Salik |first=Siddiq |year=1978 |title=Witness to Surrender |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-577264-4 |ISBN status=May be invalid - please double check}}</ref> a sustained military assault on East Pakistan.

Rummel comments that, ''In East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) [General Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan and his top generals] also planned to murder its Bengali intellectual, cultural, and political elite. They also planned to indiscriminately murder hundreds of thousands of its Hindus and drive the rest into India. And they planned to destroy its economic base to insure that it would be subordinate to West Pakistan for at least a generation to come.

Most of the Awami League leaders fled and set up a government-in-exile in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India. The Bangladesh Liberation War lasted for nine months. The [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[Mukti Bahini]] and Bengali regulars eventually received support from the [[Indian Armed Forces]] in December 1971. The Indian army, under the command of [[Jagjit Singh Aurora|Lt. General J.S. Aurora]], achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan on December 16, 1971, taking over 90,000 [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]<ref name="burke">{{cite journal |last=Burke |first=S |year=1973 |title=The Postwar Diplomacy of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 |journal=Asian Survey |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=1036–1049 |doi=10.1525/as.1973.13.11.01p0385c}}</ref> in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]].

After its independence, Bangladesh became a parliamentary democracy, with Mujib as the Prime Minister. In the 1973 parliamentary elections, the Awami League gained an absolute majority. A nationwide famine occurred during 1973 and 1974,<ref name="sen"/> and in early 1975, Mujib initiated a one-party socialist rule with his newly formed [[BAKSAL]]. On August 15, 1975, Mujib and his family were assassinated by mid-level military officers.<ref name="mascarenhas">{{cite book |last=Mascarenhas |first=A |year=1986 |title=Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton, London |isbn=0-340-39420-X |oclc=13004864 16583315 242251870}}</ref>

A series of bloody coups and counter-coups in the following three months culminated in the ascent to power of General [[Ziaur Rahman]], who reinstated multi-party politics and founded the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP). Zia's rule ended when he was assassinated in 1981 by elements of the military.<ref name="mascarenhas"/> Bangladesh's next major ruler was General [[Hossain Mohammad Ershad]], who gained power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and ruled until 1990, when he was forced to resign under western donor pressure in a major shift in international policy after the end of communism when anti-communist dictators were no longer felt necessary. Since then, Bangladesh has reverted to a parliamentary democracy. Zia's widow, [[Khaleda Zia]], led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to parliamentary victory at the general election in 1991 and became the first female Prime Minister in Bangladesh's history. However, the Awami League, headed by [[Sheikh Hasina]], one of Mujib's surviving daughters, clinched power at the next election in 1996 but lost to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party again in 2001. These two female ex-prime ministers are now in imprisonment in a sub-jail due to their suspected attachment with corruption.

In January 11, 2007, following widespread violence, a caretaker government was appointed to administer the next general election. The country had suffered from extensive corruption,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4353334.stm |title=Bangladesh tops most corrupt list |publisher=BBC News |date=[[2005-10-18]] |accessdate=2007-04-13}}</ref> disorder and political violence. The new caretaker government has made it a priority to root out corruption from all levels of government. To this end, many notable politicians and officials, along with large numbers of lesser officials and party members, have been arrested on corruption charges. The caretaker government claims to be paving the way for free and fair elections to be held before the end of 2008.

[[Image:Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban (Roehl).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]] houses the Parliament of Bangladesh.]] Bangladesh is a [[parliamentary democracy]] with [[Islam]] as the state religion.<ref>http://www.pmo.gov.bd/constitution/index.htm Constitution of Bangladesh]</</ref> Direct elections involving all citizens over the age 18 are held every five years for the [[unicameral]] [[parliament]] known as Jatia Sangsad. The parliament building is known as the ''[[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]]'' designed by architect [[Louis Kahn]] and currently has 345 members including 45  reserved seats for women, elected from single-member constituencies. The [[Prime Minister]], as the [[head of government]], forms the [[cabinet]] and runs the day-to-day affairs of state. While the Prime Minister is formally appointed by the [[President of Bangladesh|President]], he or she must be an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] who commands the confidence of the majority of parliament. The President is the [[Head of State|head of state]], a largely ceremonial post elected by the parliament.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3452.htm Background Note: Bangladesh], US Department of State, May 2007</ref>

However the President's powers are substantially expanded during the tenure of a [[caretaker government]], which is responsible for the conduct of elections and transfer of power. The officers of the caretaker government must be non-partisan and are given three months to complete their task. This transitional arrangement is an innovation that was pioneered by Bangladesh in its 1991 election and then institutionalised in 1996 through its 13th constitutional amendment.<ref name="amendments">{{cite encyclopedia  |url=http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/C_0336.htm |title=Constitutional Amendments |encyclopedia=[[Banglapedia]] |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref>

The [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] was drafted in 1972 and has undergone fourteen [[Constitutional amendment|amendment]]s.<ref name="amendments"/> The highest [[judicial]] body is the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Supreme Court]]. Justices are appointed by the President. The judicial and law enforcement institutions are weak.<ref name="ICG">[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=4462&l=1 Bangladesh Today], Asia Report N°121, [[International Crisis Group]], October 23, 2006</ref> Separation of powers, judicial from executive was finally implemented on the 1st of November, 2007. It is expected that this separation will make the judiciary stronger and impartial. Laws are loosely based on [[English law|English common law]], but family laws such as marriage and inheritance are based on religious scripts, and therefore differ between religious communities.

<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Political_rivals_Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|200px|The rivalry between Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina has dominated Bangladeshi politics for years.]] -->
The two [[List of political parties in Bangladesh|major parties]] in Bangladesh are the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) and the [[Bangladesh Awami League]]. BNP is led by [[Khaleda Zia]] and finds its allies among [[Islamist]] parties like [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]] and [[Islami Oikya Jot]], while [[Sheikh Hasina]]'s Awami League aligns with [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] and [[Secularism|secularist]] parties. Hasina and Zia are bitter rivals who have dominated politics for 15 years; both are women and each is related to one of the leaders of the independence movement. Another important player is the [[Jatiya Party]], headed by former military ruler Ershad. The Awami League-BNP rivalry has been bitter and punctuated by protests, violence and murder. Student politics is particularly strong in Bangladesh, a legacy from the liberation movement era. Almost all parties have highly active student wings, and students have been elected to the Parliament.

Two radical Islamist parties, [[Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh]] (JMJB) and [[Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh]] (JMB), were banned in February 2005. Bomb attacks taking place since 1999 have been blamed on those groups, and hundreds of suspected members have been detained in numerous security operations, including the head of those two parties in 2006. The first recorded case of a suicide bomb attack in Bangladesh took place in November 2005.

The January 22, 2007 election was postponed indefinitely and emergency law declared in January 11, 2007 as Army backed caretaker government of [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]] aims to prepare a new voter list and crack down on corruption. The government aims to hold new elections by 2008 but a lack of coordination between the Election Commission and the Government and Political Parties threatens to undermine this deadline. Recent activities of Government have created uncertainty about Election while Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina, two leader of major Political parties BNP and Awami League who ruled the country for 15 years last, were detained and are facing criminal charges in court and the banned indoor politics is yet to be exercised.

Meanwhile the Bangladesh Military has expressed their interest in controlling the country with statements like "own brand of Democracy" and making changes in the constitution to allow military participation in politics. <ref> [http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/04/03/d7040301022.htm Bangladesh to have own brand of democracy, Army chief says] </ref> They are also assisting the interim Government of Bangladesh in a drive against corruption which seems to be mostly targeted against the politicians and opponents.

==Foreign policy and military==
{{Main|Foreign relations of Bangladesh|Military of Bangladesh}}

Bangladesh pursues a moderate foreign policy that places heavy reliance on multinational diplomacy, especially at the United Nations. In 1974 Bangladesh joined both the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] and has since been elected to serve two terms on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] in 1978-1979 and 2000–2001. In the 1980s, Bangladesh played a lead role in founding the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) in order to expand relations with other South Asian states. Since the founding of SAARC 1985, a Bangladeshi has held the post of Secretary General on two occasions.

Bangladesh's most important and complex foreign relationships are with India and [[Pakistan]]. These relationships are informed by historical and cultural ties and form an important part of the domestic political discourse.

Bangladesh's [[India-Bangladesh relations|relationship with India]] began on a positive note because of India's assistance in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|independence war]] and reconstruction.

Bangladesh enjoys relatively warm ties with the People's Republic of China which has, particularly in the past decade, increased economic cooperation with the South Asian nation. Between 2006-07, trade between the two nations rose by 28.5% and there have been agreements to grant various Bangladeshi commodities tariff-free access to the Chinese market.
Military cooperation between the [[Military of Bangladesh]] and the [[People's Liberation Army]] is also increasing, with joint military agreements signed and Bangladesh procuring Chinese arms which range from small arms to large naval surface combatants such as the Chinese [[Jianghu class frigate|Type 053H1]] Missile Frigate.

{{main|Divisions of Bangladesh|Districts of Bangladesh|Upazilas of Bangladesh}}
Bangladesh is divided into six administrative divisions,<ref name="CIA2007"/> each named after their respective divisional headquarters: [[Barisal Division|Barisal]] (বরিশাল), [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]] (চট্টগ্রাম), [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]] (ঢাকা), [[Khulna Division|Khulna]] (খুলনা), [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]] (রাজশাহী), and [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] (সিলেট)<!--The spelling is correct. If you see anything odd, your browser isn't Unicode compliant.-->.

Divisions are subdivided into districts (''zila''). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into ''upazila'' (subdistricts) or ''thana'' ("police stations"). The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several ''unions'', with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into ''mahallas''. There are no elected officials at the divisional, district or upazila levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of twelve) in every union for female candidates.<ref name="unionwomen">''Local Government Act'', No. 20, 1997.</ref>

[[Dhaka]] is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. Other major cities include [[Chittagong]], [[Khulna]], [[Rajshahi]], and [[Barisal]].These metropolitan cities have [[mayor]]al elections, while other municipalities elect a chairperson. Mayors and chairpersons are elected for a span of five years.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:Satellite image of Bangladesh in October 2001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Satellite image presenting physical features of Bangladesh.]]
{{main|Geography of Bangladesh}}
Bangladesh is located in the low-lying [[Ganges]]-[[Brahmaputra]] River Delta or Ganges Delta. This delta is formed by the confluence of the [[Ganges River|Ganges]] (local name [[Padma River|Padma]] or ''Pôdda''), [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] ([[Jamuna River|Jamuna]] or ''Jomuna''), and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna to eventually empty into the Bay of Bengal. The [[Alluvium|alluvial soil]] deposited by these rivers has created some of the most fertile plains in the world. Bangladesh has 58 [[trans-boundary river]]s, making water issues politically complicated to resolve - in most cases as the lower [[riparian]] state to India.<ref>{{cite web

Straddling the [[Tropic of Cancer]], Bangladeshi climate is [[Tropics|tropical]] with a mild winter from October to March, a hot, humid summer from March to June. A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such as [[Floods in Bangladesh|flood]]s, [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[tornado]]es, and [[tidal bore]]s occur almost every year,<ref name="NatDis">{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=David E. |title= Natural Disasters |origdate= |origyear= 1993 |origmonth= |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gWHsuGTcF34C&pg=PA532&dq=bangladesh+natural+disasters&sig=X3qyOQhMo_cmSyJDqrRvxujAUKI |format= |accessdate=2008-05-02 |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year= 1999|month= |publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers|location= Dordrecht|language=English |isbn=0412047519 |oclc= 27974924 43782866|doi= |id= |pages=532 |chapter=The Third World |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref> combined with the effects of [[deforestation]], [[Soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] and [[erosion]].

In September 1998 Bangladesh saw the most severe flooding the modern world has seen.

Two-thirds of the country was underwater.
There were several reasons for the severity of the flooding.  Firstly, there were unusually high [[monsoon]] rains. Secondly, the [[Himalayas]] shed off an equally unusually high amount of melt water that year. Trees that usually intercept rain water were cut down for firewood or to make space for animals.<ref name="EWG">{{cite book |last=Haggett|first=Peter |title= Encyclopedia of World Geography |origdate= |origyear=2002 |origmonth= |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IROIY4ONOSEC&pg=PA2634&dq=bangladesh+flood+reason&lr=&as_brr=3&sig=qahkOCuykzX2R1JYNREsdB8_yEc#PPA2635,M1 |format= |accessdate=2008-05-02 |accessyear= |accessmonth= |publisher= Marshall Cavendish |series= |volume= |date= |year= 2002|month= |location= New York|language=English |isbn=0761473084 |oclc= 46578454|doi= |id= |pages=2,634 |chapter=The Indian Subcontinent |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Bangladesh}}
[[Image:Cox's Bazaar Fishermen.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Near the town of Cox's Bazaar in southern Bangladesh. Many industries in Bangladesh are still primitive by modern standards.]]
Despite continuous domestic and international efforts to improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains a developing nation.<ref>"[http://www.unfpa-bangladesh.org/pdf/success_05.pdf Reproductive Health and Rights is Fundamental for Sound Economic Development and Poverty Alleviation]," [[United Nations Population Fund]].

[[Jute]] was once the economic engine of the country. Its share of the world export market peaked in the [[Second World War]] and the late 1940s at 80%<ref name="jute">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/J_0135.htm |title=Jute |encyclopedia=Banglapedia |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref> and even in the early 1970s accounted for 70% of its export earnings. However, [[polypropylene]] products began to substitute for jute products worldwide and the jute industry started to decline. Bangladesh grows very significant quantities of rice(chal), tea (Cha) and [[Mustard plant|mustard]]. Although two-thirds of Bangladeshis are farmers, more than three quarters of Bangladesh’s export earnings come from the [[garment industry]],<ref name="garments">{{cite news |last=Roland |first=B |year=2005  |title=Bangladesh Garments Aim to Compete |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4118969.stm}}</ref> which began attracting foreign investors in the 1980s due to cheap labour and low conversion cost.

[[Image:Rice Field.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Worker in a [[paddy field]] - a common scene throughout Bangladesh. Two thirds of the population works in the agricultural sector.]]
Obstacles to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises, mismanaged [[port]] facilities, a growth in the labour force that has outpaced jobs, inefficient use of energy resources (such as [[natural gas]]), insufficient power supplies, slow implementation of economic reforms, political infighting and [[Political corruption|corruption]]. According to the World Bank, "among Bangladesh’s most significant obstacles to growth are poor governance and weak public institutions."<ref name="worldbank-brief"/>

[[Image:Bashundhara city.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bashundhara City]], the largest shopping mall in [[South Asia]].]]
Despite these hurdles, the country has achieved an average annual growth rate of 5% since 1990, according to the World Bank. Bangladesh has seen expansion of its [[middle class]], and its [[consumer]] industry has also grown. In December 2005, four years after its report on the emerging "[[BRIC]]" economies ([[Brazil]], Russia, India, and China), [[Goldman Sachs]] named Bangladesh one of the "[[Next Eleven]],"<ref name="nextele">{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000177&sid=aoJ4WG5LSf1s&refer=market_insight |title=South Korea, Another `BRIC' in Global Wall |date=2005-12-09}}</ref> along with [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], [[Pakistan]] and seven other countries. Bangladesh has seen a dramatic increase in [[foreign direct investment]]. A number of [[multinational corporation]]s and local big business houses such as [[Beximco]], [[SQUARE (Bangladesh)|Square]], [[Akij Group]], [[Ispahani]], [[Navana Group]], [[Habib Group]], [[KDS Group]] and multinationals such as  [[Unocal Corporation]] and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], have made major investments, with the natural gas sector being a priority. In December 2005, the [[Bangladesh Bank|Central Bank of Bangladesh]] projected GDP growth around 6.5%.<ref name="bdbank1">[http://www.bangladesh-bank.org/pub/annual/anreport/annual.html Annual Report 2004–2005, Bangladesh Bank]</ref>

One significant contributor to the development of the economy has been the widespread propagation of [[microcredit]] by [[Muhammad Yunus]] (awarded the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] [[Nobel Peace Prize|peace prize]] in 2006) through the [[Grameen Bank]]. By the late 1990s, Grameen Bank had 2.3&nbsp;million members, along with 2.5&nbsp;million members of other similar organisations.<ref name="schreiner">{{cite journal |last=Schreiner |first=Mark |year=2003 |title=A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh |journal=Development Policy Review |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=357–382 |doi=10.1111/1467-7679.00215}}</ref>

In order to enhance economic growth, the government set up several export processing zones to attract foreign investment. These are managed by the [[Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority]].

{{main|Culture of Bangladesh}}
{{seealso|Public holidays in Bangladesh|Sport in Bangladesh|Music of Bangladesh}}

A new state for an old nation, Bangladesh has a culture that encompasses elements both old and new. The [[Bengali language]] boasts a rich literary heritage, which Bangladesh shares with the Indian state of West Bengal. The earliest literary text in Bangla is the eighth century [[Charyapada]]. Bangla literature in the medieval age was often either religious (e.g. [[Chandidas]]), or adaptations from other languages (e.g. [[Alaol]]). Bangla literature matured in the nineteenth century. Its greatest icons are the poets [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]]. Bangladesh also has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by ''[[Maimansingha Gitika]]'', ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]'' or stories related to ''[[Gopal Bhar]]''.

The musical tradition of Bangladesh is lyrics-based (''Baniprodhan''), with minimal instrumental accompaniment. The [[Baul]] tradition is a unique heritage of Bangla folk music, and there are numerous other musical traditions in Bangladesh, which vary from one region to the other. [[Gombhira]], [[Bhatiali]], [[Bhawaiya]] are a few of the better-known musical forms. Folk music of Bengal is often accompanied by the [[ektara]], an instrument with only one string. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol]], [[flute]], and [[tabla]]. Bangladesh also has an active heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]]. Similarly, Bangladeshi dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance tradition.<ref>{{Citation | last = Hasan| first = Laila | contribution =Dance | editor-last = Islam | editor-first = Sirajul | editor-link = Sirajul Islam | title = [[Banglapedia]]: National encyclopedia of Bangladesh | publisher = [[Asiatic Society]] of Bangladesh | place = [[Dhaka]] | isbn = 9843205766 | publication-date = 2003 | contribution-url =http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/D_0018.htm | year = 2003 | oclc = 52727562}}</ref> Bangladesh produces about 80 films a year.<ref name="hayat">[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/F_0076.htm Feature film] in Banglapedia</ref> Mainstream [[Bollywood|Hindi films]] are also quite popular.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author=Reuters |coauthors= |title= Cinemas in Bangladesh, Pakistan squeezed by Bollywood |url=http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IE420060925014228&Page=4&Title=Features+-+People+%26+Lifestyle&Topic=0  |publisher=NewIndPress.Com |language=English|date= 2006-09-25|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> Around 200 dailies are published in Bangladesh, along with more than 1800 periodicals.

The culinary tradition of Bangladesh has close relations to [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Middle Eastern cuisine]] as well as having many unique traits. Rice and curry are traditional favourites. Bangladeshis make distinctive [[confectionary|sweetmeat]]s from milk products; some common ones are ''[[Rasgulla|Rôshogolla]]'', ''Chômchôm'' and ''Kalojam''. 

The [[sari]] ''(shaŗi)'' is by far the most widely worn dress by Bangladeshi women. However, the [[salwar kameez]] ''(shaloar kamiz)'' is also quite popular, and in urban areas some women wear Western attire. Among men, European dressing has greater acceptance. Men also use the ''[[kurta]]-paejama'' combination, often on religious occasions. The [[lungi]], a kind of long skirt, is widely worn by Bangladeshi men.

The two [[Eid]]s, [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]] are the largest festivals in the Islamic calendar. The day before Eid ul-Fitr is called ''Chãd Rat'' (the night of the Moon), and is often marked by firecrackers. Other [[Muslim holidays]] are also observed. Major Hindu festivals are [[Durga]] [[Puja]] and [[Saraswati]] Puja. [[Vesak|Buddha Purnima]], which marks the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]], is one of the most important Buddhist festivals while [[Christmas]], called ''Bôŗodin'' (Great day) in [[Bangla]] is celebrated by the minority Christian population. The most important secular festival is [[Pohela Baishakh]] or Bengali New Year, the beginning of the Bengali calendar. Other festivities include [[Nobanno]], ''Poush parbon'' (festival of[[Poush]]) and observance of national days like [[Language movement|Shohid Dibosh]].

==Sports==
{{main|Sports in Bangladesh}}

[[Cricket]] is the most popular [[sport in Bangladesh]].  In 2000, the [[Bangladeshi cricket team]] was granted [[Test cricket]] status and be able to play other test playing nations. Other popular sports include [[association football]], [[field hockey]], [[tennis]], [[badminton]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[chess]], [[carrom|carrom games]], and [[kabadi]] ( a seven-a-side team-sport played without a ball or any other equipment, which is the national sport of Bangladesh).
