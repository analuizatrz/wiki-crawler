'''Oregon Route 422''' (OR 422) is an [[Oregon]] [[state highway]] running from Modoc Point Road near [[Klamath Agency, Oregon|Klamath Agency]] to [[U.S. Route 97|US 97]] near [[Chiloquin, Oregon|Chiloquin]].  OR 422 is known as the '''Chiloquin Highway''', which is [[State highways in Oregon|Highway 422]].  It is 5.29 miles long and runs east-west, entirely within [[Klamath County, Oregon|Klamath County]].

OR 422 was established in [[2002]] as part of Oregon's project to assign route numbers to [[State highways in Oregon|highways]] that previously were not assigned.  Sometime before June 2007, an OR 422 shield was placed at the end of the off-ramp from NB US 97, but the rest of the route was still unsigned at that time.

OR 422 has an unsigned spur in Chiloquin, which runs 0.191 miles.
