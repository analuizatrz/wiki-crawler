'''''Casino Royale''''' ([[2006 in film|2006]]) is the twenty-first film in the [[James Bond]] [[James Bond (film series)|series]]; it is directed by [[Martin Campbell]] and the first to star [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. Based on the [[1953 in literature|1953]] [[Casino Royale (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]], it was adapted by screenwriters [[Neal Purvis]], [[Robert Wade (screenwriter)|Robert Wade]], and [[Paul Haggis]]. 

It is the third screen adaptation of the ''Casino Royale'' novel, which was previously produced as a [[Casino Royale (Climax!)|1954 television episode]] and a [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|1967 satirical film]]. However, the 2006 film is the only [[EON Productions]] adaptation of Fleming's novel. It is a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the Bond franchise, establishing a new timeline and narrative framework not meant to be preceded by any previous film.<ref>{{cite web|title=IGN: Interview: Campbell on Casino Royale|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/659/659741p1.html|work=[[IGN]]|date=2005-10-19|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> This not only frees the Bond franchise from more than forty years of continuity, but allows the film to show a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/entertainment/061116_bond_review.html|title=New James Bond Proves Worthy of Double-0 Status|accessdate=2007-06-16|work=[[Space.com]]|date=2006-10-21}}</ref> 

The film is set at the beginning of James Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his [[Licence to kill (concept)|licence to kill]]. After preventing a terrorist attack at Miami Airport, Bond falls for [[Vesper Lynd]], the treasury agent assigned to provide the money he needs to foil a high-stakes poker tournament organized by [[Le Chiffre]]. The film's story arc continues in the 22nd James Bond film, ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''.

''Casino Royale'' was released on 16 November 2006. The casting for the movie involved a widespread search for a new actor to portray James Bond, and significant controversy over Daniel Craig when he was eventually selected. Some [[Pierce Brosnan]] fans threatened to boycott the film in protest.<ref name="Location2">{{cite web|title=Blond, James Blond|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/11/08/commentary/mediabiz/index.htm|work=[[CNN]]|date=2006-11-06|accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> Despite this, the film, and Daniel Craig's performance in particular, earned critical acclaim. ''Casino Royale'' was produced by EON Productions for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], marking the first official Bond film to be co-produced by the latter studio, which had produced and originally distributed the 1967 [[Canon (fiction)|non-canonical]] film version.

==Plot==
In [[Prague]], James Bond earns his [[00 Agent|double-O]] status when he corners and kills corrupt [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] section chief Dryden and his underworld contact Fisher. In Uganda, [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] arranges a meeting between a banker, Le Chiffre, and Obanno, the leader of a guerrilla group seeking a safe haven for his funds. Le Chiffre assures the leader that there is "no risk in the portfolio", but his investments actually involve considerable risk: he [[short (finance)|short sells]] successful companies and then profits by engineering terrorist attacks to sink their stock values.

In his first mission as Agent 007, Bond pursues an international bomb-maker named Mollaka in Madagascar. After a [[parkour]]<!--Before you change this, the source at the end of the sentence refers to the sequence as "parkour" and not "free running". Thank you.!--> chase across the city to the [[List of fictional countries|Nambutu]] embassy,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theurbanheroes.com/client.php?client=1 |title=Curtis - Sébastien's stunt double |date=2006-11-29 |publisher=www.theurbanheroes.com |accessdate=2007-05-14|quote=Curtis was hired to be a stunt double in the recent James Bond film ''Casino Royale''. He was on location in the Bahamas for 13 weeks working closely with Gary Powell, the stunt coordinator, to help plan and execute the opening chase scene.}}</ref> Bond kills his target and blows up a part of the embassy to enable his escape. He obtains Mollaka's mobile phone and discovers that it has received an [[Short message service|SMS]] from Alex Dimitrios, an associate of Le Chiffre in the Bahamas. Bond travels there, wins Dimitrios's [[Aston Martin DB5]], and seduces his wife, [[Solange Dimitrios]], who reveals that her husband is flying to Miami on business. Bond follows him to Miami, where he kills Dimitrios, and observes Le Chiffre's henchman, Carlos, leaving for the [[Miami International Airport]]. There, Bond foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype [[List of James Bond vehicles#Aircraft|''Skyfleet'' airliner]] while managing to kill Carlos, leaving the banker with a major financial loss, since he had shorted and bought [[put options]] on Skyfleet stock, which then expired worthless.

Now under pressure to recoup his clients' money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes [[poker]] tournament at Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]]. Hoping that a defeat would force Le Chiffre to aid the British government in exchange for protection from his creditors, MI6 enters Bond into the tournament. He meets up with [[René Mathis]], his ally in Montenegro, and [[Vesper Lynd]], a treasury agent, who is assigned to look after his handling of the government's $10 million [[buy-in]]. As the tournament progresses, Le Chiffre tricks Bond into believing he is bluffing; when Bond goes [[all-in]], he loses his initial stake.  Vesper, who says his bet was reckless, refuses to give Bond the funds to buy back into the tournament.

Distraught over his failure, Bond prepares to assassinate Le Chiffre when he is intercepted by one of the other players, who introduces himself as [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer [[Felix Leiter]].  Also out to get Le Chiffre, Leiter believes Bond has the skill to win and offers to supply him with enough funds to re-enter the tournament in exchange for allowing the CIA custody of Le Chiffre. Back in the game, Bond rapidly recoups his losses and wins the tournament with an [[Draw (poker)#Inside straight draw|inside draw]] to a straight flush. Following her celebratory dinner with Bond, Vesper is abducted by Le Chiffre, who uses her to lure Bond into a near-fatal car chase and ultimate capture. Le Chiffre tortures Bond for the access code to the game's winnings.  When it becomes clear that Bond will not yield, Le Chiffre prepares to [[castration|castrate]] him. At that moment [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] enters and executes Le Chiffre and his associates for their failure. Bond and Vesper are left alive.

Bond awakens in a hospital on [[Lake Como]] and orders the arrest of Mathis, whom Le Chiffre said was a [[double agent]]. Bond admits his love for Vesper and vows to quit the service before it strips him of his humanity. Accordingly, he posts his resignation to [[M (James Bond)|M]] and goes on a romantic holiday in Venice with Vesper. However, Bond soon learns that his poker winnings were never deposited into the Treasury's account. Realising that Vesper has stolen them, he pursues her into a building under renovation where she meets members of her organization. Bond shoots the flotation devices supporting the structure to gain access to the building, but as he does so the foundation starts to slowly collapse into the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]]. After killing the henchmen in the building, Bond finds Vesper imprisoned in an [[elevator]]. Apologising to him tearfully, she locks herself inside as the elevator plunges under the rising waters. Bond dives in, breaks into the elevator and pulls Vesper onto the roof of the collapsed building where she dies despite Bond's attempts to revive her. Mr. White, watching from a balcony, walks away with the money.

M tells Bond that Vesper had a [[France|French]]-[[Algeria]]n boyfriend who was kidnapped and held for ransom by the organization behind Le Chiffre and White. Bond learns that she agreed to deliver the ransom money (his winnings) only if they would consent to let Bond live. He discovers that Vesper has left Mr. White's name and number in her mobile phone for Bond to find. White, arriving at a palatial estate near Lake Como, receives a phone call. As he asks the identity of the caller, he is shot in the leg. Bond approaches, with a [[Suppressor|silenced]] [[Heckler & Koch UMP|UMP]] in hand, and replies, "The name's Bond. James Bond."

Two major exclusions from the film are the characters of [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] and [[Miss Moneypenny]]. Their exclusion makes ''Casino Royale'' the second film in the series without Q (''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' being the first), and the first without Moneypenny. In October 2005, producer Michael G. Wilson stated that the characters were not in the movie because they were not in the book, though Moneypenny was mentioned by Bond in the novel. The decision to leave Moneypenny's character out from the film coincided with the announcement by actress [[Samantha Bond]], who had portrayed the character in the previous four films, that she would not reprise the role.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hastings|first=Chris|coauthors=Nina Goswami and David Fickling|title=Ah, Miss Moneypenny.

==Production==
[[EON Productions]] gained the rights for ''Casino Royale'' in 1999 after [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] exchanged them for [[MGM]]'s rights to ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sony Pictures, in an accord with MGM, drops its plan to produce new James Bond movies.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1999-03-30|url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30814FC35540C738FDDAA0894D1494D81&n=Top%2fNews%2fBusiness%2fSmall%20Business%2fMarketing%20and%20Advertising|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> In March 2004, [[Neal Purvis]] and [[Robert Wade (screenwriter)|Robert Wade]] began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming to bring back an Ian Fleming flavour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Purvis & Wade Talk Bond & Jinx|work=[[MI6.co.uk]]|date=2004-03-09|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/event_purvis_wade_talk.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> [[Paul Haggis]]' main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. He explained, "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book. And there was a confession. So in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. And then she sent Bond to chase after the villains. And Bond chased the villains into the house. And I don't know why but I thought that Vesper had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her."<ref>{{cite news | author = Mark Lawson | title = Paul Haggis | work = [[guardian.co.uk]] | date = 2007-12-04 | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2223284,00.html | accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref>

Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] expressed interest in directing an adaptation of the ''Casino Royale'' novel,<ref>{{cite news|title=Kill Bill director aims for Bond|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2004-05-16|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3718975.stm|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> though this was only a personal interest, and he did not follow this up with EON.

EON admitted that they had relied too heavily on [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects in the more recent films, particularly ''Die Another Day'', and were keen to accomplish the stunts in ''Casino Royale'' "the old fashioned way".<ref>{{cite news|last=Alberge|first=Dayla|title=Fake stunts banished as new Bond keeps it real|work=[[The Times]]|date=2006-03-14|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2084375,00.html|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> In keeping with this drive for more realism, screenwriters Purvis, Wade, and Haggis wanted the script to follow as closely as possible to the original 1953 novel, keeping Fleming's darker storyline and characterisation of Bond.<ref name="cinematographer">{{cite news|author=Jon Silberg|title=High Stakes for 007|work=[[American Cinematographer]]|date=December 2006|url=http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/December2006/CasinoRoyale/page1.php|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>

''Casino Royale'' became the first Bond film to take its title from a Fleming novel or short story since 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. It is also the first Bond film since then not to be adapted as a [[novelization|novelisation]]. Instead, a film [[tie-in]] edition of Fleming's original novel was published.<ref>{{cite web|title=Casino Royale (movie tie-in) (James Bond OO7) (Paperback)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|date=2006-10-31|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143037668|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref>

===Casting===
[[Pierce Brosnan]] had originally signed a deal for three films, with an option for a fourth, when he was cast in the role of James Bond. This was fulfilled with the production of ''[[Die Another Day]]'' in 2002. However, at this stage Brosnan was approaching his 50th birthday, and speculation began that the producers were seeking to replace him with a younger actor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Is Brosnan too old to be 007?|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-207653/Is-Brosnan-old-007.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=2004-02-09|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref> Brosnan officially announced he was stepping down in February 2005. At one point producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] claimed there was a list of over 200 names being considered for his replacement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4337224.stm|title=Michael G. Wilson said 200 actors had been considered|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=2006-11-14|accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> According to Martin Campbell, [[Henry Cavill]] was the only actor in serious contention for the role. But being only 22 years old at the time, he was considered too young.<ref name="cast2">{{cite web|author=Chavez, Kellvin|url=http://www.latinoreview.com/films_2005/sonypictures/zorro2/mc-interview.html|work=Latino Review|title=Exclusive interview with Martin Campbell on Zorro and Bond|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> [[Sam Worthington]] was also considered.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117995318.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=Casting begins for 'War,' 'Titans'|author=Michael Fleming|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2008-11-05|accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref>

In May 2005, Daniel Craig announced that MGM and producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured him that he would get the role of Bond, and [[Matthew Vaughn]] told reporters that MGM offered him the opportunity to direct, but EON Productions at that point had not approached either of them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Craig, Vaughn on Bond|url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/609/609721p1.html|work=[[IGN]]|date=2005-05-03|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> A year beforehand, Craig rejected the offer as he felt the series had descended into formula: only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited [[Mossad]] and [[British Secret Service]] agents who served as advisors on the set of ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' as inspiring because, "Bond has just come out of the service and he's a killer. [...] You can see it in their eyes, you know immediately: oh, hello, he's a killer. There's a look. These guys walk into a room and very subtly they check the perimeters for an exit. That's the sort of thing I wanted."<ref>{{cite news|title=Daniel Craig: Quantum of Solace|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2008-10-11|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/10/11/sm_danielcraig111.xml|accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref>

On 14 October 2005, EON Productions and Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed to the public at a press conference in London that Craig would be the sixth actor to portray James Bond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,12589,1592512,00.html|work=[[guardian.co.uk]]|title=Daniel Craig confirmed as 006th screen Bond|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> Significant controversy followed the decision, as it was doubted if the producers had made the right choice.

The next important casting was that of the lead [[Bond girl]], Vesper Lynd. Casting director Debbie McWilliams acknowledged that Hollywood actresses [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Charlize Theron]] were "strongly considered" for the role and that Belgian actress [[Cécile de France]] had also auditioned, but her [[English English|English accent]] "wasn't up to scratch."<ref>{{cite web|title=Casino Royale Bond girl candidates|work=[[MI6.co.uk]]|date=2006-07-07|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/bond_21_girl_casting_rumours.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> [[Audrey Tautou]] was also considered, but not chosen because of her role in ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'' that was released in May 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/jamesbondnews.php?id=4470|title=The New Bond Girls!|work=[[Superhero Hype!]]|date=2006-07-07|accessdate=2006-03-04}}</ref> It was announced on February 16, 2006 that [[Eva Green]] would play the part.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.imdb.com/news/sb/2006-02-17#film5|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|title=New Bond Girl Will Be "Very Much an Equal to Bond"|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

===Filming===
[[Image:Daniel Craig on Venice yacht crop w Wilson.jpg|thumb|Craig in Venice during filming.]]
Principal photography for ''Casino Royale'' commenced on 30 January 2006 and concluded on 21 July 2006. The film was primarily shot at [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague, with additional location shooting in the Czech Republic, the [[Bahamas]], Italy, and the United Kingdom. The shoot concluded at [[Pinewood Studios]].<ref name="Real">{{cite video|title=James Bond: For Real|medium=DVD|publisher=Special Treats Productions|year=2006}}</ref>

Initially, Michael G. Wilson confirmed that ''Casino Royale'' would either be filmed or take place in Prague and South Africa. However, EON Productions encountered problems in securing film locations in South Africa.<ref>{{cite news|author=John Cox|title=Eon facing South African detour|work=CommanderBond.net|date=2005-08-08|url=http://commanderbond.net/?action=Story&SID=2877|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> After no other locations became available, the producers had to reconsider their options. In September 2005, Martin Campbell and [[cinematographer|director of photography]] [[Phil Meheux]] were scouting [[Atlantis Paradise Island|Paradise Island]] in the Bahamas as a possible location for the film.<ref>{{cite news|author=John Cox|title=Bond bound for Bahamas|date=2005-09-13|work=CommanderBond.net|url=http://commanderbond.net/?action=Story&SID=2922|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> On 6 October 2005, Martin Campbell confirmed that ''Casino Royale'' would film in the Bahamas and "maybe Italy". In addition to the extensive location filming, studio work including choreography and stunt coordination practice was performed at the Barrandov Studios in Prague and at Pinewood Studios where the film used several stages as well as the paddock tank and the historic [[007 Stage]]. Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for [[Dunsfold]] Aerodrome in [[Surrey]], the cricket pavilion at [[Eton College]] (although that particular scene was cut from the completed movie) and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in [[Bedfordshire]].<ref name="Location2">{{cite news|last=Matheson|first=Veronica|title=On the trail of James Bond|work=[[News Limited]]|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,23483,20707920-27978,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

After Prague, the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around [[New Providence]] were used for filming during February and March, particularly on Paradise Island. Footage set in [[Mbale]], Uganda was filmed at Black Park, Country Park in Buckinghamshire on 4 July 2006.

===Effects===
[[Image:GunBarrelPhoto.jpg|left|thumb|The [[James Bond gun barrel sequence|gunbarrel sequence]] modified as part of the opening sequence.]]
In designing the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer [[Daniel Kleinman]] was inspired by the cover of the 1953 British first edition of ''Casino Royale'', which featured Ian Fleming's original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood. Kleinman said, "The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles," like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts.<ref>{{cite web | title=Credits design | url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=4511 | work=[[MI6.co.uk]] | date=2006-12-06 | accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitized the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at [[Framestore CFC]] in London; the actors' silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commercials|publisher=[[Framestore]]|url=http://www.framestore-cfc.com/commercials/index.html|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>

For the rest of the film, Special Effects and Miniature Effects Supervisor [[Chris Corbould]], as with the producers, wanted to return to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduce digital effects. According to Corbould, "CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It’s the best way to go".<ref name="Real"/> Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the [[Miami Airport]] chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios.<ref name="Real"/>

First on the schedule were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.<ref name="Real"/> In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger, and reinforced with steel.<ref name="Real"/>

The sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the [[Dunsfold#Dunsfold Park|Dunsfold Aerodrome]] in Surrey, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports.<ref name="Real"/> In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden, and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.<ref name="Real"/>

The sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film.<ref name="Real"/> For the scene involving Bond following Vesper into the house undergoing renovation supported by inflatable balloons, a tank was constructed at the 007 stage at Pinewood, consisting of a Venetian piazza and the interior of the three-story dilapidated house. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves which were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model which the effects team built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model elevator within the rig could be immersed in {{convert|19|ft|m}} of water, and utilised banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.<ref name="Real"/>

The scene involving the car crash was devised using an [[Aston Martin DB9]] that was especially modified to look like Bond's [[Aston Martin DBS V12]] and reinforced to withstand the impact. Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450 mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at [[General Motors Proving Grounds#Millbrook Proving Grounds|Millbrook Proving Grounds]] and stunt driver Adam Kirley had to use an air cannon located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding <span style="white-space:nowrap">70&nbsp;mph&nbsp;(113&nbsp;km/h)</span>, the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] on 5 November 2006 as a new [[world record]].<ref name="Real"/>

==Release==
''Casino Royale'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]], the [[Odeon West End]] and the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire]] simultaneously in London on 14 November 2006. It marked the 60th Royal Film Performance and benefited the Cinema & Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), whose patron, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], was in attendance with the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]]. It is the third James Bond premiere that the Queen attended following ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967) and ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002).<ref> {{cite web|title=Daniel Craig makes his 007 debut at premiere of Casino Royale|work=[[Daily Mail]]|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=416461&in_page_id=1773&ico=Homepage&icl=TabModule&icc=picbox&ct=5|date=2006-11-18|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> Along with the cast and crew, numerous celebrities and 5,000 paying guests were also in attendance with half the proceeds benefiting the CTBF.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stars out for Bond royal premiere|work=[[BBC News Online]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6146090.stm|date=2006-11-14|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref>

Only two days following the premiere, pirated copies appeared for sale in London. "The rapid appearance of this film on the streets shows the sophistication and organisation behind film piracy in the UK," said Kieron Sharp, from the [[Federation Against Copyright Theft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6157066.stm

In January 2007, ''Casino Royale'' became the first Bond film ever to be shown in mainland Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the Cold War re-dubbed and new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of [[Texas Hold'em]], as the game is less familiar in China. ''Casino Royale'' earned approximately $11.7 million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens,<ref>

After critics dubbed ''[[Die Another Day]]'' "Buy Another Day" because of around twenty [[product placement]] deals, EON limited their promotions for ''Casino Royale''. Partners included Ford Motors, [[Heineken Pilsener]] (which [[Eva Green]] starred in adverts for), [[Smirnoff]], [[Omega SA]], [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]] and [[Sony Ericsson]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Marc Graser|title=Brands line up for Bond sequel|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2008-08-14|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117990584.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref>

===Box office===
The film achieved [[Pound sterling|GB£]]1.7 million of ticket sales in the UK on its first day of release. Weekend opening total in the UK was GB£13,400,000. The film also opened in the [[Republic of Ireland]] with over [[euro|€]]1,100,000 in the first 2 weeks. Altogether the film took about €4,200,000 in Ireland. From 16 November to 19 November 2006, the film took in over $40,000,000.<ref name=numbers/>

Opening day estimates in the United States and Canada showed ''Casino Royale'' on top with $14,750,000, while opening weekend estimates showed it in second place with $40,600,000,<ref>{{cite news|title=Casino Royale grosses $40.6 million|work=[[Superhero Hype!]]|date=2006-11-19|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/jamesbondnews.php?id=4922|accessdate=2006-11-19}}</ref> as well as earning another $42,000,000 internationally. Although ''[[Happy Feet]]'' won the overall weekend box office contest, the significance of such a comparison in earnings is problematic, as ''Happy Feet'' has little more than half the running time of ''Casino Royale'', and therefore had significantly more screenings per day, which translates into more potential gross. A better indication of the film's relative performances is that ''Casino Royale'', per theatre, outperformed ''Happy Feet'', which was released in 370 more theatres. According to [[Box Office Mojo]], ''Casino Royale'' took in, on average, $11,890 per theatre, while ''Happy Feet'' grossed $10,918 per theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=happyfeet.htm|title=Happy Feet (2006) box office|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref><ref name="BOM-CR"/>

==Reception==
===Reviews===
Critics gave the film a positive response, in particular Craig's performance and credibility. During production this had been subject to debate by the media and the public, as Craig did not appear to fit Ian Fleming's original portrait of the character as tall, dark, and suave. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' compared the quality of Craig's characterization of Bond to [[Sean Connery]]'s and praised the script as smartly written, noting how the film departed from the series' conventions. ''[[The Times]]'' compared the more assertive portrayal by Craig to [[Timothy Dalton]], and praised the action as edgy,<ref>{{cite news|title="Brilliant" Bond seduces critics|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2006-11-04|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6116286.stm?ls|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> with another reviewer citing in particular the action sequence involving the cranes in Madagascar.<ref>{{cite news|author=Stuart Wavell|title=Potato Head shoots way to 007 triumph|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=2006-11-05|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2437998,00.html|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> Critics Paul Arendt of BBC Films,<ref>{{cite web|last=Arendt|first=Paul|title=Casino Royale (2006)|work=[[bbc.co.uk]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/11/06/casino_royale_2006_review.shtml|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> [[Kim Newman]] of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|authorlink=Kim Newman|title=Casino Royale|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire Online]]|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=10199|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> and Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''<ref name=variety>{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|title=Casino Royale|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=http://www.variety.com/VE1117932077.html|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> all described Craig as the first actor to truly embody Ian Fleming's James Bond from the original novel: ironic, brutal, and cold.

The film was similarly well received in North America.

However, the film met several mixed reactions. Though American radio personality [[Michael Medved]] gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as "intriguing, audacious and very original... more believable and less cartoonish, than previous 007 extravaganzas", he commented that the "sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some Bond fanatics."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Michael Medved]]|title=Casino Royale|publisher=Eye On Entertainment|url=http://images.michaelmedved.com/images/pdf/casinoroyale.doc|accessdate=2006-11-30|format=DOC}}</ref> Similarly, a reviewer for ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' praised the film for its darkness and Craig's performance, but felt that "like the novel, it suffers from a lack of sharpness in the plot" and believed that it required additional editing, particularly the finale.<ref>{{cite web|title=The best Bond since Connery|work=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]|date=2006-10-20|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006480716,00.html|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> Commentators such as [[Emanuel Levy]] concurred, feeling the ending was too long, and that the film's terrorist villains lacked depth, although he praised Craig and gave the film a B+ overall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Emanuel|title=Casino Royale B+|publisher=Emanuel Levy|url=http://www.emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=3668|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> Other reviewers responded negatively, including Tim Adams of ''[[The Observer]]'' who felt the film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make the series grittier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Tim|title=You might be shaken, but this Bond won't leave you stirred|work=[[The Observer]]|date=2006-11-05|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1939830,00.html|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref>

[[Roger Moore]] wrote, "The script showed him as a vulnerable, troubled and flawed character. Quite the opposite to my Bond! Craig was, and is, very much the Bond Ian Fleming had described in the books – a ruthless killing machine. It was a Bond that the public wanted." So impressed was Moore that he chose to buy the DVD.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Roger Moore]]|title=Bye bye to Ian Fleming's James Bond?|work=[[The Times]]|date=2008-10-04|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/london_film_festival/article4866756.ece|accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref>

Vicky Allan of the ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' noted Bond himself, and not his love interests, was sexually objectified in this film. A moment where he rises from the sea is reminiscent of [[Ursula Andress]] in ''Dr. No''; he feels "skewered" by Vesper Lynd's criticism of him; "and though it would be almost unthinkable now have a female character in a mainstream film stripped naked and threatened with genital mutilation, that is exactly what happens to Bond in [the film]." So although the film backed off from past criticism of Bond girls being sex objects, "the once invincible James Bond becomes just another joint at the meat market".<ref>{{cite news|author=Vicky Allan|title=For your eyes only?|work=[[Sunday Herald]]|date=2008-10-27|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/arts/arts/display.var.2463325.0.0.php|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> This sentiment is shared by the [[University of Leicester]]'s James Chapman, author of ''Licence to Thrill'', who also notes Craig's Bond is "not yet the polished article"; he felt his incarnation of Bond is close to Fleming's because he is "humourless", but is also different because "Fleming's Bond did not enjoy killing; Craig's Bond seems almost to relish it."<ref>{{cite news|title=Daniel Craig's Bond 'relishes killing', professor claims|work=inthenews.co.uk|date=2008-10-28|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>
