'''Manchester''' is a [[city]] in [[North West England|North West]] [[England]]. The [[metropolitan borough]] of Manchester, which has [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]], has a population of 441,200, making it the most populous district of the [[Greater Manchester|Greater Manchester metropolitan county]].<ref>[http://www.manchester.gov.uk/planning/studies/keyfacts.htm Key facts and figures about Manchester], Manchester City Council.

==Geography and administration==
===Physical geography===
Manchester lies in a bowl-shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the [[Pennines|Pennine hills]] and to the south by the [[Cheshire]] Plain. The city centre is on the east bank of the [[River Irwell]], near the confluence of the [[River Medlock]] and the [[River Irk]] and is relatively low-lying, being between 35 and 42 [[metre]]s (115 to 138 [[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above [[sea level]]. The [[River Mersey]] flows through the south of Manchester. Much of the inner city, especially in the south, is flat, offering extensive views of the moors from the top floors of many high buildings. Manchester's geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world's first industrial city. These features are its climate, its proximity to a [[port|seaport]] at [[Liverpool]], the availability of water power from its rivers, and its nearby [[coal]] reserves.

===Climate===
Manchester has a relatively damp climate and a reputation as a rainy city. The average annual rainfall is 809&nbsp;mm, (902&nbsp;mm from some sources)<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=043330&refer= Manchester, England], www.weatherbase.com. URL accessed October 25, 2006.</ref> meaning that its reputation is relatively undeserved.<ref>{{cite web | title=Manchester tourist guide — Geography & weather| work=Manchester Online | url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/tourist/geographyandweather/s/63/63975_sunshine_and_rain.html | accessmonthday=November 2 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> For example, this total is less than that of [[Plymouth]] or [[Cardiff]]. In international terms, Manchester receives substantially less rain than [[New York City]], which receives 1200 mm of rain in an average year (although New York has fewer cloudy days per year), and its average annual rainfall total is comparable with that of [[Rome]]. The precipitation is, however, regularly light and prolonged so a small volume of rain may take an hour to fall in Manchester, compared to several minutes of heavy rain experienced in Rome. Manchester also has a relatively high humidity level, which lent itself to the optimised and breakage-free textile manufacturing which took place in the city. Snowfall is rare in the city itself, being low-lying, towards the west coast and an urban landscape.

==Etymology==
The name "Manchester" ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|/ˈmæntʃɛstə/}}) came from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name ''Mamucium'', thought to be a [[Latin]]isation of an original [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name (possibly meaning "breast-like hill" from ''mamm-'' = "[[breast]]"), plus [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''ceaster'' = "[[town]]", which is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[castra]]'' = "camp".<ref>{{cite book|author=Mills, A. D.|title=A Dictionary of British Place-names|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn= ISBN 0-19-852758-6}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Manchester}}
'''Early history'''
[[Image:Peterloo carlile.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The [[Peterloo massacre]].]]
The Manchester area was settled in or before [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times.<ref>Rogers, Nicholas - ''Halloween: from Pagan Ritual to Party Night'', 2003, [[Oxford University Press]], ISBN 0-1951-6896-8? P.18 </ref> The original fort was constructed by General [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] as a staging post between [[Chester]] (''Deva'') and York (''Eboracum''). This Roman settlement was named ''Mamucium'' ([[Celtic languages|Celtic]] for "[[breast]]-shaped hill") after the hill that it was sited on to be better defensible. The original location of the fort is now in the City of [[Salford]]. 

The fort was abandoned in the [[Dark Ages]], and at some point in time the focus of settlement shifted from this spot to the confluence of the rivers [[River Irwell|Irwell]] and [[Irk]].

In medieval times, this area included a fortified manor house. Thomas De La Warre, a manorial lord who also happened to be a priest, gave the site to the church for use as a College of Priests around 1422, and commenced the construction of the Collegiate Church. The former is now [[Chetham's School of Music]], and the latter [[Manchester Cathedral]].

Around the 13th century, Manchester grew heavily due to an influx of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] settlers who founded Manchester's new cotton industry{{Fact|date=February 2007}} and sparked the growth of the city to become [[Lancashire]]'s major industrial centre.  

'''Industrial Revolution'''
[[Image:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Manchester (or [[Cottonopolis]] as it was sometimes referred) during the early 19th century.]]
In the late 18th century, Manchester may have become the site of England's first entirely artificial canal when James Brindley built the [[Bridgewater Canal]] to bring coal from the eponymous Duke of Bridgewater's mines at Worsley.  During the 19th century Manchester grew to become the centre of [[Lancashire]]'s cotton industry and was dubbed "[[Cottonopolis]]". During this period the canal system grew, and Manchester became one end of the world's second passenger railway - the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

Manchester quickly grew into the most important industrial centre in the world, and, significantly, the first industrial society. The pace of change was fast and frightening. At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen &mdash; new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the so called 'Manchester School', promoting [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]''), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. "What Manchester does today," it was said, "the rest of the world does tomorrow." Also during this period Manchester saw a rise in its population as Lancastarians, the Irish, Jews and many other people immigrated to the city.

As well as being a centre of capitalism the city saw its fair share of rebellion by the working and non-titled classes, with the most famous being the events on St Peter’s Field on [[16 August]] [[1819]] which have become known as '[[Peterloo]]'. The first [[Trades Union Congress]] was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to [[6 June]] [[1868]]. Manchester was the subject of [[Friedrich Engels]]' ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', Engels himself spending much of his life in and around Manchester. Manchester was also an important cradle of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Suffragette]] Movement.

Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Many of the great public buildings (including the Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the [[Hallé Orchestra]]. In 1889, when county councils were created in [[England]], the municipal borough became a [[county borough]] with even greater autonomy. During this period, the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was created by the canalisation of the  Rivers Irwell and Mersey for 36 miles from Salford to the Mersey estuary at the port of Liverpool. This enabled ocean going ships to sail right into the Salford docks. The docks functioned up until the 1970s, with their closure leading to a large increase in unemployment in the area.

[[Image:Albert-Square-Manchester.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Albert Square]]

Manchester suffered greatly from the inter-war depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.

'''Recent history'''
During [[World War II]], Manchester was involved in heavy industrial construction &mdash; it was home to [[Avro]] (now [[BAE Systems]]) which built countless aircraft for the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], the most famous being the [[Avro Lancaster]] bomber. The city was attacked a number of times by the [[Luftwaffe]], particularly in the "Christmas Blitz" of 1941, which destroyed a large part of the historic city centre and seriously damaged the Cathedral.

In 2002, the city successfully hosted the [[2002 Commonwealth Games|XVII Commonwealth Games]], earning praise from many sources. Manchester has twice failed in its bid to host the [[Olympic Games]], losing to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] in 1996 and [[Sydney]] in 2000.

Rapidly developing institutions attract [[crime]] and disorder; see main article [[crime and policing in Manchester]].

'''Bombing'''
{{main|1996 Manchester bombing}}
[[Image:Manchesterbomb-devestation.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The devastation left by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] [[1996 Manchester bombing|bombing]]]]
At 11.20 am on Saturday [[15 June]] [[1996]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] detonated a large [[1996 Manchester bombing|bomb in the city centre]], the largest to be detonated on British soil. Whilst this bomb caused over 200 injuries, it caused no deaths, and the principal damage was to the physical infrastructure of nearby buildings. The consequent reconstruction spurred a massive regeneration of the city centre, with complexes such as [[The Printworks]] and the Triangle creating new city focal points for both shopping and entertainment. The regeneration took over a decade to complete. The latest and final part of the renovated [[Manchester Arndale]] opened in September 2006, allowing the centre to hold the title of Europe's largest city centre shopping mall.

'''Redevelopment'''
[[Image:Manchester Exchange Squares.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Manchester's [[Exchange Square (Manchester)|Exchange Square]] undergoing extensive regeneration.]]
Since the regeneration after the 1996 IRA bomb, and aided by the [[2002 Commonwealth Games|XVII Commonwealth Games]], Manchester's city centre has changed significantly. Large sections of the city dating from the 1960s have been either demolished and re-developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel; a good example of this transformation is the [[Manchester Arndale]]. Many old mills have been converted into apartments, helping to give the city a much more modern, upmarket look and feel. Some areas, like [[Hulme]], have undergone extensive regeneration programmes and many million-pound lofthouse apartments have since been developed to cater for its growing business community. The 169 metre tall, 47-storey [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]], completed in 2006, provides the highest residential accommodation in the United Kingdom - the lower 23 floors form the Hilton Hotel, while the upper 24 floors are apartments. The 23rd floor includes a 'sky bar' where you can enjoy a cocktail 23 floors above the ground. The [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]] is the tallest building in the UK outside London.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4944590.stm "City building reaches full height"], BBC, [[26 April]] [[2006]], retrieved [[2 May]] [[2006]].</ref>

==Politics==
{{main|Politics in Manchester}}

==Economics==
[[Image:CIS Tower.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[CIS Tower]] is one of the many company Headquarters in the city]]
Manchester has many office buildings, and its [[Central Business District]] is currently in the centre of the city, adjacent to Piccadilly, focused on Mosley Street, Deansgate, King Street and Piccadilly. However, new office space is appearing rapidly throughout the city, as its reputation as a high quality Business Centre increases. [[Spinningfields]] is a large new development west of Deansgate; it will be a large, modern business centre, and home to several headquarters, squares, and cafes. The first building on the site was the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]'s new headquarters{{Fact|date=February 2007}} on Deansgate. The project is being spear-headed by [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Sir Norman Foster]]. Other buildings include a 110 metre tall office building, a new justice centre and new [[Crown Court]], to be built over the next few years. 

Just outside the city boundaries, a new business district is appearing in [[Salford Quays]], regenerated ex-shipping docks similar to London's [[London Docklands|Docklands]], and is home to headquarters and [[call centres]] for many major companies. The announcement came in June 2006 that the [[BBC]] hopes to relocate several departments to the Quays from London.

===Shopping===
Manchester is recognised as a major retail centre. There is one large [[shopping mall|shopping centre]] in the city: the [[Manchester Arndale]], which is in the city centre. The city centre also has a number of smaller shopping centres, including [[Corn Exchange, Manchester|The Triangle]], which caters for a more youthful and upmarket clientèle, and the [[Royal Exchange, Manchester|Royal Exchange Centre]].

[[Image:Market St From Foodchain.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Manchester's Main Shopping District; Market Street]]

In the central shopping area of the city centre, quick and easy road access is difficult, making journeys around the city on foot quicker, safer and more convenient.  The pedestrianised [[Market Street (Manchester, England)|Market Street]] forms the core of the city centre's retail area.  It is dominated on the north side by the Manchester Arndale and a branch of [[Debenhams]]. 

The Shambles has a branch of [[Harvey Nichols]], a [[Marks and Spencer]] store, and a branch of [[Selfridges]], as well as a variety of upmarket designer [[boutiques]].  

[[Deansgate]] also has many shops, including the department store [[House of Fraser]] (formerly Kendals), along with [[pub]]s and bars. [[King Street, Manchester|King Street]] is an affluent shopping area where many exclusive fashion brands have stores. King Street also has many notable buildings preserved in a conservation area. Other hubs in the centre include St Ann's Square, and [[Exchange Square (Manchester)|Exchange Square]].  

Former stores, since gone, include [[Lewis's]], Henry's, and Affleck and Brown. The building that housed Affleck and Brown is now known as [[Affleck's Palace]]. It consists of low-cost stalls for independent traders and creatives. Affleck's is on [[Oldham Street]], in the [[Northern Quarter]], along with a range of independent music, clothing, and other shops.

===Food and drink===
Manchester has a range of restaurants, bars, and clubs, spanning the famous "[[Curry Mile]]" in [[Rusholme]] to traditional ‘grub’, [[Chinatown]], modern bars and bistros at Deansgate Locks in the city centre. In addition to these there are many independent fast food retailers throughout Manchester. There are now many top class restaurants.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

There is a [[Hard Rock Cafe]], chain restaurants such as [[Wagamama]] and bars that include Waxy O’Connors and The Living Room. The coffee chain [[Starbucks]] has 12 outlets in a 2 mile radius. Other, independent restaurants, bars and clubs can be found in the [[Northern Quarter]] area of the city centre.  Chains such as The Living Room, Revolution Vodka Bar, La Tasca, Est Est Est, and Restaurant, Bar and Grill all started in the city before being introduced to other cities across the UK.

Manchester is also famous for its beer, despite the closure of the [[Boddingtons]] brewery in 2005. [[Keg]] 'Boddies' is brewed by Interbrew in Luton but [[cask]] Boddington's continues to be brewed in the city by Hydes brewery in [[Moss Side]]. Hydes is a long established independent brewery. Another Manchester brewer is [[Joseph Holts (brewery)|Joseph Holt]], whose Derby Brewery in [[Cheetham]] is just round the corner from the defunct Boddingtons Strangeways brewery. The Royal Brewery in Moss Side — not far from Hyde's — brews [[McEwan's]] [[lager]]. J W Lees [[brewery]] is in [[Middleton Junction]], a few miles north of the city. There are also a notable number of [[microbreweries]] producing smaller quantities of high quality [[beer]], [[cider]] and [[perry]].

Breweries in the cities of Manchester and Salford which closed within the last twenty years include [[Wilson's]], whose [[Newton Heath]] brewery closed in the late 1980s, and Whitbread/Chester's in Salford.

==Demographics==
The [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] showed a total population for Manchester of 392,819, a 9.2% decline on the figure from the previous census, ten years before.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00BN-A.asp Manchester], www.statistics.gov.uk, National Statistics. http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00BN-A.asp Manchester], www.statistics.gov.uk, National Statistics.

75.9% of Manchester's population claim they have been born in the UK, according to the [[2001 UK Census]].

Inhabitants of Manchester are known as ''Mancunians'' or Mancs for short.

===Ethnicity===
81% of people identified themselves as "White", 5.9% as "[[India]]n" or "[[Pakistan]]i",  2.3% as "Black [[Caribbean]]" and 1.4% as "Black African".<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00BN-A.asp Manchester], www.statistics.gov.uk, National Statistics. URL accessed October 25, 2006.</ref>
Manchester has an ethnically diverse population, this is shown most in south Manchester, In areas such as [[Moss Side]], [[Longsight]], [[Rusholme]], and [[Whalley Range]] just to name a few. 
A high percentage of Mancunians (estimated at over 30 %) are of Irish ancestry.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} The city's [[St Patrick's Day ]] parade is one of the world's largest.

The success story of Britain’s Asian community received another boost as the shortlist for Lloyds TSB’s Northern Jewel Awards was unveiled, following a record 13,500 nominations. 

The annual event of the for Lloyds TSB’s Northern Jewel Awards, in its sixth year, took place at the Palace Hotel of Manchester on [[April 21]] [[2007]]. Winners from the crème de la crème of the [[Asia]]n community in the North of the [[United Kingdom]] were announced.<ref>[http://www.theasiannews.co.uk/news/s/226/226490_nominees_unveiled_for_northern_asian_jewel_awards.html?rss=yes Nominees unveiled for northern Asian Jewel Awards], [[Asia News Network]].

===Economic activity===
Manchester reported the second-lowest proportion of the population in employment of any area in the United Kingdom. Although unemployment in Manchester is higher than average, the primary reason for Manchester's low level of employed people is the very high proportion of the population who are students.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00BN-A.asp Manchester], www.statistics.gov.uk, National Statistics. URL accessed October 25, 2006.</ref>

==Education==
===Universities===
Manchester is home to two major [[University|universities]] - the [[University of Manchester]] and [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]  - which are both located to the south of the city centre. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom, and was created in autumn 2004 by the merger of [[Victoria University of Manchester]] and [[UMIST]]. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed out of the old [[Polytechnic#United Kingdom|polytechnic college]] in the city.

The [[University of Manchester]], [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] and the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] are all grouped together on the southern side of the city centre, and effectively form one large campus along and near to Oxford Road (with the exception of the North Campus of the [[University of Manchester]], which was the [[UMIST]] campus before the merger). [[Manchester Business School]], which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965, forms a part of the University of Manchester.

===Schools===
One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the [[Manchester Grammar School]].  Established in 1515 as a free grammar school next what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1930 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, South Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body.  In the post-war period, it was a direct-grant [[grammar school]] (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by [[Chetham's School of Music]].

==Christianity==
[[Image:StAnnesChurch, Manchester (2002).jpg|thumb|left|St Ann's Church, St Ann's Square]]
The [[Anglican Diocese of Manchester]] was established in 1847.
Manchester has also has an [[Anglican]] [[Manchester Cathedral|cathedral]], St Mary, St George's and St Denys' Cathedral. It was built over a period of 600 years and is built in the Gothic Style.

Manchester lies within the [[Roman Catholic]] '''[[Diocese of Salford]]'''. The oldest surviving Catholic church is [[The Hidden Gem|St Mary's The Hidden Gem]], on Mulberry Street in the city centre. Manchester is in the Central North Division of the [[Salvation Army]].

{{Seealso|Category:Visitor attractions in Greater Manchester}}
===Architecture===
Manchester has a wide variety of buildings mainly from [[Victorian architecture]] through to modern. Much of the architecture in the city harks back to its former days as a global centre for the [[cotton]] trade. Many warehouses have now been converted for other uses but the external appearance remains mostly unchanged so the city keeps much of its original character. An interesting facet of the architecture of Manchester and several other cities which underwent a construction boom during the industrial revolution is that inspiration was taken from [[Venice]]. Examples of this architecture can be easily found to the south and east of Albert Square and near the 92nd lock of the [[Bridgewater Canal]], near Beetham Tower.

Manchester also has a number of [[skyscrapers]].  Most were built during the sixties and seventies.  However, in the last few years there has been a renewed interest in building [[Tallest Buildings of Manchester|skyscrapers in Manchester]].  Numerous residential and office blocks are being built or have recently been built in the city centre. [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]] was completed in the Autumn of 2006 and houses a Hilton hotel along with a restaurant and residential properties.  It is currently the tallest building in the UK outside of London. However, this status may be short lived, an even taller building, the [[Inacity Tower]], is scheduled to commence construction in 2007 behind [[Manchester Piccadilly station]].

===Public monuments===
[[Image:Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Piccadilly Gardens]]]]
Within Manchester there are monuments to numerous people and events that have helped to shape the city and influence the wider community.  There are two large squares that hold many of Manchester's public monuments. There is [[Albert Square, Manchester|Albert Square]] in front of the [[Manchester Town Hall|Town Hall]] which has monuments to [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]], [[James Fraser (bishop)|Bishop James Fraser]], [[Oliver Heywood]], [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and [[John Bright]] , and [[Piccadilly Gardens]] which has monuments dedicated to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], [[Robert Peel]], [[James Watt]] and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].

Notable monuments elsewhere in the city include the [[Alan Turing Memorial]] situated in [[Sackville Park]], adjacent to [[Sackville Street]], which remembers the father of modern computing. A monument to American President [[Abraham Lincoln]] stands in the eponymous Lincoln Square. It is the work of George Gray Barnard and was presented to the city by Mr & Mrs Charles Phelps Taft of Cincinnati, Ohio. The statue marks the part that [[Lancashire]] had to play in the [[cotton famine]] of 1861–1865 and the [[American Civil War]]. Finally, the success of the 2002 Commonwealth Games is commemorated by ''[[B of the Bang]]'', Britain’s tallest sculpture, located near the City of Manchester Stadium in the Eastlands area of the City.

===Streets and plazas===

Manchester has a number of busy squares, plazas and shopping streets. Many of Manchester city centre's streets are now pedestrianised with numerous other streets having [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] or Bus priority, this makes driving around Manchester City Centre complicated.  

One of the oldest thoroughfares is [[Market Street (Manchester, England)|Market Street]]. This was originally called ''Market Stede Lane''. Much of the [[medieval]] street pattern, around the original Market Place was cleared as part of 1970s developments. Ancient streets such as Smithy Door were lost forever. One ancient street to survive is Long Millgate, which led north from the old Market Place. This winding lane, crossing Fennel Street and leading on to Todd Street (formerly Toad Lane - thought to be a corruption of T'owd Lane - The Old Lane) is now an attractive and peaceful thoroughfare, bounded by gardens.

Whitworth Street is a broad 19th century route, stretching from [[Deansgate]] to London Road, running parallel to the [[Rochdale Canal]] for much of its route, and intersecting with Princess Street, Chepstow Street and Albion Street along the way. 
The street is bounded by impressive brick buildings, formerly warehouses, but now mostly residential developments.

Mosley Street runs roughly parallel to Portland Street, Whitworth Street and Deansgate, leading from Piccadilly Gardens to [[St Peter's Square, Manchester|St Peter's Square]]. The street is closed to general traffic, with the [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] running trams along its route.

Another [[Victorian era|Victorian]] addition to the city's street pattern was Corporation Street, which cut through slums to the north of Market Street and provided a direct link from Cross Street (and the newly constructed [[Albert Square, Manchester|Albert Square]]) to the routes north of the city. 

To the south of the city centre, [[Wilmslow Road]] is the hub of much student life and is home to Manchester’s [[curry mile]]. 

Other notable places in Manchester include; Great Northern Square, Spring Gardens, [[Cathedral Gardens]], New Cathedral Street, the Gay Village and Chinatown

==Transport and infrastructure==
{{main|Transport in Manchester}}
Manchester and the surrounding communities in the North West of [[England]] are served by numerous transport facilities. The area is served by an international airport and a major motorway and rail network. Statistically [[Greater Manchester]] has a higher percentage of the motorway network than any other county in the country.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} According to The Guinness Book of World Records{{Fact|date=March 2007}}, it has the most traffic lanes side by side (17), spread across several parallel carriageways ([[M61]] at Linnyshaw Moss, Greater Manchester, close to the [[M60]] interchange). On the local scale the area is served by a network of bus routes and a modern tram system radiates from the city centre.

Historically the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was the first passenger railway in the world.  Today, [[Greater Manchester]] still has an extensive citywide railway network, and two mainline stations. A network of canals also remains from the industrial revolution.

==Culture==
{{Trim}}
{{main|Culture of Manchester}}
===Nightlife===
There has long been a thriving [[nightclub]] culture in Manchester. Broadcaster [[Jimmy Savile]] is credited as becoming the first modern [[DJ]] by using twin turntables for continuous play after he obtained two domestic record decks welded together. He first used this device to play to the public in 1946, at a nightclub called The Ritz on Whitworth Street (which had opened in 1927). Tony Prince is credited as becoming the world's first full-time club DJ in 1964 when Savile, who was then a Mecca manager in Manchester, told him that [[Top Rank]] considered him to be the first person to be on their payroll as a pure DJ.

Many [[teenagers]] of the 1960s developed a love for [[Northern Soul]], which had as two of its epicentres the [[Wigan Casino]] and Manchester's [[Twisted Wheel Club]], and is credited as being instrumental in the development of the [[Motown Sound]].

[[Rob Gretton]], members of [[New Order]] (the band formed from the remaining members of [[Joy Division]] after singer [[Ian Curtis]]' suicide) and [[Factory Records]] boss [[Tony Wilson]] opened Fac 51 [[The Hacienda]] on Whitworth Street in 1982. It quickly became the focus of [[electronic music]] and the start of [[house music]], the [[Madchester]] sound, and the [[Ibiza]] scene, which all came together in the [[Second Summer of Love|Summer of Love]] in 1988. The Hacienda was also at the setting of the 2002 movie [[24 Hour Party People]].

One of the oldest and most diverse venues is the [[Band on the Wall]], a live music venue in the [[Northern Quarter]] area of the city. This venue was built around 1862 as the flagship pub of a local brewery; it was originally called The George & Dragon. It got its nickname in the late 1920s or early 1930s from the stage high on the back wall. In 1975 it was taken on by jazz musician Steve Morris and his business partner Frank Cusick, and renamed The Band on the Wall.

===Music===
====Classical====
Manchester is home to two [[symphony orchestra]]s, the [[Hallé Orchestra]] and the [[BBC Philharmonic Orchestra]]. There is also a [[chamber orchestra]], the Manchester Camerata.

For many years the city’s main classical venue was the [[Free Trade Hall]] on Peter Street. Since 1996, however, Manchester has had a modern 2,500 seat concert venue called the [[Bridgewater Hall]], which is also home to the Hallé Orchestra. The hall is one of the country’s most technically advanced classical music and lecture venues, with an acoustically designed interior and suspended foundations for an optimum sound. Other venues for classical concerts include the [[Royal Northern College of Music|RNCM]], the [[Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester|Royal Exchange Theatre]] and [[Manchester Cathedral]].

Manchester is a centre for musical education, being home to the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] and [[Chetham's School of Music|Chetham’s School of Music]].

In the 1950s the city was home to the so-called ‘Manchester School’ of classical composers, which comprised [[Harrison Birtwistle]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] and [[Alexander Goehr]].

====Pop====
{{main|History of popular music in Manchester|List of bands from Manchester}}
For Mancunians, the pop musical heritage of the city has been a source of great pride.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The city’s eclectic mix of music has helped to create the sense among its inhabitants that Manchester is the most important city in world music.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

[[Image:Better late Oasis.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The world famous band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] who originate from the [[Burnage]] area of Manchester]]

For local groups and bands from Manchester, see [[List of bands from Manchester]]. 

Bands who contributed to the "[[Madchester]]" music scene include:
*[[the Happy Mondays]]
*[[The Charlatans]]
*The [[Inspiral Carpets]]
*[[James (band)|James]]
*[[The Stone Roses]]
*[[Ping Pong Shet Machine]]

[[The Chemical Brothers]] (from southern England) formed in Manchester. Also, ex-[[Stone Roses]] frontman [[Ian Brown]] has forged a successful solo career, as has ex-[[The Smiths|Smiths]] leadman [[Morrissey]]. Among the others born in the [[Greater Manchester]] area are [[Richard Ashcroft]] and [[Jay Kay]]-the singer and mastermind of the acid jazz band Jamiroquai. 

In 1965, on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Hot 100]], a unique hat-trick of consecutive [[Chart-topper|number 1]]s took place in the [[Spring (season)|spring]], all from Mancunian pop groups. [[Freddie and the Dreamers]] spent two weeks at the top with "I'm Telling You Now" (between [[April 10]]–24), [[The Mindbenders|Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders]] one week with "Game of Love" ([[April 24]]-May 1), and finally [[Herman's Hermits]] with "Mrs Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter", a further three weeks ([[May 1]]–22), a total of six weeks, an achievement never matched even in the UK [[Top 50]].

Manchester’s main pop music venue is the [[Manchester Evening News Arena]], situated next to [[Manchester Victoria railway station]], which seats over 21,000 and is the largest arena of its type in [[Europe]], voted ''International Arena of the Year'', beating [[New York City|New York]]’s [[Madison Square Garden]].{{Fact|date=March 2007}} Other major venues include the [[Manchester Apollo]] and the [[Manchester Academy]]. The many smaller venues throughout the city, such as the Bierkeller, the Roadhouse and Night and Day Cafe, ensure that Manchester’s music scene is always vibrant and interesting.

The famous American anti-war hippie [[musical theatre|musical]] from the late [[sixties]], ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', includes a song entitled "Manchester, England" though the mention of the city in the song's title is somewhat irrelevant and merely used as punctuation in the song's lyrics.

===Literature===
In the 19th century, Manchester figured in novels that discussed the changes that industrialisation had brought to Britain. These included works such as:-
*''Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life'' (1848) by [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/gaskell_elizabeth.shtml]
*''The Condition of the English Working Class in 1844'' written by [[Friedrich Engels]] while living and working in Manchester.

[[Charles Dickens]] is reputed to have set his novel ''Hard Times'' in the city, and while it is partly modelled on Preston, it shows the influence of his friend Elizabeth Gaskell [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/pva/pva27.html].

[[Anthony Burgess]], author of ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', was born and educated in Manchester. ''[[Little Wilson and Big God, Being the First Part of the Confessions of Anthony Burgess|Little Wilson and Big God]]'', the first volume of his autobiography, includes a detailed account of his early life in the city between 1917 and 1940.

[[Howard Jacobson]], born in [[Prestwich]], a once predominantly [[Jewish]] neighbourhood of the city, has written about post-war Manchester in ''The Mighty Walzer'' (1999) and ''Kalooki Nights'' (2006).

The Manchester novelist Maurice Procter was an early author of [[police procedural]] novels. Procter's ''Hell is a City'' (1954) is set in a fictionalised Manchester, later filmed in the city with lead roles for [[Donald Pleasence]] and [[Stanley Baker]] [http://www3.telus.net/public/nixonkg/hell_is_a_city.htm]. 

The German writer [[W. G. Sebald]] lived in Manchester when he first settled in England, and the city features prominently in his novel ''The Emigrants.''

The Mancunian [[Jeff Noon]] set his early novels, including [[Vurt]], in a future dystopian Manchester.

Nicholas Blincoe set his first three novels in Manchester, including ''Acid Casuals'' (1995), based around the nightclub [[The Hacienda]] and [[Manchester Slingback]] (1998), focussing on the Gay Village of [[Canal Street]].

The crime novelist [[Val McDermid]] lived in the city for many years and set her Lindsay Gordon series in Manchester.

Carcanet Press, founded as a poetry magazine, began publishing poetry collections and novels in the early 1970s under the editorship of Michael Schmidt [http://www.carcanet.co.uk/about.shtml]. Schmidt was one of the first directors of the [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] Writers School, whose staff currently includes [[Simon Armitage]] and [[Carol Ann Duffy]].

In Manchester is the [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] Writers School, one of the top creative writing schools in the country.

The Writer's Bureau — a private company set up to help new freelance writers through its home-study courses — runs its offices from Manchester.

In Manchester from October 2006 is the Manchester Literature Festival.

[http://www.ManchesterTheatres.com Manchester Theatres] provides a guide to the theatres in the city and its environs.

===Venues===
[[Image:MEN Arena.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[MEN Arena]].]]
As well as many sporting venues Manchester has many venues for performances and conventions:
*[[Manchester Central (Conference Centre)|Manchester Central]]  - Comprising two separate venues formerly known as the ''GMEX Centre'' and ''Manchester International Conference Centre'' (MICC) respectively.
*[[Bridgewater Hall]]
*[[MEN Arena]] - Europe's most capacious indoor arena.
*[[Manchester Academy]]
*[[Manchester Apollo]]

===Sport===
Sport and especially football are an important part of Manchester culture.

Many first class sporting facilities were built for the 2002 [[Commonwealth Games]], including the [[Manchester Velodrome]], the [[City of Manchester Stadium]], the [[National Squash Centre]] and the [[Manchester Aquatics Centre]].

Manchester is a successful sporting city with many famous sporting people heralding from the city as well as from the surrounding area of [[Greater Manchester]]. Manchester has competed twice to host the [[Olympic Games]], being beaten by [[Atlanta]] in 1996 and [[Sydney]] in 2000.

It was announced in 2005 that various sporting arenas around the city will be used as training facilities prior to the [[2012 Olympics]] in London.

====Football====
Two [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] [[football (soccer)|football]] clubs, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], bear the city’s name. Manchester City's ground is at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]]; Manchester United’s [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]] ground, the largest club football ground in England, is just outside the city in the borough of [[Trafford]]. 

It is commonly perceived that Manchester City have more local support than Manchester United. However, research by Manchester Metropolitan University a few years ago showed that United had 9,000 season ticket holders within the [[M postal area]] and City had 7,000. The Manchester postal district includes the (strongly United supporting) city of [[Salford]] but also [[Prestwich]] and [[Whitefield]] (with one of the largest City supporters clubs) and areas such as [[Denton]], where United also have strong support. This research was done before City moved to the (larger, 48,000 capacity) [[City of Manchester Stadium]], and well before the expansion of United's Old Trafford stadium which now accommodates 76,000. The truth is that nobody knows for sure which team has the most local support and that the figures are probably too similar to call. What is beyond doubt is that United's nationwide and international support far exceeds that of City, so City have a larger local proportion of their overall fan base.

[[Image:031658 a83397e7.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Manchester City]]'s [[City of Manchester Stadium]] during the [[Commonwealth games]]]]

Manchester is also important to the history of football. In 1868 a meeting was held in the city for representatives from the UK's football associations, and the [[International Football Association Board]], which makes the rules for the game, was formed following this meeting.

====Rugby football====
Although many of the big rugby teams in the [[North West England|north west of England]] play [[Rugby league|Rugby League]], Manchester's rugby teams have a long tradition by playing [[Rugby union|Rugby Union]].

'''[[Manchester Rugby Club]]''', was founded as the "Manchester Football Club" in 1860, eleven years before the formation of the [[Rugby Football Union]], the club is one of the oldest [[rugby union]] clubs in the world along with [[Blackheath Rugby Club]] and [[Liverpool St Helens F.C.]]. The club's ground is located at Grove Park in [[Cheadle Hulme]], and is divided into different sections - 1st XV, 2nd XV, Warriors, Ladies, and Mini, Juniors, Colts.<ref>[http://www.manchesterrugby.co.uk/ Manchester Rugby Club]</ref> ''See main article: [[Manchester Rugby Club]]''

'''Broughton Park Rugby Union F.C.''', is one of the oldest [[Rugby union|Rugby Union]] Clubs in England and was established in 1882, just one year after the Lancashire County Rugby Union was founded and eleven years after the formation of the national [[Rugby Football Union]]. 
The club has had a number of different grounds in its time, mainly in the Salford/Prestwich area, but also in the south of Manchester. Since 2004 its present new facility is at Hough End in [[Chorlton]], in South Manchester. 
Originally the club had only one senior side, but now fields four senior sides and supported by one Colts (U19), four youth (U13-U17) and four mini (U8-U12) teams; a total involvement of some 220 players each week. 
Broughton Park R.F.C. is the City of Manchester's highest placed representative in the Rugby Union Leagues.<ref>[http://www.broughton-park.org.uk/ Broughton Park Rugby Union F.C.]</ref>

'''Didsbury Toc-H Rugby (Union) Club''' was originally founded in 1924 as "Toc H Manchester" and was situated in Victoria Park. After moving to various sites the club arrived in [[Didsbury]] and in 1986 the name was changed to "Didsbury Toc-H" to identify with the location of the clubhouse. 
The club, which celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2003/2004, is located at Ford Lane in the heart of [[Didsbury]] Village, in the south of Manchester, close to neighbouring areas [[Withington]], [[Fallowfield]], [[Burnage]], and [[Stockport]].
The club fields four teams each week, the 1st team plays in the North Lancashire & Cumbria league, the 2nds, 3rds, and 4ths play in competitive "intermediate leagues". The club also has an established junior section.
The "Toc-H" part comes from a soldiers club at [[Poperinghe]] in [[Flanders]] in the [[First World War]]. Soldiers and officers could get a respite from the battlefields. This place was named Talbot House in honour of a young lieutenant who was killed in action the year before. Signallers pronounced the letters 'T' as 'Toc' and 'H' as 'House'. Today they'd be 'Tango' and 'Hotel'. When the rugby club was founded, Manchester soldiers called the new club as "Toc-H Manchester".<ref>[http://www.didsburyrfc.co.uk/ Didsbury Rugby (Union) Club]</ref>

The City of Manchester has also has other rugby teams: the [[University of Manchester]] Rugby Club,<ref>[http://www.manunirugby.com/ The University of Manchester Rugby Club]</ref> and Manchester Village Spartans RUFC.<ref>[http://www.villagespartans.co.uk/mvsrufc/index.html Manchester Village Spartans RUFC]</ref>

====Cricket====
[[Old Trafford (cricket ground)|Old Trafford]] cricket ground, located in the Metropolitan Borough of [[Trafford]], is the historic home of [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]], which hosts many [[first-class cricket]] and important international matches including Test Matches.

====Other sports====
Belle Vue Stadium in [[Gorton]] is home to the [[Belle Vue Aces]] speedway team and also hosts regular [[greyhound racing|greyhound races]].

Manchester also has an [[ice hockey]] team called the [[Manchester Phoenix]] who moved into a new purpose-built arena called the [[Altrincham Ice Dome]] in February 2007. The city was previously home to the [[Manchester Storm]] ice hockey club who in 1997 played in front of the largest audience ever to watch an ice hockey game in the United Kingdom when 17,245 people saw the Storm defeat the [[Sheffield Steelers]] 6-2 at the [[MEN Arena]].

Manchester also has an Australian Rules Football Club, The Manchester Mosquitoes, who played their first season in the [[BARFL]] in 2006.

===Gay and lesbian===
{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}}
Manchester has claimed to have the UK's largest gay population outside of London,{{Fact|date=March 2007}} and has a self-styled [[Gay Village]]. Centred around the [[Canal Street, Manchester|Canal Street]] area the Gay Village is home to numerous shops, restaurants, bars and clubs. On the last weekend in August it hosts the Manchester Pride Festival (previously known as [[Mardi Gras]] and Gayfest).

Manchester’s gay culture was brought to mainstream attention in 1999 by the acclaimed and controversial [[Channel 4]] drama series ''[[Queer as Folk (UK)|Queer as Folk]]'', which was set in the Village. It is also the birthplace of several gay rights organisations including the [[Campaign for Homosexual Equality]] and the [[Queer Youth Alliance]].{{Fact|date=March 2007}} Manchester has its own gay sports teams, Village Manchester FC ([[soccer]]), Northern Wave ([[swimming]]) and Village Spartans ([[Rugby football|Rugby]]) which take part in Manchester's annual Pride Games.

The year round [http://www.manchesterpride.com/whatson.asp?ID=96 gay and lesbian heritage trail] exhibits Manchester’s gay history. Manchester’s claim to status of "gay capital of the UK" was strengthened in 2003 when it played host city to the annual [[Europride]] festival.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} The Lesbian and Gay Foundation, Britain's biggest gay charity, is based on Princess Street in the city centre.

The Gay Village is often featured on Soaps such as [[Coronation Street]] which is based in nearby [[Salford]]

==Media==
===Television and radio===
{{Seealso|List of television shows set in Manchester}}
[[ITV]] franchisee [[Granada Television]] has its original headquarters on Quay Street in the Castlefield area of the city. The city is where programmes including ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and many [[CiTV|Children’s ITV]] presentations are produced.

The [[BBC]] has its headquarters for the North West in New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road in the south of the city. Programmes including ''[[A Question of Sport]]'', ''[[Mastermind (television)|Mastermind]]'' and ''[[Real Story]]'' are made here. Manchester is also the regional base for the [[BBC One]] North West Region so programmes like ''North West Tonight'' are produced here. The BBC intends to relocate large numbers of staff and facilities to Media City at Salford Quays from London. The Children's([[CBBC]]), Comedy, Sport ([[BBC Sport]]) and New Media departments are all scheduled for a move from London to MediaCity at [[Salford Quays]] before 2010.

Manchester has its own television channel, [[Channel M]], owned by the [[Guardian Media Group]] and operated since 2000. It also has several local radio stations including [[BBC Radio Manchester]], [[Key 103]], [[Galaxy Manchester|Galaxy]], [[Piccadilly Magic 1152]], [[105.4 Century FM]] , [[Smooth FM 100.4|100.4 Smooth FM]], Capital Gold 1458, 96.2 [[The Revolution (radio station)|The Revolution]] and [[Xfm Manchester|Xfm]]. There is a [[community radio]] network coordinated by Radio Regen, and with stations covering the South Manchester communities of [[Ardwick]], [[Longsight]] and [[Levenshulme]] ([[ALL FM]] 96.9) and [[Wythenshawe]] (Wythenshawe FM 97.2)

Several now defunct radio stations are much lamented including Sunset (which became) [[Kiss 102]] (now [[Galaxy]]), and KFM which became Signal Cheshire (now [[Signal 1]]). The latter three played a significant role in the city's emerging [[House music]] culture, also known as the [[Madchester]] scene, which was partly based around clubs like the [[the Hacienda]] which had its own show on Kiss 102. There were also scores of [[pirate radio]], [[Campus radio|student radio]] (currently consisting of Fuse FM at the [[University of Manchester]] and Shock FM at the University of Salford) and [[community radio]] stations and initiatives in Manchester.

[[BBC Radio Manchester]], which became BBC GMR in 1988, returned to its former title in 2006.

The character of [[Daphne Moon]] in ''[[Frasier]]'' (the role which eventually made [[Jane Leeves]] the highest-paid British actress on television) came from Manchester.

The hit television series ''[[Life on Mars (TV series)|Life on Mars]]'' is based in a 1973 Manchester.

===Film===
{{Seealso|Films set in Manchester}}
Manchester is home to the Manchester film festival and has held the commonwealth film festival.

Even [[Hollywood]] has featured Manchester occasionally in its films. ''My Son, My Son!'', made in 1940, directed by [[Charles Vidor]] and starring [[Brian Aherne]] and [[Louis Hayward]], is set in Manchester, and in [[MGM]]'s all-star opus of 1932, ''[[Grand Hotel (film)|Grand Hotel]]'', most of [[Wallace Beery]]'s dialogue seems to consist of him furiously shouting "Manchester!" throughout his entire part. Manchester over the years has shot many films from the [[Ewan McGregor]] blockbuster ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]'' to [[Sir Alec Guinness]]'s ''[[The Man in the White Suit]]''.

===Magazines and newspapers===
''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper was founded in Manchester in 1821 as ''The Manchester Guardian''. Its head office is still in Manchester, though many of its management functions were moved to [[London]] in 1964. It still shares a Manchester office on Hardman Street with its sister publication, the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', Manchester’s biggest-selling daily paper now free within the city centre, and Greater Manchester's biggest-circulation newspaper, the free weekly Manchester Metro News. The other free commuting paper is [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] North West, available from [[Metrolink]] stops, rail stations and other busy locations across the city at rush-hour.

For many years most of the national newspapers had important offices in Manchester: ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[Daily Express]]'', ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''. Only ''[[The Daily Sport]]'' remain based in Manchester. At its height 1,500 journalists were employed. But in the 1980s office closures began and today the "second Fleet Street" is no more. A late attempt to launch a Northern daily newspaper, ''North West Times'', floundered in the late 80s lasting just three months. Another attempt was made with the [[North West Enquirer]], which was Manchester based and hoped to provide a true "regional" newspaper for the [[North West England|North West]], much in the same vein as the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' does for [[Yorkshire]] or ''[[The Northern Echo]]'' does for the [[North East England|North East]]. It folded in October 2006.

There are several local lifestyle magazines, including 'YQ Magazine' and 'Moving Manchester' amongst others.
