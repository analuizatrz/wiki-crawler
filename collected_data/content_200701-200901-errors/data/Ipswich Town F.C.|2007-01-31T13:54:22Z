'''Ipswich Town Football Club''' is the professional [[football (soccer)|football]] club of [[Ipswich|Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]]. Popularly known as the ''Blues'' for the colour of their jerseys, or ''Town'' for short. The horse in the club's crest is a [[Suffolk Punch]]. A recent nickname for Town is "The Tractor Boys", developed when the club enjoyed brief success in the Premiership during the 2000-01 season against more fashionable clubs. The nickname was often sung back at opposing fans with irony at their mocking of Ipswich's agricultural roots. Ipswich Town's history - particularly under manager Bobby Robson in the 1970s and early 80's - arguably places them as one of the most successful clubs in the country relative to the small size of the town from which they hailed: for a decade the club from a small backwater in East Anglia competed with the very best in the country and Europe.  However, the club's glory years seem some way away from the current position of financial hardship after administration in 2002-03 and failure to secure promotion and with the club forced to sell its best players, the future looks uncertain.

Ipswich currently play in the [[Football League Championship]], the second tier of English football after the [[FA Premier League]]. They have had several spells in the Premiership, the most recent being between 2000 and 2002, whilst under [[George Burley]]. Under Burley's successor, [[Joe Royle]], Ipswich twice reached the promotion playoffs, only to lose both times in the semi-finals to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. After finishing the 2005/06 season in 15th place in the championship,  Royle resigned as manager on [[11 May]] 2006 and former club and Northern Ireland captain [[Jim Magilton]] was appointed as manager on [[5 June]] 2006 with former academy director Bryan Klug assisting as first team coach. The club is currently going through a major rebuilding process and is at is weakest point for many years, not least because of serious financial problems off the pitch.

The club's main local rival is [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. When the two teams meet it is known as the '[[East Anglian Derby]]', or, informally, as the 'Old Farm Derby', a comic reference to the name given to football matches between [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in [[Scotland]]. Although in recent years, the two clubs have been more evenly matched, with each spending periods in the top tier of the English league whilst the other remained in the division below, it is Ipswich Town who have enjoyed the more successful and glamourous history: providing two England managers (Alf Ramsey and Bobby Robson) and winning the Football League (1961-62), FA Cup (1977-78) and UEFA Cup (1980-81) in addition to coming runners up twice to the Football League champions, in 1980-81 and 81-82 respectively.

Indeed, Ipswich have launched the careers of two England managers. Alf Ramsey guided Ipswich to the first division title in their first season as a top division team (1961-62). Bobby Robson took Ipswich to an F.A Cup win in 1978 and UEFA Cup victory three years later, as well as achieving second place in the league on two occasions. He then went on to manage England in the 1986 and 1990 World Cups, taking England to a Semi Final spot in the latter. In some respect, it is thought that Ipswich has supplied England with two of the most successful managers in its long footballing history.

Ipswich's last spell in the top division ended in relegation after two seasons, but the first season of this short-lived spell at the top yielded a fifth place finish in the Premiership and qualification for the [[UEFA Cup]]. As an added bonus, manager George Burley was voted Manager of the Year by his counterparts for his achievement with newly promoted Ipswich, and, upon their relegation, Ipswich were awarded a place in the qualifying round of the UEFA Cup via the 'Fair Play Award'. 

A nickname which is popular for Town is 'The Tractor Boys'; a name linked of course to the town's agricultural history. The nickname originally applied to near neighbours Norwich City, and was first heard in the 1970s but soon fell into disuse. Although there is a certain amount of controversy surrounding this, the first generally-accepted use of the nickname appeared at a losing away game at Birmingham City late in the 1998/99 season, with the home fans chanting "no noise from the Tractor Boys", a name which stuck. Barracking by the so-called larger clubs during Town's entry into the Premiership lent the ironic chant: '1-0 to the Tractor Boys' increased potency and publicity, and the nickname was eagerly snapped up by the media. Another possible reason for reviving this old nickname coincided with Suffolk pub team, Earl Soham Victoria, winning the Carlsberg Pub Cup Final in 2000. The nickname was adopted by Victoria and was chanted by 2,000 followers at the Wembley final in which they were triumphant. A few of these supporters, also Ipswich fans, then began to chant this at Portman Road. Town manager Jim Magilton once commented in the local press that he disliked the nickname, saying that it conjured up, "images of carrot-crunching yokels";{{fact}}  it appeared that he was unaware of why the most vociferous of Town fans were referring to themselves as such.

As that season progressed, and Town surprised everyone by remaining close to the very top of the table, Town merchandise began to include the nickname. Car stickers reading "...ploughing up the Premier League" were very popular amongst some fans. Other fans remain mildly embarrassed at the nickname and its connotations, because they consider the agricultural reference to be disparaging. The popularity of the chants/nickname, and the reason for its sudden spread, is probably due to the fact that it is otherwise inoffensive. This meant that whole families could join in the chant all around the ground, and put related stickers in their car windows.

However, with the club's relegation from the Premiership in the 2001-02 season and subesquent decline, the "Tractor Boys" chant is rarely heard. 

==The Rise of Ipswich Town (1960 onwards)==
===The Alf Ramsey era: Instant success===
Ipswich Town won promotion to the First Division for the first time in its history on winning the Second Division Championship at the end of the 1960-61 season (having entered the league in the Third Division South in the 1938-39 season) under Alf Ramsey. Ipswich's first top division season was an enormous success, winning the First Division Championship and qualifying for the European Cup at the end of an excellent 1961-62 season.This was arguably the most remarkable League Championship win in its history, as Ipswich were all but condemned to relegation by virtually all football pundits and journalists at that time.But Alf Ramsey's tactical astuteness, working with a squad of solid but not outstanding players, baffled and astonished the illustrious football clubs involved to produce the would be impossible task of actually winning the league title in Ipswich's first ever season in the top flight. But Ramsey quit the club soon afterwards to take charge of the England team and his [[1966 World Cup]] success would gain himself a knighthood and a place in the book of footballing greats. After Ramsey took the England job in 1963 he was replaced at Ipswich By Jackie Milburn.

===The Jackie Milburn era: Sudden slump===
Under Jackie Milburn Ipswich's fortunes on the pitch plummeted, slipping down to the Second Division in 1964, just two years after winning the league title, conceding a top division record of 121 league goals in 42 games. Milburn quit after just one full season and was replaced by Bill McGarry in 1964.

===The Bill McGarry era: The comeback===
The club remained in the Second Division for four years until Bill McGarry finally guided Ipswich to promotion in the 1967-68 season. McGarry quit to manage [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] and in January 1969 was replaced by Bobby Robson.

===The Bobby Robson era: Chasing success===
It took a while for Bobby Robson to establish himself at Ipswich. His first two seasons were a case of staying up. However, this marked the most illustrious period in the club's history, winning two major trophies, enjoying several seasons in top flight European football, producing a team full of international players and playing some very attractive football. From finishing 18th and 19th (from 22) in his first two seasons he then managed to push up the table finishing 13th in 1972, and in 1973 Ipswich finished 4th, qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]] for the first time, won the [[Texaco Cup]] and secured the [[FA Youth Cup]]. Ipswich became a regular feature in the top five of the league and in the UEFA Cup, again winning the Youth Cup in 1975.

Bobby Robson gained Ipswich Town's first [[FA Cup]] success in [[FA Cup Final 1978|1978]] with a victory over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Wembley Stadium]], and more success came with a UEFA Cup victory in 1981 and runners-up finish in the league in 1981 and 1982. Key players of this era included [[Frans Thijssen]], [[Arnold Muhren]], [[Kevin Beattie]], [[John Wark]] and [[Paul Mariner]]. Robson left Ipswich in the summer of 1982 to take charge of the England team and was replaced by his assistant Bobby Ferguson. The club has never repeated the success of the Robson years.

===The Bobby Ferguson era: Decline ===
Bobby Ferguson's transition from coach to manager was not an easy one. This, combined with financial restraints following a new stand being built meant that Town could only manage to finish mid-table for a couple of seasons, then spend a season struggling followed by relegation a year later. Ferguson resigned a year later after losing to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in the old [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] play-offs.

===The John Duncan era: Standstill===
From 1986 to 1990, Ipswich Town were managed by John Duncan and gained themselves a reputation as a competent Second Division side, but they never really looked like gaining promotion. For a club with such a proud history, the Ipswich Town directors decided that the team's form under John Duncan had been unsatisfactory and he was sacked at the end of the 1989-1990 season. He was replaced by John Lyall, whose 14-year reign as West Ham United manager had ended the previous summer&mdash;during that time the Hammers had won the FA Cup twice and finished third in the league.

===The John Lyall era: Promotion===
John Lyall guided Ipswich to a mid table finish in the 1990-1991 [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] campaign but the following season saw them crowned champions of the Second Division and gain promotion to the new [[FA Premier League]], ready for the 1992-1993 season. 

Defender [[John Wark]] had returned to Ipswich after a spell at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], while Ipswich's key players included the ever reliable [[Mick Stockwell]] (who played in every position other than [[goalkeeper]]), [[Canadian]] international duo goalkeeper [[Craig Forrest]] and full back [[Frank Yallop]], Welsh international midfielder [[Geraint Williams]] and Bulgarian striker [[Bontcho Guentchev]] as well as talented youngsters such as [[Jason Dozzell]] and [[Chris Kiwomya]]. 

After enjoying the longest unbeaten start of any Premier League side, Ipswich were fourth in the Premier League come January 1993, with a [[UEFA Cup]] place looking possible - there was even talk of a league title triumph. But a dip in form during the final weeks of the season saw Ipswich finish a disappointing 16th in the first ever Premier League.

Lyall added several more players to the Ipswich squad, including [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham]] [[striker]] [[Ian Marshall]] and the [[Danish people|Danish]] attacking [[midfielder]] [[Claus Thomsen]]. These acquisitions looked to have had a positive effect on Ipswich's playing fortunes, as they made a good start to the 1993-1994 Premier League campaign. But the final weeks of the season saw a slump and Ipswich only avoided relegation when [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] suffered a last-gasp 3-2 defeat at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on the final day of the season.

Lyall was sacked as Ipswich manager in December 1994 with the club rooted to the bottom of the Premiership. His successor [[George Burley]] was unable to turn things around and the writing was on the wall following a humiliating 9-0 defeat at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in early March, it is the heaviest ever defeat experienced by any team in a Premiership match. Relegation was confirmed soon afterwards and Ipswich ended the season having conceded 92 goals in 42 league games - the second worst-ever defensive record of any Premiership club.

===The George Burley era: Down... up at last... then down again===
George Burley arrived too late to keep Ipswich Town in the Premiership, but he was intent on getting them back up. In 1995-1996, Ipswich fell one place short of the Division playoff zone, while the next three seasons brought semi-final playoff defeats.

By now, the likes of [[John Wark]], [[Craig Forrest]], [[Bontcho Guentchev]] and [[Claus Thomsen]] had long left the club. A new set of players had arrived and given Ipswich a reputation for playing attractive, high quality football. These players included [[goalkeeper]] [[Richard Wright (footballer)|Richard Wright]], [[Defender (football)|defender]] [[Titus Bramble]], [[midfielder]] [[Kieron Dyer]], [[midfielder]]/[[striker]] [[James Scowcroft]], [[Winger (football)|winger]] [[Martijn Reuser]], [[striker]] [[Marcus Stewart]] and veteran [[Defender (football)|defender]]s [[Tony Mowbray]] and [[Mark Venus]]. 

Ipswich finally returned to the Premiership in 2000 after coming from behind to beat [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] 4-2 in the last [[Football League First Division|Division One]] playoff final at [[Wembley Stadium]] before the old stadium was to be redeveloped. Most observers expected Ipswich to suffer relegation from the Premiership in their first season back at this level, but George Burley's hardworking side defied the odds and finished in an impressive fifth place&mdash;being pipped by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on the last day of the season for a place in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]  - gaining themselves a UEFA Cup place instead, and earning George Burley the Manager of the Year Award. 

In the following season's UEFA Cup, Ipswich played [[Torpedo Moscow]] in the first round and won 3-2 on aggregate. After a goalless draw with [[Helsingborgs IF]] in the first leg, they won 3-1 in the second. Ipswich beat [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Inter Milan]] 1-0 at home in round 3 with a headed goal from [[Alun Armstrong]], but lost the tie over two legs after a 4-1 defeat in Italy. However, their League form was the real cause for concern; 18 games into the 2001-02 Premiership campaign, Ipswich were bottom of the table with just one league victory and their top division days were looking numbered. Then George Burley's side climbed to 12th place with seven wins from eight fixtures which appeared to have saved them from relegation. But another decline set in and this time Ipswich were unable to halt it. Their fate was confirmed on the final day of the season with a 5-0 defeat away to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. This maintained the record that no team that was bottom of the Premiership on [[Christmas Day]] would stay up that season. This remained the case until [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] survived the drop a few seasons later.

The loss of income due to relegation led to the club going into [[Administration of an insolvent business|financial administration]]. They had the minor consolation of again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, this time via UEFA's Fair Play route, and became the first lower-level team to survive two ties in the same UEFA Cup (losing in the second round proper). A poor start to the season, culminating in a 2-0 defeat at [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] meant that George Burley was sacked in October 2002 after nearly eight years as manager of Ipswich Town. First team coach [[Tony Mowbray]] was given four games as caretaker mananger, winning once, but he was ultimately replaced as manager by the former [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager [[Joe Royle]], whose managerial career had so far yielded four promotions and one FA Cup victory.

During this period, the stands at each end had been rebuilt, increasing capacity to over 30,000.

===The Joe Royle era: The exodus===
When Joe Royle became Ipswich manager, the club was struggling near the Division One relegation zone and following a revival after a change in management just missed the playoffs. The 2003/2004 season saw the club come out of administration and continue to challenge for promotion back to the Premier League. They finished that season in fifth, but were knocked out of the playoff semi finals by [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 2-1 on aggregate.

Despite missing automatic promotion in 2004-2005 (Ipswich finished 3rd with 85pts, only two short of 2nd-placed [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] with 87pts) Joe Royle tried to achieve his fifth promotion success as a manager through the play offs&mdash;he won promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1983 and [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1991 with [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], as well as getting [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] to the [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] in 2000 after two straight promotions. However, Ipswich lost to West Ham United again in the play-off semi-finals. Despite fighting back from 2-0 down in the first leg to draw 2-2 at Upton Park, they lost 2-0 in the return leg at Portman Road, continuing their unenviable record in the end of season lottery.

2005-06 saw a campaign plagued by injuries and pre-season promotion favourites Ipswich finished a disappointing 15th - the club's lowest finish since 1966<ref name="Pride Of Anglia">{{cite web | title=Pride Of Anglia | work= Plymouth 2 - 1 Ipswich (April 30 2006 match report) | url= http://www.prideofanglia.com/sql/match_report.phtml?day=30&month=4&year=2006&sequence=0 | accessdate=August 29 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> &mdash;having never looked serious contenders for the play-offs.  Joe Royle resigned by mutual consent on [[11 May]], 2006.

Joe Royle's period as Ipswich manager will be best remembered for his ability to bring the best out of inexperienced and perhaps fairly mediocre players during an era of wage bill reductions and other cost cutting measures.  The Premiership wage bill was slashed from around £20m to under £5m and the higher earners were the first to leave, such as [[Pablo Couñago]], [[Matteo Sereni]], [[Marcus Bent]], [[Martijn Reuser]], [[Matt Holland]], [[Jamie Clapham]], [[Chris Makin]] and [[Hermann Hreiðarsson]]. [[Darren Ambrose]] also departed in this era during desperate attempts to replace lost income. Other major players, largely developed during their time with Ipswich, left at the end of the 2004/05 season when automatic promotion was missed by three points. This was partly to balance the books, as was the case with the sale of [[Darren Bent]] to Charlton and [[Kelvin Davis]] to Sunderland, but others wished to realise their Premiership ambitions, such as [[Shefki Kuqi]] and [[Tommy Miller]], whose contracts had ended.

===The Jim Magilton era: A new hope===
:''For the current season statistics, see [[2006-07 season for Ipswich Town F.C.]]''

On [[5 June]], 2006 at a press conference, Jim Magilton was officially unveiled as the new manager and former Academy Director [[Bryan Klug]], who coached and helped develop players such as [[Owen Garvan]], [[Kieron Dyer]], [[Darren Ambrose]], [[Richard Wright]], [[Darren Bent]] [[Titus Bramble]] and [[Billy Clarke]] was appointed to assist as first team coach.

At the start of the 2006-07 season, many predicted a poor league finish for the club, the likes of the [[News of the World]] stating that Ipswich Town would only manage 19th place in the Championship due to lack of transfer activity and the inexperience of the new manager.{{fact}}

Magilton started his management career with 3 straight defeats. This was followed by a first round defeat in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] at the hands of [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough]]. His first win as a manager came in a 3-1 away win at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] with a promising display before recording consecutive 2-1 victories over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Coventry City]].

With a new man in charge there has been cautious optimism from the Town fans.  Positive signs have included a fantastic team performance in the 3-1 victory against the old enemy Norwich who were out played by a young and mobile Ipswich Town team.

It is also during the Jim Magilton era when Sir Bobby Robson pledged his loyalty to the club by agreeing to become their president, an act which was met with great pleasure and grattitude form all Ipswich Town fans. 

With sections of the club's support seeing the last decade as been the most turbulent in the club's history, with constant fluctuation in the club's fortunes many fans appear prepared to settle for a period of steady progress and good, passing football. Their current position of 14th in the Championship places them halfway between the playoff and relegation zones as of [[2 January]] [[2007]].

==John Wark==

John Wark had three spells at Ipswich - the first being in 1975 during Ipswich's most successful period - and he became a hit with the Town fans.

In 1984, like many players, he left Portman Road and was snapped up by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He then went back to Town in 1987 before leaving to join [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in 1990. Finally, he returned twelve months later.

To prolong his career in its latter stages, he moved to centre back. He hung up his boots in 1997.
