The '''1994 San Marino Grand Prix''' was a [[Formula One]] motor race held on [[May 1]], [[1994]] at the [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari]] in [[Imola]], [[Italy]]. It was the third race of the [[1994 Formula One season]], and the first race of the season to be held in [[Europe]]. The race weekend was marred by the deaths of Austrian [[Roland Ratzenberger]] and three-time world champion [[Ayrton Senna]] as well as numerous other accidents and injuries, and was described by [[BBC Television]] commentator [[Murray Walker]] as "the blackest day for Grand Prix racing that I can remember".<ref name="BBConthisday">{{cite news | title = Race ace Senna killed in car crash | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/1/newsid_2479000/2479971.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 1994-05-01 | accessdate = 2006-10-28}}</ref>

[[Michael Schumacher]] eventually won the race. In the [[press conference]] following the race, Schumacher said that he "couldn't feel satisfied, couldn't feel happy" with his win following the events that had occurred during the race weekend. [[Nicola Larini]] scored the first points of his career when he obtained a podium finish in second position. [[Mika Häkkinen]] finished third.

The race led to an increased emphasis on safety in the sport. It led to the reforming of the [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association]] after a 12-year hiatus, and the changing of many track layouts and car designs. Since the race, numerous regulation changes have been made to slow Formula One cars down and new [[Race track|circuits]], such as [[Bahrain International Circuit]], incorporate large run-off areas to slow cars before they collide with a wall. The [[HANS device]], a piece of equipment that provides head and neck support in the event of an accident, has since become mandatory.

Senna was given a [[state funeral]] in his home country of [[Brazil]], where around 500,000 people lined the streets to watch the coffin pass. Italian prosecutors charged six people with manslaughter in connection with [[Death of Ayrton Senna|Senna's death]], all of whom were later acquitted. The case took more than 11 years to conclude due to an appeal and a retrial following the original not guilty verdict.

====Friday Qualifying====

On Friday, [[April 29]], during the first qualifying session to determine the starting order for the race,<ref>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Longmore | title = Ayrton Senna: The Last Hours | url = http://www.cstudio.net/may194.html | work = The Times | publisher = News International | date = 1994-10-31 | accessdate = 2006-10-28}}</ref> [[Rubens Barrichello]]'s Jordan car hit a kerb at the ''Variante Bassa'' corner at 140&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (225&nbsp;[[Kilometres per hour|km/h]]), launching him into the air.<ref name="hamiltonbook">{{cite book | last = Hamilton | first = Maurice | authorlink = | coauthors = | editor = | others = | title = Frank Williams | accessdate = | edition = | date = | publisher = Macmillan | location = | id = ISBN 0-333-71716-3 | pages = 232}}</ref> He hit the top of the tyre barrier, and was knocked unconscious. His Jordan rolled several times after landing before coming to rest upside down. Medical teams treated him at the crash site, and he was taken to the medical centre. He returned to the race meeting the next day, although his broken nose and a plaster cast on his arm forced him to sit out the rest of the race weekend. Ten years after the incident, [[Damon Hill]], who drove for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams-Renault]] team at the time, described the feeling after the crash: "We all brushed ourselves off and carried on qualifying, reassured that our cars were tough as tanks and we could be shaken but not hurt."<ref name="damonhill">{{cite news | first = Damon | last = Hill | title = Had Ayrton foreseen his death? | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,12771-1077121,00.html | work = The Times | publisher = News International | date = 2004-04-17 | accessdate = 2006-10-28}}</ref>

====Saturday Qualifying====
Twenty minutes into the final qualifying session, [[Roland Ratzenberger]] failed to negotiate the ''Villeneuve curva'' and his [[Simtek]] hit the opposing concrete barrier wall almost head-on. Although the survival cell remained largely intact, the force of the impact inflicted a [[basal skull fracture]]. Ratzenberger, in his first season as a Formula One driver, had run over a kerb at the ''Acque Minerali'' chicane on his previous lap, the impact of which is believed to have damaged his front wing. Rather than return to the pitlane, he continued on another fast lap. Travelling at 190&nbsp;mph (306&nbsp;km/h) his car suffered a front wing failure leaving him unable to control it.<ref name="herald">{{cite news | first = Brad | last = Spurgeon | title = 5 Years After Senna's Crash, Racing Is Safer — Some Say Too Safe: Imola Still Haunts Formula One | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/04/30/prix.2.t_1.php | work = International Herald Tribune | date = 1999-04-30 | accessdate = 2007-05-01}}</ref>

[[Image:Circuit Imola 1992 Villeneuve.png|150px|thumb|left|Villeneuve curva, the location of Ratzenberger's crash]]
The session was stopped and the remaining 40 minutes were eventually cancelled.<ref name="damonhill" /><ref name="hamiltonbook"/> Later in hospital it was announced that Ratzenberger had succumbed to his multiple injuries. His death marked the first Formula One race weekend fatality since the [[1982 Canadian Grand Prix]] when [[Riccardo Paletti]] was killed. It had been eight years since [[Elio de Angelis]] died testing a [[Brabham]] car at the [[Paul Ricard]] circuit. Professor [[Sid Watkins]], then head of the Formula One on-track medical team, recalled in his memoirs [[Ayrton Senna]]'s reaction to the news, stating that "Ayrton broke down and cried on my shoulder".<ref name="Hamilton234">{{cite book | last = Hamilton | first = Maurice | authorlink = | coauthors = | editor = | others = | title = Frank Williams | accessdate = | edition = | date = | publisher = Macmillan | location = | id = ISBN 0-333-71716-3 | pages = 234}}</ref> Watkins tried to persuade Senna not to race the following day, asking "What else do you need to do? You have been world champion three times, you are obviously the quickest driver. Give it up and let's go fishing", but Ayrton was insistent, saying, "Sid, there are certain things over which we have no control. I cannot quit, I have to go on."<ref name="Hamilton234" />

Senna had qualified on [[pole position]], ahead of championship leader [[Michael Schumacher]]. [[Gerhard Berger]] qualified in 3rd, and Senna's team-mate [[Damon Hill]] started from fourth position. A time posted by Ratzenberger before his fatal crash would have been sufficient for entry into the race starting from the 26th and final position on the grid.

==== First Start ====
{{main|Death of Ayrton Senna}}

[[Image:Senna imola89.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The death of three-time world champion [[Ayrton Senna]] during the race permanently changed the sport.]]

At the start of the race, [[J.J. Lehto]] stalled his Benetton on the grid. [[Pedro Lamy]], starting from further back on the grid, had his view of the stationary Benetton blocked by other cars and hit the back of Lehto's car, causing bodywork and tyres to fly into the air. Parts of the car went over the safety fencing designed to protect spectators at the startline causing minor injuries to nine people.<ref name="Times tragic">{{cite news | title = A tragic weekend | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,12771-1079325,00.html | work = The Times | publisher = News International | date = 2004-04-19 | accessdate = 2006-10-28}}</ref> The incident caused the [[safety car]] to be deployed, with all the remaining competitors holding position behind it while travelling at a reduced speed. During this period, as a result of travelling at slower speeds, tyre temperatures dropped. At the drivers' briefing before the race, Senna, along with [[Gerhard Berger]], had expressed concern that the safety car did not go fast enough to keep tyre temperatures high.<ref name="Times tragic"/> Once the track was reported clear of debris, the safety car was withdrawn and the race restarted with a [[rolling start]]. Two laps after the restart, with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher, Senna's car left the road at the ''Tamburello corner'', and after slowing from 190&nbsp;mph (306&nbsp;km/h) to 131&nbsp;mph (211&nbsp;km/h), hit the concrete wall.

[[Image:Senna accident.jpg|thumb|right|Senna's Williams hits the wall at Tamburello.]]

At 2:17 p.m. local time, a red flag was shown to indicate the race was stopped and [[Sid Watkins]] arrived at the scene to treat Senna. When a race is stopped under a red flag cars must slow down and make their way back into the pit lane until further notice. This protects [[Marshal#Racing and other competitions|race marshals]] and medical staff at the crash scene, and allows easier access for medical cars to the incident. The [[Larrousse]] team mistakenly<ref name="autosport">{{cite news | first = | last = | title =TITLE REQUIRED | work = Autosport | publisher = | pages = | page = | date = 1994-05-05 | accessdate = }}</ref> allowed one of their drivers, [[Érik Comas]], to leave the pits despite the circuit being closed under red flags. Marshals frantically waved him down as he approached the scene of the accident travelling at "pretty much full speed".<ref name="Eurosport">{{cite video | people =Watson, John (Commentator) | year = 1994 | title = Eurosport Live Grand Prix | medium = Television | location = | publisher =Eurosport}}</ref> Eurosport commentator John Watson described the incident as "the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen at any time in my life".<ref name="Eurosport" /> Comas avoided hitting any of the people or cars that were on the circuit but after going over towards Senna's accident scene, he was so distressed at what he saw that he withdrew from the race. The pictures shown of Senna being treated on the world feed (supplied by host broadcaster [[RAI]]) were very graphic, and the BBC switched to their own camera focused on the pit lane.<ref>{{cite news | first = Roger | last = Horton | title = There's Something about Murray | url = http://atlasf1.autosport.com/2000/dec20/horton.html | work = Autosport | publisher = | date = 2000 | accessdate = 2006-10-28}}</ref> Senna was lifted from the wrecked Williams and airlifted to Maggiore Hospital in nearby [[Bologna]]. Medical teams continued to treat him during the flight. Thirty-seven minutes after the crash, at 2:55 p.m. local time, the race was restarted.

==== Second Start ====
The results of the restarted race would be determined by the aggregate results of the aborted first race and the second race. From the restart, Gerhard Berger took the lead on track but Schumacher still led the race overall due to the amount of time he was ahead of Berger before the race was stopped. Schumacher took the lead on track on lap 12, and four laps later, Berger retired from the race with handling problems. Larini briefly took the lead as Schumacher [[Pit stop|pitted]] but the order was restored when Larini took his own pit stop.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr551.html| title = Grand Prix Results: San Marino GP, 1994| accessdate = 2006-10-28| date = | work = GP Encyclopedia| publisher = www.grandprix.com}}</ref>

Ten laps from the finish the rear-right wheel came loose from [[Michele Alboreto]]'s Minardi as it left the pit lane, striking two Ferrari and two Lotus mechanics, who were left needing hospital treatment.<ref>{{cite video | people = Rider, Steve (Presenter) | year = 1994 | title = San Marino Grand Prix | medium = Television | location = London, United Kingdom | publisher =BBC}}</ref>

Michael Schumacher won the race ahead of Nicola Larini and Mika Häkkinen, giving him a maximum 30 points after 3 rounds of the [[1994 Formula One season]]. It was the only podium finish of Larini's career, and the first of just two occasions when he obtained world championship points. At the podium ceremony, out of respect for Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna, no champagne was sprayed.

=== Post-Race ===
Two hours and 20 minutes after Schumacher crossed the finish line, at 6:40 p.m. local time, Dr. Maria Teresa Fiandri announced that Ayrton Senna had died. The official time of death was given, however, as 2:17 p.m. local time, meaning that Senna had been killed instantly.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ayrton-senna.com/s-files/newsfle5.html | title = Secrets of Senna's black box| accessdate = 2006-10-28| date = 1997-03-18| work = Senna Files| publisher = www.ayrton-senna.com}}</ref> The cause of death established by an autopsy is that a piece of the car's suspension pierced his helmet and skull.<ref>{{cite news | first = Ian | last = Thomsen | title = Williams Says Italy May Cite Steering In Senna's Death | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/1995/02/11/prix_0.php | work = International Herald Tribune | publisher = | date = 1995-02-11| accessdate = 2006-10-28

The 1994 Imola layout, which had been in place since 1981,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gpracing.net192.com/circuits/45.cfm| title = Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari - Imola| accessdate = 2006-10-28 | date = | work = | publisher = www.gpracing.net192.com}}</ref> was never again used for a Formula One race. The circuit was heavily modified following the race, including a change at Tamburello—also the scene of major accidents for [[Gerhard Berger]] ([[1989 San Marino Grand Prix|1989]]) and [[Nelson Piquet]] ([[1987 San Marino Grand Prix|1987]])—from a high speed corner to a much slower [[chicane]]. The FIA also changed the regulations governing Formula One car design, to the extent that the 1995 regulations required all teams to create completely new designs, as their 1994 cars could not be adapted to them.<ref>{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Wright | title = Preview of 1995 Formula1 Cars | url = http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00187.htm | work = | publisher = www.grandprix.com | date = 1995 | accessdate = 2006-10-28}}</ref> The concern raised at the drivers briefing the morning of the race, by Senna and Berger, would lead to the [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association]] reforming at the following race, the [[1994 Monaco Grand Prix]]. The GPDA, which was originally founded in 1961, had previously disbanded in 1982. The primary purpose of it reforming was to allow drivers to discuss safety issues with a view to improve standards following the incidents at Imola. The front two grid slots at the Monaco Grand Prix that year, which were painted with Brazilian and Austrian flags, were left clear in memory of the two drivers who had lost their lives. Additionally, a minute of silence was observed before the race.

Senna was given a [[state funeral]] in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]] on [[May 5]] [[1994]]. Approximately 500,000 people lined the streets to watch the coffin pass.<ref name="BBConthisday"/> Senna's rival [[Alain Prost]] was among the pallbearers.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gpracing.net192.com/drivers/prost-senna.cfm| title = Open Warfare| accessdate = 2006-10-28| date = | work = | publisher = www.gpracing.net192.com}}</ref> The majority of the Formula One community attended Senna's funeral; however the president of the sport's governing body, the FIA, [[Max Mosley]] attended the funeral of Ratzenberger instead which took place on [[May 7]] [[1994]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Track Topics | author = David Tremayne, Mark Skewis, Stuart Williams, Paul Fearnley | work = Motoring News | publisher = News Publications Ltd. | date = 1994-04-05}}</ref> Mosley said in a press conference ten years later, "I went to his funeral because everyone went to Senna's.

==Trial==
Italian prosecutors brought legal proceedings against six people in connection with [[Death of Ayrton Senna|Senna's death]]. They were [[Frank Williams]], [[Patrick Head]] and [[Adrian Newey]] of [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]; Fedrico Bendinelli representing the owners of the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari; Giorgio Poggi as the circuit director and Roland Bruynserarde who was race director and sanctioned the circuit.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hamilton | first = Maurice | authorlink = | coauthors = | editor = | others = | title = Frank Williams | accessdate = | edition = | date = | publisher = Macmillan | location = | id = ISBN 0-333-71716-3 | pages = 276}}</ref> The trial verdict was given on [[December 16]] [[1997]], clearing all six defendants of manslaughter charges.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.ayrton-senna.com/s-files/newsfl10.html | title =All six cleared in Senna trial | accessdate = 2006-10-28| date =1997-12-16 | work = Senna Files| publisher = www.ayrton-senna.com}}</ref> The cause of Senna's accident was established by the court as the steering column breaking.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.ayrton-senna.com/s-files/trialidx.html | title =Faulty Steering Caused Crash!| accessdate = 2006-10-28| date = |work = Senna Files| publisher = www.ayrton-senna.com}}</ref> The column had been cut and [[welding|welded]] back together at Senna's request in order for him to be more comfortable in the car.

Following the court's decision, an appeal was lodged by the state prosecutor against Patrick Head and Adrian Newey. On [[November 22]] [[1999]], the appeal absolved Head and Newey of all charges, stating that no new evidence had come to light (there was missing data from the black box recorder on Senna's car due to damage, and 1.6 seconds of video from the onboard camera of Senna's car was unavailable because the broadcaster switched to another car's camera just before the accident), and so under Article 530 of the Italian Penal Code, the accusation had to be declared as "non-existent or the fact doesn't subsist".<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.ayrton-senna.com/s-files/apelindx.html | title =Appeal absolves Head and Newey | accessdate = 2006-10-28| date = |work = Senna Files| publisher = www.ayrton-senna.com}}</ref> This appeal result was annulled in January 2003, as the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] believed that Article 530 was misinterpreted.<ref>{{cite news | title = Senna death case back in court | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2701713.stm | work = | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 2003-01-28 | accessdate = 2006-10-28}}</ref> A retrial was ordered and on [[May 27]] [[2005]], Head and Newey were both acquitted.<ref>{{cite news | title = Top designers acquitted on Senna | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4587195.stm | work = | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 2005-05-27 | accessdate = 2006-10-28}}</ref>
