"'''The Bus Uncle'''" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 巴士阿叔) is a [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] [[video clip]] capturing a verbal altercation aboard a bus in [[Hong Kong]] on [[April 27]], [[2006]]. 

The clip was taken by a passenger, uploaded to [[HK Golden Forum]], and then quickly mirrored on [[YouTube]] and [[Google Video]]. Soon after its debut on YouTube, the 6-minute video became a cultural sensation in [[Hong Kong]] and inspired vigorous debate and discussion on life and etiquette in the city. Attracting over one million hits, the clip became one of YouTube's most viewed items in May 2006.

Its copious use of [[profanity]] and its rhetorical outbursts attracted the attention of local and international media, and some of its utterances became catchphrases in Hong Kong and Chinese communities around the world.

==Incident==
[[Image:Triad3uc.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The infamous quote, "It's not resolved!", said by the middle-aged grumpy man appears as a tagline in this fake movie poster, imitating [[Johnnie To]]'s ''[[Election (2005 film)|Election]]'' series.]]
The incident took place on a [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] (route 68X) heading towards [[Yuen Long]] at approximately 11:00pm on the evening of [[27 April]], [[2006]]. The video clip begins with a middle-aged "uncle" called Chan Yuet Tung reacting furiously after the young man seated behind him had tapped his shoulder and asked him to lower his voice while speaking on the phone. The younger passenger, who seldom talked back during the quarrel, expressed reluctance to carry on the discussion. 

During the exchange, the middle-aged man exclaimed repeatly, "Not yet resolved! Not yet resolved! Not yet resolved!" (ie "We're not finished here!") and "I have pressure. You have pressure. Why did you provoke me?"  Both lines have become popular catchphrases in Hong Kong.  Through the second half of the recording, "Bus Uncle" uses many profanities to insult the young man, for example, "I fuck your mum!" and seems unapologetic when warned not to involve the mother ("Well, who ''should'' I fuck if I don't fuck your mum?").

Despite the strong language and "Bus Uncle's" asking the young man whether he considered himself a "good fighter", a physical altercation never seemed imminent.

==People Involved==
===Bus Uncle (Roger Chan Yuet Tung) ===
The "Bus Uncle" has been identified as 51 year old [[Chan Yuet Tung|Roger Chan Yuet Tung]] ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 陳乙東), a [[Yuen Long]] resident living with five cats. He has also made three attempts for the office of [[Hong Kong Chief Executive]]--in 1997, 2002 and 2005, but all failed in preliminary stage.  After Chan's identity was revealed, many journalists tried to interview him, but he demanded [[remuneration]] for press interviews.  Chan further claimed to have served an eight-year prison sentence in [[Belgium]] for drug smuggling and to have once won $2.5 million in a [[lottery]], only to gamble it all away.

The phrase "The Bus Uncle" was coined by members of an Internet forum in reference to the belligerent character in the video. Contrary to reports in Western media, the word "uncle" was never spoken in the video.

In Chinese culture, it is common for a person to call an older person of their father's generation "Uncle". Thus, the given title "Bus Uncle" is a reasonable way in chinese (both Cantonese and Mandarin) to refer to the person on this bus by the younger generation.

===Young man, victim (Elvis Ho Yui Hei)===
The young man scolded on the video has been identified as 23-year-old Elvis Ho Yui Hei ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 何銳熙), a property agent for his family's property management company in [[Mong Kok]]. On [[May 23]], [[2006]], Ho (previously misidentified as "Alvin" or "Elvin") called a talk show on [[Commercial Radio]] claiming to be the young man involved in the argument. <ref>[http://www.kevin-venus.com/temp/2.mp3 (Cantonese)] (Note: '''link broken''')</ref>. In a later interview with the [[South China Morning Post]], Ho said he often takes long bus rides home and would frequently ask passengers to lower their voices so he could nap. Despite being threatened and berated, Ho said he forgave "Bus Uncle" and sympathized with whatever stress the older man was suffering.

===Cameraman (Jon Fong Wing Hang)===
The man who recorded the video clip has been identified as 21-year-old Jon Fong Wing Hang ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 方穎恆), an accountant and part-time student, after he called a radio station on [[May 25]], [[2006]].  Fong, who recorded the clip with a Sony Ericsson W800i cellphone, claimed there was a second video yet to be posted online in which Ho fought back by making fun of "Bus Uncle" with a friend on the phone.  Fong also stated that the reason he recorded the clip was to provide evidence to police in case "Bus Uncle" became physically violent.  Fong has since sold the rights to the second video to [[Easy Finder]] magazine for HK$3,000 (US$375).{{cn}}

==Transcript of the interchange==

<p>Roger: Get off the bus immediately! Don't stay on the bus!
<p>Elvis: This isn't necessary.
<p>Roger: If it is unnecessary, why did you pat me on the shoulder? When I was talking on the phone, you...
<p>Elvis: (interrupts) Boss...
<p>Roger: Hey, don't call me "boss". For the sake of fairness, we don't know each other. Why did you have to do that? (faster tone) Why did you have to do that? Look, everyone in society suffers from stress. Now that you have done something very unfair, should I have a word with you?
<p>Elvis: (softly) I think we already aren't having a pleasant conversation anymore...
<p>Roger: (angrily interrupts) Now that we're talking, I ask you. Have I touched you? Well?
<p>Elvis: Just what do you want me to do?
<p>Roger: What do I want you to do? I want you to apologize!
<p>Elvis: Sorry, I didn't mean to.
<p>Roger: What do you mean, "You didn't mean to"? Who's right, you or me?
<p>Elvis: (interrupts softly) You want to save face.
<p>Roger: What?
<p>Elvis: (louder) You just want to save face. Sorry, boss.
<p>Roger: I don't want to save face! Hey look, first, when you spoke on the phone, I did not interfere with you.
<p>(Elvis puts his right arm on the headrest of the seat.)
<p>Roger: Why do you have to say I'm talking too loudly? I simply haven't disturbed you. Right? So, what do you have to say for yourself?
<p>Elvis: Well, nothing really has happened, it's all that simple.
<p>Roger: What has happened to you? Just what do you want? Hmm... I want to settle this with you.
<p>Elvis: The matter is settled, it's that simple.
<p>Roger: It isn't settled.
<p>Elvis: It's settled.
<p>Roger: (louder) It isn't settled!
<p>Elvis: It's settled.
<p>Roger: (yelling very loudly) It isn't settled!!! We both have to settle this right now! To put it simply, when you talked on the phone, did I interrupt you? Why did you interupt me?
<p>Elvis: You were talking too loudly.
<p>Roger: Look, when you were talking on the phone, did I say you were talking too loudly and disturbing other people? We're both talking on our phones. When people talk on the phone, there will be noise, but you, your voice... our voices are the same. Yes, and did I interrupt you for that? (Pause) What do you say?
<p>(Dead silence)
<p>Roger: (yelling) You're really asking for a fight! Fuck your mother! Are you asking for it? I am stressed, you are stressed, why did you provoke me?
<p>Elvis: (very softly) I didn't mean to...
<p>Roger: What do you mean "You didn't mean to."? Apologize this instant!
<p>Elvis: I'm sorry.
<p>Roger: Say it louder!
<p>Elvis: (louder) I'm sorry.
<p>Roger: Don't ever do that again, I warn you.
(Roger takes out his hand)
<p>Roger: Take out your hand.
<p>Elvis: (softly) It isn't necessary.
<p>Roger: Why isn't it necessary? Is something wrong?
<p>Elvis: (softly) I've apologized.
<p>Roger: When you've apologized, you shake hands. Why aren't you shaking hands after the apology?
<p>Elvis: It's not necessary.
<p>Roger: Why not? If you don't shake hands after your apology, it means that the matter still hasn't been settled.
<p>(Elvis laughs)
<p>Roger: If you don't shake hands, it's not settled. If the matter isn't settled, it means that we have to settle it for good, right? You disturbed me while I was on the phone, did I disturb you while you were on the phone? Fuck! I'm already furious. Just then I... Why did you pat me on the shoulder? Fuck your mother!
<p>Elvis: (very soft) (inaudible)
<p>Roger: You even interrupt me while I'm talking. What the fuck do you know about me? Fuck your mother! Hey! Now that you've  apologized, why don't you shake me by the hand? Well? The matter still hasn't been settled.
<p>Elvis: All right, I'll let you have your way.
(The two shake hands)
<p>Roger: Good, don't do it again. Let me tell you, other people will hit you if you do that.
<p>Elvis: May we meet each other again.
<p>Roger: Yes, if destiny permits. Just don't ever do it again. Don't disturb me, and I won't disturb you, ok? We both are stressed. Right?
<p>Elvis: Right.
<p>Roger: I'm always ready if you want to fight me.
<p>Elvis: That's not necessary.
<p>Roger: It's okay if that's not necessary.
<p>Elvis: Gentlemen talk things out, and do not resort to violence.
<p>Roger: (loudly) No, when you talk, you cause a great deal of trouble! You patted me on the shoulder while I was on the phone.
<p>Elvis: Well, then should I pat you on the head?
<p>Roger: You patted me on the shoulder! You've just apologized. There's no problem with that, but when you patted me on the  shoulder, it means that you've disturbed me before I've even disturbed you. Hence I fucked your mother! Is that right? Look, we've settled it. (begins to turn forwards)
<p>Elvis: But still, don't fuck the mother.
<p>Roger: (turns back sharply) If I don't fuck a mother, who should I fuck? (cuts off Elvis) When I fuck your mother, am I [[mating|copulating]] with her? I'm just using some Chinese swear words! (cuts off Elvis) I like to fuck! I'm not copulating with her! (turns forward)
<p>Elvis: (inaudible)... I'm warning you...
<p>Roger: (turns back sharply) Why are you warning me? Now that we have shaken hands, why are you warning me, pal? What's this for?
<p>Elvis: The matter has been settled...
<p>Roger: (interrupts) If it's been settled, why did you warn me? I'm heavily stressed. I wanted to shake hands. You settle... you said that the matter is settled and now you warn me? What's the point, pal? This is pointless for both of us, is that right? Now that we've shaken hands...
<p>Elvis: Let me tell you, this matter is between the two of us. Don't drag other people into it.
<p>Roger: If you have to drag people into it, you do so. If you enjoy fucking, you fuck; if I enjoy fucking, I fuck. Fucking other people is harmless. Fuck, fuck and fuck! Should I punch you twice instead? Right? When it's been settled, it's settled. Don't warn me. Why did you warn me? I'm not half scared even if you do! (Elvis opens up his phone) I'm extremely stressed, don't you know that? Now, do you understand? You shouldn't warn me! It's settled, you get the point? If you warn me, it means the matter isn't settled! We should forget about this, having shaken hands. OK?
<p>Elvis: All right, I don't want to talk to you any more.
<p>Roger: (yelling) What did you warn me for! Aren't you satisfied? (Roger's phone rings) Fuck!
<p>Elvis: Get the phone...
(Roger turns forward.)
<p>Roger: Hello? Hello.
<p>

==Aftermath==
Chan stated that when Ho tapped him on the shoulder, he was under duress from an argument with his girlfriend and was calling the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]] suicide-prevention hotline for support.  However, Ho claimed that Chan was just chatting with friends.

[[singtao|Singtao Daily]] reported that Chan visited Ho's office on [[31 May]] in [[Mong Kok]] to apologize for the dispute and to initiate a business proposal for the duo to hold a "Bus Uncle Rave Party".  But allegedly, Chan was quickly waved off and expelled by Ho, who expressed outrage towards the journalists who arranged the meeting and threatened legal action against the press.

On [[June 7]], [[2006]] Chan, who had been hired by a restaurant as a Public Relations officer, was physically assaulted on-the-job in front of horrified diners by three unidentified masked men who then fled the scene <ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/eastasia/view/212671/1/.html Hong Kong's "Bus Uncle" beaten up by three men]</ref>.  Mr. Chan sustained severe injuries to his eyes and face and was admitted to the emergency department for treatment.

The restaurant owner Mr. Lee was then under pressure from his wife and daughter to fire Chan due to magazine coverage of Chan's exploits in a [[Shenzhen]] karaoke hostess-bar.  Lee's initial refusal led his wife to attempt suicide by overdosing sleeping pills on June 11 in order to force the issue <ref>[http://www.wenweipo.com/news.phtml?news_id=HK0606120009&loc=LU&cat=583BS&no_combo=1 「扒后」林珍奇仰藥逼炒巴士阿叔 (Traditional Chinese)]</ref>.  Upon learning of Mrs. Lee's suicide attempt, Chan handed in his resignation, claiming he did not want Lee's family to be unhappy.

== Legal issues ==
Some local newspapers pointed out that the behaviour of the "Bus Uncle" contravened the general code of conduct of bus passengers, that it:

(1) constituted a [[Criminal law|criminal offence]], according to Section 46(1)(a), (n)(ii)<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/ceb25bf3ecef911fc8256483002ab2c2?OpenDocument Section 46]</ref> and 57(1)<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/625330b1d7c94f9ec8256483002ab34b?OpenDocument Section 57]</ref> of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations<ref>Cap 374D, see [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/CurAllEngDoc?OpenView&Start=374.5&Count=30&Expand=374.5#374.5 Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations]</ref>, which carries a maximum penalty of HKD$3000 and a 6-month imprisonment; and

(2) constituted an offence under Section 17B(2) of the Public Order Ordinance, which carries a maximum penalty of HKD$5000 and 12-months imprisonment.<ref>Cap245, see [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/dcaed660f878aed4c825648300288783?OpenDocument Section 17B of the Public Order Ordinance]</ref>. 

It is possible that his behaviour also constituted Criminal Intimidation, which is an offence under Section 24 of the Crimes Ordinance. It carries a maximum penalty of HKD$2000 and 5 years imprisonment.<ref>Cap 200, See [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/4c975ab8d4cd0d42c8256483003221d0?OpenDocument Section 24] for the offence and [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/5113a29cea392393c8256483003221eb?OpenDocument Section 27] for the penalties.</ref> 

Nevertheless, he has not been charged with any of these offences.

==Social impacts and popular culture==
[[Image:Pressureucb.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Poster of an event by [[Capcom]], capitalizing on the tagline ''"I have pressure. You have pressure."'' (我有壓力,你有壓力) adopted from the clip.]]
The famous quotes of Bus Uncle are now frequently used, mimicked, and parodied in Hong Kong, particularly by teenagers.  The catchphrases also appear on Internet forums, posters, and radio programmes.  Various "remixes" and parodies have been created, including versions tuned to Cantonese pop songs, an apology, "reenactments" of the incident with video game characters, composite pictures, and movie posters. On television, a [[TVB]] sports reporter was heard using the phrases, while an [[Asia Television Limited|ATV]] [[sitcom]] episode also imitated the video in an argument scene.  On [[28 May]], 2006, this incident was mentioned in the 6:30 News on TVB, highlighting the success of YouTube. It was also mentioned on Cable TV news .

The video clip, having been subtitled in English (in parts erroneously, though never straying too far from general tenor of the Cantonese), has penetrated Western media and been reported in numerous prominent international journals, such as the ''[[Associated Press]]'', ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and the [[Wall Street Journal]] <ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114962497534572979-search.html?KEYWORDS=%22bus+uncle%22&COLLECTION=wsjie/6month Bus Uncle collection at Wall Street Journal (subscription required)]</ref>, in late May.

Although many have found the video humorous and entertaining, others have warned that it hints at a more alarming and sinister prognosis of life in stress-filled Hong Kong.

[[To Kit]], a well-known columnist, made a commentary about the incident on Commercial Radio. He described the behavior of Bus Uncle as "a noise raping" and said that the incident was the manifestation of underlying social tension as well as the mindset of a common [[China|Chinese]] person.  He criticised Elvis' speechlessness as being too weak, likewise a stereotype of present-day Hong Kong youths. In addition, he noted that the incident implied that harmony in the neighborhood was somehow hindered.   
    
Dr. Lee Sing, director of the Hong Kong Mood Centre at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], warned that Hong Kong's high-stress working environments are spawning a city-full of "Bus Uncles".  Dr. Lee estimated that one out of every 50 grumpy Hong Kongers is a "ticking time bomb" of rage and violence.

Nonetheless, others denied any social insights could be gleamed from the video clip and argued that the frenzy was artificially created by newspapers in order to boost circulation and profits.  Media ethicists charged the media with making and not reporting news.  Clement So York-kee, Director of the [[School of journalism|School of Journalism]] at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, warned that methods to uncover Bus Uncle news "did not seem to...[involve the] traditional practice of news reporting".  For example, several media outlets had offered rewards on unmasking Uncle Bus' identity.  And in late May, a group of journalists and photographers initiated and followed Chan's second meeting with Ho.  After Ho's rebuff, they brought Bus Uncle to a dinner and karaoke session.  Although the session was widely reported, many believed it was artificially created news and unworthy of front-page attention.

Others argued the frenzy was not the product of a media conspiracy but rather a reflection of the public's curiosity and of Hong Kong's consumer-driven media market.

In June 2006, TVB television made a parody of the Bus Uncle video in its television promotion for its coverage of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].  The advertisement featured TVB sports commentator Lam Sheung-Yee (林尚義), whose voice resembles Chan's, on a bus playing the role of the Bus Uncle.  In the promotion, a passenger sitting behind Lam Sheung-Yee (played by Lam Man Chung) questions whether Lam Sheung-Yee feels pressured for his responsibilities in the upcoming World Cup, which would be his last TV appearance before retirement.  Turning around, Lam replies that there is no pressure and emphasizes that the issue (i.e. the viewers' demand for World Cup coverage) has been resolved.  The passenger then offers to shake hands with Lam Sheung-Yee and calls for a truce. 

A re-enactment of the Bus Uncle scene is now an advertisement for a type of bottled water sold at supermarket chain [[PARKnSHOP]] {{cn}}, as well as a version made by [[TVB]] to promote their [[2006 World Cup]] coverage.
