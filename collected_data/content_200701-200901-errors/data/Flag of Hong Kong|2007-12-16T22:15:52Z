The '''flag of Hong Kong''', or the '''Regional Flag of the [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China]]''' ({{zh-ts|t=中華人民共和國香港特別行政區區旗|s=中华人民共和国香港特别行政区区旗}}), features a stylised, white, five-petal ''[[Bauhinia blakeana]]'' flower in the centre of a red field.

The flag of Hong Kong was adopted on [[16 February]] [[1990]].  On [[10 August]] [[1996]], it received formal approval from the [[Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Preparatory Committee]], a group which advised the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) on [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty]] from the [[United Kingdom]] to the PRC in 1997.  The flag was first officially hoisted on [[1 July]] [[1997]], in the [[The handover ceremony of Hong Kong in 1997|handover ceremony]] marking the transfer of sovereignty. The precise use of the flag is regulated by laws passed by the 58th executive meeting of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] held in [[Beijing]].<ref name="CRWFlagsHKSAR">{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/hk.html|title=Hong Kong|publisher=CRW Flags|date=[[2007-06-23]]|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>  The design of the flag is enshrined in Hong Kong's [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], the city's constitutional document,<ref name="BasicLaw">{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/basic_law/fulltext/|title=Basic Law Full Text|publisher=Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> and regulations regarding the use, prohibition of use, [[Flag desecration|desecration]], and manufacture of the flag are stated in the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance.<ref name="RegionalFlagEmblemOrdinance">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_export.nsf/findEngSection?OpenAgent&View_name=ProCurAllEngDoc&section_choose=CAP%202602%20%20REGIONAL%20FLAG%20AND%20REGIONAL%20EMBLEM%20ORDINANCE&chapter_choose=Chapter%202602%20REGIONAL%20FLAG%20AND%20REGIONAL%20EMBLEM%20ORDINANCE|title=Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance|publisher=Bilingual Laws Information System|date=[[1997-07-01]]|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>

==Design==
===Symbolism===
[[Image:Flagofhk.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The flag of Hong Kong flying beside the national PRC flag]]
The design of the flag carries cultural, political and regional meanings. The colour itself is significant; red is a festive colour for the [[Chinese people]], used to convey a sense of celebration and nationalism.<ref name="chinabook">{{cite web|url=http://chinabook.gapp.gov.cn/O/article.aspx?artid=066101&cateid=p26|title=忆香港区旗区徽的诞生 (Reflecting on the Creation of the Hong Kong SAR Flag and Emblem)|publisher=中国图书出版网|accessdate=2007-08-01|language=Simplified Chinese}}</ref>  Moreover, the red colour is identical to that used in the [[Flag of the People's Republic of China|national PRC flag]],<ref name="CAP2602-Sched1">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/BLIS_export.nsf/CCD1DC74C1B00D2C48256D52002198AE/9DBC16A7A42C53BE4825650A0008C498?OpenDocument|title=CAP 2602, Schedule 1 - Specifications For The Regional Flag of The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of The People's Republic of China|publisher=Bilingual Laws Information System|date=[[1997-07-01]]|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> chosen to signify the link re-established between post-colonial Hong Kong and [[China]]. The juxtaposition of red and white on the flag symbolises the ''[[one country two systems]]'' political principle applied to the region. The stylised rendering of the ''Bauhinia blakeana'' flower, a flower discovered in Hong Kong, is meant to serve as a harmonising symbol for this dichotomy.<ref name="chinabook" />

=== Construction ===
The front and the back of the Hong Kong flag look identical to each other, creating a [[mirror image]] effect. The [[Hong Kong government]] has specified sizes, colours, and manufacturing parameters in which the flag is to be made.<ref name="CAP2602-Sched1" />  The background of the rectangular flag is red, the same shade of red as that used for the national PRC flag.<ref name="CAP2602-Sched1" />  The ratio of its length to breadth is 1.5.  In its centre is a five-petal stylised rendering of a white ''Bauhinia blakeana'' flower.  If a circle circumscribes the flower, it should have a diameter 0.6 times the entire height of the flag.  The petals are uniformly spread around the centre point of the flag, radiating outward and pointing in a clockwise direction. Each of the flower's petals bears a five-pointed [[red star]], a [[communist]] and [[socialist]] symbolism, with a red trace, suggestive of a flower [[stamen]]. The red trace makes each petal look as if it is being divided in half. The heading that is used to allow a flag to be slid or raised onto a pole is white.<ref name="CAP2602-Sched1" />

===Manufacture regulated===
The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance stipulates that the Hong Kong flag must be manufactured according to specifications laid out in the ordinance.  If flags are not produced in design according to the ordinance, the [[Secretary for Justice]] may petition the [[District Court (Hong Kong)|District Court]] for an injunction to prohibit the person or company from manufacturing the flags.  If the District Court agrees that the flags are not in compliance, it may issue an injunction and order that the flags and the materials that were used to make the flags to be seized by the government.<ref name="CAP2602-S5">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/BLIS_export.nsf/CCD1DC74C1B00D2C48256D52002198AE/9D66BC4E4729BA114825650A0007CEEA?OpenDocument|title=CAP 2602, Section 5 - Manufacture of regional flag and regional emblem regulated|publisher=Bilingual Laws Information System|date=[[1997-07-01]]|accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>

==History==
===Historical flags===
[[Image:Hongkongflag1910.gif|thumb|right|200px|Colonial flag of Hong Kong, used circa 1868]] 
[[Image:Flag of Hong Kong 1959.svg|thumb|right|200px|Colonial flag of Hong Kong, used from 1959 to 1997]]
Prior to Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty, the flag of Hong Kong was a colonial [[Blue Ensign]] flag.<ref name="CRWFlagsColonialHK">{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/hk-colon.html|title=Colonial Hong Kong|publisher=CRW Flags|date=[[2006-01-07]]|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>  The flag of [[colonial Hong Kong]] underwent several changes in the last one and a half centuries.

In 1843, a [[Seal (contract law)|seal]] representing Hong Kong was instituted.  The design was based on a local waterfront scene; three local merchants with their commercial goods can be found on the foreground, a square-rigged ship and a junk occupy the middle ground, while the background consists of conical hills and clouds. In 1868, a Hong Kong flag was produced, a Blue Ensign flag with a badge based on this "local scene", but the design was rejected by [[Governor of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Governor]] [[Richard Graves MacDonnell]].<ref name="asf">{{cite web|url=http://www.allstates-flag.com/fotw/flags/hk-colon.html|title=Colonial Hong Kong|publisher=AllStates Flag & Banner Company|date=[[2005-04-02]]|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref>

In 1870, a "white crown over HK" badge for the Blue Ensign flag was proposed by the [[Chief Secretary for Administration|Colonial Secretary]]. The letters "HK" were omitted and the crown became full-colour three years later.<ref name="asf" /> It is unclear exactly what the badge looked like during that period of time, but it was unlikely to be the "local scene".  It should have been a crown of some sort, which may, or may not, have had the letters "HK" below it.  In 1876, the "local scene" badge was re-adopted to the Blue Ensign flag with the [[Admiralty]]'s approval.<ref name="CRWFlagsColonialHK" />

By 1955, the "local scene" badge in the Blue Ensign flag was revised.  The new badge was similar to the 1876 badge, but had a slightly lower eye-line, and a more realistic mountain on the left-hand side. The mountain, the ship, and the junk were made more prominent and embossed.<ref name="CRWFlagsColonialHK" />

A [[Emblem of Hong Kong|coat of arms for Hong Kong]] was granted on [[21 January]] [[1959]] by the [[College of Arms]] in [[London]].  The Hong Kong flag was revised in the same year to feature the coat of arms in the Blue Ensign flag.  This design was used from 1959 until Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty in 1997.<ref name="CRWFlagsColonialHK" />

===Current design===
Before Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty, a contest was held amongst Hong Kong residents to help choose a flag for post-colonial Hong Kong.  More than 7,000 designs were submitted for the contest and a panel of political figures were chosen as judges for the designs.  Architect [[Tao Ho]] was chosen as one of the panel judges to pick Hong Kong's new flag.  He recalled that some of the designs had been rather funny and with political twists:  "One had a [[hammer and sickle]] on one side and a [[dollar sign]] on the other."<ref name="Asiaweek.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/97/0620/hkorganizers.html|title=Bringing You The Handover: Meet some of the most important men and women working behind the scenes|author=Andrea Hamilton|publisher=Asiaweek|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref>  Six designs were chosen as finalists by the judges, but were all later rejected by the PRC.  Ho and two others were then asked by the PRC to submit new proposals.<ref name="chinabook" />

Looking for inspiration, Ho wandered into a garden and picked up a ''Bauhinia blakeana'' flower. He observed the symmetry of the five petals, and how their winding pattern conveyed to him a dynamic feeling.  This led him to incorporated the flower into the flag to represent Hong Kong.<ref name="chinabook" />

==Proper flag protocol==
[[Image:HKChinaFlags.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Hong Kong flag and the national PRC flag flown side-by-side at the patio of the [[Legislative Council Building]]]]
The Hong Kong flag is flown daily from the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]]'s official residence, the [[Government House, Hong Kong|Government House]], the [[Hong Kong International Airport]], and at all border crossings and points of entry into Hong Kong.<ref name="StipulationsForDisplay">{{cite web|url=http://www.protocol.gov.hk/flags/eng/doc/stipulations_e.pdf|format=PDF|title=Stipulations For The Display and Use of The National Flag and National Emblem and The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem|publisher=Protocol Division Government Secretariat of the HKSAR|accessdate=2007-07-31|format=PDF}}</ref> At major government offices and buildings, such as the [[Office of the Chief Executive]], the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]], the [[Court of Final Appeal]], the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]], the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]], and the [[Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office]]s overseas, the flag is displayed during days when these offices are working. Other government offices and buildings, such as hospitals, schools, departmental headquarters, sports grounds, and cultural venues should fly the flag on occasions such as the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day of the PRC]] ([[1 October]]), the [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Establishment Day]] ([[1 July]]), and [[New Year's Day]].<ref name="StipulationsForDisplay" /> The flag should be raised at 8:00&nbsp;a.m. and lowered at 6:00&nbsp;p.m.  The raising and lowering of the flag should be done slowly; it must reach the peak of the flag staff when it is raised, and it may not touch the ground when it is lowered.  The flag may not be raised in severe weather conditions.<ref name="DisplayEmblemsFlags">{{cite web|url=http://www.protocol.gov.hk/flags/eng/show/index.html|title=Display of the Flags and Emblems|publisher=Protocol Division Government Secretariat of the HKSAR|date=[[2005-09-06]]|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>  A Hong Kong flag that is either damaged, defaced, faded or substandard must not be displayed or used.<ref name="CAP2602-S4">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/BLIS_export.nsf/CCD1DC74C1B00D2C48256D52002198AE/4C9B14D4AC2B5EBD4825650A0007B07C?OpenDocument|title=CAP 2602, Section 4 - Damaged regional flag and regional emblem not to be used|publisher=Bilingual Laws Information System|date=[[1997-07-01]]|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>

===Displayed together with the national flag===
Whenever the national PRC flag is flown together with the regional Hong Kong flag, the national flag must be flown at the centre, above the regional flag, or otherwise in a more prominent position than that of the regional flag.  The regional flag must be smaller in size than the national flag, and it must be displayed to the left of the national flag.  When the flags are displayed inside a building, the left and right sides of a person looking at the flags, and with his or her back toward the wall, are used as reference points for the left and right sides of a flag.  When the flags are displayed outside a building, the left and right sides of a person standing in front of the building and looking towards the front entrance are used as reference points for the left and right sides of a flag.  The national flag should be raised before the regional flag is raised, and it should be lowered after the regional flag is lowered.<ref name="DisplayEmblemsFlags" />

===Half-staff===
[[Image:HKSARFlagHalfMast.png|thumb|right|200px|The Hong Kong flag at half-staff]]
The Hong Kong flag must be lowered to [[half-staff]] as a token of mourning when any of the following persons pass away:<ref name="CAP2602-Sched4">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/BLIS_export.nsf/CCD1DC74C1B00D2C48256D52002198AE/D04C9136BD12EC854825650A000FA238?OpenDocument|title=CAP 2602, Schedule 4 - Conditions for Flying The Regional Flag at Half |publisher=Bilingual Laws Information System|date=[[1997-07-01]]|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>

The flag may also be flown at half-staff when the Central People's Government advises the Chief Executive to do so, or when the Chief Executive considers it appropriate to do so, on occurrences of unfortunate events causing especially serious casualties, or when serious natural calamities have caused heavy casualties.<ref name="CAP2602-Sched4" />  When raising a flag to be flown at half-staff, it should be first raised to the peak of the staff and then lowered to a point where the distance between the top of the flag and the peak of the staff is one third of the length of the staff.  When lowering the flag from half-staff, it should be first raised to the peak of the staff before it is lowered.<ref name="DisplayEmblemsFlags" />

===Prohibition of use and desecration===
The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance states what manner of use of the Hong Kong flag is prohibited and that desecration of the flag is prohibited; it also states that it is a punishable offence for a person to use the flag in a prohibited manner or desecrate the flag.  According to the ordinance, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks,<ref name="CAP2602-S6">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/BLIS_export.nsf/CCD1DC74C1B00D2C48256D52002198AE/8DDF339356548CCC4825650A0007F0D1?OpenDocument|title=CAP 2602, Section 6 - Prohibition on certain uses of the regional flag and regional emblem|publisher=Bilingual Laws Information System|date=[[1997-07-01]]|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> and that "publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling" the flag is considered flag desecration.<ref name="CAP2602-S7">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/BLIS_export.nsf/CCD1DC74C1B00D2C48256D52002198AE/DA8A090244B2C28E4825650A000821C7?OpenDocument|title=CAP 2602, Section 7 - Protection of the regional flag and regional emblem|publisher=Bilingual Laws Information System|date=[[1997-07-01]]|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref>

The ordinance also allows for the Chief Executive to make stipulations regarding the use of the flag.  In stipulations made in 1997, the Chief Executive further specified that the use of the flag in "any trade, calling or profession, or the logo, seal or badge of any [[non-governmental organisation]]" is also prohibited unless prior permission was obtained.<ref name="Stipulations">{{cite web|url=http://www.protocol.gov.hk/flags/eng/doc/stipulations_e.pdf|format=PDF|title=Stipulations for The Display and Use of The National Flag and National Emblem and The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem|publisher=Protocol Division Government Secretariat of the HKSAR|year=1997|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>

[[Leung Kwok-hung]], a member of the Legislative Council (the [[legislative]] body of the Hong Kong government) and a prominent [[political activist]] in Hong Kong, was penalised for defiling the Hong Kong flag in 2001 (he was not a member of the Legislative Council at the time). He was placed on a good-behaviour bond for 12 months in the sum of [[HK$]]3,000 for dotting the flag with black marks while protesting against the handover anniversary and elections to choose the [[Election Committee]], the [[electoral college]] which elects the Chief Executive, in [[Wan Chai]], [[Admiralty, Hong Kong|Admiralty]] and [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] on [[1 July]] and [[9 July]] [[2000]].<ref name="longhair">{{cite news|title='Long Hair' bound over after defiling SAR flags|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=[[2001-02-24]]}}</ref>

Leung's case was the second convicted case of flag desecration in Hong Kong.  The first case involved demonstrators Ng Kung Siu and Lee Kin Yun, who were found guilty of desecrating both the Hong Kong flag and the national PRC flag in a [[demonstration]] held in January 1998, for writing the word "Shame" on both flags.  The case was finally decided in the Court of Final Appeal, the highest [[appellate court]] in Hong Kong, after an initial guilty verdict was overturned by the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asil.org/ilib/ilib0241.htm#03|title=Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal: Hong Kong SAR v.
