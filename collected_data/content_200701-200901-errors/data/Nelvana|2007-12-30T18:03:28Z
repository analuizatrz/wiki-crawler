'''Nelvana Limited''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] entertainment company, founded in 1971, that is well-known for its work in children's [[animation]], among many things. It was named by its founders—[[Michael Hirsh (producer)|Michael Hirsh]], [[Patrick Loubert]] and [[Clive A. Smith]]—after a [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights|Canadian comic book superheroine]] created by [[Adrian Dingle (comic book artist)|Adrian Dingle]] in the 1940s. [[Corus Entertainment]], a spin-off from [[Shaw Communications]], has owned the company since September 2000.

Most of its films, shows and specials are based on licensed properties, mainly children's literature. But, as with most companies of its kind, original programming is also part of its roster. In spite of its status as a cartoon company, it ventured into the world of [[live action]] from its establishment up until the late 1990s.

Well-known franchises from Nelvana include ''[[Care Bears]]'', ''[[Babar the Elephant|Babar]]'', ''[[Little Bear (TV series)|Little Bear]]'', ''[[Eek! The Cat]]'', ''[[Franklin (TV series)|Franklin]]'' and ''[[6teen]]'', along with the North American dubs of the [[anime]] series ''[[Beyblade]]'', ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura]]'' and ''[[Medabots]]''. It also distributes the [[Nicktoons]] ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' and ''[[Danny Phantom]]'', and the [[Cartoon Network]] TV show ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]'', outside the United States. [[As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}]], its library comprises more than 1,650 cumulative half-hours of original programming.<ref name="kidscreen">Fitzgerald, James (May 1, 2001).

==History==
===1970s===
[[Image:CosmicChristmas-Nelvana-1977.png|thumb|Scene from ''A Cosmic Christmas'', Nelvana's first TV special]]
Nelvana started in 1971 when two graduates of [[York University]], Michael Hirsh and Patrick Loubert, teamed up with a British animator-designer by the name of Clive A. Smith in [[Toronto, Ontario]]. Hirsh and Loubert, who had a passion for [[underground film]]making, had founded a small company called Laff Arts in the late 1960s. Smith, whose interest was in [[rock n' roll]] music, had previously been among the crew for [[the Beatles]]' [[The Beatles (TV series)|animated series]] and their 1968 film, ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Hirsh has commented on the background of Nelvana's founding:

{{cquote|Clive is an animator, and Patrick and I became interested in animation when we were in university together. At the time, there was no production industry per se in Canada, either in animation or in television production. There were stations making local shows, but you didn’t have people making programs for sale around the world. So, blissfully unaware of all it would involve, we decided to start a company in Toronto.}}

Soon after they stumbled upon a collection of local [[comic book]]s from the 1940s, the trio acquired the ownership rights. In turn, they made a half-hour television documentary for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] focusing on Canadian comics. Their two-year travelling tour of the art from the [[National Gallery of Canada]], "Comic Art Traditions in Canada, 1941-45", gave locals a chance to revisit the country's past heritage in that field.<ref>[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/c/canada.htm "Canadian Heroes" page] at internationalhero.co.uk. Retrieved July 10, 2006.</ref> Meanwhile, Hirsh and Loubert collaborated on a related primer from Peter Martin and Associates, ''[[The Great Canadian Comic Books]]''. Amid all this success, Hirsh, Loubert and Smith named their new enterprise Nelvana—after a Canadian comic book [[superheroine]] from [[World War II]], [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights]], who was one of the characters in the ''[[Canadian Whites]]'' canon.

A derelict apartment in downtown Toronto served as the company's first building, and a homemade wooden stand mounted over a toilet was among its first camera equipment. "To create zooms," Hirsh recalls his early experience with this machine, "we would pile up phone books under the art work." During their first year and a half, the trio lived off a superfluous [[Chargex]] credit card that Loubert received at university, spending up to C$7,500 on it before they reclaimed double that cost as their first ever transaction.<ref name="kidscreen">Fitzgerald, James (May 1, 2001). [http://www.kidscreen.com/articles/magazine/20010501/30888.html?print=yes "Nelvana's 30th Anniversary Profile"]. KidScreen Magazine. Retrieved July 1, 2006.</ref> Under those conditions, Nelvana was involved in the production of documentaries and live-action films. In the area of part-time animation work, they made ten C$1,500 [[filler (media)|filler]]s for the CBC.

Among the studio's first productions was a low-budget CBC [[short subject]] series, ''[[Small Star Cinema]]'', which combined live-action and animation to tell stories of ordinary life from a child's point of view. It was followed by 1975's ''[[Christmas Two Step]]'', a similarly-styled special in which a girl tries to be a lead dancer at a Christmas pageant.

[[Image:Fettcartoon.JPG|thumb|150px|Boba Fett, the ''Star Wars'' character Nelvana introduced in its segment of [[1978 in television|1978]]'s ''Holiday Special'']]
Then, thanks to new talent from [[Sheridan College]], all of whom were graduates of the institution, Nelvana worked on their first television specials: ''[[A Cosmic Christmas]]'' (1977), ''[[The Devil and Daniel Mouse]]'' (1978), ''Please Don't Eat the Planet'' (better known by its subtitle, ''[[Intergalactic Thanksgiving]]'') (1979), ''[[Romie-0 and Julie-8]]'' (1979), ''[[Easter Fever]]'' (1980) and ''[[Take Me Up to the Ball Game]]'' (1980). During that time, [[George Lucas]], an aficionado of their work, commissioned the company to work on a 10-minute sequence for the [[CBS]] TV film, ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''. This short scene, officially entitled "The Faithful Wookiee", would introduce audiences to the villainous bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]], who would make his first theatrical appearance in [[1980 in film|1980]]'s ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]''.

===1980s===
[[Image:RockandRule.png|thumb|150px|The high cost of ''Rock & Rule'', Nelvana's first feature film, almost made the studio bankrupt.]]
At the start of the 1980s, Nelvana was offered the chance to work on ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', an animated anthology of science fiction stories that studios in Canada and other countries were working on. Nelvana declined this opportunity, instead going on to concentrate on the production of its first feature film, ''[[Rock & Rule]]''.

Based heavily on the earlier special ''The Devil and Daniel Mouse'', and originally titled ''Drats!'', the film was produced for five years using all of the studio's resources, totalling $8 million. Upon its release by [[MGM|MGM/UA]] in [[1983 in film|1983]], it received little promotion in the United States and quickly disappeared at the box office.

The financial demise of ''Rock & Rule'' would have ended Nelvana's operations altogether, had the company not saved themselves from debt by working full-time on children's television series. On its agenda at that time were its first three live-action franchises, ''[[The Edison Twins]]'', ''[[20 Minute Workout]]'' and ''[[Mr. Microchip]]''. With [[DiC Entertainment]], Nelvana worked on the first season of ''[[Inspector Gadget]]'', and animated the pilot episode of ''[[The Get-Along Gang]]''.

Early in the decade, the company worked on four television specials based on [[American Greetings]] properties. They were ''[[The Magic of Herself the Elf]]'', based on [[Mattel]]'s [[Herself the Elf|toy line]]; ''[[Strawberry Shortcake's Housewarming Surprise]]''; ''[[Strawberry Shortcake and the Baby Without a Name]]''; and ''[[Strawberry Shortcake Meets the Berrykins]]'', the last three of which featured the [[Strawberry Shortcake|eponymous doll]]. There were two shows from Nelvana based on the [[AmToy]] properties, ''[[Madballs]]'' and ''[[My Pet Monster]]''.

[[Image:CBMI poster.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Nelvana's work on the Care Bears franchise was among its earliest success stories.]]
But perhaps its greatest success at the time came in the form of the [[Care Bears]], thanks to its acquisition of the character rights from American Greetings, the franchise owners. In early [[1985 in film|1985]], [[The Care Bears Movie|the first movie based on the toy line]] turned the company's fortunes around, grossing [[United States dollar|$]]23&nbsp;million in the U.S., and another [[Canadian dollar|$]]1.5&nbsp;million in its native Canada. Its tremendous success gave way to two more big-screen movies, ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation|A New Generation]]'' and ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland|Adventure in Wonderland]]'', as well as a [[The Care Bears (TV series)|television series]].<ref>DiC Entertainment also made 22 episodes of the Care Bears series before Nelvana reclaimed the rights for the animated franchise.</ref>
<!-- Since this is a GA, please find a source or two for this:
In addition, Nelvana hired [[Gordon Stanfield Animation (GSA)]] in Vancouver for episode storyboarding of the ''Care Bears'' series. The latter worked on many of Nelvana's productions afterward. -->

In the area of science fiction, Nelvana produced ''[[Star Wars: Droids|Droids]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Ewoks|Ewoks]]'', two Saturday-morning series based on ''[[Star Wars]]''. At one point, there was talk of an animated CBS show from the studio, based on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Doctor Who]]''; the plan never came to fruition,<ref>{{cite book|last = Lofficier|first = Jean-Marc|title = The Nth Doctor|publisher = Virgin Publishing|date = 1997|pages = 9|url = http://www.lofficier.com/nthdoctor.htm|isbn = 0-426-20499-9}}</ref> but concept art was created by Ted Bastien.<ref>{{cite web|title = CBC Television - The Planet of the Doctor ("Ted Bastien's Nelvana photo gallery.")|publisher = CBC Television|url = http://www.cbc.ca/planetofthedoctor/tb_gallery.html|accessdate = 2007-01-27}}</ref>

For [[Orion Pictures]]' [[1986 in film|1986 live-action western comedy]], ''[[¡Three Amigos!]]'', the company made use of [[animatronics]] in one scene with a talking turtle. In [[1987 in film|1987]], Michael Hirsh produced Nelvana's first self-made film of this calibre, the [[Whoopi Goldberg]] comedy ''[[Burglar (film)|Burglar]]''.

The company's fourth live-action series, ''[[T. and T.]]'', premiered in 1988 on Canada's [[Global (TV network)|Global]] network. The show's title duo comprised of [[Mr. T]] of ''[[The A-Team|A-Team]]'' fame, playing a former boxer named T.S. Turner, and Canadian actress [[Kristina Nicoll]] as an East Coast lawyer by the name of Terri Taler. Nelvana faced bankruptcy for the second time when the show's original American distributor was going out of business; in six weeks, they were saved when they found a replacement.<ref name=sob>Daly, John (2001, January 31).

As the decade came to a close, the revived Nelvana had its next big success with [[Babar: The Movie|a movie]] and an [[HBO]] [[Babar (TV series)|television show]] based on [[Jean de Brunhoff]]'s ''Babar'' book series. This franchise, its first [[international co-production]], won many [[CableACE Award|ACE Awards]] in the U.S. and [[Gemini Award|Geminis]] in Canada. In September 1989, ABC began to air one of the company's products: [[Beetlejuice (TV series)|an animated series]] based on [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Beetlejuice]]''.

===1990s===
Following ''Babar''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s success, the studio acquired the rights to animated series based on [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', [[Maurice Sendak]]'s ''[[Little Bear (book)|Little Bear]]'', [[Joanna Cole]]'s ''[[The Magic School Bus]]'' and the British comic strip ''[[Rupert the Bear]]''. Nelvana had self-made successes of its own during the 1990s, such as ''Eek! The Cat'', ''[[Dog City]]'' (with [[Jim Henson Productions]]) and ''[[Ned's Newt]]''.

[[Image:Movie poster pippi.jpg|thumb|left|Video poster for Nelvana's 1997 film based on [[Astrid Lindgren]]'s ''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'']]
In autumn 1993, Nelvana signed a multi-year project to produce five feature films for [[Paramount Pictures]], with [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Frank Marshall]] producing; the first two began production the following summer, at a cost of over US$20&nbsp;million each.<ref>McRoberts, Kenneth (1995).

However, none of those films ever made it past the finishing stage. During the 1990s, another set of features from Nelvana was distributed by different companies. A [[1993 in film|1993]] live-action thriller called ''[[Malice (film)|Malice]]'' came out under the [[Columbia Pictures]] banner; [[1997 in film|1997]] saw the studio's retelling of ''[[Pippi Longstocking (1997 film)|Pippi Longstocking]]'' from [[Legacy Releasing]]; and ''[[Babar: King of the Elephants]]'' was released in Canada by [[Alliance Atlantis]] in 1999. Among them, only ''Malice'' would go on to achieve box-office success in North America.

But Hirsh went up against it, arguing with then-[[Chief Operating Officer|COO]] [[Eleanor Olmstead]] about its possible effects on his institution. Two months later, possibly with this situation to blame, Golden Books withdrew from the deal without giving any explanation, and stated that they would concentrate more on children's entertainment, an ironic twist of fate given Nelvana's established expertise in that field.<ref name=sob>Daly, John (2001, January 31).

{{mainarticle|List of Nelvana franchises}}
