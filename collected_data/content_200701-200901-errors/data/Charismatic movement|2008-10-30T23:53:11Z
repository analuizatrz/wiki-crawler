The term '''Charismatic Movement''' describes the adoption, from around 1960 onwards, (for Protestants) and 1967 onwards (for Roman Catholics) of certain beliefs typical of those held by [[Pentecostal]] Christians by those within the historic denominations.<ref> D W Bebbington ''Evangelicals in Modern Britain: A History from the 1730s to the 1980s'' (London: Unwin, 1989) 229 </ref>  The use of the term "charismatic" to describe what was happening in the older churches was first coined by Harold Bredesen in 1962.  In the face of the term "neo-Pentecostal," he said "We prefer the title 'the charismatic renewal in the historic churches.'"<ref> Peter Hocken ''Streams of Renewal: The Origins and Early Development of the Charismatic Movement in Great Britain'' (Exeter; Paternoster, 1986) 184</ref>

==Terminology==
{{Refimprovesect|date=October 2008}}
The term "Charismatic Movement" can easily be confused with the term "[[charismatic]]." The word "[[charismatic]]"  is an umbrella term used to describe those [[Christianity|Christians]] who believe that the manifestations of the [[Holy Spirit]] seen in the first century Christian Church, such as [[miracle]]s, [[prophecy]], and [[glossolalia]] (speaking in other tongues or languages), are available to contemporary Christians and may be experienced and practiced today. It is derived from the Greek word {{lang|grc|χάρισμα}} ("gift," itself derived from {{lang|grc|χάρις}}, "grace" or "favor") which is the term used in the [[Bible]], {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|12-14|NRSV}}. "Charismatic Movement," however, expresses the arrival of spiritual gifts in the historic mainline denominations.

===Pentecostal===

The Charismatic Movement has a relationship with Pentecostalism, in that it shares a commitment to the use of spiritual gifts. However, within the Charismatic Movement this commitment is embedded within the full variety of historic denominations, and so in each context theology, culture and acceptance can vary enormously. Nonetheless it must be remembered that the term "[[Pentecostal]]" refers to that set of denominations that arose out of the 1906 [[Azusa Street Revival]], whereas the Charismatic Movement refers to a different era, context and theological content. Another term "neo-Pentecostal" is sometimes used to describe non-Pentecostal charismatics, who are either part of the Charismatic Movement, or neo-Charismatics.

===Neocharismatics===
An important characteristic of the Charismatic Movement was a willingness for the believer, after discovering the importance of spiritual gifts, to remain within their original denomination. From the late 1950s many [[charismatic]] Christians went on to form separate churches and denominations, for which the appropriate term is [[neocharismatic]]. Examples of this include the [[Vineyard Movement]] in the US (and elsewhere) and the [[British New Church Movement]].

===Shared Beliefs===
[[Pentecostal]]s, the Charismatic Movement and [[neocharismatic|neocharismatics]] share major narratives, such as the way God works in [[revival]], and the power and presence of God evidenced in the daily life of the believer. Many churches influenced by the Charismatic Movement deliberately distanced themselves from Pentecostalism, however,  for cultural and theological reasons, the foremost theological reason being the tendency of many Pentecostals to insist that speaking in tongues (as initial physical evidence) is necessary for [[Baptism in the Holy Spirit]]. {{Fact|date=September 2008}} Another important reason to clearly distinguish Pentecostals from the Charismatic Movement is one of style;<ref>Teddy Saunders and Hugh Sansom ''David Watson, a Biography'' (Sevenoaks: Hodder, 1992) 71</ref> which whilst harder to assess, has been an important factor.

All [[charismatic]]s have a shared heritage in the [[Holiness Movement|Wesleyan-Holiness]] tradition. {{fact|date=October 2008}} Additionally, many in the Charismatic Movement employ contemporary styles of worship, and innovative, modern methods of outreach.

==Denominations affected==
===Anglicans===
While it may be unclear how, when and where Pentecostalism began to influence the historic denominations, [[Dennis Bennett]], an American Episcopalian, is often cited as the movement's seminal influence {{fact|date=October 2008}}. Bennett was the Rector at St Mark's [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] Church in [[Van Nuys]], California when he announced to the congregation in 1960 that he had received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Soon after this he was ministering in [[Vancouver]] where he ran many workshops and seminars about the work of the Holy Spirit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.telus.net/st_simons/arm12.htm|title=Anglican Pioneer in Renewal|accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref> This influenced tens of thousands of Anglicans worldwide and also began a renewal movement within the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches.

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Colin Urquhart]], [[Michael Harper (priest)|Michael Harper]], [[David Watson (evangelist)|David Watson]] and others were in the vanguard of similar developments.

The [[Massey University|Massey]] conference in New Zealand, 1964 was attended by several Anglicans including, the Rev. Ray Muller who went on to invite [[Dennis Bennett]] to New Zealand in 1966, and played a leading role in developing and promoting the ''Life in the Spirit'' seminars.

===Reformed Charismatics===
A more recent trend is the inclusion of Charismatic elements in more traditionally [[Calvinist]] or [[Reformed Theology]].{{fact|date=October 2008}}  Reformed Charismatics, on the whole, reject the '[[prosperity gospel]]' and distance themselves from movements that display over-emotional tendencies such as [[Word of Faith]], [[Toronto Blessing]], [[Brownsville Revival]] and [[Todd Bentley]] revivals.{{fact|date=October 2008}}

Reformed Charismatics, though convinced believers in the modern practice of all of the gifts of the Spirit, attempt to keep the primary focus on the cross of Christ, and the gospel.{{fact|date=October 2008}}

===Orthodox===
The Charismatic Movement in the Eastern Orthodox Church never exerted the influence that it did in other mainstream churches. Individual priests, such as Fr. James Tavralides, Fr. Constantine Monios and Fr. David Buss, Fr. [[Athanasius Emmert]] of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese, Fr. [[Eusebius Stephanou]] of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North America, founder of the Brotherhood of St. Symeon the New Theologian and editor of "The Logos", and Fr. [[Boris Zabrodsky]] of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] in America, founder of the Service Committee for Orthodox Spiritual Renewal (SCOSR) which published "[[Theosis]]" Newsletter, were some of the more prominent leaders of the charismatic renewal in Orthodoxy.

===Roman Catholicism===
{{main|Catholic Charismatic Renewal}}

Since 1967 the Charismatic Movement has been active within the [[Roman Catholic Church]].{{fact|date=October 2008}}In the [[USA]] the [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]] was focused in individuals like [[Kevin Ranaghan]] and others at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]].  The Roman Catholic Duquesne University in Pittsburgh began hosting charismatic revivals in 1977.

[[Pope John Paul II]] was reputed to have had a charismatic priest as his personal pastor{{Fact|date=October 2008}} although there is little evidence that the Pope himself was "charismatic" or spoke in tongues{{Fact|date=May 2008}}. On many occasions he was reported as saying "long life to the charismatics".{{when?}}

Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) has added his voice to Pope John Paul II in acknowledging the good occurring in the Charismatic Renewal and providing some cautions.{{when?}}{{fact|date=October 2008}}

In a forward to a 1983 book by [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Léon Joseph Cardinal Suenens]], at that time the Pope's delegate to the Charismatic Renewal{{what?}}, the Prefect{{what?}} comments on the Post-Conciliar{{what?}} period stating, {{cquote|At the heart of a world imbued with a rationalistic skepticism, a new experience of the Holy Spirit suddenly burst forth. And, since then, that experience has assumed a breadth of a worldwide Renewal movement. What the New Testament tells us about the Charisms - which were seen as visible signs of the coming of the Spirit - is not just ancient history, over and done with, for it is once again becoming extremely topical.}} and
{{cquote|to those responsible for the ecclesiastical ministry - from parish priests to bishops - not to let the Renewal pass them by but to welcome it fully; and on the other (hand) ... to the members of the Renewal to cherish and maintain their link  with the whole Church and with the Charisms of their pastors.

In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, the movement became particularly popular in the Filipino and Hispanic communities of the United States, in [[the Philippines]] itself, and in [[Latin America]], mainly [[Brazil]]. Travelling priests and lay people associated with the movement often visit parishes and sing what are known as charismatic masses. It is thought to be the second largest distinct sub-movement within Roman Catholicism, along with [[Traditional Catholicism]]. It presents a difficult situation for many Church authorities, who, as always, must be careful to admit innovation only where it is clear the innovation is consistent with the [[Bible]] and the teachings of the Church.

A further difficulty is the tendency for many charismatic Catholics to take on what others in the Roman Church might consider sacramental language and assertions of the necessity of "Baptism in the Holy Spirit," as a universal act.  This causes difficulty as there is little to distinguish the "Baptism" from the sacrament of confirmation.<ref>McDonnell, Killian & Montague, George T. ''Christian Initiation and Baptism in the Holy Spirit: Evidence from the First Eight Centuries.'' Michael Glazier Books: 1994, Collegeville, MN</ref>

The ''Compendium to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' states:<blockquote>

160. What are Charisms? 799-801. Charisms are special gifts of the Holy Spirit which are bestowed on individuals for the good of others, the needs of the world, and in particular for the building up of the Church. The discernment of charisms is the responsibility of the Magisterium.
</blockquote>

A minority of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] today are charismatic. They are strongly associated with those holding more [[Progressive Adventism|"progressive" Adventist beliefs]]. In the early decades of the church charismatic or ecstatic phenomena were commonplace.<ref>{{cite web
