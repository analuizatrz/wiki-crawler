{{Islam}}
A '''mosque''' is a [[place of worship]] for followers of [[Islam]]. [[Muslims]] often refer to the mosque by its Arabic name, ''masjid'', {{lang-ar| مسجد}} — {{pronounced|ˈmæsʤɪd}} (pl. ''masājid'', {{lang-ar| مساجد}} — {{IPA|/mæˈsæːʤɪd/}}). The word "mosque" in English refers to all types of buildings dedicated for Islamic worship, although there is a distinction in Arabic between the smaller, privately owned mosque and the larger, "collective" mosque ({{lang-ar| جامع}}, ''masjid jāmiʕ''), which has more community and social amenities.

The primary purpose of the mosque is to serve as a place where Muslims can come together for [[salat|prayer]] and some other activities of their life (i.e, a centre for information, education, and dispute settlement). The [[Imam]] leads the prayer. Nevertheless, mosques are known around the world nowadays for their general importance to the [[ummah|Muslim community]] as well as their demonstration of [[Islamic architecture]]. They have developed significantly from the open-air spaces that were the [[Quba Mosque]] and [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] in the [[7th century|seventh century]]. Today, many mosques have elaborate domes, [[minaret]]s, and prayer halls. Mosques originated on the [[Arabian Peninsula]], but are now found in all inhabited continents. They are not only places for worship and prayer, but also places to learn about Islam and meet fellow believers.

== Etymology ==
{{wiktionary|Mosque}}

The Arabic word ''masjid'' means ''place of worship'' and is a noun of place from the verb ''sajada'' ([[root (linguistics)|root]] "s-j-d," meaning "to bow" or "to kneel") in reference to the prostrations performed during [[salat|Islamic prayers]]. Either the word ''masjid'' itself or at least the verb from which it is derived was borrowed from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. The word "m-s-g-d" is attested in Aramaic as early as the 5th century BCE, and the same word is later found in [[Nabataeans|Nabataean]] inscriptions with the meaning "place of worship"; apparently, this Aramaic word originally meant "[[stele]]" or "sacred pillar".<ref name="Masdjid1">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]], E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Masdjid. I. In the central Islamic lands | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | id = {{ISSN|1573-3912}} }}</ref>. The same root exists also in [[Hebrew]],(ס-ג-ד), meaning "to worship".

The modern-day English word "mosque", just like its equivalents in many other [[Europe]]an languages, derives from the word ''masjid'' via [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''mezquita''.<ref name="Masdjid1" /> The pre-cursors of the word "mosque" appeared during the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries and "Moseak", "muskey", "moschy", and "mos'keh" were just some of the variations that came into use until it was decided that "mosquee", imitating [[Middle French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Spanish language|Old Spanish]], would become the standard. In the early 18th century, the modern spelling became the most popular and standard spelling of the word.<ref>[http://m-w.com/dictionary/mosque mosque - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>'''

== Mosque in Islamic texts ==

The word ''masjid'' is found throughout the [[Qur'an]], most frequently with reference to the [[Kaaba]] sanctuary in [[Mecca]]. The Qur'an applies the term "masjid" to places of worship of different religions, including [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]; in the same general meaning of a place of worship, the word is used in the [[hadith]] (collections of Muslim traditions about the deeds and saying of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and his [[sahaba|companions]]).<ref name="Masdjid1" />

== History ==

Grand entryways and tall towers, or [[minaret]]s, have long been and continue to be closely associated with mosques. However, the first three mosques were very simple open spaces on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Mosques evolved significantly over the next 1,000 years, acquiring their now-distinctive features and adapting to cultures around the world.

=== The First Mosques ===

According to Islamic beliefs, the first mosque was the [[Kaaba]], whose existing foundation was raised up by [[Ibrahim]] and his son [[Islamic view of Ishmael|Ismail]], upon an order from [[God]]. The site of the Kaaba is also believed to be the place where a tent was erected by angels for Adam and Eve to use for worship. The oldest mosque built by Muslims is the [[Quba Mosque]] in [[Medina]]. When Muhammad lived in [[Mecca]], he viewed Kaaba as his first and principal mosque and performed prayers there together with his followers.

[[Image:Masjid Nabawi. Medina, Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|left|The Prophet's Mosque in Medina as it exists today.]]

Even during times when the pagan [[Arabs]] performed their rituals inside the Kaaba, Muhammad always held the Kaaba in very high esteem. The Meccan tribe of [[Quraish]], which was responsible for guarding the Kaaba, attempted to exclude Muhammad's followers from the sanctuary, which became a subject of Muslim complaints recorded in the Qur'an.<ref name="Masdjid1" /> When Muhammad conquered Mecca in 630, he converted the Kaaba to a mosque, the [[Masjid al-Haram]] (Sacred Mosque). This mosque was significantly expanded and improved in the early centuries of Islam in order to accommodate the increasing number of Muslims who either lived in the area or made the annual [[Hajj]], or pilgrimage, to Mecca, before it acquired its present shape in 1577 in the reign of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]] [[Selim II]].<ref name="Haram">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Weinsinck| first = A.J | editor = P.J.

Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Masdjid al-Haram. | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | id = ISSN 1573-3912}}</ref>

The first thing Muhammad did upon arriving with his followers near [[Medina]] (then named ''Yathrib'') after the [[Hijra (Islam)|emigration from Mecca]] in 622 was build the [[Quba Mosque]] in a village outside Medina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hajinformation.com/main/h2022.htm |publisher=Ministry of Hajj - Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|accessdate=2006-04-15 |title=Masjid Quba'}}</ref> Muslims believe he stayed at the Quba Masjid for three days before moving on to Medina.<ref name="first-state">{{cite book|title=The Prophet Mohammad and the First Muslim State|last=Ghali|first=Mohammad|accessdate=2006-04-07| url= http://www.alazhr.com/lib/first-muslim-states/allch1/allCHAPTER1.html|chapter=The First Muslim State}}</ref>

[[Image:Al aqsa moschee 2.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], built on top of the [[Temple Mount]], is the third holiest mosque in Islam.]]

Just days after beginning work on the Quba Mosque, Muhammad went on to establish another mosque in Medina, the [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] (Prophet's Mosque). The location of the mosque was declared after it hosted Muhammad's first [[jumuah|Friday prayer]]. Following its establishment, the Prophet's Mosque continued some of the practices now considered common in today's mosques. For example, the call to prayer (''[[adhan]]''), was developed in the form still used in mosque today. The Masjid al-Nabawi was built with a large courtyard, a motif common among mosques built since then. Muhammad would stand up at one end of the [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] to preach. Later on, he would develop a three-step [[pulpit]] as a platform from which he would give sermons.<ref name="first-state" /> The pulpit, now known as a [[minbar]], is still a common feature of masjids.

Muhammad lived beside the mosque in Medina, which doubled as both a religious and political center for the early Muslim community. Negotiations were conducted, military actions planned, prisoners of war held, disputes settled, religious information disseminated, gifts received and distributed among his companions. His followers treated the wounded there and some people even lived in the mosque permanently in tents and huts.<ref name="Masdjid1" />

Today, the [[Masjid al-Haram]] in Mecca, the [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] in [[Medina]] and [[Al Aqsa mosque|Al Aqsa]] in [[Jerusalem]] are considered the three holiest sites in Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/OTTOMAN/ORIGIN.HTM|title=The Ottoman: Origins|accessdate=2006-04-15|publisher=Washington State University}}</ref>

=== Diffusion and evolution ===

Mosques were built outside the Arabian Peninsula as Muslims moved to other parts of the world. [[Egypt]] became occupied by Muslim [[Arab]]s as early as 640, and since then so many mosques have appeared throughout the country that its [[Capital|capital city]], [[Cairo]], has acquired the nickname of ''city of a thousand minarets''.<ref>{{cite web|url=travel.independent.co.uk/africa/article253491.ece |title=Cairo, Egypt |accessdate=2007-09-22 |publisher=The Independent}}</ref> Egyptian mosques vary in amenities, as some have Islamic schools (''[[madrassa]]s'') while others have hospitals or tombs.<ref>{{cite book|title=Budge's Egypt: A Classic 19th Century Travel Guide |last=Budge |first=E.A.

[[Image:Chinese-style minaret of the Great Mosque.jpg|right|upright|thumb|The [[minaret]] at the [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]], [[China]]]]

The first [[China|Chinese]] mosque was established in the [[8th century|eighth century]] in [[Xi'an]]. The [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]], whose current building dates from the [[18th century|eighteenth century]], does not replicate many of the features often associated with traditional mosques. Instead, it follows traditional [[Chinese architecture]]. It is distinguished from other buildings by its green roof (Buddhist temples are often built with a yellow roof). Mosques in western [[China]] incorporate more traditional elements seen in mosques in other parts of the world. Western Chinese mosques were more likely to incorporate [[minaret]]s and domes while eastern Chinese mosques were more likely to look like [[pagoda]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198504/muslims.in.china-the.mosques.htm|accessdate=2006-04-08|last=Cowen|first=Jill S.|date=July/August 1985|pages=30–35|publisher=Saudi Aramco World|title=Muslims in China: The Mosque}}</ref>

By the fifteenth century, Islam had become the dominant religion in [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]'s two most populous islands. As with Hinduism and Buddhism before it, the new religion and its accompanying foreign influences were absorbed and reinterpreted, with mosques given a unique Indonesian/Javanese interpretation. At the time, Javanese mosques took many design cues from [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], and even [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]] architectural influences. They lacked, for example, the ubiquitous Islamic [[dome]] which did not appear in Indonesia until the 19th century, but had tall timber, multi-level [[roof]]s not too dissimilar to the [[pagodas]] of [[Balinese]] [[Hindu temples]] still common today. A number of significant early mosques survive, particularly along the north coast of Java. These include the ''[[Masjid Agung Demak|Mesjid Agung]]'' in [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], built in 1474, and the Grand Mosque of [[Yogyakarta]] that feature multi-level roofs. Javanese styles in turn influenced the architectural styles of mosques among Indonesia's Austronesian neighbors: [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and the [[southern Philippines]].

[[Image:GD-FR-Paris-Mosquée012.JPG|thumb|[[Paris Mosque|The Great Mosque of Paris]].|left|upright]]
Mosques diffused into [[India]] during the reign of the [[Mughal empire]] in the [[16th century|sixteenth]] and [[17th century|seventeenth]] centuries. The Mughals brought their own form of architecture that included pointed, onion-shaped domes, as seen in [[Delhi]]'s [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]].

Mosques first arrived in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (mostly present-day [[Turkey]]) during the [[11th century|eleventh century]], when many local [[Turkish people|Turks]] converted to [[Islam]]. Several of the first mosques in the Ottoman Empire, such as the [[Hagia Sophia]] in present-day [[Istanbul]], were originally [[Church (building)|churches]] or [[cathedral]]s in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Ottoman Dynasty|The Ottomans]] created their own design of mosques, which included large central domes, multiple [[minaret]]s, and open [[facade|façades]]. The Ottoman style of mosques usually included elaborate columns, aisles, and high ceilings in the interior, while incorporating traditional elements, such as the [[mihrab]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ccds.charlotte.nc.us/History/MidEast/04/Jpitts/Jpitts.htm|accessdate=2006-04-07|title=Mosques|publisher=Charlotte Country Day School}}</ref> Today, [[Turkey]] is still home to many mosques that display this Ottoman style of architecture.

Mosques gradually diffused to different parts of [[Europe]], but the most rapid growth in the number of mosques has occurred within the past century as more Muslims have migrated to the continent. Major European cities, such as [[Rome]], [[London]], and [[Munich]], are home to mosques that feature traditional domes and [[minaret]]s. These large mosques in urban centers are supposed to serve as community and [[social center]]s for a large group of Muslims that occupy the region. However, one can still find smaller mosques in more suburban and rural regions throughout Europe where Muslims populate. There are 40,000 to 50,000 mosques in the United States and Islam is the fastest growing religion there.<ref name="saudi-arm">{{cite news|url= http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198504/muslims.in.china-the.mosques.htm |accessdate=2006-04-17 |last=Lawton |first=John|date=January/February 1979|pages=9–14 |org=Saudi Aramco World |title=Muslims in Europe: The Mosque}}</ref> Mosques first appeared in the [[United States of America|United States]] in the early [[20th century|twentieth century]], the first of which was built in the late 1920s in [[Cedar Rapids]], [[Iowa]]. However, as more immigrants continue to arrive in the country, especially from [[South Asia]], the number of American mosques is increasing faster than ever before. Whereas only two percent of the country's mosques appeared in the United States before 1950, eighty-seven percent of American mosques were founded after 1970 and fifty percent of American mosques founded after 1980.<ref name="mosquesinamerica">{{Cite paper | coauthors=Bagby, Ihsan; Perl, Paul M.; and Froehle, Bryan T. | title=The Mosque in America: A National Portrait | publisher=[[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] | date=2001 | url=http://www.cair-net.org/mosquereport/Masjid_Study_Project_2000_Report.pdf | accessdate=2006-04-17}}</ref>

=== Conversion of places of worship ===

[[Image:Omayyad mosque.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]] was a [[Byzantine]] church before the Islamic conquest of the Levant. Some ecclesiastical elements are still evident.]]

According to early [[Muslim historians]], towns that surrendered without resistance and made treaties with the Muslims received permission to retain their [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[synagogue]]s, One of the earliest examples of these kinds of conversions was in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], where in 705 [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik]] took the church of [[John the Baptist|St. John]] from the Christians and had it rebuilt as a mosque, which is now known as [[Umayyad Mosque]]; overall, Abd al-Malik is said to have transformed 10 churches in Damascus into mosques. The process of turning churches into mosques was especially intensive in the villages. The [[Abbasid]] caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] turned many churches into mosques. [[Ottoman Turks]] converted into mosques nearly all churches, monasteries, and chapels in [[Constantinople]], including the famous [[Hagia Sophia]], immediately after [[fall of Constantinople|capturing the city in 1453]]. In some instances mosques have been established on the places of Jewish or Christian sanctuaries associated with [[Bible|Biblical]] personalities who were also recognized by Islam.<ref name="Masdjid1" /> Muslim rulers in India built mosques seeing their actions as fulfillment of a religious duty. <!-- why is this sentence in this section?? -->

On the other hand, mosques have also been converted for use by other religions, notably in southern Spain, following the conquest of the [[Moors]] in 1492.<ref>{{cite book|title=How Islam Plans to Change the World |last=Wagner |first=William |origdate=[[2004-05-27]] |accessdate=2006-06-22 |publisher=Kregel Publications |page=99 |quote=When the Moors were driven out of Spain in 1492, most of the mosques were converted into churches |id=ISBN 0-8254-3965-5}}</ref> The most prominent of them is the [[Mezquita|Great Mosque of Cordoba]]. The [[Iberian Peninsula]], Southeast [[Europe]], and [[India]] (the [[Babri Masjid]] incident) are other regions in the world where such instances occurred once no longer under Muslim rule.

== Religious functions ==
=== Prayers ===
[[Image:Mosque.Qibla.01.jpg|thumb|Muslims performing [[salat]] at the [[Umayyad Mosque]].]]
{{contradict}}
All adult Muslims, with exceptions for the infirm, are required to offer  ''[[Salat]]'' prayers five times daily. Most mosques will organise a formal time of prayer for each of the daily timeslots. In addition to holding the daily prayers, mosques hold weekly ''[[jumuah]]'' [[sabbath]] services, which replace the midday prayer on Fridays. While daily prayers can be performed anywhere, it is required to attend Friday prayers at the mosque.<ref name="teach-islam">{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Islam |last=Maqsood |first=Ruqaiyyah Waris |id=ISBN 0-07-141963-2 |date=[[2003-04-22]] |edition=2nd edition |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=57–8, 72–5, 112–120 |location=Chicago}}</ref>

The mosque is the centre of the Islamic community, illustrating the idea of brotherhood and [[Iman (concept)|iman]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muwatta/008.mmt.html|title=Prayer in Congregation|publisher=University of Southern California|work=Compendium of Muslim Texts|accessdate=2006-04-06}}</ref>

A funeral prayer, or [[Salatul janazah|salat ul-janazah]], is held for a deceased Muslim at the mosque, with all congregants present, including the [[imam]], participating. Unlike the daily prayers, the funeral prayers are normally held outdoors in a courtyard or square close to the mosque.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/law/fiqhussunnah/fus4_62.html |title=Fiqh-us-Sunnah, Volume 4: Funeral Prayers (Salatul Janazah)|publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts |accessdate=2006-04-16}}</ref> During [[eclipse]]s, mosques will host special prayers called [[Sunnah salat#Qusuf and Khusuf|eclipse prayers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/018.sbt.html |title=Eclipses |publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts |accessdate=2006-04-16}}</ref>

There are two large holidays (''Eids'') in the [[Islamic calendar]], [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]] during which there are special prayers held at mosques in the morning. These [[Salat al Eid|Eid prayers]] are supposed to be offered in large groups, and so larger mosques will normally host them for their congregants as well as the congregants of smaller local mosques. Some mosques will even rent [[convention center]]s or other large public buildings to hold the large number of Muslims who attend. Mosques, especially those in countries where Muslims are the majority, will also host Eid prayers outside in courtyards or [[town square]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/prayer/Eid-Prayers_1.html |accessdate=2006-04-08 |title='Id Prayers (Salatul 'Idain) |publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts}}</ref>

=== Ramadan events ===

[[Image:Sabancimosque19082006.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Sabancı Mosque]] is the largest mosque in Turkey.]]

{{see also|Ramadan}}

Islam's holiest month, [[Ramadan]], is observed through many events. As Muslims must [[sawm|fast]] during the day during Ramadan, mosques will host ''[[iftar]]'' dinners after sunset and the fourth required prayer of the day, [[maghrib]]. Food is provided, at least in part, by members of the community, thereby creating nightly [[potluck]] dinners. Because of the community contribution necessary to serve iftar dinners, mosques with smaller congregations may not be able to host the ''iftar'' dinners daily. Some mosques will also hold ''[[suhoor]]'' meals before [[dawn]] to congregants attending the first required prayer of the day, [[fajr]]. As with iftar dinners, congregants usually provide the food for suhoor, although able mosques may provide food instead. Mosques will often invite poorer members of the Muslim community to share in beginning and breaking the fasts, as providing [[Alms|charity]] during Ramadan is regarded in Islam as especially honorable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_51.html| accessdate=2006-04-17| title=Charity| publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts}}</ref>

Following the last obligatory daily prayer ([[isha]]) special, optional [[tarawih]] prayers are offered in larger mosques. During each night of prayers, which can last for up to two hours each night, usually one member of the community who has memorized the entire [[Qur’an]] will recite a segment of the book.<ref name="teach-islam" /> Sometimes, several such people (not necessarily of the local community) take turns to do this. During the last ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques will host all-night programs to observe [[Laylat al-Qadr]], the night Muslims believe the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] first received Qur'anic revelations.<ref name="teach-islam" /> On that night, between [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]], mosques employ speakers to educate congregants in attendance about Islam. Mosques or the community usually provide meals periodically throughout the night.

During the last ten days of [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]], larger mosques within the Muslim community will host [[Itikaf|i'tikaf]], a practice in which at least one Muslim man from the community must participate. Muslims performing i'tikaf are required to stay within the mosque for ten consecutive days, often in worship or learning about [[Islam]]. As a result, the rest of the Muslim community is responsible for providing the participants with food, drinks, and whatever else they need during their stay.<ref name="teach-islam" />

=== Charity ===

The third of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]] states that Muslims are required to give approximately one-fortieth of their wealth to charity as ''[[zakat]]''. Since mosques form the center of Muslim communities, they are where Muslims go to both give zakat and, if necessary, collect it. Prior to the holiday of [[Eid ul-Fitr]], mosques also collect a special zakat that is supposed to assist in helping poor Muslims attend the prayers and celebrations associated with the holiday.

=== Center of Muslim community ===

[[Image:Naghsh-e-jahan masjed-e-shah esfahan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Imam Mosque]], formerly [[Shah Mosque]] along [[Naghsh-i Jahan Square]] in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Iran]]]]

Many Muslim rulers after the death of the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], emulating him, established their domains by first building a mosque. In the same way [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] are built around the [[Masjid Al-Haram]] and the [[Masjid Al-Nabawi]], [[Karbala]], in present-day [[Iraq]], was built around the [[Imam Hussain Shrine]]. [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Iran]] is especially notable for its use of mosques to form the center of the city. In the [[8th century|eighth century]], a mosque was established within the city which three centuries later was described by theologian and philosopher [[Naser Khosrow]] as "a magnificent [[Friday Mosque]] built in the city center."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.planum.net/topics/documents/planning_isfahan.pdf|author=Abouei, Reza|accessdate=2006-04-07|publisher=University of Sheffield School of Architecture|title=Urban Planning of Isfahan in the Seventeenth Century|format=PDF}}</ref> At the dawn of the [[17th century|seventeenth century]], [[Abbas I of Safavid|Shah Abbas I]] of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Dynasty]] led an effort to establish Isfahan as one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the world. As part of his plan, he ordered the building of [[Shah Mosque]] and [[Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque]] which border Isfahan's [[Naghsh-i Jahan Square]], which, as one of the largest city squares in the world, hosted sports and trade.<ref>{{cite book|title=Public and Private Spaces of the City |last=Madanipour |first=Ali |date=[[2003-05-09]] |id=ISBN 0-415-25629-1 |publisher=Routledge |pages=207}}</ref>

Mosques built more recently, especially in countries where Muslims are not the majority, tend to be away from the center of major cities. Nevertheless, even a mosque in a less densely populated area often influences Muslims to relocate their homes and businesses so they are close to the mosque. Thus, mosques form the focal points of Muslim communities, even if they do not form the center of the entire community as a whole. In the [[United States of America|United States]], the growth in the number of mosques and congregants in suburbs is much greater than that in densely [[urban area]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Washington Quarterly|last=Abdo|first=Geneive|pages=7–17|volume=28|issue=4|year=2005|accessdate=2006-04-07|title= Islam in America: Separate but Unequal|month=September|url= http://www.imancentral.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=57|doi= 10.1162/0163660054798717 }}</ref>

=== Education ===

[[Image:Storks samarkand.jpg|thumb|right|The Ulugh Beg Madrassa, which includes a mosque, in [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]]]]

Another primary function of a mosque is to house educational facilities. Some mosques, especially those in countries where state-funded [[Madrasah|Islamic schools]] are not present, will have full-time schools that teach both Islamic and general knowledge. These full-time schools normally have students in [[elementary school]] and [[middle school]], although there are also a few full-time schools available to [[high school]] students. Most mosques also have part-time schools, either on the weekends or in the evenings. Whereas full-time schools are meant for children who depend on the mosque to provide an [[Islamic studies|Islamic education]] as well as a general education, weekend and nightly schools are meant to provide only Islamic education for students of all ages, young and old. Some mosques, however, will also provide general educational help to Muslim students as a way of bringing young Muslims closer to the mosque. The subjects at the Islamic evening and weekend classes vary. [[Qur'an reading]] and [[Arabic]] are commonly found at mosques that are located in countries where [[Arabic]] is not widely spoken. Classes for new Muslims about the basics of Islam are also common, especially in [[Europe]] and the [[United States of America|United States]], where it is the fastest-growing religion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Teaching Islam |last=Wheeler |first=Brannon M. |publisher=Oxford University Press US |date=[[2002-08-01]] |id=ISBN 0-19-515225-5 |chapter=Preface |pages=v |quote=and [Islam] remains the fastest growing religion both in the United States and worldwide}}</ref> Mosques will also go into more depth about Islam by providing congregants with classes on [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]]. [[Madrassa]]s are also available for Muslims to study ''[['alim]]'' to become [[Islamic scholar]]s or [[imam]]s. However, as their primary purpose is not to serve as a place of worship or [[community center]], madrassas are normally separate from neighborhood mosques.

=== Events and fundraising ===

[[Image:Great Mosque of Djenné 1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Great Mosque of Djenné]] is host to an annual festival.]]

Mosques host events and dinners either for [[fundraising|raising money]] for mosque activities or simply to bring the community together and [[bazaar]]s where community members can shop for Islamic merchandise are common among mosques. Mosques also host [[wedding]]s, much like other places of worship.<ref name="teach-islam" />

One particularly interesting illustration of this community involvement is that of the mosque in [[Djenné]], [[Mali]] where, during an annual festival, the community takes part in the re-applying of plaster to the exterior of the [[adobe|mud brick]] building (the largest of its kind in the world).

== Contemporary political roles ==
{{see also|Political aspects of Islam}}

The late [[20th century|twentieth century]] saw an increase in the number of mosques used for political purposes. Today, civic participation is commonly promoted in mosques in the [[Western world]]. Because of the importance in the community, mosques are used for preaching [[Peaceful coexistence|peaceful co-existence]] with non-believers, even in times of adversity.

=== Advocacy ===

[[Image:Mesquita de Cuiabá.jpg|thumb|right|Mosque in [[Cuiabá]], [[Brazil]].]]

Countries with a minority Muslim population are more likely than Muslim-majority countries of the [[Greater Middle East]] to use mosques as a way to promote civic participation.<ref name="tc">{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.edu/muslim-nyc/research/projects/role%20of%20muslims.html |publisher=Teachers' College – Columbia University |title=The Role of Mosques in the Civic and Political Incorporation of Muslim American |last=Jamal |first=Amany |accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref> American mosques host [[voter registration]] and civic participation drives that promote involving Muslims, who are often first- or second-generation immigrants, in the political process.

Beginning in the late twentieth century and continuing into the early [[21st century|twenty-first century]], a small number of mosques have also become the platforms of some extremist [[imams]] to advocate [[terrorism]] and [[Islamic fundamentalism|extreme Islamic ideals]]. [[Finsbury Park Mosque]] in [[London]] is exemplary of a mosque that has been used in this manner.

=== Social conflict ===

[[Image:Babri rearview.jpg|right|thumb|The 16th Century [[Babri Mosque]] in [[India]] was destroyed by right-wing Hindu extremists in 1992.]]

{{see also|Babri Masjid|Islamophobia|Israeli-Palestinian conflict}}

As they are considered important to the Muslim community, mosques, like other places of worship, can be at the heart of social conflicts.

[[Babri Mosque]] was the subject of such a conflict up until the [[1990s|early 1990s]] when it was demolished. Before a mutual solution could be devised, the mosque was destroyed by approximately 200,000 Hindus on [[December 6]], [[1992]] as the mosque was built by [[Babur]] allegedly on the site of a previous [[Hindu temple]] marking the birthplace of [[Ram]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Flashpoint Ayodhya |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0407/abstracts/ayodhya.html |date=July/August 2004 |publisher=Archaeology |last=Romey |first=Kristen M.}}</ref> The controversy surrounded the mosque was directly linked to [[Bombay Riots|rioting]] in Bombay (present-day [[Mumbai]]) as well as [[1993 Mumbai bombings|bombings in 1993]] that killed 257 people.

A [[al-Askari Mosque bombing (2006)|February 2006 bombing]] that seriously damaged Iraq's [[Al Askari Mosque|al-Askari Mosque]], exacerbated tensions that had already existed. Other mosque bombings in [[Iraq]], both before and after the February 2006 bombing, have been part of the conflict between the country's groups of Muslims. However, mosque bombings have not been exclusive to Iraq; in June 2005, a [[suicide attack|suicide bomber]] killed at least 19 people at an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] mosque.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/01/AR2005060100263.html |date=[[2006-06-02]] |accessdate=2006-04-23 |title=Suicide Bomber Kills 20 in Afghan Mosque |publisher=The Washington Post |page=A16 |last=Aizenman |first=N.C.}}</ref> In April 2006, [[2006 Jama Masjid explosions|two explosions]] occurred at [[India]]'s [[Jama Masjid]].

Although the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] involvement in mosques around the world can be traced back to the 1960s, it was not until later in the [[20th century|twentieth century]] that the government of Saudi Arabia became a large influence in foreign mosques.<ref name="money-trails">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A13266-2004Aug18 |title=U.S. Eyes Money Trails of Saudi-Backed Charities |date=[[2004-08-19]] |accessdate=2007-02-24|last=Ottoway |first=David B. |page=A1 |publisher=The Washington Post}}</ref> Beginning in the 1980s, the Saudi Arabian government began to finance the construction of mosques in countries around the world.

== Architecture ==
=== Styles ===

[[Image:Mosquee ennasr.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The ''Mosquée Ennasr'' mosque in [[Ariana, Tunisia|Ariana]] has a futurist architecture]]The architecture of mosques are a continuation of pre-Islamic architecture of palaces built during the Parthian and Sassanian dynasties of Persia. The Sarvestan palace from the Sassanian era is a great example of this. For example, the idea of having an arched entrance and a central dome is clearly one borrowed from pre-Islamic, Persian architecture. After the Arab invasion of Persia, this architecture, as well as elements of Sassanian culture, was used for the new [[Muslim|Islamic world]]. Many forms of mosques have evolved in different regions of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]. Notable mosque types include the early [[Abbasid]] mosques, T-type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of [[Anatolia]]. The [[Petroleum|oil]]-wealth of the twentieth century drove a great deal of mosque construction using designs from leading non-Muslim modern architects and promoting the careers of important contemporary Muslim architects.

[[Image:AbujaMosque.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Abuja]] National Mosque, [[Nigeria]]]]

''Arab-plan'' or [[hypostyle]] mosques are the earliest type of mosques, pioneered under the [[Umayyad Dynasty]]. These mosques have square or rectangular plans with an enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Historically, in the warm Mediterranean and Middle Eastern climates, the courtyard served to accommodate the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat roofs on prayer halls, which required the use of numerous [[column]]s and [[support]]s.<ref name="Masdjid1" /> One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the [[Mezquita de Córdoba]] in [[Spain]], the building being supported by over 850 columns.<ref name = "mit-handout"/> Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] so that visitors can enjoy the shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and [[Abbasid]] dynasties; subsequently, however, the simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, the mosques consequently losing popularity.<ref name="Masdjid1" />

[[Image:Jami-Ul-Alfar.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The ''Jami Ul Alfar'' mosque in [[Colombo]] [[Sri Lanka]] has striking Moorish and Colonial architecture with a candy-striped facade]]
[[Image:JamiahMasjid2.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The ''Jamiah Masjid''  in [[Tamilnadu]], [[South India]] has Dravidian style of architecture]]

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] introduced ''central dome mosques'' in the [[15th century|fifteenth century]] and have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having a large central dome, a common feature is smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, where prayer is not performed.<ref name="mit-vocab">{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Vocabulary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}</ref> This style was heavily influenced by the [[Byzantine]] [[religious architecture]] with its use of large central domes.<ref name="Masdjid1" />

''Iwan mosques'' are most notable for their domed chambers and ''[[iwan]]s'', vaulted spaces opening out at one end. In ''iwan'' mosques, one or more iwans face a central courtyard that serves as the prayer hall. The style represents a borrowing from pre-Islamic [[Iranian architecture]] and has been used almost exclusively for mosques in [[Iran]].

Hajja Soad's mosque took a [[pyramid]] shape which is a creative style in Islamic architecture.

=== Minarets ===
{{main|Minaret}}

[[Image:Somaliamosque11.jpg|thumb|The Islamic Solidarity Mosque in [[Mogadishu]] with a tall [[minaret]].]]

A common feature in mosques is the minaret, the tall, slender tower that usually is situated at one of the corners of the mosque structure. The top of the minaret is always the highest point in mosques that have one, and often the highest point in the immediate area. The tallest minaret in the world is located at the [[Hassan II Mosque]] in [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Call to Prayer: My Travels in Spain, Portugal and Morocco |last=Walters |first=Brian |date=[[2004-05-17]] |publisher=Virtualbookworm Publishing |id=ISBN 1-58939-592-1 |pages=14 |chapter=The Prophet's People |quote=Its 210-meter minaret is the tallest in the world}}</ref>

The first mosques had no minarets, and even nowadays the most conservative Islamic movements, like [[Wahhabism|Wahhabis]], avoid building minarets, seeing them as ostentatious and unnecessary. The first minaret was constructed in 665 in [[Basra]] during the reign of the [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]] [[Muawiyah I]]. Muawiyah encouraged the construction of minarets, as they were supposed to bring mosques on par with [[Christian]] [[Church (building)|churches]] with their [[bell tower]]s. Consequently, mosque architects borrowed the shape of the bell tower for their minarets, which were used for essentially the same purpose — calling the faithful to prayer.<ref name="Manara">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]], E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Manara, Manar | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | id = ISSN 1573-3912}}</ref>

Before the five required daily prayers, a [[muezzin]] calls the worshippers to [[salat|prayer]] from the [[minaret]]. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims are not the majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the call to prayer (''[[adhan]]''), although it is supposed to be said loudly to the surrounding community. The adhan is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a muezzin for each prayer to say the [[adhan]] as it is a recommended practice or [[sunnah]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. At mosques that do not have minarets, the adhan is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground.<ref name="teach-islam" /> The [[iqama]], which is similar to the [[adhan]] and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not said from the minaret even if a mosque has one.

=== Domes ===

[[Image:Khatem Al Anbiyaa Mosque Detail.jpg|thumb|The domes of the Khatem Al Anbiyaa Mosque in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]].]]

The domes, often placed directly above the main prayer hall, may signify the vaults of [[jannah|heaven]] and the sky.<ref>{{cite book|title=Symmetries of Nature: A Handbook for Philosophy of Nature and Science |last=Mainzer |first=Klaus |date=[[1996-06-01]] |id=ISBN 3-11-012990-6 |pages=124 |chapter=Art and Architecture |quote=the dome arching over the believers like the spherical dome of the sky}}</ref> As time progressed, dome grew, from occupying a small part of the roof near the [[mihrab]] to encompassing the whole roof above the prayer hall. Although domes normally took on the shape of a hemisphere, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in [[India]] popularized onion-shaped domes in [[South Asia]] and [[Persia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Architecture of Mughal India |last=Asher |first=Catherine B. |date=[[1992-09-24]] |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=256 |id=ISBN 0-521-26728-5 |chapter=Aurangzeb and the Islamization of the Mughal style}}</ref> Some mosques have multiple, often smaller, domes in addition to the main large dome that resides at the center.
Domes in traditional mosques would be used to help the imam project his voice as the sound waves would bounce in and then out of the dome making the voice louder.

=== Prayer hall ===

[[Image:Prayer hall turkei.jpg|upright|left|thumb|The prayer hall, or musalla, in a [[Turkey|Turkish]] mosque, with a [[Minibar]].]]

The prayer hall, also known as the musalla, has no furniture; chairs and pews are absent from the prayer hall so as to allow as many worshippers as possible to line the room.<ref name="unitulsa">{{cite web|url=http://www.utulsa.edu/iss/Mosque/MosqueFAQ.html |accessdate=2006-04-09 |publisher=The University of Tulsa |title=Mosque FAQ}}</ref> Some mosques have [[Arabic calligraphy]] and [[Qur'an]]ic verses on the walls to assist worshippers in focusing on the beauty of Islam and its holiest book, the Qur'an, as well as for decoration.<ref name="teach-islam" />

Usually opposite the entrance to the prayer hall is the ''[[qiblah]] wall'', the visually emphasized area inside the prayer hall. The ''qiblah'' wall should, in a properly oriented mosque, be set perpendicular to a line leading to [[Mecca]], the location of the [[Kaaba]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Writing Signs: Fatimid Public Text |date=[[1998-12-16]] |last=Bierman |first=Irene A. |publisher=University of California Press |pages=150 |id=ISBN 0-520-20802-1}}</ref> Congregants pray in rows parallel to the ''qiblah'' wall and thus arrange themselves so they face [[Mecca]]. In the ''qiblah'' wall, usually at its center, is the [[mihrab]], a niche or depression indicating the direction of [[Mecca]]. Usually the ''mihrab'' is not occupied by furniture either. Sometimes, especially during [[Friday prayer]]s, a raised [[minbar]] or pulpit is located to the side of the ''mihrab'' for a [[khatib]] or some other speaker to offer a sermon ([[khutbah]]). The [[mihrab]] serves as the location where the [[imam]] leads the five daily prayers on a regular basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~islamarc/WebPage1/htm_eng/index/keyword1_e.htm |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Terms 1: Mosque |publisher=University of Tokyo Institute of Oriental Culture}}</ref>

[[Image:Mosque in bourke cemetery nsw australia.jpg|thumb|250px|Primitive heritage mosque in Australian outback contrasts with the grand designs of established Islamic communities. [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]] cemetery, New South Wales]]

=== Ablution facilities ===

As [[Ritual purification#Islam|ritual purification]] precedes all prayers, mosques often have [[wudu|ablution]] fountains or other facilities for washing in their entryways or courtyards. However, worshippers at much smaller mosques often have to use restrooms to perform their ablutions. In traditional mosques, this function is often elaborated into a freestanding building in the center of a courtyard.<ref name="mit-handout">{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/4.614/www/handout02.html |accessdate=2006-04-09 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |title=Religious Architecture and Islamic Cultures}}</ref> This desire for cleanliness extends to the prayer halls where shoes are disallowed to be worn anywhere other than the cloakroom. Thus, foyers with shelves to put shoes and racks to hold coats are commonplace among mosques.<ref name="unitulsa" />

=== Contemporary features ===

Modern mosques have a variety of amenities available to their congregants. As mosques are supposed to appeal to the community, they may also have additional facilities, from [[clinic|health clinics]] to [[library|libraries]] to [[gym]]nasiums, to serve the community.

== Rules and etiquette ==
[[Image:Bayt al Mukarram.jpg|thumb|left|[[Baitul Mukarram]] (Dhaka), the National Mosque of [[Bangladesh]]. 

The structure resembles the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]].]]Mosques, in accordance with [[Islam]]ic practices, institute a number of rules intended to keep Muslims focused on worshipping [[Allah]]. While there are several rules, such as those regarding not allowing shoes in the prayer hall, that are universal, there are many other rules that are dealt with and enforced in a variety of ways from mosque to mosque.

=== Prayer leader ===

Appointment of a prayer leader is considered desirable, but not always obligatory.<ref name="mawardi112">{{cite book | last=Abu al-Hasan Ali Ibn Muhammad Ibn Habib |first=Al-Mawardi |authorlink=Al-Mawardi | title=The Ordinances of Government (''Al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyya w’al-Wilayat al-Diniyya'') | publisher=Garnet Publishing | location=Lebanon | year=2000 | id=ISBN 1-85964-140-7|pages=p. 184}}</ref> The permanent prayer leader ([[imam]]) must be a free honest man and is authoritative in religious matters.<ref name="mawardi112" /> In mosques constructed and maintained by the government, the prayer leader is appointed by the ruler;<ref name="mawardi112" /> in private mosques, however, appointment is made by members of the congregation through [[Simple majority voting|majority voting]]. According to the [[Hanafi]] [[madhhab|school]] of [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], the man who built the mosque has a stronger claim to the title of imam, but this view is not shared by the other schools.<ref name="mawardi112" />

Leadership at prayer falls into three categories, depending on the type of prayer: five daily prayers, Friday prayer, or optional prayers.<ref name="mawardi112" /> According to the Hanafi and [[Maliki]] school of Islamic jurisprudence, appointment of a prayer leader for Friday service is mandatory because otherwise the prayer is invalid. The [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]] schools, however, argue that the appointment is not necessary and the prayer is valid as long as it is performed in a congregation. A slave may lead a Friday prayer, but Muslim authorities disagree over whether the job can be done by a minor.<ref name="mawardi112" /> An imam appointed to lead Friday prayers may also lead at the five daily prayers; [[List of Muslim scholars|Muslim scholars]] agree to the leader appointed for five daily services may lead the Friday service as well.<ref name="mawardi112" />

All Muslim authorities hold the consensus opinion that only men may lead prayer for men.<ref name="mawardi112" /> Nevertheless women prayer leaders are allowed to lead prayer in front of all-female congregations.

=== Cleanliness ===
[[Image:Mosque of Cordoba Spain.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Mezquita]], a [[hypostyle]] former mosque with columns arranged in grid pattern, in [[Córdoba, Spain]].]]
{{see also|Taharah}}

All mosques have rules regarding cleanliness, as it is an essential part of the worshipper's experience. Muslims before prayer are required to cleanse themselves in an ablution process known as ''[[wudu]]''. However, even to those who enter the prayer hall of a mosque without the intention of praying, there are still rules that apply. Shoes must not be worn inside the carpeted prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed to be clean themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something that smells, such as garlic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnipath.com/Resources/PrintMedia/Hadith/H0002P0016.aspx |publisher=SunniPath |work=SunniPath Library |accessdate=2006-07-12 |title=Chapter 16. The Description of the Prayer}}</ref>

=== Dress ===

[[Islam]] requires that its adherents wear [[Islam and clothing|clothes]] that portray [[modesty]]. As a result, although many mosques will not enforce violations, both men and women when attending a mosque must adhere to these guidelines. Men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not reveal the shape of the body. Likewise, it is recommended that women at a mosque wear loose clothing, shirts, pants that cover to the wrists and ankles and cover their heads such as with a [[hijab]]. Many Muslims, regardless of their ethnic background, wear [[Middle East|Middle eastern]] clothing associated with [[Arab]]ic Islam to special occasions and prayers at mosques.<ref name="teach-islam" />

=== Concentration ===

As mosques are [[place of worship|places of worship]], those within the mosque are required to remain respectful to those in [[salat|prayer]]. Loud talking within the mosque, as well as discussion of topics deemed disrespectful, is forbidden in areas where people are praying. In addition, it is disrespectful to walk in front of or otherwise disturb Muslims in prayer.<ref>{{cite paper|author=Connecting Cultures, Inc. |title=Building Cultural Competency: Understanding Islam, Muslims, and Arab Culture |publisher=Connecting Cultures, Inc. |url=http://www.maec.org/2004conferencepapers/ismail.doc |page=p. 15 |format=Doc |accessdate=2006-07-12}}</ref> The walls within the mosque have few items, except for possibly [[Arabic calligraphy]], so Muslims in prayer are not distracted. Muslims are also discouraged from wearing clothing with distracting [[image]]s and [[symbol]]s so as not to divert the attention of those standing behind them during prayer. In many mosques, even the carpeted prayer area has no designs, its plainness helping worshippers to focus.

=== Gender separation ===
[[Image:Islam in India.jpg|thumb|[[Muslims]] praying in the male section of a mosque in [[Srinagar]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]].]]

[[Shari'a|Islamic law]] requires men and women to be separated in the prayer hall; ideally, the women must occupy the rows behind the men. [[Muhammad]] preferred women to pray at home rather than at a mosque, and according to the hadith Muhammad said: "The best mosques for women are the inner parts of their houses", although Muhammad told Muslims not to forbid women from entering mosques. The second [[caliph]] [[Umar I|Umar]] at one time prohibited women from attending mosques especially at night because he feared they may be teased by males, so he required them to pray at home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/humanrelations/womeninislam/womeninsociety.html#mosque |accessdate=2006-04-15 |title=Women in Society |publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts |last=Doi |first=Abdur Rahman I.}}</ref> Sometimes a special part of the mosque was railed off for women; for example, the governor of Mecca in 870 had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women.<ref name="Masdjid1" /> Many mosques today will put the women behind a barrier or partition or in another room. Mosques in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] put men and women in separate rooms, as the divisions were built into them centuries ago. In nearly two-thirds of [[United States of America|American]] mosques, women pray behind partitions or in separate areas, not in the main prayer hall; some mosques do not admit women at all. Although there are sections exclusively for women and children, the [[Masjid al-Haram|Grand Mosque]] in [[Mecca]] is desegregated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.columbiajournalist.org/rw1_dinges/2005/article.asp?subj=national&course=rw1_dinges&id=624 |accessdate=2006-04-09 |date=[[2006-01-26]] |title=Muslim Women Seek More Equitable Role in Mosques |last=Rezk |first=Rawya |publisher=The Columbia Journalist}}</ref>

=== Non-Muslims in mosques ===
[[Image:Hassan II Mosque.jpg|thumb|The [[Hassan II Mosque]] in [[Casablanca]] is one of two mosques in [[Morocco]] open to non-Muslims.]]

Under most interpretations of [[sharia|Islamic law]], non-Muslims may be allowed into mosques, as long as they do not sleep or eat there; the dissenting opinion is presented by followers of the [[Maliki]] [[madhhab|school]] of [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], who argue that non-Muslims may not be allowed into mosques under any circumstances.<ref name="mawardi112" />

The Qur'an addresses the subject of non-Muslims, and particularly [[polytheism|polytheists]], in mosques in two verses in its ninth chapter, [[At-Tawba|Sura At-Tawba]]. The seventeenth verse of the chapter prohibits those who ''join gods with Allah'' — polytheists — from entering mosques:

: ''It is not for such as join gods with Allah, to visit or maintain the mosques of Allah while they witness against their own souls to infidelity. The works of such bear no fruit: In Fire shall they dwell.'' ([[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] {{Quran-usc|9|17}})

The twenty-eighth verse of the same chapter is more specific as it only considers polytheists in the Sacred Mosque, the [[Masjid al-Haram]] in [[Mecca]]:

: ''O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque. And if ye fear poverty, soon will Allah enrich you, if He wills, out of His bounty, for Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.'' ([[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] {{Quran-usc|9|28}})

According to [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], these verses were followed to the letter at the times of Muhammad, when Jews and Christians, considered [[monotheism|monotheists]], were still allowed to the [[Masjid al-Haram]]. However, the Umayyad caliph [[Umar II]] later forbade non-Muslims from entering mosques, and his ruling remained in practice in Saudi Arabia.<ref name="Masdjid1" /> Today, the decision on whether non-Muslims should be allowed to enter mosques varies. With few exceptions, mosques in the Arabian peninsula as well as [[Morocco]] do not allow entry to non-Muslims. For example, the [[Hassan II Mosque]] in [[Casablanca]] is one of only two mosques in Morocco currently open to non-Muslims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/02/25/morocco.travel.ap/index.html|title=Morocco travel|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2006-09-22}}</ref> However, there are also many other places in the west as well as the [[Islamic world]] where non-Muslims are welcome to enter mosques. Most mosques in the [[United States]], for example, report receiving non-Muslim visitors every month.<ref name="mosquesinamerica" /> Many Mosques throughout the United States welcome non-Muslims as a sign of openness to the rest of the community as well as to encourage conversions to Islam.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Takim |first=Liyakatali |month=July |year=2004 |title=From Conversion to Conversation: Interfaith Dialogue in Post 9–11 America |journal=The Muslim World |volume=94 |pages=343–355 |url=http://macdonald.hartsem.edu/articles/mw943f.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2006-06-16 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.2004.00058.x}} [http://www.du.edu/~ltakim/ Liyakatali Takim] is a professor in the Department of [[Religious studies|Religious Studies]] at the [[University of Denver]]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4511780.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2006-06-16 |title=Laptop link-up: A day at the mosque |date=[[2005-12-05]]}}</ref>

In modern-day [[Saudi Arabia]], the Grand Mosque and all of [[Mecca]] are open only to Muslims. Likewise, the [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] and the city of [[Medina]] that surrounds it are also off-limits to those who do not practice [[Islam]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Beliefs & Religions|last=Goring |first=Rosemary |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |date=[[1997-05-01]] |id=ISBN 1-85326-354-0}}</ref> For mosques in other areas, it has most commonly been taken that non-Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims and if they have a legitimate reason. All entrants regardless of [[List of religions|religious affiliation]] are expected to respect the rules and [[decorum]] for mosques.<ref name="teach-islam" />

In modern [[Turkey]] non-Muslim tourists are allowed to enter any mosque, but there are some strict rules. Visiting a mosque is allowed only between prayers; visitors are required to wear long trousers and not to wear shoes, women must cover their heads; visitors are not allowed to interrupt praying Muslims, especially by taking photos of them; no loud talk is allowed; and no references to other religions are allowed (no crosses on necklaces, no cross gestures etc.)

At different times and places, non-Muslims living under Muslim rule were required to demonstrate deference to mosques. In most cities of Morocco, Jews were required to remove their shoes when passing by a mosque<ref>{{cite book | first=Norman | last=Stillman | title=The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book | publisher=Jewish Publication Society of America | location=Philadelphia | year=1979 | id=ISBN 0827601166 |pages=p. 83}}</ref> [[Denmark|Danish]] traveler [[Carsten Niebuhr]] wrote that in 18th century [[Egypt]] Jews and Christians had to dismount before several mosques in veneration of their sanctity.<ref>{{cite book | author=Bat Ye'or| authorlink = Bat Ye'or | title=Islam and Dhimmitude.
