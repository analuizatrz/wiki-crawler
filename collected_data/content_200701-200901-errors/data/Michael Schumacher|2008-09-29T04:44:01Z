After winning two championships with [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]], Michael Schumacher moved to [[Scuderia Ferrari]] in 1996 and won five consecutive drivers' titles with them from 2000&ndash;2004. Schumacher holds many records in Formula One, including most drivers' championships, race victories, fastest laps, [[pole positions]], points scored and most races won in a single season. Schumacher is  the only Formula One driver to have an entire season of podium finishes. His driving sometimes created controversy: he was twice involved in collisions that determined the outcome of the world championship, most notably his disqualification from the [[1997 Formula One season|1997 championship]] for causing a collision with [[Jacques Villeneuve]].<ref>{{cite web

==Early years==
[[Image:Reynard F 903-001 1990 Michael Schuhmacher Formula 3 EMS.jpg|thumb|right|Schumacher's title-winning German [[Formula Three]] car from 1990.]]
Schumacher was born in [[Hürth|Hürth Hermülheim]], to Rolf, a [[bricklayer]], and Elisabeth. When Schumacher was four, his father modified his [[Pedal car|pedal kart]] by adding a small motorcycle engine. After Schumacher crashed it into a lamp post in [[Kerpen]], his parents took him to the local [[karting]] track at Kerpen-Horrem where he became the youngest member of the karting club. His father soon built him a proper kart from discarded parts and at the age of six Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf Schumacher took on a second job renting and repairing karts at the circuit, while his wife worked at the track's canteen stand. Despite the extra income, when Schumacher needed a new engine costing 800 [[German mark|DM]] (400 €) his parents were unable to afford it, but their son was able to continue racing through support offered by several local businessmen.<ref>{{cite book

  | isbn = 1-905156-03-0 }}</ref>

In Germany the regulations require the driver to be at least 14 years old in order to obtain a kart license. To get around this, Schumacher obtained a license in [[Luxembourg]] in 1981, at the age of 12.<ref name="early years">{{cite web

In 1983 he obtained his German license and the year after he won the German Junior Kart Championship.
From 1984, Schumacher won numerous German and [[Europe]]an kart championships. He joined Eurokart dealer Adolf Neubert in 1985. By 1987 he was the German and European kart champion, at which point he withdrew from school and began working as a mechanic. In 1988 Schumacher made his first step into single-seat car racing by racing in the German [[Formula Ford]] and [[Formula König]] series, winning the latter.<ref name="early results">{{cite book

In 1989 Michael signed with [[Willi Weber|Willi Weber's]] WTS [[Formula 3]] team. For the next two years, funded by Weber, he competed in the German Formula 3 series, winning the title in 1990. Towards the end of 1990, along with his Formula 3 rivals [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] and [[Karl Wendlinger]], he joined the [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] junior racing programme in the [[1990 World Sportscar Championship season|World Sports-Prototype Championship]]. This was an unusual move for a young driver: most of Schumacher's contemporaries would instead compete in [[Formula 3000]] on their way to Formula One. However, Weber advised Schumacher that exposure to professional press conferences and driving powerful cars in long distance races would help his career.<ref name="early years" /> He gained victory at the season finale at the [[Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez]] in a [[Sauber]]-[[Mercedes-Benz C11|Mercedes C11]] and finished fifth in the drivers' championship. He continued with the team in the [[1991 World Sportscar Championship season]], winning again at the final race of the season at [[Autopolis]] in Japan with a [[Sauber]]-[[Mercedes-Benz C291]], leading to a ninth place finish in the drivers championship. In 1991 he competed in one race in the [[Japan]]ese [[Formula 3000]] Championship, finishing second.<!--Commented out ref to DTM, as it does not appear in the ref I've used: ", and the [[DTM (racing)|German Touring Car Championship]] in the early 1990s."--><ref name="early results" />

==Formula One career==
===Overview===
<!-- [[otheus]]: this belongs somewhere else -->
Schumacher was noted throughout his career for his ability to produce fast laps at crucial moments in a race, to push his car to the very limit for sustained periods.<ref name="autoracing"/> Motor sport author Christopher Hilton observed in 2003 that "A measure of a driver's capabilities is his performance in wet races, because the most delicate car control and sensitivity are needed," and noted that like other great drivers, Schumacher's record in wet conditions shows very few mistakes: up to the end of the 2003 season, Schumacher won 17 of the 30 races in wet conditions he contested.<ref>{{cite book

Schumacher made his Formula One debut with the [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] team at the [[1991 Belgian Grand Prix]], sporting car number 32 as a replacement for the imprisoned [[Bertrand Gachot]].

The {{F1|1994}} season was Schumacher's first [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]]. The season, however, was marred by the deaths of [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Roland Ratzenberger]] during the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] and by allegations that several teams, including Schumacher's Benetton team, broke the sport's technical regulations.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

Schumacher won six of the first seven races and was leading the [[1994 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]], before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear. Schumacher finished the race in second.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2003/4/288.html|title=A return to racing - Spanish Grand Prix 1994|date=2003-04-30|accessdate=2008-05-26|publisher=The Official Formula One Website}}</ref> Following the San Marino Grand Prix, the Benetton, Ferrari and McLaren teams were investigated on suspicion of breaking the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]-imposed ban on electronic aids. Benetton and McLaren initially refused to hand over their [[source code]] for investigation. When they did so, the FIA discovered hidden functionality in both teams' software, but no evidence that it had been used in a race. Both teams were fined $100,000 for their initial refusal to cooperate. However, the McLaren software, which was a gearbox program that allowed automatic shifts, was deemed legal. By contrast, the Benetton software was deemed to be a form of 'launch control' which would have allowed Schumacher to make perfect starts, which was explicitly outlawed by the regulations. <ref>{{cite book

With team-mate [[Johnny Herbert]], he took Benetton to its first [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]] and became the youngest two-time world champion in Formula One history. 

The season was marred by several collisions with Hill, in particular an overtaking manoeuvre by Hill took them both out of the [[1995 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] on lap 45<ref>{{cite web

Only once did he qualify worse than fourth; at the [[1995 Belgian Grand Prix]], he qualified 16th, but went on to win the race. After Schumacher left Benetton at the end of the year, the team won only one more race before being bought by Renault in 2000.

===Ferrari===
In {{F1|1996}}, Schumacher joined [[Scuderia Ferrari|Scuderia Ferrari S.p.A.]], a team which had last won the Drivers' Championship with [[Jody Scheckter]] in {{F1|1979}} and which had not won the Constructors' Cup since 1983 with drivers [[Rene Arnoux]] and [[Patrick Tambay]] at the wheel.  He left Benetton a year before his contract with them expired; he later cited the team's damaging actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out of his deal.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cooper |first=Steve |year=2007 |month=August |title=McLaren dream team turns into nightmare |journal=Autosport |volume=189 |issue=6 |pages=pp.6–8 }}</ref> A year later, ex-Benetton employees [[Rory Byrne]] and [[Ross Brawn]], who had been Technical Director at Benetton since 1991 ,<ref> {{cite web | title = Ross Brawn Profile | publisher = theScuderia.net | url = http://www.thescuderia.net/rossbrawn.shtml | first = Matthew | last = Bewers | accessible=2008-01-03}} </ref> and who was one of the key members behind Schumacher's title successes with the team in 1994 and 1995, decided to join Schumacher at Ferrari. This increased Schumacher's motivation to build a more experienced and potentially championship-winning team around him.

Ferrari had previously come close to the championship in 1982 and 1990. The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in the early 1990s, partially as their famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel efficient V10s of their competitors. Various drivers, notably [[Alain Prost]], had given the vehicles labels such as "truck", "pig", and "accident waiting to happen".<ref>{{cite web | title = Switch the key to Ferrari revival | publisher = Telegraph Sport |date=2006-10-20 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/core/Content/displayPrintable.jhtml?xml=/sport/2006/10/20/smbake20.xml&site=2&page=0 |first = Andrew |last = Baker |accessdate =2006-10-29 }}</ref> The poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a running joke.<ref name = "superwheels"/> At the end of 1995, though the team had improved into a solid competitor, it was still considered inferior to front-running teams such as Benetton and Williams.<ref>{{cite book| last =Henry| first =Alan (ed)| authorlink =Alan Henry| coauthors =| title =[[AUTOCOURSE]] 1996-97| publisher =Hazleton Publishing| date =1996| location =| pages =pp. 46-48| url =| doi =| id = ISBN 1-874557-91-8 }}</ref> Schumacher declared the [[Ferrari 412T]] good enough to win the championship.

Schumacher finished third in the Drivers' Championship in 1996, and helped Ferrari to second place in the constructors' championship ahead of his old team Benetton. He won three races, more than the team's total tally for the period from 1991 to 1995. During the initial part of the 1996 season, the car had had reliability trouble and Schumacher did not finish 6 of the 16 races. He took his first win for Ferrari at the Spanish Grand Prix, where he lapped the entire field up to third place in the wet, using an uncharacteristically flamboyant [[oversteer]]ing style.<ref name="early years"/> In the [[1996 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] Schumacher qualified in [[pole position]], but suffered engine failure on the race's formation lap.<ref name = "96frenchgp">{{cite news | title = GRAND PRIX RESULTS: FRENCH GP, 1996 | publisher = grandprix.com | date = | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr590.html |first = Magny |last = Cours | accessdate = 2007-04-18}}</ref> However at [[1996 Belgian Grand Prix|Spa-Francorchamps]], Schumacher used well-timed pit-stops to fend off the Williams' [[Jacques Villeneuve]]. Following that, at [[1996 Italian Grand Prix|Monza]], Schumacher won in front of the [[tifosi#Formula 1|tifosi]]. Schumacher's ability, combined with the improving reliability of Ferrari, enabled him to end the season, putting up a challenge to eventual race and championship winner [[Damon Hill]] at [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix|Suzuka]].

Michael Schumacher and [[Jacques Villeneuve]] vied for the title in {{F1|1997}}.

During the race, held at [[Circuito Permanente de Jerez|Jerez]], Schumacher and Villeneuve collided as Villeneuve passed his rival. Schumacher retired from the race and Villeneuve scored four points to take the championship. Schumacher was held to be at fault for the collision and was disqualified from the Drivers' Championship.<ref name="fia97verdict">{{cite news | title =

In {{F1|1998}}, [[Finland|Finnish]] driver [[Mika Häkkinen]] became Schumacher's main title competition. Häkkinen won the first two races of the season, gaining a 16 point advantage over Schumacher. With the Ferrari improving significantly in the second half of the season, Schumacher won six races and had five other podium finishes. Ferrari took a 1&ndash;2 finish at the [[1998 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]], which tied Schumacher with Häkkinen for the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 80 points, but Häkkinen won the Championship by winning the final two races. There were two controversies; at the [[1998 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] Schumacher was leading on the last lap when he turned into the pit lane, crossed the start finish line and stopped for a ten second stop go penalty. There was some doubt whether this counted as serving the penalty, but the win stood. At [[1998 Belgian Grand Prix#Schumacher collision with Coulthard|Spa]], Schumacher was leading the race by 40 seconds in heavy spray, but collided with [[David Coulthard]]'s McLaren when the Scot, a lap down, slowed in very poor visibility to let Schumacher past. After both cars returned to the pits, Schumacher rushed to McLaren's garage and accused Coulthard of trying to kill him.<ref name="spa98"/>Later in 2003 David Coulthard admitted it was his mistake after he was involved in a similar incident in the European Grand Prix, this time he shunted the back of the backmarker just like Michael did in 1998.

Schumacher's efforts helped Ferrari win the Constructors title in {{F1|1999}}. He lost his chance to win the Drivers' Championship at the [[1999 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]]: At the high-speed ''Stowe Corner'', his car's rear brake failed, sending him off the track and resulting in a broken leg.<ref name="broken leg"> {{cite news |title = Schumacher out of action |url = http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns02071.html |work = |publisher = GrandPrix.com |date=1999-07-12 |accessdate = 2006-10-25}}</ref> During his long absence, he was replaced by Finnish driver [[Mika Salo]]. After missing six races, he made his return at the inaugural [[1999 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysian Grand Prix]], qualifying in the pole position by almost a second.

Schumacher won his third World Championship in {{F1|2000}} after a year-long battle with Häkkinen. Schumacher won the first three races of the season and five of the first eight. Mid-way through the year, Schumacher's chances suffered with three consecutive non-finishes, <!-- *otheus: trivia but interesting >>>> including being hit from behind at the first corner in [[2000 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]] and [[2000 German Grand Prix|Germany]], --> allowing Häkkinen to close the gap in the standings.

At the post race press conference, after equalling the number of wins (41) won by his idol, [[Ayrton Senna]], Schumacher broke into tears.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3605579.stm|title= A death that shocked the world|date=2004-04-21|accessdate= 2007-04-21|publisher = BBC |first = Andrew |last = Benson }}</ref> The championship fight would come down to the penultimate race of the season, the [[2000 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]]. Starting from pole position, Schumacher had the early lead, but soon lost it to Häkkinen. After his second pit-stop, however, Schumacher came out ahead of Häkkinen and went on to win the race and the championship.

In {{F1|2001}}, Schumacher took his fourth drivers' title. Four other drivers won races, but none sustained a season-long challenge for the championship. Schumacher scored a record-tying nine wins and clinched the world championship with four races yet to run. He finished the championship with 123 points, 58 ahead of runner-up Coulthard. Season highlights included the [[2001 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]], where Schumacher finished 2nd to his brother Ralf, thus scoring the first ever 1&ndash;2 finish by brothers in Formula One;<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.globetrotter.net/gt/grandprix/en/statistiques.asp

In {{F1|2002}}, Schumacher used the [[Ferrari F2002]], widely considered to be one of the most dominant racing cars in Formula One, to retain his Drivers' Championship.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}
At the [[2002 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]] his teammate, [[Rubens Barrichello]] was leading but in the final metres of the race, under orders, slowed to allow Schumacher to win the race.<ref name="bbcaustria"/>
In winning the Drivers' Championship he equalled the record set by [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] of five world championships. Ferrari won 15 out of 17 races, and Schumacher won the title with six races remaining in the season. Schumacher broke his own record, shared with [[Nigel Mansell]], of nine race wins in a season, by winning eleven times and finishing every race on the podium. He finished with 144 points, a record-breaking 67 points ahead of the runner-up, his teammate [[Rubens Barrichello]]. This pair finished 9 of the 17 races in the first two places.

Schumacher broke Juan Manuel Fangio's record of five World Drivers' Championships by winning the drivers' title for the sixth time in {{F1|2003}}, a closely contested season. The biggest competition came once again from the [[Team McLaren|McLaren Mercedes]] and [[Williams F1|Williams BMW]] teams. In the first race, Schumacher ran off track, and in the following two, was involved in collisions.<ref>{{cite news | title = Coulthard takes Melbourne thriller | publisher = BBC Sport |date=2003-03-09 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2832441.stm | accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Raikkonen claims maiden win | publisher = BBC Sport |date=2003-03-23 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2877461.stm | accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Raikkonen wins chaotic race | publisher = BBC Sport |date=2003-04-06 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2922651.stm | accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref> He fell 16 points behind [[Kimi Räikkönen]].

After the [[2003 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian Grand Prix]], Michael Schumacher led [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] and [[Kimi Räikkönen]] by only one and two points, respectively.

In {{F1|2004}}, Schumacher won a record twelve of the first thirteen races of the season, only failing to finish in Monaco after an accident with Juan Pablo Montoya during a [[safety car]] period when he briefly locked his car's brakes. He clinched a record [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|seventh drivers' title]] at the [[2004 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]].

He finished the season in third with 62 points, less than half the points of world champion Alonso.

{{F1|2006}} became the last season of Schumacher's racing career. After three races, Schumacher had 11 points and was already 17 points behind Alonso. He won the following two races, his first wins in 18 months, not including the boycotted [[2005 United States Grand Prix]]. <!-- *otheus: Where/when San Marino?? relevance?* >>>> His pole position at San Marino was his 66th, breaking Ayrton Senna's 12 year old record. --><!-- *otheus: Also, this picture is not particularly interesting nor of high quality because of the fence >>> [[Image:Schumacher Suzuka2006.jpg|thumb|250px|Schumacher before the engine failure during the [[2006 Japanese Grand Prix]].]]-->
Schumacher was stripped of pole position at the [[2006 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] and started the race at the back of the grid. This was due to him stopping his car and blocking part of the circuit while Alonso was on his qualifying lap; he still managed to work his way up to 5th place on the notoriously cramped Monaco circuit.
By the [[2006 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]], the ninth race of the season, he was 25 points behind Alonso, and the three wins that followed helped him reduce his disadvantage to 11.

====Helmet====
[[Image:Schuhelmets.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Schumacher's helmet from the {{F1|1999}} and {{F1|2002}} seasons.]]
Schumacher in conjunction with [[Schuberth]] helped develop the first lightweight carbon helmet. In 2004, a prototype was publicly tested by being driven over by a [[tank]]; it survived intact.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jeccomposites.com/composites-news/682/Even-a-tank.html |title= Even a tank can't halt schu now |accessdate=2006-11-08 |publisher=JEC Composites}}</ref> <!-- What does this mean: "The Layers were "baked" into the corners to achieve extra stiffness and extra magnesium."?-->The helmet keeps the driver cool by funneling directed airflow through fifty holes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theprancinghorse.co.uk/news/newsfeatures/1.html |title=Michael Schumacher Helmet Profile |accessdate=2007-02-10 |publisher=theprancinghorse.co.uk}}</ref>

Schumacher's helmet sports the colours of the [[flag of Germany|German flag]] and his sponsor's decals. On the top is a blue circle with white [[astroids]]. After Schumacher joined Ferrari, a prancing horse was added on the back. In 2000 in order to differentiate his colours from new teammate Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher changed the upper blue colour and some of the white areas to red.<ref name = "mSchumacher biography">{{cite web | title = Michael Shumacher Biography | url = http://www.mschumacher.com/biography.html | work = mschumacher.com | publisher = Crash.net | accessdate = 2006-10-25}}</ref> In his final Grand Prix race, Schumacher wore a special helmet that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pitpass.com/fes_php/pitpass_news_item.php?fes_art_id=29768 |title=Michael's winning helmet |date=2006-10-21 |accessdate=2006-11-07 |publisher=PitPass}}</ref>

===Advisor for Ferrari===
====2007: Advisor ====
[[Image:Schumacher test.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Schumacher at Finali Mondiali celebrations in the F2007]]

Schumacher drove the [[Ferrari F2007]] for the first time on October 24 at Ferrari's home track in [[Fiorano Circuit|Fiorano]], Italy. He ran no more than five laps and no lap times were recorded. A Ferrari spokesman said the short drive was done for the Fiat board of directors, who were holding their meeting in [[Maranello]].{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

On November 13, 2007 Schumacher, who had not driven a Formula One car since he had retired a year ago, drove in Ferrari's F2007 during a test session for Ferrari. He returned in December, to continue helping Ferrari with their development program at [[Circuito Permanente de Jerez|Jerez circuit]]. He focused on testing electronics and tyres for the 2009 Formula One season.

====2008: car development====
In 2007, former Ferrari top manager [[Ross Brawn]] said that Schumacher is very likely and also happy to continue testing in 2008.  Michael Schumacher later explained his role further, saying that he will ''"deal with the development of the car inside [[Scuderia Ferrari|Gestione Sportiva]]"'', and as part of that, will drive the car, but not too often.<ref>{{cite web | title = Schumi in charge of developing cars | publisher = [[Gazzetta dello Sport]] via f1technical.net | date = 2008-01-11 | url = http://www.f1technical.net/news/7958?sid=46d7fcb4610cac76f4d809a27d741051 | accessdate =2008-01-11}}</ref>

During 2008 Schumacher has also competed as a [[Motorcycle sport|motorcycle racer]] in the [[Superbike racing#Other Series|IDM Superbike]]-series. He states that he has no intention of a second competitive career in this sport.<ref>''Schumacher slips up in Superbike race'' [http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?id=42681&PO=42681 www.itv-f1.com] Retrieved 5 July 2008</ref>

==Controversy==
During his long career Schumacher has been involved in several incidents, which have caused considerable controversy. Schumacher has been vilified in the [[British media]] for his involvement in title-deciding collisions in 1994 and 1997.<ref>{{cite news | title = 
Top 10 Michael Schumacher Moments | publisher = CBC Sports |first = John F. |last = Molinaro|date=2006-09-12 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/10-schumacher-momments.html | accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref> German and Italian newspapers have widely condemned his actions in 1997.<ref name="1997grandprixcom">{{cite news | title =

===Championship deciding collisions===
[[Image:Schumihill1994.jpg|thumb|200px| Hill (left) and Schumacher (right) crash at the Flinders Street corner during the [[1994 Australian Grand Prix]].]]
Going into the [[1994 Australian Grand Prix]], the final race of the [[1994 Formula One season|1994 season]], Schumacher led [[Damon Hill]] by a single point in the Drivers' Championship. Schumacher led the race from the beginning with Hill closely following him. On lap 35, Schumacher went off track, hitting a wall with his right side wheels.<ref name="autosportcrashes">{{cite news | title = 
Schumacher 500: Has the King Lost His Crown? | publisher = AutoSport |first = Ville |last = Kopu |coauthors = Nottmeier, Jan | date = | url = http://atlasf1.autosport.com/98/ger/schum.html | accessdate = 2006-10-24}}</ref> It is unknown whether Schumacher's car was damaged, as he returned to the track at reduced speed but still leading the race. At the next corner, when Hill attempted a pass on the inside while Schumacher was turning into the corner, Schumacher and Hill collided. Schumacher's car was tipped up onto two wheels and eliminated on the spot. Hill pitted immediately and retired from the race with unrepairable damage. As neither driver scored Schumacher took the title.

Opinion is divided over the incident. British Formula One journalist and author [[Alan Henry]] has written that Schumacher was blamed by "many F1 insiders" for the incident,<ref>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Wheel to Wheel: Great Duels of Formula One Racing | origyear = 1996 | accessdate = 2006-10-29 | edition = | publisher = Weidenfeld Nicolson Illustrated | location = | id = ISBN 0-7538-0522-7 | pages = 117}}</ref> however British Formula One commentator [[Murray Walker]] believes it was not a deliberate move.<ref>{{cite news | title =

[[Image:Schumivilleneuve1997.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Michael Schumacher (red) and [[Jacques Villeneuve]] (blue) in the moment of the collision at the ''Dry Sack'' corner in the [[1997 European Grand Prix]] at [[Circuito Permanente de Jerez|Jerez]].]]
At the [[1997 European Grand Prix]] at [[Circuito Permanente de Jerez|Jerez]], the last race of the [[1997 Formula One season|season]], Schumacher led another driver, this time Williams' [[Jacques Villeneuve]], by one point in the Drivers' Championship. Although Schumacher and Villeneuve had set the same time during qualifying, the Canadian driver started the race in pole position due to his being the first to set the time. By the first corner of the race, Schumacher was ahead of Villeneuve. On lap 48, Villeneuve passed Schumacher at the Dry Sac Corner. As he did so, Schumacher turned into the Williams, the right-front wheel of Schumacher's Ferrari hitting the left side pod of Villeneuve's car. Schumacher retired from the race immediately while Villeneuve was able to finish the race in the third place, taking four points and so becoming the World Champion.<ref name="autosportcrashes"/>

Two weeks after the race, Schumacher was excluded from the results for the season after a [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] disciplinary hearing disqualified him, finding that his "manoeuvre was an instinctive reaction and although
deliberate not made with malice or premeditation. It was a serious error."<ref name="fia97verdict" /> This made him the only driver in the history of the sport, as of 2007 to be disqualified from a World Championship.<ref>{{cite news | title =

===Other incidents===
Two laps from the finish of the [[1998 British Grand Prix]], Michael Schumacher was leading the race when he was issued a stop-and-go penalty for overtaking a lapped car ([[Alexander Wurz]]) under a yellow flag. This penalty involves going into the pit lane and stopping for 10 seconds. But as the penalty was given with fewer than 12 laps remaining, and since it was issued as a handwritten note, the Ferrari team was confused as to whether the penalty was a stop and go penalty or merely a penalty of 10 seconds to be added to Schumacher's race time. The rules state that a driver must serve his penalty within three laps of the penalty being issued, and on the third lap after receiving the penalty, Schumacher turned into the pit lane to serve his penalty. However, this happened to be the last lap of the race, and Ferrari's pit box was located after the start/finish line, meaning that Schumacher finished the race before serving the penalty. The stewards initially resolved that problem by adding 10 seconds to Schumacher's race time, then later rescinded the penalty completely.<ref>{{cite news | title =

[[Image:2002 Austrian GP.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Rubens Barrichello]] makes way for Schumacher at the end of the [[2002 Austrian Grand Prix]].]]

Historically, [[team orders]] had always been permitted in Formula One. During Schumacher's tenure at Ferrari, the team often employed team orders to benefit one of their drivers over the other. Usually Schumacher, as team leader, benefited. The notable exception came in the 1999 season in which he played a supporting role for [[Eddie Irvine]]. After missing part of the season with a broken leg, his return from this injury was at the second last race of the season, the [[1999 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysian Grand Prix]], where he supported Irvine's victory.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

At the [[2002 Austrian Grand Prix]], Schumacher's teammate, Rubens Barrichello, took pole and led the race from the start. In the final metres of the race, the Brazilian driver, under orders from Ferrari, slowed his car to make way for Schumacher to pass and win the race.<ref name="bbcaustria">{{cite news | title =

Although Schumacher took the pole position during the qualifying for the [[2006 Monaco Grand Prix]], there was controversy near the end of the session. Schumacher stopped his car in the Rascasse corner, partially blocking the circuit, while his main contender for the season title, [[Fernando Alonso]], was on his qualifying lap. Schumacher stated that he simply locked up the wheels going into the corner and that the car then stalled while he attempted to reverse out.<ref name="monacopole">{{cite news | title =

He supports a hospital for child victims of war in [[Sarajevo]], which specialises in caring for amputees. In [[Lima]], [[Peru]] he funded the "Palace for the Poor", a centre for helping homeless street children obtain an education, clothing, food, medical attention, and shelter. He stated his interest in these various efforts was piqued both by his love for children and the fact that these causes had received little attention. While an exact figure for the amount of money he has donated throughout his life is unknown, it is known that in his last four years as a driver, he donated at least $50 million.<ref name="donated50mil"/>
 
Since his participation in a FIA European road safety campaign, as part of his punishment after the collision at the [[1997 European Grand Prix]], Schumacher has continued to support other campaigns, such as [[Make Roads Safe]], which is led by the FIA Foundation and calls on [[G8]] countries and the [[UN]] to recognise global road deaths as a major global health issue.

{{note|Consecutivewins}} Record shared with [[Alberto Ascari]] ([[1952 Belgian Grand Prix|1952 Belgian GP]]&ndash;[[1953 Argentine Grand Prix|1953 Argentine GP]]). Some sources credit Ascari with nine consecutive wins, disregarding the [[1953 Indianapolis 500]] race, in which Ascari did not compete. The American race formed part of the world championship, but was not run to the same regulations as the other races and was very rarely attended by world championship drivers.
