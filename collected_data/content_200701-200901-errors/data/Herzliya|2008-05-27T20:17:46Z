'''Herzliya''' (in {{lang-he-n|הֶרְצְלִיָּה}}) is a city of approximately 83,000 located on [[Israel|Israel's]] central coastal strip, just north of [[Tel Aviv]]. It is part of the [[Tel Aviv District]]. Named after [[Theodor Herzl]], the founder of modern [[Zionism]], Herzliya covers an area of 26 km². Within its municipal boundaries is Herzliya Pituah, one of Israel's most upscale neighborhoods, home to many ambassadors and foreign diplomats.

==History==
Founded in 1924 by seven pioneering families on land close to the site of the ancient Crusader city of [[Arsuf]], Herzliya is named after [[Theodor Herzl]], the father of modern [[Zionism]]. Herzliya's flag features seven stars to salute Herzl's idea of the seven-hour working day, as well as a small boat, two packs of wheat and a ship's wheel. Herzliya was officially recognized as a city in 1960.
==Today==

The Herzliya Marina was built in the 1970s. The city also has a small airport (code: HRZ), three malls (Arena Mall, Shiv'at HaKokhavim Mall and the Outlet), movie theaters, museums, cultural centers and a stadium. It is home to Israel's largest film studio, Ulpanei Herzliya (Herzliya Studios).

The [[Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center]] is a private college that offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in government, business administration, law, computer science and other academic disciplines. 

On the northern coast is a national park built around the ruins of Apollonia ([[Arsuf]]).

Herzliya has two [[association football|football]] clubs, [[Maccabi Herzliya F.C.|Maccabi]] and [[Hapoel Herzliya F.C.|Hapoel]]. For many years the two clubs languished together in Israel's lower divisions. Today, Maccabi plays in [[Ligat ha'Al]], the top division of [[Football in Israel|Israeli football]], whilst Hapoel are in [[Liga Alef]], the fourth tier. Both clubs use the [[Herzliya Stadium|Municipal Stadium]].

In addition, Herzliya is one of the two homes for the [[Bnei HaSharon]] [[basketball]] club, which plays its games in Herzliya and [[Ra'anana]] (the club was formed by a merger of the two city's individual teams).
