'''Backmasking''' (also known incorrectly as ''[[backward masking]]'')<ref>Backward(s) masking has two other meanings; see [[backward masking]]. See also {{cite web |last=Crispen |first=Bob |title=Backward Masking&nbsp;… another pious fraud |url=http://www.crispen.org/rants/backward.html |publisher=The Crispen Family|accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref> is a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique in which a sound or message is recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forwards. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a message found through [[phonetic reversal]] may be unintentional.

Backmasking was popularized by [[The Beatles]], who used backward vocals and instrumentation on their 1966 album ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]''.<ref name="sullivan">{{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Mark |title='More Popular Than Jesus': The Beatles and the Religious Far Right |journal=Popular Music |year=1987 |month=October |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=313-326}}</ref> Artists have since used backmasking for artistic, comedic, and satiric effect, on both analog and digital recordings. The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for "clean" releases of songs.

Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the [[United States]] since the 1980s, when allegations from Christian groups of its use for Satanic purposes were made against prominent [[rock music]]ians, leading to record-burning protests and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments. Whether backmasked messages exist is in debate, as is whether backmasking can be used subliminally to affect listeners. 

== History ==
=== Development ===
In 1877 [[Thomas Edison]] invented the [[phonograph]], a device that allowed [[sound]] to be [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded and reproduced]] on a rotating cylinder with a [[stylus]] (or "needle") attached to a diaphragm mounted at the narrow end of a horn. [[Emile Berliner]] invented the familiar lateral-cut disc [[gramophone record|phonograph record]] in 1888. His design overtook the Edison phonograph in the 1920s, since Berliner's patent expired in 1918, and others were then free to exploit his invention.

In addition to recreating recorded sounds by placing the stylus on the cylinder or disc and rotating it in the same direction as during the recording, one could hear different sounds by rotating the cylinder or disc backwards.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kittler |first=Friedrick |title=The Gramaphone |work=Adventures in CyberSound |publisher=[[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] |url=http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/PHONO_KITTLER.html |accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref> In 1878 Edison noted that, when played backwards, "the song is still melodious in many cases, and some of the strains are sweet and novel, but altogether different from the song reproduced in the right way".<ref>Blecha, 48</ref> The backwards playing of records was advised as training for magicians by occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], who suggested in his 1913 book ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'' that an [[adept]] "train himself to think backwards by external means", one of which was to "listen to phonograph records, reversed."<ref>{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Aleister |authorlink=Aleister Crowley |title=[[Magick (Book 4)]] |origyear=1913 |publisher=Weiser |year=1997 |isbn=0877289190 |pages=648}}</ref>

[[Image:Reel-to-reel recorder tc-630.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tape recorder]]s allowed backward recording in [[recording studio]]s.]]

The 1950s saw the development of ''[[musique concrète]]'', an [[avant-garde]] form of [[electronic music]] which involves [[audio editing|editing]] together fragments of natural and industrial sounds, and the concurrent spread of the use of [[tape recorder]]s in [[recording studio]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last=White |first=Ray |title=Musique Concrète |url=http://whitefiles.org/rws/rx01.htm |publisher = whitefiles.org | accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref> These two trends led to [[tape music composition]]s, composed on [[magnetic tape|tape]] using techniques including [[reverse tape effects]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Peters |first=Michael |title=The Birth of Loop: A Short History of Looping Music |url=http://www.loopers-delight.com/history/Loophist.html |publisher=loopers-delight.com|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>

[[The Beatles]], who incorporated the techniques of ''concrète'' into their recordings, were responsible for popularizing the concept of backmasking.<ref name="sullivan" /> Singer [[John Lennon]] and producer [[George Martin]] both claim they discovered the backward recording technique during the recording of 1966's ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]''; specifically the album tracks "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" and "[[I'm Only Sleeping]]," and the single "[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]".<ref>{{cite news |last=Mugan |first=Chris |title=Subliminal advertising: The voice within |publisher=The Independent |date=[[2006-10-13]] |url=http://arts.independent.co.uk/music/features/article1847509.ece |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> Lennon stated that, while under the influence of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], he accidentally played the tapes for "Rain" in reverse, and enjoyed the sound.

=== Rumors ===
The Beatles were involved in the spread of backmasking both as a recording technique and as the center of a [[controversy]]. The latter has its roots in an event in 1969, when [[WNIC|WKNR-FM]] DJ [[Russell Gibb]] received a phone call from a student at [[Eastern Michigan University]] who identified himself as "Tom". The caller asked Gibb about a rumor that Beatle [[Paul McCartney]] had died, and claimed that the Beatles song "[[Revolution 9]]" contained a backward message confirming the rumor. Gibb played the song backwards on his turntable, and heard "Turn me on, dead man&nbsp;… turn me on, dead man&nbsp;… turn me on, dead man…" ({{Audio-nohelp|Revolution 9 backwards.ogg|listen}}<!-- FAIR USE of Image:Revolution 9 backwards.ogg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Revolution_9_backwards.ogg for rationale -->).<ref name="reeve">{{cite book |last=Reeve |first=Andru J |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man: The Beatles And The "Paul-Is-Dead" Hoax |publisher=AuthorHouse |pages=11–13}}</ref> Gibb began telling his listeners about what he called "The Great Cover-up",<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yoakum |first=Jim |title=The Man Who Killed Paul McCartney |journal=[[Gadfly Online|The Gadfly]] |year=2000 |month=May/June |url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/archive/MayJune00/archive-mccartney.html |accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> and to the original clue were added various others, including the alleged backmasked message "Paul is a dead man, miss him, miss him, miss him", in "[[I'm So Tired]]".<ref name="reeve" /> The "[[Paul is dead]]" rumor popularized the idea of backmasking in [[popular music]].<ref name="sullivan" />

Following Gibb's show, many more songs were found to contain audible phrases when reversed. Initially, the search was done mostly by fans of [[rock music]], but in the late 1970s,<ref>Blecha, 49</ref> during the rise of the [[Christian right]] in the United States,<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Stephen |title=Serious Issues Underlie a New Album from Styx |publisher=New York Times |date=[[1983-03-27]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E5DF1339F934A15750C0A965948260 |accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups began to claim that backmasked messages could bypass the [[consciousness|conscious mind]] and reach the [[subconscious]], where they would be unknowingly accepted by the listener.<ref name="poundstone86">Poundstone (1986), 227–232</ref> In 1981, Christian DJ [[Michael Mills]] began stating on Christian radio programs that [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" contained hidden messages that were heard by the subconscious.<ref name="davis">{{cite book |editor=David Barker |title=33 1/3 Greatest Hits, Volume One |publisher=Contiunuum |year=2007 |isbn=0826419038 |chapter=Led Zeppelin IV |last=Davis |first=Erik |pages=212–214}}</ref> In early 1982, the [[The PTL Club|Praise the Lord Network's]] [[Paul Crouch]] hosted a show with self-described neuroscientist [[William Yarroll]], who argued that rock stars were cooperating with the [[Church of Satan]] to place hidden subliminal messages on records.<ref>Denisoff, 289</ref> Also in 1982, fundamentalist Christian pastor [[Gary Greenwald]] held public lectures on dangers of backmasking, along with at least one mass record-smashing.<ref name="devil">{{cite journal |last=Vokey |first=John R. |coauthors=J.

===Legislation===
One result of the furor was the firing of five radio DJs who had encouraged listeners to search for backward messages in their record collections.<ref>Blecha, 49</ref> A more serious consequence was legislation by the state governments of [[Arkansas]] and [[California]]. The 1983 California bill was introduced to prevent backmasking that "can manipulate our behavior without our knowledge or consent and turn us into disciples of the Antichrist".<ref>Blecha, 51</ref> Involved in the discussion on the bill was a [[California State Assembly]] Consumer Protection and Toxic Materials Committee hearing, during which "Stairway to Heaven" was played backwards, and William Yaroll testified.<ref>Denisoff, 290</ref> The successful bill made the distribution of records with undeclared backmasking an invasion of privacy for which the distributor could be sued.<ref name="devil" /> The Arkansas law passed unanimously in 1983, referenced albums by [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Queen]] and [[Styx]],<ref name="nyt" /> and mandated that records with backmasking include a warning sticker: "Warning: This record contains backward masking which may be perceptible at a subliminal level when the record is played forward." However, the bill was returned to the state senate by Governor [[Bill Clinton]] and defeated.<ref name="devil" /> House Resolution 6363, introduced in 1982 by Representative [[Bob Dornan]], proposed mandating a similar label;<ref name="poundstone83">Poundstone (1983), 200–214</ref> the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Transportation and Tourism and was never passed.<ref>{{USBill|97|HR|6363}} from [[THOMAS]]</ref> Government action was also called for in the legislatures of Texas and Canada.<ref name="devil" />

[[Image:Compact Disc.jpg|thumb|right|The [[compact disc]] made finding backward messages difficult, causing interest in backmasking to decline.]]

With the advent of [[compact disc]]s in the 1980s, but prior to the advent of sound editing technology for [[personal computer]]s in the 1990s, it became more difficult to listen to recordings backwards, and the controversy died down.<ref name="wsj" />

=== Resurgence ===
Though the backmasking controversy peaked in the 1980s, the general belief in subliminal manipulation became more widespread in the [[United States]] during the following decade,<ref name="brannon" /> with belief in Satanic backmasking on records persisting into the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Kenneth J.

== Use ==
{{see also|List of backmasked messages}}
[[Image:Digital.signal.svg|thumb|right|The switch to [[digital audio]] made recording backmasked messages quicker and easier.]]

Backmasking has been used as a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique since the 1960s. In the era of [[magnetic tape sound recording]], backmasking required that the source [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape actually be played backwards, which was achieved by first being wound onto the original takeup reel, then reversing the reels so as to use that reel as the source (this would reverse the stereo channels as well). [[Digital audio]] recording has greatly simplified the process.<ref name="radar" />

Backmasked words are unintelligible noise when played forward, but when played backwards are clear speech.<ref name="robinson" /> Listening to backmasked audio with most [[phonograph|turntables]] requires disengaging the drive and rotating the album by hand in reverse<ref name="seattle" /> (though some can play records backwards<ref name="poundstone86" />). With [[magnetic tape]], the tape must be reversed and spliced back in to the cassette.<ref name="seattle" /> [[Compact disc]]s were difficult to reverse when first introduced, but [[digital audio editor]]s, which were first introduced in the late 1980s and became popular during the next decade,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Portable Digital Audio Workstations (Buyer's Guide) |journal=Theatre Crafts International |date=1997-02-01 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-9303362.html |accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> allow easy reversal of audio from digital sources.<ref name="wsj" />

=== Satanic backmasking ===
Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly [[classic rock]] songs whose authors denied any intent to promote [[Satanism]], backmasking has been used by [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands to insert Satanic messages in their lyrics or imagery. Still, the majority of bands that use Satanic imagery have not been shown to be Satanists, and many bands have utilized Satanic imagery solely for commercial reasons.<ref>Blecha, 52</ref> For example, [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]] included at the start of the band's 1985 album ''[[Hell Awaits]]'' a deep backmasked voice chanting "Join Us" over and over at increasing volumes for 1 minute and 2 seconds until a deep voice says "Welcome Back."({{Audio-nohelp|Hell Awaits backwards.ogg|listen}}<!-- FAIR USE of Image:Hell Awaits backwards.ogg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Hell_Awaits_backwards.ogg for rationale -->).<ref>{{cite web |last=Fortes |first=Michael |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Slayer |publisher=jefitoblog |date=[[2007-03-20]] |url=http://jefitoblog.com/blog/?p=1118 |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Did You Know? |publisher=Slayerized |url=http://www.slayerized.com/band/didyouknow.html |accessdate=2006-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Davis |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Davis |title=The Greatest Metal Bands Of All Time:Slayer |publisher=[[MTV News]] |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal/greatest_metal_bands/071406/index7.jhtml |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> However, Slayer vocalist [[Tom Araya]] states that the band's use of Satanic imagery was "solely for effect".<ref>{{cite web |last=Hellqvist |first=Janek |title=Slayer FAQ |work=Slyer: The Abyss |date=[[1998-12-03]] |publisher=slaytonic.com |url=http://www.slaytanic.com/faq.html |accessdate=2007-04-16 |quote=Interview question: 'Did you adopt the satanic image solely for effect?'

=== Aesthetic use ===
Backmasking is often used for aesthetic purposes, i.e., to enhance the meaning or sound of a track.<ref>Blecha, 49</ref> During the [[Judas Priest]] subliminal message trial, lead singer [[Rob Halford]] admitted to recording the words "In the dead of the night, love bites" backwards into the track "Love Bites", from the 1984 album ''[[Defenders of the Faith]]''. Asked why he recorded the message, Halford stated that "When you're composing songs, you're always looking for new ideas, new sounds."<ref>{{cite news |title=Judas Priest's Lead Singer Testifies |publisher=New York Times |date=[[1990-08-01]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9C0CE1DA143FF932A3575BC0A966958260 |accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref>

A well-known example of a hidden message is recorded backwards into [[Pink Floyd]]'s 1979 song "[[Empty Spaces]]": "…congratulations. You've just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the [[funny farm]], [[Chalfont St Giles|Chalfont]]." (voice in background) "Roger! Carolyn is on the phone!"<ref name="p186">Patterson, 186</ref> This line may refer to former lead singer [[Syd Barrett]], who is thought to have suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] years earlier.<ref name="p186">Patterson, 186</ref>

One backmasking technique is to reverse an earlier part of a song. [[Missy Elliott]] used this technique in one of her songs, "[[Work It]]",<ref name="rap">{{cite web |last=Corbin |first=Dean |title=Rap/Hip Hop |publisher=Backmask Online |url=http://www.backmaskonline.com/rap.html |accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> as did [[Jay Chou]] ("[[You Can Hear]]", from ''[[Ye Hui Mei]]''),<ref>{{cite web |title=Jay Chou FAQ |publisher=Jay-Chou.net |url=http://www.jay-chou.net/forums/faq.php?faq=new_faq_item2 |accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref> [[At the Drive-In]] ("[[300&nbsp;MHz]]", from ''[[Vaya]]''),<ref name="modernrock">{{cite web |last=Corbin |first=Dean |title=Modern Rock |publisher=Backmask Online |url=http://www.backmaskonline.com/modernrock.html |accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> and [[Lacuna Coil]] ("[[Self Deception]]", from ''[[Comalies]]'').<ref>{{cite web |title=Lacuna Coil—Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Emptyspiral.net—The Lacuna Coil Community |date=[[2006-12-10]] |url=http://emptyspiral.net/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=69 |accessdate=2006-08-23}}</ref> A related technique is to reverse an entire instrumental track. [[John Lennon]] originally wanted to do so with "[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]", but objections by producer [[George Martin]] and bandmate [[Paul McCartney]] cut the backward section to 30 seconds.<ref name="stevens" /> [[The Stone Roses]] have made heavy use of this technique in songs including "[[Don't Stop (Stone Roses song)|Don't Stop]]",<ref>{{cite web |last=Pomroy |first=Matt |title=The Stone Roses: self-titled |date=[[2002-10-22]] |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/stoneroses-st.shtml |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> "[[Guernica (song)|Guernica]]", and "[[Simone (song)|Simone]]",<ref>{{cite interview |last=Brown |first=Ian |interviewer=Adam Walton |date=[[1999-02-02]] |url=http://adamwalton.co.uk/mmt_arc/int-ianbrown.htm |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> which are all backwards versions of other Stone Roses tracks, sometimes overdubbed with new vocals.

Artists often use backmasking of sounds or instrumental audio to produce interesting sound effects.<ref name="radar">{{cite web |last=Molitorisz |first=Sacha |title=Out of the box |work=Radar Blog |publisher=Sidney Morning Herald |date=[[2004-06-23]] |url=http://blogs.smh.com.au/radar/archives/2004/06/out_of_the_box.html |accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Federlein |first=David |title=Reader comments: backwards satanic messages |work=The [[Skeptic's Dictionary]] |date=[[2005-04-01]] |url=http://skepdic.com/comments/backcom.html |accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref> One such sound effect is the [[reverse echo]]. When done on tape, such use of backmasking is known as ''[[reverse tape effects]]''. One example is [[Matthew Sweet]]'s 1999 album ''[[In Reverse]]'', which includes reversed guitar parts which were played directly onto a tape running in reverse.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Simons |first=David |title=Matthew Sweet: Rebuilding the Wall of Sound |journal=[[Guitar Player]] |year=2000 |month=January }}</ref> For live concerts, the guitar parts were played live on stage using a backward emulator.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Simons |first=David |title=Back on the Bus |journal=Onstage |year=2000 |month=January}}</ref>

The Canadian band [[Klaatu]] used the vocal track, reversed, from their song "Anus From Uranus" as the vocal track to the song "Silly Boys", and even included a lyrics sheet that attempted to translate the backwards vocal sounds into actual words, however the result was mostly nonsensical non sequiturs or imaginative license.<ref>http://www.klaatu.org/samples/samples.html</ref>

=== Humorous and parody messages ===
[[Image:Sox Satanic Subliminals.png|thumb|right|The manual for the popular sound program [[SoX]] pokes fun at subliminal messages. The description of the "reverse" option says "Included for finding Satanic subliminals."]]

A common use of backmasking is hiding a comedic or parodical message backwards in a song. The [[B-side]] of the 1966 [[Napoleon XIV]] single "[[They're Coming to Take Me Away Ha-Haaa!]]" is a reversed version of the entire forwards record, entitled "!aaaH-aH ,yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT". It reached #3 in the US charts, and #4 in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |title=They're Coming To Take Me Away, Ha-haaa by  Napoleon XIV |publisher=[[Songfacts]] |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=675 |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>

[["Weird Al" Yankovic]] included in "[[Nature Trail to Hell]]", from 1984s ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D]]'', a backmasked voice which declares that "[[Satan]] eats [[Cheez Whiz]]" ({{Audio-nohelp|Nature Trail To Hell backwards.ogg|listen}}<!-- FAIR USE of Image:Nature Trail To Hell backwards.ogg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Nature_Trail_To_Hell_backwards.ogg for rationale -->).<ref name="wsj" /> Another early example can be found on the [[J. Geils Band]] track "[[No Anchovies, Please]]", from 1980s album ''[[Love Stinks]]''. The message, disguised as a foreign-sounding language spoken under the narration, is, "It doesn't take a genius to tell the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."<ref name="poundstone86" />

[[Electric Light Orchestra]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]], following their involvement in the 1980s backmasking controversy, released songs that parody the allegations made against them. ELO, after being accused of Satanic backmasking on their 1974 album ''[[Eldorado (ELO album)|Eldorado]]'', included backmasked messages in two songs on their next album, 1975's ''[[Face the Music (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Face The Music]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Michel |first=Rob |title=1974: Electric Light Orchestra: Eldorado |work=Counting Out Time |publisher=Dutch Progressive Rock Page |year=2002 |month=August |url=http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1974_03 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> "[[Down Home Town]]" begins with a voice twice repeating (in reverse) "Pass the mighty waterfall".<ref name="elo">{{cite web |title=Secret Messages |work=My Electric Light Orchestra Fan Site |publisher=FutureBright |url=http://elo.futurebright.com/Secrets.htm |accessdate=2006-07-27}}</ref> And the opening instrumental "[[Fire On High]]" contains the backmasked message "The music is reversible, but time is not.

({{Audio-nohelp|Elofireonhighreverce.ogg|listen}}<!-- FAIR USE of Image:Elofireonhighreverce.ogg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Elofireonhighreverce.ogg for rationale -->).<ref>Patterson, 173–174</ref> In 1983 ELO released an entire album, ''[[Secret Messages]]'', in response to the controversy.<ref name="ftm" /> Among the many backmasked messages on the album are: "Welcome to the big show" (2x);<ref name="poundstone86" /> "Thank you for listening"; "Look out there's danger ahead"; "Hup two three four"; "Time After Time"; and "You're playing me backwards".<ref name="elo" /> Styx also released an album in response to allegations of Satanic backmasking:<ref name="kilroy" /> 1983's ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'', which deals with an allegorical group called the "Majority for Musical Morality" that outlaws rock music.<ref name="nyt" /> A sticker on the album cover contains the message, "By order of the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward messages", and the song "Heavy Metal Poisoning" does in fact contain the backmasked [[Latin language|Latin]] words "''[[Annuit Cœptis]], [[Novus Ordo Seclorum]]''" ("God has favored our undertakings; a new order for the ages")—part of the [[Great Seal of the United States|Great Seal]] which encircles the pyramid on the back of the American [[United States one-dollar bill|dollar bill]].<ref name="poundstone83" /> 

[[Iron Maiden]]'s 1983 album ''[[Piece of Mind (Iron Maiden album)|Piece of Mind]]'' features a short backwards message, included by the band in response to allegations of Satanism that were surrounding them at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Narinian|first=Vartan|title=The Iron Maiden FAQ Part 1|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/music/iron-maiden-faq/part1/}}</ref> Between the songs "[[The Trooper]]" and "[[Still Life (song)|Still Life]]" is inebriated drummer [[Nicko McBrain]] doing an impression of [[Idi Amin|Idi Amin Dada]]: "'What ho', sed de t'ing wid de t'ree bonce [said the thing with the three heads].

Some messages chastise or poke fun at the listener who is playing the song backwards. One such message was included by "Weird Al" Yankovic in "[[I Remember Larry]]", from the 1996 album ''[[Bad Hair Day]]'', on which Yankovic lightly chastises the listener with the backmasked remark, "Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands" ({{Audio-nohelp|I Remember Larry backwards.ogg|listen}}<!-- FAIR USE of Image:I Remember Larry backwards.ogg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:I_Remember_Larry_backwards.ogg for rationale -->).<ref>{{cite web |last=Lick |first=Marty "Gumby" |coauthors="Happy Steve" Chai| title="Weird Al" Yankovic Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Al-oholics Anonymous |url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/index.html |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Similarly, the [[The B-52's|B-52's]] song "[[Detour Through your Mind]]", from the 1986 LP ''[[Bouncing off the Satellites]]'', contains the message, "I buried my parakeet in the backyard. Oh no, you're playing the record backwards. Watch out, you might ruin your needle."<ref>Patterson, 174</ref> Meanwhile, [[Christian rock]] group [[Petra (band)|Petra]] included in their song "[[Judas Kiss]]", from the 1982 album ''[[More Power To Ya]]'', the message, "What are you looking for the devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?"<ref name="poundstone86" />

=== Critical or explicit messages ===
[[Image:Zappa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frank Zappa]] used backmasking to avoid censorship.]]

Backmasking has also been used to record statements perhaps too critical or explicit to be used forwards. Frank Zappa used backmasking to avoid censorship of the track "[[Hot Poop]]", from ''[[We're only in it for the Money]]'' (1968). The released version contains at the end of its side "A" the backmasked message "Better look around before you say you don't care. / Shut your f...ing<!-- please don't change this to "fucking"—the song is itself censored --> mouth 'bout the length of my hair. / How would you survive / If you were alive / shitty little person?" . This profanity-laced verse, originally from the song "[[Mother People]]", was censored by Verve Records, so Zappa edited the verse out, reversed it, and inserted it elsewhere in the album as "Hot Poop" (though even in the backward message the word "fucking" is censored).<ref>{{cite web |title=We're Only In It for the Money |last=Pacholski |first=Luke |url=http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/money.html |publisher=lukpac.org |accessdate=2006-07-29}}</ref> Another example is found in [[Roger Waters]]' 1991 album ''[[Amused to Death]]'', on which Waters recorded a backward message, possibly critical of film director [[Stanley Kubrick]], who had refused to let Waters sample a breathing sound from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Michael |title=Amused To Death Trivia |publisher=Roger Waters International Fan Club |url=http://www.rogerwaters.org/atdtrivia.html |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> The message appears in the song "[[Perfect Sense Part 1]]", in which Waters' backmasked voice says, "Julia, however, in light and visions of the issues of Stanley, we have changed our minds. We have decided to include a backward message, Stanley, for you and all the other book burners."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Message |publisher=The Kubrick-Floyd Site |url=http://geocities.com/enigmathon/backmess.html |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>

=== Censorship ===
A further use of backmasking is to [[censorship|censor]] words and phrases deemed  inappropriate on [[radio edit]]s and "[[wiktionary:clean|clean]]" album releases.<ref name="nelson">{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Chris |title=Sticker Ban Policy: Family Values Or Consumer Fraud? |publisher=[[VH1]] |date=1998-09-08 |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/501064/19980908/story.jhtml |accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> For example, [[The Fugees]]' clean version of the album ''[[The Score (album)|The Score]]'' contains various backmasked [[profanity|profanities]];<ref name="nelson" /> thus, when playing the album backwards, the censored words are clearly audible among the backward gibberish.<ref>{{cite web |author=mcc |publisher=[[Everything2]] |title=Music that sounds better backward than forward |url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=677630 |accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref> When used with the word "shit", this type of backmasking results in a sound similar to "ish". As a result, "[[wiktionary:ish|ish]]" became a [[euphemism]] for "shit".<ref>{{cite web |last=Rader |first=Walter |title=The Online Slang Dictionary |coauthors=David |date=[[2002-12-22]] |publisher=University of California at Berkeley |url=http://onlineslangdictionary.com/browse/i |accessdate=2007-04-16}}</ref>

[[Electric Light Orchestra]] was accused of hiding a backward Satanic message in their 1974 album ''[[Eldorado (ELO album)|Eldorado]]''. The title track, "[[Eldorado (song)|Eldorado]]", was said to contain the message "He is the nasty one / Christ, you're infernal / It is said we're dead men / Everyone who has the mark will live."<ref name="poundstone83" /> ELO singer and songwriter [[Jeff Lynne]] responded by calling this accusation (and the related charge of being "devil-worshippers") "[[bollocks|skcollob]]",<ref name="ftm">{{cite web |title=Electric Light Orchestra Biogs |publisher=Face The Music |url=http://www.ftmusic.com/biogs/elo/elo_biog.html |accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref> and stating that the message "is absolutely manufactured by whoever said, 'That's what it said.' It doesn't say anything of the sort."<ref>Patterson, 174</ref> The group included several backward messages in later albums in response to the accusations.

In 1981, [[Styx (band)|Styx]] was accused of putting the backward message "Satan move through our voices" ({{Audio-nohelp|Snowblind backwards.ogg|listen}}<!-- FAIR USE of Image:Snowblind backwards.ogg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Snowblind_backwards.ogg for rationale -->) on the song "[[Snowblind (Styx song)|Snowblind]]", from ''[[Paradise Theatre]]''.<ref name="nyt" /> Guitarist [[James Young (American musician)|James Young]] called these charges "rubbish",<ref name="arar">{{cite news |last=Arar |first=Yardena |title=Satanic records or balderdash: Just what the devil's going on? |publisher=The Daily Herald (Arlington Heights) |date=[[1982-05-26]]}}</ref> and responded, "If we want to make a statement, we'll do it in a way that people can understand us and not in a way where you have to go out and buy a $400 tape player to understand us."<ref name="kilroy">{{cite news |last=Hoekstra |first=Dave |title=Styx makes a statement |publisher=Suburban Sun-Times |date=[[1983-04-01]]}}</ref> In 1983, the band released a concept album, ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'', satirizing the [[Moral Majority]].

A well-known alleged message is found in rock group [[Led Zeppelin]]'s 1971 song "[[Stairway to Heaven]]". The backwards playing of a portion of the song purportedly results in words beginning with "Here's to my sweet Satan" ({{Audio-nohelp|STH reverse.ogg|listen}}<!-- FAIR USE of Image:STH reverse.ogg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:STH_reverse.ogg for rationale -->).<ref name="milner">{{cite web |last=Milner |first=Jeff |title=Jeff Milner's Backmasking Site |url=http://jeffmilner.com/backmasking.htm |publisher = jeffmilner.com |accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref> But [[Swan Song Records]] issued a statement to the contrary: "Our turntables only play in one direction—forwards".<ref name="davis" /> And Led Zeppelin vocalist [[Robert Plant]] denied the accusations in an interview: "To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway To Heaven' was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that's not my idea of making music."<ref>{{cite interview |last=Plant |first=Robert |subjectlink=Robert Plant |interviewer=J.D.

=== Subliminal persuasion ===
{{further|[[Subliminal message]]}}

Accusations have been made by various groups that backmasking can be used to create [[subliminal message]]s.

====Fundamentalist Christian groups====
Various [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups have declared that Satan—or Satan-influenced musicians—use backmasked messages to subliminally alter behavior. Pastor Gary Greenwald claimed that subliminal messages backmasked into rock music induce listeners towards sex and drug use.<ref>Vokey, 248</ref> Minister Jacob Aranza wrote in his 1982 book ''Backward Masking Unmasked'' that rock groups "are using backmasking to convey satanic and drug related messages to the subconscious."<ref>Blecha, 49</ref> Christian DJ Michael Mills argued in 1981 that "the subconscious mind is being successfully affected by the repetition of beat and lyrics—being affected through a subliminal message."<ref>Mills, Michael. [http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2007/01/365_days_1_the_.html Hidden and Satanic Messages In Rock Music]. Radio interview, 1981, blog.wfmu.org. [http://blogfiles.wfmu.org/DP/2007/01/001_Michael_Mills_01_Introduction.mp3 Introduction], at 1:22</ref> Mills has toured the country warning Christian parents about subliminal messages in [[rock music]].<ref name="devil" />

Some Christian websites have claimed that backmasking is widely used for Satanic purposes.<ref name="robinson" /> The web page for Alabama group [[Dial-the-Truth Ministries]] argues for the existence of Satanic backmasking in "[[Stairway to Heaven]]", saying that the song contains the backward message, "It's my sweet Satan&nbsp;… Oh I will sing because I live with Satan."<ref name="watkins" /> The website of Australian group Bible Believers quotes from Jacob Aranza's ''Backward Masking Unmasked'' regarding William Yarroll's proposed physiology of the mechanism by which messages in music reach the subconscious:
<blockquote>
[A]t the base of the brain there is a "check valve", the Reticular Activating System. Based on prior programmed values, emotional responses, and our conditioning, a message will be accepted or rejected&nbsp;… If this interpretive process fails to match the message to the logical, conscious brain hemisphere, it is passed on into the next hemisphere for further evaluation. If the left conscious brain can find no known matching information, the creative right takes over the decoding process. As the right hemisphere mirrors the strange message&nbsp;… the message is acknowledged and stored.
</blockquote>
The Bible Believers website also quotes from a 1983 ''Psychology Today'' issue in which a Dr. Silverman writes that "the perception of stimuli too weak to be consciously recognized&nbsp;… is a real phenomenon that has been demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt."<ref>{{cite web |title=Singing Death |publisher=Bible Believers |url=http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/aonc04.htm |accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref>

====PMRC====
In 1985, Dr. [[Joe Stuessy]] testified to the [[United States Congress]] at the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] hearings that:
<blockquote>
The message [of a piece of heavy metal music] may also be covert or subliminal. Sometimes subaudible tracks are mixed in underneath other, louder tracks. These are heard by the subconscious but not the conscious mind. Sometimes the messages are audible but are backward, called backmasking. There is disagreement among experts regarding the effectiveness of subliminals. We need more research on that.<ref name="pmrc">United States Senate (1985). [http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/ Record Labeling: Hearing before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]. United States Senate, Ninety-ninth Congress, First Session on Contents of Music and the Lyrics of Records (September 19, 1985). Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office. Pages 118–125. Available at Joesapt.net, Retrieved on [[2007-06-09]].</ref>
</blockquote>
Stuessy's written testimony stated that:
<blockquote>
Some messages are presented to the listener backwards. While listening to a normal forward message (often somewhat nonsensical), one is simultaneously being treated to a backwards message (in other words, the lyric sounds like one set of words going forward, and a different set of words going backwards). Some experts believe that while the conscious mind is absorbing the forward lyric, the subconscious is working overtime to decipher the backwards message.<ref name="pmrc" />
</blockquote>

====Court cases====
Serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]], on trial in 1988, stated that [[AC/DC]]'s music, and specifically the song "[[Night Prowler]]" on ''[[Highway to Hell (album)|Highway to Hell]]'', inspired him to commit murder.<ref name="watkins">{{cite web |last=Watkins |first=Terry |title=Rock Music: The Devil's Advocate |publisher=[[Dial-the-Truth Ministries]] |url=http://www.av1611.org/rock.html |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> [[Reverse speech]] advocate [[David John Oates]] claimed that ''[[Highway to Hell (song)|Highway to Hell]]'', on the same album, contains backmasked messages including "I'm the law", "my name is Lucifer", and "she belongs in hell".<ref>Von Ulrich, Meyerratken (June 1997).

In 1990, British [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Judas Priest]] was sued over a [[suicide pact]] made by two [[Nevada]] schoolboys. The lawsuit by their families claimed that the 1978 Judas Priest album ''[[Stained Class]]'' contained hidden messages, including the forward subliminal words "Do it" in the song "[[Better By You, Better Than Me]]" , and various backward subliminal messages. The case was dismissed by the judge for insufficient evidence of Judas Priest's placement of subliminal messages on the record,<ref>Vokey, 250</ref> and the judge's ruling stated that "The scientific research presented does not establish that subliminal stimuli, even if perceived, may precipitate conduct of this magnitude. There exist other factors which explain the conduct of the deceased independent of the subliminal stimuli."<ref>{{cite web |last=Sophia |first=Cassiel |title=Subliminal Suicide? |publisher=Metareligion |url=http://www.meta-religion.com/Secret_societies/Conspiracies/Mind_Control/subliminal_suicide.htm |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Judas Priest members commented that if they wanted to insert subliminal commands in their music, messages leading to the deaths of their fans would be counterproductive, and they would prefer to insert the command "Buy more of our records."<ref>Van Taylor, David. KNPB Channel 5 Public Broadcasting, 1982: ''Dream Deceivers: The Story Behind James Vance Vs. Judas Priest''.</ref>

=== Skepticism ===
[[Skepticism|Skeptic]] [[Michael Shermer]] claims that the emergence of the [[Paul is dead]] phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of "[[I'm So Tired]]", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern. Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong [[pattern recognition]] ability that was necessary to process the large amount of [[noise]] in man's environment, but that today this ability leads to [[false positive]]s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shermer |first=Michael |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man |year=2005 |month=May |publisher=Scientific American |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000EB977-12BE-1264-8F9683414B7FFE9F |accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> [[Stanford University]] psychology professor Brian Wandell postulates that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility, and argues that subliminal persuasion theories are "bizarre" and "implausible."<ref name="seattle">{{cite news |last=Holguin |first=Jaime |title=Backmasking unmasked!

Audio engineer [[Evan Olcott]] claims that messages by artists including Queen and Led Zeppelin are coincidental [[phonetic reversal]]s, in which the spoken or sung [[phoneme]]s form new combinations of words when listened to backwards.<ref name="ev" /> Olcott states that "Actually engineering or planning a phonetic reversal is next to impossible, and even more difficult when trying to design it with words that fit into a song."<ref name="ev2" />

In 1985, psychologists [[John Vokey]] and [[J. Don Read]] conducted a study using [[Psalm 23]] from the [[Bible]], [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]", and other sound passages made up for the experiment. Vokey and Read concluded that if backmasking does exist, it is ineffective. Participants had trouble noticing backmasked phrases when the samples were played forwards, were unable to judge the types of messages (Christian, Satanic, or commercial), and were not led to behave in a certain way as a result of being exposed to the backmasked phrases. Vokey concluded that "we could find no effect of the meaning of engineered, backward messages on listeners’ behaviour, either consciously or unconsciously."<ref>Vokey, 249</ref> Similar results to Vokey and Read's were obtained by D. Averill in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |last=Averill |first=D. |date=[[1982-09-12]] |title=Did the Devil make you do it? |publisher=Tulsa World |page=17}} Cited in Zusne, 79</ref> A 1988 experiment by T.E.

The finding of backward Satanic messages has been explained as caused by the [[observer-expectancy effect]]. The ''[[Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' states that "you probably won't hear [backmasked] messages until somebody first points them out to you. Perception is influenced by expectation and expectation is affected by what others prime you for."<ref>{{cite web |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |title=backwards satanic messages (backmasking) |work=The [[Skeptic's Dictionary]] |date=[[2006-12-28]] |url=http://www.skepdic.com/backward.html |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> In 1984, S.
