'''''Carnivàle''''', pronounced /{{IPA|kɑɹ.nɪ'væl}}/ ("car-nih-VAL"),<ref>Per several DVD audio commentaries by the producers</ref> is an American [[television series]] set in the United States during the [[Great Depression]]. In tracing the lives of two disparate groups of people, its overarching story depicts the battle between [[good and evil]] and the struggle between [[free will]] and [[destiny]]; the storyline mixes [[Christianity|Christian]] theology with [[gnosticism]] and [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lore, particularly that of the [[Knights Templar]]. The show was filmed in [[Santa Clarita, California]] and other [[Southern California]]n locations.

''Carnivàle'' was produced by [[Home Box Office|HBO]] and ran for two seasons between [[September 14]], [[2003]] and [[March 27]], [[2005]].
The show was created by [[Daniel Knauf]], who also served as executive producer with [[Howard Klein]]. The incidental music was composed by [[Jeff Beal]]. [[Nick Stahl]] and [[Clancy Brown]] starred as [[Ben Hawkins]] and [[Brother Justin Crowe]], respectively.

Early reviews praised its style but questioned the approach and execution of the story. ''Carnivàle'''s debut episode set a new viewership record for an HBO original series,<ref name=variety_solid /> but was unable to retain its ratings in its second season. ''Carnivàle'' was canceled after 24 episodes, cutting its intended six-season run short by four seasons. The show won five [[Emmys]] in 2004, was nominated for 10 further Emmy awards, and received numerous other nominations and industry awards between 2004 and 2006.<ref name=imdb_award />

==Plot introduction==
{{main|Fictional universe of Carnivàle|List of Carnivàle episodes}}
The two seasons of ''Carnivàle'' take place in the Depression-era [[dust bowl]] between 1934 and 1935, and consist of two main plotlines that are slowly converging. The first involves a young man with strange healing powers named [[Ben Hawkins]] ([[Nick Stahl]]), who joins a traveling [[carnival]] when it passes near his home in [[Milfay, Oklahoma]]. Soon thereafter, Ben begins having surreal dreams and visions, which set him on the trail of a man named Henry Scudder, a drifter who crossed paths with the carnival many years before, and who apparently possessed unusual abilities similar to Ben's own. 

The second plotline revolves around a [[Father Coughlin]]-esque [[Methodist]] preacher, [[Brother Justin Crowe]] ([[Clancy Brown]]), who lives with his sister in [[California]]. He shares Ben's prophetic dreams and slowly discovers the extent of his own unearthly powers, which include bending human beings to his [[will (philosophy)|will]] and making their sins and greatest evils manifest in the form of terrifying visions. Certain that he is doing God's work, Brother Justin fully devotes himself to his religious duties, not realising that his ultimate nemesis Ben Hawkins and the carnival are slowly drawing closer.

==Production==
===Conception===

[[Daniel Knauf]] conceived the initial script for the show in 1990 when he was unsatisfied with his job as a Californian [[health insurance]] [[Insurance broker|broker]] and hoped to become a [[screenwriter]]. He named the intended [[feature film]] script ''Carnivàle'' because of its plot setting but chose the unusual spelling for a more outlandish look. Knauf had plotted the story's broad strokes from early on and knew where ''Carnivàle'' would be heading, including the last scene, but he noticed he had difficulties with the length of the script: With 180 pages, it was about twice the length of an average feature film script; at the same time, he felt the script was still too compressed to do his story justice, so he shelved it as a learning experience. In the meantime, all but one of Knauf's other scripts were rejected by [[Hollywood]] studios, often for being "too weird."<ref name=theage>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/TV--Radio/Freaking-hell/2004/12/14/1102787083353.html |title=Freaking hell |date=[[December 16]], [[2004]] |publisher=theage.com.au |accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref><ref name=tca />

In the mid-1990s, Knauf met a few [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] TV writers who inspired him to revise his ''Carnivàle'' story for television. Knauf turned the script's first act into a [[pilot episode]], but having no contacts in the television business, he was forced to shelve the project again and returned to his regular job. A few years later, Knauf found his old career not working out and decided to give his screenwriter efforts a last chance by offering the ''Carnivàle'' pilot on his website. The script was subsequently forwarded to [[Howard Klein]] via [[Scott Winant]], a mutual friend of the two men. After several meetings and conversations, Klein felt confident that ''Carnivàle'' would make a good episodic television series that could last for many years. Klein then brought it to the attention of [[Chris Albrecht]] and Carolyn Strauss of [[HBO]], who were receptive immediately.<ref name=theage /><ref name=variety_creation>{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117906608.html?categoryid=1734&cs=1 |title=''Carnivale'' &ndash; Where mysticism's often meted out in meticulously slow fashion |date=[[June 16]], [[2004]] |publisher=variety.com |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref><ref name=dvd_museum>''The Museum of Television & Radio's William S.

The pilot episode, which was filmed over a period of twenty-one days, served as the basis for additional tweaking of intended story lines. Knauf did not mind these changes because he had always considered a certain amount of story flexibility in his original script. Supplemental material was written mainly for Brother Justin's side, but creative discussions among the writers and the network postponed the filming of the second episode for fourteen further months.<ref name=yahoo_msg11817>[http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/11817 Daniel Knauf at Yahoo Carnivale HBO] (registration required) ([[February 21]], [[2005]]).

But after seeing the preliminary pilot, Knauf and the producers realized that there was no room for him to grow in a television series. Hence it was decided to make Brother Justin an ordinary [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] in a little town, setting him back in his career for about one or two years. When deciding a specific affiliation for Brother Justin, Knauf contested plans to make him a [[Catholic]] priest and rather settled on the [[Methodist]] denomination, which he perceived as significantly less suspicious and controversial. Expanding Brother Justin's role opened new possibilities, and the character of Iris was created as a supporting character around him. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side; only the Dreifuss family was added after a ''Carnivàle'' consultant called attention to his research about families managing cootch ([[striptease]]) shows in the 1930s.<ref name=carni_iw_jan04>{{cite web |url=http://carnivaleinterviews.blogspot.com/2004_01_01_archive.html |title=Interview with Daniel Knauf &ndash; Part 1 |date=[[January 12]], [[2004]] |publisher=Beth Blighton at carnivaleinterviews.blogspot.com |accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref><ref name=yahoo_msg29014>[http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/29014 Daniel Knauf at Yahoo Carnivale HBO] (registration required) ([[July 14]], [[2006]]).

===Format===

The ''Carnivàle'' story was originally intended to take place over three cycles or books, each one lasting two seasons, for a total of six seasons.<ref name=hbo_msg683555>[http://boards.hbo.com/thread.jspa?threadID=300000617&messageID=300683555#300683555 Daniel Knauf (fboffo) at HBO forums] ([[April 17]], [[2005]]). Retrieved on [[2007-07-28]].</ref> This plan was abruptly changed when HBO canceled the show after only two seasons, although the first two seasons of ''Carnivàle'' still make up one finished book. Each season consists of twelve episodes.

Airing on [[HBO]] benefited ''Carnivàle'' in several ways. Because HBO does not rely on commercial breaks, ''Carnivàle'' had the artistic freedom to vary in episode length. Although the episodes averaged a runtime of 54 minutes, the episodes "Insomnia" and "Old Cherry Blossom Road" significantly departed with lengths of 46 minutes and 59 minutes, respectively. HBO budgeted approximately [[US$]]4&nbsp;million for each episode, considerably more than what most television series receive.<ref name=toledo /><ref name=yahoo_msg23186>[http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/23186 Daniel Knauf at Yahoo Carnivàle HBO] (registration required) ([[July 19]], [[2005]]).

Retrieved on [[2007-07-31]].</ref> This increased ''Carnivàle'''s production value, allowing for a comparably large main cast, filming on location, and developing story, plot depth, and atmosphere.

Although almost every episode has a distinguished story with a [[Fictional universe of Carnivàle#Route of the carnival|new carnival setting]], all episodes are part of an overarching [[Good and evil|good-versus-evil]] story that only culminates and resolves very late in Season 2. Many storylines are left ambiguous for long periods, such as the [[Fictional universe of Carnivàle#Genealogy|genealogical links between main characters]] and the significance of real-world mysteries like the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Saunière]] manuscript [[Fictional universe of Carnivàle|in the show]]; the good or evil nature of the main characters are shady in the first season as well.<ref name=hbo_dknauf2>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/behind/daniel_knauf2.shtml |title="One More Look, Behind the Curtain" &ndash; Daniel Knauf |publisher=hbo.com |accessdate=2007-08-11}}</ref> Show creator [[Daniel Knauf]] reassured critics about the show's destination by explaining that ''Carnivàle'' was deliberately written to be open to interpretation to some extent, including the interpretation of the writer,<ref name=yahoo_msg13714>[http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/13714 Daniel Knauf at Yahoo Carnivàle HBO] (registration required) ([[March 2]], [[2005]]).

===Filming locations===

''Carnivàle'''s interiors were filmed at Santa Clarita Studios in [[Santa Clarita, California]], while the show's many exterior scenes were filmed on [[Southern California]]n locations. The fictional Californian town of Mintern where the stories about Brother Justin and Iris in Season 1 were based were shot at [[Movie ranch#Paramount Movie Ranch|Paramount Ranch]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. The carnival set itself was moved around the greater Southern California area, to [[movie ranch]]es and to [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], which were to replicate the states of [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]].<ref name=tca>{{cite web |url=http://www.centimes.demon.co.uk/Fragments/carnivaletcatranscript.html |title=Summer 2003 Cable TCA Press Tour |date=[[July 10]], [[2003]] |accessdate=2007-08-11}}</ref><ref name=roswell>{{cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C79952%7C1%7C,00.html |title='Roswell' Writer Leaves 'Battlestar' for a 'Carnivale' |date=[[January 30]], [[2003]] |publisher=zap2it.com |accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref>

===Opening title sequence===
[[Image:Carnivale Tarot Cards in Opening Title Sequence.jpg|thumb|One frame of ''Carnivàle'''s opening title sequence]]
''Carnivàle'''s opening title sequence was created by A52, a [[visual effects]] and design company based in [[Los Angeles]], and featured music composed by [[Wendy Melvoin]] and [[Lisa Coleman (musician)|Lisa Coleman]].<ref name=a52>{{cite web |url=http://www.darnellworks.com/a52/nr0052.htm |title=A52 Masters Fate in New Main Title Sequence for HBO's Carnivàle |date=[[September 15]], [[2003]] |publisher=darnellworks.com |accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref> The opening title sequence won an [[Emmy]] for "Outstanding Main Title Design" in 2004.<ref name=emmy />

The production team of A52 had intended to "create a title sequence that grounded viewers in the mid-1930s, but that also allowed people to feel a larger presence of [[good and evil]] over all of time."<ref name=a52 /> A52 then pitched their idea to ''Carnivàle'' executives in early 2003, who felt that the company's proposal was the most creative for the series' concept. The actual production included scanned transparencies of famous pieces of artwork, each scanned transparency being up to 300&nbsp;MB in size. The resulting images were [[photoshopped]] and [[Rendering (computer graphics)|digitally rendered]]. A last step involved stock footage clips being carefully compiled and digitally incorporated into the sequence.<ref name=a52 />

The [http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/behind/credits/index.html opening title sequence] itself begins with a deck of [[Tarot card]]s falling into the sand, while the camera moves in and enters one card into a separate world presenting layers of artwork and footage from iconic moments of the [[United States|American]] [[Depression era]]; the camera then moves back out of a different card and repeats the procedure several times. The sequence ends with the camera shifting from the "[[Judgement (Tarot card)|Judgement]]" Tarot card to the "[[The Moon (Tarot card)|Moon]]" and the "[[The Sun (Tarot card)|Sun]]", identifying the [[Devil]] and [[God]] respectively, until the wind blows away all cards and the underlaying sand to reveal the ''Carnivàle'' title artwork.<ref name=a52 /><ref name=hbo_opening_titles>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/behind/credits/index.html |title=Carnivàle Opening Credits |publisher=hbo.com |accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref>

===Music===

''Carnivàle'' features instrumental music composed by [[Jeff Beal]], as well as many popular and obscure songs from the 1920s and 1930s, the time when ''Carnivàle'''s story takes place. The main title was written by [[Wendy Melvoin]] and [[Lisa Coleman (musician)|Lisa Coleman]], and was released with selected themes by Jeff Beal on a ''Carnivàle'' television soundtrack by the record label [[Varese Sarabande]] on [[December 7]], [[2004]].

Jeff Beal's score is primarily orchestral but mixes themes of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] as well as atmospheric rhythmic and synthesized sounds. Bigger group of strings support smaller ensembles of [[guitar]]s, [[piano]]s, [[violin]]s, [[cello]]s and [[trumpet]]s. The music sometimes uses ethnical instruments such as [[banjo]]s, [[harmonica]]s, [[ukulele]]s and [[duduk]]s.<ref name=origscore_de>{{cite web |url=http://www.original-score.de/index.php/site/kritik/carnivale/ |title= Kritiken &ndash; Carnivale (Jeff Beal) |date=[[January 31]], [[2007]] | publisher=original-score.de | language = [[German language|German]] |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref>

Because HBO does not break individual episodes with commercials, ''Carnivàle'''s music is paced similar to a movie, with character-specific [[leitmotif]]s since as early as the first episode. Characters get musically identified by solo instruments chosen for the character's ethnical background or nature. Some characters whose connections would only be disclosed later in the series have intentionally similar themes.<ref name=hbo_kedel_apats>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/behind/music_supervisors.shtml |title= "From Wang-Wang to Bouzouki" &ndash; Kevin Edelman & Alexandra Patsavas | publisher=hbo.com |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref>

Different music is consciously used to represent the two different worlds of the story. Brother Justin's world features music of constructed orchestral sound with religious music and instruments. On the other hand, the score of the carnival side is more deconstructed and mystical, especially when the carnival travels through the [[dustbowl]] and remote towns. For carnival scenes taking places in the cootch ([[striptease]]) show or in cities, however, contemporary [[pop music]], [[blues]], [[folk music|folk]], and ethnic music is played.<ref name=origscore_de /><ref name=hbo_jbeal>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/behind/jeff_beal.shtml |title= "Mood Music" &ndash; Jeff Beal | publisher=hbo.com |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> One of the most defining songs of ''Carnivàle'' is the 1920s song "[[Love Me or Leave Me (song)|Love Me or Leave Me]]" by [[Ruth Etting]], which is used in several episodes to tie Brother Justin and several other characters thematically, and the two worlds altogether.<ref name=hbo_kedel_apats />

===Casting===

Apart from casting the best available actors as in any other project, the [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]] approach for ''Carnivàle'' was to show the characters' realness as opposed to depending on [[freak]] illusions too much, although ''Carnivàle'''s casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O'Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were willing to make exceptions such as for [[Adrienne Barbeau]] as Ruthie.<ref name=hbo_jpap>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/behind/casting_directors.shtml |title="Beyond the Standard Fare" &ndash; John Papsidera |publisher=hbo.com |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>

The script for the pilot episode was the basis for the casting procedure, with little indication where the show would go afterwards. This resulted in some preliminary casting disagreements between the creators and producers, especially for leading characters such as Ben, Brother Justin and Sofie. The character of Ben was always intended to be the leading man and hero of the series, yet he was also desired to display a youthful, innocent and anti-hero quality; [[Nick Stahl]] had the most consensus by the producers. The character of Sofie was originally written as more of an exotic [[gypsy]] girl, and [[Clea Duvall]] stated needing four auditions to get the part; Duvall, a movie actor like Stahl, had wanted to try for a regular role on television in the line of HBO when the opportunity for ''Carnivàle'' came up. [[Tim DeKay]] was cast as Jonesy because the producers felt he best portrayed a "very American" looking [[baseball player]] of that period. One of the only actors who never had any real competition was [[Michael J. Anderson]] as Samson, whom Daniel Knauf had wanted as early as the initial meeting.<ref name=dvd_museum /><ref name=hbo_jpap />

==Cancellation and future==

[[HBO]] traditionally carries many of its shows through to an end, but stagnant low ratings and increasing production expenses made ''Carnivàle'''s future beyond a second season uncertain. Since HBO makes their commitments only for one year at a time, a third season would have meant to open up a new two-season book in [[Daniel Knauf]]'s six-year plan, including introducing new storylines for current and new characters, and further clarifying and elaborating on the show's mythology.<ref name=yahoo_msg17804>[http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/17804 Daniel Knauf at Yahoo Carnivàle HBO] (registration required) ([[April 1]], [[2005]]).

== Reception ==
=== Ratings ===

''Carnivàle'' aired on [[HBO]] on a Sunday 9:00PM timeslot during its two-season run between 2003 and 2005. "Milfay", ''Carnivàle'''s pilot episode, drew 5.3&nbsp;million viewers for its premiere on [[September 14]], [[2003]]. This marked the best ever debut for an HBO original series at the time, caused in part by established HBO series ''[[Sex and the City]]'' being the show's lead-in. HBO series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', debuting as the lead-out of ''[[The Sopranos]]'', would beat this record with 5.8&nbsp;million viewers half a year later, on [[March 21]], [[2004]].<ref name=variety_solid>{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117892559.html?categoryid=1275&cs=1 |title= Solid 'Carnivale' start after HBO's hot 'Sex' |publisher=variety.com |date=[[September 16]], [[2003]] |accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref><ref name=variety_rome>{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117928342.html?categoryid=1275&cs=1 |title= HBO 'Rome' ratings not built in a day |publisher=variety.com |date=[[August 30]], [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>

Viewership dropped to 3.49 million viewers for ''Carnivàle'''s second episode but remained stable for the remainder of the season. The final episode of season one finished with 3.5 million viewers on [[November 30]], [[2003]]. Season one averaged 3.54 viewers and a household rating of 2.41.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quotenmeter.de/index.php?cat=115 |title= US cable ratings (compiled statistics from September 7 till November 30, 2003) |language=[[German language|German]] |publisher=quotenmeter.de |accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>

The second season opened with 1.81 millions viewers on [[January 9]], [[2005]], down by two thirds of its debut viewership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?date=01/12/05&id=6804 |title= Development update: January 12 |publisher=thefutoncritic.com |date=[[January 12]], [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> The ratings never recovered to their first-season highs, although the season two finale experienced an upswing, finishing the season with 2.40 million viewers on [[March 27]], [[2005]].

=== Critical reviews===

Many early reviews gave ''Carnivàle'' good marks but also stated that its unique characters and story might prevent it from becoming a huge mainstream audience success.<ref name=cnn /> ''[[Daily Variety]]'' TV editor Joseph Adalian predicted that "it will get mostly positive reviews but some people will be put off by the general weirdness of the show."<ref name=cnn>{{cite web | last=Doty | first=Meriah | title=Taking a tour with 'Carnivàle' | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/11/sprj.caf03.carnivale/ |date=[[September 11]], [[2003]] | publisher = cnn.com | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> Phil Gallo of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described ''Carnivàle'' as "an absolute visual stunner with compelling freak-show characters&mdash;but the series unfortunately takes a leisurely approach toward getting to a point,"<ref name=variety_review1>{{cite web | last=Gallo | first=Phil | title=Recently Reviewed &ndash; Carnivàle | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117921817.html?categoryid=32&cs=1 |date=[[September 11]], [[2003]] | publisher=variety.com | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> whereas James Poniewozik of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called the first three episodes "frustrating" as well as "spellbinding."<ref name=time.com>{{cite web | last=Poniewozik | first=James | title = HBO's Cirque du So-So | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,483299,00.html |date=[[September 7]], [[2003]] | publisher=time.com | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> Amanda Murray of [[BBC]] said "With so little revealed, it's almost impossible to pass judgment on the show&mdash;it's hard to tell if this is just good, or going to be great."<ref name=bbc>{{cite web | last=Murray | first=Amanda | title=Review: Carnivale | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2004/09/13/14282.shtml |date=[[September 13]], [[2004]] | publisher=bbc.co.uk | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> 

Later DVD reviews were able to judge the series on the basis of full seasons. While the acting, set design, costuming, art direction and cinematography continued to be praised,<ref name=dvdtalk>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?id=13501 |title=Carnivàle: Complete First Season | publisher=dvdtalk.com | accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref><ref name=ugo>{{cite web | last=Enk | first=Bryan | title=Carnivale: Season Two (HBO) | url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/carnivaleseasontwo/review.asp | publisher=ugo.com | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> some reviewers disfavored the writing, especially of Season 1, as "lack[ing] story momentum"<ref name=ugo /> or as "sometimes gripping but mostly boring."<ref name=filmfreakcentral>{{cite web | last=Chaw | first=Walter | title=Carnivàle: The Complete First Season | url=http://filmfreakcentral.net/dvdreviews/carnivale.htm | publisher=filmfreakcentral.net | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> Other reviewers pointed out that ''Carnivàle'' may "demand more from its audience than many are willing to invest. [...] Without paying close attention, it's tempting to assume that the show is unnecessarily cryptic and misleading."<ref name=dvdtalk /> ''Carnivàle'''s story was surveyed as long and complex, "and if you don't start from the beginning, you'll be completely lost."<ref name=dreadcentral>{{cite web | last=Kasch | first=Andrew | title = Carnivàle: The Complete Second Season (DVD) | url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/index.php?name=Reviews&req=showcontent&id=1066 |date=[[September 8]], [[2006]] | publisher=dreadcentral.com | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>

A significant portion of reviews drew parallels between ''Carnivàle'' and [[David Lynch]]'s 1990s mystery TV series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'',<ref name=cnn /><ref name=bbc /><ref name=ugo /><ref name=filmfreakcentral /> a show that ''Carnivàle'' actor [[Michael J. Anderson]] had previously appeared in as a memorable character. Knauf did not deny a stylistic link and also made comparisons to [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[Grapes of Wrath]]''.<ref name=hbo_dknauf>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/behind/daniel_knauf.shtml |title= "The Making of a Magnificent Delusion" &ndash; Daniel Knauf | publisher=hbo.com |accessdate=2007-08-09}}</ref><ref name=bally_dan />

=== Fandom ===

As ''Carnivàle'' slowly grew and matured during its first season, the series gained a respectable following of dedicated viewers, as is typical for many [[cult television]] series.<ref name=ugo /><ref name=dreadcentral /> ''Carnivàle'' fans referred to themselves as "Carnies" or "Rousties" ([[roustabout]]s), terms adopted from the show.<ref name=carnycon>{{cite web |url=http://www.savecarnivale.org/html/carnies.htm |title = Summary of CarnyCon 2006 | date=August 2006 | publisher=savecarnivale.org | accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref> 

With its complexity and subliminal mythology, ''Carnivàle'' spawned dedicated [[fansite]]s, although most discussion took place on independent [[internet forum]]s. Show creator [[Daniel Knauf]] actively participated in online fandom and offered story- and mythology-related clues; he even gave insight into reasons for ''Carnivàle'''s cancellation on a messageboard before speaking to the press.<ref name=yahoo_msg20320 /> As of July 2007, he is still in contact with the show's fandom and posts semi-regularly on ''Carnivàle'' messageboards.<ref>{{cite newsgroup | title=Yahoo Carnivàle HBO | url=http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO }}</ref>

One year after ''Carnivàle'''s cancellation, a major ''Carnivàle'' convention called [http://www.carnycon.com/ CarnyCon 2006 Live!] was organized by fans, and took place in [[Woodland Hills]], [[California]] from August 21 till 23, 2006. Many of the show's cast and crew attended the event and participated in discussion panels. The convention was recorded and made available on [[DVD]] afterwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carnycon.com/dvd.html |title=Convention DVD |publisher=carnycon.com |accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref>

=== Awards ===

Despite its short two-season run, ''Carnivàle'' received numerous awards and nominations.<ref name=imdb_award>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319969/awards |title=Awards for "Carnivàle" |publisher=imdb.com |accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref><ref name=emmy>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/2007pt/history.php |title=Primetime Awards |publisher=emmys.org |accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> The show's inaugural season received nominations for seven [[Emmy Awards]] in 2004, winning five including "Outstanding Art Direction For A Single-camera Series" and "Outstanding Costumes For A Series" for the pilot episode "Milfay", "Outstanding Cinematography For A Single-Camera Series" for the episode "Pick A Number", "Outstanding Hairstyling For A Series" for the episode "After the Ball Is Over", and "Outstanding Main Title Design".

=== International reception and broadcasters ===

[[HBO]] president [[Chris Albrecht]] stated that ''Carnivàle'' was not very successful in foreign distribution,<ref name=toledo>{{cite web |url=http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050720/ART18/507200317 |title = Funny business |date=[[July 20]], [[2005]] | publisher=toledoblade.com | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> but did not divulge any further. Reviews however indicate that the show's cryptic mythology and  inaccessibility to the casual viewer were major factors. Nevertheless, ''Carnivàle'' was sold to several foreign networks as well as being distributed to HBO channels abroad. The DVD releases of ''Carnivàle'' further extended the availability of the show.

Countries and channels that broadcasted ''Carnivàle'' include:
* {{AUS}} on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]
* {{BEL}} on [[Canvas (Belgium)|Canvas]], in 2005 and 2006
* {{BRA}} on [[SBT]] and HBO Brasil

==Lawsuit==

On [[June 9]], [[2005]], [[Los Angeles]] writer Jeff Bergquist filed a lawsuit to the [[United States district court]] claiming that the creators of ''Carnivàle'' did not originate the idea for the show, but rather stole it from his unpublished novel ''Beulah'', a quirky drama set amid a traveling carnival during the Depression that Bergquist had been working on since the 1980s. Bergquist claimed that [[HBO]] and ''Carnivàle'' creator [[Daniel Knauf]] violated his copyright on ''Beulah'' and sought both recognition and punitive damages, but HBO and Knauf denied any claims as having "absolutely no merit."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05178/528920.stm |title=TV Notes: 'Carnivàle' copied? |date=[[June 27]], [[2005]] |publisher=post-gazette.com |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref> The case was [[Prejudice (law)|dismissed with prejudice]] on [[February 17]], [[2006]].<ref>http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleLawsuit/ (registration required to access case documents).
