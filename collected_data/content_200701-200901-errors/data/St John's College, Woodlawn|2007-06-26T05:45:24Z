'''St John's College, Woodlawn''' is a Catholic systemic secondary school, located in the rural area of "Woodlawn" on the outskirts of [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].<br />

In the city of Lismore the four largest industries by employment are; retail sector, health care, education and agriculture. Woodlawn being originally an agricultural college has a major part in directly two of those sectors and of course indirectly in the other two as well.<br />

"Woodlawn" is often what the school is shortened to rather than being named fully, and its name holds pride and honour throughout the community after building its name for 75 years. The School was founded by the Marists who have continued to play a role in the running of the school ever since, the first non-'Marist' Rector (now called Principal) is Glenn Roff who is the current Principal.

== History ==
St John's College, Woodlawn, was founded from St Patrick's College, [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] in 1931.  The Marists who began the school themselves originated in France in the early 19th century. <br />
St John's College was '''formally opened in 1931''' as a Boarding and Day school on land which was donated by Miss Margaret Buckley. The first Rector of the school was Fr Thomas Segreif S.M, Followed by Fr James Bell S.M, Fr John Kennedy S.M, Fr John Webber S.M, Fr Steven Maloney S.M, Fr Sid Mitchell S.M, Fr John Webber S.M, Fr Garry Reynolds S.M, Fr Lou Malloy S.M, Fr John Worthington S.M, Fr William Ryder S.M, Fr Ray Chapman S.M and the current Principal is Glenn Roff.

'''The College was described in the Northern Star on May 25th 1931;<br />'''
''"St John's Educational and Agricultural College at Woodlawn, on the outskirts of Lismore, and architectural jewel adorning the pastoral diadem of the North Coast, is destined to make history throughout all States of the [[Commonwealth]]. Its inspiration is eloquent tribute to the zeal, enthusiasm and practical outlook of that order of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the Marist Fathers."''
          
=== 75th Anniversary ===
St John's College Woodlawn celebrated its '''75th Anniversary''' in 2006. The College held many events throughout the year to celebrate, ranging from the first "Woodlawn Race Day", to "St John's Youth Day" and formal ceremonies. The opening of the renovated Chapel was a central part of the ceremonies, with hundreds of Alumni returning to be apart of the celebrations.

After the Woodlawn Race Day (also known as the Woodlawn Cup), the College executive in association with the Parents and Friends executive decided to hold the day annually.

== Mission Statement==
'''The College Mission Statement'''<br />
''St John's College, Woodlawn builds on its traditions as a welcoming family, based on the [[Catholic]] faith, and aims for its members to be touched by a Christian spirituality. 
Through inspired leadership, we endeavour to assist all our community to achieve their full potential. We aim to provide an [[education]] which is relevant to the 21st century, based on a harmony of the physical, academic, cultural and spiritual.''

===The College's Motto===
''"Tenete Traditiones"'', is taken from [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'s second letter to the [[Thessalonians]]: "God called you to this through the Good News we preached to you; He called you to possess your share of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. So then, our brothers, stand firm and '''hold fast to the traditions''' which we taught you, both in our preaching and our writing". (2 Thessalonians 2:14-15)

===The College's Crest===
St John's College Woodlawn's crest shows the three colours of Woodlawn (Red, Green and Gold), and also St John's Eagle in the upper right corner, with the Society of Mary's symbol shown in the lower left corner. With ''Tenete Traditiones'' below this completes the image of the holistic parts of the college.

===The College Patron===
St John's College ''Woodlawn is named after [[St John the Evangelist]]''. St John was one of the twelve apostles and tradition tells us that he was a very close friend of Jesus. We celebrate his feast day at the beginning of the academic year. St John's symbol is the Eagle and therefore the eagle is held as an important symbol for the college. 'The [[Eagle]]' is also the title of the College annual magazine.

=== Sporting Heritage ===
St John's has a rich sporting heritage, evolving over the years from cricket and rugby on the famous green fields through to swimming with the installation of the 33 Yard Swimming pool, further expansion to now include every range of sports indoor and outdoor with the use of the college "Colin Centre" which is the indoor sports centre.

The line "We are the boys from Woodlawn C!" was changed to "We are the ones from Woodlawn C!" when the College became a co-educational institution in 1999.

==Significant Days at Woodlawn==
==='''Opening Mass'''<br />===
Is the spiritual sign for the start of the new year. The Opening mass has been held at the Lismore Cathedral to allow the entire school to attend the ceremonies and to include the Diocese in the events of Woodlawn in recent years. The opening mass is also for the distribution of badges to prefects; such as Seniors and newly appointed [[Students' Representative Council]]<br />
==='''College Swimming Carnival'''===
[[Image:Woodlawn Swimming Carnival.jpg|right|256px|thumb|Woodlawn Swimming Carnival; at Night with its great atmosphere.]]
Is respected as being the most exciting, engaged and fun night of the college, it its known as the best swimming carnival in the Northern Rivers and is the first event for the new year 12 to engage its new responsibilities. Some of the Colleges most significant moments have occurred in or at the pool, and is quickly becoming the event not to miss.<br />
==='''College Cross Country'''<br />=== 
The course varies between 3 and 3.5 Kilometres depending on year level and gender and also the time to beat varies, ranging from 30 to 40 minutes to earn extra points. The Cross Country is run over the rolling hills nearby and is notoriously easy to walk yet very challenging to run.

==='''Yr 12 Youth Day''' / '''St John's Day'''<br />===
St John's day has recently been combined with the college youth day to become "St John's Youth Day" and is the event where Yr 12 takes control and has some fun with half the day dedicated to fun activities designed by Year 12's for the rest of the college to enjoy. The profits made from the events go back through the school in the fashion of the Year 12 gift at the end of their years.<br />

==='''College Athletics Carnival'''<br />===
The Carnival has somewhat lacked some of the spirit that is flowing at the swimming carnival; however the Athletics Carnival has been moulded into more of a fun interactive day this year due to Year 12 efforts to include music, dance interludes, enhanced war cries and banners/ colour, a theme to dress up in and the first year of the Year 12 'Funny race'<br />

==='''School Socials'''<br />===   	 	
[[Image:Woodlawn_Yr12Social_2006.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Woodlawn Social; First 2006 Social, always a great night for those who want to have fun.]] 	 
Woodlawn Socials are co-ordinated between 'the disco duck' and the Year 12 to bring the social between old values and new themes and music. Woodlawn Socials are designed to give students to have a chance to dance and have fun without having to resort to alcohol.

==='''Orientation Day'''===
The first day at school for the new Year 7's next year, this introductory day gives them a chance to meet the school more intimately their new classmates and current students and staff. The Year 6 students also get introduced to their new home group; which they will stay with for the duration of their schooling. All of this with the safety of returning to their current school the next day.
==='''Final Mass'''<br />===
Final mass to sum up the year and wish all a well earned break and a happy and safe holiday.<br />
==='''Yr 12 Graduation Mass'''<br />===
One of the climaxes for the Year 12, besides the HSC and the "Grad", The Graduation mass is the final step; the final official event for Year 12, 'as one year signs off another is only beginning' The final mass is always an emotional affair with current Year 12, parents, friends, staff and students all showing their support.<br />
