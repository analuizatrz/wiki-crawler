"'''Delilah and the Space Rigger'''", a [[science fiction]] [[short story]] by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], is arguably one of the best [[feminist]] works of [[fiction]] ever written by a [[male]] [[author]]. One of his [[Future History]] stories, it originally appeared in ''Blue Book'' in December 1949 and was reprinted in his collection, ''[[The Green Hills of Earth (short story collection)|The Green Hills of Earth]]'' (and subsequently ''[[The Past Through Tomorrow]]'').

It concerns a senior [[radio]] technician who joins the crew building a [[space station]], and her dispute with the contractor who doesn't want any women aboard "sniffing around my boys." The contractor is constantly putting his foot in his mouth with remarks like, "Listen to Jones, he's a good man" only to hear a brisk retort like, "I know, I trained him."  In the end, the contractor is forced to admit that having a woman on the team has improved morale and efficiency, rather than causing a disruption, and he decides to stop discriminating on the basis of gender.
