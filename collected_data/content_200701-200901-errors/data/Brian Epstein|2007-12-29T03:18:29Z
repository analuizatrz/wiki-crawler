'''Brian Samuel Epstein''' ({{IPAEng|ˈbraɪən ˈepstaɪn}}) (born in [[Liverpool]], [[England]]; [[19 September]] [[1934]] &ndash; [[27 August]] [[1967]]) was the manager of [[The Beatles]]. He also managed several other musical artists such as [[Gerry & The Pacemakers]], [[Billy J. Kramer]] and the Dakotas, and [[Cilla Black]]. 

The Beatles recorded a demo in [[Decca Records|Decca]]'s studios—paid for by Epstein—which he later persuaded [[George Martin]] to listen to. Epstein was then offered a contract (after Martin had auditioned the group) by [[EMI]]'s small [[Parlophone]] label, even though they had previously been rejected by almost every other British record company.

Epstein died of an accidental drug overdose at his home in [[London]] in August 1967. The Beatles' early success has been attributed to Epstein's management and sense of style. [[Paul McCartney]] said of Epstein: "If anyone was the [[Fifth Beatle]], it was Brian."

[[Image:Brian Epstein 4 Years Old.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Brian Epstein at 4-years-old.]]
Epstein was born into a [[Jewish]] family in Rodney Street, Liverpool, England. His grandfather (Isaac Epstein) was from Hodan, [[Lithuania]]; he arrived in England with his wife Diana in the 1890s at the age of eighteen. He founded a [[furniture]] dealership on Walton Road, Liverpool. Diana and Isaac's third son was Harry Epstein; the father of Brian Epstein.<ref name="Spitzp255"> Spitz 2005. p255</ref> After Harry and his brothers had joined the family firm, Isaac Epstein founded "I. Epstein and Sons", and expanded his furniture business by taking over an adjacent shop to sell a varied range of other goods, such as musical instruments and [[household appliances]].<ref name="Spitzp255"/> They called the new shop "NEMS" (North End Music Stores) from which McCartney's father once bought a piano.<ref name="SpitzPage71"> Spitz 2005. p71</ref><ref name="MilesPage23-24"> Miles 1997 pp23-24.</ref>

Epstein's mother was formally named Malka (although always known by her family as Queenie—Malka translating as "queen" in [[Hebrew]]) and was a member of the successful Hyman furniture family. Harry and Queenie also had another son, Clive. During [[World War II|WWII]] the Epsteins moved to [[Southport]] to escape [[The Blitz]]—where two schools expelled Epstein for laziness and poor performance—but returned to Liverpool in 1945.<ref name="Spitzp257"> Spitz 2005. p257</ref> The Epsteins lived at 127 Queens Drive, [[Childwall]], in Liverpool, and stayed there for 30 years.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=htl2U1fPq8QC&pg=PA326&lpg=PA326&dq=rembrandt+mccartney&source=web&ots=Wm_6NQl0wz&sig=6nc0oRgcn8PxOVqoY7lXFoRJa70#PPA326,M1 The Rough Guide to the Beatles] google.com/books - Retrieved 22 October 2007 </ref> 
After his parents had moved him from one [[boarding school]] to another, the 14-year-old Epstein spent two years at [[Wrekin College]], in [[Shropshire]]. Shortly before his sixteenth birthday in 1950, he sent a long letter to his father, explaining that he wanted to become a [[Fashion design|dress designer]], but Harry Epstein was adamantly opposed to this idea, and his son finally had to "report for duty" at the family's furniture shop.<ref name="Spitzp258-259"> Spitz 2005. pp258-259</ref> 

In December 1951, Epstein was [[Conscription|drafted]]—as a [[Data entry clerk|clerk]]—into the [[Royal Army Service Corps]], and was posted to the [[Albany Street Barracks]] near [[Regent's Park]], in [[London]], where he was often reprimanded for not picking up his army [[Salary|pay]].<ref name="Spitzp259"> Spitz 2005. p259</ref> 

In 1955, at the age of twenty-one, Epstein was made a director of NEMS. In September of 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend, but after being there for only one day, he was robbed of his [[passport]], [[birth certificate]], [[cheque]]book, [[wristwatch]], and all the money he had on him. As he did not want his parents to find out, he worked as [[department store]] [[clerk]] until he had earned enough money to buy a train ticket back to Liverpool.<ref name="Spitzp261"> Spitz 2005. p261</ref> Back in Liverpool, he confessed "everything" to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions Epstein had revealed his ambition of becoming an [[actor]], so his parents allowed him go to London to study.<ref name="Spitzp261"/>      

Epstein attended the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) in London. His RADA classmates included actors [[Susannah York]], [[Albert Finney]] and [[Peter O'Toole]], but Epstein dropped out after the third term. Back in Liverpool, Harry Epstein put his son in charge of the record department of the newly-opened NEMS music store on Great Charlotte Street.<ref name="Spitzp263"> Spitz 2005. p263</ref> Epstein worked "day and night" at the store to make it a success, and it became one of the biggest musical retail outlets in the North of England.<ref name="Spitzp264"> Spitz 2005. p264</ref>

The Epsteins opened a second store at 12-14 Whitechapel, and Epstein was put in charge of the entire operation. Epstein often walked across the road to the [[Lewis's]] department store—which had a music section—where [[Peter Brown (music industry)|Peter Brown]] was employed. He watched Brown's sales technique and was impressed enough to lure Brown to work for NEMS with the offer of a higher salary and a commission on sales.<ref name="Brownp63"> Brown, Peter. 2002. p63</ref> On [[3 August]] [[1961]], Epstein started a regular music column in the ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' magazine, called, 'Record Releases, by Brian Epstein of NEMS'.<ref name="Spitzp257"> Spitz 2005. p257</ref>

The Beatles' name was supposedly first noticed by Epstein in issues of Mersey Beat, and on numerous posters around Liverpool, before asking [[Bill Harry]] who they were (Harry had previously convinced Epstein to sell the Mersey Beat magazine at NEMS).<ref name="Milesp84"> Miles 1997 p84</ref><ref name="Milesp84-85"> Miles 1997 pp84-85</ref> The Beatles were featured on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat.<ref name="Spitzp264-265"> Spitz 2005. pp264-265</ref><ref name="MilesPage88"> Miles 1997 p88</ref> The Beatles had recorded the '[[My Bonnie]]' [[Single (music)|single]] with [[Tony Sheridan]] in [[Germany]], and some months after its release Epstein asked [[Alistair Taylor]] about it in NEMS.<ref name="Spitzp265"> Spitz 2005. p265</ref> Epstein's version of the story was that a customer—Raymond Jones—walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the "My Bonnie" single, which made Epstein curious about the group.<ref name="BiographyofEpstein">[http://www.momentmag.com/features/aug06/2006-08_Epstein.html  Biography of Epstein] momentmag.com. Retrieved: 10 March 2007 </ref> 

The Beatles were due to perform a lunchtime concert in the [[Cavern Club]] on [[9 November]] [[1961]], which was not far from the NEMS store. Epstein asked Bill Harry to arrange for Epstein and his assistant Taylor to watch them perform, and Epstein and Taylor were allowed into the club without queuing, with a welcome message being announced over the club's [[PA system|public-address system]] by [[Bob Wooler]], who was the resident [[DJ]].<ref name="Spitzp266-268"> Spitz 2005. pp266-268</ref> Epstein later talked about the performance: 
{{cquote | I was immediately struck by their music, their beat, and their sense of humour on stage—and, even afterwards, when I met them, I was struck again by their personal charm. And it was there that, really, it all started.<ref name="EpsteindotCom">[http://www.brianepstein.com/ Brian Epstein web page] brianepstein.com. Retrieved: 15 March 2007 </ref> }} 
After the performance, Epstein and Taylor went into the [[dressing room]]—which was "as big a broom cupboard"—to talk to them.<ref name=”TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD”> ”The Beatles Anthology” DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:57:59) Epstein talking about his first meeting with The Beatles.</ref> The Beatles immediately recognised Epstein—as they were regular customers at NEMS—but before Epstein could congratulate them on their performance, [[George Harrison]] said, "And what brings ''Mr. Epstein'' here?"<ref name="Spitzp268"> Spitz 2005. p268</ref> 

The Beatles played at the Cavern over the next three weeks, and Epstein was always there to watch them. Epstein contacted their previous manager, [[Allan Williams]], to confirm that Williams no longer had any ties to them, but Williams advised Epstein "not to touch them with a [[barge pole]]".<ref name="Milesp75"> Miles 1997  p75</ref> In a meeting with the group at NEMS on [[10 December]] [[1961]], he proposed the idea of managing them.<ref name="MilesPage85"> Miles 1997  p85</ref> The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Epstein on [[24 January]] [[1962]].<ref name="MilesPage88"> Miles 1997  p88</ref> 

Although Epstein had had no prior experience of artist management, he had a strong influence on their early dress-code and attitude on stage. When Epstein discovered the band, they wore blue jeans and leather jackets, performing at rowdy [[rock 'n' roll]] shows where they would stop and start songs when they felt like it, or when an audience member requested a certain song. Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties, insisted that they stop [[swearing]], smoking, drinking or eating onstage, and also suggested the famous synchronised bow at the end of their performances.<ref name="Spitzp279-280"> Spitz 2005. pp279-280</ref> McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein's ideas, believing it was—in part—due to Epstein's RADA training.<ref name="Milesp96"> Miles 1997 p96</ref>

Epstein made numerous trips to London to visit record companies with the hope of securing a record contract, but was rejected by many, including [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Pye Records|Pye]], [[Philips Records|Philips]], [[Oriole Records|Oriole]], and most famously, Decca [see [[The Decca audition]]].<ref name="Milesp89"> Miles 1997 p89</ref> The Beatles later found out that Epstein had paid Decca producer [[Tony Meehan]] (ex-drummer of the [[The Shadows|Shadows]]) to produce the studio recordings.<ref name="Milesp89"> Miles 1997 p89</ref> While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he also approached [[EMI]] marketing executive Ron White, who later contacted EMI producers [[Norrie Paramor]], Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell, but they all declined to record the group.<ref>Coleman 1989 p88–89</ref><ref>Coleman 1989 p93</ref> White could not contact EMI's fourth staff producer (Martin) as he was on holiday.<ref>Coleman 1989 p93–94</ref>

On [[8 February]] [[1962]], Epstein visited a [[HMV]] store in [[Oxford Street]], London, to have the Decca audition tape transferred to disc. A [[HMV]] technician named Jim Foy liked the recordings, and suggested that Epstein should contact Parlophone's George Martin.<ref name="BeatlesHistory">[http://geocities.com/dsmurashev.geo/history/1962.htm Beatles’ History - 1962] geocities.com. Retrieved: 9 March 2007 </ref> The Beatles were signed by EMI's small Parlophone label after the group had been rejected by almost every other British record company, and without Martin ever having seen them play [[Concert|live]].<ref name="Milesp90"> Miles 1997 p90</ref> 
 
Martin scheduled an audition—at [[Abbey Road Studios]]—which convinced Martin that they were good enough, but with one exception: Martin did not like drummer [[Pete Best]]'s playing.<ref name="Milesp90"> Miles 1997 p90</ref> When the news came that Martin wanted to replace Best on their recordings with a session drummer, [[John Lennon]], McCartney and Harrison asked Epstein to fire Best from the band. Epstein agonised about the decision, and asked Bob Wooler if it was a good idea, to which Wooler replied that Best was very popular with the fans and they wouldn't like it at all.<ref name="Spitzp329"> Spitz 2005. p329</ref> [[Ringo Starr]] took his place, as Starr had previously played with [[Rory Storm|Rory Storm and the Hurricanes]], and had previously stepped in to drum with them when Best was ill or unable to play.<ref name="Milesp90"> Miles 1997 p90</ref>

The Beatles toured the [[Philippines]] in July 1966, but Epstein unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, [[Imelda Marcos]], when presented with an invitation to a breakfast party.<ref name="Spitzp619"> Spitz 2005. p619</ref> Epstein politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such official invitations.<ref name="Spitzp620"> Spitz 2005. p620</ref> The Beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel the same day and were given a police escort to the airport. They boarded the plane to fly home, but Epstein and [[Mal Evans]] were ordered off, with both believing they would not be allowed back on the plane.<ref name="Spitzp624"> Spitz 2005. p624</ref> Epstein was forced to give back most of the money that they had earned in the Philippines before being allowed back on the plane.<ref name="Spitzp625"> Spitz 2005. p625</ref> 

===After Candlestick Park===
<!-- Put references into this article or your edit will be deleted -->
The Beatles' hectic schedule of touring, television, and film work between 1963-65 kept Epstein very busy. The Beatles' last live concert was at [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco, California on [[29 August]] [[1966]], and Epstein's management duties changed to reflect the changing nature of their  career. He wanted them to continue touring, however, but they adamantly refused.<ref name="Spitzp666"> Spitz 2005. p666</ref> The Beatles started to pay less attention to Epstein's advice on many issues after they stopped touring, such as the legally risky cover art of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. Epstein later brought [[Robert Stigwood]] into the NEMS organisation, and wanted to sell the control of NEMS to him, but didn't tell any of the group about his decision.<ref name="Spitzp725-726"> Spitz 2005. p725-726</ref>

Before Epstein's death, McCartney had been taking a much more active interest in NEMS' finances, and the group was becoming aware that some artists with more ruthless managers—such as the [[Rolling Stones]] under [[Allen Klein]]—claimed to be receiving more commercially advantageous terms. After Epstein's death, Stigwood wanted to take over the management of NEMS—believing that he was the "natural successor"—but Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr all vehemently opposed him, with Lennon saying, "We don't know you. Why would we do this?"<ref name="Spitzp725-726"> Spitz 2005. p725-726</ref>

===Business dealings===
<!-- Put references into this article or your edit will be deleted -->
[[Image:Epstein and his Artists.jpg |thumb|right|350px|Epstein (standing) with some of his NEMS artists.]]
McCartney admitted that they signed all the contracts Epstein presented to them without reading them first, but when Lennon was asked for a comment about Epstein's business dealings after Epstein’s death, he said, "Well, he was alright. I've found out since, of course, that he wasn't quite as honest to us as he made out"—although many other interviews with Lennon report him as being very loyal to Epstein, and even saying, "We had complete faith in him when he was running us. To us, he was the expert".<ref name="Milesp146"> Miles 1997 p146</ref><ref name="McCabeSchonfeldFortheRecord"> McCabe/Schonfeld “For The Record” 1984. p90</ref><ref name="EpsteininBillHarryBook"/>

The Beatles all signed Epstein's first management contract, but Epstein did not sign it himself, thereby giving himself the option of withdrawing at any time. The contract could not have been legally binding on McCartney and Harrison, as they were both still [[Minor (law)|minors]] (the age of majority at that time was 21) and lacked the [[Legal capacity#Natural persons|legal capacity]] to sign a [[Contract|binding contract]]. The contract stated that Epstein would receive a management commission of 25 per cent of their [[gross income]] after a certain threshold had been reached.<ref name="MilesPage88"> Miles 1997 p88</ref><ref name="MilesPage144-145"> Miles 1997 pp144-145</ref> The Beatles argued for a smaller percentage, but Epstein pointed out that he had been paying their [[expenses]] for months, without receiving anything in return.<ref name=" CynthiaJohnp103"> Cynthia Lennon – “John” 2006. p103</ref> Epstein once offered the individual Beatles a fixed wage of £50-a-week for life, instead of receiving money from record sales. Harrison commented that he was earning £25 a week at the time, which was more than the £10 a week his father was earning, but the group as a whole declined Epstein's offer, as they thought that they were worth much more than £50-a-week.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/955196.stm  bbc.co.uk: Epstein 'wanted Beatles fortune'] news.bbc.co.uk.

The Beatles' recording contract that EMI offered Epstein gave them one [[penny]] for each record sold, which was split amongst the four members, meaning one [[British Farthing coin|farthing]] per group member.<ref name="History62">[http://www.beatles-discography.com/index.html?http://www.beatles-discography.com/1962.html  "Beatles History: 1962" at ''Beatles Discography''.] beatles-discography.com.

Retrieved: 11 March 2007 </ref> 

The Beatles' concerts were booked by Epstein himself, and he also presented groups managed by NEMS as an opening act, thereby making money for NEMS as the [[Entrepreneur|promoter]], [[Talent agent|booking agent]], and [[Manager]] for all the concerts.<ref name="Brownp102"> Brown, Peter 2002. p102</ref> The Beatles were constantly in demand by concert promoters, and Epstein took advantage of the situation to avoid paying some [[tax]]es by accepting "hidden" fees on the night of a performance, which he always kept in a brown paper bag.<ref name="Brownp110"> Brown, Peter. 2002. p110</ref> Epstein also successfully managed Gerry & the Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas (who had three hits with Lennon-McCartney songs) the [[The Fourmost|Fourmost]] (their first two singles were written by Lennon) the [[The Cyrkle|Cyrkle]] (Epstein's first American group) and Cilla Black (who was Epstein's only female artist) as well as other artists.

During the first Beatles' flight to America Epstein was offered numerous samples of products by merchandisers—who required a licence from Epstein to be allowed to sell them—including clocks, pens, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games, but Epstein rejected all of them. David Jacobs, the lawyer for NEMS, had already given away some exclusive merchandising rights to Nicky Byrne in [[England]], which later turned out to be a financial mistake as Epstein had asked for a percentage that was far below the norm at the time.<ref name="Spitzp465-466"> Spitz 2005. pp465-466</ref> The Beatles were ensconced in the Plaza hotel in [[New York]], and Epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from merchandisers, promoters, television commentators, and hustlers—all demanding to talk to him.<ref name="Spitzp458-464"> Spitz 2005. pp458-464</ref> Mindful of the number of records the group were selling in America, [[Capitol records]] sent a well-spoken [[Yorkshire]] girl, Wendy Hanson, to the Plaza hotel to act as Epstein's secretary, and to filter his calls.<ref name="Spitzp464"> Spitz 2005. p464</ref> Hanson later worked solely with Epstein in his Albemarle Street office, which was separate from the NEMS office.<ref name="Spitzp667"> Spitz 2005. p667</ref>

Epstein asked James Trevor Isherwood (a [[Chartered Accountant]]) to set up a company to collect Lennon and McCartney's [[PRS]] payments—called Lenmac—which he did on [[12 May]] [[1964]]. When he first visited Epstein's office, Isherwood was surprised to learn that Epstein took 25% of the [[gross income]], and not what he thought was the usual 10% that other managers received at that time.<ref name="Milesp144"> Miles 1997 p144</ref> All of Epstein's [[expenses]] were also deducted from any of his artists gross income, which meant office rental, staff wages, travel, telephone costs, and entertaining expenses.<ref name="Milesp145"> Miles 1997 p145</ref> Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his management contract (up for renewal on [[30 September]] [[1967]]) would reduce his management fee from 25 per cent to 10 per cent, but would mean a larger drop in NEMS income, as Beatles' concert fees had been taken out of the equation.<ref name="Milesp405"> Miles 1997 p405</ref>  

The Beatles entered into a publishing agreement with [[Dick James]] Music (DJM) who set up a company called [[Northern Songs]]. Epstein agreed that James should receive 25 per cent of the shares, and Charles Silver—his financial partner and [[accountant]]—should also receive 25 per cent. Lennon and McCartney received 20 per cent each, and Epstein held the remaining 10 per cent.<ref name="Milesp147"> Miles 1997 p147</ref> The Beatles PRS income increased rapidly, and Epstein asked Isherwood to work out a way of avoiding the tax that Lennon and McCartney would have to pay. Isherwood suggested a [[Initial public offering|Stock-market flotation]] for Northern Songs, and further advised Epstein that Lennon and McCartney should move to houses near his [Isherwood's] in [[Esher]] during the flotation, which Lennon, Harrison, and Starr did—with only Epstein and McCartney remaining in London.<ref name="Milesp166-167"> Miles 1997 pp166-167</ref> 

After moving to London Epstein rented an office in Monmouth Street—close to [[Seven Dials]]—in 1965, and later leased the [[Saville Theatre]] on [[Shaftesbury Avenue]]. He promoted new works by writers such as [[Arnold Wesker]] in productions that occasionally fell afoul of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] by including "obscene" content or nudity. Epstein changed the programme to that of a music venue in 1966, presenting various U.S. acts.<ref name="Spitzp648-649"> Spitz 2005. pp648-649</ref>

==Personal life==
<!-- Put references into this article or your edit will be deleted -->
Throughout Epstein's life he was known to be kind and caring to his family, friends of his family, and business colleagues. When Lennon married [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia Powell]], on [[23 August]] [[1962]], Epstein attended the wedding as the "[[best man]]" and paid for their celebration lunch afterwards.<ref name="Spitzp348"> Spitz 2005. p348</ref><ref name="Brownp83"> Brown, Peter. 2002. p83</ref> During Cynthia's pregnancy Epstein paid for a private room in a hospital and offered the Lennons the sole use of his flat on Faulkner Street when they needed somewhere to live. He also agreed to be the [[godparent|godfather]] to [[Julian Lennon]], John and Cynthia's son.<ref name="Brownp93"> Brown, Peter. 2002. p93</ref><ref name=" CynthiaJohnp171"> Cynthia Lennon – “John” 2006. p171</ref>

===Sexual orientation===
<!-- Put references into this article or your edit will be deleted -->
[[Image:Brian Epstein looking to the left.jpg |thumb|left|200px| A [[Dezo Hoffmann]] photo of Epstein.]]
Epstein was [[homosexual]], which was not publicly known until a long time after his death, although it was an open secret among his friends and business associates.<ref name="Milesp88"> Miles 1997 p88</ref> 

While Epstein was in the Army, he had a tailor make an officer's uniform for him that he wore when [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] the bars of London, but was arrested one night (for impersonating an officer) at the Army and Navy Club on [[Piccadilly]] by the [[Military Police]]. Epstein managed to avoid a [[court martial]] by agreeing to see an army psychiatrist, who uncovered Epstein's [[homosexuality]].<ref name="MilesPage86"> Miles 1997 p86.</ref> He was discharged from the army after ten months on the medical grounds of being "emotionally and mentally unfit".<ref name="Spitzp260"> Spitz 2005. p260</ref> 

Whilst Epstein was studying acting at RADA, he was arrested for "[[Cottaging|persistent importuning]]", and was later blackmailed by an ex-[[Coldstream Guards|Guardsman]]—Billy Connolly—which led to him dropping out after his third term. Throughout the later court case against Connolly, Epstein was referred to as "Mr. X", as the law allowed anonymity at that time.<ref name="Spitzp262"> Spitz 2005. p262</ref> McCartney said that he and the others knew that Epstein was a homosexual, but they did not care, because Epstein greatly encouraged them when record companies turned them down, and used to take them to late-night drinking clubs, to which they had previously never had access.<ref name="MilesPage88"> Miles 1997 p88</ref> Although Lennon often made sarcastic comments about Epstein's homosexuality to friends and to Epstein personally, nobody outside their closed circle was allowed to comment on it. Ian Sharp—one of Lennon's art school friends—once made a sarcastic remark about Epstein but was sent a letter by Epstein's office within forty-eight hours that demanded a complete apology. Sharp apologised but was then completely ostracised, and was told by McCartney in a letter to have no contact at all with any of them in the future.<ref name="Spitzp302-303"> Spitz 2005. pp302-303</ref>

There were rumours of a brief sexual encounter between Lennon and Epstein when they both went on a four-day holiday together to Barcelona, [[Spain]] in April [[1963]]. Lennon always denied this, telling ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1980: "It was never consummated, but we had a pretty intense relationship." Lennon's first wife Cynthia also maintains that Lennon's relationship with Epstein was platonic.<ref name=" CynthiaJohnp104"> Cynthia Lennon – “John” 2006. p104</ref> A fictionalised account of the Spanish holiday was portrayed in the film 1991 ''[[The Hours and Times]]''. Lennon's friend and confidant, [[Peter Shotton]], claimed in his book, ''The Beatles, Lennon and Me'', that under provocation from Epstein, Lennon did partly give in: "I let him [[Handjob|toss me off]], and that was it." Biographer [[Hunter Davies]] also recalled Lennon telling him he had consented to an encounter "to see what it was like." Writer [[Albert Goldman]] expanded on both claims in his ''[[The Lives of John Lennon]]'', alleging a longtime affair between the two men. Despite his soft-spoken manner and dapper appearance, Epstein was strongly attracted to "[[Trade (Homosexual)|rough trade]]", often seeking illicit encounters with abusive partners, and was subjected to blackmail, battery, and threats. 

Epstein's strongest relationship with a woman was with [[Alma Cogan]], who was also Jewish and was a part of the glitzy world of old-fashioned show business. Epstein always bought her presents when he was abroad, and even took her to Liverpool to meet his parents. Despite Epstein's preference for male company, some of his friends believed they would eventually get married.<ref name="Milesp138"> Miles 1997 p138</ref> Cogan died of [[ovarian cancer]] in 1966 at age 34.

In October [[1964]], Epstein's [[autobiography]], ''A Cellarful of Noise'', was published in the UK and later in the U.S. It was co-written by journalist [[Derek Taylor]], who had served as Epstein's assistant that year, then later as the publicist for NEMS from [[1968]]-[[1970]]. (Lennon reportedly once quipped that the memoir should have been titled ''A Cellarful of Boys'').<ref name="EpsteininBillHarryBook">[http://213.87.37.135/oea/millennium/other/Books/billharry/EE.htm#Eamonn%20Andrews%20Show,%20The  Lennon’s comments about Epstein] 213.87.37.135/oea/millennium.

Male homosexual relations were illegal throughout the [[UK]] until September 1967 (only one month after Epstein's death) when gay male sexuality was legalised in [[England]] and [[Wales]] (remaining illegal in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] until 1980 and 1982, respectively).

After the start of his management career, Epstein started taking [[amphetamines]]—usually [[Preludin]], which was legal at that time—which Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr also took and had previously taken in Hamburg. He explained his use of the drug as the only way of staying awake at night during numerous concert tours.<ref name="Spitzp301-302"> Spitz 2005. pp301-302</ref> In 1964, Brown started to notice that Epstein was taking too many pills, because Epstein often had a cough at parties, which Brown knew was Epstein's way of secretly putting pills into his mouth without anyone noticing.<ref name="Spitzp518"> Spitz 2005. p518</ref> McCartney often met Epstein at late-night clubs in London, and remembered that Epstein would often "grind his jaws", and once said, "Ugghhh, the pills..." to McCartney.<ref name="Milesp131"> Miles 1997 p131</ref>

In 1964, after having been introduced to [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] by [[Bob Dylan]] in [[New York]], McCartney remembered Epstein standing in front of a mirror, pointing at himself and repeatedly saying "Jew!", and laughing loudly, which McCartney found hilarious and "very liberating".<ref name="MilesPage188-189"> Miles 1997 pp188-189</ref> Epstein later became heavily involved in the 1960s drug scene, and during the four months when the ''[[Sgt. Pepper]]'' album was being recorded, Epstein spent his time on holiday, or at the [[Priory Group|Priory Clinic]], in [[Putney]], London, where he tried unsuccessfully to curb his drug use. He left the Priory for the party to launch ''Sgt. Pepper'' to selected journalists at his house at 24 Chapel Street, but went straight back to the Priory afterwards.<ref>[http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-0.15093&GridN=51.49997&lon=-0.15093&lat=51.49997&place=Chapel%20Street%2C%20CITY%20OF%20WESTMINISTER%2C%20SW1&db=GB&scale=5000&search_result=Chapel%20Street%2C%20CITY%20OF%20WESTMINISTER%2C%20SW1&lang=&db=GB&keepicon=true  Location of Epstein’s Chapel Street house] multimap.com.

===Gambling===

The Beatles and Epstein visited [[Elvis Presley]] in America, and while they were at [[Graceland]], [[Colonel Tom Parker]] and Joe Esposito set up a roulette wheel and several packs of [[playing cards]].<ref name="PSectionBillHarryJohnEncyclopedia">[http://213.87.37.135/oea/millennium/other/Books/billharry/PP.htm#Polythene%20Pam BillHarry “John Lennon Encyclopedia”] oea/millennium/other/Books - Retrieved 7 December 2007 </ref> Epstein immediately wanted to play, as he was known for his love of [[gambling]] for high-stakes.<ref name="LipackEpoch"> Lipack. p57.</ref> McCartney frequently visited [[gambling]] clubs in London, such as the 'Curzon House' (which was Epstein's favourite club) and often saw Brian Epstein gambling there. He once saw Epstein put a [[Alfred Dunhill, Ltd.|Dunhill lighter]] on the table that was worth £100 (worth approximately £1,300. [[GBP]], or $2,500. [[USD]] in today's money), and then lose it during a game of cards.<ref>These values were calculated using [http://futureboy.homeip.net/fsp/frink.fsp "Frink"]</ref> Epstein would often lose thousands of pounds by playing [[baccarat]] or [[Baccarat|chemin de fer]], but would stay at the Curzon House the whole evening—eating an expensive meal and drinking fine wines. The club never presented Epstein with a bill, as they knew that he lost so much in their [[casino]].<ref name="MilesPage131"> Miles 1997 p131</ref>

==Death==
<!-- Put references into this article or your edit will be deleted -->
[[Image:be3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Daily Mirror]] Headline: "EPSTEIN (The Beatle-making Prince of Pop) DIES AT 32".]]
A few weeks before his own death, Epstein had attended a traditional [[Shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] in Liverpool after his father passed away, having just come out of the Priory clinic where he had been trying to cure his acute [[insomnia]] and his addiction to amphetamines.<ref name="Milesp404-405"> Miles 1997 pp404-405</ref> Epstein's last visit to a Beatles' recording session was on [[23 August]] [[1967]], at the Chappell Recording Studios on Maddox street, London.<ref name="Milesp355"> Miles 1997 p355</ref> 

On Thursday [[24 August]], Epstein asked Brown and Geoffrey Ellis down to Kingsly Hall, which was his country home in [[Uckfield]], [[Sussex]], for the [[Bank Holiday]] weekend. After they got there, Epstein decided to drive back to London by himself because an expected group of [[rent boys]] he had invited failed to arrive.<ref name="Milesp405"> Miles 1997 p405</ref> Epstein phoned Brown the next day at 5 o'clock in the afternoon from his Chapel Street house in London. Brown thought that Epstein sounded "very groggy", and suggested that Epstein take a train back down to Kingsley Hall instead of driving under the influence of [[Tuinal]]s. Epstein replied that he would eat something, read his mail and watch ''[[Juke Box Jury]]'' before phoning Brown to tell him which train to meet. He never called again.<ref name="Milesp405"> Miles 1997 p405</ref>  

Epstein died of a [[drug overdose]] on [[27 August]] [[1967]]. The Beatles were in [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] at the time, having a meeting with the Indian [[guru]] [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], and Epstein had previously agreed to travel to Bangor after the August Bank Holiday.<ref name="OnThisDayEpstein">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/27/newsid_3767000/3767499.stm bbc.co.uk: On This Day – The death of Brian Epstein] news.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved: 9 March 2007 </ref><ref name="Milesp404"> Miles 1997 p404</ref> A concert by [[Jimi Hendrix]] was cancelled on the same day that Epstein died at the Saville Theatre (which Epstein leased) out of respect.<ref name="OnThisDayEpstein"/> At the statutory inquest, his death was officially ruled accidental, and was probably caused by a gradual buildup of [[Carbitral]] in his system, mixed with [[alcohol]]. It was revealed that he had taken six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably usual for Epstein, but meant that his tolerance was very close to becoming lethal.<ref name="Milesp405"> Miles 1997 p405</ref>    

Peter Brown claimed in his memoir, ''The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of The Beatles'', that he had once found a suicide note written by Epstein and spoke with him directly about it. According to Brown, the note read in part, "This is all too much and I can't take it anymore." A short will and testament followed, in which Epstein left his house and money to his mother and his brother (Brown himself was a small beneficiary). When confronted with the note, Epstein told Brown that he was grateful Brown had not told anyone about it, and told him that he was sorry he had made Brown worry. He explained that he had simply had taken one pill too many and that he did not intend to overdose and promised to be more careful from then on. Brown later wrote that he wondered if he was really doing Epstein a favour by not showing the note to Epstein's doctor, Norman Cowan, who more than likely would have stopped prescribing drugs for Epstein.<ref name="BrownTheLoveYouMakep31"> Brown “The Love You Make” (1995 reprint)</ref>

The Beatles did not attend Epstein's funeral, wishing to give his family privacy by not attracting the media and fans. A few weeks later, however, all four attended a memorial service for Epstein at the New London Synagogue in [[St. John's Wood]] (near the Abbey Road studios) which was officiated by Rabbi [[Louis Jacobs]], who eulogised Epstein, saying, “He encouraged young people to sing of love and peace rather than war and hatred.” Epstein is buried in the [[Kirkdale, Liverpool|Kirkdale]] Jewish Cemetery in Liverpool (section A grave H12).

[[Image:Beatles Telegram.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The telegram that Epstein sent to [[Mersey Beat]] magazine to announce that he had secured The Beatles their first recording contract.]]
The Beatles were among the earliest entrants into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], but the man regarded as having been responsible for guiding them to their success has never been considered for membership in the Hall's "Non-Performer's Section". Epstein was earlier overlooked when Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr were honoured with the [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 1965 (even though Harrison once said that the MBE stood for "Mister Brian Epstein"). [[Martin Lewis]]—previously Taylor's assistant—created "The Official Brian Epstein Website", which includes a [[petition]] that Epstein be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="EpsteindotCom">[http://www.brianepstein.com/  The petition for Epstein] brianepstein.com. Retrieved: 15 March 2007 </ref> Lewis also organized the 1998 re-publication (in the U.S.) of Epstein's 1964 autobiography, ''[[A Cellarful of Noise]]''.

After Epstein's death, clashes between members began to surface, culminating with the group's slow dissolution between 1969-1970. McCartney summarised the importance of Epstein when he was interviewed, in 1997, for a BBC documentary about Epstein by stating: "If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian."<ref name="Fifth Beatle">[http://www.brianepstein.com/cellarful.html McCartney's comments about the fifth Beatle] brianepstein.com.
