'''''Sangokushi Online''''' (三國志 Online) is Koei's third [[online]] ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' game for PC platform.

[[Koei]] announced the development of its latest [[MMORPG]] in mid-2006.  Koei planned on releasing ''Sangokushi Online'' in Japan in the first quarter of 2007 followed by the rest of Asia <ref>Koei [http://www.koei.co.jp/flash/financial/pdfs/20061121_2.pdf]</ref>.  However Koei started the first Pre-Open testing on September 27, 2007.<ref>Koei [http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/sol/obeta_info.htm]</ref>  A second Pre-Open testing was begun on February 7, 2008.<ref>Koei [http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/sol/info/080117.htm]</ref>  Additionally, these plans do not reference a possible North American or European release.  This follows Koei's tradition of Asia-only MMO releases, such as ''[[Nobunaga's Ambition Online]]'' and ''[[Uncharted Waters Online]]''.

==Story==
''Sangokushi Online'' is set in the warring and chaotic times of the end of the Eastern Han dynasty in ancient China.
Power struggles among ambitious men were everywhere but particularly there were three men who have successfully rallied 
sufficient abled talents, enough to build the empire of their own. The player will join this triangular conquest of power by taking one of the three sides, in hope for the unification of [[China]]!

==Gameplay==
The player will control a character [[avatar]] within a persistent game world and engage in activities such as exploring the landscape of ancient [[China]], fighting bandits and mythical creatures, running errands, quests or political assignment missions, learning combat and production skills, and interacting with both [[NPCs]] and fellow players. In return for engaging in such activities, the player will be rewarded for their effort with money and items. Unlike most [[MMORPGs]], player will be rewarded skill experience for using their skills which allows them to advance their skills further. Currently, players can level up the characters from Level 1 to 50<ref>http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/sol/developer/ryosyu/ryosyu2.htm</ref>. Players also choose to join [[clans]] (known as [[guilds]] in most [[MMORPGs]]). Like other [[MMORPGs]], short term groups such parties and raids can  be formed to explore the different territories and [[instances]]. As players take side in one of the 3 forces, the [[Wu]] Force, the [[Shu]] Force and the [[Wei]] Force (which is led by the powerful warlords, [[Sun Quan]], [[Liu Bei]] and [[Cao Cao]] respectively), they will be able to take part in large scale ([[PvP]] & [[PvE]]) wars, with as many as 500 players on each side. At the end of each war session, players will be rewarded with rankings according to their performance during the war.
