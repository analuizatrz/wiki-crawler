==Background==
===Creation===
''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' is co-created/produced by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in [[Burbank, California]]. It is animated in [[South Korea]]. The first episode of ''Avatar'' was created six years following its original conception, a period much longer than the norm for animated shows.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30912F93F550C718DDDAB0994DE404482 | title = SpongeBob SquareProfits: Nickelodeon Swears By Cartoons | accessdate = 2006-12-31 | date= 2006-12-12 | author = Edward Wyatt | publisher = NY Times}}</ref> While it was originally set to premiere in November 2004, the first episode of ''Avatar'' aired in February 2005. Following the conclusion of the first season of ''Avatar'', Nickelodeon promptly ordered a second twenty-episode season that premiered on [[March 17]], [[2006]], and concluded on [[December 1]].<ref name="secondseason"/> A third season will begin airing in 2007.<ref name="newsitem_no=17250"/>

===Premise===
[[Image:Avatar world map.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A map of the four nations]]<!--
 FAIR USE of Avatar_world_map.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Avatar_world_map.jpg for rationale -->
''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' takes place in a [[fantasy world]], home to humans, fantastic animals, and supernatural spirits. Human civilization is divided into four nations, the [[Water Tribe]]s, the [[Earth Kingdom]], the [[Air Nomads]], and the [[Fire Nation]]. Within each nation, an order of men and women called "Benders" have the ability to manipulate their native [[classical element|element]]. These Bending arts combine a certain style of martial arts and elemental [[mysticism]]. The Bending types are [[Waterbender|Waterbending]], [[Earthbender|Earthbending]], [[Firebender|Firebending]], and [[Airbender|Airbending]].<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml">{{cite web | url = http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/avatar2/ | title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | publisher = Nick.com}}</ref>

In each generation, one person is capable of Bending all four elements; this is the Avatar, the spirit of the planet manifested in human form. When the Avatar dies, he or she is [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] into an unborn baby native in the next of the four nations in the Avatar Cycle, which parallels the seasons: winter for water, spring for earth, summer for fire, and autumn for air.<ref name="Southern"/> While legend holds that the Avatar must master the elements in order, starting with their native element, this can sometimes be compromised when the situation requires it. Learning to bend the element opposite one's native element is extremely difficult because opposing Bending arts are based on opposing fighting styles and doctrines.<ref name="LearnEarthbending">{{cite episode | title = Bitter Work | episodelink = Bitter Work | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender| network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-06-02 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 9}}</ref>

The Avatar possesses a unique power that resides within him or her, called the [[Avatar State]]. It is a [[defence mechanism|defense mechanism]] that empowers the Avatar with the skills and knowledge of all the past Avatars. When the state is reached, the current Avatar will be able to wield the combined power of all past lives. When the Avatar enters this state, his or her eyes and mouth, and tattoos in the case of an Airbender, begin to glow. The glow is the representation of all the Avatar's previous incarnations focusing their energy through his or her body. However, if the Avatar is killed in the Avatar State, then the reincarnation cycle will be broken, and the Avatar will cease to exist.<ref name="AvatarState">{{cite episode | title = The Avatar State | episodelink = The Avatar State | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-03-17 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 21}}</ref>

Through the ages, countless incarnations of the Avatar have served to keep the four nations in harmony and maintain world order.<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/> The Avatar also serves as the bridge between the physical world and the [[Spirit World (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Spirit World]], home of the world's disembodied spirits.<ref name="SpiritWorld">{{cite episode | title = The Spirit World | episodelink = The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1) | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-04-08 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 7}}</ref>

===Plot synopsis===
{{main|List of Avatar: The Last Airbender episodes}}
A century prior to the series' opening, [[Aang]], a 12-year-old Airbender of the [[Air Nomads]]' [[Air Nomads#Southern Air Temple|Southern Air Temple]], learned from the elder monks that he was the Avatar. Usually, the Avatar is told of his or her true identity after turning sixteen; however, the monks feared that a war between the four nations was on the horizon and that soon the Avatar would be required to maintain balance and order in the world. Shortly thereafter, the monks decreed that Aang would be separated from his guardian, [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender minor recurring characters#Monk Gyatso|Monk Gyatso]], and sent to the [[Air Nomads#Eastern Air Temple|Eastern Air Temple]] to complete his training.

[[Image:Human Popsicle.png|thumb|200px|right|Two siblings make a discovery]]

Confused, frightened, and overwhelmed by these recent events and his new responsibilities as the Avatar, Aang fled from his home on his [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender creatures#Flying Bison|flying bison]], [[Appa]]. While traveling over frigid southern ocean waters, a sudden storm caused Appa to plunge deep into the sea. Aang unconsciously entered the Avatar State, and used a combination of Airbending and Waterbending to protect Appa and himself. By creating an air bubble around them and then freezing it, Aang was able to ensure that he and Appa could breathe and be protected from the storm until it dissipated. However, the storm transferred the bubble very near the south pole and it could not thaw, forcing the two of them into a state of [[suspended animation]].<ref name="Southern">{{cite episode | title = The Southern Air Temple | episodelink = The Southern Air Temple | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-25 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 3}}</ref>

The series opens one hundred years later, with the [[Fire Nation]] on the brink of victory in its imperialist war.  All of the Air Nomads have been destroyed.  The Water Tribes are in crisis — the Southern Water Tribe's warriors have left to wage war, leaving their home defenseless, while the Northern Water Tribe, though largely intact, is continually on the defensive.<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Boy in the Iceberg | episodelink = The Boy in the Iceberg | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-21 | season = 1 (Book 1)|number = 1}}</ref> The vast [[Earth Kingdom]] is now the only true barrier to the Fire Nation's conquest, but as the Fire Nation continues to encroach on its borders and conquer its territories, hopes of victory grow bleaker with each passing year.

Two teenage siblings from the Southern Water Tribe — [[Katara]], an inexperienced Waterbender, and her brother, [[Sokka]], a warrior and caretaker of the tribe — discover and free Aang and Appa from the iceberg. Aang soon discovers to his horror that, during his absence, a century-long war has been waged. The very year he vanished, [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender minor book 1 characters#Fire Lord Sozin|Fire Lord Sozin]] took advantage of both the Avatar's absence and the [[Firebender|Firebending]]-enhancing powers of a passing [[comet]] to launch a war on the other nations.<ref name="Roku">{{cite episode | title = Avatar Roku | episodelink = Avatar Roku (Winter Solstice, Part 2) | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-04-15 | season = 1 (Book 1)|number = 8}}</ref> To Aang's shock and disbelief, the Fire Nation's opening gambit had been a [[genocide|genocidal]] assault on the Air Nomads. The Air Temples were stormed and the Airbenders slaughtered in the Fire Nation's effort to break the Avatar Cycle, leaving Aang as the last known Airbender in existence.<ref name="Southern"/>

As the Avatar, Aang's duty is to restore harmony and peace to the four nations. Along with his newly discovered friends Katara and Sokka, his flying bison Appa and his [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender creatures#Winged Lemur|winged lemur]] [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Momo|Momo]], and later the blind Earthbender [[Toph]], Aang travels the world to master all four elements. During his quest, he must constantly evade capture by the banished [[Zuko|Prince Zuko]] and, later, his sister, [[Azula|Princess Azula]].

Although normally years of disciplined training are required to master a single Bending art, Aang must be a master of all four and defeat [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Fire Lord Ozai|Fire Lord Ozai]] by summer's end, when the return of Sozin's Comet will give the Firebenders the power to win the war. If these events come to pass, not even the Avatar will possess the ability to restore balance to the world.<ref name="Roku"/>

==Characters==
{{main|List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters}}

===Main characters===
One of the Avatar series' strong points is [[characterization|character development]] and depth. All the main characters are portrayed as "marvelously flawed human beings," and the series shone in its initial season with the characterizations of its main antagonists.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=13115 | title = Toon Zone Description and Review on Season 1 DVD | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | author = Ace The Bathound |date= 2006-10-28 | publisher = Toon Zone}}</ref>

He is the current incarnation of the Avatar, the spirit of the planet manifested in human form. As the Avatar, Aang must master all four elements to bring peace to the world and restore the balance between the Four Nations.<ref name="TheAvatarReturns">{{cite episode | title = The Avatar Returns | episodelink = The Avatar Returns | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-21 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 2}}</ref> Aang loves to travel the world and is always eager to learn new things. At times he is somewhat naïve of the world and others' true feelings, as he is often too preoccupied with the events immediately surrounding him to notice what occurs on a more in-depth level.
|-
|[[Image:Katara.png|100px|left]]'''[[Katara]]''' ([[Mae Whitman]]) is the 14-year-old sole remaining Waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe. Katara, along with her brother, Sokka, discovers Aang at the beginning of the series. She and Sokka accompany him on his quest to defeat the Fire Lord and bring peace to the war-torn nations. Katara is mature, loving, and responsible. Always looking out for the well-being of others, she is an apt leader when the situation calls for one.<ref name="TheDesert">{{cite episode | title = The Desert | episodelink = The Desert | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-07-14 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 11}}</ref> However, she can be overbearing at times, and believes without exception that her way is the right way, never relenting on her views even when they are disproved.<ref name="TheChase">{{cite episode | title = The Chase| episodelink = The Chase (Avatar: The Last Airbender) | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-06-02 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 9}}</ref> Despite Katara's kind nature, she has a temper which, when combined with her impressive Waterbending skills and idealistic views, can be quite destructive. After the passing of their mother at the hands of the Fire Nation, Katara took on a motherly role over her older brother, Sokka, a nature that she later took to in relation to Aang. She is also tthe only persone who can calm Aang down when he's in the avatar state.

|[[Image:Sokka.jpg|100px|right]]'''[[Sokka]]''' ([[Jack DeSena]]) is a 15-year-old warrior of the Southern Water Tribe who, with his sister Katara, accompanies Aang on his quest to defeat the Fire Lord. Sokka describes himself as "meat-loving" and "sarcastic."<ref name="LearnEarthbending"/> Unlike his companions, Sokka cannot Bend an element. However, the series frequently grants him opportunities to demonstrate his true gift: ingenuity. He takes great pride in his mental and [[physical strength]], though it is often overshadowed by others' ability to Bend. He is extremely clever, relying on science where the mystical and martial arts elude him, though his silly and immature manner often causes others to underestimate his intellect.
|-

Toph has largely lived alone all her life due to over protective parents, which makes her somewhat selfish, sarcastic, and, at times, bitter and arrogant. She also does not hesitate to speak her mind and be bluntly truthful. Though blind, Toph has been shown to be a very exceptional Earthbender. She "sees" with Earthbending, feeling vibrations in the ground that objects make when moving.<ref name="TheBlindBandit">{{cite episode | title = The Blind Bandit | episodelink = The Blind Bandit | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-05-05 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 6}}</ref>

Zuko is obsessed with capturing the Avatar in his quest to restore his honor and redeem himself in the eyes of his father, [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Fire Lord Ozai|Fire Lord Ozai]]. His character matures throughout the show, influenced by his time as an exile, and he becomes less of a spoiled prince and more of an emotional outcast, at times struggling with his feelings of pity and bonding with the same people his nation has terrorized. He often acts coldly, but has revealed himself to be a very caring character as well - a trait which most often is exhibited in the presence of his [[Iroh|Uncle Iroh]]. Zuko's appearance is well-known due to the scar over his left eye, which he received during an [[Firebender#Agni Kai|Agni Kai]] with his own father. His regret, hate, and shame includes the loss of his mother.<ref name="TheStorm">{{cite episode | title = The Storm | episodelink = The Storm (Avatar: The Last Airbender) | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-06-03 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 12}}</ref>

Her mind is set on war and power; she manipulates and even tortures others to advance her own desires, ignoring family and emotional bonds whenever necessary. As a Firebending prodigy with a sadistic personality, Azula is a dangerous bender. She is one of only two benders shown who can bend and produce lightning. She sees others as expendable, and intimidates her lackeys and all those under her command.<ref name="AvatarState"/>

On the surface, Iroh is a cheerful and kind old man whose hobbies include drinking tea, playing [[Pai Sho]], and singing. While studying the Water Tribes, Iroh found a method of re-routing electrical currents, either natural or artificial, and aside from Azula he is the only Firebender that is shown to be able to create lightning. Much older and more experienced than any of the other [[protagonist|main characters]], Iroh chooses to take a less active role in the affairs of the series, acting as more of a mentor and guide to Zuko and most everyone he meets, including Aang and company.

==Influences==
===Cultural references===
''Avatar'' is notable for borrowing extensively from [[Art of East Asia|Asian art]] and mythology to create a fully realized [[fictional universe]]. Apart from its [[anime]]-inspired character designs, ''Avatar'' also draws on a mix of [[China|Chinese]], [[Japan]]ese, [[Mongolia]]n, [[Korea]]n, [[India]]n, and [[Tibet]]an [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[language]], [[clothing]], [[martial arts]], and [[culture]]. In addition, the show's [[Water Tribe]] is heavily influenced by [[Inuit]] culture. Explicitly stated influences include [[Chinese art]] and [[History of China|history]], [[Japanese anime]], [[Hinduism]], [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nicksplat.com/Whatsup/200510/12000135.html | title = Interview With The Creators | accessdate = 2006-12-02| date= 2005-10-12 | publisher = NickSplat.com}}</ref> and [[Yoga]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/arts/television/28lass.html?ei=5090&en=2d9845c5b0133bb9&ex=1282881600&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all | title = Article On Avatar: The Last Airbender | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | author = Mark Lasswell | date= 2005-08-25 | publisher = NY Times}}</ref> The production staff employs a cultural consultant, Edwin Zane, to review scripts.

====Avatar====
The term "[[Avatar]]" comes from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Avatāra'', which means "descent." In [[Hinduism|Hindu]] mythology, gods often manifest themselves into Avatars to restore balance on earth after a period of great evil. The [[Chinese character]]s appearing above the word "Avatar" in the show's opening mean "the divine medium who has descended upon the mortal world."<ref name="calligraphy.html">{{cite web | url = http://www.musogato.com/avatar/calligraphy.html | title = Calligraphy Writing In Avatar | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | author = KTChong | publisher = Distant Horizon}}</ref>

When [[Aang]] was a child, he unknowingly revealed that he was the Avatar when he chose four toys out of thousands. These four toys were the same ones that past Avatars had chosen for generations when they were children, revealing that Aang was the [[reincarnation]] of the Avatar. There is a similar test a child must pass in order to be recognized as the reincarnation of a [[Tulku]] [[Lama]] in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. According to the book ''Magic and Mystery in Tibet'' by [[Alexandra David-Neel]], "a number of objects such as [[rosary|rosaries]], ritualistic implements, books, tea-cups, etc., are placed together, and the child must pick out those which belonged to the late ''tulku'', thus showing that he recognizes the things which were ''his'' in his previous life."<ref>David-Neel, Alexandra. ''Magic and Mystery in Tibet''. New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1971 (ISBN 0-486-22682-4)</ref> Avatar's official site states "the successor is expected to show signs of continuity with the previous Avatar, such as being born within a week of the death."<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/>

====Elements====
<!-- Do NOT mention any specific classical ideology as the influential source unless you have verifiable proof. No "missing fifth element."-->
''Avatar'' draws on four [[classical element]]s for its bending arts: Water, Earth, Fire, and Air. Although each has its own variation, almost all [[ancient philosophy|ancient philosophies]] incorporate these four elements in some way. They are commonly used as the basis of [[Classical elements in popular culture|elemental magic in modern fiction]]. In the show’s opening, each element is accompanied by a representative Chinese [[seal script]] character of the element, along with a corresponding attribute:
* [[Water (classical element)|Water]] is associated with "[[Image:Shan.svg|20px]]" ({{zh-cp|c=善|p=shàn}}), which means "benevolent" or "adaptive."
* [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]] is associated with "[[Image:Qiang.svg|20px]]" ({{zh-tsp|t=強|s=强|p=qiáng}}), which means "strong."

<!-- Please do not re-add information about Plantbending and Metalbending, in both cases it was specifically mentioned that the bender was not bending either the plant or the metal, but simply the water and the earth within them. -->

===Asian culture===
====Calligraphy====
[[Image:ATLA Calligraphy.png|thumb|An example of Chinese calligraphy]]
[[Chinese character]]s done in traditional [[East Asian calligraphy]] styles are used for nearly all the writing that appears in ''Avatar''. For each instance of calligraphy, an appropriate style is used, ranging from the [[seal script]] (more archaic) to the [[clerical script]].<ref name="calligraphy.html"/> The show employs calligrapher Siu-Leung Lee as a consultant and translator.

====Fighting styles====
The fighting choreography of ''Avatar'' draws from martial arts, and the fighting styles and weaponry are based on [[Chinese martial arts]], with each bending art corresponding to a certain real-world style or styles. The creators use [[Tai Chi Chuan|Tai Chi]] for [[Waterbender|waterbending]], [[Hung Gar]] for [[Earthbender|earthbending]] (although [[Toph]] employs Chu Gar [[Southern Praying Mantis (martial art)|Southern Praying Mantis]] style),<ref name="con">[http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/con_reports.php?id=3 San Diego Comicon 2006 panel question and answer part 2] - Avatarspirit.net</ref> [[Northern Shaolin]] for [[Firebender|firebending]], and [[Baguazhang|Ba Gua]] for [[Airbender|airbending]].<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/> The show employs [[Sifu]] Kisu of the Harmonious Fist Chinese Athletic Association as a martial arts consultant.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.harmoniousfist.com/ | title = The National Shaolin Information Resource | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | publisher = The Harmonious Fist Chinese Athletic Association}}</ref>

Each fighting style was chosen to represent the element it projected:
* Tai Chi creates flowing, fluid movements to represent water.
* Hung Gar was chosen for its firmly rooted stances to represent solid earth.
* Northern Shaolin uses fast and swift strikes to mimic the power of fire.
* Ba Gua's soft, circular movements were chosen to represent air's tranquility.
* Chu Gar Praying Mantis' distinguishing movements and unique steppings complement Toph's blindness to give her an anomalous style of Earthbending.<ref name="con"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/interviews.php?id=8 | title = Interview with Sifu Kisu part 1 | accessdate = 2007-01-20 | author = Acastus | publisher = Avatarspirit.net | date = 2006-10-05}}</ref>

The flow of [[Qi|chi]] is the engine behind the bending arts. Benders require chi to flow from the breath as form of energy derived from breathing and oxygenation, and then extend it past their body to manipulate or manifest their element. 

The ability to bend stems from a compound of genetics and spirituality. As stated by the creators, all Air Nomads are benders as a result of their increased spirituality compared to other nations. Civilization reduces spirituality and thus every nation has a different percentage of benders.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avatarspirit.com/con_reports.php?id=2 | title = Pacific Media Expo | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | author = Gowa-Chan | publisher = AvatarSpirit.com}}</ref> <!-- Do NOT add anything about genetics unless you have a verifiable source. While many support a genetic involvement, there is nothing official on it as of yet. Until then, feel free to discuss this on the "Discussion" page. -->

===Asian film===
Asian cinema had a profound effect on the utilization of the choreographed martial art bending moves. ''Avatar'' creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino stated the particular influence in a magazine interview:
<blockquote>"Asian cinema is really good at action comedy. ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'' is one of our favorite movies. It has tons of fantastic action and lots of funny moments. Some of the effects provided inspiration for how bending moves might look on the show."<ref>"In Their Elements." (September 2006) ''Nick Mag Presents'', p. 6</ref></blockquote>

===Anime===
While ''Avatar'' is not considered an [[anime]] because of its American origin, one review has commented that "''Avatar'' blurs the line between anime and (US) domestic cartoons until it becomes irrelevant."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/anime/sfw12366.html|title=SciFi Channel Anime Review|accessdate=2006-10-16|work=SciFi}}</ref> In addition, Avatar has many features of anime such as having a different color palette than other animated shows.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&newsitem_no=13156 | title = Avatar: The Last Airbender Article | accessdate = 2006-12-16 |date= 2005-02-18 | publisher = Animation World Magazine}}</ref>

However, ''Avatar'' creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino confirmed a particular anime influence in a magazine interview:
<blockquote>"The best anime balances great action sequences with humor and emotion, something we try to do on ''Avatar''. We love all the films of [[Hayao Miyazaki]], especially ''[[Spirited Away]]'' and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]''. Both movies deal with spirituality and the environment in an entertaining way. Also, there's a lot of great animation."<ref>"In Their Elements." (September 2006) ''Nick Mag Presents'', p. 6</ref></blockquote> According to an interview with the artists involved in creating ''Avatar'', Appa's design was based on the [[Catbus]] in ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', due to the peculiar task of creating a mammal with six legs.<ref>{{Cite video | people = Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino | year = 2006 | title = Book 1: Water, Box Set | medium = DVD | date = 2006-09-19}}</ref>

''Avatar'' also draws inspiration from the anime works of [[Shinichiro Watanabe]]'s ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' and ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'', as well as ''[[FLCL]]'' (''Fooly Cooly'') of [[Gainax]]. Other various studios from which inspiration was drawn include [[Studio 4°C]], [[Production I.G.]], and [[Studio Ghibli]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musogato.com/avatar/magazine/anime_insider-dec06.jpg|title=www.musogato.com/avatar/magazine/anime_insider-dec06.jpg<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref> Bryan has commented that some of his most cherished Watanabe fight scenes were the fight between ''Bebop's'' [[Spike Spiegel]] and a drug smuggler in "[[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes|Asteroid Blues]]," as well as the duel between [[List of Samurai Champloo characters#Mugen|Mugen]] and a blind female [[Jojutsu]]-user in the ''Champloo'' episode "[[List of Samurai Champloo episodes 13-26|Elegy of Entrapment (Verse 2)]]." ''Avatar'' director Giancarlo Volpe also claims the staff "were all ordered to buy ''Fooly Cooly'' and watch every single episode of it."<ref>{{Cite video | url = http://flaming-june.org/videos/Audience%20Question%20&%20Answer%20Pt.%201.wmv | title = Audience Q&A Part 1 | publisher = Flaming June | format = WMV File | medium = Online Video | people = Volpe, Giancarlo (Director); Ehasz, Aaron (Head Writer); Desena, Jack (Voice of Sokka); Basco, Dante (Voice of Zuko) | accessdate = 2006-12-31}}</ref>

===Broadcast history===
The show was first revealed to the public in a teaser reel at [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/video.jhtml?show_id=ava&clip=16 | title = Avatar: The Last Airbender Sneak Peak|accessdate = 2006-12-10|puisher = Nickelodeon}}</ref> It was scheduled to air on Nickelodeon on [[November 29]] of that year, but was delayed until [[February 21]] of 2005. The first two episodes of the series were shown together in a one-hour premiere event in the United States.

===Promotion and merchandising===
''Avatar'''s success has led to promotions with [[Burger King]] and [[Upper Deck Company|Upper Deck Entertainment]], an Avatar-themed [[roller coaster]] that debuted on April 14, 2006, at [[Kings Island]] amusement park and a second to open in 2008 at [[The Park at MOA]], and a special issue of ''[[Nickelodeon Magazine|Nick Mag Presents]]'' dedicated entirely to the show. Various members of the ''Avatar'' staff and cast appeared at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International convention, while co-creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko appeared as guests of honor with Martial Arts Consultant Sifu Kisu at the Pacific Media Expo on [[October 28]] [[2006]]. ''Avatar'' also has its own line of t-shirts, [[LEGO]] playsets, toys, a [[Avatar: The Last Airbender Trading Card Game|trading card game]], a [[cine-manga]], and a video game.

===Feature film adaptation===
On [[January 8]], 2007, [[Paramount Pictures]]' [[MTV Films]] and [[Nick Movies]] announced that they have signed [[M. Night Shyamalan]] to write, direct and produce a trilogy of live-action films based on the series, the first of which will encompass the main characters' adventures of Book one. The film is now in a dispute with [[James Cameron]]'s film ''[[Avatar (film)|Avatar]]'' regarding title ownership.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117956950.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2564 | title = Shyamalan's 'Avatar' also to bigscreen | accessdate = 2007-01-09 | author = Pamela McClintock | date= [[2007-01-08]] | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>

Avatar co-creators [[Michael Dante DiMartino|Mike DiMartino]] and [[Bryan Konietzko]] have come forward to voice their opinion within an interview regarding M. Night Shymalan writing, directing and producing the film. The two displayed much enthusiasm over Shyamalan's decision for the adaption, stating that they admire his work and he in turn respects their material. This newfound information dispels fears that the co-creators were going to be left completely out of the creative process as Paramount did not specify their level of contribution when initial announcements of the deal with Shyamalan came forward.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=40610 | title = Avatar Creators Praise Night | accessdate = 2007-03-17 | author = Mike Szymanski| date = 2007-03-17 | publisher = SCI-FI Wire}}</ref>
