'''''By the Way''''' is the eighth studio album by [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], released on [[July 9]], [[2002]] on  [[Warner Music Group|Warner Bros. Records]]. It sold over 282,000 copies in the first week, and peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard 200]].<ref name=MTVBTW>{{Cite web|author = Harris, Chris | date = [[May 17]] [[2006]] | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1531925/20060517/red_hot_chili_peppers.jhtml|title=''MTV'' Red Hot Chili Peppers news|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=MTV}}</ref><ref name="billboard">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers album chart history|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=''Billboard''}}</ref> The singles from the album included "[[By the Way (song)|By the Way]]", "[[The Zephyr Song]]", "[[Can't Stop (song)|Can't Stop]]", "[[Dosed]]" and "[[Universally Speaking]]". The lyrical subject matter vocalist [[Anthony Kiedis]] addresses in ''By the Way'' is a divergence from previous Chili Peppers albums, with Kiedis taking a more candid and reflective approach to his lyricism.

''By the Way'' was applauded by critics as a departure from the band's previous styles, and is recognized for the melodic and subdued emotions given by the Chili Peppers.<ref name=AMGBTW>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gjfrxqr0ldje~T1|title=''By the Way'' Review - Zac Johnson|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref><ref name=RollingstoneBTW>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/129713/by_the_way|title=''By the Way'' Review - Tom Moon|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref> Guitarist [[John Frusciante]] is credited with writing most of the album's melodies, bass lines, and guitar progressions, therefore changing the direction of the recording dramatically: "his warm, understated guitar work and his doo-wop style vocal harmonies are king this time around."<ref name=popmatters>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/r/redhotchilipeppers-bytheway.shtml|title=''By the Way'' Album Review|author=Kimberly Mack|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=Pop Matters}}</ref> ''By the Way'' contained virtually none of the signature punk-funk [[Music genre#Fusional origins|fusion]] the band had become known for playing.<ref name=bbc.co>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/jvzf/|title=By the Way Album Review - Daniel Pike|accessdate=2007-06-03|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Frusciante considered that writing "''By the Way'' [was] one of the happiest times in my life."<ref name=TGMJF>{{Cite web|url=http://rhcprock.free.fr/totalguitar_john.htm|title=Interview with John Frusciante|accessdate=2007-06-02|date = August 2002 | author = Dalley, Helen | publisher=''Total Guitar Magazine''}}</ref>

==Background==
Following a life threatening drug addiction that caused him to leave the Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante made a full recovery after a month of [[drug rehabilitation]] in the early months of 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=JOHN|FRUSCIANTE&sql=11:7veyxdkbjoly~T1|title=Biography of John Frusciante|accessdate=2007-07-25|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref><ref name=p389>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 389–400</ref> Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the Red Hot Chili Peppers.<ref name=p389/> After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' was released. The album went on to sell over fifteen million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date.<ref name="bbc">{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3864401.stm|title=Chili Peppers' album tops survey|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, ''[[One Hot Minute]]''.<ref name="rsreview">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/277669/californication|title=''Californication'' review|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=''Rolling Stone'' magazine|author=Greg Tate}}</ref><ref name=AMGCalif>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:a9fuxqykld0e|author=Greg Prato|title=''Californication'' Review|accessdate=2007-06-24|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref><ref name=pitchfrkreview>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/21277-californication|author=Brent DiCrescenzo|title=Californication Review|accessdate=2007-06-24|publisher=Pitchfork Media}}</ref> A two year long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances,  including [[Woodstock 1999]] and [[Rock in Rio]].

The writing and formation of ''By the Way'' began immediately following the culmination of ''Californication's'' world tour, in the Spring of 2001. As with ''Californication'', much of the creation took place in the band members' homes, and other locations of practice, such as a recording studio stage.<ref name=ScrTissPg456> Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 456 </ref> Kiedis recalled of the situation: "We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it."<ref name=ScrTissPg456/> Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate together for days straight, discussing and sharing guitar progressions and lyrics.<ref> Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 458</ref> For Kiedis, "writing ''By the Way''...was a whole different experience from ''Californication''. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence."<ref name=ScrTissPg456/> Prior to recording ''By the Way'', the Chili Peppers decided that they would again have [[Rick Rubin]] produce the album.<ref name=pg420>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 420</ref> Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 230–232, 320–321, 344, 424</ref>

==Writing and composition==
The album's guitar and bass ensemble was primarily dictated by Frusciante, rather than a collaborative effort between him and bassist Flea.<ref>Anthony Kiedis and John Frusciante - By the Way promotional Interview; Amsterdam</ref> Therefore the record took different direction than any previous Chili Peppers' album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant soundscape throughout the recording.<ref name=TGMJF/> Drawing influences from musicians such as [[Vini Reilly]] of [[The Durutti Column]] and [[John McGeoch]], Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on ''By the Way'', utilizing tools such as the [[mellotron]] and various [[effects pedal]]s throughout.<ref name=TGMJF/>
{{Sound sample box align right|''By the Way'' samples:}}

Frusciante sings backing vocals throughout the chorus and bridge.|format=[[Ogg]]}}{{sample box end}}
Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love.<ref> Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 456–465</ref> Songs such as "Body of Water", "Someone" (both B-sides), "By the Way", "I Could Die for You" and "Warm Tape" all digressed into the many sides of love.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 454–456, 458, 463–469</ref> Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he had only been sober since December 2000.<ref> Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 433</ref> Tracks like "This Is the Place", "Don't Forget Me", and "Dosed" expressed his intense dislike for narcotics and the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him. He referenced late Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in "This Is the Place", and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: "On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean". "Venice Queen" was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died  shortly after he purchased her a home on [[California]]'s [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice Beach]].<ref name=ScrTissPg456/> It mourned her death as a painful loss: "We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen."

''By the Way'' diverged from the band's previous styles, thus containing few funk-driven songs. "Can't Stop" was noted as the only song which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/r/redhotchilipeppers-bytheway.shtml|title=''By the Way'' Review|author=Mack, Kimberly|date=[[October 23]], [[2002]]|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Pop Matters}}</ref><ref name=shazambtw>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shazam.com/music/portal/sp/s/media-type/html/user/anon/page/album/productid/10006758/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/By+The+Way.html|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers - By the Way|accessdate=2007-06-03|publisher=Shazam}}</ref> "Throw Away Your Television", while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus. Other "experimental" tracks include the trumpet based "On Mercury", a centered largely on [[ska]]. "Cabron", the only track to be played entirely on acoustic guitar, has visible Latin influences. "Tear" had a minor piano part, and "Warm Tape" was composed almost entirely on a [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]]. 

Technically, ''By the Way'' saw the Chili Peppers employing several devices to distort and alter guitar and vocal sequences. "Don't Forget Me" utilizes a mellotron, [[Wah-wah pedal|wah pedal]], and echoing techniques to convey an emotive atmosphere, while Frusciante uses a [[Big Muff]] for the solos on "Minor Thing".<ref name=TGMJF/> Frusciante's backing vocals, although present in ''Californication'', became dominant in ''By the Way'', as almost every track contained his background presence.

==Release==
Feeling extremely confident in their album, the Chili Peppers issued the statement, "Greetings from the dimensions of invisible shapes and colors. The music on this record has expanded our space and made us bigger. Thank you for listening and being exactly where and who you are," in a press release.<ref name=apter343>Apter, 2004. p. 343</ref> Chad Smith commented that ''By the Way'' is "very honest, raw, emotional music. It's a very dynamic, rich and lush album. Probably the best collection of Chili Peppers songs we've ever put out."<ref name=apter346>Apter, 2004. p. 346</ref> [[Warner Bros. Records]] promoted the album heavily in the months prior to the record's 2002 release, especially targeting the online market in order to steer customers away from illegal downloads.<ref name=apter343/> The record label implemented a campaign they colloquially title "A Song A Day". This program, initiated on June 21, was aimed at leaking one song per day until the album was released.<ref name=apter346/> Over 150 radio stations participated in broadcasting the band's new daily material, along with [[MTV]], [[VH1]], and digital music retailers like [[iTunes]], as well as [[Cell phone]] companies.<ref name=apter346/> [[AOL]] featured the Chili Peppers as their "Artist Of The Month" in June, streaming interviews and live performances of the band free of charge; they also sold an [[MP3]] of "By the Way", the record's first single, for ninety-nine cents and raffled off tickets that gave fans a chance to see the band in [[Japan]] in November.<ref name=apter346/>  

''By the Way'' was released on [[compact disc|CD]] and [[LP album|LP]] on [[July 9]], [[2002]] under the Warner Bros. label, selling 281, 948 copies in the United States in it's first week and 1.8 million worldwide.<ref name=apter347>Apter, 2004. p. 347</ref> It was certified gold just a few months later on [[October 26]], [[2002]].<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|title=Gold and Platinum: Diamond Awards|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)|date=undated|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblDiamond}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gold and Platinum: Searchable Database|publisher=RIAA|date=undated|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> Five singles were released from it; of these, the title track "By the Way" was the most successful, peaking at #2 on the UK charts and #1 on the Billboard rock charts. Although the album sold fewer copies than ''Californication'', ''By the Way'' managed to peak at #2 on the [[Billboard Top 200]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/discography/index.jsp?pid=5507&aid=538664|title=Artist Chart History - Red Hot Chili Peppers|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=''Billboard''}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:judayl4jxpvb~T5|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Charting|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> one spot higher than ''Californication''.

The original album tracks were not remastered, although the bonus tracks were.

==Critical reception==
The album received a mostly positive reaction from critics, who praised ''By the Way'' for its melodic, multilayer and textured styles. [[All Music Guide]]'s Zac Johnson said that the album was "sophisticated...the Peppers have not sacrificed any of their trademark energy or passions for life, universal love, and (of course) lust".<ref name=AMGBTW/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the album "insanely melodic" and a "near-perfect balance of gutter grime and high-art aspiration", comparing it to other works, such as [[The Beach Boys]]' album ''[[Pet Sounds]]''.<ref name=RollingstoneBTW/> ''[[Mojo]]'' applauded the recording, and considered it to be "the strongest Chili's album since 1991's ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''".<ref name=Meta>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/redhotchilipeppers/bytheway|title=By the Way metacritc compilation|accessdate=2007-06-20|publisher=Metacritic.com}}</ref><ref>''Mojo Magazine''; 8/02 - Page 118.</ref> Giving the album 5 stars out of 5, ''Q'' called ''By the Way'' "A fantastic record; full of wonder."<ref> ''Q Magazine'' August 2002, p.118"</ref> Kimberly Mack of ''[[Pop Matters]]'' commented on how the album "...showcases a more sophisticated, lush sound that only today's Peppers could have conceived", and that "Anthony Kiedis' lyrics are more personal than ever."<ref name=popmatters/> Frusciante was, in her eyes, "a musical talent to be reckoned with and is the undeniable X factor in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound."<ref name=popmatters/>

However, the praise was balanced by those such as indie music critic Piero Scaruffi, who dismissed the album as being "too mainstream".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scaruffi.com/vol5/rhcp.html#byt|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers albums review|publisher=Piero Scaruffi|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' considered ''By the Way'' to be an indistinguishable sequel to ''Californication'', calling it "Californication 2". It further condemned the Chili Peppers for not varying their style and remaining extremely similar in sound.<ref name=Meta/><ref>''Blender Magazine'' - No. 9, page 142.</ref> Newspapers such as ''[[The Village Voice]]'' criticized the band for trying too hard to change.<ref name=vilvoice>{{Cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0234,lowe,37599,22.html|title=Mild Salsa | author = Lowe, Jaime | date = [[August 21]] – [[August 27]], [[2002]]|publisher=''Village Voice''|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref> ''Entertainment Weekly'' praised ''By the Way'' for being well refined and a superb collaboration, but criticized the Chili Peppers for playing it safe and keeping the album's energy mild; for being "more fascinating for what it symbolizes than what it is."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,269377~4~0~byway,00.html|title=''By the Way'' review||author = Browne, David | date = 2002 | accessdate=2007-07-19|publisher=''Entertainment Weekly''}}</ref>

All Music Guide considered the song "By the Way" to combine "fiery Hollywood funk, gentle harmonies, a little bit of singing about girls, [and] a little bit of hanging out in the streets in the summertime."<ref name=AMGBTW/> ''Rolling Stone'' commented on "how close this band has come to conjuring pure California sunshine" in "The Zephyr Song".<ref name=RollingstoneBTW/> "Midnight" was highly regarded by several sources. It was chosen as one of ''By the Way'''s "All Music Guide Track Picks".<ref name=AMGBTW/> Kimberly Mack of Pop Matters considered it to have "hippie-friendly lyrics" and to "evoke images of tie-dyed T-shirts and AM radio."<ref name=popmatters/> Mack also regarded "Venice Queen" as "a masterpiece...Frusciante's backing vocals are hauntingly beautiful."<ref name=popmatters/>

==''By the Way'' tour==
