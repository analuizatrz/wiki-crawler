'''''The Chaser's War on Everything''''' is an [[Australian Film Institute|AFI]] winning Australian [[television]] comedy series broadcast on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) television station [[ABC1]]. The series is produced by the Australian satirical group, [[The Chaser]], consisting of [[Chris Taylor (comedian)|Chris Taylor]], [[Julian Morrow]], [[Craig Reucassel]], [[Andrew Hansen]], and [[Chas Licciardello]]. Fellow Chaser members [[Dominic Knight]] and [[Charles_Firth_(comedian)|Charles Firth]] are not part of the regular on-screen cast. However, Knight is a writer, and Firth compiled roving reports for the show from the United States, until he left the group to start a satirical newspaper in mid-2007.

The show premiered on [[17 February]] [[2006]] and has since produced 50 [[List of The Chaser's War on Everything episodes|episodes]], broadcast over two seasons between 2006 and 2007. The 2006 season was broadcast at an unstable late timeslot on Friday nights. The 2007 season was broadcast in a more favourable timeslot of Wednesdays at {{nowrap|9 pm}} for all 24 episodes. The show will not return in the first half of 2008, and The Chaser are yet to announce if a third season will be made.

The program has often attracted controversy for The Chaser because of the stunts displayed on the show. On [[14 July]] [[2006]], Licciardello was charged after a stunt concerning [[rugby league]] team the [[Bulldogs (NRL team)|Bulldogs]].  Licciardello was again arrested, alongside Morrow and nine crew members, on [[6 September]] [[2007]] after [[The Chaser APEC pranks|breaching security]] at the [[APEC Australia 2007|2007 APEC summit]].

==Origins==
[[Image:TheChaser-FullTeam.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The entire team of The Chaser (from left, Morrow,  Knight, Firth, Reucassel, Licciardello, Taylor, and Hansen) on ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' on [[14 July]] [[2006]]]]
[[The Chaser]] was formed by [[Dominic Knight]], [[Charles Firth (comedian)|Charles Firth]], [[Craig Reucassel]], and [[Julian Morrow]], and in 1999 ran a fortnightly newspaper entitled ''[[The Chaser (newspaper)|The Chaser]]''. The group later added [[Chas Licciardello]], [[Andrew Hansen]], and [[Chris Taylor]], to assist with its publication. Through the help of [[Andrew Denton]], the Chaser team produced various shows for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]: most notably ''[[CNNNN]]''. In 2005, The Chaser began filming a pilot for a new television series for the ABC, with the working title ''The Age of Terror Variety Hour''.<ref name="gibberish">{{cite news|first=Annie|last=Lawson|title=Dinner, Piers pressure and lots of red whine|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/creative--media/dinner-piers-pressure-and-lots-of-red-whine/2005/07/24/1122143723586.html |work=[[The Age]]|date=[[2005-07-25]]|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> The Chaser team signed a contract with the ABC to produce 27 half hour episodes for 2006, which would be based on news reviews, studio monologues and confrontations with politicians, celebrities, and business leaders.<ref name="rejectnames">{{cite news|first=Sacha|last=Molitorisz|title=Behind enemy lines|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/behind-enemy-lines/2006/02/11/1139542439715.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=[[2006-02-14]]|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> The show was to be presented by Morrow, Hansen, Reucassel, Taylor and Licciardello.<ref name="gibberish"/>

New segments had been developed and the opening sequence was reworked. The move to prime time resulted in a ratings increase, reaching almost 1.5 million viewers each week. This was despite direct competition against well rated programs on commercial networks.<ref name="ratings1">{{cite news|title=ABC's Specks and Chasers rating well|url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=24&ContentID=30210 |work=[[The West Australian]]|date=[[2007-05-31]]|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref><ref name="ratings2">{{cite news|authors=eNews staff and agencies|title=Commercial TV chases lost ratings|url=http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/enews/commercial-tv-chases-lost-ratings-230507.html|publisher=eNews|date=[[2007-05-23]]|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> The Chaser finished their 24th and final episode of the show for the 2007 season on [[November 14]] [[2007]].

After the controversial [[The Chaser APEC pranks#Breach of APEC restricted zone|APEC motorcade stunt]], the show's profile was greatly increased and international broadcasts expanded. Countries which broadcast the show include [[Finland]], [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Belgium]] and [[South Korea]]. Twenty other countries are already in negotiations with [[ABC1]] to air the series including [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]], [[Thailand]] and the [[United States]]. Re-edited versions of the show may be broadcast without reference to Australian politics which might be considered irrelevant or confusing to overseas audiences.<ref name="international">{{cite news|title=The Chaser goes global|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/the-chaser-goes-global/2007/10/29/1193618793384.html |work=[[The Age]]|date=[[2007-10-30]]|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref>

After the last episode of ''The Chaser Decides'', The Chaser ruled out doing any television productions in the first half of 2008. This included ''The Chaser's War on Everything'', with the group opting to do a stage production of their antics around Australia, called ''[[The Chaser's Age of Terror Variety Hour]]''. It is unclear if the ''War on Everything'' will return beyond that time.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,22868031-5013560,00.html | title=Chaser's war not on television | date=[[4 December]] [[2007]] |publisher=[[news.com.au]]|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}</ref>

==Show format==
* '''Credits''' - The opening credits show the five starring members of the show, but through that there are images of notable politicians and celebrities which are targeted in the titles. The titles are always the same except for two changable titles, which targets persons in recent events. The closing credits simply read all the cast and crew of the show, though commonly a video is played over half the credits, which is explained in the Conclusion.

* '''Introduction''' – Each episode begins with Reucassel and Taylor opening the show. The pair discuss the major recent events, present their opinions, and often show a pre-produced stunt or sketch. 

* '''Name changes''' - From the beginning of season 2 onwards, the credits of names as displayed during the program have been replaced in various manners. Normally they are changed to peoples in recent events or a simple addition to the name such as Julian bin Morrow.

* '''Dialogues''' – In almost every episode, the Chaser members discuss a various recent event or generalised stunt. Most of these dialogues lead to a pre-produced stunt, ad or trailer. Most of this material doesn't fall into one of the various '''Segments''', where most of there recurring material is shown. In the first season, Monologues were also common.

* '''Conclusion''' – To end each episode the whole team gathers together, with one of the group members saying the closing joke.

===Primary segments===

The primary segments form the backbone of the show. These segments normally focus on key issues in a range of topics. They are generally presented by the cast members, live in front of the audience, and may be accompanied with pre-produced stunts and sketches relating to the topics. 

[[Image:Chaser members doing ad road test.jpg‎|thumb|250px|right|Chaser member Chas Licciardello along with Chris Taylor (right) and ABC crew, doing an Ad Road-Test on Godfrey's vacuum cleaners]]

* '''"What Have We Learnt from Current Affairs This Week?"''' – Presented by Hansen and Licciardello, the segment pokes fun at the sensationalism used in competing weeknight [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programs ''[[Today Tonight]]'' and ''[[A Current Affair]]''. All segments feature a lesson on their reporting techniques, such as how to spot "dodgy" guys and how to identify the different types of "experts". Both shows are regularly criticised for their tendency to come to fast and inaccurate conclusions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/mediareport/stories/2006/1655461.htm |title=The strange world of news satire|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|work=The Media Report|date=[[8 June]] [[2006]]|author=Funnell, Anthony|accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref>

* '''"Firth in the USA"''' – Firth, now living in the United States, performs a stunt or conducts an interview, with obvious references to USA culture. Stunt examples include meeting [[Hillary Clinton]] to offer his services as her presidential [[intern]]; a satire of the [[Lewinsky scandal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/articles/2007/04/12/1175971220516.html|title=Chaser stunt turns heads in US|publisher=''Brisbane Times''|date=[[12 April]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref>

* '''"The Ad Road-Test"''' – The team recreate situations shown in [[television advertisements]] to see if they would work in real life. Examples include whether male cheerleaders can convince a random person to stop smoking.<ref name="ad">{{cite web|url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/stay-in-touch/no-matter-how-well-you-plan-theres-always-a-flea/2006/05/18/1147545454544.html?page=2|title= No matter how well you plan, there's always a flea|date=[[19 May]] [[2006]]|publisher=''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''|accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref>

* '''"In Other News ..."''' – A former segment, presented by Morrow and Reucassel, which focused on current news stories and events, and sometimes showed a pre-produced stunt related to the news item. This was the only segment to appear in every episode of Season One.

The following segments were introduced in Season Two.

* '''"The Fixers"''' – Seeming to replace "In Other News ...", Morrow and Reucassel examine problems in the community, and present their idea for a fix. This is usually accompanied by a pre-produced item.

=== Supporting segments ===
The supporting segments are usually pre-produced stunts and sketches, supplementing the primary segments of the show. They are generally much shorter in length.

* '''"Surprise Spruiker"''' – Hansen plays a shop "[[spruiker]]" attempts to help various institutions having trouble selling a particular item or idea. The stunt usually concludes when he is ordered by security guards to switch off his speakers.

* '''"Scenes from the Life of the Crazy Warehouse Guy"''' – Hansen plays a stereotypical announcer from a [[warehouse]] television advertisement uses his unique speaking style in everyday situations, such as ordering [[McDonald's]]. Hansen originally performed the character that would become the Crazy Warehouse Guy in parodies of frantic rug warehouse commercials.

* '''"Pursuit Trivia"''' – Morrow tests the general knowledge of a politician or celebrity by asking a [[Trivial Pursuit]] question from a game card in his hand at an [[interview]] or [[press conference]]. Prominent in the first season though not in the second.

* '''"Mr Ten Questions"''' – Hansen poses for a journalist at a press conference and, when prompted, proceeds to ask ten questions without letting the interviewee speak until he has read out all ten. Questions can relate to the subject or be completely obscure. 

* '''"A Message From Osama Bin Laden" / Subtitles''' – An existing video of the infamous terrorist [[Osama Bin Laden]] is subbed with incorrect and humorous [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], often declaring a [[Jihad]] on various people for arbitrary irritations.  Videos of [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] and Kevin Rudd ([[Standard Mandarin|Chinese]] speech) have also been used in a similar manner, but not as common.

* '''"Citizens' Infringement Officer"''' – Morrow acts as an officer who hands out fake fines on behalf of general citizens. Reasons for fines are often very unusual, such as fines given to people with "wanker" [[Vehicle registration plate|number plates]].

The following segments were introduced in Season Two.

* '''"If Life Were A Musical"''' – Members of the cast go to the public, targeting a specific person in an everyday life scenario, and behave as though they are in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-esque musical. The segment is referred to as a "Taylor Hansen Morrow" production, a spoof of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].

* '''"Clive The Slightly-Too-Loud Commuter"''' – Hansen plays Clive who goes onto [[public transport]] and begins to talk loudly on his [[mobile phone]] about very personal or taboo issues.

===Occasional segments===
These segments support the show, however do not feature prominently.

* '''"What Have We Learnt From History?"''' – In this segment Hansen, Taylor and Reucassel test whether people today have learnt a lesson from events in the past; for example the invasion of the [[Trojan Horse]].

* '''"Famous Face Off"''' – A former segment, presented by Hansen, in which two "masters" in a particular field competed to be the best in an endeavour such as tongue-twisting newsreading.

* '''"The 2:30 Report"''' – A former segment, presented by Licciardello and Morrow, which reviewed the worst of late-night television, including late night game shows such as [[Quizmania (Australia)|Quizmania]].

The following segments were introduced in Season Two.

* '''"The News According To Fox"''' – Licciardello and Hansen criticise the bias of the popular American [[Fox News Channel]].

* '''"What You Missed on Cable"''' – Presented by Licciardello and Morrow, this segment highlights the oddities on [[pay television]] programs, and occasionally compares them to the bland programming on [[ABC1]]. Licciardello and Morrow pointed out that it was intended to replace the 2:30 Report segment from Season One.<ref name="ep4s2com">''The Chaser's War on Everything'' (Commentary). [[ABC1]]. No. 4, season 2.</ref>

* '''"Anna Coren's Segue/Meaningless Gibberish of the Week"''' – Integrated into '''"What Have We Learnt from Current Affairs This Week?"''', this segment looks at either [[Anna Coren|Coren]]'s extremely complicated transitions between unrelated stories, or the strange and meaningless introductions she says on ''Today Tonight''.

* '''"Nut Job of the Week"''' – Licciardello and Taylor take a look at the "special people in our society"; people who have "alternative views". For example, [[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]]'s theory on how to acquire your deepest desires by the [[Law of Attraction]] was examined.

* '''"Open Mic"''' – A segment, derived from a stunt from the first half of the second series, where Morrow goes to various businesses and uses their [[Public address|Public Address Systems]] to make humorous community announcements.

* '''"Election Watch"''' - Licciardello and Taylor observe a certain topic in relation to the federal election. This segment was only seen in the weeks leading up to the 2007 federal election and often made reference to subjects not related to the election.

===Recurring material===
*'''Stunts''' - A staple of the show, stunts can vary from confronting celebrities or politicians to testing staff reactions in shops and department stores. The stunts must be approved by the ABC Legal Department, to prevent breach of the law. In the 2007 DVD of the first half of the season, it is stated that the basic formula for the stunts is "go in, get our footage and get kicked out".

*'''Sketches''' - There are a few stunts performed on the show that are shot in controlled conditions, with either hired actors or by setting up people. The Chaser team refer to these controlled stunts as 'sketches'.<ref name="ep26s1com">''The Chaser's War on Everything'' (Commentary). [[ABC1]]. No. 26, season 1.</ref>

*'''Songs''' – Hansen, or sometimes other members, perform songs with a humorous theme. Although all the music and vocals are by Hansen, the lyrics are usually written by Taylor, and other members who often appear to be singing or playing are sometimes just miming or pretending to play.

*'''Television Advertisements''' – Throughout the series the team create satirical [[television advertisements]], which either advertise a false item or mock existing ads.

*'''Movie Trailers''' – The team creates parody trailers for existing movies or new movie ideas. 

*'''Vox Pop''' – One of the team members conduct [[vox pop]]s with people on the street asking for their opinions.

== Controversies and well-known stunts==
;Julian Morrow's novelty cheque
On [[8 February]] [[2006]], before the first episode of the show had screened, Morrow approached [[Australian Wheat Board]] executive Charles Stott with a fake novelty cheque, made out to [[Saddam Hussein]], and asked Stott to sign it.  Stott's lawyer said his client felt intimidated by the stunt, and the footage of the stunt was not shown in the first episode as scheduled due to "legal reasons". In the first episode to go to air, Morrow responded by raising the point that Charles Stott has done business with Saddam Hussein, a brutal dictator, yet he is intimidated by a large novelty cheque. The footage of this stunt does appear as a bonus on the show's first DVD.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200602/s1565449.htm|title=AWB inquiry not laughing over 'The Chaser' stunt|date=[[2006-02-08]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>

;Chris Taylor on ''Sunrise''
[[Image:Taylorsunrise.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Chris Taylor on ''Sunrise'']]
On the ninth episode of the show, Taylor announced that he planned to break-up with his partner of seven years, but he didn't want to ask her "the usual boring way", but do "something special, something she'll remember". The segment shows several of Taylor's attempts to "pop the question", including hanging a sign over a freeway, and "proposing" on a big screen at an outdoor festival. For the finale, Taylor introduces the interview of him on the morning television program, ''[[Sunrise (TV program)|Sunrise]]''. In the interview, Taylor asks the host if he can send a quick message to his partner, he then proceeds to tell her to "get the fuck out of my life". This finale from the segment was leaked onto the internet and has been widely distributed by email. Many viewers believed the segment was actually real but Taylor admitted on national radio station [[Triple J]] that it was set up. It was actually filmed after ''Sunrise'' went to air, with Channel Seven editing on screen graphics for realism.  The hosts of ''Sunrise'' admitted it was a set up. However, they did not know what Taylor was going to say because he only asked if he could do a bit for the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/chasing-down-the-powerful/2007/03/20/1174153069543.html?page=5|title=Chasing down the powerful|publisher=''[[The Age]]''|accessdate=2007-10-15|work=Debi Enker|date=[[March 22]] [[2007]]}}</ref>

;Chas Licciardello's Bulldogs incident
On [[14 July]] [[2006]], Licciardello was charged with offensive conduct after attempting to sell fake [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] merchandise outside an [[National Rugby League|NRL]] game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/chaser-star-in-court/2007/01/22/1169330808859.html |title=Chaser star leaves it to the video ref|publisher=''[[The Age]]''|date=[[22 January]] [[2007]]|author=Jano Gibson|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> The merchandise included plastic [[knuckledusters]] and [[balaclava]]s in the Bulldogs' colours, and was supposed to satirise the anti-social and hooligan behaviour of some Bulldogs fans. Several Bulldogs fans took offence and as a result he was charged for offensive behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/chaser-canterbury-joke-gets-no-laughs/2006/07/15/1152637916434.html |title=Chaser Canterbury joke gets no laughs|date=[[2006-07-16]]|publisher=''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''|author=Erin O'Dwyer, Daniel Dasey|accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref> On the broadcast following his arrest, Licciardello appeared onstage in handcuffs and within an iron cage.

;Craig Reucassel's axe stunt
On [[2 August]] [[2006]], Reucassel responded to a news story about a private school student who had hugged Prime Minister [[John Howard]] while holding a [[screwdriver]] during one of the PM's morning walks.  To test the Prime Minister's security arrangements, he approached John Howard during a morning walk and asked for a hug while holding a large plastic [[battle axe]].  Reucassel did receive the hug, but a later approach while holding a running [[chainsaw]] was not so successful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newstext.com.au/pages/v.asp?doc=TAM%2D20070317%2D1%2D001%2DK306700%40NAT%2DNEWS%2D2008%2D2007&k2docdate=17/03/2007&querytext=%28Chaser%5C%27s+war+on+comedy%29+%3CAND%3E+%28%28SDate%3E%3D02%2F20%2F2007%29%29&Auth=0&site=ALL&Pick=ONE&dtype=4&f=1&WF=%2Fsupport%2Fdb%2Easp%3Fdoc%3DTAM%252D20070317%252D1%252D001%252DK306700%2540NAT%252DNEWS%252D2008%252D2007%26k2docdate%3D17%2F03%2F2007%26querytext%3D%2528Chaser%255C%2527s%2Bwar%2Bon%2Bcomedy%2529%2B%253CAND%253E%2B%2528%2528SDate%253E%253D02%252F20%252F2007%2529%2529%26Auth%3D0%26v%3D1%26site%3DALL%26Pick%3DONE

On [[19 March]] [[2007]], during a campaign appearance for the [[New South Wales general election, 2007|New South Wales State Election]], the then [[Opposition (Australia)|opposition leader]] [[Peter Debnam]] was confronted by Reucassel wearing nothing but [[Speedos]] and a baseball cap,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Speedowearing-comedian-confronts-Debnam/2007/03/19/1174152947020.html|title=Speedo wearing comedian confronts Debnam|date=[[2007-03-19]]|publisher=''[[The Age]]''}}</ref> making fun of Debnam's campaign appearances in the swimwear.

[[Image:Chaser fake apec pass.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Imitation ''insecurity'' passes used by ''The Chaser'' to breach the [[APEC Australia 2007]] restricted zone]]

During the [[APEC Australia 2007|APEC Leaders Summit]] in [[Sydney]], on [[6 September]] [[2007]], Morrow and Licciardello along with nine other production crew members were arrested after they drove a fake [[Canadian]] [[motorcade]] down [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]] and successfully breached the APEC restricted zone.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/chaser-duo-held-over-apec-stunt/2007/09/06/1188783379922.html | title = Chaser duo held over APEC stunt | publisher = ''[[The Age]]'' |date=2007-09-06 | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}</ref> Police only realised that the motorcade was a hoax when Licciardello, dressed as [[Osama bin Laden]], stepped out of the car replete with bonnet-mounted Canadian flag and complained in-character about not being invited.<ref> {{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/nation-of-larrikins-well-yes-and-no-/2007/09/08/1188783558424.html | title = Nation of larrikins?

The footage of the prank, which was seized by the police, was returned to the ABC and featured in their next episode the following week.

Despite condemnations by various public officials, the Sydney correspondent to the [[BBC]] reported that the ''Chaser'' team had become 'folk heroes' following the stunt.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6985775.stm | title =  Apec security leaves bitter taste in Sydney | publisher = bbc.co.uk |date=2007-09-09 | accessdate = 2007-09-10}}</ref> Indeed, [[Alexander Downer]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs]], appeared amused when asked to comment.<ref name="AGE-070907" />

;"The Eulogy Song" 
On the [[17 October]] [[2007]] episode, Hansen sang a song that was written by Taylor which satirised the lives of several deceased celebrities, including [[Peter Brock]], [[Princess Diana]], [[Donald Bradman]], [[Steve Irwin]], [[Jeff Buckley]] and [[Kerry Packer]], expressing the view that people with flaws during life are often disproportionately hailed as "top blokes" after death. The song became the target of significant media attention, with several radio and television personalities saying the song was in "bad taste", and both then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] and then opposition leader [[Kevin Rudd]] expressing negative views. A few days later, the team approached John Howard on his morning walk, dressed as rabbits, and sparked a reaction from the Prime Minister, with him saying: "You blokes are a lot funnier when you pick on someone who's alive".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,22612694-5005368,00.html|title=PM lashes Chaser crew when ambushed on morning walk|publisher=''PerthNow''|accessdate=2007-10-21|}}</ref>

A number of news programs reported that the ABC's switchboard was jammed with calls from "disgusted viewers" immediately following the show. It was later revealed that only six calls had been made that night about the show, three of them in a positive light. Although a number of complaints were received the next day the ABC alleged that a large number were listeners of a [[Neil Mitchell (radio announcer)|Melbourne radio show]], and that when asked many said they hadn't seen the show. In response some shows such as ''Today Tonight'' claimed many more complaints would follow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22607098-2,00.html|title=Howard, Rudd lash out at Chaser song|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>

In response to the attention, Taylor supported the message, stating that it was a legitimate skit and that although the song mentioned recently deceased breast cancer victim [[Belinda Emmett]], the rest of the cast pretending to cut off Hansen before he completed his verse was "making a joke about the inappropriateness of making a joke about Belinda Emmett."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=306835|title=Chaser's war on good taste|publisher=[[ninemsn]]|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> He also revealed it was a "watered down" version of the song which was previously performed twice on stage in his musical ''Dead Caesar''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22606121-5007132,00.html|title= Offensive Chaser defends song war on dead celebs|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2007-10-18|last=McLean|first=Stuart}}</ref>

;Seven Network Injunction
On [[14 November]] [[2007]], The Chaser made an attempt to poke fun at ''Today Tonight'' and the way that they re-enact procedures and events which they base their stories on. As they had done several times before, they infiltrated the Seven Network's news headquarters at [[Martin Place]] and requested for the ''Today Tonight'' presenter [[Anna Coren]], where they came dressed as pretend cameos for the re-enactment segments. However, within the headquarters, they were confronted by the staff of the building for alleged [[trespass]]ing. Both ''Today Tonight'' and their rival ''A Current Affair'' broadcast reports of the stunt, the ''Today Tonight'' broadcast claiming that they had finally caught the Chaser red-handed. However ''A Current Affair'' did a relatively lighter report on the incident, seeming to take side with the Chaser. Channel Seven got an injunction to stop The Chaser showing the segment, however, The Chaser planned on challenging the injunction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/scjudgments/2007nswsc.nsf/6ccf7431c546464bca2570e6001a45d2/f9ef51ef9f69debfca2573930001eac2?OpenDocument |title=	Seven Network (Operations) Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Corporation & 2 Ors <nowiki>[2007]</nowiki> NSWSC 1289|publisher=Lawlink|accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=322583|title=Seven gets injunction against the Chaser|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=[[ninemsn]]}}</ref> In place of their planned stunt, they shot a "hasty and dubious" reenactment of it. 
Channel 7 boss [[David Leckie]] exclaimed in an outburst at waiting photographers outside Channel 7's offices that The Chaser were "...nothing but a bunch of tossers, they're fucking wankers"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/seven-boss-blows-up-at-chaser-stunt/2007/11/15/1194766848746.html|title=Seven boss blows up at Chaser stunt|accessdate=2007-12-28|author=Dylan Welch|date=2007-11-15|publisher=''[[The Age]]''}}</ref>, Morrow responded "I interpret those comments as David making overtures to us.

== Reception and impact ==
===Current affairs programs===
Current affairs programs, notably [[Channel 7]]'s ''Today Tonight'' and [[Channel 9]]'s ''A Current Affair'', have run pieces critical of The Chaser team. ''A Current Affair'' ran segments covering rumours of the program moving to a commercial network, and the use of Osama bin Laden for humour, highlighting dangerous stunts and overstepping the mark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatsonthetube.net/2007/05/09/aca-back-on-the-chasers-tail/ |title=ACA Back on The Chaser's Tail|publisher=whatsonthetube|date=2007-05-09|accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref><Ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21740582-5006022,00.html |title=Chasing the Chaser|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|work=''[[The Herald Sun]]''|date=2007-05-16|accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref>

''Today Tonight'' ran segments demonstrating contrivances in Chaser's stunts and criticising their breakthrough of APEC's security.<ref name="crikey">{{Cite web|url = http://www.crikey.com.au/Media-Arts-and-Sports/20070907-Media-briefs-and-TV-ratings.html|title = Today Tonight v The Chaser: who's got the credibility?|author = Dyer, Glen|date=2007-09-07|publisher = Crikey!|accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref> However, when ''Today Tonight'' asked if they could follow The Chaser team on one of their stunts, The Chaser agreed. The Chaser chose a stunt that would embarrass the Channel 7 television program. They did so by having a "Meakin Booze Bus"; in reference to Channel 7 boss [[Peter Meakin]], who was recently convicted of drink driving. In the shoot, The Chaser members kept bringing up the topic of Peter Meakin to reporter James Thomas.<ref>Episode 12, Season 2: The Chaser’s War on Everything ABC</ref> It was revealed later that The Chaser did eventually answer enough of Thomas’ questions so that ''Today Tonight'' received what they wanted, but ''Today Tonight'' did not end up running that footage. Channel 7 broadcast scenes that they judged made the Chaser crew look arrogant, although it was stated in The Chaser's season 2 DVD commentary that James Thomas later called The Chaser team and apologised for the way ''Today Tonight'' depicted them in the report.<ref> Episode 12, Season 2: The Chaser’s War on Everything DVD Audio Commentary</ref>
