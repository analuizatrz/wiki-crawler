The '''Avia BH-6''' was a prototype fighter plane built in Czechoslovakia in 1923. It was a single-bay biplane of unusual configuration developed in tandem with the [[Avia BH-7|BH-7]], which shared its fuselage and tail design. The BH-6 had wings of unequal span, but unusually, the top wing was the shorter of the two; and while it was braced to the bottom wing by with a single I-strut on either side, these sloped inwards from bottom to top. Finally, the top wing was attached to the fuselage not by a set of cabane struts, but by a single large pylon.

The BH-6 crashed early in its test programme, and when the related BH-7 did as well, both implementations of this design were abandoned.
