R. R. Tolkien]] in the tradition of the [[fairy tale]]. It was first published on [[September 21]], [[1937]] to wide acclaim. While it stands in its own right, it is often seen as a prelude to Tolkien's monumental novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==Overview==

''The Hobbit'' is set in a time "between the dawn of Faerie and the Dominion of Men",<ref name="eaton">{{cite news |last=Eaton |first=Anne T. |title=A Delightfully Imaginative Journey |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1938/03/13/movies/LOTR-HOBBIT.html |date=1938-03-13}}</ref> and follows the quest of home-loving Bilbo Baggins (the "Hobbit" of the title) as he leaves his comedic-rustic village and moves into darker, deeper territory<ref>{{cite journal |last=Langford |first=David |authorlink=David Langford |year=2001 |title=Lord of the Royalties |journal=[[SFX magazine]] |url= http://www.ansible.co.uk/sfx/tolkien.html |accessdate= 2007-09-29}}</ref> encountering various denizens of the Wilderland, in order to reach and win his share of Smaug the Dragon's hoard. Through accepting the nature of his "Tookish" half (a disrespectable, romantic, fey and adventurous side of his family tree) and utilising both his wits and common sense during the quest, Bilbo develops a level of maturity, competence and wisdom.<ref name="Matthews">{{cite book | author=Matthews, Dorothy | chapter=The Psychological Journey of Bilbo Baggins |title=A Tolkien Compass |pages=27-40}}</ref>

==Important Characters==

*[[Bilbo Baggins]], the eponymous protagonist, a respectable, comfort-loving, middle-aged [[hobbit]]. He joins the adventure as a reluctant burglar.
*[[Gandalf]], an itinerant [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] who introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]] and then appears and disappears at key points throughout the story.
*[[Thorin Oakenshield]], bombastic head of the company and heir to a dwarven kingdom under the [[Lonely Mountain]].
*[[Smaug]], a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarven kingdom of Thorin's grandfather.

The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance, such as the twelve other [[Dwarves]] of the company; [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elves]]; [[Man (Middle-earth)|men]] (humans); [[Troll (Middle-earth)|trolls]]; [[Orc (Middle-earth)|goblins]]; giant spiders; [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagles]]; [[Warg]]s (evil wolves); [[Elrond]] the sage; [[Gollum]], a mysterious creature inhabiting an underground lake; [[Beorn]], a man who can assume bear-form; and [[Bard the Bowman]], a heroic archer of [[Esgaroth|Lake-town]].

==Synopsis==
In the first chapter, Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a party for the thirteen dwarves, who aim to reclaim the [[Lonely Mountain]] and its treasure from the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]]. Gandalf unveils an old map revealing a [[secret passage|secret door]] into the mountain, proposes to enter by stealth and puts forward Bilbo as a "burglar". The Dwarves, and in spite of himself, Bilbo, agree.

Early on in the book, Gandalf saves the bumbling company from trolls. The company passes into the [[Misty Mountains]] and are captured by goblins. Though Gandalf rescues the dwarves from the goblin tunnels, Bilbo becomes lost. Groping along, Bilbo finds a [[magic ring]] and, risking death, plays a game of [[riddles]] with a creature called Gollum. Bilbo barely wins and with the help of the ring, which confers [[invisibility]] when worn, he saves himself for the first time, and rejoins the company. Bilbo's reputation is thus improved. They pass through [[Mirkwood]], where Bilbo saves the dwarves from giant spiders. After the dwarves are captured by [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]], he rescues them from prison. By this time it is Bilbo whom the group relies on in Gandalf's absence, and he in turn relies on his ring.

Their journey takes them to Lake-town, where the townspeople welcome the company, hopeful the dwarves will fulfil old prophecies of Smaug's demise. Rested and provisioned, the company proceeds to the mountain. They enter the secret tunnel, whereupon the dwarves invoke the burglary contract to coerce Bilbo into scouting the dragon's disposition. Bilbo finds the great hall with its dazzling hoard and fell guardian. Bilbo parleys cleverly with Smaug, learning of a weakness in his armour but at the same time unwittingly revealing  clues about the quest. The dragon deduces that Lake-town aided the venture, so he sets out to destroy the town. However, a noble [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] has overheard Bilbo's report about Smaug's weak spot. As Smaug ravages Lake-town, the thrush conveys this information to Bard the Bowman, who shoots and kills the dragon. When Smaug does not return, the dwarves take possession of the mountain and its hoard. Bilbo finds the prized [[Arkenstone]] gem and, uneasy about the greedy bravado of the dwarves, hides it away.

The regrouped Lake-men, aided by the Wood-elves, travel to the Mountain to request reparations, payment for their aid, and settlement of old claims on the treasure. Thorin refuses all negotiations and summons his kin from the north to reinforce his position. The Wood-elves arrive with their claims to the treasure. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to head off a war, but the dwarves are intransigent. Thorin, livid, banishes Bilbo. War looms inevitable.

At the last moment, Gandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men, and elves defer their differences and band together, and a fierce battle ensues. The situation turns dire, but with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn, the [[Battle of Five Armies]] is won. Thorin is among the casualties, but he lives long enough to part with Bilbo as friends, recognising Bilbo's wisdom and selflessness in the end. The treasure is divided fairly, but, having no need or desire for it, Bilbo refuses most of his share. Nevertheless, he returns home with enough to make himself a very wealthy hobbit.

==Concept and creation==
===Writing===
In a [[1955]] letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien recollects that in the late 1920s, when he was Professor of Anglo-Saxon at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]], he began ''The Hobbit'' when he was marking School Certificate papers. He found one blank piece of paper. Suddenly inspired he wrote the words "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit." He did not go any further than that at the time, although in the following years he drew up [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#Thrór|Thrór's]] map, outlining the geography of the tale. It was eventually published when a family friend named Elaine Griffiths was shown a typescript of the story in the early 1930s. When she later went to work for George Allen & Unwin, she revealed the existence of the story to a staffmember named Susan Dagnall, who in turn asked Tolkien if she could look at the (still incomplete) manuscript. He complied and Ms. Dagnall, impressed by it, urged him to complete the book. Once this was done in late 1936, she then showed the book to [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], who then asked his 10-year-old son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] to review it. Rayner wrote such an enthusiastic review of the book that it was published by [[Allen & Unwin]].

Tolkien introduced or mentioned characters and places that figured prominently{{Fact|date=September 2007}} in his [[legendarium]], specifically [[Elrond]] and [[Gondolin]], along with elements from Germanic legend. 

In May and June 2007, HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin published ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'' in the United Kingdom.  Much like ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', ''The History of The Hobbit'' examines in two volumes previously unpublished original drafts of ''The Hobbit'' with extensive commentary by [[John Rateliff]]. In celebration and recognition of the 70th anniversary of ''The Hobbit'', ''The History'' was published in the United States on September 21, 2007, exactly 70 years after the initial publication of Tolkien's work.

=== Publication ===
[[Image:Hobbit cover.JPG|right|200px|thumb|200px|Dustcover of the first edition of ''The Hobbit''. This cover was designed by Tolkien himself, as was the binding illustrated at the top of this article.]]
George Allen & Unwin, Ltd. of London published the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' on September 21, 1937. It was illustrated with many black-and-white drawings by Tolkien himself. The original printing numbered a mere 1,500 copies and sold out by December due to enthusiastic reviews.<ref name="hammond-anderson">{{cite book | last = Hammond | first = Wayne | coauthors = Douglas A. Anderson | title = J. R. R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography | publisher = [[Oak Knoll Press]] | location = New Castle, Delaware | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-938768-42-5 | pages = 15,18,21,48,54}}</ref> Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York prepared an American edition to be released early in 1938 in which four of the illustrations would be colour plates. Allen & Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937.<ref name="hammond-anderson"/> Despite the book's popularity, wartime conditions forced the London publisher to print small runs of the remaining two printings of the first edition.

The first printing of the first English language edition rarely sells for under $10,000 US dollars in any whole condition, and clean copies in original dust jackets signed by the author are routinely advertised for over $100,000.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

New [[English-language editions of The Hobbit|English-language editions of ''The Hobbit'']] spring up often, despite the book's age, with at least fifty editions having been published to date. Each comes from a different publisher or bears distinctive cover art, internal art, or substantial changes in format. The text of each generally adheres to the Allen & Unwin edition extant at the time it is published. In addition, the Hobbit has been [[Translations of The Hobbit|translated into over forty languages]]. Some languages have seen multiple translations.

====Revisions====
The decision that the events of ''The Hobbit'' could belong to the same universe as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' was only made long after publication, when the publisher asked for a sequel and Tolkien began work on what would become ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

In the first edition of the tale, Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle-game, and he and Bilbo part amicably.<ref>Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' (1988)</ref> During the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'' Tolkien saw the need to revise these passages, in order to reflect his new concept of the [[One Ring|ring]] and its powerful hold on Gollum. Tolkien tried many different passages in the chapter that would become chapter 2 of ''The Lord of the Rings'', "The Shadow of the Past". Eventually Tolkien decided a rewrite of ''The Hobbit'' was in order, and he sent a sample chapter of this rewrite ("Riddles in the Dark") to his publishers. He heard nothing further for months. When he was sent [[galley proof]]s of a new edition he learned to his surprise the new chapter had been incorporated as the result of a misunderstanding.<ref name="carpenter-tolkien">{{cite book | last = Carpenter | first = Humphrey | authorlink = Humphrey Carpenter | title = J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography | publisher = [[George Allen & Unwin]] | location = London | year = 1977 | oclc = 3046822}}</ref>

In ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien [[Retcon#Addition|retroactively establishes]] that the events of ''The Hobbit'' take place during the "[[Third Age]]" of [[Middle-earth]],<ref name ="prologue">{{ME-ref|fotr|Prologue}}</ref> a fictional prehistoric Earth<ref name ="prologue" /><ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#211, footnote}}</ref>).

In ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien presents himself as the translator of the supposedly historic ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'', where Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s stories were recorded. In the book's prologue, as well as in the chapter "The Shadow of the Past", Tolkien  explains the original version of the riddle-game as a "lie" that Bilbo made up because of the One Ring's influence on him, and which he originally wrote down in his diary, the basis of ''The Hobbit''. Revised versions of ''The Hobbit'' would contain the "true" version of events.<ref name = "prologue">{{ME-ref|fotr|Prologue}}</ref> Later, Bilbo finally confesses the true story at the Council of [[Elrond]], although Gandalf had deduced the truth earlier.<ref>{{ME-ref|fotr|"The Council of Elrond"}}</ref>  

Tolkien made other small changes in order to conform the narrative to events in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and in the ideas he was continually developing for the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]''{{Fact|date=September 2007}}. This first revision became the second edition, published in 1951 in both UK and American editions.<ref name="hammond-anderson"/> 

Minor corrections to the text appeared in the third (1966) and fourth editions (1978).<ref>Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' (1988), 322-328</ref> For example, the phrase ''elves that are now called [[Gnome]]s'' appears in the first<ref name="Hobbit first edition">{{cite book | last = Tolkien | first = J. R. R. | title = The Hobbit | publisher = George Allen & Unwin | location = London | year = 1937 | pages = 63}}</ref> and second<ref name="Hobbit second edition">{{cite book | last = Tolkien | first = J. R. R. | title = The Hobbit | publisher = George Allen & Unwin | location = London | year = 1951 | pages = 63}}</ref> editions on page 63. Tolkien had used "Gnome" in his earlier writing to refer to the second kindred of the [[High Elves]] – the [[Noldor]] (or "Deep Elves"). Tolkien thought that "gnome", being derived from the Greek ''gnosis'' (knowledge), was a good name for the Noldor he created to be the wisest of the other Elves, but with its English connotations of a small, secretive, and unattractive creature (see [[garden gnome]]) Tolkien ultimately replaced the phrase with ''High Elves of the West, my kin'' in the third edition<ref name="Hobbit third edition">{{cite book | last = Tolkien | first = J. R. R. | title = The Hobbit | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | location = Boston | year = 1966 | pages = 62 | ISBN = 0-395-07122-4}}</ref>.

In its final revision, ''The Hobbit'' still has many differences in tone from ''The Lord of the Rings''. For example, Orcs are called "goblins" in ''The Hobbit'', but more often referred to as Orcs in ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' (1988)</ref> Many of these inconsistencies occur because Tolkien originally wrote the book as a children's story separate from (but connected to) his mythological work, <ref name="carpenter-tolkien" /> and his concept of Middle-earth was to change and evolve throughout his life and writings.<ref>Christopher Tolkien, ''The History of Middle-earth''</ref>

==Style==
The basic form of the story is that of a [[quest]], told in [[episode]]s. Tolkien fills the story with a wealth of detail regarding minor characters and distant events which can make his imaginary world seem to have more depth, but has been seen by some{{who?|date=September 2007}} to slow down the pace.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} The narrative voice often addresses the reader directly, a device which the author himself came to dislike.<ref name="Carpenter">{{ME-ref|Biography}}</ref> ([[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s biography of Tolkien claims that when revised the book after a period of nearly 20 years, he had to restrain himself from rewriting it entirely.<ref name="carpenter-tolkien" />)

The novel draws on Tolkien's knowledge of historical languages and early European texts, the names of Gandalf and all but one of the thirteen dwarves being taken directly from the [[Old Norse]] poem "Voluspa" from the [[Elder Edda]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/lordoftheringstrilogy/lessons/two/handouts.jsp |title=Tolkien's Middle-earth: Lesson Plans, Unit Two |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref> and its illustrations (provided by the author) make use of [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] [[rune]]s. The story is filled with information on calendars and moon phases, detailed geographical descriptions that fit well with the accompanying maps — attention to detail that is also found in Tolkien's later work.

==Major themes==

''The Hobbit'' may be read as Tolkien's parable of the [[World War I|First World War]], where the hero is plucked from his rural home, and thrown into a far off war where traditional types of heroism are shown to be futile<ref>Carpenter, Humphrey: ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Review, The Times 2003 [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article1020455.ece ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Review, The Times 2003]</ref> and as such explores the theme of heroism.

The [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] concept of [[individuation]] is reflected through theme of growing maturity and capability, with the author seen to be contrasting Bilbo's personal growth against the lack of that of the dwarves. <ref name="Matthews" />

Greed plays a central role in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from one or more of the characters simple desire for food (be it Trolls eating Dwarves, or Dwarves eating Wood-elf fare) or a desire for objects, such as gold and jewels.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

== Adaptations ==
Over the years, ''The Hobbit'' has been adapted for other media multiple times.

[[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''[[The Hobbit (1968 radio series)|The Hobbit]]'' [[radio drama]], adapted by Michael Kilgarriff, in eight parts (4 hours) from September to November 1968, which starred [[Anthony Jackson (actor)|Anthony Jackson]] as narrator, [[Paul Daneman]] as Bilbo and [[Heron Carvic]] as Gandalf.

[[Nicol Williamson]]'s abridged reading of the book was released on four [[LP record]]s in 1974 by [[Argo Records (UK)|Argo Records]].

''[[The Hobbit (film)|The Hobbit]]'', an [[animated]] version of the story, produced by [[Rankin/Bass]], debuted as a [[television movie]] in the [[United States]] in 1977.

The American radio theatre company ''The Mind's Eye'' produced an audio adaptation of "The Hobbit" which was released on six one-hour audio cassettes in 1979. 

The [[BBC]] children's television series ''[[Jackanory]]'' presented an adaptation of ''The Hobbit'' in 1979.<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Hobbit | series = Jackanory | serieslink = Jackanory}} [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0771799/ Internet Movie Database: ''Jackanory'', "The Hobbit" (1979)]</ref> Unusually for the programme, the adaptation had multiple storytellers. According to one of the narrators [[David Wood]] , the release of the production on video has been repeatedly stopped by the [[Tolkien Estate]].<ref>David Woods, website [http://www.stilesanddrewe.co.uk/david_wood_guestbook/guestbook/default.asp?PagePosition=11]</ref>

A three part comic book adaptation with script by [[Chuck Dixon]] and Sean Deming and illustrated by David Wenzel was published by [[Eclipse Comics]] in 1989. A reprint collected in one volume was released by [[Del Rey Books]] in 2001.

[[Robert Inglis]] adapted and performed a one-man [[theatre]] play of ''The Hobbit''. This performance led to him being asked to read/perform the unabridged audiobook for ''The Lord of the Rings'' for Recorded Books in 1990. In 1991 he read the unabridged version of ''The Hobbit''.

In 2004 an Operatic version of the story was written and had it's world premiere in Canada. The score is currently being revised and will have it's American premiere in the Spring of 2008 at the Sarasota Opera in Sarasota, Florida.

===Planned film===
[[Peter Jackson]] and his wife [[Fran Walsh]] expressed interest in 1995 in adapting [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s books. Jackson's pitch was to film ''The Hobbit'', and shoot ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' back-to-back afterward. They met with [[Saul Zaentz]], who bought the film rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' from [[MGM]] in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Brian Sibley]] | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher = HarperCollins | date = 2006 | location = London | pages = 313-116 | id = ISBN 0-00-717558-2}}</ref> However, frustration arose when Jackson's producer, [[Harvey Weinstein]] learnt Zaentz had production rights to ''The Hobbit'', but distribution rights still belonged to [[United Artists]]. U.A. was on the market, so Weinstein's attempts to buy those rights were unsuccessful. Weinstein asked Jackson to press on with adapting ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Brian Sibley]] | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher = HarperCollins | date = 2006 | location = London | pages = 323-25 | id = ISBN 0-00-717558-2}}</ref>

Eight years later, [[New Line Cinema]] had produced [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] after [[Miramax Films]] left when they wanted to condense the two planned ''Rings'' films into one.<ref>{{cite DVD-notes | title = The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring: Special Extended Edition | titlelink= The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film) | director = [[Peter Jackson]] | format = From Book to Script (documentary) | publisher = [[New Line Cinema]] | year = 2002}}</ref> However, New Line has a limited time option on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=limitedtime>{{cite news | author = Nicole LaPorte |url = http://movies.go.com/variety/feature?featureid=861521 |title = Inside Move: It's hard to be a 'Hobbit' |publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=  |accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref> MGM holds the distribution rights to ''The Hobbit'', and expressed interest in teaming up with New Line and Jackson to make the film in September 2006.<ref>{{cite news | author = Stax | title = MGM Eyes Hobbit, T4 | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2006-09-11]] | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/732/732006p1.html | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> MGM also expressed interest in another prequel film, set between ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{cite news | title = Hobbit, Crown, Panther News | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2006-11-14]] | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/746/746019p1.html | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref>

In March 2005, Jackson launched a lawsuit against New Line, claiming he had lost revenue from merchandising, video and computer games releases associated with ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of The Ring]]''.<ref>{{cite news | title = Director sues over Rings profits | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = [[2005-03-02]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4312463.stm | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> New Line co-founder [[Robert Shaye]] was annoyed with the lawsuit, and said in January 2007 that Jackson would never again direct a film for New Line, accusing Jackson of being greedy.<ref>{{cite news | title = Jackson ruled out of Hobbit film | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = [[2007-08-17]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6251099.stm | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> MGM was disappointed with New Line's decision.<ref name=limitedtime/> In August 2007, after a string of flops, Shaye was trying to repair his working relationship with Jackson. Shaye said, "I really respect and admire Peter and would love for him to be creatively involved in some way in ''The Hobbit''."<ref>{{cite news | author = Patrick Goldstein | title = THE BIG PICTURE: New Line's midlife crisis | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = [[2007-08-10]] | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-goldstein10aug10,0,7800308.story?coll=la-headlines-entnews | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref>

===Games===
''The Hobbit'' has been the subject of several [[board games]], including "The Lonely Mountain" (1984), "The Battle of Five Armies" (1984), and "The Hobbit Adventure Boardgame" (1997) all published by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]].

[[Games Workshop]] released a "Battle of Five Armies" (2005) [[tabletop wargame]] using 10mm figures, based on their [[Warmaster]] rules.

Several [[Video game|computer and video games]], both official and unofficial, have been based on the story. One of the first was ''[[The Hobbit (video game)|The Hobbit]]'', an award winning (Golden Joystick Award for Strategy Game of the Year 1983) computer game developed in 1982 by Beam Software and published by [[Melbourne House]] for most computers available at the time, from the more popular computers such as the [[ZX Spectrum]], and the [[Commodore 64]], through to the [[Dragon 32/64|Dragon 32]] and [[Oric Atmos|Oric]] computers. By arrangement with publishers, a copy of the novel was included with each game sold. [[Sierra Entertainment]] published a [[platform game]] titled ''[[The Hobbit (Vivendi Game)|The Hobbit]]'' in 2003 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[personal computer|PCs]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox]], and [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]]. It was a similar version of which was also published for the [[Game Boy Advance]].
