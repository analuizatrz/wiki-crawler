'''Nelly Kim Furtado''' (born [[December 2]] [[1978]]) is a <!-- NOT Portuguese-Canadian!! -- See talk first! -->[[Canada|Canadian]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]], [[record producer]], and [[musician|instrumentalist]] of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] descent. 

Furtado came to fame in 2000 with the release of her debut album ''[[Whoa, Nelly!]]'', which featured her breakthrough [[Grammy Award]]-winning single "[[I'm like a Bird]]".  After becoming a mother and after releasing the less commercially successful ''[[Folklore (album)|Folklore]]'' (2003), she returned to prominence in 2006 with the release of ''[[Loose (album)|Loose]]'' and its hit singles "[[Promiscuous (song)|Promiscuous]]", "[[Maneater (Nelly Furtado song)|Maneater]]", "[[Say It Right]]", and "[[All Good Things (Come to an End)]]". She has sold over fifteen million albums worldwide.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Furtado is known for experimenting with different instruments, sounds, genres, languages, and vocal styles. This diversity has been influenced by her wide-ranging musical taste and her interest in different cultures.<ref name=ym>{{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/interview/12058557|title=Exclusive LAUNCH Artist Chat |work=Yahoo!

===Early years===  
Nelly Furtado was born in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] to [[Portugal|Portuguese]] immigrants from the [[Azores]], Maria Manuela and António José Furtado.<ref name=rsjan01>
{{cite web| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5918613/furtado_goes_portuguese/|title=Furtado Goes Portuguese |work=Rolling Stone| accessdate=27 May|accessyear=2006 }}
</ref> She was named after [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[gymnast]] [[Nellie Kim]].<ref name=ym/> Raised in a devoutly [[Roman Catholic]] home, Furtado first sang at the age of four when she performed a duet with her mother at a church on [[Portugal Day]]. Although remaining unclear about her religious beliefs, she still affirms a belief in God, the Ten Commandments, and in avoiding the Seven Sins.<ref name=ym/>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nellyfurtado/articles/story/5931858/fly_girl}} She began playing instruments at the age of nine, learning the [[trombone]], [[ukulele]] and, in later years, the [[guitar]] and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]. At the age of twelve, she began writing songs,<ref name=ym/> and as a teenager, she performed in a Portuguese [[marching band]].<ref name=rsjan01/>

Furtado has acknowledged her family as the source of her strong work ethic; she spent eight summers working as a [[chambermaid]] with her mother, who was a [[Housekeeper (servant)|housekeeper]] in Victoria.<ref name=amg> {{cite web|url=http://www.allmusicguide.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:lcaxlfjekcqe~T1|title=Nelly Furtado Biography|work=All Music Guide|accessdate=27 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref> She has stated that coming from a working class background has shaped her identity in a positive way.<ref name=ym/> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nellyfurtado/articles/story/5931858/fly_girl|title=Fly Girl |work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=16 Aug|accessyear=2001}}</ref>

The first musicians Furtado interacted with were underground [[Rapping|rappers]] and [[Disc jockey|DJs]].<ref name=mtv>

</ref> At the end of the summer of 11<sup>th</sup> grade during a visit to [[Toronto]], Furtado met Tallis Newkirk, member of the [[hip hop]] group, Crazy Cheese. She <!--? ?-->  contributed vocals to their 1996 album, ''Join the Ranks'', on the track "Waitin' 4 the Streets".<ref name=nelstar> Nelly also featured alongside Los Angeles-based Hip Hop group [[Jurassic 5]], in their single "Thin Line", from the album Power In Numbers.

</ref> <!-- above sentence said "During visit to Toronto "AFTER" summer ... how can she spend "rest of summer" in Portugal?? -->
After graduating from [[Mount Douglas Secondary School]] in 1996, she moved to [[Toronto]].  The following year, she formed Nelstar, the [[trip hop]] duo with Newkirk.  During that time she played eight dates on "the village stage" at Lilith Fayre.  Ultimately, Furtado felt the trip-hop style of the duo was "too segregated" and believed it did not represent her personality or allow her to showcase her vocal ability.<ref name=nelstar/> She left the group and planned to move back home.

Before moving, however, she performed at the 1997 Honey Jam, an "all-female urban" talent show.<ref name=nelstar/><ref name=honeyjam>{{cite web |url = http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2003/05/2705.cfm | title = Honey Jam Searches for Urban Women | work = ChartAttack | date = 2003-05-27 | accessdate = ~~~~~}}
<!-- NOTE: [Otheus] "urban" *usually* refers to Black, but not necessarily... It IS an all-urban show. It is NOT always at Lee's Palace-->
</ref> Her performance attracted the attention of [[The Philosopher Kings]] singer [[Gerald Eaton]] (aka Jarvis Church), who then approached her to write with him. He and fellow Kings member, [[Brian West]], helped Furtado produce a [[Demo (music)|demo]]. She left Toronto, but returned again to record more material with Eaton and West. The material recorded during these sessions led to her 1999 record deal with [[DreamWorks Records]].<ref name=mm/> Furtado's first single, "[[Party's Just Begun (Again)]]", was released that year on the ''[[Brokedown Palace: Music from the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]''.

===2000&ndash;2002: ''Whoa, Nelly!'' and early success===
[[Image:Whoanelly.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Whoa, Nelly!]]'' (2000)]]
Furtado continued the collaboration with Eaton and West, who co-produced her debut album, ''[[Whoa, Nelly!]]'', released in October 2000.  Following the release of the album, Furtado headlined the ''Burn in the Spotlight'' tour and also appeared on [[Moby]]'s ''[[Area Festival|Area:One]]'' tour. 

The album was an international success, supported by three international singles, "[[I'm like a Bird]]", "[[Turn off the Light]]", and "[[...On the Radio (Remember the Days)]]".  It received four [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations in 2002, and her debut single won for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].
Furtado's work was also critically acclaimed for her innovative mixture of various genres and sounds. ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'' magazine called the album "a delightful and refreshing antidote to the army of 'pop princesses' and rap-metal bands that had taken over popular music at the turn of the millennium."<ref name=slant74>

===2003&ndash;2005: ''Folklore''===
[[Image:Nelly Furtado Folklore.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Folklore (album)|Folklore]]'' (2003)]]
Furtado's second album, ''[[Folklore (album)|Folklore]]'', was released in November 2003. The title was influenced by her parents' immigration to Canada.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}  ''Folclore'' [fOlk'lOrI] means the same in Portuguese as it does in English, but occurs much more frequently, in any reference to traditional culture. The final track on the album, "Childhood Dreams", was dedicated to her daughter. The album includes the single "[[Força]]" (meaning "strength" or "carry on" in Portuguese), the official anthem of the [[2004 European Football Championship]].  Furtado performed this song in [[Lisbon]] at the championship's final, in which the Portugal national team played.<ref name=rs35794>

The album was not as successful as her debut, partly due to the album's less "poppy" sound<ref name=folklore>
{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/urban/reviews/furtado_folklore.shtml|title=Folklore|work=BBC|accessdate=28 May|accessyear=2006}}
</ref> but also due to changes at DreamWorks Records. DreamWorks had just been sold to [[Universal Music Group]]. In 2005, DreamWorks Records, along with many of its artists including Furtado, were absorbed into [[Geffen Records]].<ref name=blogcritics-20031112>

===2006&ndash;Present: ''Loose''===
[[Image:Loose cover.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Loose (album)|Loose]]'' (2006)]]
Furtado's third album was released in June 2006. She named it ''[[Loose (album)|Loose]]'' after the spontaneous, creative decisions she made while creating the album.<ref name=rsfeb06>

</ref> Four lead singles were released in different regions of the world: the Spanish [[reggaeton]]-influenced "[[No Hay Igual]]" (featuring [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]]), the hip-hop "[[Promiscuous (song)|Promiscuous]]" (featuring [[Timbaland]]), for which she won a 2006 [[Billboard Music Award]] for Pop Single of the Year, the [[Latin American music|Latin]] "[[Te Busqué]]" (featuring [[Juanes]]), and the dark pop single "[[Maneater (Nelly Furtado song)|Maneater]]". In this album, primarily produced by [[Timbaland]], Furtado experiments with sounds from R&B, hip hop, and 80s music.<ref name=umusic> {{cite web |url=http://umusic.ca/nellyfurtado/|title=  Nelly Furtado :: Loose |work=umusic.ca|accessdate=21 June|accessyear=2006}}</ref> She categorized the album's sound as ''punk-hop'', described as "modern, poppy, spooky" and as having "a mysterious, after-midnight vibe... extremely visceral".<ref name=rsfeb06/> She attributed the youthful sound of the album to the presence of her two-year old daughter.<ref name=umusic/> ''Loose'' has become the most successful album of Furtado's career so far. It reached number-one in several countries including the United States and Canada, and it included the hit singles "<!-- please do not link - it is linked in the paragraph above -->Promiscuous", "<!-- please do not link - it is linked in the paragraph above -->Maneater", "[[Te Busqué]]", "[[Say It Right]]", and "[[All Good Things (Come to an End)]]".

</ref> This song became her third number-one single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, after "Promiscuous" and "Say It Right". In late November 2006, Furtado revealed that she once turned down [[U.S. dollar|US $]]500,000 to pose nude in ''[[Playboy]]''.<ref name=Spanish>
{{cite web |url=http://www.dose.ca/music/story.html?id=a2a15933-27c3-4bb0-ba34-945f917a93f2&k=44074|title=Nelly Embraces Her Roots with Spanish album|work=Dose | accessdate=6 January|accessyear=2007}}</ref> On [[February 16]], [[2007]], Furtado embarked on the [[Get Loose Tour]]. She returned in March 2007 to her hometown of Victoria, British Columbia to perform a concert at the Save-On Foods Memorial Centre. In honor of her visit, local leaders officially proclaimed [[March 21]], [[2007]], the first day of spring, as Nelly Furtado Day.<ref name=victoriapress>{{ cite web | url = http://www.victoria.ca/contentmanager/press/070312_pr.pdf | title = City of Victoria Press Release}}</ref> On [[April 1]], [[2007]] Furtado was a performer at and host of the 2007 [[Juno Awards]] in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. She won all five awards for which she was nominated, including "Album of the Year" and "Single of the Year".

Furtado announced in December 2006 that she would record an all-Spanish album. During an interview with a member of the Canadian press, she mentioned that her Latin album had been shelved; though she said she still hoped to release a full-length, Spanish-language project one day, her plan was to re-release ''Loose'' in the United States (and possibly Latin America) with Spanish versions of "All Good Things (Come to an End)", "Try", and "[[In God's Hands (song)|In God's Hands]]", all of which she wrote and recorded with Julio Reyes. With the postponing of Furtado's Spanish Language album, rumors state that a song titled "Crowd Control" featuring Justin Timberlake will be Furtado's lead single for a new English language studio record due out in late 2007.  Another track, "Stars" which Furtado wanted to include on a re-release of [[Loose]], has premiered on her myspace page and personal website, perhaps to be included on the upcoming record as well.

==Sexuality==
In June 2006, in an interview with ''[[Genre (magazine)|Genre]]'' magazine, when asked if she had "ever felt an attraction to women", Furtado replied "Absolutely. Women are beautiful and sexy." She also said the idea that everyone was inherently bisexual made sense to her and agreed with [[Kurt Cobain]]'s statement that "everyone is gay" from [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "[[All Apologies]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genremagazine.com/2006/6-1/magazine/content/nelly.cfm|title=Nelly on the Loose! |work=Genre|accessdate=26 July|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Some considered this an announcement of [[bisexuality]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afterellen.com/column/2006/7/21.html|title=Best. Lesbian. Week. Ever. |work=AfterEllen|accessdate=26 July|accessyear=2006}}</ref> but in August 2006, she confirmed that she was "straight, but very open-minded".  She commented that she was slightly embarrassed by the quotes and stated, "I guess I was humouring the journalist a little and I was reading a book about Chinese medicine, and we went off on a tangent."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3760561a1860,00.html|title=Furtado red-faced over loose tongue|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=11 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Influences==
During her teenage years, Furtado embraced many musical genres, listening heavily to mainstream [[contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[alternative rock]], [[New Wave music|New Wave]], [[alternative hip hop]], [[trip hop]], [[world music]] (including [[Music of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[fado]], [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian]] [[bossa nova]], and [[Music of India|Indian music]]), and a variety of others.<ref name=ym/> Her influences have included [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Oasis]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Esthero]], [[Amalia Rodrigues]], [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], [[Cornershop]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Digable Planets]], [[De La Soul]], [[Radiohead]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[The Verve]], [[U2]], [[Enya]] and [[Beck]].<ref name=ym/><ref name=mm/>

Furtado's music has also been influenced by her current residence, [[Toronto]], which she calls "the most multicultural city in the entire world" and a place where she "can be any culture".{{citequote}}

=== Toronto and experiencing musical diversity ===
Regarding Toronto's cultural diversity, she has said that she did not have to wait for the [[Internet]] revolution to learn about world music; she began listening to it at the age of 5 and continues to discover new genres. 

{{cquote|I always know there's a new genre left to discover. For me, it's like a metaphor for life. I feel like if you can get down with any style of music, you can get down with any style of person. So it's fun for me—I get to expose my fans to different vibes and they, in turn, open their minds too. I'm always undergoing mind-opening.<ref name=rsjun06/>}}

==Acting career==
Furtado began acting in school plays in [[middle school]]. She appeared on the episode "Some Buried Bones" of ''[[CSI: NY]]'' as Ava Brandt, a master-thief and victim of domestic abuse. She also guest starred on an episode of the day time soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]'', on which she performed some of her songs in a local club with [[Saukrates]].  Furtado participated in the hit Portuguese soap opera ''[[Floribella]]'', a remake of the Argentinean show ''[[Floricienta]]''.
