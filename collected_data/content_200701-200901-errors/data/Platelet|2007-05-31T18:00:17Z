'''Platelets''' or '''thrombocytes''' are the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] fragments circulating in the [[blood]] that are involved in the cellular mechanisms of primary [[hemostasis]] leading to the formation of [[thrombus|blood clot]]s. Dysfunction or low levels of platelets  predisposes to [[hemorrhage|bleeding]], while high levels, although usually asymptomatic, may increase the risk of [[thrombosis]].

==Anatomy==
Like [[red blood cells]], platelets are anuclear (no [[cell nucleus]]) and discoid ([[disc]] shaped); they measure 1.5–3.0 [[micrometre|μm]] in diameter. The body has a very limited reserve of platelets, so they can be rapidly depleted. They contain [[RNA]], [[mitochondria]], a [[canaliculus|canalicular]] system, and several different types of granules; [[lysosomes]] (containing [[acid hydrolases]]), [[dense bodies]] (containing [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] [[serotonin]] and [[calcium]]) and [[alpha granules]] (containing [[fibrinogen]], [[factor V]], [[vitronectin]], [[thrombospondin]] and [[von Willebrand factor]]), the contents of which are released upon activation of the platelet.

===Function===
Platelets are [[#Activators|activated]] when brought into contact with [[collagen]] (which is exposed when the [[endothelium|endothelial]] blood vessel lining is damaged), [[thrombin]] (primarily through [[Protease-activated receptor|PAR]]-1), [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], receptors expressed on [[white blood cells]] or the endothelial cells of the blood vessels, a negatively charged surface (e.g., glass), or several other activating factors. Once activated, they release a number of different [[coagulation factor]]s and platelet activating factors.
Platelet activation further results in the [[scramblase]]-mediated transport of negatively charged phospholipids to the platelet surface. These phospholipids provide a catalytic surface (with the charge provided by [[phosphatidylserine]] and [[phosphatidylethanolamine]]) for the [[tenase]] and [[prothrombinase]] complexes.
The platelets adhere to each other via adhesion receptors or [[integrin]]s, and to the endothelial cells in the wall of the blood vessel forming a haemostatic plug in conjunction with [[fibrin]]. The high concentration of [[myosin]] and [[actin]] filaments in platelets are stimulated to contract during aggregation, further reinforcing the plug.
The most abundant platelet adhesion receptor is [[glycoprotein]] (GP) IIb/IIIa; this is a calcium-dependent receptor for fibrinogen, [[fibronectin]], vitronectin, thrombospondin and von Willebrand factor (vWF). Other receptors include GPIb-V-IX complex (vWF) and GPVI ([[collagen]]).
Besides being the chief cellular effector of [[hemostasis]], platelets are rapidly deployed to sites of injury or infection and potentially modulate inflammatory processes by interacting with [[leukocytes]] and by secreting [[cytokines]], [[chemokines]] and other inflammatory mediators<ref>{{cite journal | author=Weyrich A.S.

==Role in disease==
===High and low counts===
A normal platelet count in a healthy person is between 150,000 and 400,000 per mm³ of blood (150&ndash;400 x 10<sup>9</sup>/[[litre|L]]). 95% of healthy people will have platelet counts in this range. Some will have statistically abnormal platelet counts while having no abnormality, although the likelihood increases if the platelet count is either very low or very high.

Both [[thrombocytopenia]] (or thrombopenia) and [[thrombocytosis]] may present with coagulation problems. Generally, low platelet counts increase bleeding risks (although there are exceptions, e.g. immune [[heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]]) and [[thrombocytosis]] (high counts) may lead to thrombosis (although this is mainly when the elevated count is due to myeloproliferative disorder).

Low platelet counts are generally not corrected by transfusion unless the patient is bleeding or the count has fallen below 5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L; it is contraindicated in thrombotic thrombocopenic purpura (TTP) as it fuels the coagulopathy. In patients having surgery, a level below 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) is associated with abnormal surgical bleeding, and regional anaesthetic procedures such as [[epidural]]s are avoided for levels below 80-100.

Normal platelet counts are not a guarantee of adequate function. In some states the platelets, while being adequate in number, are ''dysfunctional''. For instance, [[aspirin]] irreversibly disrupts platelet function by inhibiting [[cyclooxygenase]]-1 (COX1), and hence normal hemostasis; normal platelet function may not return until the aspirin has ceased and all the affected platelets have been replaced by new ones, which can take over a week. Similarly, [[uremia]] (a consequence of [[renal failure]]) leads to platelet dysfunction that may be ameliorated by the administration of [[desmopressin]].

==Discovery==
Brewer<ref name=Brewer>Brewer DB. Max Schultze (1865), G. Bizzozero (1882) and the discovery of the platelet. ''Br J Haematol'' 2006;133:251-8. PMID 16643426.</ref> traced the history of the discovery of the platelet. Although red blood cells had been known since [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek|van Leeuwenhoek]], it was the German anatomist [[Max Johann Sigismund Schultze|Max Schultze]] (1825-1874) who first offered a description of the platelet in his newly founded journal ''Archiv für mikroscopische Anatomie''<ref name=Schultze>Schultze M. Ein heizbarer Objecttisch und seine Verwendung bei Untersuchungen des Blutes. ''Arch Mikrosc Anat'' 1865;1:1-42.</ref>. He describes "spherules" much smaller than red blood cells that are occasionally clumped and may participate in collections of [[fibrin|fibrous material]]. He recommends further study of the findings.

[[Giulio Bizzozero]] (1846-1901), building on Schultze's findings, used "living circulation" to study blood cells of amphibians microscopically ''[[in vivo]]''. One of his findings was the fact that platelets clump at the site of blood vessel injury, which precedes the formation of a [[thrombus|blood clot]]. This observation confirmed the role of platelets in [[coagulation]]<ref name=Bizzozero>Bizzozero J. Über einen neuen Forrnbestandteil des Blutes und dessen Rolle bei der Thrombose und Blutgerinnung. ''Arch Pathol Anat Phys Klin Med'' 1882;90:261-332.</ref>.
