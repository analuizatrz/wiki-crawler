The '''New England Patriots''', nicknamed the "'''Pats'''" by sports writers and fans,<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=nwe ESPN.com] An example of the "Pats" nickname being used within sports reports. Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]]. They currently belong to the [[AFC East|Eastern Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The team's ownership changed the name, originally the '''Boston Patriots''', after [[relocation of professional sports teams|relocating the team]] to Foxborough in [[1971 in sports|1971]].

An original member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), the Patriots joined the NFL in [[AFL-NFL Merger|the league merger of 1970]]. The team advanced to the playoffs four times before appearing in [[Super Bowl XX]] in January [[1986 in sports|1986]]. This Super Bowl appearance resulted in a loss to the [[Chicago Bears]]. The team also appeared in, and lost [[Super Bowl XXXI]] in [[1997 in sports|1997]], to the [[Green Bay Packers]]. 

Between [[2001 in sports|2001]] and [[2004 in sports|2004]], the Patriots became the second team in NFL history (after the [[Dallas Cowboys]]) to win three Super Bowls in four years ([[Super Bowl XXXVI]], [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|XXXVIII]], and [[Super Bowl XXXIX|XXXIX]]), and the eighth (and to date, the last) time a team has won consecutive Super Bowls.  Their dominance in the early part of the decade has some dubbing them as the modern NFL [[dynasty (sports)|championship dynasty]].

===The AFL Years===
[[November 16]] [[1959 in sports|1959]], Boston executive [[William Sullivan|William H. "Billy" Sullivan Jr.]] was awarded the eighth and final [[sports franchising|franchise]] of the developing [[American Football League]] (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name. The most popular choice—and the one that Sullivan selected—was '''"Boston Patriots"''', which derived from the historical [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] of the [[American Revolution]]. Several months later, Phil Bisell created the "Pat Patriot" logo (see [[#Logo and uniforms|section]]), and [[Lou Saban]] was selected as the team's first head coach.

The franchise's first training camp began on [[July 4]] [[1960 in sports|1960]], two months before their first official game against the [[Bills]].<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac=History Patriots History] Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> On [[September 9]] of that year, the Boston Patriots played the [[Denver Broncos]] in the first-ever AFL regular season game. The Broncos defeated the Patriots by a score of 13–10. The franchise played first at legendary Braves Field in Boston, the old home of the Boston Braves that was eventually purchased by Boston University, where it was renamed Nickerson Field.  From [[1961 in sports|1961]] to [[1969 in sports|1969]], the Patriots played at Fenway Park, the home of the Boston Red Sox.  5,000 temporary seats covered the left field wall, and field goals were regularly kicked into the right field visitors' bullpen.  The Patriots failed to reach the playoffs in each of their first three seasons, despite posting a cumulative 23-17 record. However, in [[1963 in sports|1963]] the Patriots reached the [[AFL Championship]] for the first time, resulting in a loss to the [[San Diego Chargers]] by a score of 51–10. Although the franchise lost the championship, it was honored when eleven Patriots made the AFL All-star team, including [[Gino Cappelletti]], [[Nick Buoniconti]], Jim Lee Hunt, Houston Antwine, Bob Dee, and Babe Parilli.

Although Boston failed to reach the AFL playoffs for the remainder of the decade, the team was noted in [[1966 in sports|1966]] when fullback [[Jim Nance]] gained 1,458 yards, and the title of the American Football League's MVP.<ref>[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/NancJi00.htm/ Jim Nance statistics] Accessed 25 January 2006.</ref><ref>[http://football.about.com/od/nflhistory/l/bl_awardsmvp.htm NFL MVP player of the year] Accessed 25 January 2006.</ref> [[Tom Addison]], the first Patriot All-star, founded the [[AFL Players Association]] in the mid 1960s.

===1970-1991===
The Patriots' second decade began with significant changes. In [[1970 in sports|1970]], the Patriots' franchise joined the NFL pursuant to the merger of the AFL and NFL that had been agreed to three years earlier. The Patriots were merged into the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC), where they remain to the present day. However, the Patriots' first season as part of the NFL resulted in a record of 2–12, sole possession of the newly merged league's worst record. Despite the lack of wins, local morale increased in [[1971 in sports|1971]] when the Patriots moved into a new stadium in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts|Foxborough]] (also known as Foxboro). The stadium, to be known as [[Schaefer Stadium]], became Sullivan Stadium in [[1983 in sports|1983]] and, ultimately, [[Foxboro Stadium]] in [[1990 in sports|1990]]. This marked stability for the Patriots, who shifted between four different Boston-area stadiums since its creation.  In March [[1971 in sports|1971]], the team was renamed the '''"Bay State Patriots"''' and later that year the '''"New England Patriots"''' to reflect the relocation.

By the early 1970s, several new players were added to the lineup, including [[Heisman Trophy]]<ref>[http://www.nationalchamps.net/NCAA/heisman/heisman_trophy_winners.htm Heisman trophy winners] Accessed 25 January 2006.</ref> winner [[Jim Plunkett]]<ref>[http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/draft/1971.jsp 1971 NFL draft] Accessed 25 January 2006.</ref> and offensive lineman [[John Hannah (NFL player)|John Hannah]], who became the first career Patriot to make the Hall of Fame in 1991.<ref>[http://www.collegefootballnews.com/Top_100_Players/Top_100_Players_13_John_Hannah.htm Top 100 Players: 13 - John Hannah]. Information on John Hannah's career, including a list of awards, which features the 1991 NFL Hall of Fame induction. Accessed 29 January 2006.</ref>Despite the changes in personnel, the Patriots' series of losing seasons continued into the early 1970s. [[Chuck Fairbanks]] was hired as head coach and [[general manager]] in [[1973  in sports|1973]] after leading a top-ten program at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. Fairbanks began assembling one of the most talented - but ultimately underachieveing - squads in the NFL of the 1970s. The Patriots finished 7–7 in 1974 and 3–11 in [[1975 in sports|1975]], which resulted in offensive changes. Plunkett was traded to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and replaced by second year player [[Steve Grogan]]. 

After the string of losing seasons, the Patriots finished the [[1976 in sports|1976]] season with an 11–3 mark &mdash; the best record in team history to that point &mdash; and a playoff slot for the first time since [[1963 in sports|1963]]. In the first round of the [[1976 in sports|1976]] playoffs, the Patriots lost to the [[Oakland Raiders]] 24–21. In [[1978 in sports|1978]], Fairbanks was fired as head coach when it was revealed he had been secretly hired as the new head coach of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. Fairbanks was replaced by [[Ron Erhardt]], who coached the team to a playoff appearance later that year. The Patriots lost to the [[Houston Oilers]] in the first round and did not return to the tournament until [[1982 in sports|1982]]. Under new coach [[Ron Meyer]], the Patriots were once again eliminated in the first game &mdash; this time by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. With the team unable to assemble playoff victories, the Sullivans replaced head coach Ron Meyer with former wide receiver [[Raymond Berry]] in [[1984 in sports|1984]].

In the [[1985 in sports|1985]] regular season, the team finished with an 11-5 record and obtained a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] playoff berth. The Patriots won three road playoff games on their way to [[Super Bowl XX]] &mdash; an NFL record.<ref>[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe1985.htm 1985 New England Patriots Statistics]. Features information on the Patriots' wins during the 1985 season and playoffs. Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> At Super Bowl XX, the Patriots surrendered a 3-0 first quarter lead and lost to the [[Chicago Bears]] by a score of 46-10. The following season, New England won the AFC East with another 11–5 record, but fell to the Broncos in the first round of the playoffs. Local resident [[Doug Flutie]] was a member of the Patriots during the 1987–1988 seasons, in which they finished with records of 8–7 and 9–7, respectively. Berry remained head coach through both seasons.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Patriots' lack of playoff appearances was underscored by personnel changes and controversy within the Sullivan ownership.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158261525X Book discussing various aspects of the Patriots sports franchise] Website accessed January 31, 2006.</ref> The Sullivan family lost millions of dollars on expensive investments, including [[The Jacksons]]' 1984 Victory tour. Additional pressure was placed on the ownership when they calculated that $100 million was already invested in the franchise.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0D6163FF93AA15753C1A96E948260 Patriots Change Hands]. Associated Press article, published on [[October 29]], [[1988]]. Website accessed February 1, 2006.</ref> These financial losses and demands forced the Sullivans to sell the team.  In 1986, Francis W. Murray arranged financing to keep the team afloat and, in return, was granted an option to purchase the team.  When Murray tried to exercise his option, the Sullivans refused to acknowledge his rights and Murray sued and won in court.  As a result, Murray agreed to partner with [[Victor Kiam]] to purchase the team in 1988.  Kiam and Murray purchased the team for $84 million &mdash; $16 million less than the cost of the team.<ref>[http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/nengalnd/patriots.html Sports Encyclopedia]. Kiam owned 51% and Murray 49%. Information relating to Kiam's purchasing of the Patriots in the late 1980s. Accessed January 31, 2006.</ref> Although Kiam was now the majority owner, he decided to keep Billy Sullivan and his son, [[Pat Sullivan]], as franchise president and General Manager respectively.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0D6163FF93AA15753C1A96E948260 Patriots Change Hands]. Associated Press article, published on [[October 29]], [[1988]]. Website accessed February 1, 2006.</ref> Meanwhile, entrepreneur [[Robert Kraft]] began his involvement with the Patriots by purchasing Sullivan Stadium (previously Schaefer Stadium) on [[November 23]] [[1988]]. Essentially, Kraft owned the stadium and Kiam possessed the team.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac=History Patriots History]. Information relating to Kraft purchasing Sullivan Stadium and renaming it Foxboro stadium. Accessed January 31, 2006.</ref> During this leadership change, head coach Berry was replaced by [[Rod Rust]] &mdash; a change that was short-lived.

The Patriots' worst season in franchise history &mdash; a 1-15 record &mdash; came under Rust in [[1990 in sports|1990]]. During the season, the Patriots were thrown into the middle of a sexual harassment scandal when ''[[Boston Herald]]'' reporter [[Lisa Olson]] was sexually and verbally assaulted by several Patriots players in the team's locker room &mdash; a bad situation made worse by Kiam first deriding the reporter as "a classic [expletive]" and by making lewd jokes at public events about the whole affair instead of allowing it to die quietly. Following an investigation into the scandal, NFL Commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] fined the team $50,000, and players [[Zeke Mowatt]], [[Michael Timpson]] and [[Robert Perryman]] $12,500, $5,000, and $5,000 respectively. Rust was fired and replaced by [[Dick MacPherson]] at the end of the season. The Olson scandal and the 1-15 record are cited as the two primary reasons why Rod Rust was told to leave.<ref>[http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/nengalnd/patriots.html Lisa Olsen sexual harassment scandal] Accessed 31 January 2006.</ref>

===1992–1997===

In [[1992 in sports|1992]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] businessman [[James Orthwein]] became sole owner of the Patriots franchise, sparking rumors of a possible franchise relocation to St. Louis. However, no move was scheduled for the [[1992 in sports|1992]] season, despite a sub-par [[1992 in sports|1992]] season.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac=History Patriots History]. Orthwein takes over the franchise, which sparks controversy over a possible franchise relocation. Accessed 31 January 2006.</ref>  During the [[1992 in sports|1992]]-[[1993 in sports|1993]] offseason, the Patriots shifted gears by replacing MacPherson with [[Bill Parcells]]. The team's draft selections for the offseason included [[Drew Bledsoe]], who quarterbacked the team until [[2001 in sports|2001]]. Despite these acquisitions, the [[1993 in sports|1993]] season resulted in a losing record, and rumors about relocation to St. Louis resparked during the offseason. In order to save the team from relocation, [[Robert Kraft]] outbid an intense field of competition and obtained full ownership of the Patriots in 1994.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac=History Patriots History]. Kraft takes over in 1994, saving the team from a move. Accessed 31 January 2006.</ref> Kraft implemented changes in organization and leadership, which culminated in a ten-season stadium sell-out streak from [[1996 in sports|1996]] to the present.

New England entered the [[1994 in sports|1994]] season after drafting first round and fourth overall pick on defensive end [[Willie McGinest]], who would later play [[linebacker]] on all three Super Bowl-winning teams. Although the team lost in the first round of the [[1994 in sports|1994]] playoffs and finished the [[1995 in sports|1995]] season with a 6–10 record, Kraft decided to keep Parcells. In [[1996 in sports|1996]], the Patriots finished with an 11–5 record and an AFC East division championship. The team eventually advanced to [[Super Bowl XXXI]], where they lost to the [[Green Bay Packers]] 35–21. Parcells would leave to coach the [[New York Jets]].

=== 1997-2000===

Due to rising tensions between Parcells and Kraft, Parcells resigned, and was replaced by [[Pete Carroll]] in [[1997 in sports|1997]]. Meanwhile, the Patriots and the [[New York Jets]] began switching players and coaches, including current Jets head coach [[Eric Mangini]], the aforementioned Parcells, and running back [[Curtis Martin]]. Nevertheless, New England finished [[1997 in sports|1997]] with a 10–6 record and first place in the AFC East. The Patriots defeated the [[Miami Dolphins]] 17–3 at home in the opening round, before losing against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] by a score of 7–6. In the [[1998 in sports|1998]] season, the Patriots finished 9–7, and lost to the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] in the first round of the playoffs. A subpar [[1999 in sports|1999]] season resulted in Carroll's firing.

===2000-present===

After Carroll was fired, [[Bill Belichick]], hand-picked to be Parcells' successor with the Jets, quit after one day as Jets head coach to join New England.<ref>[http://cbs4boston.com/topstories/local_story_017070058.html CBS4 Boston]. Story on Eric Mangini with historical information about Belichick's one-day head coaching run with the Jets. Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> In [[2000 in sports|2000]], Belichick's first season resulted in a 5–11 record. In [[2001 in sports|2001]], quarterback [[Drew Bledsoe]] was injured in the second game of the season on a hit by Jets linebacker [[Mo Lewis]], and was replaced by [[Tom Brady]], a sixth-round draft pick, who then led the team into the playoffs with an 11–5 record (and, in the process, creating a media controversy over who should be the starter after Bledsoe recovered). The Patriots defeated the Oakland Raiders, in the so-called "[[The Tuck (NFL game)|Tuck Rule]]" game played in a drivng snowstorm in Foxborough, followed by defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game.  That set up their third trip to New Orleans and [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], where, amidst a theme of patriotism spawned by the September 11 terror attacks, they defeated the [[St. Louis Rams]] on a last-second field goal by [[Adam Vinatieri]]. In New England's first Super Bowl victory, Brady drove his team 48 yards in 1:21 with no timeouts, and was selected [[Super Bowl MVP]]. Bledsoe was traded to the [[Buffalo Bills]] in the [[2002 in sports|2002]] off-season.

In [[2002 in sports|2002]], Robert Kraft opened the new [[Gillette Stadium]] after privately funding its construction. After getting no support from the [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] to build a new stadium, Kraft made a deal to move the team to Hartford, Connecticut in [[1998 in sports|1998]].<ref>[http://www.ct.gov/governorrowland/cwp/view.asp?A=1331&Q=256172 CT.gov] Story on Kraft moving the team to Hartford. Accessed 18 April 2006.</ref> However, environmental cleanup problems with the Hartford site, combined with Massachusetts' eventual willingness to loan $57,000,000 in infrastructure costs around Foxboro to be repaid through parking revenue led to a reversal of the Hartford deal.  As a result of threats of lawsuits by Connecticut Governor John Rowland, Kraft paid $2.4M to Connecticut to avoid any future litigation.<ref>[http://www.sportslawnews.com/archive/articles%201999/Patriots1.html Sportslawnews.com] Information on the reversal of the Hartford deal.

The Patriots missed the [[2002 in sports|2002]] playoffs after finishing with a record of 9–7 and missing out on the division title via a tiebreaker to the New York Jets. In [[2003 in sports|2003]], the Patriots started 2–2 but finished with a 14–2 record and fourteen straight wins on their way to [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] against the [[Carolina Panthers]]. The Patriots won by a score of 32–29; the final three points came from another Adam Vinatieri field goal. Brady was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time in his career.

[[Image:BostonCityhall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Patriot fans rally in front of Boston City Hall following the 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII championship]]
In [[2004 in sports|2004]], the Patriots broke the NFL all-time regular season consecutive winning streak record of 18 straight wins, with a victory against the Miami Dolphins. Later in the season, the Patriots lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, which halted their winning streak at 21 games.<ref>[http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.jsp?release_id=1306 NFL's Longest Winning Streaks]. From the Pro Football Hall of Fame website. Information on the winning streak being stopped by the Steelers at 21 wins. Accessed 28 January 2006.</ref> However, the NFL only counts regular-season wins in determining the consecutive wins record, so the Patriots' streak officially stands at 18 games.

After finishing the [[2004 in sports|2004]] season with a 14-2 record, the Patriots defeated the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and Pittsburgh Steelers en route to [[Super Bowl XXXIX]]. The Patriots went on to defeat the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] by a score of 24–21. The victory made the Patriots the first team in six years (and the [[List of Super Bowl champions|eighth]] time in history) to repeat as NFL Super Bowl champions, and the second team ever to win three Super Bowls in four years (next to the [[Dallas Cowboys]]). It was the city of [[Boston]]s second victory parade ([[Red Sox]] [[2004 World Series|World Series]] parade) in five months. 

After the [[2004 in sports|2004]] season, Belichick's top two coordinators &mdash; [[Charlie Weis]] and [[Romeo Crennel]] &mdash; left the team to pursue head coaching positions. Significant players moved on as well, including longtime Patriot cornerback [[Ty Law]]. Linebacker [[Tedy Bruschi]] missed half of the [[2005 in sports|2005]] season while recovering from a mild stroke.<ref>[http://www.hbo.com/infl/columns/articles/kalb/20051017kalb.shtml Return of Tedy Bruschi] HBO column. Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> During the [[2005 in sports|2005]] season, the team lost several starters to injuries, including safety [[Rodney Harrison]] and offensive tackle [[Matt Light]]. In the final game of the season, Doug Flutie performed the first successful dropkick extra point since [[1941 in sports|1941]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2277308 Patriots' Flutie converts first drop kick since 1941]. ESPN column. Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> At the end of the season, the Patriots won the AFC East with a 10–6 record. The Patriots defeated the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] 28–3 in the first round of the playoffs before losing to the Broncos 27–13. New England became the seventh team in NFL history to fail on a chance to win the Super Bowl in three consecutive seasons, the last team to do so being the Broncos.

The [[2006 in sports|2006]] off-season saw the departure and arrival of several personnel. [[Dean Pees]] took over as defensive coordinator when [[Eric Mangini]] left the team to become head coach of the New York Jets.<ref>[http://patriots.bostonherald.com/patriots/view.bg?articleid=121997 Add Vince to Dean's List] Boston Herald newspaper article. Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> Quarterbacks coach [[Josh McDaniels]] was promoted to offensive coordinator after New England went one season without replacing Charlie Weis.<ref>[http://patriots.bostonherald.com/patriots/view.bg?articleid=122320 Pats coordinate efforts] Boston Herald newspaper article. Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> Notable Patriot players [[David Givens]], Willie McGinest, and Adam Vinatieri left New England for the [[Tennessee Titans]], [[Cleveland Browns]], and Indianapolis Colts respectively. [[Deion Branch]] would later be traded to the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Despite this, they finished the 2006 regular season with a 12-4 record and won the AFC East for the fourth consecutive time.  The Patriots went on to defeat their rival, the Jets 37-16 in the wild card round. The following game, Brady, despite throwing 3 INTs, engineered a 4th quarter comeback to defeat the San Diego Chargers by the score of 24-21. They played the Colts in the Conference Championship but lost 38-34 after leading 21-3 early in the game, to date the largest collapse in NFL conference championship history.

The Kraft years have provided a major turnaround for the fan base of the Patriots. Before Kraft's arrival, the Patriots rarely played at Foxboro Stadium's maximum capacity (with the only exception being the highly successful [[1986 in sports|1986]] season). The attendance was particularly low during the early 1990s, when poor performance and the aforementioned rumors of franchise relocation to St. Louis loomed; the average home attendance was below 60% of maximum capacity. However, the improvements made during Bill Parcells' coaching tenure (both on and off the field) resulted in a rejuvenation of the fan base. From the [[1996 in sports|1996]] season onward, every Patriots home game has sold out, both at Foxboro and Gillette stadiums, including preseason games.<ref>[http://www.kenn.com/sports/football/nfl/nfl_nep_attendance.html Attendance information from 1980-] Accessed 1 February 2006</ref><ref>[http://slam.canoe.ca/StatsFBP/BC-FBP-STAT-NEWENGLANDATTCOMP-R.html Specific information on 2003- Sell-out streak] Accessed 1 February 2006</ref>

Accessed 28 January 2006.</ref>

In [[1979 in sports|1979]], the Patriots enhanced the [[American flag]] color arrangement by introducing red pants worn with the white and blue jerseys &mdash; a design that was used for home games.  The pant design was reverted for the [[1982 in sports|1982]] and [[1983 in sports|1983]] seasons.  In [[1984 in sports|1984]], the Patriots introduced red jerseys and white pants, but in the 1985 season the team wore the white jerseys during all home games.  However, in [[Super Bowl XX]], the Patriots opted to wear their red jerseys as the designated home team against the [[Chicago Bears]] after road playoff victories over the [[New York Jets]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] wearing the red jerseys, though they lost resoundingly, 46-10.

In [[1993 in sports|1993]], changes to the Patriots' uniforms and logo were rolled out by owner James B. Orthwein and [[NFL Properties]].<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac=History Patriots History]. Changes. Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> Apparently, due to the original 1960s-vintage "Pat the Patriot" logo being the most ornate and graphically detailed logo to be used anywhere in North American professional sports up to that time, with the associated greater expense with its replication for use, it was replaced with the silhouette of a Patriot's head wearing a red-white-and-blue tricorne hat &mdash; a symbol that was nicknamed the "Flying [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]" by fans,<ref>  [http://nflhistory.net/shared/owners.asp?Team=3 NFLHistory.net] Information on the Patriots' ownership, including the start of the "Flying Elvis" logo. Accessed 26 January 2006.</ref> and was also jokingly compared to the logo of Colonial lunchmeats. The team's jerseys were changed from red to "Patriot" (dark) blue, and both the helmets and pants from white to silver.<ref>[http://nflhistory.net/shared/owners.asp?Team=3 NFLHistory.net] Color changes; one of the colors is called "Patriot" blue by this source. Accessed 28 January 2006.</ref>

In [[2000 in sports|2000]], the team introduced a darker shade of blue to the jerseys.<ref>[http://www.i-nflhelmet.com/newenglandpatriots.html i-NFL Helmet]. Mention of helmet and uniform changes in 2000. Accessed 30 January 2006.</ref> Blue pants were introduced with the white jerseys, and twice during the [[2002 in sports|2002]] season, the Patriots wore an all-blue combination.  In [[2003 in sports|2003]], the Patriots introduced a silver alternate jersey that is worn occasionally at home with the blue pants.<ref name='silver_shirts'>For example, see {{cite web

===Strategy===
The Patriots are commonly noted for their emphasis on teamwork over individuality.  For example, in Superbowl XXXVI, the Patriots rejected the individual introductions previously customary to the big game and instead entered the field as a collective group.  The Patriots are also known for their emphasis on a strong middle class of solid non-marquee players over a small number of highly paid superstars.  This has led to a number of high profile players, such as Ty Law and Deion Branch, leaving the team in order to seek greener, higher paying pastures elsewhere.  The idea behind the Patriots' approach is that in the current salary cap era, one cannot allow one's team to be to dependant on a handful of players who can be easily decimated by injury.  In addition, the team is also often recognized for its intelligent, hardworking, character driven and versatile players.  The coaching staff of the Patriots commonly ask their players to alter their formations in order to take advantages of perceived weaknesses in their opponents.  For example, in Superbowl XXXVI the Patriots surprised everyone by unveiling an unconventional bump and run defense featuring five or six defensive backs.  Troy Brown, a wide receiver, sometimes plays on the defensive side of the ball as a nickel cornerback, and Mike Vrabel, a linebacker occasionally plays on the offensive side as a wide receiver.  

The base Patriots defense is a [[American_football_strategy#3-4|3-4 defense]], which means that there are commonly three defensive linemen up front, four linebackers in the middle, and four defensive backs.  This formation is preferred by the Patriots as it offers the most versatility for linebackers to attack unexpectedly or to drop back into coverage.  The Dallas Cowboys, the Cleveland Browns, the Miami Dolphins, and the New York Jets are believed to run similar defensive systems.

This year, the Patriots are commonly employing a two tight end set on offense.  This means that there is often only one running back in the backfield with the quarterback.  In addition to the two wide receivers, the two tight ends also provide flexibility as they can either act as blockers or run short receiving routes.
