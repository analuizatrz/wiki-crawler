'''''Sinistar''''' is an [[arcade game]] released by [[Williams (gaming company)|Williams]] in [[1982]]. It belongs to a class of [[video games]] from the [[1980s]] called "[[twitch games]]". Other "twitch games" include ''[[Tempest (arcade game)|Tempest]]'', ''[[Defender (arcade game)|Defender]]'', and ''[[Robotron: 2084]]''.  Sinistar's voice was supplied by [[John Doremus]].

== Description ==
The player pilots a lone fighter ship through a quadrant of the galaxy, initially blasting away at drifting planetoids to "mine" Sinisite Crystals from them, which, when harvested, create Sinibombs.  Sinibombs are the only weapon capable of damaging Sinistar. The fighter's bomb bay can hold 20 Sinibombs.

The player creates Sinibombs by shooting at the drifting planetoids (which resemble [[clouds]]) and catching the crystals released. Each shot makes a planetoid shake, and if too many shots are fired at a planetoid at too fast of a firing rate, it will cause the planetoid to explode and no crystals will be released. At the same time, a planetoid must shake a certain amount to actually release any crystals. It normally takes between 3 to 6 shots (depending on the size of the planetoid) to release between 1 and 10 crystals. Additional crystals can also be obtained from the same planetoid, as long as the number of shots and firing rate do not cause it to explode.

At the same time that the player is trying to get crystals, the "worker" ships are also trying to take the crystals. They use these crystals to create Sinistar, the skeletal-looking Boss who is trying to destroy you. At the same time that all of this is going on, other ships (called "warrior ships") are trying to shoot the player's ship, and the warriors can also been seen shooting at planetoids to mine crystals when they aren't trying to attack the player or guard the Sinistar.

If the player's ship is destroyed before the Sinistar is formed, the game shows how far along the worker ships are in building the Sinistar. The workers must harvest 20 crystals before the Sinistar is completely formed. Once it is completely formed, a digitized voice says "Beware, I live". While he is trying to collide with the player's ship in order to eat it, he says further things. His seven sayings are  "Roar!", "Beware, I live!", "I am Sinistar!", "Run! Run! Run!", "Beware, coward!", "I hunger!" and "Run, coward!" If the Sinistar succeeds in colliding with the player's ship, the ship spins out of control and then the Sinistar eats the ship, which also causes the ship to explode.

A total of 13 Sinibombs are required to destroy a fully built Sinistar (12 Sinibombs for each piece plus one additional Sinibomb for the entire face). Each Sinibomb attempts to target and hit the Sinistar, but each Sinibomb can also be intercepted by a collision with a worker, warrior, warrior shot, or a planetoid. If the player's ship is shot by a warrior or eaten by the Sinistar, the status screen will show the number of Sinibombs remaining and the number of Sinistar pieces remaining.

There are four zones that repeat over and over again. You move from one zone to the next after you have defeated the Sinistar. These zones are Worker Zone, Warrior Zone, Planetoid Zone, and Void Zone. The first three zones have more workers, warriors and planetoids, respectively. The Void Zone is especially difficult because it has almost no planetoids. A partially destoyed Sinistar can also be rebuilt, starting with the Worker Zone and continuing for all subsequent zones.

== Difficulty ==
There are many things that made Sinistar difficult. First of all, there was the challenge of getting the Sinibombs. Often the player would be killed before Sinistar was even formed, or conversely, Sinistar would become live when the player had less than the 13 Sinibombs needed to kill Sinistar. Once Sinistar became active, it became almost impossible to get more Sinibombs since Sinistar moved much faster than the player could.

==255 Lives Bug==
''Sinistar'' contains a well-known [[computer bug|bug]] that grants the player many lives. It happens only if the player is down to one ship left. If, when the Sinistar is about to eat the player, a warrior ship shoots and kills the player, something strange happens. The warrior shot takes the player to zero lives and then Sinistar eating the player takes the lives down to minus one life. Minus one in [[8 bit]] [[two's complement]] notation is 11111111, or 255 if interpreted as an [[signedness|unsigned]] value. So when down to minus one lives, the game resets to 255 lives. 255 is the largest number allowed in the [[8 bit]] system.

==Legacy==
Because the game came out relatively close to the [[video game crash of 1983]], it became a somewhat hard game to find. It was really only the [[Internet]] that raised the game above cult status, so a sequel was not released until [[1999]]. It was called ''[[Sinistar: Unleashed]]'' and it was released for the [[Personal Computer|PC]]. For similar reasons, Sinistar also was not widely ported. It is available as part of ''[[Midway Arcade Treasures]]'', which was released for the [[Personal Computer|PC]], [[Xbox]], [[GameCube]] and [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] in [[2003]], and part of ''[[Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play]]'' for the PlayStation Portable, in late 2005.  

''Sinistar'' represented a number of firsts in game design. It was the first game to use [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] sound (in the sitdown version), with two independent front and back sound boards for this purpose. In addition, Sinistar was the first game to use digitized speech as successfully as it did. It was also the first to use the 49-way, custom-designed optical [[joystick]] that Williams had produced specifically for this game.

In July [[2000]], [[Midway Games|Midway]] licensed ''Sinistar'', along with other [[Williams Electronics]] games,  to [[Macromedia Shockwave]] for use in an online applet to demonstrate the power of the shockwave web content platform, entitled ''Shockwave Arcade Collection''. The conversion was created by [[Digital Eclipse]]. It is currently freely available to be played within the shockwave web applet.

Like most arcade games of the era, unofficial clones were made for home computers. One of the best was Peter Johnson's ''Deathstar'' for the [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]] which was published by [[Superior Software]] in [[1984]]. The quality of the clone is not too surprising as it was originally developed as an official port to be released by ''Atarisoft'' but they decided to abandon the BBC platform while a number of games were still in development. Atari also programmed a version for the [[Atari 2600]] console that was never officially offered for sale.

''Xenostar'', a public domain tribute to Sinistar, was created and released for the Amiga computer in [[1994]].

==Game Boy Advance==

Sinistar was released as part of [[Midway's Greatest Hits]] on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. However, many popular features were removed. Sinistar no longer has glowing eyes and his mouth no longer moves. Many of his phrases have been omitted, leaving just "I Am Sinistar!" at the opening, "I Hunger!" upon pressing start, "Run! Run! Run!" during the game, and "Beware! I live!" when the user receives a game over.

==Trivia==
The theme music to the game was sampled in 2005 on 'Grand Ol' Party Crash' by Cage featuring [[Jello Biafra]] and [[DJ Shadow]].

The game is featured in the music video for [[Sheena Easton]]'s "Almost Over You", where a 
[[Defender (arcade game)|Defender]] arcade game is thrown out of a second story window.

The sound bites "Beware, I live" and the roaring sound are used in the film [[We Are the Strange]] (directed by M dot Strange).

The line "Run, coward!" was named the fourth best game line ever in the January 2002 issue of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''.

In the animated television series "[[South Park]]", the town's video arcade is called the "Sinistarcade".

In the game Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, the neutral hero Firelord's birth sound is him saying "Beware, I live"

In [[Reality 2.0]], one of the C.O.P.S. computers is an arcade machine referencing Sinistar, including his catchphrase "I hunger!"

A sample from Sinistar, "Beware coward!", is used throughout the [[Buckethead]] song 'Revenge of the Double Man'.

In [[World of Warcraft]], the Reliquary of Souls raid boss shouts, "Beware -  I live!" when engaged. This boss strongly resembles the Sinistar. [http://www.wowwiki.com/Reliquary_of_Souls]

The quote, "Beware, I live" is used for the opening of the "1UP Yours" podcasts.
