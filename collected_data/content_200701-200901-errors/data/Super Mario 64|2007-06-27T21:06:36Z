{{nihongo|'''''Super Mario 64'''''|スーパーマリオ64|Sūpā Mario Rokujūyon}} is a top-selling [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo 64]]. It debuted in [[Japan]] on [[June 23]], [[1996]], in [[North America]] on [[September 29]], [[1996]], and in [[Europe]] on [[March 1]], [[1997]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/150/150606p1.html | title=Super Mario 64 | last=Perry | first=Doug | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> Along with ''[[Pilotwings 64]]'', it was one of the [[launch title]]s for the new console.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://gameinformer.com/News/Story/200609/N06.0915.1324.09291.htm | title=Will Wii Be Disappointed Again? | last=Berghammer | first=Billy | publisher=[[Game Informer]] | date=[[2006-09-15]]|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> As the [[Flagship#Flagship in language|flagship]] [[killer game]], it drove initial sales of the Nintendo 64, and has sold over 12 million copies in total,<ref>{{cite web | title=Mario Sales Data | publisher=gamecubicle.com | url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/features-mario-units_sold_sales.htm | accessdate=2006-02-10}}</ref>  not including the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] sales.

''Super Mario 64,'' the first [[3D computer graphics|3D]] platform game in the ''[[Mario]]'' series, established a new archetype for the genre, much as ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' did for [[2D computer graphics|2D]] sidescrolling platformers. Hailed as "revolutionary", the game left a lasting impression on the industry, influencing many in the genre and leaving a lasting impact on 3D games in general.<ref name="gamespotinf">{{cite web

In going from two to three dimensions, ''Super Mario 64'' replaced the linear obstacle courses of traditional platform games with vast worlds in which the player must complete multiple and diverse missions, with an emphasis on exploration. While doing so, it managed to preserve the feel of earlier ''Mario'' games, including many of their gameplay elements and characters.<ref name="1up1" /> It is acclaimed by many critics and fans as one of the greatest video games of all time.<ref name="topgames">{{cite web | title=The Best Video Games in the History of Humanity | publisher=filibustercartoons.com | url=http://www.filibustercartoons.com/games.htm | accessdate=2006-02-11}}</ref><ref>"Citizen Game meets Game Man," ''Toronto Star'', December 2, 2004, pg.

==Story==

''Super Mario 64'' begins with a letter from [[Princess Peach]] inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. When he arrives, Mario finds out that [[King Bowser|Bowser]] has invaded the castle and imprisoned the Princess and her servants within it using the power of 105 of the castle's 120 power stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other realms, in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario searches the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more stars, and is eventually able to open four special Star Doors when he has 8, 30, 50 and 70 stars. Behind three of these doors is a portal to an obstacle course that leads up to a battle with Bowser himself. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle, while the final battle releases Peach and rolls the credits. Peach rewards Mario by baking the cake that she had promised him.<ref name="playersguide">{{cite book | author=Nintendo | year=1996 | title=Official Super Mario 64 Player's Guide | publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc. | language=English}}</ref><ref name="instructions">{{cite book | author=Nintendo | year=1996 | title=Super Mario 64 Instruction Booklet | publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc. | language=English | id=NUS-NSME-USA}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
===Controls===
[[Image:Super Mario 64 jumping.jpg|thumb|As illustrated in the instruction manual, Mario can perform a wide range of jumps among other moves.]]
Mario's abilities in ''Super Mario 64'' are far more diverse than those of previous ''Mario'' games. He can walk, run, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, and jump at great heights or distances using the [[game controller]]'s [[analog stick]] and buttons. As jumping was Mario's signature move in earlier games, particular attention was paid to this move. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the extra high double and triple jumps (jumping two and three times in a row, respectively), the long jump, and [[backflip]]. There are also special maneuvers, such as [[wall jump]]ing (jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach areas that would otherwise be too high).<ref name="playersguide" /><ref name="instructions" />

The ground pound can also be used to negate damage from a long fall. Mario can pick up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles. Mario can also swim underwater at various speeds. His life slowly diminishes while underwater (representing how long he can hold his breath); he must find coins or air bubbles to replenish it, or return to the surface before drowning.<ref name="playersguide" />

===Setting===
[[Image:N64 Super Mario 64 whomp fortress.jpg||thumb|left|Whomp's Fortress requires the player to navigate chasms, a classic ''Mario'' element.]]
''Super Mario 64'' is set in [[Princess Peach's Castle]], which consists of three floors, a basement, a moat, and a courtyard. The area outside the castle is an introductory area in which the player can experiment. Scattered throughout the castle are entrances to courses and other areas, usually accessed by jumping into a painting.

Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor. Mario gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after Mario has completed certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a [[boss (video games)|boss]], solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As Mario collects stars, more areas of the castle are opened. Mario unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses.<ref name="playersguide" />

Mario is assisted in some courses by three cap power-ups. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly, the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage and allows him to withstand wind and walk underwater, and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh (as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage).<ref name="playersguide" /> Some courses contain [[cannon]]s that Mario can unlock by speaking to a pink [[Bob-omb#Bob-omb Buddies|Bob-omb Buddy]]. After Mario enters a cannon, he can be shot out to reach distant places. When Mario has the Wing Cap, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.

There are many hidden secrets to the game, most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely.

==Development==
[[Image:Mario64 bowser level.jpg|right|thumb|200px|According to programmer Giles Goddard, the linear levels where Mario encounters Bowser are a reflection of what the entire game might have been if the original fixed path concept had stood.<ref name="goddard interview">(December 2001). "The Making of Mario 64: Giles Goddard Interview". ''NGC Magazine'', vol 61.</ref>]]

The development of ''Super Mario 64'' took less than two years, but producer/director [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] had conceived of a 3D ''Mario'' game over five years before, while working on ''[[Star Fox (video game)|Star Fox]]''.<ref name="interview">(January 1996). "The Game Guys - (Spaceworld 1995)". ''Nintendo Power'', vol 80. [http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=interviews&id=1996-01-np080-miya-tezu&m=html transcript]</ref> Miyamoto developed most of the concepts during the era of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and considered making it a SNES game (making use of the [[Super FX]] chip), but decided to develop it for the Nintendo 64 due to the earlier system's technical limitations.<ref name=nsider>[http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=271 Profile: Shigeru Miyamoto Chronicles of a Visionary], [[n-Sider]]</ref>

The development of the game started with the creation of the characters and camera system. Shigeru Miyamoto and the other designers were initially unsure of which direction the game should take, and months were spent selecting a camera view and layout that would be appropriate.<ref name="goddard_interview"/> The original concept involved the game having fixed path much like an [[Isometric adventure game|isometric]] type game, before the choice was made to settle on a free-roaming 3D design.<ref name="goddard_interview"/> Although the majority of ''Super Mario 64'' would end up featuring the free-roaming design, elements of the original fixed path concept would remain in certain parts of the game, particularly in the three Bowser encounters. One of the programmers for ''Super Mario 64'', Giles Goddard, explained that these few linear elements survived as a means to force players into Bowser's lair rather than to encourage exploration.<ref name="goddard_interview"/> The development team placed high priority on getting Mario's movements right, and before levels were created, the team were testing and refining Mario's animations on a simple grid. The first test scenario used to try out controls and physics involved Mario and the golden rabbit, MIPS. 
[[Image:Super Mario 64 beta.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Princess Peach's castle in a pre-release version of ''Super Mario 64''. The textures, layout, and icons are different than what appeared in the final release, though Mario himself is basically identical (the animation has fewer polygons).]]
Shigeru Miyamoto's guiding design philosophy behind ''Super Mario 64'' was to include more details.<ref name="interview" /> Many were inspired from real life; for example, one character is based on [assistant] director [[Takashi Tezuka]]'s wife who "is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time [Tezuka] spent at work. In the game, there is now a character (Big Boo) which shrinks (or looks semi-transparent) when Mario looks at it, but when Mario turns away, it will grow large and menacing."<ref>(August 1995). "Miyamoto Interview". ''Nintendo Power'', vol 75. [http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/0895.shtml transcript]</ref> ''Super Mario 64'' is also characterized by featuring more puzzles than earlier ''Mario'' games. It was developed simultaneously with ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', but as ''Zelda'' was released years later, some puzzles were taken from that game for ''Super Mario 64''.<ref name="interview2">(October 1996). "Miyamoto Interview". ''Nintendo Power'', vol 89. [http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/1096.shtml transcript]</ref>

Reliable information about Nintendo's new 3D ''Mario'' first leaked out in November 1995, and a playable version of ''Super Mario 64'' was presented days later as part of the world premier for the Nintendo 64 (then known as Ultra 64) at Nintendo [[SpaceWorld]]. The basic controls had at this point been implemented, and the game was reportedly 50% finished, although most course design remained. At least 32 courses were planned, but the number turned out lower in the final game, as only 15 could fit (or 25 courses, if the games' 10 extra mini-levels are included).<ref name="interview"/>

The music was composed by veteran [[Koji Kondo]], who used new interpretations of the familiar melodies from earlier games as well as entirely new material.

''Super Mario 64'' was one of the first games in the series to feature the voice acting of [[Charles Martinet]]. It also features Leslie Swan as Princess Peach and [[Isaac Marshall]] as Bowser. The characters speak more in the English version than in the Japanese version.<ref name="interview2"/> Sometimes different things are said. For example, when Mario tosses Bowser he says "Here we go!" both in the Japanese version (always) and in the English version (when he tosses Bowser lightly), and also says "So long, King Bowser!" in the English version. Also when Mario loses a life and is promptly ejected from the stage he cries "Mama mia!". In the Japanese verson, Mario does not greet the player with a "Hello!" at the start up screen like in the English release. Mario also does not talk in his sleep in the Japanese version. Princess Peach also has no voice in the Japanese version. Red Coins and Chain Chomp also sound different in the Japanese version. Some of these vocal changes for the English release were brought to the Japanese Rumble Pak edition. When ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'' was released, all the voices were kept consistent in both the English and Japanese versions. For instance, while Mario doesn't talk in his sleep like the original Japanese version. Peach also has her English voice with Japanese subtitles in the Japanese version. Minor grunts were also altered and changed to different places, and instead of saying "So long, King Bowser," Mario says "Bye-bye."<ref>"Super Mario 64: From Japanese to English".

==Reception==
''Super Mario 64'' is counted by 1up.com as one of the first games to have brought a series of 2D games into full 3D.<ref name="1up1" /> The game was designed with the earlier ''Mario'' titles' maneuvers, [[power-up]] blocks, level themes (such as grassland, lava, ice, desert, and so on), enemies, and other characters in mind. ''Super Mario 64''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s translation of traditional 2D platforming action into 3D was hailed as a great success by many players, and the game itself went on to effectively drive sales of the N64 console,{{Who|date=June 2007}} and is regarded today as one of the best games ever made.

There were others who felt that ''Super Mario 64'' did ''not'' readily capture the "feel" of its predecessors.{{Who|date=June 2007}} In the transition to 3D, many of the series conventions were rethought drastically, placing an emphasis on exploration over traditional platform jumping, or "hop and bop" action. While few disputed its quality, it has been argued that it established an entirely new genre, different from that of previous games in the series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3211627.stm | title=Platform video games evolve | last= | first= | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=2003-10-25 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> 
===Reviews===
''Super Mario 64'' was praised in the gaming press, and is still highly acclaimed. It has collected numerous awards, including various "Game of the Year" honors by members of the gaming media, as well as Nintendo's own bestseller [[Player's Choice]] selection. It has placed high on many "greatest games of all time" lists, ranked #1 by ''[[Next Generation Magazine]]'', #5 and #1 in ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' issues 200 and 100 respectively, #1 by ''[[Super PLAY]]'', #5 by [[IGN]],<ref>{{cite web | title=IGN's Top 100 Games | publisher=ign.com | year=2005 | url=http://top100.ign.com/2005/001-010.html|accessdate=2006-02-11}}</ref> #5 by ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', #12 by ''[[GameInformer]]''<ref>"Top 100 Games of All Time."

[http://www.entopia2002.com/features/top10games/08_superMario64.shtml]--> EGM awarded ''Super Mario 64'' a Gold award in its initial review, and in ''[[Edge (games magazine)|Edge]]'', the game was the first of only five games to ever score a perfect 10/10. [[GameSpot]] called ''Super Mario 64'' one of the 15 most influential games of all time. In the Famitsu, Super Mario 64 received 39/40. <ref name="gamespotinf" />

==Impact and legacy==
''Super Mario 64'' set many precedents for 3D platformers to follow.<ref name="1up1" />

Most existing 3D games at the time used a [[first-person shooter|first person]] or fixed perspective, but the platform gameplay of ''Super Mario 64'' required the use of a free camera. The game world is therefore viewed through an in-game [[professional video camera|video camera]] operated by [[Lakitu]].<ref name="instructions" /> Lakitu handles the camera automatically, but the player can change the perspective manually when necessary, since the camera programming occasionally makes the view get stuck behind walls or at odd angles. This was a useful innovation, as other games were sometimes unplayable due to an unfixable bad camera.<ref name="npsep96">(September 1996). "Super Mario 64". ''Nintendo Power'', vol 88. pp. 14-23.</ref>

The Nintendo 64's analog control stick allowed for more realistic and wide-ranging character movements than the [[digital]] [[D-pad]]s of previous consoles, and ''Super Mario 64'' exploits this feature extensively. For example, Mario's speed varies depending on the degree of tilt of the control stick.<ref name="instructions" /> The range and direction of many other movements can be controlled as well. The Bowser battles exhibit this by forcing the player to rotate the control stick in circles in order to swing Bowser around and throw him into mines placed around the arena.<ref>(June 1996). "N64 Exclusive". ''Nintendo Power'', vol 85. pp. 16-17.</ref>

''Super Mario 64'' was also notable for its sense of freedom and [[linearity (computer and video games)|non-linearity]]. This was initially unfamiliar to many people, among them was voice actor Michael Grayford of [[Liquid Entertainment]]:
{{cquote|When I first played ''Mario 64'', I was very turned off. There were too many places to run around and too much stuff to do, and I didn't really see the point or the spirit of the game. I tried it again later, though, hearing from everyone how fun it was, and ended up playing it all the way through to the end. I was highly pleased. Each level brought some new unique cool gameplay element and I was never bored.<ref name="GameSpy50">{{cite web | title=GameSpy's Top 50 Games of All Time | year=July 2001 | publisher=gamespy.com | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july01/top502ase/index3.shtm | accessdate=2006-02-11}}</ref>}}

[[Warren Spector]], former lead designer at [[Ion Storm Inc.]], also gave the following explanation for the game's influence:
{{cquote|It's not possible to squeeze this much gameplay into a single game. Mario has, like, ten things he can do and yet there's never a moment where you feel constrained in any way. No game has done a better job of showing goals before they can be attained, allowing players to make a plan and execute on it. And the way the game allows players to explore the same spaces several times while revealing something new each time is a revelation. Any developer who wouldn't kill to have made this game is nuts.<ref name="GameSpy50" />}}

A central hub, where controls can be learned before entering levels themselves, has been used in many 3D platformers since. In addition, the game's mission-based level design was an inspiration for other game designers. For example, [[Martin Hollis]], who produced and directed ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'', says that "the idea for the huge variety of missions within a level came from ''Super Mario 64''."<ref>{{cite web | title=The Making of GoldenEye 007 | year=September 2, 2004 | publisher=zoonami.com | url=http://www.zoonami.com/briefing/2004-09-02.php | accessdate=2006-02-11}}</ref>

===Remakes and sequels===
''Super Mario 64'' was first re-released in Japan on [[July 18]] [[1997]] as ''Shindou Super Mario 64''. This version added support for the [[Rumble Pak]] and included voice acting from the American version as well.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ign64.ign.com/objects/010/010131.html | title=Shindou Super Mario 64 (Rumble Pak Vers.) | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:17806 | title=Shindou Super Mario 64 | last=Davies | first=Jonti | publisher=allgame|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> In [[1998]], ''Super Mario 64'' was re-released in America as part of the [[Player's Choice]] line: a selection of games with high sales sold for a reduced price.

An [[enhanced remake]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] called ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'' was available for the launch of the DS in [[2004]]. [[Yoshi]], [[Luigi]], and [[Wario]] were added as additional playable characters, and the game featured slightly altered graphics, additional stars and courses, [[Touchscreen|touch screen]] mini-games, and a few minor [[multiplayer]] modes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/dssupermario4x4/review.html | title=Super Mario 64 DS review | last=Gerstmann | first=Jeff | publisher=Gamespot|date=[[2004-11-19]] | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>

''Super Mario 64'' is downloadable for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service, with a price of 1,000 Wii Points.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/733/733464p1.html | title=IGN's Nintendo Wii FAQ | last=Casamassina | first=Matt | authorlink=Matt Casamassina | publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2006-09-19]] | pages=5 | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> This release adds compatibility with the [[GameCube]] and Classic controllers, and [http://www.bytecellar.com/archives/000084.php enhances the display] by rendering polygons at approximately 4x the Nintendo 64's native 320x240 resolution. This version is able to run in [[480p]] on properly configured setups.

''[[Super Mario 64 2]]'' was planned for the [[Nintendo 64DD]], but was canceled due to the failure of that peripheral, as well as a lack of progress in development. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] built on ''Super Mario 64'''s core gameplay by adding a water pump device and add-on nozzles, similar to the Caps. The long jump and punches/kicks are noticeably absent, though. The next 3D ''Mario'' platformer is ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', to be released for the Wii in [[2007]].

===Rumors===
[[Image:L is Real 2041.png|right|thumb|200px|Mario swims in a castle's fountain]]
Because of the game's popularity, rumors about glitches and secrets spread rapidly after its release.<ref>[http://www.strategywiki.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64/Glitches Super Mario 64 glitches at StrategyWiki]</ref> The most infamous rumor is that Mario's brother Luigi is an unlockable character in the game. This rumor was fueled by some blurry text in the castle courtyard that supposedly read "L is real 2041". This caused rampant fan speculation that L(uigi) was real. [[IGN]] received so many questions and supposed methods to unlock Luigi that the staff offered a $100 bounty to anyone who could prove that Luigi was in the game.<ref>{{cite web | title=In Search of Luigi | publisher=ign.com | year=November 13, 1996 | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060383p1.html | accessdate=2006-02-11}}</ref> The number of false codes submitted to IGN dropped dramatically; no successful method emerged.<ref>{{cite web | title=Luigi Still Missing | publisher=ign.com | year=November 20, 1996 | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060392p1.html | accessdate=2006-02-11}}</ref>

Nintendo has consistently denied Luigi's playability, and never commented on the meaning of "L is real 2041" except for the [[April Fool's Day]] 1998 issue of ''[[Nintendo Power]]''. In this issue, the "April News Briefs" section said that the cryptic phrase would be discussed on page 128, but the magazine had only 106 pages.<ref name="npapr98">(April 1998). "April News Briefs." ''Nintendo Power'', vol 107. pp.80-81.</ref> The section also featured a facetious article entitled "Luigi 64", commenting humorously on the rumor.<ref name="npapr98" /> The then-infamous texture made a cameo appearance in Dodongo's Cavern, a dungeon in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]''.

Luigi did eventually make his presence real, as one of the four playable characters in the [[Nintendo DS]] [[Super Mario 64 DS|remake]], ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]''.
