The '''Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department''' ('''LASD''') is a local county law enforcement agency that serves [[Los Angeles County, California]]. It is the sixth largest law enforcement agency in the United States (behind the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]], [[Chicago Police Department]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]). Since 1996, it has also been the largest [[Sheriff]]'s department in the [[world]]<ref>[http://www.lasd.org/aboutlasd/history.html#dates]</ref>, and provides general-service law enforcement to unincorporated areas of [[Los Angeles County]], serving as the equivalent of the [[county police]] for unincorporated areas of the county, as well as [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] cities within the county who have contracted with the agency for law-enforcement services (known as "[[contract city|contract cities]]" in local jargon). It also holds primary jurisdiction over facilities operated by Los Angeles County, such as local parks, marinas and government buildings; provides [[marshal]] service for the [[Superior Courts of California|Superior Court of California - County of Los Angeles]]; operates the [[county jail]] system; and provides services, such as laboratories and academy training, to smaller law enforcement agencies within the county. The '''Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department''' ('''LASD''') is sometimes referred to as the '''Los Angeles Sheriff's Office''' ('''LASO'''). 

Beginning on [[March 10]], [[2007]], actor [[Jackie Chan]] joined forces with the LA County Sheriff's Department in their current recruitment campaign, oriented towards encouraging more members of the [[Asian American]] community to join the sheriff's department. In the announcement with Sheriff [[Lee Baca]], Chan was seen wearing an LA County Sheriff's Deputy uniform.<ref>[http://lasdshb.wordpress.com/2007/03/09/sheriff-baca-and-actor-jackie-chan-join-forces-to-recruit-crime-fighters/]</ref> <ref>[http://cbs2.com/local/local_story_070031643.html]</ref> <ref>[http://www.knx1070.com/content_page.php?contentType=4&contentId=368628]</ref>. One LASD [[public service announcement]] has already featured Chan.

==Statistics==
The LASD is the largest [[sheriff]]'s department, and the sixth largest federal, state or local law enforcement agency in the [[United States]] with over 16,000 employees, over 8,400 of whom are sworn deputies. [[Leroy D. Baca]] is the current sheriff.
[[Image:Lakewood sherriff monument.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Memorial to deputies killed on duty. Located outside the LASD [[Lakewood, California|Lakewood]] Station.]]
LASD deputies provided law enforcement services to 2,557,754 residents in an area of 3,171 square miles both in the [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] County land and within the contract cities (1995 figure).  

The Sheriff's Department also operates one the largest jail systems which provides short-term incarceration services for all of the County (including the cities like [[Los Angeles]] which have their own police departments). The [[Men's Central Jail]] (MCJ) and [[Twin Towers Correctional Facility]] (TTCF) are located in a dense cluster northeast of [[Los Angeles Union Station|Union Station]] that is next to the station's rail yard. The [[North County Correctional Facility]] (NCCF) is the largest of the four jail facilities located at the [[Pitchess Detention Center]] in [[Castaic, California]]. The other facilities are East Facility, North Facility, and South Facility. 

Some of the newer contract cities like [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]] and [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] have never had police departments. When their city governments were founded, they took over what was formerly unincorporated land, but then contracted their police responsibilities right back to the county sheriff. Since the department already had substations in those areas anyway, the result was to maintain the status quo.  

In contrast, [[Compton, California]], used to have a police department, but in 2000, the city council voted to dismantle the troubled police department and become a contract city. Compton has been at times notorious for [[gang]] violence, especially during its recent history.

L.A. County Sheriff's academy training is at Sheriff's Training Academy and Regional Services Center (STARS Center) in unincorporated [[South Whittier, California|South Whittier]]. Reserves may use either STARS Center or [[College of the Canyons]] (Santa Clarita) for academy training. Academy training is 18 weeks. Many law enforcement agencies throughout Los Angeles County utilize STARS Center and deputy sheriff trainees graduating as deputy sheriffs also undergo detention-specific training.

==Achievements==

The LASD has gained an international reputation for its efforts in developing and integrating the latest law enforcement technologies, especially nonlethal weapons. Because many developers, especially those developing technologies for the U.S. Department of Defense, have little idea of the needs of domestic law enforcement, the LASD provides experts to assist in the development and implementation of technologies that will be of service to law enforcment when fully mature. In the late 1990s, the LASD successfully implemented a county-wide sound recorder/meter system, ShotStopper, to detect loud noises.<ref>Cuza, Bobby. "Gadgets on Patrol Against Crime." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' 9 June 2000: B2.</ref> When dispatch has a call from a citizen reporting possible gunfire near their residence, these sound towers can pinpoint within about 25 to 30 feet where the shots were coming from and record the sound for investigative purposes, and at the same time, relay the GPS info to HQ and deputies on the street. The system has been up and running for several years and has been responsible for numerous felony arrests.

Currently, the LASD is working with the [[Federal Aeronautics Administration|FAA]] and local government officials to deploy their remote control aerial surveillance drone system. This would allow the Sheriff's Department to have real time imagery from the streets of Los Angeles to combat street violence and record crimes in progress, not to mention searching for missing hikers, "patrolling" behind the surf zones of the beaches and looking for lost children. The drones are not intended to replace police helicopters, but in specific incidents could be better, cheaper and quieter to use.

The LASD hired the first female deputy sheriff in the United States in 1912.  [[Margaret Q. Adams]] remained a deputy in the evidence department at the Los Angeles Couthouse for 35 years, until her retirement in 1947.

===Special Weapons Teams===

The LASD is also known for having some of the best-trained law enforcement officials in the world, most notably in the Special Enforcement Bureau, which houses the famous Special Weapons Team. The Special Weapons Teams are LASD's version of [[SWAT]] teams, a creation of the nearby [[LAPD]]. Both the LAPD and L.A. Sheriff SWAT teams are thought highly of by both federal agencies and law enforcement agencies worldwide. LASD and LAPD SWAT have helped the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] in the past by training [[U.S. Army Rangers]], Special Forces, and other military units on policing skills prior to being deployed overseas. Law enforcement agencies from across the nation and around the world often look to the LASD and LAPD SWAT teams for training and advice, often sending experienced officers to train under both departments. Before the [[war in Bosnia]] and peacekeeping operatons in Kosovo, the [[U.S. Army]] wanted to be able to enter those scenarios as specialized [[peacekeepers]]. Modern tactics of dynamic entries with large firepower were thought to be too excessive in certain situations, and would only serve to aggravate the situation further. The general plan of the U.S. and [[U.N.]] peacekeeping forces was to control a scene, take people into custody, and at the same time keep the peace, engaging in combat operations only when necessary.

In 1992, after the [[1992 L.A. Riots|King riots]] in Los Angeles, both the LAPD and LASD SWAT teams decided to work on tactics that would rescue people from dangerous crowds, and at the same time provide a way to eliminate a threat, such as a gunman, without being noticed by a hostile crowd. In the first example, the idea was to have SWAT ride in one of the city's Air Rescue helicopter units with [[LAFD]] and [[LASD]] paramedics to enter a scene, using SWAT as a threat to ground opposition while LAFD paramedics could safely drop in and pick up an injured person. In the second example, sharpshooters could be used at high altitudes in LASD air units to look for any potential threats on the ground, and at the same time neutralize any would-be killers.

===Air Rescue Program===
The [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Air Rescue 5|LASD Air Rescue]] program is used for many emergencies in L.A. County, most notably the wildfire-prone Angeles Forest. Those who are trapped in in hard to reach areas will usually be found and rescued by LASD Air Rescue. The LASD staffs multiple sea King helicopters for this program.

In addition to having a fleet of three [[Sikorsky Sea King]]s, the model of helicopter once used by the [[President of the United States]] as [[Marine One]], the LASD also utilizes several [[Eurocopter]] AS-350 AStars helicopters and several fixed wing aircraft.

The [[Sky Knight]] Helicopter Program is an airborne law enforcement program in [[Lakewood, CA]] which was started in 1966. The unit operates using non-sworn pilots, employed by the city of Lakewood, partnered with a sworn deputy sheriff from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Lakewood station. The unit currently operates three Schweizer 300C helicopters, based at Long Beach airport and flies about 1,800 hours per year. Today, the Sky Knight program is completely integrated within the sheriff's tactical operations. Five other cities (Artesia, Bellflower, Hawaiian Gardens, Paramount and Cerritos) contract with Lakewood to participate in the Sky Knight program. These five cities also contract with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for police services.

==History==
 {{main|History of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department}}
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which was founded in 1850, was the first professional police force in the Los Angeles area. The all-volunteer, Los Angeles-specific Los Angeles Rangers were formed in 1853 to assist the LASD. They were soon succeeded by the Los Angeles City Guards, another volunteer group. Neither force was particularly efficient and Los Angeles became known for its violence, gambling and "vice".



==Members killed on duty==
 {{main|List of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department officers killed in the line of duty}}

As of 2007, 94 sheriff's deputies have been killed in the line of duty since the department's founding in 1850.

===David March===
	 
The most notable fallen member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department was Deputy David W. March, who was killed by illegal Mexican immigrant Armando Garcia. [http://www.odmp.org/officer/16258-deputy-sheriff-david-william-march]
	 
On [[April 29]], [[2002]] in [[Irwindale, California]], Deputy March pulled over a 1989 [[Nissan Maxima]] driven by Garcia. After Deputy March attempted to frisk Garcia, Garcia pulled out a gun, overpowering and fatally shooting Deputy March execution-style. Garcia fled to Mexico within hours after the shooting.
	 
This led to tense negotiations with the U.S. and Mexican federal governments due to the possible use of the death penalty, which temporairly strained [[U.S.-Mexico relations]]. Under a treaty between the United States and Mexico, Mexico can refuse to extradite any fugitive who faces the death penalty. This led to Sheriff [[Leroy D. Baca|Lee Baca]] visiting [[Mexico City]] to negotiate with Mexican authorities to extradite Garcia. Mexico also could refuse to extradite fugitives who faced life in prison until 2004, when Mexico's highest court, under pressure from Mexican president [[Vincente Fox]]'s government, overturned the extradition policy.
	 
Garcia was captured near [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]], Mexico by U.S. and Mexican authorities. He fought extradition for several months, but was extradited back to the U.S. in January 2007. He pleaded guilty and as a result, was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
	 
The [[Interstate 210 (California)|I-210]]/[[I-605]] interchange in [[Duarte, California|Duarte]] was named in honor of Deputy March, and signs read "Deputy David W. March, Los Angeles County Sheriff Memorial Interchange." A memorial plaque was built at the intersection of Live Oak Ave. and Peck Rd. in Irwindale, which is the site where Deputy March was killed.

As a result of this case, Congressman [[David Dreier]], working with fellow Congressman [[Adam Schiff]] and Sheriff Lee Baca, introduced bi-partisan legislation that would make it a federal crime for any suspect who murders a public safety official and flees the United States. Three attempts have failed in committee and on [[February 22]], [[2007]], Congressman Dreier introduced such legislation for a fourth time.

In honor of Deputy David March, the Department adopted this creed: "My goals are simple, I will always be painfully honest, work as hard as I can, learn as much as I can and hopefully make a difference in people's lives." Deputy David W. March (EOW: [[April 29]], [[2002]])

===Raul Gama===

On [[May 1]], [[2007]], Deputy Raul Gama was killed in an accident involving a teenage driver. The driver was charged with [[manslaughter]]. The officer was on a stakeout and at first, it was thought the teen driver had hit a parked car. Unfortunately, several minutes later, it was later discovered that the parked car was occupied by Deputy Gama. This delay might have played a role in the death of the officer. This was a terrible tragedy for the families of both the officer and the teen driver, who was on his way to school at the time of the accident. Coincidentally, Deputy Gama died exactly 20 years after graduating from the LASD Academy.

==Reserve Program==
The [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] supplements its full time ranks with over 700 '''reserve deputies'''.

Like full-time deputies, reserve deputies are professionally trained and duly sworn law enforcement personnel. In most cases, Reserves are assigned to the same duties as Full-time deputies. Since reserve deputies have the same powers of [[arrest]] as full-time deputies they are required by law to meet the same hiring, background, medical and psychological standards as full-time deputies. reserve deputies must first complete the state mandated training and then work assignments as their regular jobs permit. Reserve sheriff's deputies are issued a badge, an identification card, uniforms, a [[Beretta 92FS]] duty weapon, [[handcuffs]], [[Club (weapon)|baton]], and other necessary equipment. Reserve deputy sheriffs have full peace officer powers when on duty, and, if issued a [[concealed carry (USA)|CCW permit]], may choose to carry a concealed weapon when off duty. Reserve deputy sheriffs must volunteer 20 hours per month of their time with the regular compensation being one dollar per year. Reserve deputy sheriffs may also qualify for shooting bonus pay of up to $32.00 per month, and some paid special event assignments are occasionally available. Like full-time deputies, reserve deputy sheriffs serve at the will of the Sheriff, must obey all departmental regulations, but do not fall into the framework of the civil service system. Reserve deputy sheriffs supplement the regular operations of the Sheriff's Department by working in their choice of Uniform Reserve (Patrol), Mounted Posse, Search and Rescue or as a Specialist.

==LASD in Popular Culture==
In the late 1950s, a short lived "[[Dragnet (drama)]]"-style [[television series]], "Code 3", aired based on real cases (though names and locations were changed) from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The late [[Eugene Biscailuz]], then [[Sheriff]] of [[Los Angeles County]], was featured in a cameo tag line at the end of every episode. 

The department's Emergency Services Detail (ESD), which functions under the umbrella of the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB), was depicted in the short lived [[television series]], ''[[240-Robert]]''. The SEB also includes the Canine Services Detail (K-9), and the Special Enforcement Detail (SED), which is the department's special weapons team.

In September 2003, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] premiered ''[[10-8: Officers on Duty]]'', a comedy/drama based on a rookie with the [[Los Angeles Sheriff's Department]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365969/ List of 10-8's Cast]</ref> The show lasted one season. The show's name was based on the police radio code for "on duty".

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Recruit Training Bureau is featured on [[Fox Reality]] show "[[The Academy (TV series)|The Academy]]," documenting the day to day activities of the recruits and training staff of LASD Academy Class 355 and 368. <ref>[http://www.lasd.org/_lasd-images/ACADEMY_1Sht.jpg]</ref><ref>[http://www.bittorrent.com/users/fox-reality/torrents/The_Academy__Season_1__Episode_1__Black_Monday/4c4fae4b14f54e21f7a75202fe303bb493ce3b3a]</ref><ref>[http://www.foxreality.com/show.php?id=25292 The Academy]</ref>
