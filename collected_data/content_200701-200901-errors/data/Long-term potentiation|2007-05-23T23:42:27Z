[[Image:LTP_exemplar.jpg|thumb|300px|Long-term potentiation is the persistent increase in synaptic strength following high-frequency stimulation of a synapse. Studies of long-term potentiation are often carried out in slices of the hippocampus, an organ of central importance in learning and memory. In such studies, cellular voltage recordings are made and plotted in a graph such as this one. This demonstrates the enhanced response to stimuli in synapses that have undergone LTP compared to the baseline response in synapses that have not undergone LTP.]]

In [[neuroscience]], '''long-term potentiation''' ('''LTP''') is an increase in the strength of a [[chemical synapse]] that lasts from minutes to several days. It is widely considered one of the major mechanisms by which [[memory|memories]] are formed and stored in the [[brain]]. 

LTP has been observed both in experimental preparations ''in vitro'' and in living animals (''in vivo''). Under experimental conditions, applying a series of short, high-frequency electric stimuli to a synapse can strengthen, or ''potentiate'', the synapse for minutes to hours. In living cells, LTP occurs naturally and can last from hours to days, months, and years. [[Neuron]]s connected by a synapse that has undergone LTP have a tendency to be active simultaneously: after a synapse has undergone LTP, subsequent stimuli applied to one cell are more likely to elicit [[action potential]]s in the cell to which it is connected.

Though its biological mechanisms have not yet been fully determined, LTP is believed to contribute to [[synaptic plasticity]] in living animals, providing the foundation for a highly adaptable [[nervous system]]. Because changes in synaptic strength are thought to underlie memory formation, LTP is believed to play a critical role in behavioral learning. In fact, most neuroscientific learning theories regard long-term potentiation and its opposing process, [[long-term depression]], as the cellular bases of [[learning]] and [[memory]].

LTP was discovered in the mammalian [[hippocampus]] by Terje Lømo in [[1966]] and has remained a popular subject of neuroscientific research since. Most modern LTP studies seek to better understand its basic biology, while others aim to draw a causal link between LTP and behavioral learning. Still others try to develop methods, pharmacologic or otherwise, of enhancing LTP to improve learning and memory.

==History==
===Early theories of learning===
[[Image:Cajal-mi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The 19th century neuroanatomist [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] proposed that memories might be stored in the connections between nerve cells.]]

By the end of the 19th century, scientists generally recognized that the number of neurons in the adult brain (roughly 100 billion<ref>{{cite journal |author=Williams RW, Herrup K |title=The control of neuron number |journal=Annu. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=11 |issue= |pages=423-53 |year=1988 |url=http://www.nervenet.org/papers/NUMBER_REV_1988.html |pmid=3284447}}</ref>) did not increase significantly with age, giving neurobiologists good reason to believe that memories were generally not the result of new nerve cell production.<ref name="cajal">{{cite journal | author = Ramón y Cajal, Santiago | title = The Croonian Lecture: La Fine Structure des Centres Nerveux | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London | volume = 55 | pages = 444-468 | year = 1894 | url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0370-1662(1894)55%3C444%3ATCLLFS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-H}}</ref> With this realization came the need to explain how memories could form in the absence of new nerve cells.

Among the first neuroscientists to suggest that learning was not the result of the creation of new cells through cell division was the [[Spain|Spanish]] neuroanatomist [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]]. In his [[1894]] [[Croonian Lecture]], he proposed that memories might be formed by strengthening the connections between existing neurons to improve the effectiveness of their communication.<ref name="cajal"/> [[Hebbian theory]], introduced by [[Donald Olding Hebb|Donald Hebb]] in [[1949]], echoed Ramón y Cajal's ideas, and further proposed that cells may grow new connections between each other to enhance their ability to communicate:

:''Let us assume that the persistence or repetition of a reverberatory activity (or "trace") tends to induce lasting cellular changes that add to its stability.... When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.''<ref>{{cite book | author=Hebb, D. O. | title=Organization of Behavior: a Neuropsychological Theory  | location=New York | publisher=John Wiley | year=1949 | id=ISBN 0-471-36727-3}}</ref>

Though these theories of memory formation are now well established, they were farsighted for their time: late 19th and early 20th century neuroscientists were not equipped with the [[electrophysiology|neurophysiological]] techniques necessary for elucidating the biological underpinnings of learning in animals. These skills would not come until the latter half of the 20th century, at about the same time as the discovery of long-term potentiation.

===Discovery of long-term potentiation===
[[Image:Hippocampus.png|thumb|right|200px|LTP was first discovered in the rabbit [[hippocampus]]. In humans, the hippocampus is located in the medial [[temporal lobe]]. This image of the underside of the [[human brain]] shows the hippocampus highlighted in red. The [[frontal lobe]] is at the top of the image and the [[occipital lobe]] is at the bottom.]]

LTP was first observed by [[Terje Lømo]] in 1966 in the [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], laboratory of [[Per Andersen]].<ref name="lomo">{{cite journal | author=Terje Lømo | title=The discovery of long-term potentiation | journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume=358 | issue=1432 | year=2003 | pages=617-20 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=12740104 |id=PMID 12740104}}</ref> There, Lømo conducted a series of [[electrophysiology|neurophysiological]] experiments on [[anesthesia|anesthetized]] rabbits to explore the role of the hippocampus in [[short-term memory]].

Isolating the connections between two parts of the hippocampus, the [[perforant pathway]] and [[dentate gyrus]], Lømo observed the electrical changes in the dentate gyrus elicited by stimulation of the perforant pathway. As expected, a single pulse of electrical stimulation to the perforant pathway elicited an [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]] (EPSP) in the dentate gyrus. What Lømo did not expect was that the postsynaptic responses to these single-pulse stimuli could be enhanced for a long period of time by first delivering a high-frequency train of stimuli to the synapse. When such a train of stimuli was applied, subsequent single-pulse stimuli elicited stronger, prolonged EPSPs. This phenomenon, whereby a high-frequency stimulus could produce a long-lived enhancement in the postsynaptic cell's response to subsequent single-pulse stimuli, was initially called "long-lasting potentiation".<ref name="bliss_lomo">{{cite journal |author=Bliss T, Lømo T |title=Long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission in the dentate area of the anaesthetized rabbit following stimulation of the perforant path |journal=J Physiol |volume=232 |issue=2 |pages=331-56 |year=1973 |pmid=4727084 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1350458&blobtype=pdf}}</ref><ref name="bliss_g-m">{{cite journal |author=Bliss T, Gardner-Medwin A |title=Long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission in the dentate area of the unanaestetized rabbit following stimulation of the perforant path |journal=J.

==Types==
Since its original discovery in the rabbit hippocampus, LTP has been observed in a variety of other neural structures, including the [[cerebral cortex]], [[cerebellum]], [[amygdala]], and many others. Robert Malenka, a prominent LTP researcher, has suggested that LTP may even occur at all excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain.<ref name="riches">{{cite journal |author=Malenka R, Bear M |title=LTP and LTD: an embarrassment of riches |journal=Neuron |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=5-21 |year=2004 |pmid=15450156}}</ref>

The specific type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends on a number of factors. One such factor is the age of the organism when LTP is observed. For example, the molecular mechanisms of LTP in the immature hippocampus differ from those mechanisms that underlie LTP of the adult hippocampus.<ref name="developmental-switch">{{cite journal |author=Yasuda H, Barth A, Stellwagen D, Malenka R |title=A developmental switch in the signaling cascades for LTP induction |journal=Nat Neurosci |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=15-6 |year=2003 |pmid=12469130}}</ref> The complement of signaling pathways expressed by a particular cell also contributes to the specific type of LTP present. For example, some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the [[NMDA receptor]], others may depend upon the [[metabotropic glutamate receptor]] (mGluR), while still others depend upon another molecule altogether.<ref name="riches"/> The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain is one reason that the type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends in part upon the anatomic location where LTP is observed. For example, LTP in the [[Schaffer collateral]] pathway of the hippocampus is NMDA receptor-dependent, whereas LTP in the [[mossy fiber]] pathway is NMDA receptor-independent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harris E, Cotman C |title=Long-term potentiation of guinea pig mossy fiber responses is not blocked by N-methyl D-aspartate antagonists |journal=Neurosci Lett |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=132-7 |year=1986 |pmid=3022192}}</ref>

Owing to its predictable organization and readily inducible LTP, the CA1 hippocampus has become the prototypical site of mammalian LTP study. In particular, NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in the adult CA1 hippocampus is the most widely studied type of LTP,<ref name="riches"/> and is therefore the focus of this article.

==Properties==
NMDA receptor-dependent LTP classically exhibits four main properties: rapid induction, input specificity, associativity, and cooperativity.

; Rapid induction
: LTP can be ''rapidly induced'' by applying one or more ''brief'' [[tetanic stimulation|tetanic stimuli]] to a presynaptic cell. (A tetanic stimulus is a high-frequency sequence of individual electrical stimuli.)

; Input specificity
: Once induced, LTP at one synapse is not arbitrarily propagated to adjacent synapses; rather LTP is ''input specific''. Long-term potentiation is only propagated to those synapses according to the rules of associativity and cooperativity.

; Associativity
: ''Associativity'' refers to the observation that when weak stimulation of a single pathway is insufficient for the induction of LTP, simultaneous strong stimulation of another pathway will induce LTP at both pathways.

; Cooperativity
: LTP can be induced either by strong tetanic stimulation of a single pathway to a synapse, or ''cooperatively'' via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Associativity and cooperativity may share the same underlying cellular mechanism (''see [[#Synaptic tagging|Synaptic tagging]]'').

==Mechanism==
Long-term potentiation occurs through a variety of mechanisms throughout the nervous system; no single mechanism unites all of LTP's many types. However, for the purposes of study, LTP is commonly divided into three phases that occur sequentially: short-term potentiation, early LTP, and late LTP.<ref name="sweatt-kinases"/> Little is known about the mechanisms of short-term potentiation,<ref name="sweatt-kinases"/> so it will not be discussed here.

The mechanisms of early LTP (E-LTP) and late LTP (L-LTP) can be classified into one of three categories: induction, maintenance, and expression. ''Induction'' is the process by which a short-lived signal triggers the phase of LTP to begin. ''Maintenance'' involves the persistent biochemical changes that occur in response to the induction of that phase. Finally, ''expression'' entails the long-lasting cellular changes that result from activation of the maintenance signal.<ref name="sweatt-kinases"/> Thus the mechanisms of LTP can be discussed in terms of those that underlie the induction, maintenance, and expression of E-LTP and L-LTP.

Induction of E-LTP occurs when the intracellular [[calcium]] concentration exceeds a critical threshold in the postsynaptic cell.<ref name="lynch"/> In many types of LTP, the influx of calcium that drives E-LTP induction requires the [[NMDA receptor]], which is why these types of LTP are considered to be NMDA receptor-dependent.<ref name="lynch"/> This critical threshold is defined by the concentration of calcium required to transiently activate several [[protein kinase]]s, including [[calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II]] (CaMKII) and [[protein kinase C]] (PKC).<ref name="sweatt-kinases"/> To a lesser extent, [[protein kinase A]] (PKA) and [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] (MAPK) activation also contribute to E-LTP induction.<ref name="sweatt-kinases"/>

While induction entails the ''transient'' activation of CaMKII and PKC, maintenance of E-LTP is characterized by their ''persistent'' activation. During this stage, CaMKII and PKC lose their dependence on calcium and become autonomously active. Consequently they are able to carry out the phosphorylation events that underlie LTP expression.<ref name="sweatt-kinases"/> The primary event underlying the expression of E-LTP is the phosphorylation of [[AMPA receptor]]s to increase the efficiency of [[synaptic transmission]].<ref name="riches"/>

The natural progression of E-LTP, L-LTP is induced by changes in [[gene expression]] and [[protein synthesis]] brought about by the persistent activation of protein kinases such as MAPK and PKA.<ref name="sweatt-kinases"/> These kinases are thought to alter gene expression through the phosphorylation of [[transcription factor]]s such as [[cAMP response element binding protein]] (CREB).<ref name="sweatt-kinases"/> They may also trigger the synthesis of molecules that underlie the maintenance of L-LTP. One such molecule may be [[protein kinase Mζ]] (PKMζ), a persistently active kinase whose synthesis increases following tetanic stimulation.<ref name="PKMz"/> PKMζ has recently been shown to underlie L-LTP maintenance.<ref name="PKMz"/><ref name="PKMz-maintenance"/> It is thought to direct the trafficking and reorganization of proteins in the synaptic scaffolding that underlie the expression of L-LTP.<ref name="PKMz"/>

===Induction===
{{main|LTP induction}}

NMDA receptor-dependent LTP can be induced experimentally by applying a few trains of high-frequency stimuli to the connection between two neurons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Huang Y, Kandel E |title=Recruitment of long-lasting and protein kinase A-dependent long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of hippocampus requires repeated tetanization |journal=Learn Mem |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=74-82 |year=1994 |pmid=10467587}}</ref> An understanding of normal synaptic transmission illustrates how this tetanic stimulation can induce LTP.

Through normal [[synaptic transmission]], non-tetanic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter [[glutamate]] from the presynaptic terminal onto the postsynaptic cell membrane, where it binds to [[AMPA receptor]]s (AMPARs) embedded in the postsynaptic membrane. AMPA receptors are the main excitatory receptors in the brain, and are responsible for most of its moment-to-moment excitatory activity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Platt S |title=The role of glutamate in central nervous system health and disease--a review |journal=Vet J |volume=173 |issue=2 |pages=278-86 |year=2007 |pmid=16376594}}</ref> Glutamate binding to the AMPA receptor triggers the influx of predominantly [[sodium]] ions into the postsynaptic cell, causing a depolarization called the [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]] (EPSP).

The magnitude of the EPSP determines whether LTP will be induced in the postsynaptic cell. While a single stimulus does not generate an EPSP capable of inducing LTP, repeated stimuli given at high frequency cause the postsynaptic cell to be progressively depolarized as a result of EPSP summation: with each stimulus reaching the postsynaptic cell before the previous EPSP can decay, successive EPSPs add to the depolarization caused by the previous EPSPs. In synapses that exhibit NMDA receptor-dependent LTP, sufficient depolarization unblocks [[NMDA receptor]]s (NMDARs), receptors that allow [[calcium]] to flow into the cell when bound by glutamate. While NMDARs are present at most postsynaptic membranes, at [[resting membrane potential]]s they are blocked by a [[magnesium]] ion that prevents the entry of calcium into the postsynaptic cell. Sufficient depolarization through the summation of EPSPs relieves the magnesium blockade of the NMDAR, allowing calcium influx. The rapid rise in intracellular calcium concentration triggers the maintenance and expression of LTP, specifically its early phase.

===Maintenance and expression===
[[Image:Early LTP mechanism.png|right|thumb|200px|The early phase of LTP, one model of which is shown here, is independent of protein synthesis.<ref name="lynch"/>]]

The maintenance and expression of LTP is often divided into two phases: an early, [[protein synthesis]]-independent phase (E-LTP) that lasts from two to three hours, and a late, protein synthesis-dependent phase (L-LTP) that lasts from several hours ''in vitro'' to months ''in vivo''.<ref name="Abraham">{{cite journal |author=Abraham WC et al. |title=Induction and experience-dependent consolidation of stable long-term potentiation lasting months in the hippocampus.|journal=J Neurosci |volume=22 |issue=21 |pages=9626-9634 |year=2002 |pmid=12417688 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/22/21/9626}}</ref> Some investigators believe that E-LTP operates by making the postsynaptic cell more sensitive to glutamate through the insertion of [[AMPA receptor]]s into the postsynaptic membrane. Others propose that E-LTP is the result of increased release of glutamate from the presynaptic terminal. Many researchers believe that LTP is due to both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms.

The late phase of LTP results in a pronounced strengthening of the postsynaptic response largely through the synthesis of new proteins and the remodeling of synapses. These proteins include [[transcription factor]]s (eg, [[CREB]]), glutamate receptors (eg, AMPA receptors), and structural proteins that enhance existing synapses and form new connections.

====Early phase====
[[Image:CaMKII.png|thumb|200px|Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) appears to be an important mediator of the early, protein synthesis-independent phase of LTP.]]

Early LTP is the series of events that take place within minutes and hours following LTP induction. Few downstream molecular events leading to the expression and maintenance of E-LTP are known with certainty, yet there is considerable evidence that E-LTP depends upon the activity of several [[protein kinase]]s,<ref name="sweatt-kinases"/> including [[calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II]] (CaMKII),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lledo PM, Hjelmstad GO, Mukherji S, Soderling TR, Malenka RC, Nicoll RA |title=Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and long-term potentiation enhance synaptic transmission by the same mechanism |journal=Proc.

CaMKII and other [[protein kinase]]s carry out the expression of E-LTP postsynaptically via two major mechanisms.<ref name="riches"/> First, they chemically modify postsynaptic AMPA receptors by adding [[phosphate]] groups to them. Second, they mediate or modulate the insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. As mentioned previously, AMPA receptors are the brain's most abundant glutamate receptors and mediate the majority of its excitatory activity. By increasing the number of AMPA receptors at the synapse, future excitatory stimuli generate larger postsynaptic responses. Importantly, the delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapse during E-LTP is independent of protein synthesis. This is achieved by having a nonsynaptic pool of AMPA receptors adjacent to the postsynaptic membrane. When the appropriate LTP-inducing stimulus arrives, nonsynaptic AMPA receptors are rapidly trafficked into the postsynaptic membrane under the influence of protein kinases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malinow R |title=AMPA receptor trafficking and long-term potentiation |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=358 |issue=1432 |pages=707-14 |year=2003 |pmid=12740116}}</ref>

While E-LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, an additional component of expression may occur presynaptically.<ref name="emptage">{{cite journal |author=Emptage N, Reid C, Fine A, Bliss T |title=Optical quantal analysis reveals a presynaptic component of LTP at hippocampal Schaffer-associational synapses |journal=Neuron |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=797-804 |year=2003 |pmid=12797963 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WSS-4C5XN9K-G&_coverDate=06%2F05%2F2003&_alid=523934887&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=7054&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=15f6a55d9b53d2265077f3a74a8a495a}}</ref> One hypothesis of presynaptic facilitation is that enhanced CaMKII activity during early LTP may give rise to CaMKII autophosphorylation and constitutive activation. Persistent CaMKII activity may promote the synthesis of a retrograde messenger that travels across the synaptic cleft from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell, leading to a chain of events that facilitate the presynaptic response to subsequent stimuli. This retrograde messenger may also play a role in presynaptic events underlying L-LTP. (''See [[#Retrograde signaling|Retrograde signaling]] for further discussion.'')

====Late phase====
[[Image:Late LTP mechanism.png|right|thumb|200px|The early and late phases of LTP are thought to communicate via the [[extracellular signal-regulated kinase]] (ERK).<ref name="lynch"/>]]

Late LTP is the natural extension of E-LTP. There is controversy over whether L-LTP can be induced separately from E-LTP, so that possibility will not be considered here. Unlike early LTP, which is independent of protein synthesis, late LTP requires transcription<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frey U, Frey S, Schollmeier F, Krug M |title=Influence of actinomycin D, a RNA synthesis inhibitor, on long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal neurons in vivo and in vitro |journal=J Physiol |volume=490 (Pt 3) |issue= |pages=703-11 |year=1996 |pmid=8683469 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=8683469}}</ref> and protein synthesis<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frey U, Krug M, Reymann K, Matthies H |title=Anisomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, blocks late phases of LTP phenomena in the hippocampal CA1 region in vitro |journal=Brain Res |volume=452 |issue=1-2 |pages=57-65 |year=1988 |pmid=3401749}}</ref> in the postsynaptic cell. Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first depends upon protein synthesis, while the second depends upon both transcription and protein synthesis.<ref name="lynch"/> These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature. In addition to the synthesis of new postsynaptic proteins, new protein synthesis has also been observed presynaptically and in the extracellular matrix.<ref name="lynch"/>

The identities of these newly synthesized proteins are not known, but evidence suggests that they contribute to the increase in [[dendritic spine]] number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with LTP.<ref name="lynch"/> The latter may be brought about in part by the enhanced synthesis of AMPA receptors during L-LTP.<ref name="lynch"/> Late LTP is also associated with the presynaptic synthesis of [[synaptotagmin]] and an increase in [[synaptic vesicle]] number, suggesting that L-LTP induces protein synthesis not only in postsynaptic cells, but in presynaptic cells as well.<ref name="lynch"/> In order for postsynaptic LTP induction to result in presynaptic protein synthesis, there must be communication from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell. (''See [[#Retrograde signaling|Retrograde signaling]].'')

Even in studies restricted to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined the location of the protein synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein synthesis takes place in the postsynaptic cell body or in its dendrites.<ref name="translation">{{cite journal |author=Kelleher R, Govindarajan A, Tonegawa S |title=Translational regulatory mechanisms in persistent forms of synaptic plasticity |journal=Neuron |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=59-73 |year=2004 |pmid=15450160}}</ref> Despite having observed [[ribosome]]s (the major components of the protein synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons.<ref name="translation"/> This dogma was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed.<ref name="translation"/> More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kang H, Schuman E |title=A requirement for local protein synthesis in neurotrophin-induced hippocampal synaptic plasticity |journal=Science |volume=273 |issue=5280 |pages=1402-6 |year=1996 |pmid=8703078}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Steward O, Worley P |title=A cellular mechanism for targeting newly synthesized mRNAs to synaptic sites on dendrites |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=98 |issue=13 |pages=7062-8 |year=2001 |pmid=11416188 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/13/7062}}</ref>

One reason for the popularity of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP.<ref name="translation"/> Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis directly compromises it. (''However, see [[#Synaptic tagging|Synaptic tagging]] for a model that reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.'')

In addition to the identities of the proteins synthesized and the location of this synthesis, there is also the question of what molecules trigger postsynaptic protein synthesis during L-LTP. One such trigger appears to be the [[extracellular signal-regulated kinase]] (ERK), a member of the family of [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]]s (MAP kinases).<ref name="translation"/><ref name="lynch"/> In fact, ERK may be the molecular link between E-LTP and L-LTP, since many signaling cascades involved in E-LTP, including CaMKII, can converge on ERK under physiological conditions.<ref name="translation"/> Upon activation, ERK may phosphorylate a number of cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules that ultimately result in the protein synthesis and morphological changes observed in L-LTP.<ref name="lynch"/>

While ERK appears to underlie the expression of L-LTP, [[protein kinase Mζ]] (PKMζ) appears responsible for its maintenance.<ref name="PKMz">{{cite journal |author=Serrano P, Yao Y, Sacktor T |title=Persistent phosphorylation by protein kinase Mzeta maintains late-phase long-term potentiation |journal=J Neurosci |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1979-84 |year=2005  |pmid=15728837}}</ref><ref name="PKMz-maintenance">{{cite journal |author=Pastalkova E, Serrano P, Pinkhasova D, Wallace E, Fenton A, Sacktor T |title=Storage of spatial information by the maintenance mechanism of LTP |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1141-4 |year=2006 |pmid=16931766}}</ref> PKMζ is an atypical isoform of PKC that lacks a regulatory subunit and thus remains constitutively active.<ref name="PKMz"/> Unlike other kinases that mediate LTP, PKMζ is active not just in the first 30 minutes following LTP induction; rather, PKMζ becomes a requirement for LTP maintenance only during the late phase of LTP.<ref name="PKMz"/> PKMζ thus appears important for the persistence of memory and would be expected to be important in the maintenance of [[long-term memory]]. Indeed, administration of a PKMζ inhibitor into the hippocampi of rats results in [[retrograde amnesia]] with intact [[short-term memory]]; PKMζ does not play a role in the establishment of short-term memory.<ref name="PKMz-maintenance"/>

====Retrograde signaling====
{{main|Retrograde signaling in LTP}}

Retrograde signaling is a hypothesis that attempts to explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence suggests that it is expressed presynaptically as well.<ref name="riches"/><ref name="emptage"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pavlidis P, Montgomery J, Madison D |title=Presynaptic protein kinase activity supports long-term potentiation at synapses between individual hippocampal neurons |journal=J Neurosci |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=4497-505 |year=2000 |pmid=10844019}}</ref> The hypothesis gets its name because normal [[synaptic transmission]] is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell in a ''retrograde'' ("reverse") direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased release of [[neurotransmitter vesicle]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zakharenko S, Patterson S, Dragatsis I, Zeitlin S, Siegelbaum S, Kandel E, Morozov A |title=Presynaptic BDNF required for a presynaptic but not postsynaptic component of LTP at hippocampal CA1-CA3 synapses |journal=Neuron |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=975-90 |year=2003 |pmid=12971897}}</ref>

Retrograde signaling is currently a contentious subject as some investigators do not believe the presynaptic cell contributes at all to the expression of LTP.<ref name="riches"/> Even among proponents of the hypothesis there is controversy over the identity of the messenger. Early thoughts focused on [[nitric oxide]], while most recent evidence points to [[cell adhesion]] proteins.<ref name="riches"/>

====Synaptic tagging====
Before the local protein synthesis hypothesis (''see [[#Late phase|Late phase]]'') gained significant support, there was general agreement that the protein synthesis underlying L-LTP occurred in the cell body. Further, there was thought that the products of this synthesis were shipped cell-wide in a nonspecific manner. It thus became necessary to explain how protein synthesis could occur in the cell body without compromising LTP's input specificity. The synaptic tagging hypothesis attempts to solve the cell's difficult problem of synthesizing proteins in the cell body but ensuring they only reach synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli.

The synaptic tagging hypothesis proposes that a "synaptic tag" is synthesized at synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli, and that this synaptic tag may serve to capture plasticity-related proteins shipped cell-wide from the cell body.<ref name="frey-synaptic_tagging">{{cite journal |author=Frey U, Morris R |title=Synaptic tagging and long-term potentiation |journal=Nature |volume=385 |issue=6616 |pages=533-6 |year=1997 |pmid=9020359}}</ref> Studies of LTP in the [[sea slug|marine snail]] ''[[Aplysia californica]]'' have implicated synaptic tagging as a mechanism for the input-specificity of LTP.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin K, Casadio A, Zhu H, Yaping E, Rose J, Chen M, Bailey C, Kandel E |title=Synapse-specific, long-term facilitation of aplysia sensory to motor synapses: a function for local protein synthesis in memory storage |journal=Cell |volume=91 |issue=7 |pages=927-38 |year=1997 |pmid=9428516}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Casadio A, Martin K, Giustetto M, Zhu H, Chen M, Bartsch D, Bailey C, Kandel E |title=A transient, neuron-wide form of CREB-mediated long-term facilitation can be stabilized at specific synapses by local protein synthesis |journal=Cell |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=221-37 |year=1999 |pmid=10535740}}</ref> There is some evidence that given two widely separated synapses, an LTP-inducing stimulus at one synapse drives several signaling cascades (described previously) that initiates gene expression in the cell nucleus. At the same synapse (but not the unstimulated synapse), local protein synthesis creates a short-lived (less than three hours) synaptic tag.<!--<ref name="frey-synaptic_tagging" />--> The products of gene expression are shipped globally throughout the cell, but are only captured by synapses that express the synaptic tag. Thus only the synapse receiving LTP-inducing stimuli is potentiated, demonstrating LTP's input specificity.

The synaptic tag hypothesis may also account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (''see [[#Properties|Properties]]'') is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate synapse is only weakly stimulated. Whereas one might expect only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone is insufficient to induce LTP at either synapse), ''both'' synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce protein synthesis in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.

Cooperativity is observed when two synapses are activated by weak stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. Synaptic tagging does not explain how multiple weak stimuli can result in a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this is explained by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following weak synaptic stimulation.

The molecules that underlie LTP can be classified as mediators or modulators. A mediator of LTP is a molecule, such as the NMDA receptor or calcium, whose presence and activity is necessary for generating LTP under nearly all conditions. By contrast, a modulator is a molecule that can alter LTP but is not essential for its generation or expression.<ref name="riches"/>

In addition to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered by a variety of modulators. For example, the [[steroid hormone]] [[estradiol]] may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent [[dendritic spine]] growth.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Segal M, Murphy D |title=CREB activation mediates plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons |journal=Neural Plast |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=1-7 |year=1999 |pmid=9920677}}</ref> Additionally, [[β-adrenergic receptor]] agonists such as [[norepinephrine]] may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Straube T, Frey J |title=Involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors in protein synthesis-dependent late long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats: the critical role of the LTP induction strength |journal=Neuroscience |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=473-9 |year=2003 |pmid=12770561}}</ref> [[Nitric oxide synthase]] activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lu Y, Kandel E, Hawkins R |title=Nitric oxide signaling contributes to late-phase LTP and CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus |journal=J Neurosci |volume=19 |issue=23 |pages=10250-61 |year=1999 |pmid=10575022}}</ref> Similarly, activation of [[dopamine receptor]]s may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frey U, Matthies H, Reymann K, Matthies H |title=The effect of dopaminergic D1 receptor blockade during tetanization on the expression of long-term potentiation in the rat CA1 region in vitro |journal=Neurosci Lett |volume=129 |issue=1 |pages=111-4 |year=1991 |pmid=1833673}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Otmakhova N, Lisman J |title=D1/D5 dopamine receptor activation increases the magnitude of early long-term potentiation at CA1 hippocampal synapses |journal=J Neurosci |volume=16 |issue=23 |pages=7478-86 |year=1996 |pmid=8922403}}</ref>

==Relationship to behavioral memory==
While the long-term potentiation of synapses in cell culture seems to provide an elegant substrate for learning and memory, the contribution of LTP to behavioral learning — that is, learning at the level of the whole organism — cannot simply be extrapolated from ''in vitro'' studies. For this reason, considerable effort has been dedicated to establishing whether LTP is a requirement for learning and memory in living animals.

===Role in spatial memory===
[[Image:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Morris water maze]] task has been used to demonstrate the necessity of NMDA receptors in establishing [[spatial memory|spatial memories]].]]

In 1986, Richard Morris provided some of the first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories ''in vivo''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Morris R, Anderson E, Lynch G, Baudry M |title=Selective impairment of learning and blockade of long-term potentiation by an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, AP5 |journal=Nature |volume=319 |issue=6056 |pages=774-6 |year=1986 |pmid=2869411}}</ref> He tested the [[spatial memory]] of rats by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning is well established. Rats were pretrained on the [[Morris water maze]], a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. Following pretraining, one group of rats had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker [[APV (NMDAR antagonist)|APV]], while the other group served as the [[control group|control]]. Both groups were then subjected again to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided some early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was somehow involved with at least some types of learning and memory.

Similarly, [[Susumu Tonegawa]] demonstrated in 1996 that the CA1 area of the hippocampus is crucial to the formation of spatial memories in living mice.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McHugh T, Blum K, Tsien J, Tonegawa S, Wilson M |title=Impaired hippocampal representation of space in CA1-specific NMDAR1 knockout mice |journal=Cell |volume=87 |issue=7 |pages=1339-49 |year=1996 |pmid=8980239}}</ref> So-called ''[[place cell]]s'' located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a ''place field'' — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus. The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls. That is, rats produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these rats performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls, providing more support to the notion that LTP is the underlying mechanism of spatial learning.

Enhanced NMDA receptor activity in the hippocampus has also been shown to produce enhanced LTP and an overall improvement in spatial learning. In 2001, [http://www.bumc.bu.edu/www/busm/pharmacology/tsien/index.htm Joe Tsien] produced a line of mice with enhanced NMDA receptor function by overexpressing the NR2B subunit in the hippocampus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tang Y, Wang H, Feng R, Kyin M, Tsien J |title=Differential effects of enrichment on learning and memory function in NR2B transgenic mice |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=779-90 |year=2001 |pmid=11640933}}</ref> The resulting smart mice, nicknamed "Doogie mice" after the prodigious doctor [[Doogie Howser]], had larger LTP and excelled at spatial learning tasks, once again suggesting a role for LTP in the formation of hippocampus-dependent memories.

===Role in inhibitory avoidance===
In 2006, Jonathan Whitlock and colleagues reported on a series of experiments that provided perhaps the strongest evidence of LTP's role in behavioral memory, arguing that in order to conclude that LTP underlies behavioral learning, the two processes must both mimic and occlude one another.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Whitlock J, Heynen A, Shuler M, Bear M |title=Learning induces long-term potentiation in the hippocampus |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1093-7 |year=2006 |pmid=16931756}}</ref> Employing an inhibitory avoidance learning paradigm, researchers trained rats in a two-chambered apparatus with light and dark chambers, the latter being fitted with a device that delivered a foot shock to the rat upon entry. An analysis of CA1 hippocampal synapses revealed that inhibitory avoidance training induced ''in vivo'' AMPA receptor phosphorylation of the same type as that seen in LTP ''in vitro''; that is, inhibitory avoidance training mimicked LTP. In addition, synapses potentiated during training could not be further potentiated by experimental manipulations that would have otherwise induced LTP; that is, inhibitory avoidance training occluded LTP. In a response to the article, Timothy Bliss and colleagues remarked that these and related experiments "substantially advance the case for LTP as a neural mechanism for memory."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bliss T, Collingridge G, Laroche S |title=Neuroscience. ZAP and ZIP, a story to forget |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1058-9 |year=2006 |pmid=16931746}}</ref>
