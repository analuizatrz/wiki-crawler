'''British Airways Flight 9''', sometimes referred to as the '''Jakarta incident''', was a scheduled [[British Airways]] flight from [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] to [[Auckland]], with stops in [[Bombay]], [[Madras]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Melbourne]]. On [[24 June]], [[1982]], the route was flown by ''City of Edinburgh'', a [[Boeing 747|747-200]] registered {{airreg|G|BDXH}}. The aircraft flew into a cloud of [[volcanic ash]] thrown up by the eruption of [[Mount Galunggung]], resulting in the failure of all four engines, although the reason for the failure was not then apparent to the crew or ground control. The aircraft was diverted to [[Jakarta]] in the hope that enough engines could be restarted to allow it to land there. The aircraft was able to glide far enough to exit the ash cloud, and all engines were restarted (although one failed again soon after), allowing the aircraft to land safely.

==Incident==
The first sign of anything amiss occurred shortly after 13:40 GMT above the Indian Ocean, south of Java, when [[first officer|Senior First Officer]] Roger Greaves and [[flight engineer|Senior Engineer Officer]] Barry Townley-Freeman noticed an effect on the windscreen similar to [[St. Elmo's Fire]], as if it were being hit by [[tracer ammunition|tracer bullets]]. The phenomenon persisted after [[Captain#Civil Aviation|Captain]] Eric Moody, who had left the [[cockpit]] to use the [[lavatory]], returned. Despite seeing nothing on the [[weather radar]], they switched on engine anti-ice and the passenger seat belt signs as a precaution.

In the passenger cabin, smoke started gathering in the air. At first it was assumed to be cigarette smoke, but as it grew thicker, alarm spread. Those looking out windows also noticed that the engines were unusually bright, as if they each had a searchlight in them, shining forward through the fan blades.

At approximately 13:42 GMT, engine number four surged and then [[Flameout|flamed out]]. The first officer and flight engineer immediately performed the engine fire drill, shutting off fuel and arming [[fire extinguisher]]s as the Captain added some rudder to counter the uneven thrust. The passengers also spotted long yellow glows coming out of the remaining engines. Less than a minute after the first engine failed, engine two surged and flamed out. Before the flight crew could begin the engine failure drills, engines one and three shut down almost simultaneously.

The 747 had now become a glider. A 747 can glide 15 kilometres for every kilometre it loses in height.<ref>Episode "All Engines Failed!" from the Cineflix series [[Mayday (TV series)|''Mayday'']]</ref> This meant that, from its flight level of about 11,280 metres, Flight 9 would be able to glide 168 kilometres (105&nbsp;miles). At 13:44 GMT, Captain Moody told SFO Greaves to [[Distress signal#Aviation distress signals|declare an emergency]] to the local [[air traffic control]] authority, stating that all four engines had shut down, but Jakarta Area Control misunderstood the message, believing that only engine number 4 had shut down. It was only after a [[Garuda Indonesia]] flight relayed that the message got through. The loss of power was immediately obvious to the passengers, and they reacted to it in many different ways. Some became resigned, while others wrote notes to their loved ones, such as Charles Capewell's poignant "Ma. In trouble. Plane going down. Will do best for boys. We love you. Sorry. Pa XXX" scrawled on the cover of his ticket wallet. There was, however, remarkably little panic.

On the flight deck the crew attempted to contact Jakarta for radar assistance, but could not be seen by Jakarta, despite their [[transponder]] being set to 7700, the international emergency code. Due to the high Indonesian mountains, an altitude of at least 11,500&nbsp;ft was required to cross the coast safely. Captain Moody decided, that, if the aircraft was unable to maintain altitude by the time they reached 12,000&nbsp;ft, he would turn the aircraft back out to sea and attempt to ditch. The crew began the engine restart drills, despite being well over the recommended maximum altitude of 28,000&nbsp;ft.

Despite the lack of time, Captain Moody made an announcement that has gone down in aviation history as a masterpiece of [[understatement]]:

<blockquote>
:''"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your Captain speaking. We have a small problem. All four engines have stopped. We are doing our damnedest to get them going again. I trust you are not in too much distress."''
</blockquote>

At 13,500&nbsp;ft, the flight crew attempted one last engine restart procedure before turning for the ocean the risky prospect of a water [[ditching]] — although there were guidelines, no one had ever tried it in a 747 — nor have they since<!-- (as far as I know) -->. The number four engine started, and at 13:56 GMT, Captain Moody used its power to reduce the rate of descent. Shortly thereafter, engine three restarted, followed shortly by engines one and two. The crew were amazed at their change of fortune, and requested an increase in altitude to 15,000&nbsp;feet.<ref name="Tootell">{{cite book | author=Betty Tootell | title=All Four Engines Have Failed| publisher=Andre Deutsch | year=1985 | id=ISBN 0-330-29492-X }}</ref> The reason the engines could restart was due to one generator still operating, which provided power to the plane, thus allowing ignition of the engines.

As it approached its target altitude, the tracer effect on the windscreen returned. Captain Moody throttled back, but it was too late, and number two engine surged again, and had to be shut down. The crew immediately descended back to 12,000&nbsp;ft.

At last flight 009 approached Jakarta. Despite reports of good visibility, the crew found it hard to see anything, and had to make the approach almost entirely on instruments, despite the [[glideslope]] of the [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] being inoperative. Although the runway lights could be made out through a small strip of the windscreen, the landing lights seemed to be inoperable. After landing, the flight crew then found it impossible to taxi, as glare from apron floodlights made the windscreen opaque, and ''City of Edinburgh'' had to wait for a tug to tow her in.

==Aftermath==
It was found that ''City of Edinburgh'''s problems had been caused by flying through a cloud of [[volcanic ash]] from the eruption of Mount [[Galunggung]]. Because the ash cloud was dry, it did not show up on the weather radar, which is designed to pick up the drops of moisture that form clouds. The cloud sandblasted the windscreen and landing light covers, as well as clogging the engines. Engines one, two and three were replaced at Jakarta, as well as the windscreen, and the fuel tanks were cleared of ash that had entered them through the pressurisation ducts, contaminating the fuel and requiring that it be disposed of. After being ferried back to London, engine number four was replaced and major work was undertaken to return the aircraft to service, where some crews nicknamed it "the flying ashtray." G-BDXH also entered the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as the longest glide in a non-purpose-built aircraft until it was replaced by the [[Air Transat Flight 236]] incident.

At the time of this incident, this 747 was considered to be the most severely damaged aircraft to maintain flight and land safely.

Although the airspace around Mount Galunggung was closed temporarily after the accident, it was re-opened days later. It was only after a [[Singapore Airlines]] 747 was forced to shut down three of its engines while flying through the same area nineteen days later, that Indonesian authorities closed the airspace permanently and re-routed airways to avoid the area, and a watch was set up to monitor clouds of ash.

The crew received various awards, including Her Majesty The Queen's Commendations for Valuable Service in the Air and medals from the [[British Air Line Pilots Association]]. Following the incident, the crew and passengers formed the Galunggung Gliding Club as a means to keep in contact.<ref>{{cite news

In a nearly identical incident in 1989, [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]] [[KLM Flight 867|Flight 867]] from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Anchorage, Alaska]], flew into the plume of the erupting [[Mount Redoubt (Alaska)|Mount Redoubt]], causing all four engines to fail due to [[compressor stall]]. Once the flight cleared the ash cloud, it was able to restart each engine and then made a safe landing at Anchorage, though, like ''City of Edinburgh'', it was substantially damaged.

Today, British Airways operates flight 9 from [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] to [[Suvarnabhumi Airport|Bangkok]], Thailand and [[Kingsford Smith Airport|Sydney]].

''City of Edinburgh'' continued to fly for British Airways, before being sold to [[European Aviation Air Charter]], and decommissioned in 2006 due to financial problems in that company.{{Failed verification|date=April 2007}} The last known location of the plane (by this time partially dismantled) was at [[Bournemouth Airport|Bournemouth International Airport]] in early 2007.<ref name="CAA">{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?categoryid=60&pagetype=65&applicationid=1&mode=detailnosummary&fullregmark=G-BDXH|title=GINFO Search Results | Aircraft Register | Safety Regulation|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.photos.aero/photos.php?ItemId=10488|title=Photos.aero - G-BDXH - Boeing by Barry Quince at Bournemouth, Bournemouth England|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref>
