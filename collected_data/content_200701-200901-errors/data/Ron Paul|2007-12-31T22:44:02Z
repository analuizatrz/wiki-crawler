'''Ronald Ernest "Ron" Paul''' (born [[August 20]] [[1935]]) is a [[GOP|Republican]] [[United States Congress]]man from [[Lake Jackson, Texas]], a [[physician]], and a [[United States Republican presidential candidates, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential candidate]].

Originally from [[Green Tree, Pennsylvania]], he has represented [[Texas]] districts in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] (1976–1977, 1979–1985, and 1997–present). Paul placed a distant third in the [[1988 presidential election]], running as the [[Libertarian (U.S.)|Libertarian]] nominee while remaining a registered Republican. After his 1961 graduation from [[Duke University School of Medicine]] and a residency in obstetrics and gynecology, he became a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[flight surgeon]], serving outside the [[Vietnam War]] zone.

Paul has been described as [[conservative (U.S.)|conservative]], [[Constitutionalist]], and [[libertarian]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newswithviews.com/baldwin/baldwin412.htm|title=An Appeal To My Fellow Pastors|author=Baldwin, Chuck|date=[[2007-11-06]]|accessdate=2007-11-07|publisher=[[NewsWithViews.com]]}}</ref> He advocates a [[non-interventionist]] [[foreign policy]], having voted against actions such as the [[Iraq War Resolution]], but in favor of [[force against terrorists]] in [[Afghanistan]]. He favors withdrawal from [[NATO]] and the [[United Nations]]. Having pledged never to raise taxes, he has long advocated ending the federal [[income tax (U.S.)|income tax]] and reducing government spending by abolishing most federal agencies; he favors [[hard money (policy)|hard money]] and opposes the [[Federal Reserve]]. He also opposes the [[Patriot Act]], the federal [[War on Drugs]], and [[gun control]]. Paul is strongly [[pro-life]], advocates overturning ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', and affirms [[states' rights]] to determine the legality of abortion.<ref name=rhodes/>

Throughout [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008|his 2008 presidential campaign]], Paul has been a leading candidate in [[Republican straw polls]], though he has had substantially lower numbers in [[landline]] [[opinion poll]]s. He has strong Internet support, leading in [[web search]]es and [[YouTube]] subscriptions. On [[December 16]] [[2007]], Paul had the largest one-day [[fundraiser]] in U.S. political history, raising over $6 million in 24 hours through a [[grassroots]] effort, organized independently from the official campaign.

==Early life and education==
Paul was born in [[Green Tree, Pennsylvania]], to Margaret "Peggy" Paul ([[née]] Dumont)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gedview.com/paul/individual.php?pid=I4|title=Margaret (Peggy) Dumont|author=Hinckley, David|publisher=GEDview|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> and Howard Caspar Paul,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/paul.html|title=The Ancestors of Ron Paul|accessdate=2007-05-20|author=Reitwiesner, William Addams|publisher=Wargs}}</ref> the second son of a [[Germany|German]] [[immigrant]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elisanders.net/ronpaul.html|title=Running on Angry|author=Sanders, Eli|publisher=Eli Sanders|work=Stranger|date=[[2007-08-09]]|accessdate=2007-10-05}}</ref> With an eighth-grade education, Howard co-owned Green Tree Dairy with his brothers Lewis and Arthur; the small-town truck farm stood just outside [[Pittsburgh]].

==Marriage and family==
While a Dormont schoolmate, Carol Wells had asked Paul to escort her to a [[sweet 16 (birthday)|sweet-16]] [[Sadie Hawkins party]], which was their first date. They kept in touch while attending colleges in different states. Over a 1956 park picnic before his senior year at Gettysburg, Paul proposed marriage to Wells; the couple were wedded on [[February 1]] [[1957]], at Dormont [[PCUSA|Presbyterian]] Church before 300 guests.<ref name=dailypaul/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://marriage.about.com/od/politics/p/ronpaul.htm|title=Carol and Ron Paul Marriage Profile|author=Stritof, Sheri, and Stritof, Bob|date=[[2007-07-25]]|accessdate=2007-11-07|publisher=[[About.com]]}}</ref>

==Military service and medical career==
Paul considered becoming a [[Lutheran]] minister like two of his brothers<ref name=seattletimes/> (Jerrold has a doctorate in counseling and attended [[Princeton Seminary]]; David pastors Trinity Lutheran Church in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]).<ref name=pulpit/><ref name=thp>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-treul/an-interview-with-ron-pau_b_71108.html|title=An Interview with Ron Paul's Brother: Spreading the Good News (But Not From the Pulpit)|author=Treul, Dan|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|work=Off the Bus|date=[[2007-11-06]]|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref> Instead he decided to pursue a medical [[doctorate]] at [[Duke University School of Medicine]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]], attaining it in 1961.

The medical training was soon interrupted when he received a [[draft (U.S.)|draft]] notice and entered the [[U.S. Air Force]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].<ref name=CSPAN>{{cite news|url=http://chbn.com/Clip.aspx?key=1CD9E3A0397BCBEC|title=Congressman Ron Paul Announces Presidential Run while taking LIVE calls on C-SPAN!|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=[[Capitol Hill]] Broadcasting Network|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|format=video|date=[[2007-03-20]]}}</ref> He remained in the military during the early years of the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Brockwell, Ian|date=[[2007-07-15]]|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=32269|title=Ron Paul — A True Patriot!|work=American Chronicle|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> He served [[active duty]] as a [[flight surgeon]] from 1963 to 1965, attending to the [[ear, nose, and throat]] problems of pilots in [[South Korea]], [[Iran]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Turkey]], but was never sent to [[Vietnam]].

==Early Congressional career==
During his early days, Paul was influenced by [[Friedrich Hayek]]’s ''[[Road to Serfdom]]'', which led him to read many works of [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]] while still a medical resident in the 1960s. He came to know economists [[Hans Sennholz]] and [[Murray Rothbard]] well and credits them with his fascination with the study of economics. On [[August 15]] [[1971]], when [[President (U.S.)|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] closed the "gold window" by implementing the [[U.S. dollar]]'s complete departure from the [[gold standard]], he says he realized what the [[Austrian School]] economists wrote was coming true.<ref name=gold/> That same day, the young physician decided to enter politics, saying later, "After that day, all money would be political money rather than money of real value. I was astounded."<ref name=texasmonthly2001/>

===Campaigns===
In 1974, alarmed at the turmoil he saw predicted by the Austrian school, Vietnam War funding, rampant inflation, and wholesale welfare,<ref name=lambda/> Paul became a delegate to the Texas Republican [[Political convention|convention]] and a Republican candidate for Congress. Incumbent [[Robert R. Casey]] defeated him in the [[TX-22|22nd district]]; Democrats won 1974 heavily. When President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Casey to head the [[Federal Maritime Commission]], Paul won an [[April 1976]] [[special election]] to fill the empty seat. Paul lost 6&nbsp;months later in the [[general election]], to Democrat [[Robert Gammage]], by fewer than 300&nbsp;votes (0.2%), but defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch and won new terms in 1980 and 1982.

Paul was the first Republican representative from the area;<ref name=campaigncom>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF-s1voM_Y|title=The Ron Paul Story|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> his successful campaign against Gammage surprised local Democrats who had expected to retain the seat easily in the wake of the [[Watergate scandal]]. Gammage underestimated Paul's support among local mothers: "I had real difficulty down in Brazoria County, where he practiced, because he'd delivered half the babies in the county. There were only two [[obstetrician]]s in the county, and the other one was his partner."<ref name=npron70s>{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15016924|title=Paul Has Long Drawn Support from Unlikely Places|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=[[2007-10-07]]|accessdate=2007-10-23|author=Goodwyn, Wade|work=The '08 Candidates' First Campaign}}</ref>

Paul continued to deliver babies on Mondays and Saturdays during his entire term as the 22nd district representative.<ref name=texasmonthly2001/> Paul was also one of only four Republican Congressmen to endorse [[Ronald Reagan]] for president against Gerald Ford in 1976,<ref name=2008bio/> when Paul led the Texas Reagan delegation at the national Republican convention.<ref name=campaigncom/>

===House of Representatives===
Paul was the first member of Congress, in the 1970s, to propose [[term limit]]s legislation in the House,<ref name=wsj1997>{{cite news|url=http://www.seedship.com/politics/ronpaul1.html|title=The Libertarian Congressman Is Back|work=Wall Street Journal|date=1997-01-13|page=A18|accessdate=2007-09-27}}</ref> where he also declined to attend junkets or register for a Congressional pension while serving four terms.<ref name=campaign1996>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n6_v17/ai_18535311|title=Paul vs. Laughlin — Ron Paul's campaign against Representative Greg Laughlin|author=Beiler, David|date=1996-06|publisher=Campaigns and Elections}}</ref> He proposed legislation to decrease Congressional pay by the rate of inflation. In 1980, when a majority of Republicans favored President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s proposal to reinstate [[Selective Service|draft registration]], he pointed out their views as inconsistent, stating they were more interested in registering their children than they were their guns.<ref name=wsj1997/>

On the [[House Banking Committee]], Paul blamed the [[Federal Reserve]] for inflation,<ref name=2008bio/> and spoke against banking deregulation that allowed for the 1980s [[savings and loan crisis]].<ref name=nytimesmagazine/> The U.S. Gold Commission created by Congress in 1982 was his and [[Jesse Helms]]'s idea, and Paul's conclusions from the commission were published by the [[Cato Institute]] as a book, ''The Case for Gold'';<ref name=gold>{{cite web|work=J.

Vote trading is seen as good politics. The errand-boy mentality is ordinary, the defender of liberty is seen as bizarre. It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic."<ref name=insight1997/>

===1996 campaign controversy===
:''Further information: [[TX-14#1996|Texas's 14th Congressional district]]''

In 1996, Paul was re-elected to Congress after a tougher battle than he had faced in the 1970s. Since the Republicans had taken over both houses of Congress in the [[United States House elections, 1994|1994 election]], Paul entered the race hopeful that his [[Constitutionalist]] goals of tax cuts, closing agencies, and curbing the UN would have more influence,<ref name=paulsneary>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_199806/ai_n8799789|title=Paul vs. Sneary|date=[[1998-06-26]]|accessdate=2007-11-18|work=Human Events}}</ref> but he quickly concluded "there was no sincere effort" toward his goals.<ref name=lambda/> The [[Republican National Committee]] focused instead on encouraging [[Democrat (U.S.)|Democrat]]s to switch parties, as Paul's primary opponent, incumbent [[Greg Laughlin]], had done in 1995. The party threw its full weight behind Laughlin, including support from House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]], Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]], and the [[National Rifle Association]]. Paul responded by running newspaper ads quoting Gingrich's harsh criticisms of Laughlin's Democratic voting record 14&nbsp;months earlier.<ref name=campaign1996/> Paul won the primary with support from baseball pitcher, constituent, and friend [[Nolan Ryan]] (who served as honorary campaign chair and made ad appearances) and tax activist [[Steve Forbes]].<ref name=nytimesmagazine/><ref name=texasmonthly2001/>

Paul's Democratic opponent in the fall election, [[trial lawyer]] Charles "Lefty" Morris, lost in a close margin, despite assistance from the [[AFL-CIO]]. Paul's large contributor base outraised Morris two-to-one, giving the third-highest amount of individual contributions received by any House member (behind Gingrich and [[Bob Dornan]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/118086.html|title=Paul for President?: The maverick libertarian Republican talks on war, immigration, and presidential ambition|accessdate=2007-05-28|author=Doherty, Brian|date=[[2007-01-22]]|work=Reason}}</ref> It became the third time Paul had been elected to Congress as a non-incumbent.<ref name=nytimesmagazine/>

Morris ran numerous attacks, including publicizing issues of the ''Ron Paul Survival Report'' (published by Paul since 1985) that included derogatory comments concerning race and other politicians.<ref>{{cite news|title=CAMPAIGN '96 U.S. HOUSE: Newsletter excerpts offer ammunition to Paul's opponent: GOP hopeful quoted on race, crime|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070512114222/http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/aol-metropolitan/96/05/23/paul.html|author=Bernstein, Alan|work=Houston Chronicle|date=[[1996-05-22]]|accessdate=2007-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Congressman Who Voted Against a Congressional Medal for Rosa Parks|journal=Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|date=Summer 1999|volume=24|pages=38-9|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=1077-3711(199922)24%3C38%3ATCWVAA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K}}</ref> Alluding to a 1992 study finding that "of black men in Washington ... about 85 percent are arrested at some point in their lives",<ref>{{cite news|author=Deparle, Jason|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D9103AF93BA25757C0A964958260&sec=&spon=|title=42% of Young Black Males Go Through Capital's Courts|work=New York Times|date=[[1992-04-18]]|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Miller, Jerome G.|date=1992|title=Hobbling a Generation: African American Males in the District of Columbia's Criminal Justice System|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=selr6BDsMNAC&pg=PA141&sig=8pLyDV8iqy0trgHViU6I0UgoizE#PPA141,M1|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref> the newsletter proposed assuming that "95% of the black males in Washington DC are semi-criminal or entirely criminal", and stated that "the criminals who terrorize our cities ... largely are" young black males, who commit crimes "all out of proportion to their numbers".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/g/ftp.py?people/g/gannon.dan/1992/gannon.0793|author=Disputed; attributed either to a ghostwriter or to Paul, Ron|date=1992|title=Los Angeles Racial Terrorism|work=et al., Ron Paul Political Report (now Ron Paul Survival Report)|quote=Black males age&nbsp;13 [were] as big, strong, tough, scary and culpable as any adult" and could be "unbelievably fleet-footed" in committing crimes; President [[Bill Clinton]] was accused of fathering [[illegitimate]] children and using [[cocaine]]; "complex embezzling" became a "100&nbsp;percent white and Asian" crime; the Israeli government was labeled a powerful Washington lobby "of the bad sort.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/vol16/issue9/pols.paul.side.html|title=Totally Paul-ly (sidebar)|author=de Marban, Alex|publisher=Austin Chronicle|date=[[1996-11-01]]|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref>

In 2001, Paul took "moral responsibility" for the comments printed in his newsletter under his name, telling ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' magazine that the comments were written by an unnamed [[ghostwriter]] and did not represent his views.

===Campaigns as an incumbent===
:''Further information: [[Texas's 14th Congressional district]]''

In 1998 and again in 2000, Paul defeated [[Loy Sneary]], a Democratic rice farmer and former [[Matagorda County]] judge, by running ads warning voters to be "leery of Sneary."<ref name=saynot/><ref name=texasmonthly2001/> Paul accused Sneary of voting to raise his pay by 5%, increasing his travel allotment by 400% in one year, and using increased taxes to start a new government bureaucracy to handle a [[license plate]] fee he enacted. Sneary's aides said he had voted to raise all county employees' pay by 5% in a [[cost-of-living increase]]. Paul countered that he had never voted to raise Congressional pay.<ref name=paulsneary/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story.mpl/content/chronicle/metropolitan/98/08/15/notebook.2-0.html|title=Foes lock horns over Paul's radio ads|accessdate=2007-05-26|date=1998-08-14|work=Campaign Notebook|publisher=Houston Chronicle}}</ref>

Between 2001 and 2003, an online grassroots petition to draft Ron Paul for the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] garnered several thousand signatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petitiononline.com/Paul2004/petition.html|title=Ron Paul for President 2004|author=Allan, Sterling D.|publisher=Petition Online}}</ref> On [[December 11]] [[2001]], Paul told the independent movement that he was encouraged by the fact that the petition had spread the message of Constitutionalism, but did not expect a White House win at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040806232944/www.paul2004.com/RonsResponse/index.html|title=Ron Paul's Response to "Ron Paul for President 2004" Petition|author=Allan, Sterling D.|publisher=DRAFT Ron Paul for United States President 2004|date=[[2001-12-11]]|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> Further prompting in early 2007 led Paul to enter the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 race]].

===Relationship with district===
After [[2003 Texas redistricting]], Paul's district is larger than [[Massachusetts]],<ref name=washpost96>{{cite news|title=GOP House Candidate Responds to Charges|accessdate=2007-09-11|author=Pressley, Sue Ann|date=1996-05-26|work=Washington Post}}</ref> with 675&nbsp;miles (1,100&nbsp;kilometers) of [[Gulf of Mexico]] coastline between [[Houston]] and [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], covering some 22&nbsp;counties. Even so, Paul opposes programs like [[National Flood Insurance Program|federally funded flood insurance]] (typically supported by coastal and rural representatives) because it requires those outside flood zones to subsidize those within, but prohibits those within from choosing their own insurers. In an overwhelmingly rural region known for ranching and rice farms,<ref name=gold/> Paul opposes farm subsidies because they are paid to large corporations rather than small farmers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,252847,00.html|title=Ron Paul, the Real Republican?|author=Balko, Radley|date=[[2007-02-20]]|accessdate=2007-11-06|publisher=[[Fox News]]|work=Straight Talk}}</ref> Despite his voting against heavily supported legislation like [[farm bill]]s, Paul's devotion to reducing government resonates with 14th district voters:<ref name=texasmonthly2001/> in a survey, 54% of his constituency agreed with his goal of eliminating the [[U.S. Department of Education]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst97/tst072097.htm|title=Parents must have control of education|accessdate=2007-09-13|author=Paul, Ron|date=1997-07-20|work=Texas Straight Talk|publisher=House of Representatives}}</ref>

While Paul votes against most spending bills, he has diverted funds that have already been authorized by other bills into his own district.<ref name=wsj2003>{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB104725224693862700.html|title=A Far-Right Texan Inspires Antiwar Left|accessdate=2007-06-15|author=Murray, Shailagh|date=2003-03-10|work=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Paul also spends extra time in the district to compensate for "violat[ing] almost every rule of political survival you can think of".<ref name=texasmonthly2001/> He often logs over 300&nbsp;miles (500&nbsp;kilometers) daily, and attends civic ceremonies for veterans, graduates, and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], often accompanied by his grandchildren. His staff helps senior citizens obtain free or low-cost prescription drugs through a little-known drug company program; procures lost or unreceived medals for war veterans; is known for its effectiveness in tracking down [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] checks; and sends out birthday and condolence cards.<ref name=texasmonthly2001/><ref name=wsj2003/>

Paul continued delivering his constituents' babies even while serving in Congress. In 2001, he was one of only eight doctors in the House; even fewer continued to practice while in office. He is occasionally approached by younger area residents to thank him for attending their births.<ref name=texasmonthly2001/>

===Legislation===
{{main|Legislation sponsored by Ron Paul}}
Paul sponsors many more bills than the average representative, such as those that would abolish the [[income tax (U.S.)|income tax]]<ref name=endirs/> or the [[Federal Reserve]]; many do not reach the House floor for a vote. Nevertheless, he has been named one of the "50&nbsp;Most Effective Members of Congress" by ''Congressional Quarterly''.<ref name=ronpaulis>{{cite web|url=http://www.ronpaulforcongress.com/html/ronpaulis.html|title=Ron Paul Is…|accessdate=2007-06-15|publisher=Ron Paul for Congress}}</ref> He has sponsored successful legislation to prevent the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] from seizing a church in New York through [[eminent domain]], and a bill transferring ownership of the [[Lake Texana]] dam project from the federal government to Texas.<ref name=texasmonthly2001/> By successfully amending other legislation, he has also barred International Criminal Court jurisdiction over the U.S. military (2002), American participation in any U.N. "global tax" (2005), and surveillance on peaceful First Amendment activities by citizens (2006).<ref>{{cite news|title=Paul says Americans' freedoms under siege|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1007/6277_Page2.html|author=Bresnahan, John|publisher=Politico|date=2007-10-10|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref>

Paul has introduced bills that would apply a $5,000 tax credit per child towards spending on any type of children's education–related expenses, [[public education|public]], [[Private education#North America|private]], or [[homeschool]]. He has introduced the [[Family Education Freedom Act]] in every Congressional session since 1997; the bill currently has six co-sponsors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hslda.org/legislation/national/2001/HR368/default.asp|title=H.R. 368 — Family Education Freedom Act of 2001|accessdate=2007-09-13|date=2002-06-27|publisher=Home School Legal Defense Association}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/110_HR_1056.html|title=H.R. 1056, The Family Education Freedom Act of 2007|accessdate=2007-09-13|publisher=Washington Watch}}</ref> He has also introduced companion legislation in the form of the [[Teacher Tax Cut Act]], which would provide all elementary and secondary school teachers with a $1,000 tax cut, and the Professional Educators Tax Relief Act, which would give all [[K–12 education|K–12]] school librarians, counselors, and other personnel the same $1,000 tax credit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2003/cr021103d.htm|title=Teacher Tax Cut Act|accessdate=2007-09-14|publisher=House of Representatives|work=Congressional Record}}</ref> He has also introduced the [[Education Improvement Tax Cut Act]], which would allow $5,000 deductions for any type of donations to scholarships or to benefit academics at any school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationpolicy.org/newsletter/EEMar99.htm|title=Rep.

In [[March 2001]], Paul introduced the "Constitutional War Powers Resolution of 2001," which would repeal the 1973 [[War Powers Resolution]] (WPR) and thus prohibit presidents from initiating a war without a formal [[declaration of war by Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22022|title=Bill would restore Congress' war powers|accessdate=2007-06-13|author=Dougherty, Jon|date=2001-03-13|work=WorldNetDaily}}</ref> Later in 2001, Paul voted for the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]], which authorized the president, pursuant to WPR, to respond to those responsible for the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]].<ref name=AUMF/> In order to prevent Congress from yielding its Constitutional authority to declare war to the executive branch, which does not Constitutionally hold that power, Paul introduced legislation in October 2002 giving Congress the opportunity to declare war on [[Iraq]], rather than merely "authorizing" the president to deploy forces without a declaration of war. He said he would not vote for his own bill, but if his fellow members of Congress wished to go to war in Iraq, they should follow the Constitution and declare war. As one of six Republicans to vote against the Iraq War Resolution, Paul inspired the founding of a group called the National Peace Lobby Project to promote a resolution he and Oregon representative [[Peter DeFazio]] sponsored to repeal the war authorization in February 2003. His speech, 35&nbsp;"Questions That Won't Be Asked About Iraq,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr091002.htm|title=Questions That Won't Be Asked About Iraq|accessdate=2007-07-12|author=Paul, Ron|date=2002-09-10|publisher=House of Representatives|work=Congressional Record}}</ref> was translated and published in German, French, Russian, Italian, and Swiss periodicals before the Iraq War began.<ref name=wsj2003/>

Paul says his fellow members of Congress have increased government spending by 75% during [[George W. Bush]]'s administration.<ref name=endirs/> After a 2005 bill was touted as "slashing" government waste, Paul wrote that it decreased spending by a fraction of one percent and that "Congress couldn't slash spending if the members' lives depended on it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul287.html|title=Too Little Too Late|accessdate=2007-06-13|author=Paul, Ron|date=2005-11-15|publisher=Lew Rockwell}}</ref> Paul said that between 2001 and early 2004 he had voted against more than 700&nbsp;bills intended to expand government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/yates/yates92.html|title=An Evening With Dr. Ron Paul|accessdate=2007-09-27|author=Yates, Ph.D., Steven|date=2004-04-07|publisher=Lew Rockwell}}</ref>

Paul charged his fellow legislators with voting for the Patriot Act without reading it first; more than 300&nbsp;pages long, it was enacted into law less than 24&nbsp;hours after being introduced. In response to such Congressional actions, Paul introduced "Sunlight Rule" legislation, which would not allow votes on legislation to occur until ten days after its introduction, with the intent of giving lawmakers enough time to read bills before voting on them. The bill requires allotting 72&nbsp;hours for House members and staff to examine the contents of amendments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2007/tst091607.htm|title=The Sunlight Rule|accessdate=2007-09-27|author=Paul, Ron|date=2007-09-16|publisher=House of Representatives|work=Texas Straight Talk}}</ref>

In 2005 and 2007, Paul introduced the Sanctity of Life Act, which would remove federal court jurisdiction over abortion cases arising from state laws and effectively negate ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' as binding legal precedent. Also, for the purposes of [[statutory construction]] over the jurisdictional limitation imposed, the bill declares that "human life shall be deemed to exist from conception."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.1094.IH:|title=Sanctity of Life Act of 2007|publisher=Thomas}}</ref><ref name=lifeliberty/> Paul has also introduced a Constitutional amendment with similar intent. Such laws would permit states to declare abortion to be murder and to outlaw new fetal stem cell research and some contraception and fertility treatments.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sealover, E|date=2007-07-16|url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/abortion_24888___article.html/colorado_group.html|title=Ballot initiative would outlaw abortion|work=Colorado Springs Gazette}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Stevens, A|date=2007-06-10|url=http://www.connectsavannah.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A313|title='Missing angels' or misogyny?|work=Women's eNews|publisher=Connect Savannah}}</ref> Also in 2005 and 2007, Paul introduced the [[We the People Act]], which would forbid all federal courts from hearing cases on [[abortion]], [[same-sex marriage]], sexual practices, and government display of religious symbols, texts, and images.

On [[October 15]] [[2007]], Paul introduced the American Freedom Agenda Act of 2007, which would "bar the use of evidence obtained through torture; require that federal intelligence gathering is conducted in accordance with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA); create a mechanism for challenging presidential signing statements; repeal the Military Commissions Act, which, among other things, denies habeas corpus to certain detainees; prohibit kidnapping, detentions, and torture abroad; protect journalists who publish information received from the executive branch; and ensure that secret evidence is not used to designate individuals or organizations with a presence in the U.S. as foreign terrorists."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2165/t/1027/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=17371&t=|publisher=American Freedom Campaign|date=2007-10-15|accessdate=2007-10-15|title=Tell your U.S. Representative to co-sponsor the American Freedom Agenda Act}}</ref>

===Affiliations===
Paul serves on the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] (having been on the Western Hemisphere and the Asia and Pacific subcommittees); the [[Joint Economic Committee]]; and the [[Committee on Financial Services]] (as Ranking Member of the Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade and Technology subcommittee, and Vice-Chair of the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee).<ref name=officialbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/bio.shtml|title=Who is Ron Paul?|accessdate=2007-09-27|publisher=House of Representatives}}</ref>

===Actions in Congress===
Paul was on a bipartisan coalition of 17&nbsp;members of Congress that sued President Bill Clinton in 1999 over his conduct of the [[Kosovo]] war. They accused Clinton of failing to inform Congress of the action's status within 48&nbsp;hours as required by WPR, and of failing to obtain Congressional declaration of war as specifically required in the Constitution. Congress had voted 427–2 against a declaration of war with [[Yugoslavia]], and had voted to deny support for the air campaign in Kosovo. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that since Congress had voted for funding after Clinton had actively engaged troops in the war with Kosovo, legislators had sent a confusing message about whether they approved of the war. Paul said that the judge's decision attempted to circumvent the Constitution and to authorize the president to conduct a war without approval from Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press99/pr060999.htm|title=Judge sides with Clinton|accessdate=2007-06-12|author=Paul, Ron|date=1999-06-09|publisher=House of Representatives}}</ref>

=== Grassroots support ===

The Ron Paul Revolution (also known as the Ron Paul: R[evol]ution, R-love-ution, and R-evol-ution) is a term coined to represent the [[grass roots]] supporters of 2008 presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]]. When Dr. Paul delivers a speech, the audience members are often seen wearing "RON PAUL REVOLUTION" t-shirts.<ref>http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1678661,00.html</ref> "Paulites tend to be tech-savvy, tired of traditional politics and suspicious of their government and the mainstream media. Consisting of Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians and Constitution Party followers uniting behind some or all of the Paul libertarian agenda -- ending the war in Iraq, abolishing gun control laws, legalizing marijuana and dismantling big hunks of the U.S. government, especially the IRS and Federal Reserve system."<ref>http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1678661,00.html</ref> His supporters, comprising of over 100,000 friends on MySpace.com and over 82,000 supporters on Meetup.com, have collectively have planned or held nearly 21,000 offline events to rally support (and raise money) for their candidate.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://blog.compete.com/2007/12/19/presidential-candidates-facetime-ron-paul-mike-huckabee-john-edwards-hillary-clinton/|title=Candidate FaceTime in November: Meetup.com is Ron Paul’s Secret Weapon|accessdate=2007-12-25}}</ref> When asked about the "Revolution" Ron Paul answered, "It’s an ideological revolution," that he opposed violence and esteemed the teachings of [[Dr. Martin Luther King]] and [[Gandhi]] that civil disobedience should be used to bring about social change. On December 16th, 2007, the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, Ron Paul supporters made history by raising 6 million dollars in a 24 hour period- more money than any candidate has raised in a single day in U.S. political history. <ref>http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2007-12-17-ronpaul-fundraising_N.htm</ref>
