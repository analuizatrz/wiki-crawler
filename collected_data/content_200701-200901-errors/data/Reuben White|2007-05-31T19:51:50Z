'''Reuben White'''(abt 1779 &ndash; [[January 6]] [[1858]]) was a farmer, businessman and political figure in [[Upper Canada]].

He was likely born in [[Schoharie County|Schoharie County, New York]], in 1779, the son of William White and Hannah Tompkins. The family moved to Upper Canada and settled in [[Hastings County, Ontario|Sidney Township, Hastings County, Ontario]] about 1800. His father and some siblings became Quakers in [[Upper Canada]] but it is clear that Reuben did not. He was not a [[United Empire Loyalist]] though he married Esther Marsh who was a daughter of Loyalist, Matthias Marsh.

Early on he was a farmer along the shore of the [[Bay of Quinte]]. In 1820, White was elected to the 8th [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]] session for [[Hastings County, Ontario|Hastings]]. He was reelected in the 9th and 11th Legislative Assemblies.

In 1833 he was one of the Commissioners who received tenders for the construction of a 750 foot long [[covered bridge]] spanning the mouth of the [[Trent River]] at [[Trenton, Ontario]], called Port Trent at the time. He was a tavern owner as evidenced by the fact that he paid a tavern licence fee in 1837. In 1841 he sold one acre of land from his farm for the construction of a large frame Methodist church known as “White’s Church” and capable of holding 1000 people.  An 1855 map indicates a saw mill on his land.

His son-in-law, [[Henry Yager|Henry W Yager]] followed him by being elected to the 12th [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]].

Following the [[1837 Rebellion]] he was arrested in December of that year on a charge of insurrection or treason  but released  in early January and the trial never occurred.

He is buried in White’s Cemetery, near his farm, and has a tall column headstone demonstrating his prominence in the community.
