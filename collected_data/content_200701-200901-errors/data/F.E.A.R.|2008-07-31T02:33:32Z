'''''F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon''''' is a [[survival horror]] [[first-person shooter]] developed by [[Monolith Productions]] and published by [[Vivendi]]. It was released on [[October 17]], [[2005]], for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]],<ref name="date1" /> and ported by [[Day 1 Studios]] to the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]].<ref name=ps3>{{cite web | last=Surette | first=Tim | date=2007-03-29 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/fear/news.html?sid=6168265&mode=news |title=Europe feels the ''F.E.A.R.'' early | work=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate = 2007-04-20}}</ref> [[Timegate Studios]] has released two [[expansion pack]]s, ''[[F.E.A.R.

A direct sequel, ''[[Project Origin]]'', which ignores ''Perseus Mandate'' and ''Extraction point'', was announced by Monolith Productions.<ref name="sequel">{{cite web | last=Surette | first=Tim | date=2006-02-21 | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/6144629.html | title = Monolith scaring up new ''F.E.A.R.''s | work=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate = 2006-10-02}}</ref>

The game's story revolves around a supernatural phenomenon, which [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#F.E.A.R. Team|F.E.A.R.]]—a fictional [[special forces]] team—is called to contain. The player assumes the role of F.E.A.R.'s [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#The Point Man (main character)|Point Man]], who possesses superhuman reflexes and combats an army of [[Cloning|cloned]] soldiers, and at the same time uncovers the secrets of a paranormal menace in the form of a little girl.

''F.E.A.R.'' was well-received by critics, scoring 89% on [[Game Rankings]],<ref name=gamerankings3>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/920744.asp?q=F.E.A.R. | title=''F.E.A.R.''

The DVD included a "Making of" documentary, a director's commentary, a short [[live-action]] prequel and the exclusive first episode of the promotional ''[[PANICS|P.A.N.I.C.S.]]'' [[machinima]]. A
related [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] [[comic book]] was also packaged with the DVD. Along with the Director's Edition, ''F.E.A.R. Gold Edition'' was released. Gold Edition included the Director's Edition and ''Extraction Point''. ''F.E.A.R. Platinum Edition'' features the original game and two expansion packs.

==Gameplay==
''F.E.A.R.'' simulates combat from a [[first person (video games)|first person perspective]]. The protagonist's body is fully present, allowing the player to see his or her character's torso and feet while looking down. Within scripted sequences, when rising from a lying position or [[fast-roping]] from a helicopter for example, or climbing ladders, the hands and legs of the protagonist can be seen performing the relevant actions.

[[Image:FEAR screenshot3.png|thumb|250px|left|The player character uses reflex time while firing on a group of soldiers.]]

A prominent gameplay element is "[[Bullet time|reflex time]]," which slows down the game world while allowing the player to aim and react at normal speeds. This effect is used to simulate the character's superhuman reflexes. Reflex time is represented by stylized visual effects, such as bullets in flight that cause air distortion or interact with the game's [[visual effects|particle effects]]. ''F.E.A.R.'' lead designer Craig Hubbard stated that Monolith Productions' primary goal was "to make combat as intense as the tea house shootout at the beginning of [[John Woo]]'s ''[[Hard-Boiled]]''." He continued on to say that "defeat[ing] ... enemies ... with style" was crucial to this goal and that reflex time plays a large role in "mak[ing] the player feel like they are an action movie hero."<ref name=eurogamer>{{cite web | last=Bramwell | first=Tom | date=2005-10-12 | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=61255 | title= The ''F.E.A.R.'' Effect | work=[[Eurogamer]] | accessdate = 2006-10-04}}</ref>

The game contains weapons based on non-fictional firearms, such as [[pistol]]s, [[assault rifle]]s and [[submachine gun]]s, as well as entirely [[science fiction|fictional]] armaments like [[particle beam weapon]]s. Each firearm differs in terms of ammunition type, accuracy, range, fire rate, damage and bulkiness. The latter characteristic is crucial, as more powerful/specialized weapons tend to be more cumbersome and slow the player's maneuvers. Unlike other games of the genre where lighter/smaller weapons tend to be useless, ''F.E.A.R.'' does not scale guns on a curve, so any firearm is potentially deadly in most situations. Monolith Productions stated that it aimed for "''a balanced arsenal where each weapon serves a specific function,''" rather than "''just going with a bunch of real-world submachine guns and assault rifles.''"<ref name=gamespotinterview>{{cite web | date=2005-04-01 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/fear/news.html?sid=6121461&mode=previews | title=''F.E.A.R.'' Q&A - Story, Weapons, Multiplayer | work=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate = 2006-10-04}}</ref> ''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]] crosshair's size dynamically shows where shots will fall based on movement, aim and the weapon in use. The player may carry only three firearms at a time; thus, strategy is required when using and selecting weapons.

Compared to other shooters where [[Mêlée#Use in gameplay|mêlée]] is usually a last resort, ''F.E.A.R.'s'' mêlée is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms can be used in [[Pistol-whipping|close combat]]. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to move around more quickly, increasing their chances of mêlée. Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which also allows them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.

''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[artificial intelligence]] allows computer-controlled characters a large degree of action. Enemies can duck to travel under crawlspaces, jump through windows, vault over railings, climb ladders and push over large objects to create cover. Various opponents may act as a team, taking back routes to surprise the player, using [[suppressive fire]] or taking cover if under fire. The game's artificial intelligence is often cited as being highly advanced,<ref name="FEAR-AI">{{cite web | last = Orkin | first = Jeff | title = Three States and a Plan: The A.I. of ''F.E.A.R.'' | work = Game Developers Conference 2006 | date = 2006-03-23 | url = http://www.jorkin.com/gdc2006_orkin_jeff_fear.doc | format = [[DOC (computing)|DOC]] | accessdate = 2006-10-04 }}</ref><ref name="FEAR-AI3">{{cite web | title = Assaulting ''F.E.A.R.''’s AI: 29 Tricks to Arm Your Game | work = AIGameDev | url = http://aigamedev.com/reviews/fear-ai | accessdate = 2008-02-15 }}</ref> and its efficiency helped the game win [[GameSpot]]'s "2005 Best AI Award,"<ref name="FEAR-AI2">{{cite web | title = GameSpot's 2005 Best AI Award | work = GameSpot | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pages/features/bestof2005/index.php?day=2&page=10 | accessdate = 2006-10-11 }}</ref> and earn the #2 ranking on [[AIGameDev]]'s "Most Influential AI Games."<ref name="FEAR-AI4">{{cite web | title = Top 10 Most Influential AI Games | work = AIGameDev | url = http://aigamedev.com/reviews/top-ai-games | accessdate = 2008-02-15 }}</ref>

===Multiplayer===
''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s multiplayer component includes mainstay gameplay modes, such as [[Deathmatch (gaming)|Deathmatch]], Team deathmatch, [[Capture the flag]] and [[Last man standing (gaming)|Last man standing]].<ref name="manual">"''F.E.A.R. - First Encounter Assault Recon''" game manual (2005)</ref> "Control" and "Conquer All" gametypes were later added through a [[patch (computing)|patch]]. Some gametypes in ''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s multiplayer utilize the "reflex time" effect: SlowMo Deathmatch, SlowMo Team deathmatch and SlowMo Capture the flag. Only one player can use carry the reflex [[power-up]], when fully charged they can activate it and give themselves (and the rest of their team if applicable) a speed advantage over opposing players. However, the one carrying the power-up will have a bluish glow, and they will show up on a foe's HUD.<ref name="manual"/>

On [[August 17]] [[2006]], ''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s multiplayer component was retitled ''F.E.A.R. Combat'' and made available for free download.<ref name=gs>{{cite web | last=Thorsen | first=Tor | date=2006-08-17 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/fear/news.html?sid=6155996 | title=''F.E.A.R.

The PC version of the game uses the [[PunkBuster]] program to prevent [[Cheating in online games|cheating]]. However, in December 2007, [[Even Balance]] discontinued PunkBuster support for ''F.E.A.R.'' in favor of the second expansion, ''[[F.E.A.R.

Retail/Combat - DS-Game Solutions Forum | accessdate = 2008-01-17}}</ref>  While PunkBuster-enabled servers will still check for and protect against known cheats, the program will no longer automatically update. Because of this, many players with an outdated version of PunkBuster are unable to play in PunkBuster-enabled servers without being automatically kicked from the game.<ref name="punkbuster2">{{cite web | date=2007-12-24 | url=http://www.techspot.com/vb/topic95133.html | title=PB INIT failure (FEAR COMBAT) temporal fix | accessdate = 2008-01-17}}</ref>  However, this can be fixed by disabling PunkBuster security with an in-game command, or by downloading the latest PunkBuster files from a third-party source.

The [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] versions, just like the PC edition, only have online multiplayer. There is no split-screen local play.

==Atmosphere==
A core element of ''F.E.A.R.'' is its horror theme, which was heavily inspired by [[Japanese horror]].<ref name=designerdiary>{{cite web | date=2005-10-04 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/fear/news.html?sid=6134936&mode=previews | title=Music to your ''F.E.A.R.''s | work=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate = 2006-10-04}}</ref> The design team attempted to keep "[the] psychology of the encounter" in the player's mind at all times, in order to "get under [the player's] skin", as opposed to the "in your face 'monsters jumping out of closets' approach".<ref name=fearpreviewign>{{cite web | date=2005-10-04 | url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/653/653534p1.html | title=Level design - it's scary | work=[[IGN]] | accessdate = 2006-10-04}}</ref> Lead designer Craig Hubbard stated in an interview that "horror is extremely fragile ... you can kill it by spelling things out too clearly and you can undermine it with too much ambiguity". He remarked that he attempted to strike a balance with the narrative elements of ''F.E.A.R.'', to give players "enough clues so that [they] can form [their] own theories about what's going on, but ideally [they will] be left with some uncertainty".<ref name="gamespotinterview" /> Lead level designer John Mulkey stated, "Creating expectation and then messing with that expectation is extremely important, predictability ruins a scary mood".<ref name="fearpreviewign" />

[[Image:CorridorAlma.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The player may find himself inside visions created by an unknown force.]]
The main source of the game's horror is Alma, a ghostly little girl. Craig Hubbard remarked that "a guy in a mask chasing [[co-ed]]s with a meat cleaver can be scary, but on some level you're thinking to yourself you could probably kick his ass if you got the drop on him...but when a spooky little girl takes out an entire Delta Force squad, how are you supposed to deal with that?"<ref name="eurogamer" /> While Alma has been compared to the character [[Samara Morgan|Samara]] from ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'',<ref name=firingsquad>{{cite web | last=Todd | first=Brett | date=2005-10-23 | url=http://www.firingsquad.com/games/fear_review/ | title=''F.E.A.R.'' review at FiringSquad | work=FiringSquad | accessdate = 2006-10-09}}</ref><ref name=gamespy>{{cite web | last=Kuo | first=Li C. |date=2006-05-04 | url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/fear/705001p1.html | title=''F.E.A.R.'' Official for Xbox 360 | accessdate = 2007-06-27}}</ref> Craig Hubbard stated that she "''was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts''" and not "''as an answer to any specific movie character.''"<ref name="eurogamer" /> Hubbard acknowledged that Alma "admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in ''[[Dark Water (2002 film)|Dark Water]]'' or ''Séance''," but "creepy little girls have been freaking [him] out since ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''".<ref name="eurogamer" /> 

''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s audio was designed in the style of Japanese horror films, with the sound engineers using inexpensive equipment to create sound effects, utilizing methods including dragging metal across different surfaces and recording pump sounds.<ref name="designerdiary" /> Monolith Productions commented, "The sound designers had to be concerned with avoiding predictability," since "[l]isteners are smart ... they will recognize your formula quickly and then you won't be able to scare them anymore."<ref name="designerdiary" /> Silence was also utilized in order to "allow players to fill in the space, which lets their imagination create their own personal horror".<ref name="designerdiary" />

Monolith Productions composed ''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s music in reaction to scenes, instead of "creating a formula that would consistently produce music throughout the game".<ref name="designerdiary" /> The design team called ''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s music structure "more cerebral and tailored to each individual event", and continued that "sometimes the music is used to ratchet up the tension to toy with players ... [it] will build to a terrifying crescendo before cutting off without a corresponding event, only to later have the silence shattered by Alma, when players least expect it."<ref name="designerdiary" />

''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s horror theme was praised by critics. ''[[Game Informer]]'' claimed that "...&nbsp;the frequent spooky head trips that Monolith has so skillfully woven together make an experience that demands to be played."<ref name=gameinformer>{{cite web | url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/9FA7ADDB-EA75-454E-AA1A-6EF52A4DFF0A.htm?CS_pid=645831 | title=''Game Informer'' review of ''F.E.A.R.'' | work=''[[Game Informer]]'' | accessdate = 2006-10-04}}</ref> [[IGN]] opined that "the environment has been so well-crafted to keep you edgy and watchful ... [that] playing the game for a few hours straight can get a little draining." [[GameSpot]] reacted similarly, calling ''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s horror "exceedingly effective," and agreeing that it "can leave you a bit emotionally exhausted after a while."

==Synopsis==
===Plot===
The story of ''F.E.A.R.'' is presented in such a way that only a few minor plot elements are presented in the game's beginning, thus allowing players to experience the adventure as "the hero[es] in [their] own spine-tingling epic of action, tension and terror."<ref name="sierra">{{cite web | title = ''F.E.A.R.''

Laptops found during the course of the mission, hacked by Commissioner Betters, provide details regarding the background story, as do voice-mail messages.

The manual briefly mentions the player character's recent induction as "[[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Point Man (main character)|Point Man]]" to [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#F.E.A.R. Team|F.E.A.R.]], a secret special operations group of the [[United States of America|U.S.]] government specialized in dealing with [[paranormal]] threats. The character's extraordinarily reactive reflexes are described as well, hinting that the government is interested in his abilities.<ref name="manual"/> 

When the game begins, the player witnesses a man named [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Paxton Fettel|Paxton Fettel]] taking command of a [[battalion]] of [[Telepathy|telepathically]] controlled clone [[supersoldier]]s, seizing control of the [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC)|Armacham Technology Corporation]] (ATC) structure and killing all its occupants.<ref>'''Genevieve Aristide''': There was an uprising. Fettel has taken command of the prototypes.</ref>

Now fully in control of the Point Man, the player attends a briefing held by [[Commissioner]] [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#"Rowdy" Betters|Betters]], in the company of his F.E.A.R. team-mates [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Spen Jankowski|Jankowski]] and [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Jin Sun-Kwon|Jin Sun-Kwon]].

He's the key. If we contain him, we contain the situation.'' / '''Jin Sun-Kwon''': ''What's his story?'' / '''Betters''': ''Property of Armacham Technology Corporation.

Fettel was one of the commanders.''</ref> <!-- FAIR USE of FEAR_screenshot2.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:FEAR_screenshot2.png for rationale -->

After initially eluding the Point Man at an asylum in the Auburn industrial district, Fettel is located by means of a [[satellite]] tracking device, so the F.E.A.R. operatives and a Delta Force team attempt to apprehend him at the docks.<ref>'''Jin Sun-Kwon''': ''How do we find him?'' / '''Betters''': ''That's easy. He's got a transmitter embedded in his head that'll lead us right to him.''</ref> However, the Special Forces are inexplicably wiped out by some supernatural force<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYeMngN_l3k&feature=related]</ref>, leaving behind only the F.E.A.R. operatives, who search the water treatment plant but Fettel successfully evades capture. 

Delta Force later assaults Armacham Headquarters, but again only the Point Man survives. He frees and extracts Aldus Bishop, though he cannot escape himself due to resistance from ATC security. The Point Man enters the ATC executive building in search of scientist Harlan Wade and locates another hostage, his daughter Alice. On the way to the roof, the two get separated and the helicopter expected to rendezvous with them is unexpectedly shot down. Alice flees on her own to the Auburn District, seeking her father Harlan, so the F.E.A.R. team follows her.

The player learns that Fettel was raised to become a telepathic military commander<ref>'''Betters (reading from an ATC laptop)''': ''Well, this confirms the point of Perseus was to train telepathic commanders to work with cloned soldiers, although Paxton Fettel was the only commander of the program. The weird thing is they refer to him as the second prototype.''</ref> as part of ATC project [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Project Origin|Origin]]. He is the son of Alma, who is described as being a powerful psychic.<ref>'''Betters (reading from an ATC laptop)''': ''More info on Origin: the genetic reference they used for the program was apparently a powerful psychic. Makes sense. If you want a telepathic commander, you need a telepath. And it was a woman. Says here she gave live birth to the prototypes. Seems Wade wasn't convinced the psychic characteristics were genetic. He figured there was better chance they'd be passed along if the fetus gestated inside the subject. So they put her in a coma, made her carry a genetically engineered baby to term, then induced labor.''</ref> The player also learns of the existence of another child of Alma, who was born before Fettel.<ref>'''Betters (reading from an ATC laptop)''': ''Here's some more info about Fettel: he's developed as part of a project called Origin. It says the first prototype didn't work out, Fettel was the second, and there was never a third. They just pulled the plug a few years after he was born.''</ref>

All clues lead F.E.A.R. to believe Fettel is under control of Alma,<ref>'''Betters (reading from an ATC laptop)''': ''I figured out what a synchronicity event is. There was an incident when they lost control of Fettel, he just suddenly started freaking out. He was only about ten years old at the time, but I guess he killed a few people. In the investigation, they discovered that there had been a telepathic link between Fettel and Alma even though she was in a coma. They concluded that she was influencing him. That's must've been why they pulled the plug on Origin.''</ref> who was buried within the Origin facility when ATC closed down the project because of the danger posed by the woman. Now the villain is searching for that same facility to free his mother.<ref>'''Betters''': ''It's starting to make sense. The name of the woman they used for Origin is Alma. That's who Fettel's looking for.''</ref> At an abandoned industrial compound in the Auburn District, the Point Man discovers the hidden entrance to the facility, after fighting back both the clone soldiers and ATC, whose [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#ATC Security Guards|security agents]] have received orders to cover up the whole affair.<ref>'''Betters (reading from an ATC laptop)''': ''She was just a kid. Says here Alma was eight years old when Origin started up. They used a little girl. No wonder they're so fucking anxious to keep a lid on this mess.''</ref> When the protagonist finally comes face-to-face with Fettel, he is drawn into a hallucination where the player learns that the Point Man is Alma's first son.<ref>'''Fettel''': ''We are brothers, you and I. [...] You and I were born from the same mother.''</ref> After this hallucination, the player is able to kill Fettel. Nonetheless, Alma is freed when her storage chamber is opened by an ATC researcher, [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Harlan Wade|Harlan Wade]], who feels guilty about the company's treatment of her;<ref>'''Wade''': ''They want to destroy her. But I think she's suffered enough. We put her in there two days before her eighth birthday.

In the aftermath of the detonation, a Delta Force UH-60 Black Hawk extracts the Point Man from the rubble. While the player and the survivors of the F.E.A.R team survey the results of the explosion from the helicopter, Alma makes one last appearance, preparing to pull herself up into the helicopter's cabin. The destruction of the Origin Facility has not stopped her quest for revenge.<ref>'''Holiday''': ''We still don't know the extent of the damage.'' / '''Jin Sun-Kwon''': ''We haven't been able to get through to anyone since the explosion.

After the game's credits, the player can listen to a phone call between a mysterious senator and ATC President [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Genevieve Aristide|Aristide]], which offers some further explanation: The president considers the project under control and deems the first prototype (apparently the Point Man) a success.<ref>'''Genevieve Aristide''': ''I just wanted to assure you that the Origin situation has been resolved.'' / '''Senator''': ''But so much for discretion.'' / '''Genevieve Aristide''': ''It was unavoidable. There is some good news, however: the first prototype was a complete success.''</ref>

===Characters and organizations===
{{main|List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations}}
During the course of the game, the player interacts with a number of different characters from various organizations. Some of them are allies, such as the F.E.A.R. and Delta Force team members, while others are hostile, such as Fettel's soldiers and some ATC personnel. The player's character never speaks, and instead participates in one-sided discussions with other characters. On occasion, the Point Man is required to hand a communicator to other characters, allowing them to speak over the F.E.A.R. team radio. No artificial intelligence–controlled characters fight alongside the player in ''F.E.A.R.'', except for some sequences in the expansions ''Extraction Point'' and ''Perseus Mandate''.

Also included is the exclusive first episode of the ''F.E.A.R.'' machinima, ''[[PANICS|P.A.N.I.C.S.]]'', created by "[[Rooster Teeth Productions]]". 

Over the course of the "Developer's roundtable commentary," producer Chris Hewitt reveals, "''We had a whole level in the game where we had this car chase sequence [...] we spent about two months on that thing....''" "''[B]ut the car chase sequence didn't work the way we hoped it would,''" adds designer Craig Hubbard, commenting on the choice to remove that level from the game.<ref name="roundtable">{{cite video | people = [[Monolith Productions]] | title = ''F.E.A.R.''

Craig Hubbard also remarks that "''his jacket actually used to belong to another villain we had in the game named Conrad Krieg, whom we combined with Fettel pretty literally.''"<ref name="roundtable"/>

===Engine technology===
{{main|Lithtech}}

''F.E.A.R.'' is the first game developed using the newest iteration of Monolith's Lithtech engine. Codenamed "Jupiter EX," the ''F.E.A.R.'' engine is driven by a [[DirectX]] 9 renderer and has seen major advancements from its direct precursor, "Jupiter." The new engine includes both [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics and the Havok "Vehicle Kit," which adds support for common vehicle behavior.<ref name="enginetech">{{cite web | title = Jupiter EX Technology Brochure | publisher = Touchdown Entertainment | url = http://www.touchdownentertainment.com/Content/Pdf/JupiterEXDoc.pdf | accessdate = 2006-07-15 }}</ref> This latter feature goes mostly unused in ''F.E.A.R.'', as no vehicles appear outside of scripted sequences.

Graphically, ''F.E.A.R.'' utilizes [[normal mapping]] and [[parallax mapping]] to give textures a more realistic appearance; the latter is used to give the appearance of depth to flat bullet hole sprites on walls. [[Volumetric lighting]] and [[lightmap]]ping are included with the addition of a [[per-pixel lighting]] model, allowing complex lighting effects to be developed. Vertex, pixel and high-level [[shader]]s, including a host of additional special effects, are also featured in Jupiter EX.<ref name="enginetech"/>

==Reception==
Prior to release, ''F.E.A.R.'' generated large amounts of hype from [[Computer and video game journalism|computer game journalists]].<ref name="gamespotpreview2" /><ref name=1uppreview>{{cite web | last=Green | first=Jeff | date=2005-08-18 | title = ''F.E.A.R.''

[[IGN]] claimed that "''Monolith forges new shooter territory with some truly freaky elements, challenge, fun, and beauty.''"<ref name=ignreview>{{cite web | last=McNamara | first=Tom | date=2005-10-12 | url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/657/657310p1.html | title=''F.E.A.R.'' review at IGN | work=[[IGN]] | accessdate = 2006-10-09}}</ref> GameSpy praised the game's plot,<ref name=gamespyreview>{{cite web | last=Accardo | first=Sal | date=2005-10-27 | url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/fear/662327p1.html | title=''F.E.A.R.''

I knew my goal — track down a psychic, escort a corporate executive's daughter out of danger—but I didn't ever care who these people were nor did I understand their motives.''"<ref name="nyt" /> The game has also received criticism for its system requirements, which called for an extremely powerful [[Personal computer|PC]] for its time.<ref name="Gamespot"/>

''[[Maximum PC]]'' stated that "''Monolith did a great job with both the in-game sounds and the soundtrack ... the spooky audio makes exploring deserted ruins creepy, and the positional sound works to great effect; sinister noises like breaking bottles and creaking metal come from your rear channels with just the right frequency to freak you out,''" but "''after eight hours of battling the exact same opponents, in a perfectly linear environment, it’s tough to remain enthusiastic.''"<ref name=maximumpc>{{cite web | last=Smith |first=Will | date=January 2006 | url=http://www.maximumpc.com/2006/01/fear.html | title=''F.E.A.R.'' review at ''Maximum PC'' | work=[[Maximum PC]] | accessdate = 2006-10-09}}</ref> [[GameSpot]] also found the game slightly repetitive, but still called it "''quite easily one of the most intense and atmospheric games that you'll play,''"<ref name="Gamespot"/> and later awarded it their "Shooter of the Year" prize.<ref name=gsaward>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pages/features/bestof2005/index.php?day=4&page=2 | title = GameSpot's Best of 2005 - Genre Awards | work=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate = 2006-10-02}}</ref>

The [[Xbox 360]] port has also received positive reviews, almost as favorable as the PC version. The multiplayer and instant-action mode were praised for better gameplay, but the control scheme was negatively viewed. Reviews have also stated that it lacked bonus features, despite the new mission included in the game. GameSpot gave the game 8.6.<ref name=Gamespot>{{cite web | last=Ocampo|first=Jason | date=2006-11-01 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/fear/review.html?tag=tabs;reviews | title=GameSpot Xbox 360 review | work=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate = 2006-11-01}}</ref> while IGN rated it 9.1<ref name=IGN>{{cite web | last=Brudvig|first=Erik | url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/741/741860p3.html| title=Xbox 360 port review on IGN | work=[[IGN]] | accessmonthday=November | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

The [[PlayStation 3]] port received less favorable reviews than the other two versions, but still had positive reviews overall. It contained the bonus mission exclusive to the Xbox 360 port, but the chief complaints of the negative reviewers were downgraded graphics and long loading times. GameSpot has given the port a 7.1,<ref name=Gamespot>{{cite web | last=Ocampo|first=Jason | date=2007-04-26                                | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/fear/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=tabs&tag=tabs;reviews| title=GameSpot PlayStation 3 review | work=[[GameSpot]] | accessmonthday=April 26th | accessyear=2007 }}</ref> making it the second lowest rating of the ''F.E.A.R.'' franchise in GameSpot.

==Later developments==
{{main|F.E.A.R. Extraction Point|F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate|F.E.A.R. Files|Project Origin}}
Monolith Productions has announced a [[sequel]] to ''F.E.A.R.'', which will not be titled ''F.E.A.R. 2'' due to [[Vivendi]]'s ownership of the ''F.E.A.R.'' name.<ref name="sequel"/> The game will instead be called ''Project Origin'', which is a name derived from a contest to name the sequel. However, the follow-up will stay in the game's existing universe, retaining the original storyline and characters.<ref name="sequel"/> Monolith Productions will require a new publisher for the game, since they were purchased by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment]] in 2004 while development of ''F.E.A.R.'' was under way, after which Vivendi Universal was dropped as publisher.<ref name="sequel"/>

Vivendi Universal published the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ports of the original game,<ref name="ps3" /> developed by Day 1 Studios. 

An expansion pack titled ''[[F.E.A.R. Extraction Point]]'' was released by [[TimeGate Studios]] on [[October 24]], [[2006]].<ref name="Extpoint"/> The second expansion pack, ''[[F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate]]'', also from TimeGate Studios, was released in November 2007. ''F.E.A.R. Files'' was released simultaneously for the Xbox 360, consisting of both ''Extraction Point'' and ''Perseus Mandate''.<ref>[http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/803/803320p1.html ''F.E.A.R.
