Spanning a vast area between central South America and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], it is the easternmost country of [[The Americas|America]] and borders every other South American country except [[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]] (viz. [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and the French department of [[French Guiana]]).

Brazil was colonized by [[Portugal]] and it is the only [[Portuguese language|Portuguese-speaking]] country in the [[Americas]]. It is a [[multiracial]] country with a population composed of [[European]], [[Amerindian]], [[Africa]]n and [[Asian]] elements, more often mixed in the same individual than separated into different communities. It has the largest [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] population in the world.

== History ==
{{main|History of Brazil}} 	 
[[Image:Brazil-16-map.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Brazil issued by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[explorer]]s in [[1519]].]]
Before the first [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers, led by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], arrived in 1500, Brazil is thought to have been inhabited by semi-[[nomad]]ic populations for at least 10,000 years. Over the next three centuries, it was resettled by the Portuguese and exploited mainly for [[brazilwood]] (Pau-Brasil), then [[sugarcane]] (Cana-de-Açúcar), coffee beans and [[gold mining]]. The colony's manpower was initially composed of [[Slavery#Slavery in Brazil|enslaved]] peoples, firstly [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindians]] and then, after 1532, mainly [[African]]s.

The only recorded transcontinental relocation of a royal family occurred in 1808 when the Portuguese royal family, headed by Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and her son and regent, the future [[John VI of Portugal|João VI of Portugal]], fled [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s armies and relocated to [[Rio de Janeiro]], along with the government and nobility. Although they returned in 1821, the interlude led to the opening of commercial ports to the [[United Kingdom]] &mdash; at the time isolated from most European ports by Napoleon &mdash; and to the elevation of Brazil to the status of a United Kingdom under the Portuguese Crown. Upon [[John VI of Portugal|João VI's]] departure, the remaining royal government in [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] moved to dissolve the Kingdom of Brazil and return it to the status of colony. This resulted in the small scale conflicts known as the [[Brazilian War of Independence]]. On [[7 September]] [[1822]] Prince regent [[Dom Pedro I]] (later Pedro IV of Portugal) declared independence, establishing the independent [[Empire of Brazil]]. A treaty recognizing the Empire's independence was signed on [[29 August]], [[1825]] with Britain and Portugal. As the crown remained in the hands of the [[House of Braganza|House of Bragança]], this was more the severance of the Portuguese empire in two, than an independence movement as seen elsewhere in the Americas.	 
		 
[[Image:Fala do trono.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Dom [[Pedro II of Brazil]], 1873.]]
The [[Brazilian]] Empire was formally a democracy in the [[Westminster system|British style]], although in practice, the emperor-premier-parliament balance of power more closely resembled the autocratic [[Austrian Empire]]. Slavery was abolished in 1888, through the "Golden Law", created by [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Princess Isabel]], and intensive European immigration created the basis for industrialization. Pedro I was succeeded by his son, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] &mdash; who in old age was caught by a political dispute between the Army and the Cabinet, a crisis arising from the [[War of the Triple Alliance|Paraguay War]]. Pedro II was deposed from the throne on [[15 November]] [[1889]], when a [[federal republic]] (officially, the Republic of the United States of Brazil) was established by [[Marechal Deodoro da Fonseca|Field Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca]]. 

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Brazil attracted over 5 million [[Europe]]an, [[Arab]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[immigrant]]s. During this time Brazil became industrialised, further colonised, and its interior further explored and developed. Brazilian democracy was replaced by [[dictatorship]]s three times &mdash; 1930&ndash;1934 and 1937&ndash;1945 under [[Getúlio Vargas]], and 1964&ndash;1985, under a succession of generals appointed by the military. Since 1985, Brazil has been regarded as a [[presidential democracy]], a status affirmed by a [[plebiscite]] in 1993 which asked voters to indicate a preference for a presidential or [[parliamentary system]]. Voters also decided not to restore the country's [[constitutional monarchy]].

== Government and politics ==
{{main|Politics of Brazil}}<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
[[Image:Brasilia National Congress.JPG|left|thumb|The National Congress in [[Brasília]], the [[capital]] of Brazil.]]
The capital of Brazil is [[Brasília]]. According to the Constitution promulgated in 1988, Brazil is a [[federation|federal]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], wherein the [[President of Brazil|President]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. Currently the President of Brazil is Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula). He was re-elected on 29 October 2006, extending his position as President of Brazil until the end of 2010. One of the fundamental principles of the politics in the Republic is the multi-party system, as a guarantee of political freedom.

The administrative structure of the State is a federation; however, Brazil has included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite: encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. The legal system is based on [[Roman law]].
[[Image:Lula117947.jpeg|thumb|right|Brazil's current [[President of Brazil|President]] [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]].]]
The Union's [[executive power]] is exercised by the government, headed by the president, who is elected for a four-year term, and is allowed to be re-elected for one other term. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]], which is bicameral. The [[deputies]] of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] are elected every four years in a system of proportional representation by states. 

The members of the [[Federal Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]] are elected for an eight-year term. The Ordinary Law making process requires the participation of the executive, which has a right to veto on new legislation, and has an exclusive prerogative of initiative of legislation on certain matters. Additionally, if relevant and urgent circumstances justify it, the executive may issue a "Provisory Measure," which has the binding force of the Law and comes into force immediately. The "Provisory Measure" retains its full power for up to 120 days, unless it is removed by the Congress.

== Administrative divisions ==
{{Brazil Labelled Map|float=right}}
{{main|States of Brazil}}
Brazil is a [[federation]] consisting of twenty-six states ({{lang|pt|''estados''}}) and one federal district ({{lang|pt|''Distrito Federal''}}), making a total of 27 "federate units"<!--"federal units"...?-->.

The Brazilian states enjoy a significant autonomy of government, law making, public security and taxation. The government of a state is headed by a [[Governor]] ({{lang|pt|''governador''}}), elected by popular vote, and also comprises its own legislative body ({{lang|pt|''assembléia legislativa''}}).
Each state is divided into [[municipality|municipalities]] ({{lang|pt|''municípios''}}) with their own [[legislative]] council ({{lang|pt|''câmara de vereadores''}}) and a mayor ({{lang|pt|''prefeito''}}), which are autonomous and hierarchically independent from both federal and state government. A municipality may include other towns ({{lang|pt|''distritos''}}) besides the municipal seat; those, however, have no separate government.

The [[judiciary]] is organised at the state and federal levels within districts called {{lang|pt|''comarcas''}}. One {{lang|pt|''comarca''}} may include several municipalities.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Br-map.png|thumb|right|General map of Brazil]]
{{main|Geography of Brazil}}
Brazil is characterized by the extensive low-lying [[Amazon Rainforest]] in the north and a more open terrain of hills and low mountains to the south &mdash; home to most of the Brazilian population and its agricultural base. Along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] seacoast are also found several mountain ranges, reaching roughly 2,900 [[metre]]s (9,500&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) high.

The highest peak is the 3,014 metre (9,735&nbsp;ft) [[Pico da Neblina]] (Myst's Peak) in [[Guiana]]'s [[highlands]]. Major rivers include the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], the largest river in the world in flowing water volume, and the second-longest in the world; the [[Paraná River|Paraná]] and its major tributary, the [[Iguaçu]] River, where the [[Iguaçu]] falls are located; the [[Rio Negro|Negro]], [[São Francisco River|São Francisco]], [[Xingu River|Xingu]], [[Madeira river|Madeira]] and the [[Tapajós]] rivers.

Located mainly within the [[tropics]], Brazil's [[climate]] has little seasonal variation. In southern most Brazil, however, there is subtropical temperate weather, occasionally experiencing frost and snow in the higher regions. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is abundant in the humid [[Amazon Basin]], but more arid landscapes are found as well, particularly in the northeast.
A number of [[island]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are part of Brazil:
*[[São Pedro e São Paulo|Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]]
*[[Rocas Atoll]]
*[[Fernando de Noronha]]
*[[Trindade and Martim Vaz]]

[[Image:Brasil.RioDeJaneiro.LeblonUndIpanema.jpg|thumb|right|The beaches of [[Rio de Janeiro]], the second largest city of Brazil, are famous worldwide.]]
Geographically, mainland Brazil is commonly divided into five [[region]]s: [[North Region, Brazil|North]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Region, Brazil|South]].

* The North constitutes 45.27% of the surface of Brazil and it is the region with the lowest number of inhabitants. With the exception of [[Manaus]], which hosts a tax-free industrial zone, and [[Belém]], with the biggest metropolitan area of the region, it is a fairly unindustrialised and undeveloped region. It accommodates most of the largest rainforest of the world and many [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous tribes]].

* The Northeast has one third of Brazil's population. The region is culturally diverse, with roots from the Portuguese colonial period, [[Afro-Brazilian]] culture and some Brazilian Indian influence. It is also the poorest region of Brazil, and has long periods of dry climate. It is well-known for its beautiful coast.

* The Central-West has a low demographic density compared to the other regions, mostly because of the [[Pantanal]], the world’s largest marshlands area, and a small part of the Amazon [[rainforest]], in the  northwest. However, much of the region is covered by [[Cerrado]], the largest [[savanna]] in the world. It is also the most important area for agriculture in the country. The most important cities of this region are: [[Brasília]] (the capital), [[Goiânia]], [[Campo Grande]] and [[Cuiabá]].

* The Southeast is the richest and most densely populated region. It has more inhabitants than any other South American country, and hosts one of the largest [[megalopolis (term)|megalopolis]] of the world, whereof the main cities are the country's two biggest ones; [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The region is very diverse, including the major business centre of São Paulo, the historical cities of Minas Gerais and its capital [[Belo Horizonte]], the third-largest metropolitan area in Brazil, the world famous beaches of Rio de Janeiro, and the acclaimed coast of Espírito Santo.

* The South is the wealthiest region by GDP per capita and has the best [[standard of living]] in the country. It is also the coldest region of Brazil, with occasional occurrences of [[frost]]s and [[snow]] in some of the higher altitude regions. The region has been heavily settled by European immigrants, mainly of Italian, German, Portuguese and [[Slavic people|Slavic]] genealogy, and shows clear influences from these cultures. The most important cities of this region are: [[Porto Alegre]], [[Curitiba]], [[Florianópolis]], [[Blumenau]], [[Novo Hamburgo]], [[Londrina]], [[Caxias do Sul]], [[Pelotas]], [[Passo Fundo]] and [[Joinville]].

{{main|Economy of Brazil}} 
{{seealso|Economic history of Brazil}} 

Possessing large and well-developed [[agriculture|agricultural]], [[mining]], [[manufacturing]], [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/br.html] and [[service sector]]s, as well as a large labor pool, Brazil's GDP (PPP) outweighs that of any other [[Latin America]]n country, being the core economy of [[Mercosul]]. The country has been expanding its presence in world markets. Major export products include [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]], [[coffee]], [[vehicles]], [[soybean]], [[iron ore]], [[orange juice]], [[steel]], [[textiles]], [[footwear]], [[corned beef]] and [[electrical equipment]]. 

According to the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]], Brazil has the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|ninth largest]] economy in the world at [[Purchasing Power Parity]] and [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|eleventh largest]] at market exchange rates. Brazil has a diversified middle income economy with wide variations in development levels. Most large industry is agglomerated in the South and South-East. The North-East is the poorest region of Brazil, but it is beginning to attract new investment.
<!-- POV Brazil has the most advanced industrial sector in Latin America{{fact}}--> 
Brazil's diverse industries range from automobiles, steel and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft, and consumer goods and amount to one-third of the [[GDP]]. With the increased economic stability provided by the Plano Real, Brazilian and multinational businesses have invested heavily in new equipment and technology, a large proportion of which has been purchased from North American enterprises.
[[Image:Bhcity2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Belo Horizonte]], capital of the State of [[Minas Gerais]] is one of the final centers of Brazil]]
Brazil has a diverse and sophisticated services industry as well. During the early 1990s, the banking sector amounted to as much as 16% of GDP. Although undergoing a major overhaul, Brazilian financial services industry provides local businesses with a wide range of products and is attracting numerous new entrants, including U.S. financial firms. The São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro stock exchanges are undergoing a consolidation.

According to international standards, Brazil has the ninth biggest economy in the world (see [[List of countries by GDP]]) and is among those countries constructing sophisticated technologies such as aircraft (see [[Embraer]]). As a core G20 country, Brazil has been expanding its influence in global economic negotiations. Although Brazil's economy is progressive and regionally important, the problems of widespread state [[bureaucracy]], [[corruption]], [[poverty]] and [[illiteracy]] are still major barriers to furthering its development.

Brazil's immense area is subdivided into different [[ecosystem]]s, which together sustain some of the world's greatest [[biodiversity]]. Due to the relatively explosive economic and demographic rise of the country in the last century, Brazil's ability to protect its [[Habitat (ecology)|environmental habitat]]s has increasingly come under threat. Extensive [[logging]] in the nation's forests, particularly the Amazon, both official and unofficial, destroys areas the size of a small country each year, and potentially a diverse variety of interesting plants and animals.<ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/global/globe/l_amer/brazil.htm], [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] Forest Service International Programs, retrieved February 2007</ref>

With abundant [[fauna]] and [[flora]], Brazil is home to many thousands of species, most of them still undiscovered. By 2020, it is estimated that at least 50% of the species resident in Brazil will become extinct.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

As several of these specimens possess special characteristics, or are built in an interesting way, some of their capabilities may be copied for use in technology (see [[bionics]]).{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The revenues derived from such plans may still hold the key to preserve the country's animal and plant species.

There is general consensus, that Brazil has the highest number of both terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of any country in the world. This high diversity of fauna can be explained by the sheer size of Brazil and also the great variation in ecosystems. The numbers published about Brazil's fauna diversity can vary from source to source, as taxonomists sometimes disagree about species classifications and information can be incomplete or out of date. Also new species continue to be discovered and, sadly, some species go extinct in the wild. Brazil has the highest primate diversity of any country in the world with 77 species and fresh water fish (over 3000 species), it claims the second-highest number of amphibian species, the third highest number of bird species and is ranked fifth in reptile species. Many of the species that are at risk live in threatened habitats such as the [[Atlantic Forest]].

== Demographics ==
[[Image:Kuarup3.jpg|left|thumb|[[Indigenous peoples of Brazil]]]]
{{main|Demographics of Brazil}}
Brazil's population is very diverse, comprising many races and [[ethnic group]]s. In general, Brazilians are descended from four sources of [[migration]]:

* 1) [[Amerindians]], Brazil's indigenous population, descended from human groups that migrated from [[Siberia]] across the [[Bering Strait]] around 9000 BC.

* 2) [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonists and settlers, arriving from 1500 onward.

* 3) Diverse groups of [[immigrant]]s from [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] arriving in Brazil during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

* 4) [[Africa]]n [[slave]]s brought to the country from 1530 until the end of the slave trade in 1850.

It is believed that the Americas were settled by three migratory waves from Northern Asia. The Brazilian Indians are thought to be descended from the first wave of migrants, who arrived in the region around 9000 BC. The main Native Brazilian groups were the [[Tupi]]-[[Guarani]], the [[Jê]], the [[Arawaks]] and the Caraibas ([[Caribs]]). The [[Tupi]]-[[Guarani]] nation, originally from the [[Parana river]] basin and also the main of Native-[[Paraguay]]an nations, had spread all along the Brazilian coastline from South to North and got to be known by the Portuguese as "Os Índios da Língua Geral" ("The Indians of the General Language"); the [[Jê]] nation occupied the most of the interior of the country from [[Maranhão]] to [[Santa Catarina]]. The [[Arawaks]] and the [[Caribs]], the last ones to get in contact with the Portuguese, lived in the North and Northwest of Brazil.
The [[Europe]]an [[immigration to Brazil]] started in the sixteenth century, the vast majority of them coming from [[Portugal]]. In the first two centuries of colonization, 100,000 Portuguese arrived in Brazil (around 500 colonists per year). In the eighteenth century, 600,000 Portuguese arrived (10,000 per year). The first region to be settled by the Portuguese was [[Northeastern Brazil]], followed by the [[Southeastern Brazil|Southeastern]] region. The interior began to be settled during the eighteenth century. The Portuguese were the only ethnic group to settle across Brazil.  However, it is also known that not so small numbers of [[Spaniards]], especially from [[Galiza]], had settled in Brazil along with the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] back in the colonial times.  Odds are that [[Diogo Álvares Correia]] a.k.a. "[[Caramuru]]", one of the first settlers and hero of the settlement of [[Bahia]], was actually a [[Galiza]]n from [[La Coruña]], so [[Francisco Romero]], administrator of the Captaincy of [[Ilheus]] in the mid 1500s, was a [[Spaniard]].

The original Amerindian population of Brazil (between three and five million) has in large part been exterminated or assimilated into the Portuguese population. The [[Mameluco]]s (or [[Caboclo]]s, mixed-race between [[Whites]] and Indians) have always been present in many parts of Brazil.
[[Image:SalvadorDaBahiaBahianDress.jpg|right|thumb|[[Afro-Brazilian]]s with typical clothes in [[Salvador, Bahia]]]]
Another important ethnic group, [[Africa]]ns, first arrived as slaves. At first many came from [[Guinea]], although by the end of the eighteenth century many had been taken from [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] (or, in [[Bahia]], from [[Nigeria]]). By the time of the end of the slave trade in 1850, around three to five million slaves had been brought to Brazil &ndash; 37% of all slave traffic between Africa and the Americas.At the time of slavery a mixed people came out trough rapes or affairs between white masters and  black or Indian  slaves.

The large influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Between 1870 and 1930, more than 5 million immigrants entered Brazil. These immigrants were divided in two groups: a part of them was sent to [[Southern Brazil]] to work as small [[farm]]ers. However, the biggest part of the immigrants was sent to [[Southeastern Brazil]] to work in the [[coffee]] [[plantation]]s. The immigrants sent to Southern Brazil were mainly [[Germans]] (starting in 1824, mainly from [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Pomerania]], [[Hamburg]], [[Westfalia]], etc) and [[Italians]] (starting in 1875, mainly from the [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardia]]). In the South, the immigrants established rural communities that, still today, have a strong cultural connection  with their homeland. In Southeastern Brazil most of the immigrants were Italians (mainly from the [[Veneto]], [[Campania]], [[Calabria]] and [[Lombardia]]), Portuguese (mainly from [[Beira Alta]], [[Minho (province)|Minho]] and [[Alto Trás-os-Montes]]), [[Spaniards]] (mainly from [[Galicia]] and [[Andalusia]]).
[[Image:Saopaulo_copan.jpg|thumb|right|[[São Paulo]] is the largest Brazilian city and the financial capital of the country. It is one of the largest [[metropolis]] in the world.]]
Notably, the early part of the twentieth century saw a large influx of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] (mainly from [[Honshu]] and [[Okinawa]]) and [[Arab]]s (from [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]).  These Arab immigrants were -and still are- wrongly called "[[Turkish people|Turks]]" by the [[Brazilian]]s because their original countries were still under Turkish rule back in the times Arab immigration to Brazil began.  Curiously, it was very few, if not even insignificant, the number of actual [[Turkish people|Turks]] who ever migrated to Brazil.

url =http://www.memorialdoimigrante.sp.gov.br Memorial do Imigrante| format =| doi =| accessdate =}}</ref> Brazil attracted nearly 5.5 million immigrants between [[1870]] and [[1953]]: approximately 1,550,000 [[Italo-Brazilian|Italians]], 1,470,000 Portuguese, 650,000 Spaniards, 210,000 Germans, 190,000 Japanese, 120,000 [[Poles]] and 650,000 of many other nationalities.

Brazil's population is mostly concentrated along the coast, with a lower population density in the interior. The population of the southern states is mainly of European descent, while the majority of the inhabitants of the north and northeast are of mixed ancestry (Amerindians, Africans and Europeans)

According to the Brazilian constitution of 1988, racism is an unbailable crime and must be met with imprisonment. <br clear="all" />

===Ethnicity and race===
The 2000 [[IBGE]] census found Brazil to consist of:<ref>[http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/presidencia/noticias/20122002censo.shtm 2000 Demographic Census]</ref>
* 53.7% [[Whites|white]]
* 38.5% [[pardo]] or [[mulatto]] ([[mixed-race]])
* 6.2% [[Blacks|black]]
* 0.5% [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]]
* 0.4% [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]]
* 0.7% unspecified

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Brazil}}
{{seealso|Brazilian Portuguese}}
[[Image:Estação da Luz.jpg|right|thumb|300px|"[[Estação da Luz]]": A train station in [[São Paulo]], mostly notable for lodging the [[Museum of the Portuguese Language]].]]
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the only official language of Brazil. It is spoken by nearly the entire population and is virtually the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio, TV and for all business and administrative purposes. Moreover, Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in [[the Americas]], making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity. 

Portuguese as spoken in Brazil has developed independently of the European mother tongue, and it has undergone fewer phonetic changes than the language spoken in Portugal, thus it is often said that the "[[language]] of [[Camões]]", who lived in the sixteenth century, sounded closer to modern Brazilian Portuguese, than to the language spoken in Portugal today, and that his work is poetically more perfect when read the Brazilian way. Brazilian Portuguese has notable influences from [[Amerindian]] and [[African]] languages. Generally, native speakers of each variant can understand one another, but there are several significant phonological, lexical and orthographic differences.

===Minority languages===
[[Image:Região_da_Liberdade_-_São_Paulo_-_Brasil.JPG|right|thumb|200px|In [[Liberdade]], a district of [[São Paulo]] settled by [[Japanese-Brazilian|Japanese]] immigrants, the main spoken language is [[Japanese language|Japanese]]]]
Many Amerindian languages are spoken daily in indigenous communities, primarily in Northern Brazil. Although many of these communities have significant contact with Portuguese, today there are incentives for teaching and preserving native languages. In 2006, the City of [[Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira]] in the region of Cabeça do Cachorro (Northwestern region of the State of [[Amazonas]]), has adopted some indigenous languages as some of its other official languages along with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Other languages are spoken by descendants of immigrants, who are usually bilingual, in small rural communities in Southern Brazil. The most important are the [[Brazilian German]] dialects, such as [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] and the [[Pomeranian language]], and also the [[Talian]], based on the [[Italian Language|Italian]] [[Venetian language]]. In the city of [[São Paulo]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] can be heard in the immigrant neighbourhoods, like [[Liberdade]].

[[English language|English]] is part of the official high school curriculum, but few Brazilians are truly fluent in the language, even in Brazilian universities. Spanish is understood to varying degrees by many Brazilians, especially on the borders with Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.

== Social issues ==
===Poverty and economic inequality===
According to [[Fundação Getulio Vargas]], in [[June]] [[2006]] the rate of poverty based into lacework was of 18.57% of the population - a 19.8% reduction during the previous 4 years.<ref> [http://www.fgv.br/cps/pesquisas/miseria_queda_grafico_clicavel/Grafico_Miseria.pdf FGV - Gráfico Miséria]</ref> The rate of poverty is in part attributed to the country's [[economic inequality]]. Brazil ranks among the world's highest nations in the [[Gini coefficient]] index of inequality assessment.
[[Image:RiodeJaneiro-Favela.jpg|thumb|right|Entrenched between some of the richer areas of [[Rio de Janeiro]], the [[Vidigal]] ''[[favela]]'' is testimony to high [[economic inequality]] within Brazil.]]

Poverty in Brazil is most visually represented by the various ''[[favela]]s'', [[slum]]s in the country's metropolitan areas and remote upcountry regions that suffer with economic underdevelopment and below-par standards of living. There are also great differences in wealth and welfare between regions.<ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =|
coauthors =|title =PIB dos municípios revela concentração e desigualdades na geração de renda

url =http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=354&id_pagina=1| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-02-22}}</ref> While the Northeast region has the worst [[economic indicator]]s nationwide due to low coverage and quality of public services and widespread [[corruption]], many cities in the South and Southeast enjoy [[First World]] [[socioeconomic]] standards. [http://www.fundaj.gov.br/docs/pe/pe0114.html] In [[2005]], Brazil had more than 15 million (10.2%) people that were considered to be [[Illiteracy|illiterate]].
[http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/trabalhoerendimento/pnad2005/sintesepnad2005.pdf]

A recent attempt to mitigate these problems is the "''[[Fome Zero]]''" hunger-eradication program implemented by President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]].  Part of this is "''[[Bolsa Família]]''", a major anti-poverty program that gives money directly to impoverished families.



==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Brazil}} 
[[Image:Museu de Arte Contemporânea.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Niterói Contemporary Art Museum]] is another impressive example of the Brazilian architecture.]]
The core culture of Brazil is rooted in the [[culture of Portugal]]. The Portuguese [[colonist]]s and immigrants brought the [[Roman Catholic]] [[faith]], the Portuguese language and many [[tradition]]s and customs that still influence the modern-day Brazilian culture.

As a multiracial country, its culture also absorbed other influences. The Amerindian peoples influenced Brazil's language and [[Cuisine of Brazil|cuisine]] and the Africans, brought as slaves, largely influenced [[Music of Brazil|Brazil's music]], [[dance]], cuisine, religion and language. The [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] traditions, from nowadays Southwest [[Nigeria]] had made its way strongly into Afro-Brazilian religion and into Brazilian religiousness as a whole. Ancient [[Yoruba mythology|Yoruba]] [[Orishas]] (gods) like [[Shango]] and [[Oxum]] are largely worshipped in Brazil, while the [[Samba]] and the [[Capoeira]] (musical rhythm and martial art, respectively) were originally contributions from the [[Bantus|Bantu peoples]] from [[Angola]].
[[Italy|Italian]], [[Germany|German]] and other European [[immigrant]]s came in large numbers and their influences are felt closer to the Southeast and South of Brazil.

===Religion===
[[Image:Santa Cruz do Sul catedral 2005-03-21.jpg||thumb|right|The Cathedral of São João Batista in Santa Cruz do Sul, [[Rio Grande do Sul]].]]
{{main|Religion in Brazil}}
According to the [http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/ IBGE] census:<ref>[http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2000/populacao/religiao_Censo2000.pdf Official data on Religion distribution in Brazil]</ref>
* 73.9% are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] (about 125 million)
* 15.4% are [[Protestant]]s. (about 26 million)
* 7.4% consider themselves [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], [[Atheism|atheists]] or without a religion. (about 12 million)
* 1.3% are followers of [[Spiritism]] (about 2.2 million).
* 0.3% are followers of African traditional religions such as [[Candomblé]] and [[Umbanda]].
* 1.7% are members of other religions. Some of these are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (1,100,000) [[Buddhism]] (215,000), [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] (199,645), [[Judaism]] (87,000), and [[Islam in Brazil|Islam]] (27,000) 
* Some practice a mixture of different religions, such as Catholicism, Candomblé, and indigenous American religion combined.

Brazil has the largest [[Roman Catholicism in Brazil|Roman Catholic]] population in the world.

Followers of [[Protestantism]] are rising in number.  Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were the ones of Traditional Churches - [[Lutheran]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s and [[Baptist]]s mainly - but the [[Pentecostals]] and Neopentecostals have increased largely in numbers since then.

Some of the African slaves brought to Brazil were the first Muslims in Brazil.  Today, the Muslim population in Brazil is made up of mostly [[Arab]] immigrants. A recent trend has been the increase in conversions to Islam among non-Arab citizens.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71451.htm]</ref> See [[Islam in Brazil]].

The largest population of Buddhists in Latin America lives in Brazil.  This is mostly because Brazil has the largest [[Japanese-Brazilian|Japanese]] population outside [[Japan]].  See [[Buddhism in Brazil]].

Brazil appears as a devout country to outsiders yet in an [[IBOPE]] poll, about 8% of Brazilians declared themselves to be non-religious (with 2% declaring themselves atheists) and 58% of Catholics considered themselves "not very practicing" or "not at all practicing".<ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =|
