The '''charismatic movement''' begins with the adoption of certain beliefs typical of those held by [[Pentecostal]] Christians — specifically what are known as the biblical [[charism]]s or [[spiritual gift]]s: [[glossolalia]] (speaking in tongues), [[prophesying]], [[Faith healing|supernatural healing]] — by those within mainstream [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]] churches. Many charismatic Christians went on to form separate churches and denominations.  The writings of [[John William Fletcher|John Fletcher]] were influential in beginning this movement, which was sparked by the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in California, which took place in 1906.  Though charismatic theology finds its roots in the [[Holiness Movement|Wesleyan-Holiness]] tradition, charismatic Christians can now be found within numerous theological movements and in multiple denominations.    

'''Charismatic''' is an umbrella term used to describe those [[Christianity|Christians]] who believe that the manifestations of the [[Holy Spirit]] seen in the first century Christian Church, such as [[miracle]]s, [[prophecy]], and [[glossolalia]] (speaking in other tongues or languages), are available to contemporary Christians and may be experienced and practiced today. The word ''charismatic'' is derived from the Greek word {{lang|grc|χάρισμα}} ("gift," itself derived from {{lang|grc|χάρις}}, "grace" or "favor") which is the term used in the [[Bible]] to describe a wide range of supernatural experiences (especially in [[1 Corinthians]] 12-14).

Often confused with [[Pentecostalism]] (which inspired it, along with [[Methodism]]), charismatic Christianity tends to differ in key aspects: most charismatic Christians reject the preeminence given by Pentecostalism to [[glossolalia]], reject what they consider to be [[legalism (theology)|legalism]] sometimes associated with Pentecostalism, and often stay in their existing denominations such as [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal|charismatic Roman Catholics]]. 

Because of the continual cross-over between Pentecostalism and the modern charismatic movement, it is increasingly difficult to speak of charismatic and Pentecostal Christians as being part of separate movements. Yet because neither movement is [[monolithic]], it is inaccurate to speak of them as being one movement. The difference is primarily one of origins. Beliefs of the two groups are very similar; each movement, however, is unique in its historical beginnings.  Having been conceived in unique contexts, the difference may secondarily be described in terms of contrasting church cultures evidenced through each movement's manners and customs (i.e., worship styles, preaching styles, altar ministry methods). Until a more acceptable broad nomenclature is used, it needs to be understood that both movements share a great deal in common, and yet can sometimes be clearly differentiated.

==History==
===1950-1975===
While it is difficult to locate the place and time charismatic Christianity began to influence the mainstream churches, [[Dennis Bennett]], an American Episcopalian, is often cited as the movement's seminal influence. Bennett was the Rector at St Mark's [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] Church in [[Van Nuys]], California when he announced to the congregation in 1960 that he had received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Soon after this he was ministering in [[Vancouver]] where he ran many workshops and seminars about the work of the Holy Spirit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.telus.net/st_simons/arm12.htm|title=Anglican Pioneer in Renewal|accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref> This influenced tens of thousands of Anglicans world-wide and also began a renewal movement within the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches.

In the 1960s and 1970s there was a renewed interest in the supernatural "gifts of the Spirit" in mainstream churches such as the Methodist, Episcopal, Lutheran, Anglican, and Catholic churches. The [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]] was focused in individuals like [[Kevin Ranaghan]] and others at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]]. [[Dennis Bennett]] was Ranaghan's counterpart in the Episcopal Church. Meanwhile, in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Colin Urquhart]], [[Michael Harper]], [[David Watson (evangelist)|David Watson]] and others were in the vanguard of similar developments. The Roman Catholic Duquesne University in Pittsburgh began hosting charismatic revivals in 1977, which coincided with Jimmy Carter's election and the "born from above" or "born again" explosion.

In both the UK and [[New Zealand]] there was significant overlap between charismatic ex-[[Brethren]] and those of mainstream churches. Brethren men such as [[Campbell McAlpine]] and [[Arthur Wallis]] visited [[New Zealand]] for the renowned [[Massey University|Massey]] conference in 1964.  This was attended by several Anglicans including, the Rev. Ray Muller who went on to invite [[Dennis Bennett]] to New Zealand in 1966, and played a leading role in developing and promoting the ''Life in the Spirit'' seminars. Other leaders in the New Zealand movement included Baptist Wyn Fountain and Auckland Anglican Ken Prebble.<ref>Lineham, Peter (1982), Tongues Must Cease.</ref><ref>Knowles, Brett (1999), New Life: The New Life Churches of New Zealand: 1942-1979</ref>

The charismatic renewal movement in the Eastern Orthodox Church never exerted the influence that it did in other mainstream churches. Individual priests, such as Fr. [[Eusebius Stephanou]] of the Greek Orthodox Orthodox Archdiocese of North America, founder of the Brotherhood of St. Symeon the New Theologian, Fr. [[Athanasius Emmert]] of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese and Fr. [[Boris Zabrodsky]] of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] in America, founder of the Service Committee for Orthodox Spiritual Renewal (SCOSR) which published "[[Theosis]]" Newsletter, were some of the more prominent leaders of the charismatic renewal in Orthodoxy.

On an international level, [[David du Plessis]] along with a host of others (including [[Lutheran]] and even [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] ministers) promoted the movement. The latter did not last long with their denominations, either volunteering to leave or being asked to do so. But in the Episcopal and Catholic churches priests were permitted to continue on in their parishes, provided they did not allow these concerns to create major divisions within their congregations.

===1975-2000===
While there are many charismatic Christians within established denominations, others have left to join more progressive Pentecostal churches or formed their own churches or denominations. The [[house church]] movement in the UK and the [[Vineyard movement]] in the U.S. are examples of a formal charismatic structure. The [[Hillsong Church]] in Australia is an example of a Pentecostal church that has embraced charismatic belief and practices, which has, in turn, influenced the Australian [[Assemblies of God]] denomination. In New Zealand, a major Pentecostal movement is the [[New Life Churches]], although other local and international Pentecostal denominations are also well established.

Since the mid 1980s, the charismatic movement has made some notable changes in its theology and emphases. This process has been termed ''[[Third Wave of the Holy Spirit|The Third Wave of the Holy Spirit]]'' and has been typified by the ministry of [[C. Peter Wagner]], [[John Wimber]], and the [[Toronto blessing]] phenomenon. In the 80's, two distinct groups of charismatic Christians emerged: Those with a more evangelical emphasis, such as the Vineyard and many independent groups and those following [[Word of faith|Word-faith Theology]] (mostly centered around [[Kenneth E. Hagin|Kenneth W. Hagin]] and RHEMA Churches). Key charismatic figures such as John Wimber and others are critical of Word-faith and the "prosperity gospel."

In the 1990s, many leaders (such as [[John Paul Jackson]]) and Churches started re-considering their traditional charismatic emphasis on [[Spiritual Warfare]] (moving from 'binding spirits' to praying that the Holy Spirit would move).

===2000-present===

The charismatic movement has grown in the last decade. As of 2008, according to Barna surveys, one out of every four Protestant churches in the United States (23%) is a charismatic congregation. A slight majority of all born again Christians (51%) are charismatic. Nearly half of all adults who attend a Protestant church (46%) are charismatic.<ref>''Barna Group,'' [http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdateNarrow&BarnaUpdateID=287 "Is American Christianity Turning Charismatic?"] Accessed 29 January, 2008.</ref>

Since 2000, charismatic Christians have begun to focus more on prayer, [[fasting]] and continual prayer and worship{{Fact|date=May 2008}}. The [[International House of Prayer]], founded by [[Mike Bickle]] became one of the major ''equipping centers'' for the prayer movement, and many prayer houses have been established throughout the world. Many churches have started intercessory prayer meetings. The Call, a series of "solemn assembly" prayer gatherings have been held around America since 2000. While meetings are non-denominational in nature, charismatic leaders, such as [[Lou Engle]], [[Mike Bickle]] and others lead and organize them.

A major emphasis for some Charismatic Christians in the 21st century is using the gifts of the Holy Spirit (such as [[prophecy]] and [[faith healing|healing]]) as tools for evangelism, with the understanding that God employs supernatural encounters "[[signs and wonders]]", more than verbal communication such as [[Tract (literature)|tracts]] or [[Christian apologetics]].

The practice of praying for the sick, while always an integral element of charismatic doctrine, has increased recently{{Fact|date=May 2008}}. In many circles, the emphasis has shifted from one so-called "anointed" person ministering to the sick, towards the congregation as a whole praying. An international network of "Healing Rooms," places where anybody can receive prayer for healing, has been established by [[Healing Rooms International]] (founded by [[Cal Pierce]]). Many churches offer special times to receive healing prayer, or offer it after a service.

The goal of the full restoration of the [[fivefold ministry]] (Evangelists, Pastors, Apostles, Prophets and Teachers) has become another large focus these groups{{Fact|date=May 2008}}. Many believe that the church will not function properly and see the fullness of what God has for it, unless all five positions are functioning{{Fact|date=May 2008}}.

Current key leaders of the charismatic movement include [[Randy Clark]], [[Bill Johnson (pastor)|Bill Johnson]], [[Bob Jones]], [[Mike Bickle]], [[Heidi Baker|Rolland and Heidi Baker]], and [[Che Ahn]].

The 2006 [[documentary film]] ''[[Jesus Camp]]'' provided a window into one facet of the charismatic movement.

April 2, 2008 marked a new movement in the United States, lead by Fresh Fire Ministries and Canadian Evengelist [[Todd Bentley]]. The [[Florida Healing Outpouring]], also known as, The Great Florida Healing Revival, in Lakeland, Florida, has drawn international attention with the help of new media including the internet and God TV (http://www.god.tv). Miracles have been reported daily at the revival. As of June 13, 2008, stated by Lakeland's Ignited Church Pastor Stephen Strader on the broadcast, there have been 24 resurrections from the dead. Archived services are on Ignited Church's website (http://www.ignitedchurch.com). This new movement has caused quite a stir among some evangelicals, particularly on Internet web sites and blogs, with lengthy and sometimes heated debates over its legitimacy and claims.

==Pentecostalism==

The charismatic movement shares many similarities with [[Pentecostalism]], and the stages of the latter seem to have been a prerequisite for the further developing of the charismatic one. The influence of Pentecostalism upon the charismatic movement cannot be denied. Both acknowledge the power of the [[Holy Spirit]]. [[Faith healing]] has major acceptance among adherents of both faiths, and both are known for their lively worship services. Even still, many differences will distinguish a charismatic from a Pentecostal, though some may consider themselves to be both.

Pentecostal Christians have developed their own denominations, but charismatic Christians tend either to remain in their respective established churches or religious bodies, or associate in loose Church fellowships such as the [[Vineyard Church]] or [[Global Legacy]]. Charismatic Christians have been susceptible to criticism that exceeds that of Pentecostalism, but criticism of both is widespread in comparison to other religious movements{{Fact|date=May 2008}}.

== Roman Catholicism ==
{{main|Catholic Charismatic Renewal}}
Charismatic Christians are not exclusive to any single denomination, and indeed, charismatic theology is not even uniquely [[Protestant]]. There is a burgeoning charismatic movement within the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and [[Pope John Paul II]] was reputed to have had a charismatic priest as his personal pastor however there is no evidence that the Pope, himself, was "charismatic" or spoke in tongues{{Fact|date=May 2008}}.

In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, the movement became particularly popular in the Filipino and Hispanic communities of the United States, in [[the Philippines]] itself, and in [[Latin America]], mainly [[Brazil]]. Traveling priests and lay people associated with the movement often visit parishes and sing what are known as charismatic masses. It is thought to be the second largest distinct sub-movement within Roman Catholicism, along with [[Traditional Catholicism]]. It presents a difficult situation for many Church authorities, who, as always, must be careful to admit innovation only where it is clear the innovation is consistent with the [[Bible]] and the teachings of the Church.

Further difficulty is the tendency for many charismatic Christians to take on what others in the Roman Church might consider sacramental language and assertions of the necessity of "Baptism in the Holy Spirit," as a universal act.  This causes difficulty as there is little to distinguish the "Baptism" from the sacrament of confirmation.<ref>McDonnell, Killian & Montague, George T. ''Christian Initiation and Baptism in the Holy Spirit: Evidence from the First Eight Centuries.'' Michael Glazier Books: 1994, Collegeville, MN</ref>

The ''Compendium to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' states:<blockquote>
160. What are charisms?

799-801

Charisms are special gifts of the Holy Spirit which are bestowed on individuals for the good of others, the needs of the world, and in particular for the building up of the Church. The discernment of charisms is the responsibility of the Magisterium.
</blockquote>

== Seventh-day Adventist ==
{{main|Charismatic Adventism}}
A minority of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] are charismatic. They are strongly associated with those holding more [[Progressive Adventism|progressive Adventist beliefs]]. Early Adventists were very charismatic.<ref>"[http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/MIN/MIN1991-10/index.djvu?djvuopts&page=10 Enthusiasm in early Adventist worship]"{{DjVulink}} by [[Ronald Graybill]].
