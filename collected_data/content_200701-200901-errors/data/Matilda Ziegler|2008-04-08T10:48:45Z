==Television career==
Matilda Ziegler's first screen role remains her most notable. In her early twenties, during 1987&ndash;89, she played ''EastEnders''' scheming Donna Ludlow who contended with [[prostitution]], an attempted [[gang rape]], a [[heroin addiction]] and finally [[suicide]] (dying of a heroin overdose). The final death scenes of Ziegler's character, who had choked to death on her own vomit, have been hailed as one of the most powerful anti-drug images ever screened on the programme.<ref name="first10years">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-37057-2}}</ref>
