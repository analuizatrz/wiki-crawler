[[Image:Ex_Terra.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Ex Terra Sculpture, Glenrothes Town Centre]]'''Glenrothes''' (''Gleann Rathais'' in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]) is a town on the east coast of [[Scotland]].  It is located in [[Fife]] and is approximately equidistant between [[Edinburgh]] and [[Dundee]]. Glenrothes was the second [[New_town#United_Kingdom|new town]] to be designated in Scotland and was established in [[1948]]. It is the administrative centre for Fife and has been successful in attracting a high number of modern industrial companies. The town boasts beautiful parks and landscaping, a plethora of sculptures and artworks and one of Scotland's largest indoor shopping malls.

=History=

==Background==
[[Image:Woodside_pre_Glenrothes.JPG|thumb|left|200px| Housing at Woodside, built pre-Glenrothes]]
The land where Glenrothes now festers was largely agricultural and once contained a number of small farming communities. Originally the new town was going to be centred on [[Markinch]], however the village's infrastructure was deemed unable to withstand the substantial growth required to realise a new town. Leslie and Thornton were also considered but as a consequence the area that sits between all three was chosen. The land taken was previously an area of great landscape value with some of the richest farming land in Scotland, at a time farming was beginning its long post-World War 2 decline. The land was sub-divided into areas or "precincts" which were named after the hamlets already established (e.g. Woodside, Cadham), the farms which once occupied the land (e.g. Rimbleton, Caskieberran, Collydean) or historical stately homes in the area (e.g. Balgeddie, [[Glenrothes#Pictures | Balbirnie]], Leslie Parks). 

The name Rothes comes from the association with the north-east Scotland Earl of Rothes, family name Leslie, who owned much of the land historically and after whom the largest local settlement Leslie, pre-Glenrothes New Town, was named, and still exists to the north-west of the town. [[Glen]] (Scottish for valley) was added to prevent confusion with [[Rothes]] in [[Moray]], and because the town lies on the [[Leven%2C_Fife| Leven]] valley.[[Image:Cadham Village.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Cadham Village, built pre-Glenrothes]]

Originally the main industry in Glenrothes and the surrounding area was paper-making (Tullis-Russell and the other mills along the Leven Valley) and [[coal mining]]. Unlike [[East Kilbride]], [[Cumbernauld]] or [[Livingston%2C_Scotland|Livingston]] Glenrothes was not originally to be a [http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSFG10 Glasgow overspill] new town, although it did later take this role. It was however populated in the early 1950s in large part by mining families moving from the West of [[Scotland]], particularly the [[Glasgow]] area, though many re-settled from the declining [[Lothian]] coalfields too. 

The planning, development, management and promotion of Glenrothes was the responsibility of the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC), a [[quango]] appointed by the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. Fife Council were responsible for implementing the [[infrastructure]] in the town such as schools, parks and roads.

==The Rothes Pit==

The primary reason for the designation of Glenrothes was to house miners who where to work at a new super coal mine. This was to be the most modern of the day and was built west of Thornton, an established village south of Glenrothes. The Super Pit was named the [http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/imagesCoal.html Rothes Colliery] and it was officially opened by the Queen in 1956. Iconic photographs of the young Queen going down the Rothes Colliery in an all-white boiler suit and helmet are still regularly shown in programmes about the royal family. About 5,000 miners were to be required to produce 5,000 tonnes of coal per day, and huge railway yards were established. The pit was to have a working life of 100 years. The planned long-term benefits were to be huge, and the driver for economic regeneration for central Fife. Within 5 years, the huge investment was written off and the mine run down because of un-stemmable flooding. Interestingly, miners who'd worked in older deep pits in the area had fore-warned against the development of the Rothes Pit for this very reason. The state-of-the art engineering and design was closed, leaving the huge enclosed concrete wheel-towers standing at Thornton for many years as a forlorn symbol of the collapse.

==A Change in Fortunes==

[[Image:Glenrothes_Offices.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Fife Council Chambers and HQ buildings, Glenrothes Town Centre]]
The loss of the pit was devastating and further development of the town almost stopped. It did however help change the fortunes of the town. Glenrothes became an economic focal point for Central Scotland and as a result a plethora of modern electronics factories moved into the town. The first big overseas electronic investor was Beckmans Industries in 1959 followed by Hughes Industries in early 1960s. A number of other important companies were to follow making Glenrothes a major hub in Scotland's [[Silicon Glen]].  

Glenrothes' central location, good road connections and space for large scale development began to pay off. A further boost to the town during the 1970's saw it become the centre of [http://www.fife.gov.uk Fife Council]'s operations.  This took the role from [[Cupar]] which was formally the County Town of Fife. [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/yourtown/index.cfm?fuseaction=facility.display&town=0F9DB065-BF8E-4BB7-85F9FB281784F80B&facid=29F62F6B-D048-4106-B5B486F3DBA3CF46 Fife House](the headquarters of Fife Council) and other Fife Council buildings are situated in Glenrothes' town centre. [[Fife Constabulary]] and [[Scottish Enterprise]] Fife also have their headquarters in the town. These elements combined have made Glenrothes the administrative centre for Fife.[[Image:Fife_Constabulary_HQ.JPG‎|thumb|right|200px|Fife Constabulary HQ, Viewfield]]
The GDC was wound up in 1995, and was asked to undertake any last major works required in the town with the aid of a grant. The Leven Bridge crossing Riverside Park and the Kingdom Centre Phase 4, including the Rothes Halls were some of the last major projects undertaken. Property and assets of the town were either sold off to private companies or passed onto the responsibility of Fife Council. The winding up of the GDC meant that Glenrothes was no longer an official new town. Development and management of the town would now be undertaken by Fife Council.

==Glenrothes Today==

[[Image:Concrete_Hippos.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Marching Hippos, Riverside Park]]
While much of the townscape consists of unexceptional 20th century developments, Glenrothes has many surprises. Early precincts of Glenrothes present some of the best examples of post war [[social housing]], two of which (at the time) won [http://www.saltiresociety.org.uk/housing.htm/ Saltire Society Awards]. Three of the towns earliest churches, St. Margaret's, St. Paul's and St. Columba's, are [[listed buildings]].  There are also historical stately homes; [[Glenrothes#Pictures | Balbirnie House]], Leslie House and [http://www.balgeddiehouse.com/ Balgeddie House]. Balbirnie and Balgeddie Houses are now luxury hotels, and Leslie House is set to become luxury apartments. [[Collydean]] precinct hosts a ruin of a 17th century laird's house called [[Pitcairn House]]. Ancient [[stone circles]] can be seen at [[Balfarg]] and [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/403 Balbirnie] in the north east of the town. There is a variety of artworks and sculptures scattered throughout Glenrothes (around 132) made from a variety of materials such as bronze, fibre glass, bricks, sandstone and concrete. The sculptures range from [[Glenrothes#Pictures | giant flowers]], [[Glenrothes#Pictures | giant hands]], a dinosaur, toadstools, [[Glenrothes#Pictures | the Good Samaritan]], a horse & chariot, [[Glenrothes#Pictures | dancing children]], a seated old couple, crocodiles and marching Hippos.

Glenrothes has never achieved the full potential envisaged for it. It never reached its 70,000 population target, currently standing at around 40,000, and while the number of jobs in the town remain high (approx 36,000 jobs [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_foyejr.pdf]), it has not been enough to combat high unemployment levels in the wider [[Kirkcaldy]][http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2005/05/19/newsstory7145791t0.asp] and [[Levenmouth]] travel to work area.

==Town Centre and Shopping==
[[Image:Kingdom_Centre.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Kingdom Shopping Centre fourth phase, Glenrothes Town Centre]]
Glenrothes [[town centre]] is located on the southern lip of the Leven Valley. It is bounded by a ring road, has been [[town_planning|purposely planned]], contains no residential element and is largely enclosed ([http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.196385~-3.173257&style=h&lvl=16&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000 see aerial view]).  These are all factors which distinguish it from Fife's other town centres.

The [http://www.kingdomshoppingcentre.co.uk/ Kingdom Centre] forms the main shopping element of the town centre. It is one of the largest single-level [[shopping_mall|indoor shopping centres]] in Scotland with around 42,000 sq m (450,000 sq ft) of (gross) floorspace [http://www.fife.gov.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_GlenrothesTownCentreFS.pdf][http://www.fife.gov.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_TownCentreAuditFinalReportOct2006.doc]. 
The centre has some of the highest levels of footfall in Fife [http://www.fife.gov.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_TownCentreFootfallFinalReportOct2006.doc].

The shopping centre opened in 1962 and has developed with the growth of the town, being built in four main phases:

*Phase 1- Lyon Square 1962 
*Phase 2- Falkland Square 1972 
*Phase 3- Unicorn Square 1982 
*Phase 4- Rothes Square 1993 

The next phase of the centre's development is to take place at North Street in the near future with a planned foodstore [http://www.kingdomshoppingcentre.co.uk/web/site/information/development.asp].The shopping mall currently contains over 100 shops as well as a variety of cafes, the town's central library, the [http://www.rotheshalls.org.uk/ Rothes Halls] - the town's theatre and a ten pin bowling alley. 

The [http://www.rotheshalls.org.uk/ Rothes Halls] complex acts as the civic heart of Glenrothes. It is used as the town's theatre and its exhibition, conference and civic centre. The theatre has capacity for over 1,000 people split between 2 main halls [http://www.rotheshalls.org.uk/capacity.htm]. The flexible nature of the complex means it can cater for a large variety of events. The [[Stereophonics]], [[Terrorvision]], and [[Ken Dodd]] are among some of the well-known acts to have performed there. Plays, an annual beer festival, model railway exhibitions and acts from a number of tribute bands are also some of the many events hosted at Rothes Halls [http://www.rotheshalls.org.uk/whats_on.htm]. The town's central library and a cafe also form part of the Rothes Halls complex. 
[[Image:Rothes_Halls.jpg‎|thumb|left|200px|Rothes Halls mall entrance, Glenrothes Town Centre]]
Outwith the shopping centre are a variety of other premises including a bingo hall, a night club, offices, pubs, bars, restaurants, churches, a hotel, a post office, a vet, dentists, banks and building societies.

The town centre has also been extended at Queensway where a number of retail and leisure outlets have been developed. There are proposals for a substantial new shopping development on land adjacent to Queensway [http://www.macdonaldestates.co.uk/index.php?sn=op&ssn=pr].

An out of centre [[Retail_park|retail park]] has also been built at the [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.188242~-3.186083&style=h&lvl=17&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000| Saltire Centre] with large bulky goods and out-of-town retailers. Planning permission has been granted for the redevelopment of the Saltire Centre. This will include new roundabout access, increased retail floorspace and a new drive-thru restaurant[http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/topics/index.cfm?fuseaction=planapps.display&subjectid=104CC166-3ED1-4D22-B9F1E2FB8438478A&bwid=05/03635/CARM].

Glenrothes also has a number of neighbourhood shopping centres located at strategic points throughout the town. These contain parades of small shops and a variety of public facilities. The first of these to be built was the Woodside Centre. The Glenwood Centre, the Glamis Centre and the Cadham Centre followed as the town developed. Small parades of shops were also built at various points in the town, these are at Bighty Avenue in Woodside, Parbroath Road in Finglassie and Peploe Drive in Pitcairn. A number of the early precincts contain their own local newsagents.

==Parks and Sports==
[[Image:Riverside_Park.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Riverside Park with Leven Bridge in distance]]
Glenrothes has a number of well maintained parks at [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.201691~-3.184716&style=h&lvl=16&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000| Riverside], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.209007~-3.145705&style=h&lvl=16&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000| Balbirnie], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.189968~-3.171803&style=h&lvl=17&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000| Warout], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.212492~-3.167464&style=h&lvl=16&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000| Gilvenbank], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.195293~-3.207402&style=h&lvl=17&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000| Tanshall], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.193782~-3.157706&style=h&lvl=17&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000| Dovecot], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.191042~-3.142315&style=h&lvl=16&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000| Carleton] and [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.173189~-3.161815&style=h&lvl=17&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000| Stenton]. Around one third of land in Glenrothes has been devoted to the provision of open space. The town boasts good sports facilities with 2 golf courses (Glenrothes and Balbirnie), a football stadium at Warout and a main sports complex at the [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/yourtown/index.cfm?fuseaction=facility.display&town=0F9DB065-BF8E-4BB7-85F9FB281784F80B&facid=6D500309-B69C-45C3-A47A1BBB9149F2CC Fife Institute (FIPRE)]. 

The local football team is the [http://glenrothesjuniors.tripod.com/ Glenrothes Juniors] who play at Warout Park. Glenrothes also has a [http://oldwww.scottishrugby.org/sites/Glenrothes-RFC/ rugby club] based at Carleton and a [http://www.glenrothescc.co.uk/ cricket club] who play at Riverside Park.

There are plans to build a new multi-million pound sports centre on the site of the existing Fife Institute by early 2009 [http://www.fifenow.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1019&ArticleID=2185327].

==Employment==

Glenrothes provides the highest number of jobs (approx 36,000) of any single settlement in Fife [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_foyejr.pdf] [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_Kirkcaldy16_06_06v2.pdf] [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_6bh76c.pdf]. Like most of Scotland's [[New Towns]] Glenrothes can offer flexible, modern employment premises in a number of attractive, well landscaped industrial and employment sites, all of which have excellent connections to the Central Scotland road network. The entrance to each estate is clearly defined with the use of obelisk boundary markers. 
[[Image:Viewfield_Obelisk.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Boundary Marker, Viewfield]]
Employment sites in Glenrothes are concentrated in the south of the town and at sites around the town centre. Each estate has been named, these are: [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.20039~-3.163955&style=h&lvl=15&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000 Queensway], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.189631~-3.157491&style=h&lvl=17&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000 Warout], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.184624~-3.184994&style=h&lvl=16&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000 Viewfield], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.182367~-3.205465&style=h&lvl=16&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000 Whitehill], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.177441~-3.192108&style=h&lvl=15&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000 Southfield], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.186033~-3.145384&style=h&lvl=16&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000 Eastfield], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.17885~-3.145502&style=h&lvl=15&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000 Bankhead, Westwood Park], [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.189529~-3.181363&style=h&lvl=17&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000 Pentland Park] and [http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.182964~-3.221344&style=h&lvl=16&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000 Fife Airport]. These estates are largely managed by [http://www.fife.gov.uk/orgs/index.cfm?fuseaction=display.FCSTR&orgid=60304273-A856-11D6-BF4D0002A5349AC9&contentid=5033&servid=25B7121A-72C3-4140-80B6B54A4371042D Fife Council] and [http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/fife/ Scottish Enterprise Fife].

A [[Silicon Glen]] background continues to play an important role in Glenrothes' economy. A number of [[high tech]] industrial companies are located in Glenrothes largely specialised in [[electronics]] and [[engineering]] [[manufacturing]]. One company in particular, [http://www.semefab.co.uk/ Semefab], is the UK's Primary Centre for the development of Micro Electric Mechanical Machines (MEMS) and [[Nanotechnology]]. This is expected to contribute £53 million to the Scottish Economy [http://www.semefab.co.uk/mainstory.php?PHPSESSID=3c845f8a4afa5c1ec016e3e378925500]. Other major companies include [[Raytheon]], [[Velux]] and [[Amazon.co.uk]]. The latter is the most recent company to locate in Glenrothes and take advantage of it as an employment base.
[[Image:Amazon_warehouse_Glenrothes.jpg |thumb|right|200px| Amazon Warehouse, Glenrothes]]
There are signs now however that the town's economy is beginning to diversify to service sector and other forms of employment in line with national trends. This is evident with new office developments at Viewfield and Pentland Park and the mix of uses emerging at Queensway and Bankhead.

Glenrothes is the Administrative Centre for Fife containing the Local Authority's prominent headquarters building at North Street in the town's centre. Many of the other Council departments are contained in a number of the town centre's office blocks. [[Fife Constabulary]] have established their modern headquarters at a site on Detroit Road in Viewfield and [[Scottish Enterprise]] Fife have their headquarters in Pentland Park. Other companies established in the town include the [[Inland Revenue]] and [[Virgin Media]].

==Town Precincts and Surrounding Villages==

Glenrothes is sub-divided into different areas or "residential precincts". Each precinct has its own styles of housing and most have their own local shops, primary schools and community halls. The precincts are;

Early Glenrothes precincts (Woodside up to South Parks) were based on [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s [[Garden_city_movement | Garden City]] principles and this is reflected in their housing styles and layouts. The precincts of the 1960's and 70's were based on principles of [[Radburn]], separating as far as possible footpaths from roads. Precincts from the 1980's onwards have been developed by the [[private sector]] and more reflect today's aspirations of [[suburban]] living.

Glenrothes came late into high rise development and as a result it has only a single tower block, which is located adjacent to other tall buildings in the town centre. The townscape is largely low rise until the town centre is reached where flats and taller buildings have been used. 

Glenrothes has largely avoided the mistakes of other new towns by avoiding an overuse of concrete. There are some exceptions such as the infamous Tanshall maisonettes and some town centre offices, however a number of these are now being demolished with work starting on a number of the Tanshall maisonettes[http://www.fifenow.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1019&ArticleID=2121428]. A major town centre development will also see the Glenrothes House office block demolished.

Glenrothes also serves a wider area as both a service, employment and retail centre. There are a number of attractive villages surrounding the town each unique in their own respect. The surrounding villages are [[Markinch]], [[Leslie]], [[Thornton]], [[Coaltown of Balgonie]], [[Star of Markinch]], [[Milton of Balgonie]] (with [[Balgonie Castle]]) and [[Kinglassie]]. Slightly further afield are [[Falkland]], [[Freuchie]], [[Windygates]], [[Kennoway]], [[Muirhead]], [[Auchmuirbridge]] and [[Scotlandwell]].

==Media==
Glenrothes has a weekly newspaper, the "Glenrothes Gazette" which is operated by the Fife Free Press group. The Glenrothes Gazette is published every Wednesday.

1998 saw the formation of local radio station Kingdom FM which operates on 95.2 and 92.1 [[MHz]]. This station broadcasts from the former Haig factory in the village of [[Markinch]] located immediately east of Glenrothes.

Forth FM, broadcasting from Edinburgh, also covers the south Fife area  and operates on a wave length of 97.3 MHz.

==Famous People== 

Famous People include the trumpeter John Wallace, the actor [[Dougray Scott]] and [[Henry McLeish]], the former first minister who lived there, having been brought up in neighbouring [[Kennoway]]. Glenrothes town centre is home to the building involved in the notorious "[[Officegate]]" scandal, which led to McLeish's resignation in [[2001]].
