'''Candice Michelle Beckman''' (born [[September 30]], [[1978]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]), better known as '''Candice Michelle''' or just '''Candice''' is an American model, [[actress]], and a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], currently working for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]'s ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]] brand''. 

==World Wrestling Entertainment == 
Candice Michelle signed up for the 2004 Diva Search.

===Diva Search===
Candice Michelle came to WWE as a contestant in the 2004 [[WWE Diva Search]]. Although she wasn't one of the final ten contestants to make it to the televised event, WWE hired Candice anyway and placed her on the ''RAW'' brand under the [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] of a [[makeup]] artist.

===RAW===
Initially, Candice Michelle's role was limited. She was never given an [[angle (professional wrestling)|angle]] on ''RAW'' and she rarely made [[television]] appearances unless to participate in one of the program's occasional lingerie [[pillow fight]]s or [[bikini]] contests that were held between [[Christy Hemme]], [[Maria Kanellis]], [[Stacy Keibler]], and herself. 

===SmackDown!===
On [[June 30]], [[2005]], at the end of the [[WWE Draft Lottery]], Candice Michelle was traded to the ''[[SmackDown]]!'' brand for where she became involved in a [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between [[Torrie Wilson]] and [[Melina Perez]]. Candice Michelle quickly became [[Jillian Hall]] and Melina's rival when she befriended Wilson. On [[July 24]], [[2005]], at [[The Great American Bash]], Candice Michelle served as the special guest [[referee]] for the [[Professional wrestling match types# Bra and Panties Match|Bra and Panties match]] between Torrie Wilson and Melina. Melina was victorious. After the match, Melina seemed to gain some type of confidence and pushed Candice from behind. This resulted in both divas attacking Melina and removing her bottoms as well.

===Back to RAW===
She was then moved to RAW in a trade along with Wilson, while Keibler and Hemme went to "SmackDown!" From that point on, Candice and Wilson continued to taunt [[Ashley Massaro]] (2005 WWE Diva Search Winner), bringing in [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] to attack her as part of their "initiation" for the new Diva. This continued on until [[Trish Stratus]] returned from an injury to help Massaro retaliate against Candice and her two cohorts, who became known as the [[stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] Ladies in Pink, and later known as [[Vince's Devils]], which seemed to be a play on ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''.

On the [[February 27]], [[2006]], edition of ''RAW'', Candice Michelle would get her first [[WWE Women's Championship]] match while a part of Vince's Devils in a losing effort to then-champion Trish Stratus. After this match Candice Michelle would slap Wilson, blaming her for the loss.

The team would be short-lived after this as Torrie Wilson would soon become a babyface diva once again with Candice Michelle and Victoria turning on her during Candice's Playboy cover reveal. This feud between Candice Michelle and Wilson would become a lengthy feud which led to a match in which Playboy Magazine's then-newest cover girl Candice Michelle would face off against the 2-time former cover girl (Wilson) at ''[[WrestleMania 22]]'' in a ''[[Playboy]] Pillow Fight''. Wilson would win this match but the feud would still continue on-and-off when Michelle was working backstage segments with [[Vince McMahon]], being his "[[sex]] slave". However it seems in late 2006 they resolved the feud.

Candice also appeared in both of 2006's ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' on [[NBC]]. In the [[March 18]] episode, she and [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] lost to [[Trish Stratus]] and [[Mickie James]] in a tag team match. On the [[July 15]] program, Candice was eliminated in the first round of a Divas' bikini bull riding competition which was won by [[Michelle McCool]].

On the [[July 17]], 2006 edition of ''RAW'', Candice was the special guest referee during the tag team match between [[Trish Stratus]] & [[Torrie Wilson]] vs. [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] & [[Mickie James]] . At one point, Mickie James got in Candice's face, but Candice retaliated by slapping her and tossing her out of the ring. Afterwards, Victoria tried to clothesline Candice but she ducked, allowing Trish to hit the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Springboard bulldog|Stratusfaction]] for her and Torrie Wilson to win the match. The next week Candice faced Mickie but was defeated. The following week Candice teamed with Trish to defeat Mickie and Victoria with Torrie Wilson as guest ref. On the [[September 25]], [[2006]] edition of ''RAW'', Candice lost the first round of the WWE Women's Championship Tournament to [[Amy Dumas|Lita]] after being [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|speared]] by [[Adam Copeland|Edge]]. Candice competed in the first ever Extreme Strip Poker segment on ECW on October 10, 2006 representing RAW!. 

On [[November 27]], [[2006]] edition of ''RAW'' during the Women's Battle Royal, Candice suffered a broken nose when Victoria viciously nailed her in the face with a savate kick. She had surgery on [[November 30]], [[2006]] to repair her deviated septum. She returned at [[New Years Revolution]] on [[January 7]] [[2007]], as her and with [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]] came out to fight off [[Melina Perez|Melina]] as she tried to interfere in the [[WWE Women's Championship]] match between champion [[Mickie James]] and challenger Victoria. 

Candice returned to in-ring action at a [[January 20]], [[2007]] house show, teaming with James to defeat Melina and Victoria. Mickie and Candice Michelle did the same thing on the [[January 22]] edition of ''Raw'' where she pinned Victoria in what was Candice's official return.

In her recent blog on wwe.com [http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/candice/candycoated/021507], Candice Michelle claimed that [[Melina Perez|Melina]] stole her move that she called ''Candy Clutch'' and called it "California Dreaming". Melina responded on her own blog on WWE.com and asserted the fact that she had used the move in the independent circuit as her finisher for 6 years under her moniker ''Kyra'', and called the move ''The Kyrapractor'', long before Candice got involved in wrestling or even auditioned for the [[WWE Diva Search]]. Melina also berated Candice and other Diva Search winners for not working for their place in the WWE, and showed picture proof of her applying the hold long before Candice got into wrestling.
