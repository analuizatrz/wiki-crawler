'''Owain Glyndŵr''' (Pronounced {{IPA2|'ouain glɨn'dur}}, approximately "O-wine glin-DOO-R"), or '''Owain Glyn Dŵr''', traditionally [[anglicise]]d as '''Owen Glendower''' (1359&ndash;c. 1416) and crowned as '''Owain IV of Wales''', was the last native [[Welsh people|Welsh person]] to hold the title [[Prince of Wales]].  He instigated an ultimately unsuccessful revolt against [[England|English]] rule of [[Wales]].

Glyndŵr was a descendant of the princes of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] from his father [[Gruffydd Fychan II]], Hereditary [[Tywysog]] of [[Powys Fadog]] and Lord of [[Glyndyfrdwy]], and of those of [[Deheubarth]] through his mother Elen ferch Tomas ap Llywelyn. On [[September 16]] [[1400]], Glyndŵr instigated the Welsh Revolt against the rule of [[Henry IV of England]]. Although initially successful, the uprising was eventually put down - Glyndŵr was last seen in 1412 and was never captured.

Glyndŵr has remained a notable figure in the popular culture of both Wales and England, portrayed in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s play Henry IV as a wild and exotic man ruled by magic and emotion ("at my nativity, The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, Of burning cressets, and at my birth The frame and huge foundation of the earth Shaked like a coward." - Henry IV Part 1, Act 3, scene 1). In the late 19th century the "Young Wales" movement recreated him as the father of Welsh nationalism, revising the historical image of him as a purely local leader and joining him in popular memory as a national hero on a par with [[King Arthur]].

In 2000, celebrations were held all over Wales to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the rising.

==Early life==
[[Image:Map of Wales within the United Kingdom.png|right|thumb|180px|Wales's location within the modern [[United Kingdom]] &ndash; [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are shaded in pink.]]

Glyndŵr was born to a prosperous landed family, part of the Anglo-Welsh gentry of the [[Marches]] (the border between England and Wales) of northeast Wales. This group moved easily between Welsh and English societies occupying important offices for the Marcher lords while maintaining their position as ''uchelwyr'' — nobles descended from the pre-conquest royal dynasties — in traditional Welsh society. His father, [[Gruffydd Fychan II]], Hereditary [[Tywysog]] of [[Powys Fadog]] and Lord of [[Glyndyfrdwy]], died some time before 1370 leaving Glyndŵr's mother Elen ferch Tomas ap Llywelyn of [[Deheubarth]] a widow. Owain probably had an elder brother called Madog but he may have died young.

The young Owain ''ap Gruffydd'' was fostered at the home of Sir [[David Hanmer]].  Owain is thought to have been sent to London to study law at the [[Inns of Court]]. He probably studied as a legal apprentice for seven years; enough to get a good grasp of the [[law]] but not enough to be known as a "Man of Law". He was probably in [[London]] during the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381. By 1383 he had returned to Wales, where he married Sir David's daughter, [[Margaret Hanmer|Margaret]], and established himself as the Squire of [[Sycharth]] and [[Glyndyfrdwy]].

Glyndŵr entered military service in 1384 when he undertook garrison duty under the renowned Sir Gregory Sais on the English-Scottish border. In 1385 he enlisted under the [[Earl of Arundel]] in [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]’s Scottish War. In 1387, Owain was in the South East and saw action on the high-seas at the [[Battle of Cadzand]].  Upon the death of Sir David, Glyndŵr returned to Wales as executor of the estate. Richard II regained power and Arundel was sidelined and eventually executed in 1397. Glyndŵr's opportunities were further limited by the death of Sir [[Gregory Sais]] three years later, and faced with these disappointments he returned to his estates in North Wales, living there quietly for ten years. The [[bard]] [[Iolo Goch]] ("Red Iolo") visited him throughout the 1390s and wrote a number of odes to Owain, praising Owain's liberality, and writing of Sycharth "Rare was it there/to see a latch or a lock."

===The fall of Richard II===
[[Image:Richard II of England.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Richard II of England]]]]

In the late 1390s, a series of events arrived that began to push Owain towards [[rebellion]]. In the last decade of the 14th century, Richard II had launched a bold plan to consolidate his hold on his kingdom and break the power of the magnates who constantly threatened his authority. As part of this plan, Richard began to shift his power base from the southeast toward the West. He established a new principality around the County of [[Cheshire]] and systematically built up his power in Wales. Wales was ruled through a patchwork of semi-autonomous feudal states, bishoprics, shires, and territory under direct Royal rule. Richard eliminated his rivals and took their land or gave it to his favourites. As he did so, he raised an entire class of Welsh people to fill the new posts created in his new [[fiefdom]]s. For these people, the final days of the reign of Richard II were full of opportunities. In contrast, to the English magnates, it was a sign that Richard was dangerously out of control.

In 1399, the exiled [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]], heir to the Dukedom of Lancaster, returned to reclaim his lands. Henry raised an army and marched to meet the King. Richard hurried back from Ireland to deal with Henry. They met in Wales at [[Conwy Castle]] to discuss the restitution of Henry's lands. Whatever was intended, the meeting ended when Richard was arrested, deposed and imprisoned, first at [[Chester, England|Chester]], then at [[Pontefract Castle]] in West [[Yorkshire]]. Parliament quickly made Henry regent and then King. Richard died under mysterious circumstances in Pontefract, but his death was not generally known for some time. In Wales, people like Owain were asked for the first time in their life to decide their loyalties. The Welsh were traditionally supporters of Richard, who had succeeded his father as [[Prince of Wales]]. With Richard removed the opportunities for advancement for Welsh people were suddenly severely limited. Many Welsh people seem to have been uncertain where this left them.

===The dispute with De Grey===
The revolt began as an argument with Owain's neighbour. The De Greys of Dyffryn Clwyd were Norman landowners with a reputation for being anti-Welsh. Owain was locked in a long-running land dispute with them. In 1399, he appealed to Parliament to resolve the issues. Reynold de Grey &mdash; a good friend of the new King Henry &mdash; used his influence to have Owain’s appeal rejected. Furthermore, he deliberately withheld a summons for Owain to join the King’s Scottish campaign.  Technically, as a tenant-in-chief to the King, Owain was obliged to provide troops. By not responding to the summons Owain had committed [[treason]].

==The Welsh Revolt, 1400–1415==
On [[16 September]] [[1400]], Owain acted, and was proclaimed Prince of Wales by a small band of followers which included his eldest son, his brothers-in-law, and the dean of St Asaph. This was a revolutionary statement in itself. Owain’s men quickly spread through north-east Wales. By [[September 19]] the De Grey stronghold of [[Ruthin]] was attacked and almost destroyed. [[Denbigh]], [[Rhuddlan]], [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]], [[Hawarden]], and Holt followed quickly afterward. On [[22 September]] the town of [[Oswestry]] was so badly damaged by Owain's raid that it had to be rechartered. By the 24th Owain was moving south and sacked [[Welshpool]]. Simultaneously, the Tudor brothers from [[Anglesey]] launched a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the English. The Tudors were a prominent Anglesey family who were closely associated with Richard. Gwilym and Rhys ap Tudor had been captains of archers in Richard's campaigns in Ireland. They quickly switched allegiance to their cousin, Owain Glyndŵr.

Henry IV, on his way north to invade Scotland, turned his army around and by [[26 September]] he was in [[Shrewsbury]] ready to invade Wales. In a lightning campaign, Henry led his army around North Wales. He was harassed constantly by bad weather and the attacks of Welsh guerrillas. By [[October 15]], he was back in Shrewsbury with little to show for his efforts.
[[Image:hyddgen.jpg|thumb|Memorial to the slain of the Battle of Mynydd Hyddgen]]

In 1401, the revolt began to spread. The whole of northern and central Wales went over to Owain. Multiple attacks were recorded on English towns, castles, and manors throughout the North. Even in the south in [[Brecon]] and Gwent reports began to come in of banditry and lawlessness by groups calling themselves the ''Plant Owain'' – the Children of Owain. King Henry IV appointed [[Henry Percy]] – the famous ‘Hotspur’, legendary warrior son of the powerful [[Earl of Northumberland]] – to bring the country to order. Hotspur issued an amnesty in March which applied to all rebels with the exception of Owain and his cousins, Rhys and Gwilym, sons of Tudur ap Gronw of Penmynydd (forefather of [[King Henry VII]]). Most of the country was mightily relieved and agreed to pay all the usual taxes, but the Tudur boys knew that they needed a bargaining chip if they were to lift the dire threat hanging over them. They coolly decided to capture [[Edward I]]’s great castle at [[Conwy]]. Although the garrison amounted to just fifteen men-at-arms and sixty archers, it was well stocked and easily reinforced from the sea; and in any case, the Tudur boys only had forty men. They needed a cunning plan. On Good Friday, which also happened to be [[1 April]] – All Fool’s Day – all but five of the garrison were in the little church in the town when a carpenter appeared at the castle gate, who according to [[Adam of Usk]]’s Chronicon, ‘feigned to come for his accustomed work’. Once inside, the Welsh chippy attacked the two guards and threw open the gate to allow the gang to rush in. Although Hotspur arrived from [[Denbigh]] with 120 men-at-arms and 300 archers, he knew it would take a great deal more to get inside so formidable a fortress and, forced to negotiate, he finally gave the Tudur boys their pardon. 

Owain also scored his first major victory in the field. In June, at [[Mynydd Hyddgen]] in west Wales, Owain and his army of four hundred were camped at the bottom of the Hyddgen Valley when fifteen hundred English and Flemish settlers from Pembrokeshire charged down on them. Owain rallied his army and fought back, killing 200 and making prisoners of the rest. The situation was sufficiently serious for the king to assemble another punitive expedition. This time he attacked through central Wales. From Shrewsbury and [[Hereford]], Henry IV's forces drove through [[Powys]] toward the Abbey of Strata Florida. The [[Cistercian]] house was known to be sympathetic towards Owain and Henry intended to remind them of their loyalties and prevent the revolt from spreading any further south. After terrible weather and constant harassment by the Plant Owain he reached [[Strata Florida Abbey|Strata Florida]]. Henry was in no mood to be merciful. After a two-day drinking session, he partially destroyed the abbey and executed monks suspected of pro-Owain loyalties. However, he failed to engage Owain's forces in any large numbers. ''Plant Owain'' harassed him and engaged in hit-and-run tactics on his supply chain but refused to fight in the open. Henry was forced to retreat. As he did so the weather turned. The army was nearly washed away in floods and Henry almost died when his tent was blown down. Wet, starving, and dejected, they returned to Hereford with nothing to claim for their efforts.

The English saw that if the revolt prospered it would inevitably attract disaffected supporters of the deposed king. They were concerned about the potential for disaffection in Cheshire and were increasingly worried about the news from North Wales. Hotspur complained that he was not receiving sufficient support from the king and that the repressive policy of Henry was only encouraging revolt. He argued that negotiation and compromise could persuade Owain to end his revolt. In fact, as early as 1401, Hotspur may have been in secret negotiations with Owain and other leaders of the revolt to attempt to negotiate a settlement. The core Lancastrian supporters would have none of this. They struck back with anti-Welsh legislation designed to establish English dominance in Wales. The laws actually codified common practices that had been at work in Wales and along the Marches for many years. However, they sent a message to many of those who were wavering that the English viewed all the Welsh with equal suspicion. Many Welshmen who had tried to further their careers in English service now felt pushed into the rebellion as the middle ground between Owain and Henry disappeared.

In the same year, Owain captured his arch enemy, Reynald de Grey in an ambush at Ruthin. He was to hold him for a year until he received a substantial ransom from Henry. In June Owain's forces encountered an army led by Sir [[Edmund Mortimer]], the uncle of the Lord of the March, at [[Battle of Bryn Glas|Bryn Glas]] in central Wales. Mortimer's army was badly defeated and Mortimer was captured. It is reported that the Welsh women following Owain’s army, killed the wounded English and mutilated the bodies of the dead, supposedly in revenge for plundering and rape by the English the previous year. Glyndŵr offered to release Mortimer for a large ransom but, in sharp contrast to his attitude to De Grey, Henry IV refused to pay. In response, Sir Edmund negotiated an alliance with Owain and married one of Owain's daughters, [[Catrin ferch Owain Glyndŵr |Catrin]].

It is also in 1402, that mentions of the [[French people|French]] and [[Brittany|Bretons]] helping Owain were first heard. The French were certainly hoping to use Wales as they had used Scotland as a base from which to fight the English. French [[privateers]] began to attack English ships in the [[Irish Sea]] and provide weapons to the Welsh. French and Breton [[freebooters]] were also active in Owain's attacks.

===The Revolt spreads===
[[Image:Caernarfon castle interior.jpg|thumb|300px|The ward of [[Caernarfon Castle]], besieged by Glyndŵr in 1403, showing (from left to right) the Black Tower, the Chamberlain's Tower, and the Eagle Tower.]]1403 marks the year when the revolt became truly national. Owain struck out to the west and the south. Recreating [[Llywelyn the Great]]'s campaign in the west, Owain marched down the Tywi Valley. Village after village rose to join him. English manors and castles fell or their inhabitants surrendered. Finally, [[Carmarthen]], one of the main English power-bases in the west, fell and was occupied by Owain. Owain then turned around and attacked [[Glamorgan]] and Gwent. The castle at [[Abergavenny]] in Gwent was attacked and burnt. Owain pushed on down to the coast, burning [[Usk]] and taking [[Cardiff]] and [[Newport]]. Royal officials report that Welsh students at Oxford were leaving their studies for Owain and Welsh labourers and craftsmen were abandoning their employers and returning to Wales in droves. Owain could also draw on the seasoned troops from the English campaigns in France. Hundreds of Welsh archers and men-at-arms left English service to join the rebellion.

In the north, Owain's supporters launched a second attack on [[Caernarfon Castle]] (this time with French support) and almost captured it. In response, [[Henry V of England|Henry of Monmouth]] (the son of Henry IV and the future [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]]) attacked and burned Owain's homes at [[Glyndyfrdwy]] and [[Sycharth]]. The situation became much worse &ndash; Hotspur defected to Owain. Raising his standard of revolt in Cheshire – a bastion of support for Richard II – he challenged his cousin Henry's right to the throne. His young protégé, Henry of Monmouth, then only 16, turned to the north to meet Hotspur. On [[July 21]], Henry arrived in Shrewsbury just before Hotspur forcing the rebel army to camp outside the town. Henry forced the [[Battle of Shrewsbury|battle]] before the Earl of Northumberland had managed to reach Shrewsbury. Thus, Henry was able to fight before the full strength of the rebels was present and on ground of his own choosing. The battle lasted all day. When the cry went out that Hotspur had fallen, the rebels' resistance began to falter and crumble. By the end of the day, Hotspur was dead and his rebellion was over. Over 300 knights had died and up to 20,000 men were killed or injured.

In 1404, Owain captured and garrisoned the great western castles of [[Harlech Castle|Harlech]] and [[Aberystwyth Castle|Aberystwyth]]. Anxious to demonstrate his seriousness as a ruler, he held court at Harlech and appointed the devious and brilliant [[Gruffydd Yonge]] as his chancellor. Soon afterwards he called his first Parliament (or more properly a "Cynulliad" or "gathering") of all Wales at [[Machynlleth]] where he was crowned '''[[Owain IV of Wales]]''' and announced his national programme. He declared his vision of an independent Welsh state with a parliament and separate Welsh church. There would be two national [[university|universities]] (one in the south and one in the north) and return to the [[Welsh law|traditional law]] of [[Hywel Dda]]. Senior churchmen and important members of society flowed to his banner. English resistance was reduced to a few isolated castles, walled towns, and fortified manors.

===Tripartite indenture and The Year of the French===
Owain demonstrated his new status by negotiating the "Tripartite Indenture" with Edmund Mortimer and the Earl of Northumberland. The Indenture agreed to divide England and Wales between the three of them. Wales would extend as far as the rivers [[River Severn|Severn]] and [[River Mersey|Mersey]] including most of [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]], and [[Herefordshire]]. The Mortimer Lords of March would take all of southern and western England and Thomas Percy, the Earl of Northumberland, would take the north of England. Most historians have dismissed the Indenture as a flight of fantasy. However, it must be remembered that in early 1404 things still looked positive for Owain. Local English communities in [[Shropshire]], [[Herefordshire]] and [[Montgomeryshire]] had ceased active resistance and were making their own treaties with the rebels. It was rumoured that old allies of Richard II were sending money and arms to the Welsh and the [[Cistercian]]s and [[Franciscan]]s were funneling funds to support the rebellion. Furthermore, the Percy rebellion was still viable; even after the defeat of the Percy Archbishop Scope in May. In fact the Percy rebellion was not to end until 1408 when the Sheriff of Yorkshire defeated Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland at [[Bramham Moor]]. Thus, far from a flight of fantasy, Owain was capitalising on the political situation to make the best deal he possibly could.

Things were improving on the international front too. Although negotiations with the [[Scottish people|Scots]] and the Lords of [[Ireland]] were unsuccessful, Owain had reasons to hope that the French and Bretons might be more welcoming. Quickly Owain dispatched Yonge and his brother-in-law, John Hanmer, to France to negotiate a treaty with the French. The result was a formal treaty that promised French aid to Owain and the Welsh. The immediate effect seems to have been that joint Welsh and Franco-Breton forces attacked and laid siege to [[Kidwelly Castle]]. The Welsh could also count on semi-official fraternal aid from their fellow Celts in the then independent Brittany and Scotland. Scots and French privateers were operating around Wales throughout Owain’s war. Scots ships had raided English settlements on the [[Lleyn peninsula|Llyn Peninsula]] in 1400 and 1401. In 1403 a Breton squadron defeated the English in the Channel and devastated [[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]] and [[Plymouth]] while the French made a landing on the [[Isle of Wight]]. By 1404 they were raiding the coast of England, with Welsh troops on board, setting fire to [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] and devastating the coasts of [[Devon]].

1405 was the "Year of the French" in Wales. On the continent the French pressed the English as the French army invaded English [[Aquitaine]]. Simultaneously, the French landed in force at [[Milford Haven]] in west Wales. They had left [[Brest, France|Brest]] in July with more than twenty-eight hundred knights and men-at-arms led by [[Jean de Rieux]], the Marshall of France. Unfortunately, they had not been provided with sufficient fresh water and many horses had died. They also brought modern [[siege]] equipment. Joined by Owain's forces they marched inland and took the town of [[Haverfordwest]] but failed to take the castle. They then moved on and retook [[Carmarthen]] and laid siege to [[Tenby]]. What happened next is something of a mystery. The Franco-Welsh force marched across South Wales (according to local tradition) and invaded England. They marched through Herefordshire and into Worcestershire. They met the English army west of [[Worcester]] either at the [[Iron Age]] hill fort of Woodbury Hill or at nearby [[Abberley]] Hill. The armies took up battle positions and viewed each other without any action for eight days. Then, for reasons that have never been clear, both sides withdrew. The Welsh and French withdrew back through Wales into the West. More French were to arrive as the year went on but the high-point of French involvement had passed. The main theory why both sides withdrew from their positions and headed homewards is as follows. The English force with their backs to Worcester, on home ground, well supplied and inside England, were able to lay siege to their opponents by surrounding them, thereby preventing vital supplies of food and drink reaching the "invading" Franco-Welsh army. This, slowly but surely, weakened both the body and spiritual resolve of the Welshmen in continuing the struggle deep into their enemy's territory.

===The Rebellion founders===
[[Image:Charles VI the Well-Beloved.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Charles VI of France]] did not continue to support Glyndŵr's revolt.]]By 1406, most French forces had withdrawn after politics shifted in Paris toward the peace party. Even Owain's so-called "[[Pennal]] Letter", in which he promised the [[King of France|King]] [[Charles VI of France]] and [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon Pope]] [[Benedict XIII]] to shift the allegiance of the Welsh Church from [[Rome]] to [[Avignon]], produced no effect.

There were other signs the revolt was encountering problems. Early in the year Owain’s forces suffered defeats at [[Grosmont]] and [[Usk]] (Pwll Melyn). Although it is very difficult to understand what happened at these two battles, it appears that Henry of Monmouth or possibly [[Sir John Talbot]] defeated substantial Welsh raiding parties led by Rhys Gethin (“Swarthy Rhys”) and Owain’s eldest son, Gruffudd. The exact date and order of these battles is subject to dispute. However, they may have resulted in the death of Rhys Gethin and Owain's brother, Tudur, and the capture of Gruffudd. Gruffudd was sent to the Tower of London and after six years died in prison. Henry also showed that the English were engaged in more and more desperate tactics. [[Adam of Usk]] says that after the Battle of Pwll Melyn near Usk, Henry had three hundred prisoners beheaded in front of [[Usk Castle]]. John ap Hywel, Abbot of the [[Llantarnam]] Cistercian monastery, was killed during the Battle of Usk as he ministered to the dying and wounded on both sides. More serious for the rebellion, English forces landed in Anglesey from Ireland. Over the next year they would gradually push the Welsh back until the resistance in Anglesey formally ended toward the end of 1406.

At the same time, the English were adopting a different strategy. Rather than focusing on punitive expeditions favoured by Henry IV, the young Henry of Monmouth adopted a strategy of economic blockade. Using the castles that remained in English control he gradually began to retake Wales while cutting off trade and the supply of weapons. By 1407 this strategy was beginning to bear fruit. In March, 1,000 men from all over [[Flintshire]] appeared before the Chief Justice of the county and agreed to pay a communal fine for their adherence to Glyndŵr. Gradually the same pattern was repeated throughout the country. In July the Earl of Arundel’s north-east lordship submitted. One by one the lordships began to surrender. By midsummer, Owain’s castle at [[Aberystwyth]] was under siege. That autumn the castle surrendered. In 1409 it was the turn of [[Harlech]]. Last minute desperate envoys were sent to the French for help. There was no response. Gruffudd Yonge was sent to Scotland to attempt to coordinate action but nothing was to come. The castle fell. Edmund Mortimer died in the final battle and Owain’s wife Margaret along with two of his daughters (including Catrin) and three of his Mortimer granddaughters were taken prisoner and incarcerated in the [[Tower of London]]. They were all to die in the Tower before 1415.

Owain remained free but now he was a hunted guerilla leader. The revolt continued to splutter on. In 1409 or 1410, Owain readied his supporters for a last raid deep into [[Shropshire]]. Many of his most loyal commanders were present. It may have been a last desperate [[suicide]] raid. Whatever was intended, the raid went terribly wrong and many of the leading figures still at large were captured. [[Rhys Ddu]] ("Black Rhys") of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], one of Owain’s most faithful commanders, was captured and taken to London for execution. A chronicle of the time states that Rhys Ddu was: ''"…laid on a hurdle and so drawn forth to Tyburn through the city and was there hanged and let down again. His head was smitten off and his body quartered and sent to four towns and his head set on London Bridge."'' [[Philip Scudamore]] and [[Rhys ap Tudur]] were also beheaded and their heads displayed at [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Chester]] (no doubt to discourage any further thoughts of rebellion).

In 1412, Owain captured and later ransomed a leading Welsh supporter of Henry's, [[Dafydd Gam]] ("Crooked David"), in an ambush in Brecon. These were the last flashes of the revolt. This was the last time that Owain was seen alive. As late at 1414, there were rumours that the Lollard leader, Sir [[John Oldcastle]], was communicating with Owain and reinforcements were sent to the major castles in the north and south. Outlaws and bandits left over from the rebellion were still active in Snowdonia.

But by then things were changing. Henry IV died in 1413 and his son began to adopt a conciliatory attitude to the Welsh. Pardons were offered to the major leaders of the revolt and other opponents of his father's regime. In a symbolic gesture, the body of Richard II was interred in [[Westminster Abbey]]. In 1415 [[Henry V]] offered a pardon to Owain as he prepared for war with France. There is evidence that the new King Henry was in negotiations with Owain's son, [[Maredudd ab Owain Glyndŵr]], but nothing was to come of it. In 1416 Maredudd was offered a pardon but refused. Perhaps his father was still alive and he was unwilling to accept the pardon while he lived. He finally accepted a pardon in 1421, suggesting that Owain was dead.  There is some evidence to suggest, in the poetry of the bard Llawdden for example, that a few diehards continued to fight on after 1421 under the leadership of Owain's son-in-law [[Phylib ap Rhys]].

The [[Annals of Owain Glyndwr]] taken from the medieval manuscript '''Panton MS. 22''' finish in the year 1422. The last entry regarding the prince reads;

:''1415 - Owain went into hiding on [[St Matthew]]'s Day in Harvest (September 21), and thereafter his hiding place was unknown. Very many said that he died; the [[seer]]s maintain he did not.''

==Disappearance and legacy==
Nothing is known of Owain after 1412. Despite enormous rewards being offered he was never captured. Tradition has that he either died and was buried at his estate in [[Sycharth]] or on the estates of his daughters' husbands &mdash; [[Kentchurch]] in [[Herefordshire]] or [[Monnington]]. Owain's daughter, Alys, had married [[Sir Henry Scudamore]], the Sheriff of Herefordshire. Somehow he had weathered the war and remained in office. It was rumoured that Owain finally retreated to their home at Kentchurch. In his book "The Mystery of Jack of Kent and the Fate of Owain Glyndŵr", Alex Gibon argues that the folk hero Jack of Kent &ndash; the family chaplain of the Scudamore family &ndash; was Owain Glyndŵr. Gibbon points out a number of similarities between Kent and Glyndŵr (including physical appearance) and claims that Owain spent his last years living with Alys passing himself off as an aging Franciscan friar.

A grandchild of the Scudamore's was [[Sir John Donne]] (d. 1503) of [[Kidwelly]], a successful Yorkist courtier, diplomat and soldier, who after 1485 made an accommodation with his fellow-Welshman [[Henry VII]]. Through the Donne family many prominent English families are descended from Owain, including the [[De Vere]] Earls of Oxford and the [[Cavendish]] Dukes of Devonshire.

In 2006 The [[Owain Glyndwr Society]]'s president Adrien Jones said: "Four years ago we visited a direct descendant of Glyndwr, a John Skidmore, at Kentchurch Court, near Abergavenny. "He took us to Monnington Straddle, in Herefordshire, where one of Glyndwr's daughters, Alice, had lived. Mr Skidmore told us that he (Glyndŵr) spent his last days there and eventually died there. It was a family secret for 600 years and even Mr Skidmore's mother, who died shortly before we visited, refused to reveal the secret. There's even a mound where he is believed to be buried at Monnington Straddle." [http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/db.php?smr_no=890 1]

===The aftermath in Wales===
By 1415, English rule was returned to Wales. The leading rebels were dead, imprisoned, or impoverished through massive fines. Scarcely a parish or family in Wales, English or Welsh, had not been affected in some way. The cost in loss of life, physical destruction, and ruined lives was enormous. Wales, already a poor country, was further impoverished by pillage, economic blockade and communal fines. Reports by travellers talk of ruined castles and abbeys. Grass grew in the market squares of many towns and commerce had almost ground to a halt. Land that had previously been productive was now empty wasteland with no tenants to work the land. As late as 1492, a Royal Official in lowland [[Glamorgan]] was still citing the devastation caused by the revolt as the reason why he was unable to deliver promised revenues to the King.

Many prominent families were ruined. In 1411, John Hanmer pleaded poverty as a reason why he could not pay the fines imposed on him. The Tudors no longer lorded it over [[Anglesey]] and northwest Wales as they had done throughout the late 14th century. The family seemed finished until the third Tudor brother, Maredudd, went to [[London]] and established a new destiny for the family. Others eventually surrendered and made peace with the new order. The redoubtable [[Henry Dwn]] who with the French and Bretons had laid siege to [[Kidwelly Castle]] in 1403 and 1404 made his peace and accepted a fine. Somehow he avoided paying a [[penny]]. For many years after his surrender and despite official proscriptions, he sheltered rebels on the run, levied fines on 200 individuals that had not supported him, rode around the county with his retinue, and even plotted the murder of the King’s justice. Nevertheless, his grandson fought with [[Henry V]] in 1415 at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Others could not fit into the new order. An unknown number of Owain’s supporters went into exile. [[Henry Gwyn]] ("White Henry") — heir to the substantial Lordship of [[Llansteffan]] — left Wales forever and was to die in the service of the King of France facing his old comrades at Agincourt. Gruffydd Yonge was another permanent exile. By 1415 he was in Paris. He was to live another 20 years being first Bishop of [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]] in [[Scotland]] and later of [[Hippo Regius|Hippo]] in [[North Africa]].

===Modern legacy===
After Owain's death, there was little resistance to English rule until, in the 16th century, the [[Tudor dynasty]], whilst allowing Welshmen to become more prominent in English society, saw Owain's revolt as a catastrophe for Wales. In "Henry IV" [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] portrays him as wild and exotic; a man ruled by magic and emotion in sharp contrast to the logical and reasonable Hotspur. It was not until the late 19th century that Owain's reputation was to be revived. The "[[Cymru Fydd|Young Wales]]" movement recreated him as the father of Welsh nationalism. The discovery of Owain's Great Seal and his letters to the French in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliotheque Nationale]] helped revise historical images of him as a purely local leader. In the [[First World War]], the Welsh [[Prime Minister]], [[David Lloyd George]], unveiled a statue to him in [[Cardiff]] town hall and a postcard showing Owain at the [[Battle of Mynydd Hyddgen]] was sold to raise money for wounded Welsh soldiers. Folk memory in Wales had always held him in high regard and almost every parish has some landmark or story about Owain. 

He joined the long list of failed resistance to English rule in the British Isles, was remembered as a national hero on a par with [[King Arthur]] and numerous small groups have adopted his symbolism to advocate independence or nationalism for Wales. For example, during the 1980s, a group calling themselves "[[Meibion Glyndwr]]" claimed responsibility for the burning of English holiday homes in Wales. However, perhaps ironically, Glyndwr was part English himself.  Welsh legend states that when Wales is threatened again then he will rise from the his unknown resting place in Wales in order to lead the defence of Wales, quite like the legend of King Arthur.  The creation of the [[National Assembly for Wales]] brought him back into the spotlight and in 2000 celebrations were held all over Wales to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the rising. Stamps were issued with his likeness and streets, parks, and public squares were named after him throughout Wales. Owain’s personal standard — the quartered arms of Powys and Deheubarth rampant — began to be seen all over Wales, especially at [[rugby union|rugby]] matches against the English. An energetic campaign exists to make [[September 16]], the date Owain raised his standard, a [[national holiday]] in Wales. An annual award for achievement in the arts and literature, the [[Glyndŵr Award]], is named after him.
