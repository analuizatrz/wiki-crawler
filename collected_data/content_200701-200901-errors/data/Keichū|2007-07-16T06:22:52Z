{{nihongo|'''Keichū'''|契沖|}} ([[1640]] - [[April 3]] [[1701]]) was a Buddhist priest and a scholar of [[Kokugaku]] in the mid [[Edo period]]. Keichū’s grandfather was a personal retainer of [[Kato Kiyomasa]] but his father was a [[rōnin]] from the [[Amagasaki]] fief. When he was 13, Keichū left home to become an acolyte of the [[Shingon]] sect, studying at Kaijō in [[Myōhōji]], [[Imasato]], [[Osaka]]. He subsequently attained the post of [[Ajari]] (or Azari) at [[Mount Koya|Mount Kōya]], and then became chief priest at Mandara-in in [[Ikutama]], [[Osaka]]. It was at this time that he became friends with the poet-scholar [[Shimonokōbe Chōryū]] (下河辺長流:[[1624]] – [[1686]]). 

However, he disliked the worldly duties of his work and, after wandering around the Kinki region for a while, made his way back to Mount Kōya. Deeply influenced by the thinking of [[Kūkai]], he also read widely in Japanese classics under the patronage of [[Fuseya Shigeta]] (伏屋重賢), a patron of the arts in [[Izumi Province]]. After serving as chief priest at Myōhōji, Keichū spent his last years at Enju’an in [[Kōzu]] in the Province of [[Settsu province|Settsu]].

His prolific works set a new standard in the study of the classics, though building on recent revivals of interest in the subject. When the [[daimyo]] of [[Mito]], [[Tokugawa Mitsukuni]], decided to sponsor an edition of the [[Man'yōshū]], he commissioned Shimonokōbe Chōryū, heir to the learning of the great poet and Man’yō expert [[Kinoshita Chōshōshi]] (木下長嘯子:[[1569]] – [[1649]]), to undertake the project. However his dilatory approach, combined with illness, and finally death, impeded his work and the task fell to Keichū, a close friend. The result was the latter’s  ''Man’yō Daishōki'' (万葉集大匠記:1687-1690), which had a profound effect on [[kokugaku]] scholarship. Similarly his ''[[Waji]] Seiranshō'' ([[1693]]: ''A Treatise on the Proper way to Write Japanese Words'') challenged the standard orthographical conventions set by [[Fujiwara Teika]] and reconstructed distinctions in the old Japanese lexicon based on the earliest texts. In addition to these Keichū wrote the ''Kōganshō'' (厚顔抄 [[1691]] ''A Brazen-faced Treatise'', the ''Kokin Yozaishō'', the ''Seigodan'', the ''Genchū Shūi'', and the ''[[Hyakunin Isshu]] Kaikanshō''.
