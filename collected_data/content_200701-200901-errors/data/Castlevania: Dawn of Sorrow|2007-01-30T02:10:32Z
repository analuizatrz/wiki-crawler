==Plot==
The game revolves around the protagonist, [[Soma Cruz]], one year after the events of ''[[Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow]]'', and his involvement with an enigmatic cult that seeks to kill Soma and revive Dracula. Instead of running from the threat, Soma decides to take the initiative and tracks them down to a castle, where he then takes on the task of destroying the cult.

==Gameplay==
''Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow'' is a platform game with RPG stat-building elements.<ref name="gamespyrev">{{cite web

| accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> The player guides Soma Cruz through a large sprawling castle, where he or she has almost free reign to go wherever he or she wishes.  However, similar to the ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]'' series, certain areas are inaccessible until the player defeats key enemies and obtains critical items.  Along the way, the player must defeat a horde of monsters that roam the various rooms of the castle with the weapons he or she finds along the way. The more enemies the player defeats, and the stronger the enemy, the more experience points they get, which enables them to [[Experience point|level up]] and improve their abilities.<ref name="gamespotreview">{{cite web

The game features the "Tactical Soul" system from ''Aria of Sorrow'', where Soma can absorb the soul of an enemy he defeats and can use their power. ''Dawn of Sorrow'' improves on the previous system by allowing the player to upgrade most soul abilities by acquiring multiple copies of the same soul<ref name="1upreview">{{cite web

A new feature, the "Magic Seal" system, makes use of the system's touch screen. Using the DS stylus, the player must draw an intricate pattern known as a magic seal on the touch screen in order to trap defeated boss enemies. If the seal is not drawn correctly, the boss will regenerate some energy and continue to fight. The touch screen can also be used to break certain blocks, navigate menus, select a warp point, and control certain [[familiar]]s.<ref name="ignreview">

The game also has a multiplayer vs. mode, where one player creates a section of the castle, complete with enemies, and both players race to defeat the enemies and reach the end of the level; players are also able to trade souls they've found in the game.

{{spoiler}}
===Julius Mode===
By finishing the game once with either the true ending or the worst ending (in which Soma awakens as the Dark Lord), the player unlocks Julius Mode,<ref name="gamefaqcheat">

[[Julius Belmont|Julius]] is armed with the traditional whip, Vampire Killer, Axe, Holy Water, Cross Boomerang, and his Cross Crash special attack. [[Yoko Belnades]] is a witch who fights like her ancestor Sypha Belnades with a staff and fire, ice, and lightning spells.  [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]] attacks with the Alucard Sword, Hellfire spell, and has the ability to turn into a bat.

As the separate Boss Rush Mode requires one to select a save file, it is possible to play a Julius Mode Boss Rush. It is identical to the Boss Rush Mode using Soma, except that any items one wins have no practical use.
{{endspoilers}}

==Characters==
===Protagonists===
* [[Soma Cruz]] - Main playable character.
* [[Yoko Belnades]] - Introduces the player to the Magic Seal System and can upgrade weapons using acquired souls.
* [[Hammer (castlevania)|Hammer]] - Sells and buys items.
* [[Mina Hakuba]]- The best friend of Soma
* [[Genya Arikado]]- The disguised form of Alucard
* [[Julius Belmont]]- The most recent Belmont of the Series

===Antagonists===
* '''Celia Fortner''' - Celia is the founder of [[Celia's Cult]] (With Light) bent on orchestrating the coming of the next Dark Lord. The loss of Dracula made Celia worry that her powers might wane. She plans to plunge Soma's mind into darkness in order to seize the power of the Dark Lord. The player never fights Celia.
* '''Dario Bossi''' - One of Dracula's potential successors, Dario has the ability to manipulate fire. He was born with this ability when Dracula was defeated in 1999. His fiery personality and impulsive tendencies push him to immediate action.  He rivals with Dmitrii to become the Dark Lord.
* '''Dmitrii Blinov''' - Dracula's other potential successor, Dmitrii has the ability to mirror magical powers gaining him the title, The Mirror. Although he seems irresponsible, Dmitrii will stop at nothing to accomplish his goal of discovering the purpose behind his abilities.  He rivals with Dario to become the Dark Lord.

{{spoiler}}
===Bosses===
* Flying Armor- A rather simple boss, simply floats in midair, constantly moving. Attacks with a pair of levitating swords.
* Balore  ([[Balor]])- The mythical king of giants, only his upper part is fought. He attacks with his enchanted eye, and constantly pounding the arena with his massive fists. He was originally fought in [[Aria of Sorrow]], but his strength is weaker than it was in AoS.
* [[Malphas]]- A demon who has the ability to fly, he summons waves of crows or orbs of dark power to attack.
* [[Puppet Master]]- A giant [[marionette]] with a big head and many arms controlled by strings. It creates a puppet that it drags into [[Iron maiden (torture device)|iron maidens]], then trades that puppet's place with the player, inflicting heavy damage; this attack is an obvious reference to [[voodoo]]. It also spews out little dolls, probably [[mannequin]]s, to restrict the player's movements.
* [[Rahab (demon)|Rahab]]- A subaquatic, demonic fish, it constantly moves around the battlefield, and either jumps to the other side of the arena (releasing in the process a flurry of droplets which cause damage), emerges to purposelessly spin above the water level, or to fire an icy blast. It's possible that he has something to do with the sword bearing his name in Aria of Sorrow.
* Gergoth- A bestial enemy living in the top of the Condemned Tower, it can attack with a crushing pounce, an attack where it draws breath, reeling Soma towards it to inflict damage, or a superpowered laser beam. Eventually it will shatter the blocks that keep it in the top level, crushing all levels down to the first level of the Tower.
* Zephyr- A demon with powers above time, it can temporarily freeze time to attack, and it can jump to the ceiling and dash with clawed fingers, throw daggers, or dash without jumping to the ceiling.
* Bat Company- A massive group of bats that amass themselves to adopt different shapes: those of a giant hand that can inflict heavy damage in close quarters, a giant mouth that shoots out damaging sonar waves (remincent of the Moai head enemies from ''[[Gradius]]''), a massive sphere of disembodied bats, or a massive bat.
* [[Paranoia (disambiguation)|Paranoia]]- A monster that is actually fought twice- a miniature Paranoia that's the size of Soma, and a great Paranoia. The small one attacks with a small weapon, while the great one hovers above Soma and charges. Both can disappear within the grand mirrors set in their respective rooms, and fire reflective energy beams that rebound in four hand mirrors that float in the arena.
* Aguni  ([[Agni]])- A demon possessing Dario and granting him greater power. It's a horned skull set in a flaming skeletal torso. It has the ability to claw its victim, fly to the ceiling and fall, causing a ripple of flame, throw fire projectiles that ripple along the ground and rapidly fly around. Since killing Dario will result in the game ending, Soma must destroy Aguni by entering the mirror in which he hides.
* [[Death (Castlevania)|Death]]- The grim reaper, it has two forms: one in which it wears a closed robe and a hat, and a second one in which the robe is open and has no hat. Among its wide array of attack patterns are: vanishing into thin air, then hacking with its scythe from behind, spinning its scythe to conjure a circle of small sickles, summoning three copies of itself to attack, casting a spell that brings great skulls to the arena, which inflict heavy damage, and dashing to attack at ground level by brandishing its scythe.
* [[Abaddon (disambiguation)|Abaddon]]- Fought in The Abyss, this half-man, half-locust uses its wand to summon its main and only attack: swarms of locusts. Problem is, even though it is its only attack, it inflicts massive amounts of damage if they are not avoided or destroyed correctly. The movement of its wand determines the path the locusts will follow. Other than that, it just hops mindlessly across the relatively small arena.
* [[Menace]]- A humungous combination of the demons Dmitrii absorbed, it is fought in two shapes: an unmoving assembly of distorted human and other parts, and a massive demon with two weak faces. In the first round, its horned head must be destroyed, and it attacks by summoning spears from above, and a poison mist from below the horned head. In the second, it can attack by punching, kicking, or with the mis-shapen miniature monsters it generaties, which explode on contact, causing massive damage. In this form, both of the weak faces must be attacked: one on its knee, the another shielded within its skull, which periodically opens its jaw to reveal the face.
* '''Soma Cruz''' or '''Dracula''' - Julius Mode only. Soma uses several souls he can obtain in the normal gameplay mode.  In his first form, Soma uses the attack of a Great Axe Armor and a Gaibon familiar. In his second form, he transforms into a giant monster (the same one used in [[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood]]), that uses a string of attacks, including the use of the Larva, Harpy, Aguni and Abaddon souls.

==Awards and Reception==
{{Expand|date=January 2007}}
Generally, ''Dawn of Sorrow'' received high praise from reviewers, with a 89/100 average rating of 52 published reviews<ref>{{cite web

| title=MetaCritic: Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow
| publisher=[http://www.metacritic.com/ Metacritic.com]
| accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>. Though there wasn't a huge leap in graphics between ''Dawn of Sorrow'' and its predecessor, ''Aria of Sorrow'', critics didn't seem to mind<ref name="ignreview" /><ref name="gamespyrev" />. In fact, it gained praise for following the " tried-and-true Castlevania formula"<ref name="gamespotreview" />.  Critics, however, were unimpressed by the game's use of the touchscreen features with it being described as "ancillary in practice"<ref name="gamespotreview" />. The "seal drawing" aspect of the game is often lambasted as being "not all that necessary"<ref name="ignrevew" />, awkward<ref name="gamespotreview" /> and "more [of a] gimmick"<ref name="gamespyrev" />.

''Dawn of Sorrow'' won several awards since it's release:
*[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]: Game of the Month (Issue #197), Gold Medal{{Fact|date=January 2007}}
*[[IGN]]: Editors' Choice Award<ref>{{cite web

*[[Nintendo Power]] : 2005 Best GBA/DS Graphics{{Fact|date=January 2007}}

==Trivia==

* Several enemies in Dawn of Sorrow were sprites also used in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'', including bosses Slogra and Gaibon as standard enemies and the boss Karasuman (renamed Malphas).  Subsequently, many enemies and their sprites were reused in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]''.

*The game's artwork, including the box cover, the movie that plays if the game is left at the title screen, and the character portraits, are drawn in a distinct [[anime]] style. This is because the game's producer Koji Igarashi also wanted to market the game to audiences who watched cartoons.

* The Silenced Ruins area is a direct tribute to the first ''Akumajou Dracula''/''[[Vampire Killer]]'' game for the [[MSX]]—in addition to similar visual designs, the background music is a remix of the background music for the first stages of this title that started the series, ''Vampire Killer.'' Also, the boss in this area, the Bat Company, is a reference to the original ''[[Castlevania (video game)|Castlevania]]'', where the first boss was a giant bat.

*''Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow'' contains three items, the Crown, the Bell, and the Konami Man, as homages to the original NES ''[[Castlevania (video game)|Castlevania]]''.  They have no effect on gameplay, although they can be sold to Hammer for money.

*By inserting Aria of Sorrow in the Game Boy Advance slot, a doll resembling Mina appears in Yoko's shop. The player also receives the rare ring from the start of the game.  However, this does not work with the more recently released [[Castlevania: Double Pack]].

*In Julius Mode, Soma's final form is the same sprite of Dracula's final form from the game ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood]]''.<ref name="karasumanfaq">{{cite web
