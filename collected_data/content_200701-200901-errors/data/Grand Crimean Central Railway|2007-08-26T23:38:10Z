The '''Grand Crimean Central Railway''' was built in 1855 during the [[Crimean War]].  It was built at cost in a very short time by a partnership of English railway contractors.  The railway played an essential part in conveying supplies, particularly [[ammunition]], to the [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854-1855)|besieging Sevastopol]], and was largely responsible for the eventual ending of the siege in September 1855.

The Russians sold the track to the Turks soon after the hostilities ceased and it was quickly removed.

==The start of the siege==
Britain and [[France]] declared war on [[Russia]] on [[28 March]] [[1854]] in support of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>[http://www.datesofhistory.com/Declaration-of-War-Great-Britain.event.html World History Database:Declaration of War], accessed [[24 August]] [[2007]]</ref> By the late summer of 1854 the British, led by [[Lord Raglan]], together with their [[France|French]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] allies decided that a [[siege]] of the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Sevastopol]], held by the [[Russians]], would be the best method of forcing an end to the war.<ref>Cooke, pp1-3</ref>

After landing their forces to the north of Sevastopol, the British set up a base in the narrow harbour of [[Balaklava|Balaclava]], about {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} south of Sevastopol, in September 1854. Most of the land between Balaclava and Sevastopol was a [[plateau]] about {{convert|600|ft|m|0}} above [[sea level]]. The towns were connected by a road, little more than a track, which travelled northwards, rising slightly to the village of [[Kadikoi]] about a mile from Balaclava. The road then turned west, climbing steeply to the plateau via the [[Mountain pass|Col]] of Balaclava. The French were supplied from the harbour at [[Kamiesch]].<ref>Cooke, pp2-5</ref>

During the early part of October, the British troops, together with their supplies and artillery, made their way with difficulty up the road in preparation for the siege. When these were all in place the First Bombardment took place, starting on October 17th. It had been expected that the bombardment would be effective and that the siege would be short-lived, and certainly over before the winter. However, the Russians blew up one of the French [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s and the damage done by British gunfire was soon repaired. The British were running out of ammunition and supplies, winter was approaching and with the onset of bad weather the road became virtually impassable. Supplies were arriving at the crowded port of Balaclava but it was proving impossible to convey them to the besieging troops who were increasingly suffering from disease, [[frostbite]] and [[malnutrition]]. Conditions in Balaclava itself were also deteriorating.<ref>Cooke, pp7-15</ref>

==Towards a railway==
[[Image:Peto.jpg|thumb|Samuel Morton Peto]]
News of these appalling conditions was relayed to Britain, mainly by [[William Howard Russell]], special correspondent of ''[[The Times]]''.<ref>Cooke, pp14-15</ref> Hearing the news, [[Samuel Morton Peto]], one of the leading [[railway]] contractors of the day, offered with his partners [[Edward Betts]] and [[Thomas Brassey]], to build at cost, without any contract or personal advantage, a railway to transport supplies from the port of Balaclava to the troops outside Sevastopol. They promised to have a railroad at work in three weeks after landing at Balaclava. Their offer was accepted and the contractors immediately began to obtain supplies, to purchase or hire ships and to recruit the men, from specialists down to the navvies required to undertake the venture. The main fleet set sail on December 21st<ref>Cooke, pp16-30</ref> and arrived at the beginning of February.<ref>Cooke, p43</ref>

Meanwhile [[James Beatty (engineer)|James Beatty]], who had played an important part in assisting Peto's partnership to build the [[European and North American Railway]], was recruited as chief engineer.<ref>Cooke, pp25-26</ref> The line was surveyed by [[Donald Campbell (engineer)|Donald Campbell]], who had also worked on the European and North American Railway.<ref>Cooke, p28</ref> Campbell's first task was to create a [[wharf]] at Balaclava where the railway materials could be unloaded, with a yard adjacent to it. He planned that the track would pass along the middle of the main street of the town. It then had to pass through a [[Canyon|gorge]] at the north of the town close to the water's edge and over [[swamp]]y ground with rivulets to the village of Kadikoi. From here, the railway had to rise some {{convert|500|ft|m|0}} to the top of the plateau. Of the possible routes available, Campbell chose to follow the existing road. Although at parts its [[gradient]] was as steep as 1 in 7, Campbell managed find a route with a maximum gradient of 1 in 14.  A [[stationary engine]] would be required at the top of this stretch to pull the railway carriages up the incline. Once on the plateau, the ground was rough but fairly level and it presented fewer problems. Lord Raglan's headquarters were at the top of the col, and it was decided that a depot should be constructed in this area.<ref>Cooke, pp38-41</ref>

==Construction==

By February 8th 1855, barely a week after landing, the [[navvy|navvies]] were laying the first rails in the main street of Balaclava. A trial assembly of the stationary engines (two had been acquired in case of the failure of one of them) was made and on February 10th they were working. By the 13th, the railway had reached a point {{convert|300|yd|m|0}} from the town, on the 19th it was at Kadikoi and it began to function by the 23th. On that day, horse-drawn supplies were taken from Balaclava to Kadikoi, 15 days after starting to lay the first rails and about three weeks after the arrival of the fleet in the port. The railway yard in Balaclava was being extended and accommodation was being built for the workers and for storage of materials.<ref>Cooke, pp43-49</ref> By March 26th the line was complete to the top of the col and the first load was taken to the headquarters depot. By this time, the line had been [[double track]]ed from Balaclava to Kadikol and various [[Rail siding|sidings]] had been constructed near the wharf. Seven miles of track had been laid in less than seven weeks.<ref>Cooke, p64</ref>

During this time the pioneer photographer [[Roger Fenton]] had arrived and was able to record the railway and its progress.<ref>Cooke, p58</ref> On April 2nd, the railway was used for a new purpose, to carry the sick and injured from the plateau down to Balaclava &mdash; this was the first hospital train ever to run.<ref>Cooke, p75</ref> Also during this time, Colonel [[William McMurdo]] had been appointed to be in charge of a new department of the army, the [[Land Transport Corps]]. He arrived in the Crimea in early March, and one of his duties was to take over the operation of the railway from the contractors.<ref>Cooke, pp76-82</ref> It was finally handed over by Peto, Brassey and Betts in early July.<ref>Cooke, p96</ref>

==The war continues==
The existence of the railway meant that sufficient supplies and armaments had been transported to the plateau for the allies to resume their attack. The Second Bombardment started on April 9th and continued for ten days. Initially, little progress seemed to have been made because once again the Russians were able to repair the damage caused, and the Russians continued to deliver supplies to Sevastopol from the north. However, the Russians had sustained heavy casualties.<ref>Cooke, pp72-72</ref> Following a period of stalemate, Allied forces cut off one of the main supply lines at [[Kerch]] on May 24th.<ref>Cooke, pp83-84</ref>

The increased supply of ammunition meant that the Allies were able to mount the Third Bombardment on June 6th.  This was much more intensive than the previous ones. It was followed by an assault on the 7th and 8th, which met a limited degree of success.<ref>Cooke, pp86-88</ref> More supplies were brought by the railway and the Fourth Bombardment took place on June 17th.  The subsequent attack was mismanaged and was a failure.<ref>Cooke, pp88-89</ref>

==The end of the siege==
The Russians suffered a significant defeat at the [[Battle of Chernaya River|Battle of the Tchernaya]] on August 16th.<ref>Cooke, p101</ref> The Fifth Bombardment took place for five days from the 17th, with the intention of destroying as many Russian defence works as possible. The Sixth Bombardment was followed by a successful Allied attack on September 8th,<ref>Cooke, pp106-108</ref> bringing the siege to an end two days later.<ref>[http://www.datesofhistory.com/Siege-of-Sevastopol-Great-Britain.event.html World History Database:Siege of Sevastopol], accessed [[24 August]] [[2007]]</ref>

==More lines &mdash; and locomotives==
During the summer, further surveys had been carried out with the prospect of supplying not just the British forces, but also their French and [[Sardinia]]n allies ([[Sardinia]] had joined the war towards the end of 1854)<ref>Cooke, p66</ref> by rail from Balaclava.  It was also at this time that [[electric telegraph]]y by underwater [[cable]] was used in warfare for the first time, connecting the Crimea to the Allies' base at [[Varna]] in [[Bulgaria]].<ref>Cooke, pp103-104</ref>

[[Locomotive]]s were used, the first one running on November 8th, but this was too late to affect the outcome of the siege. The locomotives were not particularly effective because they could not manage even the easy gradient from Balaclava to Kadikoi with more than a light load.<ref>Cooke, p114</ref> In all, probably five locomotives arrived but the identity of any of these has not been positively identified, other than ''Swan'', a [[2-2-2]] locomotive built at [[Crewe Works|Crewe]].<ref>Cooke, p116</ref>

James Beatty left the Crimea in November to return to England, a sick man, and Donald Campbell took over.<ref>Cooke, pp118-119</ref> Earlier in September Her Majesty's Floating Factory ''Chasseur'' arrived at Balaclava to provide an engineering service under the direction of [[Robert Frazer]]. A third stationary engine also arrived during this time.<ref>Cooke, pp119-121</ref> Due to the haste in which the railway had been constructed, it was in danger of being severely damaged by the weather of the coming winter. [[William Doyne]] organised the building of new lines of a superior quality, again in a short time. By November 10th, {{convert|6.5|mi|km|0}} of track had been laid between Balaclava and the British headquarters. The lines towards the Sardinian and French headquarters were also advancing.<ref>Cooke, pp121-125</ref>

Towards and during the second winter, the supplies carried by the railway were different. The siege had ended, carriage of ammunition was less important, and the supplies related more to the accommodation and comfort of the troops.  These included huts to replace tents, clothing, food, books and medical supplies. Colonel McMurdo also left the Crimea as a sick man on December 1st, passing the control of the railway to Colonel [[Edward Wetherall]].<ref>Cooke, pp126-127</ref>  Following the completion of the Sardinian branch, the railway had reached its limit. In all, it measured about {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} plus a few miles of sidings and loops.<ref>Cooke, p135</ref> 

==The end of the war==
Sevastopol lay in ruins after the end of the siege. [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] died on [[2 March]] [[1855]], and peace negotiations were opened by the new [[Tsar]], [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].<ref>Cooke, p66</ref> Hostilities ceased between the Allies and the Russians on [[February 29]] [[1856]] and the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on [[March 30]] [[1856]].<ref>[http://www.datesofhistory.com/Treaty-of-Paris-Great-Britain.event.html World History Database:Treaty of Paris], accessed [[24 August]] [[2007]]</ref> The Russians sold the track to the Turks soon after the war ended; the rails had already been uprooted and taken away, and the railway ceased to exist.<ref>Cooke, p142</ref>
