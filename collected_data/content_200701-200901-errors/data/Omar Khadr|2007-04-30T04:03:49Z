== Life in Canada ==
Omar Khadr, like all six children in the [[Khadr family]], was born in [[Canada]], and both parents were Canadian citizens.  During most of the time the family was living in [[Scarborough, Ontario]], the father [[Ahmed Said Khadr]] was working in Afghanistan.<ref name=GoodSon>[http://www.hvk.org/articles/1202/293.html The Good Son], originally published in the ''[[National Post]]'', [[December 28]], [[2002]]</ref> 

In 1992 Ahmed Said Khadr was wounded by a land-mine, and spent a year back in Canada recovering his health.

== Life in bin Laden's compound ==
Khadr's father moved his family to Afghanistan at this time, where they lived in [[Osama bin Laden]]'s compound, and played with bin Laden's children.<ref name=SonofAlQaeda>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/khadr/ Son of al Qaeda], ''[[Frontline (PBS)]]''</ref>  Khadr's father has been described as one of bin Laden's senior lieutenants.

Omar's older brother [[Abdurahman Khadr]] described being sent to military training camps shortly after his arrival, when he was just eleven years old.  All of the Khadr boys are believed to have military training while they were  children.

== Capture ==
On July 27, 2002, 14- or 15-year-old Khadr was in a compound near [[Khost]] that was surrounded by US special forces.  According to the US version of events, the Americans called on those in the compound to surrender.  When they refused, a firefight ensued.  Sergeant [[Layne Morris]] was injured early in the skirmish.  The Americans called in a bombardment.

Most press accounts of the skirmish say that Khadr killed a "[[medic]]", implying that he had attacked a noncombatant after giving his surrender, but although Sgt. [[Christopher J. Speer|Christopher Speer]] had been trained as a medic, he was actually leading the squad combing the compound after they believed all occupants had been killed.  

Khadr leapt from hiding and threw a grenade, which injured Sgt. Speer and led to his death, and injured three other members of the squad.<ref name=GoodSon>[http://www.hvk.org/articles/1202/293.html The Good Son], originally published in the ''[[National Post]]'', [[December 28]], [[2002]]</ref> 
Omar was shot three times, and left nearly blind in one eye.  He was subsequently treated and his life was saved by U.S. medics.

== Accusations against Khadr ==
A video-tape was reportedly found in the ruins showing Khadr planting mines.  The Americans say that while being interrogated at [[Bagram Air Base]], Khadr confessed to entering a US occupied section of Afghanistan, to gather surveillance intelligence on the local airport.

== Incarceration at Guantánamo Bay ==
There were other detainees incarcerated at Guantánamo Bay who were still just children.  Three of them were kept in a smaller compound, [[Camp Iguana]], where they were allegedly treated humanely.  They were not required to wear the orange coveralls.  They were provided with school teachers, and recreation.  The BBC interviewed one 13-year-old child detainee upon his return to Afghanistan.  He had learned to read at Camp Iguana.  The two years he spent there were the only education he had ever had, and he reported being sorry to leave.  

[[Elaine Chao]] the US [[Secretary of Labor]] has spoken about the responsibility to give child soldiers special treatment, to provide help for them to re-integrate into society.<ref name=ChildSoldiers>[[Elaine L. Chao]], [http://www.dol.gov/_sec/media/speeches/20030507_ILAB_ChildSoldiers.htm Children in the Crossfire: Prevention and Rehabilitation of Child Soldiers], ''[[US Department of Labor]]'', [[May 7]] [[2003]]</ref>  She announced a $3 million program to help re-integrate child-soldiers in Afghanistan back into Afghan society.

However, Khadr was treated as an adult.  Khadr has been reported to have been kept in solitary confinement, for long periods of time [http://news.amnesty.org/pages/torture-case8-eng]; to have been denied adequate medical treatment; to have been subjected to ''"[[short shackling]]"'' [http://news.amnesty.org/pages/torture-case8-eng], and left bound, in uncomfortable ''"[[stress position]]s"'' until he soiled himself [http://news.amnesty.org/pages/torture-case8-eng]. In a press conference on January 16, 2005, Khadr's lawyers described how Khadr's captors took Khadr's still bound body and wiped his hair and clothes in his urine and feces. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

[[Bryan Del Monte]], the [[Department of Defense]] deputy director for political development and international issues in the Office of Detainee Affairs, gave a [[press conference]]. following his return from testifying before the [[United Nations Committee against torture]]. <ref name=AsharqAlawsat060513> [http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=3&id=4927 US DoD Official Discusses Guantanamo], ''[[Asharq Alawsat]]'', [[May 13]] [[2006]]</ref>
During this press conference he asserted that Khadr, and two other youths, were incarcerated separately from adults, and were provided with daily lessons:
:''"Del Monte said that those in charge of the Guantanamo detention camp provide the three youngsters with lessons every morning in Mathematics, English, Sciences, and other subjects for their mental and psychological needs in addition to teaching physical fitness and sports." 

Del Monte's assertion stands in contrast to the other accounts of Khadr's incarceration, where he has been described as leading the prayer sessions of the other detainees in his cell block.

=== Khadr's Combatant Status Review ===
Khadr's case was reviewed by the [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] on September 8, 2004.  The review released a one page summary of their conclusions on September 17, 2004.  Khadr's lawyers had written him a letter, recommending that he refrain from cooperating with the tribunal, or any questioning conducted without adequate legal representation.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The tribunal concluded that Khadr was an "illegal combatant".

At the time of his hearing Khadr had not been allowed to meet with any lawyer.

=== Access to lawyers ===
A June 15, 2005 article in [[Newsday]] cited [[Muneer Ahmad]]'s experience as an example of the difficulties the Pentagon presented to detainees' lawyers.<ref name=Newsday050615>[http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/ny-woguan0615,0,2202228,print.story?coll=ny-world-big-pix At Gitmo, still no day in court: How feds avoid hearings for terror suspects — despite Supreme Court ruling], ''[[Newsday]]'', [[June 15]], [[2005]]</ref>
Ahmad also reported that Khadr had described extensive abusive treatment to him, but that when he arrived at the Virginia security centre, all twenty pages of his notes had been [[redacted]].  

Mr Ahmad's first meeting with Khadr was not until November 2004.  Khadr has still not been permitted to speak with the Canadian lawyers who were his family's first choice.

=== Hunger Strikes ===
On September 1, 2005, the [[Globe and Mail]] reported that [[Dennis Edney]], one of Khadr's Canadian lawyers reported that Khadr was participating in a second [[hunger strike]].<ref name=GlobeandMail050901>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v4/sub/MarketingPage?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20050901%2FKHADR01%2FTPInternational%2FTopStories&ord=15050617&brand=theglobeandmail&redirect_reason=2&denial_reasons=none&force_login=false Canadian teen in Guantanamo on hunger strike, lawyers say], ''[[Globe and Mail]]'' [[September 1]] [[2005]]</ref>  Khadr participated in the 200-member hunger strike that occurred in late June and July.  The Globe article reports that lawyers said Khadr's first hunger strike lasted 15 days, and that prison authorities administered intravenous fluid.  Allegedly Khadr reported collapsing as he left the Hospital, and alledgedly his guards administered a brutal beating [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050901/KHADR01/TPInternational/TopStories].

On September 11, 2005, [[The Independent]] published an extract from Guantánamo detainee [[Omar Deghayes]].  On July 20, 2005, he wrote about Khadr:<ref name=Independent050911>[http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article311813.ece  Revealed: the diary of a British man on hunger strike in Guantanamo], ''[[The Independent]]'', [[September 11]] [[2005]]</ref>

:''Omar Khadr [the Canadian juvenile] is very sick in our block. He is throwing [up] blood. They gave him cyrum [serum] when they found him on the floor in his cell. Galib Fiyhani also.''

== Khadr Military Commission ==

On [[November 7]], [[2005]], Khadr was charged, and will face a "[[Guantanamo military commission|Military Commission]]".

===Charged  With Murder===

Khadr was charged with [[murder]] for his actions against the squad inside the compound near [[Khost|Khost, Afghanistan]].
The charges against Mr. Khadr allege that his father, the late [[Ahmed Said Khadr]], a Canadian Islamic extremist, was a close friend of [[Osama bin Laden]] and his Egyptian deputy [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], and that Omar Khadr also was acquainted with Mr. bin Laden, the [[Al Qaeda]] leader.<ref name=NYTimes051108>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60F16FF3E5A0C7B8CDDA80994DD404482 Pentagon Charges 5 More In Guantánamo Bay Camp], ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[November 8]] [[2005]]</ref>

On [[November 9]], [[2005]], the [[Globe and Mail]] reported that the United States had informally indicated they would not seek the [[death penalty]] in Omar's trial. <ref name=globeandmail051109>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20051109/KHADR09/TPInternational/Americas U.S. won't seek execution of Khadr], ''[[Globe and Mail]]'', [[November 9]], [[2005]]</ref>
On [[December 1]], [[2005]] the officers were appointed to the [[Guantanamo military commission]] that would judge Khadr.<ref name=torstar051202> [http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1133477416020&call_pageid=968332188854&col=968350060724 Khadr faces military trial], ''[[Toronto Star]]'', [[December 2]], [[2005]]</ref>

====Charge 1:Conspiracy====

Omar Ahmed Khadr did, in and around Afghanistan, from on or about June 2002 to on or about 27 July 2002, willfully and knowingly join an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose and conspired and agreed with Usama bin Laden, [[Ayman al Zawahiri]], [[Sheikh]] [[Sayeed al Masri]], [[Muhammad Atef]] (a/k/a [[Abu Hafs al Masri]]), [[Saif al adel]], [[Ahmad Sa'id Khadr]] (a/k/a Abu Al-Rahman Al-Kanadi), and various other members of the al Qaida organization, known and unknown, to commit the following offenses triable by military commission: attacking civilians; attacking civilian objects; murder by an unprivileged belligerent; destruction of property by an unprivileged belligerent; destruction of property by an unprivileged belligerent; and terrorism.

In furtherance of this enterprise  and conspiracy, Khadr and other members of al Qaida committed the following overt acts:
:*On or about June 2002, Khadr received approximately one month of one-on-one, private al Qaida basic training from an al Qaida member named "Abu Haddi."

:*On or about June 2002, Khadr conducted surveillance and reconnaissance against the U.S. military.  Khadr went to an airport near Khost, Afghanistan, and watched U.S. convoys in support of future attacks against the U.S. military.

:*On or about July 2002, Khadr received one month of land mine training.

:*On or about July 2002, Khadr joined a group of Al Qaida operatives and converted land mines to improvised explosive devices in the ground {{sic}} where, based on previous surveillance, U.S. troops were expected to be traveling.

:*On or about July 27, 200, Khadr and other Al Qaida members engaged U.S military personnel when military members surrounded their compound. During the firefight, Khadr threw a grenade, killing Sergeant First Class [[Christopher Speer]].

Omar Ahmed Khadr did, in Afghanistan, on divers occasions between on or about June 1, 2002 and July 27, 2002, while in the context of associated with armed conflict, intentionally aid the enemy, to wit: al Qaida.

===Prosecutor's Accusations===

[[Colonel]] [[Morris Davis]], Khadr's chief Prosecutor, spoke out against Khadr, to the press.<ref name=Cbc060110>[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/world/060110/w011074.html U.S. prosecutor in Khadr case blasts sympathetic views of Canadian teen], ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'', [[January 10]] [[2006]]</ref>

===Preliminary hearing===

On [[March 30]] [[2006]], Khadr, and the other nine detainees who face charges, were transferred to [[solitary confinement]].<ref name=TorStar060406>[http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1144273817399&call_pageid=968332188854&col=968350060724 Khadr vows boycott as shouts rock U.S. court: Toronto teen moved to solitary confinement Accused terrorist demands `humane and fair' treatment], ''[[Toronto Star]]'', [[April 6]] [[2006]]</ref>

[[Commander]] [[Robert Durand]] said, ''"Consistent with Army regulations, individuals in a pretrial status are separated from the general population. These measures are largely for the protection of the detainee,"[Consistent with Army regulations, individuals in a pretrial status are separated from the general population. These measures are largely for the protection of the detainee]

On [[April 5]] [[2006]] Khadr read out a note that said: ''"Excuse me Mr. Judge,.. I'm being punished for exercising my right and being co-operative in participating in this military commission. For that, I say with my respect to you and everybody else here, that I'm boycotting these procedures until I be treated humanely and fair."<ref name=TorStar060406>[http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1144273817399&call_pageid=968332188854&col=968350060724 Khadr vows boycott as shouts rock U.S. court: Toronto teen moved to solitary confinement Accused terrorist demands `humane and fair' treatment], ''[[Toronto Star]]'', [[April 6]] [[2006]]</ref>

On April 7, 2006, Khadr's lawyers reversed course stating on the record in front of the commission that after consulting with U.S. military officials that Khadr's current conditions of confinement were indeed humane and not done in order to "punish" Khadr for being cooperative in participating in commission proceedings.  [http://www.macon.com/mld/macon/news/world/14292930.htm]

===New charges===

On April 24, 2007, new charges were laid by the U.S. defence department against Omar Khadr. [http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/us_cda_khadr]  Khadr is accused of murdering an American medic in Afghanistan in 2002, attempted murder, conspiracy, spying and providing material support for terrorism.  A schedule for the trial will be drawn up in a matter of months.  Thus far, the Canadian government has not stepped in to request that Khadr serve whatever sentence he receives in a Canadian prison, as the Australian government did in the case of David Hicks.  

===Independent medical examination===

Khadr lawyers have been trying, with no success so far, to arrange for Khadr to get an independent medical examination.<ref name=MiamiHerald060626> [http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/14902061.htm Teen's defense looks to doctor for help], ''[[Miami Herald]]'', [[June 26]] [[2006]]</ref><ref name=MedRequest> [http://www.miami.com/multimedia/miami/news/gitmo-khadr.pdf Second Request for Appointment of Expert Consultant: Dr. Xenakis and Dr. Cantor (.pdf)], '[[Miami Herald]]'', [[June 13]] [[2006]]</ref>
They assert that a psychological evaluation is routine for any suspect charged with a murder committed when they were a minor.  They state that an independent examination is essential for them to be able to effectively craft their defense.  Further they assert that the suicides on [[June 10]] [[2006]] put Khadr at greater risk.

Khadr's lawyers had administered a psychological questionnaire to Khadr during one of their earlier visits.<ref name=MedRequest> [http://www.miami.com/multimedia/miami/news/gitmo-khadr.pdf Second Request for Appointment of Expert Consultant: Dr. Xenakis and Dr. Cantor (.pdf)], '[[Miami Herald]]'', [[June 13]] [[2006]]</ref>  An analysis of Khadr's answers indicated that he was at moderate to high risk of committing suicide.

See "The Unending Torture of Omar Khadr", Rolling Stone, August 24, 2006, by Jeff Tietz.

== The Speer/Morris lawsuit ==

[[Tabitha Speer]], Sergeant Speer's widow, and Sergeant [[Layne Morris]], launched a civil suit against the estate of [[Ahmed Said Khadr]], Omar Khadr's father.  They argue that as Khadr was a child, his parents were responsible for his actions, and that since his parents should have kept him from picking up a gun on the battlefield, they were responsible for any wounds he inflicted.  Normally, under US law, one can't sue for damages that were caused by "acts of war".  Speer and Morris argue that Khadr was engaged in an act of terrorism, not an act of war.

They have described the law-suit as "an attempt to attack terrorism in its bank account".

==Gag order on his military Counsel==

[[Sergeant]] [[Heather Cerveny]], the [[paralegal]] for [[Colby Vokey]], Khadr's military lawyer, issued an affidavit reporting that off-duty Guantanamo guards had bragged to her of abusing detainees.  On [[October 14]] [[2006]] Vokey's boss imposed a gag order on the two while the matter is investigated.<ref name=Wapo061014>
