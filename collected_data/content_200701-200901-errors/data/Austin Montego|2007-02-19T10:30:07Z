The '''Austin Montego''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] mid-size [[sedan|saloon]] [[car]] that was produced by the [[Austin Rover Group|Austin Rover]] subsidiary of [[British Leyland]] (BL), and its successors, from 1984 until 1994. The car was the replacement for the much maligned [[Morris Ital]], to give British Leyland a modern competitor for the [[Ford Sierra]] and [[Vauxhall Cavalier]].

==Design and development==

The ''Montego'' started life as a four-door [[notchback]] variant of project LC10. The [[Austin Maestro]] emerged as the five-door [[hatchback]] variant.  When the designs diverged the ''Montego'' became project LM11 (the ''Maestro'' being LM10), and remained based on a lengthened version of the LC10 floorpan.  The Montego received very different front and rear styling following the replacement of designer [[David Bache]] with [[Roy Axe]].  It also featured body-coloured bumpers (as did the ''Maestro''), and front wipers which hid themselves under the bonnet when parked<ref>{{cite web

The Montego offered many improvements over the Maestro, many of which were later incorporated into the Maestro, such as a new [[SOHC]] [[engine]] (the [[BL S-Series engine|S-Series]]), and a more robust dashboard.  As with the ''Maestro'', there was a high-performance [[MG (car)|MG]] version which again used the solid-state instrument cluster, [[trip computer]], and the synthesised voice of [[Nicolette MacKenzie]] for the information and warning system.  The dashboard fitted to the Montego was superior to that originally designed for the Maestro and featured a rally-style tachometer, a service indicator and a representation of the car showing open doors, lights left on, etc.

==To market==
The ''Montego'' was launched in April 1984.  The estate variant was launched at the 1984 [[British International Motor Show]] in October.  The 150 bhp MG turbocharged variant took the market by storm in early 1985 as the fastest production MG ever with a 0-60 mph time of 7.3 seconds, and a top speed of 126 mph<ref name="mmoc"/>. 

Like its Maestro brother, the Montego suffered from its overly long development phase, which had been ongoing since 1975 amidst the industrial turmoil that had plagued both British Leyland and Austin Rover Group.  In many ways, the technology was years ahead of its time, particularly the solid-state instrumentation, however due to reliability issues and the fact the talking dashboard was regarded as something of an embarrassment by BL and the British press, that was discontinued after a short period. It is unknown how many, if any, MG Montego EFi models featuring the LED dashboard remain.

==Later developments==
However, despite all this, the Montego matured into a decent car.  A minor facelift for 1989 enhanced its appeal, which was buoyed up by both the [[Perkins Engines|Perkins]]-engined [[diesel]] version, and the seven-seater version of the "Countryman"  estate.  

The facelift also saw the phasing out of the Austin name. These late-1980s models had a badge resembling the Rover Viking longship, but it was not identical, nor did the word "Rover" ever appear on the cars.

By the early 1990s, the car was terminally aged, and production effectively ceased when the replacement car, the [[Rover 600]], was launched in 1993.  

Montegos continued to be built in small numbers in [[CKD]] form at the Cowley plant until 1994, when production finally ended. The last car was signed by all those that worked on it, and is now on display at the British [[Heritage Motor Centre]] in [[Gaydon]], Warwickshire, UK. 546,000 Austin Montegos and 23,000 MG Montegos were produced.

436,000 Montegos were sold in the UK between 1984 and 1995. In August 2006, a survey by Auto Express revealed that the Montego was Britain's eighth most scrapped car, with just 8,988 still in working order.  A lot of this is down to the fact that pre-1989 models cannot run on unleaded [[gasoline|petrol]] without the [[cylinder head]] being converted at great cost to the owner, thus discouraging the maintenance and restoration of 1980s examples.

==International Markets==

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], the Austin Montego was launched in 1984 in manual 2.0-litre form wagon (estate car) form only by then importer [[New Zealand Motor Corporation]] to supplement the locally-produced [[Honda Accord]] hatchback and sedan models.

The only models offered were 2.0 HLS and 2.0 Mayfair [[station wagon|estate car]] versions: a sedan was not offered in New Zealand due to concerns that it would compete directly with the [[Honda Accord]]. 

These early carburettor Montegos developed a reputation for catching fire as a fuel hose would dislodge and spray petrol over the hot exhaust manifold &mdash; a trait the Austin shared with some older [[Ford Cortina]] models.

Later &ndash; from about 1989 &ndash; a wider range of models were imported by a new company, [[Rover New Zealand]]; this included sedan versions for the first time. Also new were the MG 2.0 range (identical to the [[MG]] Montego sold in the [[United Kingdom]]), and all wore the official [[MG (car)|MG]] badge. This was the first MG estate car. The main Auckland dealer developed an air conditioning system as an option for these cars in conjunction with local specialists. However, the estate version was never sold in the UK with the MG badging on it.

===India===
The Montego was sold in [[India]] as the Rover Montego in collaboration with [[Cars_in_India#Sipani|Sipani Motors]]. The car flopped badly and sold in limited numbers before being discontinued.

===China===
A version of the [[Austin Maestro]] with a Montego front end is built in [[China]] under the [[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile|Etsong]] Lande nameplate.
