'''Desmond Mpilo Tutu''' (born [[7 October]] [[1931]]) is a [[South Africa]]n [[cleric]] and activist who rose to [[worldwide]] fame during the [[1980s]] as an opponent of [[History of South Africa in the Apartheid Era|apartheid]].  Tutu was elected and ordained the first black South African [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Cape Town]], South Africa, and [[Primate (religion)|primate]] of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa (now the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]]). He received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in [[1984]], the [[Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism]], and the Magubela prize for liberty in 1986.  He is committed to stopping global [[AIDS]] and has served as the honorary chairman for the [[Global AIDS Alliance]]. In [[February]] [[2007]] he was awarded [[Gandhi Peace Prize]] by [[Abdul Kalam|Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam]], president of [[India]].

He was generally credited with coining the term [[Rainbow Nation]] as a metaphor for post-apartheid [[South Africa]] after 1994 under [[African National Congress]] rule.  The expression has since entered mainstream consciousness to describe South Africa's ethnic diversity.

==Background==
Desmond Mpilo Tutu was born in [[Klerksdorp]], [[Transvaal]] on 7 October, 1931. Tutu's  family moved to [[Johannesburg]] when he was 12 years old. Although he wanted to become a [[physician]], his family could not afford the training, and he followed his father's footsteps into [[teaching]]. Tutu studied at the [[Pretoria Bantu Normal College]] from 1951 through 1953, and went on to teach at [[Johannesburg Bantu High School]], where he remained until 1957.  He resigned following the passage of the [[Bantu Education Act]], in protest of the poor educational prospects for African South Africans. He continued his studies, this time in [[theology]], and in 1960 was ordained as an [[Anglican]] [[minister]]. He became [[chaplain]] at the [[University of Fort Hare]], a hotbed of dissent and one of the few quality universities for African students in the southern part of Africa.

Tutu left his post as chaplain and travelled to [[King's College London]], (1962–1966), where he received his [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree]]s in Theology. He returned to Southern Africa and from 1967 until 1972 used his lectures to highlight the circumstances of the African population. He wrote a letter to [[B.J. Vorster|Prime Minister Vorster]], in which he described the situation in South Africa as a "[[gunpowder|powder barrel]] that can explode at any time."  The letter was never answered. From 1970 to 1972, Tutu lectured at the [[National University of Lesotho]] .

In 1972 Tutu returned to the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where he was appointed vice-director of the Theological Education Fund of the [[World Council of Churches]], at [[Bromley]] in [[Kent]]. He returned to South Africa in 1975 and was appointed Anglican [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Johannesburg]]—the first African person to hold that position.

In 1984 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace, as a gesture of support for him and The South African Council of Churches which he led at that time.

In [[1987]] Tutu was awarded the [[Pacem in Terris Award]]. It was named after a [[1963]] [[encyclical]] letter by [[Pope]] [[John XXIII]] that calls upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations. [[Pacem in Terris]] is [[Latin]] for 'Peace on Earth.'

In 2000, Tutu received an honorary doctor of laws degree from the [[University of Alberta]]. He was also the inaugural speaker at the first annual University of Alberta Visiting Lectureship in Human Rights in November of 1998.

In [[2000]] Tutu spoke at [[Hamilton College]] and received a L.H.D. from [[Bates College]]. In 2005, Tutu received an [[honorary degree]] from the [[University of North Florida]], one of the many universities in North America and Europe where he has taught. He visited a school at that time, Twin Lakes Academy Elementary School, and spoke to a class of 3rd graders about his work.

In 2005, Tutu was named a [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] at [[Fordham University]] in [[The Bronx]]. He was also awarded Honorary Patronage of the [[University Philosophical Society]] by [[John Hume]], another Honorary Patron of the Society and fellow [[Nobel laureate]]. He was also awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] by [[Berea College]] prior to delivering the commencement address. 

In 2006, Tutu was named a Doctor of Public Service at the [[College of William and Mary]] in Virginia, where he was also the commencement speaker.  He was awarded the [[Light of Truth award]] along with Belgian artist [[Hergé]] (posthumously for [[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]) by the [[Dalai Lama]] for his contribution towards public understanding of [[Tibet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3255584|title=Dalai Lama to honour Tutu, Tintin|date=[[2006-05-22]]|publisher=[[The Star (South Africa)]]|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref>

In [[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]] [[List of Top Gear episodes#Series_10|Series 10, Episode 4]], "Botswana Top Gear special", the show presenters encountered a travel across the Botswana in unprepared used cars. In the closing credits, the words "Archbishop Desmond" were added before the surname of each person in the crew, including presenters: "Archbishop Desmond Clarkson, Archbishop Desmond Hammond, Archbishop Desmond May and Archbishop Desmond Stig...", in homage to Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

==Personal life==  

He has been married to [[Leah Nomalizo Tutu]] since 1955. They have four children:  Trevor Thamsanqa Tutu, Theresa Thandeka Tutu, Naomi Nontombi Tutu and Mpho Andrea Tutu, all of whom attended the [[Waterford Kamhlaba]] School in [[Swaziland]].

In 1996, Tutu was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]].[http://www.bbc.co.uk]

==Political work==
In [[1976]] protests in [[Soweto]], also known as the [[Soweto Riots]], against the government's use of [[Afrikaans]] as a compulsory medium of instruction in black schools became a massive uprising against apartheid.  From then on Tutu supported an economic [[boycott]] of his country.  

Desmond Tutu was [[Bishop]] of [[Lesotho]] from 1976 until 1978, when he became [[Secretary-General]] of the [[South African Council of Churches]]. From this position, he was able to continue his work against apartheid with agreement from nearly all churches. Tutu consistently advocated [[reconciliation]] between all parties involved in apartheid through his writings and lectures at home and abroad. Though he was most firm in denouncing South Africa's white-ruled government, Tutu was also harsh in his criticism of the violent tactics of some anti-apartheid groups such as the [[African National Congress]] and denounced [[terrorism]] and [[Communism]].

On [[16 October]] [[1984]], Tutu was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].  The Nobel Committee cited his "role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa."<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1984/press.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize for 1984|publisher=[[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref> 

Tutu became the first black person to lead the Anglican Church in [[South Africa]] on [[7 September]] [[1986]]. In 1989 he was invited to [[Birmingham, England|Birmingham]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]] as part of Citywide Christian Celebrations.  Tutu and his wife visited a number of establishments including the [[Nelson Mandela]] School in [[Sparkbrook]].

After the fall of apartheid, he headed the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], for which he was awarded the [[Sydney Peace Prize]] in 1999.

In 2003, he was elected to the Board of Directors of the [[International Criminal Court]]'s Trust Fund for Victims.<ref>[[Amnesty International]], [[12 September]] [[2003]], ''[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGIOR300072003?open&of=ENG-391 Amnesty 







International welcomes the election of a Board of Directors]''. Retrieved on [[1 August]] [[2007]].</ref>

In 2004, Tutu returned to the UK as Visiting Professor in Post-Conflict Societies at [[King's College London|King's College]] and gave the Commemoration Oration as part of the College's 175th anniversary. He also visited the student union nightclub named "Tutu's" in his honour, and featuring a rare bust of his likeness.

On [[17 March]] [[2004]] Tutu visited [[Marymount University]] in [[Arlington_County,_Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]] to accept Marymount University's 2004 Ethics Award.

[[Image:Dalai Lama & Bishop Tutu. Carey Linde.jpg|thumb|300px|H.H. the [[Dalai Lama]] and Bishop Tutu, 2004]]

On [[30 November]], [[2006]], Tutu was appointed as the lead to a High-Level Fact-Finding Mission mandated by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] into the [[Israel]]i military operations which led to [[Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident|civilian deaths]] in [[Beit Hanoun]].

On September 5, 2007, [[Archbishop]] Desmond Tutu celebrated his [[appointment]] as [[patron]] of [[South Africa]]'s Barbecue (Braai) Day or [[Heritage Day (South Africa)]] affirming it to be a unifying force in a divided country (by donning an [[apron]] and tucking into a [[sausage]]). Organiser Jan Scannell announced that the aim is not to have a mass braai, but small ones with friends and family.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6981326.stm  BBC NEWS, Tutu praises 'unifying' barbecues]</ref>

On 26 June 2007, Tutu opened the Desmond Tutu Centre for War and Peace Studies at [[Liverpool Hope University]]. [[Archbishop]] Tutu also delivered a lecture at [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral]] to mark this occasion.

On September 21, 2007 Archbishop Tutu was awarded by the Mahatma Gandhi Center at [[James Madison University|JMU]], received a diploma from the school.

== Politics and political views ==
=== On homosexuality ===

In the debate about [[Anglican views of homosexuality]] he has opposed Christian discrimination against homosexuals.  Commenting days after the [[5 August]] [[2003]] election of [[Gene Robinson]], an openly [[gay]] man to be a bishop in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], Desmond Tutu said, "In our Church here in South Africa, that doesn't make a difference. We just say that at the moment, we believe that they should remain [[celibate]] and we don't see what the fuss is about."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gay.com/headlines/4846|title=Desmond Tutu: gay bishop row is just "fuss"|publisher=Gay.com UK|date=[[2006-08-11]]|accessdate=2006-05-26}}"</ref>



<blockquote>
Declared Tutu: "I am deeply saddened at a time when we've got such huge problems ... that we should invest so much time and energy in this issue...I think God is weeping."
<br />
...
<br />
"Jesus did not say, 'If I be lifted up I will draw ''some'''."  Jesus said, 'If I be lifted up I will draw all, all, all, all, ''all''. Black, white, yellow, rich, poor, clever, not so clever, beautiful, not so beautiful. It's one of the most radical things. All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all. All belong. Gay, lesbian, so-called straight. All, ''all'' are meant to be held in this incredible embrace that will not let us go. '''''All'''''."
<br /><br />
"Isn't it sad, that in a time when we face so many devastating problems – poverty, HIV/AIDS, war and conflict – that in our Communion we should be investing so much time and energy on disagreement about sexual orientation?"
[The Communion, which] "used to be known for embodying the attribute of comprehensiveness, of inclusiveness, where we were meant to accommodate all and diverse views, saying we may differ in our theology but we belong together as sisters and brothers" now seems "hell-bent on excommunicating one another. God must look on and God must weep."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idCategory=33&idsub=128&id=2141|title=Tutu calls on Anglicans to accept gay bishop|publisher=[[Spero News]]|date=[[2005-11-14]]|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Since then Dr. Tutu has increased his criticism of conservative attitudes to homosexuality within his own church, equating [[homophobia]] with [[racism]]. Stating at a conference in Nairobi that he is "deeply disturbed that in the face of some of the most horrendous problems facing Africa, we concentrate on 'what do I do in bed with whom'".  [http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-3528.html]

In an interview with BBC Radio 4 on the 18th of November 2007, Archbishop Desmond Tutu accused the church of being obsessed with homosexuality and declared: 

"If God, as they say, is homophobic, I wouldn't worship that God."[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7100295.stm]

=== United Nations ===

The Nobel laureate has expressed support for the [[West Papua]]n independence movement, criticizing the [[United Nations]]' role in the takeover of West Papua by [[Indonesia]].  Tutu said:  "For many years the people of South Africa suffered under the yoke of oppression and apartheid. Many people continue to suffer brutal oppression, where their fundamental dignity as human beings is denied. One such people is the people of West Papua."


=== On Mugabe ===
Tutu has criticised human rights abuses in [[Zimbabwe]], calling Zimbabwean [[President of Zimbabwe|president]] [[Robert Mugabe]] a "caricature of an African dictator", and criticising the [[South Africa]]n government's policy of quiet diplomacy towards Zimbabwe.

He warned of corruption shortly after the election of the [[African National Congress]] government of South Africa, saying that they "stopped the gravy train just long enough to get on themselves."<ref>WGBH, date unknown. [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mandela/interviews/tutu.html Interview with Tutu] by John Carlin, for PBS Frontline.  Retrieved on [[7 September]] [[2006]].</ref>

=== On slavery === 

In June 1999, Tutu was invited to give the annual [[Wilberforce Lecture]] in [[Kingston upon Hull]], commemorating the life and achievements of the anti-slavery campaigner [[William Wilberforce]]. Tutu used the occasion to praise the people of the city for their traditional support of freedom and for standing with the people of South Africa in their fight against apartheid. He was also presented with the [[freedom of the city]].

[[Image:Cover Volume I Issue 2.jpg|thumb|The Fall 2004 issue of ''Greater Good'' magazine]]

=== Social psychology ===
Tutu has contributed to the field of [[social psychology]]. His writing appeared in Greater Good Magazine, published by the [[Greater Good Science Center]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  His contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships. His most recent article with Greater Good magazine is titled: "Why to Forgive", which examines how forgiveness is not only personally rewarding, but also politically necessary in allowing South Africa to have a new beginning. However, Tutu states that forgiveness is not turning a blind eye to wrongs; true reconciliation exposes the awfulness, the abuse, the pain, the hurt, the truth. It could even sometimes make things worse. It is a risky undertaking but in the end it is worthwhile, because in the end only an honest confrontation with reality can bring healing.

=== On Israel and relationship with the Jewish community ===

Tutu has spoken of the significant role [[Jew]]s played in the anti-Apartheid struggle in South Africa, has voiced support for [[Israel]]'s security concerns, and has spoken against tactics of [[suicide attack|suicide bombing]] and incitement to hatred.<ref name="tutu">Desmond Tutu, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/comment/0,10551,706911,00.html Apartheid in the Holy Land], ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[April 29]], [[2002]]. <small>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4403427,00.html Alternative link]</small> Accessed online 28 November 2006.</ref> 
He is also an active and prominent proponent of the campaign for [[Economic and political boycotts of Israel|divestment from Israel]], <ref name=tutuNation>Desmond Tutu and Ian Urbina, [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020715/tutu Against Israeli apartheid], ''The Nation'' 275:4-5, June 27, 2002 (July 15, 2002 issue). Accessed online 28 November 2006.</ref> 
and has likened Israel's treatment of [[Palestinian]]s to the treatment of Black South Africans under [[apartheid]].<ref name="tutu"/>  <ref>Tutu used the analogy on a Christmas visit to Jerusalem on [[25 December]] [[1989]], when he said in a ''[[Haaretz]]'' article that he is a "black South African, and if I were to change the names, a description of what is happening in Gaza and the West Bank could describe events in South Africa." (See Walter Ruby, "Tutu says Israel's policy in terrorities remind him of SA", ''Jerusalem Post'', [[1 February]] [[1989]], O1.)  He made similar comments in 2002, speaking of "the humiliation of the [[Palestinians]] at checkpoints and roadblocks, suffering like us when young white police officers prevented us from moving about".(See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1957644.stm Tutu condemns Israeli 'apartheid'], BBC News, [[29 April]] [[2002]]. Accessed online 28 November 2006.)  He has drawn attention to a letter signed by several hundred prominent Jewish South Africans drawing an explicit analogy between apartheid and current Israeli policies.</ref>

In 1988, the [[American Jewish Committee]] noted that Tutu was strongly critical of Israel's military and other connections with apartheid-era South Africa, and quoted him as saying that [[Zionism]] has "very many parallels with racism", on the grounds that it "excludes people on ethnic or other grounds over which they have no control".  While the AJC was critical of some of Tutu's views, it was dismissive of "insidious rumours" that he had made anti-Semitic statements.<ref>[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1988_3_SpecialArticles.pdf American Jewish Year Book, 1988], [[American Jewish Committee]], p. 50 (pdf document).  The precise wording of Tutu's statement has been reported differently in different sources.  A subsequent ''[[Toronto Star]]'' article indicates that he described Zionism "as a policy that looks like it has many parallels with racism, the effect is the same." See Gordon Barthos, "Israelis uneasy about Tutu's Yule visit", ''Toronto Star'', 20 December 1989, A2.</ref>  

Tutu preached a message of forgiveness during a 1989 trip to Israel's [[Yad Vashem]] museum, saying "Our Lord would say that in the end the positive thing that can come is the spirit of forgiving, not forgetting, but the spirit of saying: God, this happened to us.  We pray for those who made it happen, help us to forgive them and help us so that we in our turn will not make others suffer."<ref>"Tutu Urges Jews to Forgive The Nazis", ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 27 December 1989, A20.</ref>  Some found this statement offensive, with Rabbi Marvin Hier of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] calling it “a gratuitous insult to Jews and victims of Nazism everywhere.” <ref>"Tutu assailed", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 30 December 1989, 13.</ref>  Tutu was subjected to racial slurs during this visit to Israel, with vandals writing "Black Nazi pig" on the walls of the St. George's Cathedral in East Jerusalem, where he was staying.<ref>"Tutu Urges Jews to Forgive The Nazis", ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 27 December 1989, A20.</ref>

In 2002, when delivering a public lecture in support of divestment, Tutu said "My heart aches. I say why are our memories so short. Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation? Have they forgotten the collective punishment, the home demolitions, in their own history so soon? Have they turned their backs on their profound and noble religious traditions? Have they forgotten that God cares deeply about the downtrodden?"<ref name="tutu"/>  He argued that Israel could never live in security by oppressing another people, and continued, "People are scared in this country [the US], to say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful - very powerful. Well, so what? For goodness sake, this is God's world! We live in a moral universe. The apartheid government was very powerful, but today it no longer exists. Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Pinochet, Milosevic, and Idi Amin were all powerful, but in the end they bit the dust."<ref name="tutu"/>  The latter statement was criticized by some Jewish groups, including the [[Anti-Defamation League]].<ref>[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/UnitedNations_94/4933_94.htm "ADL Blasts Appointment Of Desmond Tutu As Head Of U.N. Fact Finding Mission To Gaza"], Anti-Defamation League Press Release, 2006, accessed 4 October 2007.</ref><ref>Melanie Phillips, "Bigotry and a corruption of the truth", ''Daily Mail'', 6 May 2002.</ref>  When he edited and reprinted parts of his speech in 2005, Tutu replaced the phrase "Jewish lobby" with "pro-Israel lobby".<ref>Desmond Tutu, forward to Michael Prior, ed., ''Speaking the Truth: Zionism, Israel, and Occupation'', (Olive Branch Press: 2005), p. 12.</ref>  

In 2003, Tutu accepted the role as patron of [[Sabeel]] International,<ref>[http://www.comeandsee.com/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=464 Desmond Tutu lends his name to Sabeel], comeandsee.com, June 18, 2003.

Also in 2003, Archbishop Tutu received an International Advocate for Peace Award from the [[Cardozo School of Law]], an affiliate of [[Yeshiva University]], sparking scattered student protests and condemnations from representatives of the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Anti-Defamation League.<ref>[http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=7706&print=yes Tutu Honor Too Too Much?]</ref>  A 2006 opinion piece in the ''Jerusalem Post'' newspaper described him as "a friend, albeit a misguided one, of Israel and the Jewish people".<ref>Larry Derfner, "Anti-Semite and Jew", ''Jerusalem Post'', 15 October 2006, p. 15.</ref>  The [[Zionist Organization of America]] has led a campaign to protest Tutu's appearances at [[North America]]n campuses.  

In 2007, the president of the [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]] in [[Minnesota]] canceled a planned speech from Tutu, on the grounds that his presence might offend some members of the local Jewish community.<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/462/story/1463394.html Randy Furst, "St. Thomas won't host Tutu"], Minneapolis ''Star Tribune'', 4 October 2007.</ref>  Many faculty members opposed this decision, and with some describing Tutu as the victim of a [[smear campaign]]. Marv Davidov, an adjunct professor at the university's Justice and Peace Studies program, was quoted as saying "As a Jew who experienced real anti-Semitism as a child, I'm deeply disturbed that a man like Tutu could be labeled anti-Semitic and silenced like this. I deeply resent the Israeli lobby trying to silence any criticism of its policy. It does a great disservice to Israel and to all Jews."<ref>[http://articles.citypages.com/2007-10-03/news/banning-desmond-tutu/ Matt Snyders, "Banning Desmond Tutu"], ''City Pages (Minneapolis/St. Paul)'', 3 October 2007.</ref>  The school's president, Rev. Dennis Dease, denied that a lobbying effort had been conducted against Tutu, and was quoted as saying, "I was under no pressure from any pro-Israeli groups or individuals, nor did I receive any requests from them to refrain from inviting Archbishop Tutu to speak."<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/562/story/1481533.html Mark B. Rotenberg, "What We Can Learn From The Tutu Affair"], ''Minneapolis Star Tribune''.</ref>  

The group [[Jewish Voice for Peace]] led an email campaign calling on St. Thomas to reconsider its decision.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21157940/ Randy Furst, "St. Thomas urged to reconsider its decision not to invite Tutu"], ''Minneapolis Star-Tribune'', accessed 7 October 2007.</ref> On October, 10, 2007, Rev.

=== Nelson Mandela Foundation Lecture ===

After a decade of freedom for [[South Africa]], Archbishop Tutu was honored with the invitation to deliver the annual Nelson Mandela Foundation Lecture. On [[November 23]], [[2004]] Tutu was given the address entitled, "Look to the Rock from Which You Were Hewn'.  This lecture, critical of the [[African National Congress|ANC]]-controlled government, stirred a pot of controversy between Tutu and [[Thabo Mbeki]], calling into question "the right to criticise."[http://www.nu.ac.za/ccs/default.asp?3,28,10,1763]  After the first round of volleys were fired, [[South African Press Association]] [[journalist]], [[Ben Maclennan]] reported Tutu's response as:<ref>[http://www.armsdeal-vpo.co.za/quotes.html Quotes of the Week]</ref>
<blockquote>
"Thank you Mr President for telling me what you think of me, that I am--a liar with scant regard for the truth, and a charlatan posing with his concern for the poor, the hungry, the oppressed and the voiceless." --Tutu. (Ben Maclennan, Sapa, 2004-12-02)
</blockquote>

In January 2005, Tutu added his voice to the growing dissent over terrorist suspects held at [[Camp X-Ray]] in [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]], referring to detentions without trial as "utterly unacceptable."

On [[20 April]] [[2005]], after Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger was elected as [[Pope Benedict XVI]], Tutu said he was sad that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was unlikely to change its opposition to [[condom]]s amidst the fight against [[HIV]]/AIDS in [[Africa]]: "We would have hoped for someone more open to the more recent developments in the world, the whole question of the ministry of women and a more reasonable position with regards to condoms and HIV/AIDS."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4463873.stm|title=Africans hail conservative Pope|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2005-04-20]]|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref>

In February 2006 Tutu took part in the 9th Assembly of the [[World Council of Churches]], held in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]]. There he manifested his commitment to [[ecumenism]] and praised the efforts of Christian churches to promote dialogue to diminish their differences. For Desmond, "a united church is no optional extra."

=== Beit Hanoun ===
Desmond Tutu was named to head a United Nations fact-finding mission to the [[Gaza Strip]] town of [[Beit Hanoun]], where, in a [[Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident|November 2006 incident]] the [[Israel Defense Forces]] killed 19 civilians after troops wound up a week-long incursion aimed at curbing [[2006 Israel-Gaza conflict|Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel]] from the town.<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1162378513178]</ref>. Tutu planned to travel to the Palestinian territory to "assess the situation of victims, address the needs of survivors and make recommendations on ways and means to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli assaults," according to the president of the UN [[Human Rights Council]], [[Luis Alfonso De Alba]].<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1164881856613&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull "Israel may give no-no to Tutu's trip to Beit Hanun"] – ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', December 9, 2006.</ref> Israeli officials expressed concern that the report would be biased against Israel.  

Tutu cancelled the trip in mid-December, saying that Israel had refused to grant him the necessary travel clearance after more than a week of discussions. A spokesman from the Israeli foreign ministry indicated that no final decision had been made, to which Tutu responded, "At times ''not'' making a decision ''is'' making a decision. We couldn't obviously wait in limbo indefinitely."<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/11/news/UN_GEN_UN_Israel_Tutu.php "Desmond Tutu says Israel refused fact-finding mission to Gaza"], ''International Herald Tribune'', 11 December 2006.</ref> The [[Anti-Defamation League]] stated that the appointment of Tutu as head of the mission is not appropriate on the grounds that he would be a prepossessed observer, and criticized the mission for having not "address[ed] the continuing barrage of [[Kassam]] rockets fired into Israel by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, killing and maiming Israeli citizens...Tutu has already publicly expressed his anti-Israel views and his opinions regarding what happened in Beit Hanoun, and combined with the one-sided anti-Israel mandate provided by the resolution, the results of the mission are all-but preordained"<ref name="ADL on Beit Hanoun ">{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/UnitedNations_94/4933_94.htm|publisher="[[ADL]]"|title="ADL Blasts Appointment Of Desmond Tutu As Head Of U.N.

On July 18, 2007 in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, [[Nelson Mandela]], Graça Machel, and [[Desmond Tutu]] convened "The [[Global Elders]], a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom, leadership and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems.  Mandela announced its formation in a speech on his 89th birthday.  Archbishop Tutu is to serve as its Chair.  Other founding members include [[Kofi Annan]], [[Ela Bhatt]], [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Li Zhaoxing]], [[Mary Robinson]], [[Muhammad Yunus]] and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], whose chair was left symbolically empty due to her confinement as a [[political prisoner]] in [[Burma]].

“This group can speak freely and boldly, working both publicly and behind the scenes on whatever actions need to be taken,” Mandela commented.  “Together we will work to support courage where there is fear, foster agreement where there is conflict, and inspire hope where there is despair.”

The Elders will be independently funded by a group of Founders, including [[Richard Branson]], [[Peter Gabriel]], Ray Chambers, [[Michael Chambers]], Bridgeway Foundation, Pam [[Omidyar]], Humanity United, [[Amy Robbins]], Shashi Ruia, Dick Tarlow and the [[United Nations Foundation]].

==Quotes by Tutu==
{{Expand|date=February 2007}}
* "When missionaries came to South Africa, we had the land, they had the Bible. Then they told us, 'Let's close our eyes and pray.' When we opened our eyes we saw that we have the Bible, they have the land."
* "My heart aches. I say why are our memories so short. Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation? Have they forgotten the collective punishment, the home demolitions, in their own history so soon? Have they turned their backs on their profound and  chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality."
* "Good is stronger than evil; love is stronger than hate; light is stronger than darkness; life is stronger than death. Victory is ours, through him who loves us."
* "If God, as they say, is homophobic, I wouldn’t worship that God." [http://www.liberalavenger.com/2007/11/19/im-glad-to-see-that-the-god-business-still-pays-well]

==Criticism of Tutu==
{{Expand|date=February 2007}}
In August 2006 Archbishop Tutu publicly urged [[Jacob Zuma]], the South African politician who had been accused of sexual crimes and corruption, to drop out of the ANC's presidential succession race. Zuma's personal advisor responded by accusing Tutu of having double standards and "selective amnesia" (as well as being old). [[Elias Khumalo]] claims the archbishop “had found it so easy to accept the apology from the apartheid government that committed unspeakable atrocities against millions of South Africans”, yet now “cannot find it in his heart to accept the apology from this humble man who has erred”. Tutu and Zuma’s public criticism of each other are reflections of a turbulent time in South African politics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=282735&area=/insight/insight__national/|title=Zuma camp lashes out at 'old' Tutu|publisher+[[Mail & Guardian]]|date=[[2006-09-01]]|accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref>
