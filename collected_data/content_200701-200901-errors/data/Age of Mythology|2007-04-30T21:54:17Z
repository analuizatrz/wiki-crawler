'''''Age of Mythology''''' (also known as '''''AoM''''') is a [[mythology]]-based [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) [[Video game|computer game]] by [[Ensemble Studios]]. It was first released in November [[2002]], by [[Microsoft Game Studios]]. Following both good reviews and sales, [[Age of Mythology: The Titans]] expansion pack was released in 2003. Although it is a continuation of the ''[[Age of Empires series]]'', ''Age of Mythology'' focuses less on historical accuracy, instead centering around the [[mythology|myths]] and legends of the [[Greek mythology|Ancient Greeks]], the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Ancient Egyptians]], and the [[Norse mythology|Norse]]. 

''Age of Mythology'' is different from other Ensemble Studios games because it takes place in a [[Pantheistic solipsism|Pantheistic solipsistic]] universe. Unlike previous ''Age of Empires'' games, which followed the historical progress of various [[nation]]s or [[culture]]s, ''Age of Mythology'' follows the exploits of a band of [[hero]]es in an adventure that takes them through all three [[civilization]]s.

==Gameplay==
Like other [[real-time strategy]] games (especially ''AoM'''s predecessors, the ''Age of Empires'' series), the core of the game is based around building towns to gather resources, create armies, and ultimately destroy the enemies. Players advance their civilization through four "ages": starting in the Archaic Age, the player can then upgrade to the Classical age, to the Heroic Age, and finally to the Mythic Age. Each of these ages unlocks more powerful units, buildings, and upgrades.

There are 4 major resources in ''Age of Mythology'': food, wood, gold, and favor. Each of these resources is used in creating infantry, buildings or researching upgrades. Resources are gathered by civilian units: the Greek Villager, Norse gatherers and dwarves, and the Egyptian laborer. Food can be collected by hunting animals, gathering berries, harvesting livestock, farming, or fishing with civilian units known as fishing ships. Wood is gathered from forests, and gold is gathered from gold mines. Each civilization can purchase upgrades that increase the rate of gathering these resources.

<i>Age of Mythology</i>'s gameplay differs from that of other [[real time strategy]] games in that players are able to choose gods for their civilization to follow. At the beginning of a game and when advancing to another age, the player is offered a choice of one of two or three gods, and the player can then summon their [[List of Major Gods in Age of Mythology and The Titans|god]]'s unique powers. These powers can massively change the flow of the game, adding a more catastrophic element to ''AoM'''s gameplay.

Another unique element in ''Age of Mythology'' is the "favor" system. Favor is gained by "pleasing the gods" and allows players to train myth units and research certain technologies.  '''Greek''' players earn favor by praying at [[temple | temples]] with villagers.  '''Egyptian''' players earn favor by building [[monument | monuments]].  '''Norse''' players earn favor by fighting, or by possessing heroes. <!-- something about heroes and/or myth units as well? -->

===Civilizations===
There are 3 playable civilizations in the game, which differ greatly.  The civilizations are Greek, Egyptian, and Norse. The [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] civilization is available in [[Age of Mythology: The Titans|The Titans]] expansion pack.

Players can choose one of three initial Gods of a civilization as they begin, and one of two more gods each time they advance in age. Each God has its own unique technologies, myth units, and god powers (special abilities which can only be used once per game).

'''The Greeks''', based on the ancient [[Greeks|Greek]] civilization, are considered the most basic civilization in ''AoM'', in that they are extremely similar to other games in the ''Age of Empires'' series. The Greeks gain favor by assigning villagers to pray at temples. The Greeks train their military units at different buildings based off of class. Barracks are used to train melee infantry, archery ranges train ranged infantry and stables are used to train cavalry. The Greeks are considered to be the most balanced civilization in the game, balancing strength and cost of units.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

'''The Egyptians''' are based on the ancient Egyptian civilization living in the [[Nile]] River Valley in north east Africa. The Egyptians differ from other civilizations in the ''Age of Empires'' series in that they are led by a pharaoh who is capable of healing units and more notably empowering buildings, which increases the rate at which units are produced, technologies are researched and villagers gather who are using the building as a drop off site (priests also gain these abilities for players who choose [[Ra]] as their primary deity). Egyptian buildings use gold as the primary building resource as opposed to wood, but are still considerably cheap. The Egyptians' economy and defense are their strongest points.

'''The Norse''' are based on the ancient [[Scandinavia]]n people.  They greatly differ from other ''Age of Empires'' series games in that their villagers are only used for gathering resources and can not build.  All building is done by the infantry units. The Norse also have a special villager, the dwarf, who can gather gold faster, but is slower in gathering other resources. While the other civilizations gain favor from praying and building monuments, the Norse gain favor by winning battles or razing buildings. The Norse units generally move faster and have greater attack power, but suffer in hit points and armor. The Norse are considered the most aggressive civilization in the game.<ref name="gamershell">{{cite web | last = Burrell | first = M. | title = Age of Mythology Review - GamersHell.com | publisher = GamersHell.com | url = http://www.gamershell.com/pc/age_of_mythology/review.html | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref>

See ''[[List of Major Gods in Age of Mythology and The Titans]]'' for a full list of Gods, their God Powers, improvements and more. Also see ''[[List of Minor Gods in Age of Mythology and The Titans]]'' for a list of all the minor Gods and their God Powers.

===Units===
The bulk of each civilization’s forces are made of ordinary human soldiers. Each civilization has a finite number of "population slots," that can be upgraded by building more houses, and each unit created takes up a certain amount of population slots. Most units can be upgraded through research (such as faster gathering for villagers, stronger armour for military units or better building structure). The Greek villager, Norse gatherers and dwarves, and Egyptian laborers are the primary gatherers of the resources in ''AoM'': food, wood, gold, and favor; which are in turn used to create other units, buildings, or research upgrades.

Infantry units, such as [[hoplite]]s, [[militia]], and [[Housecarl|huskarls]], use melee combat to attack at hand-to-hand range (although the [[Francisca|throwing axeman]] can attack at a short range). Norse infantry are capable of constructing and repairing buildings (Norse gatherers and dwarves can not construct buildings). [[Cavalry]] are melee units mounted on horses, camels, or war elephants. [[Archer]]s are either on foot or mounted, and attack at range. 

There are four types of [[siege]] weapons: [[catapult]]s, [[battering ram]]s, [[ballista]]s, and [[siege tower]]s. <!-- All siege weapons do crush damage. Comment: What does this mean? --> Catapults hurl stones which generate splash damage, affecting all units in a small area, and are especially effective against buildings. Battering rams knock buildings down with large moving beams. Ballistae are less damaging against buildings, but are much faster than catapults, and are the most effective siege weapons against units. Siege towers can transport units and are moderately effective against buildings and units. 

[[Naval]] units are also present in ''Age of Mythology'', but are not as prominent as in other ''Age of Empires'' games. Fishing boats are similar to villagers in that they can gather food from fish. Egyptian fishing boats are also capable of constructing certain buildings when near the shore. Transport ships carry land units from one area of land to another. Warships can attack other enemy ships and can be very effective in attacking land-based units close to the shoreline (because the land-based units cannot fight back, unless ranged). Warships are classified as arrow ships, ramming ships, or siege ships. Arrow ships are strong against hammer ships and units, hammer ships attack in melee and are strong against siege ships, and siege ships have long range and are strong against arrow ships and buildings.

Mythological units are representations of non-human creatures in mythology. For example, there was only one [[hydra]] in mythology (slain by [[Heracles]]), but multiple hydra may be summoned in Age of Mythology. Myth units generally have special abilities that human soldiers do not possess (such as [[flight]] or [[Petrifaction|petrification]]). In addition to normal resources, myth units require an amount of the Favor resource to be summoned. Myth units are deadly against human soldiers, but are weak against Heroes, who are normally unaffected by their special abilities. Myth units are generally very expensive; a single myth unit is usually worth several human soldiers, both in battle and cost-wise. Myth units also take up more population slots than human soldiers. Examples of myth units are [[minotaur]]s, [[Colossus|colossi]], [[centaur]]s, [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenixes]], [[valkyrie]]s and [[mummy|mummies]].

===Heroes===
Heroes are representations of the epic characters within mythology. Heroes in ''Age of Mythology'' are very effective against myth units, but are weak against human soldiers. They can also pick up relics. <!-- argh... someone explain what relics are please. Probably not in this section, but in an earlier section. --> Each civilization has a different way to get heroes. 

Heroes can be killed like other units, but those important to a scenario (such as Arkantos) merely fall down, until enemy units are eliminated and friendly units are nearby (a concept replicated with Explorers in ''[[Age of Empires III]]'').

'''The Greeks''' can have four pre-determined heroes from Greek mythology, one for each age. Greek heroes are more expensive and powerful than those of other civilizations and can be re-trained if killed. Each Greek hero is unique, and the ones available to the player will depend on the chosen Major God. 

'''The Egyptians''' have two heroes. The Pharaoh can empower buildings (speeding construction, resource gathering and improving combat ability, if any), heal nearby units, and have a ranged attack which increases in power in later ages, and is devastating to myth units.  When a Pharaoh dies, he will be replaced automatically. The Priest can be trained at temples and town centers, and is in essence a weaker version of the Pharaoh - it can heal nearby units, and is very strong against myth units, but it cannot empower buildings (unless Ra is set as a Major God), though more than one Priest can be created. Priests are also able to construct [[Obelisk]]s: cheap buildings that have no attack but a large line-of-sight, which allow Priests to serve as scouts. The Priests have additional abilities, depending on their Major God: Priests of Ra can empower (not as well as the Pharaoh), Priests of Isis can build Obelisks faster and cheaper, and Priests of Set can convert wild animals into "beasts of Set".

'''Norse''' heroes are Hersir, trained at temples and longhouses. Hersir, like all Norse infantry, are able to construct buildings, and more than one Hersir hero can be created. Hersir, as heroes, do bonus damage against myth units and, as infantry, are also strong against cavalry. Although not weak, they are not cost-effective for use against human soldiers, especially counter-infantry and archers. Hersir generate favor faster than other Norse units, and even generate some favor just for existing. Hersir that worship [[Loki]] as a Major God also spontaneously summon random myth units into battle. The summoning is random (the units just appear while the Hersir is fighting), and the units are under your control. You need not be able to summon these units at your temple (followers of Loki are never able to summon valkyrie at temples, for example, yet valkyrie are a fairly common unit for Hersir to summon), although you must be in the requisite age to summon the myth unit (you cannot summon Mythic age units in the Classical age, for example). Hersir can only summon land-based Norse myth units, and they cost no resources but they do, however, take up population slots.

===Buildings===
[[Image:AoMGreekScreenie.jpg|thumb|right| This ''Age of Mythology'' screenshot shows a Greek player shortly after the start of a random map game.  The Town Centre can be seen on the left, 3 villagers in the center, and a scout moving south.  There also two sentry towers visible.]]
Buildings are used for a variety of purposes in ''Age of Mythology''. Town Centers are the main buildings in the empire. They serve as drop off points for resources, and can shoot arrows, garrison units inside them, train villagers or heroes, and, depending on the civilization, also train ulfsarks, priests, mercenaries, and mercenary cavalry. Building upgrades and age advancements are also researched here. <!-- Town Centers can be built on free Settlements. Comment: What does that mean? --> A single Town Center provides 15 population slots. In order to gain more population slots, either more Town Centers or [[house]]s must be built. The population limit is 300.

Military units are created in specific buildings, corresponding to their combat type (for example, archers are created in an Archery Range). Myth units are created at Temples. All sea units are created in Docks. Walls and towers are defensive fortifications, and a fortress is a fortified building which can train special units, such as siege weapons or heroes. Farms are used to produce food. Granaries, storage pits, and the Town Center are used to store resources (deposited by the villagers).

A [[Monument|Wonder]] is a large building that represents an architectural achievement of the civilization. Wonders have many hit points, and take a long time to build. In certain game modes, once a player builds a wonder, a ten minute countdown begins. If the wonder is still standing after the countdown ends, the player who built the wonder wins. Also, all computer controlled allied military units are programmed to guard wonders, while enemies are programmed to destroy them. The Wonder can only be built in Supremacy and Lightning game modes. <!-- might want to have a section/sub section elaborating on the game modes up in Gameplay... --> Wonders also slowly produce favor when built by Greek civilizations.

==Campaign==
{{spoilers}}

Unlike the campaign modes in [[Age of Empires]] and [[Age of Empires II]], Age of Mythology only has one central [[campaign]] that tells a long story, as opposed to the short unrelated campaigns in its predecessors.

Age of Mythology’s campaign is entitled ''Fall of the Trident'', and tells the story of [[List_of_characters_in_the_Age_of_Mythology_series#Arkantos | Arkantos]], an [[Atlantis | Atlantean]] general who is sent on a quest with the goal of regaining favour from [[Poseidon]], God of the Atlantean people.

Arkantos’ quest takes him to the Trojan War, where he meets [[List_of_characters_in_the_Age_of_Mythology_series#Ajax | Ajax]], [[List_of_characters_in_the_Age_of_Mythology_series#Agamemnon | Agamemnon]], and [[List_of_characters_in_the_Age_of_Mythology_series#Odysseus | Odysseus]].  After winning the war, he continues in his travels, and meets [[List_of_characters_in_the_Age_of_Mythology_series#Chiron | Chiron]].  Chiron advises him to follow [[List_of_characters_in_the_Age_of_Mythology_series#Gargarensis | Gargarensis]], a follower of [[Poseidon]].  Arkantos, Ajax, and Chiron travel through the [[Erebus | underworld]] in their search for Gargarensis, and end up in [[Egypt]].

In Egypt, Arkantos meets [[List_of_characters_in_the_Age_of_Mythology_series#Amanra | Amanra]], who asks for his assistance in domestic issues.  He obliges, and assists her in piecing together [[Osiris]] before moving north, still in search of Gargarensis.

In the Norse lands, Arkantos meets [[List_of_characters_in_the_Age_of_Mythology_series#Reginleif | Reginleif]], and together they attempt to prevent the [[Ragnarok]] from taking place.  They encounter Gargarensis again, and he traps them in a small valley with no escapes.  In this valley, they must survive onslaughts from Gargarensis’ forces, and wait for aid from Odysseus.

Whilst the heroes are fighting Gargarensis’ forces, he establishes himself in Atlantis, locking up its former leaders.  Towards the end of the campaign, Arkantos and his allies march on Atlantis, and [[Zeus]] bestows his blessing upon Arkantos, giving him the power to defeat Poseidon and Gargarensis.  After killing Poseiden’s living statue, Arkantos dies, and is immortalised by [[Athena]].

==Scenario editor==
The scenario editor is contained in AoM extras. It is far more advanced than that of [[Age of Empires II]] ,or any other comparable game at the time.  It allows a map to be created from placing buildings and units, to raising the land into steep mountains and even place cinematics or special effects. You can modify units by using the triggers section. All you have to do is go into triggers, select "effects", change the effect to "modify protounit", select the effect and click insert for a new effect. You can play with the effects to find different types of effects.

==Development==
Following the announcement of the game for [[September]] [[2002]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/news/12_17_01_12_32PM.htm|title=Age of Mythology announced|publisher=GameZone|accessdate=2007-04-27|date=2004-12-17}}</ref> a [[Game demo|trial]] version was released to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/dl/demo|title=Age of Mythology Trial|publisher=AoM Heaven|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>  This contained a shortened version of the [[Age of Mythology#Campaign | campaign]] (5 scenarios) and 2 random maps.  It also contained the ability to play as all of the nine gods.

''Age of Mythology'' underwent a large amount of play testing during its developmental phase, as Ensemble Studios attempted to create a more balanced and competitive game then its predecessors.  Greg T. Smith commented that one of the reasons ''AoM'' is so popular is because the development team spent many hours working on the game through active testing, rather then just taking advice from a "faceless drone in another building."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/devdiary/september02/aom3/|last=Street|first=Greg T.|title=Age of Mythology: Volume III|accessdate=2007-04-29|date=2002-09-05|publisher=GameSpy}}</ref> 

There was also much debate during ''AoM'''s construction concerning the unbalanced nature of god powers, and how to make them more balanced, whilst still leaving an element of fun in them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/devdiary/august02/aom2/|title=Age of Mythology: Volume II|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=2007-04-29|last=Street|first= Greg T.|date=2002-08-21}}</ref> It was concluded that the best way to make it fair for everyone was to limit the use of god powers to one a game (although this was changed in the expansion).

On [[September 30]], [[2003]], [[Ensemble Studios]] released an expansion to ''Age of Mythology'', dubbed ''[[Age of Mythology: The Titans]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofmythologytitans/index.html?q=Age%20of%20Mythology:%20The%20Titans&tag=result;title;0 |title=Age of Mythology: The Titans|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>  It contains a new civilization, the Atlanteans, new units, as well as [[Titan|titans]]; massive myth units capable of destroying entire armies.

==Reception==
''Age of Mythology'' was well-received by the public, reaching an estimated 1 million units sold within five months of its release.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Video-games-survey.com | title = Video Game Software Sales Estimates | url = http://www.video-games-survey.com/software.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-21}}</ref> The game was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' Interactive Achievement Awards for PC Game of the Year, as well as PC Strategy Game of the Year. It also received an average score of 89 (out of 100) on [[Metacritic]] (based on 31 reviews), ranking it as the 71st highest-rated computer game on the site.<ref name="metacritic">{{cite web | title = Age of Mythology (pc: 2002): Reviews | publisher = [[Metacritic]] | url = http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/ageofmythology | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref> Review website Netjak gave the game a score of 9.3 (out of 10), praising it as being "simply divine".<ref name="netjak">{{cite web | last = Lubitz | title = Age of Mythology - PC | publisher = Netjak | url = http://www.netjak.com/Reviews/windows/aom.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref> However, other critics complained of the game's similarity to its predecessors, [[Game-Revolution]] saying that "[the] gameplay has been passed down from generation to generation for many, many years."<ref name="gamerevolution">{{cite web | last = Ferris | first = Duke | title = Game Revolution PC Review Page - Age of Mythology | publisher = [[Game Revolution]] | url = http://www.gamerevolution.com/oldsite/games/pc/strategy/age_of_mythology.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref>
