'''Key''' is a [[Japan]]ese [[visual novel]] studio, known for making dramatic and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]-oriented [[dating sim]]s. Their debut release ''[[Kanon]]'' was hugely successful in Japan. It combined an elaborate and sentimental storyline, an up-to-date [[anime]] drawing style and a popular musical score.

Their second game, ''[[Air (series)|Air]]'', was similarly well received in Japan, having a similar if not more complex storyline. Both ''Kanon'' and ''Air'' sold over a million copies and also had non-erotic console ports released for the [[Dreamcast]] and the [[PlayStation 2]].

''[[Clannad (game)|Clannad]]'' is a [[dating sim]] similar to its previous games, but is entirely clean, without any [[ecchi]] content. ''Clannad'' suffered many delays before its release, leading to a great deal of anticipation from fans. The game finally released in [[2004]] and, although with more than two years of delay, was still popular.

In [[2004]], Key also released ''[[Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume]]''. ''Planetarian'', in contrast to Key's past games, is a linear visual novel that does not require the user to make a choice, but to sit back and enjoy the story. ''Planetarian'' is also the shortest of Key's games.

==History==
Before forming the company Key, the initial members that founded the company worked for another computer game developing company called [[Tactics (company)|Tactics]]. While working there, the team that later became Key produced three games: ''[[Dousei]]'', ''[[Moon (game)|Moon]]'' and ''[[One (game)|One ~kagayaku kisetsu e~]]''. After the release of ''One'', the core Key team split off from Tactics and formed Key where they ultimately produced their first game, ''Kanon''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?t=36881&page=3|title=AnimeSuki forums regarding pre-Key Tactics games|accessdate=2006-12-24}}</ref>
