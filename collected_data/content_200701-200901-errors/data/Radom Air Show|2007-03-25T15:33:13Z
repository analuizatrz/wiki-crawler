The ''Radom Air Show'' (referred to in Polish as "[[Air Show]]") is a biannual celebration in the city of [[Radom]], [[Poland]], which began in 2000 (to continue in 2001, 2002, 2003 and then 2005). Every other year during the last weekend of August, military planes from the [[Air Forces]] of [[Europe]] and [[Russia]] are gathered in Radom for the show, which entertains visitors through elaborate stunts and performances from the planes. According to the authorities behind the show, its aim is to entertain the citizens of Radom and all of Poland, as well as to bring much needed investors to the city.

Since its founding, the Radom Air Show has become the most popular and attended air show in all of Poland.
