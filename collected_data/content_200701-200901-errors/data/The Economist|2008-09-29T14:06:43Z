'''''The Economist''''' is an [[English language|English]]-language weekly news and [[international affairs]] publication owned by ''The Economist Newspaper Ltd'' and edited in [[London]]. Continuous publication began under founder [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]] in September 1843. While ''The Economist'' calls itself a "newspaper", each issue appears on glossy [[paper]], like a [[newsmagazine]]. In 2007, it reported an average [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of just over 1.3 million copies per issue<ref> {{cite web |url=http://ads.economist.com/the-economist/circulation/worldwide-circulation/ |title=Worldwide circulation vitality |accessdate=2008-05-20 |format= |work=economist.com}}</ref>, about half of which are sold in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5250996 |title=E.M.

The publication belongs to [[The Economist Group]], half of which is owned by the ''[[Financial Times]]'', a subsidiary of [[Pearson PLC]].

A [[board of trustees]] formally appoints the editor, who cannot be removed without their permission. In addition, about two-thirds of the seventy-five staff journalists are based in London, despite the global emphasis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/so-whats-the-secret-of-the-economist-467698.html |title=So what's the secret of 'The Economist'? |accessdate=2008-04-27 |format= |work=independent.co.uk }}</ref>

== Features ==

''The Economist'''s primary focus is world [[news]], [[politics]] and [[business]], but it also runs regular sections on [[science]] and [[technology]] as well as books and the [[art]]s.   Every two weeks, the publication adds an in-depth special report on a particular issue, business sector or geographical region. Every three months, it publishes a technology report called Technology Quarterly or TQ.

Articles often take a definite editorial stance and almost never carry a [[byline]]. Not even the name of the [[editing|editor]] (from 2006, [[John Micklethwait]]) is printed in the issue. It is a longstanding tradition that an editor's only signed article during his tenure is written on the occasion of his departure from the position. The author of a piece is named in certain circumstances: when notable persons are invited to contribute opinion pieces; when ''Economist'' writers compile special reports; and to highlight a potential [[conflict of interest]] over a book review. The names of ''Economist'' editors and correspondents can be located, however, via the media directory pages of the website.

The publication boasts a tight writing style that seeks to include the maximum amount of information in a limited space.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/research/StyleGuide/ |title=The Economist style guide |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> [[Atlantic Monthly]] publisher David G. Bradley described the formula as "a consistent world view expressed, consistently, in tight and engaging prose."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/magazines/more_on_atlantic_medias_new_superstar_20765.asp |title=A Seven Year Ambition |work=mediabistro.com }}</ref>

Since 1995, ''The Economist'' has published one [[obituary]] every week, of a significant person, not necessarily famous, from any field of endeavour. In addition, ''The Economist'' is known for its [[Big Mac Index]], which uses the price of a [[Big Mac]] hamburger sold by [[McDonald's]] in different [[country|countries]] as an informal measure of the [[purchasing power parity|purchasing power]] of currencies.

The publication includes several opinion columns, whose names reflect the topic they concentrate on:
* ''Bagehot'' ([[United Kingdom|Britain]]) &mdash; named for [[Walter Bagehot]] ({{pronEng|ˈbædʒət}}), nineteenth-century British constitutional expert and early editor of ''The Economist''.
* ''Charlemagne'' (Europe) &mdash; named for [[Charlemagne]], founder of the [[Frankish Empire]].
* ''Lexington'' ([[United States]]) &mdash; named for [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], the site of the beginning of the [[American War of Independence]], and written by [[Adrian Wooldridge]].{{Fact|date=August 2008}} 
* ''Buttonwood'' ([[finance]]) &mdash; named for the [[Platanus occidentalis|buttonwood]] tree where early [[Wall Street]] traders gathered. Until September 2006 this was available only as an online column, but it is now included in the print edition.

Two other regular columns are:
* ''Face Value'': about prominent people in the business world.
* ''Economics Focus'': a general economics column, frequently based on academic research. 

The magazine goes to press on Thursdays, is available online from Thursday between 6 and 7pm GMT, and is available on [[newsstand]]s in many countries the next day. It is printed at seven sites around the world. 

''The Economist'' also produces the annual ''The World in'' [''Year''] publication. In addition, it sponsors yearly "[[Innovation Awards]]", in the categories of bioscience, computing and communications, energy and the environment, social and economic innovation, business-process innovation, consumer products, and a special “no boundaries” category. It also sponsors a writing award.

In 1845 during [[Railway Mania]], ''The Economist'' changed its name to ''The Economist, Weekly Commercial Times, Bankers' Gazette, and Railway Monitor. A Political, Literary and General Newspaper''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue8_9/odlyzko/ |title=The many paradoxes of broadband |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=firstmonday.org }}</ref>

== Opinions ==
{{Main article|The Economist editorial stance}}

When the newspaper was founded, the term "[[economism]]" denoted what would today be termed "[[fiscal conservatism]]" in the [[United States]], or "[[economic liberalism]]" in the rest of the world (and historically in the United States as well). ''The Economist'' generally supports [[free markets]],  [[globalisation]],  and free [[immigration]], has been described as [[neo-liberal]].<ref name=Grauniad>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/jan/11/economy.g8 George Monbiot, Punitive - and it works, The Guardian, January 11, 2005]</ref> It also supports [[social liberalism]], including legalised drugs and prostitution. This contrast is attributed to ''The Economist's'' roots in [[classical liberalism]], disfavoring government interference in either social or economic activity,{{Fact|date=May 2008}} although the newspaper favors a [[carbon tax]] to fight [[global warming]].<ref>[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11543656 Buttonwood, The Economist, June 14, 2008]</ref>  According to former editor Bill Emmott, "the ''Economist'''s philosophy has always been liberal, not conservative."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,408484,00.html |title=Time for a referendum on the monarchy |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=[[The Guardian]] }}</ref> Individual contributors take diverse views. 

''The Economist'' has endorsed both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]] in recent British elections, and both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates in the United States. ''Economist.com'' puts its stance this way:

{{quotation|What, besides free trade and free markets, does ''The Economist'' believe in? "It is to the Radicals that ''The Economist'' still likes to think of itself as belonging. The extreme centre is the paper's historical position." That is as true today as when former ''Economist'' editor Geoffrey Crowther said it in 1955. ''The Economist'' considers itself the enemy of privilege, pomposity and predictability. It has backed conservatives such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. It has supported the Americans in Vietnam. But it has also endorsed Harold Wilson and Bill Clinton, and espoused a variety of liberal causes: opposing capital punishment from its earliest days, while favouring penal reform and decolonisation, as well as&mdash;more recently&mdash;gun control and gay marriage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/help/DisplayHelp.cfm?folder=663377 |title=About us |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref>}}

''The Economist'' frequently accuses figures and countries of corruption or dishonesty. In recent years, for example, it criticised World Bank president [[Paul Wolfowitz]], [[Silvio Berlusconi]], [[Italy]]'s Prime Minister (who dubbed it ''The Ecommunist''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/09/324682.html |title=Report of Rome anti-war demo on Saturday 24th with photos |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=[[Indymedia]] }}</ref>); [[Laurent Kabila]], the late president of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]; [[Robert Mugabe]], the head of government in [[Zimbabwe]] and, recently, [[Cristina Kirchner]], the president of [[Argentina]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cristina in the land of make believe|publisher=The Economist|date=May 1, 2008|url=http://www.economist.com/world/la/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11293743}}</ref> ''The Economist'' also called for [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's impeachment]] and later for [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s resignation after the emergence of the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2647493 |title=Resign Rumsfeld |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> ''The Economist'' initially was a vocal supporter for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, but it has since called the operation "bungled from the start" and criticised the "almost criminal negligence" of the Bush Administration’s handling of the war, while maintaining, as of April 2008, that pulling out in the short term would be irresponsible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RRRTGGP |title=Mugged by reality |accessdate=2007-04-09 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> In the 2004 U.S. election, the editors reluctantly backed John Kerry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_QTVPPQ |title=Crunch time in America |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3329802 |title=The incompetent or the incoherent? |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> The paper has also supported some left-wing issues{{Fact|date=December 2007}} such as progressive taxation, criticising the [[Taxation in the United States|U.S. tax model]] in a recent issue, and seems to support some government regulation on health issues, such as smoking in public, as well as bans on spanking children.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11455006 Spare The Rod, Say Some], The Economist, May 31, 2008</ref>  ''The Economist'' consistently favours guest worker programs, parental choice of school, and amnesties<ref>[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displayStory.cfm?story_id=6744217 Sense, not Sensenbrenner], The Economist, March 30, 2006</ref> and once published an "obituary" of God.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary: God|publisher=The Economist|date=December 23, 1999|url=http://www.economist.com/diversions/millennium/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=347578}}</ref>

== Tone and voice ==

''The Economist'' does not print by-lines identifying the authors of articles other than surveys and special "by invitation" contribution. The editors say this is necessary because "collective voice and personality matter more than the identities of individual journalists."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/about/about_economist.cfm |title=The Economist &mdash; About us |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> Authors refer to themselves within articles as "your correspondent" or "this reviewer." The newspaper allows a rare exception to prevent conflicts of interest, as when reviewing a book written by an ''Economist'' staffer. In addition, retiring editors are permitted a signed farewell article.

The editorial staff enforces a uniform voice throughout its pages,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/ |title=The Economist &mdash; Style guide |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> as if most articles were written by a single author, displaying dry, understated wit, and precise use of language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/index.cfm?page=673927 |title=The Economist &mdash; Tone |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/research/johnson/ |title=Johnson |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> <!--a trait which many define as "classically British":needs a source-->  The paper's treatment of economics presumes a working familiarity with fundamental concepts of classical economics. For instance, it does not explain terms like [[invisible hand]], [[macroeconomics]], or [[demand curve]], and may take just six or seven words to explain the theory of [[comparative advantage]]. However, articles involving economics do not presume any formal training on the part of the reader and aim to be accessible to the educated [[layperson]]. The newspaper usually does not translate short French quotes or phrases, and sentences in Ancient Greek or Latin are not uncommon. It does, however, describe the business or nature of even well-known entities; writing, for example, "Goldman Sachs, an investment bank."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.co.uk/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10740475&CFID=1952750&CFTOKEN=20002991 |title=A bank by any other name |accessdate=2008-09-16 |work=economist.com }}</ref>

Many articles include some witticism; image captions are often humorous and the letters section usually concludes with an odd or light-hearted letter. These efforts at humour have sometimes had a mixed reception. For example, the cover of the September 20, 2003 issue, headlined by a story on the [[Cancún]] [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] ministerial meeting, featured a cactus [[Finger (gesture)|giving the middle finger]].<ref>[http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayCover.cfm?url=/images/20030920/20030920issuecovUS400.jpg Issue Cover for Sep 20th 2003], economist.com</ref> Readers sent both positive and negative letters in response.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_NDJJSJP Letters: Pointing the Finger], The Economist, October 2, 2003</ref>

== Circulation ==

Each ''Economist'' issue's official date range is from Saturday to the next Friday. In the UK print copies are dispatched late Thursday, for Friday delivery to retail outlets. Elsewhere, retail outlets and subscribers receive their copies on Friday or (more often) Saturday, depending on their location. The ''Economist'' Web site posts each week's new content by Friday morning, ahead of the official publication date.

Circulation for the newspaper, audited by the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations]] (ABC), was over 1.2 million for the first half of 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ads.economist.com/the-economist/circulation/worldwide-circulation/ |title=Worldwide circulation |accessdate=2007-08-21 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> 
Sales inside North America were around 54 percent of the total, with sales in the UK making up 14 percent of the total and continental Europe 19 percent. ''The Economist'' claims sales, both by subscription and on newsstands, in over 200 countries. Global sales have doubled since 1997. Of its American readers, two out of three make more than $100,000 a year.<ref name="gainsreaders">{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5250996 |title='Economist' Magazine Wins American Readers |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=[[NPR]] }}</ref>

''The Economist'' once bragged about its limited circulation. In the early 1990s it used the slogan "''The Economist'' - not read by millions of people." "Never in the history of journalism has so much been read for so long by so few," wrote Geoffrey Crowther, a former editor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED3D3B56996BE43&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM

The Economist Newspaper Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[The Economist Group]]. The publications of the group include the ''CFO'' brand family as well as the annual ''The World in...'', the lifestyle quarterly ''[[Intelligent Life]]'', ''[[European Voice]]'', and ''[[Roll Call]]'', touted "the Newspaper of [[Capitol Hill]]". Sir [[Evelyn de Rothschild]] was Chairman of the company from 1972 to 1989.

== Letters ==

''The Economist'' frequently receives letters from senior businesspeople, politicians and spokespeople for government departments, non-governmental organisations and lobbies, but well written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of [[Corporate Social Responsibility]], published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from [[Oxfam]], the [[UN World Food Programme]], [[UN Global Compact]], the Chairman of [[BT Group plc|BT]], an ex-Director of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and the UK [[Institute of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/542754 |title=Compilation: Full text of responses to Economist survey on Corporate Social Responsibility (January-February 2005) |accessdate=2007-02-03 |work=Business & Human Rights}}</ref>

Many of the letters published are critical of its stance or commentary. After ''The Economist'' ran a critique of [[Amnesty International]] and [[human rights]] in general in its issue dated March 24, 2007, its letters page ran a vibrant reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the [[UN Human Rights Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8954694 |title=Letters: On Amnesty International and human rights, Iraq, tax breaks Apr 4 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-09|work=Economist.com}}</ref> Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed, to comply with local right-of-reply laws without compromising editorial independence.<ref>[http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=CnZjYJ3TduUC&pg=PA173&lpg=PA173&dq=%22the+economist%22+singapore+%22letters+page&source=web&ots=f5J8dzz-rF&sig=WZlbfq5s7RHAa0IbThT7VaEg9lE&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result ''The Media Enthralled'', Francis T. Seow, 1998, pages 171-175]</ref> It is extremely rare for any comment by The Economist to appear alongside any published letter.  Letters published in the magazine are typically between 150 and 200 words long (and begin with the ritual salutation "Sir"). Most other letters received are published online in "[http://www.economist.com/debate/theinbox/ The Inbox]".

== Censorship ==

Sections of ''The Economist'' criticising authoritarian regimes, such as [[People's Republic of China|China]], are frequently removed from the newspaper by the authorities in those countries. Despite having its Asia-Pacific office in [[Singapore]], ''The Economist'' regularly has difficulties with the [[Lee Kuan Yew|Lee]] dynasty, which has successfully sued it for [[libel]] on a number of occasions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HL01Ae01.html |title=Inconvenient truths in Singapore |accessdate=2007-01-31 |format= |work=[[Asia Times]] }}</ref>

On June 15, 2006 [[Iran]] banned the sale of ''The Economist'' when it published a map labelling the [[Persian Gulf]] simply as "Gulf" — a choice that derives its political significance from the [[Persian Gulf naming dispute]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150191582529&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |title=Iran bans ''The Economist'' over map |accessdate=2007-01-31 |format= |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] }}</ref>

[[Robert Mugabe|Robert Mugabe's]] government in [[Zimbabwe]] went further, and imprisoned [[Andrew Meldrum]], ''The Economist'''s correspondent there. The government charged him with violating a statute on "publishing untruth" for writing that a woman was decapitated by Mugabe supporters. The [[decapitation]] claim was retracted and allegedly fabricated by the woman's husband. The correspondent was later acquitted, only to receive a [[deportation]] order.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=2574 |title=Guardian and RFI correspondent risks two years in jail |accessdate=2007-01-31 |format= |work=[[Reporters Without Borders]] }}</ref>

== Special features ==

Roughly every two weeks, ''The Economist'' publishes [http://www.economist.com/specialreports/ special reports] (previously called [[survey article|surveys]]) on a given topic. The five main categories are [http://www.economist.com/specialreports/specialreportslist.cfm?category=455021 Countries and Regions], [http://www.economist.com/specialreports/specialreportslist.cfm?category=455022 Business], [http://www.economist.com/specialreports/specialreportslist.cfm?category=455023 Finance and Economics], [http://www.economist.com/specialreports/specialreportslist.cfm?category=455024 Science and Technology], and [http://www.economist.com/specialreports/specialreportslist.cfm?category=455025 Other]. The reports are series of ([[byline]]d) summary and analysis articles.  Every three months, it publishes a "[http://www.economist.com/science/tq/ Technology Quarterly]," a special section focusing on recent trends and developments in science and technology.

Since July 2007,<ref>{{cite web |last=Allen |first=Katie |date=July 11, 2007 |url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2124016,00.html |title=Economist launches audio magazine |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |accessdate=2007-08-16 }}</ref> there has also been a complete [http://www.economist.com/audioedition/ audio edition] of the magazine available 5pm London time on Fridays, the day after the print magazine's publication.

== Criticism ==

Competitors have a stereotype of ''Economist'' writers as hacks: overconfident young graduates of elite English universities who lack originality.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/aug/21/pressandpublishing.business1 |title=Economist thrives on female intuition |date=2005-08-21 |work=[[The Observer]]}}</ref> 
[[James Fallows]] argued that the newspaper suffers from British class snobbery, pretentiousness, and simplistic argumentation--and that the editorial line is often contradicted by actual news stories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/1991/10/the_economics_of_the_colonial_cringe_about_the_economist_magazine_washington_post_1991.php |title=The Economics of the Colonial Cringe: Pseudonomics and the Sneer on the Face of The Economist.|accessdate=2008-04-27 |format= |work=Washington Post}}</ref> [[Andrew Sullivan]] complained that it uses “marketing genius” to make up for deficiencies in analysis and original reporting, resulting in “a kind of [[Reader's Digest]]”<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3874750,00.html |title=Not so groovy.|accessdate=2008-04-27 |format= |work=The New Republic}}</ref> for America’s corporate elite.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news1999/july99/news4707.html|title= Nasty barbs fly between New Republic and Economist.|accessdate=2008-04-27 |format= |work=Media Life}}</ref> (though criticism in the same 1999 article regarding as-yet-unfulfilled pronouncements by ''The Economist'' that the American stock market was overvalued was proven wrong a few months later when the [[Internet bubble]] burst.)  He also said that ''The Economist'' is editorially constrained because so many scribes graduated from the same school, [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /> [[The Observer]]'s Stefan Stern wrote that "its writers rarely see a political or economic problem that cannot be solved by the trusted three-card trick of privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation."<ref name="autogenerated2" /> 

In addition, ''[[Newsweek]]'' editor Jon Meacham, although he still described himself as a "fan", remarked that "''The Economist'' doesn’t even attempt to do original reporting."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.observer.com/node/39374 |title=Jon Meacham Wants Newsweek to Be More Like Hayes' Esquire.|accessdate=2008-04-27 |format= |work=New York Observer}}</ref> Elsewhere, the publication is said to have an “omniscient tone and pedantry." <ref>Humphrey Greddon in ''Spy'', cited by Fallows, op cit.</ref> Editorial anonymity, said by the editor to reflect “a collaborative effort,”<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minnpost.com/stories/2008/04/29/1659/economist_editor_micklethwait_brings_his_global_perspective_to_the_twin_cities |title= Economist Editor Micklethwait brings his global perspective to the Twin Cities|accessdate=2008-09-16 |date= April 29, 2008|format= |work=MinnPost.com}}</ref> is said to hide the youth and inexperience of those writing articles. "The magazine is written by young people pretending to be old people," according to [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]].<ref> Michael Lewis, the author of "Liar's Poker," in Fallows, op. cit.</ref> “If American readers got a look at the pimply complexions of their economic gurus, they would cancel their subscriptions in droves."

The [[Socialist Party (UK)]] described it as a "mouthpiece of world financial capital".<ref>[http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/2001/187/index.htm 2001 - a year of Workers' reawakening],'' The Socialist'', January 5, 2001</ref>
