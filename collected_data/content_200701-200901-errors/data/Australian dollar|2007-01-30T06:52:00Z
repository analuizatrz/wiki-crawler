The '''Australian dollar''' ([[currency code]] '''AUD''') has been, since  14th February 1966, the [[currency]] of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]], including [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], and [[Norfolk Island]], as well as the independent [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Island state]]s of [[Kiribati]], [[Nauru]] and [[Tuvalu]]. It is normally abbreviated with the [[dollar sign]] $. Alternatively '''A$''' or '''$A''', '''$AU''' or '''AU$''' is used to distinguish it from other [[dollar]]-denominated currencies. It is sometimes affectionately called the "Aussie battler"; during a low period (relative to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]) around 2001 and 2002 the currency was sometimes locally called the "Pacific Peso". It is divided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cent]]s.

The Australian dollar is currently the sixth-most-traded currency in world [[exchange rate|foreign exchange markets]] (behind the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]], the [[euro]], the [[yen]], the [[Pound sterling]], and the [[Swiss franc]]), accounting for approximately 4–5% of worldwide foreign exchange transactions. The Australian dollar is popular with currency traders due to the relative lack of government intervention in the foreign exchange market, the general stability of the economy and government as well as the prevailing view that it offers diversification benefits in a portfolio containing the major world currencies (especially because of its greater exposure to Asian economies and the commodities cycle).

==History==
The Australian dollar was introduced on [[14 February]] [[1966]], not only replacing the [[Australian pound]] (long since distinct from the [[pound sterling]]), but also introducing a [[decimalisation|decimal system]].  

<big> '''The Royal''' </big>

In 1965 the [[Prime Minister]] at the time, [[Robert Menzies]] wished to name the currency "The Royal", and other names such as "the Austral", "The Oz", "The Boomer", "The Roo", "The Kanga", "The Emu", "The Digger", "The Kwid" and "Ming" (the nickname of  Menzies) were also proposed. Due to Menzies' influence, the name "Royal" was settled upon, and trial designs were prepared and printed by the printing works of the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]]. The unusual choice of name for the currency proved unpopular, and it was later shelved in favour of "dollar".

[[Image:20royalsfront.jpg|thumb|a twenty-Royal note]]

On [[14 February]] [[1966]] the Australian dollar was introduced at a rate of two dollars per pound, or ten [[shilling]]s per dollar.

In 1967 the Australian dollar effectively left the sterling area for the first time. When sterling devalued in 1967 against the U.S. dollar, the new Australian dollar did not follow. It maintained its peg to the U.S. dollar at the same rate.

==Coins==
[[Image:Oz20cent.jpg|thumb|200px|Australian twenty-cent coin]]
{{main|Australian coins}} 
All [[coin]]s portray Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] on the obverse and are produced by the [[Royal Australian Mint]]. 

The one and two-cent coins were discontinued in 1990-91 and withdrawn from circulation.  [[Cash]] transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents, or rounded down at the option of the retailer. In commemoration of the 40th anniversary of [[decimal currency]], the 2006 mint [[Proof coinage|Proof]] and [[Coin grading|Uncirculated]] sets include 1 and 2 cent coins. As with most public changes to currency systems, there has been a great amount of [[seignorage]] of these discontinued coins, meaning the vast majority are never going to be worth a significant amount of money.

Australia has long issued commemorative 50 cent coins as a follow up to the commemorative crowns used prior to decimal currency. The first commemorative 50 cent coin was in 1970, commemorating [[Captain Cook]]'s exploration along the east coast of the Australian contintent, followed in 1977 by a coin for [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]], the wedding of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]] in 1981, [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1982 and the [[Australian Bicentenary]] in 1988. Issues expanded into greater numbers in the [[1990s]] and the [[21st century]], responding to collector demand.

Australia has also made special issues of 20 cent, 50 cent and $1 coins.

There are also many Australian five dollar coins of [[aluminium]]/[[bronze]] and [[bimetal|bi-metal]] as well as  many [[silver]] and [[gold]] [[bullion]] coins in higher denominations. These, like the U.S coins of higher denomination than 1 dollar or which are made of precious metals, are not normally used in payment but are still [[legal tender]].

The first paper issues of Australian dollars, issued in 1966, featured portraits of the following persons:

The $5 note was not issued until 1967. The $1 (10/-,) $2 (£1,) $10 (£5,) and $20 (£10) had exact exchange rates with pounds, but the $5 (£2/10) did not, and so was introduced after the public had become familiar with decimal currency. The one dollar note was replaced by a coin in 1984, while the two dollar note was replaced by a coin in 1988. The $100 note was introduced in 1984, in response to inflation requiring a larger denomination for transactions.

===Polymer series===
[[Image:Australian $10 note 1988.jpg|thumb|The first polymer banknote, the 1988 Australian $10 note]]
In 1988, the Reserve Bank of Australia issued [[plastic]], specifically [[polypropylene]] [[polymer banknotes]] (which were produced by [[Note Printing Australia]]), to commemorate the bicentenary of European settlement in Australia. These notes contained a transparent "window" with an optically variable image of [[Captain James Cook]] as a security feature. Australian banknotes were the first in the world to use such features. 

Despite initial difficulties, the Reserve Bank saw potential in the issue of plastic banknotes and commenced preparations for an entirely new series made from [[polymer]], commencing with the $5 note in 1992. In 1995, the design of the $5 note was updated to match the rest of the New Note Series, with additional slight changes in 1996. In 2001, a special commemorative $5 note was produced, but in 2002, the previous version's production commenced again.

In 2002, the design of all notes (except for the $5 note picturing the Queen) were slightly changed to include the names of the people pictured on them under the portraits, and swapping the order of the signatures of officials on the notes.

Today all Australian notes are made of polymer.

==Value of the Australian dollar==

In 2001, the value of one Australian dollar went below 50 US cents for the first time. As of January 2007, the Australian dollar was worth 77 US cents. 

In 1966 when the Australian dollar was introduced, the International [[gold standard]] still operated. The Australian dollar was at that time worth 980 milligrams of gold. As of December 2006 the Australian dollar was worth 38 milligrams of gold.[http://www.dgcsc.org/goldprices.htm]

==Exchange rate policies==

Australia maintained a [[Fixed exchange rate|peg]] to the British pound reflecting its historical ties as well as a view about the stability in value of the British pound. From 1946 to 1971 Australia maintained a peg to the U.S. dollar under the [[Bretton Woods system]], but it was effectively pegged to sterling until 1967. With the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, Australia converted the mostly-fixed peg to a moving peg against the U.S. dollar. In September 1974 Australia moved to a peg against a basket of currencies called the TWI ([[trade weighted index]]) in an effort to reduce fluctuations associated with its peg to the U.S. dollar. The peg to the TWI was changed to a moving peg in November 1976, causing the actual value of the peg to be periodically adjusted. In December 1983, the  [[Australian Labor Party|Australian Labor]] [[government of Australia|government]] led by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Paul Keating]] "[[Floating exchange rate|floated]]" the Australian dollar. From that point, movements in the Australian dollar continued to reflect the strength of its terms of trade. For decades Australia's reliance upon commodity (mineral and farm) exports has seen the Australian dollar rally during global booms, and fall when mineral prices slumped or when domestic spending overshadowed its export earnings outlook. The currency's high volatility, currency exposure and interest swap has made the AUD one of the most traded currencies in the world, far in excess of the economy's importance (2% of global economic activity).
