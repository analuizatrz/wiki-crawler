'''Oleh Lysheha''' ({{lang-uk|Олег Лишега}}) is a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[poet]], [[playwright]], [[translator]] and [[intellectual]].  Lysheha entered [[Lviv University]] in 1968, where during his last year, the poet was expelled for his participation in an "unofficial" literary circle, [[Lviv Bohema]].  As punishment, Lysheha was drafted into the [[Red Army|Soviet army]] and internally exiled.  During the period 1972-1988, he was banned from official publication, at the end of which his first book "Great Bridge" (''Velykyi Mist'') was published.   For "The Selected Poems of Oleh Lysheha," Lysheha and his co-translator James Brasfield from [[Penn State University]], received the [[PEN Award for Poetry in Translation|2000 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation]] published by the [[Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute]].  Lysheha is the first Ukrainian poet to receive the PEN award.  

== Life ==
Oleh Lysheha was born in 1949 to a family of teachers in [[Tysmenytsia]], a [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] village in [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]], [[Ukraine]].<ref name=piw>Bondar, Anriy.  [http://ukraine.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=5525 Oleh Lysheha]. ''Ukraine - Poetry International Web''. Accessed 7 June 2007.</ref>  Twenty years later, Lysheha became a student studying foreign languages at the university in [[Lviv]] named after the renowned Ukrainian poet [[Ivan Franko]].  In 1972, Lysheha was expelled and drafted to the Soviet army for membership in ''Lviv Bohema'', a dissident group of artists at Lviv University.  After serving in the military, the poet returned to his birth place, working at a local factory.<ref name=upij>Dibrova, Volodymyr.

In due time, Lysheha returned to Lviv, and soon thereafter moved to [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv'') where he married. In his position as a technical employee <!-- техпрацівник; a better translation is welcome --> at the [[Kyiv Theatrical Institute of Karpenko Karyi]], Lysheha continued to write poems and translate.  From 1997-1998, Oleh Lyshaha was a Visiting [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholar]] to Penn State in [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].<ref>[http://www.cies.org/Press_Release/PR_pen.htm Fulbrighters Win PEN Award]. Published: 25 March 2002.  Accessed: 7 June 2007.</ref>  After his return to Ukraine, the poet dove into a prolific artistic labor of poetry, painting and sculpture, as well as resumed his seasonal alteration between the capital and his birth home in the Carpathian mountains.<ref name=upij/>

Andriy Bondar describes Lysheha as the Ukrainian [[Henry Thoreau]] of the beginning of the 21st century:<ref name=piw/>  {{cquote|The way of life of ordinary people does not seem to apply to him.  He exists in a parallel universe - he likes to walk barefoot in the city, to swim in the ice-cold river in winter, he catches fish with his teeth, knows how to make paper from mushrooms, never uses public transport, and does not have a job.}}

== Poems and translations==
At the age of forty years old, Oleh Lysheha published his first collection of poems - "Great Bridge" (1989) - placing him at the forefront of the Ukrainian poetic community.  Years later, after meeting his future co-translator James Brasfield, Lysheha published "The Selected Poems of Oleh Lysheha" (1999) making his work available for the first time to the English reader.  A masterpiece of Ukrainian drama is Oleh Lysheha's miracle play "Friend Li Po, Brother Tu Fu" included in the second section of the 1999 English publication.  Thirteen years after his first work, Lysheha published "To Snow and Fire" (2002).<ref name=upij/>  

Another artistic corner of Lysheha's contributions lies in the translation field.  He has translated into the [[Ukrainian language]] works by [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ethra Pound]].  Lysheha is also the co-author of a book of translations from Chinese, "The Stories of Ancient China."

=== The Selected Poems of Oleh Lysheha (1999)===
Literary reviewers have written that "The Selected Poems of Oleh Lysheha" - the English translations of Lysheha - have nothing in common with the Ukrainian poetic tradition.  As Bondar, for example, notes the poetry is "influenced by natural philosophy, shamanistic meditation, total denial of a technocratic world, and escapism."<ref name=piw/>  Lyshaha's publisher [[Harvard University Press]] describes the poet's work as "informed by transcendentalism and [[Zen|Zen-like]] introspection, with meditations on the essence of the human experience and man's place in nature."<ref>[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/LYSCOL.html The Selected Poetry of Oleh Lysheha] ''Harvard University Press''. Accessed:  7 June 2007.</ref>  

Whatever the style, Lysheha and Brasfield received the 2000 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation. A presentation of the award was held May 15 at the Walter Reade Theater at [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[New York City]].<ref>[http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/2001/010127.shtml 2000: THE YEAR IN REVIEW:  A look at the cultural scene: from art to the theater]. ''[[Ukrainian Weekly]]''.  Accessed: 7 June 2007.</ref>  The poems were selected by Lysheha himself and follow the trajectory of his career.  The book is divided into three parts.  Section one holds shorter poems.  Section two "is a witty, brief, three-act play mostly in prose, ''Friend Li Po, Brother Tu Fu''."<ref>Kates, J. "Reviewed Works:  ''The Selected Poems of Oleh Lysheha'' by Oleh Lysheha; James Brasfield."  ''The Slavic and East European Journal'', Vol. 45, No. 3. pp. 550-551.</ref>  The third section consists of longer and more discursive narrative poems.

After dining in the moonlight,<br>
He sorted the bones —<br>
The small and the larger separated accurately<br>
On ground that was still warm —<br>
What if someone should come along and decide<br>
To carve a hole in one<br>
| &nbsp;
|
And make a flute..<br>
To greet the dawn..<br>
Otherwise things were the same —<br>
The wild garlic was growing darker, the blackberries were filling out..<br>
And his paw was still strong enough,<br>
To protect the night..
