The '''Battle of Waddams Grove''', also known as the '''Battle of Yellow Creek''', took place in present-day [[Stephenson County, Illinois]] during the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. After several incident of Sauk raids on settlers along the [[Apple River (Illinois)|Apple River]], Captain [[James Stephenson]] left [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]] with a group of volunteer militia in pursuit of the Native party. The group clashed on [[June 18]], [[1832]] near the Yellow Creek and the ensuing battle descended into a bayonet and knife fight in which several [[Sauk]] and three militia men were killed. Stephenson was severely wounded by a musketball to the chest during the fighting. The dead were eventually interred in a memorial cemetery in [[Kellogg's Grove, Illinois]] where a stone monument was erected in memory of those killed during the war.

==Prelude==
On [[June 9]], [[1832]], between the murders that occurred at [[Fort Blue Mounds]], a party of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] crossed over from the west side of the [[Mississippi River]] near [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]]. The group continued up the [[Apple River (Illinois)|Apple River]], looting and stealing horses along the way, including an incident about Â¾ of the way up the Apple River in which about a dozen horses were stolen from a small [[stockade]].<ref name=trask/> The Sauk raiding parties were mostly stealing food and supplies for Black Hawk's band of 1,000 men, women and children which were camped in the marshes of southwestern Wisconsin.<ref name=wisc>"[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/diary/002869.asp James Stephenson Describes the Battle at Yellow Creek], Historic Diaries: The Black Hawk War, ''Wisconsin Historical Society''. Retrieved [[31 July]] [[2007]].</ref> A similar incident a few days later, though without injury or death, prompted a reaction from the white [[militia]] in the area. 
 
Rising anxiety levels in the settler caused Captain [[James W. Stephenson]] to gather 12 volunteers and head toward the area of the disturbances from Galena. Stephenson recruited more men at [[Apple River Fort]] and headed eastward.<ref name=trask>Trask, Kerry A.

Stephenson caught up with the band of Native Americans on [[June 18]], [[1832]] in an open area near [[Yellow Creek (Illinois)|Yellow Creek]], about 12 miles east of [[Kellogg's Grove, Illinois]].<ref name=nrhp/><ref name=trask/><ref name=carter>Carter, Greg. "[http://www.geocities.com/old_lead/waddam.htm Captain Stephenson's Fight]," May 2004, ''Old Lead Historical Society''. Retrieved [[31 July]] [[2007]].</ref> Initially the militia could not get a clear shot at the Natives as they rushed into the cover of a woodline near the creek while the militia men observed from what was likely West Point Hill.<ref name=trask/><ref name=carter/>

Shots rang out from Stephenson's men but the Sauk did not return fire immediately and the fight descended into a [[bayonet]] and knife battle.<ref name=trask/><ref name=carter/> The militia charged into the thicket and the Sauk returned fire, Stephen P. Howard was killed in the volley. The force made two more charges into the thicket during which one Thomas Sublette stabbed a Sauk in the neck and George Eames was [[killed in action]]. The third charge resulted in Stephenson's severe wounds and the death of another militia man Michael Lovell.<ref name=carter/> According to Stephenson's account of the battle five or six Native American warriors were killed and the militia lost three men. Stephenson was wounded in the engagement, having been shot in the chest with a [[musket|musketball]].<ref name=trask/>

The Native forces outnumbered Stephenson's militia men and the group was forced to withdraw and [[retreat]]. When they left they took with them most of the horses that the Native group had stolen in their journey up the Apple River.<ref name=trask/>

==Aftermath==
Besides allowing the militia men to draw Native American blood in revenge, the result of the battle was inconsequential concerning its original purpose, stopping the Native American raids in the area.<ref name=trask/> The men of the militia returned triumphantly to Galena bearing the [[scalping|scalps]] of two of the warriors they had slain.<ref name=trask/> One thing the battle did accomplish was to redeem the militia in the eyes of the population.<ref name=wisc/> After the disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Stillman's Run|Stillman's Run]] in May, the battle at Yellow Creek coupled with the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1832)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]], helped prove that the militia could stand up to and defeat Black Hawk's warriors.<ref name=wisc/>

The militia men killed in the Battle of Waddams Grove were eventually interred in a memorial cemetery in Kellogg's Grove. The graves are located beneath a large stone monument dedicated to those militia killed during the [[Black Hawk War]].<ref name=nrhp>Dameier, Evelyn.
