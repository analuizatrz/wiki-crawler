At the turn of the [[21st century]], the '''definition of "[[planet]]"''' became the subject of intense debate. Although the word itself dates back  millennia, it had never had a formal definition until, beginning in 2005, a confluence of circumstances forced the astronomical community to take action.

From the end of the 19th century, "planet" had, without being defined, settled into a comfortable working term. It only applied to objects in the [[Solar System]]; a number small enough that any differences could be dealt with on an individual basis. After 1992 however, astronomers began to discover many additional objects beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]], as well as hundreds of objects [[extrasolar planet|orbiting other stars]]. These discoveries not only increased the number of potential planets, but also expanded their variety and peculiarity. Some were nearly large enough to be [[star]]s, while others were smaller than [[moon|Earth's moon]]. These discoveries challenged long perceived notions of what a planet could be.

The issue of a clear definition for "planet" came to a head in 2005 with the discovery of the [[trans-Neptunian object]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a body larger than the smallest then-accepted planet, [[Pluto]]. In its 2006 response, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), recognised by astronomers as the world body responsible for resolving issues of nomenclature, released its [[2006 redefinition of planet|decision]] on the matter. This definition, which applies only to the Solar System, states that a planet is a body that orbits the [[Sun]], is large enough for its own gravity to make it round, and has "[[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared its neighbourhood]]" of smaller objects.  

Pluto does not qualify as a planet under this definition, and the Solar System is thus considered to have eight planets: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]. The new category of [[dwarf planet]] was created, currently including [[Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. The IAU's decision has not resolved all controversies, however, and some in the astronomical community have rejected it outright. The issue of what constitutes a planet will likely remain contentious at least until 2009, when the IAU holds its next Congress in [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>

==History==

[[Image:Cellarius ptolemaic system c2.jpg|thumb|The planets as understood before the acceptance of the [[heliocentric model]].]]
The word "planet" has meant many different things in its long life, often simultaneously. Throughout its history, use of the term was never strict and its meaning has twisted and blurred to include or exclude a variety of different objects.   

While knowledge of the planets likely predates history, the word "planet" itself dates to [[ancient Greece]]. The Greeks, like all ancient civilisations, believed the Earth to be stationary and at the centre of the universe in accordance with the [[geocentric model]], and that the objects in the sky, and indeed the sky itself, revolved around it. Greek astronomers employed the term ''asteres planetai'', "wandering stars",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/planet|title=Definition of planet|publisher=Merriam-Webster OnLine|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordsources.info/words-mod-planets.html|title=Words For Our Modern Age: Especially words derived from Latin and Greek sources|publisher=Wordsources.info|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref> to describe those starlike lights in the heavens that moved over the course of the year, in contrast to the ''asteres aplanis'', the "fixed stars", which stayed motionless relative to one another. The five bodies currently called "planets" that were known to the Greeks are [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. 

===Planets in antiquity===
[[Image:Platon-2.jpg|thumb|100 px|The philosopher [[Plato]]]]

Graeco-Roman cosmology is commonly thought to have consisted of seven planets, with the Sun and the Moon counted among them (as is the case in modern [[Planets in astrology|astrology]]); however, there is some ambiguity on that point: while many ancient astronomers contended that the [[cosmos]] comprised seven planets, others refer to five planets, with the Sun and Moon as separate. As the 19th century German naturalist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] noted in his work ''Cosmos,'' 

<blockquote>Of the seven cosmical bodies which, by their continually varying relative positions and distances apart, have ever since the remotest antiquity been distinguished from the "unwandering orbs" of the heaven of the "fixed stars", which to all sensible appearance preserve their relative positions and distances unchanged, five only -Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn- wear the appearance of stars- "''cinque stellas errantes''"- while the Sun and Moon, from the size of their disks, their importance to man, and the place assigned to them in mythological systems, were classed apart."<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosmos: A Sketch of a Physical Description of the Universe|author=Alexander von Humboldt|year=1849|work=digitised 2006|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3CEJAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref></blockquote>

In his ''[[Timaeus]]'', written in roughly 360 BC, [[Plato]] mentions, "the Sun and Moon and five other stars, which are called the planets".<ref>{{cite web|title=Timaeus by Plato|work=The Internet Classics|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.html|accessdate= 2007-02-22}}</ref> His student [[Aristotle]] makes a similar distinction in his ''[[On the Heavens]]'': "The movements of the sun and moon are fewer than those of some of the planets".<ref>{{cite web|title=On the Heavens by Aristotle, Translated by J.

===Planets in the Middle Ages===
[[Image:Nikolaus Kopernikus.jpg|thumb|100px|Copernicus]]
Later medieval and Renaissance writers appear to have accepted the idea of seven planets. In his ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'', [[14th century]] poet [[John Gower]], referring to the planets' connection with the craft of [[Classical planets in Western alchemy|alchemy]], writes, "Of the planetes ben begonne/The gold is tilted to the Sonne/The Mone of Selver hath his part...", indicating that the Sun and the Moon were planets.<ref>{{cite journal|author=P. Heather|title=The Seven Planets|Journal=Folklore|year=1943|pages=338–361}}</ref> Even [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who rejected the geocentric model, was ambivalent concerning whether the Sun and Moon were planets. In his ''[[De Revolutionibus]]'', Copernicus clearly separates "the sun, moon, planets and stars";<ref>{{cite web|title=The text of Nicholas Copernicus' De Revolutionibus (On the Revolutions), 1543 C.E.|author=Edward Rosen (trans.)|work=Calendars Through the Ages|url=http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Copernicus.html|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> however, in his Dedication of the work to Pope Paul III, Copernicus refers to, "the motion of the sun and the moon... and of the five other planets."<ref>{{cite web|title=Dedication of the Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies to Pope Paul III|author=Nicholas Copernicus|work=The Harvard Classics.  1909–14|url=http://www.bartleby.com/39/12.html|accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>

===Modern planets===
[[Image:William Herschel01.jpg|thumb|100px|William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus]]
Eventually, when Copernicus's [[heliocentric model]] was accepted over the [[geocentric]], Earth was placed among the planets and the Sun was dropped. It could be said, therefore, that Earth was the first planet of the modern era. 

In 1781, the astronomer [[William Herschel]] was searching the sky for elusive [[stellar parallax]]es, when he observed what he termed a [[comet]] in the constellation of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. Unlike stars, which remained mere points of light even under high magnification, this object's size increased in proportion to the power used. That this strange object might have been a planet simply did not occur to Herschel; the five planets beyond Earth had been part of humanity's conception of the universe since antiquity. However, unlike a comet, this object's orbit was nearly circular and within the ecliptic plane. Before Herschel announced his discovery of his "comet", his colleague, British [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Nevil Maskelyne]], wrote to him, saying, "I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it."<ref>{{cite book|title=William Herschel: Astronomer and Musician of 19 New King Street, Bath|author=Patrick Moore|publisher=PME Erwood|year=1981|pages=8}}</ref> The "comet" was also very far away, too far away for a mere comet to resolve itself. Eventually it was recognised as the seventh planet and named [[Uranus]] after the father of Saturn.

Gravitationally induced irregularities in Uranus's observed orbit led eventually to the discovery of [[Neptune]] in 1846, and presumed  irregularities in Neptune's orbit subsequently led to the search which ultimately located [[Pluto]] in 1930. Initially believed to be roughly the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto's estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune's orbit at all.<ref>

===Satellites===
[[Image:Christiaan Huygens-painting.jpeg|thumb|100px|Christian Huygens, discoverer of Titan]]
When Copernicus placed the Earth among the planets, he also placed the Moon in orbit around the Earth, making the Moon the first [[natural satellite]] to be discovered. When [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] discovered his four [[Galilean moons|satellites]] of Jupiter in 1610, they lent weight to Copernicus's argument, since if other planets could have satellites, then the Earth could too. However, there remained some confusion as to whether these objects were "planets"; Galileo initially intended to name them the "Medicean planets", in honour of his patrons, the [[Medicis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Discovery of the Galilean Satellites|work=solarviews.com|url=http://www.solarviews.com/eng/galdisc.htm|year=2001|accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref> Similarly, [[Christiaan Huygens]], upon discovering Saturn's largest moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] in 1655, employed many terms to describe it, including "planeta", (planet) "stella" (star) "Luna" (moon), and the more modern "satellite".<ref>{{cite book|title=Systema Saturnium: Sive de Causis Miradorum Saturni Phaenomenon, et comite ejus Planeta Novo|author= Christiani Hugenii (Christiaan Huygens)|publisher=Adriani Vlacq|year= 1659|pages= 1–50}}</ref> [[Giovanni Cassini]], in announcing his discovery of Saturn's moons [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] and [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] in 1671 and 1672, described them as ''Nouvelles Planetes autour de Saturne'' ("New planets around Saturn").<ref>{{cite book|title=Decouverte de deux Nouvelles Planetes autour de Saturne|author=Giovanni Cassini|Publisher=Sabastien Mabre-Craniusy|year= 1673| pages=6–14}}</ref>  However, when the "Journal de Scavans" reported Cassini's discovery of two new Saturnian moons in 1686, it referred to them strictly as "satellites".<ref>{{cite web|title=An Extract of the Journal Des Scavans. of April 22 st.

===Minor planets===
[[Image:Giuseppe Piazzi.jpg|thumb|100px|Giuseppe Piazzi, discoverer of Ceres]]
One of the unexpected results of [[William Herschel|William Herschel's]] discovery of Uranus was that it appeared to validate [[Bode's law]], a mathematical function which generates the size of the [[semimajor axis]] of planetary [[orbit]]s. Astronomers had considered the "law" a meaningless coincidence, but Uranus fell at very nearly the exact distance it predicted. Since Bode's law also predicted a body between Mars and Jupiter that at that point had not been observed, astronomers turned their attention to that region in the hope that it might be vindicated again. Finally, in 1801, astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] found a miniature new world, [[1 Ceres|Ceres]], lying at just the correct point in space. The object was hailed as a new planet.<ref name="Ceres">{{cite web | author=Hilton, James L. | title=When did asteroids become minor planets? | work=U.S. Naval Observatory | url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/AsteroidHistory/minorplanets.html | accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref> 

Then in 1802, [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]] discovered [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], a second "planet" at roughly the same distance from the Sun as Ceres. That two planets could occupy the same orbit was an affront to centuries of thinking; even [[Shakespeare]] had ridiculed the idea ("Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere").<ref>{{cite book|title=King Henry the Fourth Part One in  The Globe Illustrated Shakespeare: The Complete Works Annotated|author=William Shakespeare|publisher=Granercy Books|year= 1979|page= 559}}</ref> In 1804, another world, [[3 Juno|Juno]], was discovered in a similar orbit.<ref name="Ceres" /> In 1807, Olbers discovered a fourth object, [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], at a similar orbital distance.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}

Herschel suggested that these four worlds be given their own separate classification, [[asteroid]]s (meaning "starlike" since they were too small for their disks to resolve and thus resembled [[star]]s), though most astronomers preferred to refer to them as planets. This conception was entrenched by the fact that, due to the difficulty of distinguishing asteroids from yet-uncharted stars, those four remained the only asteroids known until 1845.<ref name=police>{{cite journal|title=Call the Police! The story behind the discovery of the asteroids|journal=Astronomy Now|first=Keith|last= Cooper|pages=60–61|volume=21|issue=6|date=June 2007}}</ref> Science textbooks in 1828, after Herschel's death, still numbered the asteroids among the planets. With the arrival of more refined star charts, the search for asteroids resumed, and a fifth and sixth were discovered by [[Karl Ludwig Hencke]] in 1845 and 1847.<ref name=police /> By 1851 the number of asteroids had increased to 15, and a new method of classifying them, by affixing a number before their names in order of discovery, was adopted, inadvertently placing them in their own distinct category. Ceres became "(1) Ceres", Pallas became "(2) Pallas", and so on. By the 1860s, the number of known asteroids had increased to over a hundred, and observatories in Europe and the United States began referring to them collectively as "[[minor planet]]s", or "small planets", though it took the first four asteroids longer to be grouped as such.<ref name="Ceres" /> To this day, "minor planet" remains the official designation for all small bodies in orbit around the Sun (whether asteroid or not), and each new discovery is numbered accordingly in the IAU's [[Minor Planet Catalogue]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The MPC Orbit (MPCORB) Database|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/MPCORB.html|accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref>

===Pluto===
[[Image:Clyde Tombaugh image.jpg|thumb|C100px|Clyde Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto]]
The long road from planethood to reconsideration undergone by Ceres is mirrored in the story of [[Pluto]], which was named a planet soon after its discovery by [[Clyde Tombaugh]] in 1930. Uranus and Neptune had been declared planets based on their circular orbits, large masses and proximity to the ecliptic plane. None of these applied to Pluto; a tiny, icy world in a region of [[gas giant]]s with an orbit that carried it high above the [[ecliptic]] and even inside that of Neptune. In 1978, astronomers discovered its largest moon, [[Charon (moon)|Charon]]. This allowed astronomers to determine Pluto's size. It was found to be much tinier than expected, smaller even than the Earth's Moon.  However, it was, as far as anyone could tell, unique. Then, beginning in 1992, astronomers began to detect large numbers of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune that were similar in composition and size to Pluto. They concluded that they had discovered the long-hypothesised [[Kuiper belt]] (sometimes called the [[Edgeworth-Kuiper belt]]), a band of icy debris that is the source for "short-period" comets&mdash;those with orbital periods of up to 200 years.<ref>{{cite web | author=Weissman, Paul R. | title=The Kuiper Belt| work=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ARA&A..33..327W
| accessdate=2006-10-04}}</ref>

Pluto's orbit lay right in the middle of this band and thus its planetary status was thrown into question; the precedent set by Ceres in downgrading an object from planet status because of a shared orbit led many to conclude that Pluto must be reclassified as a minor planet as well. [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]] suggested that a "planet" should be redefined as "any body in the Solar System that is more massive than the total mass of all of the other bodies in a similar orbit."<ref>{{cite web | author=Brown, Mike. | title=A World on the Edge | work=[[NASA]] Solar System Exploration | url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=105 | accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref> The eight planets over that mass limit would be referred to as "major planets". There was outcry at the prospect of Pluto's "demotion", and in 1999 the [[International Astronomical Union]] clarified that it was not at that time proposing to change Pluto's status as a planet.<ref>{{cite web | year=1999 | title=The Status of Pluto:A clarification | work=[[International Astronomical Union]], Press release | url=http://www.iau.org/STATUS_OF_PLUTO.238.0.html | accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref><ref> {{cite web | year=1999 | author=Witzgall, Bonnie B. | title=Saving Planet Pluto | work= Amateur Astronomer article| url=http://www.asterism.org/newsletter/l9904-3.htm | accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref>

The discovery of several other [[trans-Neptunian object]]s approaching the size of Pluto, such as [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]] and [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], continued to erode arguments that Pluto was exceptional from the rest of the trans-Neptunian population. On [[July 29]], [[2005]], Mike Brown and his team announced the discovery of a trans-Neptunian object confirmed to be larger than Pluto,<ref>{{cite web | year=2006 | author=Brown, Mike | title=The discovery of 2003 UB313, the 10th planet.| work= California Institute of Technology| url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/ | accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref> named [[136199 Eris|Eris]].<ref> {{cite web | year=2005 | author=M.

In the immediate aftermath of the object's discovery, there was much discussion as to whether it could be termed a "[[tenth planet]]". NASA even put out a press release describing it as such.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA-Funded Scientists Discover Tenth Planet|work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news-print.cfm?release=2005-126| year=2005|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> However, acceptance of Eris as the tenth planet implicitly demanded a definition of planet that set Pluto as an arbitrary minimum size. Many astronomers, claiming that the definition of planet was of little scientific importance, preferred to recognise Pluto's historical identity as a planet by "[[grandfathering]]" it into the planet list.<ref>{{cite web|title=Topic - First Mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt; "From Darkness to Light: The Exploration of the Planet Pluto"|author=Dr. Bonnie Buratti|work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/events/lectures/nov05.cfm|year=2005|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>

{{main|2006 definition of planet}}
[[Image:NewSolarSystem2.jpg|thumb|The eight [[Planet]]s and three dwarf planets of the Solar System. ''(Sizes to scale.)'']]
The discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] forced the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] to act on a definition. In October 2005, a group of 19 IAU members, which had already been working on a definition since the discovery of [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]] in 2003, narrowed their choices to a shortlist of three, using [[approval voting]]. The definitions were:

* A planet is any object in [[orbit]] around the Sun with a diameter greater than 2000&nbsp;km. ''(eleven votes in favour)''
* A planet is any object in orbit around the Sun whose shape is stable due to its own gravity. ''(eight votes in favour)''
* A planet is any object in orbit around the Sun that is dominant in its immediate neighborhood.

Since no overall consensus could be reached, the committee decided to put these three definitions to a wider vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in [[Prague]] in August 2006,<ref>{{cite web| year=2006 | title=Planet Definition| work=IAU | url=http://www.astronomy2006.com/planet-definition.php| accessdate=2006-08-14}} </ref> and on [[August 24]], the IAU put a final draft to a vote, which combined elements from two of the three proposals.

The IAU further resolves:

On [[September 13]], [[2006]], the IAU placed Eris, its moon Dysnomia, and Pluto into their [[Minor Planet Catalogue]], giving them the official minor planet designations [[(134340) Pluto]], [[(136199) Eris]], and [[(136199) Eris I Dysnomia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Circular No. 8747|author=Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, International Astronomical Union|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/special/08747.pdf|year=2006|accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>

==Acceptance of the definition==
[[Image:Outersolarsystem objectpositions labels comp.png|thumb|400 px|Plot of the current positions of all known Kuiper belt objects, set against the outer planets]]
Among the most vocal proponents of the IAU's decided definition are [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], the discoverer of Eris, and [[Steven Soter]], professor of astrophysics at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. 

In an article in the [[January 2007]] issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', Soter cited the definition's incorporation of current theories of the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]]; that as the earliest [[protoplanet]]s emerged from the swirling dust of the [[protoplanetary disc]], some bodies "won" the initial competition for limited material and, as they grew, their increased gravity meant that they accumulated more material, and thus grew larger, eventually outstripping the other bodies in the Solar System by a very wide margin. The asteroid belt, disturbed by the gravitational tug of nearby Jupiter, and the Kuiper belt, too widely spaced for its constituent objects to collect together before the end of the initial formation period, both failed to win  the accretion competition. 

When the numbers for the winning objects are compared to those of the losers, the contrast  is quite striking; if we accept Soter's concept that each planet occupies an "orbital zone,"{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} then the least orbitally dominant planet, Mars, is larger than all other collected material in its orbital zone by a factor of 5100. Ceres, the largest asteroid, is only larger by a factor of 0.33; Pluto's ratio is even lower, at 0.07.<ref name=Soter>{{cite web|title=What is a Planet?|author= Steven Soter|work=Department of Astrophysics, American Museum of Natural History|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=93385350-E7F2-99DF-3FD6272BB4959038&pageNumber=2&catID=2|year=2007|accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref> Mike Brown asserts that this massive difference in orbital dominance leaves "absolutely no room for doubt about which objects do and do not belong."<ref name=Brown>{{cite web|title=The Eight Planets|author=Michael E. Brown|work=Caltech|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/eightplanets/|year=2006| accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref>

==Ongoing controversies==
Despite the IAU's declaration, a number of critics remain unconvinced. The definition is seen by many as arbitrary and confusing, and a number of [[Pluto]]-as-planet proponents, in particular [[Alan Stern]], head of [[NASA|NASA's]] [[New Horizons]] mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. His claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community.<ref>{{cite web | year=2006 | author=Robert Roy Britt| title=Pluto demoted in highly controversial definition| work= Space.com| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060824_planet_definition.html| accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | year=2006 | author=Robert Roy Britt| title=Pluto: Down But Maybe Not Out| work= Space.com| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060831_planet_definition.html| accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref> Even with this controversy excluded, there remain several ambiguities in the definition. 

===Clearing the neighborhood===
{{main|Clearing the neighborhood}}
One of the main points at issue is the precise meaning of "cleared the neighborhood around its [[orbit]]". [[Alan Stern]] recently objected that "it is impossible and contrived to put a dividing line between dwarf planets and planets,"<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Rincon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5283956.stm| title=Pluto vote 'hijacked' in revolt|work=BBC News|year=2006|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> and that since neither Earth, Mars, Jupiter, nor Neptune have entirely cleared their regions of debris, none could properly be considered planets under the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] definition.{{Ref_label|C|c|none}}
[[Image:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|thumb|The asteroids of the inner Solar System; note the [[Trojan asteroid]]s (green), trapped into Jupiter's orbit by its gravity]]
Mike Brown counters these claims by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control the orbits of the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist with a large number of small bodies in its orbit (the [[Trojan asteroid]]s), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called [[plutino]]s, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.<ref name=Brown />  

Whatever definition of "clearing the neighborhood" is ultimately accepted by the IAU, it is still an ambiguous concept. Mark Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona and organiser of the petition, explained the ambiguity to [[National Public Radio]]. Since the definition does not categorise a planet by composition or formation, but, effectively, by its location, a Mars-sized or larger object beyond the orbit of Pluto would be considered a dwarf planet, since it would not have time to clear its orbit and would therefore be surrounded by objects of similar mass, whereas an object smaller than Pluto orbiting in isolation would be considered a planet.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5788798| format=RealPlayer| title= Astronomers Prepare to Fight Pluto Demotion| first=Sykes| last=Mark| date=2006-09-08| accessdate=2006-10-04}} </ref>

===Hydrostatic equilibrium===
[[Image:Proteus (Voyager 2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]], the moon of [[Neptune]], is irregular, despite being larger than many spherical objects.]]
The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU's]] definition mandates that planets be large enough for their own [[gravity]] to form them into a state of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]; this means that they will reach a shape that is, if not spherical, then [[spheroid]]al. This distinction, as opposed to strict sphericity, is mandated by the fact that many large objects in the [[Solar System]], such as the planets Jupiter and Saturn, the moons [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] and [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], and the [[Kuiper belt object]] [[2003 EL61]],<ref> {{cite web| author= Brown, Michael E.| title=2003EL61| work= California Institute of Technology| url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/2003EL61| accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref> have been distorted into oblate or prolate spheroids by rapid rotation or [[tidal force]]s. 

However, there is no one point at which an object can be said to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium. As Soter noted in his article,"How are we to quantify the degree of roundness that distinguishes a planet? Does gravity dominate such a body if its shape deviates from a spheroid by 10 percent or by 1 percent? Nature provides no unoccupied gap between round and nonround shapes, so any boundary would be an arbitrary choice."<ref name=Soter /> Furthermore, objects made of ices,{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} such as Enceladus and Miranda, assume that state more easily than those made of rock, such as Vesta and Pallas.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dwarf Planets|author=Mike Brown|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets/|accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> Heat energy, from [[gravitational collapse]], [[impact event|impacts]], tidal forces, or [[radioactive decay]] also factors into whether an object will be spherical or not; Saturn's icy moon Mimas is spheroidal, but Neptune's larger moon Proteus, which is similarly composed but colder because of its greater distance from the Sun, is irregular.

===Double planets===
{{main|Double planet}}
[[Image:pluto and charon.jpg|thumb|A [[telescope|telescopic]] image of [[Pluto]] and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]].]]

The definition specifically excludes [[natural satellite|satellites]] from the category of dwarf planet, though it does not directly define the term "satellite". In the original draft proposal, an exception was made for [[Pluto]] and its largest satellite, [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], which possess a [[barycenter]]  outside the volume of either body. The initial proposal classified Pluto/Charon as a double planet, with the two objects orbiting the Sun in tandem. However, the final draft made clear that, double or not, both Pluto and Charon would be considered dwarf planets, not planets. 
	
Under the same definition, the Earth-[[Moon]] system is not formally recognized as a double planet, despite the Moon's large relative size, since the barycenter lies within the Earth. As the Moon is slowly [[Orbit of the Moon#Tidal evolution of the lunar orbit|receding from the Earth]], the Earth-Moon system may eventually become a double planet system on the basis of this barycentric definition.
 
Also, many moons, even those that do not orbit the Sun directly, often exhibit features in common with true planets. Jupiter's moon [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] are both larger in terms of diameter (though not mass) than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], and Titan even has a substantial atmosphere, thicker than the Earth's. Moons such as [[Io (moon)|Io]] and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] demonstrate obvious and ongoing geological activity, and Ganymede has a [[magnetic field]]. Just as [[star]]s in orbit around other stars are still referred to as stars, so some astronomers argue that objects in orbit around planets that share all their characteristics could also be called planets.<ref>{{cite book|author=Serge Brunier|title=Solar System Voyage|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|pages=160–165}}</ref> Indeed Mike Brown makes just such a claim in his dissection of the issue, noting that there is little case for describing an object 400&nbsp;km across with little internal geological activity as a planet if a&nbsp;5000 km object with methane lakes, [[cryovolcanism]] and storms (i.e. [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]) is called a moon.<ref name=Brown />

===Extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs===
{{main|Extrasolar planet|Brown dwarf}}
The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU's]] definition of planet applies only to objects within our own [[Solar System]]. The more than 200 extrasolar planets (planet-sized objects in [[orbit]] around other [[star]]s) were excluded as too complex an issue to be resolved during the congress. However, any future definition will need to include them, as their discovery has widened the debate on the nature of planethood in unexpected ways. Many of these planets are of considerable size, approaching the mass of small stars, while many newly-discovered brown dwarfs are conversely small enough to be considered planets.<ref>{{cite web| year=2006 | title=IAU General Assembly: Definition of Planet debate| url=http://astro2006.meta.mediastream.cz/Astro2006-060822-01.asx

[[Image:Brown Dwarf Gliese 229B.jpg|thumb|left|The brown dwarf [[Gliese 229B]] in orbit around its star.]]
Traditionally, the defining characteristic for starhood has been an object's ability to [[Nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[hydrogen]] in its core. However, stars such as brown dwarfs have always challenged that distinction. Too small to commence sustained hydrogen fusion, they have been granted star status on their ability to fuse [[deuterium]]. However, due to the relative rarity of that [[isotope]], this process lasts only a tiny fraction of the star's lifetime, and hence most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusion long before their discovery.<ref> {{cite web | author=Basri, Gibor | title=What is a planet?| work= Astronomy Dept., UC Berkeley| url=http://astron.berkeley.edu/~basri/defineplanet/whatsaplanet.htm | accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref> [[Binary star]]s and other multiple-star formations are common, and many brown dwarfs orbit other stars. Therefore, since they do not produce energy through fusion, they could be described as planets. Indeed, astronomer [[Adam Burrows (astronomer)|Adam Burrows]] of the [[University of Arizona]] claims that "from the theoretical perspective, however different their modes of formation, extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs are essentially the same."<ref>{{cite web | author=Burrows, Adam, Hubbard, W.B., Lunine, J., Leibert, James | year=2001 | title=The Theory of Brown Dwarfs and Extrasolar Giant Planets| work=Department of Astronomy and Steward Observatory, and Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, The University of Arizona| url=http://zenith.as.arizona.edu/~burrows/papers/rmp/RMP-final.pdf
| accessdate=2006-06-09}} </ref> Burrows also claims that such stellar remnents as [[white dwarfs]] should not be considered stars,<ref>Croswell p. 119</ref> a stance which would mean that an orbiting [[white dwarf]], such as [[Sirius B]] could be considered a planet. However, the current convention among astronomers is that any object massive enough to have possessed the capability to fuse during its lifetime should be considered a star.<ref> {{cite book | author=Croswell, Ken | year=1999 | title=Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems| publisher= Oxford University Press p. 119 (ISBN 0-19-288083-7)}}</ref>

The confusion does not end with brown dwarfs. Maria Rosa Zapatario-Osorio et al. have discovered many objects in young [[star cluster]]s of masses below that required to sustain fusion of any sort (currently calculated to be roughly 13 Jupiter masses).<ref> {{cite web |year= 2000| author= Zapatero M.

However, it is also possible that these "free floating planets" could have formed in the same manner as stars.<ref>{{cite web |year= 2000| title=Rogue planet find makes astronomers ponder theory| work=Reuters| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/space/10/06/space.planets.reut/| accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref>  The material difference between a low-mass star and a large [[gas giant]] is not clearcut; apart from size and relative temperature, there is little to separate a gas giant like Jupiter from its host star. Both have similar overall compositions: hydrogen and [[helium]], with trace levels of heavier [[chemical element|element]]s in their [[atmosphere]]s. The generally accepted difference is one of formation; stars are said to have formed from the "top down"; out of the gases in a nebula as they underwent gravitational collapse, and thus would be composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, while planets are said to have formed from the "bottom up"; from the accretion of dust and gas in orbit around the young star, and thus should have cores of [[silicate]]s or ices.<ref> {{cite web |year= 2004| author=G. Wuchterl| title=Giant planet formation| work=Institut für Astronomie der Universität Wien| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j6357423q7324013/| accessdate=2006-10-04}} </ref> As yet it is uncertain whether gas giants possess such cores. If it is indeed possible that a gas giant could form as a star does, then it raises the question of whether such an object, even one as familiar as Jupiter or Saturn, should be considered an orbiting low-mass star rather than a planet. 

In 2003, the IAU officially released a statement<ref>{{cite web |year= 2001| title=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets (WGESP) of the International Astronomical Union | work=[[IAU]]| url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html| accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref> to define what constitutes an extrasolar planet and what constitutes an orbiting star. To date, it remains the only official decision reached by the IAU on this issue.
{{cquote|
#Objects with [[true mass]]es below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 Jupiter masses for objects of solar metallicity) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are "planets" (no matter how they formed). The minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in our Solar System.
#Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "brown dwarfs", no matter how they formed nor where they are located.
#Free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "[[sub-brown dwarfs]]" (or whatever name is most appropriate).}}

[[Image:hubbledwarf.jpg|left|thumb|CHXR 73 b, a star which lies at the border between planet and brown dwarf]]
Like defining a planet by having [[clearing the neighborhood|cleared its neighbourhood]], this definition creates ambiguity by making location, rather than formation or composition, the determining characteristic for planethood. A free-floating object with a mass below 13 Jupiter masses is a "sub-brown dwarf," whereas such an object in orbit round a fusing star is a planet, even if, in all other respects, the two objects may be identical.

This ambiguity was highlighted in December 2005, when the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] observed [[Cha 110913-773444]] (above), the least massive brown dwarf yet found, only eight times Jupiter's mass with what appears to be the beginnings of its own [[star system]]. Were this object found in orbit round another star, it would have been termed a planet.<ref>{{cite web |year= 2005| author= Clavin, Whitney| title=A Planet With Planets?

| accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref> 

It was highlighted again in September 2006, when the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] imaged [[CHXR 73 b]] (left), an object orbiting a young companion star at a distance of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star suggests it could not have formed inside the small star's [[protoplanetary disc]], and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from gravitational collapse.<ref>{{cite web|title=Planet or failed star?

===Semantics===
Finally, from a purely linguistic point of view, there is the dichotomy that the IAU created between 'planet' and 'dwarf planet'. The term 'dwarf planet' arguably contains two words, a noun (planet) and an adjective (dwarf). Thus, the term could suggest that a dwarf planet is a type of planet, even though the IAU explicitly defines a dwarf planet as ''not'' so being. By this formulation therefore, 'dwarf planet' and 'minor planet' are best considered [[compound noun]]s. Benjamin Zimmer, of [http://www.languagelog.org languagelog.org], summarised the confusion: "The fact that the IAU would like us to think of dwarf planets as distinct from 'real' planets lumps the lexical item 'dwarf planet' in with such oddities as '[[Welsh rabbit]]' (not really a rabbit) and '[[Rocky Mountain oysters]]' (not really oysters)."<ref name=langlog>{{cite web|title=New planetary definition a "linguistic catastrophe"!| work=Language log| url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003504.html| accessdate=2006-10-04}}</ref> As [[Dava Sobel]], the historian and popular science writer who participated in the IAU's initial decision in October 2006, noted in an interview with [[National Public Radio]], "A dwarf planet is not a planet, and in astronomy, there are dwarf stars, which are stars, and dwarf galaxies, which are galaxies, so it's a term no one can love, dwarf planet."<ref>{{cite web|title=A Travel Guide to the Solar System|year=2006|work=National Public Radio|url=http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2006/Oct/hour2_102706.html|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref>  Mike Brown noted in an interview with the Smithsonian that, "Most of the people in the dynamical camp really did not want the word "dwarf planet," but that was forced through by the pro-Pluto camp. So you’re left with this ridiculous baggage of dwarf planets not being planets."<ref name=smithsonian>{{cite web|title=Pluto's Planethood: What Now?|work=Smithsonian Air and Space|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/issues/2006/august-september/FEATURE-PlutoDebate.php?page=1|year=2006|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref>

Conversely, astronomer Robert Cumming of the Stockholm Observatory notes that, "The name 'minor planet' been more or less synonymous with 'asteroid' for a very long time. So it seems to me pretty insane to complain about any ambiguity or risk for confusion with the introduction of 'dwarf planet'."<ref name=langlog />
