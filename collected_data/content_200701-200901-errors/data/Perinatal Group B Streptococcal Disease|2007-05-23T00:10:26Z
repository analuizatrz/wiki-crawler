'''Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease''' a leading infectious cause of [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] among [[newborn]]s.

[[Group B Streptococcus]] (GBS) bacteria can be passed from a [[pregnant]] woman who is a [[asymptomatic carrier|carrier]] of the [[bacteria]] to her baby during [[childbirth|labor]]. Since the bacteria can come and go, testing for GBS is needed every pregnancy. Toward the end of a pregnancy, the [[vagina]] and [[rectum]] are cultured with a [[swab]] at a [[prenatal]] appointment. Women with GBS are given an [[antibiotic]] during labor. [[Evidence]] based [[research]] studies show that using this test can reduce [[infant]] infections. <ref name=PreventPerinatalGBS> [http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5111a1.htm#tab2 U.S. Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease, CDC]</ref>
