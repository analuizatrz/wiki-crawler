'''Ahmet Mesut Yılmaz''' (born [[6 November]] [[1947]] in [[Istanbul]]) (graduated from [[İstanbul Lisesi]] in 1966) is the former leader of "Anavatan Partisi" (ANAP, the [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]]) and was the Turkish [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|prime minister]] in the [[1990s]].  

Mesut Yılmaz was a rising star in the Motherland Party of [[Turgut Özal]], representing the [[Black Sea]] province of [[Rize]] in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|parliament]] and serving as tourism minister in Ozal's cabinet.  Upon Özal's election to the presidency in [[1989]], Yılmaz became the leader of an intraparty opposition to the new Prime Minister, [[Yıldırım Akbulut]].  

[[Yılmaz]] managed to discharge [[Yıldırım Akbulut|Akbulut]] from  party leadership and from all executive functions during the [[biennial]] party congress in [[June]] [[1991]]. Because [[ANAP]] had the majority in the [[Turkish Parliament|parliament]] he subsequently became [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|Prime Minister of Turkey]].

The following years saw a decline in the popularity of the Motherland Party and an acrimonious relationship with [[Tansu Çiller]], leader of the center-right [[Dogru Yol Partisi]], or True Path Party.  Yılmaz also made the Motherland Party more business-friendly and [[Europe]]-oriented, causing the more conservative, religious wing to switch to the [[Refah Partisi]], or Welfare Party, of [[Necmettin Erbakan]]. In October 1998 over tension about alleged [[Hafez al-Assad]]'s  support to separatist Kurd party [[PKK]], he set off a furor in the [[Arab world]] by threatening to "poke out the eyes" of [[Syria]] [http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9810&L=twatch-l&D=1&O=D&F=P&P=33225]. Yılmaz's last stint as Prime Minister ended in 1999.  He continued as a politician, however, serving as a deputy prime minister in a coalition led by [[Bülent Ecevit]] from 1999 to 2002. After his failure to win entry into the Grand National Assembly in 2002 elections, Yılmaz retired from politics to pursue a teaching career. After almost 4 years, Yılmaz announced his return to politics in August 2006.

He was charged by the state public prosecutor with corruption during his tenure as prime minister and his trial started at the Supreme Court in 2005 but found innocent the following year.

In [[Turkish general election, 2007|2007 general election]] he is elected as independent member of parliament from [[Rize]].
