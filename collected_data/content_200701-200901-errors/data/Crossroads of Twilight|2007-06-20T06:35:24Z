'''''Crossroads of Twilight''''' (abbreviated as '''CoT''' by fans) is the tenth book of ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' [[fantasy]] series written by [[United States|American]] author [[Robert Jordan]]. It was published by [[Tor Books]] and released on [[January 7]], [[2003]]. Upon its release, it immediately rose to the #1 position on the ''[[New York Times]]'' hardcover fiction [[New York Times bestseller list|bestseller list]], making it the third ''Wheel of Time'' book to reach the #1 position on that list. It remained on the list for the next three months. 

==Pre-publication information==
The [[prologue]] of ''Crossroads of Twilight'', entitled "Glimmers of the Pattern", was first sold by the Scribner [[imprint]] of [[Simon & Schuster]] as an [[ebook]] on [[July 17]], [[2002]], six months in advance of the physical release of the book.

==Plot introduction==
''Crossroads of Twilight'' consists of a [[prologue]], 30 [[chapter]]s, and an [[epilogue]]. ''[[Lord of Chaos]]'', ''[[Knife of Dreams]]'',
and ''[[New Spring]]'' are the only other Wheel of Time books to have an epilogue. Many of the events of ''Crossroads of Twilight'' take place simultaneously with the events of the previous book, ''[[Winter's Heart]]''.

==Plot summary==

[[Perrin Aybara]] continues trying to rescue his wife [[Faile Bashere]], [[kidnap]]ped by the Shaido [[Aiel]], even resorting to [[torture|torturing]] prisoners for information. In addition, Perrin is approached with the suggestion of alliance with the [[Seanchan]], at least on a temporary basis, to defeat the Shaido.

[[Mat Cauthon]] continues trying to escape Seanchan-controlled territory while courting [[Tuon]], the [[Daughter of the Nine Moons]], the woman whom he has kidnapped and who, it has been prophesied, will become his wife. Mat discovers that Tuon, as a potential ''sul'dam'', can be taught to channel the [[One Power]].

[[Elayne Trakand]] continues trying to solidify her hold on the Lion Throne of [[Andor (Wheel of Time)|Andor]].

[[Rand al'Thor]], the [[Dragon Reborn]], rests after the ordeal of cleansing the [[One Power]]. He sends [[Davram Bashere]], [[Logain Ablar]], and [[Loial]] to negotiate a truce with the Seanchan. They return at the end of the book to tell him that the Seanchan have accepted the truce, but demand the presence of the Dragon Reborn.

[[Egwene al'Vere|Egwene]] leads the rebel [[Aes Sedai]] in maintaining the [[siege]] of [[Tar Valon]]. At the end of the book, she is kidnapped by agents of the [[White Tower]].
