'''''The Chaser's War on Everything''''' (often shortened to '''''The War''''' by The Chaser cast) is a satirical television comedy series broadcast on [[ABC TV]] in [[Australia]].

The series is produced by satire group [[The Chaser]]: [[Chris Taylor (comedian)|Chris Taylor]] (who is also the show's script editor), [[Julian Morrow]] (now acting as executive producer), [[Craig Reucassel]], [[Andrew Hansen]] and [[Chas Licciardello]]. [[Dominic Knight]] is a writer, but does not play an on-screen role.  [[Charles Firth]] does roving reports for the show from the [[United States]].

In [[December]] [[2006]] ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' won an [[Australian Film Institute]] Award for 'Best Television Comedy Series' and [[Andrew Hansen]] won an AFI Award for 'Best Performance in a Television Comedy.'<ref>{{cite website|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791055/awards|title=Awards for "The Chaser's War on Everything"|publisher=IMDB Awards list}}</ref>

In [[May]] [[2007]], the program was nominated for the [[TV Week]] [[Logie Award|Logie]] award "Most Outstanding Comedy Program".<ref name="Logies">

|accessdate=2007-05-07
|publisher=ninemsn Pty Ltd.}}</ref>

The program currently airs on Wednesday at 9pm on the main ABC TV channel; it is repeated on Friday evening at around 11pm and again on Saturday on digital channel [[ABC2]].

==Show concept==
The show's studio segments are performed panel-style in front of a live audience, on a set reminiscent of where [[The Chaser|the group]] used to meet. These segments are interspersed with pre-produced location items and fake advertisements. The series looks at all issues and attacks a wide range of current topics in politics and the media.  Series one aired late on Friday evenings where it developed a cult following, prompting a move to a more high-profile slot on Wednesdays at 9pm for season two.

==DVDs==
A [[DVD]] of the first thirteen episodes of Season One was released on [[August 17]] [[2006]]. A second [[DVD]] with episodes 14-26 was released on [[November 1]] [[2006]]. The Second Series' first 13 episodes is to be released on [[August 14]] [[2007]].

New segments have also been developed and the opening sequence has been reworked. The new timeslot of 9 p.m. ([[Australian Eastern Standard Time|AEST]]) on Wednesday evenings has resulted in an increase in the show's ratings.<ref name="ratings1">

Part One of Season Two of the series has now fully aired and the Chaser team is currently taking a break of ten weeks, so the usual production quota of twenty-six episodes per year does not conclude before the [[Australian general election, 2007|2007 Federal Election]].<ref name="chaserbreak">

==Segments on the show==

Segments in {{fontcolor|#F28500||'''orange'''}} were in Season One, but so far have not been in Season Two. Segments in {{fontcolor|#009900||'''green'''}} denote a new segment introduced in Season Two. Segments in '''black''' have been in both seasons.

===Primary Segments===

The primary segments form the backbone of the show. These segments normally focus on key issues in a range of topics. They are normally presented by the cast members, live in front of the audience, and can be accompanied with pre-produced stunts and sketches relating to the topics. 

* '''"What Have We Learnt from [[Current affairs (news format)|Current Affairs]] This Week?"''' – Presented by Hansen and Licciardello, the segment pokes fun at programs ''[[Today Tonight]]'' and ''[[A Current Affair (Australia)|A Current Affair]]''; keeping scores for every story matching a category such as "Menace To Society", "Old People Screwed Over" and "People Cheating The System". Most segments feature a lesson on their reporting techniques. Subjects covered include how to spot 'dodgy' guys, how to identify the different types of experts (including those who "flip pages" and "click [[Mouse (computing)|mice]]"), and the art of network cross-promotion. They also make fun of both shows' tendency to come to fast inaccurate conclusions. In one of the episodes they held the What Have We Learnt From Current Affairs This Week? [[Academy Award|Oscars]] and in the final episode of Season One, they presented the "What Have We Learned From Current Affairs This Week Awards". Andrew and Chas also presented ''A Current Affair'' with the "Slightly Less Crap Than Today Tonight Award". In Season Two, there has been a reduction in the frequency of this segment, in favour of new segments, such as {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"The News According To Fox"'''}} and {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"What You Missed on Cable"'''}}.

* {{fontcolor|#F28500||'''"In Other News..."'''}} – Julian and Craig look at the news for this week and put forward their point of view on the issues. The segment also features various stunts relating to the mentioned news items. In Season Two, {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"The Fixers"'''}} has shown to replace this segment.

* '''"Firth in the USA"''' – [[Charles Firth]], now living in [[United States|America]], performs some kind of stunt or conducts some kind of interview. Segments included Firth trying to get into [[Yale University]]'s '[[Skull and Bones]]' [[secret society]]), attempting to be thrown out of more corporate headquarters in one day than [[Michael Moore]] has in his entire career and flirting with a male [[Christian]] fundamentalist from [[Westboro Baptist Church]]. A more famous segment is when Firth met [[Hillary Clinton]] during campaigning and offered to be her [[intern]]; an obvious satire of [[Monica Lewinsky]] <ref>http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/articles/2007/04/12/1175971220516.html</ref>. He also once went to [[Africa]] to see if products that stated they were "world famous" really were. The episode where Firth promotes to the Americans that many "famous landmarks" are located in [[Australia]] has attracted acclaim {{POV-statement}}, as it showed that the Americans interviewed had believed that the [[Great Wall of China]] is located in [[Darwin]], and that the "real" [[Mount Rushmore]] is in Australia as well.

* '''"The Ad Roadtest"''' – The team recreate situations shown in [[advertisements]] to see if they would work in real life. Examples include the confidentiality of [[Oral-B]] [[dentist]]s, if the use of [[Axe (deodorant)#Release of Clix|Lynx 'Clix' deodorant]] really does attract more girls, if Godfrey's [[vacuum cleaner]]s really can lift up [[bowling balls]], and whether dancing can result in getting a job, as evident in the [[Carlton Draught]] commercial, and the [[Nicorette]] commercial featuring male cheerleaders<ref name="ad">

|title= No matter how well you plan, there's always a flea
|date= 2006-05-19
|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>.

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"The Fixers"'''}} – Julian and Craig take on tough problems and offer an easy fix. Such problems include [[David Hicks]], [[Chas Licciardello|Chas]]' smell and [[reclaimed water|recycled water]]. It can be seen as a replacement for the {{fontcolor|#F28500||'''"In Other News..."'''}} segment from Season One.

* '''"Citizens' Infringement Officer"''' – Julian gives out [[fines]] to people for absurd reasons. He has given fake fines to [[parking]] inspectors, people with "wanker" [[Vehicle registration plate|number plates]], bad [[mobile phone]] [[ringtone]]s, inappropriate baby names and unattractive [[tattoo]]s.

===Supporting Segments===

The supporting segments are usually pre-produced stunts and sketches, supplementing the primary segments of the show. These segments are usually much shorter than the primary segments.

* '''Surprise Spruiker''' – A shop "spruiker" (Andrew Hansen) attempts to help various institutions sell things, such as [[Giorgio Armani]] suits with the call "$1000 madness", [[WorkChoices]] outside the offices of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, or [[Dell]] laptops satirising the [[Dell#Defective batteries|battery controversy]] or satirising the takeover of the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]]. His wireless speaker is generally carried out of range of the microphone by security, and he is escorted away. In the final episode of Season One, the Crazy Warehouse Guy and the Surprise Spruiker had a stand off (using special effects to create the situation, as they are both played by Hansen), in which the Crazy Warehouse Guy crammed the speaker over the Surprise Spruiker's head, with the order that his surprise spruiking was "never to be repeated.

* '''"Pursuit Trivia"''' – Julian Morrow tests the general knowledge of a politician or celebrity by asking a [[Trivial Pursuit]] question from a game card in his hand at an [[interview]] or [[press conference]].  As yet only three people have successfully answered a question: [[Kevin Rudd]] (debatable, as he happened to mention the answer in a long speech, although Morrow told him he was correct), [[Shannon Noll]], and [[Helen Clark]] (carefully avoiding the commonly-ridiculed New Zealand pronunciation of "six"). In a deleted scene on the [[DVD]] release of the show, [[Alex Lloyd]] repeatedly asked for more questions, until he also got one right. Occasionally Morrow will tell them the answer is for a piece of pie, holding up a very big wedge.

* '''"Scenes from the Life of the Crazy Warehouse Guy"''' – A stereotypical announcer (Andrew Hansen) from a [[warehouse]] [[television advertisement]] uses his unique speaking style in everyday situations such as ordering [[McDonald's]], asking for help in a public library or talking on a mobile phone in a crowded [[tram]]. It is hinted he is unaware of his unusual speaking patterns when he screamed about how everyone else was being too noisy. He is [[Christian]] and was even a priest for a brief amount of time. Most of this segment for the first season was shot on the same day near the start of the season. In the [[August 11]] [[2006]] episode the Crazy Warehouse Guy appeared in the studio, playing the piano and singing a duet with [[Emily Taheny]] from [[Comedy Inc.]]  The song was a modified version of [[George Gershwin]]'s "[[Let's Call the Whole Thing Off]]". In the final episode of the first series, the Crazy Warehouse Guy met with the Surprise Spruiker (Andrew Hansen's other recurring character) at the Rug Warehouse and had a stand-off. A recent episode featured the a documentary about the Crazy Warehouse Guy's previous jobs, including voice for a prototype GPS and a [[prostitute]].

* '''"Mr Ten Questions"''' – Andrew Hansen shows up at a press conference and proceeds to ask ten questions (which vary in degrees of relevance) without letting the interviewee speak until he has read out the list. So far [[Anthony LaPaglia]] and [[Kerri-Anne Kennerley]] are the only people to successfully answer all the questions, however LaPaglia did get prompts from Andrew, and his final answer ("Yes," in response to "Why is it called "[[Without a Trace]]" when all you do is find traces and find them?") made no sense. 

* {{fontcolor|#F28500||'''"A Message From Osama Bin Laden"'''}} – An existing video of the infamous terrorist [[Osama Bin Laden]] is subbed with incorrect and humorous [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], often declaring a [[Jihad]] on various people for arbitrary irritations.  Videos of [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] and [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] have also been used in a similar manner.

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"If Life Were A Musical"'''}} – Members of the cast go to the public, targeting a specific person with a problem, and behave as though they are in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-esque musical. The segment is referred to as a "Taylor Hansen Morrow" production.

===Occasional segments===

These segments support the show, however do not feature prominently.

* {{fontcolor|#F28500||'''"Famous Face Off"'''}} – Two "masters" in a particular field compete to be the best in an endeavour such as tongue-twisting newsreading or "[[goalkeeper|blocking]]" reforms in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] by [[Barnaby Joyce]] and [[Steve Fielding]].

* {{fontcolor|#F28500||'''"The 2:30 Report"'''}} – In this segment Chas and Julian review the worst of late-night [[television]], such as late night game shows such as [[Quizmania (Australia)|Quizmania]] and [[Christian]] programming.

* '''"What Have We Learnt From History?"''' – In this segment the cast test whether people today have learnt a lesson from events in the past, for example the invasion of the [[Trojan Horse]], the story of [[Genesis]] or the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German Invasion of Poland]] in [[World War Two]].

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"The News According To Fox"'''}} – In a similar fashion to "What Have We Learned from Current Affairs This Week?", Chas and Andrew satirically criticise the bias of the popular American [[Fox News Channel]].

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"Clive The Slightly-Too-Loud Commuter"'''}} – Clive (Andrew) goes onto [[public transport]] and begins to talk extremely loudly on his [[mobile phone]] about very personal issues, such as [[Illegal drug trade|drugs]] or [[Sex organ|genital]] health to "Dr. Beaty".

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"What You Missed on Cable"'''}} – An occasional segment which shows the oddities of some programs on [[Pay television|cable]] and sometimes comparing them to bland programming on the [[ABC TV|ABC]]. Talk show [[Maury (TV series)|Maury]] features prominently in this segment.

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"Anna Coren's [[Segue]] of the Week"'''}} – Integrated into "What Have We Learnt from Current Affairs This Week?", looking at [[Anna Coren|Coren]]'s extremely unrelated and fast transitions between stories on ''[[Today Tonight]]''.

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"Nut Job of the Week"'''}} – The team takes a look at the "special people in our society" - people who have "alternative views". For example, [[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]]'s theory on how to acquire your deepest desires by the [[Law of Attraction]] was tested in the general public.

== Recurring themes ==
*'''Songs''' - Andrew Hansen performs songs with a humorous theme. Some include [[Prolix]] [[Songwriter]] (a songwriter who is prolix); Hill$ong (a parody of [[Hillsong]]); boyBand (a parody on [[boyband]]s) and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Comedian]] (a parody of [[Billy Connolly]]) & The Filler Song. Although all the music and vocals are by Andrew, the other members often appear to be singing or playing but they are in fact miming or pretending to play. The songs are usually written by Andrew or Chris. {{Fact|date=June 2007}} 
*'''Television Advertisements''' - Throughout the series the team create satirical [[television advertisements]]. These advertise a false item or mock existing ads. Some notable ones include 'sandy' toilet paper, toilet paper made out of sandpaper; and a parody of the government ad, 'Violence Against Women - Australia Says No', in which they changed it to, 'Appearing In Government Ads - Australia Says No'. This was also used to promote the new season (2007) of the show on the ABC, where they changed it to state that they had no new material.
*'''Movie Trailers''' - The team creates parody trailers for existing movies. Some include ''When a Telemarketer Calls'' (''[[When a Stranger Calls]]''), ''Brokeback Mountain: Christian Edition'' (''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''), ''American [[Pi|π]]'' (''[[American Pie]]''), and ''[[Carlton & United Beverages|Carlton United]] 93'' (''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'').
*'''Vox Pop''' - One of the team members conduct [[vox pop]]s with people on the street asking for their opinions. One vox pop includes Craig asking tourists about the new Australian tourist campaign, '[[So where the bloody hell are you?]]', which has the subject of much media attention of the use of the word "bloody". Instead, Craig asked opinions on 'new' campaigns, including; 'Don't be a prick, visit Australia,', 'Australia, it shits all over everywhere else' and 'Fuck, Australia's fucking great so why the fuck aren't you here motherfucker?'. In another segment, Julian asked people if they thought iPods were anti-social, while listening to an [[iPod]] himself.
*'''Door to Door''' - One or two members go door-knocking around the neighbourhood. Some sketches include asking people if they want to join Al-Qaeda, if they can keep homeless people at their house for the duration of the Commonwealth Games and door to door spam.
*'''Chas' Challenge''' - A challenge is put forward to Chas. Some include [[bonehead]]ing at the Logies and achieving the world's shortest [[taxi]] fare (under 20 metres).

==Controversies and well-known stunts==
Some of the events on the show have received significant news coverage.

===Julian Morrow's novelty cheque===

On [[February 8]] [[2006]], before the first episode of the show had screened, Julian Morrow approached [[Australian Wheat Board]] executive Charles Stott with a fake novelty cheque, made out to [[Saddam Hussein]], and asked Stott to sign it.  Stott's lawyer said his client felt intimidated by the stunt,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200602/s1565449.htm|title=AWB inquiry not laughing over 'The Chaser' stunt|date=[[2006-02-08]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> and the footage of the stunt was not shown in the first episode as scheduled due to "legal reasons". In the first episode to go to air, Julian Morrow responded, by raising the point that Charles Stott has done business with Saddam Hussein, a brutal dictator, yet he is intimidated by a large novelty cheque. The footage of this stunt does appear as a bonus on the show's first DVD.

===Chris Taylor on Sunrise===
[[Image:Taylorsunrise.jpg|thumb|right|Chris Taylor on Sunrise]]

On the ninth episode of the show, Chris Taylor announced that he planned to break-up with his wife of seven years, but he didn't want to ask her "the usual boring way," but do "something special, something she'll remember". The segment shows several of Taylor's attempts to "pop the question," including hanging a sign over a freeway, and "proposing" on a big screen at an outdoor festival. For the finale, Taylor introduces the interview of him on the morning television program, ''[[Sunrise (TV program)|Sunrise]]''. In the interview, Taylor asks the host if he can send a quick message to his partner, he then proceeds to tell her to "Get the fuck out of my life". This finale from the segment was leaked onto the internet and has been widely distributed by email. Many viewers believed the segment was actually real but Taylor admitted on national radio station [[Triple J]] that it was set up. It was actually filmed after ''[[Sunrise (TV program)|Sunrise]]'' went to air and shown on ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' only at this time. {{Fact|date=June 2007}} Channel Seven also edited the footage and edited in all the onscreen graphics before giving them the footage.  The hosts of Sunrise admitted it was a set up. However, they did not know what Taylor was going to say because he only asked if he could do a bit for the show. {{Fact|date=June 2007}} Sunrise replayed a censored version of the clip on [[August 21]] [[2006]] when they had the Chaser team on the show promoting their new DVD.

===Chas Licciardello's Bulldogs incident===

On [[July 14]] [[2006]], [[Chas Licciardello]] was charged with offensive conduct after attempting to sell fake [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] merchandise outside an [[National Rugby League|NRL]] game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,19796246-26619,00.html|title=ABC to probe Chaser prank|publisher=[[News Limited]]|date=[[2006-07-15]]}}</ref> The merchandise included plastic [[knuckledusters]] and [[balaclava]]s in the Bulldogs' colours, and was supposed to satirise recent violent clashes between rugby league fans.  Several Bulldogs fans took offense and attempted to attack Licciardello, and as a result he was charged for offensive behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/chaser-canterbury-joke-gets-no-laughs/2006/07/15/1152637916434.html|title=Chaser Canterbury joke gets no laughs|date=[[2006-07-16]]|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> On the broadcast following his arrest, Licciardello appeared onstage in handcuffs and within an iron cage. On that same episode, he apologised for his actions, claiming to understand why the Bulldogs fans were offended: because Canterbury Bulldogs fans much prefer to use their fists. This statement was accompanied by footage of Bulldog's supporters assaulting opposing team supporter's during a match. After appearing in court with co-star Julian Morrow, Licciardello pleaded not guilty and the matter was adjourned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/chaser-star-pleads-not-guilty/2006/08/29/1156617314466.html|title=Chaser star pleads not guilty|date=[[2006-07-16]]|publisher=[[The Age]]}}</ref> On [[January 23]], [[2007]], Licciardello was found [[not guilty]] of the offensive behaviour charge.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1831871.htm|title=Chaser star cleared over Bulldogs stunt|date=[[2007-01-23]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> He was interviewed after the case draped in an [[Australian flag]], and said he would appeal "to the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court]], to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], to the [[UN]], to the [[Jedi Council]] and the [[Snickometer]]." After being reminded he had won, he said "I didn't actually prepare any material for the off-chance that we won." He then said he was going to the [[Big Day Out]].<ref name ="Chaser court victory hailed as triumph for free speech">{{cite news

===Craig Reucassel's axe stunt===

On [[2 August]] [[2006]], Craig Reucassel responded to a news story about a private school student who had hugged Prime Minister [[John Howard]] while holding a [[screwdriver]] during one of the PM's morning walks.  To test the Prime Minister's security arrangements, he approached John Howard during a morning walk and asked for a hug while holding a large plastic [[battle axe]].  Reucassel did receive the hug, but a later approach while holding a running [[chainsaw]] was not so successful.  There was much debate surrounding whether or not to turn on the chainsaw and whether they would be shot at for doing this.<ref>{{Citation

Cut out from this segment was the attempt between the axe and the chainsaw, in which Reucassel was holding a four-point-star mace. He did not achieve his hug on that occasion, either. Anybody who listens to the DVD commentaries of the Chaser's War on Everything will know just how difficult it was for them to actually find John Howard at all.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/we-are-amused/2006/08/02/1154198182710.html|title=Chaser axe stunt gets Howard going|date=[[2006-08-02]]|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>

===Julian Morrow's Virgin Blue ticket prank===

On [[16 August]] [[2006]], Julian Morrow purchased two airline tickets on the [[Virgin Blue]] airline under the names "[[Al-Qaeda|Al Kyder]]" and "[[Terrorist|Terry Wrist]]", checked in using the automated check-in at [[Sydney Airport]], and then did not show up for boarding, so that the names would be read out in a final boarding call over the public address system.<ref name="virginblue">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/a-stunt-too-far/2006/08/18/1155407999231.html|title=Al Kyder: Virgin on the ridiculous|date=[[2006-08-18]]|publisher=[[The Age]]}}</ref> The prank was acknowledged by Virgin Blue who criticised the use of taxpayer dollars in the "childish humour".<ref name="virginblue"/>

===Craig Reucassel's Speedos===

On [[March 19]] [[2007]], during a campaign appearance for the [[New South Wales general election, 2007|New South Wales State Election]], the then-[[Opposition (Australia)|opposition leader]] [[Peter Debnam]] was confronted by Craig Reucassel wearing nothing but [[Speedos]] and a baseball cap <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Speedowearing-comedian-confronts-Debnam/2007/03/19/1174152947020.html|title=Speedo wearing comedian confronts Debnam|date=[[2007-03-19]]|publisher=[[The Age]]}}</ref>, making fun of Debnam's campaign appearances in the swimwear.  When TV cameras remained focused on Reucassel rather than Mr Debnam, he said, "Sorry, I'm not Peter Debnam, he's over there. Just because I'm wearing this doesn't mean I'm Peter Debnam".  Reucassel stuck around for the press conference but failed to draw a response from the opposition leader, and was again ignored when he went to shake Mr Debnam's hand. Although he wasn't quite ignored by a security team as he attempted to enter Mr Debnam's car replying whilst being pushed away from the car, "Oh sorry I'm not Peter Debnam I forgot".

On [[1 June]] [[2007]], during the Mr Ten Questions segment, Hansen created controversy when he asked visiting movie star [[Sophia Loren]] ten questions, including "[[Who Let The Dogs Out?|who let the dogs out?]]", "is that you doing the voice of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] on [[South Park]]?" and "this is all something we secretly wonder; because you're such a refined [[actress]], do you ever [[fart]]?" <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/06/01/1180205493873.html|title=Chaser's war on Loren|date=[[2007-06-01]]|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> Loren seemed confused as to what was going on, and when Hansen was removed by security, she stated "That man was just silly. Silly, silly, silly!"

==Publicity on Current Affairs shows==

Australia's two main tabloid current affairs programs, both of which are mocked in the ''What Have We Learned From Current Affairs This Week?'' segment, have aired "[[puff piece]]" segments about The Chaser. 

===A Current Affair===
On [[19 April]] [[2007]], [[Nine Network]]'s current affairs program [[A Current Affair]] aired a positive segment perpetuating rumours that the program was defecting to a commercial network.<ref name="aca1">

Other ABC shows have defected to commercial networks in the past, including [[Good News Week]], [[Shaun Micallef]], and most recently, [[Kath & Kim]]. The Chaser mocked Channel 9 the following episode with a skit titled ''The Chaser's War On Everything (Except Sponsors)'', which essentially put forward the message that many of the attacks made on the show are on corporate sponsors of the commercial networks and as such would not be wanted on them.

On [[May 9]], [[2007]], ''A Current Affair'' back-flipped and aired a negative segment about ''The Chaser'', about their jokes "overstepping the mark" and how dangerous their stunts are.<ref name="aca2">

''A Current Affair'' aired another segment about ''The Chaser'' on [[June 7]], [[2007]], using the same clichés about them "overstepping the mark" and being criticised by [[2UE]] presenter [[Steve Price (broadcaster)|Steve Price]] and a random Vietnam War veteran. The show satirised this by interviewing their own Vietnam vet: a veterinarian who was Vietnamese. <ref name="aca3">

===Today Tonight===
On [[13 June]] [[2007]], the [[Seven Network]] current affairs program [[Today Tonight]] also aired a segment on ''The Chaser''<ref name="tt3">

|title = Is the Chaser's War just a set-up?

Some of their better known setups include Chris swearing on ''Sunrise'' (see above), the [[Ford Focus]] Ad Road Test and the [[Sheik Hilaly]]/[[Anthony Mundine]] sketch.

The reporter met with Chas and Andrew outside the ABC building in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]], where they greeted him with a van that had a 'Meakin Booze Bus' stencil on the side, seemingly unaware of the stunt being pulled on them. ''Seven'''s head of News and Current Affairs, [[Peter Meakin]] had recently been convicted for a third time for [[drink driving]].<ref name="tt1">

During the segment, Today Tonight attempted to ambush audience members who were outside the studio at the filming of a ''Chaser'' episode aired on [[14 June]] [[2007]]. ''The Chaser'' had tipped off the audience about ''Today Tonight's'' presence, and instructed anyone approached by the crew to bring up the subject of Peter Meakin.<ref name="tt4">

|publisher = [[Herald Sun]]}}</ref> ''Today Tonight'' only aired one interview with a young boy in attendance who was surprised that ''The Chaser's'' stunts were set up.

During ''The Chaser''  episode which was filmed, the ''What Have We Learned From Current Affairs This Week?'' segment's lesson was about Chaser puff pieces on both current affairs shows, it showed footage of the interview with the ''Today Tonight'' reporter, Chas and Andrew constantly brought up the subject of Peter Meakin.

''Today Tonight'' itself has previously come under fire for set-up stunts for their own show.<ref name="BootGivenTheBoot">

==Video podcasting==

[[Image:chaservodcastblock.png|thumb|right|Visitors from outside of Australia now have limited access to ''The Chaser's War On Everything'' vodcasts.]]
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:ChasersWarVodcast.png|thumb|right|Australian citizens or those accessing "The Chaser's War on Everything" website from within Australia have unlimited rights to vodcasts.]] -->

On [[July 27]] [[2006]] the ABC announced that entire episodes of The Chaser's War on Everything, along with [[jtv]], would be made available for download via a [[vodcast]]ing system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s1698372.htm|title=ABC launches Vodcasting|date=[[2006-07-27]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref>  Just days after appearing on the Australian [[iTunes]] podcasting directory, the show took the number one position. The first season vodcast episodes contained all material originally broadcast but some shows in the second season featured copyrighted music (such as the famous theme to [[Cops]], "[[Bad Boys (Inner Circle song)|Bad Boys]]"), and so had to be removed from the podcast.

As of Season Two, [[List of The Chaser's War on Everything episodes|Episode 6]], which aired on [[May 2]] [[2007]], the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] has stopped allowing visitors from outside of Australia from accessing the vodcast. Instead, they receive the following message:

"We're sorry, this video podcast is made available for use by persons located in Australia only. If you are not located in Australia, you are not authorised to use this podcast."

An actual IP-based ban was also instated on the podcast, banning non-Australian RSS clients from getting the podcast.  This had the side effect of US Web-based RSS readers, such as [[Google Reader]] and [[My Yahoo]], being unable to reach the podcast.

As of [[June 7]] [[2007]], the ABC has reinstated limited access to [http://www.abc.net.au/tv/chaser/war/int/vodcast/ download episodes] of the show for viewers in the United States and Singapore, among others.

===YouTube===
Hundreds of clips from the show were pulled from video sharing site [[YouTube]] after a fake [[DMCA]] take down notice.<ref>
