'''Soft tyranny''' is an idea first coined by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in his [[1835]] work entitled ''[[Democracy in America]]''.<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'' (New York: Bantam Books, 2000), 9-15.</ref> In effect, soft tyranny occurs whenever the social conditions of a particular [[community]] hinder any prospect of [[hope]] among its members.<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'' (New York: Bantam Books, 2000), 9-15.</ref> For Tocqueville, hope is the driving force behind all democratic institutions.<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'' (New York: Bantam Books, 2000), 9-15.</ref> As such, whenever this all-encompassing hope is taken away from the people, [[liberal democracy]] fails. Examples of this [[failure]] can be seen in the [[Weimar Republic]] of [[Germany]] during the [[1930s]] or in the [[French Third Republic]] around [[1940]]. Hope for a better [[future]] effectively [[died]] in both of the aforementioned situations. As a result, [[fascist]] regimes were established to fill the [[void]] left by the [[departure]] of hope.

==Inciting Rebellions==
Soft tyranny is often the cause of many insurrections. The most obvious area in which soft tyranny affects people occurs with their fiscal situations. Price control is typically considered to be a common feature associated with [[communist]] societies; however, it relates directly to not only rebellion, but also soft tyranny. For example, when seigneurial rights, such as land [[taxes]] and byway [[toll road|tolls]], began to seriously irritate the French [[peasantry]] in the mid-eighteenth century, violence in the form of rioting emerged as a consequence.<ref> John Markoff, "Peasants and their Grievances," ''The Origins of the French Revolution,'' ed. Peter Campbell (New York: Palgrave-MacMillan, 2006), 243.</ref> In effect, the price of bread, which was a staple in the peasant [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], increased to the point where common peasants could not afford to purchase it on a daily basis.<ref> John Markoff, "Peasants and their Grievances," ''The Origins of the French Revolution,'' ed. Peter Campbell (New York: Palgrave-MacMillan, 2006), 247.</ref> And whenever people cannot feed themselves, havoc tends to ensue. This instance in mid-eighteenth century France exemplifies a form of soft tyranny which can quietly disrupt and eventually unravel an entire socio-economic order.
