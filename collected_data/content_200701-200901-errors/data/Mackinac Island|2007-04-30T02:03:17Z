'''Mackinac Island''' ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|[ˈmækɪˌnɔː]}}, like MACK-in-aw, note the silent "c") is a small island, 9.779&nbsp;km² (3.776&nbsp;mi²) in land area, in the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. It is located in [[Lake Huron]], at the eastern end of the [[Straits of Mackinac]], between the state's [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper]] and [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsulas]].<ref name="HistplacesPDF"/> The island was a Native American settlement before European exploration began in the 17th century. It served a strategic position amidst the commerce of the [[Great Lakes]] [[fur trade]]. This led to the establishment of [[Fort Mackinac]] on the island by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. It was the scene of two strategic battles during the [[War of 1812]].<ref name="High Cliffs"/>

In the late 19th century, the island became a popular tourist attraction and [[summer colony]]. Much of Mackinac Island has undergone extensive historical preservation and restoration; as a result, the island is home to numerous nationally recognized historic places. It is well known for its ban on automobiles, numerous cultural events, and its wide variety of architectural styles, including the famous [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]]. More than 80% of the island is preserved as [[Mackinac Island State Park]].<ref name="Historic Treasure"/>

==Description==
The island is approximately 13&nbsp;kilometers (8&nbsp;mi) in circumference and about 9&nbsp;square kilometers (3.5&nbsp;mi²) in total area.<ref name="HistplacesPDF"/> It is accessible by private boats, by ferry, and by small aircraft. The [[Mackinac Island Airport|airport]] has a 1,070&nbsp;meter (3,500&nbsp;ft) paved runway, and charter air service from the mainland is available.<ref>{{cite web  | title = By Air   | publisher = Mackinac.com  |url=http://www.mackinac.com/content/gettinghere/byair.html  | accessdate = 2007-03-14 }}</ref> In the summer tourist season, three separate ferry services shuttle visitors to the island from [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]] and [[Mackinaw City, Michigan|Mackinaw City]].<ref name="State Parks">{{cite web  | title = Mackinac Island FAQs  | publisher = Mackinac State Historic Parks  | url = http://www.mackinacparks.com/parks/mackinac-island-faqs_39/  | accessdate =2007-03-14  }}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:British-Landing-Plaque.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Historical Marker at British Landing]]
Mackinac Island is a sacred place in the tradition of some of its earliest known inhabitants, the [[Anishinaabe]] ([[Ojibwa]]) tribes, as it is home to the spirit [[Gitche Manitou]].<ref name=".orgHistory"/> The island was a gathering place for local tribes where offerings were made to Gitche Manitou and was where tribal chiefs were buried. The first European who is likely to have seen Mackinac Island is [[Jean Nicolet]], a French-Canadian [[coureur de bois]] (unlicensed fur trader), during his 1634 explorations. The Jesuit priest [[Claude Dablon]] founded a mission post to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on Mackinac Island in 1670, and overwintered here in 1670-71.  Dablon's fall 1671 successor, the missionary and explorer [[Jacques Marquette]], moved the mission to St. Ignace soon after his arrival.<ref name="Hamilton">{{cite book  | last =Hamilton  | first =Raphael N., S.J  | title =Father Marquette  | publisher =William B. Eerdmans  | location =Grand Rapids  | pages = 43}} </ref><ref name="Boynton">{{cite book  | last =Boynton  | first =James, S.J.  | title =Fishers of Men: The Jesuit Mission at Mackinac, 1670-1765  | publisher =Ste. Anne's Church  | date =1996  | location =Mackinac Island  | pages =14-15}}</ref> With the mission as a focus the Straits of Mackinac quickly became an important French fur trading location. The British took control of the Straits of Mackinac after the [[French and Indian War]], and Major [[Patrick Sinclair]] chose the bluffs of the island for [[Fort Mackinac]] in 1780.<ref name="High Cliffs">{{cite web

Although the British built Fort Mackinac to protect their settlement from attack by Americans and native tribes, the fort was never attacked during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the entire Straits area was officially acquired by the U.S. through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783. However, much of the British forces did not leave the Great Lakes area until after [[Jay's Treaty]] established U.S. sovereignty over the entire [[Northwest Territory]] in 1794.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brinkley |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Brinkley   |title=American History: A Survey |date=2003|edition=11  |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |location=New York |isbn=0-07-242436-2 |pages=141, 173}}</ref>
During the [[War of 1812]], the British captured the fort in the first [[Battle of Mackinac Island (1812)|battle]] of the conflict because the Americans had not yet heard that war had been declared. The victorious British attempted to protect their prize by building Fort George on the [[high ground]] behind Fort Mackinac.  In 1814, the Americans and British fought a second [[Battle of Mackinac Island|battle]] on the north side of the island.  The American second-in-command, Major [[Andrew Holmes|Andrew Hunter Holmes]] was killed, and the Americans failed to recapture the island.  

Despite this military outcome, the [[Treaty of Ghent]] forced the British to return the island and surrounding mainland to the U.S. in 1815.  The U.S. reoccupied Fort Mackinac, and renamed Fort George ''Fort Holmes'', after Major Holmes.<ref name="High Cliffs"/><ref name="Holmes">{{cite web  | last =Brennan  | first =James  | title =Fort Holmes  | publisher = The Michigan Historical Marker Web Site   | url = http://www.michmarkers.com/startup.asp?startpage=S0078.htm  | accessdate =2007-03-04}}</ref> Fort Mackinac remained under the control of the United States government until 1895 and provided volunteers to defend the Union during the [[American Civil War]]. The fort even served as a prison for three [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers.<ref name=".orgHistory"/>

[[John Jacob Astor]]'s [[American Fur Company]] was centered on Mackinac Island after the War of 1812 and exported [[beaver]] pelts for the next thirty years. By the middle of the 19th century, [[commercial fishing]], specifically for [[whitefish]] and [[lake trout]], began to replace the fur trade as the island's primary industry. As [[sport fishing]] became more popular in the 1880s, small hotels and restaurants began to be built to accommodate the growing numbers of tourists coming by train from [[Detroit]].<ref name="High Cliffs"/>

Much of the federal land on Mackinac Island was designated as [[Mackinac National Park]] in 1875, just three years after [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] was designated as the first national park. When the federal government left the island in 1895, all of the federal land, including Fort Mackinac, was given to the state of Michigan and became Michigan's first state park. Following the Civil War, the island became a popular tourist destination for residents of cities on the Great Lakes. To accommodate the influx of tourists, the boat and railroad companies built hotels, including the Grand Hotel. Souvenir shops began to spring up as a way for island residents to profit from the tourists. Many wealthy [[industrialist]]s built summer [[cottage]]s along the island's bluffs for extended stays. The state park commission appointed to oversee the island has limited private development in the park and requires leaseholders to maintain the island's distinctive Victorian architecture.<ref name="Historic Treasure">{{cite web

[[Motor vehicles]] were restricted at the end of the 19th century because of concerns for the health and safety of the island's residents and horses after local carriage drivers complained that automobiles startled their horses.

==Geology==
Mackinac Island was formed as the glaciers of the last [[Wisconsin glaciation|ice age]] began to melt around 13000 BCE. The melting glaciers formed the Great Lakes, and the receding lakewaters eroded the [[limestone]] bedrock, forming the island's steep cliffs and rock formations. As the glaciers completely melted and the lakes receded to near their present levels, Mackinac Island grew to its current size.<ref name="HistplacesPDF"/> The steep cliffs were one of the primary reasons for the British army's choice of the island for a fortification; their decision differed from that of the French army, which had built [[Fort Michilimackinac]] about 1715 near present-day [[Mackinaw City]]. The limestone formations are still part of the island's appeal. However, tourists are attacted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is [[Arch Rock (Mackinac Island)|Arch Rock]], a natural limestone arch, nearly 45&nbsp;meters (150&nbsp;ft) above the ground.<ref name="High Cliffs"/><ref>{{cite web  | title = Arch Rock on Mackinac Island, MI  | publisher = Vacations Made Easy  | url = http://www.vacationsmadeeasy.com/MackinacIslandAreaMI/pointsOfInterest/ArchRockonMackinacIslandMI.cfm  | accessdate =2007-03-11  }}</ref> Other popular geologic formations include [[Sugar Loaf (Mackinac Island)|Sugar Loaf]] and Skull Cave.<ref name="Historic Treasure"/>

==Etymology of "Mackinac"==
Like many historic places in the Great Lakes region, Mackinac Island's name derives from a Native American language. Native Americans in the Straits of Mackinac region likened the shape of the island to that of a turtle. Therefore, they named it "Mitchimakinak" ([[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwe]] ''mishi-mikinaak'')<ref>Nichols, John D. and Nyholm, Earl (1995). ''A Concise Dictionary of Minnesota Ojibwe''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press</ref> meaning "big turtle". The French used a version of the original pronunciation: [[Michilimackinac]]. However, the English shortened it to the present name: "Mackinac."<ref>{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=Mackinaw |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Mackinaw |accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Ferjutz |first=Kelly |title=Broadcloth, Brocade and Buckskin -- Return to the past on Mackinac Island |publisher=FrugalFun.com |url=http://www.frugalfun.com/mackinack.html |accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref>

==Culture==
Mackinac Island is home to many cultural events, including an annual show of [[American art]] from the Masco collection of 19th century works at the Grand Hotel. There are also at least five art galleries on the island.<ref>{{cite web  | last =Slevin  | first =Mary McGuire  | title = The Arts  | publisher =Mackinacisland.org  | url = http://www.mackinacisland.org/arts.html  | accessdate =2007-03-10 }}</ref> Mackinac Island has been the setting of two feature films: ''[[This Time for Keeps]]'' in 1946 and ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]],'' filmed at the Grand Hotel in 1979.<ref>{{cite web  | last =Slevin  | first =Mary McGuire  | title = Film  | publisher =Mackinacisland.org  | url = http://www.mackinacisland.org/film.html  | accessdate =2007-03-10  }}</ref> In addition, Mackinac Island has been written about and visited by many influential writers including [[Alexis De Tocqueville]], [[Margaret Fuller]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Edward Everett Hale]], [[Mark Twain]], and [[Constance Fenimore Woolson]].<ref>{{cite web  | last =Slevin  | first =Mary McGuire  | title = Literature  | publisher =Mackinacisland.org  | url = http://www.mackinacisland.org/literature.html  | accessdate =2007-03-10  }}</ref> In addition, favorable growing conditions have allowed [[lilac]]s to thrive on the island.

Most of the buildings on Mackinac Island are built from wood, though a few are made of stone, and most have [[clapboard]] siding.<ref name="HistplacesPDF">{{cite web  | title = National Historic Landmark Nomination - Mackinac Island  | publisher = United States Department of the Interior  | url = http://www.mackinacisland.org/html/nationalhistoriclandmark.pdf  | format = [[PDF]]  | accessdate =2007-03-10  }}</ref> The [[architectural styles]] on the island span 300 years of habitation, from the earliest Native American structures to the styles of the 19th century. The earliest structures were built by the Anishnaabe, Ojibwe, and [[Chippewa]] tribes before European exploration. At least two buildings still exist from the original French settlement in the late 18th century, making Mackinac Island the only example of northern French rustic architecture in the United States, and one of a few survivors in [[North America]]. Fort Mackinac, with its whitewashed stone walls instead of the more traditional wood, is a European adaptation of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic military architecture]]. Mackinac Island also contains examples of Federalist, [[colonial house|Colonial]], and [[Greek revival]] styles. Much of the island however, is built in the style of the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] era which includes [[Gothic Revival]], [[Stick style]], [[Italianate]], [[Second Empire]], [[Richardson Romanesque]] and [[Queen Anne style|Queen Anne]] styles. The most recent styles used on the island date from the late 1800s to the 1930s and include the [[Colonial revival]] and [[Tudor revival]] styles.<ref>{{cite web

===Mackinac Island Honor Scouts===
Every summer, a minimum of 50 Michigan [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] and [[Scouting in Michigan|Girl Scouts]] at any one time, live and work on the island in alternating weeks. The program began in 1929 when the state park commission invited eight [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]s, including young [[Gerald Ford]], to serve as [[honor guard]]s for the Michigan governor. In 1974, the program was expanded to include Girl Scouts. The program is popular, and only the most well-motivated scouts are accepted into the program. Scouts perform such duties as raising and lowering all of the flags in the city and in Fort Mackinac. They also serve as guides, answering questions and checking tickets at historic locations around the island and they must complete a service project during their stay. Scouts must march when in groups and practice proper stances when at guide posts, this includes the use of "[[parade rest]]" while on duty. In addition, full dress uniform is required when scouts are on duty or walking in public, a much higher standard than is typically enforced for a troop's normal use. During each troop's week on the island, they stay in the Scout Barracks, located north of Fort Mackinac.<ref>{{cite web
