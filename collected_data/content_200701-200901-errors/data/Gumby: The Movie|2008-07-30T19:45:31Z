'''''Gumby: The Movie''''' is a [[1995 in film|1995]] [[clay animation]] [[feature film]] featuring the character [[Gumby]].
==[[Opening sequence]] clip==
Part of the 1960's Gumby theme song, along with part of the episode [[The Glob]] in 1959 and an audio clip from [[Sad Kind Ott's Daughter]], were shown on a television set at the beginning of the movie.

==Plot==
When the Blockheads' E-Z Loan company threatens to take away the farms belonging to the small farmers, Gumby and his band, the Clayboys, decide to have a benefit concert to save the farms. But when the Blockheads find out that Gumby's dog, Lowbelly, cries pearls when he sees the Clayboys perform, they decide to kidnap Lowbelly and force him to cry pearls. When he doesn't respond, they kidnap Gumby and the Clayboys and turn them into robot clones. With the help of Pokey, Prickle, Goo, Tara, Ginger, and Lucky Claybert, Gumby takes on his robot clone and is still in time for his video taping session. At a picnic, Gumby announces that he's opening his own farm loan company. The Blockheads are forced to weed Gumby's garden, and Gumby and Pokey decide that things are looking up for them.

==Trivia==

* In April 2007, a director's cut version of the movie was shown at the [[Tribeca Family Film Festival]]. This version of the film was released on DVD on April 22, 2008.
* The voice of Gumby is actually Dallas McKennon but sadly purposefully miscredited as the Voice Coach, as he is in the 80's Gumby TV Show.
* In the VHS version, the part where Blockhead "J" was shaking his fists in anger because Goo spit a ball of blue clay in Gumby robot's face was seen.  But in the DVD version, the scene was cut out.

==Quotes==
Goo [to Lucky Claybert]: I found a robot that made soup!

[After Pokey, Prickle, and Goo got fused together into a multi-character clay ball]

Pokey: I won't believe it. It can't be true!

Prickle: "To believe or not to believe?" That is the question.

Goo: You'd better start believing it 'cause I'm uncomfortable! Now everybody pull themselves together... I... I mean "apart".

Prickle: Impossible, Goo. Somebody call an ambulance.

Pokey: I wish Gumby would tell somebody where he goes. 

Prickle: Oh, well, Goo, here we come! 

Astronut #1: Maybe Gumby and Pokey went to the earth and into the toy shop?

Astronut #2: I don't know. Sometimes that wants to do that thing. Look!

Pokey: Gumby might think it was the same fat!

[Pokey lands on the Gumbasia Clay Set and Gumby as a green monolith flies to another location]
Pokey: Nuts, I thought he wanted to land here.  

Pokey (repeated line) : Holy Toledo!

Professor Kapp: Oh, my! This music does things to my brain!

Prickle: It does things to my spine.

Goo: It makes me feel funny all over!

'''Tara''': ''(singing)'' Oh... Gumby Oh...</br>

The day that I met you I lost a piece of my heart</br>
Now I've got you here, nothing's going to keep us apart</br>
I don't have to worry, I don't have to hurry now</br>
You are all I need. I know we can make it somehow</br>
We're making a breakthrough, heading for a fall</br>
Gumby, how can I make you see me at all?</br>

Take me away</br>
Oh Gumby, you do something to my chemistry</br>
Take me away</br>
Oh Gumby, you are a total mystery</br>
You're green, you're clay,</br>
you're a cosmic display</br>
How can I go on this way?</br>

Oh, Gumby, Oh</br>
Take me away</br>

Trouble to the left, danger to the right;</br>
I feel it all around</br>
As long as you are near, there's no need to fear, and I won't back down</br>
I know you're the answer to all of my dreams</br>
Now that we're together,</br>
birds of a feather,</br>
we're the perfect team</br>

Take me away</br>
Oh Gumby, you do something to my chemistry</br>
Take me away</br>
Oh Gumby, you are a total mystery</br>
You're green, you're clay, you're a cosmic display</br>
How can I go on this way?</br>

Oh, Gumby, Oh</br>
Take me away</br>
Oh, Gumby, Oh</br>
Take me away</br>
Oh, Gumby, Oh</br>
Take me away...!</br>
