'''Elgin Cathedral''' <small>('''{{coor dms|57|39|04|N|03|18|17|W}}''')</small> sometimes referred to as ''The Lantern of the North'' is an historic [[ruin]] in [[Elgin, Moray]], north-east [[Scotland]].  For over eighty years, perhaps longer, the seat of the early [[bishop of Moray|bishops of Moray]]  moved between the churches of Birnie, Kineddar and finally [[Spynie Palace|Spynie]] where in [[1206]], the cathedral was finally fixed.  A short time later in [[1224]] the seat moved to Elgin but the [[cathedral]] only reached completion near the end of the [[13th century]].  The cathedral's [[chapter house]] &ndash; a unique feature in Scottish secular cathedrals but not uncommon in [[England]] &ndash; is still mostly intact.  The tombs of some of the Bishops of Moray containing their effigies can still be seen.  In [[1390]] the cathedral and the manses belonging to the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] along with the town of Elgin were burned by [[Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan]], known as the Wolf of Badenoch.  It was once again attacked in 1402 by the [[Lord of the Isles|Lord of the Isles’]] followers and again repaired in the [[15th century|15th]] and [[16th century|16th]] centuries only to fall into disuse and ruination due to neglect following the [[Scottish Reformation]].  Preservation of the building began slowly in the 19th century and gradually took pace during the 20th century and is now fully stabilised.
 
==Early cathedral churches of Moray==
It is possible that the [[mormaers of Moray]] may have appointed bishops as early as the 11th century.<ref>Gordon, ''Sees Before David I'', pp.&ensp;21&ndash;22</ref> Bishop [[Gregoir of Moray]] appears in the foundation charter of [[Scone Abbey|Scone Priory]], issued by King [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] (''Alaxandair mac Maíl Choluim'') between December 1123 and April 1124,<ref>Watt, ''Fasti'', p.&ensp;278</ref> and again in a charter defining the legal rights of the monastery.<ref>Archibald Lawrie, ''Early Scottish Charters Prior to A.D. 1153'', (Glasgow, 1905), charter nos. 36 & 49, pp.&ensp;28&ndash;30, 44, notes & translation, pp.&ensp;279&ndash;88; See Kenneth Veitch, "“Replanting Paradise”:Alexander I and the Reform of Religious Life in Scotland", in ''The Innes Review'', 52, (Autumn, 2001), pp.&ensp;140&ndash;6, for arguments about the date 1114.</ref> [[Image:Birnie Kirk.jpg|225px|left|thumb|Birnie Kirk, the first Cathedral Church of Moray, built c.1140]]After the suppression of [[Óengus of Moray]] in 1130 &ndash; who was aiding the claimant for the Scottish throne [[Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair]],<ref>[[Alan Orr Anderson]], ''Early Sources of Scottish History: AD 500&ndash;1286'', 2 Vols, (Edinburgh, 1922), vol. ii, pp.&ensp;173&ndash;4, 183; Alan Orr Anderson, ''Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers: AD 500&ndash;1286'', (London, 1908), republished, Marjorie Anderson (ed.)

The post-Óengus [[Bishop of Moray|bishops of Moray]] did not have a settled location for their cathedral and sited it at different times at Birnie, Kinneddar and [[Spynie Palace|Spynie]].<ref name=Cowan-206>Cowan & Easson, ''Religious Houses'', p.&ensp;206</ref>  Pope [[Innocent III]] issued a bull on 7 April 1206 that allowed bishop [[Bricius de Douglas]] to have his cathedral church to be fixed at Spynie &ndash; its inauguration took place between spring [[1207]] and summer [[1208]].<ref>Cant, ''Historic Elgin and Cathedral'', p.&ensp;21</ref> Authorisation to establish a chapter of eight canons for the day-to-day running of the cathedral was also granted while the chapter based its constitution on that of [[Lincoln Cathedral]]<ref>Cant, ''Historic Elgin and Cathedral'', pp.&ensp;21, 22</ref> and may have been influenced by the fact that Bricius’ predecessor was Bishop Richard de Lincoln.<br> <br>

The burgh of Elgin had become the lay centre of the province under David I.<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'', p.&ensp;5</ref>  Soon after his election to the see in 1362&ndash;3, Bishop [[Alexander Bur]] requested funds from Pope Urban V for repairs to the cathedral citing neglect and hostile attacks.<ref name=Fawcett-5/>  Bur began protection payments in August 1370 to [[Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan|Alexander Stewart]], at that time the de facto [[lord of Badenoch]] and son of Robert the [[High Steward of Scotland |Steward]] who was soon to become [[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]].  Stewart, the [[Earl of Buchan]] since 1382, and Bur had many disputes that culminated in Stewart's excommunication in February 1390 and the bishop turning to Thomas Dunbar, son of the Earl of Moray, to provide the protection service.<ref>Discussion on the quarrel, see: Grant, Alexander: The Wolf of Badenoch in ''Moray: Province and People; ed. Seller, W D H, Edinburgh, pp.&ensp;143&ndash;161''; Oram, Richard D: Alexander Bur, Bishop of Moray, 1362&ndash;1397 in ''Barbera Crawford (ed) Church Chronicle and Learning in Medieval and Early Renaissance Scotland, Edinburgh, 1999, pp.&ensp;202&ndash;204''</ref><ref>Grant, ''Moray: Province and People'', p.&ensp;151</ref>   These acts by the bishop taken together with Buchan's increased desperation at the strictures placed upon him by his brother, [[Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife]] and guardian of Scotland, caused him to react defiantly &ndash; in May, he descended from his castle on an island in [[Lochindorb]] and burned the town of [[Forres]] and followed this up in June by burning Elgin and the cathedral.<ref name=Grant-152>Grant, ''Moray: Province and People'', p.&ensp;152</ref> <ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', pp.&enspc;175&ndash;6</ref>   It is also thought he burned [[Pluscarden Abbey|Pluscarden Priory]] which was officially under the Bishop's protection.<ref>McCormack, ''Excavations at Pluscarden Priory'', p.&ensp;393</ref>  Bur wrote to the king seeking reparation in a letter stating:<ref name=Fawcett-5/> <blockquote>''My church was the particular ornament of the fatherland, the glory of the kingdom, the joy of strangers and incoming guests, the object of praise and exaltation in other kingdoms because of its decoration, by which it is believed that God was properly worshipped; not to mention its high bell towers, its venerable furnishings and uncountable jewels.''</blockquote>
[[Image:John de Winchester.JPG|left|240px|thumb|Tomb and effigy of Bishop John Winchester in St Mary's Aisle (1422&ndash;1440)]]King Robert eventually granted an annuity to Bur of £20 for the period up to the bishop’s death and the pope granted income from the Scottish church during the next decade.<ref name=Grant-152/>  In 1400, Bur wrote to the abbot of Arbroath complaining that the abbot's benefice churches in the diocese had not paid its dues for the restoration of the cathedral.<ref>Shaw, ''History of Moray'', p.&ensp;388</ref>.  Again, the burgh and cathedral precinct was attacked, this time by Alexander of Lochaber, brother of [[Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles]] in 3 July 1402 but he seems to have spared the cathedral itself burning only the manses &ndash; for this act he and his captains were excommunicated but they returned to Elgin in September to give reparation.<ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', p.&ensp;260 </ref>  In 1408, the money saved during a vacancy was diverted to the rebuilding and in 1413 a grant from the customs of Inverness was provided.<ref name=Fawcett-6>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'', p.&ensp;6 </ref>Relying on the collections from the faithful in these occasions could not be relied on.  Among the ordinary people there was an increasing feeling of disenchantment with the higher church establishment and this was further exacerbated by an increasing inclination for them to support the smaller parish churches where the bulk of the people worshipped.<ref>Dowden, ''Medieval Church'', p.&ensp;97 </ref>  Increasingly, though, the appropriation of the parish church revenues led in many cases to churches becoming dilapidated and unable to attract educated priests and by the later Middle Ages, the standard of pastoral care outside of the main burghs was totally inadequate.<ref>Oram, ''Moray & Badenoch'', p.&ensp;83</ref>
 
Bishop John Innes (1407&ndash;14) contributed greatly to the rebuilding process evidenced by his tomb with the inscription praising his efforts.  The major alterations to the west front was completed before 1435 and contains the arms of Bishop [[Columba de Dunbar]] (1422&ndash;35).  It is presumed that the choir aisles were finished before 1460 as it contains the tomb of John de Winchester (1435&ndash;60).  Probably, one of the last important rebuilding feature was the reshaping of the chapter house which contains the arms of Bishop Andrew Stewart (1482&ndash;1501).<ref>MacDonald, W. Rae: Notes on the Heraldry of Elgin and its Surrounding District, Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot. 1899 Vol. 34 pp.&ensp;344&ndash;429</ref>
 
===Chapter and deanery===
{{main|Bishop of Moray}}
{{main|Dean of Moray}}
Bishop Bricius set the cathedral rites by adopting those of Lincoln Cathedral for his chapter at Spynie with five dignataries and three canons &ndash; under the Lincoln constitution, the bishop sat in the chapter as an ordinary canon. <ref>Cant, ''Historic Elgin and Cathedral'', p.&ensp;22</ref>  His successor, Bishop Andreas greatly expanded the chapter by creating two additional hierarchical posts and adding fifteen more prebendary canons and just before his death, changed the rites to follow those of [[Salisbury Cathedral]].<ref name=Fawcett-6/>   On succeeding Bricius, Bishop Andreas de Moravia added two further prebendary canons; the church at Moy and the joint churches of Kinnoir and Dambannan.  With the upcoming move of the [[cathedra]] to Elgin, a large number of new prebends were created to cater for the very much enlarged establishment.<ref name=Cowan-206-7>Cowan & Easson, ''Medieval Houses'', pp.&ensp;206, 207</ref><ref name=Shaw-293-5>Shaw, Gordon, ''History of Moray'', pp.  293&ndash;295</ref>  At the time of the transfer of the cathedral from Spynie to Elgin in 1226, new creations in the hierarchy were established; those of succentor and subdean.<ref>Watt, ''Fasti'', pp 301, 304</ref>  The subdean received the church of Dallas as his prebend along with the altarage of Auldearn from the dean while the succenter, for his prebends, got Rafford from the precentor and Ardclach from the chancellor.  To compensate the chancellor, he gets the single prebend from the churches of Inveravon and Urquhart.<ref name=Cowan-206-7/><ref name=Shaw-293-5/>
 
In the Registry of Moray, it is noted that the four prebends of Rhynie, Inverketheney, Elchies with Botory and Advie with Cromdale had also been founded.<ref name=Cowan-206/> Around this time, Duthil was given by [[Gille Brigte, Earl of Strathearn]] and made a prebend.  Part of the vicarage of St Giles was added between 1222 and 1242 and its remainder between 1299 and 1325.  The result of all this was that a total of 23 prebends had been created.<ref name=Shaw-293-5/>   Two further prebends added a short time before the Reformation bringing the total number of canons to 25.

The Diocese of Moray had four deaneries that provided the mensal and prependal income not only for the cathedral but other religious houses both within the diocese and elsewhere.  These deaneries were Elgin, Inverness, Strathbogie and Strathspey.<ref>Watt, ''Fasti'', pp.&ensp;316, 317</ref>  Arbroath Abbey received the income from Inverness, Beauly Priory had that of Abertarf and Conveth while Pluscarden Priory had Daviot and Dores.<br style="clear:both;"/>

===Chanonry===
[[Image:Chanonry copy.jpg|175px|right|thumb|The chanonry showing some of the manses]]
The chanonry, referred to in the Registrium Episcacopatus Moravienses as the ''college of the chanonry'' or simply as the ''college'', was the collection of manses that surrounded the cathedral.<ref name=Cant-28-29>Cant, ''Historic Elgin and Cathedral'', p.&ensp;28, 29</ref>  Each canon or dignitary was responsible for providing his own manse which was built to reflect his status within the chapter.<ref name=Cant-28-29/> [[Image:Precenter'smanse.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The Precentor's Manse]]  A substantial wall, four metres high and two meters thick, surrounded the cathedral and manses, which not only delineated the sacred grounds from the secular, but was intended as a means of defence &ndash; only the manse of Rhynie lay outside the west wall.<ref>Cant, ''Historic Elgin and Cathedral'', p.&ensp;30</ref>  In 1242 there were 23 canons with a further two being added just before the Reformation so space was limited.  As well as the manse of Rhynie, the houses of 17 vicars and the many chaplains were also situated outside the west wall.<ref name=Cowan-206-7/>The wall had four doors, one of which, the Pans Port, still survives and shows that these gateways had portcullis installed.  The manse of the precenter, erroneously called the ''Bishop’s House'' can still be seen and is dated to 1557 while vestigages of two other manses are now part of modern dwellings &ndash; those of the North College (the dean's manse) and South College (the archdeacon's manse).<ref name=Oram-92>Oram, ''Moray & Badenoch'', p.&ensp;92</ref>  [[Edward I of England|King Edward I of England]] stayed at the manse of Duffus on 10 and 11 September 1303 as the castle was no longer in a fit state and King James II also stayed there in 1455.<ref>Taylor, ''Edward I in North Scotland'' pp 213,214</ref>
[[Image:Elgin Almshouse.jpg|thumb|150px|The almshouse date stone]] 
===Other religious orders===
The hospital of Maison Dieu, dedicated to St Mary, was situated close to the cathedral and was established by Bishop Andreas before 1237 for the aid of the poor.<ref name=Cowan-179>Cowan & Easson, ''Medieval Houses'', p.&ensp;179</ref>  It suffered twice by burning in 1390 and again in 1445.  Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin in 1520.<ref>Hall DW, MacDonald ADS, Perry DR & Terry J: The Archaeology of Elgin, Pro Soc Antiq Scot, Vol. 128 pp 817, 818</ref>  The property was taken into the ownership of the [[the Crown|Crown]] following the reformation and was granted to the burgh by [[King James VI of Scotland|James VI]] in 1595 for educational purposes and for helping the poor.<ref name=Cowan-179>  In 1624, an almshouse to replace the original hospital was constructed.<ref>Cant, Robert: Historic Elgin and its Cathedral, Elgin Society, 1974, p.&ensp;14</ref>  There were two monasteries, the Blackfriars in the west of the burgh, and the Greyfriars in the east; also, according to J Taylor, a preceptory of the [[Knights Templar]], a commandery of the Knights Hospitallers of St John and a house of the Brethren of St Lazuras that tended to the needs of lepers.<ref>Taylor, ''Edward I in North Scotland'', pp. 119&ndash;120</ref>

==Cathedral routine==
[[Image:Pansport.jpg|255px|thumb|right|The Pans Port]]
The medieval bishop’s status within the Church hierarchy was reflected in the buildings and fabric of his cathedral and by the daily rituals carried out within its walls.  So that these services could be fulfilled with due ceremony and respect for Church traditions, it was important that the cathedral was staffed with the correct number of clergy.<ref name=Cowan-206/>At Elgin, in 1242, it was decided that the rites of [[Salisbury Cathedral]] would be followed.  [[Image:Elgin Cathedral main entrance.jpg|left|thumb|215px|Cathedral main entrance before the Reformation]]  The main income to support the canons were from appropriations from the parish churches.  Eventually, around forty churches were designated to support individual canons and about six others were held in common for all of the canons and further to this, the income from fifteen other parishes was used directly for the upkeep of the bishop.<ref>Cowan, ''Parishes, Medieval Scotland'', pp.&ensp;217, 218</ref> Additionally, Andreas also allowed for the canons to be aided by seventeen vicars made up of seven priests, five deacons and five sub-deacons &ndash; later these vicars’ numbers were augmented to twenty five and by 1489 being paid a stipendiary ranging from five to twelve marks<ref name=Fawcett-6/> The vicars were of two types but there was overlap between them &ndash; these were vicars-choral and the chantry chaplains.<ref>Cant, ''Historic Elgin'', p.&ensp;30</ref>  The vicars-choral worked mainly in the choir and taking the main services of the cathedral while the chantry chaplains' main function was to perform services at the individual lesser foundation altars.<ref>Cant, ''Historic Elgin'', pp.&ensp;30, 31</ref>  [[Alexander II of Scotland|King Alexander II]] founded a chaplaincy for the soul of [[Duncan I of Scotland|King Duncan I]] who was killed by [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] near Elgin while the chapel most frequently referred to in records was that of [[Thomas Becket|St Thomas the Martyr]] in the north transept; it had five chaplains.<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'', pp.&ensp;6,7</ref>  Other chaplaincies mentioned are those of the Holy Rood, St Catherine, St Duthac, St Lawrence, St Mary Magdalene, St Mary the Virgin and St Michael.<ref name=Fawcett-7>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'', p.&ensp;7</ref> By the time of Bishop Bur's episcopate, the cathedral had 15 canons, 22 vicars-choral and about the same amount of chaplains. <ref>Mackintosh, ''Elgin Past and Present'', 42</ref>
Despite these numbers, all of the clergy were not present at the services.  Indeed absence was an enduring fact of life in all cathedrals in a period when those seeking career advancement would accept prebends from more than one cathedral.<ref name=Fawcett-6>  This is not to say that the time spent away from the chanonry was without permission.  Some canons were appointed to be always present while others were allowed to attend on a part time basis.<ref name=Dalyell-13-14>Dalyell, ''Records of Bishopric of Moray'' <ref />  The dean was permanently in attendance while the precentor, chancellor and treasurer were available for half the year; the non-permanent canons had to attend continuously for 3 months.<ref name=Dalyell-13-14/>  However, in 1240, Elgin decided to penalise persistently absent canons who broke the terms of their attendance by removing one seventh of their income.<ref>Dowden, ''Bishops of Scotland'' p.&ensp;79 </ref>  The bulk of the workload fell on the shoulders of the vicars and a small number of canons who were responsible for celebrating high mass and for leading and arranging sermons and feast day processions.  A total of seven services were held daily some of which were solely for the clergy and those took place behind the rood screen; this separated the high alter and choir from lay worshipers.  Each morning, the canons held a meeting in the chapter house where a chapter from the canonical rule book written by [[Benedict of Nursia|St Benedict]] was read and thus providing the origin of the name.<ref>Historic Scotland, ''Investigating Elgin Cathedral'', p.&ensp;10</ref>
 
An unknown number of lawyers and clerks were also employed to assist in the cathedral functions.  For the upkeep of the cathedral church and manses, there were masons, carpenters, glaziers and plumbers continuously employed &ndash; Master Gregory the mason and Master Richard the glazier are mentioned in the Registery of Moray.<ref>Cant, ''Historic Elgin and Cathedral'', p.&ensp;31</ref>

==Post Reformation==
[[Image:Elgin Cathedral reconstruct.jpg|thumb|165px|right|Cathedral as it would have appeared at the Reformation.]]
In August 1560, parliament rejected the authority of the pope over the Scottish Church and the [[Mass]], as the fundamental act of worship, was abolished.<ref name=Fawcett-7/>  However, the office of bishop was not ended until 1689.  The evolving church was generally unsympathetic to most of the previous episcopal practices and to cathedrals as centres of worship.  The cathedrals that survived did so because they also doubled as parish churches however they had the trappings of [[Roman Catholic]]ism swiftly removed; Elgin had the parish church of St Giles which meant that the cathedral was surplus to requirements.<ref>Oram, ''Moray & Badenoch'', p.&ensp;93</ref> It is evident that the use of the cathedral must have ceased fairly soon after the [[Reformation]] parliament's decisions.  An Act of parliament passed on 14 February 1567 authorising [[Regent]] [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Lord James Stewart's]] [[Privy Council]] to order the removal of the lead from the roofs of both Elgin and [[Aberdeen]] cathedrals and to be sold for the upkeep of his army &ndash; the ship that was destined to take the cargo to Holland was so overladen that it sunk in Aberdeen harbour.<ref>Shaw, Gordon, ''History of Moray'', pp.&ensp;284,285</ref>

==Decay and ruination==
[[Image:Elgin Cathedral plan.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cathedral floor plan]] 
In 1615, [[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor]], the ‘Water Poet’ wrote:<ref>Brown, ''Early Travellers in Scotland'', p.&ensp;124</ref> <blockquote> ''a faire and beautiful church with three steeples, the walls of it and the steeples all yet standing; but the roofes, windowes and many marble monuments and tombes of honourable and worthie personages all broken and defaced.'' </blockquote>  Decay was setting in and on 4 December 1637, the roof of the eastern limb collapsed during a gale.<ref>Shaw, Gordon, ''History of Moray'' p.&ensp;285 </ref>  Even by this time not all of the fixtures of the old religion had been removed, the most prominent of which was the rood screen.  Determined to remedy this, the minister of St Giles kirk, Mr Gilbert Ross along with the lairds of Innes and Brodie pulled it down and chopped it up for firewood.<ref>Shaw, Gordon, ''History of Moray'', pp.&ensp;290, 291</ref>  
 
At some point the cathedral grounds had become the burial ground for Elgin and because of this the Town Council arranged for the boundary wall to be repaired in 1685 &ndash; significantly the council ordered that the stones from the cathedral should not be used for this purpose.<ref>Cramond, ''Records of Elgin'', p.&ensp;337</ref> Although the building was becoming increasingly decayed, some parts of it continued to be utilised with the chapter house being used for the meetings of the Incorporated Trades from 1671 to 1676 and then again from 1701 to around 1731.<ref>Mackintosh, ''Elgin Past and Present'', p.68</ref> No attempt at stabilising the decay was carried out and on Easter Sunday 1711 the central tower buckled and fell demoilishing the nave and heralding 'quarrying' of stone work for local projects.<ref>Oram, ''Moray & Badenoch'', p.&ensp;93</ref>  Many artists came to Elgin to sketch the ruins and it is from these that the slow but continuing ruination can be observed.<ref name=Fawcett-11>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'', p.&ensp;11</ref>  By the closing years of the 18th century, travellers stopping in Elgin would visit the ruin.  Pamphlets giving the history of the cathedral were prepared for the early tourist and in 1773 Samuel Johnson recorded:<ref>Johnson, ''Journey to Western Isles'' p.&ensp;19</ref> <blockquote> ''a paper was put into our hands, which deduced from sufficient authorities the history of this venerable ruin''</blockquote>
 
[[Image:West window.jpg|235px|thumb|<small>West towers' central window showing remaining tracery indicating a rose window on top with probably seven arched windows below</small>]]
The ruins consist of three main areas.  These are the western towers, the eastern limb with the adjoining chapterhouse and the south transept.  The west front has the two buttressed towers standing to a height of 27.4m but originally topped by wooden spires covered in protective lead and date from the 13th century.<ref name=Oram-87>Oram, ''Moray & Badenoch'', p.87</ref>  It is thought that the towers were not part of the original design as is evidenced by the differing base course construction to that of the transepts, however it is likely that the integration of the nave and towers was carried out while the 13th century construction was still evolving.<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'' p.&ensp;15</ref>  The great west door is centred between the towers and capped with three gablets.  The internal division of the entrance was inserted in the late 14th or early 15th century and has intricate carvings of branches, vines, acorns and oak leaves.<ref name=Oram-87/>  Above the door is a large pointed arch opening in the gable that contained a large sequence of windows, the uppermost of which was a circular or rose window.  This window was rebuilt between 1422 and 1436 and just above it can be seen three coats of arms; on the right is that of the Bishopric of Moray, in the middle are the royal arms of Scotland and on the left is the armorial shield of Bishop Columba Dunbar).<ref name=Oram-87/>
[[Image:Towers nave junction.jpg|235px|thumb|left|<small>The detail of the junction of the nave and the two towers</small>]]
The nave whose walls are now very low or even foundation level excepting one small section in the south wall which is near its original height.  This section has windows that appear to date from the 15th century to replace the 13th century openings and may have been carried out following the 1390 attack.<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'' p.&ensp;60</ref>  Nothing of the elevated structure of the nave remains but its appearance can be deduced from the markings to be seen where it attached to the eastern walls of the towers, however, nothing of the crossing now remains as it was destroyed when central tower collapsed in 1711.<ref>Oram, ''Moray & Badenoch'', p.&ensp;89</ref> [[Image:Chapterhouse north trancept.jpg|235px|thumb|right|<small>The octagonal chapterhouse on the left, the quire in background showing the indications of the now missing aisle of St Columba and the free standing buttress of the north transept to the right.</small>]]
The eastern extension comprising the quire and presbytery appears to have been nearly doubled in length following the fire of 1270 with simultaneous wide aisles built on each side.<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'' pp.&ensp;17, 18</ref> These aisles run the length of the quire and passed the first bay of the presbytery.  Elgin Cathedral is unique in Scotland for having an English style octagonal chapterhouse and French influenced double aisles along each side of the nave &ndash; only [[Chichester Cathedral]], in England have similar aisles.<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'' p.&ensp;18</ref> <ref>Cant, ''Historic Elgin and Cathedral'', p.&ensp;25</ref>  The chapterhouse attaches to the quire through a short vaulted vestry and is 10.3m high at its apex and 11.3m from wall to opposite wall.  A single pillar gives support to the vaulted roof.  It was re-built by Bishop Andrew Stewart (1482&ndash;1501) whose coat of arms is placed in the central pillar.<ref>Oram, ''Moray & Badenoch'', p.&ensp;92</ref>  The fact that it took until Bishop Andrew's episcapy to carry out these repairs demonstrates how extensively damaged the 1390 attack had been<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'', p.&ensp;62</ref>
 
Only one buttress of the north transept still remains, but the south transept's south wall is nearly intact providing an idea of what the north transept would have looked like.  These buildings  are original to the first construction dating to the early 13th Century.  The south transept was built in a plain, simplistic style although the strongest architectural emphasis was given to the front of the transept.<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'', pp.&ensp;21&ndash;26</ref>  Both transepts were used as chapels and had recessed tombs.<ref>Oram, ''Moray & Badenoch'', p.&ensp;90</ref>

==Stabilisation==
Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place.  It was Elgin Town Council that showed the first signs of recognising the need to stabilise the structure firstly by rebuilding the surrounding wall in 1809 and in around 1815 the debris around the remaining walls were cleared.<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'', pp.&ensp;9, 11</ref>  [[Image:Elgin Cathedral renovation.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Replaced blockwork in walls]]The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrencer for assistance for a new roof for the chapter house and in 1824 £121 was provided to Robert Reid, the future Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW), for its construction &ndash; Reid was significant in the development of conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and achieved the setting up of the SOW in 1827.<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'', p.&ensp;12</ref>  It was during Reid’s tenure at the head of the SOW that supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built. [[Image:John Shanks.jpg|thumb|250px|right|John Shanks]]In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and probably the most important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work.  Sponsored by local gentleman, Isaac Forsyth, Shanks was to clear the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble.<ref>Shaw, Gordon, ''History of Moray'', p.&ensp;290</ref> Shanks was officially appointed Keeper and Watchman in 1826 and though his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his clearance work had not been carried out scientifically so there is no way of knowing if any valuable evidence of the cathedral’s history had been lost.<ref name=Fawcett-11/>  On his death in 1841, the Inverness Courier printed:<ref>Inverness Courier extract</ref> <Blockquote> ''April 28. &ndash; John Shanks, the beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral, died on the 14th inst. in the eighty-third year of his age. His unwearied enthusiasm in clearing away the rubbish which encumbered the area of the Cathedral and obscured its architectural beauties, may be gathered from the fact that he removed, with his pick-axe and shovel, 2866 barrowfuls of earth, besides disclosing a flight of steps that led to the grand gateway of the edifice. Tombs and figures, which had long lain hid in obscurity, were unearthed and every monumental fragment of saints and holy men was carefully preserved, and placed in some appropriate situation.....  So faithfully did he discharge his duty as keeper of the ruins, that little now remains but to preserve what he accomplished.'' </blockquote>
 
In 1847&ndash;48 some of the old houses associated with the cathedral on the west side were demolished and a series of relatively minor changes to the boundary wall were completed.  Major consolidation of the structure and some reconstruction work began in the early 20th century.  This included restoration of the east gable rose window in 1904 and also the replacement of the missing form pieces and mullions and decorative ribs in the window in the north-east wall of the chapter house.<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'', p.&ensp;86</ref>  By 1913 work to re-point the walls and additional waterproofing of the wall tops were completed.  Lowering of the ground level and the repositioning of the tomb of the Earl of Huntly which had been a 17th century construction took place in 1924.<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'', p.&ensp;71</ref> Further repairs and restoration occurred during the 1930’s including partly dismantling some of the 19th century buttressing, rebuilding sections of the nave piers using recovered pieces and the roofing of the vault in the south choir in 1939.<ref>Fawcett, ''Elgin Cathedral'', pp.&ensp;12,13</ref>  During the last forty years of the 20th century there was unremitting replacement of crumbling stonework.  Between 1976 and 1988, the chapter house window tracery was gradually replaced and its re-roofing completed the process.  Floors, glazing and a new roof were added to the south-west tower between 1988 and 1998 and the same procedure was applied to the north-west tower in 1998 to 2000.
