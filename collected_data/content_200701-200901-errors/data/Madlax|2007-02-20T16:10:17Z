{{nihongo|'''Madlax'''|マドラックス|Madorakkusu}} is a 26-episode [[anime]] [[television series]] produced in [[2004 in television|2004]] by the [[Bee Train]] animation studio. The [[DVD]] version was released in [[North America]] by [[ADV Films]], and as of November 2006, it airs on the [[Anime Network]] channel.  According to the director [[Kōichi Mashimo]], the title is a [[portmanteau]] of two [[English language|English]] words: ''[[wiktionary:mad|MAD]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:relax|reLAXed]]'', mirroring the authors' intention to portray the two extremes of human being.<ref name="Wong" />

The story revolves around two young women, who, at first glance, have nothing in common, nor know of each other's existence. The first and titular heroine is Madlax, a living legend among the mercenaries and assassins in Gazth-Sonika, a small [[Asia]]n country torn by a [[civil war]]. "Madlax" is a [[code name]] and a substitute for her real one, forgotten along with the rest of her past before 1999, when the war started. The second girl is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy [[aristocrat]]ic family in the peaceful [[Europe]]an country of Nafrece. Twelve years before the story begins, an [[airliner]] her mother and she were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret's father who lead the [[rescue]]rs, have been missing ever since. Margaret managed to travel back to Nafrece on her own, though how she made it remains a mystery because she has lost her memories prior to her return, save one word: "Madlax". This seemingly thin thread linking the two girls turns out to be a much more intense connection when they both independently start investigating the powerful [[crime syndicate]] Enfant and its enigmatic mastermind, who, for some reason, shows interest in both of them. 

The critics have pointed out multiple similarities between ''Madlax'' and ''[[Noir (TV series)|Noir]]'',<ref name="AJ_V1_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animejump.com/index.php?module=prodreviews&func=showcontent&id=662|title=''Madlax'' DVD #1 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Carter, Jason|date=[[2005-07-20]]|publisher=''AnimeJump.com''}}</ref><ref name="ANN_V1_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=747|title=''Madlax'' DVD #1 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Martin, Theron|date=[[2005-05-06]]|publisher=''[[Anime News Network]]''}}</ref> an earlier work by the same studio, and according to the authors, these two series are the first installments of a planned [[trilogy]] exploring the so-called girls-with-guns [[genre]],<ref name="Wong">{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=A.|title=Inside Bee Train|journal=[[Newtype USA]]|pages=8-15|date=[http://www.newtype-usa.com/issues/index.php?itemid=71 March 2005]}}</ref><ref name="GWG">See also the article about the [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Girls-with-guns girls-with-guns] on ''Bee Train Fan Wiki''.</ref> with the third title being the recently announced ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja|El Cazador]]''.<ref name="ANS_EC_news">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsservice.com/archives/janx.htm|title=January 3-10 News|accessdate=2007-01-19|date=[[2007-01-06]]|publisher=''Anime News Service''|quote=''Following Noir and Madlax, this [El Cazador] will be the thrid <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> installment in a series of what Director Koichi Mashimo has referred to as his girls-with-guns genre trilogy.''}}</ref> Still, ''Madlax'' differs considerably from its predecessor, as it is very plot driven, pays much attention to the interaction of various factions rather than individual characters,<ref name="DV_V2_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/madlaxvol2.php|title=''Madlax'' DVD #2 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Hattaway, Mitchell|date=[[2005-09-01]]|publisher=''DVDVerdict.com''|quote=''...every new twist only strengthens the plot.

{{nihongo|'''Margaret Burton'''|マーガレット・バートン|Māgaretto Bāton}} is a 17-year old schoolgirl attending to an elite private [[high school]] in Nafrece. She is sleepy, clumsy, and often alienated from the world around her, if it were not for her maidservant [[List of Madlax characters#Elenore Baker|Elenore Baker]], she would have a lot of trouble, even in Nafrece.<ref name="ep6">''Madlax'', episode 6 ([http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/5309.php summary]).</ref> Margaret is an [[amnesia]]c as she does not remember anything about her life prior to twelve years ago when she returned home from Gazth-Sonika - in fact, she has even forgotten how to speak, therefore "Madlax" (the only word she remembered) is an important link to her past. Another link is a "[[picture book]]" stained with blood that she brought with her from Gazth-Sonika and which, Margaret firmly believes, was given to her by her father.

''Madlax'', episode 1 (3:23).</ref> Just like Margaret, she remembers next to nothing of her life before twelve years ago, except the word "Madlax", which she accepted as her [[code name]]. Unlike Margaret, she has not lost the ability to communicate, and vaguely remembers an [[flashback|image]] of her father walking away from her. She possesses her father's military [[dog tag (identifier)|dog tag]], but the name on it is illegible. Twelve years ago, Madlax was picked up by [[List of Madlax characters#SSS|SSS]] who trained her as a mercenary (wherein she displayed almost supernatural abilities) and she has been working in Gazth-Sonika ever since, hoping one day to find her father and her lost self.

{{nihongo|'''Vanessa Rene'''|ヴァネッサ・レネ|Vanessa Rene}} is Margaret's former neighbor and tutor and currently, a successful [[manager]] at Bookwald Industries. Half of the efforts to return Margaret back to normal after her "trip" to Gazth-Sonika is attributed to her (the other half was Elenore Baker's).<ref name="ep6_VanEl">'''Elenore:''' "Miss Vanessa, as her tutor you gave her culture and education.

=== Plot summary ===
{{main|Fictional setting of Madlax|Plot summary of Madlax}}
{{spoiler}}

The series starts off with the two female leads living completely separate lives. Madlax works as a [[special forces|special ops]] agent for hire in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, while Margaret enjoys the tranquility of Nafrece. When a "picture book", presumably given to Margaret by her late father, attracts attention of an international [[crime syndicate]] Enfant, she starts researching its origins and discovers that they lie in Gazth-Sonika. Enfant's top operative, Carrossea Doon, tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction - towards Madlax, who has been causing Enfant trouble in Gazth-Sonika for some time. Meanwhile, Vanessa Rene, Margaret's former tutor, discovers that her employer, Bookwald Industries, covertly supports the [[civil war]] in Gazth-Sonika by supplying both sides with [[firearm]]s, so she seizes the opportunity to find more about the true [[casus belli]]. Her investigation brings her to Gazth-Sonika, where Madlax is assigned as her [[bodyguard]], and together, they uncover data that definitely proves that Enfant orchestrated the entire conflict. Enfant intercepts them and forces into hiding. Back in Nafrece, Margaret decides to travel to Gazth-Sonika to help Vanessa and is accompanied by her maidservant Elenore Baker and Carrossea Doon. 

Eventually, Madlax and Margaret encounter each other and embark on a search for [[List of Madlax characters#Quanzitta Marison|Quanzitta Marison]], a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who may know something about Margaret's book, Enfant's involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a [[total war]], starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Friday Monday (Enfant's leader) possesses [[supernatural]] powers connected to the [[Fictional setting of Madlax#Holy Books|three ancient books]], one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret has supernatural abilities, too, and decides to use them to return her lost memories. Failing to complete the proper [[ritual]], Carrossea, who has been supporting her, dies, and she herself is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to complete his own goals. 

[[Image:Laetitia, Margaret and Madlax.jpg|thumb|200px|Three personae of Margaret Burton]]

While Margaret and Carrossea perform the ritual, Madlax is attacked by her [[arch-nemesis]] Limelda Jorg, who accidentally kills Vanessa while targeting Madlax, sending the latter into [[clinical depression]]. Never the less, Elenore and Lady Quanzitta's servant [[List of Madlax characters#Nakhl|Nakhl]] manage to restore Madlax's will to live and persuade her to save Margaret, and the three storm Enfant's [[headquarters]] together. During the assault, Elenore is killed and Margaret, now under Monday's control, shoots Madlax. Believing her to be dead, Monday commences a ritual to start a new [[world war]] but as a result, Margaret's memories return and she snaps out of his [[mind control]]. It is revealed that back in 1999, Monday drove Margaret's father insane with his powers and she was forced to kill her own parent. To escape the sin of [[patricide]], Margaret had split herself into three personae: the "memory keeper" [[List of Madlax characters#Laetitia|Laetitia]], the sinful Madlax, and Margaret herself. After the revelation, Madlax reappears and guns down Monday, then Margaret fuses the three personae to undo the ritual she unwillingly performed and stop the global war. Upon accomplishing that, she once again splits herself in three, judging that after twelve years, she no longer has the right to make decisions for her other personae.

On the other hand, ''Madlax'' can be interpreted as a story of [[List of Madlax characters#Margaret Burton|Margaret Burton]]'s search for a [[psychological identity]]: for example, based on the available to her Mashimo Menu theme titles,<ref name="Mmenu">See also the article about [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Mashimo_Menu Mashimo Menu] on ''Bee Train Fan Wiki''.</ref> Yuki Kajiura has once suggested that while searching for her memories, Margaret meets the other characters ("Gatekeepers") one after another and gets to know the lifestyles ("Gates") they represent.

[[Image:Madlax and Vanessa.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Madlax and Vanessa]]

Overall, ''Madlax'' does not depict obvious [[lesbian]] relationships but has gained fame among the [[yuri (animation)|yuri]] fandom,<ref name="SAA-Madlax">A [[fanfic]] collection about ''[http://www.shoujoai.com/fanfics/madlax/ Madlax]'' and ''[http://www.shoujoai.com/fanfics/noir/ Noir]''.

According to the director [[Kōichi Mashimo]], he has always envisioned ''Noir'' and ''Madlax'' as part of a trilogy belonging to the girls-with-guns genre,<ref name="GWG" /> and soon after the release of the latter, he has revealed that the third installment is already being planned.<ref name="Wong" /> In late 2002, Mashimo invited [[Shigeru Kitayama]], the producer of ''Noir'' who once came up with its original idea, to discuss a new series entitled ''Madlax''. Kitayama greatly expanded Mashimo's original [[screenplay]] plan, but it was not until [[Yousuke Kuroda]] was put in charge of the script that the series took its final appearance. It took Kuroda about one year to finish the screenplays for all 26 episodes, during which he was constantly encouraged by Mashimo to add his own original ideas to their initial plan. Kuroda has admitted that at the time he received Mashimo's invitation, he felt frustrated after his first project has been canceled by the publisher, so he decided to make ''Madlax'' "really extravagant", blending as many [[genre]]s at once as he could. Kōichi Mashimo once admitted that the most unusual [[plot twist]]s, like Margaret and Madlax's connection to each other, were invented by Kuroda and him in a state of [[alcohol intoxication]].<ref name="Wong" />

By comparison with ''Noir'', ''Madlax'' features a much larger primary cast, including multiple recurring male [[fictional character|character]]s, who were effectively absent in the former. It was not so in the original screenplay [[draft document|draft]] written by Mashimo and Kitayama: for example, "Madlax" was Margaret's own [[nickname]] and [[List of Madlax characters#Charlie|Charlie]] (Vanessa's colleague at Bookwald Industries) had one of the central roles similar to Speedy's in ''[[Avenger (anime)|Avenger]]''.

{{main|List of Madlax episodes}}
Originally, ''Madlax'' was broadcast in Japan by [[TV Tokyo]] from [[5 April]] to [[27 September]] [[2004]], from 1:30 to 2:00 AM every Tuesday (formally, Monday night).<ref name="TVT_lineup">{{cite web|url=http://www.c-direct.ne.jp/tvtokyo/eng/pg_lineup/pdf/2004_april.pdf|title=Program lineup|accessdate=2006-10-29|format=PDF|date=[[April 2004]]|publisher=''[[TV Tokyo]]''}}</ref> Shortly before the series finished airing, it has been licensed in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] by [[ADV Films]],<ref name="ADV_PR">{{cite web|url=http://www.advfilms.com/GEN_PRDetails.asp?ID=1586|title=Official  press release|accessdate=2006-10-29|date=[[2004-09-28]]|publisher=''[[ADV Films]]''}}</ref> who has previously licensed ''Noir''. The official English [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] has been released under the [[trademark]] ''MADLAX'' on a total of seven [[DVD]]s from 12 April 2005 to 28 March 2006 and received a TV-14 [[television rating system#United States|rating]], though it has been lowered to TV-PG for the consequent [[cable network]] broadcast.<ref name="IMDb">{{imdb title|id=0465339|title=Madlax}}. Retrieved on [[2006-10-29]].</ref> ''Madlax'' has become the first series on which ADV Films' director and producer [[David Williams (producer)|David Williams]] tested the technology of distributing [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]]al materials via [[P2P network]] [[BitTorrent]].<ref name="BT-promo">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=7026|title=''ADV Bittorrent Test''|accessdate=2006-10-29|date=[[2005-07-14]]|publisher=''[[Anime News Network]]''}}</ref>

The North-American DVD release contains extras available in English only, such the controversial ''Conversations with SSS'' <ref name="DV_V1_rev" /><ref name="DV_V7_rev" /><ref name="AoD_V7_rev" /> and ''Sock Puppet Theater'', an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] [[live action]] about Madlax going after [[Chris Patton]], [[List of Madlax characters#Badgis|Badgis]]' voice actor and an annoying [[womanizer]].<ref name="ANN_V67_rev" /> To access the latter, one should press "Up", "Down", "Left", and "Right" buttons when the second eye-catch of episode 21 (DVD volume #6) comes on.

Since [[7 February]] [[2006]], ''Madlax'' is aired on [[Anime Network]] (which is, like ADV Films, a subsidiary of [[A.D. Vision]]) on Tuesdays from 20:00 to 20:30 (each episode is repeated on 23:00 the same day and on 19:30 the next Tuesday). On 4 April, shortly after the last DVD volume has been released, the consequent broadcast was put on halt and until 27 June, only the first 8 episodes were repeated. Since then, the series has been relaunched twice: on 1 August and 7 November 2006.<ref name="AN-air">[[Anime Network]] program lineup for [http://www.theanimenetwork.com/testsched_GEH.php?schedday=2006-02-07 7 February], [http://www.theanimenetwork.com/testsched_GEH.php?schedday=2006-06-27 27 June], [http://www.theanimenetwork.com/testsched_GEH.php?schedday=2006-08-01 1 August], and

=== Music ===
[[Image:Madlax OST I cover.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The cover of the first ''Madlax'' soundtrack album]]
Like with many other studio [[Bee Train]]'s works (first of all, ''Noir''), the entire ''Madlax'' [[soundtrack]] was composed by the famous [[Yuki Kajiura]], marking it her and Kōichi Mashimo's fifth project together. Kajiura and [[Yuuka Nanri]]'s duo [[FictionJunction YUUKA]] has recorded the series' opening and ending themes, {{nihongo|"Fragments of an Eye"|瞳の欠片|Hitomi no Kakera}} and "inside your heart", respectively, as well as two insert songs: "nowhere" and "I'm here". Aside from the opening sequence, "Fragments of an Eye" is featured in the series itself: at the end of episode 18 and in the episode 24, when Margaret is humming its tune (along with another song called "Cradle") to herself in the flower field.

The entire OST has been released on two [[album]]s in 2004. Two [[single (music)|single]]s were published in the same year by FictionJunction YUUKA, each containing an opening/ending theme and one insert song, as well as their respective [[karaoke]] versions.<ref name="OST">See also the complete track listings for  [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Madlax_OST_I OST 1], [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Madlax_OST_II OST 2], [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Madlax_OP_Single OP-single], [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Madlax_ED_Single ED-single] on ''Bee Train Fan Wiki''.</ref>

In the insert song "nowhere", there is a frequently repeated background [[refrain]] {{nihongo|"Yanmaani"|ヤンマーニ|Yanmāni}}, which is not a word at all, just meaningless [[chant]]ing. Since the song usually plays when Madlax is fighting, "Yanmaani" has become something of a joke to many ''Madlax'' fans: its loud singing has come to symbolize Madlax's apparent invincibility - some see it as a kind of "[[magic word]]" that powers Madlax up for battle, in accordance with the [[magical girl]] genre canons.<ref name="DVDBooklet" />

''MADLAX the Bible'' (ISBN 4-89425-375-5) is a 95-page [[artbook]] that was published in Japan on [[21 May]] [[2005]] by [[Hobby Japan]].<ref name="Oc_MtB">{{cite web|url=http://www.otaku.com/cgi-bin/itemview.asp?itemid=67448N|title=''Madlax the Bible''|accessdate=2006-10-29|publisher=''Otaku.com''}}</ref> Aside from color and [[black and white (colours)|BW]] illustrations and artworks for the series, it contains interviews with its authors and [[seiyū]]s, as well as diverse additional information about the show in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref name="MtB">{{cite web|url=http://www.hobbyjapan.co.jp/madlax/|title=''Madlax the Bible''|accessdate=2006-10-29|publisher=''[[Hobby Japan]]''}}</ref> The artbook has never been published outside of Japan.

Unlike ''Noir'', that became instantly successful in Japan and Western countries despite controversial opinions about it, ''Madlax'' has never been able to match it in fame and received only moderate (though generally approving) attention from the critics. It has often been accused of being secondary and reusing many of ''Noir'''s stylistic solutions, such as the story [[premise (film)|premise]], the two heroines' appearance, and musical performance,<ref name="ANN_V1_rev" /> but on the other hand, the story as a whole was praised for being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor's, in other words, because its episodes and [[subplot]]s are tightly intertwined and held together by the primary [[A-Plot]].<ref name="AoD_V7_rev" /> By comparison, most of the "middle" episodes in ''Noir'' can be separated into [[story arc]]s, which are only loosely connected to each other.

The majority of reviewers has perceived the early episodes of ''Madlax'' as boring and too slow-paced (many have claimed the same of nearly all ''Noir'' episodes, as well),<ref name="AJ_V1_rev" /> but the same critics later remarked that the prolonged [[exposition (plot device)|exposition]] is crucial to the unusual [[finale]] of the series, which fully establishes the series' own identity and sets it apart from other competitors.<ref name="ANN_V67_rev" /><ref name="AoD_V7_rev" /><ref name="DV_V6_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/madlaxvol6.php|title=''Madlax'' DVD #6 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Hattaway, Mitchell|date=[[2006-02-07]]|publisher=''DVDVerdict.com''|quote=''Sure, at first glance Madlax appears to be nothing more than another run-of-the-mill girls-with-guns anime, but this series goes a long way to proving that the devil's in the details. <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> Unless they really blow things at the end, this will go down as one terrific series.''}}</ref> According to them, after the initial volume, the story gets better and better with every new episode,<ref name="AoD_V4_rev" /><ref name="DV_V3_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/madlaxvol3.php|title=''Madlax'' DVD #3 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Hattaway, Mitchell|date=[[2005-09-15]]|publisher=''DVDVerdict.com''|quote=''This series keeps getting better and better. <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> I keep waiting for Madlax to implode, but it somehow manages to keep on chugging along.''}}</ref> though some have been dissatisfied with its "pseudo-[[existentialism|existentialistic]]" ending.<ref name="DV_V7_rev" /> 

The initial slow pacing, especially compared to the first episodes of ''Noir'',<ref name="ANN_V1_rev" /> is the main reason why the audience often dropped watching ''Madlax'' before it could present its more exciting and interesting story turns,<ref name="THEM_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=817|title=''Madlax'' (first two episodes) review|accessdate=2007-01-10|author=Ross, Carlos|publisher=''THEM Anime Reviews''|quote=''Maybe future episodes will prove me wrong, but for now, Madlax is frustratingly mediocre and extremely difficult to find the motivation to continue.''}}</ref> which eventually resulted in the moderate success of the series. Among other suggested reasons of the show's rather mediocre popularity were following:<ref name="BTFF_reasons">{{cite web|url=http://www.beetrainfan.org/forum/index.php?topic=224.0|title=''Madlax'' obscurity discussion|accessdate=2006-11-09|publisher=''BeeTrainFan.org''}}</ref>

* Market saturation. Since [[2001 in television|2001]], other studios have tried to repeat the success of ''Noir'', so when ''Madlax'' was aired, its style was no longer unique and it was harder to attract attention to itself. An expectable prejudice against a "''Noir'' [[remake]]", found among the fans of the first series, played a certain role.<ref name="AJ_V1_rev" />
* Unconventional genre. An untraditional blend of mystical [[science fiction]] and ''Noir''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s strict realism prevented ''Madlax'' from gaining popularity among the [[fandom]]s of both these macro-genres.<ref name="AoD_V6_rev" />
* Lack of polarizing effect. Unlike ''Noir'', that has been [[polarization|polarizing]] its viewers into two camps, fans and detesters, for years, ''Madlax'' has spawned much more diverse opinions and, thus, failed to achieve the [[cult television|cult status]].

The professional reviewers welcomed the increased number of sympathetic characters,<ref name="AoD_V6_rev" /> especially of the distinguishable male ones (Friday, Carrossea, Colonel Burton), as opposed to [[stormtrooper effect|stormtrooper]]-like operatives of Soldats in ''Noir'',<ref name="AJ_V1_rev" /> but it has been observed that female character designs are much more detailed (to the point of subtle [[fanservice]] in case of Madlax) than more generic male ones.<ref name="ANN_V67_rev" /> On the negative side, some named the episodes that involve [[computer]] use and [[computer crime|hacking]], criticizing them for lack of realism (admittedly, it's a common problem in fiction).<ref name="AoD_V3_rev" />

In terms of soundtrack, ''Madlax'' has not become as innovative as ''Noir'',<ref name="AA_OST1_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.activeanime.com/html/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2343|title=''Madlax OST I'' review|accessdate=2006-10-29||author=Salandanan, Rommel|date=[[2005-11-14]]|publisher=''ActiveAnime.com''}}</ref> with critics suggesting its OST to be a blend of ''Noir'' and ''[[.hack//Sign]]'' styles.<ref name="ANN_V2_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=773|title=''Madlax'' DVD #2 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Martin, Theron|date=[[2005-06-28]]|publisher=''[[Anime News Network]]''|quote=''The musical scoring, which sounds like a mix of Noir and .hack//SIGN <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>,..''}}</ref> Nevertheless, the reviewers admitted its superiority over the majority of contemporary works.<ref name="AJ_V1_rev" /><ref name="ANN_V1_rev" /> The English translation released by ''ADV Films'' has been praised for keeping most of series' original stylistic aspects preserved and inviting veteran voice actors for the dub.<ref name="AoD_V4_rev" /> Reviewers went as far as to suggest that certain English voices (especially Mike Kleinhenz's) match the characters better than the Japanese ones.<ref name="ANN_V67_rev" />
