'''James Dale Guckert''' (born [[1957]]) worked under the [[pseudonym]] '''Jeff Gannon''' as a [[White House]] reporter between 2003 and 2005 , representing the [[virtual organization]] [[Talon News]]. 

Gannon first gained national attention during a presidential press conference on [[January 26]], [[2005]], in which he asked [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[George W. Bush]] a question that some in the press corps considered "so friendly it might have been planted."<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Editor and Publisher |title=Congresswoman Asks for Probe After 'Gannon' Quits WH Reporting Post |date=2005-02-09}}</ref> Gannon stated that this question was not meant to be friendly, but to expose the hypocrisy of the [[left-wing politics|left]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Gannon then came under public scrutiny, in particular for his lack of a significant journalistic background prior to his work with Talon<ref name="globefriendly">{{cite news| last = Savage| first = Charlie| coauthors = Alan Wirzbicki| title = White House-friendly reporter under scrutiny| work = Boston Globe| date = [[2005-02-02]]| url =http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2005/02/02/white_house_friendly_reporter_under_scrutiny?pg=full| accessdate = 2007-05-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Boehlert |authorlink=Eric Boehlert |title="Jeff Gannon's" secret life |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/02/15/guckert/print.html |work=[[Salon.com|Salon]] |date=[[2005-02-15]] |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> and his alleged involvement with various [[homosexual]] [[escort agency|escort service]] websites using the professional name '''Bulldog''', he resigned from Talon News on [[February 8]], [[2005]]. Continuing to use the name Gannon, he has since created his own official homepage and worked for a time as a columnist for the ''[[Washington Blade]]'' newspaper, where he came out as [[gay]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Gannon_comes_out_Former_escort_conservative_0506.html | title=Gannon comes out: Former escort, conservative reporter grilled on White House visits | publisher=[[The Raw Story]] | date=May 5, 2006 | accessdate=2006-09-07}}. "Rogers went farther: 'Are you a gay man?' 'Absolutely, but I'm not proud' Gannon said."</ref>

Gannon routinely obtained daily passes to White House briefings. He attended four Bush press conferences and appeared regularly at White House press briefings. Although he did not qualify for a Congressional [[press pass]], Gannon was given daily passes to White House press briefings "after supplying his real name, date of birth and [[Social Security number]]."<ref name="washpost218">{{cite news

Gannon currently operates a [[blog]], [http://www.jeffgannon.com/ JeffGannon.com], on which he criticizes perceived [[double standard]]s used by both the "Old Media" and the "Angry Gay Left."<ref>{{cite web|title=Another Gay Martyr (Or Two) Is Born | publisher = JeffGannon.com | date=March 12, 2007 | url=http://www.jeffgannon.com/archives/general/index.html#a000888 | accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> He recently published a book entitled, "The Great Media War."

==Background==
Jeff Gannon was a member of the [[Alpha Chi Rho]] fraternity when he attended [[West Chester University of Pennsylvania]] in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], from which he graduated in 1980.<ref name="taukappaepsilon">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Minutes&mdash;Second Quarterly Meeting | work = Tau Kappa Epsilon Alumni Association of West Chester University | publisher = | date = 2004-05-01 | url = http://www.tkema.com/minutes/Minutes-2004%20May%201.pdf#search=%22guckert%22 | format = .pdf | doi = | accessdate = 2006-09-28}}</ref>

==Media career==
===White House press credentials===
Gannon first attended a White House press conference on [[February 28]], [[2003]], and there asked a question of then White House Press Secretary [[Ari Fleischer]]. At this time Gannon had never had an article published, and was not associated with any kind of news organization (Talon News had not been created yet<ref name="washpost218"/>). However, Gannon states that he was editor of his high school student newspaper, as proof of having some journalistic experience. <ref name="qacafeatnathans">{{cite web

  | format =Flash
  | accessdate = 2007-05-08 }}</ref>

White House Press Secretary [[Scott McClellan]] later said that there was no breakdown in security and no one intervened on Guckert's behalf to ensure his access, despite the fact that Gannon had been able to get a press pass for the White House using an assumed name. Gannon's response was that the [[pseudonym|alias]] Jeff Gannon was a professional name used for convenience, saying that his "real last name is hard to spell and pronounce," and that the [[Secret Service]] was aware of his identity.<ref name="washpost218"/>

Journalists have said that it can take weeks to get the kind of clearance Gannon received. The ''Augusta Free Press'' reported that its acquisition of a single one-day pass was a two-week process.<ref name="augfpeditorial">{{cite web| title = Views on the News, Our View| work = Editorial| publisher = Augusta Free Press| date = 2005-02-11| url = http://www.augustafreepress.com/stories/storyReader$31588| accessdate = 2006-10-07 }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=June 2007}} Furthermore, it was said that, highly unusually, Gannon was issued one-day press passes for nearly two years, avoiding the extensive background checks required for permanent passes, and sidestepping Gannon's inability to gain the necessary Congressional press pass. Gannon applied for a Congressional press pass in April 2004 but was denied one by [[The Standing Committee of Correspondents]], a group of congressional reporters who oversee press credential distribution on Capitol Hill, on the grounds that Talon did not qualify as a legitimate and independent news service.<ref name="epsoftballthrower">{{cite news

===Talon News===
[[Talon News]] is a virtual organization (with no physical office or newsroom) owned by the Web site GOPUSA. "Talon News apparently consists of little more than (Robert) Eberle, (Jeff) Gannon, and a few volunteers, and is virtually indistinguishable from GOPUSA.com," says the [[Media Matters for America]] web site.<ref name="fosertalon">{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-05-12 }}</ref> Robert Eberle is the president and CEO of both GOPUSA and Talon News. This has led to unproven charges that Talon News was created specifically to give Gannon a news organization that he could ostensibly represent, to justify his continuing to work at the White House. By the middle of February 2005, the Talon News website had shut down for an indefinite amount of time, according to the message on that site; on [[September 1]] [[2006]], the site indicated the domain is for sale.

===Controversy===
The controversy over Gannon's background started after President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[January 26]], [[2005]] press conference, at which Gannon asked the president the following question:
{{wikiquote}}
:"Senate Democratic leaders have painted a very bleak picture of the U.S. economy. ([[Senate Minority Leader]]) [[Harry Reid]] was talking about soup lines. And ([[Senator]]) [[Hillary Clinton]] was talking about the economy being on the verge of collapse. Yet in the same breath they say that [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] is rock solid and there's no crisis there. How are you going to work &ndash; you've said you are going to reach out to these people &ndash; how are you going to work with people who seem to have divorced themselves from reality?"<ref name="globefriendly" />

Gannon's question was ridiculed on ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' (which dubbed him "Chip Rightwingenstein of the Bush Agenda Gazette") and by a number of liberal [[blog]]gers, who considered it an excessively deferential question for a reporter to ask at a presidential press conference.  Gannon's question also contained factually inaccurate assertions; the supposed comments about soup lines had not been made by Reid, but had been satirically attributed to him by conservative commentator [[Rush Limbaugh]].<ref name="globefriendly" />

After the [[January 26]], [[2005]] press conference, scrutiny into his personal and professional background by news organizations and blogs began. On [[February 8]], [[2005]], Gannon resigned from Talon News and temporarily shut down his website [http://www.jeffgannon.com www.jeffgannon.com]. According to the ''Washington Post'': 

Howard Kurtz of the ''Washington Post'' alleges that, "Jeff Gannon, ... whose naked pictures have appeared on a number of gay escort sites, says that he has 'regrets' about his past but that White House officials knew nothing about his salacious activities."<ref name="washpost218"/> Guckert said that he has been stalked<ref name="cnnblitzertranscript">{{cite news

Gannon is alleged to have registered several Internet [[domain name]]s, including Hotmilitarystud.com and Militaryescorts4m.com<ref name="Kurtz Feb 15" /> and posted naked pictures of himself. According to ''The Independent'':<blockquote>
"Bloggers revealed that Jeff Gannon... had previously worked as a $200-an-hour gay [[prostitute]] who advertised himself on a series of websites with names such as hotmilitary stud.com."<ref>{{cite news

</blockquote>When these ads became public, Gannon refused to specifically address them, but admitted that he had made mistakes in his past. <ref name="washpost218"/>

During the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], he wrote that [[John Kerry]] "might someday be known as 'the first gay president'" and that Kerry had supported "the [[gay agenda|pro-gay agenda]]".<ref name="washpost218" />

Cliff Kincaid, editor of the conservative Accuracy in Media report, wrote that "(t)he campaign against Gannon demonstrates the paranoid mentality and mean-spirited nature of the political left."<ref name="Kurtz Feb 15"/>

In April of 2006, Gannon appeared on the television program ''[[Lie Detector (TV series)]]'', produced by Mark Phillips Philms & Telephision for the [[I (TV network)|PAX Network]] (now i TV) submitting to and passed a [[polygraph]] to assert he was not a White House operative.

===Connection to Plame investigation===
Gannon has been questioned by the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] in relation to the department's criminal investigation into the [[Valerie Plame]] affair, in which Plame's identity as an employee of the [[CIA]] was leaked to a journalist by an administration official.<ref name="mistakenidentity">{{cite news

In the interview, Gannon asked Wilson about an "internal government memo prepared by U.S. intelligence personnel" that said Plame had suggested Wilson for the job. In a [[February 2005]] interview, Guckert told [[CNN]]'s [[Wolf Blitzer]] that the [[FBI]] had spoken to him in an effort to learn who had leaked the classified memo and to whom, but that he had not been asked to appear before the [[grand jury]] investigating the case.<ref name="cnnblitzertranscript"/>

Previously, Gannon had come under fire when he extensively covered the [[South Dakota]] Senate race between [[Tom Daschle]] and [[John Thune]]. Supporters of Daschle claimed he acted as a de facto member of the Thune campaign while ostensibly a journalist.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Conason |authorlink=Joe Conason |title=Gannon: The early years |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/opinion/conason/2005/02/18/gannon/index.html  |work=[[Salon.com|Salon]] |date=[[2005-02-18]] |accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref>

===''Washington Blade''===
In [[July 2005]], Gannon began writing for the DC-area gay publication ''[[Washington Blade]]''. His articles included criticism of gay blogger [[John Aravosis]], who had accused Gannon of having pornographic ads. ''Blade'' editor [[Chris Crain]] attracted his own criticism from many in the gay community for this decision, due to Gannon's past history of anti-gay reporting as well as Gannon's refusal to disclose his sexual orientation. He has said, "My personal life is a private matter, despite that fact that I have become a public person." Crain defended his decision in a September 2005 editorial<ref name="bladeeditorial">{{cite web| last = Crain| first = Chris| title = Gunning for Gannon is unhealthy sport | work = Editorial| publisher = Washington Blade| date = 2005-09-23| url = http://www.washblade.com/2005/9-23/view/editorial/| accessdate = 2006-10-07 }}</ref> and said that the "steady stream of feedback/vitriol" had declined "a little" with each new Gannon article.

==House Judiciary Committee==
The [[House Judiciary Committee]] voted against House resolution 136, on [[March 16]], [[2005]] that would have directed the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to transmit documents in the possession of officials to the House of Representatives. These documents related to the security investigations and background checks involved in granting access to the White House of James D. Guckert (also known as Jeff Gannon). The documents were to be transmitted no later than 14 days after the date of the adoption of the resolution.

During the Committee meeting Democratic Rep. [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] claimed that Gannon had engaged in "a penetration of the White House, maybe a security breach, and I do not believe it can be answered with self-investigation. <ref name=HORSI>House of Representatives security investigation"[http://www.congress.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&sid=cp1098Lb5A&refer=&r_n=hr030.109&db_id=109&item=&sel=TOC_30635&]</ref> <ref>Scott Shepard, "House rejects probe of reporter's access", ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', March 17, 2005.</ref>
  
Chairman [[Jim Sensenbrenner|Sensenbrenner]] pointed out that a letter dated [[March 7]], [[2005]], from the Secret Service stated, "Please be advised that our Office of Protective Operations has looked into this matter and has determined that there was no deviation from Secret Service standards and procedures as your letter suggests," <ref name=HORSI/> The letter did not detail what the standards were. 

Guckert, who wants to be addressed as Jeff Gannon, wrote in his blog, "I hope this vote will put these issues to rest and allow me to return to my work as a journalist." In his recently published book [http://www.thegreatmediawar.com/], Gannon refutes any suggestion of a role at the White House of anything other than an independent conservative journalist.

==White House records==

Democratic Representatives [[John Conyers]] of Michigan and [[Louise Slaughter]] of New York had submitted similar requests under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA), on [[February 15]], [[2005]]. 
The Louise Slaughter request was answered by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] with Secret Service records of Mr. Gannon's check in and out times at the White House.<ref name="rawrecords">{{cite web| title = Secret Service White House Access Records for James Guckert| publisher = RawStory|date=April 2005| url = http://rawstory.rawprint.com/0405/guckert_access_a1.php| accessdate = 2006-10-07 }}</ref> The Secret Service Records appear to show that Gannon checked in, but never checked out on many occasions, and visited the White House on several days during which no press conference or other press events were held.<ref name="counterpunchcomingsgoings">{{cite news
