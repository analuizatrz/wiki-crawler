According to the [[Parapsychological Association]], '''parapsychology''' is the scientific study of certain types of [[paranormal phenomena]], or of phenomena which appear to be paranormal.<ref>http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#p Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology, Retrieved February 10, 2007</ref>
The term is based on the Greek [[para]] (beside/beyond), [[psyche]] (soul/mind), and  [[logos]] (account/explanation) and was coined by psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] in or before 1889. Its first appearance was in an article by Dessoir in the June 1889 issue of the German publication ''Sphinx''.<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref> [[J. B.

Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref>  In contemporary research, the term 'parapsychology' refers to the study of [[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]], a general blanket term used by academic parapsychologists to denote anomalous processes or outcomes.<ref>http://www.medicalglossary.org/psychological_phenomena_and_processes_parapsychology_definitions.html Medical Glossary.org</ref><ref>http://www.mdani.demon.co.uk/para/paraglos.htm#P Psychic Science.com</ref><ref>http://www.parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#p The Parapsychological Association, Inc.

The scientific reality of parapsychological phenomena and the validity of scientific parapsychological research is a matter of frequent dispute and criticism. The field is regarded by some critics as a [[pseudoscience]]. Parapsychologist, in turn, say that parapsychological [[research]] is [[science|scientifically]] rigorous. Despite criticisms, a number of academic institutions now conduct research on the topic, employing laboratory methodologies and statistical techniques, such as [[meta-analysis]]. The [[Parapsychological Association]] is the leading association for parapsychologists and has been a member of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] since 1969.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse">''The Conscious Universe: The Scientific Truth of Psychic Phenomena'' by Dean I.

==Scope==

According to the [[Parapsychological Association]], parapsychology is limited in its scope to the study of three main classes of what they call [[paranormal phenomena]].<ref>Parapsychological Association. [http://parapsych.org/mission_statement.html "What is the PA? Mission Statement"]</ref> These classes include:

<div class="boilerplate metadata" id="attention" style="background-color: #FFFFFF; margin: 0 2.5%; padding: 0 10px; border: 1px solid #aaa;">
* '''Mental phenomena''': often described as [[extrasensory perception]], this class includes unusual mental states or abilities, such as [[telepathy]], [[clairvoyance]], [[precognition]], [[retrocognition]], [[remote viewing]], [[psychometry]], [[xenoglossy]], [[medium (spirituality)|mediumism]], [[channeling (mediumistic)|channeling]], [[clairaudience]], [[clairsentience]], and [[Spiritual possession|possession]]. This class involves some type of information transfer occurring outside the confines of one's [[five senses]].<ref>http://www.parapsych.org/faq_file1.html#6</ref><ref name=PA_GLOSSARY>http://www.parapsych.org/glossary_a_d.html</ref><ref>http://www.sheldrake.org/papers/Staring/JCSpaper1.pdf ''The Sense of Being Stared At And Other Unexplained Powers of the Human Mind'' ''Part 1: Is it Real or Illusory?''

* '''Physical phenomena''': this class includes unusual physical occurrences, such as [[psychokinesis]] (often referred to as telekinesis), [[poltergeist]]s, [[materialization (parapsychology)|materializations]], [[psychic healing]], [[faith healing]], [[morphic field]]s<ref>''The Presence of the Past'':
''Morphic Resonance & the Habits of Nature'' By Rupert Sheldrake</ref>, and [[synchronicity]]. These types of phenomena often involve the mind influencing its physical surroundings.<ref name=PA_GLOSSARY/><ref>http://www.parapsych.org/faq_file1.html#6</ref><ref>http://www.parapsych.org/faq_file1.html#10</ref>

* '''Survival phenomena''': this class deals with the survival of consciousness after physical death and includes [[ghost]]s, [[out-of-body experience]]s (OBEs) (also known as [[astral projection]]s), [[reincarnation]] and [[near-death experience]]s (NDEs).

Other reported phenomena which are sometimes labeled as paranormal, but which are outside these classifications, are considered outside the current scope of parapsychology by the association. Organizations outside the Parapsychology Association may have separate standards for determining the scope of parapsychology.

== History==
{{main|History of parapsychology}}

Parapsychology has a rich history dating back to at least the 1800s in both the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. The forms of parapsychology have changed over the years and continue to the present day.

===Early psychical research===

The rise of modern inquiry into reports of psychical phenomena coincided with the introduction of modern [[Spiritualism]] in 1848 and the movement's claims of [[paranormal]] abilities. Shortly thereafter, the [[Society for Psychical Research]] was founded in Britain (1882) and the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] was founded in the United States (1885). Spiritualism was so widespread and the reports of its effects so numerous and impressive that it was inevitable that scientists would be attracted to the alleged phenomena. Early psychical researchers concerned themselves with studying [[Mediumship|mediums]] and spiritualist claims. In the early 1900s, a dissatisfaction with the results of the research and political disagreements within psychic research organizations led to a new approach and a new term for the study of psychic phenomena: parapsychology.<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref>

===Introduction of parapsychology===

Although parapsychology has its roots in earlier research, it began using the experimental approach in the 1930s under the direction of [[J. B. Rhine]] (1895 – 1980).<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref> Rhine popularized the now famous methodology of using card-guessing and dice-rolling experiments in a laboratory in an attempt to find a statistical validation of [[extra-sensory perception]].<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref> The experimental approach has characterized much of contemporary parapsychology.

In 1957, the [[Parapsychological Association]] was formed as the preeminent society for [[parapsychologists]]. In 1969, they became affiliated with the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. That affiliation, along with a general openness to psychic and occult phenomena in the 1970s, led to a decade of increased parapsychological research.<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref> During this time, other notable organizations were also formed, including the Academy of Parapsychology and Medicine (1970), the Institute of Parascience (1971), the Academy of Religion and Psychical Research, the Institute for Noetic Sciences (1973), and the International Kirlian Research Association (1975). Each of these groups performed experiments on paranormal subjects to varying degrees. Parapsychological work was also conducted at the [[Stanford Research Institute]] during this time.<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref>

===The rise of organized skepticism ===

With the increase in parapsychological investigation, there came an increase in organized opposition to both the findings of parapsychologists and the granting of any formal recognition of the field. Criticisms of the field were focused in the founding of the [[CSICOP|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of  Claims of the Paranormal]] (1976), now called the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] ([[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSI]]), and its periodical, ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''.<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref> CSI continues to review parapsychological work and raise objections where they feel it is necessary.

==Status of the field==

Many professional scientists study parapsychology.<ref>http://parapsych.org/member_index.html Parapsychological Association Members Index, Retrieved February 25, 2007</ref>  It is an interdisciplinary field, attracting [[psychology|psychologists]], [[physics|physicists]], [[engineer]]s, and [[biology|biologists]], as well as those from other sciences.  One organization involved in the field, the [[Parapsychological Association]] is an affiliate of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS). <ref>http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/affiliates/#P</ref>. At present (2006) there are about two hundred and seventy five members in the Parapsychological Association.

It has sometimes been asserted that parapsychology is not a field of [[science]], or that it is a [[pseudoscience]]. Skeptical scholars such as [[Ray Hyman]] and James E. Alcock have said that parapsychology needs to do more theoretical work and produce results which are more easily replicable.<ref name="EntangledMinds"/><ref name="hymanevaluation">http://www.mceagle.com/remote-viewing/refs/science/air/hyman.html The Journal of Parapsychology, December, 1995, ''Evaluation of Program on Anomalous Mental Phenomena'' By Ray Hyman Retrieved January 5, 2007</ref>  They say that parapsychology lacks a cumulative database, and that its claims are based on the rejection of the null hypothesis (they do not detect [[Psi (parapsychology)| psi]] directly).<ref name="hymanevaluation"/><!--NEED AN ALCOCK REF HERE-->  Parapsychologists such as [[Jessica Utts]] and Dean Radin say that these objections do not consider that parapsychology has built on its previous experiments, and point to the [[ganzfeld experiment]] as one experiment which is replicable.  They say that other sciences such as physics also use indirect means of detecting the phenomena they study.<ref>''RESPONSE TO RAY HYMAN'S REPORT'' "Evaluation of Program on Anomalous Mental Phenomena" By Professor Jessica Utts Division of Statistics University of California, Davis, September 15, 1995</ref><ref name="EntangledMinds"/> However the [[ganzfeld experiment]] itself has been questioned as nothing more than an anomaly based on faulty methodology.{{POV-statement}}<ref>{{cite journal

Stanovich,

<blockquote>
If Stanovich is referring to parapsychology as a pseudoscience, I disagree. It has all the structure and appearance of any other science, and must be respected as such. The fact that differentiates it from other sciences is largely that it has no history of successful experiments upon which to base conclusions.<ref>http://www.randi.org/jr/071803.html, Website of the James Randi Educational Foundation, Retrieved February 19, 2005</ref>
</blockquote>

In 2003 Marie-Catherine Mousseau attempted to determine whether parapsychology is a science by comparing mainstream versus Parapsychological peer-reviewed journals.  Writing in the Journal of Scientific Exploration she said,

<blockquote>
Many efforts have been made to set up ‘‘necessary and sufficient’’ criteria for
science (Chalmers, 1999), but no consensus has been reached. Why not? One might argue there are no such things as ‘‘epistemological invariants’’ for science,
that each discipline (or even each lab) could have its own rules and methods (see
Zingrone, 2002). However, even if there is no clear criterion for science, there
must be a way to distinguish it from pseudo-science if the latter term is to have
any meaning.<ref name="Mousseau">http://www.scientificexploration.org/jse/articles/pdf/17.2_mousseau.pdf ''Parapsychology: Science or Pseudo-Science?'' By MARIE-CATHERINE MOUSSEAU
in the ''Journal of Scientific Exploration,'' Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 271-282, 2003, Retrieved February 19, 2005</ref>
</blockquote>

According to Mousseau, it is not possible to judge whether a field is actually a science based on an examination of its results.  This is because often research is done which follows the scientific method, even in the absence of sufficient evidence to form a theory. 
<blockquote>
Thus predictability and reproducibility usually bring results; results bring
consensus and acceptance by mainstream science. However, this process is the
final objective. A science in the making may not yet have gone through these
different stages. That does not mean that it will not, that it is not science. That is
why the criterion of assessing what is science by its results is not reliable.
</blockquote>

Mousseau said that the scientific quality of the discourse in parapsychological journals is higher than the average within science. Still, possibly because of the sparsity of parapsychological results in comparison with many other fields of science, and because of a lack of theoretical knowledge which would explain parapsychological results, parapsychology is in some ways less robust as a science than some other fields. For instance, Mousseau found that parapsychological journals had a smaller number of experimental reports relative to epistemological articles.  She speculated that this could be due to the difficulty of conducting parapsychological experiments.  Mousseau also found that parapsychology did not meet criteria for pseudoscience, such as suppressing unfavorable data, over-reliance on anecdotal evidence, or obliviousness to alternative theories, among others.<ref name="Mousseau"/> Mousseau concluded in part that
<blockquote>
Mainstream scientists could also learn from the generally extreme
rigor of their experimental approach which aims to address any kind of possible
criticisms and which is necessary to separate a very elusive phenomenon from
the background noise. They could learn from their concern to publish unsuccessful
experiments, whereas mainstream scientists often neglect to report
negative data although it can be very useful.<ref name="Mousseau"/>
</blockquote>

Parapsychology has made significant contributions to other fields, in such areas as the mind-body problem, the transformative effects of parapsychological experiences, and the psychology of [[OBE]]s.<ref>http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_2_67/ai_n6032971 Carlos S. Alvarado ''Reflections on being a parapsychologist'', Journal of Parapsychology, The. Fall 2003. 17 Feb. 2007.  Retrieved February 23, 2007</ref>  Parapsychological research has helped to combat superstition and to evaluate popular claims of the paranormal.  For instance, investigation of Silva Mind Control and Transcendental Meditation found no evidence to support their claims.  Parapsychological researchers have pioneered statistical techniques to study phenomena.  Ian Hacking argued that parapsychologists made early use of probability and randomization in their nineteenth-century studies of telepathy in the nineteenth-century.  Parapsychology has contributed to the study of fraud and self-deception, such as cases of fraudulent mediumism.<ref>http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_2_67/ai_n6032971 Carlos S.

For example, Cambridge physicist Brian Josephson who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1973 told [[The Observer]], "'Yes, I think telepathy exists,' [...] 'and I think quantum physics will help us understand its basic properties.' [...] 'I think journals like Nature and Science are censoring such research,' he said. 'There is a lot of evidence to support the existence of telepathy, for example, but papers on the subject are being rejected - quite unfairly.'"<ref>http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,560604,00.html ''Royal Mail's Nobel guru in telepathy row'' by Robin McKie, science editor of ''The Observer'' Sunday September 30, 2001, Retrieved December 17, 2006</ref>

As a general rule, while trained scientists may not be as likely to believe in parapsychological phenomena as the general public, they are far from monolithic in their disbelief.  Surveys of this group are rare, but in their 1994 paper in the Psychological Bulletin entitled [http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/psy1.html ''Does psi exist? Replicable evidence for an anomalous process of information transfer''] Daryl J. Bem and Charles Honorton quote a 1979 survey:

<blockquote>A survey of more than 1,100 college professors in the United States found that 55% of natural scientists, 66% of social scientists (excluding psychologists), and 77% of academics in the arts, humanities, and education believed that ESP is either an established fact or a likely possibility. The comparable figure for psychologists was only 34%. Moreover, an equal number of psychologists declared ESP to be an impossibility, a view expressed by only 2% of all other respondents (Wagner; Monnet, 1979).<ref>http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/psy1.html 1979 survey quoted in ''Does Psi Exist?

==Methodology==
Parapsychology employs a number of research methods in studying the possibility of psychical phenomena. Among these is the experimental approach.

===Experimental research===
{{main|Research results in parapsychology|Scientific investigation of telepathy|Ganzfeld experiment}}

A number of experiments have been conducted by parapsychologists since the 1930s, utilizing a wide range of methodologies that have changed over the years. As recently as 2006, computer scientists at the University of Manchester tested the possibility of [[telepathy]] by simulating a virtual computer world in the hopes that it would eliminate other forms of communication.<ref name="Virtual">http://news.com.com/2100-11395_3-6095966.html Virtual world tests telepathy,  CNET News.com, July 19, 2006</ref> This constant refinement of methodologies is in response to skeptical analysis of earlier experiments that call for a higher standard of practice in parapsychology because positive results challenge well-established scientific models of the universe.

A substantial portion of parapsychologists feel that over time they have gathered at least a small amount of data from properly controlled experiments, data that they feel can be trusted for a small number of psi phenomena.<ref name="Edinburgh">http://moebius.psy.ed.ac.uk/FAQ.php3#Nonsense ''It's All Nonsense, Isn't It?'' From the website of the Koestler Parapsychology Unit part of the Psychology Department (School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences) at the University of Edinburgh, Retrieved December 31, 2006</ref> A smaller group believes that a great deal of evidence has been collected, which, if it addressed more conventional phenomena, would be sufficient to provide proof. Not all parapsychologists agree, however. Some parapsychologists hold that this evidence is not definitive, but suggestive enough to warrant further research.<ref name="Edinburgh"/>

Contemporary parapsychology often looks at the statistical data of experiments for validation of psychic phenomena. Some experiments have tested the possibility of [[ESP]] by having subjects guess targets such as cards, pictures, or videos. There have also been many [[psychokinesis]] experiments testing the possibility that the mind can influence [[random number generator]]s. Other experiments, such as the [[ganzfeld]] procedure, test for the possibility of [[telepathy]]. In these experiments, a statistical deviation from chance is seen to be evidence of psi, which parapsychologist feel indicates psychic phenomena.

According to parapsychologists such as [[Dean Radin]], who was formerly President of the [[Parapsychological Association]]<ref>http://parapsych.org/history_of_pa_presidents.html History of the PA Presidency Retrieved January 5, 2007</ref>, many of these experiments have had positive results, with subjects scoring significantly above chance. He says that when analyzed using statistics, this significance has often been very high.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>(Radin 1997:84) The odds against chance of many of these statistical outcomes often range from one in thousands to one in trillions, which leads Radin and other parapsychologists to believe that these statistically significant results are in favor of the existence of psi, or some other unknown factor causing the deviation.

Not everyone agrees with this interpretation of parapsychological work. Although generally accepted within the parapsychology community, the statistical evidence for psychic phenomena has received strong opposition from outside sources, notably from the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] ([[CSI]]). Skeptical scholars such as [[Ray Hyman]], who was a founding member of [[CSI]], has said that parapsychology needs to do more theoretical work and produce results which are more easily replicable.<ref name="hymanevaluation">http://www.mceagle.com/remote-viewing/refs/science/air/hyman.html The Journal of Parapsychology, December, 1995, ''Evaluation of Program on Anomalous Mental Phenomena'' By Ray Hyman Retrieved January 5, 2007</ref>  He has also said that parapsychology lacks a cumulative database, and that its claims are based on the rejection of the null hypothesis. In other words, these experiments do not detect [[Psi (parapsychology)| psi]] directly.<ref name="hymanevaluation"/> Other scientists, such as noted skeptic James E. Alcock, have questioned the methodology of these experiments and said there is a logical fallacy in assuming that significant departures from the laws of chance are automatically evidence that something paranormal has occured.<ref name="psiassumption">http://skepdic.com/psiassumption.html The Skeptic's Dictionary, Psi Assumption, Robert Todd Carroll, Retrieved February 27, 2007</ref>

Despite controversy over parapsychological work, new experiments and a refinement of older methodologies continue in the field.
 
==Criticism==
{{main|Controversy in parapsychology}}

Skeptics of parapsychology often hold that the entire body of evidence to date is of poor quality and not properly controlled; in the views of many skeptics, the entire field of parapsychology has produced no conclusive results whatsoever. They often cite instances of fraud, flawed or potentially flawed studies, a [[Magical thinking|psychological need for mysticism]], or [[cognitive bias]] as ways to explain parapsychological results.

Proponents of parapsychology in turn argue that those who hold these views have not had sufficient contact with the published literature of the field such as that which can be found in the [[Journal of Parapsychology]], the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research, the [[Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research]], or in the proceedings of the annual convention of the [[Parapsychological Association]].

===Skeptical view===
{{main|The skeptical view of parapsychology}}

Some critics say that the positive results of [[parapsychological]] experiments are probably due to errors such as design flaws, experimenter effects, and sometimes fraud, etc{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. This is partly because error is a simpler explanation of the phenomena of [[psi]] than the hypothesis that psi is real{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Critics also say that a review of the history of parapsychology reveals that parapsychologists prefer to remain popular rather than reveal malfeasance within their field{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

It is generally believed that in social psychology people try to maintain their social standing.<ref>''Betrayers of the Truth'' by William J. Broad, Oxford University Press, 1985 </ref> <ref> ''The Psychology of Conviction: A Study of Beliefs and Attitudes'' by [[Joseph Jastrow]], Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918 </ref> <ref> ''Social Psychology'' by Elliot Aaronson, Timothy D.

===Fraud in parapsychology=== 	 
{{main|Fraud in parapsychology}}

Some critics say that the positive results of [[parapsychological]] experiments are probably due to fraud, though they may sometimes be due to design flaws. This is partly because fraud is a simpler explanation of the phenomena of [[psi]] than the hypothesis that psi is real.

=== State of the controversies ===
Proponents of parapsychology claim that their subject is not controversial because it lacks valid scientific results, but rather because parapsychology touches on areas of profound human ignorance such as in [[physics]] and in the nature of [[consciousness]], and also areas of deep meaning such as [[religion]], [[superstition]], and [[tradition|traditional beliefs]].<ref>http://www.parapsych.org/faq_file3.html FAQ of the 
Parapsychological Association, Why is parapsychology so controversial?</ref>

Skeptics and parapsychologists have both noted that parapsychology could be a [[protoscience]], one ahead of its time. However, science historian [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] has stated that scientific revolution resulting in a '[[paradigm]] shift' in our knowledge occurs usually when pressure comes from within orthodox science itself because acknowledged anomalies generate pressure for their reduction or removal<ref>T.S. Kuhn, The structure of scientific revolutions, University of Chicago Press, 1962</ref>. About this, physicist M. A. Rothman has written:

{{quotation|"The major difficulty with the notion that parapsychology is going to produce a paradigm revolution in physics is the fact that most physicists are ''not'' unhappy with basic laws." <ref>M. A. Rothman, The new perpetual motion, ''The Humanist'', XXXVIII(4), p.42-45</ref>}}
 
Parapsychologists claim that their findings to date are significant and are generating pressure for change, but they argue that the real importance of this pressure is not being acknowledged within mainstream science because of scientific dogmatism.

Some skeptics have accused scientists involved in parapsychology of being [[fraud]]s and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientists]] who [[bias]] their results to fulfill their emotional needs.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>

{{quotation|There are at least half a dozen peer-reviewed journals of parapsychology. However, research in this area has been characterized by deception, fraud, and incompetence in setting up properly controlled experiments and evaluating statistical data (Alcock 1990; Gardner 1981; Gordon 1987; Hansel 1989; Hines 1990; Hyman 1989; Park 2000; Randi 1982)."<ref>http://skepdic.com/parapsy.html Skeptics Dictionary on Parapsychology</ref>}}

Proponents of parapsychology have responded that the skeptics are promoting "[[scientism]]"<ref>http://www.enlightenment.com/media/interviews/tartall/tart.html#Anchorpsi An Enlightenment Interview with Professor Charles T. Tart</ref> rather than real science by acting as if results which contradict established knowledge cannot be real.  Even [[Marcello Truzzi]], a founder of the Society for Scientific Exploration,<ref>http://www.scientificexploration.org/founding-members.html</ref> director for the Center for Scientific Anomalies Research and founding co-chairman of the skeptical organization [[Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] (now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry<ref>http://www.csicop.org/about/csi.html</ref>), said that

{{quotation|A characteristic of many scoffers is their pejorative characterization of proponents as "promoters" and sometimes even the most protoscientific anomaly claimants are labelled as "pseudoscientists" or practitioners of "pathological science." In their most extreme form., scoffers represent a form of quasi-religious Scientism that treats minority or deviant viewpoints in science as heresies ([[Marcello Truzzi|Truzzi]], 1996).<ref>http://skepticalinvestigations.org/anomalistics/perspective.htm Anomalistics ''The Perspective of Anomalistics''  By [[Marcello Truzzi]]</ref>}}

Truzzi also stated that

{{quotation|Over the years, I have decried the misuse of the term "skeptic" when used to refer to all critics of anomaly claims.[...]Since "skepticism" properly refers to doubt rather than denial--nonbelief rather than [dis]belief--critics who take the negative rather than an agnostic position but still call themselves "skeptics" are actually pseudo-skeptics and have, I believed, gained a false advantage by usurping that label.  In science, the burden of proof falls upon the claimant; and the more extraordinary a claim, the heavier is the burden of proof demanded. The true skeptic takes an agnostic position, one that says the claim is not proved rather than disproved.[...]Critics who assert negative claims, but who mistakenly call themselves "skeptics," often act as though they have no burden of proof placed on them at all, though such a stance would be appropriate only for the agnostic or true skeptic.[...]Thus, if a subject in a psi experiment can be shown to have had an opportunity to cheat, many critics seem to assume not merely that he probably did cheat, but that he must have, regardless of what may be the complete absence of evidence that he did so cheat and sometimes even ignoring evidence of the subject's past reputation for honesty. Similarly, improper randomization procedures are sometimes assumed to be the cause of a subject's high psi scores even though all that has been established is the possibility of such an artifact having been the real cause.[...]Evidence in science is always a matter of degree and is seldom if ever absolutely conclusive.<ref>''On Pseudo-Skepticism A Commentary by Marcello Truzzi'' by Marcello Truzzi in the ''Zetetic Scholar'', #12-13, 1987</ref><ref>http://www.anomalist.com/commentaries/pseudo.html ''On Pseudo-Skepticism A Commentary by Marcello Truzzi'' Read the article here</ref>(''On Pseudo-Skepticism'' by Marcello Truzzi)}}

Skeptics have responded to criticism by saying, in the words of [[Carl Sagan]], that "…extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence".<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/ok/TheDeepSkies/SaganQuotes.html Carl Sagan Quotes</ref> Parapsychologists riposte that they have attained levels of proof which are more than sufficient to prove their results in any other field of science.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>

Another factor which makes parapsychology highly controversial is that there is no theory which can account for parapsychological results.<ref>http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/1996/subtle.html  ''Subtle Connections: Psi, Grof, Jung, and the Quantum Vacuum''   By [[Ervin Laszlo]]</ref><ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>  [[Psi (parapsychology)|Psi]] seems to be able to establish informational links both to the past and the future.  Its effects do not seem to drop off according to the [[inverse square law]], as with other physical forces.  And information gathered using psi does not seem to require [[energy]] to facilitate its transfer.  Also, there may not be any limit on the complexity of information gained by psi.<ref>http://jeksite.org/psi/jp01.pdf J. E. Kennedy in ''The Journal of Parapsychology'', Vol. 65, September 2001 (pp. 219-246)</ref>

Parapsychology is also disturbing to those who believe that to admit that psi exists would encourage religion, [[superstition]], and psychic frauds, as all these are based either on manifestations of psi, or on reports which are hard to distinguish from it.  Skeptics wonder if this would undermine the foundations of science and reason.<ref name="para3"/>

There have been a huge number of parapsychological experiments performed under controlled laboratory conditions. According to [[Dean Radin]] Ph.D, Senior Scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences,<ref>http://www.noetic.org/research/faculty.cfm The institute's research and education faculty, Retrieved January 5, 2007</ref> in Petaluma, California, and former President of the [[Parapsychological Association]]<ref>http://parapsych.org/history_of_pa_presidents.html History of the PA Presidency Retrieved January 5, 2007</ref>,

{{quotation|In 1993, the parapsychologist Charles Honorton, from the University of Edinburgh, considered what skeptics of psi experiments used to claim, and what they no longer claimed. He demonstrated that virtually all the skeptical arguments used to explain away psi over the years had been resolved through new experimental designs. This does not mean the experiments conducted today are “perfect,” because there is nothing perfect in the empirical sciences. But it does mean that the methods available today satisfy the most rigorous skeptical requirements for providing “exceptional evidence.” As we’ve seen, such experiments have been conducted, with successful results.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>(Radin 1997:208-209)}}

Many of these experiments have been done with the aid of skeptics of parapsychology, and also with the aid of professional [[Magic|conjurors]], in order to eliminate as much as possible all controversies concerning the [[Scientific method|analysis]] of the data gathered, and to prevent fraud on the part of the subjects. Dean Radin quotes parapsychologist George Hansen as saying that 	 

{{quotation|Although the public tends to view magicians as debunkers, the opposite is more the case. Birdsell (1989) polled a group of magicians and found that 82 percent gave a positive response to a question of belief in ESP. Truzzi (1983) noted a poll of German magicians that found that 72.3 percent thought psi was probably real. Many prominent magicians have expressed a belief in psychic phenomena. …. It is simply a myth that magicians have been predominantly skeptical about the existence of psi.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>(Radin 1997:207)}}

Concerning a series of computer-controlled [[ganzfeld]] experiments done by the parapsychologist Charles Honorton in the 1980s, magician Ford Kross, an officer of the Psychic Entertainers Association wrote that

{{quotation|In my professional capicity as a mentalist, I have reviewed Psychophysical Research Laboratories' automated ganzfeld system and found it to provide excellent security against deception by subjects.<ref>http://www.metapsychique.org/Does-Psi-Exist-Replicable-Evidence.html Bem, D.J., and C. Honorton. 1994.  ''Does psi exist?  Replicable evidence for an anomalous process of information transfer.'' Psychological Bulletin 115:4-18</ref><ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>(Radin 1997:86)}}

Another major reason that psi has remained controversial is that parapsychologists have sometimes been fooled by hoaxes. Some parapsychological studies have been badly designed, in such a way as to permit fraud.  In the case of [[Project Alpha]], magician James Randi planted magicians as subjects of a parapsychological experiment, and they were able to fool the researchers over a prolonged period. Such methodological failures have been cited by skeptics as evidence of the probability that most if not all parapsychological results derive from error or fraud.<ref>http://www.banachek.org/nonflash/project_alpha.htm Project Alpha, The Skeptical Inquirer Summer 1983 ''The Project Alpha Experiment: Part one. The First Two Years'' by James Randi</ref>

Andrew Greeley, a Catholic priest and a sociologist from the [[University of Arizona]], studied surveys on belief in ESP from 1978 through 1987, and he also studied the mental health of believers in ESP.  The surveys he studied showed that from 1978 through 1987, the number of American adults who reported psychic experiences rose from 58% to 67% (clairvoyance and contacts with the dead were reported by 25% of his respondents).  According to Greeley, the elderly, women, widows and widowers, and the conventionally religious report a higher incidence of such experiences. He also tested the psychological well-being of people reporting mystical experiences with the "Affect Balance Scale" and found that people reporting mystical experiences received top scores.  Greeley summarized his findings by writing:

{{quotation|People who've tasted the paranormal, whether they accept it intellectually or not, are anything but religious nuts or psychiatric cases. They are, for the most part, ordinary Americans, somewhat above the norm in education and intelligence and somewhat less than average in religious involvement.<ref>http://www.skepticalinvestigations.org/guide/field_guide.htm</ref>}}

A few parapsychologists are [[scientific skepticism|skeptics]], for example [[Chris French]] and his colleagues at the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at [[Goldsmiths College|Goldsmiths College in London]], and [[Richard Wiseman]] and his colleagues at the Perrott-Warrick Research Unit in the [[Psychology]] Department of the [[University of Hertfordshire]], both of which units include individuals who are members of the Parapsychological Association. These researchers do not approach the field with a belief in the paranormal, but are rather interested in the purely psychological aspects of those who report paranormal experiences, along with the study of the psychology of deception, hallucination, etc. These researchers also have provided their own guidelines and input to other parapsychologists for the design of experiments and how to properly test those who claim psychic abilities. While some of these guidelines have been useful, many have suffered from a naive understanding of scientific practice in general and in parapsychology in particular, from a distorted view of the methodology actually in use in the field, and the unfortunate habit of some skeptics of making sweeping statements about the applicability of counter-hypotheses to lines of research without actually investigating the appropriateness of those counter-hypotheses to the details at hand. (See, for example a mostly-positive review of one of these guidelines written by skeptics[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_3_63/ai_60054226].)
