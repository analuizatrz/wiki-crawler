'''Iron(III) chloride''', [[generically]] called '''ferric chloride''', is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula FeCl<sub>3</sub>.  The crystals appear a dark green colour by reflected light, but by transmitted light they appear purple-red as its colour depends upon the viewing angle.  It is [[deliquescent]], fuming in moist air due to the evolution of HCl, which hydrates, giving a mist.  When dissolved in water, FeCl<sub>3</sub> undergoes [[hydrolysis]] and gives off a heat as it is an [[exothermic]] reaction.  The resulting brown, acidic solution, which is corrosive, is used as a [[coagulant]] in treating sewage and drinking water and as an etchant for copper-based metals (such as those found in [[printed circuit boards]]) and [[stainless steel]]. 

Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is a fairly strong [[Lewis acid]], and it is used as a catalyst in [[organic synthesis]]. The brownish-yellow [[Water of crystallization|hexahydrate]] is a common commercial form of ferric chloride, a yellowish species described by the formula [FeCl<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>]Cl.2H<sub>2</sub>O (compare [[chromium(III) chloride]]).

==Structure==
FeCl<sub>3</sub> adopts the BI<sub>3</sub> structure, which features octahedral Fe(III) centres interconnected by two-coordinate chloride ligands.  FeCl<sub>3</sub> has a relatively low melting point and boils at around 315 °C.  The vapour consists of the dimer Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> (compare [[aluminium chloride]]) that is increasingly dissociated into the monomeric FeCl<sub>3</sub> (D<sub>3h</sub> [[symmetry group|point group symmetry]]) at higher temperature, in competition with its reversible decomposition to give [[Iron(II) chloride|FeCl<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Chlorine|Cl<sub>2</sub>]].<ref>Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. ISBN 0-12-352651-5.</ref>

== Chemical properties ==
'''Iron(III) chloride''' is a moderately strong [[Lewis acid]] that forms adducts with [[Lewis base]]s such as [[triphenylphosphine oxide]], e.g. FeCl<sub>3</sub>(OPPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> where Ph = [[phenyl]].  FeCl<sub>3</sub> reacts with [[chloride]] salts to give the yellow [[tetrahedral]] FeCl<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> ion.  Solutions of FeCl<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> in [[hydrochloric acid]] may be extracted into [[diethyl ether]].  

When heated with [[iron(III) oxide]] at 350 °C, FeCl<sub>3</sub> gives the oxychloride FeOCl.  In the presence of base, alkoxides react to give the corresponding complexes:
:FeCl<sub>3</sub>  +  3 [[Ethanol|C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH]]  +  3 [[Ammonia|NH<sub>3</sub>]]  →  Fe(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>  +  3 [[Ammonium chloride|NH<sub>4</sub>Cl]]

[[Oxalic acid|oxalate]] reacts rapidly with aqueous ferric chloride to give [Fe(C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>3−</sup>.  Other [[Carboxylate]] salts also form complexes, e.g. [[Citric acid|citrate]] and [[tartaric acid|tartrate]].

Iron(III) chloride is also a mild [[Redox|oxidising agent]], capable (for example) of oxidising [[copper(I) chloride]] to [[copper(II) chloride]].  Reducing agents such as [[hydrazine]] convert FeCl<sub>3</sub> to complexes of iron(II).

== Preparation and production ==
Anhydrous iron(III) chloride may be prepared by union of the elements:<ref>B. R. Tarr, "Anhydrous Iron(III) Chloride" in Inorganic Syntheses, volume III, pp 191–194 (1950).</ref>
:2[[Iron|Fe]]([[solid|s]])  +  3[[Chlorine|Cl<sub>2</sub>]]([[Gas|g]])  →  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>([[Solid|s]])

Solutions of iron(III) chloride are produced industrially both from iron and from ore, in a closed-loop processes.

*Dissolving pure [[iron]] in a solution of iron(III) chloride:
::Fe(s) + 2FeCl<sub>3</sub>(aq) → 3FeCl<sub>2</sub>(aq)

*Dissolving [[iron ore]] in [[hydrochloric acid]]:
::Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(s) + 8HCl(aq) → FeCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 2FeCl<sub>3</sub>(aq) + 4H<sub>2</sub>O

*"Upgrading" the [[iron(II) chloride]] with [[chlorine]]:
::FeCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) → FeCl<sub>3</sub>(aq)

Alternatively, ferrous chloride can be oxidized with [[sulfur dioxide]]:
::32FeCl<sub>2</sub> + 8SO<sub>2</sub>  +  32HCl → 32 FeCl<sub>3</sub>  +   S<sub>8</sub>  +  16H<sub>2</sub>O

Hydrated FeCl<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub> can be converted to the anhydrous salt by heating with [[thionyl chloride]].  The hydrate ''cannot'' be converted to FeCl<sub>3</sub> by heat, instead HCl is evolved and FeOCl forms

== Uses ==
'''Iron(III) chloride''' is probably most widely used for etching copper in the production of printed circuit boards.<sup>[1]</sup>  This occurs by the [[redox]] reaction 
::FeCl<sub>3</sub> + [[Copper|Cu]]  →  [[Iron(II) chloride|FeCl<sub>2</sub>]]  + [[Copper(I) chloride|CuCl]] followed by FeCl<sub>3</sub>  +  [[Copper(I) chloride|CuCl]]  →  [[Iron(II) chloride|FeCl<sub>2</sub>]]  +  [[Copper(II) chloride|CuCl<sub>2</sub>]]

Iron(III) chloride is also used as a catalyst for the reaction of [[ethylene]] with [[chlorine]], forming ethylene dichloride ([[1,2-Dichloroethane]]), an important commodity chemical, which is mainly used for the industrial production of [[vinyl chloride]], the [[monomer]] for making [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].

In another industrial application, ferric chloride is an alternative to [[iron(III) sulfate]] in water treatment, where FeCl<sub>3</sub> is treated with [[hydroxide]] ion to form a [[Flocculation|floc]] of "iron(III) hydroxide" (more correctly formulated as FeO(OH)) that can remove suspended materials.

In the laboratory iron(III) chloride is commonly employed as a [[Lewis acid]] for [[catalyst|catalysing]] reactions such as [[chlorination]] of [[aromatic compound]]s and [[Friedel-Crafts reaction]] of aromatics.  It is less powerful than [[aluminium chloride]], but in some cases this mildness leads to higher yields, for example in the alkylation of benzene:

[[Image:FeCl3_Friedel-Crafts.gif|400px]]  

The "ferric chloride test" is a traditional colorimetric test for [[phenols]]<sup>[7]</sup> which uses a 1% iron(III) chloride solution that has been neutralised with [[sodium hydroxide]] until a slight precipitate of FeO(OH) is formed.  The mixture is filtered before use.  The organic substance is dissolved in water, [[methanol]] or [[ethanol]], then the neutralised FeCl<sub>3</sub> solution is added—a transient or permanent coloration (usually purple, green or blue) indicates the presence of a phenol or enol. 

FeCl<sub>3</sub> is sometimes used by American coin collectors to identify the dates of [[Buffalo nickel]]s that are so badly worn that the date is no longer visible.

FeCl<sub>3</sub> is also commonly used by knife craftsmen and swordsmiths to stain blades, as to give a contrasting effect to the metal, and also to view metal layering or imperfections.

FeCl<sub>3</sub> is also necessary for the etching of [[photogravure]] plates for printing photographic and fine art images in [[intaglio]] and for etching [[rotogravure]] cylinders used in the printing industry.

== Precautions ==
Iron(III) chloride is toxic, highly corrosive and acidic.  The anhydrous material is a powerful dehydrating agent.
