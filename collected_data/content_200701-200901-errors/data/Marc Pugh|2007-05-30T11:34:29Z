'''Marc Pugh''' (born [[Bacup]], [[England]] on [[April 2]], [[1987]])<ref name="Bury F.C.co.uk">{{cite web | title=bury f.c.co.uk | work=Bury F.C's official website | url=http://www.buryfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Squad/ProfilesDetail/0,,10422~29899,00.html}}</ref> is a professional [[English people|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]]er currently playing for [[Shrewsbury Town|Shrewsbury Town F. C]] in the English [[Football League 2]]. He plays mainly as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] but can play as a [[striker]] and on the [[Midfielder#winger|wing]]<ref name="shrewsburytown f.c.co.uk">{{cite web | title=shrewsburytown f.c.co.uk | work=Shrewsbury Town F.C's official website | url=http://www.shrewsburytown.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10443~1030687,00.html}}</ref>. He has represented England in the North-West of England team and attended the All Saints High School in [[Rossendale]].

==Playing Career==
===Youth===
His footballing career began at the [[Football League Championship]] side [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley F.C]] where at a young age, he started as a Centre of Excellence player, and gradually worked his way up through the ranks to become a footballing apprentice.<ref name="Sportnetwork.net">{{cite web | title=sportnetwork.net | work=Article about loan spell and bench appearance| url=http://http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s37/st85191.htm?fromrss=1}}</ref> He began as a first year apprentice which involved both playing for the youth and reserve teams and taking a 'Modern Apprenticeship In Sporting Excellence' at college. This was spread out over three years and by the second year the club would either take them on as 3rd year apprentices or release them.<ref name="Burnley F.C.co.uk">{{cite web | title=burnley f.c.co.uk | work=Burnley F.C's official website, youth team development information | url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Squad/Under19s/0,,10413,00.html}}</ref> Due to Marc's great goalscoring record (which led him to be named on the first team bench<ref name="Sportnetwork.net">{{cite web | title=sportnetwork.net | work=Article about loan spell and bench appearance| url=http://http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s37/st85191.htm?fromrss=1}}</ref>) they decided to keep him on for a third year.[[Image:Marcpugh.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Marc playing on loan for Kidderminster Harriers]] As a 3rd year apprentice he scored 15 goals<ref name="Clarets-mad.co.uk">{{cite web | title=clarets-mad.co.uk | work=Burnley F.C fansite, part of the Footymad network, article Pugh gets deal | url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/news/loadnews.asp?cid=TMNW&id=282980}}</ref> for the club's reserve and youth team. This led to him to be sent out on loan to [[Kidderminster Harriers]], a [[Nationwide Conference]] team, for real footballing experience. Whilst at the Harriers, he scored one goal and made 10 appearances. Also, during a match he did a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents head with his heel, then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score. The move was featured on [[Soccer AM]]'s showboating section as showboat of the week. Also, during a reserve match, Marc had to play in [[Goalkeeper (football)|goal]] after reserve keeper Mark Crossley was sent off.<ref name="Clarets-mad.co.uk">{{cite web | title=clarets-mad.co.uk | work=Burnley F.C fansite, part of the Footymad network, article Pugh gets deal | url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/news/loadnews.asp?cid=TMNW&id=282980}}</ref> The Harriers eventually went on to lose the game 7-1.

During the course of the season, Marc learned that he would not get a professional contract at Burnley, and would be released at the end of the season. This was partly due to the fact that both [[Chris McCann]] and [[Kyle Lafferty]] had both already received first team contracts and they were only 2nd year apprentices.

===Professional Career===
====Bury====
Having just been released from Burnley, Marc started looking for a new club, and was eventually offered a place at [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Bury F.C.|Bury FC]]. At the time of Marc's arrival at Bury, the threat of relegation loomed over the club. On top of this, the club had lost several good players to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston]] (including David Nugent and Simon Whaley). As a result, Bury's season had slumped and they were entangled in a relegation battle. Pugh ended up playing six games in the 05/06 season for the club (including 3 as a sub) and scored his first goal in the 1-1 draw against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]].<ref name="manchestereveningnews.co.uk">{{cite web | title=manchestereveningnews.co.uk | work=Manchester Evening News official website, sports news | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/bury/s/210/210848_casper_pays_tribute_to_pugh.html}}</ref> As a result of his good performances (and helped by the fact that Bury had survived relegation), Bury manager [[Chris Casper]] offered him a one year deal at [[Gigg Lane]]; his first professional contract. Pugh was very much a first team player in the 2006/07 season, playing particularly well in the first half of the season and was offered an extended contract by Chris Casper<ref name="clarets-mad.co.uk">{{cite web | title=clarets-mad.co.uk | work=Burnley F.C fansite, part of the Footymad network, Pugh signs for Shrews | url=http://www.claretsmad.co.uk/news/loadnews.asp?cid=TMNW&id=339771}}</ref> incidently this extension was turned down by Marc as he "wanted to keep his options open"<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite web | title=http://news.bbc.co.uk | work=BBC article, Pugh rejects new Bury contract | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bury/6362161.stm}}</ref>.
