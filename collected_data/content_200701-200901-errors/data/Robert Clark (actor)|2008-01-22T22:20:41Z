'''Robert Clark''' (born [[August 20]], [[1986]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[actor]]. After building up years of experience in singing, [[theatre|stage]] and limited television work in the 1990s, he has gone on to receive critical and public recognition for his roles in various small screen productions, most notably ''[[The Zack Files]]'' and ''[[Strange Days at Blake Holsey High]]''.

==Life and career==
Clark was born the second child of Suzanne Brown in [[Oakville, Ontario]], and in 1988 Suzanne relocated her and her two sons to [[Boca Raton, Florida]]. When she re-married in 1991, the entire family moved near [[Toronto, Canada]].<ref>[http://www.lassiterentertainment.com/daniel/bio.htm "Daniel Clark Bio"]. ''Lassiter Entertainment''. Retrieved [[August 5]] [[2005]].</ref> Clark joined the Belfountain Singers (based in [[Caledon, Ontario]]), and performed at various live concerts, both with the group and solo. The Singers performed at the [[1997 Winter Special Olympics]], and they also sang on the national talk show ''[[Open Mike with Mike Bullard]]''. Clark (with his brother, [[Daniel Clark (actor)|Daniel]]) attended the [[Randolph School for the Performing Arts]], and successfully completed the school's Kids Triple-Threat Musical Theatre Program.

Clark's very first professional acting role was opposite hockey player [[Wayne Gretzky]] in a television commercial for [[Honeycomb (cereal)|Honeycomb Cereal]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rollercoaster/zackfiles/characters/zack_personal.htm "The Zack Files: Characters &mdash; Zack"]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC.net]]. Retrieved [[August 3]] [[2005]].</ref> Under his mother's guidance, he used his previous singing experience in auditions for stage productions such as ''[[Ragtime (musical)|Ragtime]]'' (1998) and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (theatrical production)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', though he lost the role in the latter to his brother.<ref name="TorontoStar">Bawden, Jim. [http://news.degrassi.ca/article.php?a_id=179 "Acting's not child's play: School may be out, but for pint-sized actors, summer's no time to slack off"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]''. [[July 8]] [[2000]]. Retrieved [[August 5]] [[2005]].</ref> He subsequently managed to clinch a recurring role in the television show ''[[I Was a Sixth Grade Alien]]'' (starring his brother), and made several guest appearances in programs such as ''[[Eerie Indiana: The Other Dimension]]'' (also starring his brother), ''[[Real Kids, Real Adventures]]'', and ''[[Twice in a Lifetime (TV series)|Twice in a Lifetime]]''.

Clark's acting career was not limited to the small screen, however; in ''[[Superstar (film)|Superstar]]'' (1999), Clark was Eric Slater ([[Harland Williams]]) as a child. He later won small parts in a few [[television movie]]s: ''[[Switching Goals]]'' (1999) with [[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen]], as a Goth in ''[[The Ride (TV film)|The Ride]]'' (2000), and in ''[[All-American Girl: The Mary Kay Letourneau Story]]'' (2000), as the son of real-life convicted child rapist [[Mary Kay Letourneau]].

In ''[[Rated X (film)|Rated X]]'' (2000), a fact-based film directed by and starring [[Emilio Estevez]], Clark played the younger version of [[Charlie Sheen]]'s character; a boy physically abused by his father who would grow up to become an adult film director. Following this, Clark had a more prominent role as a street windscreen wiper who donates his life savings of $4.30 to a murder investigation in the A&E Network's original film ''[[The Golden Spiders]]: A Nero Wolfe Mystery'', the pilot for the A&E series ''[[A Nero Wolfe Mystery]]''. [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]'s Steve Oxman spoke highly of the production, calling the cast "a stellar ensemble" and noting that "the performances are more than the sum of their parts".<ref>Oxman, Steve. [http://print.google.com/print/doc?articleid=EWaGXIsPxgI "The Golden Spiders: A Nero Wolfe Mystery"]. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. [[March 1]] [[2000]]. Retrieved [[August 5]] [[2005]].</ref>

His first lead role came in the [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show ''[[The Zack Files]]'' (2000), which its creators described as "an ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' for kids". The show lasted just two seasons, but for his efforts Clark won a [[Young Artist Award]] for Leading Young Actor in a Drama Series, and producer John Delmage said that Clark and his co-stars were chosen for their acting ability and had the potential to maintain careers in the profession as adults.<ref name="TorontoStar"/>

The filming schedule for ''The Zack Files'' was tight, but Clark found time to participate in other projects. He played the son of a sex addict ([[Harry Hamlin]]) in ''[[Sex, Lies & Obsession]]'' (2001), and also acted opposite [[John Corbett]] in the Christmas film ''[[Prancer Returns]]'' (2001), which went [[direct-to-video]] but was praised by critic Scott Weinberg,<ref>Weinberg, Scott. [http://www.apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=3689&Specific=4404 "Prancer Returns"]. ''Apollo Movie Guide''. Retrieved [[August 5]] [[2005]].</ref> and earned Clark another Young Artist Award.

Shortly after the cancellation of ''The Zack Files'', Clark was cast in a similar television series, ''[[Strange Days at Blake Holsey High]]'', which was first broadcast in the autumn of 2002. Clark's acting performance was well-received; in addition to another Young Artist nomination, Family Screen Scene called the show as a whole "well written and acted. The looks and mannerisms of the teens fit their characters, adding realism to their roles".<ref>[http://www.allinfoaboutfamilyscreenscene.com/Strange_Days.html "Discovery Kids On NBC and Discovery Kids Channel"]. ''Family Screen Scene''. Retrieved [[August 4]] [[2005]].</ref> While ''Strange Days'' was on the air, Clark could be seen in the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]]'s ''[[Deathlands: Homeward Bound|Deathlands]]'' (2003), as the young son of a deceased future king who narrowly escapes death at the hands of his power-hungry brother.

In an April 2005 episode of ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', Clark played an openly [[gay]] teenager recruited by the title character ([[Kristen Bell]]) to publicly humiliate the prejudiced ex-boyfriend ([[Jeff D'Agostino]]) of one of her friends ([[Natalia Baron]]). Reviewing the episode, John Ramos of the website ''[[Television Without Pity]]'' commented positively on Clark's appearance, making an earnest request to "give the gay kid more screen time".<ref>Ramos, John.

Retrieved [[August 4]] [[2005]].</ref> Clark also had a supporting role as one of the ten children of a 1950s housewife ([[Julianne Moore]]) in the film drama ''[[The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio]]'', released to theatres in late 2005.
