'''''Eggheads''''' is a [[BBC Two]] [[quiz]] [[game show]] presented by [[Dermot Murnaghan]]. The Eggheads are a team, made up of five British quiz champions who compete against a new panel of challengers each episode. 

==Quiz champions==
The quiz champions who compete on the show are:
*[[Kevin Ashman]]: winner of ''[[British Quiz Championship]]'', ''European Quiz Championship'', ''[[World Quizzing Championships]]'', ''[[Fifteen to One]]'', ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'', ''[[Brain of Britain]]'' and ''[[Mind Sports Olympiad]]''. 
*[[CJ De Mooi]]: winner of ''[[BrainTeaser]]'', ''[[100% (game show)|100%]]'' and ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' as well as having been [[Mensa International|Mensa]] chess champion.
*[[Daphne Fowler]]: winner of ''[[Fifteen to One]]'', ''[[Brain of Britain]]'' and ''[[Going for Gold]]''.
*[[Christopher Hughes]]: winner of ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'', ''[[International Mastermind]]'' and ''[[Brain of Britain]]''.
*[[Judith Keppel]]: first British winner of one million pounds on ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK)#Million pound winners|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''

==Title sequence==
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by host Dermot Murnaghan, stating 'These five people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is: can they be beaten?' The five Eggheads are displayed in revolving egg-shaped frames, with a blue background.

==Format==
There are four main rounds, in which the challengers are given a category, and choose one of their players to play against an Egghead of their choice, and they choose whether or not to go first — all aspects designed to give the challengers an advantage. They are asked three [[multiple choice]] questions each; if these result in a tie, non-multiple choice questions are asked in pairs, in a [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] fashion. Possible categories for these rounds include Arts and Books, Entertainment, Food and Drink, History, Geography, Politics, Science and Sport. The contestants do not know the categories or their order in advance, but are guaranteed that at least one of Entertainment or Sport will come up.

After the main rounds the final takes place, in which the losing players from the main round are not allowed to compete and a dominant team could thus have a 5–1 advantage. All remaining players are allowed to confer and the category is always General Knowledge.

Should the challengers win, they receive £1,000 plus a further £1,000 for each day the Eggheads had previously gone undefeated. Defeat usually leads Murnaghan to ask "Congratulations Eggheads, can anyone beat you?" The Eggheads have a tendency to show off somewhat, often giving extra information or using obscure cross-references to some to their answers.

==History==
The show has been running for six series, represented by the same five Eggheads. The first team to defeat the Eggheads were the ''Unicorn Inn'' from [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]], who won the thirteenth edition on 26 November 2003 in a sudden death tie break. The next winners were ''Spaghetti'', a group of [[Mensa International |mensans]] from the [[West Midlands]], who won £19,000. On the 27 September 2006, ''Second Class'', a group of postmen won £37,000, which remained the highest win ever for just over a year.

On the [[28 September]], [[2007]] broadcast, the Eggheads lost after a 74 game winning streak, and the challenging team (''Beer Today, Gone Tomorrow'', a group of young students from [[Oxford Brookes University]]) won £75,000 &mdash; the highest prize won on the show so far <ref> http://www.brookes.ac.uk/about/news/latest/eggheads </ref>. Despite only two of them being in the final round versus four Eggheads (minus Chris), they won 3-1 by correctly answering this question "Which [[European Union|EU]] capital city is farthest south - [[Lisbon]], [[Valletta]] or [[Nicosia]]?" the answer being Nicosia in [[Cyprus]]. The Eggheads answered one question incorrectly in the final round, believing that eight states in the [[United States]] officially sanction the [[death penalty]] (the correct answer being 38). At the end of the programme, the winners stated that they plan to treat themselves by travelling to Nicosia.

On [[3 October]], [[2007]], just three shows after the last win, the ''Preston Quizmasters'' beat the Eggheads taking home just £3,000.

On a show broadcast on [[20 November]], [[2007]] a team of staff from the [[Museum of London]] and its offshoot museum, the [[Museum in Docklands]] won £33,000. The challengers had just two members in the final round versus four Eggheads (minus Judith), but managed to win 3-1 by correctly answering the question "In which country was [[Harry Houdini]] born? - [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]] or [[Hungary]]?" the answer being [[Hungary]]. The Eggheads answered one question incorrectly in the final round, answering that actor [[Jeff Goldblum]] had appeared drunk on US chat show [[The View]] in November 2006 when in fact it was [[Danny DeVito]].

The show, which is made by [[12 Yard|12 Yard Productions]], is often repeated in an early-evening slot on [[BBC Two]]. Other repeats of the series can be seen on digital channel [[Challenge]].

Occasionally, the show has had some well-known people on the challengers' team. Multi-World Darts Champion [[Phil Taylor]] has appeared, as well as the England Women's Cricket Team and [[reality TV]] celebrities [[Jade Goody]] and [[Eugene Sully]].
