'''Adam Kubert''' (born [[October 6]], [[1959]] in [[Boonton, New Jersey]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[comic book]] [[artist]] whose work has been published by [[Marvel Comics]], [[Dark Horse Comics]] and [[DC Comics]], among others. He is the son of [[Joe Kubert]] and brother of [[Andy Kubert]], both comic book artists as well.

==Biography==
Adam Kubert graduated from the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] with a degree in [[medical illustration]]. He also attended the [[Joe Kubert School|Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art]] in [[Dover, New Jersey]]. He has since established himself as one of the leading artists in comics and ''Wizard'' magazine recently rated him as one of the "Hot 10 Writers and Artists" in the industry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/021208hot10artists.html |title=Hot 10 Writers & Artists – Comics |accessdate=2008-04-03 |format= |work=WizardUniverse.com }}</ref>

==Influences==
Adam Kubert has publicly expressed admiration for the works of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], [[Will Eisner]], [[Jim Steranko]], [[Alex Toth]] and his father [[Joe Kubert]]. Much of the inspiration for Kubert's 'painted' work, as seen on the covers of his Action Comics run, are drawn from the works of Will Eisner as can be seen by the brown almost 'sepia' like finishes with the white highlights. The definitive [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] battle (Wolverine, Vol. 1, Issue 90) featured multiple gatefold interior pages, a throwback to Steranko's work on the 'Nick Fury: Agent of Shield' comic.

==Marvel Comics==

He is probably best-known for his work at Marvel Comics, in particular for a sporadic run on the solo ''[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'' title with writer [[Larry Hama]], a short run with writer [[Peter David]] on the ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' and numerous stints on various ''[[X-Men]]'' titles.

Adam Kubert is noted for his raw, dynamic art style, combined with fluid storytelling and noteworthy pacing. He's also known for his experimentation in art style and storytelling, being one of the first mainstream (i.e. Marvel or DC employed) comic book artist to experiment with the pencils-straight-to-colour approach with Steve Bucellato on ''The Incredible Hulk''.

On his X-Men run, Kubert was teamed up with European colorist [[Richard Isanove]], who subsequently followed Adam to the ''Ultimate X-Men'' project, perfecting the pencils-to-color approach seen on most of ''Ultimate X-Men'' covers. Kubert has been criticized not meeting monthly deadlines on certain issues, which often required hiring fill-in artists, a penchant that Kubert himself has admitted to having.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} In a 1998 ''Wizard'' interview with Jim McClaughlin, Kubert apologized to fans for the slow output, explaining that readers and fans now expect more of illustrators, and that the onus rests on the artist to spend time creating more detailed and well-drafted illustrations.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Although Kubert remains an talented penciller, the choice of inker for his work greatly influences the quality of the final printed page. It has been argued by fans and critics alike through various mediums such as the internet and comic publications, that some of Kubert's finest work has been embellished by the British inker Mark Farmer, especially his runs on Wolverine and The Incredible Hulk for Marvel Comics.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} While talented inkers, notably Danny Miki and John Dell, lent their talents to Kubert's pencils during his runs on Ultimate X-Men and Ultimate Fantastic Four respectively, reaction to the final artwork was mixed due to the stylistic nature of the inkers which did not lend itself well to Kubert's normally lush drawings, leading to increasing calls that Adam Kubert should once again be paired up with Mark Farmer, even more so now that Kubert has moved to DC Comics as of 2006.  

When Marvel Comics launched the industry-changing ''Ultimate Universe'' series in 2001, Kubert was chosen as the penciller for the second launch book ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]''. His storytelling and distinct style coupled with writer [[Mark Millar]]'s well crafted tales, made the book an instant success. Kubert was also chosen as the penciller to launch the ultimate universe version of Marvel's first family, the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]], once again with writers Mark Millar and [[Brian Michael Bendis]]. Both series launched to commercial and critical acclaim, firmly establishing Kubert as an industry heavyweight and one of Marvel's "go-to guys" for their major projects. 

An accomplished inker, he received an [[Eisner Award]] for his inking duties on the [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]]-[[DC Comics]] ''[[Batman vs. Predator]]'' crossover in the early 1990s. In addition to this, Kubert is well renowned for his lettering ability, being the youngest professional comic book letterer at the age of only 11 years old. His very own handwriting was used as the template for the font used in the Ultimate X-men comics, additionally Kubert's early lettering work on the now defunct Heavy Metal magazine was used by DC comics as the basis for most of the fonts used in their comics and magazines.

Both Adam and his brother Andy signed exclusive contracts to work for DC Comics in 2005. (At the same time, their father wrote a [[Sgt. Rock]] mini-series for the company.) This came as somewhat of a shock to the industry as both the Kuberts (along with [[John Romita, Jr.]]) were known as Marvel's stalwarts, and they were well known for their company loyalty. When [[Valiant Comics]] tried to lure the brothers over from Marvel in 1994 for exorbitant sums of money, they both blindly refused opting to keep their home at Marvel Comics. In an interview for the magazine ''Wizard'', the brothers made clear that they held no animosity for Marvel, but instead were excited for the chance to work on DC titles for a change. The brothers also work as teachers at the [[Joe Kubert School]], founded by their father (who also teaches there). Adam teaches first year classes, Andy second, and Joe third.

==DC Comics==
Kubert is currently illustrating a Superman story entitled "Last Son", co-written by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Richard Donner]] (director of the 1978 film ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'') – his first project for DC Comics. He was to begin contributing to the story arc with ''Action Comics'' #841 (July 2006). However, he was not involved until issue #844, published in October 2006.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Issue #845 was released on December 3, 2006 to similar acclaim and again DC had to go back to press for a second printing on the February 23, 2007. Issue #846, part 3 of the "Last Son" storyline, was originally scheduled to be released December 30, 2006 was released on February 28, 2007.  The next part of the story was scheduled to be a 3D issue released in April 2007. Further delay forced DC Comics to bring in substitute creative teams and delay the fourth part of the "Last Son" storyline and 3D issue to #851, which was released in early July 2007.

According to a April 2007 post on the Internet forum Newsarama, Johns stated that the delay was made to accommodate Kubert's schedule and that the final part of the "Last Son" storyline would be in ''Action Comics Annual'' #11.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=108943 |title=More Action Comics Scheduling Woes |date= Newsarama |accessdate=2008-04-03 |format= |work=Newsarama |quote= A note to let everyone know that our "Last Son" finale has been moved to ACTION COMICS ANNUAL #11 to accommodate Adam [Kubert]'s schedule and allow us to continue on with our Action Comics run.}}</ref> The annual went on sale on May 7, 2008.
