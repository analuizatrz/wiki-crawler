'''Michael Shawn Hickenbottom''' (born [[July 22]], [[1965]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known by the [[ring name]] '''Shawn Michaels'''. He is currently performing on the [[WWE Raw|''RAW'']] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) where he is one-half of [[D-Generation X]], along with his real life friend [[Triple H]].

Michaels is one of the longest tenured performers in World Wrestling Entertainment; having worked in various positions for the company since 1987.

==Career==
===Early career===
Born to a military family on an air base in [[Chandler, Arizona]], Michaels spent a brief part of his early years in [[Reading, Berkshire]], [[England]], but mainly grew up in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. In San Antonio, he attended [[Randolph High School]] on [[Randolph Air Force Base]]. 

Trained by [[Mexico|Mexican]] professional wrestler [[Jose Lothario]], Michaels debuted in [[1984]], working with Mid-South Wrestling and later Texas All-Star Wrestling [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]], where he and [[Tom Boric|Paul Diamond]] were awarded the TAW Tag Team Championship by [[Chavo Guerrero|Chavo Guerrero, Sr.]].

Michaels also wrestled for Central States Championship Wrestling. There, he and tag team partner [[Marty Jannetty]] defeated [[The Batten Twins]] for the Central States Tag Team Championship, later losing it back to the Battens. Michaels also made several appearances in the [[Dallas, Texas]]-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] throughout 1985.

===American Wrestling Association===
Michaels made his national-level debut in 1986 in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), once again teaming with Jannetty. The pair were billed as "[[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]]" and won the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] twice. They also appeared in the Mid-South on loan at this point. In a raid of AWA talent in 1987, The Rockers were signed by a competing promotion: the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]]. However, they were fired two weeks later for "partying too hard" (a misunderstanding, according to Michaels' autobiography). They returned to the AWA, but were re-signed by the WWF a year later.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment===
They redebuted on the [[June 18]], [[1988]] episode of ''Superstars''. Because of WWF chairman [[Vince McMahon]]'s desire to have his performers carry WWF-exclusive monikers, they were repackaged as just "The Rockers".

The energetic team proved popular with both children and women, as well as 'smart' fans who appreciated technical wrestling. The team were mid-card stalwarts of TV and pay-per-view shows for the next two years, but never seemed to get a fair chance at the WWF's Tag Team Championships.

Their chance belatedly came in October 1990: The Rockers were scheduled to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Hart Foundation]]. Jim Neidhart, half of the championship team, was in the process of negotiating his release from the company.

The match was taped with The Rockers fairly winning the belts, but soon after, Neidhart came to a stopgap agreement with management and was rehired. The belts were returned to the Harts, while the change was never broadcast or even acknowledged on TV. When news spread, WWF explained that the original result was void due to a collapsed turnbuckle in the ring during the bout. A buckle had indeed broken, but not to a noticeable or dangerous extent during the match.

====1992-1993====
The duo plodded along, eventually splitting on [[December 2]], [[1991]] during an incident on [[Edward Leslie|Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake]]'s televised "Barber Shop" talk show segment. Michaels superkicked Jannetty and [[Defenestration|threw him]] through a [[Sugar glass|glass]] window on the "shop" set. Jannetty vanished from the WWF and Michaels turned heel as "The Boy Toy". His nickname was later changed to "The Heartbreak Kid", at [[Curt Hennig]]'s suggestion.

In his new [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] as a vain, cocky heel named '''The Heartbreak Kid''', he was put together with mirror-carrying [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Sherri Martel|"Sensational" Sherri]], who, according to the storyline, had become infatuated with him. Sherri even sang the first version of his new [[theme music]] "Sexy Boy." During that period, Michaels normally wrestled during the first half of house shows, and had his departure announced with the words "Shawn Michaels has left the building" (alluding to the phrase "[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] has left the building").

Michaels failed to win the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] from Bret Hart in July 1992, even losing the WWF's first ever [[Ladder match]] against him at a [[House Show]]. Still, Michaels was beginning to get over as a heel. He won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] from [[Davey Boy Smith|"The British Bulldog" Davey Boy Smith]] during ''Saturday Night's Main Event'' on [[October 27]], [[1992]]. Shortly thereafter, he was a PPV main event for the first time, facing — and losing to — future nemesis [[Bret Hart]], for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at the [[Survivor Series (1992)|1992 Survivor Series]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/survivorseries92.html Survivor Series 1992 Results]</ref>. They were moved to the main event after [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]] left WWF suddenly, leaving his tag-team match with [[Randy Savage]] against [[Ric Flair]] and [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] hanging.  The "Champion vs. Champion" match stole the show. 

Michaels and Sherri split at this point, and Jannetty quickly reappeared, leading to several memorable matches. After sneaking past [[Chris Chavis|Tatanka]] in early 1993, Michaels lost his Intercontinental Championship to Jannetty on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night RAW]]'' on [[May 17]], [[1993]].<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/1993.html RAW 1993 Results]</ref>. He then regained it on [[June 6]], [[1993]] with the help of his debuting "[[bodyguard]]" (and off-air friend) [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]].<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/1993.html RAW 1993 Results]</ref>.

After a much-hyped but ultimately disappointing feud with [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]], Michaels quit the WWF in [[September 1993]]. It was announced that Michaels had failed to defend his belt enough times during a set period; in reality, he had been suspended for testing positive for [[steroids]] — a charge that Michaels denies to this day. After turning down [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]'s advances, Michaels returned to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] and made several appearances in the [[United States Wrestling Association]] during a WWF/USWA cross-promotion. He returned to WWF television for November's [[Survivor Series (1993)|1993 Survivor Series]], substituting for the arrested [[Jerry Lawler]] in a match pitting himself and three of Lawler's "Knights" against Bret, [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce]], [[Keith Hart|Keith]], and [[Owen Hart]].<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/survivorseries93.html Survivor Series 1993 Results]</ref>.

====1994-1995====
He soon entered a hot feud with Razor Ramon, who had won the vacated Intercontinental Title during Michaels' absence. Since Michaels had never been defeated in the ring for the title, he claimed to be the rightful champion and even carried around his old title belt. This feud culminated in a [[ladder match]] between the two at [[WrestleMania X]]. Michaels lost the match, which featured both his and Ramon's belts suspended above a ladder in the ring<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania10.html WrestleMania X Results]</ref>. This match won "Match of the Year" awards from ''Pro Wrestling Illustrated'' and the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]''. It also earned Michaels a reputation of being the "Innovator of the Ladder Match", when in reality it was [[Bret Hart]] who brought in the idea two years previously from the Stampede Wrestling promotion.

Michaels battled various injuries over the next few months, and soon launched the "Heartbreak Hotel" TV talk show segment, mainly shown on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]''.

On [[August 28]], [[1994]], Michaels and his ever more popular sidekick, Diesel, captured the WWF World Tag Team Championship from [[The Headshrinkers]]. During their brief time as a tag team, they used a variation of the Headshrinkers' finishing move, where Michaels would finish off their opponent by climbing on Diesel's shoulders and [[professional wrestling aerial techniques#splash|splashing]] on their opponents. The next day, at [[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam 1994]], Diesel lost the Intercontinental Title to Ramon when Michaels accidentally [[Superkick]]ed his bodyguard<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/summerslam94.html SummerSlam 1994 Results]</ref>.  This triggered a Michaels-Diesel split, drawn out until the [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series 1994]] that November due to Michaels' hand injury at the time<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/survivorseries94.html Survivor Series 1994 Results]</ref>. Michaels went on to win the [[Royal Rumble (1995)|1995 Royal Rumble]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble95.html Royal Rumble 1995 Results]</ref>, setting up a championship/grudge match at [[WrestleMania XI]] against Diesel. Michaels recruited [[Sid Eudy|Sid]] as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania11.html WrestleMania XI Results]</ref>, and then was turned on by Sid the following night.

As Sid challenged Diesel for the gold, Michaels took time off. He returned to the ring, as a 'babyface', in [[June]] [[1995]], and toppled [[Jeff Jarrett]] in [[July]] [[1995]] for his third Intercontinental Title. This would lead to a title defense against Razor Ramon at [[SummerSlam (1995)|SummerSlam 1995]], in a Ladder Match, which Michaels won<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/summerslam95.html SummerSlam 1995 Results]</ref>. Around this time, Michaels became the alleged leader of a backstage group known as [[Clique (professional wrestling)|The Clique/Kliq]], which others perceived had sufficient clout with WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]], to become the dominant wrestling figures in the promotion for several years in the mid-[[1990s]]. Michaels disputes the perception, saying that McMahon pushed only deserving wrestlers. Shawn's fanbase was later nicknamed "The Kliq" as an inside reference to the real "Clique." 

In October 1995, he was attacked by several men outside a [[Syracuse, New York]], bar. Shortly afterwards, at the [[In Your House#In Your House 4: Great White North|In Your House: Great White North]] PPV Michaels forfeited the Intercontinental Title to rival [[Shane Douglas|Dean Douglas]] as he was, according to the WWF, unable to compete. However, Douglas lost the title immediately to Clique member Razor Ramon<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse4.html In Your House 4 Results]</ref>. Douglas maintained that Michaels could have wrestled that night and simply didn't want to put him [[over (professional wrestling)|over]].

The next month, during a match with Owen Hart on ''Monday Night RAW'', Owen nailed Michaels with an [[Professional wrestling attacks#Enzuigiri|Enzuigiri]] kick to the back of Michaels' head. They continued to wrestle, but Michaels then collapsed in the ring, supposedly because he had suffered a concussion in the Syracuse incident<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/1995.html RAW 1995 Results]</ref>. The concussion was a [[Work (professional wrestling)|work]], skillfully kept from most fans at the time.

====1996-1997====
After teasing a retirement, Michaels announced that he would be returning to the WWF at the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|1996 Royal Rumble]] match, which he won for the second year in a row<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble96.html Royal Rumble 1996 Results]</ref>. Around this time, [[Jose Lothario]], Michaels' original trainer, became his on-screen manager.

Michaels won his first WWF Championship at [[WrestleMania XII]] in March 1996, pinning Bret Hart in the 'sudden death' overtime of their a sixty minute [[Iron Man match]], which had ended in a 0-0 tie<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania12.html WrestleMania XII Results]</ref>. As WCW gained momentum due to the signings of Michaels' friends [[Scott Hall]] and [[Kevin Nash]], Michaels soldiered on as champion for most of the year, notably overcoming [[Mick Foley|Mankind]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse10.html In Your House 10 Results]</ref>, [[Leon White|Vader]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/summerslam96.html SummerSlam 1996 Results]</ref> and [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/kingofthering96.html King of the Ring 1996 Results]</ref> in pay-per-view battles. 

At [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam 1996]] in his main event WWF championship match with [[Leon White|Vader]], Shawn notoriously became agitated during the match when Vader misheard Shawn and didn't move out of the way on his subsequent elbow drop. Shawn changed direction in mid air upon realising Vader wasn't going to move and then shouts loudly "move!" whilst stamping legitimately on Vader's head. Shawn admitted in a later recorded shoot interview that [[Mick Foley|Mankind]], suggested that during their match at In Your House: Mind Games, Shawn should re-enact his genuine heat with Vader during match against Mankind and perform the same stamp sequence seen at SummerSlam a month earlier.

Michaels' title reign colorfully ended at the [[Survivor Series (1996)|1996 Survivor Series]] in November, where he lost to Sycho Sid, his former bodyguard, at [[Madison Square Garden]] in a face vs. face match. This match was notable for the [[New York City|New York]] fans cheering for Sid when he hit both Michaels and Jose Lothario with a television camera and cheering again when he won the match and championship<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/survivorseries96.html Survivor Series 1996 Results]</ref>. A flu-ridden Michaels recaptured the belt from Sid in January at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 Royal Rumble]] in front of his hometown fans in San Antonio<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble97.html Royal Rumble 1997 Results]</ref>. 

Michaels was supposed to defend his title at a [[WrestleMania 13]] rematch with [[Bret Hart]] but he gave up the title on a special episode of ''RAW'' dubbed ''Thursday RAW Thursday'',<ref>http://www.forever-shawn.net/info/archives/trt.html</ref> broadcast live on the [[USA Network]] on [[February 13]], 1997. This speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at WrestleMania. Michaels had been told by doctors that a knee injury was bad enough to have to retire, and knowing that Michaels' knee was bad, Bret Hart mapped out a novel ending for their planned WrestleMania match: Hart would catch Michaels' right leg as he attempted to execute his superkick finisher and twist it. Michaels' leg would thus 'break', complete with planted 'snapping' sounds coming from under the ring. The ending would allow Michaels to 'lose' the title without quitting or being pinned, and also would allow understandable time out.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In the speech, Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he "had to find his smile again", which he had "lost" somewhere down the line. In the end, Bret Hart resumed his feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] for [[WrestleMania 13]], and Michaels did color commentary at the event<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania13.html WrestleMania XIII Results]</ref>. 

After knee surgery by Dr. James Andrews, he miraculously returned a few months later, briefly teaming with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] to win the WWF Tag Team title. However, after a real life backstage fight with Bret Hart, Michaels quit the WWF, until Vince McMahon convinced Michaels otherwise, and gave him the role of a heel.

At [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam 1997]], Michaels officiated the WWF title match between WWF Champion [[The Undertaker]] and Bret Hart. The match ended in controversial fashion, with Michaels nailing Undertaker with a chair (unintentionally, as he was aiming for Hart after Bret spat in his face). Michaels was then forced to award the title to his nemesis, Hart, setting the stage for their match at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/summerslam97.html SummerSlam 1997 Results]</ref>. Michaels' striking of the Undertaker with a chair began a feud between the two men. In October, at [[Bad Blood#1997|In Your House: Badd Blood]], Michaels and Undertaker participated in the very first [[Hell in a Cell]] match, which saw Michaels falling off the side of the 15-foot high structure through a table. Michaels won the match with the help of the debut of the Undertaker's brother [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse18.html In Your House 18 Results]</ref>.

In the summer, Michaels joined forces with real-life friend, [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] and Hunter's then-girlfriend, [[Joanie Laurer|Chyna]] to form [[D-Generation X]]. The group would engage in rebellious behavior, such as pointing to their penis' and telling fans to "Suck It". Moving away from the family-oriented product, this marked the beginning of the WWF Attitude Era. Michaels also began re-feuding with Bret Hart's reformed [[The Hart Foundation]], which was now a pro-[[Canada]] [[stable (professional wrestling)|stable]]. Michaels would taunt The Hart Foundation and Canada by engaging in acts, such as blowing his nose with and humping the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian Flag]]. In his book, ''Heartbreak & Triumph'', Michaels claims the flag desecration was Bret Hart's idea.

Michaels' feud with the Hart Foundation culminated in a title shot at the [[Survivor Series (1997)|1997 Survivor Series]] against Bret Hart in  what is thought to be the most controversial match in wrestling history. Michaels came out of this match, known "affectionately" by fans as the [[Montreal Screwjob]], as the WWF World Champion<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/survivorseries97.html Survivor Series 1997 Results]</ref>.

Michaels thus became the only wrestler to hold both the World Championship and the European Championship at the same time. However, he would have himself pinned by Triple H in December in a [[farce|farcical]] match, making Hunter the European Champion<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/1997.html RAW 1997 Results]</ref>.

====1998-Injury====
In [[1998]], a back injury that Michaels received in the [[Casket match]] against the Undertaker at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 Royal Rumble]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble98.html Royal Rumble 1998 Results]</ref> (where Michaels took a back body drop to the outside, smashing his lower back on the casket causing him to herniate two discs and crushing one completely) forced Michaels into retirement after losing the WWF Championship to [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] at [[WrestleMania XIV]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania14.html WrestleMania XIV Results]</ref>. Prior to losing the belt, Michaels would, along with DX allies, make regular appearances much like Steve Austin did the previous year after injuring his neck at SummerSlam. Wrestlers such as [[Bret Hart|Bret Hart]], as Michaels reveals in his autobiography, would be doing interviews on live television claiming that Michaels was faking his whole injury. Bret later apologized for these events.

Michaels would return to the WWF on [[November 23]], [[1998]], but not as a wrestler; instead, he replaced [[Sgt. Slaughter]] as the [[List of authority figures in professional wrestling|WWF Commissioner]], joining Vince McMahon's [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]] [[stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] as a heel<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/1998.html RAW 1998 Results]</ref>. Throughout late 1998 and early [[1999]], Michaels would make regular TV appearances, booking matches, stamping down his authority and sometimes deciding the outcome of matches. In early 1999, Michaels turned face and re-joined D-Generation X, but disappeared from WWF television for a few months, and by the time he had returned DX had broken up.

Michaels would make occasional appearances on WWF television as commissioner as a face during the spring and summer of 1999. He was supposed to turned heel once again during the premiere episode of [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|''SmackDown!'']] on [[August 26]], [[1999]] when, while serving as a special guest referee, he superkicked [[The Rock (entertainer)|The Rock]], allowing Triple H to retain the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/smackdown/1999.html SmackDown 1999 Results]</ref>. However, Michaels would not appear on WWF television until [[May 21]], [[2000]], as a face, to officiate the [[Iron Man match]] between the Rock and [[Triple H]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/judgmentday00.html Judgment Day 2000 Results]</ref>. He would make one last appearance a month later, when he would hand over the role of commissioner to [[Mick Foley]], becoming the official spokesperson for the WWF. Michaels then disappeared from WWF television for nearly a year.

Michaels' prolonged absences were the result of his opening of the [[Texas Wrestling Academy|Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy]] in early 1999. In February 2001, Michaels signed a multi year contract extension with the WWF.

====2002-Return to ''RAW''====
In [[2002]], Michaels returned to wrestling, brought in by [[Kevin Nash]] as a new member of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/020603.html RAW - 3rd June 2002 Results]</ref>. After the nWo was disbanded, Triple H apparently wanted to mend ties with Michaels. This was solidified when Michaels beseeched Triple H to return to ''RAW''. Later on, they came down to the ring with their [[D-Generation X]] music and attire. When they were about to do their trademark "Suck It" taunt, Triple H nailed Michaels with the [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/020722.html RAW - 22nd July 2002 Results]</ref>. A week later, Triple H attacked Michaels from behind in a parking lot and put his head through a car window<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/020729.html RAW - 29th July 2002 Results]</ref>. Michaels surprised everyone by challenging Triple H to "a fight" (a non-sanctioned match) at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam 2002]], which Triple H accepted. 

Michaels returned to the ring to wrestle a match against Triple H at SummerSlam 2002, laying the foundation for a feud that would last for years. This match was noted for Michaels' emotional in-ring return after more than four years on the shelf. Michaels won the SummerSlam match but was attacked with a sledgehammer by Triple H after the match<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/summerslam02.html SummerSlam 2002 Results]</ref>.

At [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series 2002]], Michaels won the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] from Triple H in the first-ever [[Elimination Chamber]] match, which also featured [[Rob Van Dam]], [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]], [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]]. Michaels eliminated both Jericho and Triple H to win the match<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/survivorseries02.html Survivor Series 2002 Results]</ref>. A month later, Michaels lost the World Championship to Triple H in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Two out of three falls|Three Stages Of Hell match]] at [[WWE Armageddon#2002|Armageddon 2002]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/armageddon02.html Armageddon 2002 Results]</ref>.

====2003-2004====  	 
Michaels then proceeded to feud with [[Chris Jericho]]. On [[January 13]], [[2003]], Jericho won an over-the-top-rope challenge to select his entry number for the Royal Rumble, choosing number two in order to start the match with Michaels<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/030113.html RAW - 13th January 2002 Results]</ref>, who had already been named number one. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho, with the help of [[Jason Reso|Christian]], eliminated Michaels<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble03.html Royal Rumble 2003 Results]</ref>. Michaels defeated Jericho at [[WrestleMania XIX]]. After the match, HBK offered his hand to Chris Jericho who, instead of shaking it, hugged Michaels. At first it seemed like good sportsmanship by Chris Jericho but he quickly kicked Michaels in the groin<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania19.html WrestleMania XIX Results]</ref>. 	 
			
Michaels then formed a tag team with the returning Kevin Nash and feuded with Triple H's [[Evolution (professional wrestling)|Evolution]] stable. At [[SummerSlam (2003)|SummerSlam 2003]] he competed in the second-ever Elimination Chamber Match, which also featured [[Randy Orton]], Kevin Nash, Chris Jericho, [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]], and eventual winner, World Heavyweight Champion, Triple H. During the match, he helped Chris Jericho eliminate Kevin Nash, which prompted Nash to attack both men before exiting the chamber. Later in the match, Michaels was eliminated by Goldberg<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/summerslam03.html SummerSlam 2003 Results]</ref>. He then went on to feud with Evolution member Randy Orton, who would defeat him at [[WWE Unforgiven#2003|Unforgiven 2003]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/unforgiven03.html Unforgiven 2003 Results]</ref>. Michaels then had short feuds with [[Mark Henry]] and the new World Heavyweight Champion Goldberg before joining Steve Austin's Survivor Series Team. At [[Survivor Series (2003)|Survivor Series 2003]], Team Austin (Shawn Michaels, Rob Van Dam, Booker T and [[Dudley Boyz|The Dudley Boyz]]) faced Team Bischoff ([[Scott Steiner]], Mark Henry, Chris Jericho, Christian and Randy Orton). During the match, Evolution member [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] interfered and gave Michaels the Batista Bomb, costing him the match<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/survivorseries03.html Survivor Series 2003 Results]</ref>. Michaels would go on to defeat Batista at [[WWE Armageddon#2003|Armageddon]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/armageddon03.html Armageddon 2003 Results]</ref>.
			
Michaels went on to be in the main event of ''[[WrestleMania XX]]'' as part of an ongoing feud with Triple H, where he came up short in a match against Triple H and [[Chris Benoit]] for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania20.html WrestleMania XX Results]</ref>. At [[WWE Bad Blood#2004|Bad Blood]] in June, Michaels  lost to Triple H in a [[Hell in a Cell]] match<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/badblood04.html Bad Blood 2004 Results]</ref>. On the Raw after Bad Blood, [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]] attacked Michaels with a steel chair, injuring him ([[kayfabe]]) in the process<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/040614.html RAW - 14th June 2004 Results]</ref>. Michaels made his return at [[WWE Unforgiven#2004|Unforgiven]] and defeated Kane in a No Disqualification Match<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/unforgiven04.html Unforgiven 2004 Results]</ref>. Two months later, he lost a World Heavyweight Championship match against Triple H (after Edge interfered) at [[WWE Cyber Sunday#2004|Taboo Tuesday 2004]] when the fans voted for him ahead of [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] and Chris Benoit to face Triple H one more time<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/tabootuesday04.html Taboo Tuesday 2004  Results]</ref>. Following this, Michaels was out of action for a few months with a [[legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] torn [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]].

====2005-2006====
Michaels returned in [[January 2005]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/041227.html RAW - 27th December 2004 Results]</ref>., and was special guest referee in the [[Elimination Chamber]] Match (which featured Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Edge, Randy Orton, Batista, and eventual winner Triple H) at [[WWE New Year's Revolution#2005|New Year's Revolution 2005]]. During the match, Michaels Superkicked Edge starting a feud between the two<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/newyearsrevolution05.html New Year's Revolution 2005 Results]</ref>.

At the [[Royal Rumble (2005)|2005 Royal Rumble]], Michaels was defeated by Edge, who pinned him using the ropes for leverage<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble05.html Royal Rumble 2005 Results]</ref>. Michaels went on to compete in the Rumble match later that night and eliminated [[Kurt Angle]]. In retaliation, Angle returned to the ring and eliminated Michaels. Angle then put Michaels in the Ankle Lock<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble05.html Royal Rumble 2005 Results]</ref>. As a result of what happened at the Royal Rumble, Michaels issued a challenge to Angle for a match at [[WrestleMania 21]], which Kurt Angle accepted when he appeared on ''RAW'' to attack Michaels<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/050228.html RAW - 25th February 2005 Results]</ref>.

The following week, Michaels approached ''RAW'' General Manager [[Eric Bischoff]] demanding a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari.

On the [[July 4]], [[2005]] edition of ''RAW'', Michaels and [[Hulk Hogan]] fought Kurt Angle and then-Intercontinental Champion [[Carly Colón|Carlito]] in a tag team match.

Prior to the 2005 SummerSlam, neither Hogan nor Michaels had lost in a one-on-one match at SummerSlam. Hogan defeated Michaels at SummerSlam. After the match Michaels extended his hand to him, saying "''I needed to know, and I found out''" and he and Hogan shook hands. Michaels left the ring to allow Hogan to celebrate with the crowd and Michaels turned face once more<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/summerslam05.html SummerSlam 2005 Results]</ref>.

Michaels began a feud with [[Chris Mordetsky|Chris Masters]]. The pair faced each other in a match at [[WWE Unforgiven#2005|Unforgiven 2005]] where Michaels would win via pinfall<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/unforgiven05.html Unforgiven 2005 Results]</ref>.

On the [[December 12]], [[2005]] edition of ''RAW'', Shawn Michaels competed against [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] for his shot in the Elimination Chamber at [[WWE New Year's Revolution#2006|New Year's Revolution]], in which he won by DQ when Triple H hit him with a chair for that exact purpose<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/051212.html RAW - 12th December 2005 Results]</ref>. Shawn Michaels appeared at the ''Tribute to the Troops'' where he defeated Triple H with Sweet Chin Music in a Boot Camp Match<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/051219.html Tribute to the Troops 2005 Results]</ref>.

On the following RAW, [[Vince McMahon]] lauded Michaels for his part in the [[Montreal Screwjob]]. Michaels said he was only being loyal to his company, but said he'd moved on and McMahon should move on as well. McMahon told Michaels he can "screw" him like he screwed [[Bret Hart]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/051226.html RAW - 26th December 2005 Results]</ref>, and he began setting unusual stipulations for Michaels' matches and interfering on behalf of Michaels' opponents<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060102.html RAW - 2nd January 2006 Results]</ref>. At [[WWE New Year's Revolution#2006|New Year's Revolution]], Michaels competed in the fourth Elimination Chamber Match (which also featured Chris Masters, Carlito, Kurt Angle, Kane, and eventual winner, WWE Champion John Cena). During the match he eliminated Kurt Angle, before getting eliminated himself by Carlito<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/newyearsrevolution06.html New Year's Revolution 2006 Results]</ref>.

During the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|2006 Royal Rumble]], to which Michaels entered twenty fifth, he eliminated [[MNM]] and [[Shelton Benjamin]] in succession to make it into the final six. At that point, Mr. McMahon’s music hit, and the WWE Chairman made his entrance. As HBK stared down McMahon, [[Shane McMahon]] made a surprising appearance, attacking Michaels from behind and eliminating him from the match. An irate HBK flipped out, running back into the ring and nailing [[Triple H]] with Sweet Chin Music before chasing the McMahons to the locker room<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble06.html Royal Rumble 2006 Results]</ref>.

After several weeks of attacks and stipulations, Michaels confronted McMahon in the ring and challenged him to a match. McMahon refused and attempted (unsuccessfully) to force Michaels to sign retirement papers<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060213.html RAW - 13th February 2006 Results]</ref>, after which Vince and Shane McMahon knocked HBK out with a steel chair<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060227.html RAW - 27th February 2006 Results]</ref>, followed by Mr. McMahon booking a match between himself and HBK at [[WrestleMania 22]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060306.html RAW - 6th March 2006 Results]</ref>. During a handicap match against the [[Spirit Squad]] Michaels former partner Marty Jannetty came down to help Michaels<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060220.html RAW - 20th February 2006 Results]</ref>. Vince McMahon offered Jannetty a contract if he would kiss his ass. The next week on ''RAW'' Jannetty refused to kiss McMahons ass, and took Chris Masters' "masterlock challenge" instead. Michaels tried to help Jannetty, which ultimately ended in Shane McMahon forcing a groggy Michaels to kiss Vince's ass<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060227.html RAW - 27th February 2006 Results]</ref>.

Michaels and [[Shane McMahon]] then met in a [[Street Fight]] at ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event]]''. Throughout the match, Vince interfered, allowing Shane to get the upper hand. But Michaels kept kicking out and refused to submit and again got the upper hand, superkicking Shane, but Vince knocked the ref down before the three count. Michaels went after Vince McMahon, which gave Shane enough time to hit Michaels with a low blow from behind. Shane applied the Sharpshooter, and Vince McMahon immediately ordered for the bell to be rung even though Michaels didn't tap out; an allusion to the [[Montreal Screwjob]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/snme/060318.html Saturday Night's Main Event - 18th March 2006 Results]</ref>.

On the ''RAW'' before WrestleMania, McMahon made a match between himself and WWE Champion John Cena. The stipulation was that Triple H would be handcuffed in McMahon's corner while Michaels was handcuffed in Cena's corner. During the match, McMahon low blowed Cena and freed Triple H with a second pair of keys. Triple H and McMahon then used a sledgehammer and a steel chair, respectively, to attack Cena and the handcuffed Michaels<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060327.html RAW - 27th March 2006 Results]</ref>.

Despite interference from The Spirit Squad and Shane McMahon, Michaels defeated Mr. McMahon at WrestleMania 22 in a bloody No Holds Barred match. The match is noted for being the starting of the DX reunion that was soon to come<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania22.html WrestleMania 22 Results]</ref>.

At [[WWE Backlash#2006|Backlash 2006]], Michaels (with "[[God]]" as his tag team partner) lost to Vince and Shane McMahon with help from the [[Spirit Squad]] in a no DQ match that saw Michaels suffer a partially broken nose<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/backlash06.html Backlash 2006 Results]</ref>. Michaels would go on to get some revenge on the Spirit Squad in various ways but by [[May 22]], [[2006]] the Squad would, in [[kayfabe|storyline]], injure Michaels' knee, an angle that was written so Michaels could have surgery on his knee, which had been legitimately injured for some time<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060522.html RAW - 22nd May 2006 Results]</ref>.

===Return of D-Generation X===
[[Image:HBK-X-2.JPG|thumb|left|Shawn Michaels showing the DX "X"]]
In [[2006]], a series of events took place which suggested a reunion of Shawn Michaels and Triple H as [[D-Generation X]] starting at ''[[WrestleMania 22]]'' where both Shawn Michaels and Triple H performed the crotch chop during their matches<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania22.html WrestleMania 22 Results]</ref>. The two continued to deliver chops in the following episodes of ''[[WWE Raw|WWE RAW]]'' as Michaels feuded with Vince McMahon and Triple H went for the [[WWE Championship]], repeatedly butting heads with Vince McMahon in the process.

On the [[June 12]], [[2006]] edition of ''RAW'', DX officially reunited. During Triple H's gauntlet match against the [[Spirit Squad]], Shawn Michaels came in to help Triple H, and the two did the DX "crotch chops"<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060612.html RAW - 12th June 2006 Results]</ref>. At [[WWE Vengeance#2006|Vengeance 2006]], DX defeated the Spirit Squad in a 5-on-2 [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/vengeance06.html Vengeance 2006 Results]</ref>. After the win, the group continued its sophomoric antics at the expense of The Spirit Squad, [[Vince McMahon]], [[Shane McMahon]] and [[Jonathan Coachman]] for several weeks.
They then defeated the Spirit Squad at ''[[WWE Saturday Night Main Event]]'' in a 5-2 elimination match<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/snme/060715.html Saturday Night's Main Event - 15th July 2006 Results]</ref>, and went on to defeat [[The McMahons]] (Vince and Shane) at [[SummerSlam (2006)|SummerSlam 2006]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/summerslam06.html SummerSlam 2006 Results]</ref>. They then again defeated The McMahons, but this match also involved [[Paul Wight|Big Show]] in a [[Hell in a Cell]] match at [[WWE Unforgiven#2006|Unforgiven 2006]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/unforgiven06.html Unforgiven 2006 Results]</ref>. 

At [[WWE Cyber Sunday#2006|Cyber Sunday 2006]] DX took on [[Rated-RKO]] ([[Adam Copeland|Edge]] and [[Randy Orton]]). The fan-selected referee [[Eric Bischoff]] allowed the illegal use of a steel chair to give Rated RKO the ill-gotten win, and the plaudit of being the first tag team to defeat DX in a tag team match since their reformation in June 2006<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/cybersunday06.html Cyber Sunday 2006 Results]</ref>. However, at [[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series 2006]], Team DX emerged victorious, in a clean sweep of Team Rated-RKO<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/survivorseries06.html Survivor Series 2006 Results]</ref>.

====2007====   
At [[WWE New Year's Revolution#2007|New Year's Revolution 2007]], Michaels partner, Triple H suffered a ([[Legit (professional wrestling)|legit]]) torn right [[quadriceps]] during their match with Rated-RKO<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/newyearsrevolution07.html New Year's Revolution 2007 Results]</ref>. Rated-RKO claimed victory over DX, citing the injury as the "end" of DX<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/070108.html RAW - 8th January 2007 Results]</ref>. On January 15, 2007 HBK lived up to his vow of "dealing" with RKO when he took out Orton with a con-chair-to after a handicap match against Orton and Edge<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/070115.html RAW - 15th January 2007 Results]</ref>.
  
On the January 29, 2007 edition of ''RAW'', Michaels captured the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] for the fourth time from Rated-RKO alongside WWE Champion [[John Cena]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/070129.html RAW - 29th January 2007 Results]</ref>. He then won a triple threat number one contender's match on another edition of ''RAW'' to earn a shot at the WWE Championship.
On April 1st at [[WrestleMania 23]], Michaels was defeated by Cena with the [[WWE Championship]] on the line, after he was forced to submit to the STFU<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania23.html WrestleMania 23 Results]</ref>. The next night on ''RAW'', Michaels and Cena competed in two back-to back 10 team [[battle royal]]s, winning the first against Booker T and Finlay, and lost the tag team title in the 2nd battle royal when Michaels threw Cena over the top rope. The eventual winners were the [[Hardy Boyz|The Hardys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/04022007/ |title=April 2, 2007 RAW Results|accessdate=2007-04-05 |format= |work=|quote=In one of the most surprising twists in sports-entertainment history, Michaels would toss his own partne ''[sic]'' over the top rope, eliminating them both and effectively handing over their World Tag Team gold!}}</ref> On the [[April 23]] edition of ''RAW'', Michaels beat Cena in a Wrestlemania rematch, pinning him after hitting a Sweet Chin Music. The match lasted nearly an hour and was described by announcers Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler as one of the best matches in the history of RAW. At [[WWE Backlash|Backlash 2007]] Michaels came close to winning the [[WWE Championship|WWE Championship]] in a Fatal 4-Way Match, even hitting his [[Superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] on [[John Cena|John Cena]], but Cena landed on a knocked out [[Randy Orton|Randy Orton]] for the 3-count to retain the title.

*'''Entrance music'''
*The song "Sexy Boy" was originally written for Michaels by [[Jimmy Hart]]. Hart thanked Michaels personally for continuing to use the song as his entrance music when he was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2005. Michaels' entrance music was originally performed by [[Sherri Martel]] until she went face, and then the second version was performed by Shawn Michaels himself with traces of Sherri in the chorus portion of the song. The current version of the song in use today is the original Michaels version. Michaels says that the song was the product of "magic" because how it originally sounded right after recording was simply "brutal."
*Since the return of [[D-Generation X|DX]], Michaels mostly uses the DX entrance "Break It Down", by [[The Chris Warren Band]], even when wrestling in singles competition, but has recently went back to using his original entrance music.

==Personal life==
Michaels is the third son and last child of Richard and Carol Hickenbottom. His older siblings are Shari, Scott, and Randy.

Michaels marriage to his first wife, Theresa, was brief and ended in divorce. He is now married to former WCW [[Nitro Girls|Nitro Girl]], [[Rebecca Curci|Whisper (Rebecca Curci)]]. They were married on [[March 31]], [[1999]] at the Graceland Wedding Chapel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. It was a very small wedding ceremony. The only people present were Shawn Michaels, Rebecca Curci, and an [[Elvis]] impersonator.

Michaels and Curci have a son, Cameron Kade (born on [[January 5]], [[2000]]) and a daughter, Cheyenne Michelle (born on [[August 19]], [[2004]]). During a short period of time around 2006, rumors were going around that Michaels was going to take time off from the ring because his wife was pregnant with a third child, but it is unclear if that is true.

Michaels has several tattoos. He has a tattoo of a heart with a sword through it with what appears to be a snake around it in the shape of an "S". He has one in his wedding finger, that has an ''R'' for his wife [[Rebecca Curci|Rebecca]]. Another in his left wrist, it's a bracelet design that says: '''Cameron''' for his son. On his left leg he has a picture of his wife, the other leg has a picture of the state of Texas. And he has a small heart with the letters "HBK" above it, tattooed on his right hip.

Michaels' return to the WWE at [[SummerSlam 2002]] was supposed to be a 'one night only' show; Jim Ross even informed the audience that "Michaels is gonna leave us with something to remember him by" and "this is a one night performance from Shawn Michaels". However, after discovering he could still perform 100% in the ring, he gradually went back into wrestling full-time.

Michaels is [[Ambidexterity|ambidextrous]]. He uses his right hand to draw and color, and his left hand to write. He typically uses his right leg to deliver Sweet Chin Music, but sometimes uses his left leg for an enziguiri. 

Michaels is a [[born again Christian]]. His ring attire often incorporates cross symbols, and while on the way to the ring, he normally gets down on his knees and mouths a prayer while his pyrotechnics go off. He has been seen in the congregation during a televised service of Cornerstone Church in his hometown of San Antonio. He also appeared on a [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] program along with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

He is a fan of the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. He has been seen wearing Spurs merchandise and attending Spurs games. JBL made a reference to Michaels being a season ticket holder during the 2007 Royal Rumble Match.

Michaels is the cousin of TNA wrestler [[Matt Bentley]].
