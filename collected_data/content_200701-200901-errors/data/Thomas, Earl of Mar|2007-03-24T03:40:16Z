'''Thomas of Mar''' is the tenth known [[Mormaer]] of [[Marr|Mar]] ([[1332]]-[[1374]]). He was a son of [[Domhnall II, Earl of Mar|Domhnall II of Mar]].

Thomas became earl of Mar whilst still a child living in the [[Kingdom of England]], and it took several years for Thomas to return to the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and take charge of his inheritance. He had a fairly successful career in Scottish politics, becoming [[Great Chamberlain of Scotland]], and several times acting as an ambassador to England. 

He married twice, firstly to , Margaret Graham of [[Menteith]], and secondly to Margaret [[House of Stewart|Stewart]], [[Earl of Angus|Countess of Angus]]. He was succeeded by his sister Margaret, who was married to William Douglas. He died childless in [[1374]], bringing his line and the ancient [[Gaels|Gaelic]] earldom of Mar through the male line to an end. The earldom passed into the Douglas empire.
