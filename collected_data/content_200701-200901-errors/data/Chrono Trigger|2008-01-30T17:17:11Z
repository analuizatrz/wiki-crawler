{{nihongo|'''''Chrono Trigger'''''|クロノ・トリガー|Kurono Torigā}} is a [[console role-playing game]] [[video game developer|developed]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] [[video game console]]. It was first released on [[March 11]], [[1995]] in [[Japan]] and on [[August 22]], [[1995]] in [[North America]]. The game's story follows a group of young adventurers who travel through time to prevent a worldwide future catastrophe. 

''Chrono Trigger'' was developed by a group called the "Dream Team"<ref name="Dream-team-name">'''Keizo Kokubo:''' Well then, open the Gates to the Dream Team! ... / '''Developer's Ending:''' Cheers! You made it to one of the endings! You're now a member of the Dream Team! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co. | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> consisting of [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], [[Kazuhiko Aoki]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] — known for their works on the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series — and [[Yuuji Horii]] and artist [[Akira Toriyama]], renowned for work on the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series.

Critics considered certain aspects of ''Chrono Trigger'' as revolutionary, including multiple endings, plot-related character development-focused [[Quest (gaming)#Side-quest|sidequests]], a unique battle system, and detailed graphics.<ref name="npreview1">{{Cite book | year=1995 | author=Averill, Alan | title=Nintendo Power July, 1995 | pages=52 | language=English | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> [[Square Co.|Square]] re-released a ported version by [[TOSE]] in Japan for the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation]] during [[1999 in video gaming|1999]], later repackaged with a ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' port as ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' in [[2001 in video gaming|2001]]. It has never been released in [[PAL region|PAL]] territories.

==Gameplay==
''Chrono Trigger'' features standard [[console role-playing game|RPG]] gameplay with various innovations. The player assumes control of the protagonist and his companions in the game's [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[fictional universe|fictional world]], consisting of various forests, cities, and [[Dungeon (computer game)|dungeons]]. Navigation occurs via an [[overworld]] map, depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Locations such as cities and forests are represented by more realistically scaled field maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay deviates from traditional RPGs in that, rather than [[random encounter]]s, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the field map itself rather than on a separate battle screen.<ref name="npreview2">{{Cite book | year=1995 | author=Averill, Alan | title=Nintendo Power July, 1995 | pages=53 | language=English | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> This concept had previously been featured in such titles as ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'', but was uncommon at the time for RPGs outside the [[Action role-playing game|action RPG]] genre.
[[Image:ChronoTriggerInside.PNG|thumb|256px|left|Example of a basic battle]]
Players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks and items to wound targets during battles. For both the playable characters and the [[central processing unit|CPU]]-controlled enemies, each attack reduces their number of [[hit point]]s (a numerically based [[life bar]]), which can be restored with potions or spells. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter — except for specific storyline-related battles that allow the player to lose. Players can equip characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power) in battle, and use various consumable items. Items and equipment may be purchased or found on field maps, often in [[Treasure chest (video games)|treasure chests]]. By exploring new areas and combating enemies, players progress through ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story.

''Chrono Trigger'' uses an [[Square Enix battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] system, a staple of Square's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game series designed by [[Hiroyuki Itō]] for ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''.<ref name="gafreview">{{cite web | author=Johnson, Robert | title=Final Fantasy IV Review | date=2003-04-28 | url=http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/review.php?reviewid=197 | work=http://www.gamesarefun.com/ GamesAreFun | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> Defined on-screen as "Active Time Battle 2.0", the game's system slightly differs from its predecessors. Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer dependent on the character's speed [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistic]] counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques, such as sword abilities, are handled through a system called "Techs". Techs deplete a character's [[Magic point]]s (a numerical meter that works like Hit Points), and often have special [[area of effect|areas of effect]]; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques may be used.<ref name="npreview2" /> Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others' to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono's sword-spinning ''Cyclone'' Tech can be combined with Lucca's ''Flame Toss'' to create ''Fire Whirl''. When characters with compatible Techs have enough Magic Points available to perform their techniques and are able to take action, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.

''Chrono Trigger'' features other unique gameplay traits, including [[time travel]]. Players have access to seven eras of the game world's history, and actions taken in the past affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete peripheral quests, and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called "time gates", as well as a [[Time travel|time machine]] named "[[Epoch (Chrono Trigger)|Epoch]]". Time travel scenes are rendered in [[Mode 7]] [[texture mapping]], also used in a [[racing game|racing]] [[minigame]] and other [[cut scene]]s. ''Chrono Trigger'' also supports a [[New Game Plus|New Game+]] option — after completing the game, players may start the game over using data from the previous session. Character [[Experience point|levels]], learned [[Skill (role-playing games)|techniques]] and equipment and items gathered copy over, while acquired money and some story-related items are discarded. Other unusual features of ''Chrono Trigger'' are that it can be completed without the protagonist in the party and that it features multiple endings.<ref name="nppreview">{{Cite book | year=1995 | author=Averill, Alan | title=Nintendo Power June, 1995 | pages=37 | language=English | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> The player's progress prior to the final battle determines which of thirteen endings — some with slight variations determined by small choices — the player will receive.<ref name="endings2">{{cite web | author=Pringle, Bill | year=2005 | title=Chrono Trigger Endings | url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/w/r/wrp103/wrp/ct_end.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070705181358/http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/w/r/wrp103/wrp/ct_end.html | archivedate=2007-07-05 | work=[http://www.personal.psu.edu/ Penn State Personal Web Server] | accessmonthday=May 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Some endings can only be viewed on a New Game+ session, in which the final boss can be challenged earlier than normally allowed. Square used the New Game+ concept in later titles, such as ''[[Vagrant Story]],'' ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', ''[[Parasite Eve series|Parasite Eve]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''.

[[Image:Chrono Trigger Magus battle artwork.PNG|thumb|256px|Promotional art illustrating Crono, Lucca, and Frog battling Magus]]
''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s seven playable characters come from different eras in the game world's history. ''Trigger'' begins in 1000 A.D. with [[Crono]], [[Marle (Chrono Trigger)|Marle]], and [[Lucca (Chrono Trigger)|Lucca]]. Crono is a [[silent protagonist]], characterized as a brave, fearless young man skilled with a [[katana]]. Marle is Princess Nadia of the Guardia kingdom — an active, spirited [[tomboy]] with a [[crossbow]]. Often at odds with her father, Marle hides her royal lineage to slip out of the castle. Lucca is a friend of Crono and a mechanical genius who wields a gun; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery. From 2300 A.D. hails [[Robo (Chrono Trigger)|Robo]], a robot with a bright and curious personality created to assist humans and outfitted with a powerful arm. Found dormant in the future, Robo is repaired by Lucca and joins the group out of gratitude.<ref name="characters">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Square Enix | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles instruction manual | pages=32–33 | publisher=Square Enix | language=English | id=SLUS-01363}}</ref>

From prehistory comes [[Ayla (Chrono Trigger)|Ayla]], a fierce, confident woman living in 65,000,000 B.C. Unmatched in strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village and leads her people in war against the Reptites with her bare fists. The last two characters — [[Frog (Chrono Trigger)|Frog]], and the optional character [[Magus (Chrono Trigger)|Magus]] — originate in 600 A.D. Frog is a former [[squire]] once named Glenn; Magus the warlock changed his body to that of an [[anthropomorphic]] frog and slew his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicated his life to protecting the queen of Guardia and avenging Cyrus by killing Magus. Magus is a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] and the leader of the Mystics, a race of demons and intelligent animals who war with humanity. Known as Janus in his childhood, he was the young prince of the Zeal kingdom destroyed by Lavos in 12000 B.C. The incident sent him forward through time; he plotted revenge against Lavos as he aged and brooded over the unknown fate of his sister, [[Schala]].<ref name="characters" /> Lavos, who ravaged the planet in 1999 A.D., is an extraterrestrial parasitic to the planet who harvests DNA and energy for his own evolution.

===Story===
''Chrono Trigger'' begins with the 1000 A.D. Millennial Fair, where Crono and Marle sample Lucca's new teleporation device. Marle volunteers, but disappears through a strange portal when the machine reacts with her pendant.<Ref name="portal">'''Taban:''' What's going on Lucca? WHERE IS SHE? / '''Lucca:''' The way she disappeared... It couldn't have been the Telepod! The warp field seemed to be affected by her pendant... {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> Crono asks to be sent through the machine to find her, and discovers he's traveled back 400 years. He meets Marle at Guardia Castle, and learns that a search party looking for the missing queen of that era found her instead.<Ref name="shes-marle">'''Queen:''' Fooled you, didn't I, Crono? / '''Marle:''' It's me! But everyone calls me, Leene! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> Marle then vanishes; Lucca arrives and claims that she's actually the princess of Guardia in 1000 A.D., and that since her ancestor was not rescued, Marle ceased to [[grandfather paradox|exist]]. With the help of a talking amphibian called Frog, Crono and Lucca rescue the real Queen, kidnapped by "Mystics" who worship the [[Wizard (character class)|wizard]] Magus. Marle reappears and the group returns to 1000 A.D., where Crono is placed on trial for allegedly kidnapping Marle. He's sentenced to death, but breaks free from the prison. With Marle and Lucca, he flees the king to nearby Guardia Forest, where they stumble into a time gate.
[[Image:CTLavos.jpg|thumb|right|259px|Lavos]]
They're shocked to find a devastated world filled with futuristic ruins, and uncover a video of the "Day of Lavos". The video shows a creature called Lavos erupting from the planet's surface in 1999 A.D and decimating the planet.<Ref name="dayoflavos">'''Marle:''' Say, what does this button do? / '''Lucca:''' 1999 A.D.? Visual record of The Day of Lavos... / ''''Marle:''' Wh, what...IS that? / '''Lucca:''' Lavos?...

Crono and his friends hear that Magus created Lavos during the Middle Ages of 600 A.D., and that only a sword wielded by the "Hero" called the Masamune can defeat him.<Ref name="lavos-created">'''Heckran:''' If only the great Magus who brought forth Lavos 400 years ago, had destroyed the human race! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> They find the sword's broken blade, deducting that the Hero is Frog and that the sword was somehow made by Melchior, who lives in 1000 A.D. Melchior notes that he needs Dreamstone, a rock found only in antiquity, to repair the Masamune. The group travel to 65,000,000 B.C. and meet the cavewoman Ayla, who gives Crono her Dreamstone after a friendly drinking contest.<Ref name="frog'sresolve">'''Frog:''' This sword... 'Tis the Masamune? I must ponder this turn of events. Remain'eth here the night. ... / '''Frog:''' Awaketh, Crono. Though we may fail... ...let us go to Magus's lair. {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref>
[[Image:CTmeetmagus.JPG|thumb|left|259px|Confrontation with Magus]]
Melchior repairs the sword, and Frog accompanies Crono as they set out to Magus's lair. They battle his three generals and confront the warlock in the process of casting a spell. Magus claims he did not create Lavos, who dwells within the planet to siphon its energy — but merely intended to summon it.<Ref name="only-summoned">'''Magus:''' You fools! I only «summoned» him! He lives in the inner earth, absorbing the land's power and growing ever stronger! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> The spell's interruption causes a massive time gate that swallows Magus's castle and everyone within. Crono and his friends awaken in 65,000,000 B.C.; after helping Ayla defeat the Reptites, they witness Lavos crash deep into the earth from above. Agreeing that Lavos is an extraterrestrial lifeform, the group travels to the ancient, enlightened Kingdom of Zeal in 12,000 B.C. Zeal recently discovered Lavos and seeks to drain its power to achieve immortality through the Mammon Machine. A mysterious prophet warns the kingdom's queen about Crono, forcing their return to prehistory with no way back. At the End of Time, they learn of a time machine constructed in the future called the Wings of Time (or ''Epoch'').

They travel back to Zeal, where the Ocean Palace will soon be activated. Lavos awakens, disturbed by the Mammon Machine, and the prophet reveals himself to be Magus before attempting to kill the creature.<Ref name="magusrevealed">'''Magus:''' I've waited for this... I've been waiting for you, Lavos. I swore long ago... that I'd destroy you! No matter what the price! It is time to fulfill that vow. Feel my wrath, Lavos!! ... / '''Magus:''' Aaah!! My powers are being drained! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> Crono stands up to Lavos but is vaporized by a powerful blast. Schala, Zeal's princess, selflessly saves Magus and Crono's friends by transporting them to safety. Lavos destroys the kingdom of Zeal, causing tidal waves to reshape the planet. Soon after, Dalton from Zeal declares himself ruler of the world via the Blackbird airplane. He detains the group and impounds the Epoch, which his henchmen modify to fly. Crono's friends defeat Dalton atop the redesigned Epoch and meet on the surface with Magus, who admits that he's the young prince Janus, and plotted to summon and kill Lavos in 600 A.D.<ref name="janus">'''Magus:'''Behold. Everything's at the bottom of the sea. Gone is the magical kingdom of Zeal, and all the dreams and ambitions of its people. I once lived there... But I was another person then. ... / '''Marle:''' You're... ...Janus, aren't you? ... / '''Magus:''' Ever since Lavos's time portal stranded me in the Middle Ages... I have waited to even the score. {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref> Magus offers to fight the group and claims that a sage named Gaspar can revive Crono; he joins the party unless battled.<ref name="gaspar">'''Magus:''' You know, there just might be a way to bring him back. ... / '''Magus:''' Gaspar, the Guru of Time, knows how to restore lost or misplaced time streams... {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English }}</ref><ref name="magusjoins">'''Magus:''' You wish to fight me? / '''Player's choice:''' No. / '''Frog:''' Vanquishing thee will neither return Crono nor Cyrus. / '''Magus:''' Wait.

Crono and his friends then attack Queen Zeal in her risen Ocean Palace fortress and destroy the Mammon Machine at its heart. The Queen calls forth Lavos, and the team penetrate the creature's shell either through fierce fighting or by crashing the Epoch into it. They learn that Lavos has been harvesting [[DNA]] to control its own evolution.<ref name="lavos-purpose">'''Lucca:''' It lives on a planet for as long as possible, stealing away the most vital resources...

A few months prior to ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s market release, a [[Development stage#Beta|beta version]] was given to magazine reviewers and game stores.

==Music==
{{main|Chrono Trigger Original Sound Version}}
''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[soundtrack]] was scored by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] and veteran ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. Previously just a sound programmer, Mitsuda demanded to be composer for a new game or else he'd quit — and was surprised to be granted the job of scoring ''Trigger''.<ref name="powerup" /> He later reflected, "I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre...music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing."<ref name="powerup" /> After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, Uematsu joined the project to compose ten songs and finish the score.<ref name="powerup">{{Cite book | year=2004 | author=[[Chris Kohler|Kohler, Chris]] | title=[[Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life]] | publisher=DK Publishing | language=English | id=ISBN 0-7440-0424-1}}</ref> Mitsuda considers ''Chrono Trigger'' a landmark title in his history which helped mature his talent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=5478 |title=Yasunori Mitsuda Interview |accessdate=2007-05-22 |last=Gay |first=James |date=2006-10-13 |work=[http://palgn.com.au/ PAL Gaming Network] |publisher=}}</ref> At the time of the game's release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented; the soundtrack spanned three discs in its 1995 commercial pressing.<ref name="npreview1" /> Square also released a one-disc [[acid jazz]] arrangement called "''[[The Brink of Time]]''" by [[Guido (jazz band)|Guido]] that year. In 1999, Square produced another one-disc soundtrack to complement the PlayStation release of ''Trigger'', featuring [[orchestra]]l tracks used in [[cut scene]]s. Yasunori Mitsuda also composed four new pieces for the game's bonus features which weren't included on the soundtrack. Recently, Mitsuda arranged versions of music from the ''Chrono'' series for [[Play!

An enhanced [[porting|port]] of ''Chrono Trigger'' for the Sony PlayStation was developed by [[TOSE]] and released by [[Square Co.|Square]] in Japan in 1999. Square timed its release before that of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' to allow new players familiarity with the story of ''Trigger''.<Ref name="ultimania" /> This version included [[anime]] cut scenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's [[Bird Studio]] and animated by [[Toei Animation]], as well as several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game.

==Sequels==
''Chrono Trigger'' inspired several [[sequel]]s and [[spin-off]]s; the first were three titles released for the [[Satellaview]] in 1995. They included ''Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special'', a [[racing game]] based on a [[minigame]] from the original; ''Chrono Trigger: Character Library'', featuring profiles on characters and monsters from the game; and ''Chrono Trigger: Music Library'', a collection of music from the game's soundtrack. The contents of ''Character Library'' and ''Music Library'' were later included as extras in the PlayStation rerelease of ''Chrono Trigger''. [[Production I.G]] created a 16-minute [[Original video animation|OVA]] entitled "''[[Nuumamonja: Time and Space Adventures]]''" broadcasted at the [[Japan]]ese [[V-Jump]] Festival of [[July 31]], [[1996]].<ref>{{cite web |title=時空冒険ぬうまもんじゃ～ |url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/contents/works_sp/0330_/index.html |author=Production I.G staff |publisher=[[Production I.G]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar |url=http://www.production-ig.com/contents/works/07_/000133.html |author=Production I.G staff |publisher=[[Production I.G]] |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref>

Square released a fourth Satellaview game in 1996, named ''[[Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki]]'' and written by Masato Kato, who felt that ''Trigger'' ended with "unfinished business".<ref name="ultimania" /> Functioning as a [[side story]] to ''Chrono Trigger'', ''Dreamers'' resolved a loose subplot from its predecessor.<Ref name="weeklyfamitsu">{{cite web | year=1999 | title=Weekly Famitsu | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Weekly_Famitsu.html | work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/ Chrono Compendium] | accessmonthday=July 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> A short, [[Interactive fiction|text-based game]] relying on minimal graphics and atmospheric music, the game never received an official release outside Japan — though it was later [[fan translation|translated]] by fans to English.<ref name="fantranslation">{{cite web | date=2003-04-15 | title=Chrono Trigger 2: Radical Dreamers | url=http://radicaldreamers.sourceforge.net/ | work=[http://demiforce.parodius.com/home.html Demiforce] | accessmonthday=July 2 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Square intended to release ''Radical Dreamers'' as an easter egg in the PlayStation edition of ''Chrono Trigger'', but Kato did not feel his work was up to standard and forbade it.<ref name="ultimania">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Chrono Cross Ultimania | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Ultimania_Developer_Interviews.html | pages=476–477 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-925075-73-X}}</ref>

Elements of its plot, including characters and setting, were later adapted to form the early sequences of a better known PlayStation sequel, ''[[Chrono Cross]]''. ''Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki'' was consequently removed from the series' main continuity and referred to as another dimension during ''Chrono Cross''.<Ref name="radicalcontinuity">'''Kid:''' Radical Dreamers...!?
