The '''Lhasa Apso''' is a small [[dog breed|breed]] of [[dog]] originally from [[Tibet]].  

==Appearance==
According to the American Kennel Club, Lhasa Apsos should measure about 10 to 11 inches at the [[withers]]. Males should weigh between 14 and 18 pounds, and females should weigh between 12 and 14 pounds. The forelegs should be straight, and the hindquarters should be well-developed and muscular. The breed standard requires dark brown eyes of medium size and a coal-black nose. 

The texture of the coat should beheavy, straight, hard, neither woolly nor silky, and very dense. A Lhasa's coat should be of good length.  All colors are equally acceptable, with or without dark tips to ears and beard. The tail should be carried in a tight screw over the back. The breed standard currently used by the American Kennel Club was approved July 11, 1978.[http://www.akc.org/breeds/lhasa_apso/index.cfm]

Lhasa Apsos typically live between 12-15 years, though some have been reported to live as long as 18 years.

==Temperament==
Lhasa Apsos are naturally happy, playful, and mischievous dogs. However, Lhasas are very intelligent and are known for being very independent. Because of these traits, they are often hard to train and can be rather manipulative of their owners. When properly socialized and trained, Lhasa Apsos make good family dogs, though like most small dogs they tend to associate with the adults of a family rather than the children. Lhasas require 20-30 minutes of daily exercise, making them good apartment dogs.

Originally bred as indoor watchdogs in Tibet, Lhasas have very keen hearing. However, unlike many other dogs who bark at seemingly nothing, Lhasas are capable of distinguishing everyday noise from out-of-the-ordinary sounds. An owner may go days or weeks without hearing a bark from the dog.

As one of the fourteen [[ancient dog breeds]], Lhasas have excellent health. The most serious health problem affecting the breed is renal dysplasia, a usually fatal kidney condition. Renal dysplasia is usually detected in puppies by breeders, and responsible breeders will not sell these dogs. In addition, because of their rather profuse coats, Lhasas need regular grooming. If a Lhasa is not properly groomed, it can suffer from matting.

==History==
For centuries, Lhasa Apsos served as indoor watchdogs in the Buddhist temples of Tibet. To this day, the Dalai Lama often provide Lhasa Apso puppies to visiting dignitaries.

The heavy coat of Lhasas can also be explained by the geographical features of Tibet: the temperature frequently drops below freezing thus making it hard for a dog to survive without sufficient insulation. Lhasas were rarely groomed by their owners thus allowing the breed to adapt to the harsh weather, although when they are in warm climates, such as the southwestern [[United States|U.S.]], many owners prefer to have the coats trimmed (the so-called "pet clip").

In 1901, Mrs. A. McLaren Morrison brought the Lhasa Apso to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]] where it was registered as an official breed in [[The Kennel Club]] in 1902.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The original American pair was a gift from [[Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama]] to C. Suydam Cutting, arriving in the [[United States]] in the early [[1930s]].  The [[American Kennel Club]] officially accepted the breed in 1935 in the Terrier group, and in 1959 transferred the breed to the Non-Sporting group.<ref>American Kennel Club: [http://www.akc.org/breeds/lhasa_apso/history.cfm "Lhasa Apso History"]</ref>

Recently, DNA analysis has identified the Lhasa Apso as one of the 14 most [[ancient dog breeds]].<ref>''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'': [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/search?src=hw&site_rea=sci&fulltext=ancient+dog+breeds Search query on article]</ref>

In the 1950s the Lhasa Apso and [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]] were accidentally bred creating a type of dog that later became known as the [[Kyi-Leo]] rare dog breed in the 1970s.
