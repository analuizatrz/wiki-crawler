'''Coconut water''' is the liquid [[endosperm]] inside [[young coconut]]s. As the coconut matures this liquid largely becomes absorbed into the flesh found in mature coconuts. Coconut water has long been a popular drink in the tropics. It is naturally fat-free and low in [[food energy]] (16.7 calories or 70 kJ per 100 g). Due to its sterility, [[pH]], mineral, and sugar content, coconut water had been successfully used as liquid in [[intravenous therapy]] in emergency situations.

Coconuts for drinking are packaged and sold in many places.  These are typically Thai coconuts whose outer green husk has been removed, and the remainder wrapped in plastic.  Coconut water can also be found in regular cans or [[tetra Pak|tetra paks]], and is also marketed as a [[sports drink]] because of its high [[potassium]] and mineral content which helps the body recover from rigorous exercise.

It can also be used as [[intravenous]] fluid resuscitation of patients with [[dehydration]] or [[hypovolemia]], because it is [[isotonic]] and [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]].
