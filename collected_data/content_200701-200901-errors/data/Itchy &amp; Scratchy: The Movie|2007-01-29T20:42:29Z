"'''Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie'''" is the 6th episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[List of The Simpsons episodes#Season 4 (1992-1993)|fourth season]]. It first aired on [[3 November]] [[1992]]. As punishment for Bart's misbehavior, Homer bans him from seeing the new Itchy & Scratchy movie forever.

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
After a Parent Night at Bart's school, Mrs. Krabappel tells Marge how she should discipline Bart more. Homer does, and Bart, after not watching his sister Maggie when he was supposed to, cannot see the new Itchy & Scratchy movie. No matter what Bart does (trying to sneak out, pleading, behaving well), Homer refuses.   Despite the fact that Homer feels bad that Bart really does want to see the movie, he believes that if he doesn't make at least some effort to discipline Bart now, he will never become something successful, like [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].

Bart doesn't see the movie until the future. In [[2034]], Bart is [[Chief Justice of the United States]], and Homer takes him to the Itchy & Scratchy movie.

==Cultural references==
* ''[[60 Minutes]]'' - Homer's threat of sending Grampa to the "crooked home we saw on ''60 Minutes''" (after he mumbles incoherently following Bart's prank) is a reference to the CBS [[newsmagazine]] and the investigative reports into nursing home abuse that aired on it.
* ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' - The scene where Bart prepares to put Snowball II into the microwave, after melting a toy [[James Bond]] mini-figure, is a spoof of the first James Bond theatrical release. 
* Simpsons voiceover [[pseudonym]]s - Lisa's remark that [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]] both provided voices for ''The Itchy & Scratchy Movie'', yet were not credited, references previous episodes were the actors provided guest voices using pseudonyms - Hoffman in "[[Lisa's Substitute]];" Jackson in "[[Stark Raving Dad]]" as Sam Etic and John Jay Smith respectively.
* ''[[Soylent Green]]'' - Homer's comment, "Mmmmm ... solyent green" (in the flashforward scene where said item is a concession item) is a reference to the 1973 science fiction movie about the synthetic food product named in the title.

* ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' - The 1928 "Itchy & Scratchy" short - where Scratchy is burned alive in the steamboat's [[furnace]] at the end of the film) is a spoof of the classic 1928 Disney short, which served as the debut for [[Mickey Mouse]].

==Trivia==
*The headlights of Homer's car turn dim when he honks 
*In 2034, the "Do not sell to this boy" poster is still hanging there
*Originally, the Itchy and Scratchy movie was supposed to be shown as the most violent, twisted cartoon ever, but the writers changed it to be just an ordinary episode of Itchy and Scratchy.
*Bart is briefly seen reading a [[novelization]] of ''Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie'' by [[Norman Mailer]].
* When Lisa says, "You wouldn't believe all the celebrities who had cameos! Dustin Hoffman! Michael Jackson!
