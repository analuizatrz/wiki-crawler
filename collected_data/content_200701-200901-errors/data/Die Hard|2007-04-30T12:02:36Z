'''''Die Hard''''' is a [[Hollywood]] action film released in [[1988]].  It was written by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza, starring [[Bruce Willis]], [[Bonnie Bedelia]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[William Atherton]], and directed by [[John McTiernan]]. A huge critical and commercial success, ''Die Hard'' propelled Willis' film career, giving him more credibility in action, dramatic, and musical roles, and established [[Alan Rickman]] as a popular portrayer of villains in American film. 

The movie is based on a [[1979]] novel by [[Roderick Thorp]] titled ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (1979 novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'', itself a sequel to the book ''[[The Detective]]'', which was previously made into a [[1968]] movie starring [[Frank Sinatra]]. 

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}

The film opens with [[New York City]] [[police detective]] [[John McClane]] arriving in [[Los Angeles]] to attempt a [[Christmas]] reunion with his estranged wife Holly. He is picked up in a [[limousine]] manned by the talkative driver Argyle and taken to Holly's place of work, a large office building named the [[Nakatomi Plaza]] after its corporate owner. Argyle waits for John in the building's underground parking garage. 

Joining the Nakatomi Christmas party, McClane meets his wife's boss Takagi and her sleazy co-worker Ellis. He finally finds Holly (after discovering she is now using her maiden name, Gennaro), and they immediately get into an argument.  Holly leaves John alone in a small room near the party, where he takes off his shoes in an attempt to deal with his [[jet lag]].

A gang of terrorists led by the German [[Hans Gruber]] invade and secure the building. The party-goers are subdued and Takagi is taken aside, where it is revealed that the group are pretending to be terrorists and plan to steal millions of dollars in [[bearer bond]]s from the building's main security vault. When Takagi does not provide the vault combination, he is killed and Theo, the gang's technical mastermind, begins disabling the sequential vault locks. 

McClane manages to slip away during the round-up of the party-goers, albeit without his shoes. His attempt to summon help via the building's fire alarm brings him into confrontation with a terrorist named Tony. Newly equipped with Tony's submachine gun and radio, escapes to the roof to again call for help, but the police refuse to respond until they overhear Tony's vengeful brother Karl attempting to shoot John. LAPD Sgt. Al Powell is sent to check the disturbance, but one of the gangmembers posing as a Plaza guard fools him into thinking all is in order. Chased through the building by Karl and the others, McClane secures the departing Powell's attention by dropping the body of one of his pursuers onto the hood of the officer's car.

The cops finally respond in force, but this merely accelerates Gruber's original timetable. Disgusted by the local police's inept handing of the situation, McClane continues his fight from within, with Powell as his only ally outside the building. After John captures the terrorists' vital supply of explosive detonators, Ellis foolishly attempts to negotiate a settlement and is murdered when he doesn't succeed. Gruber then finds himself in an unexpected face-to-face confrontation with John; the mastermind's attempt at pretending to be an escaped hostage is successful enough to recover the detonators and, by forcing John to run over glass shards, badly injure McClane's feet.

Back outside the building, an irresponsible TV reporter named Richard Thornburg finds out about McClane and goes to Holly's home for an easy news story, interviewing the couple's two young children. Seeing the report, along with a picture of the kids on Holly's desk, alerts Gruber to the fact that "Holly Gennaro" is John's wife. He takes her as a hostage.

After doctoring his wounds, John, wondering about Hans' presence on the top floor, investigates and finds out that the plan is to blow up the hostages on the roof of the building. Just as he moves to prevent this, he is delayed by a brutal fight with Karl. McClane gets the hostages back off the roof, but Gruber still sets off the explosion. John escapes the blast by tying a fire hose around his waist, jumping over the side of the building and blasting his way through the window into an office a couple of stories down. 

In the meantime, Argyle, after making cheerful use of the limo's many frills and thus unaware of the events happening right above him, gets wind of the situation through a radio report.  He manages to disable Theo, who is preparing the gang's getaway [[ambulance]], ramming the vehicle with his limo and giving the man a knockout punch. 

The film climaxes with a battered and beaten McClane confronting Gruber and gangmember Eddie one last time high up in the tower, with Holly being held at gunpoint. With only two rounds in a hidden gun taped to his back, McClane suckers Hans by pretending to surrender, then shoots him through the chest, turning to blast Eddie in the forehead as well. Gruber falls out the shattered window but pulls Holly with him. McClane manages to grab onto her, while Gruber attempts to finish them both off with his gun. Gruber is hanging on to Holly's [[Rolex]] watch, a gift from her boss. McClane undoes the band and Gruber falls thirty-two stories to his death.

As McClane and his wife leave from the building, the seemingly indestructible Karl suddenly reappears, brandishing his [[Steyr AUG]] in one final attempt to kill McClane. As McClane shields his wife, Karl is finally cut down for good by several bullets from an unseen shooter.  As the image comes into view, we see it is Powell who has saved his friend's life. (Powell had earlier confided to John that he had mistakenly shot and killed a teenager, an event which had rendered him emotionally unable to draw a gun at someone.)

McClane and Holly, finally safe, prepare to leave. Thornburg approaches them, still relentlessly angling for a story, and is punched in the face by Holly (who had been a horrified witness to Thornburg's TV interview with her kids). Argyle crashes his limo through the garage's security barrier, and the couple are driven away from the scene in the battered vehicle, kissing each other on the passenger seat while their driver vows to be with them to see how exciting their [[New Year's Eve]] will be, given how they spent their [[Christmas Eve]].

==Trivia==
*During the final scene in which Karl suddenly reappears for one final attempt to kill McClane, a music cue from [[James Horner]]'s score of ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' is heard.  The cue is "Resolution and Hyperspace" from the ''Aliens'' soundtrack, in which the first part of the track was ultimately unused in the original ''Aliens'' film.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

*In the German [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] the names and backgrounds of the German-born terrorists were changed into English forms (mostly into their British equivalents): Hans became Jack, Karl became Charlie, Heinrich turned into Henry etc. The new background depicted them as radical Irish activists having gone freelance and for profit rather than ideals. (This led to some odd plot holes in this movie and continuity problems with ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]''; there, the villain is considered to be the brother of Hans Gruber, yet he's German.) This was because German terrorism (especially by the [[Rote Armee Fraktion]]) was still considered a sensitive issue by the German government in the 1980s.

*In this film, Hans Gruber mocks McClane, telling him that this time "[[John Wayne]] doesn't go riding off into the sunset with [[Grace Kelly]]."  Willis responds, "That was [[Gary Cooper]], you asshole," in an obvious reference to 1952 western [[High Noon]].

* In the DVD version of the movie, some inside facts about the movie are revealed in the audio commentary, including:
**The Nakatomi building is actually [[Twentieth Century Fox]] headquarters, and the company charged itself rent for use of the (unfinished) building as if the production were simply another tenant of the building, as well as damages for the destruction of the sidewalk guardrail destroyed by the LAPD armored personnel carrier.
**In the scene where Rickman is lowered from the window (as Hans) to drop 30 stories, he was told that the stuntman would release him at the count of three. However, the stuntman let go at the count of two, which is why in the film he has such a surprised look on his face.
**The majority of the terrorists arrive in a truck, and it is noted that the van that they arrive in is not really large enough to hold the terrorists and the ambulance they were going to use to escape; at the time they filmed the scene where the terrorists walk out of the delivery van, the writers did not know exactly what the terrorists were going to use as a method of escape.
**The truck the terrorists use has the name "Pacific Courier", which means "Bringer of Peace".  This firm name is also used as the name on the airplane which is destroyed in the [[Keanu Reeves]] film ''[[Speed (film)|Speed]]''.
**It is often repeated that Bruce Willis ad-libbed his character's emotional plea to Powell (after pulling glass out of his foot), and that, upon learning of this fact, [[Terry Gilliam]] cast him as the lead in [[12 Monkeys]]. However, the script for Die Hard seems to indicate that Willis veered only very slightly from the originally written scene.

==Errors==
*While talking to the emergency operator using the walkie-talkie, McClane "interrupts" her, but this is impossible with half-duplex 2-way radios since each party has to release the push-to-talk button in order to cease transmission and then be able to hear the other party.
*The walkie-talkie is either a VHF or UHF, not HF radio, therefore not capable of transmitting in the 27.065MHz emergency channel of the Citizen's Band (Channel 9)
*When doctor Hasseldorf speaks about the terrorists he mentions the "Helsinki-syndrome". It's wrong, the real name is [[Stockholm syndrome]], making Harvey partly right when he follows up with "That's [[Helsinki]], [[Sweden]]". 
*McClane uses his gun as a support for his weight and lowers himself into the air shaft on its strap to evade Karl and the others chasing him - as he makes the lunge for the duct leading off the shaft, the stuntman misses the duct and appears to fall away from the wall, but the scene was kept and cuts to McClane grabbing the next duct down.
*Al, McClane's cop pal, hits his head when the terrorists were turning his car into "swiss cheese", leaving a big gash on his forehead but later on in the film the gash is no longer visible.
*During the shootout scenes, before the airshaft scene, McClane is wearing a white and bloody muscle shirt, when he gets out of the shaft, he is wearing a clean olive green tank top. This was explained in a deleted scene as being dust buildup from his trip through the airvents.

==Reception==
When ''Die Hard'' was released, it was considered one of the best action films of its era. This is probably in part due to the fact that there are few ''artificial'' [[plot point]]s in the story. It is said to have reinvented the action genre and set the 90s for action/thriller movies such as ''[[Under Siege]]'' and ''[[Speed (film)|Speed]]''.  "''Die Hard'' on a _____" became a common way to describe the plot of many of the action films that came in its wake.<ref> http://www.foxhome.com/diehard/trinity/dh1/</ref> The movie was also responsible for creating the "action star" archetype that is a far more fallible and human hero, wearing few pieces of clothing, speaking few words (including "one liners") and always having a rough look across their face.<ref>''The Movies of the Eighties'' (1990) by Ron Base and David Haslam.</ref> ''Die Hard'' grossed $80,707,729 at the U.S. Box Office.<ref name="yahoodiehard">[[Yahoo!]] Die Hard Movie Details</ref> 

It was highly acclaimed by critics<ref name="rottentomatoes_diehard">[[RottenTomatoes]] Aggregated Film Reviews</ref> and spawned two sequels ''[[Die Hard 2: Die Harder]] (1990) and [[Die Hard: With a Vengeance|Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995). The fourth film in the series, titled ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'' is currently scheduled for release on June 27th, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/ |title=Live Free or Die Hard (2007) |work=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>

==Video games==
{{main|Die Hard games}}

A number of [[video games]] based on the ''Die Hard'' series of films have been made, including ''[[Die Hard Trilogy]]'', ''[[Die Hard Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas]]'',  ''[[Die Hard Arcade]]'', ''[[Die Hard: Vendetta]]'', and ''[[Die Hard: Nakatomi Plaza]]''.  There was also a [[NES]] video game based on the original movie.

==Parodies==
*On the ''[[Ben Stiller Show]]'', the ''Die Hard'' series was parodied in a fictional film trailer of ''Die Hard 12: Die Hungry''. Stiller took the place of John McClane, defending a supermarket against terrorists, demanding millions of dollars of coupons on Christmas Eve.
*In ''[[National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1]]'' (mainly a parody of the ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' franchise), [[Bruce Willis]] (in a similar under shirt and pants as he had in Die Hard) emerges from a trailer that exploded from heavy gunfire waving a white flag, surrendering (thus in turn parodying [[Mel Gibson]] in ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'', where Rigg's trailer home is shot to pieces).
*The ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' episode [[Trapped with A Vengeance]] is similar to ''Die Hard''.
*A seventh-season episode of ''Charmed'', "[[Scry Hard (Charmed Episode)|Scry Hard]]", spoofed the title of the Die Hard movie.
*Internet [[sketch comedy]] group TeamTigerAwesome recut scenes from Die Hard into a black and white [[silent film]] retelling titled "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StuihXsyEqU The Ballad of John McClane]".
