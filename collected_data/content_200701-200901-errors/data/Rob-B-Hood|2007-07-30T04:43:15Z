=== Stunt choreography ===
''Rob-B-Hood'' features a number of stunts choreographed by the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]]. Jackie Chan continued his tradition of performing his own stunts, jumping from [[air-conditioner]] to air-conditioner to reach the ground from the top of a 10-storey apartment building.

=== Casting ===
The original idea was for two of his school brothers, [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]] to appear in the film alongside him, but that didn't happen. Only [[Yuen Biao]] appears in the film.

The film reportedly went over-budget due to delays caused by baby Matthew's excessive sleeping on set. Though this is expected of an infant his age, the tight schedule was unable to accommodate it.

==Cast==
*'''[[Jackie Chan]]''' as '''Thongs''', a professional burglar who has stolen a variety of expensive goods. He uses his stolen money to satisfy his compulsive gambling habit, to the point where he borrowed money from [[loan shark]]s. He has fallen out with his father with his dishonest life, resulting in the latter having a stroke.
*'''[[Louis Koo]]''' as '''Octopus''', a fellow professional burglar working with Thongs. Octopus uses his loot to buy expensive cars and court a rich girl. Resenting his early marriage with his wife, Octopus neglects her, forcing her into countless dead-end jobs to make ends meet.
*'''[[Michael Hui]]''' as the '''Landlord'''. An expert in cracking safes, the Landlord has trained Thongs and Octopus to steal for over 20 years. Unlike his trainees, the Landlord does not spend his share of the loot, stashing it in a [[safe]] at home instead.
*'''Matthew Medvedev''' (or simply Baby Matthew) as the '''Baby''' son of the wealthy Lee family. He is kidnapped by Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord on behalf of a [[triad]] boss.
*'''[[Yuen Biao]]''' as '''Inspector Mok''', a policeman who attended the same secondary school as Thongs. Mok is in charge of the case involving the Baby's disappearance.
*'''[[Teresa Carpio]]''' as the '''Landlady''', wife of the Landlord. Driven mad by the death of her only son due to [[meningitis]] many years ago, the Landlady nowadays carries a doll of a baby boy with her at all times.
*'''[[Gao Yuanyuan]]''' as '''Melody''', a studen nurse from the [[Peking University]]. She works as a part time childcare consultant, teaching Thongs and Octopus how to take care of the Baby.
*'''Chen Baoguo''' as the '''triad boss''', who thinks the Baby is his grandson. Having lost his son, who fell to death following a violent struggle for the Baby in a hospital, the boss will stop at nothing to capture the Baby for his son's sake.

==Plot==
Having stolen money from the safe of a hospital, Thongs and Octopus are discovered and chased by security guards. Meanwhile, a Baby newly born to the wealthy Lee family is snatched by his mother's ex-boyfriend. As a result, the security guards ignore Thongs and Octopus, pursue the ex-boyfriend and trap him on an escalator. After a violent struggle, he falls off, taking the Baby with him. Thongs and Octopus manage to grab the Baby with the help of a nurse named Melody, holding on to him long enough for several medical staff to catch him. The two then escape with the Landlord in a minivan. 

One day, the Landlord's flat is burgled, his safe full of notes cleaned out. Desperate to regain his lost fortunes, he accepts a job from his middleman Uncle Seven to kidnap the Baby from the wealthy Lee family's mansion. The trio heads to Lobster Bay, Sai Kung to hand the Baby to their clients, the triads. Unfortunately, the Landlord crashes their vehicle down a slope in an attempt to evade a police road block. Per the stuck Landlord's instructions, Thongs and Octopus leave with the baby, bringing him to the Landlord's flat before the police catch up.
 
The Landlord, detained for dangerous driving, phones Thongs from the police station informing him of the Baby's potential value. Thongs is hence instructed not to hand the Baby over to anyone before the Landlord's release and given the task of taking care of him. As the days roll by, Thongs and Octopus develop a strong bond with the baby and begin to regret their vices: Thongs resists the urge to gamble, while Octopus feels sorry for cheating on his wife.

Meanwhile, both the triads and the police are after the baby. The triad boss, enraged by the non-delivery of his "grandson", locks Uncle Seven in a sub-zero dining room built for his deceased son. He sends his men to retrieve the Baby from Thongs' flat. On that same day, Police Inspector Mok follows Thongs to his flat, questioning him about the Baby, who is discovered, prompting Thongs and Octopus to flee with him. Having failed to snatch the Baby, the triads grab the Landlord as he is released from police custody and brings him to the triad boss, who now offers [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]30 million for the Baby. 

The Landlord finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the Baby is receiving treatment for fever. The Landlord shows them the HK$5 million deposit received from the triads, but Thongs and Octopus are more concerned about the Baby than the cash. The two, however, agree to bring the Baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord is waiting with the rest of the money. All seems fine, until the three see the nurses taking a blood sample from the Baby. Thongs and Octopus have a flashback of the days they spent with the Baby, and are overcome by their feelings with him. They fight their way into the triad boss' private amusement park in an attempt to recover the Baby while the Landlord flees with the money. Thongs almost manages to escape with the Baby, but is forced to surrender himself when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.

Thongs and Octopus are taken to the triad boss, who insists the Baby is his. However, he is proven wrong by the blood test. Driven mad, the boss places the Baby in the frozen dining room next to the his son's corpse. Thongs and Octopus decide to fight for the Baby, ending up trapped in the frozen room with two minions. Fortunately, they are saved when the Inspector Mok arrives with the Landlord, who swiftly cracks the lock to the room.

The baby is frozen unconscious. Thongs desperately attempts to revive him with a makeshift defillibrator, powered by a car battery. However, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an ambulance. Fortunately, his efforts are not entirely in vain, as the baby's heart is found to be beating weakly by the paramedics. Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord are imprisoned for kidnapping. Some days later, they make up with their loved ones during an open day of the prison. Inspector Mok arrives, informing the three that their sentences have been further reduced. The baby's parents arrive, thanking them for saving his life. As a token of appreciation, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord are offered jobs in their household as a bodyguard, driver and head of security respectively.
