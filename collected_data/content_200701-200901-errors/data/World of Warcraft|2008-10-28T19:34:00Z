'''''World of Warcraft''''' (commonly acronymed as '''''WoW''''') is a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG). It is [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s fourth released game set in the fantasy [[Warcraft universe|''Warcraft'' universe]], which was first introduced by ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]'' in [[1994 in video gaming|1994]].<ref>Excluding [[expansion pack]]s and the canceled ''[[Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans]]''.</ref> ''World of Warcraft'' takes place within the world of [[Azeroth (world)|Azeroth]], four years after the events at the conclusion of Blizzard's previous release, ''[[Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne]]''.

==Gameplay==
{{main|Gameplay of World of Warcraft}}

Unlike previous games in the ''[[Warcraft (series)|Warcraft]]'' series, ''World of Warcraft'' is a [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]], not a [[real-time strategy]] game. There are some similarities with previous games in the series, including the use of the same setting of the world of Azeroth as well as following a similar art direction.<ref name="gamespot_review">{{cite web |author=Greg Kasavin |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=World of Warcraft |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review |date=2004-11-30 |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}</ref> As with other MMORPGs, players control a character [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] within a game world, exploring the landscape, fighting monsters, completing quests and interacting with [[Non-player character|NPC]]s or other players. In common with many other MMORPGs, ''World of Warcraft'' requires the player to pay for a subscription, either by buying game cards for a pre-selected amount of playing time from a retailer, or by using a credit or debit card to pay on a regular basis.<ref name="gamespot_review"/>

In order to enter the game, the player must select a realm or server to play on. Each realm acts as an individual copy of the game world, and falls into one of four different categories depending on the rules that realm uses. Realms can be classed as [[Player versus player]] (PvP) where open combat between other players is allowed, or [[Player versus environment]] (PvE) where the focus is mainly on defeating monsters and completing [[Quest (gaming)|quests]]. [[role-playing game|Roleplay]] variants of each of these are also available.  On a PvP or RP-PvP server a player may create characters belonging to only one faction, either Horde or Alliance, but not both.  Realms are also categorized by language, with in-game support in the language available.<ref name="realm_types">{{cite web |author= |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |title=Realm Types |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/realmtypes.html |date= |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}</ref> Players can move established characters between realms for a fee.<ref name="gamespot_realm_xfer">{{cite web |author=Patrick Caldwell |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=Azeroth spreads out |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=6153338&mode=news |date=2006-06-29 |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref>

Once a realm has been selected, the player can either select one of their previously made characters to play or create a new one. Following on from the storyline in the previous games in the [[Warcraft (series)|Warcraft series]], players can choose their character to be a member of either the opposing factions of the Alliance or Horde. Only characters from the same faction can communicate, group with and trade with each other. From there a player selects which race, such as Orcs or Trolls for the Horde or Humans or Dwarves for the Alliance.<ref name="races">{{cite web |author= |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |title=Races |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/races/index.html |date= |accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> Players also select which [[Character class|class]] they wish their character to be, with choices such as mages, warriors and priests available.<ref name="classes">{{cite web |author= |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |title=Classes |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/index.html |date= |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}</ref> Some classes are limited to particular races. Players can further customize their characters as they play&mdash;as characters become more developed, they gain talents, allowing the player to improve the abilities of that character.<ref name="gamespot_preview1">{{cite web |author= |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=World of Warcraft Updated Hands-On Impressions - The Talent System Returns |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=6102351&mode=previews |date=2004-07-13 |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref> Professions such as tailoring, blacksmithing, mining, cooking and first aid can also be learned by characters.<ref name="proffesions">{{cite web |author= |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |title=Professions |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/professions/index.html |date= |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}</ref> While a character can be played on its own, players can also group up with others in order to tackle more challenging content. In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group.<ref name="party_roles">{{cite web |author= |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |title=Party Roles |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/partyroles.html |date= |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}</ref> Players can also team up their characters with others to form guilds, allowing characters in the same guild unified communications and a shared guild name and identity.

A large amount of ''World of Warcraft'' revolves around [[Quest (gaming)|questing]]. These tasks or missions are usually available from non-player characters (NPCs).<ref name="quests">{{cite web |author= |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |title=Quests |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/quests.html |date= |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}</ref> Quests usually reward the player with experience points and in-game money that the character can then spend on buying new skills and buying new equipment. It is also through the use of quests that much of the game's story is told, with NPCs sometimes performing a small routine once a quest is handed in.<ref name="gamespy_review" /> Sometimes, quests of this nature are linked together by a common theme. Where one quest ends, another starts, forming a quest chain.<ref name="quests" /> A unique aspect of ''World of Warcraft'' is the use of a "rested bonus" system, increasing the rate that a character can gain experience points after the player has spent time away from the game.<ref name="gamespot_preview1" />

Quests commonly involve killing a number of creatures, gathering a certain number of resources, finding a difficult to locate object, or delivering an item from one place to another. During this process, a character may get attacked and killed by a creature, becoming a ghost at a nearby graveyard.<ref name="ign_review" /> Characters can be resurrected by other characters that have the ability, or can self-resurrect by moving from the graveyard to the place where they died. If this location is unreachable, they can use a special NPC known as a spirit healer to resurrect at the graveyard.<ref name="death">{{cite web |author= |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |title=Death |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/death.html |date= |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}</ref> When a character dies the items being carried degrade, requiring in-game money and a specialist NPC to repair them. Items that degrade heavily can become unusable until they are repaired.<ref name="items">{{cite web |author= |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |title=Items |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/basics.html |date= |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}</ref>

As well as being able to complete quests and enter dungeons, players can also fight against other players in the game. ''World of Warcraft'' contains a variety of mechanisms for this. Firstly, some realms allow player versus player to take combat almost anywhere in the game world. In these environments, members of opposing factions can attack each other at any time. Player versus environment (PvE) servers, by contrast, allow a player to choose to engage in combat against other players. On both server types, there are special areas of the world where free-for-all combat is permitted.<ref name="gamespot_1.4" />

''World of Warcraft'' also makes use of battlegrounds. These locations act in a similar way to dungeons or instances in that only a set number of characters can enter a single battleground, but additional copies of the battleground can be made to accommodate additional players.<ref name="gamespot_1.5">{{cite web |author=Tim Surette |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=WOW patch opens new Battlegrounds |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=6127080&mode=news |date=2005-06-07 |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref> Each battleground has a set objective, such as capturing a flag or defeating an opposing general, that must be completed in order to win the battleground. Competing in battlegrounds rewards the character with tokens and honor points that can be used to buy armour and weapons. Initially a ladder-based system was implemented, where the honour points accumulated in a week would affect that character's standing in the ladder, allowing them to purchase more powerful weapons and armour.<ref name="gamespot_1.4">{{cite web |author=Tim Surette |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=WOW patched to v1.4 |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=6122496&mode=news |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref>

=== Setting ===

''World of Warcraft'' takes place in a 3D-representation of the Warcraft universe that players can interact with through their characters. The game features two continents on the world of Azeroth and a separate planet called Outland. In this game world, players use their characters to explore locations, defeat creatures and complete quests, among other such activities. By doing this, characters gain [[experience point]]s. After a set amount of experience points have been gained, a character gains a level, opening up the option of learning new skills or abilities, exploring new areas and attempting new quests.<ref name="ign_review" /> As a player explores new locations, a number of transport shortcuts become available. Players can discover "flight masters" in newly discovered locations and then use those NPCs in order to fly to previously discovered locations in other parts of the world.<ref name="gamespot_1.10" />  Players can also use facilities such as boats or zeppelins in order to move from one of the continents on Azeroth to the other. Although the game world remains reasonably similar from day to day, seasonal events that reflect on real world events such as Halloween,<ref name="gamespot_1.8" /> Christmas, Children's Week,<ref name="gamespot_1.4" /> Easter and Midsummer have been added. Locations can also have changeable weather such as rain, snow and dust storms.<ref name="gamespot_1.10">{{cite web |author=Tim Surette |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=WOW patched to 1.10 |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=6146732&mode=news |date= |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref>

A number of facilities are available to characters when in towns and cities. In each major city characters can access a bank in order to deposit items, such as treasure or crafted items. Each bank is unique to that character, with players able to purchase additional storage space.<ref name="gamespot_bank">{{cite web |author=Justin Calvert |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=World of Warcraft banking info |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=6090384&mode=news |date=2004-03-02 |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref> In the major cities of Azeroth, Auction houses also exist as a way for characters to sell items to others in a similar way to online auction sites such as eBay.<ref name="gamespot_ah">{{cite web |author=Tor Thorsen |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=Online auctions coming to World of Warcraft |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=6098955&mode=news |date=2004-05-21 |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref> Players can also use mailboxes, which can be found in almost every town. The mailbox can be used to collect items won at auction and also to send messages, items and even in-game money to other characters.<ref name="gamespot_preview1" />

<br /><br /><br />
Some of the harder challenges in ''World of Warcraft'' require players to group together to defeat them. These usually take place in dungeons, also known as instances, that a group of characters can enter together. The term comes from each group or party having a separate copy or instance of the dungeon, complete with their own enemies to defeat and their own treasure or rewards.<ref name="instances">{{cite web |author= |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |title=Instancing |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/instancing.html |date= |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref> This allows players to explore areas and defeat quests without other players outside the group interfering. Dungeons are spread over the game world and are designed for characters of varying progression. A typical dungeon will allow up to five characters to enter as part of a group. Players having difficulty finding groups to venture into a dungeon with can use meeting stones, which attempt to match characters with groups requiring particular skills or abilities.<ref name="gamespot_1.3" /> High end dungeons allow more players to group together and form a raid. These dungeons allow up to forty players to enter at a time in order to face some of the most difficult challenges.<ref name="gamespot_preview2">{{cite web |author=Andrew Park |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=World of Warcraft Updated Preview - Final Details, Player vs. Player, Future Updates |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=6113764&mode=previews |date=2004-11-23 |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref> As well as dungeon-based raid challenges, several creatures exist in the normal game environment that are designed for raids to attack.<ref name="gamespot_1.3">{{cite web |author=Tim Surette |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=World of Warcraft patched |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?page=1&sid=6120905 |date=2005-02-11 |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref><ref name="gamespot_1.8">{{cite web |author=Tim Surette |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=WOW v1.8 patch adds dragons, holiday festivities |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=6135509&mode=news |date=2005-10-12 |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref>

==Development==
''World of Warcraft'' was first announced by Blizzard at the [[European Computer Trade Show|ECTS]] trade show in September 2001.<ref name="ECTS">{{cite web|title=ECTS 2001:World of Warcraft|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=2810134|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Development of the game took about five years with extensive testing done to make sure everything was ready for launch. The 3-D graphics in ''WoW'' use elements of the proprietary graphics engine originally used in ''Warcraft III''.<ref name="ECTS"/> The game was designed to be an open environment where players are allowed to do what they please, alongside optional quests that players can complete to advance further in the game.<ref name="gamespot_preview">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=2809173&mode=previews |title=World of Warcraft Preview |accessdate=2008-03-08 |coauthors=Greg Kasavin, Amer Ajami |date=2002-09-01 |publisher=Gamespot}}</ref> In addition, the quests were made to help guide players to spread across different zones to try to avoid what developers called 'player collision'.<ref>{{cite web|title=World of Warcraft Preview - Page 2|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/previews/january04/wowpc/index2.shtml|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> The game interface was also designed to be easy to use allowing players to customize areas to their likings and also allows for add-ons and other modifications.<ref>{{cite web|title=World of Warcraft Preview - Page 6|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/previews/january04/wowpc/index6.shtml |publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref>

''World of Warcraft'' runs natively on both [[Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platforms. Boxed copies of the game use a [[hybrid CD]] to install the game, eliminating the need for separate Mac and Windows retail products. The game allows all users to play together, regardless of their [[operating system]]. Although there is no official version for any other platform, support for ''World of Warcraft'' is present in Windows [[application programming interface|API]] implementations [[Wine (software)|Wine]] and [[Cedega]], allowing the game to be played under [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=6482|title=Wine application notes for WoW}}</ref>

===Regional variations===
In the United States, Canada and Europe, Blizzard distributes ''World of Warcraft'' via [[retail software]] packages.<ref name="blizz_release_pr">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=6112390&mode=press |title=Blizzard Entertainment Announces World of Warcraft Street Date - November 23, 2004 |accessdate=2008-03-08 |date=2004-11-04 |publisher=Blizzard Entertainment}}</ref> The software package includes 30 days of gameplay for no additional cost. In order to continue playing after the initial 30 days, additional play time must be purchased using a credit card or prepaid game card. The minimum gameplay duration that a player can purchase is 30 days using a credit card, or 60 using a prepaid game card. A player also has the option of purchasing three or six months of gameplay at once for a slight (6% to 15%) discount. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blizzard.com/support/wowbilling/?id=abl01026p |title=Payment Options |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |date=2007 |accessdate=2007-04-25 }}</ref> In Australia, the United States, and many European countries, video game stores commonly stock the trial version of ''World of Warcraft'' in DVD form, which include the game and 14 days of gameplay, after which the player would have to upgrade to a retail account by supplying a valid credit card, or purchasing a game card as well as a retail copy of the game.

In South Korea, there is no software package or CD key requirement to activate the account. In order to play the game, however, players need to purchase time credits online via credit card or the ARS billing system. The minimum gameplay duration that a player can purchase via credit card is five hours. A player may also purchase game time by thirty hours or by increments of one week. A player also has the option of purchasing game time by one, three, or six months of gameplay at once for a slight discount.<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.co.kr/billing/ |title=Billing Guide |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |date=2006 |accessdate=2006-12-17 }}</ref> 

In China, because a large number of the players do not own the computer they use to play games (e.g. [[Internet cafe]]s), the CD keys required to create an account can be purchased independently of the software package. In order to play the game, players must also purchase prepaid game cards that can be played for 66 hours and 40 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wowchina.com/sales/pcard/index.shtml |title=Buyers' Guide |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |date=2006 |accessdate=2006-10-21 }}</ref> A monthly fee model is not available to players of this region. The Chinese government and ''The9'', the licensee for ''World of Warcraft'' in China, have imposed a modification on Chinese versions of the game which places flesh on bare-boned skeletons and transforms dead character corpses into tidy graves. These changes were imposed by the Chinese government in an attempt to "promote a healthy and harmonious online game environment" in ''World of Warcraft''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/07/03/10136373.html|title= Censorship reaches internet skeletons|publisher=Gulfnews|date=July 03, 2007}}</ref>

===Post-launch development===
[[Image:World Of Warcraft Launcher.png|thumb|right|200px|''World of Warcraft'' Launcher]]
The ''World of Warcraft'' Launcher (referred to in press releases and the menu bar as the "Blizzard Launcher") is a program designed to act as a starting point for ''World of Warcraft'' players. It was first included with the version 1.8.3 patch. The 2.1.0 patch allowed for an option to bypass the use of the launcher. Features of the launcher include news and updates for ''World of Warcraft'' players, access to ''World of Warcraft'''s support website, access to the test version of ''World of Warcraft'' when it is live on the test servers in order to test upcoming patches, updates to [[Warden (software)|Warden]],<ref name="warden_updates">{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/11/15/world_of_warcraft_warden_encryption/ |title=World of Warcraft spykit gets encrypted |accessdate=2008-03-08 |last=Modine |first=Austin |date=2007-11-15 |publisher=The Register}}</ref> and updates to the updater itself.

[[Patch (computing)|Patch]] 1.9.3 added native support for [[Apple-Intel architecture|Intel-powered Macs]], making ''World of Warcraft'' a [[Universal binary|Universal application]]. As a result of this, the minimum supported Mac OS X version has been changed to 10.3.9; ''World of Warcraft'' version 1.9.3 and later will not launch on older versions of Mac OS X.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/patch1p9.html|title="World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.9.3 (2006-02-07)" patch notes}}</ref>

Because new content is constantly being added to the game, official system requirements often change. In version 1.12.0 the requirements for Windows were increased from requiring 256&nbsp;MB to 512&nbsp;MB of RAM. Official [[Windows 98]] technical support was dropped, even though the game continued to run fine until version 2.2.3.<ref>
{{cite web |title=Technology FAQ |work=World of Warcraft Game Guide |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/faq/technology.html |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |date=2006 |accessdate=2006-09-06 |archivedate=2004-11-13 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041113080257/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/faq/technology.html|}} </ref> After version 2.2.3, the official patches to version 2.3.0 failed on [[operating system]]s earlier than Windows 2000. By knowledgeably using an old update executable with new patch data, Windows 98 and Windows ME users could update from 2.2.3 using one of the released patches. Once successfully upgraded, the new version of the game then worked with Windows ME, although version 2.3.0 did not work with Windows 98 Second Edition unless applying updates to the operating system, including an unofficial third party's operating system modifications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856223138&sid=1&pageNo=14#271 |title=Official ''World of Warcraft'' forum, thread on 2.3 patch issue for Win98/Me, post # 271 |date=2007 |accessdate=2007-11-21 }}</ref>

===Corrupted Blood plague incident===
{{main|Corrupted Blood}}
The Corrupted Blood plague incident was one of the first events to affect entire servers. Patch 1.7 saw the opening of Zul'Gurub, the game's first 20-player raid dungeon where players faced off against an ancient tribe of jungle trolls under the sway of the ancient Blood God, Hakkar the Soulflayer. Upon engaging Hakkar, players were stricken by a [[Buff (computer_gaming)#Debuff|debuff]] called "Corrupted Blood" which would periodically sap their life. The disease would also be passed on to other players who were simply standing close to an infected person. Originally this malady was confined within the Zul'Gurub instance but made its way into the outside world by way of hunter pets or warlock minions that contracted the disease.

Within hours Corrupted Blood had infected entire cities such as Ironforge and Orgrimmar because of their high player concentrations. Low-level players were killed in seconds by the high-damage disease. Eventually Blizzard fixed the issue so that the plague could not exist outside of Zul'Gurub.

The corrupted blood plague so closely resembled the [[outbreak]] of real-world [[epidemic]]s that scientists are currently looking at ways MMORPGs or other massively-distributed systems can model human behavior during outbreaks. The reaction of players to the plague closely resembled previously hard-to-model aspects of human behavior that may allow researchers to more accurately predict how diseases and outbreaks spread amongst a population.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6951918.stm BBC NEWS | Health | Virtual game is a 'disease model'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Audio===

The soundtrack for ''World of Warcraft'' was composed and arranged by [[Jason Hayes]], [[Tracy W. Bush]], [[Derek Duke]] and [[Glenn Stafford]]. It was released on November 23, 2004 together with the Collectors edition of the game. It is also sold separately on 1 CD, in the [[MP3]] format.

''World of Warcraft'' was almost universally praised by critics<ref name="metacritic_score" /> upon release, following a period of high anticipation before launch.<ref name="atrip_review" /> Although the game follows a similar model to others in the genre<ref name="gamespot_review" /> and was noted for having many familiar concepts from [[roleplaying game]]s,<ref name="1up_review" /> the new approaches to reduce pauses between game encounters was well liked.<ref name="gamespy_review" /> A common example was the new approach to character death; in previous [[MMORPG]]s a player would suffer a high penalty for character death, while in ''WoW'' a player would be able to recover and start playing quickly.<ref name="gamespot_review" /> Combat was another area where "downtime" or pauses between play were reduced. By allowing all character types to recover from damage taken, players could return to combat quickly.<ref name="gamespy_review" /> It was felt that these changes in pacing would make the genre more accessible to casual players, who would be able to play for short periods and still achieve something,<ref name="gamespy_review" /> while still having a depth of game that would attract players at all levels of interest in the genre.<ref name="ign_review" /> The concept of a "rested bonus", or increasing the rate at which a player's character gains experience was also welcomed as a way for players to quickly catch up with their friends<ref name="gamespot_review" />

[[Quest (gaming)|Questing]] was described as an integral part, often being used to continue a storyline or lead the player through the game.<ref name="gamespy_review" /> The high number of quests in each location was popular, as well as the rewards for completing them.<ref name="gamespot_review" /> It was felt that the range of quests removed the need for a player to "grind" or carry out repetitive tasks in order to advance their character.<ref name="ign_review" /> Quests also seemed to require players to explore every section of the game world, potentially causing problems for social gamers or roleplayers seeking somewhere quiet.<ref name="gamespy_review" />  Quests that required the player to collect items from the corpses of creatures they had killed were also unpopular, with a low "drop rate" or chance of finding the items required making them feel repetitive as a high number of creatures would need to be killed in order to complete the quest.<ref name="ign_review" /> Some critics mentioned a lack of quests that required players to group up made the game feel as if it was designed for solo play,<ref name="eurogamer_review" /> while others complained that some dungeon or instance-based group quests were not friendly to new players and could take several hours to complete.<ref name="ign_review" /> Upon release, a small number of quests had errors or [[Software bug|bugs]] that would make them impossible to complete,<ref name="gamespot_review" /> while the large number of new players in a particular area meant that there were often no creatures to kill,<ref name="gamespy_review" /> or that players would have to wait and take turns to kill a particular creature in order to complete a quest.<ref name="gamespot_review" />

Characters were felt to be implemented well, with each class option appearing "viable and interesting" while still having unique and different mechanisms,<ref name="eurogamer_review" /> and each of the races having a distinct look and feel.<ref name="gamespot_review" /> Character development was also liked, with the talent mechanism offering choice to players<ref name="1up_review" /> and profession options being praised.<ref name="gamespot_review" /> Character customisation options were felt to be low,<ref name="ign_review" /> but the detail of character models was praised.<ref name="atrip_review" />

The appearance of the game world was praised by critics. Most popular was the feature that a player could run from one end of the continent to the other without having to pause at a "loading screen" while part of the game is retrieved from storage.<ref name="atrip_review" /> The environment was described as "breathtaking", with players finding it difficult to become lost and each area in the game world having a distinct look that blends from one to the next.<ref name="gamespy_review" /> Critics described the environment as "a careful blend of cartoon, fantasy art, and realism".<ref name="1up_review" /> The game was found to run smoothly on a range of systems,<ref name="gamespot_review" /> although some described it as basic<ref name="gamespy_review" /> and mentioned that the [[bloom (shader effect)|bloom]] graphics effect can blur things.<ref name="ign_review" /> Having said that, one reviewer described being able to fly over long stretches of scenery as "very atmospheric".<ref name="eurogamer_review" /> The user interface was liked, being described as "simple", with [[tooltip]]s helping to get the player started.<ref name="gamespot_review" />

The audio was well received, particularly the background music. By assigning music to different areas of the game world, reviewers felt that the fantasy style added to immersion<ref name="1up_review" /> and that the replay value was increased.<ref name="ign_review" /> The sounds and voices used by characters and [[non-player character|NPC]]s, as well as the overall sound effects were felt to add a "personality" to the game.<ref name="1up_review" />

''World of Warcraft'' won several awards from critics upon release, including Editor's Choice awards.<ref name="ign_review" /><ref name="gamespot_review"/> In addition, it won several annual awards from the media, being described as the best game in the [[Role-playing game (video games)|RPG]] and [[MMORPG]] class.<ref name="gamespy_goty">{{cite web |title=Game of the Year Awards-PC Genre |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |url=http://goty.gamespy.com/2004/pc/index12.html |author= |date= |accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref> The graphics and audio were also praised in the annual awards, with the cartoonish style<ref name="gamespy_special">{{cite web |title=PC Special Awards |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |url=http://goty.gamespy.com/2004/pc/index16.html |author= |date= |accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref> and overall sound makeup<ref name="ve_audio">{{cite web |title=2004 PC Game of the Year Awards |publisher=Voodoo Extreme |url=http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/features/12150/2004-PC-Game-of-the-Year-Awards |author=Robert Howarth |date=2004-12-24 |accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref> being noted.

===Usage problems===

Since launch, ''World of Warcraft'' has faced a number of technical problems. In September 2005, Blizzard gave all European players two free days of play as compensation for repeated network failures. During the early days of ''World of Warcraft'''s U.S. release Blizzard also gave out free days to compensate players for days lost due to problems on their end. The issues were suspected to be Blizzard's [[upstream (computer science)|upstream]] [[Internet service provider]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=11371 |publisher=[[GamesIndustry.biz]] |title=Blizzard to compensate players for ''World of Warcraft'' problems |author=Ellie Gibson |date=2005-08-09 |accessdate=2006-10-21}}</ref>  Weaknesses of the [[client-server]] model used by ''World of Warcraft'' have also been [[exploit (computer security)|exploited]] in order to [[Crash (computing)|crash]] the [[Computer cluster|cluster]] of servers that make up a realm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/27/wow_exploit_crashes_servers/ |publisher=The Register |title=World of Warcraft exploit PKs servers |author=Austin Modine |date=2007-08-27 }}</ref> Exploits also include characters being able to instantly change location or [[teleport]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/21/hacking_mmorpgs/ |publisher=The Register |title=World of Warcraft exploit PKs servers |author=Dan Goodin |date=2007-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Hoglund | first = Greg | authorlink =[[Greg Hoglund]] | coauthors = Gary McGraw | title = Exploiting Online Games: Cheating Massively Distributed Systems | publisher = Addison-Wesley Professional | date = 2007-07-19 | pages = 384 | url = http://www.exploitingonlinegames.com/ | isbn = 0132271915}}</ref>

As ''World of Warcraft'' grew in popularity, players began to experience problems with connecting to and [[Logging (computer security)|logging in]] to the game. Cases include long delays waiting for usernames and passwords to be [[Authentication|authenticated]] or large queues on certain [[Realm (World of Warcraft)|realms]]. Sudden server crashes that would force realms offline also occurred. The situation became worse when trying to coordinate activities across a number of players or [[Clan (computer gaming)|guilds]] on the same realm. On May 3, 2006 [[Shane Dabiri]], ''World of Warcraft'' Lead Producer, stated that new realms would be introduced to relieve the burden on existing ones. Existing realms would be [[upgrade]]d. The paid migration service was also unveiled at this time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4974456.stm |title= Problems plague World of Warcraft |accessdate= 2008-02-25 |author=Mark Ward |date= 2006-05-05 |publisher= [[BBC]] }}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wow-europe.com/en/misc/battleplan-2006.html |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |title=Shane Dabiri's Battleplan: May 2006 |author=Shane Dabiri |accessdate=2008-03-04}}</ref> 

When a player creates a ''World of Warcraft'' account, they are asked to choose a username and password. Whenever the user then plays ''World of Warcraft'', he is asked to supply the same username and password in full. This is also the case when using account management facilities online. This type of authentication is vulnerable to [[Keystroke logging]]. While this is not unique to ''World of Warcraft'' and is common to many [[MMORPG]]s, the game has been directly targeted with [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] being specifically crafted to capture account login details<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/08/wowcraft/ |publisher=[[The Register]] |title=Trojan targets World of Warcraft gamers |author=John Leyden |date=2006-05-08 }}</ref>. Attacks have been reported as early as May 2006, although they may extend as far back as July 30, 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2005-073115-1710-99 |publisher=[[Symantec]] |title=Infostealer.Wowcraft |date=2007-02-13 }}</ref>

In September 2006, reports emerged of spoof ''World of Warcraft'' gaming advice websites that contained [[malware]]. Vulnerable computers would be infected through their [[web browser]], downloading a program that would then relay back account information. Blizzard's account support teams experienced high demand during this episode, stating that many users had been affected. Claims were also made that telephone support was closed for isolated periods due to the volume of calls and resulting queues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/09/29/warcraft_trojan_attack/ |publisher=[[The Register]] |title=Warcraft gamers locked out after Trojan attack |author=John Leyden |date=2006-09-29 }}</ref> In April 2007, attacks evolved to take advantage of further exploits involving animated cursors, with multiple websites being used.<ref>{{cite web

In June 2008, Blizzard announced the ''Blizzard Authenticator'', a hardware [[security token]] that provides [[Two-factor authentication|two factor]] security. The token generates an [[one-time password]] based code that the player supplies when logging on. The password is only valid for a limited time, thus providing extra security against keylogging [[malware]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://eu.blizzard.com/en/press/080626-ba.html |publisher=Blizzard |title=Blizzard Authenticator offers enhances security for World of Warcraft® Accounts |date=2008-06-26}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom in February 2008, the Halifax Bank claimed that stolen credit card details were regularly being used to fraudulently pay for ''World of Warcraft'' accounts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/15/halifax_blizzard_block/ |title=UK Bank blames fraudsters for World of Warcraft ban |publisher=[[The Register]] |date=2008 |accessdate=2008-02-15 }}</ref> A statement from the bank read that a "significant number of fraudulent transactions through Blizzard's gaming sites" had been observed. As a result, the Bank has stated that transactions with Blizzard will be blocked by default, requesting that customers contact them directly to authorise payments.

Blizzard makes use of a system known as [[Warden (software)|Warden]] on the Windows version of the game in order to detect [[Third-party software component|third-party]] programs, such as [[Internet bot|botting]] software, allowing ''World of Warcraft'' to be played unattended. There has been some controversy as to the legality of Warden. Warden uses techniques similar to [[anti-virus software]] in order to analyse other running software on the players' PCs, as well as the [[file system]]. However, unlike most anti-virus software, it sends a portion of this information back to Blizzard, which caused privacy advocates to accuse it of being [[spyware]].<ref>{{cite web |title=4.5 million copies of EULA-compliant spyware |author=[[Greg Hoglund]] |date=2005-10-05 |accessdate=2006-10-21 |publisher=rootkit.com |url=http://www.rootkit.com/blog.php?newsid=358 }}</ref>  One example of the information Warden collects is the title of every window open on the system while WoW is running.<ref>{{cite web |title=Warcraft game maker in spying row |author=Mark Ward |date=2005-10-31 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4385050.stm }}</ref> Blizzard has not stated what information is passed by Warden over the Internet, or if that information is encrypted, so it is entirely possible this information is passed over the Internet back to Blizzard. On balance, many gamers responsed positively about the development, stating that they supported the technology if it resulted in fewer cases of cheating. Blizzard's use of Warden was stated in the Terms of Agreement (TOA).<ref>{{cite web |title=WORLD OF WARCRAFT TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT |date=2007-01-11 |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html }}</ref>

The Warden's existence was acknowledged in March 2008, during the opening legal proceedings against MDY Industries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Opening legal proceedings of MDY INDUSTRIES, LLC. vs. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT, INC. |publisher=WoWGilder.com |url=http://www.wowglider.com/Legal/Feb_16_2007/AnswerAndCounterclaims.pdf WoWGilder.com }}</ref> The lawsuit was filed in federal court in [[Arizona]], and also listed Michael Donnelly as a defendant. Donnelly was included in the suit as the creator of [[Glider (bot)|MMO Glider]], software that can automatically play many tasks in the game. Blizzard claimed the software is an infringement of its [[copyright]] and [[software license agreement]], stating that "Glider use severely harms the WoW gaming experience for other players by altering the balance of play, disrupting the social and immersive aspects of the game, and undermining the in-game economy".

As with many [[MMORPG]]s, companies emerged offering to sell virtual gold and other associated services to players. After Blizzard started offering free trial gameplay accounts, players started receiving increasing numbers of spam sent by bots in the virtual mailboxes of their characters, advertising these services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/2006/11/26/world-of-warcraft-gold-farmers/ |title=Inside World of Warcraft Gold Farm, Future of Work |accessdate=2008-03-03 |author=Wagner James Au |date=2006-11-26 |publisher=gigaom.com }}</ref> One study shows that this problem is particularly prevalent on the European realms, with gold being over 14 times more expensive to buy on US realms than their European counterparts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerprice.com/wow-gold-study.html |title=WoW Gold Price research: A World of Warcraft economic study |accessdate=2008-03-03 |coauthor=University of Sheffield |publisher=gamerprice.com}}</ref> In patch 2.1, Blizzard responded to this by adding additional anti-spam mechanics including whisper throttling and the report spam function. Additionally, trial accounts are prevented from speaking in the public chat channels (although they may speak to players within range or whisper to other players that have first whispered them), participating in-game trades, using the Auction House and the mail feature and several other limitations. In May 2007 Blizzard filed a complaint against In Game Dollar LLC (trading as peons4hire) in federal court. In February 2008, the parties filed a consent decree in which In Game Dollar agreed to refrain from using any ''World of Warcraft'' chat or communication to advertise any business or sell any services relating to ''World of Warcraft''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://virtuallyblind.com/files/Peons_Injunction.pdf |title=BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT, INC. and VIVENDI GAMES, INC., vs. IN GAME DOLLAR, LLC and BENJAMIN LEE |accessdate=2008-03-03 |format=PDF }}</ref>

The practice of buying or selling gold in ''World of Warcraft'' is seen as highly controversial.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6592335.stm |title=The business end of playing games |accessdate=2008-03-03 |author=Richard Scott |date=2007-09-24 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> On February 21, 2008, Blizzard released an article describing the effects and consequences of buying gold. In it, it describes that an "alarmingly high" proportion of all gold bought originates from hacked accounts (see Account security, earlier). The article also states that customers who have paid for character levelling services find their accounts hacked into months later, with all items stripped and sold off for virtual gold. The article concludes by mentioning that these companies often use "disruptive hacks ... which can cause realm performance and stability issues".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/faq/antigoldselling.html |title=Gold Selling: Effects and Consequences |accessdate=2008-03-03 |date=2008-02-21 }}</ref> As characters progress in ''World of Warcraft'' and take on some of the toughest challenges, many of the rewards received are bound to that character and cannot be traded,  generating a market for the trading of accounts with well-equipped characters. The highest noted ''World of Warcraft'' account trade was for £5000 (7000 euros, $9,937.49USD) in early September 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7007026.stm |title=The high cost of playing Warcraft |accessdate=2008-03-03  |author=Crisitina Jimenez |date=2007-09-24 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

===Community===
In addition to playing the game itself and conversing on discussion forums provided by Blizzard, ''World of Warcraft'' players often participate in the [[virtual community]] in creative ways, including fan artwork<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blizzard.com/us/inblizz/fanart/ |title=Blizzard fan artwork web page |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |accessdate=2008-07-27 }}</ref> and comic strip style storytelling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/community/comics.html |title=World of Warcraft comic strip site |publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]] |accessdate=2008-07-27 }}</ref> Another popular phenomenon in the community are [[machinima]] videos such as the one<ref>{{cite video|people=Jenkins, Leeroy (Starring)|publisher=Pals 4 Life|medium=Promotional video|title=Leeroy Jenkins|year=2005|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7714643693602998196}}</ref> starring a player named [[Leeroy Jenkins]], showing him and his guild in a staged comedic encounter. Leeroy's popularity inspired more videos and tributes in other games, and he was even part of a clue on the November 16, 2005 episode of the TV [[game show]] ''[[Jeopardy!|College Jeopardy!]]''.<ref>{{cite video|year=2005|title=Jeopardy!|people=Trebek, Alex (Host)|medium=Television series||url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2448368923986986124|publisher=[[NBC]]|location=California, US}}</ref>

Blizzard garnered criticism for its decision in January 2006 to ban guilds from advertising sexual orientation preferences. The incident occurred after several players were cited for "harassment" after advocating a group for gay-straight alliance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blizzard of GLBT gaming policy questions |publisher=In Newsweekly |date=2006-02-02 |accessdate=2006-10-21 |url=http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ga&article_code=1172

Included in this decision was the announcement that it intends to set up in-game channels intended specifically for guild advertisements, as well as provide [[sensitivity training]] for its staff after players complained of anti-homosexual language being used openly and without punishment.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=62864 | title = Blizzard says sorry to WOW fan | accessdate = 2006-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/breaking/wow-blizzard-gets-gay-rights-warning-153075.php | title = Blizzard Gets Gay Rights Warning | accessdate = 2006-04-11}}</ref>

===Game addiction===
{{main|Video game addiction|Internet addiction disorder|Computer addiction}}
''World of Warcraft'' has also come under criticism due to concerns about [[video game addiction]]. In June 2005, it was reported that a four-month-old South Korean child had [[suffocation|suffocated]] due to [[neglect]] by her ''World of Warcraft''-addicted parents, who were reportedly at a nearby café, playing ''World of Warcraft''.<ref>[http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=59697 Child dies as parents play WoW News // PC /// Eurogamer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In August of that year, the government of the People's Republic of China introduced an online gaming restriction limiting playing time to 3 hours, after which the player would be expelled from the game. In 2006, it changed the rule so only citizens under the age of 18 would face the limitations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4183340.stm|title=China imposes online gaming curbs|publisher=BBC|date=August 25, 2005}}</ref>

Dr. [[Maressa Orzack]], a clinical psychologist at [[McLean Hospital]] in Belmont, [[Massachusetts]], was interviewed August 8, 2006 stating that many of the then 9 million subscribers are addicted. She is quoted as saying "''... 40 percent of the players are addicted.''"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.twitchguru.com/2006/08/08/world_of_warcraft_players_addicted/|title=Expert: 40 Percent of World of Warcraft Players Addicted|publisher=TwitchGuru|date=August 8, 2006}}</ref> Note that the 40 percent figure was not derived from a scientific study overseen by Dr. Orzack, but rather came from "a forum that [[Nick Yee]] runs". She added in an August 2006 interview that "even if the percentage is 5 to 10 percent which is standard for most addictive behaviors, it is a huge number of people who are out of control."<ref>[http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060809-7459.html Ars Technica interview with Dr. Orzack, 8/9/2006]</ref> Also, according to Dr. John Grohol, a colleague of Orzack's, "Dr. Orzack is not claiming that up to 40% of World of Warcraft gamers are addicted based upon any actual evidence or surveys of players. This is just her opinion, based upon her own experience and observation of the problem."<ref>[http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2006/08/10/expert-40-percent-of-world-of-warcraft-players-addicted/ PsychCentral - John M. Grohol, Psy.D., August 10, 2006]</ref>

=== In other media ===

''WoW'' has inspired artists to satirize and/or acknowledge its mark in popular culture. One example is the Emmy Award winning ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]."<ref name="South Park PR">{{cite press release | url = http://www.blizzard.com/press/061002.shtml | title = SOUTH PARK CELEBRATES 10 GROUNDBREAKING SEASONS!!! | date = 2006-10-02 | accessdate = 2007-07-23 | publisher = Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.}}</ref>. ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Marge Gamer]]" also satirized MMORPG games like World of Warcraft. 

The game has also been used to advertise unrelated products, such as [[Toyota]] trucks.<ref name="Crave">{{cite web|url=http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9792837-1.html|title=What level/class do I need to get a Tacoma in 'WoW'?|publisher=[[Cnet]]|date=[[2007-11-08]]|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> 

In late 2007, a series of television commercials for the game began airing featuring pop culture celebrities such as [[Mr. T]], [[William Shatner]], and [[Verne Troyer]] discussing the virtues of the character classes they play in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/movies.html#h3jl1 |title=World of Warcraft Commercials |publisher=Blizzard Entertainment |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref> A [[Spanish language|Spanish]] commercial featuring [[Guillermo Toledo|Willy Toledo]] followed, and a [[French language|French]] commercial featuring [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wow-europe.com/en/downloads/commercials.html |title=World of Warcraft Europe - TV Commercials |publisher=Blizzard Entertainment |date=2007-11-30 |accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref>

''World of Warcraft'' has inspired two board games, ''[[World of Warcraft: The Board Game]]'' (including ''Shadow of War'' and ''The Burning Crusade'' expansions) <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/worldofwarcraft_products.html |title=World of Warcraft: The Board Game |publisher=[[Fantasy Flight Games]]}}</ref> and ''[[World of Warcraft: The Adventure Game]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/wow-adventure/ |title=World of Warcraft: The Adventure Game |publisher=[[Fantasy Flight Games]]}}</ref>, produced by [[Fantasy Flight Games]]. There is also a [[World of Warcraft Trading Card Game|trading card game]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/wow/en/ |title=World of Warcraft TCG |publisher=[[Upper Deck Entertainment]]}}</ref> on the market and a collectible miniatures game scheduled to be released November 18, 2008,<ref>{{cite article |title=WoW Minis - Justin Gary Interview Podcast |url=http://www.tcgplayer.com/db/game_review.asp?AID=2557&PID=303&DBID=4 |date=2008-08-18 |}}</ref> both produced by [[Upper Deck Entertainment]].
