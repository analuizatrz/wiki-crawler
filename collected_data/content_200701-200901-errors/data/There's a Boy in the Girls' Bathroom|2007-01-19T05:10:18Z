He is proud whenever he receives '[[F]]' in class tests. He wants everyone to hate him, because then they will leave him alone.

But then a new classmate comes in from [[Washington DC]], and the only remaining seat is beside Bradley. The classmate tries to reason with Bradley, but fails like everyone else and drifts away with other friends. Then a [[School Counselor|counselor]] is appointed called Carla, and she cannot wait to meet Bradley.
