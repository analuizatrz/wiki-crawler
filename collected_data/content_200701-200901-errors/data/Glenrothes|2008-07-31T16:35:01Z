'''Glenrothes''' ({{lang-gd|'''Gleann Rathais'''}}) is a town situated in the centre of [[Fife]], in east central [[Scotland]]. It is approximately equidistant between [[Edinburgh]] and [[Dundee]] and is the third largest town in Fife, by population. The population of Glenrothes based on recent projections is 38,927 people. <ref>''Population Estimates for Towns and Villages in Fife'' [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_Population06Leaflet.pdf] ''Fife Council'' 2008-06-02.

Glenrothes was the second [[New town#United Kingdom|new town]] to be designated in Scotland under the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1946. It was established in 1948 and was created to attract new employment and population to mid-Fife with the creation of the Rothes Colliery, a major [[coal mine]]. The pit closed in 1961, only 4&nbsp;years into production because of unstemmable flooding problems and a decline in coal requirements nationwide. However other industries were attracted to the town and it became an economic growth point for central Scotland establishing itself as an important [[Silicon Glen]] centre.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes">{{cite book

The town has been developed as a series of residential precincts with their own schools, shops and community facilities. Industry is separated from housing areas in planned industrial estates, largely concentrated in the south of the town. Glenrothes is unique in Fife as its town centre is bounded by a ring road, has been [[town planning|purposely planned]], contains no residential element and is largely enclosed.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" />

Glenrothes is the administrative centre for Fife containing the local authority and the regional police headquarters. It is also a major employment centre in Fife and has been successful in attracting a high number of modern industrial companies to the region.<ref>''Glenrothes Economic Profile'' [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_GlenrothesRevisedApr07.pdf] ''Fife Council'' 2007-04-14.

==History==
===Background===
[[Image:Woodside pre Glenrothes.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Housing at Woodside, built pre-Glenrothes]]
Glenrothes was designated in 1948 under the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1946 as Scotland's second [[post-war]] new town.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /> A decision on the name of "Glenrothes" was made by the County Council's planning committee in 1947. The name of "rothes" being derived from title of the chief laird of the area - the Earl of Rothes although the inclusion of "glen" bears no relation to the topography. <ref name="The Fife Book">{{cite book

The original town plan was to build a new settlement for a population of 32,000-35,000 people. The intention of the new town for the developers was: "to establish a self-contained and balanced community for working and living". <ref name="Kingdom of Fife">{{cite book

The land where Glenrothes now sits was largely agricultural and once contained a number of small rural communities. Originally the new town was going to be centred on [[Markinch]], however the village's infrastructure was deemed unable to withstand the substantial growth required to realise a new town. [[Leslie]] and [[Thornton]] were also considered but as a consequence an area of 5,370 acres (2,229 hectares) that sits between all of these villages was chosen. The land taken was previously an area of great natural beauty. The policies of Balbirnie House, Leslie House, Balgeddie House falling under the land ownerships of the Balfour, Rothes, Aytoun and Balgonie estates were all incorporated in the Glenrothes designated area.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" />

The land was sub-divided into areas or "precincts" which were named after the [[Hamlet (place)| hamlets]] already established (e.g. Woodside, Cadham), the [[farms]] which once occupied the land (e.g. Rimbleton, Caskieberran, Collydean) or historical [[stately homes]] in the area (e.g. Balgeddie, [[Glenrothes#Pictures|Balbirnie]], Leslie Parks).<ref name="Old Glenrothes">{{cite book

The name Rothes comes from the association with the north-east Scotland [[Earl of Rothes]], family name Leslie. The Leslie family owned much of the land historically. [[Glen]] (Scottish for valley) was added to prevent confusion with [[Rothes]] in [[Moray]], and because the town lies on the [[Leven, Fife|Leven]] valley.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /><ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997">{{cite book

The primary reason for the designation of Glenrothes was to house miners who where to work at a new super coal mine. This was to be the most modern of the day and was built west of Thornton, an established village south of Glenrothes. The Super Pit was named the Rothes Colliery and it was officially opened by the Queen in 1957. About 5,000 miners were to be required to produce 5,000&nbsp;tonnes of coal per day, and huge railway yards were established. The pit was to have a working life of 100&nbsp;years. The planned long-term benefits were to be huge, and the driver for economic regeneration for central Fife. At its peak the Rothes Colliery employed over 1,500 miners. In 1961, 4&nbsp;years after opening, the huge investment was written off and the mine closed as a result of un-stemmable flooding and geological problems. Ironically, miners who'd worked in older deep pits in the area had fore-warned against the development of the Rothes Pit for this very reason. The closure of the state-of-the art facility left the huge enclosed concrete wheel-towers standing at Thornton for many years as a forlorn symbol of what could have been.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /><ref> ''History of Glenrothes'' [http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/glenrothes-gazette-news/History-of-Glenrothes.3678393.jp]''The Glenrothes Gazette'', 2008-01-20. Retrieved on [[January 24]], [[2008]]</ref>

Originally the main industry in the Glenrothes area was paper-making (Tullis-Russell and the other mills along the Leven Valley) and [[coal mining]]. Unlike [[East Kilbride]], [[Cumbernauld]] or [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]] Glenrothes was not originally to be a Glasgow overspill new town, although it did later take this role. It was however populated in the early 1950s in large part by mining families moving from the West of [[Scotland]], particularly the [[Glasgow]] area, though many re-settled from the declining [[Lothian]] coalfields too.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /> 

[[Image:Glenrothes Offices.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Fife Council Chambers and HQ buildings, Glenrothes Town Centre]]
The pit's closure was devastating and further development of Glenrothes was almost stopped. The pit's closure did help change the fortunes of the town for the better. Central Government changed the town's role and appointed Glenrothes as one of the economic focal points for Central Scotland. The Glenrothes Development Corporation were successful in attracting a plethora of modern electronics factories to the town. The first big overseas electronic investor was Beckmans Industries in 1959 followed by Hughes Industries in early 1960s. A number of other important companies followed establishing Glenrothes as a major hub in Scotland's [[Silicon Glen]].<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /><ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />

A further boost to the town during the 1970s saw it become the centre of Fife Council's operations.  This took the role from [[Cupar]] which was formally the County Town of Fife. Fife House (the headquarters of Fife Council) and other Fife Council buildings are situated in Glenrothes' town centre. [[Fife Constabulary]] and [[Scottish Enterprise]] Fife also have their headquarters in the town. Today Glenrothes is the administrative centre for Fife.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /><ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />

===Glenrothes Development Corporation===

The planning, development, management and promotion of Glenrothes was the responsibility of the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC), a [[quango]] appointed by the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. Fife Council were responsible for implementing the [[infrastructure]] in the town such as schools, parks and roads.<ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />

The GDC was wound up in 1995, and was asked to undertake any last major works required in the town with the aid of a grant. The Leven Bridge crossing Riverside Park and the Kingdom Centre Phase 4, including the Rothes Halls were some of the last major projects undertaken. Property and assets of the town were either sold off to private companies or passed onto the responsibility of Fife Council. The winding up of the GDC meant that Glenrothes was no longer designated a new town. Development and management of the town would now be undertaken by Fife Council. The development corporation left its lasting legacy on the town by overseeing the development of 15,378 houses, 480,692 square metres of industrial floorspace, 68,328 square metres of office floorspace and 53,603 square metres of shopping floorspace by [[31 December]] [[1995]].<ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" />

Glenrothes serves a wider area as both a service, employment and retail centre. There are a number of attractive villages surrounding the town each unique in their own respect. The surrounding villages are [[Markinch]], [[Leslie, Fife|Leslie]], [[Thornton, Fife|Thornton]], [[Coaltown of Balgonie]], [[Star of Markinch]], [[Milton of Balgonie]] (with [[Balgonie Castle]]) and [[Kinglassie]].

==Geography==

Glenrothes lies in mid-Fife between the agricultural ''Howe of Fife'' in the north and east and Fife's industrial heartland in the south and west. It is located approximately equidistant between the cities of [[Edinburgh]] ({{convert|32|mi|km|0}}) and [[Dundee]] ({{convert|27|mi|km|0}}). Its OS Grid reference is NO281015.

The northern parts of the town lie upland on the southern fringes of the [[Lomond Hills|Lomond Hills Regional Park]]. The central parts of the town lie on land between the southern lip of the River Leven Valley, a green lung which passes east west through the town, and the Warout Ridge. Southern parts of Glenrothes are largely industrial and lie on land which gently slopes south towards the Lochty Burn and the village of Thornton.<ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />

Temperatures in Glenrothes, like the rest of Scotland, are relatively moderate given its northern latitude. Fife is a peninsula, located between the [[Firth of Tay]] in the north, the [[Firth of Forth]] in the south and the [[North Sea]] in the east. Summers are relatively cool and the warming of the water over the summer results in warm winters. Average annual temperatures in Glenrothes range from a max of 18°C to a min of 9°C.<ref> [http://uk.weather.com/weather/climatology/UKXX0775?from=smartlinks] (HTML) </ref>

===Built environment===
[[Image:South Parks Glenrothes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Semi-detached GDC housing and mature landscaping, South Parks]]
Glenrothes' layout was based on an irregular grid. The first town masterplan set out self-contained residential precincts with their own primary schools, local shops and community facilities. Separating industry as far as possible from housing areas in planned industrial estates was a key element of the plan. This was a step change from the unplanned and polluted industrial towns and cities of the previous centuries where cramped housing and dirty industry were built in close proximity to one another. The idea for Glenrothes was to provide a clean and healthy environment for the town's residents regardless of their social background. "Through traffic" would bypass housing precincts by distributor roads which would connect each precinct to a purposely designed town centre and to the industrial estates. Another element that was adopted was the use of roundabouts at junctions instead of traffic lights allowing traffic to flow freely.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" />

At first Glenrothes developed in a linear fashion starting at Woodside in the east and progressing westwards. Housing was a mixture of low-rise mixed housing and flats. The first masterplan was implemented as far as South Parks and Rimbleton housing precincts.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" /> <ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />

Early Glenrothes precincts, developed under the first masterplan, were based on [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s [[Garden city movement|Garden City]] principles and this is reflected in their housing styles and layouts.<ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />
[[Image:Collydean.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Compact housing and segregated pedestrian path, Collydean]]
A second town masterplan was designed in the 1960s following Glenrothes' change of role and was to accommodate an increased population target of 50,000-70,000. New areas of land in the north and south of the designated area were brought into production for new development. The irregular grid layout was retained however housing precincts were to become less self-contained and would share local facilities in a new neighbourhood centre format. The road network was to be upgraded to deal with projected increases in car ownership. New housing estates were developed in the west, south and then northern parts of the town. The precincts of the 1960s and 70's, developed under the second masterplan, were based on principles of [[Radburn]], separating as far as possible footpaths from roads. The townscape changed with a mixture of higher densities and new architectural styles.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" />

Housing precincts from the 1980s onwards have largely been developed by the [[private sector]] and more reflect today's aspirations of low density [[suburban]] living.<ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" /> Most of this housing was developed in the northern parts of the town.<ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />
[[Image:The Secret Garden.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Low rise private suburban housing, Balgeddie]]
Large portions of land in the south of the town were developed for industrial purposes, largely as a result of the proximity to the proposed East Fife Regional Road (A92) which was developed in 1989 giving dual carriageway access to the main central Scotland road network. The second master plan was used until the wind-up of the Development Corporation in 1995.<ref name="A History of Glenrothes" /><ref name="A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" />

Glenrothes came late into high rise development and as a result it has only a single tower block, which is located adjacent to other tall buildings in the town centre. The townscape is largely low rise until the town centre is reached where flats and clusters of taller buildings have been used.<ref name="An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" />

==Demographics==

Scotland's [[United Kingdom Census 2001|Census 2001]] showed that Glenrothes has a population of 38,679. The demographic make-up of the population is much in line with the rest of Scotland, with 30-44&nbsp;year olds forming the largest portion of the population (23%). Despite the aging population in Scotland, Glenrothes has 2% fewer pensioners than the Scottish average.<ref> [http://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Population&mainArea=Glenrothes&mainLevel=Locality] (HTML)</ref>
