The '''Fun Lovin' Criminals''' are an [[alternative rap]] / [[alternative rock]] group from [[New York City]], [[United States]]. Their music is a blend of many styles, most notably [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Rock and roll|rock]], [[blues]], and [[jazz]], and their songs often deal with everyday life in [[New York City]] and most big cities: [[organized crime]], [[recreational drug use|drugs]], [[violence]], [[poverty]], and [[politics]]. Their songs are sometimes gritty and [[existentialist]]. They are best known for their hit "Scooby Snacks", which featured samples from films by [[Quentin Tarantino]].

In their native US, they have somewhat of a cult following. However, the band gained a considerably large following internationally, notably in northwest [[Europe]], especially around the release of their first two albums in the late nineties.

==Line-up==
The band was formed in [[1993]] by [[Hugh Morgan (musician)|Hugh Morgan]] ("Huey", vocals, guitar), [[Brian Leiser]] ("Fast", keyboards, bass, trumpet, harmonica) and [[Steve Borovini]] ("O", drums).

In [[1999]], Borovini left the band (after he, in the words of Huey: "went a little crazy and departed to [[Peru]]") - finding later success with [http://www.needledropnyc.com/ Needledrop] and [http://www.difontaine.net/ccjones/ CC JONES]. He was replaced by [[Maxwell Jayson]] ("Mackie"). Mackie was then later replaced in [[2003]] by Mark ([[aka (initialism)|aka]] "Frank" or "The Rhythm Master") from [[Leicester]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], who had previously worked with the band as Mackie's technician.

==Albums and other projects==
''Come Find Yourself'', the band's first album, was released in [[1995]], and contained the hit "Scooby Snacks", which contained samples of movies by [[Quentin Tarantino]].

''100% Colombian'', released in [[1998]], contained slightly less rock influences. Singles included "Love Unlimited" (a tribute to [[Barry White]]) and "Big Night Out".

The [[1999]] album ''Mimosa'' mostly contained covers and different versions of earlier released tracks, but the [[2001]] ''Loco'' contained all new songs, including the hit single "Loco", and a more relaxed sound.

Their next album, ''Welcome to Poppy's'' was released in 2003 and had a more upbeat, more rock-influenced sound. They are currently working on a sequel to ''Maui Homicide 2000'', a short film intended for the 2000 Maui Film Festival but banned for its gritty and shocking content.

The album ''[[Livin' In The City]]'' was released in [[2005]] and contained the single "Mi Corazon".

Huey wrote a regular wine column for the British magazine ''[[Mondo]]'' from [[1999]] to [[2000]].

Huey appeared as guest presenter on UK comedy music panel show [[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]] on 17th April 2006.

The group went on tour in October 2006 playing a few DJ Sets across the UK and Europe

Both Huey & drummer Frank apear in Brit Flick [http://imdb.com/title/tt0822795/ Clubbing to Death] due for release in 2007.
