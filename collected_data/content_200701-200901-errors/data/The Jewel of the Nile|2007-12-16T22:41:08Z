'''''The Jewel of the Nile''''' is a [[sequel]] to the [[1984 in film|1984]] romantic adventure ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' featuring [[Michael Douglas]], [[Kathleen Turner]], and [[Danny DeVito]], the stars of the first film.  Released in [[1985 in film|1985]], it sends their characters off on a new adventure in a fictional [[Middle East]]ern desert, in an effort to find the precious "Jewel of the Nile." 

==Plot summary==
===Opening Sequence===
Like the first film, the opening scene takes place in one of Joan's novels.  But this time, instead of Joan's wild-west supercouple, Jesse and Angelina, Joan and Jack are the featured heroes. As the movie starts Jack and Joan are on an old sailing ship. They're getting married. Suddenly, pirates attack the ship. Jack leads a brief counterattack against the pirates, but eventually the pirates take the ship and the survivors must get to the lifeboats. By the time, Jack and Joan reach the lifeboats, there's only room enough for one more. Joan gives the seat to Jack and he leaves without her. Now she's alone and surrounded by pirates. It seems she's doomed. And then...

We return to reality, where Joan is sitting on the deck of the Angelina, struggling to finish her novel. Frustrated, she gives up and tosses her typewriter overboard.

===Rest of film===
Joan Wilder ([[Kathleen Turner]]) is having trouble writing her next romantic novel while living with Jack Colton ([[Michael Douglas]]) on his boat, the Angelina, and refuses to discuss marriage. At a book signing engagement she meets a charming Arab ruler named Omar ([[Spiros Focas]]) that has managed to persuade the world that he is a firm, but fair, ruler of a fictional Middle Eastern nation. Omar offers Joan the opportunity to live like a queen at his palace, while she writes a fluff piece about him. However, as soon as Joan leaves with Omar, Jack runs into Ralph ([[Danny DeVito]]).  Ralph, recently out of prison, plans on killing Jack, but is stopped by an Arab named Tarak ([[Paul David Magid]]), who tells Jack of Omar's true intentions.  This includes the fact that he has their greatest treasure, the Jewel of the Nile, in his possession. Ralph, immediately interested at the prospect, agrees to help find the Jewel. Jack, however, is less than convinced. But seconds later, the Angelina explodes, having been sabotaged under Omar's orders. He then agrees to team up with Ralph and Tarak in order to track down the lost jewel in Omar's kingdom.

In the fabled kingdom, Joan discovers that Omar is a brutal dictator, that imprisons her until she agrees to finish the fluff piece that will introduce him to the world as an enlightened ruler that will unite the [[Arab]] world. In the palace jail she meets a holy man, Al-Julhara, ([[Avner Eisenberg]]), who is in fact the Jewel of the Nile. The pair escape the palace, and with the help of Jack are able to flee Omar's army into the desert. Ralph, who provides much of the film's comic relief, is left to fend for himself in the desert and thus joins with the rebel tribe led by Tarak that has sworn to protect the Jewel so he can fulfill his destiny.

After a battle with a mountain [[Africa]]n tribe, Joan breaks the news to Jack, that the Jewel is in fact Al-Julhara who is the spiritual leader of the Arab people. Omar plans on using a [[United Kingdom|British]] rock & roll technician's smoke and mirrors special effects at an upcoming festival, planned by Omar, to convince the Arab world that he is in fact a prophet that will unite the Arab world under his rule. Jack, Joan and the Holy Man decide to crash the festival and unmask Omar as the fraud that he is. Once Omar is killed, the Holy Man rises as the real spiritual leader and the film ends with Jack and Joan finally getting married. Ralph is acknowledged as an official member of Tarak's tribe, signified by being presented with a priceless jeweled dagger.

While ''The Jewel of the Nile'' grossed nearly as much as its predecessor,<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jewelofthenile.htm Box Office Mojo: ''The Jewel of the Nile'']</ref> the film was much less successful critically and helped to effectively kill the franchise, although it was said at the time that both [[Kathleen Turner]] and [[Michael Douglas]] only made the sequel because they were contractually obligated to do so.<ref name= "ebert">{{cite web | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19851211/REVIEWS/512110301/1023 |date = 1985-12-11 | title = The Jewel of the Nile | publisher = by Roger Ebert, ''The Chicago Sun-Times''. | accessdate = 2007-02-09}}</ref>  (At one point during pre-production, Turner tried to back out of the project, and [[Twentieth Century Fox]] threatened her with a $25 million lawsuit.)<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,314990_4,00.html |date = 1991-08-02 | title = The Last Movie Star | publisher = ''Entertainment Weekly''. | accessdate = 2007-02-09}}</ref> Turner, Douglas, and DeVito would later reunite in the (unrelated) film ''[[The War of the Roses]]''.

Critics felt the film was loaded with numerous plot holes and that it lacked the first film's original charm.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' opened its review by writing, "There's nothing in ''The Jewel of the Nile'' that wasn't funnier or more fanciful in ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9B06E7D9173BF932A25751C1A963948260 |date = 1985-12-11 | title = Film: 'Jewel of the Nile' | publisher = by Janet Maslin, ''The New York Times''. | accessdate = 2007-02-09}}</ref>  [[Roger Ebert]] agreed that "it is not quite the equal of ''Romancing the Stone,''" but praised the interplay between Douglas and Turner.  "It seems clear," he wrote, "that they like each other and are having fun during the parade of ludicrous situations in the movie, and their chemistry is sometimes more entertaining than the contrivances of the plot."<ref name= "ebert">{{cite web | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19851211/REVIEWS/512110301/1023 |date = 1985-12-11 | title = The Jewel of the Nile | publisher = by Roger Ebert, ''The Chicago Sun-Times''. | accessdate = 2007-02-09}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* As with the first film, the [[novelization]] of the sequel was credited to Joan Wilder.
* Omar's archetypal character was loosely based on [[Saddam Hussein]], the image especially in the desert of the bereted leader with moustache and [[Aviator sunglasses]], echoing many of the images of Hussein in American media. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
* ''The Jewel of the Nile'' was the final film released on the [[SelectaVision]] video format.
* Even though the movie was rated PG, on Fox Movie Channel it was rated TV-MA LSV.
