'''New York State Route 23''' runs from [[Central New York]] through the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line in the [[Berkshire Mountains|Berkshires]]. It crosses the [[Hudson River]] via the [[Rip Van Winkle Bridge]].

Along the way it passes through some very scenic areas of the state.

From the 1960s through the 1980s, map makers used an example of a [[reference marker (New York)|reference marker]] from NY 23 to explain how they work.

==Route description==
Route 23 has three distinct sections: its western third in Central New York and the Leatherstocking region, the middle in the Catskills, and east of the Hudson.

The highway begins at a junction with [[New York State Route 26|NY 26]] in eastern [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland County]], at [[Cincinnatus, New York|Lower Cincinnatus]]. It crosses into [[Chenango County, New York|Chenango County]] very soon afterwards, and  then trends northwards to the [[Pharsalia State Wildlife Management Area]], after which it starts heading southwards again to the [[county seat]], [[Norwich (city), New York|Norwich]], where it intersects with [[New York State Route 12|NY 12]]. Another major north-south route, [[New York State Route 8|NY 8]], awaits at [[New Berlin (town), New York|South New Berlin]]. It is followed by the [[Unadilla River]], which puts 23 into [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]].

Several miles into the new county, 23 encounters [[Morris (village), New York|Morris]], its first town, where it briefly joins [[New York State Route 51|NY 51]] along the main street. Beyond Morris, the route continues easterly with a generally southern trend through rolling farmland, until turning south again at [[Laurens, New York|West Laurens]]. A brief easterly turn again at West Oneonta merges it with [[New York State Route 205|NY 205]].

The two highways enter the western end of the city of [[Oneonta (city), New York|Oneonta]], where they are met by [[New York State Route 7|NY 7]] coming in from the southwest. 205 continues south with that portion of 7 while 23 and 7 go east to serve as the city's main street. The two roads diverge again at the city's east end, near the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]]. 23 has an interchange with [[Interstate 88 (east)|Interstate 88]], here also carrying [[New York State Route 28|NY 28]], and then leaves the Oneonta area by going past several large [[strip mall]]s and big-box retailers to the [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]] line.

===Catskills===
23 follows the [[Charlotte Creek]] valley, at first, as the land gets noticeably woodsier and the houses fewer in this, the least densely populated county in New York outside of the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondacks]]. After [[Davenport, New York|Davenport]], the road begins to climb onto the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill Plateau]]. By the time it intersects [[New York State Route 10|NY 10]] at [[Stamford (village), New York|Stamford]], and crosses a small brook that is all that exists of the [[West Branch Delaware River|West Branch]] of the [[Delaware River]] this close to its [[Source (river or stream)|source]], it has already reached 1,820 feet (555 m) above sea level.

It maintains this elevation during a brief detour into [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie County]], where the scenic mountains to the south rise to heights over 3,000 feet (914 m) â€” still leaving them among the lesser Catskill peaks. Elevation drops slightly at the next stop, [[Roxbury, New York|Grand Gorge]], just above the small pond along junctioning [[New York State Route 30|NY 30]] that gives rise to the Delaware's [[East Branch Delaware River|East Branch]].

A few miles outside of Grand Gorge, at a bend south of [[Schoharie Reservoir]], 23 enters [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]]. A bridge over the [[Schoharie Creek]] heralds the next town, [[Prattsville, New York|Prattsville]]. Zedoch Pratt, the [[tanning|tanner]] and [[politician]] who lent his name to the town, left a series of rock carvings depicting his life at [[Pratt Rocks]] just outside of town.

Shortly after the village, [[New York State Route 23A|NY 23A]] continues along the Schoharie while 23 climbs again along [[Batavia Kill]]. Shortly past the scenic [[Red Falls]] along the kill, all crossings of the creek come to mark the [[Blue Line (New York State)|Blue Line]] that delineates the [[Catskill Park]]. 23 remains to the north of the creek even as it passes the [[Windham Mountain]] ski area and [[New York State Route 296|NY 296]] comes in from the south. However, it crosses it several times and is within the park as it reaches its highest point, 1,940 feet (591 m) at the [[mountain pass|pass]] next to [[Windham High Peak]] where the [[Long Path]] crosses the road (and ended for a very long time). This location, very near the northernmost point in the Catskill Park, has long been considered its northern gateway.

Here 23 begins a long descent down the [[Catskill Escarpment]], losing much of the elevation it has gained since Oneonta and providing sweeping, panoramic views of the [[Capital District]] and points north, east and west. [[Five State Lookout]] is a popular place to stop and gape. On good days the Adirondack foothills and [[Green Mountains]] in [[Vermont]] are visible.

Having reached the floor of the [[Hudson Valley]], 23 assumes a southeast-trending route through [[Cairo (town), New York|Cairo]], where it picks up [[New York State Route 145|NY 145]] and briefly overlaps [[New York State Route 32|NY 32]], the major north-south state route on the west side of the river. It has an indirect intersection with the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87]]), and then [[U.S. Route 9W|US 9W]] and [[New York State Route 385|NY 385]] as it passes north of [[Catskill (village), New York|Catskill]], the county seat, to cross the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] at the [[Rip Van Winkle Bridge]].

===East of the Hudson=== 
Once across the bridge and into [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]], 23 encounters [[New York State Route 9G|NY 9G]] near [[Olana State Historic Site]]. The two highways are briefly joined until 9G continues north with [[New York State Route 23B|NY 23B]] to follow 23's old course through [[Hudson (village), New York|Hudson]].

23 perseveres to the southeast, meeting [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] after a few miles. The two highways overlap into the complex intersection at Bell Pond, where 9 continues south, [[New York State Route 82|NY 82]] continues along 23's course, while 23 and new route [[New York State Route 9H|NY 9H]] pick up 9's in a northerly direction that takes them to [[Claverack, New York|Claverack]]. Here 23B finishes its loop from the west, 9H continues north and 23 resumes an east-west alignment. Shortly after this junction, [[New York State Route 217|NY 217]] splits off to the north.

The road continues across countryside more open and less rugged, but still very picturesque, than the Catskills. At Martindale it intersects the [[Taconic State Parkway]], then following a creek valley down into [[Hillsdale, New York|Hillsdale]], where the [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]] junction heralds the proximity of the state's eastern border. Almost three miles (5 km) to the east, at the bi-state [[Catamount Ski Area]], NY 23 becomes [[Route 23 (Massachusetts)|MA 23]].

==History==
NY 23 was assigned to most of its current alignment from [[Oneonta (city), New York|Oneonta]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line southwest of [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]] in 1924.<ref name=nyt0>{{cite news|title=New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1924-12-21]]|page=XX9}}</ref> From Oneonta to [[Cairo (CDP), New York|Cairo]], as well as from [[Claverack, New York|Claverack]] to the Massachusetts state line, NY 23 was routed along its modern alignment. East of Cairo, NY 23 followed what is now '''County Road 23B''' into [[Catskill, New York|Catskill]], then overlapped [[New York State Route 10 (1924)|NY 10]] northward along modern [[New York State Route 385|NY 385]] to [[Athens, New York|Athens]]. After crossing the [[Hudson River]] via a [[ferry]], NY 23 continued east through [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]] on what is now [[New York State Route 23B|NY 23B]] to Claverack.<ref name=1926map>{{cite map|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/unitedstates1926ra_009.html|title=Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas|year=1926|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>

Between 1924 and 1926, NY 23 was extended westward to [[Norwich (city), New York|Norwich]] along its current routing.<ref name=1926map /> In the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]], NY 23 was unchanged east of Norwich; however, the route was extended west along a previously unnumbered roadway to [[New York State Route 26|NY 26]] in northwest [[Chenango County, New York|Chenango County]]. From Norwich to North Pharsalia, NY 23 followed its modern alignment; between North Pharsalia and NY 26, NY 23 was routed on modern '''County Road 42'''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Leon A. Dickinson|title=New Signs for State Highways|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1930-01-12]]|page=136}}</ref> Later, by 1946, NY 23 was rerouted onto the [[Rip Van Winkle Bridge]] and current NY 23B between Catskill and Hudson.<ref name=1946rmcn>{{cite map|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/randmcnally_ra_1946_005.html|title=Rand McNally Road Atlas|year=1946|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>
