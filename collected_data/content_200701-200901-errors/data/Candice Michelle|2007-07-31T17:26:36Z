Also during this time, Candice began a gimmick where she walked down to the ring carrying a [[wand]] and acting like a princess. She also got her first shot at the [[WWE Women's Championship]] in a Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal Match at [[WWE Taboo Tuesday#2005|Taboo Tuesday]], before being eliminated by [[Ashley Massaro]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/tabootuesday05.html|title=Taboo Tuesday 2005 Results|accessdate=2007-07-06|publisher=onlineworldofwrestling.com}}</ref>

[[Image:Candace Michelle Playboy.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Candice Michelle's ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine cover]]

Vince's Devils later broke up when Wilson turned [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] after Candice and Victoria turned on her during Candice's ''Playboy'' cover unveiling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/03062006/|title=RAW results - March 6, 2006|accessdate=2007-07-02|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> This feud led to a match at [[WrestleMania 22]] in which both ''Playboy'' cover girls would compete in a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Pillow fight|''Playboy'' Pillow Fight]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#22|title=WrestleMania 22 - April 2, 2006|accessdate=2007-07-02|publisher=prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> Wilson won the match, but the feud continued sporadically in backstage segments where Candice was [[Vince McMahon]]'s "[[Sexual slavery|sex slave]]".<ref name="ask">{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/toys/interview_200/231b_candice_michelle_interview.html|title=13 Questions With Candice Michelle |accessdate=2007-07-02|publisher=AskMen.com|quote=Well, when you’re the boss I guess you can make some people your sex slave.}}</ref>

On the [[July 17]] edition of ''RAW'', Candice was the Special Guest Referee during a tag team match of Stratus and Wilson against Victoria and Mickie James. Mickie James entered the match without being tagged in so Candice threw her out of the ring. Afterwards, Victoria tried to [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]] Candice but she ducked out of the way, allowing Stratus to hit the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Springboard bulldog|Stratusfaction]] for the victory. This incident resulted in Candice turning face.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060717.html|title=RAW results - July 17, 2006|accessdate=2007-07-02| publisher=onlineworldofwrestling.com}}</ref>
