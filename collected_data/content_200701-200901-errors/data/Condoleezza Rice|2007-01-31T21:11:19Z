<!--Please see naming conventions at WP:MOSBIO, do not add details like "Dr." and "Ph. D"-->'''Condoleezza Rice''' (born [[November 14]] [[1954]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]]) is the 66th [[United States Secretary of State]], and the second in the administration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] to hold the office. She succeeded [[Colin Powell]] on [[January 26]], [[2005]], after his resignation. Rice is the first [[African American]] woman, second African American (after Powell), and second woman (after [[Madeleine Albright]]) to serve as Secretary of State.

Condoleezza Rice was Bush's [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] during his first term (2001&ndash;2005). Before joining the Bush administration, she was a [[Professor]] of [[political science]] at [[Stanford University]] where she served as [[Provost (education)|Provost]] from 1993 to 1999.

During the administration of [[George H. W. Bush]], Rice also served as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Eastern Europe|East European]] Affairs Advisor during the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and [[German reunification]].

Rice's role as advisor to the President and chief diplomat for the United States during a period of intense criticism of America's [[War on Terror]] has made her a controversial figure, although she currently has the highest [[Approval rating|public approval]] and favorability ratings of any administration official.<ref>Kessler, Glenn [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/22/AR2006042200837.html?nav=rss_world/ Rice Lauds Prime Minister-Designate as 'Iraqi Patriot'].

In [[2004]] and [[2005]], she was ranked as the most powerful woman in the world by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine and number two in [[2006]]. She is also one of only two African Americans to have been repeatedly ranked among the [[Time 100|world's 100 most influential people]] by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.

==Early life and education==

Rice was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]], and grew up in the neighborhood of [[Titusville, Birmingham, Alabama|Titusville]]. She is the only child of [[Presbyterian]] minister Reverend [[John Wesley Rice]], Jr., and his wife, the former [[Angelena Rice|Angelena Ray]]. Reverend Rice was a guidance counselor at Ullman High School and minister of Westminster Presbyterian Church, which had been founded by her father. Angelena was a science, music and oratory teacher at Ullman.

Condoleezza (whose name is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] musical expression, ''Con dolcezza'', which means "with sweetness"<ref name=ice>Felix, Antonia [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2092-1367314,00.html Condi: The girl who cracked the ice].

She was instructed to walk proudly in public and to use the facilities at home rather than subject herself to the indignity of "colored" facilities in town. As Rice recalls of her parents and their peers, "they refused to allow the limits and injustices of their time to limit our horizons.”<ref>"Birmingham native Condoleezza Rice confirmation vote delayed as next U.S. Secretary of State" ''Birmingham Times'' [[January 20]], [[2005]]</ref>

However, Rice recalls various times in which she suffered discrimination and persecution on account of her skin color, which include being relegated to a storage room at a department store instead of a regular dressing room, being barred from going to the circus or the local amusement park, being denied hotel rooms, and even being given bad food at restaurants.<ref name=ice />  Also, while Condoleezza was mostly kept by her parents from areas where she might face discrimination, she was very aware of the civil rights struggle and the problems of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] Birmingham. Says neighbor Juliemma Smith, "[Condi] used to call me and say things like, 'Did you see what [[Bull Connor]] did today?'  She was just a little girl and she did that all the time. I would have to read the newspaper thoroughly because I wouldn’t know what she was going to talk about."<ref name=ice />  Rice herself said of the segregation era: "Those terrible events burned into my consciousness.  I missed many days at my segregated school because of the frequent bomb threats."<ref name=ice />

During the violent days of the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], Reverend Rice armed himself and kept guard over the house while Condoleezza practiced the piano inside. According to J.L. Chestnut, Reverend Rice called local civil rights leader [[Fred Shuttlesworth]] and his followers' activism as "misguided".<ref>[http://www.blackcommentator.com/160/160_condi_civil_rights_disdain.html Chestnut 2005].

Rice was eight when her schoolmate Denise McNair was killed in the bombing of the primarily African American [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Sixteenth Street Baptist Church]] by [[white supremacy|white supremacists]] on [[September 15]], [[1963]]. Rice has commented upon that moment in her life: {{Quotation|
I remember the bombing of that Sunday School at 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963. I did not see it happen, but I heard it happen, and I felt it happen, just a few blocks away at my father’s church. It is a sound that I will never forget, that will forever reverberate in my ears. That bomb took the lives of four young girls, including my friend and playmate, Denise McNair. The crime was calculated to suck the hope out of young lives, bury their aspirations. But those fears were not propelled forward, those terrorists failed.<ref name = "RiceBomb">Stan Correy.  [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s1338813.htm Condoleezza, Condoleezza].

After studying piano at the [[Aspen Music Festival and School]], Rice enrolled at the University of Denver, where her father both served as an assistant dean and taught a class called "The Black Experience in America". Dean John Rice was extremely opposed to institutional racism and government oppression and was a vocal protester of the [[Vietnam War]].

Rice attended a course on international politics taught by [[Josef Korbel]], the father of former Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]]. This experience sparked her interest in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[international relations]] and made her call Korbel "one of the most central figures in my life."<ref>Michael Dobbs.

Rice graduated from St. Mary's Academy in 1970. In 1974, at age 19, Rice earned her B.A. in [[political science]] and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from the University of Denver. In 1975, she obtained her [[Master's Degree]] in [[political science]] from the [[University of Notre Dame]]. She first worked in the [[State Department]] in 1977, during the [[Carter administration]], as an intern in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. In 1981, at the age of 26, she received her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Political Science from the Graduate School of International Studies at Denver.

==Academic career==
[[Image:condi_rice.jpg|thumb|235px|right|Condoleezza Rice during a 2005 interview on ITV in London]]
Rice was hired for her first academic position by [[Stanford University]] as an [[Assistant Professor]] in [[political science|Political Science]] (1981&ndash;1987).  She was granted [[tenure]] and promoted, first to [[Associate Professor]] (1987–1993), and then (she was off-campus from 1989–1991) to [[Provost (education)|Provost]], the chief budget and academic officer of the university (1993–2000), and full [[Professor]] (1993–present).<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/2001/10/15/crice.html Condoleezza Rice profile]. [[Forbes]], [[October 18]], [[2001]].</ref> In addition to being the first female and first minority to hold the position of Provost at Stanford, Rice was the youngest Provost in Stanford's history.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2002/black.history/stories/13.rice/index.html CNN Black History article on Dr. Rice.]</ref> She was also named a [[Senior Fellow]] of the [[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies|Institute for International Studies]], and a Senior Fellow (by courtesy) of the [[Hoover Institution]].  She was a specialist on the former [[Soviet Union]] and gave lectures on the subject for the Berkeley-Stanford joint program led by [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] Professor George Breslauer in the mid-1980s. She also was an avid reader of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], and reportedly told a friend she leaned toward the latter in her world view. She was said to be quietly cerebral, friendly but decorous, and popular among students. Friends and co-workers often saw her exercising in the gym or serving breakfast to undergraduates at Midnight Breakfast, a Stanford tradition during final exams.

As Stanford's Provost, Dr. Rice was responsible for managing the university's multi-billion dollar budget.  The school at that time was running a deficit of $20 million.  When Rice took office, she promised that the budget deficit would be balanced within "two years".  Says Coit Blacker, Stanford's deputy director of the Institute for International Studies, "There was a sort of conventional wisdom that said it couldn't be done ... that [the deficit] was structural, that we just had to live with it."  Two years later, Rice convened a meeting to announce that not only had the deficit been balanced, but the university was holding a record surplus of over $14.5 million.<ref>James Robinson [http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/1999/june9/rice-69.html Velvet-glove forcefulness: Six years of provostial challenges and achievements]. Stanford Report Online, [[June 9]], [[1999]]. Retrieved [[July 10]], [[2006]].</ref>

Provost Rice was also responsible for relations with campus organizations, and she managed to maintain friendly contact with various student associations, such as the Venezuelan Student Organization. After departing to enter government service, she returned to Stanford in June 2002 to deliver the commencement address.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rice|first=Condoleezza|title=Acknowledge that you have an obligation to search for the truth|work=Text of Condoleezza Rice address|publisher =Stanford University|date=2002-06-16|url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2002/june19/comm_ricetext-619.html|accessdate=2006-08-04 }}</ref>

Dr. Rice is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and has been awarded honorary doctorates from [[Morehouse College]] in 1991, the [[University of Alabama]] in 1994, the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1995, the [[Mississippi College]] School of Law in 2003, the [[University of Louisville]], [[Michigan State University]] in 2004, and [[Boston College Law School]] in 2006.

She has written or collaborated on several books, including ''[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674353250 Germany Unified and Europe Transformed: A Study in Statecraft]'' (1995), ''[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0916318184 The Gorbachev Era]'' (1986), and ''[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691069212 The Soviet Union and the Czechoslovak Army, 1948-1983: Uncertain Allegiance]'' (1984).

==Business career==
Rice has served on the [[board of directors]] for the [[Carnegie Corporation]], the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], the [[Charles Schwab Corporation]], the [[Chevron Corporation]], [[Hewlett Packard]], the [[Rand Corporation]], the [[Transamerica Corporation]], the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]], and [[KQED]], public broadcasting for San Francisco. She has also sat on the board of the ''International Advisory Council'' of the prominent bank, [[J.P. Morgan Chase]]; the Board of Trustees of the [[University of Notre Dame]]; and the [[San Francisco Symphony]] Board of Governors.

She also headed Chevron's committee on public policy until she resigned on January 15 2001, to become [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] to President [[George W. Bush]]. Chevron honored Rice by naming an oil tanker ''Condoleezza Rice'' after her, but controversy led to its being renamed ''Altair Voyager''.<ref>[http://www.usmm.org/socalships.html Ships of Standard Oil of California "SoCal," (now Chevron)].

In addition, her past board service has encompassed such organizations as the [http://www.nceeer.org National Council for Soviet and East European Studies], the Stanford Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition, and the [[Woodrow Wilson Center]].

==Political career==
===Early phase===
In 1986, while an international affairs fellow of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], Rice served as Special Assistant to the Director of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. 

From 1989 through March 1991 (the period of the fall of [[Berlin Wall]] and the final days of the [[Soviet Union]]), she served in President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush's]] administration as Director, and then Senior Director, of Soviet and East European Affairs in the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and a Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. In this position, Rice helped develop Bush's and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James Baker]]'s policies in favor of [[German reunification]]. She impressed Bush, who later introduced her to Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as the one who "tells me everything I know about the Soviet Union."<ref>Steve Kettmann. [http://dir.salon.com/politics2000/feature/2000/03/20/rice/index.html Bush's secret weapon]. Salon.com. 20 March 2000. Retrieved 21 February 2006.</ref>

In 1989 she served as director for Soviet and East European Affairs at the National Security Council and reported directly to National Security Advisor [[Brent Scowcroft]]. In 1990 she became [[George H. W. Bush]]'s principal advisor on the Soviet Union and was named a special assistant to the president for national security affairs.  At that time she was the highest ranking black woman in the administration.

In 1991, Rice returned to her teaching position at Stanford, although she continued to serve as a consultant on the former Soviet Bloc for numerous clients in both the public and private sectors. Late that year, [[California Governor]] [[Pete Wilson]] appointed her to a bipartisan committee that had been formed to draw new state legislative and congressional districts in the state.

In 1997, she sat on the Federal Advisory Committee on Gender-Integrated Training in the Military.

During George W. Bush's [[2000 U.S. Presidential election]] campaign, Rice took a one-year leave of absence from [[Stanford University]] to help work as his foreign policy advisor. The group of advisors she led called itself [[The Vulcans]] in honor of the monumental [[Vulcan statue]], which sits on a hill overlooking her home town of [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  Rice would later go on to give a [[wikisource:Remarks by Condoleezza Rice at the 2000 Republican National Convention|noteworthy speech]] at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/elections/ricetext080100.htm Text: Condoleezza Rice at the Republican National Convention].

===National Security Advisor (2001&ndash;2005)===

On [[December 17]], [[2000]], Rice was picked to serve as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] and stepped down from her position at Stanford. She was the first woman to occupy the post. In 2001, Rice was staff or board member of [[The Scowcroft Group]] according to a report entitled ''The 2001 Morse Target: Washington's Movers and Shakers on Japan''.<ref>Ronald Morse.

Retrieved [[July 11]], [[2006]].</ref>

During the summer of 2001, Rice met with [[CIA]] Director [[George Tenet]] on an almost daily basis to discuss the possibilities and prevention of terrorist attacks on American targets.  Notably, on [[July 10]], [[2001]], Rice met with Tenet in what he referred to as an "emergency meeting"<ref>New York Times [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/02/washington/03ricecnd.html Records Show Tenet Briefed Rice]. Retrieved [[October 3]], [[2006]]</ref> held at the White House at Tenet's request to brief Rice and the NSC staff about the potential threat of an [[al Qaeda]] attack.  Rice responded by asking Tenet to give a presentation on the matter to Secretary Rumsfeld and (now-former) [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]].<ref>McClatchy Washington Bureau[http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/15662785.htm Rumsfeld, Ashcroft received warning of al Qaida attack before 9/11].

When asked about the meeting in 2006, Rice asserted she did not recall the specific meeting, commenting that she had met ''repeatedly'' with Tenet that summer about terrorist threats.  Moreover, she stated that it was "incomprehensible” to her that she ignored terrorist threats two months before the September 11 attacks.<ref>New York Times [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/02/washington/03ricecnd.html Records Show Tenet Briefed Rice]. Retrieved [[October 3]], [[2006]].</ref>

Rice became one of the most outspoken supporters of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. After [[Iraq]] delivered its declaration of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to the [[United Nations]] on [[December 8]], [[2002]], it was Rice who wrote an [[editorial]] for [[The New York Times]] entitled ''Why We Know Iraq Is Lying''.<ref>Condoleezza Rice.

In March 2004, Rice initially declined to publicly testify under oath before the [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States]] (the [[9/11 Commission]]). The [[White House]] claimed [[executive privilege]] under constitutional [[separation of powers]] and cited past tradition in refusing requests for her public testimony. Under pressure, Bush agreed to allow her to publicly testify <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/08/rice.transcript/ Transcript of Rice's 9/11 commission statement] [[CNN]] Retrieved [[January 16]], [[2007]].</ref> so long as it did not create a precedent of Presidential staff being required to appear before [[United States Congress]] when so requested. In the end, her appearance before the commission on [[April 8]], [[2004]], was deemed acceptable in part because she was not actually appearing before Congress. She thus became the first sitting National Security Advisor to testify on matters of policy.  

Leading up to the [[2004 U.S. Presidential election]], Rice became the first National Security Advisor to campaign for an incumbent president. She used this occasion to express her belief that [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government in Iraq contributed to circumstances that produced terrorism like the 9/11 attacks on America. At a [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] campaign rally she said: "While Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the actual attacks on America, Saddam Hussein's Iraq was a part of the [[Middle East]] that was festering and unstable, [and] was part of the circumstances that created the problem on September 11."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/22/rice.speech.ap/ Rice defends decision to go to war in Iraq].

In 2003, Rice was also drawn into the debate over the [[affirmative action]] admissions policy at the [[University of Michigan]]. On [[January 18]], [[2003]], the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that she was involved in crafting Bush's position on race-based preferences. Rice has stated that she believes that "while race-neutral means are preferable", race can be taken into account as "one factor among others" in university admissions policies.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/17/rice.action/index.html Rice says race can be 'one factor' in considering admissions].

In a [[January 10]], 2003 interview with CNN's [[Wolf Blitzer]], Rice was generally cautious about characterizing possible Iraqi WMD programs. However, she did say something that was, according to Blitzer, "ominous", and made headlines around the world: "The problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons. But we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/01/10/wbr.smoking.gun/ Search for the smoking gun]. [[CNN]], [[January 10]], [[2003]].

After the invasion, when Iraq turned out to have no WMD capability, critics called Rice's claims a "hoax," "deception" and "demagogic scare tactic."<ref>[http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/?q=node/1069]

===Secretary of State (2005&ndash;present)===
[[Image:rice_f.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Condoleezza Rice speaks after being nominated to be [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] (background)]]

On [[November 16]], [[2004]], Bush nominated Rice to be [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], replacing Powell, whose resignation was made public the day before. Bush named Rice's deputy, [[Stephen Hadley]], to replace her as National Security Advisor. On [[January 5]], [[2007]], Bush nominated [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[John Negroponte]] to replace [[Robert B. Zoellick]] as Rice's deputy at the Department of State. Zoellick, a former [[U.S. Trade Representative]] had served in the position since January, 2005. On [[January 19]], [[2005]], the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] voted by 16&ndash;2 margin to approve the forwarding of Rice's nomination to the full Senate for approval, with Democrats [[John Kerry]] and [[Barbara Boxer]] voting against Rice. During her hearing, Boxer questioned Rice on issues about her personal life, which some observers deemed irrelevant.{{fact}} On [[January 26]], 2005, the Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 85&ndash;13. The negative votes, the most cast against any nomination for Secretary of State since 1825, came from Senators who, according to Boxer, wanted "to hold Dr. Rice and the Bush administration accountable for their failures in Iraq and in the war on terrorism." All negative votes came from either [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] or independent senators. Their reasoning was that Rice had acted irresponsibly in equating Hussein's regime with [[Islamism|Islamist]] terrorism and some could not accept her previous record.

On [[October 30]], [[2005]], Rice attended a [[memorial service]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], in Rice's home state, for [[Rosa Parks]], an inspiration for the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]]. Rice stated, that she and others who grew up in Alabama during the height of Parks' activism might not have realized her impact on their lives at the time, "but I can honestly say that without Mrs. Parks, I probably would not be standing here today as secretary of state."<ref>Ecumenical News International.

====Major initiatives====

Since Condoleezza took office as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in January 2005, she has undertaken several major initiatives to reform and restructure the department, as well as U.S. diplomacy as a whole.  Arguably her most substantial initiative has been dubbed "Transformational Diplomacy", a goal which Rice describes as "work[ing] with our many partners around the world ... [and] build[ing] and sustain[ing] democratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of their people and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system."<ref name=TransDip>Office of the Spokesman. [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2006/59339.htm Transformational Diplomacy]. [[January 18]], [[2006]]. [http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/59306.htm Georgetown University address]. [[January 18]], [[2006]].</ref>

[[Image:Rice Transformational Diplomacy Speech.jpg|thumb|235px|right|Rice unveils her plan for restructuring [[United States|American]] [[American foreign policy|foreign policy]], which she calls "Transformational Diplomacy", during a [[January 18]], [[2006]] speech at [[Georgetown University]]]]Rice's Transformational Diplomacy involves approximately five core elements:

* Relocating American diplomats to the places in the world where they are needed most.
* Requiring diplomats to serve some time in "hardship locations", gain expertise in at least two regions, and become fluent in at least two foreign languages.
* Focusing on regional solutions to problems like [[terrorism]], [[drug trafficking]], and diseases.
* Working with other countries on a bilateral basis to help them build a stronger infrastructure, and decreasing foreign nations' dependence on American hand-outs and assistance.
* The creation of a high-level position, director of foreign assistance, to oversee U.S. foreign aid, thus de-fragmenting U.S. foreign assistance.

During Rice's introduction of her plan for Transformational Diplomacy, which she delivered at [[Georgetown University]] on [[January 18]], [[2006]], she highlighted the issue of disproportionate numbers of U.S. foreign workers in relation to the population of the country they are serving in.  As an example, Rice recounted, "We have nearly the same number of State Department personnel in [[Germany]], a country of 82 million people that we have in [[India]], a country of one billion people."  She said that many of the diplomats in comfortable locations, like Europe, would be relocated to countries like [[China]], India, [[Brazil]], [[Egypt]], [[Nigeria]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Lebanon]], which she said had become the "new front lines of our diplomacy."<ref name=TransDip />

Rice also stated that all American diplomats would hereby be required to serve in "hardship posts" and "challenging jobs", citing "critical countries like [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and [[Sudan]] and [[Angola]]."  She said that this move was needed to help "maintain security, fight poverty, and make democratic reforms" in these countries.  Rice asserted that this would help improve foreign nations' [[legal]], [[economic]], [[healthcare]], and [[educational]] systems.<ref name=TransDip />  As for the new foreign language requirements, Rice suggested [[Mandarin Chinese|Chinese]], [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]], and [[Urdu]] as several needed languages.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/18/AR2006011801937.html Diplomats Will Be Shifted to Hot Spots]. [[19 January]] [[2006]].</ref>

Another aspect of Transformational Diplomacy, as outlined in Rice's speech, is the emphasis on finding regional solutions to various problems, rather than relying on one single official solution to a problem in every circumstance.  Rice also pressed for an emphasis on finding transnational solutions as well, stating that "in the 21st century, geographic regions are growing ever more integrated economically, politically and culturally. This creates new opportunities but it also presents new challenges, especially from transnational threats like terrorism and weapons proliferation and drug smuggling and trafficking in persons and disease."<ref name=TransDip />

Another aspect of the emphasis on regional solutions is the implementation of small, agile, "rapid-response" teams to tackle problems like disease, instead of the traditional approach of calling on experts in an [[embassy]].  Rice explained that this means moving diplomats out of the "back rooms of foreign ministries" and putting more effort into "localizing" the State Department's diplomatic posture in foreign nations.  The Secretary emphasized the need for diplomats to move into the largely unreached "bustling new population centers" and to spread out "more widely across countries" in order to become more familiar with local issues and people.<ref name=TransDip />

Finally, Rice announced a major restructuring of U.S. foreign assistance, including nominating [[Randall L. Tobias]], an AIDS relief expert, as the new administrator of [[USAID]] (U.S. Agency for International Development).  Tobias, who will be elevated to a position equivalent of a deputy secretary of state, has the job of focusing the United States' foreign assistance efforts and de-fragmenting the many disparate aid offices that exist.  State Department officials described the move as necessary to "ensure more effective and focused spending overseas."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/18/AR2006011801937.html Diplomats Will Be Shifted to Hot Spots]. [[19 January]] [[2006]].</ref>

Rice says these initiatives are necessary because of the highly "extraordinary time" in which Americans live.  She compares the moves to the historic initiatives taken after [[World War II]], which she claims helped stabilize Europe as it is known today.  Rice states that her Transformational Diplomacy is not merely about "influencing" or "reporting on" governments, but "changing people's lives" through tackling the issues like AIDS, the education of women, and the defeat of violent extremism.<ref name=TransDip />

=====Cuba=====

[[Image:Rice Cuba Commission.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rice convenes a meeting of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba in December 2005]]Rice has been a vocal supporter of political change in [[Cuba]].  She has chaired the [[Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba]] (formed in 2003), which, according to Rice, was created "to explore ways the U.S. can help hasten and ease a democratic transition in Cuba."  Rice says that the message the Commission wishes to send is that "after 46 years of cruel dictatorship, now is the time for change in Cuba."  The Commission seeks to integrate the administration's Cuba policies with all the agencies of the federal government.<ref>Associated Press.

[[Fidel Castro]], in 2005, called the Commission a "group of shit-eaters who do not deserve the world's respect", and referred to Rice as the "mad woman who talks of transition".  Castro has insisted that, in spite of the formation of the Commission, he will press his country ever onward "to [[socialism]] [and] to [[communism]]" and that it is "ridiculous for the U.S. to threaten Cuba now".<ref>Rigoberto Diaz.

In July 2006, Rice and [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Carlos Gutierrez]] released a joint statement reasserting the goals of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba, stating that the Commission will keep a "promise the United States has made to the Cuban people: We will stand with you through the process of transformation to a democratic future ...

=====Iran=====

[[Image:Rice Condemns Iran.jpg|thumb|Rice joins the [[European Union|EU]] in condemning [[Iran]]'s defiance of international protocol and demands [[Tehran]] halt its [[uranium enrichment]] in January 2006]]

Though the U.S. State Department does not hold formal [[diplomatic relations]] with [[Iran]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary]] Rice's tenure has been quite entrenched in issues pertaining to Iran, especially in regards to its [[democracy|democratic]] progress and [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] record, [[President of Iran|Iranian President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s threatening statements toward [[Israel]], and its pursuit of [[nuclear technology]].

In October 2005, Ahmadinejad stated that "Israel must be wiped off the map",<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/15E6BF77-6F91-46EE-A4B5-A3CE0E9957EA.htm Ahmadinejad: Wipe Israel Off Map]. Al Jazeera. [[October 26]], [[2005]]. Retrieved [[July 11]], [[2006]].</ref> to which Rice responded: "When the president of one country says that another country should be wiped off the face of the map, in violation of all of the norms of the United Nations, where they sit together as members, it has to be taken seriously."  Rice then went on to name Iran as "probably the world's most important state sponsor of terrorism", whose people live "without freedom and without the prospect of freedom because an unelected few are denying them that."<ref>[http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4203 Rice denounces Iranian president's call for Israel to be 'wiped off the map']. Iran Focus. [[October 29]], [[2005]]. Retrieved [[July 11]], [[2006]].</ref>

Rice has also been a vocal critic of Iran's [[human rights]] record.  On [[February 3]], [[2005]], Rice said the Iranian regime's treatment of its people is "something to be loathed".  She also stated: "I don't think anybody thinks that the unelected mullahs who run that regime are a good thing for either the Iranian people or for the region."<ref>[http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=1401 Iran human rights record 'to be loathed' -- Rice]. Iran Focus. [[February 3]], [[2005]]. Retrieved [[July 11]], [[2006]].</ref>  In February 2006, Rice called for funding to aid democratic reform in Iran through television and radio [[broadcasting]], through helping pay for Iranians to study in America, and through supporting pro-democracy groups within the country.<ref>Anne Gearan.

In recent years, Iran has also begun to pursue nuclear technology through [[uranium enrichment]], which has been one of the most pertinent issues that Rice has dealt with during her tenure at the State Department.  Iran maintains that its nuclear program only seeks to develop the capacity for peaceful civilian [[nuclear power]] generation.<ref name="gen2010">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2419/pdf/i3.pdf|title=Nuclear Power Plants Will Generate 6,000MW by 2010|accessdate=2006-04-25|publisher=Iran Daily}}</ref>  Rice, along with other nations, has contended that Iran's record of sponsoring terrorism and threatening the safety of other nations, along with its defiance of its treaty obligations, of the United Nations Security Council, and of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], have not proven Iran to be responsible enough to conduct uranium enrichment without outside supervision.  Under Rice, the official State Department consensus on the matter is that "[t]he United States believes the Iranian people should enjoy the benefits of a truly peaceful program to use nuclear reactors to generate electric power ... [and] support[s] the Iranian people’s rights to develop nuclear energy peacefully, with proper international safeguards."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/2006/68109.htm Iran at a Crossroads: An Historic Opportunity for A Better Future]. U.S. State Department. [[June 20]], [[2006]].</ref>

On [[September 9]], [[2005]], Rice declared the refusal of Iran to halt its nuclear program unacceptable and called on [[Russia]], [[China]] and [[India]] to join in threatening [[United Nations]] sanctions as punishment for Tehran, and on [[June 2]], [[2006]], an international committee, consisting of the [[Big Five|five permanent members]] of the [[UN Security Council]] and [[Germany]], announced their plan to convince Iran to cease its nuclear activities.  Rice represented the United States in the negotiation of the diplomatic initiative.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2041368,00.html World Powers Agree on Deal, Wait on Iran]. [[Deutsche Welle]]. [[June 2]], [[2006]]. Retrieved [[June 2]], [[2006]].</ref>

On [[February 14]], [[2006]], Iran restarted its uranium enrichment program despite calls from the international community not to do so. Iran's traditional foe, Iraq, offered no resistance because Iraq's leadership had been transformed to Shiite control.  Rice responded by asserting that "[t]here is simply no peaceful rationale for the Iranian regime to resume uranium enrichment."  Speaking on behalf of the United States and the [[European Union]], Rice said they were "gravely concerned by Iran's long history of hiding sensitive nuclear activities from the IAEA, in violation of its obligations, its refusal to cooperate with the IAEA's investigation, its rejection of diplomatic initiatives offered by the EU and Russia and now its dangerous defiance of the entire international community."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/59083.htm On-the-Record Briefing by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice]. U.S. State Department. [[January 12]] [[2006]].</ref>  In May of 2006, Rice came up with a new approach for dealing with Iran: direct negotiation between Iran and the United States (alongside their European allies) and the possibility for "a package of economic incentives and some kind of longer-term relationship with the United States" in exchange for the suspension of uranium enrichment within Iran.<ref name=Diplo-Dancing>Hirsh, Michael.

[[June 12]], [[2006]]: 32.</ref> Iran responded by saying that it will "never give up its legitimate rights, so the American preconditions are just unacceptable."<ref name=Diplo-Dancing />

On [[July 12]], 2006, Rice, along with the foreign ministers of China, [[France]], [[Germany]], Russia, the [[United Kingdom]], and the European Union, held a press conference to announce that, as a result of Iran's refusal to open the door to diplomatic negotiations via suspending their uranium enrichment program, they had agreed to seek a [[UN Security Council Resolution]] against Iran under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the [[UN Charter]].<ref>[http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/68910.htm P5 + 1 Statement: Negotiations With Iran.

Retrieved [[12 July]] [[2006]].</ref>

Though the United States and Iran disagree on key issues, the State Department has offered aid to Iran on many different occasions.  After a deadly earthquake struck the Iranian [[province]] of [[Lorestan]] in March of 2005, Sec. Rice offered humanitarian aid to the country during a visit to [[England]].  Rice said her "thoughts and prayers" were with the victims.<ref>[http://www.iranmania.com/News/ArticleView/Default.asp?NewsCode=41680&NewsKind=Current%20Affairs Rice offers humanitarian aid to quake-hit Iran].

=====Iraq=====

[[September 30]], [[2005]].</ref>

Though repeatedly pressed for a timetable for the withdrawal of [[U.S. military]] troops from Iraq, Rice is known for her opposition to the use of "deadlines" and date-setting in diplomacy and has remained steadfast in her refusal to set a date for any withdrawal(s).  Rice, while having little say in the issue of troop withdrawal, has consistently affirmed that American soldiers will not leave Iraq until the country is stable and its peacekeeping forces are able to maintain stability on their own.

In 2005, when asked how long U.S. troops will stay in Iraq, Rice responded by saying, "I don't want to speculate. I do know that we are making progress with what the Iraqis themselves are capable of doing. And as they are able to do certain tasks, as they are able to hold their own territory, they will not need us to do that."  When pressed again for a specific year, the Secretary added, "I think that even to try and speculate on how many years from now there will be a certain number of American forces is not appropriate."<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/20/content_3652362.htm Rice makes clear US objectives in Iraq]. [[October 20]], [[2005]].</ref>

Rice lauded Iraq's voter turnout and peaceful transition into a sovereign constitutional government in 2005, and Rice (an [[Eastern Europe|East-European]]/[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] expert) has frequently compared the post-war reconstruction of Iraq to that of Europe and [[Russia]] after [[World War II]].  In a ''[[Washington Post]]'' editorial published on [[December 11]], [[2005]], Rice wrote: 
{{Quotation| 
"Iraq ... in the face of a horrific insurgency has held historic elections, drafted and ratified a new national charter, and will go to the polls again in coming days to elect a new constitutional government.  At this time last year, such unprecedented progress seemed impossible. One day it will all seem to have been inevitable. This is the nature of extraordinary times, which former Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] understood well and described perfectly in his memoirs. 'The significance of events,' he wrote, 'was shrouded in ambiguity. We groped after interpretations of them, sometimes reversed lines of action based on earlier views, and hesitated long before grasping what now seems obvious.' When Acheson left office in 1953, he could not know the fate of the policies he helped to create. He certainly could never have predicted that nearly four decades later, war between Europe's major powers would be unthinkable, or that America and the world would be harvesting the fruits of his good decisions and managing the collapse of communism. But because leaders such as Acheson steered American statecraft with our principles when precedents for action were lacking, because they dealt with their world as it was but never believed they were powerless to change it for the better, the promise of democratic peace is now a reality in all of Europe and in much of Asia."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/09/AR2005120901711.html The Promise of Democratic Peace].

=====Middle East=====

[[Image:Rice and Shalom.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Rice shakes hands with former Israeli Foreign Minister [[Silvan Shalom]] in a July 2005 visit to Israel]]

One of the most eventful chapters of Secretary Rice's tenure so far has been the situation in the [[Middle East]], particularly pertaining to [[Israel]], [[Palestine]], and its immediate neighbors, especially [[Lebanon]].  Rice has consistently been a supporter of Israel, and has defended Israel's right to protect itself in the ongoing [[Israel-Palestine conflict]] and in the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]].  Rice has also been a key player in promoting the "[[roadmap for peace]]" in that region, which includes the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state.  On [[August 29]], [[2006]], she stated that the Middle East "should be a Middle East in which there is a Palestinian state in which Palestinians can have their own aspirations met, one that is not corrupt, one that is democratic, [and] one in which there is only one authority."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/p/nea/rt/c2829.htm Middle East Peace]. [[August 29]], [[2006]].</ref>

''Gaza Withdrawal''

Rice has spent much time and effort persuading Israel to withdraw from Palestinian territories and freeing up [[commerce]] and [[travel]] between the two areas.  During the summer of 2005, the Secretary set out on a mission to help ensure that Israeli leadership would follow through on withdrawing forces from settlements in [[Gaza]] and the [[West Bank]].  Initially faced with much skepticism, doubt, and lack of progress, Rice spent much of April 2005 raising support amongst Arab leaders.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/burmese/archive/2005-04/2005-04-12-voa10.cfm Rice Conducts Telephone Diplomacy on Israel's Gaza Withdrawal Plans].

[[July 24]], [[2005]].</ref>  While in the region, Rice guided the negotiations and helped coordinate the final stages of the move, which eventually came to fruition in September.  Rice hailed the successful withdrawal as a victory for both Israel and Palestine, saying, "This is an historic moment for both sides, and the commitment of both sides to a successful disengagement process has been impressive."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/53013.htm Completion of Israeli Withdrawal From Gaza]. [[September 12]], [[2005]].</ref>  Gaza is now under Palestinian control once again for the first time in 38 years.  However, one key issue that Palestinians felt was going unresolved was the inability to travel through border crossings in and out of Gaza, which had prevented the ability of Palestine to rebuild its shattered economy.<ref name=mediates />

''Border Crossings Deal''

[[Image:Rice Border Crossing Deal.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Rice announces the successful brokering of the deal to open Gaza border crossings after a sleepless 48-hour negotiation]] In November 2005, Secretary Rice made it clear she would attempt to negotiate an opening of the Gaza border crossings once and for all.  [[James Wolfensohn]], who had been appointed as the United States' special envoy for Gaza Disengagement for the [[Quartet on the Middle East]], had brokered months of talks on the issue and had ultimately been unsuccessful in negotiating a deal.  Wolfensohn warned that increasing tensions in the region left very little time for Israel and Palestine to wrap up the deal.<ref>[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/11/14/90016.shtml Rice: Gaza Border-Crossings Deal 'In Sight']. [[November 14]], [[2005]].</ref>  The Secretary initially encountered resistance, but decided to make a final push to broker the deal, extending her visit to Jerusalem an extra 48 hours.  Rice, in a [[Henry Kissinger|Kissingerian]] feat, launched a mediation session at 11:00 p.m. on Monday, [[November 14]],  meeting alternately with Israel and Palestinian delegations and refusing to allow either side to go to bed until they reached the deal which had eluded mediators since 1967.  "Piece by piece", one senior State Department official recounted, Rice shuttled up and down the corridor negotiating down through a long list of differences between Israel and Palestine that included a proposed blacklist of Palestinians that have been detained by Israel and a concern that future violence would induce a renewed closure of the border crossings.  By mid-morning of Tuesday, [[November 15]], Rice held a press conference to announce that an agreement had been made between the two parties to open Gaza's borders, which many hailed as a major step forward in the "roadmap for peace" process.  The deal laid out the terms for establishing a system of transportation between Gaza and the West Bank, as well as defining the operations in regards to transporting cargo and people across the border and allowing Gaza to reopen its international airport and begin work on a seaport that will expand Palestine's capacity for international commerce.  The [[Rafah]] border crossing, which provides Palestine's only land link to another country other than Israel, was a key accomplishment of the negotiations.  The deal also provides for monitoring of the crossings by officials from the [[European Union]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/15/AR2005111500144_2.html Rice Negotiates Deal to Open Gaza Crossings].

''Hamas, Palestinian elections''

[[Image:Palestine election map.PNG|thumb|right|Map showing electoral districts and areas of formal Palestinian control (green)]]The next major undertaking of Secretary Rice in the region came when she pushed for peaceful, democratic elections in Palestine following the death of [[Yasser Arafat]].  Rice asserted that "there should be the ability of Palestinian people to participate in the elections" and claimed that democratic elections would represent "a key step in the process of building a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state".  Secretary Rice, also aware that members of the U.S.-labeled terrorist organization [[Hamas]] were planning on infiltrating the new government, stated that "there should be no place in the political process for groups or individuals who refuse to renounce terror and violence, recognize Israel's right to exist, and disarm", coining what has come to be one of Rice's more famous phrases, saying, "You cannot have one foot in politics and the other foot in terror."<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/uspolicy/archive/2006-01/2006-01-18-voa2.cfm Rice on Palestinian Elections]. [[January 18]], [[2006]].</ref>

One of the first steps Rice took in the matter was pressuring a reluctant Israel to allow Israeli Palestinians in [[East Jerusalem]] to vote in the Palestinian Authority elections. The Secretary helped to successfully persuade them, and Israel's cabinet voted unanimously to allow Palestinians in East Jerusalem to vote in the [[January 25]] parliamentary elections, while banning Hamas, which officially calls for Israel's destruction, from campaigning in East Jerusalem.  When, on January 25, Palestine held its elections in a relatively very peaceful and open format, Rice lauded the turnout, congratulating President Abbas and the Palestinian people, while at the same time informing Hamas, which had taken control of the government in the election, that it would "have to make some difficult choices", saying, "Those who win elections have an obligation to govern democratically. … It now inherits the obligations of a Palestinian government, authority, that go back now for more than a decade to recognize the right of Israel to exist, to renounce violence, to disarm militias, as is the case in the roadmap, and to find a peaceful solution in two states."<ref>[http://usinfo.state.gov/is/Archive/2006/Jan/31-340686.html Rice Lauds Peaceful Palestinian Elections, Decries Terrorism]. [[January 30]], [[2006]].</ref>

One of the key points of contention between Israel and the newly Hamas-led Palestinian government is Hamas' official charter position which refuses to recognize Israel.  Immediately following Hamas' victory in the elections, Rice attempted to garner international support in demanding that Hamas recognize Israel's right to exist.  By April, Hamas officials appeared to publicly state that they are willing to work toward recognizing Israel.  Under their terms, Israel would have to fully withdraw from disputed territories, including Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/254A8588-3089-495E-9D54-FE87479080DB.htm Hamas 'willing' to recognise Israel]. [[April 12]], [[2006]].</ref>  Many saw this as a positive starting point for negotiations that would allow the "roadmap" process to continue.  The statement was verified by Hamas leaders such as Mohammed Ghazal, a Hamas militia official, who stated that Hamas may be willing to amend its charter to recognize Israel, saying, "The charter is not the [[Quran]]."  Ghazal went on to state that while he agreed with Hamas' positions, "we’re talking now about reality, about political solutions … The realities are different."<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9424469/ Hamas: We could one day recognize Israel].

''2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict''

[[Image:Rice Special Briefing on Mideast Peace.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Rice delivers a special briefing on Middle East Peace in the State Department Briefing Room, July 21, 2006]]In mid-July 2006, the Middle East peace process encountered a new obstacle on a different front when [[Hezbollah]] fighters from Lebanon launched rocket attacks into Israel and ambushed Israeli convoys, kidnapping two soldiers and killing three, sparking what has become known as the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict.  Secretary Rice immediately condemned the act, calling Hezbollah a "terrorist organization" and saying that the action "undermines regional stability and goes against the interests of both the Israeli and Lebanese people", specifically calling on [[Syria]] to "use its influence to support a positive outcome."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/68902.htm Actions in Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon]. [[July 12]], [[2006]].</ref>  That day, Rice was one of the first to speak directly to [[UN]] [[United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]], Lebanese Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora]] and Israeli [[Israeli Foreign Minister|Foreign Minister]] [[Tzipi Livni]] concerning the incident.  Israel initiated aerial bombardments against Lebanon on [[July 13]] and sent in land troops on [[July 23]] to take out rocket launching sites that were shelling Northern Israeli cities, as well as to look for and recover the two kidnapped Israeli soldiers.

While the official United States position given by President [[George W. Bush]] was a clear endorsement of Israel's activities, Secretary Rice seemed to take a middle ground.  While she supported Israel's right to defend itself from Hezbollah attacks, she repeatedly cautioned Israel to be responsible in minimizing [[collateral damage]].  Before the major fighting began, Rice demanded that both Israel and Lebanon "act with restraint to resolve this incident peacefully and to protect innocent life and civilian infrastructure."  She also continued to pressure Syria to take a more active positive role throughout the crisis, accusing Syria of "sheltering the people who have been perpetrating these acts" and calling on it "to act responsibly and stop the use of its territory for these kinds of activities[,] to bring all pressure on those that it is harbouring to stop this and to return these soldiers and to allow the situation to be de-escalated."<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L13880934.htm U.S.'s Rice urges Israel to exercise restraint]. [[July 13]], [[2006]].</ref>

[[Image:Rice Annan and Siniora.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Rice, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi work to lay the foundation for Resolution 1701, which ultimately imposed a ceasefire on the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]]Rice seemed to be holding off on her involvement during the conflict's early stages, which received criticism from some.  "When it is appropriate and when it is necessary and will be helpful to the situation, I am more than pleased to go to the region", Rice stated on [[July 19]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/18/AR2006071801436_pf.html Bush Supports Israel's Move Against Hezbollah]. [[July 19]], [[2006]].</ref>  When Rice arrived in the Middle East a few days later, one of her first moves was a surprise unannounced visit to Lebanese Prime Minister Siniora to praise Siniora's "courage and steadfastness" and show U.S. support for the Lebanese people.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5209778.stm Rice holds key talks in Lebanon]. [[July 24]], [[2006]].</ref>  Rice initially drew criticism for her statement that the conflict was part of "the birth pangs of a new Middle East", stating that Israel, Lebanon, and the international community had to "be certain that we're pushing forward to the new Middle East not going back to the old one"<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/69331.htm Special Briefing on Travel to the Middle East and Europe]. [[July 21]], [[2006]].</ref> At the time, many felt that the statements were too presumptuous with no clear end to the conflict in sight, though much of this criticism has died down since the successful passage of the ceasefire in August.

While things initially looked positive for the Secretary in the region, an unfortunate mistake was made by the Israeli military when it launched an airstrike on a suspected Hezbollah hideout in [[Qana]], Lebanon, that killed 20–60 innocent civilians, many of whom were women and children.  The [[2006 Qana airstrike|airstrike]] seemed to sour many nation's support for Israel's endeavor and [[Beirut]] even cancelled a visit by Secretary Rice as a result.<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L30778296.htm Israel strike kills at least 54, Lebanon shuns Rice]. [[July 30]], [[2006]].</ref>  While the tragedy was a major setback in the negotiation process, it seemed to be a turning point for Israel, who, afterward, began taking a path toward a cease-fire, which they had previously rejected.  Before Rice left the region on [[July 27]] to tend to other commitments, including the [[ASEAN]] Regional Forum in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] she was able to negotiate a quick 48-hour halt on Israeli air-raids, except in case of unprovoked attacks for self defense.

[[Image:Rice and Annan.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Rice appears with UN Secretary General Annan to announce the successful passage of Resolution 1701, which imposed a ceasefire on the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]]Rice ultimately cut her Asia-trip short to return to the Mideast on July 29, where the outlines of the ceasefire to come began to take shape.  As the end of the conflict began to come into sight, Rice constantly demanded that the global community do what it could to ensure that the Mideast region would never again return to, what she called, the "status quo ante".  Rice saw the situation as an opportunity to create a new environment in which Israel and Lebanon could live in peace, and in which Lebanon could have full control over all its territories without Hezbollah acting as a "state within a state", being able to launch terrorist attacks on Israel.  Building on the two resolutions that came out of the [[G8]] [[32nd G8 summit|Conference]] and the steps that had been taken at the conference in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] in late July, the Secretary worked with other leaders at the United Nations to pass [[UN Security Council Resolution 1701]] on [[August 11]], 2006, which sought to resolve the crisis and has, so far, put a significant end to hostilities in the region.  The ceasefire, which both parties had initially rejected, was passed unanimously by both the Israeli and the Lebanese cabinets, and went into effect on [[August 14]] at 8:00 a.m. local time.  The ceasefire that Rice helped broker provided for a full cessation of hostilities, a Lebanese-led international force to take the place of the Israeli forces, the disarmament of Hezbollah, full control of the Lebanese government to Lebanon, and an absence of paramilitary forces (including and implying Hezbollah) south of the [[Litani River]]; it also emphasizes the need for the immediate release of the two kidnapped Israeli soldiers.  Rice lauded the outcome and expressed pleasure that the hostilities in the area had finally been brought to an end.  Though there were sporadic, but small, spurts of violence after the ceasefire took effect, it has ultimately sustained, while international peacekeeping forces, volunteered largely by European and Arab countries, began to replace Israeli forces.  On [[October 2]], [[2006]], the last Israeli forces were completely withdrawn from Lebanon, allowing the UN and the Lebanese military to completely take over the operations.<ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/home/article.html?in_article_id=20428&in_page_id=1 Israel leaves Lebanon to UN].

=====North Korea=====

[[Image:Rice in China.jpg|thumb|224px|right|Rice, in a July, 2005 press conference, announces that North Korea has agreed to return to the Six Party Talks]]

[[North Korea]], like [[Iran]], is barred from formal diplomatic relations with the [[United States]], though much of Rice's career in the [[United States State Department|State Department]] has been consumed by issues surrounding Korea.  Perhaps the most important has been the international concern over North Korea's nuclear weapons program.  A series of negotiations featuring [[China]], [[North Korea]], [[South Korea]], the United States, [[Russia]], and [[Japan]], have taken place since 2003, which have been dubbed "The [[Six Party talks]]".  These talks have been aimed at denuclearizing the [[Korean Peninsula]].

On [[February 10]] [[2005]], North Korea withdrew from the talks after [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]]'s 2005 [[State of the Union Address]], in which he stated that North Korea's nuclear program must be dismantled and pledged to go on the offensive against tyranny in the world.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/02/20050202-11.html State of the Union Address]. [[February 2]], [[2005]].</ref>  North Korea complained that the United States harbored a "hostile policy" toward their country and stated that they were permanently withdrawing from the Six-Party talks.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/09/AR2005070901136.html N. Korea Agrees To Rejoin Talks]. [[July 10]], [[2005]].</ref>  In the following months, there was uncertainty over whether Rice could convince [[Kim Jong-Il]] to re-enter the negotiations, but in July 2005, North Korea announced that they had been convinced to return to the discussion.  

After the first phase of the 5th round of talks, which took place from [[November 9]]–[[November 11|11]], 2005, North Korea suspended its participations in the negotiations because the United States would not unfreeze some of its financial assets in a [[Macau]] bank.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4905308.stm N Korea offers nuclear talks deal].  [[April 13]], [[2006]].</ref>  Rice has consistently called for the regime to return to the talks.  On [[May 1]], [[2006]], Rice stated that North Korea needs "to return expeditiously to the talks without preconditions, to dismantle its nuclear programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and to cease all illicit and proliferation activities."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/65523.htm Joint Statement by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Taro Aso, and Japanese Minister of State for Defense Fukushiro Nukaga].  [[May 1]], [[2006]].</ref>

On [[June 19]], [[2006]], matters with North Korea were further complicated when it finished fueling an intercontinental ballistic missile that the regime said it would test fire.  North Korea had previously self-imposed a missile-firing moratorium, but threatened to launch the missile anyway.  Rice stated that "it would be a very serious matter and indeed a provocative act" for the North to follow through on the act, and that if the North decided to do so, "it would be taken with utmost seriousness."<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,200036,00.html U.S.: North Korea Readies Missile for Test].  [[June 19]], [[2006]].</ref>

On [[July 5]], [[2006]], [[North Korean missile test, 2006|North Korea test-fired seven rockets]], including the infamous [[Taepodong-2]],<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/07/05/korea.missile/index.html North Korea test-fires 7th missile].  [[July 5]], [[2006]].</ref> sparking international backlash.  Rice, in a press conference held on the same day, stated that she couldn't even begin to try to judge what motivated the North Koreans to act in such a way.  Rice felt that North Korea had "miscalculated that the international community would remain united [in their opposition to the missile test-firing]" and "whatever they thought they were doing, they've gotten a very strong reaction from the international community."  Following the missile test, the [[United Nations Security Council]] held an emergency meeting and strongly condemned the actions, though no official sanctions resulted at the time.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/68577.htm Remarks With Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Gul After Their Meeting].  [[July 5]], [[2006]].</ref>

Then, in early October 2006, North Korea claimed that it was preparing to test a nuclear explosive device.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=26d800c9-00a5-4464-b7d1-6d02e1e2b033&k=51003 North Korea threatens nuke test].  [[October 3]], [[2006]].</ref>  While the rumors could not be substantiated by satellite surveillance beforehand, the test was actually carried out on [[October 9]], [[2006]] with only twenty minutes warning.<ref>[http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/10/10/d61010013418.htm Defiant North Korea conducts nuke test].  [[October 10]], [[2006]].</ref>  The [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|nuclear detonation test]] was, purportedly, in response to the United States' decision to not hold direct bilateral talks with the regime, as well as America's increasing pressure on the government, which North Korea claims is evidence that the United States wishes to attack or invade their country.  Secretary Rice disputes North Korea's claim that the nuclear test was committed to deter America from invading, saying, "We shouldn't even allow them such an excuse. ... It's just not the case. ... [T]here is no intention to invade or attack them. [T]hey have that guarantee."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/73805.htm Interview With Wolf Blitzer of CNN].  [[October 10]], [[2006]].</ref>

[[Image:Rice and Lavrov.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Rice meets with Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] in [[Busan, South Korea]] to discuss North Korea]]Rice has also repeatedly offered direct negotiations with North Korea in the context of the Six Party Talks, but she has held her ground in her decision not to hold bilateral talks with the dictatorship, stating, "We've been through bilateral talks with the North Koreans in the 1994 agreed framework. It didn't hold. ... The North Koreans cheated [by] pursuing another path to a nuclear weapon, the so-called 'highly [[enriched uranium]]' path. ... [I]f [Kim Jong-Il] wants a bilateral deal, it's because he doesn't want to face the pressure of other states [nearer to him] that have leverage. It's not because he wants a bilateral deal with the United States. He doesn't want to face the leverage of China or South Korea or others."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/73805.htm Interview With Wolf Blitzer of CNN].  [[October 10]], [[2006]].</ref>

Following the nuclear test, Secretary Rice made numerous calls to foreign leaders to consolidate support for taking punitive action against North Korea.  Rice was able to draw condemnations from even some of North Korea's closest defenders, including China, who admitted the test was "flagrant" and "brazen".<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20061011.KOREAMAIN11/TPStory/TPInternational/Asia China backs punishing N. Korea].  [[October 11]], [[2006]].</ref>  On the same day as the nuclear detonation, the United Nations Security Council convened another emergency meeting, where a clear consensus was apparent in favor of sanctions against the regime, with even China saying that it supported punishing the regime,<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,217939,00.html U.S. Aircraft Keeps Watch for N. Korean Nuke Test] [[October 11]], [[2006]].</ref> changing its position from July, 2006, when it vetoed any sanctions on North Korea following its missile tests.  On [[October 14]], [[2006]], Secretary Rice worked with allies to pass a UN Security Council resolution against North Korea that demanded North Korea destroy all of its nuclear weapons, imposed a ban on tanks, warships, combat aircraft and missiles in the country, imposed an embargo on some luxury items that government officials enjoy while the general populace starves, froze some of the country's weapons-related financial assets, and allows for inspections of North Korean cargo.<ref>[http://apnews.myway.com/article/20061014/D8KOI9DO0.html U.N. Adopts Resolution Against N.

While Rice consistently affirms that the United States will not [[preemptive war|preemptively invade]], attack, or topple the North Korean regime, she emphatically assured Japan during an [[October 18]], [[2006]], visit that "the United States has the will and the capability to meet the full range–and I underscore full range–of its deterrent and security commitments to Japan", which many have interpreted to mean that America would not hesitate to use its [[American military|military]] might should North Korea attack one of America's allies.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/74669.htm Remarks With Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso After Their Meeting] [[October 18]], [[2006]].</ref>

=====Russia=====
[[Image:Rice and Putin.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Secretary Rice speaks with Russian President Vladimir Putin during an April 2005 trip to Russia]]In April 2005, Rice went to [[Russia]] to meet President [[Vladimir Putin]]. On the plane trip over, she related comments critical of Russia's democratic progress to reporters. "Trends have not been positive on the democratic side", said Rice. "There have been some setbacks, but I do still think there is a considerable amount of individual freedom in Russia, which is important."<ref>[http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:3zfb-a4YWzsJ:www.heraldsun.news.com.au/printpage/0,5481,15032888,00.html+%22Rice+attacks+Russia+on+democracy%22&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=2&client=firefox-a Rice attacks Russia on democracy]. Herald Sun. 21 April 2005. Retrieved from the [[Google]] cache, April 2005.</ref>  In person she told [[Putin]]: "We see Russia as a partner in solving regional issues, like the [[Balkans]] or the Middle East."

In late 2005, there was a dispute between Russia and [[Ukraine]] after Russia decided to quadruple the price of energy being provided to the Ukrainian market<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4562952.stm Russia-Ukraine gas row heats up]. BBC. [[December 27]] [[2005]].</ref> (Making the price equal to that of the current market price). Rice subsequently criticised Russia's actions, accusing Russia of using its gas wealth as a political weapon.  She called on Russia to behave as a responsible energy supplier and stated that the act did not show the international community "that it is now prepared to act … as an energy supplier in a responsible way."  Rice insisted, "When you say you want to be a part of the international economy and you want to be a responsible actor in the international economy, then you play by its rules … I think that kind of behavior is going to continue to draw comment about the distance between Russian behavior and something like this and what would be expected of a responsible member of the [[G-8]]."<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,180720,00.html Rice: Russia Uses Energy Wealth as Political Weapon]. Fox News. [[January 5]] [[2006]].</ref>

In January 2006, [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], the populist leader of the nationalistic [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]], made highly controversial statements that Rice was critical of Russia because she was unmarried and aging.  Zhirinovsky said, "Condoleezza Rice released a coarse anti-Russian statement … because she is a single woman who has no children. … Condoleezza Rice needs a company of soldiers. She needs to be taken to barracks where she would be satisfied. On the other hand, she can hardly be satisfied because of her age. … The true reason of Ms. Rice's attack against Russia is very simple. Condoleezza Rice is a very cruel, offended woman who lacks men's attention."<ref>[http://english.pravda.ru/main/18/88/354/16724_Condoleezza.html Condoleezza Rice's anti-Russian stance based on sexual problems].

NY Daily News. [[January 13]] [[2006]].</ref>

In February 2006, Rice described the United States' relationship with Russia as "very good", saying, "In general, I think we have very good relations with Russia. Probably the best relations that have been there for quite some time. We cooperate in the [[war on terror]]. We cooperate in a number of areas. Obviously we have some differences, too.  But on the [[Iran|Iranian]] situation, we've actually had very good cooperation with the Russians."

Though there was some question over whether or not Rice could convince Russia not to block the United States' move to refer Iran to the [[United Nations Security Council]] in early 2006 (because of Russia's [[economy|economic]] and diplomatic ties to Iran), [[Russian Foreign Minister]] [[Sergei Lavrov]] eventually called Secretary Rice to confirm that Russia had agreed to allow the move.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/11/AR2006011102124.html Russia Won't Block U.S. on Iran].

Chávez reacted to this criticism by stating that he thought Rice was "dreaming about" him, presumably in a romantic manner.  Chávez stated that Rice's problems with him were a product of sexual frustration and added, "I could invite her on a date to see what happens between us."  However, he stated that he would not "make that sacrifice" for his country and instead nominated three political allies to "do it".<ref name=Decatur>{{Harvard reference

====Terrorism====
[[Image:Condoleezza Rice and Rangin Dadfar Spanta.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rice meets with Afghan Foreign Minister [[Rangin Dadfar Spanta|Spanta]] to discuss anti-terrorism efforts]]Dr. Rice's policy as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] views counterterrorism as a matter of being preventative, and not merely punitive.  In an interview that took place on [[December 18]], [[2005]], Sec. Rice stated: "We have to remember that in this war on terrorism, we're not talking about criminal activity where you can allow somebody to commit the crime and then you go back and you arrest them and you question them. If they succeed in committing their crime, then hundreds or indeed thousands of people die. That's why you have to prevent, and intelligence is the long pole in the tent in preventing attacks."<ref>U.S. State Department [http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/58232.htm Interview on Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace]. [[December 18]], [[2005]].</ref>

Rice has also been a frequent critic of the intelligence community's inability to cooperate and share information, which she believes is an integral part of preventing terrorism.  In 2000, a year before the [[September 11th terrorist attacks]], Dr. Rice warned during an interview on [[WJR]], a [[Detroit]] radio station: "You really have to get the intelligence agencies better organized to deal with the terrorist threat to the [[United States]] itself. One of the problems that we have is a kind of split responsibility, of course, between the [[CIA]] and foreign intelligence and the [[FBI]] and domestic intelligence."  She then added: "There needs to be better cooperation because we don't want to wake up one day and find out that [[Osama bin Laden]] has been successful on our own territory."<ref>[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2004/3/24/120740.shtml Rice Quotes Contradict Clarke Account].  NewsMax. [[March 24]], [[2004]].</ref>

Sec. Rice also has promoted the idea that counterterrorism involves not only confronting the governments and organizations that promote and condone terrorism, but also the ideologies that fuel terrorism.  In a speech given on [[July 29]], [[2005]], Sec. Rice asserted that "[s]ecuring America from terrorist attack is more than a matter of law enforcement. We must also confront the ideology of hatred in foreign societies by supporting the universal hope of liberty and the inherent appeal of democracy".<ref>U.S. State Department [http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/50375.htm Remarks With Senator Richard Lugar on the U.S. Department of State and the Challenges of the 21st Century]. [[July 29]], [[2005]].</ref>

In January 2005, during Bush's [[Inauguration Day|second inaugural ceremonies]], Rice first used the term "[[outposts of tyranny]]" to refer to countries felt to threaten world peace and human rights. This term has been called a descendant of Bush's phrase, "[[Axis of Evil]]", used to describe [[Iraq]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]. She identified six such "outposts" in which she said the United States has a duty to foster freedom: [[Cuba]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Burma]] and [[Belarus]], as well as Iran and North Korea.

====Travels====

This is a higher ranking in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] than any other woman had ever achieved before [[Nancy Pelosi]] became the Speaker of the House. (Former Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] was not born in the U.S. and was therefore ineligible to become President.) 

Her supporters have touted a future Vice Presidential or Presidential candidacy as a possibility. Many websites and organizations seek to [[Draft Condi movement|draft Rice]] and make her candidacy a reality.  The most noteworthy of these groups, "[[Americans For Rice|Americans for Dr. Rice]]", is a [[527 group]], not approved by any candidate or party, dedicated to the candidacy, and election, of Rice in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential race]].

However, Rice has repeatedly said she has no desire or interest in becoming President. Interviewed by [[Tim Russert]] on [[March 14]], [[2005]], Rice declared, "I will not run for president of the United States. How is that? I don't know how many ways to say 'no' in this town."<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7181496/site/newsweek/ The secretary of State says she’s not planning to run for president in 2008. Will she change her mind?]. Newsweek. 21 March 2005. Retrieved 21 February 2006.</ref>

During an interview with Russian [[Echo Moscow]] Radio, Rice was asked about her intentions concerning running for President.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,154104,00.html Rice Says in Russian She'll Run for President].

Retrieved [[21 February]] [[2006]].</ref> When asked by a schoolgirl, "One day you will run for president?" she replied, "President, да, да [yes, yes]", before she quickly answered with "нет, нет, нет [no, no, no]."

However, in May 2005, several of Rice's associates claimed that she would be willing to run for the presidency if she were [[draft (politics)|drafted]] into the race.<ref>[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/whispers/articles/050530/30whisplead.htm Rice Wants It--But in Draft Form]. USNews.com. [[30 May]] [[2005]]</ref> On [[October 16]], [[2005]], on [[NBC]]'s [[Meet the Press]], Rice again denied she would run for President in 2008. While she says she is flattered that many people want her to run, she says it is not what she wants to do with her life. Rice told ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'' host, [[Chris Wallace]]: "I'm quite certain that there are going to be really fine candidates for president from our party, and I'm looking forward to seeing them and perhaps supporting them."<ref>[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/10/16/national/w081714D55.DTL Rice: I Don't Want to Run for President].

On [[CNN]]'s [[The Situation Room]] on [[January 17]], 2006, Mrs. Bush implicated Rice when asked if she thought the United States would soon have a female President, stating: "I'd love to see her run.  She's terrific."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/01/13/laura.bush/ Laura Bush: Rice in '08?]. CNN.com. 17 Jan 2006</ref>  Mrs. Bush then turned to advocacy during an interview on CNN's ''[[Larry King Live]]'' on [[March 24]], 2006, in which she stated that Dr. Rice would make an "excellent president", and that she wished Americans could "talk her into running."<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0603/24/lkl.01.html/ Larry King Live: Interview with Laura Bush; Panel Discussion on Heart Disease].

Rice has frequently been mentioned as a possible opponent of [[Hillary Clinton]] in the 2008 election, as is the subject of the book ''Condi vs. Hillary: The Next Great Presidential Race'', by political strategist [[Dick Morris]] and his wife, Eileen McGann-Morris. 

Even in spite of Rice's denials of any presidential aspirations, many recent polls show her as the number one or number two most desired Republican nominee, including prominent ones like [http://www.maristpoll.marist.edu/ Marist], [http://www.rasmussenreports.com/2005/Republicans%202008.htm/ Rasmussen], and [http://www.zogby.com/ Zogby].  In fact, a [http://www.pollingreport.com/2008.htm Zogby America poll] from December 2005 showed Rice defeating Democratic potentials Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and [[Mark Warner]].  However, a later  [http://www.pollingreport.com/2008.htm WNBC/Marist poll]from February 2006 showed Rice losing to both Clinton and [[John Edwards]], while still defeating Kerry.  Also in February 2006, [http://www.thewhitehouseproject.org TheWhiteHouseProject.org] named Condoleezza Rice one of its "8 for '08", a group of eight women who they think could possibly run and/or be elected president in 2008.

Rice has publicly expressed aspirations to become the next [[commissioner]] of the [[National Football League]] and following the announcement of [[Paul Tagliabue]]'s retirement, she was widely believed to be a serious contender for the post.  If appointed to the office, she would have been both the first African American and the first female commissioner of any North American [[major sports league]]. However, Rice, a [[Cleveland Browns]] fan, declined to take the post, stating that she preferred to remain as Secretary of State.<ref>AP.

[[California]] Democratic Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] has also criticised Rice in relation to the [[war in Iraq]]: "I personally believe &mdash; this is my personal view &mdash; that your loyalty to the mission you were given, to sell the war, overwhelmed your respect for the truth."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27818-2005Jan21.html Why the Crass Remarks About Rice?]. [[The Washington Post]], [[January 22]], [[2005]].</ref> On [[January 11]], [[2007]] Boxer in a debate over the [[war in Iraq]] said, "Now, the issue is who pays the price, who pays the price? I’m not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old, and my grandchild is too young. You’re not going to pay a particular price, as I understand it, within immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families, and I just want to bring us back to that fact.” The [[New York Post]] and [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Tony Snow]] considered this an attack on Rice's staus as a single, childless female and referred to Boxer's comments as "''a great leap backward for feminism.''"<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,243359,00.html White House Spokesman Blasts Sen.

===Racial criticisms===
[[Image:RiceRatings.png|thumb|right|Rice's [[approval rating]]s from January 2005 to the present.  Rice's ratings saw decreases following a heated battle for her confirmation as Secretary of State and following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in August 2005.  Her ratings saw increases after her first tour of Europe and the [[Middle East]] in February 2005, her brokering of the Gaza Border-Opening Deal in November 2005, and her involvement in ending the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]].]]Rice's rise within the [[George W. Bush administration]] initially drew a largely positive response from many in the [[African American]] community. In a 2002 survey, then National Security Advisor Rice was viewed favorably by 41% of African American respondents, but another 40% did not know Rice well enough to rate her and her profile remained comparatively obscure.<ref name=Tilove>Jonathon Tilove. [http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/tilove031104.html For Black America, The Thrill of Powell and Rice Is Gone].  Newhouse News Service, [[March 11]], [[2004]].</ref> As her role increased, some African American commentators began to express doubts concerning Rice's stances and statements on various issues. In 2005, ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Eugene Robinson]] asked, "How did [Rice] come to a worldview so radically different from that of most black Americans?"<ref>Eugene Robinson. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/24/AR2005102401370.html What Rice Can't See]. [[The Washington Post]], [[October 25]], [[2005]].</ref> 

Other writers have also noted what they perceive to be a distance between Rice and the black community. ''[[The Black Commentator]]'' magazine described sentiments given in a speech by Rice at a black gathering as "more than strange – they were evidence of profound personal disorientation. A black woman who doesn’t know how to talk to black people is of limited political use to an administration that has few African American allies."<ref>[http://www.blackcommentator.com/84/84_cover_condi.html Condoleezza's Crimes].  [[The Black Commentator]], [[April 1]]], [[2004]].</ref> When Rice invoked the [[civil rights movement]] to clarify her position on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], Margaret Kimberley, another writer for ''The Black Commentator'', felt that her use of the rhetoric was "offensive". Stan Correy, an interviewer from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], characterized many African Americans involved with civil rights and politics as viewing this rhetoric as "cynical".<ref>Stan Correy. [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s1338813.htm Condoleezza, Condoleezza].  ABC Radio National, [[April 3]], [[2005]].</ref> Rice was also described by [[Bill Fletcher, Jr.]], the former leader of the [[TransAfrica Forum]], a [[foreign policy]] [[lobbying]] organization in [[District of Columbia|Washington, D.C.]], as "very cold and distant and only black by accident."<ref name=Tilove /> In August 2005, American [[musician]], [[actor]], and [[social activist]] [[Harry Belafonte]], who serves on the Board of TransAfrica, referred to African Americans in the Bush administration as "black tyrants".<ref>Marc Merano.

Cybercast News Service, [[August 8]], [[2005]]</ref> Belafonte's comments received mixed reactions.<ref name=Tilove /> 

Rice has defended herself from such criticisms on several occasions.  During a [[September 14]], 2005 interview, she said: "Why would I worry about something like that? ... The fact of the matter is I've been black all my life. Nobody needs to tell me how to be black."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/53155.htm Interview With Bill O'Reilly of the O'Reilly Factor on Fox News]. [[September 14]], [[2005]].</ref>
