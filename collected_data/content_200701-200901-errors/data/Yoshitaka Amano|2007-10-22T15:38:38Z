==Biography==
===Animation===
Amano was born in [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka City]], [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], [[Japan]]; as a young adolescent, he was fascinated with [[drawing]]. In 1967, he began working for [[Tatsunoko Productions]] in the [[animation]] department, where he was introduced to the early Japanese [[anime]] movement.<ref>[http://www.ex.org/4.7/04-feature_amano1.html ex.org interview.] Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref><ref>[http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q3-2002/081302c.html RPGamer interview.] Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref> His first paid project was for the [[Speed Racer]] anime franchise (also known as Mach GoGoGo). He worked in [[character design]] for anime shows such as the [[Time Bokan]] series, the ''[[Gatchaman]]'' series, [[Tekkaman]] and the ''Honey Bee''.<ref name="HC">[http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3152237 1UP.com A Day in the Life of Yoshitaka Amano.] Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref>

In the 1960s, Amano was exposed to Western art styles through [[comic books]] and their Japanese Western-influenced counter parts. Amano was also fascinated by the art styles of psychedelic art and pop art of the West, particularly the work of American Pop artist [[Peter Max]].<ref name="HK">Amano: The Complete Prints of Yoshitaka Amano Collins Design November 4 (2003) by Unno Hiroshi ISBN 0-06-056763-5. Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref> In the 1970s, Amano's intrigue led him to the study of the artworks of the late 19th century and early 20th century European movement of [[Art Nouveau]], as well as the ancient Japanese hand woodblock printing work of [[Ukiyo-e]]. While concentrating on [[illustration]], he was still at Tatsunoko Productions until he left in 1982.<ref name="HK"/>

===Early fantasy works===
In the early 1980s, he concentrated on illustrations for [[Science Fiction]] and [[Fantasy]], while still keeping the influence of his animation and other illustration works from the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name="HC"/> This in turn created a unique personal style, which was influenced by both modern surrealism as well as realism fluent in many classic and modern techniques.

In 1983, he was behind the illustrations for the novel [[Demon City Shinjuku]] and the first of [[Hideyuki Kikuchi]]'s novel series ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]''.<ref name="HC"/> This was adapted to a movie in 1985 for which Amano worked as character designer. The film was one of the first anime movies to be released outside of Japan. In interviews, however, Amano has stated that he was not pleased with the final product of the movie. More involvement in illustration had led to the creation of collections of his artwork being published, such as "Maten" in 1984.<ref>[http://www.amanosworld.com/html/biblio/bib1.html Amano's World The Art of Yoshitaka Amano English Website Bibliography of "Maten".] Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref>

===Final Fantasy===
In 1987, he was introduced to a newly developed art department with a promising future for conceptual design for [[video games]]. He joined [[Square Co.|Square]] (now known as [[Square Enix]]) to work on what was expected to be their last video game for the [[Famicom]] ([[Nintendo Entertainment System]]): ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' (released on [[December 18]], [[1987]] in Japan). This task opened a new realm for Amano to work in. Even though video game technology was very young, Amano produced striking pieces of conceptual design for the games in both traditional and computer designed artwork<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/ZDM/story?id=2396111 ABC News The Genius Behind Final Fantasy.] Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref>. Final Fantasy, the first in a continuing series, was a success and brought Square popularity in the RPG genre in Japan, as well as modest international fame. But the series would ignite extreme international fame as the series continued. At this time, he also worked for another video game company called [[Kure Software Koubou]] in which he did box cover illustrations as well as some character designs. This included work on Kure's First Queen series, which, despite being fairly unknown overseas, is regarded a classic in Japan.

===Branching out===
In 1989, he had his first [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] called "Hiten" at [[Yurakucho Mullion]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan.<ref>[http://www.amanosworld.com/html/exhibitions.html Amano's World The Art of Yoshitaka Amano English Website Exhibitions.] Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref> He continued to work with Square and their Final Fantasy series, and in 1990 he started to work as an artist for stage theater. His first work for theater was Tamasaburo Bando's Nayotake, which was in the same year.<ref name="HK"/> During this time while working as illustrator, character designer and set designer, he had exhibitions of his becoming well known for his printing works.
[[Image:Ff6 magitek.jpg|thumb|right|Yoshitaka Amano designed the characters for the first six ''Final Fantasy'' games, as well as providing some [[conceptual art]]work for ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''Final Fantasy IX''. The above is a depiction of [[Terra Branford|Terra]] riding a suit of Magitek Armor from Final Fantasy VI, who he has said was his favorite character to design.<ref>[http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=4&cId=3152237 "A Day in the Life of Final Fantasy's Yoshitaka Amano".] Retrieved on 2007-5-29.</ref> ]]

In 1994, after ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'', he was no longer the main character, image and graphic designer of the series (he started to provide promotional and character artwork for the next games, as well as working on the title logo designs for most of the games), but in 1995 he started to become better known world wide with his work at the [[Biennale d'Orléans]] in [[France]], and then in his newly established workshop and exhibition "Think Like Amano" in [[New York]] in 1997<ref>[http://www.amanosworld.com/html/shows/thinklike.html Amano's World The Art of Yoshitaka Amano English Website "Think Like Amano Exhibition".] Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref>, which followed another exhibition in New York at the [[Angel Orensanz Foundation]] entitled "Hero"<ref>[http://www.amanosworld.com/html/shows/hero.html Amano's World The Art of Yoshitaka Amano English Website "HERO Exhibition".] Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref>.

===Freelancing===
In 2000, Amano did the illustrations for comic writer and [[novelist]] [[Neil Gaiman]] on [[Sandman: The Dream Hunters]]<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/1999/books/reviews/12/23/sandman/ CNN Review "A dark tale 'of enduring charm".] Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref> which won several awards and was nominated for a [[Hugo Award]]<ref>[http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=156389629x Powells.com Bibliography "The Sandman: The Dream Hunters".] Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref>, as well as having his character designs used again in another Vampire Hunter D movie entitled [[Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust]]. In 2001, [[Greg Rucka]] and Amano collaborated with another comic book tale, this time for [[Marvel Comics]], [[Elektra and Wolverine: The Redeemer]]<ref>[http://www.cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0&this_cat=Comics&action=page&type_id=&cat_id=&obj_id=31718 Cinescape Comics Book Review Elektra and Wolverine: The Redeemer.] Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref>.
[[Image:Amanoprints.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Amano's art is displayed most prominently in his prints, which are drawn from various styles and cultures]]
In 2006, he was selected with Final Fantasy video game composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], by former designer and creator of [[Square-Enix]]'s [[Final Fantasy series]], [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] to work on video games at his company [[Mistwalker]]<ref>[http://www.animenewsservice.com/archives/amano.htm ANS Exclusive Interview: 10 Questions To Yoshitaka Amano.] Retrieved on 2006-5-9.</ref>.
