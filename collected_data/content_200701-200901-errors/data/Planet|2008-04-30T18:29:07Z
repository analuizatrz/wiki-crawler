A '''planet''', as [[2006 definition of planet|defined]] by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) for the Solar System, is a  body that [[orbit]]s the [[Sun]], is massive enough to be rounded by its own [[gravity]], and has [[cleared the neighbourhood|cleared its neighbouring region]] of [[planetesimal]]s.<ref name=IAU>{{ cite web|title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes|url=http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html|publisher=International Astronomical Union|year=2006|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref><ref name=WSGESP>{{cite web|year=2001|title=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets (WGESP) of the International Astronomical Union| work=IAU|url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html|accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref> No formal definition has been made for extrasolar planets.

The term ''planet'' is an ancient one having ties to history, science, myth, and religion. The planets were originally seen as a divine presence; as emissaries of the gods. Even today, many people continue to believe the [[astrology|movement of the planets affects their lives]], although such a causation is [[Astrology and astronomy#Historical divergence|rejected by the scientific community]]. As scientific knowledge advanced, the human perception of the planets changed over time, incorporating a number of disparate objects. Even now there is no uncontested definition of what a planet is. In 2006, the IAU officially adopted a resolution [[2006 definition of planet|defining planets]] within the [[Solar System]]. This definition has been both praised and criticized, and remains disputed by some scientists. 

The planets were initially thought to orbit the Earth in circular motions; after  the development of the telescope, the planets were determined to orbit the Sun, and their orbits were found to be elliptical. As observational tools improved, [[astronomer]]s saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes and some share such features as ice-caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the [[Space Age]], close observation by probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics and even hydrology. Since 1992, through the discovery of hundreds of [[extrasolar planet]]s (planets around other stars), scientists are beginning to observe similar features throughout the [[Milky Way|Milky Way Galaxy]]. 

Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]) and 277 known extrasolar ones.<ref name="Encyclopaedia">{{cite web |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |last=Schneider |first=Jean |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2006-10-31}}</ref> The Solar System also contains at least three [[dwarf planet]]s ([[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Pluto]], and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]). Many of these planets are orbited by one or more [[natural satellite|moons]], which can be larger than small planets. Planets are generally divided into two main types: large, low-density [[gas giant]]s and smaller, rocky [[terrestrial planet|terrestrials]].

==History==
{{main|History of astronomy|Definition of planet}}

The idea of planets has evolved over its history, from the divine [[wandering stars]] of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific age. The concept has also now expanded to include worlds not only in our Solar System, but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems. The ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy.

In ancient times, astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky in relation to the other stars.

By the first century BC, the Greeks had begun to develop their own mathematical schemes for predicting the positions of the planets. These schemes, which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians, would eventually eclipse the Babylonians' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness and account for much of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye. These theories would reach their fullest expression in the ''[[Almagest]]'' written by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century AD. So complete was the domination of Ptolemy's model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the definitive astronomical text in the Western world for 13 centuries.<ref name=almagest /><ref name= practice />

To the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets; each presumed to be [[Geocentric model|circling the Earth]] according to the complex laws laid out by Ptolemy.

===Modern times===
{{seealso|Heliocentrism}}

The five [[naked-eye planet]]s have been known since ancient times, and have had a significant impact on [[mythology]], [[religious cosmology]], and ancient [[astronomy]]. As scientific knowledge progressed, however, understanding of the term "planet" changed from something that moved across the sky (in relation to the [[fixed stars|star field]]); to a body that orbited the Earth (or that were believed to do so at the time); and in the 16th century to something that directly orbited the Sun when the [[heliocentric model]] of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] gained sway.

[[Image:geoz wb en.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Heliocentrism (lower panel) in comparison to the geocentric model (upper panel)]]

Thus the Earth became included in the list of planets,<ref name=galileo_project/> while the Sun and Moon were excluded. At first, when the first satellites of Saturn were discovered at the end of the 17th century, the terms "planet" and "satellite" were used interchangeably &ndash; although the latter would gradually become more prevalent in the following century.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Cassini | first=Signor  | title=''A Discovery of two'' New Planets ''about'' Saturn, ''made in the Royal Parisian Observatory by Signor'' Cassini, ''Fellow of both the Royal Societys, of'' England ''and'' France; ''English't out of French.'' | journal=Philosophical Transactions (1665&ndash;1678) | year=1673 | volume=8 | pages=5178&ndash;85}} ''Note: This journal became the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1775. There may just be earlier publications within the ''[[Journal des sçavans]].''</ref> Until the mid-19th century, the number of "planets" rose rapidly since any newly discovered object directly orbiting the Sun was listed as a planet by the scientific community.

In the 19th century astronomers began to realize that recently discovered bodies that had been classified as planets for almost half a century (such as Ceres, [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]), were very different from the traditional one. These bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter (the [[Asteroid belt]]), and had a much smaller mass; as a result they were reclassified as "[[asteroid]]s". In the absence of any formal definition, a "planet" came to be understood as any "large" body that orbited the Sun. Since there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets, and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was no apparent need to have a formal definition.<ref>{{cite web | last =Hilton | first =James L. | date = 2001-09-17 | url =http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/AsteroidHistory/minorplanets.html | title =When Did the Asteroids Become Minor Planets? | publisher =U.

However, in the 20th century, [[Pluto]] was discovered. After initial observations led to the belief it was larger than Earth,<ref>{{cite book | title = Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems | first = K.|last=Croswell | publisher = The Free Press | year = 1997 | pages = 57 | id = ISBN 978-0684832524}}</ref> the object was immediately accepted as the ninth planet. Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller: in 1936, [[Raymond Lyttleton]] suggested that Pluto may be an escaped satellite of [[Neptune]],<ref>{{cite journal | last=Lyttleton | first=Raymond A. | year=1936 | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=97 | pages=108 | title= On the possible results of an encounter of Pluto with the Neptunian system | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1936MNRAS..97..108L }}</ref> and [[Fred Lawrence Whipple|Fred Whipple]] suggested in 1964 that Pluto may be a comet.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=52 | pages=565&ndash;594 | last=Whipple | first=Fred | year=1964 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1964PNAS...52..565W | title= The History of the Solar System}}</ref> However, as it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population,<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Scientific American | year=1996 | month=May | pages=46&ndash;52 | last=Luu | first=Jane X. | coauthors=Jewitt, David C. | title=The Kuiper Belt | volume=274 | issue=5}}</ref> it kept its status until 2006.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a flood of discoveries of similar objects in the same region of the Solar System (the [[Kuiper belt]]). Like Ceres and the asteroids before it, Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands. A growing number of astronomers argued for it to be declassified as a planet, since many similar objects approaching its size were found. The discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a more massive object widely publicised as the "[[tenth planet]]", brought things to a head. The IAU set about creating the [[definition of planet]], and eventually produced one in 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had [[Cleared the neighbourhood|cleared their orbit]] (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus & Neptune), and a new class of [[dwarf planet]]s was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris).<ref>{{cite paper | last=Green | first=D.

The discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in defining a planet; the point at which a planet becomes a star. Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar objects known as "[[brown dwarf]]s".<ref>{{cite web| year=2006 | title=IAU General Assembly: Definition of Planet debate| url=http://astro2006.meta.mediastream.cz/Astro2006-060822-01.asx | format=.wmv | publisher=MediaStream.cz | accessdate=2006-09-24}} </ref> Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse [[deuterium]], a heavier isotope of [[hydrogen]]. While stars more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen, stars of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium. However, deuterium is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Basri | first=Gibor | title= Observations of Brown Dwarfs | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics | year=2000 | volume=38 | pages=485 | doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.38.1.485}}</ref>

As large [[Kuiper belt]] and scattered disc objects were discovered in the late 1990s and early years of the twenty-first century, a number including [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]], [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]] and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] were heralded in the popular press as the 'tenth planet', however none of these received widespread scientific recognition as such, although [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] has now been classified as a [[Dwarf Planet]].

===Modern definition===<!-- maybe: Rigurous definition -->
{{main|2006 definition of planet}}
With the discovery during the latter half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There was particular disagreement over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a [[Asteroid belt|belt]], or if it was large enough to generate energy by the [[thermonuclear fusion]] of [[deuterium]]. 

In 2003, The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) Working Group on Extrasolar Planets made a position statement on the definition of a planet that incorporated a working definition:<ref name=WSGESP>{{cite web | year=2001 | work=IAU | title=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets (WGESP) of the International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html | accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref>

This matter was finally addressed during the 2006 meeting of the [[International Astronomical Union#The XXVIth General Assembly and the definition of a planet|IAU's General Assembly]]. After much debate and one failed proposal, the assembly voted to pass a resolution that [[2006 definition of planet|defined planets within the Solar System]] as<ref name=IAU>{{cite web | author=Staff | year=2006 | url =http://www.iau.org/iau0603.414.0.html | title =IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU resolution votes | publisher =IAU | accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}</ref>:

Under this definition, the Solar System is considered to have eight planets. Bodies which fulfill the first two conditions but not the third (such as Pluto and Eris) are classified as [[dwarf planet]]s, providing they are not also [[natural satellite]]s of other planets.

This definition is based in modern theories of planetary formation, in which planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other smaller objects.

Beyond the scientific community, Pluto has held a strong cultural significance for many in the general public considering its planetary status during most of the 20th century &ndash; similarly to Ceres and its kin in the 1800s. The discovery of Eris was widely reported in the [[mass media|media]] as the "[[tenth planet]]" and therefore the reclassification of all three objects as dwarf planets has attracted a lot of media and public attention.<ref>{{cite news | first=Clara | last=Moskowitz | title=Scientist who found '10th planet' discusses downgrading of Pluto | publisher=Stanford news | date=2006-10-18 | url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2006/october18/mbrown-101806.html | accessdate=2007-05-11 }}</ref>

==Mythology==
{{seealso|Days of the week|Naked-eye planet}}
[[Image:Olympians.jpg|thumb|left|220 px|The gods of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], after whom the Solar System's planets are named]]

The names for the planets in the Western world are derived from the  naming practices of the Romans, which ultimately derive from those of the Greeks and the Babylonians. In [[ancient Greece]], the two great luminaries the Sun and the Moon were called ''[[Helios]]'' and ''[[Selene]]'';  the farthest planet was called ''Phainon'', the shiner; followed by ''Phaethon'', "bright"; the red planet  was known as ''Pyroeis'', the "fiery"; the brightest was known as ''Phosphoros'', the light bringer; and the fleeting final planet was called ''Stilbon'', the gleamer. The Greeks also made each planet sacred to one of their pantheon of gods, the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]]: Helios and Selene were the names of both planets and gods; Phainon was sacred to ''[[Cronus|Kronos]]'', the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who fathered the Olympians; Phaethon was sacred to ''[[Zeus|Zeús]]'', Kronos's son who deposed him as king; Pyroeis was given  to ''[[Ares]]'', son of Zeus and god of war; Phosphorus was ruled by ''[[Aphrodite]]'', the goddess of love; and ''[[Hermes]]'', messenger of the gods and god of learning and wit, ruled over Stilbon.<ref name=practice>{{cite web|title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy|first=James|last=Evans|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|pages=296&ndash;7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=babylon+greek+astronomy&source=web&ots=c1afKhoAt6&sig=A4cDSCcvWmd6B9e9YPZ9T1I91GM#PPA15,M1
|accessdate=2008-02-04}}</ref> 

The Greek practice of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets was  almost certainly borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians named Phosphorus after their goddess of love, ''[[Ishtar]]''; Pyroeis after their god of war, ''[[Nergal]]'', Stilbon after their god of wisdom [[Nabu]], and Phaethon after their chief god, ''[[Marduk]]''.<ref name= nergal>{{cite web|first=Kelley L.|last=Ross|year=2005|title=The Days of the Week|url=http://www.friesian.com/week.htm|publisher=The Friesian School|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref> There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately.<ref name=practice /> The translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. However, unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.<ref>{{cite book|title=Martian Metamorphoses: The Planet Mars in Ancient Myth and Tradition|first=Ev|last=Cochrane|year=1997|publisher=Aeon Press|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=jz3eqRGuM0wC&oi=fnd&pg=PP9&dq=ares+nergal+planet+pestilence&ots=oFtmQnyNtC&sig=iXrJjw-K4YFAGxff5_WV7yCZp0E#PPP8,M1|accessdate=2008-02-07 | isbn=0965622908}}</ref> 

Today, most people in the western world know the planets by names derived from the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian pantheon of gods]]. While modern Greeks still use their ancient names for the planets, other European languages, because of the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and, later, the [[Catholic Church]], use the Roman (or Latin) names rather than the Greek ones. The Romans, who, like the Greeks, were [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-Europeans]], shared with them a [[Roman mythology|common pantheon]] under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic culture had given [[Greek mythology|their gods]]. During the later period of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon, to the point where they became virtually indistinguishable.<ref>{{cite book|title=Greek Mythography in the Roman World|first=Alan|last=Cameron|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0195171217}}</ref> When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, they gave the planets their own gods' names: ''[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]]'' (for Hermes), ''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]'' (Aphrodite), ''[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]'' (Ares), ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Iuppiter]]'' (Zeus) and ''[[Saturn (mythology)|Saturnus]]'' (Kronos).  When subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was retained: ''Uranus'' (''[[Uranus (mythology)|Ouranos]]'') and ''[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptūnus]]'' (''[[Poseidon]]'').

Non-European cultures use other planetary naming systems. India uses a naming system based on the [[Navagraha]], which incorporates the seven traditional planets ([[Surya]] for the Sun, [[Chandra]] for the Moon, and [[Budha]], [[Shukra]], [[Mangala]], [[Bṛhaspati|{{IAST|Bṛhaspati}}]] and [[Shani]] for the traditional planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) and the ascending and descending [[lunar node]]s [[Rahu]] and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]. [[China]] and the countries of eastern Asia influenced by it (such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]) use a naming system based on the [[Wu Xing|five Chinese elements]]: ''[[Water (classical element)|water]]'' (Mercury), ''[[Metal (classical element)|metal]]'' (Venus), ''[[Fire (classical element)|fire]]'' (Mars), ''[[Wood (classical element)|wood]]'' (Jupiter) and ''[[Earth (classical element)|earth]]'' (Saturn).<ref name="weekdays"/>

==Formation==
{{main|Planetary formation}}
It is not known with certainty how planets are formed. The prevailing theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a [[nebula]] into a thin disk of gas and dust. A [[protostar]] forms at the core, surrounded by a rotating [[protoplanetary disk]]. Through [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] (a process of sticky collision) dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies. Local concentrations of mass known as [[planetesimal]]s form, and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction. These concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity to form [[protoplanet]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | first=G. W. | last=Wetherill | title=Formation of the Terrestrial Planets | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics | year=1980 | volume=18 | pages=77&ndash;113 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980ARA&A..18...77W | accessdate=2007-07-23 }}</ref> After a planet reaches a diameter larger than the Earth's moon, it begins to accumulate an extended atmosphere, greatly increasing the capture rate of the planetesimals by means of [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Inaba, S.; Ikoma, M. | title=Enhanced Collisional Growth of a Protoplanet that has an Atmosphere | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics | year=2003 | volume=410 | pages=711&ndash;723 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003A&A...410..711I | accessdate = 2007-07-23  | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20031248 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>

With the discovery and observation of [[planetary system]]s around stars other than our own, it is becoming possible to elaborate, revise or even replace this account. The level of [[metallicity]] &ndash; an astronomical term describing the abundance of [[chemical element]]s with an [[atomic number]] greater than 2 ([[helium]]) &ndash; is now believed to determine the likelihood that a star will have planets.<ref>{{cite news | author=Aguilar, D.; Pulliam, C. | date = 2004-01-06 | url = http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/press/pr0404.html | title = Lifeless Suns Dominated The Early Universe | publisher = Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (Press release) | accessdate = 2006-08-26 }}</ref> Hence it is thought less likely that a metal-poor, [[population II star]] will possess a more substantial planetary system than a metal-rich [[population I star]].

{{main|Table of planets and dwarf planets in the Solar System}}
According to the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s current definitions, there are eight planets in the [[Solar System]]. In increasing distance from the [[Sun]], they are:

# [[Image:Mercury symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|☿}}]] '''[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'''
# [[Image:Venus symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|♀}}]] '''[[Venus]]'''
# [[Image:Earth symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|⊕}}]] '''[[Earth]]'''

# [[Image:Neptune symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|♆}}]] '''[[Neptune]]'''
                               
Jupiter is the largest, at 318 Earth masses, while Mercury is smallest, at 0.055 Earth masses.
                                                                
The planets of the Solar System can be divided into categories based on their composition:
* '''[[Terrestrial planet|Terrestrial]]s''': Planets that are similar to Earth, with bodies largely composed of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. 
* '''[[Gas giant]]s''': Planets with a composition largely made up of [[gas]]eous material and are significantly more massive than terrestrials: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. [[Ice giant]]s, comprising Uranus and Neptune, are a sub-class of gas giants, distinguished from gas giants by their significantly lower mass, and by depletion in hydrogen and helium in their atmospheres together with a significantly higher proportion of rock and ice.

===Dwarf planets===
{{main|Dwarf planet}}

Before the [[2006 definition of planet|August 2006 decision]], several objects were proposed by astronomers, including at one stage by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]], as planets. However in 2006 several of these objects were reclassified as dwarf planets, objects distinct from planets. Currently three dwarf planets in the Solar System are recognized by the IAU: Ceres, Pluto and Eris. Several other objects in both the [[Asteroid belt]] and the [[Kuiper belt]] are under consideration, with as many as 50 that could eventually qualify. There may be as many as 200 that could be discovered once the Kuiper belt has been fully explored. Dwarf planets share many of the same characteristics as planets, although notable differences remain &ndash; namely that they are not [[clearing the neighbourhood|dominant in their orbits]]. Their attributes are:

By definition, all dwarf planets are members of larger [[population]]s. Ceres is the largest body in the [[asteroid belt]], while Pluto is a member of the Kuiper belt and Eris is a member of the [[scattered disc]]. Scientists such as [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] believe that there may soon be over forty [[trans-Neptunian objects]] that qualify as dwarf planets under the IAU's recent definition.<ref>{{cite web | first=Brad | last=Amburn | title=Behind the Pluto Mission: An Interview with Project Leader Alan Stern | work=Space.com | date=2006-02-28 | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060228_stern_interview.html | accessdate=2006-11-01 }}</ref>

==Extrasolar planets==

The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star  occurred on [[6 October]] [[1995]], when [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]] of the [[University of Geneva]] announced the detection of an exoplanet around [[51 Pegasi]].

It is far from clear if the newly discovered large planets would resemble the gas giants in the Solar System or if they are of an entirely different type as yet unknown, like ammonia giants or [[carbon planet]]s. In particular, some of the newly-discovered planets, known as [[hot Jupiter]]s, orbit extremely close to their parent stars, in nearly circular orbits. They therefore receive much more [[solar radiation|stellar radiation]] than the gas giants in the Solar System, which makes it questionable whether they are the same type of planet at all. There may also exist a class of hot Jupiters, called [[Chthonian planet]]s, that orbit so close to their star that their atmospheres have been blown away completely by stellar radiation. While many hot Jupiters have been found in the process of losing their atmospheres, as of 2008, no genuine cthonian planets have been discovered.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Lecavelier des Etangs|first=A.|coauthors=Vidal-Madjar, A.; McConnell, J.

More detailed observation of extrasolar planets will require a new generation of instruments, including [[space telescope]]s. Currently the [[COROT]] spacecraft is searching for stellar luminosity variations due to [[Astronomical transit|transiting planets]]. Several projects have also been proposed to create an array of [[space telescope]]s to search for extrasolar planets with masses comparable to the Earth. These include the proposed NASA's [[Kepler Mission]], [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]], and [[Space Interferometry Mission]] programs, the [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Darwin Mission|Darwin]], and the CNES' [[PEGASE]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spacetoday.org/DeepSpace/Stars/Planets/PlanetFindingMissions.html | title =Future American and European Planet Finding Missions | publisher = Space Today Online | editor = Anthony R.

==Interstellar "planets"==

In 2005, astronomers announced the discovery of [[Cha 110913-773444]], the smallest brown dwarf found to date, at only seven times Jupiter's mass.

==Attributes==<!-- This section is linked from [[Earth radius]] -->
Although each planet has unique physical characteristics, a number of broad commonalities do exist between them. Some of these characteristics, such as rings or natural satellites, have only as yet been observed in planets in the Solar System, whilst others are also common to extrasolar planets. 

===Dynamic characteristics===
{{seealso|Kepler's laws of planetary motion}}
====Orbit====
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt Orbits Pluto Ecliptic.svg|thumb|250 px|right|The orbit of the planet Neptune compared to that of [[Pluto]]. Note the elongation of Pluto's orbit in relation to Neptune's ([[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]), as well as its large angle to the ecliptic ([[inclination]]).]]
All planets revolve around stars. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit in the same direction as the Sun rotates. It is not yet known whether all extrasolar planets follow this pattern. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its [[sidereal period]] or ''[[year]]''.<ref name="young">{{cite book  | first=Charles Augustus | last=Young | year=1902 | title=Manual of Astronomy: A Text Book | publisher=Ginn & company | pages=324&ndash;7 }}</ref> A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, as it is less affected by the star's [[gravity]]. Because no planet's orbit is perfectly circular, the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its [[periastron]] ([[perihelion]] in the Solar System), while its farthest separation from the star is called its [[apastron]] ([[aphelion]]). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as the pull of its star's gravity strengthens; as it reaches apastron, its speed decreases.<ref>{{cite book | author=Dvorak, R.; Kurths, J.; Freistetter, F. | year=2005 | title=Chaos And Stability in Planetary Systems | publisher=Springer | location=New York | isbn=3540282084 }}</ref>

Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of [[orbital elements|elements]]:

*The ''[[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]'' of an orbit describes how elongated a planet's orbit is. Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits, while planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits. The planets in our Solar System have very low eccentricities, and thus nearly circular orbits.<ref name="young"/> Comets and Kuiper belt objects (as well as several extrasolar planets) have very high eccentricities, and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Eccentricity evolution of giant planet orbits due to circumstellar disk torques|author=Moorhead, Althea V.; Adams, Fred C. | journal=Icarus | year=2008 | volume=193 | pages=475 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.07.009 | id={{arxiv|0708.0335}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Planets - Kuiper Belt Objects|work=The Astrophysics Spectator|date=2004-12-15| url=http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/planets/KuiperBelt.html|accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref>

[[Image:Semimajoraxis.png|thumb|200 px|Illustration of the semi-major axis]]
*The ''[[semi-major axis]]'' is the distance from a planet to the half-way point along the longest diameter of its elliptical orbit (see image). This distance is not the same as its apasteron, as no planet's orbit has its star at its exact centre.<ref name="young"/>

*The ''[[inclination]]'' of a planet tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies. In our Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the [[ecliptic]]. For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the ''sky plane'' or ''plane  of the sky'', is the plane of the observer's line of sight from Earth.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/~tatum/celmechs.html|title=Celestial Mechanics | year=2007 | chapter=17. Visual binary stars | first=J. B. | last=Tatum|accessdate=2008-02-02 | publisher=Personal web page}}</ref> The eight planets of our Solar System all lie very close to the ecliptic; comets and [[Kuiper belt object]]s like [[Pluto]] are at far more extreme angles to it.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A Correlation between Inclination and Color in the Classical Kuiper Belt| last=Trujillo | first=Chadwick A. | coauthors= Brown, Michael E. | journal=Astrophysical Journal | year=2002 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...566L.125T| volume=566| pages=L125 | doi=10.1086/339437}}</ref> The points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference plane are called its [[ascending node|ascending]] and [[descending node]]s.<ref name="young"/> The [[longitude of the ascending node]] is the angle between the reference plane's 0 longitude and the planet's ascending node. The [[argument of periapsis]] (or perihelion in our Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.<ref name="young"/>

[[Image:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|left|190px|Earth's axial tilt is about 23°.]]

====Axial tilt====
Planets also have varying degrees of [[axial tilt]]; they lie at an angle to the [[reference plane|plane]] of their [[inclination|stars' equators]]. This causes the amount of light received by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore possesses [[season]]s; changes to the climate over the course of its year. The point at which each hemisphere is farthest or nearest from its star is known as its [[solstice]]. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices.<ref name=Weather>{{cite web | last=Harvey | first=Samantha | date=2006-05-01  | url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=725 | title=Weather, Weather, Everywhere? | publisher=NASA | accessdate=2007-09-09 }}</ref> Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are  not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to possess negligible to no axial tilt, as a result of their proximity to their stars.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obliquity Tides on Hot Jupiters|author=Winn, Joshua N.; Holman, Matthew J.|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|year=2005| doi=10.1086/432834| volume=628|pages=L159}}</ref>

====Rotation====
The planets also rotate around invisible axes through their centres. A planet's [[rotation period]] is known as its [[day]]. All planets in the Solar System rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, except for Venus, which [[Retrograde and direct motion|rotates clockwise]]<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rotation of Venus: Period Estimated from Radar Measurements|author=Goldstein, R. M.; Carpenter, R. L.|year=1963|journal =Science|volume=139|pages=910|doi=10.1126/science.139.3558.910}}</ref>  (Uranus is generally said to be rotating clockwise as well<ref>{{cite web|contribution=Rotational properties of Uranus and Neptune|first=M. J. S. | last=Belton | coauthors=Terrile R. J. | title=Uranus and Neptune | year=1984 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984urnp.nasa..327B | pages=327 | editor=Bergstralh, J. T. | accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> though because of its extreme axial tilt, it can be said to be rotating either clockwise or anti-clockwise, depending on whether one states it to be inclined 82° from the ecliptic in one direction, or 98° in the opposite direction).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Outer Worlds; Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Beyond|pages=195&ndash;206|year=2006|first=Michael P.|last=Borgia|publisher=Springer New York}}</ref> There is great variation in the length of day between the planets, with Venus taking 243 [[day|Earth days]] to rotate, and the gas giants only a few hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Planet tables|url=http://www.astronomynotes.com/tables/tablesb.htm|first=Nick|last=Strobel|publisher=astronomynotes.com|accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref> The rotational periods of extrasolar planets are not known; however their proximity to their stars means that hot Jupiters are [[Tidal locking|tidaly locked]] (their orbits are in sync with their rotations). This means they only ever show one face to their stars, with one side in perpetual day, the other in perpetual night.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Magnetically-Driven Planetary Radio Emissions and Application to Extrasolar Planets| last=Zarka | first=Philippe | coauthors=Treumann, Rudolf A.; Ryabov, Boris P.; Ryabov, Vladimir B. |year=2001|journal=Astrophysics & Space Science|volume=277|pages=293|doi = 10.1023/A:1012221527425}}</ref>

====Orbital clearance====
The defining dynamic characteristic of a planet is that it has [[Cleared the neighbourhood|cleared its neighborhood]]. A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the [[planetesimal]]s in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s official [[2006 definition of planet|definition of a planet]] in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as [[Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] from full-fledged planethood, making them instead [[dwarf planet]]s.<ref name=IAU /> Although to date this criterion only applies to our Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Total Number of Giant Planets in Debris Disks with Central Clearings|date=2007-07-12|author=Faber, Peter; Quillen, Alice C. |work=Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Rochester|year=2007|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1684|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>

===Physical characteristics===
====Mass====
A planet's defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the [[electromagnetic]] forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape,  but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dwarf Planets|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets/|authorlink=Michael E. Brown|last=Brown|first=Michael E.|work=California Institute of Technology|year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref>

Mass is also the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from [[star]]s. The upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times Jupiter's mass, beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for [[nuclear fusion]]. Other than the Sun, no objects of such mass exist in our Solar System; however a number of extrasolar planets lie at that threshold. The ''Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia'' lists several planets that are close to this limit: [[HD 38529]]c, [[AB Pictoris]]b, [[HD 162020]]b, and [[HD 13189]]b. A number of objects of higher mass are also listed, but since they lie above the fusion threshold, they would be better described as [[brown dwarf]]s.<ref name="Encyclopedia" />

The smallest known planet, excluding dwarf planets and satellites, is [[PSR B1257+12]] a, one of the first extrasolar planets discovered, which was found in 1992 in orbit around a [[pulsar]]. Its mass is roughly half that of the planet Mercury.<ref name="Encyclopedia" />

[[Image:Jupiter interior.png|150px|right|thumb|Illustration the interior of Jupiter, with a rocky core overlaid by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen]]

====Internal differentiation====
Every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a [[Planetary differentiation|differentiated]] interior consisting of a dense [[planetary core]] surrounded by a [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] which either is or was a [[fluid]]. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard [[Crust (geology)|crusts]],<ref name=terrestrial>{{cite web|title=Planetary Interiors|work=Department of Physics, University of Oregon|url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec16.html|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref>  but in the gas giants the mantle simply dissolves into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets possess cores of magnetic elements such as [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and mantles of [[silicate]]s. [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are believed to possess cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of [[metallic hydrogen]].<ref>{{cite book  | first=Linda T. | last=Elkins-Tanton | year=2006  | title=Jupiter and Saturn | publisher=Chelsea House  | location=New York | id=ISBN 0-8160-5196-8 }}</ref>  [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], which are smaller, possess rocky cores surrounded by mantles of [[water]], [[ammonia]], [[methane]] and other [[Ice#In planetary science|ices]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Podolak|first=M.|coauthors=Weizman, A.; Marley, M.|title=Comparative model of Uranus and Neptune|journal=Planet.

====Atmosphere====
[[Image:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|Earth's atmosphere]]
All of the Solar System planets have [[atmosphere]]s as their large masses mean gravity is strong enough to keep gaseous particles close to the surface.

Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying degrees of energy received from either the Sun or their interiors, leading to the formation of dynamic [[weather system]]s such as [[hurricane]]s, (on Earth), planet-wide [[dust storm]]s (on Mars), an Earth-sized [[Anticyclonic storm|anticyclone]] on Jupiter (called the [[Great Red Spot]]), and [[Great Dark Spot|holes in the atmosphere]] (on Neptune).<ref name=Weather /> At least one extrasolar planet, [[HD 189733 b]], has been claimed to possess such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.<ref name="knutson">{{cite journal | last=Knutson | first=Heather A. | coauthors=Charbonneau, David; Allen, Lori E.; Fortney, Jonathan J. | title=A map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b | journal=Nature | year=2007 | volume=447 | pages=183 | doi=10.1038/nature05782}} (Related [http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/press/2007/pr200713.html press release])</ref>

====Magnetosphere====
[[Image:Structure of the magnetosphere.svg|thumb|right|300px|Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere]]

One important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic [[magnetic moment]]s which in turn give rise to [[magnetosphere]]s. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of [[electrical conductivity|electrically conducting]] material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity around itself called [[magnetosphere]], which the solar wind can not penetrate. The size of the magnetosphere can be much larger than that of the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the [[ionosphere]] with the solar wind, which can not effectively protect the planet.<ref name=Kivelson2007/>

Of the eight planets in our Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a magnetic field.<ref name=Kivelson2007/> In addition, the moon of Jupiter [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] also has one. Of the magnetized planets Mercury has the weakest magnetic field, and is barely enough to deflect the [[solar wind]]. Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System. The magnetic fields of other giant planets are roughly similar in strength of that of Earth but their magnetic moments are significantly larger than the Earth's magnetic moment. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational [[Axis of rotation|axis]] and displaced from the centre of the planet.<ref name=Kivelson2007>{{cite book | last=Kivelson|first=Margaret Galland | coauthors=Bagenal, Fran | chapter=Planetary Magnetospheres|title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System | year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|editor= Lucyann Mcfadden, Paul Weissman, Torrence Johnson|isbn=9780120885893 | page=519}}</ref> 

In 2004, a team of astronomers in Hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star [[HD 179949]], which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent star. The team hypothesised that the planet's magnetosphere was transferring energy onto the star's surface increasing its already high 14,000 degree surface temperature by an additional 750 degrees.<ref>{{cite web | title=Magnetic planet|first=Amanda| last=Gefter| work=Astronomy | date=[[2004-01-17]] |url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&id=2090|accessdate=2008-01-29}}</ref>

===Secondary characteristics===
Planets in our Solar System possess orbital resonances in their own right. All except Mercury and Venus have [[natural satellite]]s, often called "moons."  Earth has one, and Mars has two, and the [[gas giant]]s have numerous moons in complex planetary systems. Many gas giant moons have similar features to the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets, and some have been studied for signs of life (especially [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]).<ref name=Grasset2000>{{cite journal | last= Grasset | first=O. | coauthors=Sotin C.; Deschamps F. | title = On the internal structure and dynamic of Titan|year = 2000 | journal = Planetary and Space Science | volume = 48| pages = 617&ndash;636|doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(00)00039-8}}</ref><ref name=Fortes2000>{{cite journal | journal = Icarus | volume= 146 | issue = 2 | pages = 444&ndash;452 | year=  2000 | doi = 10.1006/icar.2000.6400 | title =  Exobiological implications of a possible ammonia-water ocean inside Titan | author = Fortes, A.

The four gas giants are also orbited by [[planetary ring]]s of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny '[[moonlet]]s' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely known, they are believed to be the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's [[Roche limit]] and were torn apart by [[tidal force]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Molnar, L. A.; Dunn, D. E. | title=On the Formation of Planetary Rings | journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society | year=1996 | volume=28 | pages=77&ndash;115 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996DPS....28.1815M }}</ref><ref>{{cite book  | first=Encrenaz | last=Thérèse | year=2004 | title=The Solar System | edition=Third edition | pages=388&ndash;390 | publisher=Springer | isbn=3540002413 }}</ref>

No secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets. However the [[sub-brown dwarf]] [[Cha 110913-773444]], which has been described as a [[rogue planet]], is believed to be orbited by a tiny [[protoplanetary disc]].<ref name="clavin" />
