'''Fostat''' (also spelled '''Fustat'''; {{lang-ar|الفسطاط}}) was the first capital city of [[Egypt]] under [[Arab]] rule. It was built by [[Amr ibn al-As]] right after the Arab conquest of Egypt. It was later overtaken by [[Cairo]], which was built to the north of Fostat during the [[Fatimid]] reign. Fostat is now part of the 'Old Egypt' District in Cairo.
The City is Egypts First On-Nile Capital since the Pharoes, with Thebes and Memphis, after [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s invasion and conquest of Egypt [[Alexandria]] was Egypt's capital for hundreds of years. Fostat was named after the Arabic word Fustat (فسطاط) which means tent, the story of the establishment of the city comes that Amr Ibn Al-As has decided to build a capital city for Egypt where his tent was, and thus the name was found.

It is featured in [[Amitav Ghosh]]'s ''In an Antique Land''. You can also get information about Misr al-Fustat in Janet Abu-Lughod's 1998 book, ''Cairo, The City Victorious''.
