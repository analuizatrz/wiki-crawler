'''Alvin John Paddock''' (born [[June 9]], [[1954]] in [[Oak River, Manitoba|Oak River]], [[Manitoba]]) is a former [[Canadian]] [[ice hockey]] player and the former head coach of the [[Winnipeg Jets]] and [[Ottawa Senators]].

==Playing career==
Selected in the [[1974 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Washington Capitals]], Paddock only played 8 games with the Capitals before he was traded to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. He played a memorable role in the [[1980]] [[Stanley Cup Finals]], scoring the tying goal to send game 6 of the Finals into overtime.  Unfortunately for the Flyers, [[Bob Nystrom]] scored at 7:11 of [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] to win the [[Stanley Cup]].

Throughout his career he had a difficult time trying to crack the lineup on an NHL team.  Playing primarily in the minors, in particular the [[Maine Mariners]], Paddock retired as a player in 1983–84 and moved to the coaching side.

==Coaching career==
After coaching in the minors for several years he was named head coach of the [[Winnipeg Jets]] in [[1991]], becoming the first Manitoba-born coach of the franchise.  During his coaching stint he would also become General Manager of the team, and would relinquish his coaching duties in early 1994.  He would remain the General Manager, even after the Jets relocated to Phoenix, until December 1996.

After two years as a scout with the [[New York Rangers]], Paddock would return to head coaching in 1999, primarily in the [[American Hockey League|AHL]]. He was head coach of the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]] from 1999–2002, winning the AHL Championships in the 1999–2000 season.  Later he coached the AHL [[Binghamton Senators]] from 2002–2005.  He was the assistant coach of the [[Ottawa Senators]] until July 6th, 2007 when he was named head coach. In the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 season]], Paddock was the head coach of the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] team for the [[56th National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star game]] on [[January 27]], [[2008]] as he had the best record in the East leading up to the break. 

==Firing==
On [[February 27]], [[2008]], General Manager [[Bryan Murray (ice hockey)|Bryan Murray]] fired Paddock as head coach of the Senators after several lackluster performances by the team in February, and a generally poor record since the first 17 games of the year when they had a record of 15–2. Murray would serve as head coach for the remainder of the 2007–08 season and playoffs.
