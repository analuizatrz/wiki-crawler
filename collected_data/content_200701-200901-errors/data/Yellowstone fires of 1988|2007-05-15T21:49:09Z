The '''Yellowstone Fire of 1988''' was the largest [[forest fire]] known to affect  [[Yellowstone National Park]] in recorded history. The fires burned for several months and by the time the winter snows extinguished the flames, 793,880&nbsp;acres (321,271&nbsp;ha) or roughly 36 percent of the park had been impacted by the fires.<ref name="Young">{{cite web |last=Young|first=Linda |url = http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_26c.html |title = Flames of Controversy: Interpreting the Yellowstone Fires of 1988 | work = Wildland Fire Education and Outreach Case Studies |format = |publisher = National Interagency Fire Command| accessdate = 2006-11-26| accessyear =}}</ref>  

The fires were considered a disaster by many, especially in the years shortly after the fire had ended, but [[forester]]s and [[biologists]] have demonstrated that fire is a natural part of the ecosystem and many native plant and trees species are unable to properly reproduce without the assistance of fire. The fires burned in what is known as a "mosaic pattern"; leaping from one area to another and leaving huge expanses of forestland completely untouched in between areas that were burned. After almost 20 years, much of the areas that burned have started to rejuvenate, and in many cases, are healthier, denser and more disease resistant. 

While the fire was in progress, much dissent was expressed by several factions regarding efforts to extinguish the blaze, versus allowing it to burn itself out.
