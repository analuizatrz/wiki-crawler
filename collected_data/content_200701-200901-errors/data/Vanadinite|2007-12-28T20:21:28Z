'''Vanadinite''' is [[mineral]] belonging to the [[apatite]] group of [[Phosphate minerals|phosphate]]s, with the chemical formula Pb<sub>5</sub>(VO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl. It is one of the main industrial ores of the metal [[vanadium]] and a minor source of [[lead]]. A dense, brittle mineral, it is usually found in the form of red hexagonal [[crystal]]s. It is an uncommon mineral, formed by the oxidation of lead ore deposits such as [[galena]]. First discovered in 1801 in [[Mexico]], vanadinite deposits have since been unearthed in South America, Europe, Africa and other parts of North America.

==Origins==
Vanadinite is an uncommon mineral, only occurring as the result of chemical alterations to a pre-existing material. It is therefore known as a secondary mineral. It is found in [[arid]] climates and forms by [[Redox|oxidation]] of primary lead minerals. Vanadinite is especially found in association with the lead sulfide, [[galena]]. Other associated minerals include [[wulfenite]], [[limonite]] and [[barite]].<ref name="MinDat"/><ref name="treasure"/><ref name="galleries"/>

It was originally discovered in Mexico by the Spanish mineralogist [[Andrés Manuel del Río]] in 1801. He called the mineral "brown lead" and asserted that it contained a new element, which he first named pancromium and later, erythronium. However, he was later led to believe that this was not a new element but merely an impure form of chromium. In 1830, [[Nils Gabriel Sefström]] discovered a new element, which he named vanadium. It was later revealed that this was identical to the metal discovered earlier by Andrés Manuel del Río. Del Río's "brown lead" was also rediscovered, in 1838 in Zimapan, [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]], [[Mexico]], and was named vanadinite due its high vanadium content. Other names that have since been given to vanadinite are johnstonite and lead vanadate. 

Deposits of vanadinite are now found worldwide including [[Austria]], [[Spain]], [[Scotland]], the [[Ural Mountains]], [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], [[Morocco]], [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]] and the [[US]] states of [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]] and [[South Dakota]].<ref name="MinDat"/><ref name="treasure"/><ref name="galleries"/><ref name="brit"/>

==Structure==

Vanadinite is a lead chlorovanadate with the chemical formula Pb<sub>5</sub>(VO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl. It is composed of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen and 2.50% chlorine. Each structural unit of vanadinite contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six [[divalent]] lead ions at the corners of a regular [[octahedron]], with one of the lead ions provided by an adjoining vanadinite molecule. The distance between each lead and chlorine ion is 3.17&nbsp;[[ångström]]s (1 ångström = 0.1&nbsp;[[nanometre]]s). The shortest distance between each lead ion is 4.48&nbsp;ångströms. The octahedron shares two of its opposite faces with that of neighbouring vanadinite units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms at the corners of an irregular [[tetrahedron]]. The distance between each oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76&nbsp;ångströms. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain.<ref>{{cite web  | title = The Structure of Vanadinite | author = J. Trotter and W. H.

Crystals of vanadinite conform to a [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] system of [[Crystal structure#Classification of crystals by symmetry|symmetry]]. This internal structure is often reflected in the hexagonal external shape of the crystals. The crystals are usually in the form of short hexagonal prisms, but can also be found as hexagonal pyramids, rounded masses or crusts. A [[Crystal structure|unit cell]] of vanadinite, the smallest divisible unit that possesses the same symmetry and properties, is in the form of a hexagonal prism. A unit cell of vanadinite is comprised of two of its molecules. The unit cell has the dimensions ''[[Hexagonal crystal system|a]]''=10.331&nbsp;ångströms and ''[[Hexagonal crystal system|c]]''=7.343&nbsp;ångströms, where ''a'' is the length of each side of the hexagon and ''c'' is the height of the prism. The volume of each unit cell of vanadinite, given by the formula V = ''a''²''c'' sin(60°), is 678.72&nbsp;ångströms³.<ref name="treasure"/><ref name="WebMineral"/>

==Characteristics==
Vanadinite is in the [[apatite]] group of [[Phosphate minerals|phosphate]]s, and forms a chemical series with the minerals [[pyromorphite]] (Pb<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl) and [[mimetite]] (Pb<sub>5</sub>(AsO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl), with both of which it may form [[solid solution]]s. Whereas most chemical series involve the substitution of metallic ions, this series substitutes its anion groups; phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>), [[arsenate]] (AsO<sub>4</sub>) and [[vanadate]] (VO<sub>4</sub>). Common [[impurities]] of vanadinite include [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]] and [[calcium]], where these may act as an [[isomorphic]] substitute for vanadium. Vanadinite when containing a high amount of the arsenic impurity is known as endlichite.<ref name="MinDat">{{cite web  | title = Vanadinite | publisher = MinDat.org | url =http://www.mindat.org/min-4139.html  | accessdate = 2007-06-09 }}</ref><ref name="treasure">{{cite book | title = Treasures of the Earth: The Minerals and Gemstone Collection - Vanadinite factsheet | publisher = Orbis Publishing Ltd |date= 1995|  }}</ref><ref name="galleries">{{cite web  | title = The Mineral Vanadinite | publisher = mineral.galleries.com | url =http://mineral.galleries.com/minerals/phosphat/vanadini/vanadini.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | title = Vanadinite | publisher = WildAboutRocks.com | url =http://www.wildaboutrocks.com/prod2416.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-26 }}</ref>

Vanadinite is usually bright-red or orange-red in colour, although sometimes brown, red-brown, grey, yellow or colourless. Its distinctive colour makes it popular among mineral collectors. Its [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]] can be either pale yellow or brownish-yellow. Vanadinite may be transparent, translucent or opaque, and its [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] can range from [[resin]]ous to [[adamantine]]. Vanadinite is [[anisotropic]], meaning that some of its properties differ when measured along different axes. When measured perpendicular and parallel to its axis of anisotropy, its [[refractive index|refractive indices]] are 2.350 and 2.416 respectively. This gives it a [[birefringence]] of 0.066.<ref name="MinDat"/><ref name="treasure"/><ref name="galleries"/><ref name="WebMineral">{{cite web  | title = Vanadinite Mineral Data| publisher = WebMineral.com | url =http://webmineral.com/data/Vanadinite.shtml  | accessdate = 2007-06-09 }}</ref>

Vanadinite is very brittle, producing small, [[conchoidal]] fragments when [[fracture]]d. Its hardness is 3–4 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]], about the same as a copper coin. Vanadinite is particularly heavy for a translucent mineral. It has a [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] of 1,416.27&nbsp;[[gram]]s/[[Mole (unit)|mole]] and its [[specific gravity]] can range between 6.6 and 7.2, approximately seven times that of water. This variation in density is caused by impurities.<ref name="MinDat"/><ref name="treasure"/><ref name="brit">{{cite web  | title = Vanadinite | publisher = Encyclopedia Britannica|date=1911| url =http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Vanadinite | accessdate = 2007-06-26 }}</ref>

==Uses==
[[Image:Vanadinite Morocco.jpg|thumb|Vanadinite from Mibladen, Morocco]]
Along with [[carnotite]] and [[roscoelite]], vanadinite is one of the main industrial ores of the element [[vanadium]], which can be extracted by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and [[smelting]]. It is occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with [[sodium chloride|salt]] (NaCl) or [[sodium carbonate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) at about 850°C to produce [[sodium metavanadate|sodium vanadate]] (NaVO<sub>3</sub>). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of [[vanadium pentoxide]] (V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with [[calcium]] gives pure vanadium.  

Vanadinite deposits are found in over 400 mines across the world.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Vanadium | publisher = University College Cork | last=O'Leary| first=Donal| url =http://www.ucc.ie/academic/chem/dolchem/html/elem/elem023.html |date=2000| accessdate = 2007-06-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | title = Vanadium | publisher =Stena Resources Ltd|url =http://www.stinaresources.com/vanadium.htm|date=2000| accessdate = 2007-06-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | title = Vanadium Fact Sheet| publisher =Manufacturing Advisory Service|url =http://www.mas.dti.gov.uk/pluto-resources/1342.pdf|format=PDF|date=[[2002-03-06]]| accessdate = 2007-06-26 }}</ref> Notable vanadinite mines include those at [[Midelt|Mibladen]], [[Morocco]]; [[Tsumeb]], [[Namibia]]; [[Córdoba, Argentina|Cordoba]], [[Argentina]]; [[Sierra County, New Mexico|Sierra County]], [[New Mexico]]; [[Gila County, Arizona]] and Touisset, Morocco.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Vanadinite| publisher =Minerals.net|url =http://www.minerals.net/mineral/phosphat/vanadini/vanadini.htm| accessdate = 2007-06-26 }}</ref>
