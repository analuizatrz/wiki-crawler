'''Tilghman Street''' is a major street in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States]].  The street is sometimes referred to as '''Old Route 22''' because it used to be [[U.S. Route 22]] from the 1920s through the 1960s. 

The name of the street lasts for about 10 miles from [[Pennsylvania Route 100]], where it is  continuous as Main Street/Old Route 22 to Front Street in Allentown. 

==History==

From its construction in the 1920s through the 1960s, Tilghman Street was U.S. Route 22.  In the 1960s, when the [[Interstate 78]] freeway was constructed, it replaced the current freeway that today is U.S. Route 22 and once was known as Interstate 78.  U.S. Route 22 used to run through northern Allentown as Tilghman Street and then became Union Boulevard, from which it goes into [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] and [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]].

==Street description==

Tilghman Street starts at Pennsylvania Route 100, where it continues as Main Street then Old Route 22.  The speed limit on the street is 45 mph. Tilghman Street divides into a mini [[freeway]] when meeting U.S. Route 22. West-bound Tilghmam Street is used only for U.S. Route 22 West. The east-bound of Tilghamn Street uses U.S. Route 22 East. The same thing occurs for ramps coming off Route 22. Then, Tilghman Street turns local and there's an entrance to the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] at [[Interstate 476]].  

From there, it crosses above the Pennsylvania Turnpike and then intersects with [[Pennsylvania Route 309]]. One mile east of that intersection, there is an intersection with [[Cedar Crest Boulevard]]. Then, Tilghman Street enters Allentown, where it crosses more than 30 major streets in the city. 

Tilghman Street is a fast route in Allentown, where the traffic lights give cars on Tilghman Street substantially more time to cross.  Where Tilghman Street reaches the more populated part of the city, it interchanges with [[Pennsylvania Route 145]], forming Alllentown's 6th and 7th Streets. From there, it crosses the first of two bridges where Jordan Creek and American Parkway run below. It then reaches Front Street, where it crosses the second bridge and becomes Union Boulevard. Tilghman Street is still found in east-side Allentown, but it is not connected to the fast route the street uses in west-side and center city Allentown.
