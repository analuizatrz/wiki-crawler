'''''Hairspray''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[musical film]] produced by [[Craig Zadan|Zadan]]/Meron Productions and distributed by [[New Line Cinema]]. It was released in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and the [[United Kingdom]] on [[July 20]], 2007. The film is an adaptation of the [[Tony Award]]-winning [[Hairspray (musical)|2002 Broadway musical of the same name]], itself adapted from [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' [[Hairspray (1988 film)|1988 comedy film]]. Set in 1962 [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], the film follows a "pleasantly-plump" teen named Tracy Turnblad as she simultaneously pursues stardom as a dancer on a local TV show and rallies against [[racial segregation]].

Adapted from both Waters' 1988 script and [[Thomas Meehan (writer)|Thomas Meehan]] and Mark O'Donnell's book for the stage musical by screenwriter [[Leslie Dixon]], the 2007 version of ''Hairspray'' is directed and choreographed by [[Adam Shankman]]. ''Hairspray'' stars [[John Travolta]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Amanda Bynes]], [[James Marsden]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Brittany Snow]], [[Zac Efron]], [[Elijah Kelley]], [[Allison Janney]], and introduces newcomer [[Nikki Blonsky]] as Tracy Turnblad. ''Hairspray'' features songs from the Broadway musical written by [[Marc Shaiman]] and [[Scott Wittman]], as well as four new Shaiman/Wittman compositions not present in the Broadway version.

==Plot==
[[May 3]], [[1962]] begins the same as every other school day for Tracy Turnblad ([[Nikki Blonsky]]), a "pleasantly plump" high school student from [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. She endures a day's worth of boring classes so that she and her best friend Penny Pingleton ([[Amanda Bynes]]) can race home to catch their favorite [[television show|TV program]], ''The Corny Collins Show''. The program, a teen dance show, is broadcast from Baltimore's station WYZT on weekday afternoons.

Some of the teenagers featured on the show also attend Tracy and Penny's school, in particular snobby rich girl Amber von Tussle ([[Brittany Snow]]) and her heart-throb boyfriend Link Larkin ([[Zac Efron]]), with whom Tracy is madly in love. Amber's mother Velma ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]) manages station WYZT, and goes out of her way to make sure Amber is prominently featured and that ''Corny Collins'' remains a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] program. Corny Collins ([[James Marsden]]) and all of his "Council Kids" are white; black kids are only allowed on ''Corny Collins'' on "Negro Day", held the last Tuesday of each month and hosted by local [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] radio [[dee jay]] Motormouth Maybelle ([[Queen Latifah]]).

Neither Tracy's plus-sized shut-in laundress mother Edna ([[John Travolta]]) nor Penny's strict [[Catholic]] mother Prudy ([[Allison Janney]]) approve of their daughters basing their lives around a TV show, particularly one where teens dance to "[[race music]]". Tracy's father Wilbur ([[Christopher Walken]]), a joke-shop proprietor, is far more lenient. On one day's show, Corny Collins announces that one of his "Council Kids" is going on a leave of absence, and auditions for a replacement will be held the next morning - during school hours. However, Velma turns Tracy away at the audition for being overweight and supportive of [[integration]]. Tracy is sent to [[detention]] for skipping school, but finds that detention hall is where the black kids hang out and dance. Tracy befriends the detention hall's best dancer, Motormouth Maybelle's son Seaweed ([[Elijah Kelley]]), who teaches Tracy several R&B dance moves. These moves secure Tracy a spot on ''The Corny Collins Show''.

Tracy quickly becomes one of Corny's most popular Council Kids and a threat to Velma's quest to have Amber win the show's yearly "Miss Teenage Hairspray" pageant. In addition, Tracy also becomes a threat to Amber's courtship with Link, as the boy becomes increasingly fond of Tracy and less so of Amber. Tracy's popularity earns her a sponsorship offer from clothes salesman Mr. Pinky ([[Jerry Stiller]]), who wants Tracy to be the spokesgirl for his "Hefty Hideaway" [[boutique]] for plus-sized women. Tracy convinces Edna to accompany her to the Hefty Hideaway and act as her negotiating agent, and in the process brings her mother's days as an [[agoraphobe]] to an end.

At school, Tracy eventually introduces Seaweed to Penny, and the two are instantly smitten with each other. One afternoon after Amber deliberately gets Tracy sent to detention, Link gets himself deliberately sent there in support of her. There Seaweed invites the girls and Link to follow him and his sister Little Inez ([[Taylor Parks]]) to a [[record hop|platter party]] at Motormouth Maybelle's record shop. At the party, Maybelle informs everyone that Velma has canceled Negro Day. Tracy suggests that Maybelle and the others stage a [[Demonstration (people)|protest march]], which they plan for the next afternoon, a day before the Miss Hairspray pageant. Link, scheduled to sing at the pageant and worried about his budding career, backs out of the demonstration and accidentally offends Tracy in the process. 

The next morning, Tracy sneaks out of the house to join the protest march, which comes to a halt at a police roadblock set up by Velma. The entire company of protesters is arrested, although Tracy manages to escape. She flees to the Pingletons' house, where Penny lets her hide out in a basement fallout shelter. However, Prudy discovers Tracy and calls the police, tying Penny to her bed upstairs with a [[jump rope]]. Seaweed and a few of the other detention kids (having been bailed out by Wilbur) arrive and help Tracy and Penny escape, and the kids concoct a plan to crash the Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant. Meanwhile, Link visits Tracy's house in order to look for her, and realizes that he is as much in love with her as she is with him. Seaweed and Penny also acknowledge their love during the escape from her house.

With the pageant underway, Velma, leaving nothing to chance, places policemen around and inside station WYZT in order to prevent Tracy from entering. In addition, Velma switches the tallies from the pageant's phone lines so that Amber is guaranteed to win. Penny arrives at the pageant with an incognito Edna, while Wilbur, Seaweed, and the Detention Kids help Tracy sneak past the police and into the studio in time to participate in the Miss Hairspray dance-off. Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy; then he pulls Inez, who has just arrived at WYZT with Maybelle, to the stage to dance for the pageant.

Against all expectations, Inez receives the most votes and wins the pageant, officially [[Racial integration|integrating]] ''The Corny Collins Show''. A perturbed Velma loudly declares her frustration, informing her daughter of the tally-switching scheme. Unknown to Velma, Edna has trained a camera on her, and Velma's outburst is broadcast live on the air, getting her fired. Meanwhile, ''The Corny Collins Show'' set explodes into a celebration as Link and Tracy cement their love with a kiss.

==Production==
===Early development===
Following the success of the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', which won eight [[Tony Award]]s in [[2003]], [[New Line Cinema]], who owned the rights to the [[Hairspray (1988 film)|1988 John Waters film]] upon which the stage musical is based, became interested in adapting the stage show as a musical film. Development work began in late 2004, while a similar film-to-Broadway-to-film project, [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[The Producers (2005 film)|The Producers]]'', was in production.<ref name="EarlyDev">{{cite web|last=Mohr|first=Ian|title=Casting looms for New Line's younger-skewing 'Hairspray'.|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]|date=[[March 2007]]|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1437/is_200503/ai_n18398452|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref>

[[Craig Zadan]] and Neil Meron[[Academy Award]]-winning film adaptation of the Broadway musical ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', were hired as the producers for ''Hairspray'',<ref name="TimeWarner">{{cite news|title=Craig Zadan and Neil Meron Signed to Produce New Line Cinema’s Musical Film Version of Hairspray|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=2004-11-29|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,832538,00.html|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> and began discussing possibly casting [[John Travolta]] and [[Billy Crystal]] as Edna and Wilbur Turnblad, respectively.<ref name="EarlyDev"/> [[Thomas Meehan (writer)|Thomas Meehan]] and Mark O'Donnell, authors of the book for the stage musical, wrote the first draft of the film's screenplay, but were replaced by [[Leslie Dixon]], screenwriter for family comedies such as ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' (1993) and ''[[Freaky Friday (2003 film)|Freaky Friday]]'' (2003).<ref name="EarlyDev"/> After a year's deliberation on who should direct the film, Zadan and Meron finally decided to hire [[Adam Shankman]] to both direct and choreograph ''Hairspray''.<ref name="Shankman2">{{cite web|last=Shankman|first=Adam|title=The Director's Chair: Adam Shankman's Hairspray Diary #2|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|date=[[2007-07-11]]|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=19655|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> Upon learning he had been hired, Shankman arranged a meeting with John Waters, who advised him "don't do what I did, don't do what the play did. You've gotta do your own thing."<ref name="Fresh Air">{{cite web|title=NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=[[2007-07-19]]| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&agg=0&prgDate=07-19-2007&view=storyview|accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref> Despite this, Shankman still noted that "all roads of ''Hairspray'' lead back to John Waters."<ref name="Fresh Air"/>

===(Screen to) stage to screen changes===
Dixon was primarily hired to tone down much of the [[Camp (style)|campiness]] inherent in the stage musical.<ref name="ScriptMag">Verini, Bob ([[July 2007|July]]/[[August 2007]]). "Miss Beehive-ing: Leslie Dixon styles ''Hairspray'' for the Big Screen." ''Script''. Pgs. 60-66</ref> The 2007 film's script is based primarily on the stage musical rather than the 1988 film, so several changes already made to the plot for the stage version remain in this version. These include dropping several characters from the 1988 version (such as Arthur Hodgepile, Franklin von Tussle, Tammy Turner, the [[beatnik]]s, etc.), removing the Tilted  Acres amusement park from the story, and placing Velma in charge of the station where ''The Corny Collins Show'' is filmed. 

One notable difference between the stage musical, the original movie, and the 2007 film version of ''Hairspray'' is that Tracy does not go to jail in the 2007 version. In both previous incarnations of ''Hairspray'', Tracy is arrested and taken to jail along with the other protesters. Edna is presented in this version as an insecure introvert, in contrast to the relatively bolder incarnations present in the 1988 film and the stage musical.<ref name="ScriptMag"/> Among many other elements changed or added to this version are the removal of Motormouth Maybelle's habit of constantly speaking in rhyming [[jive talk]], and doubling the number of teens in Corny Collins' council (from ten on Broadway to twenty in the 2007 film).

Dixon restructured portions of ''Hairspray's'' book to allow several of the songs to blend more naturally into the plot, in particular "(You're) Timeless to Me" and "I Know Where I've Been". "Timeless" becomes the anchor of a newly invented subplot involving Velma's attempt to break up Tracy's parents' marriage and keep the girl off ''Corny Collins'' as a result. The song now serves as Wilbur's apology to Edna, in addition to its original purpose in the stage musical as a tongue-in-cheek declaration of Wilbur and Edna's love for each other.<ref name="ScriptMag"/> Meanwhile, "I Know Where I've Been", instead of being sung by Maybelle alone after being let out of jail, now underscores Maybelle's march on WYZT (which takes place in the stage musical only briefly during "Big, Blonde, and Beautiful").<ref name="ScriptMag"/>

===Pre-production and casting===
''Hairspray'' was produced on a budget of $75 million.<ref name="budget">{{cite news|last=Marr|first=Merissa|title=At 20, ‘Hairspray’ Gets a Third ‘Do.|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter|Hollywood Report]]|date=[[2007-05-25]]|url=http://i53.photobucket.com/albums/g52/Hairspray-Movie-Musical/WallStreetJournal-may25.jpg|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>
An open casting call was announced to cast unknowns in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[New York City]], and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. After auditioning over eleven hundred candidates, [[Nikki Blonsky]], 18-year-old high school senior from [[Great Neck, New York]] who had no previous professional acting experience, was chosen for the lead role of Tracy. Relative unknowns [[Elijah Kelley]] and [[Taylor Parks]] were chosen through similar audition contests to portray Seaweed and Little Inez, respectively. Travolta was finally cast as Edna, although Crystal's role was instead assumed by [[Christopher Walken]]. Several other stars, including [[Queen Latifah]], [[James Marsden]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], and [[Allison Janney]] were chosen for the other supporting adult roles of Motormouth Maybelle, Corny Collins, Velma von Tussle, and Prudy Pingleton, respectively. Teen stars [[Amanda Bynes]], [[Zac Efron]], and [[Brittany Snow]] were cast as Tracy's friends Penny and Link, and her rival Amber.

Since ''Hairspray's'' plot focuses heavily on dance, choreography became a heavy focus for Shankman, who hired four assistant choreographers and put both his acting cast and over a hundred fifty dancers through two months of rehearsals.<ref name="Shankman11">{{cite web|last=Shankman|first=Adam|title=The Director's Chair: Adam Shankman's Hairspray Diary #11|publisher|BroadwayWorld.com|date=[[2007-07-21]]|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=20109|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref><ref name="Shankman13">{{cite web|last=Shankman|first=Adam|title=The Director's Chair: Adam Shankman's Hairspray Diary #13|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|date=[[2007-07-21]]|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=20111|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> The cast recorded the vocal tracks for their songs in the weeks just before principal photography began in September.<ref name="Shankman11"/>

===Principal photography===
Principal photography on ''Hairspray'' took place in [[Toronto]], and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] from [[September 5]] to [[December 8]], [[2006]],<ref name="Canada">{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=John|title=Summer of stars|publisher=[[CanWest Global Communications|Canada.com]]|date=[[2006-06-21]]|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=9f391590-9a3f-4f6e-90da-e8328b66219c&k=14936|accessdate=2006-06-25}}</ref> ''Hairspray'' is explicitly set in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], [[USA]], and the original 1988 film had been shot on location there, but the 2007 film was shot primarily in Toronto because that city was better equipped with the [[sound stage]]s necessary to film a musical.<ref name="Shankman discusses production location">{{cite web|title=Youtube.com|title=Interview with director Adam Shankman on WBAL-TV Baltimore (at 4:16)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA9LYOQrxDo|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref> Some second-unit footage was indeed shot in Baltimore.

The majority of the film was shot at Toronto's Showline Studios<ref name="Shankman12">{{cite web|last=Shankman|first=Adam|title=The Director's Chair: Adam Shankman's Hairspray Diary #12|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|date=[[2007-07-21]]|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=20110|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> Most of the street scenes were shot at the intersection of Dundas Street West and Roncesvalles Avenue. Some of the signs for the [[1960]]s-era stores remain up along the street. Toronto's Lord Lansdowne Public School was used for all of the high school exteriors and some of the interiors, while the old Queen Victoria School in Hamilton was also used for interiors. Scenes at Queen Victoria were shot from [[November 22]] to [[December 2]], and the school was scheduled to be demolished after film production was completed.

Thinner than most of the other men who have portrayed Edna, John Travolta appears onscreen in a large [[fat suit]], and required four hours of makeup in order to appear before the cameras.<ref name="Travolta">{{cite news|last=Green|first=Jesse|title=Seeking His Inner Her, Size XXXL|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=[[2007-07-15]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/movies/15gree.html?_r=1&ref=movies&oref=slogin|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref> His character's nimble dancing style belies her girth; Shankman based Edna's dancing style on the [[hippo]] [[ballerina]]s in the ''[[Dance of the Hours]]'' sequence in [[Walt Disney]]'s 1940 animated feature ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name="Fresh Air"/> Travolta fought for the ability to give his character curves, as opposed to a dumpier figure, and a thick [[Baltimorese|Baltimore accent]].<ref name="Travolta"/>

===Shankman's inspirations===
Shankman included "a lot of winks" to films that influenced his work on ''Hairspray'':<ref name="Fresh Air"/>

* For example, the film's opening shot - a bird's eye view of Baltimore that eventually descends from the clouds to ground level - is a combination of the opening shots of ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961) and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965).<ref name="Fresh Air"/> 
* Several scenes involving Tracy, such as her ride atop the garbage truck during the "Good Morning Baltimore" number and her new hairstyle during "Welcome to the '60s", are directly inspired by the [[Barbra Streisand]] musical film version of ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' (1968).<ref name="Fresh Air"/> 
* During "Without Love", Link sings to a photograph of Tracy, which comes to life and sings harmony with him. This is directly inspired from the [[MGM]] musical ''[[The Broadway Melody of 1938]]'' (1937), in which a young [[Judy Garland]] swoons over a photo of actor [[Clark Gable]] as she sings "You Made Me Love You".<ref name="Fresh Air"/>

====Song score production and changes====
Music producer/composer/co-lyricist [[Marc Shaiman]] and co-lyricist [[Scott Wittman]] were required to alter their Broadway ''Hairspray'' song score in various ways in order to work on film, from changing portions of the lyrics in some songs (e.g. "(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs", "Big, Blonde and Beautiful", and "You Can't Stop the Beat") to more or less completely removing other songs from the film altogether.

"Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now", a popular number from the stage musical, features Tracy, Penny, and Amber arguing with their respective mothers. Neither Adam Shankman nor Leslie Dixon could come up with a solution for filming "Mama" that didn't require a three-way split screen - something they wanted to avoid<ref name="ScriptMag"/> - and both felt the number did not adequately advance the plot.<ref name="ScriptMag"/><ref name="Shankman3">{{cite web|last=Shankman|first=Adam|title=The Director's Chair: Adam Shankman's Hairspray Diary #3|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|date=[[2007-07-21]]|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=19657|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> As a result, "Mama" was reluctantly dropped from the film during pre-production, although it is used by Shaiman as an instrumental when the ''Corny Collins'' kids dance the "Strickin' Chicken". A special version of "Mama" was recorded for the film's end credits in May 2007, during the final score recording process, which featured vocals from each of the three women most famous for portraying Tracy Turnblad: [[Ricki Lake]] from the 1988 film, [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]] from the original Broadway cast, and Nikki Blonsky from the 2007 film.<ref name="Orchestra">{{cite news|last=Burlingame|first=Jon|title=You Can't Stop The Beat: Shaiman's unrivaled songwriting talent is outed by ''Hairspray'' colleagues|publisher=[[The Film Music Society]]|date=[[2007-07-11]]|url=http://www.filmmusicsociety.org/news_events/features/2007/071107.html?IsArchive=071107|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> [[Harvey Fierstein]], who portrayed Edna as part of the original Broadway cast, has a brief cameo moment in the end credits version of "Mama" as well.<ref name="Orchestra"/>

"It Takes Two", a solo for Link, was moved from its place in the stage musical (on Tracy's first day on Corny's Council) to an earlier ''Corny Collins'' scene, although only the coda of the song is used in the final release print. "Cooties", a solo for Amber in the stage musical, is present in this film as an instrumental during the Miss Teenage Hairspray dance-off. As with "Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now", a version of "Cooties", performed in a contemporary pop rendition by [[Aimee Allen]], is present during the end credits.

The performance of a vintage dance called [[Madison (dance)|The Madison]], present in both the 1988 film and the stage musical, was replaced for this version by a newly composed song, "Ladies' Choice". Portions of the Madison dance steps were integrated into the choreography for the musical number "You Can't Stop the Beat", and the song the dance is performed to on Broadway can be heard faintly during Motormouth Maybelle's platter party in the film, retitled "Boink Boink". "The Big Dollhouse" was the only song from the musical not used in the film in any way.

Shaiman and Wittman composed two new songs for the 2007 film: "Ladies' Choice", a solo for Link, and "Come So Far (Got So Far to Go)", a song performed during the end credits by Queen Latifah, Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, and Elijah Kelley. Another "new" song in the 2007 film, "The New Girl in Town", had originally been composed for the Broadway musical, but was deemed unnecessary and discarded from the musical. Director Adam Shankman decided to use the song to both underscore a rise-to-fame montage for Tracy and to showcase Maybelle's "Negro Day", which is never actually seen in either of the earlier incarnations of ''Hairspray''.<ref>Shankman, Adam (2007). ''Hairspray: Soundtrack to the Motion Picture'' [Liner notes]. New York: New Line Records.</ref>

One additional Shaiman/Wittman song, a ballad entitled "I Can Wait", was composed for the film as a solo for Tracy, meant to replace the stage musical's reprise of "Good Morning Baltimore". "I Can Wait" was shot for the film (Tracy performs the number while locked in Prudy's basement), but was eventually deleted from the final release print. The audio recording of "I Can Wait" was made available as a special bonus track for customers who pre-ordered the ''Hairspray'' soundtrack on [[iTunes]], and the scene itself will be included as a special feature on the film's [[DVD]] release.<ref name="Shankman19">{{cite web|last=Shankman|first=Adam|title=The Director's Chair: Adam Shankman's Hairspray Diary #19|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|date=[[2007-08-07]]|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=20531|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref>

Post-production took place in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where composer/co-lyricist Marc Shaiman continued work on the film's music by employing the [[Hollywood Symphony Orchestra]] to record instrumentation for both the songs and the incidental score.<ref name="Orchestra"/>

''Hairspray'' has garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics such as [[Roger Ebert]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', as well as a smaller number of reviews comparing it unfavorably to the Waters original. The film is one of the top picks on [[Metacritic]], with an average of 81%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hairspray (2007): Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/hairspray2007|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> It scored a 93% "fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], also indicating excellent reviews,<ref>{{cite web|title=Hairspray|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hairspray/|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> and making it as of present one of 2007's top twenty best-reviewed films.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Movies: Best of Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt_year.php?year=2007|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref>

Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, saying that there was "a lot of craft and slyness lurking beneath the circa-1960s goofiness."<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Hairspray|publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=[[2007-07-20]]|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070719/REVIEWS/70702001/1023|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> Lou Lumenick of ''[[The New York Post]]'' hailed ''Hairspray'' as "The best and most entertaining movie adaptation of a stage musical so far this century - and yes, I’m including the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning ''Chicago.''"<ref>{{cite news|last=Lumenick|first=Lou|title=Tons of Fun: Star-studded Musical Large and in Charge|publisher=[[New York Post]]|date=[[2007-07-17]]|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/07172007/entertainment/movies/tons_of_fun_movies_lou_lumenick.htm|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> ''[[New York Daily News]]'' critic Jack Matthews called the film "A great big sloppy kiss of entertainment for audiences weary of explosions, CGI effects and sequels, sequels, sequels."<ref>{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=Jack|title='Hair' do...|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|date=[[2007-07-22]]|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/07/20/2007-07-20_hair_do.html|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' review offered Michael Sragow's opinion that "in its entirety, ''Hairspray'' has the funny tilt that only a director-choreographer like Shankman can give to a movie."<ref>{{cite news|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title='Hair' apparent|publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=[[2007-07-20]]|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/bal-to.hairspray20jul20,0,5157094.story|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> Dana Stevens from ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' called ''Hairspray'' "intermittently tasty, if a little too frantically eager to please."<ref>{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=Dana|title=Not a Drag: John Travolta in ''Hairspray''|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=[[2007-07-19]]|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2170730|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref>

''[[The New Yorker]]''’s [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] felt the new version of ''Hairspray'' was "perfectly pleasant," but compared unfavorably to the Broadway musical, since "[director Adam Shankman and screenwriter Leslie Dixon] have removed the traces of camp humor and Broadway blue that gave the stage show its happily knowing flavor."<ref>{{cite news|last=Denby|first=David|title=Hairspray|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=[[2007-07-30]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/hairspray_shankman|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> Stephanie Zacharek of ''[[Salon.com]]'' found ''Hairspray'' "reasonably entertaining. But do we really need to be entertained reasonably? Waters's original was a crazy sprawl that made perfect sense; this ''Hairspray'' toils needlessly to make sense of that craziness, and something gets lost in the translation."<ref>{{cite web|last=Zacharek|first=Stephanie|title="Hairspray"|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|date=[[2007-07-20]]|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2007/07/20/hairspray/index1.html|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref>

Although it was generally received well by both critics and the box office, ''Hairspray'' nonetheless garnered some criticism upon its release by individuals in the [[homosexual|gay]] community.  Much of this criticism surrounded Travolta's portrayal of Edna Turnblad, a role played in the original film by celebrated drag performer [[Divine (actor)|Divine]], and in the stage adaptation by [[Harvey Fierstein]]. Kevin Naff, a managing editor for [[Washington, DC]]/Baltimore area online gay news site ''[[The Washington Blade]]'' called for a boycott of the new ''Hairspray'' film, alleging that [[Scientology]], in which Travolta believes, was patently [[homophobic]], and allegedly supported [[ex-gay|workshops designed to "cure" homosexuals]].<ref name="Boycott">{{cite news|last=Walls|first=Jeannette|title=Travolta says ''Hairspray'' isn't a gay film|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=[[2007-07-03]]|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19512551/|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> Adam Shankman protested Naff's proposed boycott, stating that Travolta was not homophobic, as he, Waters, Shainman & Wittman, and several other members of the creative staff were gay, and Travolta got along well with the entire crew.<ref name="ShankmanOnBoycott">{{cite web|title=Shankman Blasts Proposed ''Hairspray'' Boycott|publisher=Hollywood.com|date=[[2007-07-16]]|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Shankman_Blasts_Proposed_Hairspray_Boycott/4404792|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> "John's personal beliefs did not walk onto my set," said Shankman.
