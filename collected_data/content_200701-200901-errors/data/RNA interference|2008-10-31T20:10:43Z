'''RNA interference''' ('''RNAi''') is a mechanism that inhibits [[gene expression]] at the stage of [[translation (biology)|translation]] or by hindering the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of specific genes. RNAi targets include RNA from [[virus]]es and [[transposon]]s (significant for some forms of innate [[immune system|immune response]]), and also plays a role in [[gene regulation|regulating]] [[developmental biology|development]] and [[genome]] maintenance. [[Small interfering RNA]] strands (siRNA) are key to the RNAi process, and have [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[nucleotide]] sequences to the targeted RNA strand. Specific RNAi pathway proteins are guided by the siRNA to the targeted [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), where they "cleave" the target, breaking it down into smaller portions that can no longer be translated into protein. A type of RNA transcribed from the genome itself, [[microRNA]] (miRNA), works in the same way.<ref name=MorrisKV>{{cite book | author = Morris KV (editor). | title = RNA and the Regulation of Gene Expression: A Hidden Layer of Complexity | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg ISBN 978-1-904455-25-7 ]}}</ref>

The RNAi pathway is initiated by the enzyme [[dicer]], which cleaves long, dsRNA molecules into short fragments of 20&ndash;25 [[base pair]]s. One of the two strands of each fragment, known as the ''guide strand'', is then incorporated into the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] (RISC) and pairs with complementary sequences. The most well-studied outcome of this recognition event is [[post-transcriptional gene silencing]]. This occurs when the guide strand specifically pairs with an mRNA molecule and induces cleavage by [[argonaute]], the catalytic component of the RISC complex.  Another outcome is [[epigenetic]] changes to a gene – [[histone]] modification and [[DNA methylation]] –  affecting the degree the gene is transcribed.

The selective and robust effect of RNAi on gene expression makes it a valuable research tool, both in [[cell culture]] and in living organisms because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can induce suppression of specific genes of interest. RNAi may also be used for large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell, which can help identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as [[cell division]]. Exploitation of the pathway is also a promising tool in [[biotechnology]] and [[medicine]].

Historically, RNA interference was known by other names, including [[post transcriptional gene silencing]], and quelling. Only after these apparently-unrelated processes were fully understood did it become clear that they all described the RNAi phenomenon. RNAi has also been confused with [[antisense]] suppression of gene expression, which does not act catalytically to degrade mRNA, but instead involves single-stranded RNA fragments physically binding to mRNA and blocking protein [[translation (biology)|translation]].

RNAi is an RNA-dependent [[gene silencing]] process that is controlled by the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] (RISC) and is initiated by short double-stranded RNA molecules in a cell's [[cytoplasm]], where they interact with the catalytic RISC component [[argonaute]].<ref name="Daneholt2006"/> When the dsRNA is exogenous (coming from infection by a [[virus]] with an RNA genome or laboratory manipulations), the RNA is imported directly into the cytoplasm and cleaved to short fragments by the enzyme [[dicer]]. The initiating dsRNA can also be endogenous (originating in the cell), as in pre-[[microRNA]]s expressed from [[non-coding RNA|RNA-coding gene]]s in the genome. The primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic [[stem-loop]] structure of pre-miRNA in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], then exported to the cytoplasm to be cleaved by dicer. Thus, the two dsRNA pathways, exogenous and endogenous, converge at the RISC complex.<ref name="pmid15614608">{{cite journal

Mature miRNAs are structurally similar to siRNAs produced from exogenous dsRNA, but before reaching maturity, miRNAs must first undergo extensive [[post-transcriptional modification]]. An miRNA is expressed from a much longer RNA-coding gene as a [[primary transcript]] known as a ''pri-miRNA'' which is processed, in the [[cell nucleus]], to a 70-nucleotide [[stem-loop]] structure called a ''pre-miRNA'' by the microprocessor complex. This complex consists of an [[RNase III]] enzyme called [[Drosha]] and a dsRNA-binding protein [[Pasha]]. The dsRNA portion of this pre-miRNA is bound and cleaved by dicer to produce the mature miRNA molecule that can be integrated into the RISC complex; thus, miRNA and siRNA share the same cellular machinery downstream of their initial processing.<ref name="Denli">{{cite journal |author=Gregory R, Chendrimada T, Shiekhattar R |title=MicroRNA biogenesis: isolation and characterization of the microprocessor complex |journal=Methods Mol Biol |volume=342 |issue= |pages=33–47 |year=2006 |pmid=16957365}}</ref> 

The siRNAs derived from long dsRNA precursors differ from miRNAs in that miRNAs, especially those in animals, typically have incomplete base pairing to a target and inhibit the translation of many different mRNAs with similar sequences.

The mechanism by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood, and most studies have focused on the [[mating-type region]] in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions or organisms.

Organisms vary in their ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA interference can be both systemic and heritable in plants and ''[[C. elegans]]'', although not in ''[[Drosophila]]'' or [[mammal]]s. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through [[plasmodesmata]] (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport).<ref name=Lodish /> The heritability comes from [[DNA methylation|methylation]] of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Jones L, Ratcliff F, Baulcombe DC| title=RNA-directed transcriptional gene silencing in plants can be inherited independently of the RNA trigger and requires Met1 for maintenance| journal=Current Biology| year=2001| volume=11| issue=10| pages=747–757| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VRT-433PCG6-K&_user=10&_coverDate=05%2F15%2F2001&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=1e8ad684cc54f07e94776926599d292b | doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00226-3}}</ref> A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce translational repression.<ref name="Saumet" /> This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation [[eukaryotic initiation factor|initiation factor]]s with the messenger RNA's [[polyadenylation|polyadenine tail]].<ref name="Humphreys">{{cite journal | author = Humphreys DT, Westman BJ, Martin DI, Preiss T | year = 2005 | title= MicroRNAs control translation initiation by inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor 4E/cap and poly(A) tail function. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=102 | pages=16961–16966 | pmid = 16287976  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0506482102}}</ref>

===Related prokaryotic systems===
Gene expression in prokaryotes is influenced by an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi.

==Evolution==
Based on [[computational phylogenetics#maximum parsimony|parsimony-based]] [[phylogenetic]] analysis, the [[most recent common ancestor]] of all [[eukaryote]]s most likely already possessed an early RNA interference pathway; the absence of the pathway in certain eukaryotes is thought to be a derived characteristic.<ref name="Cerutti">{{cite journal |author=Cerutti H, Casas-Mollano J |title=On the origin and functions of RNA-mediated silencing: from protists to man |journal=Curr Genet |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=81–99 |year=2006 |pmid=16691418 |doi=10.1007/s00294-006-0078-x}}</ref> This ancestral RNAi system probably contained at least one [[dicer]]-like protein, one [[argonaute]], one [[PIWI protein]], and an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] that may have also played other cellular roles. A large-scale [[comparative genomics]] study likewise indicates that the eukaryotic [[crown group]] already possessed these components, which may then have had closer functional associations with generalized RNA degradation systems such as the [[Exosome complex|exosome]].<ref name="Anantharaman">{{cite journal |author=Anantharaman V, Koonin E, Aravind L |title=Comparative genomics and evolution of proteins involved in RNA metabolism |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=30 |issue=7 |pages=1427–64 |year=2002 |pmid=11917006 |doi=10.1093/nar/30.7.1427}}</ref> This study also suggests that the RNA-binding argonaute protein family, which is shared among eukaryotes, most archaea, and at least some bacteria (such as ''[[Aquifex aeolicus]]''), is homologous to and originally evolved from components of the [[translation (genetics)|translation initiation]] system.

RNA interference genes, as components of the antiviral innate immune system in many eukaryotes, are involved in an [[evolutionary arms race]] with viral genes. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms for suppressing the RNAi response in their host cells, an effect that has been noted particularly for plant viruses.<ref name="Lucy" /> Studies of evolutionary rates in ''Drosophila'' have shown that genes in the RNAi pathway are subject to strong [[directional selection]] and are among the fastest-[[evolution|evolving]] genes in the ''Drosophila'' [[genome]].<ref name="Obbard">{{cite journal |author=Obbard D, Jiggins F, Halligan D, Little T |title=Natural selection drives extremely rapid evolution in antiviral RNAi genes |journal=Curr Biol |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=580–5 |year=2006 |pmid=16546082 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.065}}</ref>

===Gene knockdown===
The RNA interference pathway is often exploited in experimental biology to study the function of genes in [[cell culture]] and ''in vivo'' in [[model organism]]s.<ref name="Daneholt2006"/> Double-stranded RNA is synthesized with a sequence complementary to a gene of interest and introduced into a cell or organism, where it is recognized as exogenous genetic material and activates the RNAi pathway. Using this mechanism, researchers can cause a drastic decrease in the expression of a targeted gene. Studying the effects of this decrease can show the physiological role of the gene product. Since RNAi may not totally abolish expression of the gene, this technique is sometimes referred as a "[[Gene knockdown|knockdown]]", to distinguish it from "[[Gene knockout|knockout]]" procedures in which expression of a gene is entirely eliminated.<ref name="pmid12480342">{{cite journal

Extensive efforts in [[computational biology]] have been directed toward the design of successful dsRNA reagents that maximize gene knockdown but minimize "off-target" effects. Off-target effects arise when an introduced RNA has a base sequence that can pair with and thus reduce the expression of multiple genes at a time. Such problems occur more frequently when the dsRNA contains repetitive sequences. It has been estimated from studying the genomes of ''[[H. sapiens]]'', ''[[C. elegans]]'', and ''[[S. pombe]]'' that about 10% of possible siRNAs will have substantial off-target effects.<ref name="Qiu" /> A multitude of software tools have been developed implementing [[algorithm]]s for the design of general,<ref name="Naito_ds">{{cite journal |author=Naito Y, Yamada T, Matsumiya T, Ui-Tei K, Saigo K, Morishita S |title=dsCheck: highly sensitive off-target search software for double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=33 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W589–91 |year=2005 |pmid=15980542 |doi=10.1093/nar/gki419}}</ref><ref name="Henschel">{{cite journal |author=Henschel A, Buchholz F, Habermann B |title=DEQOR: a web-based tool for the design and quality control of siRNAs |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=32 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W113–20 |year=2004 |pmid=15215362 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkh408}}</ref> mammal-specific,<ref name="Naito_si">{{cite journal |author=Naito Y, Yamada T, Ui-Tei K, Morishita S, Saigo K |title=siDirect: highly effective, target-specific siRNA design software for mammalian RNA interference |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=32 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W124–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15215364 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkh442}}</ref> and virus-specific<ref name="Naito_virus">{{cite journal |author=Naito Y, Ui-Tei K, Nishikawa T, Takebe Y, Saigo K |title=siVirus: web-based antiviral siRNA design software for highly divergent viral sequences |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=34 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W448–50 |year=2006 |pmid=16845046 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkl214}}</ref> siRNAs that are automatically checked for possible cross-reactivity. 

Depending on the organism and experimental system, the exogenous RNA may be a long strand designed to be cleaved by dicer, or short RNAs designed to serve as siRNA substrates.

===Functional genomics===
Most [[functional genomics]] applications of RNAi in animals have used ''C. elegans''<ref name="Kamath">{{cite journal |author=Kamath R, Ahringer J |title=Genome-wide RNAi screening in Caenorhabditis elegans |journal=Methods |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=313–21 |year=2003 |pmid=12828945 |doi=10.1016/S1046-2023(03)00050-1}}</ref> and ''Drosophila'',<ref name="Boutros">{{cite journal |author=Boutros M, Kiger A, Armknecht S, Kerr K, Hild M, Koch B, Haas S, Paro R, Perrimon N |title=Genome-wide RNAi analysis of growth and viability in Drosophila cells |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5659 |pages=832–5 |year=2004 |pmid=14764878 |doi=10.1126/science.1091266}}</ref> as these are the common [[model organism]]s in which RNAi is most effective. ''C. elegans'' is particularly useful for RNAi research for two reasons: firstly, the effects of the gene silencing are generally heritable, and secondly because delivery of the dsRNA is extremely simple. Through a mechanism whose details are poorly understood, bacteria such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that carry the desired dsRNA can be fed to the worms and will transfer their RNA payload to the worm via the intestinal tract. This "delivery by feeding" is just as effective at inducing gene silencing as more costly and time-consuming delivery methods, such as soaking the worms in dsRNA solution and injecting dsRNA into the gonads.<ref name=Fortunato_2005>{{cite journal |author=Fortunato A, Fraser A |title=Uncover genetic interactions in ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' by RNA interference |journal=Biosci Rep |volume=25 |issue=5–6 |pages=299–307 |year=2005 |pmid=16307378 |doi=10.1007/s10540-005-2892-7}}</ref> Although delivery is more difficult in most other organisms, efforts are also underway to undertake large-scale genomic screening applications in cell culture with mammalian cells.<ref name="Cullen_genome">{{cite journal |author=Cullen L, Arndt G |title=Genome-wide screening for gene function using RNAi in mammalian cells |journal=Immunol Cell Biol |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=217–23 |year=2005 |pmid=15877598 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1711.2005.01332.x}}</ref>

===Biotechnology===
RNA interference has been used for applications in [[biotechnology]], particularly in the engineering of food plants that produce lower levels of natural plant toxins. Such techniques take advantage of the stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in plant stocks. For example, [[cotton]] seeds are rich in [[protein in nutrition|dietary protein]] but naturally contain the toxic [[terpenoid]] product [[gossypol]], making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi has been used to produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of [[delta-cadinene synthase]], a key enzyme in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production in other parts of the plant, where gossypol is important in preventing damage from plant pests.<ref name="Sunilkumar">{{cite journal |author=Sunilkumar G, Campbell L, Puckhaber L, Stipanovic R, Rathore K |title=Engineering cottonseed for use in human nutrition by tissue-specific reduction of toxic gossypol |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=103 |issue=48 |pages=18054–9 |year=2006 |pmid=17110445 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0605389103}}</ref> Similar efforts have been directed toward the reduction of the [[cyanide|cyanogenic]] natural product [[linamarin]] in [[cassava]] plants.<ref name="Siritunga">{{cite journal |author=Siritunga D, Sayre R |title=Generation of cyanogen-free transgenic cassava |journal=Planta |volume=217 |issue=3 |pages=367–73 |year=2003 |pmid=14520563 |doi=10.1007/s00425-003-1005-8}}</ref>

Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation.<ref name=Van_Blokland_1994>{{cite journal | author = Van Blokland R, Van der Geest N, Mol JNM, Kooter JM | title = Transgene-mediated suppression of chalcone synthase expression in ''Petunia hybrida'' results from an increase in RNA turnover | journal = Plant J | year = 1994 | volume = 6 | pages = 861&ndash;77 | url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1994.6060861.x/abs/  | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-313X.1994.6060861.x/abs/ <!--Retrieved from URL by DOI bot-->}}</ref> This phenomenon was called ''co-suppression of gene expression'', but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.<ref>{{cite book | title=Antisense nucleic acids and proteins: fundamentals and applications | author=Mol JNM, van der Krol AR| year=1991| pages=4, 136| publisher=M.

Not long after, plant [[virologist]]s working on improving plant resistance to viral diseases observed a similar unexpected phenomenon. While it was known that plants expressing virus-specific proteins showed enhanced tolerance or resistance to viral infection, it was not expected that plants carrying only short, non-coding regions of viral RNA sequences would show similar levels of protection. Researchers believed that viral RNA produced by transgenes could also inhibit viral replication.<ref name=Covey_1997>{{cite journal | author = Covey S, Al-Kaff N, Lángara A, Turner D | title = Plants combat infection by gene silencing | journal = Nature | year = 1997 | volume = 385 | pages = 781&ndash;2 | doi= 10.1038/385781a0 }}</ref> The reverse experiment, in which short sequences of plant genes were introduced into viruses, showed that the targeted gene was suppressed in an infected plant. This phenomenon was labeled "virus-induced gene silencing" (VIGS), and the set of such phenomena were collectively called [[post transcriptional gene silencing]].<ref name=Ratcliff_1997>{{cite journal | author = Ratcliff F, Harrison B, Baulcombe D| title = A Similarity Between Viral Defense and Gene Silencing in Plants | journal = Science | year = 1997 | volume = 276 | pages = 1558&ndash;60 | doi= 10.1126/science.276.5318.1558 }}</ref>

After these initial observations in plants, many laboratories around the world searched for the occurrence of this phenomenon in other organisms.<ref name="Guo">{{cite journal |author=Guo S, Kemphues K |title=par-1, a gene required for establishing polarity in C. elegans embryos, encodes a putative Ser/Thr kinase that is asymmetrically distributed |journal=Cell |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=611–20 |year=1995 |pmid=7758115 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90082-9}}</ref><ref name="Pal-Bhadra">{{cite journal |author=Pal-Bhadra M, Bhadra U, Birchler J |title=Cosuppression in Drosophila: gene silencing of Alcohol dehydrogenase by white-Adh transgenes is Polycomb dependent |journal=Cell |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=479–90 |year=1997 |pmid=9267028 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80508-5}}</ref> [[Craig C. Mello]] and [[Andrew Fire]]'s 1998 ''Nature'' paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into ''[[C. elegans]]''.<ref name="Fire" /> In investigating the regulation of muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor [[antisense RNA]] injections had an effect on protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term ''RNAi''.  Fire and Mello's discovery was particularly notable because it represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2006 for their work.<ref name="Daneholt2006" />
