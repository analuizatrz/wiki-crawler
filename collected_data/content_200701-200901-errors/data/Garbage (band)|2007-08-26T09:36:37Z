'''Garbage''' is a [[Scotland|Scottish]]/[[USA|American]] [[rock and roll|rock]] group formed in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]], in 1994. The band members are [[Duke Erikson]], [[Shirley Manson]], [[Steve Marker]] and [[Butch Vig]].

Garbage released a string of increasingly successful singles in 1995–1996, culminating in the hit "[[Stupid Girl]]". The debut album, ''[[Garbage (album)|Garbage]]'', was an unexpected smash, selling over 5 million copies and reaching double platinum status in the [[UK]], [[USA]] and [[Australia]]. Garbage spent two years working on a follow-up album, ''[[Version 2.0]]'', which topped the charts in the UK and peaked at #13 in the US. The album was nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s, [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]], and sold over 5 million copies. In 1999, the band performed the theme song to the [[James Bond]] movie ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]''. That year, they also contributed the song "[[When I Grow Up]]" for the [[Adam Sandler]] movie ''[[Big Daddy (film)|Big Daddy]]''.

The band struggled to sustain their initial success, and the band's 2001 third album ''[[beautifulgarbage]]'' failed to match the commercial success achieved by its predecessors. The band struggled to remain together and almost split in 2003, before returning with ''[[Bleed Like Me]]'' in 2005, peaking at a career-high #4 in the United States.

The band cut short a 2005 world tour, and announced an indefinite hiatus, but emphasized the stoppage was not a break-up. Garbage reunited in early 2007 to record new tracks for the greatest hits album, ''[[Absolute Garbage]]'', that was released in July 2007.

==Overview==
Vig, the [[record producer|producer]] of such influential albums as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' and the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' ''[[Siamese Dream]]'', decided he wanted to play in a band again. He asked fellow producers Marker and Erikson, with whom he had played in Spooner and Firetown, to join him. After Steve Marker saw Manson on [[MTV]] (in the music video "Suffocate Me" with her band [[Angelfish (band)|Angelfish]]), they invited her to audition for (and after two auditions, asked her to join) the band. Early auditions saw former [[Pigface]] vocalists, [[Ruby (band)|Lesley Rankine]] and Meg Lee Chin try out.
According to Vig, Garbage was named before Manson joined the band, after [[Pauli Ryan]] <!--who? google him!--> walked in while Vig was working on a remix for [[Nine Inch Nails]] and said it sounded like garbage.<ref>"Butch Vig Biography" [http://www.garbage.suite.dk/bio.html].</ref> A longstanding rumor attributes the statement to [[Trent Reznor]].<ref>"nine inch nails discography" [http://nothing.nin.net/discog.html].</ref>

Garbage's angry, emotional lyrics contrasted with the band's catchy, [[pop music|pop]] [[alternative rock]] music. Garbage utilized [[sampling (music)|samples]], [[music loop|electronic loops]], grungy [[guitar]]s, and various other effects to produce haunting and melodic tracks, made distinctive by [[Scotland|Scottish]] singer Shirley Manson's sultry vocals. The fact that Garbage is composed of three music producers is made obvious by the high production quality, with many layers and a [[Wall of Sound|"wall of sound"]] production aesthetic.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

==Career==
Garbage released a string of increasingly successful singles from 1995 to 1996, culminating in the hit "Stupid Girl". They released the debut album, ''Garbage'', later that year, on the [[Mushroom Records]] label, signed by Gary Ashley. It went top 20 in the United States and top 10 in the United Kingdom.  During this time, the band toured as the opening act for [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]' ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]'' tour.

Garbage spent two years working on a follow-up album, during which time Manson became well-known by the technologically savvy by being one of the first artists to maintain a [[blog]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}} "[[Push It (Garbage song)|Push It]]" was released and became a [[summer hit]] in 1998, reaching #9 in the UK and #52 in the U.S. The second album, ''Version 2.0'', topped the charts in the UK and reached #13 in the US. It was nominated for two Grammy Awards, Album of the Year and Best Rock Album. In 1999, they performed the theme song to the James Bond film ''The World Is Not Enough'' and contributed "[[When I Grow Up]]" to the [[Adam Sandler]] movie ''[[Big Daddy (film)|Big Daddy]]''.

After again retreating into the studio for several years, Garbage released ''beautifulgarbage'' in 2001. While it represented the band's most eclectic and mature sound to date, it contained no standout commercial singles. Hence, no songs charted in the US, and the four singles released in the UK only reached the top 30. Still, the album managed to reach #6 in the UK and #13 in the US, though it quickly slid down the charts. Garbage followed the album with a successful tour of the US and [[Europe]].

Garbage's newest album, ''Bleed Like Me'', was released on [[April 11]], [[2005]]. It hit the charts in many countries, including a #4 peak in the United States and a radio rock hit single, "[[Why Do You Love Me]]". It originally had the working title "Hands on a Hard Body", but Manson announced the band had come up with a new title, ''Bleed Like Me'', that better fits the band's improved dynamic following a period of tension and crisis in October 2003. Manson has also said ''Bleed Like Me'' is more [[hard rock]] and a return to Garbage's roots after the eclectic experiment of ''beautifulgarbage'', an announcement that resonated with most fans.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

In late 2005, rumors swirled that the band would break up, and Manson was reported to have said on stage that this was the last time they would "do this" together. In September 2005, the band's official Web site refuted the rumors of a breakup but confirmed an indefinite hiatus.<ref>"Garbage.com News" [http://www.garbage.com/news/news.php?uid=320]. 25.9.2005. Accessed Sept 5th, 2006.</ref>

In May 2006, the band also confirmed that a Greatest Hits album, a B-Sides album, a live [[DVD]] from the [[Bleed Like Me (tour)|Bleed Like Me tour]], and a video compilation DVD are set to be released if all goes right with their label-related legal issues. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}  The greatest hits album, [[Absolute Garbage]] willl be released in one [http://www.amazon.com/Absolute-Garbage/dp/B000R9J3XE/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/102-1702480-3451362?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1184500528&sr=8-3] and two-disc "Special Edition" [http://www.amazon.com/Absolute-Garbage/dp/B000R9J3X4/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-1702480-3451362?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1184500528&sr=8-1] (with the second disc comprised of remixes of their songs by other artists) formats on July 24th in North America and July 23 outside of it.  The [[Absolute Garbage]] [[music video]] collection containing 15 music videos (but not a complete overview of their videos, missing "Androgyny", "Breaking Up the Girl", "Run Baby, Run", "Sex Is Not The Enemy", "Sleep", "The Trick is to Keep Breathing", and the new single released on the [[Absolute Garbage]], "Tell Me Where It Hurts") as well as almost an hour of never-before-seen footage backstage and behind-the-scenes, live performances and interviews spanning the band's entire career will be released on the same dates.

Having been making records for over a decade, Garbage has to date sold in excess of 14 million albums worldwide, including more than 4.7 million in the United states and 500,000 in Australia alone.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

==Hiatus==
Fans had speculated on whether or not Manson would record a [[Shirley Manson (Solo album)|solo album]] following Garbage's hiatus announcement. By the beginning of the year it had been confirmed that Manson was indeed writing new tracks. In March James Bond [[composer]] [[David Arnold]]'s official website stated that the singer had been booked in for sessions. It was later confirmed that the pair had written and recorded a song together.<ref>"Garbagediscobox.com - David Arnold on his work with Shirley" [http://www.garbagediscobox.com/news/?p=1152]. 9.3.2006. Accessed Sept 5th, 2006.</ref>

By mid-March 2006 Manson had finally confirmed she was indeed recording a solo record in a [[Billboard magazine]] interview, stating that she has no timetable for completing the project, and above all wants to have fun and enjoy herself at that point in time.<ref>"Billboard “Garbage's Shirley Manson Flying Solo” [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002158072]. 14.3.2006. Accessed Sept 5th, 2006.</ref> In an interview with the [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]] in July 2006 she revealed she'd enlisted [[The Blue Nile|Blue Nile]] singer [[Paul Buchanan]] to co-write with. "I thought he’d be very moody and introverted, but he’s not like that at all. He’s quite outgoing and charming. Neither of us has ever written with anybody else before. It’s going to be strange. We’ll see how it goes — it could be a complete unmitigated disaster.”<ref>"Sunday Times “Not So Stupid Girl” " [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2090-2250613,00.html]. 2.7.2006. Accessed Sept 5th, 2006.</ref>  On October 29, 2006, [[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|The Sunday Mail]]<ref>"Sunday Mail “SHIRLEY'S ALL STARS:

October 29, 2006.</ref> reported that in addition to Paul Buchanan and David Arnold, Shirley Manson is working with [[Billy Corgan]] ([[The Smashing Pumpkins]]) & [[Jack White]] ([[The White Stripes]], [[The Raconteurs]]) on her new solo album.  They also report that her debut solo album will be issued in 2007. 

Manson has also been involved in tribute appearances to both [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[The Pretenders]], and appeared in the promotional video for [[She Wants Revenge]]'s single "These Things" and in [[Wendy Schneider]]'s self-abuse documentary ''"CUT: Teens and Self Injury"'' 

The men from Garbage have been reported to be remaining active outside of Garbage. Butch Vig has produced records for [[Jimmy Eat World]] and [[Against Me!]], and has written the music for two films that are currently in pre-production with the completion of post-production due early in 2007.<ref>"Butch Vig Productions [http://www.garbage.suite.dk/]. 31.7.2006.

Accessed Sept 5th, 2006.</ref> According to a blog posted in Jan 2006 by Manson, Duke Erikson has been busy putting the finishing touches to an [[American folk music]] anthology, whilst Steve Marker has also been involved with a [[film score]].<ref>"Shirley Manson’s blog” [http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?id=20060117]. 17.1.2006. Accessed Sept 5th, 2006.</ref>

Garbage played a show on [[January 31]], [[2007]] at the Alex Theatre in [[Glendale, CA]] as part of a benefit for friend [[Wally 'Llama' Ingram]]. The band played "[[Queer (Garbage song)|Queer]]", "[[Cup of Coffee]]" and "[[Bleed Like Me (song)|Bleed Like Me]]" semi-acoustic along with a string quartet, and when they were finished they fans screamed for more,{{Fact|date=August 2007}} but they only returned at the end of the night when everyone who played that night sang a Bob Marley song together. [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], several members of [[The Pixies]], [[Jackson Browne]], and many, many others also played (including Butch and Duke in a different band).

Butch Vig has revealed that Garbage is set to re-enter the studio to record "a couple new songs" for a greatest hits album in late February 2007. The compilation album is titled ''Absolute Garbage''.  It originally was scheduled to be released in March 2007, but was eventually released on July 23, 2007.

On May 19, 2007, a video for "[[Tell Me Where It Hurts (Garbage song)|Tell Me Where It Hurts]]" began airing on Teleport Music in the U.K.  Directed by Sophie Muller, the video is for the first new track from ''[[Absolute Garbage]]''. The single was released on July 9, two weeks before the album was. In addition to the regular edition of ''[[Absolute Garbage]]'', special edition containing a bonus disc with remixes from Unkle, Massive Attack, Felix Da Housecat and others and a DVD holding 15 videos next to interviews, backstage footage and live performances were released as well.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=23775_0_2_0_C Garbage single, compilation and DVD for July]</ref>

In a recent interview with Billboard.com, Butch Vig has stated that Garbage is considering mid-2008 to begin making a fifth album, saying, "We're thinking about it...I think we're more interested in making something that's much more primal and stripped down.  ''[[Absolute Garbage]]'' is the postscript to chapter one.  Whatever we do next will definitely be chapter two."<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003611060]</ref>

===B-sides and rare tracks===
'''''See:''' [[Garbage B-side Chronology]]''

===Live show covers and ad-libs===
Garbage frequently features cover songs as part of their live sets, and has become quite known for doing faithful and honest renditions of past tunes.

On their first tour in 1996 it was just as common for them to cover [[Vic Chesnutt]]'s "Supernatural" as it was for them to do "Kick My Ass" which they'd covered for his tribute album.

For 1998's Version 2.0 tour, the band were including [[The Beatles]]' "[[Day Tripper]]". In 1999, the band even played traditional Scottish poem "John Anderson" by [[Robert Burns]], and The Beatles' "[[Don't Let Me Down (The Beatles song)|Don't Let Me Down]]" as part of a special Edinburgh show to celebrate the opening of the [[Scottish Parliament]] in July 1999.

By the time of the ''[[beautifulgarbage]]'', the band were actively asking the audience for their requests, and this led them to attempt Manson's previous band [[Angelfish (band)|Angelfish]]'s "Suffocate Me" and [[ABBA]]'s "[[Dancing Queen]]", as well as throwing in a cover of "[[Can't Get You out of My Head]]" by [[Kylie Minogue]] at a few shows. By the end of the tour cycle, the band also joined with [[No Doubt]] and [[The Distillers]] in performing [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s "[[Call Me (Blondie song)|Call Me]]" as a closer for their joint-headline arena tour.

The band played [[U2]]'s "[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]" for [[Bono]] at a special [[MusiCares]] award night in 2003, and also played "I Fall to Pieces" by [[Patsy Cline]] for the first time in Nashville, Tennessee at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] on May 6, 2005 as a tribute to playing the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]''. They later played this cover again in Columbus, Ohio. Manson has also recently been quoting "[[Singin' in the Rain (song)|Singin' in the Rain]]" at a number of recent performances of "[[Only Happy When It Rains]]".

In Garbage's tour of 2005 in Australia, Duke Erikson performed [[Velvet Underground]]'s "I'm Waiting For The Man" at the Brisbane show.

Manson has been known to [[ad-lib]] onstage during certain performances of certain songs including: 

* "Not My Idea" - ad-libs from [[Talking Heads]] "[[Once in a Lifetime (Talking Heads song)|Once in a Lifetime]]", [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[No Woman, No Cry]]" and [[New Order]]'s "[[Temptation (New Order song)|Temptation]]".

* "[[Vow (Garbage song)|Vow]]" - ad-libs from [[Patti Smith]]'s "Revenge", [[Marianne Faithfull]]'s "Why D'Ya Do It?", [[The Beatles]]' "[[Why Don't We Do It in the Road?]]", [[My Chemical Romance]]'s "[[Helena (song)|Helena]]", [[Carly Simon]]'s "[[You're So Vain]]", [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love]]", [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]]' "[[Lover I Don't Have to Love]]" and [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]]' "Mystery Girl" and "[[Maps (song)|Maps]]".

* "[[Special (Garbage song)|Special]]" - ad-lib from [[The Pretenders]] "Kid" and "Talk of the Town".

* "Trip My Wire" - ad-libs from [[Junior Parker]]'s "[[Mystery Train]]" and [[Little Richard]]'s "[[Good Golly, Miss Molly]]".

* "[[Stupid Girl]]" - ad-libs from [[Spice Girls]] "[[Wannabe (song)|Wannabe]]'' and [[Deee-Lite]]'s "[[Groove Is in the Heart]]".

* "[[Parade (song)|Parade]]" - ad-libs from [[Missy Elliot]]'s "Get Ur Freak On".

Songs "A Stroke of Luck", "[[Queer (Garbage song)|Queer]]" and "[[You Look So Fine]]" also regularly featured ad-libs but so far, no-one has worked out what they were.

==Tours==
Garbage has completed four full length tours - one for each album release - with each album requiring between 15 to 20 months to complete. During these tours, they headlined their own shows (from clubs to arenas), supported acts such as the [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[No Doubt]], [[Alanis Morissette]], [[U2]] and the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] as well as playing on the line-ups of some of the world's largest and most famous festivals such as the [[Big Day Out]], [[Glastonbury Festival]] and the [[Roskilde Festival]].

Their tours were:

* "Garbage" November 1995 - December 1996
* "Version 2.0" May 1998 - November 1999
* "[[Beautifulgarbage (tour)|Beautifulgarbage]]" October 2001 - November 2002
* "[[Bleed Like Me (tour)|Bleed Like Me]]" March 2005 - October 2005

Garbage toured to promote their fourth album ''[[Bleed Like Me]]'', starting in March 2005. However, in late August 2005 all previously announced tour dates in Europe were cancelled, and the tour ended in Australia in September 2005. The official news stated that "the band feel they have somewhat overextended themselves." The fulfilment of the remaining dates in the U.S. and Australia probably reflects high financial penalties for cancelling closer dates.
