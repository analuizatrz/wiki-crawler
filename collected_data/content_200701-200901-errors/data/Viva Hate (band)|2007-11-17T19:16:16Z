'''Viva Hate''' is a [[Rock music|rock]] band that was formed late in the summer of [[2004]] by [[Geoff Kresge]] after he left [[Tiger Army]]. Shortly after forming Viva Hate, Kresge was asked to join the [[HorrorPops]], with whom he played guitar with  from [[2004]] to [[2006]], although the official statement of his departure was not made until the summer of [[2007]], leaving many questions regarding the nature of his parting ways with the HorrorPops.

Kresge was previously the bassist for [[AFI (band)|AFI]] from [[1992]] to [[1997]]. Lead vocalist [[Matt "Wedge" Wedgley]] was formerly a member of [[The Force (band)|The Force]] with [[Hunter Burgan]] of AFI.

Viva Hate has recorded some demos which are available, in edited versions, on their [[MySpace]] profile, but have no current plans to record an album.  A vinyl 7" single is planned for release on Halloween 2007.

In February 2007, the band announced that [[Greg Utter]] of [[Swingin' Utters]] joined on [[drums]]. He replaced original drummer [[Mad Dog Chad]], who had left the band to focus on his own project, [[Ends In Tragedy]]. In [[March]] [[2007]], the band opened for Kresge's former band, AFI, on several dates through [[California]], [[Oregon]] and [[Nevada]].
