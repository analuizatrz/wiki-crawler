'''Timeline of chemistry''' lists important works, discoveries, ideas, inventions, and experiments, that significantly changed mankind's understanding of the composition of matter and of the interactions thereof, the modern science known as [[chemistry]].  This timeline is organized chronologically by date, and then by the [[chemist]] who is credited with the discovery or idea.

==Early years==
Prior to the acceptance of the [[scientific method]] in the 1600's and its application to the field of chemistry, it is somewhat controversial to consider many of the people listed below as "chemists" in the modern sense of the world.  However, the ideas of certain great thinkers, either for their prescience, or for their wide and long-term acceptance, bears listing here.

*c. 3000 BCE: [[Egyptian]]s formulated the theory of the [[Ogdoad]] the “primordial forces”, from which all was formed; these were the elements of [[chaos]], numbered in eight, that existed before the creation of the sun.

*c. 1900 BCE: [[Hermes Trismegistus]], a great Egyptian adept king, is thought to have founded of the art of [[alchemy]].

*c. 1500 BCE: the world's first chemist ‘[[Tapputi]]’ the perfume-maker was mentioned in a cuneiform tablet in Mesopotamia.

*c. 450 BCE: [[Empedocles]] - assertes that all things are composed of four primal [[element]]s: earth, air, fire, and water, whereby two active and opposing [[force]]s, love and hate, or affinity and antipathy, act upon these elements, combining and separating them into infinitely varied forms.

*c. 440 BCE: [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] - Proposes idea of the atom, an indivisible particle that all matter is made of.  This idea is largely rejected by natural philosophers in favor of the Aristotlean view.

*c. 360 BCE: [[Plato]] - Coins term ‘[[element]]s’ (''stoicheia'') and in his dialogue [[Timaeus]], which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a rudimentary treatise on chemistry, assumes that the minute particle of each element had a special geometric shape: [[tetrahedron]] (fire), [[octahedron]] (air), [[icosahedron]] (water), and [[cube]] (earth).<ref>{{cite web | last = Hillar | first = Marian | year = 2004 | url = http://www.socinian.org/aristotles_de_anima.html | title = The Problem of the Soul in Aristotle's De anima | publisher = NASA WMAP | accessdate = 2006-08-10 }}</ref>   

*[[Image:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Aristotle 384-322BCE]]c. 350 BCE: [[Aristotle]] - Based on the ideas of Empedocles, proposes idea of a substance as a combination of ''matter'' and ''form''.  Describes theory of the [[Five Elements]] which is largely accepted throughout the western world for over 1000 years.

* 50 BCE: [[Lucretius]] - Publishes ''[[On the Nature of Things|De Rerum Natura]]'', a poetic description of the ideas of [[Atomism]].

*c. 300: [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] - wrote the oldest known books on [[alchemy]], which he defined as the study of the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying and disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies.<ref>Strathern, P. (2000). ''Mendeleyev’s Dream – the Quest for the Elements.'' New York: Berkley Books.</ref>

*c. 900: [[Al Razi|Abū Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakarīya al-Rāzi]] (aka Rhazes) - Publishes several treatises on [[alchemy]], including some of the earliest descriptions of controlled distillation and extraction methods.  He also developed early method for the production of [[sulfuric acid]].

*c. 1220: [[Robert Grosseteste]] - Publishes several Aristotelian commentaries where he lays out an early framework for the Scientific Method.

*c. 1265: [[Roger Bacon]] - Publishes ''Opus Maius'', which among other things, proposes an early form of the Scientific Method, and contains results of his experiments with [[gunpowder]].

*1941: [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] - Takes over McMillan's work creating new atomic nuclei.  Pioneers method of [[neutron capture]] and later through other [[nuclear reactions]].  Would become the principal or co-discoverer of nine new chemical elements, and dozens of new isotopes of existing elements. <ref name=seaborg/>

*1945: [[Jacob A. Marinsky]], [[Lawrence E. Glendenin]], and [[Charles D. Coryell]] - First confirmed synthesis of [[Promethium]], filling in the last "gap" in the periodic table.

*1945-1946: [[Felix Bloch]] and [[Edward Mills Purcell]] - Discovers the process of [[Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]], an [[analytical chemistry|analytical]] technique important in elucidating structures of molecules, especially in [[organic chemistry]].

*c. 1950: [[Alan Walsh]] - Pioneered the field of [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]], an important [[quantitative]] spectroscopy method that allows one to measure specific concentrations of a material in a mixture.

*1951: Linus Pauling - Use of X-ray crystalography to deduce the [[secondary structure]] of proteins.

*1952: [[Robert Burns Woodward]], [[Geoffrey Wilkinson]], and [[Ernst Otto Fischer]] - Discover the structure of [[ferrocene]], leading to a boom in the field of [[organometallic chemistry]].

*1953: [[James D. Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] - Propose the structure of [[DNA]], opening the door to the field of [[molecular biology]].

*1958: [[Max Perutz]] and [[Sir John Cowdery Kendrew]] - First use of X-ray crystallography to elucidate a [[protein]] structure, specifically [[Sperm Whale]] [[myoglobin]].

*1962: [[Neil Bartlett]] - Synthesizes [[xenon hexafluoroplatinate]], showing for the first time that the noble gases can form chemical compounds.

*1965: Linus Pauling - Proposes the '''Close-Packed Spheron Model''' of the atomic nucleus as a means to explain the specific organization of the atomic nucleus.

*1965: [[Robert Burns Woodward]] and [[Roald Hoffmann]] - Use the symmetry of [[molecular orbital]]s to explain the stereochemistry of chemical reactions (the [[Woodward-Hoffmann rules]]).

*1966: [[Franklin H. Field]] and [[M. S. Burnaby Munson]] - Develop [[chemical ionization]] [[mass spectrometry]], a soft ionization technique that reduced the amount of fragmentation observed during [[electron ionization]].

*1975-1976: [[Richard R. Ernst]] - Develops the technique of [[Fourier Transform]] NMR, greatly increasing the sensitivity of the technique, and opening the door for [[magnetic resonance imaging]] or MRI.

*[[Image:C60a.png|thumb|right|100px|Buckminsterfullerene, C<sub>60</sub>]]1985: [[Harold Kroto]], [[Robert Curl]] and [[Richard Smalley]] - Discovery of [[fullerenes]], a class of large carbon molecules superficially resembling the [[geodesic dome]] designed by architect [[R. Buckminster Fuller]].

*1991: [[Sumio Iijima]] - First practical production of a type of cylindrical fullerene known as a [[carbon nanotube]], though earlier work had been done in the field as early as 1951.

*1995: [[Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] - Produce the first [[Bose–Einstein condensate]], a substance that displays quantum mechanical properties on the macroscopic scale.
