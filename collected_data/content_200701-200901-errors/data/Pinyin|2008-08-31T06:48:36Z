'''Pinyin''', more formally '''''Hanyu Pinyin''''', is the most common [[Standard Mandarin]] [[romanization]] system in use. ''Hanyu'' means the [[Chinese language]]<ref name="Harbaugh">{{cite web|url=http://zhongwen.com/d/186/x126.htm|title=中文字普 (Chinese Characters: A Genealogy and Dictionary)|last=Harbaugh|first=Richard|date=1998|publisher=Zhongwen.com|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref>, and ''pinyin'' means "spell sound", or the spelling of the sound.<ref name="Harbaugh"/> Developed by a government committee in the [[People's Republic of China]] in the 1950s, Pinyin was adopted as the international standard in 1979.  It is now used to teach Chinese schoolchildren and foreign learners the standard pronunciation of [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]], to spell Chinese names in foreign publications and to enter [[Chinese character|Chinese characters]] on computers.



==History==
In 1954, the Ministry of Education of the PRC assigned a Committee (Committee for the Reform of the Chinese Written Language) to reform the written language. This committee developed ''Hanyu Pinyin'' based upon existing systems of that time ([[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] of 1928, [[Latinxua Sin Wenz]] of 1931, it uses the diacritic markings from [[Zhuyin]])<ref>Zou Minglang & Sun Hongkai, ''Language Policy In The People's Republic Of China: Theory And Practice Since 1949'', 2004, p.23</ref>. The main force behind pinyin was [[Zhou Youguang]] (born 1905, turning 103 in 2008 in good health).<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/feb/20/zhaou.youguang.pinyin Film clip about Zhou Youguang, the "Father of pinyin".]</ref> <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/21/china Accompanying article to the Guardian video of 20 February 2008.]</ref> Zhou Youguang was working in a New York bank when he decided to return to China to help rebuild the country after the war. He became an economics professor in [[Shanghai]]. The government assigned him to help the development of a new romanisation system. The switch to language and writing largely saved him from the wrath of the [[Cultural Revolution]] of [[Mao Zedong]]. 

A first draft was published on [[February 12]] [[1956]]. The first edition of ''Hanyu Pinyin'' was approved and adopted at the Fifth Session of the [[1st National People's Congress]] on [[February 11]] [[1958]]. It was then introduced to primary schools as a way to teach [[Standard Mandarin]] [[pronunciation]], and used to improve the literacy rate among adults. In 2001, the Chinese Government issued the ''National Common Language Law'', providing a legal basis for applying pinyin.<ref>'Hanyu Pinyin system turns 50', ''[[Straits Times]]'' [[February 11]], [[2008]]</ref>

The correspondence between letter and sound does not follow any single other language, but does not depart any more from the norms of the Latin alphabet than many European languages. For example, the aspiration distinction between ''b, d, g'' and ''p, t, k'' is similar to that of English, but not to that of French. ''Z'' and ''c'' also have that distinction; however, they are pronounced as [ts], as in languages such as German, Italian, and Polish, which do not have that distinction. From ''s, z, c'' come the digraphs ''sh, zh, ch'' by analogy with English ''sh, ch;'' although this introduces the novel combination ''zh,'' it is internally consistent in how the two series are related, and represents the fact that many Chinese pronounce ''sh, zh, ch'' as ''s, z, c.'' In the ''x, j, q'' series, ''x'' rather resembles its pronunciation in Catalan, though ''q'' is more novel. Pinyin [[vowels]] are pronounced similarly to vowels in [[Romance languages]]. More information on the pronunciation of all pinyin letters in terms of English approximations is given further below.
{{IPA notice}}
The pronunciation of Chinese is generally given in terms of [[initial (linguistics)|initials]] and [[final (linguistics)|finals]], which represent the ''segmental phonemic'' portion of the language. Initials are initial consonants, while finals are all possible combinations of [[medial (linguistics)|medials]] ([[semivowel]]s coming before the vowel), the [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] vowel, and [[syllable coda|coda]] (final vowel or consonant).

For a complete table of all pinyin syllables, see [[pinyin table]].

==Usage==

''Hanyu Pinyin'' superseded older romanization systems such as [[Wade-Giles]] (1859; modified 1892) and [[Chinese Postal Map Romanization]], and replaced [[Zhuyin]] as the method of Chinese phonetic instruction in [[mainland China]]. ''Hanyu Pinyin'' was adopted in 1979 by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) as the standard romanization for modern Chinese (ISO-7098:1991). It has also been accepted by the [[Government of Singapore]], the [[Library of Congress]], the [[American Library Association]], and many other international institutions. It has also become a useful tool for [[Chinese input methods for computers|entering Chinese language text into computers]].

The spelling of Chinese geographical or personal names in pinyin has become a standard or most common way to transcribe them in English.

Chinese speaking Standard Mandarin at home use pinyin to help children associate characters with spoken words which they already know; however, for the many Chinese who do not use Standard Mandarin at home, pinyin is used to teach them the [[Standard Mandarin]] pronunciation of words when they learn them in [[elementary school]].

Pinyin has become a tool for many foreigners to learn the Mandarin pronunciation, it is used to explain the grammar and spoken Mandarin together with [[Chinese character|hanzi]]. Like [[zhuyin fuhao]] it is used as a phonetic guide in books for children but also dialect speakers and foreign learners. Books containing both Chinese characters and pinyin are popular with foreign learners of Chinese, pinyin's role in teaching pronunciation to foreigners and children is similar to [[furigana]]-based books (with [[hiragana]] letters written above or next to [[kanji]]) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or fully [[Harakat|vocalised]] texts in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ("vocalised Arabic") but as mentioned above, pinyin is also the main romanisation method.

==Initials and Finals==

Unlike in European languages, initials ({{zh-st|s=声母|t=聲母}}) and finals ({{zh-st|s=韵母|t=韻母}}, or rhyming sounds) - and not consonants and vowels - are the fundamental elements in Pinyin (and most other phonetic systems used to describe the Han language).  Nearly each Chinese syllable can be spelled with exactly one initial followed by one final, except in the special syllable 'er' and when a trailing 'r' is considered part of a syllable (see below).  The latter case, though a common practice in some sub-dialects, is rarely used in official publications.<ref name="trailing r">Exception can be found in 'Harbin' ({{zh-st|s=哈尔滨|t=哈爾濱}}), a name that came from a then foreign/minority language.</ref>

Even though most initials contain a consonant, finals are not simple vowels,<ref>In this article, there are still references to "vowels" when the actual subject is "finals".  This should be carefully clarified.</ref> especially in compound finals ({{zh-st|s=复韵母|t=復韻母}}), i.e., when one "final" is placed in front of another one.  For example, [i] and [u] are pronounced with such tight openings that some native Chinese speakers (especially when singing or on stage) pronounce yī ({{zh-st|s=衣|t=衣}}, clothes, officially pronounced as {{IPA|/i/}}) as {{IPA|/ji/}}, wéi ({{zh-st|s=围|t=圍}}, to enclose, officially as {{IPA|/uei/}}) as {{IPA|/wei/}} or {{IPA|/wuei/}}.  The concepts of consonants and vowels are not incorporated in Pinyin or its predecessors, despite the fact that the Roman alphabets are used in Pinyin.  In the entire Pinyin system, there is not a list of consonants, nor a list of vowels.<ref name="pinyin schema">[http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B1%89%E8%AF%AD%E6%8B%BC%E9%9F%B3 汉语拼音方案]</ref>

Other than finals modified by an -r, which are omitted, the following is an exhaustive table of all possible finals. <sup>1</sup>

The only syllable-final consonants in standard Mandarin are -n and -ng, and -r which is attached as a grammatical suffix. Chinese syllables ending with any other consonant is either from a non-Mandarin language (southern Chinese languages such as Cantonese, or minority languages of China), or it indicates the use of a non-pinyin Romanization system (where final consonants may be used to indicate tones).

<sup>1</sup> /ər/ (而, 二, etc.) is written as ''er''. For other finals formed by the suffix -r, pinyin does not use special orthography; one simply appends -r to the final that it is added to, without regard for any sound changes that may take place along the way. For information on sound changes related to final -r, please see [[Standard Mandarin]].<br />

|-
||''k''|| {{IPA|[kʰ]}}|| aspirated '''k''', as in '''k'''ill
|-
||''h''|| {{IPA|[x]}}|| like the English '''h''' if followed by "a"; otherwise it is pronounced more roughly (not unlike the [[Scots language|Scots]] '''ch''' or Russian '''х''' (Cyrillic "kha")).
|-
||''j''|| {{IPA|[tɕ]}}||  like ''q'', but unaspirated. (To get this sound, first take the sound halfway between '''j'''oke and '''ch'''eck, and then slowly pass it backwards along the tongue until it is entirely clear of the tongue tip.)  While this exact sound is not used in English, the closest match is the '''j''' in a'''j'''ar, not the '''s''' in A'''s'''ia.
|-
||''q''|| {{IPA|[tɕʰ]}}|| like '''ch'''urch; pass it backwards along the tongue until it is free of the tongue tip. In Mandarin pronunciation should not be confused with "ch" but in English both "ch" and "q" are often pronounced the same.
|-
||''x''|| {{IPA|[ɕ]}}|| like '''sh''' or palatalised '''s''', but take the sound and pass it backwards along the tongue until it is clear of the tongue tip; very similar to the final sound in [[German language|German]] i'''ch''', and to '''h'''uge or '''H'''ugh in some English dialects. The combination "xi" is very similar both to the Russian '''си''' or the Japanese '''し'''.
|-
||''zh''|| {{IPA|[ʈʂ]}}|| '''ch''' with no aspiration (a sound between '''j'''oke and '''ch'''urch, tongue tip curled more upwards); very similar to mer'''g'''er in American English, but not voiced

|-
||''r''|| {{IPA|[ʐ]}} or {{IPA|[ɻ]}}|| Similar to the English '''r''' in '''r'''ank, but with the lips spread and with the tongue curled upwards. The initial "r" can also be described as French "j" [ʒ] or a cross between English "r" and French "j". In [[Cyrillization of Chinese from pinyin|Cyrillised Chinese]] the same sound is always rendered with letter "ж" (French "j").
|-
||''z''|| {{IPA|[ts]}}|| unaspirated '''c''' (something between su'''ds''' and ca'''ts''')

This use of "w" is a spelling convention, to disambiguate syllable breaks when such "u-" words follow other words. As a spelling convention, it does ''not'' actually alter the pre-replacement pronunciation.
|-
||''y''||  {{IPA|[i]}}|| case 1) Note that "y" is ''not'' pronounced as a "y", rather it is pronounced as the "i" (pinyin-pronounced) that it replaced. i.e. "y" replaces "i" in words starting with "i" (no initial / final only). This use of "y" is a spelling convention, to disambiguate syllable breaks when such "i-" words follow other words. As a spelling convention, it does ''not'' actually alter the original pronunciation. 

case 2) Similarly, note that "yu" is ''not'' pronounced as a "yu", rather it is pronounced as the (pinyin-pronounced) "ü" that it replaced. i.e. "yu" replaces "ü" in words starting with "ü" (no initial / final only). This use of "yu" is a spelling convention, to disambiguate syllable breaks when such "ü-" words follow other words and due to historical type and font set limitations.  As a spelling convention, it does not actually alter the original pronunciation.

===Pronunciation of finals===
The following is an exhaustive list of all finals in [[Standard Mandarin]].  Those ending with a final '''-r''' are listed at the end.

To find a given final:
#Remove the initial consonant. For zh-, ch-, sh-, both letters should be removed, they are single consonants spelt with two letters.
#Although y- and w- are consonants nevertheless they may be considered as part of finals and do not remove those.
##Syllables beginning with y- and w- may be considered as standalone forms of finals "i, u, ü" and finals beginning with "i-, u-, ü-".
#If a syllable begins with j-, q-, x-, or y-, and the final is -u or starts with -u-, then change -u or -u- to -ü or -ü-.

== Orthography ==
===Letters===
Pinyin differs from other romanizations in several aspects, such as the following:

* Syllables starting with ''u'' are written as ''w'' in place of ''u'' (e.g. ''ueng'' is written as ''weng''). Standalone ''u'' is written as ''wu''.
* Syllables starting with ''i'' are written as ''y'' in place of ''i'' (e.g. ''iou'' is written as ''you''). Standalone ''i'' is written as ''yi''.
* Syllables starting with ''ü'' are written as ''yu'' in place of ''ü'' (e.g. ''üe'' is written as ''yue'').
* ''ü'' is written as ''u'' when there is no ambiguity (such as ''ju'', ''qu'', and ''xu''), but written as ''ü'' when there are corresponding ''u'' syllables (such as ''lü'' and ''nü'').  In such situations where there are corresponding ''u'' syllables, it is often replaced with ''v'' on a computer, making it easier to type on a standard keyboard.
* When preceded by a consonant, ''iou'', ''uei'', and ''uen'' are simplified as ''iu'', ''ui'', and ''un'' (which do not represent the actual pronunciation).
* As in [[zhuyin|zhùyīn]], what are actually pronounced as ''buo'', ''puo'', ''muo'', and ''fuo'' are given a separate representation: ''bo'', ''po'', ''mo'', and ''fo''.
* The [[apostrophe]] (') is often used before ''a'', ''o'', and ''e'' to separate syllables in a word where ambiguity could arise, especially when omitting tone marks, e.g., ''pi'ao'' ({{zh-st|s=皮袄|t=皮襖}}) vs. ''piao'' (票), and ''[[Xi'an]]'' (西安) vs. ''xian'' (先).
* ''[[Eh#Similar terms in other languages|Eh]]'' alone is written as ''ê''; elsewhere as ''e''. [[Schwa]] is always written as ''e''.
* ''zh'', ''ch'', and ''sh'' can be abbreviated as ''ẑ'', ''ĉ'', and ''ŝ'' (''z'', ''c'', ''s'' with a [[circumflex]]). However, the shorthands are rarely used due to difficulty of entering them on computers.
* ''ng'' has the uncommon shorthand of ''[[ŋ]]''.
* The letter ''v'' is unused （except in spelling foreign languages, languages of minority nationalities, and some dialects<ref name="pinyin alphabets">[http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B1%89%E8%AF%AD%E6%8B%BC%E9%9F%B3#.E5.AD.97.E6.AF.8D.E8.A1.A8 汉语拼音字母表]</ref>), despite a conscious effort to distribute letters more evenly than in Western languages. 

Most of the above are used to avoid ambiguity when writing words of more than one syllable in pinyin.  For example uenian is written as ''wenyan'' because it is not clear which syllables make up ''uenian''; ''uen-ian'', ''uen-i-an'' and ''u-en-i-an'' are all possible combinations whereas ''wenyan'' is unambiguous because ''we'', ''nya'', etc. do not exist in pinyin. A summary of possible pinyin syllables (not including tones), can be reviewed at: [[pinyin table]]

===Capitalization and word formation===
[[Image:E7918-Dordoy-Bazaar-blankets.jpg|thumb|Many writers are not yet aware of the rules for dividing text into words by spaces, and either put a space after each syllable, or run all words together. The manufacturer of these blankets put unnecessary spaces into  'Bishikaike' (the correct pinyin for [[:zh:比什凯克|比什凯克]], '[[Bishkek]]') - but wrote the English text on top with no spaces at all.]]
Although Chinese characters represent single syllables, Mandarin Chinese is a [[polysyllabic]] language.  Spacing in pinyin is based on whole words, not single syllables.  However, there are often ambiguities in partitioning a word.  Orthographic rules were put into effect in 1988 by the National Educational Commission (国家教育委员会, [[pinyin]]: ''Guójiā Jiàoyù Wěiyuánhuì )'' and the National Language Commission (国家语言文字工作委员会, [[pinyin]]: ''Guójiā Yǔyán Wénzì Gōngzuò Wěiyuánhuì).''

== Tones ==
[[Image:Pinyin Tone Chart.svg|right|thumb|115px|Relative pitch changes of the four tones]]
The pinyin system also uses [[diacritic]]s for the four [[Standard Mandarin#Tones|tones of Mandarin]], usually above a non-medial [[vowel]].  Many books printed in China mix fonts, with vowels and tone marks rendered in a different font than the surrounding text, tending to give such pinyin texts a typographically ungainly appearance. This style, most likely rooted in early technical limitations, has led many to believe that pinyin's rules call for this practice and also for the use of "{{Unicode|ɑ}}" (with no curl over the top) rather than the standard style of the letter "{{Unicode|a}}" found in most fonts. The official rules of ''Hanyu Pinyin,'' however, specify no such practice. Note that tone marks can also appear on consonants in certain vowelless exclamations.

# The first tone (Flat or High Level Tone) is represented by a [[macron]] (ˉ) added to the pinyin vowel:
#:<br/><span style="font-size: 20pt;">{{Unicode|ā (ɑ&#772;) ē ī ō ū ǖ Ā Ē Ī Ō Ū Ǖ}}</span>
# The second tone (Rising or High-Rising Tone) is denoted by an [[acute accent]] (ˊ):
#:<br/><span style="font-size: 20pt;">{{Unicode|á (ɑ&#769;) é í ó ú ǘ Á É Í Ó Ú Ǘ}}</span>
# The third tone (Falling-Rising or Low Tone) is marked by a [[caron]]/háček (ˇ). It is not the rounded [[breve]] (˘), though a breve is sometimes substituted due to font limitations.  
#:<br/><span style="font-size: 20pt;">{{Unicode|ǎ (ɑ̌) ě ǐ ǒ ǔ ǚ Ǎ Ě Ǐ Ǒ Ǔ Ǚ}}</span>
# The fourth tone (Falling or High-Falling Tone) is represented by a [[grave accent]] (ˋ):
#:<br/><span style="font-size: 20pt;">{{Unicode|à (ɑ&#768;) è ì ò ù ǜ À È Ì Ò Ù Ǜ}}</span>
# The fifth or neutral tone (Neutral Tone) is represented by a normal vowel without any accent mark: 
#:<br/><span style="font-size: 20pt;">{{Unicode|a (ɑ) e i o u ü A E I O U Ü}}</span>
:(In some cases, this is also written with a dot before the syllable; for example, ·ma.)

These tone marks normally are only used in Mandarin textbooks or in foreign learning texts, but they are essential for correct pronunciation of Mandarin syllables, as exemplified by the following classic example of five characters whose pronunciations differ only in their tones:
{| class="wikitable" align="center"
||

Traditional characters:

{{Ruby-big|媽|mā}}
{{Ruby-big|麻|má}}
{{Ruby-big|馬|mǎ}}
{{Ruby-big|罵|mà}}
{{Ruby-big|嗎|·ma}}

Simplified characters:

{{Ruby-big|妈|mā}}
{{Ruby-big|麻|má}}
{{Ruby-big|马|mǎ}}
{{Ruby-big|骂|mà}}
{{Ruby-big|吗|·ma}}
||
{{Listen|filename=Zh-pinyin_tones_with_ma.ogg |title=mā má mǎ mà |description=A sound sample of the four tones}}
|}

The words are "mother", "hemp", "horse", "scold" and a question particle, respectively.

===Numerals in place of tone marks===
Since before the advent of computers, many fonts did not contain vowels with macron or caron diacritics, a common convention for tone is to add a [[tone number]] at the end of individual syllables.  For example, ''tóng'' is written ''tong2.'' 
The number used for each tone is as the order listed above (except the neutral tone, which is either not numbered or numbered zero, as in ''ma0'' 吗/嗎 (an [[interrogative]] marker).

===Rules for placing the tone mark<ref>"Vowels" in this section actually refers to "finals"; specifically, simple finals ({{zh-st|s=单韵母|t=單韻母}}).  The word "vowel" is not used in official Chinese publications.</ref>===
The rules for determining on which vowel the tone mark appears when there are multiple vowels are as follows:
# If there is more than one vowel and the first vowel is ''i'', ''u'', or ''ü'', then the tone mark appears on the last vowel.<ref>[http://www.pinyin.info/rules/where.html pinyin tone mark placement<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="pinyin tones">{{zh icon}} [[:zh:汉语拼音方案#声调|汉语拼音方案:声调]], ''[[Chinese Wikipedia]]''</ref>
# In all other cases, the tone mark appears on the vowels in this order: a, o, e. 

(''y'' and ''w'' are not considered vowels for these rules.)

The reasoning behind these rules is in the case of [[diphthong]]s and [[triphthong]]s, ''i'', ''u'', and ''ü'' (and their orthographic equivalents ''y'' and ''w'' when there is no initial consonant) are considered [[medial (linguistics)|medial]] glides rather than part of the [[syllable nucleus]] in Chinese [[phonology]]. The rules ensure that the tone mark always appears on the nucleus of a syllable.

Another algorithm for determining the vowel on which the tone mark appears is as follows:

# First, look for an "a" or an "e". If either vowel appears, it takes the tone mark. There are no possible pinyin syllables that contain both an "a" and an "e".
# If there is no "a" or "e", look for an "ou". If "ou" appears, then the "o" takes the tone mark.
# If none of the above cases hold, then the last vowel in the syllable takes the tone mark.

== The character "ü" ==
An [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] is placed over the letter ''u'' when it occurs after the initials ''l'' and ''n'' in order to represent the sound [y].  This is necessary in order to distinguish the front high rounded vowel in ''lü'' (e.g. 驴/驢 donkey) from the back high rounded vowel in ''lu'' (e.g. 炉/爐 oven).  Tonal markers are added on top of the umlaut, as in ''lǘ''.

However, the ''ü'' is ''not'' used in other contexts where it represents a front high rounded vowel, namely after the letters ''j'', ''q'', ''x'' and ''y''.  For example, the sound of the word 鱼/魚 (fish) is transcribed in pinyin simply as ''yú'', not as ''yǘ''. This practice is opposed to [[Wade-Giles]], which always uses ''ü'', and ''[[Tongyong Pinyin]],'' which always uses ''yu''.  Whereas Wade-Giles needs to use the umlaut to distinguish between ''chü'' (pinyin ''ju'') and ''chu'' (pinyin ''zhu''), this ambiguity cannot arise with pinyin, so the more convenient form ''ju'' is used instead of ''jü''.  Genuine ambiguities only happen with ''nu''/''nü'' and ''lu''/''lü'', which are then distinguished by an umlaut diacritic.

Many fonts or output methods do not support an umlaut for ''ü'' or cannot place tone marks on top of ''ü''.  Likewise, using ''ü'' in input methods is difficult because it is not present as a simple key on many keyboard layouts.  For these reasons ''v'' is sometimes used instead by convention.  Occasionally, ''uu'' (double ''u''), ''u:'' (''u'' followed by a colon) or ''U'' (capital ''u'') is used in its place.

==Pinyin in Taiwan==
[[Taiwan]] adopted ''[[Tongyong Pinyin]]'' on the national level in October 2002. ''Tongyong Pinyin'' is a modified version of ''Hanyu Pinyin.'' The adoption of ''Tongyong Pinyin'' has also resulted in political controversy. Much of the controversy centered on issues of national identity, with proponents of [[Chinese reunification]] favoring the ''Hanyu Pinyin'' system which is used in the People's Republic of China, and proponents of Taiwanese independence favoring the use of ''Tongyong Pinyin.''{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Localities with governments controlled by the [[Kuomintang]], most notably [[Taipei City]], have overridden the 2002 administrative order and converted to ''Hanyu Pinyin'' (although with a slightly different capitalization convention than the Mainland). As a result, the use of romanization on signage in Taiwan is inconsistent, with many places using ''Tongyong Pinyin'' but some using ''Hanyu Pinyin,'' and still others not yet having had the resources to replace older [[Wade-Giles]] or [[MPS2]] signage. This has resulted in the odd situation in Taipei City in which inconsistent pinyin transcriptions are shown in freeway directions — with freeway signs, which are under the control of the national government, using one pinyin, but surface street signs, which are under the control of the city government, using the other.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Primary education continues to teach pronunciation using the [[zhuyin|zhùyīn]] system in Taiwan. Although the ROC government has stated the desire to use romanization rather than [[zhuyin|zhùyīn]] in education, the lack of agreement on which form of pinyin to use and the huge logistical challenge of teacher training has stalled these efforts.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Other languages==
Pinyin-like systems have been devised for other variants of Chinese. [[Guangdong Romanization]] is a set of romanizations devised by the government of [[Guangdong]] province for [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Hakka (linguistics)|Hakka]] ([[Moiyen dialect]]), and [[Hainan dialect|Hainanese]]. All of these are designed to use Latin letters in a similar way to pinyin.

In addition, in accordance to the ''Regulation of Phonetic Transcription in Hanyu Pinyin Letters of Place Names in Minority Nationality Languages'' (少数民族语地名汉语拼音字母音译转写法) promulgated in 1976, place names in non-Chinese languages like [[Mongol language|Mongol]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], and [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]] are also officially transcribed using pinyin. The pinyin letters (26 Roman letters, ü, ê) are used to approximate the non-Chinese language in question as closely as possible. This results in spellings that are different from both the customary spelling of the place name, and the pinyin spelling of the name in Chinese:

==Comparison with other orthographies==
Pinyin is now used by foreign students learning Chinese as a second language.

Pinyin assigns some [[Roman alphabet|Roman letters]] [[phonology|phonological]] values which are quite different from that of most languages. 

Pinyin is purely a representation of the sounds of Mandarin, therefore it lacks the [[semantic]] cues that [[Chinese character]]s can provide. It is also unsuitable for transcribing some [[Chinese spoken languages]] other than Mandarin.

Simple computer systems, able only to display only 7-bit [[ASCII]] text (essentially the 26 Latin letters, 10 digits and punctuation marks), long provided the most convincing argument in favor of pinyin over Hanzi.  Today, however, most computer systems are able to display characters from Chinese and many other writing systems as well, and have them entered with a Latin keyboard using an [[input method editor]]. Alternatively, some [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[Tablet pc|tablet PCs]] and [[digitizing tablet]]s allow users to input characters directly by writing with a [[stylus]].

The user can then type pinyin and tone marks using the alphanumeric keys on a standard keyboard; the popular [[:zh:紫光拼音输入法|Ziguang Pinyin IME]] is one such example. [http://www.chinese-forums.com/showthread.php?t=13005 Pinyinput] is a Windows-based IME that allows you to type toned pinyin with ease.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}  Because it works at the system level, it will allow you to type pinyin with tones in any Windows program just as easily as you would type Chinese (in fact even easier, because you don't need to select the correct character).  Activate the IME then start typing pinyin.  Type a number from 1-4 after a pinyin syllable, and the corresponding tone will automatically be placed on the correct vowel of that syllable.
