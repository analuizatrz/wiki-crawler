The '''New Plymouth Express''' was a passenger [[express train]] operated by the [[New Zealand Railways Department]] (NZR) between [[Wellington]] and [[New Plymouth]].  It ran from 1886 until 1955, was sometimes known as the '''New Plymouth Mail''' due to the Railway Travelling Post Office carriages included in its consist, and should not be confused with the [[New Plymouth Night Express]], which ran between [[Auckland]] and New Plymouth.  The New Plymouth Express is notable amongst NZR's provincial expresses as being both the first and, until the commencement of the [[Gisborne Express]] in 1942, the longest in distance travelled.<ref>J. D. Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'' (Palmerston North: Dominion Press, 1982), pg. 71.</ref>

== Introduction ==

On [[23 March]] [[1885]], NZR opened the [[railway]] line between [[Palmerston North]] and New Plymouth, with a short branch from [[Aramoho]] to [[Wanganui]].<ref>Geoffrey B. Churchman and Tony Hurst, ''The Railways of New Zealand: A Journey Through History'' (Wellington: Grantham House, 1991), pp. 132, 136.</ref>  A year and a half later, on [[3 November]] [[1886]], the privately-owned [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company]] opened its route from Wellington to [[Longburn]], a small village just south of Palmerston North, where it interchanged with NZR.<ref>Churchman and Hurst, ''The Railways of New Zealand'', pg. 165.</ref>  This allowed a direct train to be run between Wellington and New Plymouth; this also formed part of a newer, quicker route to Auckland through connections with [[steamship|steamers]] between New Plymouth and Auckland's [[Onehunga]] Wharf.<ref>Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pg. 71.</ref>

== Operation ==

The earliest incarnation of the New Plymouth Express took 14 hours and 50 minutes to complete its journey,<ref>Churchman and Hurst, ''The Railways of New Zealand'', pg. 132.</ref> with a change of trains at Longburn.  It ran twice weekly, its northbound run leaving the WMR's [[Thorndon]] station in Wellington at 7am on Tuesdays and Fridays,<ref>Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pg. 71.</ref>, with NZR's southbound service departing New Plymouth at the same time.  The two trains met at Longburn where they were turned before returning to their originating points.<ref>[http://www.jeffpylenz.com/Jeffs-blog/ARCHIVES/RAILWAY/postmark%20Taranaki.htm Postmark Taranaki - Mails by Rail], paragraphs 4-5</ref>  Although the WMR introduced [[dining car]]s not long after it began operating, NZR did not initially have them and refreshment stops were made at [[Halcombe]] and [[Patea]].<ref>Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pg. 71.</ref>

In 1901, NZR and the WMR co-operated to quicken the train's schedule by eliminating the change of trains at Longburn.  By this stage, the train ran every day except Sunday, and on four days a week NZR's train ran all the way through to Wellington, while on the other two days the WMR's train ran to New Plymouth.<ref>Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pg. 72.</ref>  This cut the travelling time down to 12 hours and 50 minutes,<ref>Churchman and Hurst, ''The Railways of New Zealand'', pg. 132.</ref> and in 1902, NZR eliminated refreshment stops by introducing dining cars of its own.  The New Plymouth Express was the second train in New Zealand to be equipped with dining cars, after the [[South Express]], and thus the first in the [[North Island]].<ref>Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pg. 72.</ref>

On [[7 December]] [[1908]] the WMR was acquired by NZR, although the already established practice of through running meant this acquisition had little effect on the New Plymouth Express, except for some changes to the Railway Travelling Post Office and the north- and southbound trains crossing at [[Marton, New Zealand|Marton]] rather than Longburn.<ref>[http://www.jeffpylenz.com/Jeffs-blog/ARCHIVES/RAILWAY/postmark%20Taranaki.htm Postmark Taranaki - Mails by Rail], paragraph 10</ref>  A more dramatic change for the Express was the 1908 opening of the [[North Island Main Trunk Railway]], providing a more direct and quicker route between Wellington and Auckland than the combination of the New Plymouth Express and Onehunga steamship.  Another change was forced on the train in 1917 by restrictions due to [[World War I]]: refreshment stops were re-introduced when the dining cars were withdrawn, never to return.<ref>Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pg. 72.</ref>

In 1925, [[NZR Ab class|A<sup>B</sup> class]] [[steam locomotive]]s were allocated as new motive power for the New Plymouth Express, allowing its timetable to be quickened from 12 hours to 9 hours and 38 minutes.<ref>Churchman and Hurst, ''The Railways of New Zealand'', pg. 133.</ref>  Although it had always been augmented by slower [[mixed train]]s, the [[Taranaki Flyer]] was introduced in 1926 as an alternative service between Wanganui and New Plymouth, and in April 1938, the [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (Standard)|Standard]] [[railcar]]s began operating an evening service between Wellington and New Plymouth.  The railcars eventually took over from the Express, but not for almost two decades.  During the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] impacted the Express's loadings, reducing it from its former length of nine or ten carriages to only six, but as the economy improved, the Express's length expanded to eight or nine carriages by the start of [[World War II]], and it was equipped with the most modern carriages.  During the War, the Express's carriages were dispersed and it ran with a wide variety of rolling stock; this situation was not rectified until the train was re-equipped in 1948.<ref>Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pg. 75.</ref>  The Turakina Deviation on the [[Marton - New Plymouth Line]] opened in 1947, allowing the journey time to be reduced to 9.25 hours.<ref>Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pg. 79.</ref>

=== Motive power ===

The WMR typically operated the New Plymouth Express with its premier locomotives: [[NZR Oc class|No. 16]] and [[NZR Bc class|No. 17]] hauled the train over the hilly section between Wellington and [[Paekakariki]], sometimes [[bank engine|banked]] by [[NZR Wj class|No. 3 "Jumbo"]].  From Paekakariki to Longburn, [[NZR Ud class|Nos 19 and 20]] would took the train across the plains of the [[Kapiti Coast]] and [[Horowhenua]].  After the WMR was acquired by NZR, Nos 19 and 20 were classified as U<sup>D</sup> class and worked the train through to Marton for a few years before being replaced by [[NZR A class (1906)|A class]] locomotives.<ref>Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pg. 72.</ref>

[[Tank locomotive]]s were the primary motive power on the Marton - New Plymouth Line for many years.  These included members of the [[NZR Bb class|B<sup>B</sup>]], [[NZR E class (1872)|E]], [[NZR M class|M]], [[NZR Wa class|W<sup>A</sup>]], [[NZR Wb class|W<sup>B</sup>]], [[NZR Wd class|W<sup>D</sup>]], [[NZR Wf class|W<sup>F</sup>]], and [[NZR Ww class|W<sup>W</sup>]] classes at various times between 1886 and 1925.<ref>Churchman and Hurst, ''The Railways of New Zealand'', pp. 132-3, and Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pp. 72 and 74.</ref>  1925 saw the A<sup>B</sup> class introduced for the length of the train's journey, and in the late 1930s the [[NZR K class (1932)|K]] and [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]] classes were phased in, followed by the [[NZR Ja class|J<sup>A</sup> class]] after WWII.  The final regular steam hauled New Plymouth Express was hauled by J<sup>A</sup> 1289.<ref>Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pg. 79.</ref>

=== The Ferry ===

'''The Ferry''' was a short twice-daily passenger service between Wanganui and Aramoho on the main line, where the New Plymouth Express stopped.  During the era of the A<sup>B</sup> class working the New Plymouth Express, locomotives were changed at Aramoho and The Ferry was closely tied to this procedure.  The first Ferry of the day ran from Wanganui to Aramoho, where it met the southbound Express to Wellington.  The Ferry's A<sup>B</sup> and any carriages from Wanganui for Wellington were attached to the Express and the Express's A<sup>B</sup> and any New Plymouth carriages for Wanganui were detached.  The Express continued south while its original engine hauled The Ferry back to Wanganui.  This engine and The Ferry returned to Aramoho to meet the northbound Express to New Plymouth, and the engine and any Wanganui carriages for New Plymouth were attached to the Express after the Express's A<sup>B</sup> and any Wellington carriages for Wanganui were detached.  The Express then continued to New Plymouth, headed by the engine that had brought the southbound Express to Aramoho and the Ferry to Wanganui, while the engine from Wellington took the final Ferry of the day to Wanganui.<ref>Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pg. 75.</ref>

When the K and K<sup>A</sup> locomotives were introduced, The Ferry was retained.  However, in later years the locomotive change took place in Palmerston North, with the same locomotive running the train between New Plymouth and Palmerston North.  This eliminated the locomotive workings around which The Ferry was based, and it was replaced with a bus service.<ref>Mahoney, ''Kings of the Iron Road'', pg. 79.</ref>

== Replacement ==

The demise of the New Plymouth Express came in 1955. That year the [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater railcars]] were introduced, allowing Standard railcars to be redeployed and replace the Express.  This took effect on [[31 October]] [[1955]] and allowed the journey's schedule to be quickened to 7.25 hours.  As the 88-seater fleet expanded, they joined the Standards on the Wellington-New Plymouth run and operated it until [[17 December]] [[1972]].<ref>Tony Hurst, ''Farewell to Steam: Four Decades of Change on New Zealand Railways'' (Auckland: Harper Collins Publishers, 1995), pg. 71.</ref>  In 1968 three 88-seaters were extensively refurbished and renamed "Blue Streaks" because of their distinctive paint scheme, and in 1972 they were allocated to the Wellington-New Plymouth service.  The Blue Streaks operated the Express's former run while unrefurbished 88-seaters continued on the evening service, which was reduced to running on Fridays and Sundays.  The evening service was soon withdrawn, and the Blue Streaks were cancelled on [[30 July]] [[1977]].<ref>Churchman and Hurst, ''The Railways of New Zealand'', pg. 133.</ref>
