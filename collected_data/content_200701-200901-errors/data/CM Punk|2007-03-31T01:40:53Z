Before debuting in ECW, he was best known for his work on the [[independent circuit]], especially as a member of the [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) roster where he was a former [[ROH World Championship|ROH World Champion]], head trainer of the [[Ring of Honor#ROH wrestling school|wrestling school]] and was considered to be one of the three icons of ROH (along with [[Samoa Joe]] and [[Nelson Erazo|Homicide]]).<ref name="cruise">Originally a journal entry by [[Bobby Cruise]] for Ring of Honor available at [http://www.rohwrestling.com/latestnews.asp?intCategoryID=1&intArticleID=259 ROHwrestling.com] but the website has undergone a large maintenance and the journal entry was lost in the process.

==Career==
===Early career===
Punk's first venture into wrestling was a stint in a [[backyard wrestling]] federation called the "Lunatic Wrestling Federation" with his friends in the mid-late 1990s where he first started using the name CM Punk as part of the [[tag team]] the '''Chick Magnets''' along with CM Venom,<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="chickmagnets">{{cite web

Punk's home promotion for his early career is usually considered to be [[Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South|Independent Wrestling Association: Mid-South]] (IWA:Mid-South). During Punk's time in IWA:Mid-South he had high profile feuds with his friend Colt Cabana and [[Chris Hero]] and rose to the top of the roster winning the IWA Mid-South Light-Heavyweight Championship twice and the [[IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship]] on five separate occasions. Notably his feud with Hero included a 56-minute [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|TLC match]], a 93-minute [[two out of three falls match]] and several 60-minute draws.<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="wojick" /><ref name="joepunk" /> Punk's matches with Cabana led him to getting a job in [[Ring of Honor]].<ref name="wojick" /> During his time in IWA:Mid-South he would also meet, wrestle against and become a friend of [[Eddie Guerrero]].<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="wojick" /> From February 2003 until May 2004 Punk refused to wrestle for IWA:Mid-South, which Punk claims was in protest to [[Ian Rotten]]'s treatment of Chris Hero<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="beauty" />; however, Hero has stated he believes there were other reasons and Rotten's treatment of him was just an excuse by Punk to stop working for the company,<ref name="heroshoot">{{cite video | people = [[Chris Hero]] | url = http://www.rfvideo.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=2708 |title=Shoot with Chris Hero|medium = DVD|publisher = RF Video|year = 2005 }}</ref> but eventually he returned and continued to wrestle as well as be a commentator for IWA:Mid-South until 2005 when he was signed to [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]. His last appearance in IWA:Mid-South was on [[July 2]], [[2005]] in which he went to a thirty minute time limit draw against [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]] which went into overtime resulting in Delirious pinning Punk with a [[Pin (professional wrestling#Sunset flip|sunset flip]], during which his trunks were pulled down revealing his [[buttocks]] in a homage to [[Chris Candido]]. After the match was over he proceeded to give a farewell speech to the crowd.

===Ring of Honor and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===
[[Image:Punkcabana.jpg|thumb|171px|CM Punk with [[Scott Colton|Colt Cabana]] as the [[ROH World Tag Team Championship|ROH Tag Team Champions]], the first championship Punk won in [[Ring of Honor]].]]
Punk joined [[Ring of Honor]] initially as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], due to ROH employing a position with emphasis on wrestling and less on promos, but was quickly turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in a feud with [[Scott Levy|Raven]] that featured numerous variants of [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|no disqualification matches]]. At the same time Punk joined the wrestling promotion [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|NWA:Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], where he was paired with [[Brian Wohl|Julio Dinero]] as, ironically, members of [[Scott Levy|Raven]]'s TNA [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] '''[[Raven's Nest#The Gathering|The Gathering]]'''.

Punk started climbing the ranks of ROH with notable achievements including coming second at the at ''Second Anniversary'' show during the tournament to crown the first [[ROH Pure Championship|ROH Pure Champion]], losing to [[A.J. Styles]] in the finals, and winning the [[ROH World Tag Team Championship|ROH Tag Team Championship]] twice with Colt Cabana as the '''[[Second City Saints]]''', both times defeating [[Briscoe Brothers|The Briscoe Brothers]] to win the championship.

Meanwhile in TNA on [[February 25]], [[2004]] Punk had a physical scuffle with [[Teddy Hart]] that was broken up by [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] outside of a restaurant shortly before a TNA show stemming from an ROH show in which Hart performed [[Teddy Hart#Ring of Honor|three unplanned spots]] putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury. Despite popular belief, he was not released from TNA for this incident and it had no real consequences on his TNA career.<ref name="tna">{{cite web

}}</ref> According to Punk he stopped appearing on TNA after being informed by TNA officials that he and Dinero had not gotten over as [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], having turned on Raven becoming a tag team managed by their old rival [[James Mitchell (wrestler)|James Mitchell]], and so the [[Angle (professional wrestling)|angle]] had been put on hold.<ref name="tna" /> Punk ended ties with TNA during the [[Rob Feinstein]] controversy when TNA was pulling wrestlers from ROH, such as A.J. Styles and [[Christopher Daniels]], to break ties to Feinstein. Punk instead chose to quit TNA to continue to compete in and help ROH. His contract with TNA ran out almost a year later.

In ROH Punk faced off against [[ROH World Championship|ROH World Champion]] [[Samoa Joe]] for the championship in a famous three match series. The first match, on [[June 12]], [[2004]] at ''World Title Classic'' in [[Dayton, Ohio]], resulted in a 60 minute time-limit draw when neither Punk nor Joe could pin or cause the other to submit in the sixty minutes. The second match between Samoa Joe and CM Punk was planned to have occurred on [[December 4]], [[2004]] but because [[Steve Corino]] was pulled from a match with Samoa Joe by [[Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX|Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE]] the second match was hastily rescheduled on [[October 11]], [[2004]] for [[October 16]] in Punk's hometown of [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name="joepunk" /> At ''Joe vs. Punk II'' on [[October 16]] they wrestled to a second 60 minute draw. In addition to becoming Ring of Honor's best selling DVD at that point, the match received the first 5-star rating by [[Dave Meltzer]]'s ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'' for a match in North America since 1997.<ref name="joepunk" /> Joe ended the series by defeating Punk in the third and final match on [[December 4]], 2004 at ''All-Star Extravaganza II'' in which there was a no time limit stipulation.

[[Image:Punkrohchampion.jpg|thumb|left|175px|CM Punk holding the [[ROH World Championship]] at ''Death Before Dishonor III'' during his confrontation with [[Christopher Daniels]].]]
In June 2005, Punk accepted a deal with [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], after wrestling try-out matches on its ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night HEAT]]'' show. Even though he had accepted the deal, Punk went on to defeat [[Austin Aries]] to win the [[ROH World Championship]] on [[June 18]], [[2005]] at ''Death Before Dishonor III'' with the [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pepsi Plunge]].

Immediately after the match Punk proceeded to [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turn]] heel and started an angle where he threatened to bring the ROH World Championship to WWE with him. For weeks, Punk teased the ROH locker room and the ROH fans as well as mocking the championship he possessed, going so far as to sign his WWE contract on it. A notable part of this angle was [[Mick Foley]] making several ROH appearances, attempting to convince Punk to do the right thing and defend the title on his way out.

On [[August 12]], [[2005]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]] Punk lost the ROH World Championship to [[Jamie Noble|James Gibson]] in a four corner elimination match consisting of himself, Gibson, [[Samoa Joe]] and [[Christopher Daniels]], who re-debuted after a year and half long absence following the Rob Feinstein controversy a few minutes after Punk turned heel, when Gibson countered the Pepsi Plunge with a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Super|Super]] [[Powerbomb#Double underhook powerbomb|Tiger Bomb]]. His final match in Ring of Honor took place on [[August 13]], [[2005]] against Colt Cabana in a 2 out of 3 falls match, which he lost. In his last match, he was visibly crying, and was showered with streamers when he posed in the middle of the ring.

Punk reappeared at the ROH show ''Unscripted II'' on [[February 11]], [[2006]], due to a severe snowstorm which prevented several ROH wrestlers from attending. Punk asked for permission from WWE official Tommy Dreamer to appear so he could help out ROH. Dreamer approved and Punk appeared during the night to fill gaps where others were supposed to appear. In the main event, he teamed with [[Bryan Danielson]] to wrestle and ultimately defeat Jimmy Rave and Adam Pearce.

===Ohio Valley Wrestling===
Punk was assigned to [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]], a WWE developmental territory. On [[September 26]], [[2005]] in his OVW television debut, Punk suffered a ruptured eardrum and broken nose at the hands of [[Danny Inferno]], after he was hit by an [[Botch (professional wrestling)|overly]] [[Stiff (professional wrestling)|stiff]] [[Punch (strike)|right hand]]. Despite the injury, Punk finished the match and quickly recovered.

On [[November 9]], [[2005]], Punk became the [[OVW Television Championship|OVW Television Champion]] after defeating [[Ken Doane]]. This led immediately to a feud between Punk and [[Brent Albright]], who had previously been feuding with Doane for the television championship and had lost his chance to wrestle Doane after Punk had hit him with a chair so he himself could wrestle Doane. This led to a series of matches, including one which ended in overtime with Albright having Punk submit to Albright's finisher, the [[Professional wrestling holds#Fujiwara armbar|Crowbar]], however Punk was able to keep the championship as he had not agreed to the extra time. On [[January 4]], [[2006]], Punk lost the OVW Television Championship during a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|three way dance]] between himself, Albright and Doane. Doane was injured halfway through the match and could not continue and was replaced by [[Aaron Stevens (wrestler)|Aaron "The Idol" Stevens]]. Punk submitted to Albright's Crowbar and was eliminated but after interference by Punk, Stevens was able to get the [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)|pin]] on Albright to become the new OVW Television Champion.
[[Image:Punkwinsovw.jpg|thumb|146px|CM Punk after winning the [[OVW Heavyweight Championship]], ending his long feud with [[Brent Albright]].]]
The feud continued after a short period in which Albright and Punk were a tag team, but they became opponents again after Albright wanted the respect of Punk who would never give it to him and instead proceeded to "punk out" (get the better of) Albright repeatedly. This continued for weeks with Punk always getting the better of Albright until a [[Turn (professional wrestling)|double turn]] occurred on [[February 1]], [[2006]] when Albright turned heel during a tag match allowing [[The Spirit Squad]] to beat Punk and, in doing so, turning Punk [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]].

During this time CM Punk had a minor appearance at [[WrestleMania 22]] on [[April 2]], [[2006]] as one of the [[gangster]]s who rode a 1930s era car to the ring before [[John Cena]]'s entrance.

When [[Matt Cappotelli]] vacated the [[OVW Heavyweight Championship]] due to a brain tumor, a tournament was held to crown a new champion. The finals were Brent Albright vs CM Punk with Albright defeating Punk to become the new champion. Punk and Albright continued their feud with Albright becoming more and more unstable and paranoid about maintaining his championship after several close call matches against Punk, resulting in acts such as threatening [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]]. On [[May 3]], [[2006]], Punk finally defeated Brent Albright in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Texas Bullrope match|strap match]] to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship. As champion, Punk retained the title in matches against opponents such as [[Shad Gaspard]].

On [[July 28]], [[2006]] Punk and [[Seth Skyfire]] defeated Shad Gaspard and [[Jayson Paul|the Neighborhoodie]] ([[Cryme Tyme|the Gang Stars]]) to win the [[OVW Southern Tag Team Championship]] at a [[house show]]. With the victory Punk became the second OVW wrestler to have held each of the promotion's three championships, following Brent Albright, and along with Skyfire the first to hold two championships simultaneously. They would lose the Tag Team Championship on [[August 2]], [[2006]] to [[Jimmy Snuka, Jr.|Deuce Shade]] and [[Cliff Compton|Dice Domino]] after an injured Skyfire tagged in an already injured Punk.

This lead to a feud between Punk and Skyfire after a rematch for the Tag Team Championship on [[August 7]], [[2006]] in which a healthy Punk purposefully tagged in an injured Skyfire to be beaten by [[Deuce 'N Domino]]. On [[August 30]], [[2006]] a match was scheduled to take place between Punk and Skyfire for the OVW Heavyweight Championship however prior to the match Skyfire was attacked by [[Charles Evans|Charles "The Hammer" Evans]], who Skyfire had also been feuding with, and was replaced in the match by [[Chet Jablonski|Chet the Jet]] who pinned Punk to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship. As he no longer possessed the championship OVW no longer required him so he was removed from the roster and brought up to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] roster full time.

Punk made a surprise guest appearance on the [[December 16]], [[2006]] edition of OVW TV, teaming with Fearless Jack Bull in a tag team match against Joey Mercury and Aaron "The Idol" Stevens.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling===
On [[June 24]], [[2006]] Punk made his [[Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW]] debut during a [[house show]] at the former [[New Alhambra Arena|ECW Arena]], defeating [[Stevie Richards]]. He made his TV debut on the [[July 4]] episode of ''ECW on [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi]]'', cutting a brief [[Vignette (professional wrestling)|pre-taped]] [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promo]] about his straight edge lifestyle emphasizing the disciplinary aspects of being drug and alcohol free. Although he had retained the straight edge gimmick, he now had a [[Muay Thai]] training background. Punk made his TV wrestling debut on [[August 1]], [[2006]] at the [[Hammerstein Ballroom]], defeating [[Peter Polaco|Justin Credible]]. CM Punk established himself in ECW by going undefeated, defeating opponents such as Stevie Richards, [[Danny Doring]], and [[C.W. Anderson|Christopher W. Anderson]].

Soon after, Punk began feuding with [[Mike Knox]] after Knox's girlfriend, [[Barbie Blank|Kelly Kelly]], was seen to have feelings for Punk. Punk defeated Mike Knox in their first singles match (to qualify for the [[Elimination Chamber|Extreme Elimination Chamber]] at [[ECW December to Dismember#2006|December to Dismember]]) as well as the rematch, after which Kelly Kelly celebrated CM Punk's victory over her boyfriend. Punk then went on to team with [[D-Generation X]] and [[Hardy Boyz|The Hardy Boyz]] in their [[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series]] match against [[Rated-RKO]], Knox, [[John Hennigan|Johnny Nitro]] and [[Gregory Helms]], a match where all the participants on DX's side survived elimination. At December to Dismember, Punk participated in the Extreme Elimination Chamber, but was the first person eliminated.

Following this, Punk entered into a feud with [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]], who ended Punk's six month unbeaten streak in singles competition on [[January 9]],[[2007]]. Punk then went on to feud with [[Matthew Kaye|Matt Striker]], who gave him his second singles loss since being in ECW on [[January 30]].<!-- di am tony montana a political prisoner from cubao not add the Money in the Bank Match.

==Gimmick==
Punk has adopted his real life following of the [[straight edge]] movement as his professional wrestling [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], however the gimmick uses different elements of Punk's personality and the beliefs of the straight edge movement depending on the [[Professional wrestling slang#A|alignment]]. While portraying a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]], the gimmick tends to be that of Punk's normal personality,<ref name="punkshoot" /> largely indifferent to others who drink [[alcohol]], smoke [[tobacco]], partake in [[recreational drug use]] or have [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] as well as emphasizing the social discipline involved with [[abstinence]]. Conversely, his [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] personality tends to portray that of a [[Hardline (syncretic movement)|hardliner]], especially the elitist and superiority attitudes possessed by hardliners defined by Punk's common mantra during heel [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promos]] that, because he is straight edge, he is "better than you".<ref name="betterthanyou">{{cite video | people = CM Punk | url = http://www.rohwrestling.com/shoponline.asp?point=moreinfo&catid=161&id=365 |title = Better Than You - The Best of CM Punk | medium = DVD | publisher = Ring of Honor | date = 2004 }}</ref> Irrelevant of alignment Punk performs the straight edge symbol of crossing his arms in an X formation while having the letter X written on the back of his hands, usually drawn on his wrist tape.

An integral part of Punk's [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] is that of the numerous [[tattoo]]s that adorn his body some of which have come to become symbols associated with Punk as well as mantras and declarations that have been integrated into his gimmick. The tattoos as a whole, due to their large quantity and variety, have also become an attribute identifiable to Punk. The most important of the individual tattoos in Punk's character, whether through association, symbol, or mantra, are: 
*A [[Pepsi-Cola|Pepsi]] logo on his left shoulder inspired the names of two of his signature moves. He got the tattoo as a joke as many [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] members in his school were getting beer logos tattooed on their body, so Punk, a keen Pepsi drinker, chose to receive a Pepsi tattoo to emphasize his straight edge beliefs.<ref name="wojick" /> The tattoo is also a reference to former [[Minor Threat]] guitarist [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], who had a [[Coca-Cola]] tattoo and explained this by saying "I like Coca-Cola". When people inquire about Punk's Pepsi tattoo, he often replies "I like Pepsi" in a similar fashion.<ref name="punkshoot" /> The Pepsi logo has become a symbol of Punk himself, wearing the logo on his ring gear in the [[independent circuit]] as well as a slightly modified Pepsi logo being used as part of his [[Jumbotron|TitanTron]] entrance video.<ref name="tron">{{cite video

Punk's character and gimmick have been parodied for comedy in the wrestling federation [[Chikara Pro Wrestling|CHIKARA]] with the character [[Necro Butcher|CP Munk]], the straight edge [[chipmunk]]. The character is simply a chipmunk [[mascot]] costume which includes references to Punk such as X marked wrist tape, a Pepsi logo on the costume's left shoulder and uses a sped up version of Punk's best known independent circuit theme song ''[[Miseria Cantare - The Beginning]]'', as performed by the band [[AFI (band)|AFI]].<ref name="cpmunk2">{{cite web

| quote = CP Munk is a wrestler in a chipmunk costume, like a school mascot outfit. He has a Pepsi tattoo on his arm, he wears basketball trunks, and he came out to an AFI song… good comedy, and the crowd all knew this was a fun parody of CM Punk.
