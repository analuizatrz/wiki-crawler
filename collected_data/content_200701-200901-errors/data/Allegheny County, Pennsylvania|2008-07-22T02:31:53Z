'''Allegheny County''' is a [[county]] in the southwestern part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. As of the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]], the population was 1,281,666. The [[county seat]] is [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. The county forms the nucleus of the [[Pittsburgh Metro Area|Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area]], [[Pittsburgh DMA]], and [[Pittsburgh Tri-State]] Area.

== History ==
Allegheny County was the first in Pennsylvania to be given a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] name, being named after the [[Allegheny River]]. The word "Allegheny" is of [[Lenape]] origin, with uncertain meaning. It is usually said to mean "fine river", but sometimes said to refer to an ancient mythical tribe called "Allegewi" who live along the river long ago before being destroyed by the Lenape.<ref>{{cite book |last= Stewart |first= George R. |authorlink= George R. Stewart |title= Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |origyear= 1945 |edition= Sentry edition (3rd) |year= 1967 |publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin]] |pages= p. 8, 193}}</ref>

Not a great deal is known about the native inhabitants of the region prior to European contact. During the colonial era various native groups claimed or settled in the area, resulting in a multi-ethnic mix that included [[Iroquois]], [[Lenape]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Mingo]].

The first [[Europe]]ans to enter the area were the [[France|French]] in 1749.  Captain [[Pierre Joseph de Celeron, sieur de Blainville]] claimed the [[Ohio Valley]] and all of Western Pennsylvania for [[Louis XV of France]]. The captain traveled along the [[Ohio River| Ohio]] and Allegheny Rivers inserting lead plates in the ground to mark the land for [[France]].

Since most of the towns during that era were developed along [[waterways]], both the French and the British desired control over the local rivers. Therefore, the British sent Major [[George Washington]] to try to compel the French to leave their posts, with no success. Having failed in his mission, he returned and nearly drowned crossing the ice-filled Allegheny River. In 1754, the English tried again to enter the area. This time, they sent 41 Virginians to build [[Fort Prince George]]. The French got news of the plan and sent an army to take over the fort, which they then resumed building with increased fortification, renaming it [[Fort Duquesne]].

The loss of the fort cost the English dearly because [[Fort Duquesne]] became one of the focal points of the [[French and Indian War]]. The first attempt to retake the fort, by General [[Edward Braddock]], failed miserably. It was not until General [[John Forbes (General)|John Forbes]] attacked in 1758, four years after they had lost the original fort, that they recaptured and destroyed it. They subsequently built a new fort on the site, including a moat, and named it [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]]. The site is now Pittsburgh's [[Point State Park]].

Both Pennsylvania and [[Virginia]] claimed the region that is now Allegheny County.  Pennsylvania administered most of the region as part [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]]. Virginia considered everything south of the [[Ohio River]] and east of the [[Allegheny River]] to be part of its [[Yohogania County]] and governed it from [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Dunmore]]. In addition, parts of the county were located in the proposed British colony of [[Vandalia (colony)|Vandalia]] and the proposed U.S. state of [[Westsylvania]].  The overlapping boundaries, multiple governments, and confused deed claims soon proved unworkable. In 1780 Pennsylvania and Virginia agreed to extend the [[Mason-Dixon line]] westward and the region became part of Pennsylvania. From 1781 until 1788, much of what had been claimed as part of Yohogania County, Virginia, was administered as a part of the newly created [[Washington County, Pennsylvania]].

Allegheny County was officially created on [[September 24]], [[1788]] from parts of [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington]] and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]] counties. It was formed due to pressure from settlers living in the area around [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], which became the [[county seat]] in 1791. The county originally extended all the way north to the shores of [[Lake Erie]] and became the "mother county" for most of what is now northwestern Pennsylvania. By 1800, the county's current borders were set.

In the 1790s, a [[whiskey]] excise tax was imposed by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Federal Government]]. This started the so-called [[Whiskey Rebellion]] when the farmers who depended on whiskey income refused to pay and drove off a local town's marshal. After a series of demonstrations by farmers, President [[George Washington]] arrived with troops to stop the rebellion.

The area developed rapidly throughout the 19th century to become the center of steel production in the nation. [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] would later be labeled as the "Steel Capital of the World."

== Law and government ==
For most of the 20th century, until 1999, Allegheny County was governed exclusively under the state's Second Class County Code. Under this code, the county handled everything: elections, prisons, airports, public health and city planning. Unlike the rest of the state, where certain public offices are combined and held by one person, in Allegheny County all public offices are held by elected individuals.

Before [[January 1]], [[2000]], there were three county [[commissioner]]s. These were replaced with an elected chief officer (the county executive), a county council with 15 members (13 elected by district, two elected county-wide), and an appointed county manager. The changes were intended to maintain a separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches while providing the citizens with greater control over the government.

The county has 130 municipalities, each with its own governmental setup; no other county in Pennsylvania has nearly as many, with Luzerne County's 76 being second.<ref>[http://www.pamunicipalitiesinfo.com Pennsylvania Municipalities Information]</ref> The county has one [[Second Class City]] ([[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]) and three [[Third Class City|Third Class Cities]] ([[Clairton, Pennsylvania|Clairton]], [[Duquesne, Pennsylvania|Duquesne]], and [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]]).

A 2004 study by the [[University of Pittsburgh]] stated that Allegheny County would be better served by consolidating the southeastern portion of the county (which includes many small, poor communities) into one large municipality, called "[[Rivers City]]," which would have a combined population of approximately 250,000.

==Geography==
Allegheny County is known for the three major rivers that flow through it: the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] converge at [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to form the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] river. An additional river, the [[Youghiogheny River|Youghiogheny]], meets the Monongahela at [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]], 10 miles south. Despite its industrial growth, much of Allegheny County is covered with forests.

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of 745&nbsp;square miles (1,929&nbsp;km²); 730&nbsp;square miles (1,891&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 15&nbsp;square miles (38&nbsp;km²) of it (1.95%) is water.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 1,281,666 people, 537,150 households, and 332,495 families residing in the county. The [[population density]] was 1,755 people per square mile (678/km²). There were 583,646 housing units at an average density of 799 per square&nbsp;mile (309/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 84.33% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 12.41% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.12% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 1.69% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.34% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.07% from two or more races. About 0.87% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race. 20.0% were of [[German people|German]], 15.0% [[Italian people|Italian]], 12.7% [[Irish people|Irish]], 7.5% [[Polish people|Polish]] and 5.1% [[English people|English]] ancestry according to [[Census 2000]]. 93.5% spoke [[English language|English]] and 1.3% [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as their first language.

There were 537,150 households out of which 26.40% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.10% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 12.40% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.10% were non-families. Some 32.70% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.20% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.96.

For every 100 females, there were 90.00 males; for every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.20 males.

== Economy ==
In the late 1700s farming played a critical role in the growth of the area. There was a surplus of grain due to transportation difficulties in linking with the eastern portion of the state. As a result, the farmers distilled the grain into [[whiskey]], which significantly helped the farmers financially.

The area quickly became one of the key manufacturing areas in the young nation. [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] quickly became the largest inland port in the nation, which it remains today. Coupled with deposits of iron and coal, and the easy access to waterways for barge traffic, the city quickly became one of the most important steel producing areas in the world.

With the decline of the steel industry in the U.S., the area shifted to other industries. Today, it is known for its hospitals, universities, and industrial centers. Despite the decline of heavy industry, Pittsburgh is home to a number of major companies and is ranked in the [http://www.downtownpittsburgh.com/doingBusinessDowntown.aspx top ten] among U.S. cities hosting headquarters of Fortune 500 corporations. These include [[U.S. Steel]] Corporation, [[PNC Financial Services]] Group, [[PPG Industries]], and [[H. J. Heinz Company|H J Heinz Corporation]].

===Former Municipalities and Political Subdivisions===
Many political subdivisions of Allegheny County have come and gone through subdivision or annexation through the years. These include:

Allegheny City - the area that is now the North Shore (or North Side) of the City of Pittsburgh, north of the Allegheny River.

Allentown Borough - now the neighborhood of Allentown in Pittsburgh.

Birmingham Borough - what is now Pittsburgh's South Side.

Carrick Borough - now the neighborhood of Carrick. Formed out of Baldwin Township in 1904, this borough existed until it was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1927. It was named for Carrick-on-Suir, Ireland.  To this day, some of the manhole covers bear the Carrick Borough name. 

Collins Township - in what is now the Strip District and Lawrenceville of the City of Pittsburgh.

McClure Township - McClure was formed in 1858 from the section of Ross Township adjacent to Allegheny City. In 1867 McClure, along with sections of Reserve Township, was incorporated into Allegheny City. The McClure section of this
annexation became Wards 9 (Woods Run Area) and 11 (present day Brighton Heights) in the City of Pittsburgh.

St. Clair Township - stretched from the Monongahela River south to the Washington County line. It divided into Lower St. Clair, which eventually became part of the City of Pittsburgh, and Upper St. Clair.

Snowden - now known as South Park Township.

Temperanceville - what is now Pittsburgh's West End.

Union Borough - the area surrounding Temperanceville.
