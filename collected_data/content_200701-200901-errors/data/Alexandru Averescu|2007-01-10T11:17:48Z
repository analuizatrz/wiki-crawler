'''Alexandru Averescu''' ({{OldStyleDate|April 3|1859|March 9}} &mdash; [[October 2]], [[1938]]) was a [[Romania]]n general and [[Populism|populist]] politician. A [[Romanian Army]] Commander during [[World War I]], he served as [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] of three separate cabinets (as well as being ''interim'' [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Foreign Minister]] in January-March [[1918]]). Averescu, who authored over 12 works on various military topics (including his memoirs from the frontline),<ref>Otu, p.22-23</ref> was also an honorary member of the [[Romanian Academy]] and an [[Order of Michael the Brave]] recipient.

==Early life and career==
Averescu was born in [[Ozyornoye]] (previously known as ''Babele'', and subsequently renamed ''Alexandru Averescu''), a village northwest of [[Izmail]], now part of [[Ukraine]]. The son of Constantin Averescu, who held the [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|rank]] of ''[[sluger]]'', he studied at the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] [[seminary]] in Izmail, then at the School of Arts and Crafts in [[Bucharest]] (intending to become an [[engineer]]).<ref>Parean</ref> In 1876, he decided to join the [[Jandarmeria Română|Gendermes]] in Izmail.<ref>Parean</ref>

Seeing action as a [[cavalry]] sergeant with the Romanian troops engaged in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|Russo-Turkish War]] of [[1877]]-[[1878]], he was decorated on several occasions, but was later moved to reserve (after failing his medical examination due to the effects of [[frostbite]]).<ref>Parean</ref> He was, however, reinstated later in 1878, and subsequently  received a military education in Romania, at the military school of [[Târgovişte]] ([[Dealu Monastery]]), and in [[Italy]], at the Military Academy of [[Turin]].<ref>Bulei; Otu, p.22; Parean</ref> Averescu married an Italian [[opera]] singer, Clotilda Caligaris, who had been the [[prima donna]] of [[La Scala]].<ref>Otu, p.22; Parean</ref> 

Upon his return, Averescu steadily climbed through the ranks. He was head of the Bucharest Military Academy (1894-1895), and, in 1895-1898, Romania's military ''[[attaché]]'' in the [[German Empire]]; a colonel in 1901, he was advanced to the rank of [[Brigadier General]] and became head of the [[Tecuci]] regional Army Command Center in 1906.<ref>Otu, p.22; Parean</ref> 

Before the World War, he led the troops in crushing the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 peasants' revolt]] &mdash; where he engaged in using very harsh means of repression, especially when dealing with soldiers who refused to fight against the rebels &mdash; and was subsequently Minister of War in [[Dimitrie Sturdza]]'s [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) cabinet (1907-1909).<ref>Bulei; Hitchins, p.184-185; Parean</ref> According to the recollections of [[Eliza Brătianu]], a split occurred between him and the PNL after Averescu attempted to advance various political goals &mdash; a conflict erupted when he sought support with [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] and then, as the National Liberals deeply resented Romania'salliance with the [[Central Powers]], he approached the Germans for backing.<ref>E. Brătianu</ref> 

Subsequently, he was commander of the First Infantry Division (stationed in [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin|Turnu Severin]]) and, later, of the Second Army Corps in [[Craiova]].<ref>Parean</ref> In 1912, he became a [[Major General]], and, in 1911-1913, he was [[List of the Chiefs of the General Staff of Romania|Chief of the General Staff]].<ref>Otu, p.22; Parean</ref> In the latter capacity, Averescu organized the actions of Romanian troops operating south of the [[Danube]] in the [[Second Balkan War]] (the campaign against [[Bulgaria]], during which his troops met no resistance).<ref>Otu, p.22; Parean</ref>

==World War and first cabinet==
{{main|Romanian Campaign (World War I)}}
During the World War (in which Romania entered in [[1916]]), he led the Second Army in the defense of the [[Southern Carpathians]], and was then moved to the head of the Third Army (following the latter's defeat in the [[Battle of Turtucaia]]).<ref>Otu, p.22</ref> He commanded Army Group South in the [[Flămânda Offensive|Flămânda operation]] against the Third Bulgarian Army and other forces of the [[Central Powers]], ultimately stopped by the German offensive (Averescu's forces did not register important losses, and orderly retreated to [[Moldavia]], where Romanian authorities had taken refuge from the successful German operations).<ref>Otu, p.22-23</ref> 

Averescu again led the Second Army in the minor victories in the [[Battle of Mărăşti]] and the [[Battle of Mărăşeşti]] (August [[1917]]);<ref>Hitchins, p.270</ref> his achievements, including his brief breakthrough at Mărăşti, were considered impressive by public opinion and his officers.<ref>Otu, p.23; Parean</ref> However, several military historians rate Averescu and his fellow Romanian generals very poorly, arguing that, overall, their direction of the war "could not have been worse".<ref>Esposito, text for map 40</ref> Despite controlling an army of 500,000 plus 100,000 [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] reinforcements, they were soundly defeated by a much smaller German-[[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]]-Bulgarian army in less than four months of combat.

Averescu was widely seen as the person behind a relatively successful resistance to further offensives on [[Moldavia]] (the single piece of territory still held by the Romanian state), and he was considered by many of his contemporaries to have stood in contrast to the what was seen as endemic corruption and incompetence.<ref>Boia, p.210-211; E. Brătianu; Otu, p.22, 23; Parean</ref> The state of affairs, together with the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, was to be blamed for the eventual Romanian surrender to the Central Powers; promoted Premier by [[King of Romania|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] during the period of crisis, Averescu began [[armistice]] talks with [[August von Mackensen]] in [[Buftea]] and [[Focşani]], but was vehemently opposed to the terms &mdash; he resigned, leaving the [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] cabinet when it signed the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|Treaty of Bucharest]].<ref>Constantinescu, "Domnilor,...", p.23; Parean</ref>

==People's Party==
Averescu quit the army in the spring of [[1918]], aiming for a career in politics &mdash; initially, with a message that was hostile to the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) and its leader [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]]. 

He presided over the [[People's Party (Romania; defunct)|People's Party]] (initially named ''People's League''), and he was immensely popular especially among peasants after the end of the war. His force had an appealing [[populism|populist]] message, translated into vague promises and relying on the image of the General: peasants had been promised land at the beginning of the war (and they were being rewarded with it at the very moment, through an [[land reform|agrarian reform]] that reached its full scope in [[1923]]); they had formed the larger part of the Army, and had come to see Averescu as the one to fulfill their expectations, as well as a figure who was still commanding their allegiance.<ref>Boia, p.211</ref> [[Eliza Brătianu]], the PNL leader's wife, placed Averescu's ascension in the context of [[Greater Romania]]'s creation through the addition of [[Bessarabia]], [[Bukovina]], and [[Transylvania]] (while making use of the condescending National Liberal tone towards the [[Romanian National Party]] that was emerging triumphant in previously [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Transylvania):
<blockquote>"[The] so very harsh losses [during the war], the defeats suffered by the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]], the traces of foreign domination in the newly-acquired provinces, but most of all the state of unhealthy euphoria that had taken hold of Transylvania, who had begun, in all good faith, to believe that only she had [[Union Day (Romania)|made the union happen]], all of these have created a sort of insecurity within the borders of [Greater Romania]."<ref>E. Brătianu</ref></blockquote>

As the movement initially tended to describe itself as a social movement rather than a [[political party]], it also attracted former members of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)|Conservative Party]] (such as [[Constantin Argetoianu]], [[Constantin Garoflid]], and [[Take Ionescu]]), military men such as [[Constantin Coandă]], the [[Democratic Nationalist Party]] leader [[A. C. Cuza]], the notorious supporters of ''[[dirigisme]]'' [[Mihail Manoilescu]] and [[Ştefan Zeletin]],<ref>Ornea, p.48</ref> the moderate [[Nationalism|nationalist]] [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]], and the [[left-wing]] [[Agrarianism|agrarianist]] [[Petru Groza]]. It also established close links with ''Garda Conştiinţei Naţionale'' (GCN, "The National Awareness Guard"), a [[reactionary]] group formed by the electrician [[Constantin Pancu]], engaged in violence against [[Communism|communist]] activists in [[Iaşi]] (the latter were feared by Averescu as well).<ref>Veiga, p.46-47</ref> According to Eliza Brătianu (who was comparing Averescu with the [[France|French]] rebel soldier [[Georges Boulanger]]), several voices inside the movement called on Averescu to lead a [[Republicanism|republican]] ''[[coup d'état]]'' against [[King of Romania|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] and her husband &mdash; a move allegedly prevented only by the general's [[loyalism]].<ref>E. Brătianu</ref>

Aiming to answer most of Romania's social and political issues, the League's founding document called for:
<blockquote>"A land reform, with the passage of the land which is at the moment [[Expropriation|expropriated]] only on principle [- a reference to the 1917 promise for a land reform] into the effective and immediate ownership of villagers through the means of [[Commune in Romania|communes]]; an [[electoral reform]], through [[universal suffrage]], [[direct election]], [[secret ballot]], and [[compulsory voting]], with [[Representation (politics)|representation]] given to [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minorities]], since the latter would not hinder the free manifestation of political individualities; [[Decentralization|administrative decentralization]]."<ref>Founding document</ref></blockquote>

According to Argetoianu,
<blockquote>"in the autumn of [[1919]], [Averescu's] popularity had reached its peak. In the villages, people would dream of him, some swore that they had seen him descending from an airplane into their midst, others, who had fought in the war, told that they had lived by his side in the [[Trench warfare|trenches]], it was through him that hopes were solidified, and he was expected of to provide a miracle for people to live a carefree and fulfilling life. His popularity was something [[Mysticism|mystical]], something supernatural, and all sorts of legends had begun to surround this [[Messiah]] of the Romanian people."<ref>Argetoianu, in Scurtu, "Mit şi realitate"</ref></blockquote>

Although he was also [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister of Romania]] for three mandates ([[1918]], [[1920]]-[[1921]], [[1926]]-[[1927]]), his political success is not as spectacular as the military one. Averescu ended up as one of the pawns maneuvered by Brătianu.

==Second cabinet==
[[Image:General Averescu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Alexandru Averescu on horseback]]
===Establishment===
Initially, Brătianu approached Averescu using their shared displeasure over the [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]] [[Romanian National Party]] (PNR)-[[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]] (PŢ) cabinet; the National Liberals managed to obtain the general's renunciation of his goal to prosecute their party for alleged mis-management of Romania before and during the war, as well as his promise to respect the [[1866 Constitution of Romania]] when carrying out the planned land reform. At the same time, Brătianu kept a tight relationship with King Ferdinand.<ref>Hitchins, p.402; Scurtu, "Mit şi realitate"</ref>

On [[March 13]], 1920, he gave news of the Vaida-Voevod cabinet's dissolution, and was widely expected to call for early elections as soon as this had happened. Instead, he read a document convened with King Ferdinand, which suspended [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] (the first legislative body in ''[[Greater Romania]]'') for ten days &mdash; the measure was intended to give Averescu the time to negotiate a new majority in the chambers.<ref>Constantinescu, "Domnilor,...", p.26; Scurtu, "Prăbuşirea unui mit"</ref> These moves caused a vocal response from the opposition: [[Nicolae Iorga]], who was president of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]] and sided with the National Party, called for a [[motion of no confidence]] to be passed on March 26; in return, Averescu obtained the support of the monarch in dissolving the Parliament, and invested his cabinet's energies into winning the early elections by enlisting the help of [[Counties of Romania|county]]-level officials (local administration came to be dominated by People's Party officials).<ref>Constantinescu, "Dr. N. Lupu...", p.38-40; Scurtu, "Prăbuşirea unui mit"</ref> It carried the vote with 206 seats (223 together with [[Take Ionescu]]'s ''Conservative-Democratic Party'').<ref>Scurtu, "Prăbuşirea unui mit"</ref>

As agreements between the PNR and PŢ broke down (with the PNR awaiting for new developments), the PŢ joined Iorga's party, the [[Democratic Nationalist Party|Democratic Nationalists]], in creating the ''Federation of National-Social Democracy'' (which also drew support from the group around [[Nicolae L. Lupu]]).<ref>Constantinescu, "Dr. N. Lupu...", p.37</ref>

===Policies===
His mandate was marked by the signing of the [[Treaty of Trianon]] with [[Hungary]], and initial steps leading to the creation of the [[Little Entente]] - formed by Romania with [[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. It was also at this stage that Romania and the [[Second Polish Republic]] inaugurated their military alliance (''see [[Polish-Romanian Alliance]]''). The goal to create a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against [[Bolshevist Russia]] also brought him and his [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] Argetoianu to oversee repression measures against the group of [[Socialist Party of Romania]] delegates to the [[Comintern]] (arrested on suspicion of "attempt against the state's security" on May 12, 1921).<ref>Parean; Troncotă, p.18</ref> This came after a long debate in Parliament over the imprisonment of [[Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor]], a Romanian citizen who had joined the Russian [[Red Army]] in [[Bessarabia]] during the later stages of the [[October Revolution]], and who had been tried for [[treason]].<ref>Constantinescu, "Dr. N. Lupu...", p.40-41</ref>

The region coming under Romania's administration at the end of the war still maintained their [[ad hoc]] administrative structures, including the [[Transylvania]]n Directory Council, set up and dominated by the PNR; Averescu ordered these dissolved in April, facing protest from local notabilities.<ref>Livezeanu, p.23</ref> He unified currency around the [[Romanian leu]], and imposed a [[land reform]] in the form in which it was to be carried out by the new Brătianu executive.<ref>Livezeanu, p.23</ref>

In October 1920, Averescu reached an agreement with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], recognizing Bessarabia's union with Romania &mdash; expressing a hope for the Bolshevik government to be overthrown, it also imposed the region's cession on a projected democratic government in Russia (while calling for further negotiations between it and Romania); throughout the [[interwar period]], the [[Soviet Union]] refused to bind itself to the provisions of the agreement.<ref>Hitchins, p.290-291</ref> [[Italy]] also refused to [[Ratification|ratify]] the document, citing, alongside various foreign interests (including its friendship with the Soviet Union),<ref>Clark; Hîncu, p.70</ref> the 250 million [[Italian lira|Italian lire]] owed to Italian investors in Romanian state [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].<ref>Hîncu, p.68</ref>

===Scandals and fall===
In March 1921, Argetoianu became implicated in a scandal involving the actions of his associate Aron Schuller, who had attempted to contract a 20 million lire loan with a bank in Italy, using as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] Romanian [[war bond]]s that he had illegally obtained from the Finance Ministry reserve.<ref>Constantinescu, "Duiliu Zamfirescu...", p.68-70</ref>

With [[Nicolae Titulescu]] as Finance Minister, Averescu resumed the [[Interventionism|interventionist]] course in economic policies, but broke with tradition when he attempted to legislate a major increase in taxes and proposed [[nationalization]]s &mdash; with potential negative effects on the PNL-voting [[middle class]].<ref>Hitchins, p.403; Scurtu, "Prăbuşirea unui mit"; Slabey Roucek, p.106</ref> The National Liberals, through the voice of [[Alexandru Constantinescu-Porcu]], helped exploit the rivalry between the Peasants' Party and Iorga, using the latter's rejection of [[Constantin Stere]] (a conflict sparked by Stere's support for Germany during the World War); Stere won partial elections for the deputy seat in [[Soroca]], Bessarabia, causing a political scandal which saw all parties (including the PNR) declare their dissatisfaction.<ref>Scurtu, "Prăbuşirea unui mit"</ref> The conflict worsened during a prolonged parliamentary debate over Averescu's proposal to nationalize enterprises in [[Reşiţa]] (an initiative the opposition mistrusted, alleging that the new owners were to be People's Party members), when Argetoianu addressed a mumbled insult to the Peasants' Party [[Virgil Madgearu]].<ref>Scurtu, "Prăbuşirea unui mit"</ref> [[Ion G. Duca]] of the PNL expressed his sympathies to Madgearu (who had repeated out an obscene word whispered by Argetoianu), and all opposition groups appealed to Ferdinand, asking for Averescu's recall (July 14, 1921).<ref>Scurtu, "Prăbuşirea unui mit"</ref> 

Ferdinand then attempted to facilitate a fusion between the [[Romanian National Party]] and the National Liberals, but negotiations broke down after disagreements over the possible leadership.<ref>Scurtu, "Prăbuşirea unui mit"</ref> Eventually, Brătianu convened with Ferdinand his return to power, and the king called on [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Foreign Minister]] [[Take Ionescu]] to resign, thus causing a political crisis that profited the PNL and put an end to the Averescu cabinet. 

Shows of popular support in [[Bucharest]] were called of by Averescu himself, after he had negotiatied with Brătianu for a People's Party cabinet to be formed "at a proper time".<ref>Scurtu, "Mit şi realitate"</ref> Ionescu took over as premier until late January 1922, when he was replaced by Brătianu.<ref>Slabey Roucek, p.106</ref>

==Third cabinet==
===New political alliances===
In early 1926, the general was again named Premier, and approached the PNR and its close ally, the Peasants' Party, proposing a merger around his leadership. This met with a stiff refusal, as it seemed that the two were about to win the elections with additional support, but the king, suspicious of the [[left-wing]] credentials of the Peasants' Party, used his [[Royal Prerogative]] and nominated Averescu as premier (with PNL support).<ref>Constantinescu, "V. Madgearu..", p.81; Hitchins, p.389; Scurtu, "Mit şi realitate"</ref> 

Averescu's party was instead joined by PNR dissidents, [[Vasile Goldiş]] and [[Ioan Lupaş]], who represented a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] segment of the Transylvanian voters (rather than the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek Catholics]] supporting [[Iuliu Maniu]]).<ref>Slabey Roucek, p.111</ref> The elections, which Averescu's cabinet organized in March and won with a landslide (269 mandates) also brought a massive defeat for the PNL, who held just 16 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.<ref>Constantinescu, "V. Madgearu..", p.81; Hitchins, p.406; Slabey Roucek, p.112</ref>

===Italian-Romanian Treaty===
Although not [[Fascism|fascist]] itself, the new government he formed displayed gestures of friendship towards [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]],<ref>Hîncu, p.68-69; Parean; Veiga, p.92</ref> a state which advertised itself as a rising force - ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' called Averescu "Romania's Mussolini", as "an epithet which the new premier of Rumania bestowed upon himself".<ref>Fuchs</ref> Contacts established (as early as a June 1926, when [[Mihail Manoilescu]] had negotiated a loan in [[Rome]])<ref>Hîncu, p.68-69; Slabey Roucek, p.112</ref> were one of the major points of divergence between the policies of Averescu and those of Brătianu: the former attempted to overcome the embarrassment provoked by Mussolini when, due to Romania's debt, the Italian government had recalled the ambassador and had refused to permit King Ferdinand's pre-convened visit.<ref>Hîncu, p.68</ref> 

The loan convened by Manoilescu and Mussolini made important concessions to Italy in return for a clarification of Romania's debt status; it also led to the signing of a five-year ''Friendship Treaty'' (September 16), widely condemned by Romanian public opinion for not having called on Italy to state its support for Romanian rule in [[Bessarabia]],<ref>Clark; Hîncu, p.69-70; Vişoianu, p.108</ref> and created tension inside the [[Little Entente]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] feared that Italy had attempted to gain Romania's neutrality in case of a conflict over a potential [[Italia irredenta|irredentist]] conflict).<ref>Hîncu, p.71; Vişoianu, p.108-109</ref> Writing at the time, [[Constantin Vişoianu]] also criticized the vague terms in which the sections of the document dealing with mutual defense had been drafted:
<blockquote>"What have we gained from Italy through this pact? Nothing. In truth, article 3 &mdash; which does not [even] refer to Bessarabia &mdash; makes provisions for the eventuality of a ''violent'' incursion and organizes a system of mutual assistance system [that is] original through its [[Platonic love]]-like character."<ref>Vişoianu, p.108 (Vişoianu's italics); Slabey Roucek (p.112) believed a protocol over [[Bessarabia]] to have been in fact concluded, probably based on the vague character of the text</ref></blockquote>  

The treaty expired in 1932, and, after being prolonged by six months, it was not renewed.<ref>Hîncu, p.71</ref> Overall, the political impact of contacts was minor, given that the Italians mistrusted the Romanian movement for its traditional role as instrument for Brătianu.<ref>Veiga, p.92, 98</ref>

===Averescu's controversial projects===
Averescu continued to offer his support to [[far right]] groups (especially to the [[National-Christian Defense League]] formed by [[A. C. Cuza]], his early collaborator), and probably considered assuming dictatorial powers.<ref>Veiga, p.86, 89, 91</ref>

The cabinet clashed with Brătianu when it was discovered that it had been negotiating in secret with the disinherited [[Carol II of Romania|Prince Carol]] (a traditional adversary of the PNL) as Ferdinand's health was taking a turn for the worse<ref>Constantinescu, "V. Madgearu..", p.81-82; Hitchins, p.407</ref> (Averescu later claimed that he had been asked by Brătianu: "So, after I have brought you to power, you wish to rise and dominate?").<ref>Averescu, in Scurtu, "Mit şi realitate"; Slabey Roucek (p.113) supports the version of events later dismissed by Averescu himself, according to which the general had opposed Carol's return</ref> The PNL retreated its support, and Averescu's was replaced by the [[National government|broad coalition government]] of [[Barbu Ştirbey]], Brătianu's brother-in-law.<ref>Constantinescu, "V. Madgearu..", p.82; Livezeanu, p.23-24</ref> The general's deposition, confirmed by King Ferdinand on his deathbed,<ref>Constantinescu, "V. Madgearu..", p.82</ref> created a vacuum on [[Right-wing|the Right]], soon filled by the [[Iron Guard]], a fascist movement formed by [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] (formerly an associate of Cuza's).<ref>Veiga, p.93</ref>

==Final years==
The People's Party involved itself in solving the dynastic crisis after Ferdinand's death in July 1927, again approaching Carol to replace the child-king [[Michael I of Romania|Michael]] and [[Prince Nicholas of Romania|Prince Nicholas]]' [[Regent|regency]]. The group lost much of its supporters to the newly-formed [[National Peasants' Party]],<ref>Hitchins, p.392</ref> and scored under 2% in the 1927 elections.<ref>Hitchins, p.406; Scurtu, "Mit şi realitate"</ref>

Around [[1930]], Averescu began opposing the [[universal suffrage]] he had endorsed earlier, and issued an appeal to the [[intellectual]]s in order to have it discarded from legislation on the basis that it was easily influenced by the parties in power.<ref>Nicanor, p.139</ref> He and his supporter, the pro-[[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] poet [[Octavian Goga]],<ref>Nicanor, p.138-139</ref> received criticism from the [[left-wing]] [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] journal ''[[Viaţa Românească]]'', who claimed that Averescu had in fact provoked and encouraged widespread electoral irregularities during his time in office.<ref>Nicanor, p.139</ref>  

He was promoted to [[Marshal of Romania]] in the same year,<ref>Parean</ref> during the time when Carol returned to rule as King. He showed himself hostile to Carol's inner circle, and especially to the king's lover [[Magda Lupescu]]; consequently, Goga was instigated by Carol to take over as leader of the People's Party, and the latter attacked Averescu for "subverting [...] the traditional respect enjoyed by the Crown".<ref>Goga, in Scurtu, "Mit şi realitate"</ref> The clash led to Goga's creation of the splinter [[National Agrarian Party (Romania)|National Agrarian Party]], which, although never an important force, obtained more of the vote in the 1932 elections (ca. 3% compared to Averescu's 2%).<ref>Scurtu, "Mit şi realitate"</ref> 

Around 1934, as the Guard proclaimed its allegiance to [[Nazi Germany]], the Italians (still rivals of [[Adolf Hitler]]), approached Averescu (as well as [[Nicolae Iorga]],  [[Mihail Manoilescu]], [[Nichifor Crainic]], Cuza, Goga, and other non-Guardist reactionaries), with an offer for collaboration (''see [[Comitati d'azione per l'universalità di Roma]]'').<ref>Veiga, p.252-253</ref> This apparent alliance was, in fact, marked by major dissentions &mdash; Averescu and Iorga were routinely attacked by Crainic's ''[[Calendarul]]''.<ref>Ornea, p.243</ref> Eventually, Averescu's group formed, in 1934, the ''Constitutional Front'', a nationalist [[electoral alliance]] with the [[National Liberal Party-Brătianu]], which was joined by [[Mihai Stelescu]]'s Iron Guard ofshoot, [[Mihai Stelescu]]'s [[Crusade of Romanianism]], and the minor party created by [[Grigore Forţu]] (the ''Citizen Bloc''); after the latter two parties disappeared, the Front survived in its original form until 1936, when it disbanded.<ref>Gruber, Cap. V</ref>

In [[1937]], despite his ongoing feud with Carol, Averescu was appointed a member of the Crown Council. The following year, he was briefly [[Minister without portfolio]] in the cabinet of Premier [[Miron Cristea]], created by Carol to combat the ascension of the Iron Guard,<ref>Veiga, p.247-248</ref> and opposed the monarch's option to renounce the [[1923 Constitution of Romania|1923 Constitution]] and proclaim his dictatorship (the latter move signalled the end of the People's Party, as all political groups were replaced by Carol's [[National Renaissance Front]]).<ref>Scurtu, "Mit şi realitate"</ref> He died soon after in Bucharest, and was buried in the World War I heroes' [[crypt]] in [[Mărăşti]].<ref>Parean</ref>
