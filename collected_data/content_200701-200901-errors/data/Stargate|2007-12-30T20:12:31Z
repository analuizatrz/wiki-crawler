'''''Stargate''''' refers to the [[science fiction]] [[media franchise]] that began in 1994 with the feature film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''. The subsequent body of works detail an elaborate [[fictional universe]] where Earth battles hostile aliens possessing superior technology or supernatural powers. The film's story is continued in [[novel]] form, in two live-action television series (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''), one animated series (''[[Stargate Infinity]]''), and in other [[List of Stargate works|derivative works]].

The franchise, owned by [[MGM]], continues to be successful {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 1994 }} years after its inception.<ref name="Stargate 200">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6332083.html|title=''Stargate 200'': 10 years of ''Stargate'' success|work=MultiChannel}}</ref> Due to multiple developers working separately and independently on the franchise over the years, the various Stargate productions are not entirely consistent with each other: no set of works forms a "correct" or official [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. The largest [[fanbase]] exists for the [[Timeline of Stargate|story]] that begins with the original film, and continues with ''Stargate SG-1'' ([[1997]]&ndash;[[2007]]) and ''Stargate Atlantis'' ([[2004]]&ndash;).<ref name="Comic Boom">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6357339.html|title=''Comic Boom'': Massive loyal fanbases for SciFi productions like ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''|work=MultiChannel}}</ref>

The feature film ''Stargate'', written by [[Dean Devlin]] and directed by [[Roland Emmerich]], was released in [[1994 in film|1994]]. The film was intended to be the start of a film franchise, but Emmerich moved on to create ''[[Independence Day (film)|Independence Day]]'' and ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]''.<ref name="amazon">{{cite web | url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/52346/ref%3Ded%5Fart%5F370423%5Ftxt%5F1/026-7273928-0012425 | title= ''Stargate SG-1'' on DVD | work = Amazon.com Feature}}</ref> The film was not continued in a cinematic [[trilogy]] as originally envisioned, but the story was later expanded by writers and developers other than Emmerich and Devlin.

Emmerich and Devlin do not consider <i>Stargate</i>'s [[spin-off]]s to be valid continuations of the original story of the film. Although [[Lions Gate Films|Lions Gate]] now owns major rights to the original film, [[MGM]] owns the rights to the franchise, and as such, Emmerich and Devlin were unable to see "their" sequels made,<ref name="devlin">{{cite web | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537 | title = Dean Devlin on his Movie Trilogy | work = ComingSoon.net}}</ref> as a result, some fans of the film reject the series and some fans of the series reject the film.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2006/07/21/devlin-pushing-stargate-the-movie-trilogy/ | title = Fan reactions to films versus series | work = SliceOfSciFi.com}}</ref> Devlin has stated that he plans to write his own sequel to ''Stargate'' separate from the spin-offs' storyline, resulting in two versions of the continuing story.<ref name="devlin"/>

The production budget of the film was estimated as $55,000,000.

===Plot===
The film's plot lays the framework of the Stargate mythos. A brilliant [[Archaeologist]], [[Daniel Jackson|Dr. Daniel Jackson]] ([[James Spader]]), is shunned by the academic world due to his far-fetched theories regarding the [[Great Pyramids]]. [[Catherine Langford|Dr. Catherine Langford]] privately hires him to [[decipher]] a set of [[symbol]]s found on the [[cover stone]]s of an ancient ring-shaped artifact (the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]) that was found at [[Giza]] in 1928. Jackson determines that the symbols are in fact [[constellation]]s, and if 6 symbols are identified, a point in space can be extrapolated that corresponds to a "destination"; a seventh symbol defines the [[point of origin]]. This discovery unlocks the secret to using the Stargate for interstellar travel.

[[United States Air Force|USAF]] Colonel [[Jack O'Neil (Stargate)|Jack O'Neil]] ([[Kurt Russell]]), with Jackson, leads an expedition through the Stargate to the planet [[Abydos (Stargate)|Abydos]]. In the film, only two Stargates are known to exist, i.e. the two connecting Abydos and Earth; hence the purpose of the mission is to determine whether Abydos poses a danger to Earth, and, if so, to destroy the gate on Abydos to protect Earth. Expansions of the film, such as ''SG-1'', alter this premise, explaining that an entire network of Stargates exists.

On Abydos, O'Neil's team comes into conflict with [[Ra (Stargate)|an alien]] posing as the [[Egyptian Mythology|Egyptian sun god]] [[Ra]] ([[Jaye Davidson]]). Ra controls vast numbers of slaves who labor in his mine, living in fear and ignorance. The slaves are the descendants of humans who were transported to Abydos from Ancient Egypt to mine the mineral needed to sustain Ra's life. O'Neil's team befriends the people of Abydos, and Jackson falls in love with and marries a woman named [[Sha'uri]] ([[Mili Avital]]), who was originally given to him by the people of Abydos as a peace offering. The team reveals Ra's hoax to the people of Abydos and leads them in revolution against him.

Before O'Neil is able to detonate a nuclear warhead to seal the pathway to Earth, Ra steals the bomb and uses the same mineral comprising the Stargate to increase its destructive power a hundredfold, with the intention of sending the bomb back to Earth through the Stargate. O'Neil is unable to defuse the detonation timer, and alternatively transports the bomb onto Ra's space-vessel. It detonates, destroying both Ra and his ship.  With Ra's destruction, the slaves of Abydos are liberated.

O'Neil and the surviving members of his team return to Earth, but Jackson stays behind to live with his wife.<ref name="primer"/>

===''Stargate SG-1''===
{{main|Stargate SG-1}}
[[Image:Sg1-poster.jpg|thumb|The original starring cast of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.]]

''Stargate SG-1'' is a [[television series]] that debuted on [[Showtime]] on [[July 27]] [[1997]], and moved to the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]] after its fifth season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2001-08/14/12.30.sfc|title=Announcement from SciFi Channel|work=SciFi Wire}}</ref> Created by [[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]], it starred [[Richard Dean Anderson]] (as the respelled [[Jack O'Neill|O'Neill]]), [[Michael Shanks]] (as [[Daniel Jackson|Jackson]]), [[Amanda Tapping]] (as [[Samantha Carter|Carter]]) , [[Christopher Judge]]  (as [[Teal'c]]) and [[Don S. Davis]] (as [[George Hammond|Hammond]]).

The cast has remained fairly regular for most of <i>SG-1</i>'s run, but has experienced some changes. [[Michael Shanks]] left the show at the end of Season 5 and was replaced by [[Corin Nemec]] as [[Jonas Quinn]].  Shanks returned at the beginning of Season 7 and Nemec was written out. At the end of Season 7 [[Don S. Davis|Davis]] left the show and [[Richard Dean Anderson|Anderson]] filled the gap he left in the story. Season 9 saw the departure of [[Richard Dean Anderson|Anderson]], but added new regulars [[Beau Bridges]] and [[Ben Browder]]. After a debut episode in Season 8, followed by appearances in eight episodes of Season 9, [[Claudia Black]]'s popular reaction<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/claudia_black_01.htm|title=Interview &mdash; Vala joins ''SG-1'' regulars|work=SciFi World}}</ref> earned her a position in the regular cast in Season 10.

[[MGM]] put an average of $1,400,000 into each episode of the show, and regards it as one of its most important franchises.<ref name="Stargate 200" /> It has won the [[Saturn Award]] for ''Best Syndicated Television Series'' on numerous occasions, and its cast has won similar awards for acting.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118480/awards|title=''Stargate SG-1'' Awards and Nominations|work=IMDb}}</ref> More recently it has received acclaim for its [[visual effect]]s, which increased in quality and realism as the show gained a larger budget.<ref name="vfx">{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/05/istargatei_grew_cutting_edge_vfx.shtml|title=Stargate  grows cutting edge VFX industry|work=GateWorld}}</ref>

The series begins one year after the original film in its internal chronology. It chronicles the activities of [[SG-1]], the first exploratory team of the newly-formed [[Stargate Command]], after an enemy attack through the Stargate alerts the [[United States Air Force]] that Ra was not the last of [[Goa'uld|his species]] (as was thought in the film). The series expands on the film, creating a full and rich mythology and a strong cast of recurring characters.

''Stargate SG-1'' proved to be very popular. Each year from Seasons 5 to 8 the show was repeatedly expected to end, but ratings continued to be high, allowing the show to break records and enter its tenth and final season (surpassing ''[[The X-Files]]'' as the longest running [[United States]] science-fiction series).

''[[Guinness World Records]]'' recognized Stargate SG-1 as the longest currently running consecutive sci-fi series in 2006. The show is second only to the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' series, which holds the title for longest running sci-fi show overall.

On [[August 21]] [[2006]], the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] announced that it would not be renewing ''Stargate SG-1'' for an eleventh season after a series of poor performances in the [[Nielsen Ratings]].<ref name="sg1 cancellation">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6364450.html?display=Breaking+News|title=''Stargate SG-1'' Said To Be Axed|work=MultiChannel News}}</ref> Many fans were enraged at the news, even creating reactionary websites to exhibit their commitment to the series.<ref name="savestargatesg1">{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/fans_rally_savestargatesg1.com.shtml|title=Fans Rally: SaveStargateSG1|work=GateWorld}}</ref> Spokespersons for the production have said all options for the continuation of ''SG-1'' are being considered, including complete digital broadcasting.<ref name="sg1 future">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6366152.html|title=MGM Insists ''Stargate'' Won't Shut|work=MultiChannel News}}</ref> Executive producer [[Robert C.

MGM has since announced the release of two direct-to-DVD SG-1 films for release in 2008. ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]'' will wrap up the Ori storyline, and ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]'' will involve time travel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/10/istargate_sg-1i_movies_coming_to.shtml|title=Stargate SG-1 movies coming to DVD|work=GateWorld}}</ref>  This is intended to be the beginning of a series of SG-1 DVD movies, released at a rate of one per year or so.{{fact|date=December 2007}} ''The Ark of Truth'' is scheduled for a March 11, 2008 release.

===''Stargate Atlantis''===
{{main|Stargate Atlantis}}
[[Image:Sga poster 1.JPG|thumb|The original starring cast of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.]]

''Stargate Atlantis'' began as a [[spin-off]] [[television series]] from ''Stargate SG-1'' that was originally intended to succeed it following a second feature film. The second movie was planned for after the sixth season and, when ''SG-1'' was renewed for another year, for after the seventh season. When ''SG-1'' was renewed again for an eighth season, the intended film became the episode "[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]", a two-part [[season finale]], and the setting of ''Stargate Atlantis'' was moved to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]]. <ref>{{cite book | last = Gosling  | first = Sharon | authorlink = Sharon Gosling | title = Stargate Atlantis: The Official Companion Season 1 | origdate =  | origyear = 2005 | origmonth = July | publisher = Titan Books | location = London | id = ISBN 1-84576-116-2 | pages = 10&ndash;14 | chapter = Watergate }}</ref> This allowed the two shows to exist side-by-side within the same [[fictional universe]], and later on the two shows even began to be interconnected. The show is developed by most of the same people as ''SG-1'', and is produced in the same studios.

''Atlantis'' debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel on [[July 16]], [[2004]], starring [[Joe Flanigan]] and [[Torri Higginson]] in the lead roles, with [[Rainbow Francks|Rainbow Sun Francks]], [[David Hewlett]], and [[Rachel Luttrell]] alongside. Hewlett and Higginson had previously been characters in ''SG-1''. In <i>Atlantis</i>' second season, [[Paul McGillion]] and [[Jason Momoa]] (replacing Francks) were added as regulars. At the end of the third season, Higginson and McGillion were removed as regulars, both serving recurring roles in the 4th season. Season 4 brought in Amanda Tapping, reprising her role as Samantha Carter from SG-1, and [[Jewel Staite]] in a recurring role. The series' 4th season is currently airing on the Sci Fi Channel.

The plot follows the adventures of the "Atlantis expedition", a combination of military forces and civilian scientists that travel to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]] in search of the Lost City of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], left behind by the powerful race known as the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]]. The finding of the city had been a plot arc for most of <i>SG-1</i>'s Season 7, and the Ancients themselves had been a long-running facet of the ''SG-1'' setting. Arriving at the City, the expedition discover that the Pegasus galaxy is dominated by a terrible enemy known as "the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]" whom they must defend themselves against despite being vastly outnumbered.

The series has won several awards for its actors, visual effects and directors, including a [[WorldFest]] Platinum Award for [[David Winning]]'s direction of an early Season 1 episode. ''Atlantis'' proved to be equally as successful as ''SG-1'', with [[Nielson Ratings]] consistently in the regions of 1.9.

===''Stargate Universe''===
{{main|Stargate Universe}}
''Stargate Universe'' is the working title for a third Stargate series which is currently in development.  According to producer Robert C. Cooper, the concept will revolve around the ninth chevron on the Stargate. It is on track to premiere in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gateworld.net/news/2007/03/third_series_is_istargate_univer.shtml| title=Third series is Stargate Universe| work=Gateworld.net| accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref>

===''Stargate Infinity''===
{{main|Stargate Infinity}}
[[Image:Stargate-infinity.jpg|thumb|Characters from ''[[Stargate Infinity]]''.]]

''Stargate Infinity'' was an [[animated series]] spin-off from ''Stargate SG-1'' intended for children aged 9 to 11. It ran from [[14 September]], [[2002]] to [[June 2003]] on the [[FOX]] Network. Even though the series was produced by [[MGM]] with [[DiC Entertainment]], none of the writers and producers of ''Stargate SG-1'' were involved with ''Infinity'', and it is not considered official Stargate [[canon (fiction)|canon]].<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/articles/interviews/wright01.shtml GateWorld &mdash; Interviews: Brad Wright]</ref> The show was canceled after 1 season for its poor reception and ratings.

Set 30 to 40 years in the future, ''Infinity'' tells the story of a team of young recruits led by a veteran member of [[Stargate Command]] that are framed for a crime they did not commit. The team must travel from world to world trying to find a way to clear their name, while protecting a strange alien being discovered in the first episode, which is believed to hold the secret to mysteries surrounding the Stargates and the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] race that built them. Due to its cancellation, none of the major [[plot arc]]s of the series were concluded.

The series featured a strong [[moral]] and [[edutainment|educational]] theme, purposely summarizing each episode with a distinct lesson for its young audience to learn. It focused primarily on the importance of [[teamwork|working together]] and accepting [[xenophobia|differences]] in other cultures or people, whether they be aliens or members of one's own team.

==Books==
{{main|Stargate literature}}

There are three series of novels based on the Stargate franchise, one based on the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' film and two based in the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' [[television show]]s. Short fiction has also been published in the official ''Stargate Magazine''. 

A series of books written by [[Bill McCay]] were published from [[1996]] to [[1999]] that were unofficial sequels to the film. These were produced by consulting the original notes made by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, in an attempt to envision where the film "would have gone". Neither party has commented on whether McCay's interpretation was correct. Despite the fact that he attempted to remain close to the original vision, the subsequent television series ''Stargate SG-1'' (which began under an entirely independent development) developed the story along different lines, making  no attempt to reconcile the plot lines of the books. This marked the first major branching of the franchise.

Later,  from 1999 to 2001, [[ROC (publisher)|ROC]] published four novels based in ''Stargate SG-1'' written by [[Ashley McConnell]]. In 2004, [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Fandemonium|Fandemonium Press]] started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on ''Stargate SG-1''. Due to the conflict with ROC's license, these books were available in  [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], but not in the US. Fandemonium books became available in the US in 2006.

The official ''Stargate Magazine'', produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''.

===Comic books===
{{main|Stargate Comics}}

A series of [[comic book]]s, based on ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'', began to be published by [[Avatar Press]] in [[2003]]. Five have been published to date, with stories by [[James Anthony]] and artwork by [[Jorge Correa]].

==Future of the franchise==
Charles Cohen, executive vice president of MGM Television, has voiced plans to develop further Stargate films and produce a third television series to be titled [[Stargate Universe]] (discounting ''Infinity'' as a Stargate television series), currently in a pre-production concept phase.<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/05/mgm_planning_stargate_film_third.shtml MGM planning Stargate film, third series]. ''Gateworld.net''</ref><ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/12/exclusive_third_istargatei_serie.shtml Exclusive: Third Stargate series in development]. ''Gateworld.net''</ref> Additionally, [[Brad Wright]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]], developers of ''SG-1'' have signed a contract with MGM to produce two ''SG-1''-based films, tentatively titled [[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]] and [[Stargate: Continuum]].  Both films will be direct-to-DVD releases.<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/10/istargate_sg-1i_movies_coming_to.shtml Stargate SG-1 movies coming to DVD] ''Gateworld.net''</ref>  According to actor [[Michael Shanks]], most of the cast and crew of the series have signed on to the movies (though [[Richard Dean Anderson]] will not reprise his role as Gen. [[Jack O'Neill]] for Ark of Truth), set to begin filming on April 15, 2007 and June 1, 2007.<ref>[http://tv.ign.com/articles/751/751455p3.html IGN Interviews Michael Shanks] ''IGN''</ref>

Plans for producing two sequels of the original film were announced by the original film's creator [[Dean Devlin]] at the 2006 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. He has said he is currently in talks with MGM to produce four films and he would like two of them to be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy.<ref name="film_sequels">[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537 Devlin Announces Plans for Stargate Sequels]</ref> In an interview with [[Sci Fi Wire]],<ref>[http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=37194&type=0 SciFi Wire Interview with Devlin]</ref> Devlin says that should the sequels be made, he hopes to enlist [[Kurt Russell]] and [[James Spader]] in the two sequels. These sequels would ignore the 11 years of mythology created by ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' if they are produced.

In the meantime, Lionsgate remains the major rights holder to the original film (any home video or theatrical reissue is now the responsibility of Lionsgate)--this was due to the fact that its predecessor, Live Entertainment, owned home video rights to the [[Carolco Pictures]] library and had also owned international distribution rights, although Carolco itself was on the brink of bankruptcy when they produced this film.

==Stargate as a subject of scholarly analysis==

According to the SF writer [[Vernor Vinge]]: "It‚Äôs a truism that science fiction is always about the present. That is, the stories are simply a reflection of the concerns of the era in which they are written".<ref>http://reason.com/news/show/119237.html Interview in ''ReasonOnline'' magazine May 2007.</ref> Indeed, a scholar - [http://www.janjohnsonsmith.com/index.html Dr. Jan Johnson-Smith] - goes so far as to venture that "[[Seven Days]], Freedom, [[War of the Worlds]], '''[[Stargate SG-1]]''' and Andromeda etc., all have clear militaristic leanings". <ref>p.36 Johnson-Smith, Jan ''American science fiction TV: Star Trek, Stargate and beyond'' (London & New York: I.B.Tauris, 2004).</ref>

==Fandom==

''Gaters'' (singular ''Gater'') is a term that is used to describe a [[fandom|fan]] of the [[Stargate]] [[science fiction]] franchise. The term was first used on the [[usenet]] group alt.tv.stargate-sg1, in 1997, in a discussion about what to call Stargate fans and has since been added to the group's FAQ.  ''Gaters'' was popularised when alt.tv.stargate-sg1's host website (SG-1.net) was shut down when the owner, Sean Fitzgibbons, was offered a brief job with [[MGM]]. This led to the creation of a replacement forum Gaters.net. The term is officially recognised by the show's executive producers in DVD commentaries of the tv show. Gaters participate in conventions such as Gatecon.  There are many online fan clubs for the shows and films and for the cast and crew of the tv series. The terms ''Gatehead'', ''Gaties'' and ''Gate Fans'' are alternatively used by many fans.
