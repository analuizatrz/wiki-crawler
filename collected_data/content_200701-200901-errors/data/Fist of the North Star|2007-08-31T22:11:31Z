{{Nihongo|'''''Fist of the North Star'''''|北斗の拳|Hokuto no Ken|lit. "Fist of the [[Big Dipper]]"'}}, also known as '''''Ken, the Great Bear Fist''''', is a [[manga]] series that was originally serialized from [[1983]] to [[1988]] in the [[Japan]]ese ''[[Weekly Shonen Jump]]'', created by [[Tetsuo Hara]] and [[Buronson]]. The manga spans 245 chapters that were originally reprinted in 27 collected volumes ([[tankōbon]]) under the ''Jump Comics'' imprint.

Set in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post apocalyptic]] world where the Earth is barren and the strong survive by preying on the weak, the series follows the journey of [[Kenshiro]], the successor of ''[[Hokuto Shinken]]'' (北斗神拳, "Divine Fist of the North Star"),<ref name=hokutoshinken>While the name Hokuto Shinken literally means ''Big Dipper God Fist'', the standard translation for the fighting style is the same as its English title, ''Fist of the North Star''. It is also referred as the ''Sacred Martial Arts of the Great Bear'' in Viz Media edition and as ''God Fist of the North Star'' in the Gutsoon! edition.</ref> a secret martial arts style that allows its practitioner to destroy an opponent's body from within by striking into their secret [[Channel (Chinese medicine)|channeling]] points, often resulting in a violent and gruesome death. Kenshiro uses his skills to protect the weak and innocent against the numerous villains that threaten their survival.

''Fist of the North Star'' was one of the ''Weekly Shonen Jump's'' most popular titles during the [[1980's]]. As of 2007, it is the seventh best-selling ''Shonen Jump'' manga of all time in Japan.<ref name=comipress>{{cite web |url=http://comipress.com/article/2007/05/06/1923 |title=Shounen Jump Manga Circulation Numbers|accessdate=2007-07-21 |format=html |work=ComiPress }}</ref> In a poll conducted by [[TV Asahi]] in 2005, the ''Fist of the North Star'' anime series ranked 25 in a list of Top 100 Anime series.<ref name=asahi1>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-09-23/tv-asahi-top-100-anime |title=TV Asahi Top 100 Anime|accessdate=2007-07-21 |format=html |work=Anime News Network }}</ref> In a second poll in 2006, it ranked No. 89.<ref name=asahi2>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-10-13/japan's-favorite-tv-anime |title=Japan's Favorite TV Anime |accessdate=2007-07-21 |format=html |work=Anime News Network }}</ref> In a celebrity version of the poll, it ranked No. 15.

The title ''Fist of the North Star'' is somewhat of a [[mistranslation]] of the Japanese original, as ''Hokuto'' refers not to the [[Polaris|North Star]] [[Polaris]], but to the [[Big Dipper]] [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], which is known in Japan as ''Hokuto Shichisei'' (北斗七星, literally "Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper"). In Japan, the actual North Star is known as ''Hokkyokusei'' (北極星, "North Pole Star") or ''Tenteisei'' (天帝星, "Imperial Star"). In official English localization of the series, the term ''Hokuto'' is usually translated as "North Star" in an effort to maintain consistency with the title.

==Publication history==
===Pilot version===
The original [[One-shot (comics)|one shot]] prototype of ''Hokuto no Ken'', published in the April [[1983]] edition of ''Fresh Jump'', was set in present-day Japan and told the story of a teenager by the name of {{nihongo|Kenshiro Kasumi|霞 拳四郎|Kasumi Kenshirō}}, the successor of the "''[[Hokuto Shinken]]''" [[martial arts]] style, a deadly style which kills or cripples opponents internally by striking [[pressure point]]s. Kenshiro's main adversaries in this incarnation of the story were a rival martial arts school known as the {{nihongo|''Taizanji Kenpo''|泰山寺拳法||"[[Mount Tai|Taishan]] Temple Martial Arts"}}, a secret organization of assassins with influence over the [[Japanese government]]. Kenshiro's girlfriend, Yuki, becomes a witness in one of the organization's [[assassination|hits]] and is subsequently killed by the culprit, with Kenshiro being framed for the crime. This event serves as a catalyst for Kenshiro's war against the Taizanji organization.
A second one-shot, titled ''Hokuto no Ken II'',  was published in the June 1983 issue of ''Fresh Jump''. Both pilots were collected in the second collected volume of ''Tetsu no Don Quixote'' (Tetsuo Hara's prior manga series before ''Hokuto no Ken'').

Tetsuo Hara has stated that he came up with the idea of ''Hokuto no Ken'' from his editor [[Nobuhiko Horie]]. According to Hara, Horie suggested to him that he should draw a manga about "a martial artist who destroys his opponents by striking their acupressure points" based on Hara's wishes to draw a martial arts manga and his knowledge of pressure points.<ref name=raijinhara>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040629155120/www.raijincomics.com/extra/articles/article.aspx?_cid=77 |title=Interview with Hara Tetsuo|accessdate=2007-07-21 |format=html |work=Raijin Comics (waybacked) }}</ref>

===Serialization===
[[Image:Shonen Jump 092683.jpg|thumb|left|''Weekly Shonen Jump'', Issue #41 from 1983, featuring the debut of the ''Hokuto no Ken'' series.]]
The two ''Hokuto no Ken'' one-shots were well-received in ''Fresh Jump'''s reader's survey and when Tetsuo Hara was commissioned to turn ''Hokuto no Ken'' into a weekly series, the task was reportedly too much for Hara to handle alone and manga writer [[Yoshiyuki Okamura]] (who worked on the series under the pen name of [[Buronson]]) was assigned to work with him. The storyline was completely revamped, with the present-day setting being discarded in favor of a ''[[Mad Max]]''-inspired post apocalyptic future. The Taizanji Kenpo school were no longer the main antagonists and Kenshiro, originally a teenager, was now an adult with seven scars on his chest whose design was partly inspired by [[Bruce Lee]].<ref name=ADVBuronson>{{cite web |url=http://www.advfilms.com/titles/fistofthenorthstar/interview.html|title=Interview with Buronson|accessdate=2007-07-21 |format=html |work=ADV Films Presents: New Fist of the North Star }}</ref>

Originally, Tetsuo Hara was contracted to do ''Fist of the North Star'' for a three-year run, but due to its popularity and the publisher's demand, it was extended to a five-year run.<ref name=raijinhara> </ref>

===Later works===
After the manga ended its run, Tetsuo Hara and Buronson wrote a novel based on the manga titled {{nihongo|''Cursed City''|呪縛の街|Jubaku no Machi}}, published by Jump Books in Japan in [[1996]]. It was adapted into a three-part [[OVA]] series titled {{nihongo|''New Fist of the North Star''|新・北斗の拳|Shin Hokuto no Ken}} in [[2003]]. The story is set sometime after the conclusion of the manga.

In [[2001]], Tetsuo Hara began working on a ''Fist of the North Star'' prequel titled {{nihongo|''[[Fist of the Blue Sky]]''|蒼天の拳|Sōten no Ken}}, which is still in serialization in  ''Weekly Comics Bunch''. Set during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in [[1935]], the story stars [[Hokuto Shinken]] predecessor and Kenshiro's namesake, Kenshiro Kasumi.

[[2006]] saw the publication of several manga side-stories based on ''Fist of the North Star'', which were released in conjunction with the release of the movie {{nihongo|''Legend of Raoh: Chapter of Martyred Love''|ラオウ伝 殉愛の書|Raō Den Jun'ai no Sho}}. This series has been dubbed the {{nihongo|''Hokuto Gaiden''|北斗外伝}} series, as each title focuses on a major character from the series.  The following titles had been released:

==Plot overview==

The prologue of ''Fist of the North Star'' informs us that the world was engaged in a global nuclear war in the year [[19XX|199X]]. After the war, the earth's surface became devoid of vegetation, the seas evaporated and civilization was thrown into chaos, turning everyday life into a battle for supplies of uncontaminated food and water, where the strong survive by preying on the weak. However, one man vows to make a difference. [[Kenshiro]] is the successor of the art of [[Hokuto Shinken]], a deadly 1,800 year-old [[ansatsuken|assassination style]] that is only passed down from one master to a chosen son. Kenshiro uses his skills and knowledge to protect the innocent from the bloodthirsty gangs that threaten their survival. Throughout the course of the series, Kenshiro meets several allies and rivals, most of whom are also trained in various martial arts styles.

The series begins with Kenshiro's quest to reclaim his [[fiancee]] Yuria, who was taken from him by his former friend Shin, a master of the rival {{nihongo|''Nanto Seiken''|南斗聖拳||"Sacred Fist of the South Star"}} style.<ref name=Nanto>Like Hokuto, the term Nanto is usually localized in English translations as "South Star" (or "Southern Cross" in the Viz edition, the name of Shin's city). Nanto actually refers to the [[Dipper (Chinese constellation)|South Dipper]], a Chinese asterism that forms part of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. The ''Fighting Mania'' arcade game actually alternates between "South Star" and the literal "South Dipper" in translations. The asterism has no relation to the [[Southern Cross]].</ref> The story later evolves into a successorship struggle between Ken and his three older brothers, who were also trained in the Hokuto Shinken style. Raoh, the eldest of the brothers, has taken on the mantle of {{nihongo|Ken-Ō|拳王||lit. "Fist King"}}, a conqueror who uses his power to restore order through force and tyranny. A major [[sub-plot]] is also introduced in the form of an internal conflict within the Nanto school between its six grand masters, the {{nihongo|''Nanto Roku Seiken''|南斗六聖拳||"Six Sacred Fists of the South Star"}}.

After Raoh's death, the story skips several years. Peace and order has slowly returned to the world, but the return of a civilized world has also brought forth with it the division of social classes. The evil Jakō has taken over the Celestial Empire after the disappearance of the true Empress, turning it into a corrupt force that seeks to extend its regime through oppression, with the {{nihongo|''Gento Kōken''|元斗皇拳||"The Imperial Fist of the Original Star"}} masters forced to do his evil bidding. Kenshiro aids his former sidekicks Bat and Lin, now the leaders of the rebel Hokuto Army, in overthrowing Jakō. But after Jakō is defeated, Lin is kidnapped and taken overseas to the {{nihongo|Land of [[Asura]]|修羅の国|Shura no Kuni}}, the birthplace of the Hokuto Shinken style. The Land of Asura has become a war-torn nation now ruled by the three {{nihongo|''Rashō''|羅将||General of Asura}},  masters of the forbidden {{nihongo|''Hokuto Ryūken''|北斗琉拳||"North Star [[Gemstone|Gem]] Fist"}} style, a branch of the original {{nihongo|Hokuto Family|北斗宗家|Hokuto Sōke}} along with Hokuto Shinken. After Kenshiro defeats Kaioh, the leader of the Rashō, he returns to his country to train Raoh's orphaned son, Ryū, as the next Hokuto Shinken successor.

===English editions===
[[Image:FotNS Master Ed 1.jpg|thumb|right|''Fist of the North Star: Master Edition Vol. 9'', published by Gutsoon.]]
Two different companies attempted to translate the original ''Fist of the North Star'' manga for the English market, although both attempts failed to finish their run. [[VIZ Media|VIZ Communications]] originally published the first sixteen  chapters in eight monthly squarebound comic book issues (two/three chapters per issue) in [[1989]]. Viz resumed publication of the series from [[1995]] to [[1997]], publishing the subsequent 28 chapters of the series in 18 monthly pamphlet-sized issues (each issue containing roughly one chapter and a half) divided into three "parts". Four graphic novel collections were published by Viz: ''Fist of the North Star'', ''Night of the Jackal'', ''Southern Cross'' and ''Blood Brothers''. The Viz edition featured mirrored artwork, as was the standard with English translated manga at the time.

In [[2003]], [[Raijin Comics|Gutsoon! Entertainment]] began publishing a ''Master Edition'' of the series, large squarebound graphic novel installments (eight/nine chapters per volume) that were printed in high quality paper. In addition to sporting a revised translation and retaining the original right-to-left orientation, the ''Master Edition'' of the series also featured new [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] coloring added to the original artwork. Gutsoon ceased publication of the series with Vol. 9 due to the company folding. The license has yet to be picked up by another company.

==Adaptations==
===TV series===
{{see|List of Fist of the North Star episodes}}
[[Image:Hokuto anime.jpg|thumb|right|TV's ''Hokuto no Ken'' title card.]]
[[Image:Hokuto2 anime.jpg|thumb|right|''Hokuto no Ken 2'' title card.]]
''Hokuto no Ken'' was first adaptated into a weekly anime series by [[Toei Animation]]. The series aired on [[Fuji Television]] from [[October 4]], [[1984]] to [[March 5]], [[1987]] and was given the subtitle of {{nihongo|''Seikimatsu Kyūseishu Densetsu''|世紀末救世主伝説||"Legend of the Century's End Savior"}} following episode 22. It was immediately followed by a sequel series, titled ''Hokuto no Ken 2'', which aired from [[March 13]], [[1987]] to [[February 18]], [[1988]]. A combined total of 152 episodes were produced for the two series. Reruns are aired in Japan on the [[satellite television]] network [[Animax]].

To comply with Japanese TV standards, the violence was toned down considerably from the original manga, with much of the gore being discolored via desaturation, and scenes where children die were often rewritten so that Kenshiro would save the child at the last minute. Like many manga-based anime series, [[Filler (media)|filler]] material was added to prevent the series from getting ahead of its source material. 

The first ''Hokuto no Ken'' anime series covers the manga storyline from the beginning up to the Hokuto Shinken successorship dispute storyline and is divided into four main story arcs, each spanning a certain portion of the original manga. The first arc deviates the most from the manga. It covers the introductory chapter with Zeed up to the battle against Devil Rebirth and Jackal, but changes the order of events in order to pad out Shin's role as the ultimate villain for the first 22 episodes by leaving the final fight between Ken and Shin for last.

''Hokuto no Ken 2'' follows the manga after the time-skip following Ken's final battle with Raoh. It centers around Kenshiro's adventure with the now-adult Bat and Lin and spans the latter half of the manga. It ends the story with the final battle with Kaioh, omitting the later storylines following it.

===1986 animated movie===
[[Image:FotNS02.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A promotional illustration of the ''Fist of the North Star'' animated movie.]]
The original ''Fist of the North Star'' animated film by [[Toei Animation]] premiered in Japan on [[March 8]], [[1986]], during the publication of the Last Nanto General arc of the manga and between the airings of episode #66 and #67 of the anime series (during the Souther arc). The movie was intended to be a big-screen treatment of the manga, and avoid the watering-down of violence that came with the TV series. The English-dubbed version was released on VHS in North America by [[Streamline Pictures]] in [[1991]].

In a notable deviation from the series, the film finds time to begin with a detailed peek at the Earth as it was before and during the fabled nuclear devastation. Starting with a calm, surreal look at various points of mother nature, a brief on-screen message then informs the audience of the imminent calamity, followed by unsettling scenes of human life consumed in flame.

The film follows the anime and manga from Kenshiro's defeat at the hands of Shin to the first battle with Raoh, although certain liberties were taken to tell the story in a condensed form. Toki, the second of the four Hokuto Brothers, is never seen or mentioned, while Shin and Rei are the only Nanto Seiken masters to appear in the film. While Yuria's Nanto heritage is mentioned thorought the movie in the Japanese version, her role as the Last Nanto General is downplayed. Mamiya, Rei's love interest, is never seen, partly because Yuria is the heroine in her place. 

Raoh serves as the main antagonist, with Jagi and Shin as the other two major villains. Many other villains from the manga such as the Colonel and Jackal only make cameo appearances as minor henchmen with some of the notable fight scenes involving Zeed, Heart, the Kiba Daioh and Uighur.

There were two endings produced for the film. The original theatrical ending in Japan showed Raoh emerging victorious over Kenshiro, but sparing his life, leaving him to protect Lin. An alternate ending was produced that was closer to the manga which shows the fight ending in a draw, which was the ending featured in the VHS and Laserdisc release of the film in Japan. The English dub version by Streamline Pictures is based on the theatrical version and thus features the original ending. Many Western fans believe that the "draw ending" was the original ending, but this is a common misconception due to the fact that the original ending where Raoh wins is not featured in any of the official home video releases in Japan (although it is included in the Korean DVD edition with its original Japanese soundtrack).

===1995 live-action movie===
An American-produced live-action movie version of ''Fist of the North Star'' was released in 1995, directed by [[Tony Randel]] based on a script by [[Peter Atkins]] and [[Wynne McLaughlin]]. The movie, loosely based on the Shin storyline of the manga, stars [[Gary Daniels]] as Kenshiro, [[Costas Mandylor]] as Shin and Japanese actress [[Isako Washio]] as Yuria, with [[Malcom McDowell]] as Ryuken and [[Chris Penn]] as "Jackal" (actually a renamed Jagi). The movie saw a theatrical release in Japan, but went [[direct-to-video|straight-to-video]] in the US. The Japanese dubbed version used the original voice actors from the 1980s anime series.

The movie had mixed reviews from fans and critics. [[Dave Foster]] of ''[[DVD Times]]'' panned the movie as a poor adaptation and commented that Kenshiro's pressure point techniques "''look rather tame''" in comparison to the way depicted in the manga and anime series.<ref name=DVDTimes>{{cite web|url=http://dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=12395|title=DVD Times - Fist of the North Star|accessdate=2007-07-30| author = Dave Foster}}
</ref>A reviewer from eFilmCritic remarked that Kenshiro's defeat at the hands of Shin "''comes off as standard''" and "''unbelievably goofy''" compared to the 1986 animated movie version.<ref name=efilmcritic>{{cite web|url=http://efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=2071&reviewer=156|title=Movie Review - Fist of the North Star (1995) - eFilmCritic|accessdate=2007-07-30|author = Ben Nieporent}}</ref>

===''New Fist of the North Star''===
''New Fist of the North Star'' (新・北斗の拳, ''Shin Hokuto no Ken'') is a three-part [[OVA]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]] that was originally released in [[2003]] and [[2004]] in Japan. It is based on an original ''Hokuto no Ken'' novel written by Buronson and Hara titled ''Jubaku no Machi'' (呪縛の街, "The Cursed City"), whom the first episode of the trilogy draws its title from. It was fully licensed and released in English by [[ADV Films]]. [[Akira Kamiya]], who had voiced Kenshiro in all previous anime incarnations, was replaced by [[Takehito Koyasu]] for this new OVA series. Celebrity voices were also employed, with musician [[Gackt]] (who also performs the opening and ending themes of the OVA) as the antagonist Seiji. It was the last animated incarnation of ''Hokuto no Ken'' produced by Toei.

Set sometime after the end of ''Hokuto no Ken 2'' and the original manga, a man named Sanga has constructed a fortified zone called The Last Land. While Sanga's men go out and seek water through violent means, they encounter Kenshiro who desires to end their reign of terror.

===''Shin Kyūseishu Densetsu'' movie series===
[[Image:Hokuto no ken junnainosyou.jpg|thumb|right|Theatrical poster for ''Raoh Den - Jun'ai no Shō''.]]
In 2005, North Stars Pictures and [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha|TMS Entertainment]] announced the production of a planned five part ''Hokuto no Ken'' [[film series]] titled {{nihongo|''Shin Kyūseishu Densetsu''|真救世主伝説||"True Saviour Legend"}}.<ref name=2006movies>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsp.tv/whatnew.cgi?mode=detail&number=4|title=劇場版映画“北斗の拳「ラオウ外伝」純愛編”を2006年春全国東宝系公開|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> The films are both, remakes of and supplemental stories to the original manga series, and introduces a new supporting character in the form of Reina (whose character designs were contributed by ''[[City Hunter]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Tsukasa Hojo]]). The film series will be composed of three theatrical films, with two [[OVA]] installments released between them. The films uses a different cast of [[seiyū|voice actors]] than the older anime series, with [[Hiroshi Abe (actor)|Hiroshi Abe]] ([[Kenshiro]]), [[Takashi Ukaji]] ([[Raoh]]), [[Kou Shibasaki]] (Reina) and [[Yuriko Ishida]] (Yuria) in the lead roles, all of whom are better known for their live-action work than voice acting. This film series has yet to be licensed for an official English adaptation.

==Characters==
{{main|Characters in Fist of the North Star}}
''Fist of the North Star'' has a large ensemble of characters that has changed constantly during the series' original five-year run. Among the inhabitants of the post-apocalyptic world of ''Fist of the North Star'' includes martial artists, royal families, rebels, bandits and mere villagers that are merely attempting to survive a cruel and harsh world. 

Although protagonist [[Kenshiro]] is the only truly permanent character from the series' inception up until the final chapter, his two [[sidekick]]s, [[Bat (Fist of the North Star)|Bat]] and [[Lin (Fist of the North Star)|Lin]] have serve as series' mainstays as well, introduced as a pair of orphaned children whom Kenshiro meets during the first chapter of the series and then growing up into rebel leaders and heroes in their own right. 

Kenshiro encounters several rivals and allies throughout the course of the series, many of whom are affiliated with the martial arts schools featured in the series (see [[#Fighting styles|fighting styles]] section). The series initially focuses on two rival factions, the [[Hokuto Shinken]] school and the [[Nanto Seiken]] school. [[Characters in Fist of the North Star#Shin|Shin]], a representative of Nanto Seiken, serves as Kenshiro's first major nemesis, being the man responsible for engraving the seven stab wounds on Kenshiro's chest and kidnapping his fiancee [[Characters in Fist of the North Star#Yuria|Yuria]]. After Shin's death, the authors would expand the storyline by introducing other Hokuto and Nanto disciples, namely the Nanto Roku Seiken and the four Hokuto brothers. A major recurring antagonist is introduced in the form of [[Raoh]], the eldest of the four Hokuto brothers, who would become the series' most prominent villain.

After Raoh's death, the [[Characters in Fist of the North Star#Gento Koken|Gento Kōken]] fighters and their leader Falco would serve as reluctant adversaries of Kenshiro. Another group of antagonists are introduced with the fighters from the Land of Asura. Their ruler of Asura, [[Characters in Fist of the North Star#Hokuto Ryuken|Kaioh]] of the Hokuto Ryuken school, is the last major nemesis Kenshiro confronts in the series, although other villains appear after him in the manga.

Many of the characters in the series have since become stars of their own spinoff manga (see [[#Later works|later works]]).

== Fighting styles ==
{{see|List of fighting styles in Fist of the North Star}}
The primary fighting style depicted in ''Fist of the North Star'' is ''[[Hokuto Shinken]]'', the style used by Kenshiro and his three adopted brothers. ''Hokuto Shinken'' relies primarily on 708 secret [[accupressure]] points on the human's body that forms part of a fictional system known as the {{nihongo|''keiraku hikō''|経絡秘孔||"secret [[Channel (Chinese medicine)|chaneling]] points"}}. By pushing into one of the ''hikō'' points, one can cause destruction into the enemy's body from within or even control their body against their own will. There are also beneficial ''hikō'' points that can be used to cure sickness or heal wounds, including restore a mute person's voice or a blind person's sight. In addition, the masters of ''Hokuto Shinken'' can tap into their body's full potential strength, whereas an average person only uses 30% of their strength.

The main rival style of ''Hokuto Shinken'' in the beginning of the series is ''[[Nanto Seiken]]'', a style which is described as the [[yin and yang|polar opposite]] of ''Hokuto Shinken''. In contrast to the ''Hokuto'' style, which uses the ''hikō'' points to cause destruction from within, the ''Nanto'' style specializes in stabbing and slicing techniques that penetrate the body from the outside and destroy everything in its path. Originally the style is used by Shin, the first major antagonist, but throughout the course of the series the existence of other branches of the ''Nanto Seiken'' are revealed, the six top branches being the ''Nanto Roku Seiken''.

Two other major styles are introduced during the latter half of the series; ''Gento Kōken'', a style which specializes in  [[qi|ki]]-based projectile attacks that destroy the enemy on a cellular level; and ''Hokuto Ryūken'', a brother style of ''Hokuto Shinken'' which causes destruction through an opponent's {{nihongo|''keiraku hakō''|経絡破孔||"destructive [[Channel (Chinese medicine)|chaneling]] points"}} and teaches its users to summon their {{nihongo|"demonic aura"|魔闘気|matōki}}.

==Merchandise==
A variety of licensed ''Hokuto no Ken'' merchandise has been released in Japan thorought the years by numerous companies, including [[Kaiyodo]] [[Bandai]], [[Banpresto]], [[Sammy]] and [[Sega]]. Merchandise includes [[t-shirt]]s, [[action figure]]s, [[PVC]] [[figurines]], resin kits, bust models, [[wall scroll]]s, [[collectable card game]]s ''[[Keshi]]'' figurines (including [[keshi#Keshi types|SDkeshi]]) were released in Japan by [[Bandai]] during the 1980s. Sammy has produced licensed "''Pachi-Slot''" (combination [[pachinko]] and [[slot machine]]) machine titled ''Pachi-Slot Hokuto no Ken''. It has inspired a series of video game versions titled ''[[Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshōhō! Hokuto no Ken]]'' and an upcoming sequel titled ''Pachi-Slot Hokuto no Ken 2''.

==Video games==
{{see|List of Fist of the North Star video games}}
Several [[video game]]s were produced based on the license. Toei Doga published a series of seven [[console game]]s for the [[Famicom]] and then the [[Super Famicom]], evolving from a pair of side-scrolling [[action game]]s (''Hokuto no Ken'' and ''Hokuto no Ken 2'', the latter which was published in North America as ''Fist of the North Star''), to a trilogy of [[Console RPG|RPGs]] (''Hokuto no Ken 3-5'') and then a pair of [[fighting game]]s (''Hokuto no Ken 6'' and ''7''). Another fighting game was also produced for the [[Game Boy]] (released in North America as ''Fist of the North Star: 10 Big Brawls for the King of Universe''), one of the system's earlier attempts at the genre. At the same time, Sega also published a pair of ''Hokuto no Ken'' action games for the [[Sega Master System|Mark III]] and [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive]], which were both released internationally without the ''Hokuto no Ken'' license as ''[[Black Belt (video game)|Black Belt]]'' and ''[[Last Battle (video game)|Last Battle]]'' respectively. A ''Hokuto no Ken'' [[visual novel]] was released in [[1995]] for the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation]]. A 3D action game was also released exclusively for the PlayStation in [[2000]] titled ''Hokuto no Ken: Seikimatsu Kyūseishu Densetsu'', which adapts the storyline of the first anime series. [[Sammy Corporation]] also produced video game adaptations of their popular [[PachiSlot]] games for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Wii]]. 

[[Arcade games]] based on the series includes the two ''[[Fighting Mania]]'' games released by [[Konami]] and an [[Fist of the North Star (versus fighting game)|arcade fighting game]] designed by [[Arc System Works]] (of ''[[Guilty Gear]]'' fame).
