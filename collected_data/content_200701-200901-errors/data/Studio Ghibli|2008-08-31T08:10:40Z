==Name==
The name [[wiktionary:ghibli|Ghibli]] derives from the nickname the [[Italy|Italians]] used for their [[Sahara]]n scouting planes in the [[Second World War]] (and later for the [[AMX International AMX]]), which is derived from the [[Libyan Arabic|Libyan]] word for ''hot wind blowing through the [[Sahara Desert]]'' (also known as [[sirocco]]).<ref name="SG1">''The Birth of Studio Ghibli'', ''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'' DVD, Walt Disney Home Entertainment, 2005.</ref>

Though the Italian word is pronounced with hard /g/, the Japanese pronunciation of the studio's name is {{IPA2|dʑíbɯɺi}} ''{{Audio|Ghibli.ogg|listen}}''. The theory behind the name was that the studio was blowing a new wind into the Japanese anime industry.<ref name="SG2">''The Birth of Studio Ghibli'', ''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'' DVD, Walt Disney Home Entertainment, 2005.</ref>

==History==
Founded in 1985, it is headed by the acclaimed director [[Hayao Miyazaki]] along with his colleague and mentor [[Isao Takahata]], as well as the studio's executive managing director and long-time producer [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]]. Its origins date back to 1983, with the film ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind]]'', which was popularized as a serialized [[manga]] in a publication of [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s ''[[Animage]]'' magazine after the original screenplay was rejected. The film was eventually produced by Topcraft and the film's success spurred the formation of Ghibli. Much of Ghibli's works are distributed in [[Japan]] by the noted film distributor [[Toho]]. Tokuma is the parent company of Studio Ghibli, and it has provided [[the Walt Disney Company]] with the video rights to all of Ghibli's output that did not have previous international distribution, including the global, non-Japan distribution rights to ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and ''[[Spirited Away]]''. Miyazaki's film, ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'', was based on a book by British author [[Diana Wynne Jones]], published in several countries including Canada and the United States. Composer [[Joe Hisaishi]] has provided the soundtrack for all of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films.

The most famous and lauded film from the studio that was not directed by Miyazaki is ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'', directed by [[Isao Takahata]], a sad film focusing on the lives of two war orphans towards the end of [[Second World War]] in Japan.  This and ''[[Only Yesterday (film)|Only Yesterday]]'' are the only films which Disney has declined to distribute.

Over the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio Ghibli and the magazine ''[[Animage]]'', which regularly runs exclusive articles about the studio and its members in a section titled "Ghibli Notes." Artwork from Ghibli's films and other works frequently graces the cover of the magazine. 

The company is well-known for its strict "no-edits" policy in licensing their films abroad. This has stemmed from the disastrous dubbing of Miyazaki's ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind]]'' when the film was released in the [[United States]] as ''[[Warriors of the Wind]]''. The film was heavily edited and [[Americanized]], with significant portions cut and the plot rewritten. The "no cuts" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman [[Harvey Weinstein]] suggested editing ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' to make it more marketable. In response, a Studio Ghibli producer sent an authentic [[katana]] with a simple message: "No cuts".<ref>{{cite news |title=A god among animators |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1569689,00.html 
|first=Xan |last=Brooks |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=[[2005-09-14]] |quote=There is a rumour that when Harvey Weinstein was charged with handling the US release of Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki sent him a samurai sword in the post. Attached to the blade was a stark message: 'No cuts.' / The director chortles. 'Actually, my producer did that.' |accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>

Miyazaki's latest film, ''[[Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea]]'', was released in Japan on [[July 19]], [[2008]].

On [[February 1]] [[2008]], Toshi Suzuki stepped down from the position of Studio Ghibli president which he held since 2005, and [[Koji Hoshino]] (former president of Walt Disney Japan) took over. Suzuki said he wanted to improve films with his own hands as a producer, rather than demanding this from his employees. He has revealed that Takahata and Goro Miyazaki (director of ''[[Tales from Earthsea (film)|Tales from Earthsea]]'' and Hayao's son) are developing projects for release after Hayao Miyazaki's ''Ponyo''. Suzuki decided to hand over the presidency to Hoshino because Hoshino has helped Studio Ghibli sell its videos since 1996, as well as helped to release the ''Princess Mononoke'' film in the United States.<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://mainichi.jp/enta/mantan/news/20080201mog00m200025000c.html |title=スタジオジブリ社長に星野康二氏 |accessdate=2008-02-01 |language=Japanese}}</ref>
