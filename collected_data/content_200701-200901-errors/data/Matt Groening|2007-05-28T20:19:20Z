==Early life==
Groening grew up in [[Portland, Oregon]], the middle child of five children. His mother Margaret was once a teacher and his father Homer was a filmmaker, advertiser, writer and cartoonist.<ref name="prodigy">{{cite web | title=Matt Groening Q&A (1993) | work=[[The Simpsons Archive]] | url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening00a.html | date=June 1993 | accessmonthday=January 14 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

He attended [[The Evergreen State College]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], a progressive school which he called "a hippie college, with no grades or required classes, that drew every creative weirdo in the Northwest."<ref name="laweekly">{{cite web | title=Life in the 31st Century | date=1999-03-24 | last=Lloyd | first=Robert | work=LA Weekly | url=http://www.laweekly.com/ink/99/18/tv-lloyd.php | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> He served as the Editor-in-Chief of the campus newspaper, ''The Cooper Point Journal'' and he was a regular writer and occasional cartoonist for the paper.  He became friends with [[Lynda Barry]] after discovering she had written a fan letter to [[Joseph Heller]], one of Groening’s favorite authors, and had gotten a reply back.<ref name="cartoon">{{Comic strip reference | cartoonist=Groening, Matt | strip=[[Life in Hell]] | date=[[January 14]], [[2000]] | syndicate=Acme Features Syndicate | panel=5-6 }}</ref>

==Career==
In 1977, at the age of 23, Groening moved to [[Los Angeles]] to become a [[writer]]. He described life in Los Angeles to his friends in the form of a [[comic book]], and called it ''[[Life in Hell]]'' which was loosely inspired by a chapter entitled “How to Go to Hell” in [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann's]] book ''Critique of Religion and Philosophy''.<ref name="mygeneration">{{cite web | title=Matt Groening | date=May -June 2001 | last=McKenna | first=Kristine | work=My Generation | url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening01a.html | accessmonthday=February 3 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Groening started the comic in 1977 by photocopying and distributing it in the book corner of Licorice Pizza, the record store he was working in. He made his first professional cartoon sale to the avant-garde [[wet (magazine)|''Wet'' magazine]] in 1978. The strip, entitled “Forbidden Words”, appeared in the September/October issue and by 1980 the strip had become so popular in the [[Underground culture|underground]] that it was picked up by the ''[[Los Angeles Reader]]''.<ref name="Planet Simpson">{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Chris | title=Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation | id=ISBN 0-679-31318-4}}</ref>

In 1982, the editor of the ''Reader'' gave Groening his own weekly rock and roll column, "Sound Mix". However, the column would rarely be about rock and roll, as he would instead write more about his life and childhood, his [[pet peeves]], and even things he found in the street. “I think the people who ran the ''Reader'' felt so guilty about how little they were paying people that they let them write about whatever they wanted”, Groening later reflected.<ref name="laweekly"/> In an effort to add more rock to the column, he would often simply make up stuff, writing reviews of fictional bands and non-existent records. The following week, he would confess to fabricating everything in the previous column, then swear that everything in the new column was true. Finally, he was asked to give up the "music" column and perhaps write a humor column under a different title.<ref name="royale">{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |title=Simpsons Comics Royale |chapter=My Rock 'n' Roll Life, Part One: So You Want To Snort Derisively |pages=92-93 |year=2001 |publisher=Perennial |location=New York |isbn=0-060-93378-X}}</ref>

In the late 1980s, Groening drew several print [[advertisements]] for [[Apple Computer]] in the form of ''Life in Hell'' comic strips.<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/mbishop/PhotoAlbum30.html Matt Groening Apple Ad from 1989]</ref> The strip is still carried in 250 weekly newspapers and has been [[anthology|anthologized]] in a series of books, including ''School is Hell'', ''Childhood is Hell'', ''Work is Hell'', ''The Big Book of Hell'' and ''The Huge Book of Hell''.<ref name=officialsite/>

===''The Simpsons''===
{{Main|The Simpsons}}
[[Image:Simpsons on Tracey Ullman.png|thumb|250px|left|Groening's first drawing of the Simpsons, circa [[1987]].]]
''[[Life in Hell]]'' caught the attention of [[Hollywood]] [[writer]]-[[Film producer|producer]] and [[Gracie Films]] founder [[James L. Brooks]], who had been shown the strip by fellow producer Polly Platt.<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video|people=BBC|year=2000|title=The Simpsons: America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/|format=DVD|location=UK|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="kim">{{cite web | title=Keep 'em Laughing |date=October 1999 | last=Kim | first=John W. | work=Scr(i)pt | url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening99d.html | accessmonthday=January 14 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in [[animation]] on an undefined future project. That project would turn out to be developing a series of short animation skits (now known as [[The Simpsons shorts]]), called “bumpers”, to be featured on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] variety show ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his ''Life in Hell'' characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new. Reportedly, he designed the look of the [[Simpson family]] in only fifteen minutes.<ref name="video">http://www.movieweb.com/video/V07E89opqyACDW</ref>

Groening [[storyboard]]ed and scripted every short, which were then animated by a team including [[David Silverman]] and [[Wes Archer]], both of whom would later become [[Film director|directors]] on the series.<ref name="silverman">{{cite web | title=The David Silverman Interview | last=Heintjes | first=Tom | work=Hogan's Alley | url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp | accessmonthday=January 13 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> 

Premiering on the Tracey Ullman Show on [[April 19]], [[1987]], the shorts became very popular, which led to a half-hour [[spin-off]] in 1989. The [[The Simpsons|series]] quickly became a worldwide phenomenon, to the surprise of many. Groening said: “Nobody thought The Simpsons was going to be a big hit. It snuck up on everybody."<ref name="laweekly"/>  

Matt Groening is credited with writing or co-writing "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons episode)|Some Enchanted Evening]]", "[[The Telltale Head]]", "[[Colonel Homer]]" and "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]". 

Attempts at spin-offs have been unsuccessful. In 1994, Groening and other ''Simpsons'' producers pitched a [[live-action]] [[spin-off]] about [[Krusty the Clown]] (with [[Dan Castellaneta]] playing the lead role), but were unsuccessful in getting the show off the ground.<ref name="npr">From a radio interview with Groening that aired on the [http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&prgDate=22 Apr 98 April 22, 1998 edition] of ''[[Fresh Air]]'' on [[NPR]]. [http://www.npr.org/ramfiles/fa/19980422.fa.ram Link to stream] (''13 minutes, 21 seconds in'')</ref><ref name="avclub" /> Groening has also pitched "Young [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]" and a spin-off about the non-Simpsons citizens of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]].<ref name=shortfilms>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Oakley, Bill;, Weinstein, Josh; Appel, Richard; Cohen, David; Pulido, Rachel; Smith, Yeardley; Reardon, Jim; Silverman, David|year=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "22 Short Films About Springfield"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

In 1995, Groening got in a major disagreement with [[James L. Brooks|Brooks]] and other Simpsons producers over "[[A Star Is Burns]]", a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] episode with ''[[The Critic]]'', an animated show also produced by Brooks and staffed with many former Simpsons crew members. Groening feared that viewers would "see it as nothing but a pathetic attempt to advertise ''The Critic'' at the expense of The Simpsons",<ref name="flux">{{cite web | title=Life in Hell | work=Flux Magazine | url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening95.html | last=Paul | first=Alan | date=1995-09-30 | accessmonthday=December 26 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> and was concerned about the implication that he had created or produced ''The Critic''. He requested his name be taken off the episode. 

He has had several [[cameo appearance]]s in the show, with a speaking role in the episode "[[My Big Fat Geek Wedding]]". He currently serves at ''The Simpsons'' as a [[Creative Consultant|creative consultant]], as well as a writer and producer on the upcoming [[The Simpsons Movie|movie]].<ref name="simpsonmovie">{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940840?categoryid=14&cs=1|title=Homer going to bat in '07|accessdate=2006-07-03|author=Fleming, Michael|date=[[2006-04-02]]|publisher=Variety.com}}</ref>

====''Simpsons'' character names====
{{main|List of The Simpsons name origins}}
Groening named the main Simpson characters after members of his own family: his parents, Homer and Margaret (Marge or Marjorie in full), and his younger sisters, Lisa and Margaret (Maggie). As for himself, he decided it was a bit too obvious to name a character after himself and chose the name "Bart" (an [[anagram]] of brat). However, he stresses that aside from some of the sibling rivalry, his family is nothing like the Simpsons.<ref name="Planet Simpson"/>  Groening also has an older brother and sister, Mark and Patty, but these siblings were left out of the main Simpson family. In a 1995 interview, he divulged that Mark “is the actual inspiration for Bart.”<ref name="flux"/>

Groening says he refused to name [[Abraham Simpson|Homer's dad]] after his own father's  dad, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. He says that the writers named the character Abraham, which by coincidence turned out to be the name of Groening's grandfather. Homer and Abraham are also the names of Groening's two sons.<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Old Money"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The name “Wiggum” for police chief [[Clancy Wiggum]] was Groening's mother's maiden name. The names of [[List of characters from The Simpsons|a few other characters]] were taken from major street names in Groening's hometown of [[Portland, Oregon]], including [[Flanders family|Flanders]], [[List of characters from The Simpsons#The Lovejoy family|Lovejoy]], [[Herb Powell|Powell]], [[Joe Quimby|Quimby]], [[List of characters from The Simpsons#Kearney|Kearney]], and [[Sideshow Bob|Terwilliger]].<ref name="Portland">{{cite web | title=Painting the town in Portland | date=2007-01-06 | last=Blake | first=Joseph | work=The Vancouver Sun | url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/travel/story.html?id=f90268d8-6a5b-438d-9509-f03ecff27cc1 | accessmonthday=January 13 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===''Futurama''===
{{Main|Futurama}}
After spending a few years researching [[science fiction]], Groening got together with ''Simpsons'' writer/producer [[David X. Cohen]] (still known as David S. Cohen at the time) and developed ''[[Futurama]]'', an animated series about life in the year 3000. By the time they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and story lines. Groening described trying to get the show on the air as "by far the worst experience of [his] grown-up life.".<ref name="motherjones">{{cite web | title=Matt Groening | work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | url=http://www.motherjones.com/arts/qa/1999/03/groening.html | last=Doherty | first=Brian | date=March /April 1999 | accessmonthday=January 14 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> His sole writing credit for the show was "[[Space Pilot 3000]]", co-written with David X. Cohen. 
 
After five years on the air, the show was cancelled by [[20th Century Fox]]. However, in a similar situation to ''[[Family Guy]]'', strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Teletoon]] have brought Futurama back to life, which is slated for four direct-to-DVD movies, as confirmed by Groening in an [[April 2006]] interview.<ref name="avclub">{{cite web | title=Matt Groening | date=2006-04-26 | last=Rabin | first=Nathan | work=[[The Onion AV Club]] | url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771 | accessmonthday=January 14 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> [[Comedy Central]] commissioned 13 new episodes to be aired in 2008.<ref name=reuters>{{cite web|author=Wallenstein, Andrew|url=http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/va/20060622/115104459800.html|title="Futurama" gets new life on Comedy Central|publisher=Reuters|date=[[June 22]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref>

===Other===
In 1994, Groening formed [[Bongo Comics|Bongo Comics Group]] (named after the character Bongo from [[Life in Hell]]) with [[Steve Vance]], [[Cindy Vance]] and [[Bill Morrison (comics)|Bill Morrison]], which publishes [[The Simpsons|Simpsons]] and [[Futurama]] comics (including a two-part comic special entitled  ''Futurama Simpsons Infinitely Secret Crossover Crisis'', a [[fictional crossover]] between the two), as well as a few original titles. The goal with Bongo is to "[try] to bring humor into the fairly grim comic book market".<ref name="flux" /> He also formed [[Zongo Comics]] in 1995, an imprint of Bongo that published comics for more mature readers, which included three issues of [[Mary Fleener|Mary Fleener's]] ''Fleener'' and seven issues of Groening's close friend [[Gary Panter|Gary Panter's]] "Jimbo" comics. 

He plays the [[cowbell]] in the all-author [[rock and roll]] band [[Rock Bottom Remainders|The Rock Bottom Remainders]], whose members include [[Dave Barry]], [[Ridley Pearson]], [[Scott Turow]], [[Amy Tan]], [[James McBride (musician)|James McBride]], [[Mitch Albom]], [[Roy Blount Jr.]], [[Stephen King]], [[Kathi Goldmark]], and [[Greg Iles]].<ref>[http://www.rockbottomremainders.com/ Rock Bottom Remainders Official site] URL accessed on [[March 4]], [[2007]]</ref>
