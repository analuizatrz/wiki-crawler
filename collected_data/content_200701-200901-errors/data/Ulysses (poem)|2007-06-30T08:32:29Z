'''"Ulysses"''' is a [[Victorian era|Victorian]]-era poem by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] (1809–1892), written by [[October 20]], [[1833]],<ref>Tennyson, A. T., & Day, A. (1991), 360.</ref> but not published until 1842 in his second collection of ''Poems''. An aged Ulysses narrates the poem. He has become dissatisfied with his life as the king of [[Homer's Ithaca|Ithaca]], a rocky island off the [[Gulf of Corinth]] near Greece. 

Many literary figures have written about Ulysses since [[Homer]] introduced [[Odysseus]] (the same character, in Greek) in his ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' between 800 and 600 [[Anno Domini|BC]]. After Homer, authors such as Dante and Shakespeare presented Ulysses in new contexts. In Tennyson's poem, Ulysses has returned to Ithaca, having been absent for twenty years—first fighting in the [[Trojan War]], then journeying home. With his travels at an end, he rejoins his wife [[Penelope]] and son [[Telemachus]] but feels restless and yearns to explore again.

The poem is a [[dramatic monologue]] with 70 lines of [[blank verse]]. Its strongly accented, unrhymed [[iambic pentameter]] uses unadorned and forceful language that expresses Ulysses' conflicting moods. The many [[enjambment|enjambed]] lines give a flow to the monologue that suggests restlessness. The word "Ulysses" (more correctly "Ulixes") is the Latin form of the Greek "[[Odysseus]]", source of the word "odyssey".

The basic approach to understanding "Ulysses" is to read the poem with knowledge of the state of Tennyson's life when he wrote it.<ref>Hughes, 195.</ref> Tennyson penned "Ulysses" after the death of his Cambridge friend, the poet [[Arthur Henry Hallam]] (1811–1833). Hallam was a gifted young poet who some thought destined to be a great statesman.<ref>Hughes, 197.</ref> The two friends talked of the nature of poetry and truth and wrote verse together. They had traveled to Germany and Spain.  Upon hearing of his close friend's death, Tennyson was living in [[Somersby, Lincolnshire|Somersby]], [[Lincolnshire]] in close quarters with his mother and nine of his ten siblings. His father had died in 1831, forcing Tennyson to move home from Cambridge to become the head of household. Following his father's death and his increased domestic responsibilities, Tennyson's friends had become concerned about his mental and physical health. The family had little income, and two of Tennyson's brothers were mentally ill. Tennyson was adjusting to his new domestic duties, regaining contact with friends, and traveling often to London, having recently published his 1832 volume of poems. Then the news of Hallam's death arrived on [[October 1]], [[1833]]. Tennyson shared his grief with his sister, [[Emilia Tennyson|Emily]], who had lost her future husband.

The emotional gulf between the state of his domestic affairs and this loss of a special friendship, one which Tennyson found glamorous and glorious, informs the reading of "Ulysses"—particularly its treatment of the domestic theme. At one moment, Ulysses' discontent in Ithaca seems to mirror Tennyson's, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief.  At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by traveling again. Tennyson said that his poem "gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life".<ref>Quoted in Tennyson, A. T., & Roberts, A. (2000), 567.</ref>  It may be that Ulysses' determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth.<ref>Hughes, 199.</ref> "There is more about myself in ''Ulysses'', which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, but that still life must be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of [Hallam's] loss upon me than many poems in ''In Memoriam''."<ref>Quoted in Hughes, 195.</ref> Tennyson memorialized Hallam in another highly regarded poem, "[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]", completed seventeen years later.

=== Literary context ===
 
[[Image:Blake Dante Hell XXVI Ulisses.jpg|thumb|150px|[[William Blake]] painted scenes of Dante's ''Inferno''. In Canto XXVI Ulysses and [[Diomedes]] are condemned in flames.]]

Poets have long written about Ulysses, among them Homer, [[Euripides]], [[Horace]], [[Dante]], [[Shakespeare]], and [[Alexander Pope|Pope]]. Dante's ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'' tells Ulysses' story in [[Canto]] XXVI, where he is placed in the eighth pit of the eighth circle of Hell. A modified and modernized character came to pass in [[James Joyce]]'s great novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and [[Ezra Pound]]'s poem ''[[The Cantos]]''. Tennyson's poem is considered the first "modern" account of Ulysses.<ref>Stanford, 202.</ref>

To Dante, Ulysses, with his "zeal…/T'explore the world", is an evil counselor who lusts for adventure at the expense of his family and domestic life in Ithaca.<ref>Rowlinson (1994), 241.</ref> Tennyson projects this "zeal" into Ulysses' unquenched desire for knowledge.<ref>Schwarz, 39.</ref> According to the legend recounted in the ''Inferno'', Ulysses perishes at sea before returning to Ithaca. In the Homeric narrative, Ulysses' travels end in Ithaca, him having lost his mariners at sea—which puts the two narratives in contradiction.

Tennyson adopts aspects of the Ulysses character and narrative from many sources, especially from Homer and Dante.  The varied moods and the ambiguity of "Ulysses" challenge interpretation, according to [[W. B. Stanford]], who surveys the Ulysses character in literature.<ref>Stanford, 202.</ref> He finds that Tennyson's Ulysses speaks in five voices, recalling not only Homer and Dante, but also Shakespeare's Ulysses, [[Byron]]'s [[Childe Harold]], and Grenville, Tennyson's own character. The ''Odyssey'' provides the narrative scenery, but Tennyson's Ulysses is not the lover of public affairs of Homer's poems. In fact, Ulysses the man was not particularly praised in the Victorian era. Though a hero, Tennyson's Ulysses is prideful. He is discontent with staid existence and romanticizes his position, like a [[Byronic hero]]. He allows his personal pride to endanger lives. 

The voice of Dante's doomed hero speaks loudest toward the conclusion of the poem—in which Ulysses asks his mariners to join him on one last adventure—and at the end of the first movement: 

<poem>
     And this gray spirit yearning in desire
     To follow knowledge like a sinking star,
     Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.
</poem>

The influence of Shakespeare appears momentarily in the early movement. The savage race "that hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me" echoes [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]’s [[soliloquy]], "What is a man, / If his chief good and market of his time / Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more."<ref>IV, iv. 32 ff., quoted in Bush, Douglas (Jan 1943). "Tennyson's 'Ulysses' and 'Hamlet'." ''The Modern Language Review'', 38(1), 38.</ref> Ulysses is a character in Shakespeare's ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''. Tennyson's "How dull it is pause, to make an end, / to rust unburnish’d, not to shine in use!" recalls Shakespeare's character:<ref>''Troilus and Cressida'', Act III, Scene III, quoted in Stanford, 203.</ref>

<poem>
                  perserverance, my dear lord,
     Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
     Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail,
     In monumental mockery.
</poem>

With the arrival of the second stanza—the content and tone of which have been criticized as inconsistent with the overall poem—the Byronic mood returns briefly. Ulysses expresses his contempt for his son, who is content with the confines of home and duty. 

According to Stanford, the decisive influence asserts itself with the arrival of third movement.  Ulysses turns his attention first from himself, then from the cause of his restlessness. He speaks now of ports, broad seas, and his mariners. Calling his men to action, he recalls the last words of Dante's Ulysses. The strain of discontent and weakness in old age never leaves the poem, but Tennyson has left Ulysses to "strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield", recalling the Dantesque desire for knowledge, and has infused the character with English sea legend, representing spirit and scientific enterprise.  A modern Ulysses has been born, set for a new age of scientific optimism and colonialism.<ref>Stanford, 204.</ref>	

=== Ulysses as narrator ===

The degree to which Tennyson identifies with Ulysses has been one of the great debates among scholars of the poem.<ref>Hughes.</ref> If Tennyson endorses the speaker, the speech may be read without [[irony]]; if the poet departs from this identification, alternative, "ironic" readings avail themselves. Until the early twentieth century, readers reacted to the poem affirmatively—that is, without ironic interpretation. The poem became more controversial as Tennyson's stature rose.<ref>Hughes, 200.</ref> Since Paull F. Baum argued in 1948 that Ulysses recalled [[Paradise Lost|Milton's Satan]],<ref>Baum, P. F. (1948). ''Tennyson sixty years after.'' Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press. Cited in Hughes (1979).</ref> the weight of ironic interpretations increased, and they were countered by more non-ironic ones. Key to the straightforward readings of "Ulysses" is the biographical context of the poem, taking into account Tennyson's statements on writing it, and considering that he would not undermine Ulysses' determination with irony when such a stalwartness was precisely what Tennyson needed to continue in the face of Hallam's death.<ref>Hughes, 194.</ref>

Ulysses' apparent disdain for those around him forms a major part of the ironic perspective. Ulysses declares that he is "matched with an aged wife"; seems to indicate his weariness in governing a "savage race"; and suggests his philosophical distance from his son Telemachus. A stronger reading of the second movement finds it a condescending tribute to his son and a rejection of Telemachus's "slow prudence". However, the adjectives used to describe Telemachus—"blameless", "discerning", and "decent"—are words with positive connotations in other of Tennyson's poetry and within the classical tradition.<ref>Hughes, 194.</ref>

Tennyson asserts the inseparability of Ulysses, the person, with his name.<ref>Rowlinson (1994), 121.</ref> In successive sentences and in parallel clauses, Ulysses says, "I am become a name…I am a part of all that I have met." He speaks in the fictional time of Homer’s Ulysses. His claim is also that of Tennyson’s text, existing in another temporal order, and therefore refers to his fame ''extending from'' the Homeric and other works about him. The poem becomes an argument for continuation of narrative in a textual tradition, and a "meditation on the ground of that continuity".<ref>Rowlinson (2004), 122.</ref>

=== The dramatic monologue ===
<!-- who is Ulysses speaking to?-->
Scholars disagree about how "Ulysses" functions as a [[dramatic monologue]]—to whom and at what location is Ulysses speaking? Some see the verse oscillating between a [[soliloquy]] and a public address: Ulysses seems to speak to himself in the first two movements, then to turn to an audience as he introduces his son, then to relocate to the seashore where he addresses his "mariners".<ref>Hughes, 201.</ref>

Standing in opposition to the archetype of Ulysses as adventurer is the sense of passivity that some find in "Ulysses" and other of Tennyson's poetry: "Ulysses" is not a narrative of action. To Ulysses, "all experience" is "somewhere out there",<ref>Tucker, 11.</ref> "an arch wherethrough / Gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades / Forever and forever when I move." Tennyson’s characters "move" through time and space to be moved inwardly.  The senses of desire and vague movement in "Ulysses" reinforce the [[etymological]] connection between "passion" and "passivity".<ref>Tucker.</ref>  

==Legacy and references in art==

=== Rise in the canon ===

The contemporary reviews of Tennyson's 1842 ''Poems'' were positive, but did not find "Ulysses" particularly notable. Reviewing the history of its publication in anthologies, Rowlinson finds that "Ulysses" was not usually among the poems Tennyson selected for his public readership. In teaching  anthologies, however, the poem was usually included. The ultimate prominence of "Ulysses" in Tennyson's canon, then, seems the result of events that considerably postdated its first publication: first, the rise of formal [[English poetry]] studies, and second, the 19th century effort to define  English culture as a system of values that could be exported abroad.<ref>Rowlinson (1992).</ref>  Though "Ulysses" cannot be read as imperialistic (the word did not appear in English until 1851), Tennyson's later poetry argued for the value of Britain's colonies. His epilogue "To the Queen" (1873) in ''[[Idylls of the King]]'' is in this vein.<ref>Rowlinson (1992), 268.</ref>

=== In poetry ===

In a 1929 essay, [[T. S. Eliot]] called "Ulysses" a "perfect poem",<ref>Eliot, T. S. (1950). ''Selected essays, 1917-1932.'' New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 210. ISBN 0151803870.</ref> while noting that Tennyson's achievement is the result of poetic "forcing". An analogue of Ulysses is found in Eliot's "[[Gerontion]]" (1920), according to Fulweiler in his review of sentimentality in modern literature.<ref>Fulweiler, 170.</ref> Both poems are narrated by an aged man contemplating life's end.  Eliot's comment on Ulysses is ironic—compare "Ulysses"' introductory lines—:

<poem>
     Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.
     The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,
     Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.

                 I am an old man,	 
     A dull head among windy places. (12–16)
</poem>

Italian poet [[Giovanni Pascoli]] (1855-1912) stated that his long lyric poem ''L'ultimo viaggio'' was an attempt to reconcile the portrayals of Ulysses in Dante and Tennyson with the prophecy that Ulysses would die "a mild death off the sea."<ref>Stanford, 205.</ref> Ulysses leaves Ithaca to retrace his epic voyage rather than begin another.  A contemporary of Pascoli, [[Arturo Graf]] (1848–1913), wrote "L'ultimo viaggio di Ulisse" with the more familiar echo of Dante's heroic character.

=== Other references ===

Many readers have accepted the acclaimed last lines of the poem as inspirational, although it is not clear that Tennyson intended them as such. Antarctic explorer [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and his party died on their return from the South Pole in 1912. A cross memorializing them is inscribed with "Ulysses"' last line, "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield." In the series finale of the television sitcom ''[[Frasier]]'', entitled "[[Goodnight, Seattle]]", psychiatrist [[Frasier Crane]] quotes the end of the poem in his farewell speech.
