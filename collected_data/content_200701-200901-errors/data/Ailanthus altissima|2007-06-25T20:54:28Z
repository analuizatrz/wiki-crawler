'''''Ailanthus altissima''''', commonly known as '''Tree of Heaven''', simply '''Ailanthus''', or in Chinese as '''Chouchun''' ({{zh-cp|c=臭椿|p=chòuchūn}}), is a [[deciduous]] tree in the [[Simaroubaceae|quassia family]]. It is native to north-eastern and central [[China]] as well as [[Taiwan]]. An unusual member of the genus, it is found in temperate climates rather than the tropics like all other ''Ailanthus'' species. The tree grows rapidly and is capable of reaching heights of 15 metres (50 feet) in 25 years.<ref name="USDF">{{cite web| last =Miller| first =James H.| authorlink =| coauthors =Yawney, Harry W. | title =Ailanthus altissima| work = Silvics of Forest Trees of the United States, Volume 2| publisher = United States Department of Forestry| date =1965, revised December 1990| url =http://na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_2/ailanthus/altissima.htm| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-05-29}}</ref> However, they are also short lived and rarely live more than 50 years. The common name as well as the genus are derived from an [[Ambonese]] word ''ailanto'', meaning "heaven-tree" or "tree reaching for the sky".<ref name=harvard/><ref name=harvard2/> Other common names include '''China Sumac''', '''Copal Tree''', '''Stink Tree''' and '''Ghetto Palm'''.

''A. altissima'' has been introduced to many areas beyond its native range, in many of which it has become a serious [[invasive species]] due to its ability to quickly colonise disturbed areas and suppress competition with [[allelopathy|allelopathic]] chemicals. It is considered a noxious weed in [[Australia]], the [[United States]], [[New Zealand]] and in several countries in southern and eastern [[Europe]]. The tree also re-sprouts vigourously when cut, making its eradication extremely difficult and time consuming. The plant first was brought to Europe in the 1740s and to the United States in 1784, where it was at first hailed as a beautiful garden specimen. As it was one of the first trees brought west from China and since the ''[[chinoiserie]]'' was dominating European arts at the time, its initial popularity is hardly surprising. However, shortly after its introduction opinions became much more mixed due to its suckering habits and its offensive odour, though it was used extensively as a street tree during much of the 19th century. <ref name="harvard">{{cite journal| last =Shah| first =Behula| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The Checkered Career of ''Ailanthus altissima'' | journal =Arnoldia

In China the tree of heaven has a rich and long history. It was mentioned in the oldest extant Chinese dictionary and listed in countless Chinese medical texts for it purported ability to cure various ailments from mental illness to balding. The roots, leaves and bark are still utilised today in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], primarily for use as an [[astringent]]. The tree has been grown extensively both in China and abroad as a host plant for the [[ailanthus silkmoth]], a moth involved in [[silk]] production. Ailanthus has become a part of western culture as well, with the tree serving as the central metaphor and subject matter of the best-selling American novel ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' .

==Description==
[[Image:Ailanthus altissima drawing.png|thumb|left|200px|Botanical drawing of the leaves, flowers and samaras by Steven Hurst]]
''A. altissima'' is a medium-size tree that reaches heights between 17 and 27 metres (56 and 90 feet) with a  diameter at breast height of about 1 metre (40 inches).<ref name=USDF/> The [[bark]] is smooth and light grey, often becoming somewhat rougher with light tan fissures as the tree ages. The twigs are stout, smooth to lightly pubescent and reddish or chestnut in colour. They have [[lenticel]]s as well as heart shaped leaf scars with many bundle scars around the margin. The [[bud]]s are finely pubescent, dome shaped, and partially hidden behind the petiole, though they are completely visible in the dormant season at the sinuses of the leaf scars.<ref name=harvard2/> The branches are light to dark gray in colour, smooth, lustrous and containing raised lenticels that become fissures with age. They are pendulous at the distal ends.  All parts of the plant have a strong odour that is often likened to rotting peanuts or cashews, which distinguishes the species from similar plants.<ref name=invasive>{{cite web

The [[leaf|leaves]] are large, odd or even [[pinnate]]ly compound, and arranged alternately on the stem. They range in size from 30 to 90 cm (1 to 3 feet) in length, with the largest leaves being present on vigorous young sprouts, and contain 10-41 leaflets. The [[rachis]] is light to reddish green with swollen bases. The [[leaflet]]s are [[leaf shape|ovate-lanceolate]] with entire margins, somewhat asymmetric and ocassionally not directly opposite on another. Each leaflet is 5 to 18 cm (2 to 7 inches) long and 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) wide. They have a long tapering apex, while the bases have 2 to 4 gladular teeth, each containing one or more glands at the tip.<ref name="harvard2">{{cite journal| last =Hu| first =Shiu-ying| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = ''Ailanthus altissima'' | journal =Arnoldia

The [[petiole]]s are 5 to 12 mm (0.2 to 0.5 inches) long.<ref name=invasive/> The lobed bases and glands distinguish it from similar [[rhus|sumac]] species.

[[Image:Ailanthus-altissima.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A female bearing a heavy load of seeds in [[Valladolid]], [[Spain]]]]
The [[flower]]s are small and appear in large [[panicle]]s up to 50 cm (20 inches) in length at the end of new shoots. The individual flowers are yellowish green to reddish in colour, each with 5 [[petal]]s and 5 [[sepal]]s.<ref name=USDF/><ref name=invasive/> They appear from mid-April in the south of its range to July in the north. ''A. altissima'' is [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], with male and female flowers being borne on different individuals. Male trees produce three to four times as many flowers as the females, making the male flowers more conspicuous. Furthermore, the males emit a foul smelling odour while flowering to attract pollinating insects. Female flowers contain 10 (or rarely 5 through abortion) sterile [[stamen]]s, or stamenoides, as well as 5 carpels with a slender styles and star-shaped stigmas.<ref name=harvard2/> The [[seed]]s borne on the female trees are 5 mm in diameter and each is encapsulated in a [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] that is 2.5 cm long (1 inch) and 1 cm broad, appearing July though August, but usually persisting on the tree until the next spring. The samara is twisted at the tips making it spin as it falls and assisting wind dispersal.<ref name=USDF/><ref name=invasive/> The females can produce huge amounts of seeds, normally around 30,000 per kilogram of tree.<ref name=USDF/>

==Taxonomy==
[[Image:Ailanthus altissima5.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bark of a middle-aged specimen of var. ''altissima'' in [[Germany]]]]
The first scientific descriptions of the tree-of-heaven were made shortly after it was introduced to [[Europe]] by the French [[Jesuit]] Pierre Nicholas d'Incarville. He sent seeds from [[Peking]] to his friend, the botanist and superintendent of the [[Jardin des Plantes|Jardin Royal des Plantes]] [[Bernard de Jussieu]], in [[Paris]] in the 1740s via [[Siberia]]. d'Incarville was not a professional botanist, but was nonetheless well educated in the field and was a member of the Academy of Sciences in Paris. The seeds sent by d'Incarville were thought to be of the economically important and similar looking [[Chinese varnish tree]] (''Toxicodendron vernicifluum''), which he has observed in the southerly lower [[Yangtze]] region, rather than ailanthus. He attached a note indicating this, which caused much taxonomic confusion over the next few decades. Ailanthus aside, he went on to send many other specimens to Paris as well, such as the now popular [[pagoda tree]] (''Styphnolobium japonica''). In [[1751]], Jussieu planted a few seeds in [[France]] and sent others on to [[Philip Miller]], the superintendent at the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]], and to Philip C. Webb, the owner of an exotic plant garden in [[Busbridge]], [[England]].<ref name=harvard2/> 

Confusion began when the tree was described with three different names in each respective location where it was being grown. In Paris, [[Linnaeus]] gave the plant the name ''Rhus succedanea'', while it was known commonly by the name ''grand vernis du Japon''. In London the specimens were named by Miller as ''Toxicodendron altissima'' and in Busbridge it was dubbed in the old classification system as ''Rhus Sinese foliis alatis''. There are extant records from the 1750s of disputes over the proper name between Philip Miller and [[John Ellis]], curator of Webb's garden in Busbridge. Rather than being resolved, more names soon appeared for the plant. [[Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart]] observed a specimen in [[Utrecht]] in 1782 and named it ''Rhus cacodendron''.<ref name=harvard2/>

Light was shed on the taxonomic status of ailanthus in 1788 when [[René Louiche Desfontaines]] observed the samaras of the Paris specimens, there still under the name ''Rhus succedanea'', and came to the conclusion that the plant was not a [[sumac]]. He published an article with an illustrated description and gave it the name ''Ailanthus glandulosa'', placing it in the same genus with the tropical and then known ''Ailanthus integrifolia'' from eastern India and the south Pacific. This specific name persisted until as late as 1957, but it was ultimately made invalid as a later homonym at the species level. The current species name comes from [[Walter T. Swingle]] who was employed by the United States Department of Plant Industry. He decided to transfer Miller's older specific name into the genus of Desfontaines, resulting in the accepted name ''Ailanthus altissima''.<ref name=harvard2/>
 
===Varieties===
There are three [[variety (biology)|varieties]] of ''A. altissima'':
*''A. altissima'' var. ''altissima'', which is the type variety and is native in [[mainland China]].
*''A. altissima'' var. ''tanakai'', which is endemic in northern [[Taiwan]] at medium to high altitudes. It differs from the type in having yellowish bark, odd-pinnate leaves that are also shorter on average at 45 to 60 cm long with only 13-25 scyth-like leaflets.<ref name=chinaflora>

===As an exotic plant===
The earliest introductions of ''A. altissima'' to countries outside of its native range were to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. It is possible that the tree is native to these areas, but it is generally agreed that the tree was a very early introduction.<ref>{{cite book| last =Little Jr.| first =Elbert L.| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Checklist of United States Trees (Native and Naturalized)| publisher =U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service| date =1979| location =Washington, DC| pages =375 in Agricultural Handbook 541| url =| doi =| id =  }}</ref> Within China itself it has also been naturalised beyond its native range in areas such as [[Qinghai]], [[Ningxia]] and [[Xinjiang]].<ref name=chinainvade/>  

The tree was first introduced to [[Europe]] in the form of seeds sent by Pierre Nicholas d'Incarville from [[Peking]] to [[Paris]] in the 1740s. A selection of the same seeds were forwarded in [[1751]] to botanists in [[England]], specifically Philip Miller and Philip C. Webb. Not long after in [[1784]], seeds were also sent to the [[United States]] by [[William Hamilton]], a gardener in [[Philadelphia]]. It both Europe and America it quickly became a favoured ornamental, especially as a street tree, and by [[1840]] it was available in most nurseries.<ref name=harvard2/> The tree was also brought to [[California]] in the 1890s by Chinese immigrants who came during the [[California Gold Rush]]. It escaped cultivation in all areas where it was introduced, but most severely in the United States.<ref name=naturec/> In [[Germany]] it is still often planted, though it has become a common weed in cities, especially along railway lines and streets.<ref name=schmeil/> Ailanthus has also been introduced to [[Argentina]]<ref name=naturec/>, [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and several countries in the Middle East such as [[Pakistan]].<ref name="pakistan">{{cite journal| last =Shafiq| first =Muhammad| authorlink =| coauthors =Nizami, M.

==Ecology==
Ailanthus is an opportunistic species, thriving in full sun and in disturbed areas. It spreads aggressively both by seeds and vegetatively, through root sprouts. It can re-sprout rapidly after being cut.<ref name=USDF/> It does show limited levels of shade tolerance, though it cannot grow in closed canopy forests.<ref name=USDF/><ref name=naturec/> Ailanthus is among the most tolerant of all tree species to pollution, including [[sulfur dioxide]], which it absorbs in its leaves. It can withstand cement dust and fumes from coal tar operations, as well as resist [[ozone]] exposure relatively well. Furthermore, high concentrations of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] have been found built up in tissues of the plant.<ref name=naturec/>

Ailanthus has been used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine drainage has occurred and it has been show to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1. It can withstand very low [[phosphorus]] levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system.<ref name=naturec/> It is frequently found along highways and railroad tracks, in abandoned lots in cities, on abandoned mining sites, and in other areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes.<ref name=harvard2/> Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.<ref name=naturec/>
[[Image:Ailanthus altissima (female).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A weedy female tree growing in [[Chicago, Illinois]] ]]

===Control===
{{Wmog|Ailanthus altissima}}
Tree-of-heaven has become a problematic [[invasive species]] in many areas with warm temperate climates, especially in North America, due to its aggressive spread, vigorous growth and allelopathic chemicals. It often grows directly up against a building or structure, where the roots can damage sewers and housing foundations. The trees grow rapidly and produce many offspring in their root vicinity. They also shed many small branches at regular intervals. It is an agricultural pest as well.<ref name=control/> These undesirable qualities often lead land and business owners to eradicate the plant.  

Many different methods of control have been attempted and the best involve prevention as well as eradication. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological, or chemical. A combination of these can be most effective, though they must be compatible. Physical methods are desirable due to their high selectivity, but are very labour intensive and thus more expensive. Hand-pulling is an highly effective way to remove young seedlings before the development of a [[tap root]], but thereafter it is ineffective. Cutting and hand digging are options for larger trees, but the former will produce stump sprout which will need to be controlled later and the latter is very time consuming and is only practical for small infestations. [[Girdling]], the removal of the [[cambium|cambial]] tissue with a hand axe or machete, is effective for very large trees, though re-sprouting often occurs. Thermal control, ie controlled burning, is also effective at removing the visible portion of trees, but sprouts will occur shortly after.<ref name=naturec/> These methods can be counter-productive if not performed regularly. On their own they are most effective in places with small infestations or in areas with fairly strong shade or competition.<ref name=control>{{cite web| last =Swearingen| first =Jil M. | authorlink =| coauthors =Pannill, Phillip| title =Tree-of-heaven| work =Plant Conservation Alliance's Alien Plant Working Group| publisher =National Park Service| date =2006| url =http://www.nps.gov/plants/alien/fact/aial1.htm| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-05}}</ref> The root systems will eventually become exhausted and die if mechanical or thermal control is done thoroughly and consistently, though this may take several years.<ref name=naturec/>

Managerial control is not effective with controlling ailanthus as native trees cannot compete easily with the tree and it is unpalatable to animals that could potentially graze on it. Biological control, the use of insects or diseases, is also not in use for ailanthus eradication. Chemical control, however, is quite successful, especially when combined with mechanical methods.<ref name=naturec/> Foliar [[herbicide]] sprays are very effective when plants are in full leaf, but are difficult to use when desirable plants are in the vicinity. Also very large trees will be out of reach. Herbicides for this use include the non-selective [[glyphosate]], though care must be taken as it is mildly toxic to animals and especially to [[aquatic animal|aquatic life]]. Its trade names include ''Accord'' and ''[[Roundup]]'', though the latter contains other harmful [[surfactant]]s which may be more toxic than the herbicide itself. [[Triclopyr]] is another option and is selective for woody plants, making it a better choice for sensitive areas. It is also non-toxic to fish, though it can be toxic to [[waterfowl]]. It is sold under brand names such as ''Garlon''. Foliar applications of glyphosphate have been shown to be slightly more effective than triclopyr. [[Dicamba]], imazapyr and metsulfuron methyl are also effective, but have not been tested extensively with ailanthus.<ref name=control/>

Other chemical methods for controlling ailanthus include a basal [[bark]] application of oil-soluble triclopyr in late winter or early spring. This method requires no cutting, but is only effective on trees with a diameter of 15 cm (6 inches) or less. For larger trees, an effective method is to cut off strips of bark at the trunk during the summer and spray a 100% concentration of triclopyr, only about 1 or 2 ml per cut, within a few minutes. The tree should not be cut all the way around in a ring, but rather only a ring with 3 to 6 cm (1 to 2 inch) pieces of living bark in between each cut. Cutting a full ring will kill the upper part of the tree and cause root [[basal shoot|suckers]] to sprout. Lastly, trees can be cut down and the [[stump]] treated with any of the above herbicides, though they must be applied immediately after cutting. This is most effective during the growing season.<ref name=control/>

==Uses==
[[Image:Samia cynthia adult male sjh.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A male ailanthus silkmoth from the [[Texas A&M]] insect collection]]
The leaves are also used to feed [[silkworm]]s of the moth ''[[Samia cynthia]]'', which produces [[silk]] that is stronger and cheaper than [[mulberry]] silk, although with inferior gloss and texture. It is also unable to take dye. This type of silk is known as "[[pongee]]" or "Shantung silk", the second name being derived from the [[Shandong Province]] of China where this silk is often produced. It's production is particularly well known in the [[Yantai]] region of that province. The moth has also been introduced into the [[U.S.]].<ref name=harvard2/>

The pale yellow, close-grained, satiny wood has been used in cabinet work.<ref name=Keeler /> The flexible wood is well suited to the manufacture of kitchen [[steaming|steamers]], which are important in [[Chinese cuisine]] for cooking [[mantou]], pasteries and rice. The [[Chekiang Province]] in eastern China is particularly famous for producing these.<ref name=harvard2/> There are problems with using the wood: because the trees exhibit extremely rapid growth for the first few years, the trunk has uneven texture between the inner wood and outer wood, which can cause the wood to twist and/or crack when it is dried after it is cut. Techniques have been developed for drying the wood so as to prevent this cracking, allowing the wood to be commercially harvested. Although the live tree tends to have very flexible wood, the wood is quite hard once properly dried.

===Cultivation===
Tree of heaven is a popular [[ornamental tree]] in China, often valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions.<ref name=chinainvade/> It was once very popular in cultivation in both Europe and North America, but it has faded, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odor of its blossoms and the weediness of its habit. The problem of odour was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only the males produce the smell, but a higher seedset also results.<ref name=harvard/> In Europe the tree is still used in the garden to some degree as its habit is generally not as invasive as it is in America. In the [[UK]] it is especially common in [[London]] squares, streets, and parks, though it is also frequently found in gardens in southern England and [[East Anglia]]. It becomes rare to the north, occuring only seldomly in southern [[Scotland]]. It is also rare in [[Ireland]].<ref name="Mitchell">{{cite book| last =Mitchell| first =Alan| authorlink =Alan Mitchell| coauthors =| title =Trees of Britain & Northern Europe| publisher =Harper Collins Publishers| date =1974| location =London| pages = 310-311| id =ISBN 0-00-219213-6  }}</ref> In [[Germany]] the tree is commonly planted in gardens.<ref name=schmeil>{{cite book| last =Schmeil| first =Otto| authorlink =| coauthors =Fitschen, Jost; Seybold, Siegmund| title =Flora von Deutschland, 93.

===Medicinal===
Nearly every part of ''A. altissima'' has some application in [[Chinese traditional medicine]]. One of the oldest recipes, recorded in a work from 732 AD, is used for treating mental illness. It uses a handful of root material chopped into small pieces and steeped in 2 litres of young boys' [[urine]] along with 100 cl of [[douchi]]. After sitting for a day the liquid was strained out and the recipe yielded 3 to 5 portions with one being given to the patient each day.<ref name=harvard2/>

Another source from 684 AD during the [[Tang dynasty]] and recorded in [[Li Shizhen]]'s [[Compendium of Materia Medica]] states that when the leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can be effectively used to treat boils, [[abscess]]es and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, [[catalpa]] and [[peach]] to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.<ref name=harvard2/>

The dried [[bark]], however, is still an officinal drug and is listed in the modern Chinese [[materia medica]] as ''chun bai pi'' ({{zh-cp|c=椿白皮|p=chūnbáipí}}), meaning "white bark of spring". The modern work treats it in detail, discussing chemical constituents, how to identify the product and its pharmaceutical uses. It is prepared by felling the tree in fall or spring, stripping the bark and then scraping off the hardest, outermost portion. It is then sun-dried, soaked in water, partially re-dried in a basket and then cut into strips. It is said to have cooling and [[astringent]] properties and is primarily used to treat [[dysentery]], intestinal [[hemorrhage]], [[menorrhagia]] and [[spermatorrhea]]. It is only prescribed in amounts between 4 and 10 grams, so as not to poison the patients. Li's Compendium has 18 recipes that call for the bark. Asian and European chemists have found some justification for its medical use as it contains a long list of chemicals such as [[quassin]] and [[saponin]]. It is available in most shops dealing in [[Chinese traditional medicine]].<ref name=harvard2/> A tincture of the root-bark has been used successfully in cardiac palpitation, [[asthma]] and [[epilepsy]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}} 

The [[samara]]s are also used in modern Chinese medicine under the name ''feng yan cao'' ({{zh-stp|s=凤眼草|t=鳳眼草|p=fèngyǎncǎo}}), meaning "herbal [[phoenix]] eye". They are used as a [[hemostatic]], [[spermatorrhea]] and for treating patients with blood in their feces or urine. It was clinically shown to be able to treat [[trichomoniasis]], a vaginal infection caused by the [[protozoan]] ''Trichomonas vaginalis''.<ref name=harvard2/>

Under the [[Synonymy|synonym]] ''A. glandulosa'' an extract of the bark is sometimes touted as an herbal homeopathic remedy for various ailments. However, taken in large doses, the bark extract is highly toxic.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==Culture==
Within the oldest extant Chinese dictionary, the [[Erya]], written in the 3rd century BC, the tree of heaven is mentioned second among a list of trees. It was mentioned again in a [[materia medica]] compiled during the [[Tang dynasty]] in 656 AD. Each work favoured a different character, however, and there is still some debate in the Chinese botanical community as to which character should be used. The current name, chouchun ({{zh-cp|c=臭椿|p=chòuchūn}}), means "stinking spring", and is a relatively new appellation. People living near the lower [[Yellow River]] know it by the name chunshu ({{zh-stp|s=椿树|t=椿樹|p=chūnshù}}), meaning "spring tree". The name stems from the fact that ''A. altissima'' is one of the last trees to come out of dormancy and as such it's leaves coming out would signify to the people that the winter was truly over.<ref name=harvard2/>

In [[Chinese literature]], ailanthus is often used for two rather extreme metaphors, with a mature tree representing a father and a stump being a spoiled child. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a friend's father and mother in a letter, where one can write "wishing your ailanthus and [[daylily]] are strong and happy", with ailanthus metaphorically refering to the father and daylily to the mother. Furthermore, one can scold a child by calling him a "good-for-nothing ailanthus stump sprout", meaning the child is irresponsible. This derives from the literature of [[Zhuangzi]], a [[Taoist]] philosopher, who refered to a tree that had developed from a sprout at the stump and was thus unsuitable for carpentry due to its irregular shape. Later scholars associated this tree with ailanthus and applied the metaphor to children who, like stump sprouts of the tree, will not develop into a worthwhile human being if they don't follow rules or traditions.<ref name=harvard2/>  
[[Image:Tree grows cover smith.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The cover of Betty Smith's ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'' with a drawing of ailanthus in the background]]
The 1943 book ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' by [[Betty Smith]] uses the tree of heaven as its central metaphor, using it as an analogy for the ability to thrive in a difficult environment. At the time as well as now, ailanthus was common in neglected urban areas.<ref name=harvard/><ref name=penn/> She writes:{{cquote|There's a tree that grows in Brooklyn. Some people call it the Tree of Heaven. No matter where its seed falls, it makes a tree which struggles to reach the sky. It grows in boarded up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps. It grows up out of cellar gratings. It is the only tree that grows out of cement. It grows lushly...survives without sun, water, and seemingly earth. It would be considered beautiful except that there are too many of it.|30px|30px|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn|}} 

Ailanthus is also sometimes counter-[[nickname]]d "tree from hell" due its prolific [[Invasive plants|invasiveness]] and the difficulty in eradicating it.<ref name=penn>{{Citation| last =Wall| first =John| author-link =| last2 =| first2 =| author2-link =| title =PENN STATE SCIENTISTS: TREE OF HEAVEN REALLY ISN'T| newspaper =Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences News Release| pages =| year =1999| date =June 14| url =http://www.aginfo.psu.edu/news/june99/heaventree.html}}</ref> In cities, it often bears the name "ghetto palm", because of its propensity for growing in the infertile soils of urban areas or on abandoned and poorly maintained properties. Ingo Vetter, a German artist and professor of fine arts at [[Umea University]] in [[Sweden]], was influenced by the idea of the "ghetto palm" and installed a living ailanthus tree taken from [[Detroit]] for an international art show called ''[[Shrinking Cities]]'' at the KW Institute of Contemporary Art in [[Berlin]] in 2004. He also lectured on [[urban agriculture]] at the same show when it moved to Detroit in February of 2007.<ref>{{Citation| last =Collins| first =Lisa M.| author-link =| last2 =| first2 =| author2-link =| title =Ghetto Palm| newspaper =Metro Times Detroit| pages =| year =2003| date =December 10| url =http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=5723 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation| last =Wasacz| first =Walter| author-link =| last2 =| first2 =| author2-link =| title =Big Ideas for Shrinking Cities| newspaper =Model D| pages =| year =2007| date =January 30| url =http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/shrinking79.aspx}}</ref>
