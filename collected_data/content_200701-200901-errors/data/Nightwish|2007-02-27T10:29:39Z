'''Nightwish''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[symphonic metal]] band formed in 1996 in the town of [[Kitee]]. Nightwish composes songs that are often classified as either symphonic metal or [[power metal]], and sometimes as variants of the genre called opera metal and [[epic metal]]. Nightwish is considered one of the main developers of the symphonic metal genre, which encompasses similar bands such as [[Epica (band)|Epica]], [[After Forever]] and [[Visions of Atlantis]].

Although the band has been prominent in their home country since the release of their first [[Single (music)|single]] ("[[The Carpenter]]"), they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the [[Oceanborn]] and [[Wishmaster (album)|Wishmaster]] albums in 1998 and 2000 respectively. The 2004 album [[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]] led to Nightwish video clips being shown on [[MTV]] in the [[United States]] and inclusion of their music on U.S. movie soundtracks.
Their biggest U.S. hit, "[[Wish I Had an Angel]]", made it onto two U.S. film soundtracks, as a way to promote their North American tour.  They later produced three singles and music videos for the album, and "[[Sleeping Sun]]", from the 2005 "[[Greatest hits|best of]]" compilation, ''[[Highest Hopes]]'', prior to vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]]'s departure.

The extensive search for Turunen's replacement, during the course of which anyone could be considered by submitting a [[demo (music)|demo]], ended in early 2007. Recently, the band declared that the new vocalist will be announced at the end of May 2007, together with the release of a new single.<ref>[http://www.nightwish.com/en/news "The auditions for the new vocalist have ended"]</ref>

==Band history==
===''Angels Fall First'' (1996–1997)===
[[Image:Nightwish2.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Nightwish's ''[[Angels Fall First]]'' line-up. From left to right: [[Emppu Vuorinen]], [[Jukka Nevalainen]], [[Tuomas Holopainen]] and [[Tarja Turunen]]]]
Nightwish was the brainchild of Tuomas Holopainen, conceived after spending a night around a campfire with friends. The band formed shortly after, in July 1996. Holopainen invited guitarist [[Emppu Vuorinen|Erno "Emppu" Vuorinen]], who was a fairly new acquaintance, and vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]] to the project, as she was gaining renown around the school they attended for her excellent vocal skills.

Their style at the time was based on the experimentations of Holopainen with using [[Synthesizer|keyboards]], [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]]s and the operatic vocals of Tarja Turunen. The three musicians then recorded an [[Acoustic instrument|acoustic]] demo album from October to December of 1996. There were three songs on this demo: "Nightwish" (of which the band derived its name), "The Forever Moments" and "Etiäinen". However, Holopainen decided that Turunen's voice was too powerful for an acoustic  project and decided to add in metal elements.

In early 1997, [[Drum|drummer]] [[Jukka Nevalainen]] joined the band. At the same time the acoustic guitar was replaced by an [[electric guitar]]. In April the band went into the studio in order to record seven songs, including an improved version of the demo-song "Etiäinen". These songs can be found on the limited edition of the album ''[[Angels Fall First]]''.

In May of the same year, they signed with the Finnish record label [[Spinefarm Records]] for two albums. ''Angels Fall First'' was released in November and reached number 31 on the Finnish album charts. A previously released single, "[[The Carpenter]]", reached number 3 on the Finnish singles chart.

The critical reception of ''Angels Fall First'' has been mixed. [[All Music Guide]] rated the album 2 out of 5<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | title=allmusic | work=Angels Fall First | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:lza9qj1qojfa | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and sources like ''The Metal Observer'' stated that Nightwish's debut album paled drastically in comparison to their later work.<ref name="metalobsv">{{cite web | title=The Metal Observer | work=Review – Nightwish – Angels Fall First | url=http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&sid=1&id=2621 | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>. However, on the [[Encyclopaedia Metallum]], which features the user reviews, the album scored the average rating of 91%.<ref name="TMA">{{cite web | title=Encyclopaedia Metallum | work=Entry: Nightwish – Angels Fall First | url=http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=133 | accessmonthday=February 23 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

December 1997 marked their first concert, which was played in their hometown. During the winter of 1997–98, the band performed only seven more times because Nevalainen and Vuorinen were fulfilling their obligatory military service and Turunen had not yet finished her studies.

===''Oceanborn / Wishmaster'' (1998–2000)===
[[Image:Nightwish-deepsilentcomplete.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cover for the ''[[Deep Silent Complete]]'' single, released in 2000]]

In 1998, [[Bass guitar|bassist]] Sami Vänskä, an old friend of Holopainen, joined the band. After shooting a video clip for the song "The Carpenter", they released ''[[Oceanborn]]'', the follow-up to ''Angels Fall First''. This album was more technical and progressive than their first release in terms of songwriting and arrangements.<ref name="jamesbyrd">{{cite web | title=James Byrd Tribute | work=Nightwish – Oceanborn | url=http://www.geocities.com/byrdtribute/nightwishocean.html | accessmonthday=December 27 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> The album also featured [[Tapio Wilska]] (ex-[[Finntroll]]) on two songs ("Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean" and "The Pharaoh Sails to Orion"). It reached number 5 on the Finnish album charts. The first single from that album ''[[Sacrament of Wilderness]]'', went straight to number 1 on the Finnish single charts. ([[Media:Nightwish-sacramentofwilderness.ogg|sample]]).

The second single to come out was "[[Walking in the Air (Nightwish)|Walking in the Air]]", a cover of [[Howard Blake]]'s piece, part of ''[[The Snowman]]'' [[soundtrack]].

In 1999, they recorded the single "[[Sleeping Sun (Four Ballads of the Eclipse)]]", for the [[solar eclipse]] in [[Germany]]. This single sold 15,000 copies during the first month in Germany. ''Oceanborn'' was a certified [[Gold album|gold]] in August.<ref name="rockdetector">{{cite web | title=Rockdetector | work=Nightwish Official Biography | url=http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,6372.sm | accessmonthday=December 28 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

In 2000, Nightwish participated in the Finnish qualification for the [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision song contest]] with the song "[[Sleepwalker (song)|Sleepwalker]]". They finished the contest in second place. They won the public televoting, but the jury overruled ([[Media:Nightwish-sleepwalker.ogg|sample]]). In May they released the album ''[[Wishmaster (album)|Wishmaster]]'' which went straight to number 1 on the Finnish album charts, and remained there for three weeks. During those three weeks it was certified gold. ''Wishmaster'' was, despite long-awaited releases from [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Bon Jovi]], which happened simultaneously, declared album of the month by the German magazine ''[[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]]''.

===''Over the Hills and Far Away / Century Child'' (2001–2003)===
[[Image:Overhillsfarawayvideo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The band in the video clip for "[[Over the Hills and Far Away (album)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]"]]

In 2001 Nightwish recorded a cover of [[Gary Moore]]'s "Over the Hills and Far Away" together with a few new songs and a remake of an old one. This was released as the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Over the Hills and Far Away (album)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]''. The record counted with guest performances by [[Tony Kakko]] (from the [[power metal]] band [[Sonata Arctica]]) and [[Tapio Wilska]]. They also released a [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Compact disc|CD]] with live material recorded in a show in [[Tampere]], on [[December 29]] 2000. All of these were entitled ''[[From Wishes to Eternity]]''. Shortly afterwards, Sami Vänskä was asked to leave the band by Tuomas, and [[Marco Hietala]] ([[Tarot (band)|Tarot]], ex-[[Sinergy]]) joined the band, effectively leaving Sinergy. The bassist would, apart from playing his instrument, also perform male vocals.

In 2002 Nightwish released ''[[Century Child]]'', and the singles "[[Ever Dream]]" and "[[Bless the Child (song)|Bless the Child]]". The main difference from previous albums is the use of a live [[orchestra]] from Finland on "Bless the Child", "Ever Dream", "Feel For You" and "The Beauty of the Beast", to get a more present feeling of [[European classical music|classical music]].  An enduring favorite of fans, though, is the band's version of "Phantom of the Opera", from the famous musical of the same name by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.  ''Century Child'' was certified gold two hours after its release, and platinum two weeks afterwards. It set a record on the Finnish album charts as well; never before had the second been so distant from the first place. After the "[[Bless the Child (song)|Bless the Child]]" video, a second one was recorded, without any single support. The chosen track was "[[End of All Hope]]". The clip contains pieces from the Finnish movie, ''[[Kohtalon kirja]]'' (English: ''The Book of Fate'').<ref name="kohtalon">{{cite web | title=Kohtalon Kirja | work=Kohtalon Kirja DVD | url=http://www.kohtalonkirja.com/dvd | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

In 2003, Nightwish released a second DVD, entitled ''[[End of Innocence]]'' that tells the story of the band in Holopainen and Nevalainen's words for two hours. The documentary also features bits of live concerts, exclusive footage, etc. Tarja also got married during the summer of 2003, and there were rumours that the band was about to be dissolved. These rumours were, at the time, proven to be false, as the band continued on to play concerts for another year and released another album.

===''Once'' (2004–2005)===
[[Image:Tuska_wed_nw.jpg|right|thumb|190px|A poster advertising Nightwish's concert]]
A new album entitled ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'' was released on [[June 7]], [[2004]], along with their first single, "[[Nemo (song)|Nemo]]" (Latin for "nobody"), from that album. The single topped the charts in Finland and [[Hungary]], and reached the top ten in five additional countries. "Nemo" therefore remains their most successful single release to date.

''Once'' utilizes a full orchestra in nine of the eleven songs on the album. Unlike ''Century Child'', Nightwish decided to look for an orchestra outside of Finland this time, choosing the [[London Session Orchestra]]. It is also their second album to feature a full-length song in Finnish, "[[Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan|Kuolema tekee taiteilijan]]" (English: "Death Creates an Artist"). ''Once'' has sold triple platinum in Finland, platinum in [[Germany]], gold in [[Sweden]] and reached #1 in the [[Greece|Greek]], [[Norway|Norwegian]] and Hungarian album charts. The following singles were: "[[Wish I Had an Angel]]" (featured on the soundtrack of the ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'' film), "[[Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan]]" (released only in Finland and [[Japan]]) and "[[The Siren (song)|The Siren]]". Besides the commercial success, ''Once'' was also accepted by critics, with many positive reviewers (such as ''Metalfan.nl''<ref name="metalfan">{{cite web | title=Metalfan.nl | work=Nightwish – Once | url=http://www.metalfan.nl/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=1168 | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and ''RockReport.be'')<ref name="rockreport">{{cite web | title=RockReport.be | work=Nightwish – Once | url=http://www.rockreport.be/review.asp?id=711 | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> drawing comparisons with ''Oceanborn''.

The success of the album allowed them to perform the ''Once World Tour'', which enabled them to play in many countries the band had never visited before. Nightwish performed at the opening ceremony of the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]], held in [[Helsinki]],<ref name="helsingin">{{cite web | title=Helsingin Sanomat | work=Helsinki skies open as World Championships get under way | url=http://www.helsinginsanomat.fi/english/article/Helsinki+skies+open+as+World+Championships+get+under+way%0D%0A/1101980518329 | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> highlighting acclaim the band has recently gained.

A "best of" album was released in September 2005, containing songs from their whole discography. 
The compilation is entitled ''[[Highest Hopes]]'', also featuring a live cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s song "[[High Hopes (1994 song)|High Hopes]]" (from the ''[[The Division Bell]]'' album).

This song was the first in which Hietala performs the vocals by himself ([[Media:Nightwish-highhopes.ogg|sample]]). Besides ''High Hopes'', a remake of "[[Sleeping Sun]]" (from ''Oceanborn'') was put on the album, which was also released as a single. A new video for "Sleeping Sun" was shot, featuring a [[medieval]] battle, and can be found on the German release of the single and as a separate DVD released by Spinefarm.

===''End of an Era'' (2005–2006)===
[[Image:Nw_helsinki_0048.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Playing ''[[Creek Mary's Blood]]'' with [[John Two-Hawks]] at the [[Hartwall Areena]]]]
After the recording in the [[Hartwall Areena]] (Helsinki) on the 21st of October, 2005, of the new live DVD ''[[End of an Era]]'' (released June 2006), the four other members of Nightwish decided that it was best to continue Nightwish without Tarja Turunen,<ref name="wikisource">{{cite web | publisher=Wikisource | title=Open letter from Tuomas Holopainen | url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Open_Letter_To_Tarja_Turunen | accessmonthday=October 23 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> a feeling they expressed through an [[open letter]]. This was due to the fact that they felt that her husband [[Marcelo Cabuli]] and [[Commercialism|commercial]] interests had changed her attitude towards the band. Tuomas Holopainen gave the letter to Turunen after the band ended the concert. The letter was later published on the band's website for all to see.

Meanwhile, many sources on the Internet have already begun to speculate who Turunen's successor will be. On [[December 6]], "Lady Angellyca" of the [[Spain|Spanish]] band [[Forever Slave]] issued a statement where she said that she was one of the strong candidates to fill the vacant role,<ref name="blabbermouth">{{cite web | title=Blabbermouth | work=Frontwoman confirms she is a candidate for Nightwish singer position | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=46193 | accessmonthday=December 31 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> but the band itself has put up a message at their website which claims that the media who spread rumours about a new singer should not be believed.

Turunen has responded to the incident, saying that her dismissal came entirely as a shock to her. She felt that the personal attacks on her husband were unwarranted, and playing the issue out to the public was "senselessly cruel". Turunen was not consulted or spoken to before this letter was given to her. She wrote a letter saying most of this to her fans and published it on her own website.<ref name="tarjaturunena">{{cite web | publisher=METALYOU.COM | title=Tarja Turunen Letter to the band, fans and media | url=http://www.metalyou.com/band/nightwish/news/nightwish_tarja_turunen_letter_to_the_band_fans_and_media/ | accessmonthday=August 16 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> She was also interviewed by various TV stations, magazines and newspapers, stating her feelings towards the subject.

On [[September 15]], the band posted a notice on their official website stating that the recording process for the new album had begun. The process is set to last around six months and the new album should be ready in the spring of 2007.

On [[September 27]], [[2006]], the band updated their official web site to say that media sources in Finland have been spreading more rumours about the new lead singer. The notice also said that nothing should be believed unless posted on their official site.

On [[December 13]], [[2006]], the band updated their website again, saying that candidates for the singer position should send their demos in before [[January 15]], [[2007]].

On [[January 16]], [[2007]], the band made one more update to their website to announce that the auditions for the new vocalist had ended. The new vocalist will be announced at the end of May 2007.

===Recording the successor to ''Once'' (2006—)===
[[Image:Nightwish-2006.jpg|thumb|200px|Vuorinen and Hietala practicing newly-written material]]
On [[March 17]], [[2006]], the band added an advertisement on their website for all vocalists who are interested in auditioning as the new lead vocalist for Nightwish. To the surprise of some fans, they are not looking specifically for a classically trained singer, but are open to a variety of styles and backgrounds ("…all kinds of styles and voices, natural and trained, from rock and pop to classical, and all that you can find in between"). They go on to say that any potential candidate should be "…prepared to sing with a lot of dynamics and versatility. From loud and high to very sensitive stuff.", seemingly indicating that Nightwish will stay on track despite the departure of Turunen. On [[August 16]], [[2006]], the band explained through their website that the search was still on, having received approximately 1,100 demos since their request was uploaded to their website in March.

On [[July 20]], the band revealed in the official Nightwish videoblog that the demo of the sixth Nightwish album was ready to be mixed, and that the band would spread out until September. Then, some ultimate changes can be made prior to the actual recording of the new album.<ref name="newsongs">{{cite web | title=Nightwish – FanBLOG | work=Last report from Nightwish summer camp. | url=http://funchal.fmdm.net/nw/html/3a9c6449749dea6ecde16c536a550e89_Lastdemoreport.html | accessmonthday=August 15 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

According to their official website, the band entered the studio on [[September 15]], [[2006]] to record their sixth full-length studio album. The process began with drum recordings, with guitar, bass and demo keyboards, followed by orchestral/choir recordings to follow. After those, the final synths and vocals will be recorded. The entire process is set to last around six months and the album should be available in August 2007 with the first single being released in May 2007.<ref>[http://www.nightwish.com/en/news "The auditions for the new vocalist have ended"]</ref>

On [[February 19]], [[2007]], it was announced that a single called "Eva" will be released in May, and the new album in September. Also the dates for an upcoming North American tour were revealed.

==Influence==
Tuomas Holopainen, writer of most of the band's lyrics and [[Sheet music|musical score]]s, says that he gets most of the inspiration for Nightwish's songs from [[Film score|film music]]. Songs like "Beauty of the Beast" (from ''Century Child'') and "[[Ghost Love Score]]" (from ''Once'') are examples of this influence. Other songs, such as "Romanticide" and "Wish I Had an Angel" (both from ''Once'') have elements reminiscent of [[techno]] music.

On the other hand, Nightwish has also been noted as a source of inspiration for other bands. [[Simone Simons]], lead singer of [[Epica (band)|Epica]], stated that she began singing due to Nightwish.<ref name="epica">{{cite web | title=Epica Online | work=Profile Simone | url=http://www.epica.nl/index.php?id=45&section=band | accessmonthday=December 28 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Ex-singer of [[Visions of Atlantis]] [[Nicole Bogner]] also admitted that Nightwish had greatly inspired them for their first album.<ref name="musdiscvisions">{{cite web | title=Musical Discoveries | work=Visions of Atlantis (Nicole Bogner) | url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/voa.htm | accessmonthday=December 30 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> [[Sander Gommans]] of [[After Forever]] said that Nightwish "will certainly influence us in creating new songs".<ref name="musdiscafter">{{cite web | title=Musical Discoveries | work=After Forever | url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/aftfor.htm | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

==Musical style==
A precise definition for Nightwish's musical style is disputed. The band has been suggested as being part of the genres [[gothic metal]], [[symphonic metal]], and [[power metal]].

Some fans of Nightwish have argued that the band belongs to the "gothic metal" genre due to the fact that all of their albums have female vocals in them with a dark sound and gothic subjects. Examples are "Wish I Had an Angel" and "[[Planet Hell]]".<ref name="vpro">{{cite web | title=Nightwish verzorgt perfecte show| work=Recensie | url=http://3voor12.vpro.nl/3voor12/festivals/news/full.jsp?portal=2534202&event=23540172&news=13979499 | accessmonthday=December 31 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> Other fans have argued otherwise, saying that they should rather be labeled "power metal",<ref name="metalcrypt">{{cite web | title=The Metal Crypt | work=Brief Description of Metal Genres, as they are used as a reviewing and classification tool | url=http://www.metalcrypt.com/genresframe.php | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> based on the argument that they play more to that style and lack core elements of "gothic metal". ''The Metal Crypt'' also proclaim the band to be "power metal", or even [[Symphonic metal#Symphonic power metal|symphonic power metal]], a sub-genre similar to the style developed by [[Italy|Italian]] bands such as [[Rhapsody of Fire]].

Tuomas Holopainen once described their music as "melodic heavy metal with a female singer".<ref name="nightfall">{{cite web | title=Nightfall | work=Nightfall interview with: Tuomas Holopainen from Nightwish | url=http://www.nightfall.co.nz/interview_detail.php?interviewID=52 | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>
