'''Physics''' (Greek: [[physis]] – φύσις meaning "nature") is the [[natural science]] which examines basic concepts such as [[energy]], [[force]], and [[spacetime]] and all that derives from these, such as [[mass]], [[charge]], [[matter]]<ref>[[R. P. Feynman]], [[R. B. Leighton]], [[Matthew Sands|M. Sands]] (1963), ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'', ISBN 0-201-02116-1 Hard-cover. p.1-1 Feynman begins with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that ''all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ...''" vol. '''I''' p. I–2</ref> and its [[Motion (physics)|motion]].<ref>

Van Nostrand. p.1: "Nature of Physical Science – Physical science is that department of knowledge which relates to the order of nature." Accessdate=2008-11-04
</ref> More broadly, it is the general analysis of [[nature]], conducted in order to understand how the [[world]] and [[universe]] behave.<ref>H.D. Young & R.A. Freedman, ''University Physics with Modern Physics'': 11th Edition: International Edition (2004), Addison Wesley. Chapter 1, section 1.1, page 2 has this to say: "Physics is an ''experimental'' science. Physicists observe the phenomena of nature and try to find patterns and principles that relate these phenomena. These patterns are called physical theories or, when they are very well established and of broad use, physical laws or principles."</ref><ref>Steve Holzner, ''Physics for Dummies'' (2006), Wiley. Chapter 1, page 7 says: "Physics is the study of your world and the world and universe around you." See [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0764554336 Amazon Online Reader: Physics For Dummies (For Dummies(Math & Science))], retrieved 24 Nov 2006</ref>  Note that the term 'universe' is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the [[cosmos]], the [[world (philosophy)|philosophical world]], and nature.

Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of [[astronomy]].<ref>Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000BC, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Ancient Egyptians]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars.</ref> Over the last two millennia, physics had been considered synonymous with [[philosophy]], [[chemistry]], and certain branches of [[mathematics]] and [[biology]], but during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 16th century, it emerged to become a unique modern science in its own right.<ref>[[Francis Bacon]]'s 1620 ''Novum Organum'' was critical in the [[History of scientific method|development of scientific method]].</ref> However, in some subject areas such as in [[mathematical physics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], the boundaries and the borderlines of physics remain difficult to distinguish.

Physics is both significant and influential, in part because advances in its understanding have often translated into new technologies, but also because new ideas in physics often resonate with the other sciences, mathematics and philosophy. For example, advances in the understanding of [[electromagnetism]] led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern-day society (e.g., television, computers, and domestic appliances); advances in [[thermodynamics]] led to the development of motorized transport; and advances in [[mechanics]] inspired the development of the [[calculus]].

===Scope and goals===
[[Image:Maxwell'sEquations.svg|thumb|250px|[[Maxwell's equations]] of [[electromagnetism]].]]
[[Image:Pahoeoe fountain original.jpg|thumb|right|150px|This [[parabola]]-shaped [[lava flow]] illustrates [[Galileo]]'s [[law of falling bodies]] as well as [[blackbody radiation]] – you can tell the temperature from the color of the blackbody.]]
[[Image:Casa-72l.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Cassiopeia A]] – a [[sphere|spherically]] [[symmetry|symmetric]] remnant of the 1680 [[supernova]]]]

Physics covers a wide range of phenomena, from the smallest [[Subatomic particle|sub-atomic particle]]s, to the largest [[Galaxy|galaxies]]. Included in this are the very most basic objects from which all other things are composed of, and therefore physics is sometimes said to be the "fundamental science".<ref name = "Feynman lectures">''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' Volume I. Feynman, Leighton and Sands. ISBN 0-201-02115-3  See Chapter 3 : "The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences" for a general discussion. For the philosophical issue of whether other sciences can be "reduced" to physics, see [[reductionism]] and [[special sciences]]).</ref>

Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things we see around us to root causes, and then to try to connect these causes together in the hope of finding an [[Theory of Everything|ultimate reason]] for why nature is as it is. For example, the [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] observed that certain rocks ([[lodestone]]) were attracted to one another by some invisible force. This effect was later called [[magnetism]], and was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. A little earlier than the Chinese, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] knew of other objects such as [[amber]], that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two. This was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century, and came to be called [[electricity]]. Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause ([[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]). However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force – [[electromagnetism]]. This process of "unifying" forces [[Electroweak interaction|continues today]] (see section ''[[#Current research|Current research]]'' for more information).

===The scientific method===
Physics uses the [[scientific method]] to test the validity of a physical theory, using a methodical approach to compare the implications of the theory in question with the associated conclusions drawn from experiments and observations conducted to test it. Experiments and observations are to be collected and matched with the predictions and hypotheses made by a [[theory]], thus aiding in the determination or the validity/invalidity of the theory.

Theories which are very well supported by data and have never failed any empirical test are often called [[scientific law]]s, or natural laws. Of course, all theories, including those called scientific laws, can always be replaced by more accurate, generalized statements if a disagreement of theory with observed data is ever found.<ref>Some principles, such as [[Newton's laws of motion]], are still generally called "laws" even though they are now known to be limiting cases of newer theories. Thus, for example, in [[Thomas Brody]] (1993, Luis de la Peña and Peter Hodgson, eds.) ''The Philosophy Behind Physics'' ISBN 0-387-55914-0, pp 18–24 (Chapter 2), explains the 'epistemic cycle' in which a student of physics discovers that physics is not a finished product but is instead the process of creating [that product].</ref>

=== Theory and experiment===
{{main|Theoretical Physics|Experimental Physics}}
The culture of physics has a higher degree of separation between [[theory]] and [[experiment]] than many other sciences. Since the twentieth century, most individual physicists have specialized in either [[theoretical physics]] or [[experimental physics]]. In contrast, almost all the successful theorists in [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] (e.g. American [[quantum chemistry|quantum chemist]] and [[biochemistry|biochemist]] [[Linus Pauling]]) have also been experimentalists, although this is changing as of late.

Theorists seek to develop [[mathematical model]]s that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future results, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Although theory and experiment are developed separately, they are strongly dependent upon each other.  Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that existing theories cannot explain, or when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions, which inspire new experiments. In the absence of experiment, theoretical research can go in the wrong direction; this is one of the criticisms that has been leveled against [[M-theory]], a popular theory in high-energy physics for which no practical experimental test has ever been devised. Physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are often called [[Phenomenology (science)|phenomenologists]].

[[Theoretical physics]] is closely related to [[mathematics]], which provides the language of physical theories, and large areas of mathematics, such as [[calculus]], have been invented specifically to solve problems in physics. [[Theorist]]s may also rely on [[numerical analysis]] and [[simulation#computer simulation|computer simulations]].   The fields of [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and [[computational physics]] are active areas of research. Theoretical physics has historically rested on [[philosophy]] and [[metaphysics]]; electromagnetism was unified this way.<ref>
See, for example, the influence of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter|Ritter]] on [[Hans Christian Ørsted|Oersted]].
</ref> Beyond the known universe, the field of [[theoretical physics]] also deals with hypothetical issues,<ref>Concepts which are denoted ''hypothetical'' can change with time. For example, the [[atom]] of nineteenth century physics was denigrated by some, including [[Ernst Mach]]'s critique of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s formulation of [[statistical mechanics]]. By the end of [[World War II]], the atom was no longer deemed hypothetical.</ref> such as [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universes]], a [[Multiverse (science)|multiverse]], and [[higher dimension]]s. Physicists speculate on these possibilities, and from them, hypothesize theories.

[[Experiment]]al physics informs, and is informed by, [[engineering]] and [[technology]].  Experimental physicists involved in [[basic research]] design and perform experiments with equipment such as [[particle accelerator]]s and [[laser]]s, whereas those involved in [[applied research]] often work in industry, developing technologies such as [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]] and [[transistor]]s. Feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas which are not well explored by theorists.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

===Physics is quantitative===
[[Image:Astronaut-EVA.jpg|thumb|100px|right|The astronaut and Earth are both in [[free-fall]]]]
[[Image:PrismAndLight.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Dispersion (optics)|Dispersion]] of [[light]] by a [[prism]]]]
[[Image:Lightning in Arlington.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Lightning]] is [[electric current]]]]

Most of the experimental results in physics are numerical measurements and theories in physics use mathematics to give numerical results to match these measurements. Physical definitions, [[model theory|models]] and theories can often be expressed using mathematical relations.

A key difference between physics and mathematics is that because physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the material world, it tests its theories by comparing the predictions of its theories with data procured from observations and experimentation, whereas mathematics is concerned with abstract logical patterns not limited by those observed in the real world (because the real world is limited in the number of dimensions and in many other ways it does not have to correspond to richer mathematical structures). The distinction, however, is not always clear-cut. There is a large area of research intermediate between physics and mathematics, known as [[mathematical physics]].

===Relation to mathematics and the other sciences===
In the ''Assayer'' (1622), Galileo noted that mathematics is the language in which Nature expresses its laws.<ref>
"Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes. I mean the universe, but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word of it, and without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth." – [[Galileo]] (1623), ''[[The Assayer]]'', as quoted by G. Toraldo Di Francia (1976), ''The Investigation of the Physical World'' ISBN 0-521-29925-X p.10
</ref> Physics relies on [[mathematics]] to provide the logical framework in which physical laws can be precisely formulated and their predictions quantified. Physical [[definitions]], [[model (abstract)|models]] and theories can be succinctly expressed using mathematical relations. Whenever [[analytic solution]]s are not feasible, [[numerical analysis]] and [[simulation#computer simulation|simulations]] can be utilized. Thus, [[scientific computing|scientific computation]] is an integral part of physics, and the field of [[computational physics]] is an active area of research.

Physics is also intimately related to many other sciences, as well as applied fields like engineering and medicine. The principles of physics find applications throughout the other [[natural science]]s as some phenomena studied in physics, such as the [[conservation of energy]], are common to ''all'' material systems. Other phenomena, such as superconductivity, stem from these laws, but are not laws themselves because they only appear in some systems. Physics is often said to be the "fundamental science" (chemistry is sometimes included), because each of the other disciplines ([[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[material science]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]] etc.) deals with particular types of material systems that obey the laws of physics.<ref name = "Feynman lectures"/> For example, chemistry is the science of collections of matter (such as gases and liquids formed of [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s) and the processes known as [[chemical reaction]]s that result in the change of [[chemical substance]]s. The structure, reactivity, and properties of a [[chemical compound]] are determined by the properties of the underlying molecules, which can be described by areas of physics such as [[quantum mechanics]] (called in this case [[quantum chemistry]]), [[thermodynamics]], and [[electromagnetism]].

===Philosophical implications===
{{more|Philosophy of Physics}}
{{Quote box|quote=Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things. |source=Isaac Newton}}

Physics in many ways stemmed from [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. From [[Thales]]' first attempt to characterize matter, to [[Democritus]]' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the [[Ptolemaic astronomy]] of a crystalline [[firmament]], and Aristotle's book ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', different Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Well into the 18th century, physics was known as "[[Natural philosophy]]".

By the 19th century physics was realized as a [[positive science]] and a distinct discipline separate from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on [[philosophy of science]] to give an adequate description of the scientific method.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Alex|title=Philosophy of Science|publisher=Routledge|date=2006|isbn=0-415-34317-8}} See Chapter 1 for a discussion on the necessity of philosophy of science.</ref> The scientific method employs [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori reasoning]] as well as [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a posteriori]] reasoning and the use of [[Bayesian inference]] to measure the validity of a given theory.<ref>Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003), Chapter 14 "Bayesianism and Modern Theories of Evidence" ''Theory and Reality: an introduction to the philosophy of science'' ISBN 0-226-30063-3</ref> 

The development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers, but has also raised new questions. Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the [[philosophy of physics]], involves issues such as the nature of [[space]] and [[time]], [[determinism]], and metaphysical outlooks such as [[empiricism]], [[naturalism]] and [[realism]].<ref>Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003), Chapter 15 "Empiricism, Naturalism, and Scientific Realism?" ''Theory and Reality: an introduction to the philosophy of science'' ISBN 0-226-30063-3</ref>

Many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance [[Laplace]], who championed [[causal determinism]],<ref>See Laplace, Pierre Simon, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities'', translated from the 6th French edition by Frederick Wilson Truscott and Frederick Lincoln Emory, Dover Publications (New York, 1951)</ref> and [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who wrote on Quantum Mechanics.<ref>See "The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics" Ox Bow Press (1995) ISBN 1881987094. and "My View of the World" Ox Bow Press (1983) ISBN 0918024307.</ref> The mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]] has been called a [[Platonist]] by [[Stephen Hawking]],<ref> Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose (1996), ''The Nature of Space and Time'' ISBN 0-691-05084-8 p.4 "I think that Roger is a Platonist at heart but he must answer for himself." </ref> a view Penrose  discusses in his book, ''The Road to Reality''.<ref>Roger Penrose, ''The Road to Reality'' ISBN 0-679-45443-8</ref> Hawking refers to himself as an "unashamed reductionist" and takes issue with Penrose's views.<ref>{{cite book|last=Penrose|first=Roger|coauthors=Abner Shimony, Nancy Cartwright, Stephen Hawking|title=The Large, the Small and the Human Mind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|isbn=0-521-78572-3}}</ref>

==History==

[[Image:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Aristotle]]]]

===Ancient times===
Since antiquity, people have tried to understand the behavior of the natural world. One great mystery was the predictable behavior of celestial objects such as the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]]. Several theories were proposed, the majority of which were disproved. Early physical theories were largely couched in philosophical terms, and never verified by systematic experimental testing as is popular today. Many of the commonly accepted works of [[Ptolemy]] and [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]] are not always found to match everyday observations. Even so, [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]] and [[Indian science and technology#Astronomy|astronomers]] gave many correct descriptions in [[atomism]] and [[astronomy]], and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] thinker [[Archimedes]] derived many correct quantitative descriptions of [[mechanics]] and [[hydrostatics]].

===Middle Ages===
[[Image:Ibn al-Haytham.png|thumb|right|[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen)]]

The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers eventually resulted in a period of major scientific advancements, now known as the [[Scientific Revolution]] of the late 17th century. The precursors to the scientific revolution can be traced back to the important developments made in India and Persia, including the [[ellipse|elliptical]] model of planetary orbits based on the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[solar system]] developed by [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematician]]-astronomer [[Aryabhata]]; the basic ideas of [[atomic theory]] developed by [[Hindu]] and [[Jaina]] philosophers;{{Fact|date=December 2008}} the theory of light being equivalent to energy particles developed by the Indian [[Buddhist]] scholars [[Dignāga]] and [[Dharmakirti]];{{Fact|date=December 2008}} the optical theory of [[light]] developed by [[Arab people|Arab]] [[Islamic science|scientist]] [[Alhazen]]; the [[Astrolabe]] invented by the Persian [[Mohammad al-Fazari]]; and the significant flaws in the [[Ptolemaic system]] pointed out by Persian scientist [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]]. As the influence of the [[Islam]]ic [[Caliph]]ate expanded to Europe, the works of Aristotle preserved by the [[Arab]]s, and the works of the Indians and Persians, became known in Europe by the 12th and 13th centuries.

The [[Middle Ages]] saw the emergence of [[experimental physics]] with the development of an early [[scientific method]] emphasizing the role of [[experiment]]ation and [[mathematics]]. [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen, 965–1039) is considered a central figure in this shift in physics from a philosophical activity to an experimental one. In his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), he developed an early [[scientific method]] in order to prove the intromission theory of [[Visual perception|vision]] and discredit the [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory of vision]] previously supported by [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]].<ref name=Thiele>{{citation|first=Rüdiger|last=Thiele|year=2005|title=In Memoriam: Matthias Schramm, 1928–2005|journal=Historia Mathematica|volume=32|issue=3|date=August 2005|pages=271–274|doi=10.1016/j.hm.2005.05.002}}: {{quote|“Through a closer examination of Ibn al-Haytham's conceptions of [[mathematical model]]s and of the role they play in his theory of [[sense]] [[perception]], it becomes evident that he was the true founder of physics in the modern sense of the word; in fact he anticipated by six centuries the fertile ideas that were to mark the beginning of this new branch of science.”}}</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Rüdiger|last=Thiele|year=2005|title=In Memoriam: Matthias Schramm|journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=15|pages=329–331|doi=10.1017/S0957423905000214}}</ref><ref name=Gorini>{{cite journal |last=Gorini |first=Rosanna |title=Al-Haytham the man of experience.

I. Sabra]] (1989), ''Ibn al-Haytham, The Optics of Ibn al-Haytham'', London: The Warburg Institute, vol. I, pp. 90-91</ref> This experimental tradition in optics established by Ibn al-Haytham continued among his successors in both the Islamic world, with the likes of [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]], [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī]] and [[Taqi al-Din]], and in Europe, with the likes of [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Witelo]], [[John Pecham]], [[Theodoric of Freiberg]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Willebrord Snellius]], [[René Descartes]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]].

===The Scientific Revolution===
[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|right|[[Galileo]]]]
The Scientific Revolution is held by most historians (e.g., Howard Margolis) to have begun in 1543, when the first printed copy of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'s ''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium|De Revolutionibus]]'' (most of which had been written years prior but whose publication had been delayed) was brought from [[Nuremberg]] to the <!-- do not enter nationality claims here --> astronomer, who died soon after receiving the copy.

[[Image:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir Isaac Newton]]]]
Further significant advances were made over the following century by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[Johannes Kepler]], and [[Blaise Pascal]]. During the early 17th century, Galileo championed the use of observation and experimentation to validate physical theories. Galileo formulated and successfully tested several results in [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], in particular the Law of [[Inertia]]. In 1687, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', detailing two comprehensive and successful physical theories: [[Newton's laws of motion]], from which arise [[classical mechanics]]; and [[Newton's Law of Gravitation]], which describes the [[fundamental force]] of [[gravity]]. Both theories agreed well with experiment. The ''Principia'' also included several theories in [[fluid dynamics]]. Classical mechanics was re-formulated and extended by [[Leonhard Euler]], French mathematician [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Joseph-Louis Comte de Lagrange]], Irish mathematical physicist [[William Rowan Hamilton]], and others, who produced new results in mathematical physics. The law of universal gravitation initiated the field of [[astrophysics]], which describes [[astronomy|astronomical]] phenomena using physical theories.

After Newton defined [[classical mechanics]], the next great field of inquiry within physics was the nature of [[electricity]]. Observations in the 17th and 18th century by scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]] created a foundation for later work. These observations also established our basic understanding of electrical charge and [[electric current]].
[[Image:James Clerk Maxwell.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]

In 1821, the English physicist and chemist [[Michael Faraday]] integrated the study of [[magnetism]] with the study of electricity. This was done by demonstrating that a moving [[magnet]] induced an [[electric current]] in a [[conductor (material)|conductor]]. Faraday also formulated a physical conception of [[electromagnetic field]]s. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] built upon this conception, in 1864, with an interlinked set of 20 equations that explained the interactions between [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. These 20 equations were later reduced, using [[vector calculus]], to a set of four equations, namely [[Maxwell's equations]], by [[Oliver Heaviside]].

In addition to other electromagnetic phenomena, Maxwell's equations also can be used to describe [[light]]. Confirmation of this observation was made with the 1888 discovery of [[radio]] by [[Heinrich Hertz]] and in 1895 when [[Wilhelm Roentgen]] detected [[X rays]]. The ability to describe light in electromagnetic terms helped serve as a springboard for [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of the theory of [[special relativity]] in 1905. This theory combined classical mechanics with Maxwell's equations.

From the late 17th century onwards, [[thermodynamics]] was developed by physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle]], [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], and many others. In 1733, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] used statistical arguments with classical mechanics to derive thermodynamic results, initiating the field of [[statistical mechanics]]. In 1798, [[Benjamin Thompson]] demonstrated the conversion of mechanical work into heat, and in 1847 [[James Joule]] stated the law of conservation of [[energy]], in the form of heat as well as mechanical energy. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], in the 19th century, is responsible for the modern form of statistical mechanics.

{{-}}

===1895 to present===
In 1895, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] discovered [[X-ray]]s, which turned out to be high-frequency electromagnetic radiation. [[Radioactivity]] was discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]], and further studied by [[Maria Sklodowska-Curie|Marie Curie]], [[Pierre Curie]], and others. This initiated the field of [[nuclear physics]].

In 1897, [[J.J. Thomson|Joseph J. Thomson]] discovered the [[electron]], the elementary particle which carries electrical current in [[electrical circuit|circuits]]. In 1904, he proposed the first model of the [[atom]], known as the [[atom/plum pudding|plum pudding model]]. (The existence of the atom had been proposed in 1808 by [[John Dalton]].)

These discoveries revealed that the assumption of many physicists that atoms were the basic unit of [[matter]] was flawed, and prompted further study into the structure of [[atom]]s. In 1911, [[Ernest Rutherford]] deduced from [[rutherford scattering|scattering experiments]] the existence of a compact atomic nucleus, with positively charged constituents dubbed [[proton]]s. [[Neutron]]s, the neutral nuclear constituents, were discovered in 1932 by [[James Chadwick|Chadwick]]. The equivalence of mass and energy (Einstein, 1905) was spectacularly demonstrated during [[World War II]], as research was conducted by each side into [[nuclear physics]], for the purpose of creating a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]]. The German effort, led by Heisenberg, did not succeed, but the Allied [[Manhattan Project]] reached its goal. In America, a team led by [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]] achieved the first man-made [[nuclear chain reaction]] in 1942, and in 1945 the world's first [[nuclear weapon|nuclear explosive]] was detonated at [[Trinity site]], near [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]].

In 1900, [[Max Planck]] published his explanation of [[blackbody radiation]].<ref>See, for example pp.116–117, [[Max Planck]] ''A Survey of Physical Theory'' ISBN 0-486-67867-9
</ref> This equation assumed that radiators are [[quantum|quantized]] in nature, which proved to be the opening argument in the edifice that would become [[quantum mechanics]].

[[Image:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Albert Einstein]] in 1947]]

1905 was Albert Einstein's "[[Annus Mirabilis papers|Annus Mirabilis]]", during which he wrote five groundbreaking papers, including a paper on [[Special Relativity]]. Relativity prescribes a different transformation between [[inertial frame of reference|reference frames]] than classical mechanics which necessitated the development of relativistic mechanics. Einstein built further on the special theory by including gravity into his calculations, and published his theory of [[general relativity]] in 1915. [[General relativity]] unifies space and time into a single entity, [[spacetime]]. 

One part of the theory of general relativity are [[Einstein's field equation]]s. These describes how the ''stress-energy tensor'' creates curvature of [[spacetime]] and forms the basis of general relativity. Further work on Einstein's field equation produced results which predicted the [[Big Bang]], [[black hole]]s, and the [[expanding universe]]. Einstein believed in a static universe and tried (and failed) to fix his equation to allow for this. However, by 1929 [[Edwin Hubble]]'s astronomical observations suggested that the universe is expanding. Thus, the universe must have been smaller and therefore hotter in the past. In 1933 [[Karl Jansky]] at Bell Labs discovered the radio emission from the [[Milky Way]], and thereby initiated the science of [[radio astronomy]]. By the 1940s, researchers like [[George Gamow]] proposed the ''[[Big Bang]]'' theory,<ref>Alpher, Herman, and Gamow. ''Nature'' '''162''', 774 (1948).</ref> evidence for which was discovered in 1964;<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Robert W. |authorlink=Robert Woodrow Wilson|date=1978 |url=http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1978/wilson-lecture.pdf |title=The cosmic microwave background radiation |format=PDF |accessdate=2006-06-07 }} Wilson's Nobel Lecture.</ref> [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Fred Hoyle]] were among the doubters in the 1940s and 1950s. Hoyle had dubbed Gamow's theory the ''Big Bang'' in order to debunk it. Today, it is one of the principal tenents of [[physical cosmology]].

Beginning in 1900, [[Max Planck|Planck]], Einstein, [[Niels Bohr]], and others developed [[quantum]] theories to explain various anomalous experimental results by introducing discrete energy levels. In 1925, [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]] and [[Paul Dirac]] formulated [[quantum mechanics]], which explained the preceding heuristic quantum theories. In quantum mechanics, the outcomes of physical measurements are inherently [[probability|probabilistic]]; the theory describes the calculation of these probabilities. It successfully describes the behavior of matter at small distance scales. During the 1920s [[Erwin Schrödinger]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], and [[Max Born]] were able to formulate a consistent picture of the chemical behavior of matter, a complete theory of the electronic structure of the atom, as a byproduct of the quantum theory.[[Image:Feynman and Oppenheimer at Los Alamos.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Feynman]] (center) with [[Robert Oppenheimer]] (right) relaxing at a [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] social function during the [[Manhattan Project]].]]

[[Quantum field theory]] was formulated in order to extend quantum mechanics to be consistent with special relativity. It was devised in the late 1940s with work by [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]], [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]], and [[Freeman Dyson]]. They formulated the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]], which describes the electromagnetic interaction, and successfully explained the "[[Lamb shift]]". Quantum field theory provided the framework for modern [[particle physics]], which studies [[fundamental force]]s and elementary particles.

[[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Tsung-Dao Lee]], in the 1950s, discovered an unexpected [[asymmetry]]<ref>[http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/Phase2/Wu,_Chien_Shiung@841234567.html C.S. Wu's contribution to the overthrow of the conservation of parity]</ref> in the decay of a [[subatomic particle]]. In 1954, Yang and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] then developed a class of [[gauge theory|gauge theories]]<ref>
Yang, Mills 1954 ''[[Physical Review]]'' '''95''', 631; Yang, Mills 1954 ''Physical Review'' '''96''', 191.
</ref> which provided the framework for understanding the nuclear forces. The theory for the [[strong nuclear force]] was first proposed by [[Murray Gell-Mann]]. The [[electroweak force]], the unification of the [[weak nuclear force]] with electromagnetism, was proposed by [[Sheldon Lee Glashow]], [[Abdus Salam]] and [[Steven Weinberg]] and confirmed in 1964 by [[James Watson Cronin]] and [[Val Fitch]]. This led to the so-called [[Standard Model]] of particle physics in the 1970s, which successfully describes all the elementary particles observed to date.

Quantum mechanics also provided the theoretical tools for [[condensed matter physics]], whose largest branch is [[solid state physics]]. It studies the physical behavior of solids and liquids, including phenomena such as [[crystal structure]]s, [[semiconductor|semiconductivity]], and [[superconductor|superconductivity]]. The pioneers of condensed matter physics include [[Felix Bloch|Bloch]], who created a quantum mechanical description of the behavior of electrons in crystal structures in 1928. The transistor was developed by physicists [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]] and [[William Bradford Shockley]] in 1947 at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]].

The two themes of the 20th century, general relativity and quantum mechanics, appear inconsistent with each other.<ref>"There is as yet no logically consistent and complete relativistic quantum theory." [[V. B. Berestetskii]], [[E. M. Lifshitz]], [[L. P. Pitaevskii]] (1971, 1979) ''Relativistic Quantum Theory, Volume 4, Part 1, Course of Theoretical Physics'' ISBN 0080160255 p. 4 </ref> General relativity describes the [[universe]] on the scale of [[planet]]s and [[solar system]]s while quantum mechanics operates on sub-atomic scales. This challenge is being attacked by [[string theory]], which treats [[spacetime]] as composed, not of points, but of one-dimensional objects, [[string theory|strings]]. Strings have properties like a common string (e.g., [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]] and [[vibration]]). The theories yield promising, but not yet testable results. The search for experimental verification of string theory is in progress.

==Branches of Physics==
{{further|[[Classical physics]], [[Modern physics]], [[Topic outline of physics]]}}
[[Image:Modernphysicsfields.svg|thumb|350px|right|Domains of major fields of physics]]

While physics deals with a wide variety of systems, there are certain theories that are used by all physicists. Each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found correct as an approximation of Nature (within a certain domain of validity). For instance, the theory of [[classical mechanics]] accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than [[atom]]s and moving at much less than the [[speed of light]]. These theories continue to be areas of active research; for instance, a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as [[chaos theory|chaos]] was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727). These "central theories" are important tools for research into more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of his or her specialization, is expected to be literate in them.

===Classical mechanics===
{{main|Classical mechanics}}
[[Image:Newton Cannon.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Newton's cannonball]], an [[artificial satellite]]]]

[[Classical mechanics]] is a model of the physics of [[force]]s acting upon bodies. It is often referred to as "Newtonian mechanics" after [[Isaac Newton]] and his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]. Mechanics is subdivided into [[statics]], which models objects at rest, [[kinematics]], which models objects in motion, and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], which models objects subjected to forces. The classical mechanics of continuous and deformable objects is [[continuum mechanics]], which can itself be broken down into [[solid mechanics]] and [[fluid mechanics]] according to the state of matter being studied. The latter, the mechanics of [[liquid]]s and [[gas]]es, includes [[hydrostatics]], [[hydrodynamics]], [[pneumatics]], [[aerodynamics]], and other fields.
 
An important concept of mechanics is the identification of conserved [[energy]] and [[momentum]], which lead to the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] reformulations of Newton's laws. [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] for statistical and Hamiltonian mechanics is a classical nineteenth century result which describes the behavior of the [[phase space]] [[distribution function]]. Liouville's theorem has a suggestive formulation, the [[Poisson bracket]], which encodes [[Hamilton's equations]] of classical mechanics, and has analogies with the [[commutator]] in quantum mechanics. 

A relatively recent result of considerations concerning the dynamics of nonlinear systems is [[chaos theory]], the study of systems in which small changes in a variable may have large effects. 

===Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics===
{{main|Thermodynamics|Statistical mechanics}}
[[Image:Triple expansion engine animation.gif|thumb|right|300px|Typical [[thermodynamic system]] - heat moves from hot (boiler) to cold (condenser) and [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] is extracted]]

[[Feynman]] started out the [[Feynman Lectures on Physics]] with the [[Atomic theory#Modern atomic theory|existence of atoms]], which he considered to be the most compact statement of physics, from which the science could be most easily be result if all other knowledge was lost. By modeling matter as collections of hard spheres, it is possible to describe the [[kinetic theory of gases]], upon which classical thermodynamics is based.

[[Thermodynamics]] studies the effects of changes in [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and [[volume]] on [[physical system]]s at the [[macroscopic]] scale, and the transfer of energy as [[heat]].<ref name="Perrot" >{{cite book | author=Perrot, Pierre | title=A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1998 | id=ISBN 0-19-856552-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Clark, John, O.E.| title=The Essential Dictionary of Science | publisher=Barnes & Noble Books | year=2004 | id=ISBN 0-7607-4616-8}}</ref> Historically, thermodynamics developed out of need to increase the [[thermodynamic efficiency|efficiency]] of early [[steam engine]]s.<ref>{{cite book | last = Clausius | first = Ruldolf | title = On the Motive Power of Heat, and on the Laws which can be deduced from it for the Theory of Heat | publisher = Poggendorff's ''Annalen der Physick'', LXXIX (Dover Reprint) | year = 1850 | id = ISBN 0-486-59065-8}}</ref> 

The starting point for most thermodynamic considerations are the [[laws of thermodynamics]], which postulate that [[energy]] can be exchanged between physical systems as heat or [[Mechanical work|work]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Van Ness, H.C. | title=Understanding Thermodynamics | publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. | year=1969 | id=ISBN 0-486-63277-6}}</ref> They also postulate the existence of a quantity named [[entropy]], which can be defined for any system.<ref>{{cite book | author=Dugdale, J.S. | title=Entropy and its Physical Meaning | publisher=Taylor and Francis | year=1998 | id=ISBN 0-7484-0569-0}}</ref> In thermodynamics, interactions between large ensembles of objects are studied and categorized. Central to this are the concepts of [[System (thermodynamics)|system]] and [[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|surroundings]].  A system is composed of particles, whose average motions define its properties, which in turn are related to one another through [[Equation of state|equations of state]]. Properties can be combined to express [[internal energy]] and [[thermodynamic potentials]], which are useful for determining conditions for [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and [[spontaneous process]]es.

===Electromagnetism===
{{main|Electromagnetism}}
{{see also|Optics}}

[[Electromagnetism]] describes the interaction of charged particles with electric and magnetic [[field (physics)|field]]s. It can be divided into [[electrostatics]], the study of interactions between [[Electric charge|charge]]s at rest, and [[electrodynamics]], the study of interactions between moving charges and [[radiation]]. The classical theory of electromagnetism is based on the [[Lorentz force]] law and [[Maxwell's equations]]. [[Light]] is an oscillating [[electromagnetic field]] that is radiated from accelerating charged particles. Thus, all of [[optics]], the study of the nature and propagation of light, can be reduced to electromagnetic interactions. 

A more recent development is [[quantum electrodynamics]], which incorporates the laws of [[Quantum field theory|quantum theory]] in order to explain the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter. Relativistic electrodynamics accounts for [[special relativity|relativistic]] corrections to the motions of charged particles when their speeds approach the speed of light.  It applies to phenomena involved with [[particle accelerators]] and electron tubes carrying high [[voltages]] and [[Electric current|current]]s.

===Relativity===
{{main|Special relativity|General relativity}}

The [[Theory of relativity|special theory of relativity]] enjoys a relationship with electromagnetism and  mechanics; that is, the [[principle of relativity]] and the [[principle of stationary action]] in mechanics can be used to derive [[Maxwell's equations]],<ref>Landau and Lifshitz (1951, 1962), ''The Classical Theory of Fields'', Library of Congress Card Number 62-9181, Chapters 1–4 (3rd edition is ISBN 0080160190)</ref><ref>Corson and Lorrain, ''Electromagnetic Fields and Waves'' ISBN 0716718235</ref> and ''vice versa''.

The theory of [[special relativity]] was proposed in 1905 by [[Albert Einstein]] in his article "[[Annus Mirabilis Papers#Special relativity|On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]]".  The title of the article refers to the fact that special relativity resolves an inconsistency between [[Maxwell's equations]] and classical mechanics. The theory is based on [[postulates of special relativity|two postulates]]: (1) that the mathematical forms of the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] are invariant in all [[inertial frame of reference|inertial systems]]; and (2) that the [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is constant and independent of the source or observer.  Reconciling the two postulates requires a unification of [[space]] and [[time]] into the frame-dependent concept of [[spacetime]].

[[General relativity]] is the [[Geometry|geometrical]] [[theory]] of [[gravitation]] published by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915/16.<ref name=Ein1915>{{cite journal|last=Einstein| first=Albert| authorlink = Albert Einstein| date=November 25, 1915| title=Die Feldgleichungen der Gravitation| journal=Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin| pages=844–847 | url=http://nausikaa2.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/toc/toc.x.cgi?dir=6E3MAXK4&step=thumb | accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref><ref name = Ein1916> {{cite journal| last = Einstein| first = Albert| title = The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity| journal = Annalen der Physik| volume = | issue = | pages = | date = 1916| publisher = | url = http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html| format = PDF| id =  | accessdate = 2006-09-03 }} </ref> It unifies [[special relativity]], [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], and the insight that gravitation can be described by the [[curvature]] of [[space]] and [[time]].  In general relativity, the curvature of [[space-time]] is produced by the [[energy]] of matter and radiation.

===Quantum mechanics===
{{main|Quantum mechanics}}
[[Image:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|right|225px|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Electron configuration|electron orbital]]s shown as cross-sections with color-coded [[probability amplitude|probability density]]]]
[[Image:SchrodingerEquation.PNG.svg|thumb|right|225px|[[Schrödinger equation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]]]

[[Quantum mechanics]] is the branch of physics treating [[atom]]ic and [[subatomic particle|subatomic]] systems and their interaction with [[radiation]]. It is based on the observation that all forms of energy are released in discrete units or bundles called "[[quantum|quanta]]". Remarkably, quantum theory typically permits only [[probability|probable]] or [[statistics|statistical]] calculation of the observed features of subatomic particles, understood in terms of [[wavefunction]]s. The [[Schrödinger equation]] plays the role in quantum mechanics that [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] and [[conservation of energy]] serve in classical mechanics — i.e., it predicts the future behavior of a [[dynamical system|dynamic system]] — and is a [[wave equation]] that is used to solve for wavefunctions.

For example, the light, or electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by an atom has only certain [[frequency|frequencies]] (or [[wavelength]]s), as can be seen from the [[atomic spectra|line spectrum]] associated with the chemical element represented by that atom. The quantum theory shows that those frequencies correspond to definite energies of the light quanta, or [[photon]]s, and result from the fact that the [[electron]]s of the atom can have only certain allowed energy values, or levels; when an electron changes from one allowed level to another, a quantum of energy is emitted or absorbed whose frequency is directly proportional to the energy difference between the two levels. The [[photoelectric effect]] further confirmed the quantization of light. 
  
In 1924, [[Louis de Broglie]] proposed that not only do light waves sometimes exhibit particle-like properties, but particles may also exhibit wavelike properties. Two different formulations of quantum mechanics were presented following de Broglie’s suggestion. The [[wave mechanics]] of [[Erwin Schrödinger]] (1926) involves the use of a mathematical entity, the wave function, which is related to the probability of finding a particle at a given point in space. The [[matrix mechanics]] of [[Werner Heisenberg]] (1925) makes no mention of wave functions or similar concepts but was shown to be mathematically equivalent to Schrödinger’s theory. A particularly important discovery of the quantum theory is the [[uncertainty principle]], enunciated by Heisenberg in 1927, which places an absolute theoretical limit on the accuracy of certain measurements; as a result, the assumption by earlier scientists that the physical state of a system could be measured exactly and used to predict future states had to be abandoned. Quantum mechanics was combined with the theory of relativity in the formulation of [[Paul Dirac]]. Other developments include [[quantum statistics]], [[quantum electrodynamics]], concerned with interactions between charged particles and electromagnetic fields; and its generalization, [[quantum field theory]].

==Research fields==
Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into [[condensed matter physics]]; [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]; [[particle physics]]; [[astrophysics]]; [[geophysics]] and [[biophysics]]. Some physics departments also support research in [[Physics education]]. Since the twentieth century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly [[specialization|specialized]], and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. "Universalists" such as [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955) and [[Lev Landau]] (1908–1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.<ref>
Yet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. For example, the [[World Wide Web]], which was innovated at [[CERN]] by [[Tim Berners-Lee]], was created in service to the computer infrastructure of CERN, and was/is intended for use by physicists worldwide. The same might be said for [[arXiv.org]]
</ref>{{hidden|Table of the major fields of physics, along with their subfields and the theories they employ|{{:Physics/Subfields}}}}

====Condensed matter====
{{main|Condensed matter physics}}
[[Image:Bose Einstein condensate.png|right|thumb|350px|Velocity-distribution data of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms, confirming the discovery of a new phase of matter, the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]]]

[[Condensed matter physics]] is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of [[matter]]. In particular, it is concerned with the "condensed" [[phase (matter)|phases]] that appear whenever the number of constituents in a system is extremely large and the interactions between the constituents are strong. The most familiar examples of condensed phases are [[Solid-state physics|solids]] and [[liquid]]s, which arise from the bonding and [[electromagnetic force]] between [[atom]]s. More exotic condensed phases include the [[superfluid]] and the [[Bose-Einstein condensate]] found in certain atomic systems at very low [[temperature]], the [[superconductivity|superconducting]] phase exhibited by [[conduction electron]]s in certain materials, and the [[ferromagnet]]ic and [[antiferromagnet]]ic phases of [[spin (physics)|spin]]s on [[crystal lattice|atomic lattices]].

Condensed matter physics is by far the largest field of contemporary physics. By one estimate, one third of all American [[physicist]]s identify themselves as condensed matter physicists.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Historically, condensed matter physics grew out of [[solid-state physics]], which is now considered one of its main subfields. The term ''condensed matter physics'' was apparently coined by [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]] when he renamed his research group — previously ''solid-state theory'' — in 1967. In 1978, the Division of Solid State Physics at the [[American Physical Society]] was renamed as the Division of Condensed Matter Physics.<ref name=dcmp_governance>{{cite web | url =  http://dcmp.bc.edu/page.php?name=governance_history | title = Division of Condensed Matter Physics Governance History | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}</ref>  Condensed matter physics has a large overlap with [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[engineering]].

====Atomic, molecular, and optical physics====
{{main|Atomic, molecular, and optical physics}}
[[Atom]]ic, [[Molecule|molecular]], and [[Optics|optical]] physics (AMO) is the study of [[matter]]-matter and [[light]]-matter interactions on the scale of single [[atom]]s or structures containing a few atoms. The three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality of the [[energy]] scales that are relevant. All three areas include both [[classical physics|classical]] and [[quantum physics|quantum]] treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).

[[Atomic physics]] studies the [[electron]] hull of [[atom]]s.  Current research focuses on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions, low-temperature collision dynamics, the collective behavior of atoms in weakly interacting gases (Bose-Einstein Condensates and dilute Fermi degenerate systems), precision measurements of fundamental constants, and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics.  Atomic physics is influenced by the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (see, e.g., [[hyperfine splitting]]), but intra-nuclear phenomenon such as [[nuclear fission|fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] are considered part of [[high energy physics]].

[[Molecular physics]] focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light.  [[Optical physics]] is distinct from [[optics]] in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects, but on the fundamental properties of [[optical field]]s and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm.

====High energy/particle physics====
{{main|Particle physics}}
[[Image:CMS Higgs-event.jpg|thumb|A simulated event in the CMS detector of the [[Large Hadron Collider]], featuring the appearance of the Higgs boson.]]

[[Particle physics]] is the study of the [[elementary particle|elementary]] constituents of [[matter]] and [[energy]], and the interactions between them. It may also be called "high energy physics", because many elementary particles do not occur naturally, but are created only during high energy [[collision]]s of other particles, as can be detected in [[particle accelerator]]s.

Currently, the interactions of elementary particles are described by the [[Standard Model]]. The model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter that interact via the [[strong nuclear force|strong]], [[weak nuclear force|weak]], and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[fundamental force]]s.  Dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging messenger particles that carry the forces.  These messenger particles are known as [[gluon]]s; [[W boson|W<sup>−</sup> and W<sup>+</sup>]] and [[Z boson]]s; and the [[photon]]s, respectively.   The Standard Model also predicts a particle known as the [[Higgs boson|Higgs]] [[boson]], the existence of which has not yet been verified.

====Astrophysics====
{{main|Astrophysics|Physical cosmology}}
[[Image:Hubble ultra deep field high rez edit1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The deepest visible-light image of the [[universe]], the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]]]

[[Astrophysics]] and [[astronomy]] are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of [[stellar structure]], [[stellar evolution]], the origin of the [[solar system]], and related problems of [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.

The discovery by [[Karl Jansky]] in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of [[radio astronomy]]. Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. Perturbations and interference from the earth’s atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for [[infrared astronomy|infrared]], [[ultraviolet astronomy|ultraviolet]], [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray]], and [[X-ray astronomy]]. 

[[Physical cosmology]] is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20th century, [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]]'s discovery that the universe was expanding, as shown by the [[Hubble diagram]], prompted rival explanations known as the [[steady state]] universe and the [[Big Bang]].  The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] in 1964. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein's general relativity and the [[cosmological principle]]. Cosmologists have recently established a [[Lambda-CDM model|precise model]] of the evolution of the universe, which includes [[cosmic inflation]], [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]].

==Application and influence==
{{main|Applied physics}}
[[Image:IMG 1729 Gemaal met schroef van Archimedes bij Kinderdijk.JPG|thumb|right|[[Archimedes' screw]] uses [[simple machine]]s to lift [[water]].]]

[[Applied physics]] is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular [[Utility|use]]. An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from [[engineering]] in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem. The approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. Applied physicists can also be interested the use of physics for scientific research. For instance, people working on [[accelerator physics]] might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics.

Physics is used heavily in [[engineering]]. For example, [[Statics]], a subfield of [[mechanics]], is used in the building of [[bridge]]s and other structures. The understanding and use of [[acoustics]] results in better concert halls; similarly, the use of [[optics]] creates better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic [[flight simulator]]s, video games, and movies, and is often critical in [[forensic]] investigations.

With the [[Uniformitarianism (science)|standard consensus]] that the [[Scientific law|laws]] of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in [[uncertainty]]. For example, in the [[History of Earth#Origin|study of the origin of the Earth]], one can reasonably model Earth's [[mass]], [[temperature]], and rate of [[rotation]], over [[time]]. It also allows for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology.

==Current research==
{{further|[[Unsolved problems in physics]]}}
[[Image:Feynman'sDiagram.JPG|thumb|right|[[Feynman diagram]] signed by [[R. P. Feynman]]]]

Research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.

In condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of [[high-temperature superconductivity]]. Many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable [[spintronics]] and [[quantum computer]]s.

In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the [[Standard Model]] have begun to appear. Foremost among these are indications that [[neutrino]]s have non-zero [[mass]]. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing [[solar neutrino problem]], and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research. In the next several years, [[particle accelerator]]s will begin probing energy scales in the [[TeV]] range, in which experimentalists are hoping to find evidence<ref>

</ref> for the [[Higgs boson]] and [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric particles]].

Theoretical attempts to unify [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] into a single theory of [[quantum gravity]], a program ongoing for over half a century, have not yet been decisively resolved. The current leading candidates are [[M-theory]], [[superstring theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]].

Many [[astronomy|astronomical]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] phenomena have yet to be satisfactorily explained, including the existence of [[GZK paradox|ultra-high energy cosmic rays]], the [[baryon asymmetry]], the [[accelerating universe|acceleration of the universe]] and the [[galaxy rotation problem|anomalous rotation rates of galaxies]].

Although much progress has been made in high-energy, [[quantum]], and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving [[complex systems|complexity]], [[chaos]], or [[turbulence]] are still poorly understood. Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling [[water]], the shape of water [[droplet]]s, mechanisms of [[surface tension]] [[catastrophe theory|catastrophes]], and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections. These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, including the availability of modern [[mathematics|mathematical]] methods and [[computers]], which enabled [[complex systems]] to be modeled in new ways.  Complex physics has become part of increasingly [[interdisciplinary]] research, as exemplified by the study of [[turbulence]] in [[aerodynamics]] and the observation of [[pattern formation]] in [[biology|biological]] systems. In 1932, [[Horace Lamb]] correctly prophesied:
{{quote|''I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.''<ref>{{cite journal
