'''Milton of Balgonie's''' is a [[primary school]] in [[Glenrothes]], [[Fife, Scotland]].

Its original building was opened in 1823 with subsequent additions and extensions added in 1880,1924 & 1962. The school is situated off the bypass between [[Windygates]] and Glenrothes. The school's accommodation comprises one very large classroom where P1- P4 are taught and another classroom which accommodates P5 - P7. The original 1823 classroom now doubles as our hall and dining hall. 

The school playground is all-tarmac.  Unfortunately there are no grassy areas. A new extension has recently been built that consists of two offices, a quiet room, resources room, and a disabled toilet facility.

As of January 2007 the school has 31 pupils, 2 classrooms and disabled access.
