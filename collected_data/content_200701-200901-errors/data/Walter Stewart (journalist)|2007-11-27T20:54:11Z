'''Walter Douglas Stewart''' ([[April 19]], [[1931]] – [[September 15]], [[2004]]) was an outspoken [[Canada|Canadian]] writer, editor and journalism educator, a veteran of newspapers and magazines and author of more than twenty books, several of them bestsellers. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' reported news of his death with the headline: "He was Canada's conscience."

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Toronto]], the son of Miller Stewart and Margaret (Peg) Stewart, both [[atheism|atheists]], [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] activists and writers and [[CBC Radio]] broadcasters on nature, he was a class of [[1949]] graduate of [[London South Secondary School|London South Collegiate]] in [[London, Ontario]]. In grade 11, he and a classmate became unpaid high school reporters for the ''London Echo'' community newspaper, where they co-wrote "The Lads Who Know," a [[muckraker|muckraking]] column that criticized teaching methods. After the ''Echo'' folded, they shifted their attentions to the high school newspaper, alternating as editor-in-chief.

Stewart became an honours student in history at the [[University of Toronto]], but [[dropout|dropped out]] in [[1953]] after three years. He took a taxi the to the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'', where an editor offered him twenty-nine minutes until deadline to write up a piece on why he'd dropped out. The ''Telegram'' took him on as a reporter. He covered police and courts and wrote financial features. His time at the ''Telegram'' left him cynical about the news trade: "What I learned about journalism there was that it was a suspect craft, dominated by hypocrisy, exaggeration, and fakery. At the Tely, we toadied to advertisers, eschewed [[investigative reporting]], slanted our stories gleefully to fit the party line ([[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]]) and to appeal to the one man who counted – the publisher, [[John Frederick Bassett|John F. Bassett]]." [http://www.michenerawards.ca/english/reportwinfellow2004.htm]

==Feature writer, editor and educator==
He moved on from the ''Telegram'' to become picture editor and [[Ottawa]] correspondent for ''Star Weekly'', a magazine then published by the ''[[Toronto Star]]''. From [[1968]] to [[1977]], save a one-year interlude at the ''Star'', he worked at ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine, posted to Ottawa and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and eventually [[managing editor]] of the title. His later time at ''Maclean's'' was marked by conflict with editor [[Peter C. Newman]].

From ca. [[1988]] until [[1992]], he edited ''[[Policy Options]]'', the respected magazine of the nonpartisan [[Institute for Research on Public Policy]].

Stewart headed the journalism program at [[University of King's College]] in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], and later took the Max Bell chair in journalism at the [[University of Regina]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatchewan]]. In the [[1990s]], Stewart wrote a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] column for the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' until it was retired in a newspaper budget cut, and was a regular [[guest host]] on CBC Radio's ''[[As It Happens]]''.

==Books==
Stewart was a prolific author of books, all but two of them non-fiction.

===1970s===
Stewart's first book, ''[[Shrug: Trudeau in Power]]'' (New Press, [[1971]] and paperback, [[1972]]; released in the U.S. as ''Trudeau in Power'', Outerbridge & Dienstfrey, 1971), a sharp critique of both [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] and the [[politics of Canada|Canadian political]] and [[media in Canada|media scenes]] around him, remained on Canadian bestseller lists for more than a year. He continued writing [[exposé (journalism)|exposés]] on issues of public interest with ''Divide and Con: Canadian Politics at Work'' (New Press, [[1973]]) and ''Hard to Swallow: Why Food Prices Keep Rising and What Can Be Done About It'' ([[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan of Canada]], [[1974]]).

''But Not in Canada! Smug Canadian Myths Shattered by Harsh Reality'' ([[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan of Canada]], [[1976]], revised paperback [[1983]]) was a forceful exposition and attack on [[racism]], [[anti-immigration|anti-immigrant]] feeling and the [[far right]] in Canada which, his ''Globe'' obituary recalled nearly three decades later, "angered many."

''As They See Us'' ([[McClelland and Stewart]], [[1977]]), on [[United States-Canada relations|American perceptions of Canada]], foresaw ''[[Talking to Americans]]'', and ''Strike!'' ([[McClelland and Stewart]], [[1977]]) took an independent-minded look at [[Strike action|strike]]s and [[labor-management relations]]. ''Paper Juggernaut: Big Government Gone Mad'' ([[McClelland and Stewart]], [[1979]]) slammed public management of the [[Pickering airport]] and [[Montréal-Mirabel International Airport|Montréal-Mirabel airport]] projects.

===1980s===
''[[Towers of Gold, Feet of Clay]]: The Canadian Banks'' ([[HarperCollins|Collins]], [[1982]]; Totem, [[1983]]) was a massive success, staying on Canadian bestseller lists for more than a year. More than seventy thousand copies of his lengthy critique of the Canadian banking system were sold. The title references the [[Royal Bank Building, Toronto|Royal Bank tower in Toronto]], whose windows are covered with a [[gold]] film. The book was translated into French as ''Les géants de la finance: un dossier-choc sur l'entreprise bancaire canadienne'' (tr. by Jacques de Roussan; Inédi, 1982).

He next released ''True Blue: The Loyalist Legend'' ([[HarperCollins|Collins]], [[1985]]), on the [[United Empire Loyalists]], and ''Uneasy Lies the Head: The Truth About Canada's [[Crown corporation|Crown Corporations]]'' ([[HarperCollins|Collins]], [[1987]]). With outspoken [[Quebec]] politician [[Eric Kierans]], Stewart co-authored ''The Wrong End of the Rainbow: The Collapse of Free Enterprise in Canada'' ([[HarperCollins|Collins]], [[1988]]; [[HarperCollins|Harper & Collins]], [[1989]]).

Stewart edited ''Canadian Newspapers: The Inside Story'' (Hurtig Publishers, [[1980]]) and ''The Environment'' ([[Institute for Research on Public Policy|IRPP]], [[1988]]).

===1990s===
In the [[1990s]], Stewart's critical attention turned again to financial exposé. He released ''The Golden Fleece: Why the [[stock market|Stock Market]] Costs You Money'' ([[McClelland and Stewart]], [[1992]]), ''Belly Up: The Spoils of [[Bankruptcy]]'' ([[McClelland and Stewart]], [[1995]]) and ''Bank Heist: How our Financial Giants are Costing You Money'' (HarperCollins, [[1997]]). ''[[Too Big to Fail]]: Olympia & York: The Story Behind the Headlines'' ([[McClelland and Stewart]], [[1993]]), an ultimately sympathetic treatment of the Reichmann family and the rise and fall of their high-profile international property developer [[Olympia and York]], was probably Stewart's most widely-read title outside Canada.

A [[1996]] book on charity was Stewart's most controversial. Under threat of a [[libel]] suit, [[Douglas & McIntyre]], the [[Vancouver]]-based publishers of ''The Charity Game: Greed, Waste and Fraud in Canada's $86-Billion-a-Year Compassion Industry'', withdrew their copies from sale and asked their distributors to return all unsold copies within a few months after release. Nonetheless, the book helped spur considerable discussion on the role and governance of [[charities]].

''Dismantling the State: Downsizing to Disaster'' (Stoddart, [[1998]]) critiqued [[neoconservatism and neoliberalism in Canada]], and the haste in many quarters to cut back and [[privatization|privatize]] public services.

Stewart also wrote two lighthearted [[murder mystery|murder mysteries]], starring small-town reporter Carlton Withers and set in the [[Kawartha Lakes, Ontario|Kawartha Lakes]] region where Stewart's family had cottaged since his youth and the author lived out his own later years: ''Right Church, Wrong Pew'' ([[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan of Canada]], [[1990]]; [[McClelland and Stewart]], [[1991]]) and ''Hole in One'' ([[McClelland and Stewart]], [[1992]]).

===2000s===
In his last several years, Stewart's books retained his sharp eye and social concern but moved to a more positive pitch. ''M.J.: The Life and Times of [[Major James Coldwell|M.J. Coldwell]]'' (Stoddart, 2000), commissioned by the [[Douglas-Coldwell Foundation]], was welcomed as a long-overdue biography of the [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] parliamentarian. ''My [[Cross-Country Checkup]]: Across Canada by Minivan, Through Space and Time'' (Stoddart, 2000) presented a charming portrait of Stewart and his wife Joan retracing a trip they had taken in [[1964]] for a ''Star Weekly'' series – Joan driving, as the irascible Walter had never learned to – at the dawn of a new century.

Stewart worked again with Kierans, a longtime friend, on the politician's memoirs, ''Remembering'' (Stoddart, [[2001]]). His final book, ''The Life and Politics of [[Tommy Douglas]]'' (McArthur, [[2003]]), recounted the life of the first leader of the [[New Democratic Party]]; a [[2004]] paperback reissue, as ''The Life and Political Times of Tommy Douglas'', marked Douglas' win in the national popularity contest to name [[The Greatest Canadian]].

Stewart died at his home in [[Sturgeon Point, Ontario|Sturgeon Point]], [[Kawartha Lakes, Ontario]], of
[[cancer]].
