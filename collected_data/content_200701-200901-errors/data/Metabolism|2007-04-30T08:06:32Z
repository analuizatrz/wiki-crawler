[[Image:Metabolic pathways small.png|thumb|385px|A few of the metabolic pathways in a cell. [[metabolome#Metabolites|Metabolites]] are shown as dots and [[enzyme]] reactions as lines.]]
'''Metabolism''' is the complete set of [[chemical reaction]]s that occurs in living [[cell (biology)|cells]]. These processes are the basis of [[life]], allowing cells to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. Metabolism is usually divided into two categories. [[catabolism|Catabolic reactions]] yield energy, an example being the breakdown of food in [[cellular respiration]]. [[anabolism|Anabolic reactions]], on the other hand, use this energy to construct components of cells such as [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s.

The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into [[metabolic pathway]]s, in which one chemical is transformed to another by a sequence of [[enzyme]]s. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow cells to drive desirable but [[biological thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] unfavorable reactions by [[Coupling (physics)|coupling]] them to favorable ones. Enzymes also allow the [[Control theory|regulation]] of metabolic pathways in response to changes in the cell's environment or [[cell signaling|signals]] from other cells.

The metabolism of an organism determines which substances it will find [[nutrition|nutritious]] and which it will find [[poison]]ous. For example, some [[prokaryote]]s use [[hydrogen sulfide]] as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Friedrich C |title=Physiology and genetics of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria |journal=Adv Microb Physiol |volume=39 |issue= |pages=235-89 |year=1998 |pmid=9328649}}</ref> The speed of metabolism, the [[metabolic rate]], also influences how much food an organism will require.

A striking feature of metabolism is the similarity of the basic metabolic pathways between even vastly different species. For example, the series of chemical steps in a pathway such as the [[citric acid cycle]] is universal among living cells as diverse as the [[microorganism|unicellular]] [[bacteria]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and huge [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] organisms like [[elephant]]s.<ref name=SmithE>{{cite journal |author=Smith E, Morowitz H |title=Universality in intermediary metabolism |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=15340153 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=101 |issue=36 |pages=13168-73 |year=2004 |pmid=15340153}}</ref> This shared metabolic structure is most likely the result of the high efficiency of these pathways, and of their early appearance in evolutionary history.<ref name=Ebenhoh>{{cite journal |author=Ebenhöh O, Heinrich R |title=Evolutionary optimization of metabolic pathways.

[[Image:Trimyristin-3D-vdW.png|right|thumb|250px|Structure of a [[triacylglycerol]] lipid.]]
Most of the structures that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule: [[amino acid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lipid]]s (often called [[fat]]s). As these molecules are vital for life, metabolism focuses on making these molecules, in the construction of cells and tissues, or breaking them down and using them as a source of energy, in the digestion and use of food. Many important biochemicals can be joined together to make [[polymer]]s such as [[DNA]] and [[proteins]]. These [[macromolecules]] are essential parts of all living organisms. Some of the most common biological polymers are listed in the table below.

===Amino acids and proteins===
[[Protein]]s are made of [[amino acid]]s arranged in a linear chain and joined together by [[peptide bond]]s. Many proteins are the [[enzyme]]s that [[catalysis|catalyze]] the chemical reactions in metabolism. Other proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as the proteins in the [[cytoskeleton]] that form a system of [[scaffolding]] to maintain cell shape.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Michie K, Löwe J |title=Dynamic filaments of the bacterial cytoskeleton |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=75 |issue= |pages=467-92 |year=2006 |pmid=16756499}}</ref> Proteins are also important in [[cell signaling]], [[antibody|immune response]]s, [[cell adhesion]], [[active transport]] across membranes and the [[cell cycle]].<ref name=Nelson>{{cite book | last = Nelson | first = David L. | coauthors = Michael M.

===Lipids===
[[Lipid]]s are the most diverse group of biochemicals. Their main structural uses are as part of [[biological membrane]]s such as the [[cell membrane]], or as a source of energy.<ref name=Nelson/> Lipids are usually defined as [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] or [[amphiphiles|amphipathic]] biological molecules that will dissolve in [[organic solvent]]s such as [[benzene]] or [[chloroform]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fahy E, Subramaniam S, Brown H, Glass C, Merrill A, Murphy R, Raetz C, Russell D, Seyama Y, Shaw W, Shimizu T, Spener F, van Meer G, VanNieuwenhze M, White S, Witztum J, Dennis E |title=A comprehensive classification system for lipids |url=http://www.jlr.org/cgi/content/full/46/5/839 |journal=J Lipid Res |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=839-61 |year=2005 |pmid=15722563}}</ref> The [[fat]]s are a large group of compounds that contain [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid [[ester]]s is a [[triglyceride|triacylglyceride]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Nomenclature of Lipids |publisher=IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN) | url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/lipid/ |accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref> Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as [[sphingosine]] in the [[sphingolipid]]s, and [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] groups such as [[phosphate]] in [[phospholipid]]s. [[Steroid]]s such as [[cholesterol]] are another major class of lipids that are made in cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hegardt F |title=Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase: a control enzyme in ketogenesis |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1220089&blobtype=pdf |journal=Biochem J |volume=338 (Pt 3) |issue= |pages=569-82 |year=1999 |pmid=10051425}}</ref>

===Carbohydrates===
[[Image:Glucose Fisher to Haworth.gif|thumb|230px|right||[[Glucose]] can exist in both a straight-chain and ring form.]]
[[Carbohydrate]]s are straight-chain [[aldehyde]]s or [[ketone]]s with many [[hydroxyl]] groups that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates are the most abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of [[energy]] ([[starch]], [[glycogen]]) and structural components ([[cellulose]] in plants, [[chitin]] in animals).<ref name=Nelson/> The basic carbohydrate units are called [[monosaccharide]]s and include [[galactose]], [[fructose]], and most importantly [[glucose]]. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form [[polysaccharide]]s in almost limitless ways.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Raman R, Raguram S, Venkataraman G, Paulson J, Sasisekharan R |title=Glycomics: an integrated systems approach to structure-function relationships of glycans |journal=Nat Methods |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=817-24 |year=2005 |pmid=16278650}}</ref>

===Nucleotides===
The polymers [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] are long chains of [[nucleotide]]s. These molecules are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, through the processes of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[protein biosynthesis]].<ref name=Nelson/> This information is protected by [[DNA repair]] mechanisms and propagated through [[DNA replication]]. A few [[virus]]es have an RNA genome, for example [[HIV]], which uses [[reverse transcription]] to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sierra S, Kupfer B, Kaiser R |title=Basics of the virology of HIV-1 and its replication |journal=J Clin Virol |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=233-44 |year=2005 |pmid=16198625}}</ref> RNA in [[ribozyme]]s such as [[spliceosome]]s and [[ribosome]]s is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual [[nucleoside]]s are made by attaching a [[nucleobase]] to a [[ribose]] sugar. These bases are [[heterocyclic]] rings containing nitrogen, classified as [[purines]] or [[pyrimidines]]. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic group transfer reactions.<ref name=Wimmer>{{cite journal |author=Wimmer M, Rose I |title=Mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed group transfer reactions |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=47 |issue= |pages=1031-78 |year=1978 |pmid=354490}}</ref>

===Coenzymes===
[[Image:ATP-3D-vdW.png|thumb|right|250px|Structure of the [[coenzyme]] [[adenosine triphosphate]].]]
Metabolism involves a vast array of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of [[functional group|group transfer reaction]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mitchell P |title=The Ninth Sir Hans Krebs Lecture.

Each class of group-transfer reaction is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously being made, consumed and then recycled.<ref name=Dimroth>{{cite journal |author=Dimroth P, von Ballmoos C, Meier T |title=Catalytic and mechanical cycles in F-ATP synthases.

The most central coenzyme is [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This [[nucleotide]] is used to transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There is only a small amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day.<ref name=Dimroth/> ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism, with catabolic reactions generating ATP and anabolic reactions consuming it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in [[phosphorylation]] reactions.

A [[vitamin]] is an organic compound needed in small quantities that cannot be made in the cells. In human [[nutrition]], most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Coulston | first1 = Ann | last2 = Kerner | first2 = John | last3 = Hattner | first3 = JoAnn | last4 = Srivastava | first4 = Ashini | contribution = Nutrition Principles and Clinical Nutrition | title = Stanford School of Medicine Nutrition Courses | publisher = SUMMIT | year = 2006 }}</ref> [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NADH), a derivative of vitamin B<sub>3</sub> ([[niacin]]), is an important coenzyme that acts as a hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of [[dehydrogenase]]s remove electrons from their substrates and [[redox|reduce]] NAD<sup>+</sup> into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the [[reductase]]s in the cell that need to reduce their substrates.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pollak N, Dölle C, Ziegler M |title=The power to reduce: pyridine nucleotides--small molecules with a multitude of functions |journal=Biochem J |volume=402 |issue=2 |pages=205-18 |year=2007 |pmid=17295611}}</ref> Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.

===Minerals and cofactors===
{{further|[[Physiology]], [[bioinorganic chemistry]] and [[Human iron metabolism|iron metabolism]]}}
Inorganic elements play critical roles in metabolism; some are abundant (e.g. [[sodium]] and [[potassium]]) while others function at minute concentrations. About 99% of mammals' mass are the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]], [[chlorine]], [[potassium]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]] and [[sulfur]].<ref name=Heymsfield>{{cite journal |author=Heymsfield S, Waki M, Kehayias J, Lichtman S, Dilmanian F, Kamen Y, Wang J, Pierson R |title=Chemical and elemental analysis of humans in vivo using improved body composition models |journal=Am J Physiol |volume=261 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=E190-8 |year=1991 |pmid=1872381}}</ref> The [[organic compound]]s (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen and most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.<ref name=Heymsfield/>

The abundant inorganic elements act as [[ion]]ic [[electrolyte]]s.

== Catabolism ==
{{further|[[Catabolism]]}}
Catabolism is the set of metabolic processes that release energy. These include breaking down and oxidising food molecules as well as reactions that trap the energy in sunlight. The purpose of these catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, with organic molecules being used as a source of energy in [[organotroph]]s, while [[lithotroph]]s use inorganic substrates and [[phototroph]]s capture [[sunlight]] as [[potential energy#Chemical energy|chemical energy]]. However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on [[redox]] reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as [[organic molecule]]s, [[water]], [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen sulfide]] or [[Ferrous|ferrous ions]] to acceptor molecules such as [[oxygen]], [[nitrate]] or [[sulphate]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nealson K, Conrad P |title=Life: past, present and future |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=10670014 |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=354 |issue=1392 |pages=1923-39 |year=1999 |pmid=10670014}}</ref> In animals these reactions involve complex [[organic molecule]]s being broken down to simpler molecules, such as [[carbon dioxide]] and water. In [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms such as plants and [[cyanobacteria]], these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy, but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.<ref name=Nelson>{{cite journal |author=Nelson N, Ben-Shem A |title=The complex architecture of oxygenic photosynthesis |journal=Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=971-82 |year=2004 |pmid=15573135}}</ref>

The most common set of catabolic reactions in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first, large organic molecules such as [[protein]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s or [[lipid]]s are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to yet smaller molecules, usually [[coenzyme A|acetyl coenzyme A]], which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the coenzyme A is oxidised to water and carbon dioxide, releasing energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD<sup>+</sup>) into NADH.

===Digestion===
{{further|[[Digestion]] and [[gastrointestinal tract]]}}
Macromolecules such as starch, cellulose or proteins cannot be rapidly taken up by cells and need to be broken into their smaller units before they can be used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These digestive enzymes include [[protease]]s that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as [[glycoside hydrolase]]s that digest polysaccharides into monosaccharides.

Microbes simply secrete digestive enzymes into their surroundings,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Häse C, Finkelstein R |title=Bacterial extracellular zinc-containing metalloproteases |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=8302217 |journal=Microbiol Rev |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=823-37 |year=1993 |pmid=8302217}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gupta R, Gupta N, Rathi P |title=Bacterial lipases: an overview of production, purification and biochemical properties |journal=Appl Microbiol Biotechnol |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=763-81 |year=2004 |pmid=14966663}}</ref> while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their [[gut]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoyle T |title=The digestive system: linking theory and practice |journal=Br J Nurs |volume=6 |issue=22 |pages=1285-91 |year=1997 |pmid=9470654}}</ref> The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by specific [[active transport]] proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Souba W, Pacitti A |title=How amino acids get into cells: mechanisms, models, menus, and mediators |journal=JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=569-78 |year=1992 |pmid=1494216}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Barrett M, Walmsley A, Gould G |title=Structure and function of facilitative sugar transporters |journal=Curr Opin Cell Biol |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=496-502 |year=1999 |pmid=10449337}}</ref>

Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD<sup>+</sup> as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases [[carbon dioxide]] as a waste product. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the [[pentose phosphate pathway]], which reduces the coenzyme [[NADPH]] and produces [[pentose]] sugars such as [[ribose]], the sugar component of [[nucleic acid]]s.

Fats are catabolised by [[hydrolysis]] to free fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by [[beta oxidation]] to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Due to their high proportion of [[methylene]] groups, fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates, as carbohydrates such as glucose contain more oxygen in their structures.

[[Amino acid]]s are either used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to [[urea]] and carbon dioxide as a source of energy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sakami W, Harrington H |title=Amino acid metabolism |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=32 |issue= |pages=355-98 |year=1963 |pmid=14144484}}</ref> The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a [[transaminase]].

In oxidative phosphorylation, the electrons removed from food molecules in pathways such as the citric acid cycle are transferred to oxygen and the energy released used to make ATP. This is done in [[eukaryote]]s by a series of proteins in the membranes of mitochondria called the [[electron transport chain]]. In [[prokaryote]]s, these proteins are found in the cell's [[bacterial cell structure|inner membrane]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hosler J, Ferguson-Miller S, Mills D |title=Energy transduction: proton transfer through the respiratory complexes |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=75 |issue= |pages=165-87 |year=2006 |pmid=16756489}}</ref> These proteins use the energy released from oxidising the electron-carrying coenzyme NADH to pump [[proton]]s across the membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schultz B, Chan S |title=Structures and proton-pumping strategies of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes |journal=Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct |volume=30 |issue= |pages=23-65 |year=2001 |pmid=11340051}}</ref>

===Energy from light===
{{further|[[Phototroph]], [[photophosphorylation]], [[chloroplast]]}}

The energy in sunlight is captured by [[plants]], [[cyanobacteria]], [[purple bacteria]], [[green sulfur bacteria]] and some [[protist]]s. This process is often coupled to the conversion of carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight as a source of energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van der Meer M, Schouten S, Bateson M, Nübel U, Wieland A, Kühl M, de Leeuw J, Sinninghe Damsté J, Ward D |title=Diel variations in carbon metabolism by green nonsulfur-like bacteria in alkaline siliceous hot spring microbial mats from Yellowstone National Park |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=16000812 |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=71 |issue=7 |pages=3978-86 |year=2005 |pmid=16000812}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tichi M, Tabita F |title=Interactive control of Rhodobacter capsulatus redox-balancing systems during phototrophic metabolism |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=11591679 |journal=J Bacteriol |volume=183 |issue=21 |pages=6344-54 |year=2001 |pmid=11591679}}</ref>

The capture of solar energy is a process that is similar in principle to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves energy being stored as a proton concentration gradient and this proton motive force then driving ATP synthesis.<ref name=Dimroth/> The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called [[photosynthetic reaction centre]]s. These structures are classed into two types depending on the type of [[photosynthetic pigment]] present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type of reaction center, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Allen J, Williams J |title=Photosynthetic reaction centers |journal=FEBS Lett |volume=438 |issue=1-2 |pages=5-9 |year=1998 |pmid=9821949}}</ref>

In plants, [[photosystem|photosystem II]] uses light energy to remove electrons from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then flow to the [[cytochrome b6f complex]], which uses their energy to pump protons across the [[thylakoid]] membrane in the [[chloroplast]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nelson N, Ben-Shem A |title=The complex architecture of oxygenic photosynthesis |journal=Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=971-82 |year=2004 |pmid=15573135}}</ref> These protons move back through them membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through [[photosystem|photosystem I]] and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP<sup>+</sup>, for use in the [[Calvin cycle]] which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Munekage Y, Hashimoto M, Miyake C, Tomizawa K, Endo T, Tasaka M, Shikanai T |title=Cyclic electron flow around photosystem I is essential for photosynthesis |journal=Nature |volume=429 |issue=6991 |pages=579-82 |year=2004 |pmid=15175756}}</ref>

== Anabolism ==
{{further|[[Anabolism]]}}

'''Anabolism''' is the set of constructive metabolic processes where the energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. Firstly, the production of precursors such as [[amino acid]]s, [[monosaccharide]]s, [[Terpenoid|isoprenoids]] and [[nucleotide]]s, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as [[protein]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, [[lipid]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s.

Organisms differ in how many of the molecules in their cells they can construct for themselves. [[Autotroph]]s such as plants can construct the complex organic molecules in cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like [[carbon dioxide]] and water. [[Heterotroph]]s, on the other hand, require a source of more complex substances, such as monosaccharides and amino acids, to produce these complex molecules. Organisms can be further classified by ultimate source of their energy: photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from light, whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation reactions.

===Carbon fixation===
{{further|[[Photosynthesis]], [[carbon fixation]] and [[chemosynthesis]]}}
[[Image:Chloroplasten.jpg|frame|Plant cells (bounded by purple walls) filled with chloroplasts (green), which are the site of photosynthesis.]]

Photosynthesis is the synthesis of glucose from sunlight, [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the [[photosynthetic reaction centre]]s, as described above, to convert CO<sub>2</sub> into [[glycerate 3-phosphate]], which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is carried out by the enzyme [[RuBisCO]] as part of the [[Calvin cycle|Calvin &ndash; Benson cycle]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miziorko H, Lorimer G |title=Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=52 |issue= |pages=507-35 |year=1983 |pmid=6351728}}</ref> Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, [[C3 carbon fixation]], [[C4 carbon fixation]] and [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM photosynthesis]]. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO<sub>2</sub> directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO<sub>2</sub> into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dodd A, Borland A, Haslam R, Griffiths H, Maxwell K |title=Crassulacean acid metabolism: plastic, fantastic |url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/53/369/569 |journal=J Exp Bot |volume=53 |issue=369 |pages=569-80 |year=2002 |pmid=11886877}}</ref>

===Carbohydrates and glycans===
{{further|[[Gluconeogenesis]], [[glyoxylate cycle]], [[glycogenesis]] and [[glycosylation]]}}

In carbohydrate anabolism, simple organic acids can be converted into [[monosaccharide]]s such as [[glucose]] and then used to assemble [[polysaccharide]]s such as [[starch]]. The generation of [[glucose]] from compounds like [[pyruvate]], [[lactate]], [[glycerol]], [[glycerate 3-phosphate]] and [[amino acids]] is called [[gluconeogenesis]]. Gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to [[glucose-6-phosphate]] through a series of intermediates, many of which are shared with [[glycolysis]].<ref name=Bouche/> However, this pathway is not simply [[glycolysis]] run in reverse, as several steps are catalyzed by non-glycolytic enzymes. This is important as it allows the formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in a [[futile cycle]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boiteux A, Hess B |title=Design of glycolysis |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=293 |issue=1063 |pages=5-22 |year=1981 |pmid=6115423}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pilkis S, el-Maghrabi M, Claus T |title=Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in control of hepatic gluconeogenesis.

Although fat is a common way of storing energy, in [[vertebrate]]s such as [[human]]s the [[fatty acid]]s in these stores cannot be converted to glucose through [[gluconeogenesis]] as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into [[pyruvate]].<ref name=Ensign>{{cite journal |author=Ensign S |title=Revisiting the glyoxylate cycle: alternate pathways for microbial acetate assimilation |journal=Mol Microbiol |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=274-6 |year=2006 |pmid=16856935}}</ref> As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce [[ketone bodies]] from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize fatty acids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Finn P, Dice J |title=Proteolytic and lipolytic responses to starvation |journal=Nutrition |volume=22 |issue=7-8 |pages=830-44 |year= |pmid=16815497}}</ref> In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the [[glyoxylate cycle]], which bypasses the [[decarboxylation]] step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to [[oxaloacetate]], where it can be used for the production of glucose.<ref name=Kornberg>{{cite journal |author=Kornberg H, Krebs H |title=Synthesis of cell constituents from C2-units by a modified tricarboxylic acid cycle |journal=Nature |volume=179 |issue=4568 |pages=988-91 |year=1957 |pmid=13430766}}</ref><ref name=Ensign/>

Polysaccharides and [[glycans]] are made by the sequential addition of monosaccharides by [[glycosyltransferase]] from a reactive sugar-phosphate donor such as [[uridine diphosphate glucose]] (UDP-glucose) to an acceptor [[hydroxyl]] group on the growing polysaccharide.

Fatty acids are made by [[fatty acid synthase]]s that polymerize and reduce acetyl-CoA units.

Organisms vary in their ability to synthesize the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can synthesize only the ten nonessential amino acids.<ref name=Nelson/> Thus, the [[essential amino acid]]s must be obtained from food. All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by [[glutamate]] and [[glutamine]]. Amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then [[Transaminase|transaminated]] to form an amino acid.<ref>{{cite book | last = Guyton | first = Arthur C. | coauthors = John E.

Amino acids are made into proteins by being joined together in a chain by [[peptide bond]]s. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its [[primary structure]]. Just as the letters of the alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a [[transfer RNA]] molecule through an [[ester]] bond.

In [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] terms, metabolism maintains order by creating disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Demirel Y, Sandler S |title=Thermodynamics and bioenergetics |journal=Biophys Chem |volume=97 |issue=2-3 |pages=87-111 |year=2002 |pmid=12050002}}</ref>

==Regulation and control==
{{further|[[Metabolic pathway]], [[metabolic control analysis]], [[hormone]] and [[cell signaling]]}}
As the environments of most organisms are constantly changing, the reactions of metabolism must be finely [[Control theory|regulated]] to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called [[homeostasis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Albert R |title=Scale-free networks in cell biology |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/118/21/4947 |journal=J Cell Sci |volume=118 |issue=Pt 21 |pages=4947-57 |year=2005 |pmid=16254242}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brand M |title=Regulation analysis of energy metabolism |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/200/2/193 |journal=J Exp Biol |volume=200 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=193-202 |year=1997 |pmid=9050227}}</ref> Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Soyer O, Salathé M, Bonhoeffer S |title=Signal transduction networks: topology, response and biochemical processes |journal=J Theor Biol |volume=238 |issue=2 |pages=416-25 |year=2006 |pmid=16045939}}</ref> Two closely-linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the ''regulation'' of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the ''control'' exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the [[flux]] through the pathway).<ref name=Salter>{{cite journal |author=Salter M, Knowles R, Pogson C |title=Metabolic control |journal=Essays Biochem |volume=28 |issue= |pages=1-12 |year=1994 |pmid=7925313}}</ref> For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (''i.e.'' it is highly regulated) but if these changes have little effect on the flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Westerhoff H, Groen A, Wanders R |title=Modern theories of metabolic control and their applications (review) |journal=Biosci Rep |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1-22 |year=1984 |pmid=6365197}}</ref>
[[Image:Insulin_glucose_metabolism_ZP.svg|right|thumbnail|400px|'''Effect of insulin on glucose uptake and metabolism.''' Insulin binds to its receptor (1) which in turn starts many protein activation cascades (2). These include: translocation of Glut-4 transporter to the [[plasma membrane]] and influx of glucose (3), [[glycogen]] synthesis (4), [[glycolysis]] (5) and [[fatty acid]] synthesis (6).]]

There are multiple levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates to respond to changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the [[flux]] through the pathway to compensate.<ref name=Salter/> This type of regulation often involves [[allosteric regulation]] of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fell D, Thomas S |title=Physiological control of metabolic flux: the requirement for multisite modulation |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=7575476 |journal=Biochem J |volume=311 (Pt 1) |issue= |pages=35-9 |year=1995 |pmid=7575476}}</ref> Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as [[hormone]]s and [[growth factor]]s and are detected by specific [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on the cell surface.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hendrickson W |title=Transduction of biochemical signals across cell membranes |journal=Q Rev Biophys |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=321-30 |year=2005 |pmid=16600054}}</ref> These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by [[second messenger system]]s that often involved the [[phosphorylation]] of proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohen P |title=The regulation of protein function by multisite phosphorylation--a 25 year update |journal=Trends Biochem Sci |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=596-601 |year=2000 |pmid=11116185}}</ref>

A very well understood example of extrinsic control is the regulation of glucose metabolism by the hormone [[insulin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lienhard G, Slot J, James D, Mueckler M |title=How cells absorb glucose |journal=Sci Am |volume=266 |issue=1 |pages=86-91 |year=1992 |pmid=1734513}}</ref> Insulin is produced in response to rises in [[blood sugar|blood glucose levels]]. Binding of the hormone to [[insulin receptor]]s on cells then activates a cascade of [[protein kinase]]s that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and [[glycogen]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roach P |title=Glycogen and its metabolism |journal=Curr Mol Med |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=101-20 |year=2002 |pmid=11949930}}</ref> The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of [[phosphorylase]], the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and [[glycogen synthase]], the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating [[phosphatase|protein phosphatase]]s and producing a decrease in the phosphorylation of these enzymes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Newgard C, Brady M, O'Doherty R, Saltiel A |title=Organizing glucose disposal: emerging roles of the glycogen targeting subunits of protein phosphatase-1 |url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/reprint/49/12/1967.pdf |journal=Diabetes |volume=49 |issue=12 |pages=1967-77 |year=2000 |pmid=11117996}}</ref>

==Evolution==
{{further|[[Molecular evolution]] and [[Phylogenetics]]}}
[[image:Phylogenetic_tree.svg|thumb|left|350px|A phylogenetic tree based on [[rRNA]] data, showing the divergence of [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukaryote]]s from a common ancestor.]]
The central pathways of metabolism described above, such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are present in all [[Three-domain system|three domains]] of living things and were present in the [[last universal ancestor]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Romano A, Conway T |title=Evolution of carbohydrate metabolic pathways |journal=Res Microbiol |volume=147 |issue=6-7 |pages=448-55 |year= |pmid=9084754}}</ref><ref name=SmithE/> This universal ancestral cell was [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] and probably a [[methanogen]] that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koch A |title=How did bacteria come to be? |journal=Adv Microb Physiol |volume=40 |issue= |pages=353-99 |year=1998 |pmid=9889982}} {{cite journal |author=Ouzounis C, Kyrpides N |title=The emergence of major cellular processes in evolution |journal=FEBS Lett |volume=390 |issue=2 |pages=119-23 |year=1996 |pmid=8706840}}</ref> The retention of these ancient pathways during later [[evolution]] may be the result of these reactions being an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps.<ref name=Ebenhoh/><ref name=Cascante/>

Many models have been proposed to describe the mechanisms by which novel metabolic pathways evolve. These include the sequential addition of novel enzymes to a short ancestral pathway, the duplication and then divergence of entire pathways as well as the recruitment of pre-existing enzymes and their assembly into a novel reaction pathway.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmidt S, Sunyaev S, Bork P, Dandekar T |title=Metabolites: a helping hand for pathway evolution? |journal=Trends Biochem Sci |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=336-41 |year=2003 |pmid=12826406}}</ref> The relative importance of these mechanisms is unclear, but genomic studies have shown that enzymes in a pathway are likely to have a shared ancestry, suggesting that many pathways have evolved in a step-by-step fashion with novel functions being created from pre-existing steps in the pathway.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Light S, Kraulis P |title=Network analysis of metabolic enzyme evolution in Escherichia coli |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=5 |issue= |pages=15 |year= |pmid=15113413}} {{cite journal |author=Alves R, Chaleil R, Sternberg M |title=Evolution of enzymes in metabolism: a network perspective |journal=J Mol Biol |volume=320 |issue=4 |pages=751-70 |year=2002 |pmid=12095253}}</ref> Another possibility is that some parts of metabolism might exist as "modules" that can be reused in different pathways and perform similar functions on different molecules.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Spirin V, Gelfand M, Mironov A, Mirny L |title=A metabolic network in the evolutionary context: multiscale structure and modularity |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=16731630 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=103 |issue=23 |pages=8774-9 |year=2006 |pmid=16731630}}</ref>

The evolution of organisms can also produce the loss of metabolic pathways. For example, in some [[parasite]]s metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the [[host (biology)|host]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lawrence J |title=Common themes in the genome strategies of pathogens |journal=Curr Opin Genet Dev |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=584-8 |year=2005 |pmid=16188434}} {{cite journal |author=Wernegreen J |title=For better or worse: genomic consequences of intracellular mutualism and parasitism |journal=Curr Opin Genet Dev |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=572-83 |year=2005 |pmid=16230003}}</ref> Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] organisms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pál C, Papp B, Lercher M, Csermely P, Oliver S, Hurst L |title=Chance and necessity in the evolution of minimal metabolic networks |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7084 |pages=667-70 |year=2006 |pmid=16572170}}</ref>

==Investigation and manipulation==
{{further|[[Protein methods]], [[proteomics]], [[metabolomics]] and [[metabolic network modelling]]}}
[[Image:A thaliana metabolic network.png|thumb|300px|right|[[Metabolic network]] of the ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' [[citric acid cycle]]. [[Enzyme]]s and [[metabolomics|metabolite]]s are shown as red squares and the interactions between them as black lines.]]

Classically, metabolism is studied by a [[reductionism|reductionist]] approach that focuses on a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable is the use of [[radioactive tracer]]s at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively-labelled intermediates and products.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rennie M |title=An introduction to the use of tracers in nutrition and metabolism |journal=Proc Nutr Soc |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=935-44 |year=1999 |pmid=10817161}}</ref> The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be [[protein purification|purified]] and their [[enzyme kinetics|kinetics]] and responses to [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]] investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the [[metabolome]]. Overall, these studies give a good view of the structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phair R |title=Development of kinetic models in the nonlinear world of molecular cell biology |journal=Metabolism |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=1489-95 |year=1997 |pmid=9439549}}</ref>

An idea of the complexity of the [[metabolic network]]s in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sterck L, Rombauts S, Vandepoele K, Rouzé P, Van de Peer Y |title=How many genes are there in plants (... and why are they there)? |journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=199-203 |year=2007 |pmid=17289424}}</ref> However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more [[Holism|holistic]] mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Borodina I, Nielsen J |title=From genomes to in silico cells via metabolic networks |journal=Curr Opin Biotechnol |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=350-5 |year=2005 |pmid=15961036}}</ref> These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on [[gene expression]] from [[proteomics|proteomic]] and [[DNA microarray]] studies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gianchandani E, Brautigan D, Papin J |title=Systems analyses characterize integrated functions of biochemical networks |journal=Trends Biochem Sci |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=284-91 |year=2006 |pmid=16616498}}</ref>

A major technological application of this information is [[metabolic engineering]]. Here, organisms such as [[yeast]], [[plant]]s or [[bacteria]] are genetically-modified to make them more useful in [[biotechnology]] and aid the production of [[drug]]s such as [[antibiotic]]s or industrial chemicals such as [[1,3-Propanediol|1,3-propanediol]] and [[shikimic acid]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thykaer J, Nielsen J |title=Metabolic engineering of beta-lactam production |journal=Metab Eng |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=56-69 |year=2003 |pmid=12749845}}

[[Image:SantoriosMeal.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Santorio Santorio]] in his steelyard balance, from ''Ars de statica medecina'', first published 1614]]
The term ''metabolism'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Μεταβολισμός &ndash; "Metabolismos" for "change", or "overthrow".<ref>{{cite web | title=Metabolism |publisher=The Online Etymology Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=metabolism |accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref> The history of the scientific study of metabolism spans 400 years and has moved from examining whole animals in early studies, to examining individual metabolic reactions in modern biochemistry. The first controlled experiments in human metabolism were published by [[Santorio Santorio]] in [[1614]] in his book ''Ars de statica medecina''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eknoyan G |title=Santorio Sanctorius (1561-1636) - founding father of metabolic balance studies |journal=Am J Nephrol |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=226-33 |year=1999 |pmid=10213823}}</ref> He described how he weighed himself before and after eating, sleeping, working, sex, fasting, drinking, and excreting. He found that most of the food he took in was lost through what he called "insensible perspiration".

In these early studies, the mechanisms of these metabolic processes had not been identified and a [[vitalism|vital force]] was thought to animate living tissue.<ref>Williams, H. S.

It was the discovery of [[enzyme]]s at the beginning of the 20th century by [[Eduard Buchner]] that separated the study of the chemical reactions of metabolism from the biological study of cells, and marked the beginnings of [[biochemistry]].<ref>Eduard Buchner's 1907 [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1907/buchner-lecture.html Nobel lecture] at http://nobelprize.org Accessed 2007-03-20</ref> The mass of biochemical knowledge grew rapidly throughout the early 20th century. One of the most prolific of these modern biochemists was [[Hans Adolf Krebs|Hans Krebs]] who made huge contributions to the study of metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kornberg H |title=Krebs and his trinity of cycles |journal=Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=225-8 |year=2000 |pmid=11252898}}</ref> He discovered the urea cycle and later, working with [[Hans Kornberg]], the citric acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle.<ref>Krebs H A, Henseleit K (1932) "Untersuchungen über die Harnstoffbildung im tierkorper."
