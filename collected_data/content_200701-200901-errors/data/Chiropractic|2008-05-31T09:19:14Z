{{Alternative medical systems}}
'''Chiropractic''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chiro-'' χειρο- "hand-" + ''praktikós'' πρακτικός "concerned with action") is a [[complementary and alternative medicine]] [[health care profession]] that focuses on [[diagnosis]], [[treatment]] and prevention of [[mechanical]] disorders of the [[musculoskeletal]] system and the effects of these disorders on the functions of the [[nervous system]] and general health. It emphasizes [[manual therapy]] including [[spinal adjustment]] and other joint and [[soft-tissue]] manipulation.<ref name=ccestandards/> Traditionally, it is based on the premise that a [[vertebral subluxation]] or [[Vertebral column|spinal joint]] dysfunction can interfere with the nervous system and result in many different conditions of diminished health. Today, this alternative form of therapy examines the relationship between structure and function and its impact on neurological mechanisms in both health and disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/chiropractic/ |title= An introduction to chiropractic |author= [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] |date=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://acatoday.net/level2_css.cfm?T1ID=13&T2ID=62 |title= A history of chiropractic care |author= [[American Chiropractic Association]] |accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/back-pain/guide/chiropractic-care-and-back-pain |title=Chiropractic Care and Back Pain |accessdate=2008-02-25 |date=2008-02-24 |work=WebMD |publisher=WebMD LLC}}</ref>

Chiropractors usually obtain one of the following equivalent [[first professional degree]]s in chiropractic medicine (D.C. or D.C.M. or B.Chiro or M.Chiro). Chiropractors use a combination of treatments that are predicated on the specific needs of the individual patient. A chiropractor can develop and carry out a comprehensive treatment and management plan that can include [[spinal adjustment]]s, [[soft tissue therapy]], prescription of exercises, and health and lifestyle counseling.<ref name=OCA>{{cite web |url=http://chiropractic.on.ca/ChiropracticCare/WhatisChiropractic.aspx |title=What is chiropractic? |publisher=Ontario Chiropractic Association |accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref>

Chiropractors have historically fallen into two main groups, "straights" and "mixers"; both have had off-shoots.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/><ref name=History-PPC/> Significant differences regarding [[Scope of Practice|scope of practice]], claims made about spinal manipulation, and beliefs regarding professional integration, differentiate the various schools of thought and practice styles held within the profession.<ref name=Healey/> There have been internal conflicts that exist to this day.<ref name=Ernst-2008/> Traditional and evidence-based chiropractic beliefs range from vitalism to materialism.<ref name=Keating05/>

The utilization of chiropractic has increased in popularity.<ref name=Lawrence-Meeker/> The profession has remained unified with a continuous committment to clinical care. Chiropractic's greatest contribution to health care may be its patient-physician relationship and hands-on treatment. Patients are usually satisfied with the treatment they received.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/>

The principles of [[evidence-based medicine]] has grown in prominence and have been used to review research studies and generate practice guidelines.<ref name=Villanueva-Russell/> The efficacy of chiropractic treatment has not been rigorously proven.<ref name=DeVocht/> Chiropractic care is generally safe when employed skillfully and appropriately.<ref name=WHO-guidelines/> The cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care is unknown.<ref name=Leboeuf-Yde-C/> Vaccination remains controversial within the chiropractic community.<ref name=Busse/>

Traditional and evidence-based chiropractic belief systems vary along a philosophical spectrum ranging from [[vitalism]] to [[materialism]].  These opposing philosophies have been a source of debate since the time of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. Vitalism, the belief that living things contain an element that cannot be explained through matter, was responsible for legally and philosophically differentiating chiropractic from conventional medicine and thereby helping ensure professional autonomy.<ref name=Keating05>{{cite book |author= Keating JC Jr |chapter= Philosophy in chiropractic |pages=77–98 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref> Chiropractic also retains elements of materialism, the belief that all things have explanations, which forms the basis of [[science]]. Evidence-based chiropractic balances this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] by emphasizing both the tangible, testable principle that structure affects function, and the untestable, metaphorical recognition that life is self-sustaining.<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/>

The chiropractor's purpose is to foster the establishment and maintenance of an organism-environment dynamic that is the most conducive to functional well-being of the person as a whole.<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/> Principles such as [[holism]], [[naturalism]], therapeutic conservatism, [[critical rationalism]], and thoughts from the [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] and [[humanistic]] paradigms form an important part of the philosophy of chiropractic."<ref name=Phillips-PPC>{{cite book |author= Phillips RB |chapter= The evolution of vitalism and materialism and its impact on philosophy |pages=65–76 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref>

Chiropractors can adopt or share vitalist, [[naturalist]], or materialist viewpoints and emphasize a [[holistic]], patient-centered approach that appreciates the multifactorial nature of influences (i.e. structural, chemical, and psychological) on the functioning of the body in health and disease and recognizes the dynamics and interplay between lifestyle, environment, and health.  This holistic paradigm is also blended with a [[biopsychosocial]] approach, which is also emphasized in chiropractic care. In addition, chiropractors also retain [[naturopathic]] and naturalist principles that suggest decreased "host resistance" of the body facilitates the disease process and that natural interventions are preferable towards strengthening the host in its effort to optimize function and return to [[homeostasis]].<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/> Chiropractic care primarily emphasizes manipulation and other manual therapies as an alternative than medications and surgery.<ref>{{cite book |editor= Mootz RD, Hansen DT |title= Chiropractic technologies |publisher= Jones & Bartlett |date=1999 |isbn=0834213737 |author= Hansen DT, Mootz RD |chapter= Formal processes in health care technology assessment: a primer for the chiropractic profession |pages=3–17}}</ref>

Chiropractors also commonly use nutrition, exercise, patient education, health promotion and lifestyle counseling as part of their holistic outlook towards preventive health care.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |date=2000 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |title= A survey of practice patterns and the health promotion and prevention attitudes of US chiropractors, maintenance care: part I |author= Rupert RL |doi=10.1016/S0161-4754(00)90107-6 |pmid=10658870}}</ref> Chiropractic's claim to improve health by improving biomechanical and neural function by the manual correction of joint and soft tissue dysfunctions of the neuromusculoskeletal system differentiates it from mainstream medicine and other complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) disciplines, but is also rooted, in part, in [[osteopathy]] and eastern medicine interventions.<ref name=Phillips-PPC/> All chiropractic paradigms emphasize the spine as their focus, but their rationales for treatment vary depending on their particular belief system.

The philosophy of chiropractic also stresses the importance of [[Prevention (medical)|prevention]] and primarily utilizes a pro-active approach and a [[wellness]] model to achieve this goal.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |date=2000 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=10–9 |title= Maintenance care: health promotion services administered to US chiropractic patients aged 65 and older, part II |author= Rupert RL, Manello D, Sandefur R |doi=10.1016/S0161-4754(00)90108-8 |pmid=10658871}}</ref> For some, prevention includes a concept of "maintenance care" that attempts to "detect and correct" structural imbalances of the neuromusculoskeletal system while in its primary, or [[functional]] state.<ref>{{cite web |author= Canadian Chiropractic Association |title= Glenerin guidelines: preventive maintenance care |url=http://www.ccachiro.org/client/cca/cca.nsf/web/Chapter+14+-+Preventative-Maintenance+Care!OpenDocument |date=1996 |accessdate=2008-02-26}}</ref> The objective is early identification of mechanical dysfunctions to prevent or delay permanent pathological changes.<ref>{{cite book |author= Vear HJ |editor= Vear HJ (ed.) |chapter= Scope of chiropractic practice |title= Chiropractic Standards of Practice and Quality of Care |location= Gaithersburg, MD |publisher=Aspen |date=1992 |oclc=23972994 |pages=49–68}}</ref>

''Straight'' chiropractors are the oldest movement.<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl= |chapter= |author=Saul F. Rosenthal |date=1987 |title=A Sociology of Chiropractic |pages= |editor= |url= |format= |accessdate= |version= |location= |publisher=Edwin Mellen Pr |oclc=}}</ref> They adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by D. D. and B. J. Palmer, and retain [[metaphysical]] definitions and [[vitalistic]] qualities. Straight chiropractors believe that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an [[Innate intelligence]] within the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for almost any disease. Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the "secondary effects" of subluxations) to be unnecessary for treatment. Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not "mix" other types of therapies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Keating |first=Joseph C. |coauthors= Carl S. Cleveland, Michael Menke |title=Chiropractic History: a Primer |publisher=Association For The History Of Chiropractic |year=2004 |url=http://www.philosophyofchiropractic.com/primerall72.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon (i.e. perform spinal analysis, detect subluxation, correct with adjustment, etc.). They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care.

==== Mixer ====

''Mixer'' chiropractors are an early offshoot of the straight movement. This branch "mixes" diagnostic and treatment approaches from naturopathic, osteopathic, medical, and chiropractic viewpoints. Unlike straight chiropractors, mixers believe subluxation is one of the many causes of disease, and they incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ myriad treatments including joint and soft tissue manipulation, electromodalities, [[physical therapy]], exercise-rehabilitation and other complementary and alternative approaches such as acupuncture. Mixers tend to be open to mainstream medicine.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg>{{cite journal |journal= Arch Intern Med |date=1998 |volume=158 |issue=20 |pages=2215–24 |title= Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions |author= Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM |pmid=9818801 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/158/20/2215}}</ref> Mixers are the majority group.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Cult Med Psychiatry |date=1985 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=353–82 |title=Adjustment, the hands and healing |author=Coulehan JL |pmid=2934224}}</ref>

=== Vertebral subluxation ===

Palmer hypothesized that vertebral joint misalignments, which he termed "vertebral subluxations," interfered with the body's function and its inborn (innate) ability to heal itself.<ref name=History-PPC>{{cite book |author= Keating JC Jr |chapter= A brief history of the chiropractic profession |pages=23–64 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref> D.D. Palmer repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone (health) of the end organ. D.D. Palmer, using a [[vitalism|vitalistic]] approach, imbued the term [[vertebral subluxation|subluxation]] with a metaphysical and [[philosophical]] meaning. He qualified this by noting that knowledge of innate intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf |format=PDF |title= D.D. Palmer's forgotten theories of chiropractic |author= Keating JC Jr |publisher= Association for the History of Chiropractic |date=1995 |accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> This concept was later expanded upon by his son, B.J. Palmer and was instrumental in providing the legal basis of differentiating chiropractic medicine from conventional medicine. In 1910, D.D. Palmer theorized that the nervous system controlled health:

:"Physiologists divide nerve-fibers, which form the nerves, into two classes, afferent and efferent. Impressions are made on the peripheral afferent fiber-endings; these create sensations that are transmitted to the center of the nervous system. Efferent nerve-fibers carry impulses out from the center to their endings. Most of these go to muscles and are therefore called motor impulses; some are secretory and enter glands; a portion are inhibitory their function being to restrain secretion. Thus, nerves carry impulses outward and sensations inward. The activity of these nerves, or rather their fibers, may become excited or allayed by impingement, the result being a modification of functionality—too much or not enough action—which is disease."<ref name=Palmer1910>{{cite book |author= Palmer DD |title= The Chiropractor's Adjuster: Text-book of the Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic for Students and Practitioners |location=Portland, OR |publisher= Portland Printing House Co |date=1910 |oclc=17205743}}</ref>

The concept of subluxation remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and a debate about whether to keep it in the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades.<ref name=Keating-subluxation/> In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, [[dogmatic]] beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community.<ref name=Keating-subluxation>{{cite journal |journal= Chiropr Osteopat |date=2005 |volume=13 |pages=17 |title= Subluxation: dogma or science? |author= Keating JC Jr, Charlton KH, Grod JP, Perle SM, Sikorski D, Winterstein JF |doi=10.1186/1746-1340-13-17 |url=http://chiroandosteo.com/content/13/1/17}}</ref> This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic (for example, [[Palmer College of Chiropractic]]<ref name=Palmer-edu>{{cite web |url=http://www.palmer.edu/general_content.aspx?id=2630 |title=Palmer College of Chiropractic, General Information |accessdate=2008-03-24}}</ref>) still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others (for example, [[Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cmcc.ca/PDF/2006/CMCC_Calendar06to07.pdf |format=PDF |title= Undergraduate and graduate programs 2006–2007 |publisher= Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College |date=2006}}</ref>) have moved towards an [[evidence-based]] chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions but retains a holistic approach and an emphasis on manual therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Journal of Chiropractic Education |date=2000 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=71–7 |title=A Survey of the Use of Evidence-Based Health Care in Chiropractic College Clinics |author=Kevin A.

== History ==

{{main|Chiropractic history|Vertebral subluxation}}

[[Image:ddpalmer3.jpg|thumb|left|D.D. Palmer]]

Chiropractic (also known as Chiropractic Medicine) was founded in the 1890s by Canadian-American [[Daniel David Palmer]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]], USA. Palmer and his son [[B.J. Palmer]] later wrote that the elder Palmer gave the first chiropractic adjustment to a deaf man, Harvey Lillard, on [[September 18]], [[1895]], restoring the man's hearing.<ref name=Palmer1906>{{cite book |author= Palmer DD, Palmer BJ |title= The science of chiropractic: its principles and adjustments |location= Davenport, IA |publisher= Palmer School of Chiropractic |date=1906 |oclc=36930079}}</ref> Lillard's daughter disputed the account, saying that Palmer had merely slapped Lillard on the back after hearing a joke.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Westbrooks B |date=1982 |title= The troubled legacy of Harvey Lillard: the black experience in chiropractic |journal= Chiropr Hist |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=47–53 |pmid=11611211}}</ref> Investigator Cyrus Lerner found in 1952 that the Lillard story disagreed with other evidence published about the same time, speculated that B.J. had concocted the date of the first adjustment in order to establish priority for chiropractic, and compared the Lillard story to the [[Tales of the Arabian Nights]].<ref name=Lerner/> Palmer hypothesized that manual manipulation of the spine could result in improved neurological function and health. Friend and Rev. Samuel Weed suggested combining the words ''cheiros'' and ''praktikos'' (meaning "done by hand") and chiropractic was born.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Technol Cult |author=Martin SC |date=1993 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=808–34 |title=Chiropractic and the social context of medical technology, 1895-1925 |pmid=11623404}}</ref>

=== Medical opposition ===
{{POV-section}}
In [[1899]], a medical doctor in Davenport, USA, named Heinrich Matthey started a campaign against drugless practitioners.<ref name=Lerner>{{cite paper |author= Lerner C |title= Unpublished manuscript submitted to the Foundation for Health Research |date=1952 |url=http://philosophyofchiropractic.com/Lerner.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://chiroweb.com/archives/19/06/07.html |title= Chiropractic at the turn of the century |author= Keating J Jr |journal= Dyn Chiropr |date=2001 |volume=18 |issue=6}}</ref> D.D. Palmer insisted that his techniques did not need the same courses or license as medical doctors, as his graduates did not prescribe drugs, perform surgery or evaluate laboratory diagnostics. However, in 1906, D.D. Palmer was convicted for practicing [[medicine]] without a license. In response, B.J. created the Universal Chiropractic Association (UCA) for the purpose of protecting its members by covering their legal expenses should they get arrested for practicing medicine.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Keating JC Jr |date=1999 |url=http://chiroweb.com/archives/17/25/09.html |title= Tom Moore, defender of chiropractic, part 1 |journal= Dyn Chiropr |volume=17 |issue=25}}</ref>
[[Image:BJPalmer2.jpg|thumb|left|130px|BJ Palmer, Developer of Chiropractic, 1882-1961]]

Its first case came in 1907, when Shegataro Morikubo, DC was charged with unlicensed practice of [[osteopathic medicine]] in Wisconsin. Morikubo was freed using the defense that chiropractic [[philosophy]] was different from osteopathic philosophy. The victory reshaped the development of the chiropractic profession, which then marketed itself as a science, an art and a philosophy.<ref name=Lerner/> This began a longstanding feud between chiropractors and medical doctors that would culminate in the mid 1980's in a landmark case, Wilk et al. vs [[American Medical Association]] (AMA). Until 1983, the AMA held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with an "unscientific practitioner," and labeled chiropractic "an unscientific [[cult]]."<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Am J Public Health |date=1989 |volume=79 |issue=11 |pages=1569–70 |title= AMA policy on chiropractic |author=Cherkin D |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=2817179 |pmid=2817179}}</ref> In 1984, Joseph Janse, DC, ND, attempted to describe the divide in chiropractic and medical philosophy regarding prevention and patient care:

<blockquote>
"Unless pathology is demonstrable under the microscope, as in the laboratory or by roentgenograms, to them [medical doctors] it does not exist. For years the progressive minds in chiropractic have pointed out this deficiency. With emphasis they [chiropractors] have maintained the fact that prevention is so much more effective than attempts at a cure. They pioneered the all-important principle that effective eradication of disease is accomplished only when it is in its functional (beginning) phase rather than its organic (terminal) stage. It has been their contention that in general the doctor, the therapist and the clinician have failed to realize exactly what is meant by disease processes, and have been satisfied to consider damaged organs as disease, and to think in terms of sick organs and not in terms of sick people. In other words, we have failed to contrast disease with health, and to trace the gradual deteriorization along the downward path, believing almost that mild departures from the physiological normal were of little consequence, until they were replaced by pathological changes…"<ref>Janse J, quoted in: {{cite book |author= Strang VV |title= Essential Principles of Chiropractic |location= Davenport, IA |publisher= Palmer College of Chiropractic |oclc=12102972 |date=1984 |pages= p. 26}}</ref>
</blockquote>

In 1992, the AMA stated "It is ethical for a physician to associate professionally with chiropractors provided that the physician believes that such association is in the best interests of his or her patient. A physician may refer a patient for diagnostic or therapeutic services to a chiropractor permitted by law to furnish such services whenever the physician believes that this may benefit his or her patient. Physicians may also ethically teach in recognized schools of chiropractic."<ref name="E-3.041 Chiropractic">{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/apps/pf_new/pf_online?f_n=browse&doc=policyfiles/HnE/E-3.041.HTM |title= E-3.041 Chiropractic |accessdate=2008-03-24 |publisher=American Medical Association}}</ref> In 1997, the following literature was adopted as policy of the AMA after a report on a number of alternative therapies. The report said (about chiropractic care): "[[joint manipulation|Manipulation]] has been shown to have a reasonably good degree of efficacy in ameliorating back pain, headache, and similar musculoskeletal complaints."<ref name="AMA Report 12">{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/13638.html |title=Report 12 of the Council on Scientific Affairs (A-97) Full Text |accessdate=2008-03-24 |publisher=American Medical Association}}</ref>

The British Medical Association (BMA) notes that "There is also no problem with GPs referring patients to practitioners in osteopathy and chiropractic who are registered with the relevant statutory regulatory bodies, as a similar means of redress is available to the patient."<ref name=BMA-referrals>{{cite web |url=http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/refcomtherap0406?OpenDocument&Highlight=2 |title=Referrals to complementary therapists |accessdate=2008-05-25 |publisher=British Medical Association}}</ref> In 1997, the BMA identified chiropractic health care as having "the potential for greatest use alongside orthodox medical care."<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Med Law |date=1997 |volume= 16 |issue=3 |pages=437–49 |title= Legislative approaches to the regulation of the chiropractic profession |author=Chapman-Smith DA |url= |pmid=9409129}}</ref>

=== Internal conflicts ===

Straights and mixers have had conflicts that continue to this day.<ref name=Ernst-2008/> ''Objective Straight'' chiropractors, who were an off-shoot of straights, only focused on the correction of chiropractic vertebral subluxations while traditional straights claimed that chiropractic adjustments are a plausible treatment for a wide range of diseases.<ref name=F.A.C.E.-position-paper1>{{cite web |url=http://www.f-a-c-e.com/positionpaper1.htm |title=Position Paper One — What is Objective Straight Chiropractic? |accessdate=2008-03-24 |publisher=Foundation for the Advancement of Chiropractic Education (F.A.C.E.)}}</ref> ''Reform'' chiropractors were an [[evidence-based]] off-shoot of mixers who rejected traditional Palmer philosophy and tended not to use [[alternative medicine]] methods.<ref name="JCMC"/> There is disagreement over what does innate and subluxation mean to chiropractic.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/> Some chiropractors believe in [[Innate intelligence]], an untestable faith-based belief, not of science, which has been a source of derision for chiropractors.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc |date=2002 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=10 |title=The Meanings of Innate |author=Joseph C.

=== Wilk et al. vs. American Medical Association ===

Chester A. Wilk, DC from Chicago initiated an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] suit against the AMA and other medical associations in 1976 - [[Wilk v. American Medical Association|Wilk ''et al.'' vs AMA ''et al.'']]<ref name="Sore Throat">{{cite web |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0820/is_n230/ai_18696325/pg_3 |title=Medical monopoly: the game nobody wins - excerpt from 'Reclaiming Our Health: Exploding the Medical Myth and Embracing the Source of True Healing' |accessdate= |last=Robbins |first=John |coauthors= |date=1996 |work=CNET Networks |publisher=Vegetarian Times}}</ref> The landmark lawsuit ended in 1987 when the [[US District Court]] found the AMA guilty of conspiracy and restraint of trade; the Joint Council on Accreditation of Hospitals and the [[American College of Physicians]] were exonerated. The court recognized that the AMA had to show its concern for patients, but was not persuaded that this could not have been achieved in a manner less restrictive of competition, for instance by public education campaigns.<ref name=Wilk/> A summary of the court's opinion concluded:
<blockquote>
"''Evidence at the trial showed that the defendants took active steps, often covert, to undermine chiropractic educational institutions, conceal evidence of the usefulness of chiropractic care, undercut insurance programs for patients of chiropractors, subvert government inquiries into the efficacy of chiropractic, engage in a massive disinformation campaign to discredit and destabilize the chiropractic profession and engage in numerous other activities to maintain a medical physician monopoly over health care in this country.''"<ref name=Wilk/>
</blockquote>

On [[February 7]], [[1990]], the AMA lost its appeal,<ref>''[http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cases/antitrust/wilk_v_AMA.htm Wilk v. AMA]'', 895 F.2d 352 (7th Cir. 1990).</ref> and could no longer prevent medical physicians from collaborating with chiropractors.<ref name=Wilk>{{cite web |url=http://chiro.org/abstracts/amavschiro.pdf |format=PDF |title= The Wilk case |publisher= The Chiropractic Resource Organization |accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref>

=== Movement toward science ===

In the first 50 years of chiropractic, there was a lack of research. The terms science and research were often used as marketing tools.

In 1993, the Manga report funded by the Ministry of Health strongly supported chiropractic care for lower back pain.<ref name=Keating-1997/> At the time, the Manga report "caused ripples throughout the traditional medical community when it concluded that chiropractic management of low-back pain is both more effective and cost-effective than traditional medical treatment."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/13/15/06.html|title=Canada Celebrates 100 Years of Chiropractic|accessdate=2008-05-01 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=July 17, 1995 |volume=13|issue=15|publisher=Dynamic Chiropractic}}</ref> A 2001 study says "The Manga report was not a controlled clinical trial but a review of the literature that offered an opinion that has not been experimentally established."<ref name=Grod/> In 1998, historian Joseph Keating Jr wrote that "substantial increases in scholarly activities within the chiropractic profession are suggested by the growth in scholarly products published in the discipline's most distinguished periodical (JMPT).

=== Safety ===

Chiropractic care in general is safe when employed skillfully and appropriately. Its primary therapeutic procedure, spinal manipulation, involves directed thrust to move a joint past its physiological range of motion without exceeding the anatomical limit. Manipulation is regarded as relatively safe, but as with all therapeutic interventions, complications can arise, and it has known adverse effects, risks and contraindications.<ref name=WHO-guidelines/> Absolute [[contraindication]]s to spinal manipulation are conditions that should not be manipulated; these contraindications include [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and conditions known to result in unstable joints. Relative contraindications are conditions where increased risk is acceptable in some situations and where low-force and soft-tissue techniques are treatments of choice; these contraindications include [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=WHO-guidelines/> Although most contraindications apply only to manipulation of the affected region, some neurological signs indicate referral to [[emergency medical services]]; these include sudden and severe [[headache]] or [[neck pain]] unlike that previously experienced.<ref name=CCA-CFCREAB-CPG>{{cite journal |journal= J Can Chiropr Assoc |date=2005 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=158–209 |title= Chiropractic clinical practice guideline: evidence-based treatment of adult neck pain not due to whiplash |author= Anderson-Peacock E, Blouin JS, Bryans R ''et al.'' |url=http://www.jcca-online.org/Client/cca/jcca.nsf/objects/jcca-v49-3-158/$file/jcca-v49-3-158.pdf |format=PDF}}<br/>&nbsp;• {{cite journal |journal= J Can Chiropr Assoc |date=2008 |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=7–8 |title= A clinical practice guideline update from The CCA•CFCREAB-CPG |author= Anderson-Peacock E, Bryans B, Descarreaux M ''et al.'' |url=http://www.jcca-online.org/Client/cca/JCCA.nsf/objects/JCCA_March_2008_52_1/$file/jcca-v52-1-007.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>
