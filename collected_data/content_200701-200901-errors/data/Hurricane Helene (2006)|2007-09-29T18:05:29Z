'''Hurricane Helene''' was the strongest hurricane of the [[2006 Atlantic hurricane season]] alongside [[Hurricane Gordon (2006)|Hurricane Gordon]], and was the ninth [[tropical cyclone|tropical storm]], fourth hurricane and second major hurricane of the [[2006 Atlantic hurricane season]]. 

Helene was a long-lived [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]] that formed in the extreme southeastern part of the North [[Atlantic Ocean]], peaking as a Category 3 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale]] as it traversed the central Atlantic. It never affected land until the very end of its lifespan as a weak extratropical system, which had minor impact in the northern [[British Isles]]. 

==Storm history==
{{Storm path|Helene 2006 track.png}}
In the second week of [[September]], a strong tropical wave began to emerge off the coast of [[Africa]]. It was well-organized from the start, and on [[September 11]], even before it emerged off the coast, the [[National Hurricane Center]] believed that it could quickly develop into a tropical depression. That is indeed what happened, and it became Tropical Depression Eight on the morning of [[September 12]].<ref name="HeleneTCR">{{cite web | author=Brown, Daniel P. | date=[[November 15]], [[2006]] | title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Helene | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-15 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL082006_Helene.pdf | format=PDF}}</ref>

The enormous size of the depression made it fairly slow to develop, combined with some easterly [[wind shear]] in the eastern Atlantic and influence of the [[Saharan Air Layer]] to the north as it tracked south of the [[Cape Verde]] islands.<ref name="HeleneTCR"/> Convection was also slow to build in, with little banding at first. The initial strengthening was delayed as a result.<ref name="Helene3">{{cite web | date=[[September 12]], [[2006]] | title=Tropical Depression Eight Discussion #3 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.003.shtml? }}</ref> However, on [[September 13]], the organization improved as banding became better defined, and that evening, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Helene.<ref name="Helene7">{{cite web | date=[[September 13]], [[2006]] | title=Tropical Storm Helene Discussion #7 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.007.shtml? }}</ref> The storm slowly strengthened over the warm waters of the eastern Atlantic thereafter as it tracked west-northwest. Some dry air from the Saharan Air Layer continued to slow development on [[September 14]] as Helene remained a low-end tropical storm.<ref name="Helene11">{{cite web | date=[[September 14]], [[2006]] | title=Tropical Storm Helene Discussion #11 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.011.shtml? }}</ref> However, a bout of intensification took place on [[September 15]] as shear diminished.<ref name="Helene13">{{cite web | date=[[September 15]], [[2006]] | title=Tropical Storm Helene Discussion #13 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.013.shtml? }}</ref> The storm became much better organized with well-defined banding, and levelled off that evening at just under hurricane intensity.<ref name="Helene14">{{cite web | date=[[September 15]], [[2006]] | title=Tropical Storm Helene Discussion #14 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.014.shtml? }}</ref><ref name="HeleneTCR"/>

On the morning of [[September 16]], the storm began to develop a ragged [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] and strengthened to Hurricane Helene.<ref name="Helene17">{{cite web | date=[[September 16]], [[2006]] | title=Hurricane Helene Discussion #17 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.017.shtml? }}</ref> The intensity levelled off for a while as a marginal [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale|Category 1 hurricane]], as the intensification was slowed by the presence of moderate wind shear despite the absence of significant dry air.<ref name="Helene18">{{cite web | date=[[September 16]], [[2006]] | title=Hurricane Helene Discussion #18 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.018.shtml? }}</ref> Late that evening, the storm began to slowly intensify once again.<ref name="HeleneTCR"/>

On [[September 17]], the intensification became more rapid and Helene quickly became a Category 2 hurricane that morning as the eye became clearer and surrounded by deep convection.<ref name="Helene21">{{cite web | date=[[September 17]], [[2006]] | title=Hurricane Helene Discussion #21 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.021.shtml? }}</ref> Helene also turned more northward and slowed down in the central Atlantic, which was in response to a weakness in the [[subtropical ridge]] farther north created by Gordon to the north. The northward turn shifted the course away from any land areas.<ref name="HeleneTCR"/> The intensification continued through the afternoon, and that evening, Helene strengthened into a major hurricane with 115 mph (185 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 962 mbar. As shear remained low and the oceans remained warm, Helene intensified slightly more, peaking as a solid Category 3 hurricane with 120 mph (195 km/h) winds early on [[September 18]]. At that time, Helene and Gordon were at roughly the same [[longitude]] in the open ocean.<ref name="HeleneTCR"/> (Operationally, Helene was estimated to have had 125 mph (205 km/h) winds, but the post-storm analysis downgraded it slightly.<ref name="Helene25">{{cite web | date=[[September 18]], [[2006]] | title=Hurricane Helene Discussion #25 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.025.shtml? }}</ref>)

As Gordon moved eastward on the afternoon of 18th, a narrow ridge built in, forcing Helene westward. The eyewall collapsed somewhat, and Helene weakened slightly to a Category 2 hurricane, where it levelled off for about 48 hours until [[September 20]] due to a lengthy [[eyewall replacement cycle]] and an elongated cloud pattern.<ref name="Helene31">{{cite web | date=[[September 19]], [[2006]] | title=Hurricane Helene Discussion #31 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.031.shtml? }}</ref><ref name="HeleneTCR"/> On the 20th, Helene turned back to the northwest and weakened slightly due to a slight increase in wind shear.<ref name="Helene33">{{cite web | date=[[September 20]], [[2006]] | title=Hurricane Helene Discussion #33 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.033.shtml? }}</ref> That afternoon, it was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane, which Helene remained until becoming [[extratropical]].<ref name="HeleneTCR"/>

Early on [[September 21]], the motion shifted to the north as it moved along the northwest periphery of the subtropical ridge.<ref name="Helene36">{{cite web | date=[[September 21]], [[2006]] | title=Hurricane Helene Discussion #36 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.036.shtml? }}</ref> That general motion continued throughout the day, however, Helene began to turn more northeastward that evening along the edge of the subtropical ridge, east of [[Bermuda]].<ref name="HeleneTCR"/> A decrease in wind shear and relatively warm water around 81°F (27°C) kept the intensity mostly stationary, keeping Helene as a Category 1 hurricane.<ref name="Helene41">{{cite web | date=[[September 22]], [[2006]] | title=Hurricane Helene Discussion #41 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.041.shtml? }}</ref> The intensity held around 80 mph (130 km/h) before strengthening slightly late on [[September 22]], despite losing some tropical characteristics (it was operationally downgraded to a tropical storm for a brief period<ref name="Helene43">{{cite web | date=[[September 22]], [[2006]] | title=Hurricane Helene Discussion #43 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.043.shtml? }}</ref>) as it accelerated northeast in the north Atlantic. A [[QuikSCAT]] analysis early on [[September 23]] confirmed a high-end Category 1 hurricane with 90 mph (145 km/h) winds.<ref name="HeleneTCR"/>

Helene transitioned into a "hybrid" storm with both tropical and extratropical characteristics that afternoon, with both a deep warm core and an asymmetric, frontal-like appearance.<ref name="Helene47">{{cite web | date=[[September 23]], [[2006]] | title=Hurricane Helene Discussion #47 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.047.shtml? }}</ref> After that, increased shear weakened Helene once again, although it remained a hurricane-strength storm until it was fully extratropical on the morning of [[September 24]].<ref name="Helene50">{{cite web | date=[[September 24]], [[2006]] | title=Hurricane Helene Discussion #50 | publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] | accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al08/al082006.discus.050.shtml? }}</ref><ref name="HeleneTCR"/> After becoming extratropical, the storm weakened as it tracked eastward, becoming a gale center west of [[Ireland]] early on [[September 27]]. It eventually merged with a larger extratropical low near the northern end of the [[British Isles]] late on the 27th.<ref name="HeleneTCR"/>

==Impact==
While a tropical system, Helene never approached land. Three ships were caught in the outer bands of Helene; the strongest of which reported 56 mph (91 km/h) sustained winds early on September 23 in the north Atlantic.<ref name="HeleneTCR"/> Though it remained far away from the island, the hurricane produced rough waves in [[Bermuda]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Bermuda Weather Service|year=2006|title=Weather Summary for September 2006|accessdate=2007-06-07|url=http://www.weather.bm/data/2006-09.html}}</ref> As a weakened extratropical system, strong wind gusts were reported in [[Ireland]] and northern [[Scotland]]. The strongest reported wind gust in Ireland was at the [[Valentia Observatory]], where 56 mph (91 km/h) gusts were reported. In Scotland, the strongest gust was on [[South Uist]] Island in the [[Outer Hebrides]], where 74 mph (118 km/h) gusts were reported. No damage or fatalities were reported as a result of Helene.<ref name="HeleneTCR"/>
