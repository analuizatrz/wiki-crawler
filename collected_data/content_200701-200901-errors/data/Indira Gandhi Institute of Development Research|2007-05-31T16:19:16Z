The '''Indira Gandhi Institute of Developmental Research''' (IGIDR), [[Mumbai]] is a [[research]] institution established by The [[Reserve Bank of India]] in [[1987]] on the occasion of its [[golden jubilee]]. The institute's mission is to carry out research on developmental issues from a multi-disciplinary point of view. It has one of the largest [[Social Sciences]] libraries in [[Asia]]. The institute has a MPhil/PhD program and also an MSC Program in [[Economics]].

After its registration as an autonomous society on November 14, 1986 and as a public trust in January 15,1987, then Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi inaugurated the campus at Goregaon, Mumbai on December 28, 1987. Subsequently, the Institute was recognized as a Deemed University under Section 3 of the UGC Act. Dr.R.Radhakrishna is the current director of the Institute. At present the Institute has about 120 employees and M.Phil/Ph.D students that include about 30 full time faculty members, 24 non-academic staff and about 60 M.Phil/Ph.D. students.

Starting as a purely research institution, the Institute quickly developed into a full-fledged teaching cum research organisation when in 1990 it launched a Ph.D. program in the field of development studies. The objective of the Ph.D. programme is to produce analysts with diverse disciplinary background who can address issues of economics, energy and environment policies. In 1995 an M. Phil programme was started keeping in mind the needs of the nation. The growing needs of the country for more Development Economists to cater to the several development issues has been the driving force and motivation behind the growth of the Institute.

IGIDR has also got a full fleged M.Sc. program for which there are only about 20 seats from all over India. The entrance procedure comprises of two levels of screening. There is first a written exam, once that is cleared there is a 6 person panel interview.
