'''''Verbascum thapsus''''' ({{pronEng|vɝˈbæskəm ˈθæpsəs}}; '''Great Mullein''' or '''Common Mullein''') is a species of [[mullein]] native to [[Europe]], northern [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and introduced in the [[Americas]] and [[Australia]]. 

It is a hairy [[biennial plant]] that can grow to 2&nbsp;[[metre|m]] or more tall. Its small yellow flowers are densely grouped on the tall stem, which bolts from a large rosette of leaves. It grows in a wide variety of habitats, but prefers well-lit disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the [[soil seed bank]]. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but rarely becomes aggressively [[invasive species|invasive]] since its seed require open ground to [[germination|germinate]]. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops since it is not a very competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.

It is widely used for herbal remedies with [[emollient]] and [[astringent]] properties. It is especially recommended for coughs and related problems, but also used in [[topical]] applications against a variety of skin problems. The plant was also used to make [[dye]]s and [[torch]]es.

<!-- [[Image:Vthapsus sheet.JPG|thumb|right|The dried type specimen (LINN 242.1) of ''Verbascum thapsus''.]]-->
For the purpose of [[botanical nomenclature]], ''Verbascum thapsus'' was first described by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in his 1753 ''[[Species Plantarum]]''. The [[specific epithet]] ''thapsus'' had been first used by [[Theophrastus]] (as ''θάψος'', "thapsos")<ref name="carnoy"/> for an unspecified herb from the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] settlement of Thapsos, near modern [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Sicily]],<ref name="carnoy">{{fr icon}}{{cite book| last=Carnoy| first=A. |title=Dictionnaire étymologique des noms grecs de plantes| year=1959|location=Louvain| publisher= Publications Universitaires| oclc=3284108}}</ref><ref>{{sv icon}} [http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/scrophularia/verba/verbtha.html Den virtuella Floran: ''Verbascum thapsus''], retrieved on [[December 29]] [[2006]].</ref> though it is often assimilated to the ancient [[Tunisia]]n city of [[Thapsus]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Charters|first=Michael L.|title=Plant name: T| work= California Plant Names: Latin and Greek Meanings and Derivations| url=http://www.calflora.net/botanicalnames/pageT.html|publisher=Calflora.net| accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref> Within ''[[Verbascum]]'', it classified under section ''Bothrosperma'' subsect.

At the time, no [[type specimen]] was specified, as the practice only appeared later, in the 19th century. When a lectotype (type selected amongst original material) was designated, it was assigned to specimen 242.1 of Linnaeus' herbarium, the only ''V. thapsus'' specimen. The species had previously been designated as [[type species]] for ''Verbascum''.<ref>{{cite web| title=''Verbascum thapsus''| url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/research-curation/projects/linnaean-typification/detail.dsml?ID=925400| work=Linnaean Plant Name Typification Project| publisher=Natural History Museum| accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> European plants exhibit considerable [[phenotype|phenotypical]] variation,<ref name="BoCW"/> which has led to the plant acquiring many [[synonymy|synonyms]] over the years.<ref>{{Cite web| title=''Verbascum thapsus'' synonymy| url=http://www.northernontarioflora.ca/chklst.cfm?speciesid=1004482| publisher=Northern Ontario Plant Database|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=''Verbascum thapsus'': synonyms| url=http://www.plantatlas.usf.edu/synonyms.asp?plantID=1757| work=Atlas of Florida vascular Plants | publisher=Institute for Systematic Botany |accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> Introduced American populations show much less variation.<ref name="BoCW"/>

==Ecology==

[[Image:Starr 040723 0074 verbascum thapsus.jpg|thumb|right|''V. thapsus'' grows best where there is little competition]]
Great Mullein most frequently grows as a colonist of bare and disturbed soil, usually on sandy or chalky soils.<ref name="NWeurope"/> This is in part due to its intolerance of shade and the very long periods during which the seeds can remain dormant before [[germination]]. It is not an agricultural [[weed]], although its presence can be very difficult to completely eradicate, and is especially problematic in [[overgrazing|overgrazed]] pastures.<ref name="Hoshovsky">Hoshovsky (2001)</ref><ref name="davis">{{Cite web|last=Pitcairn|first=Michael|title=Verbascum thapsus |url=http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/datastore/detailreport.cfm?usernumber=87&surveynumber=182 |work=|publisher=[[University of California Davis]]|accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref><ref name="remaley"/> The species is considered a [[noxious weed]] in [[Colorado]], [[United States]] (Class C),<ref>{{cite web|title=Colorado State-listed Noxious Weeds|url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/noxious?rptType=State&statefips=08| work=PLANTS Database| publisher=USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service| accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref> Hawaii<ref>{{cite web|title=Hawaii State-listed Noxious Weeds|url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/noxious?rptType=State&statefips=15| work=PLANTS Database| publisher=USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service| accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref> and [[Victoria, Australia]] (regionally prohibited in the [[West Gippsland]] region, and regionally controlled in several others).<ref>{{cite web|last=Faithful| first=Ian| title=Great Mullein| url=http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/nreninf.nsf/LinkView/D2FE171D9ECA1CC9CA256BCF000AD563ECC844336D72F0634A256DEA00293F8A | publisher=Victoria Department of Primary Industries |accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref>

It grows best in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, although it can grow in a variety of habitats, including banksides, meadows, roadsides, forest clearings and pastures. It germinates almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10&nbsp;[[°C]] and 40&nbsp;°C.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> This ability to grow in a wide range of habitats has been linked to strong [[phenotype]] variation rather than [[adaptation]] capacities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Ingrid M.|coauthors=Joseph Rodriguez, Michael E.

===Life cycle===

Great Mullein is a biennial and generally requires [[vernalization|winter dormancy]] before it can flower.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> This dormancy is linked to [[starch]] degradation in the root activated by low temperatures, and [[gibberellin]] application bypasses this requirement.<ref name="phyt"/> Seeds germinate in spring and summer most often when exposed to light, those that germinate in autumn produce plants that overwinter if they are large enough with rosettes less than 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;in) across dying in winter. After flowering the entire plant usually dies at the end of its second year<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> but some individuals, especially in the northern parts of the range, require a longer growth period and flower in their third year. Under longer growing conditions, some individuals flower in the first year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reinartz|first=James A.|title=Life History Variation of Common Mullein (''Verbascum Thapsus''): I.

[[Image:Common Mullein closeup.jpg|right|thumb|The hairy leaves are resistant to grazing and contact herbicides.]]

Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via mechanical means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably followed by sowing of native plants. Animals rarely [[grazing|graze]] it because of its irritating hairs, and liquid [[herbicide]]s require [[surfactant]]s to be effective, as the hair causes water to roll off the plant, much like the [[lotus effect]]. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for [[seedling]]s to occupy.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/><ref name="davis"/><ref name="remaley"/> ''G. tetrum'' and ''Cucullia verbasci'' usually have little effect on ''V. thapsus'' populations.<ref name="remaley"/> Goats and chickens have been proposed to control Mullein.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include [[glyphosate]],<ref name="remaley"/><ref name="davis"/> [[triclopyr]]<ref name="remaley"/> and [[sulfurometuron-methyl]].<ref name="davis"/> Ground herbicides, like [[tebuthiuron]], are also effective, but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent regrowth.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/>

==Uses==
Great Mullein has been used since ancient times as a remedy for skin, throat and breathing ailments. It has long had a medicinal reputation, especially as an [[astringent]] and [[emollient]]. It contains [[mucilage]], several [[saponin]]s, [[coumarin]] and [[glycoside]]s. [[Dioscorides]] recommended it for diseases of the [[lung]] and it is nowadays widely available in health and herbal stores. Non-medical uses have included [[dye]]ing and making [[torch]]es.

Leaf [[decoction]]s or [[herbal tea]]s were used for [[expectoration]], consumption, dry cough, [[bronchitis]], sore throat and [[hemorrhoid]]s.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Great Mullein is called ''Gordolobo''. ''[[Gnaphalium]] conoideum'' was used in a fashion similar to Mullein by the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Aztec]]s, which caused confusion in naming, and both are sold under the name "Gordolobo", (although ''V. thapsus'' is not found in Mexico). This situation has led to at least one case of poisoning due to confusion of ''G. conoideum'' with ''[[Senecio]] longilobus.''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kay| first=Margaret| title=Poisoning by Gordolobo|url=http://www.herbalgram.org/iherb/herbalgram/articleview.asp?a=1122 |journal=HerbalGram|issue=32|pages=42|year=1994|month=Fall| issn=0899-5648}}</ref>

Like many ancient medicinal plants ([[Pliny the Elder]] describes it in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]''),{{ref label|Pliny|D|}} Great Mullein was linked to [[witch]]es,<ref name="grieve"/> although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held to ward off [[curse]]s and [[evil spirit]]s.<ref name="grieve"/><ref name="phyt"/><ref name="silverman"/><ref name="hanrahan"/> The seeds contain several compounds (saponins, glycosides, coumarin, rotenone) that cause breathing problems in fish, and have been widely used as [[piscicide]] for [[fishing]].<ref name="remaley"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilhelm| first=Gene| title=The mullein: Plant piscicide of the mountain folk culture| journal=Geographic Review| volume=64| issue=2| pages=235-252|month=April| year=1974| doi=10.2307/213812}}</ref>

The flowers provide dyes of bright yellow or green, and have been used for [[hair dye]].<ref name="grieve"/><ref name="pfaf"/> The dried leaves and hair were made into [[candle wick]]s, or put into shoes to help with insulating them. The dried stems were also dipped into [[suet]] or [[wax]] to make torches.<ref name="grieve"/><ref name="hanrahan"/> For obvious reasons, the plant, unlike other species of the genus, is not often cultivated.
