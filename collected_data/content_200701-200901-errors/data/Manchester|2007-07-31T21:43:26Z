===Toponymy===
The name "Manchester" ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|/ˈmæntʃɛstə/}}) came from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name ''Mamucium'', thought to be a [[Latin]]isation of an original [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name (possibly meaning "breast-like hill" from ''mamm-'' = "breast"), plus [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''ceaster'' = "town", which is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[castra]]'' = "camp".<ref>{{cite book|author=Mills, A. D.|title=A Dictionary of British Place-names|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn= ISBN 0-19-852758-6}}</ref>

There are few signs of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] occupation of the city. The only major [[Bronze age#Great Britain|Bronze age]] find is at the far south of the city, where the remains of an extensive farming community overlooking the [[River Bollin]] were found during the construction of the second runway of the airport.<ref name=H11>Hartwell ''et al'', pp&nbsp;11-17.</ref>

Thomas de la Warre, lord of the manor, founded and constructed a collegiate church for the [[Manchester (ancient parish)|parish]] in 1421. The church is now [[Manchester Cathedral]]; the domestic premises of the college now house [[Chetham's School of Music]] and [[Chetham's Library]].<ref>Hartwell ''et al'', p&nbsp;267-8; Kidd, p&nbsp;15.</ref>

Around the 14th century, Manchester had seen an influx of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] weavers, sometimes credited as the foundation of the regions textile industry.<ref>{{cite book |last = Pevsner | first = Nikolaus | authorlink = Nikolaus Pevsner | title = The Buildings of England: South Lancashire|year = 1969 | publisher = Penguin | location = London | id = ISBN 0-14-071036-1 |pages = p&nbsp;265}}</ref><ref>Hylton, p&nbsp;25; Kidd p&nbsp;15.</ref> Manchester became an important centre for the manufacture and trade of woollens and linen, and by about 1540, had expanded to become, in [[John Leland]]'s words, "The fairest, best builded, quickest, and most populous town of all Lancashire."<ref name=kiddch1>Kidd, pp&nbsp;15-22.</ref><ref>Hylton, p&nbsp;22 gives an extended modern translation of Leland's words.</ref> The cathedral and Chetham's buildings are the only significant surviors of Leland's Manchester.<ref>Hartwell ''et al'', p&nbsp;256.</ref> 

Significant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton [[fustian]]s, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance.<ref>Kidd, pp&nbsp;16-17.</ref> The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The [[Bridgewater Canal]], Britains first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at [[Worsley]] to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton.<ref>Hartwell ''et al'', p&nbsp;258; Hylton, pp&nbsp;63-7; Kidd, p&nbsp;19.</ref>

In 1780, [[Richard Arkwright]] began construction of Manchester's first cotton mill.<ref>Hylton, p&nbsp;69; Hartwell, p&nbsp;14; Hartwell ''et al'', p&nbsp;258</ref>

===Industrial Revolution===
[[Image:Manchester central 1894.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A map of Manchester from 1894.]]
[[Image:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Manchester (or [[Cottonopolis]] as it was sometimes referred) during the early 19th century.]]During the 19th century Manchester grew to become the centre of [[Lancashire]]'s cotton industry and was dubbed "[[Cottonopolis]]". During this period the canal system grew, and Manchester became one end of the world's first intercity passenger railway - the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

Manchester quickly grew into an important industrial centre. At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen &mdash; new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the so called "[[Manchester School]]", promoting [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]''), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: "What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow."<ref>{{cite book |editor=Speake, Jennifer |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t90.e1326 |accessdate=2007-07-06 |year=2003 |edition = 4th ed|publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn=0198605242 |quote=What MANCHESTER says today, the rest of England says tomorrow}}<br />• {{cite web

As well as being a centre of capitalism the city saw its fair share of rebellion by the working and non-titled classes, with the most famous being the events on St Peter’s Field on [[16 August]] [[1819]] which have become known as '[[Peterloo]]'. The first [[Trades Union Congress]] was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to [[6 June]] [[1868]]. Manchester was the subject of [[Friedrich Engels]]'s ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', Engels himself spending much of his life in and around Manchester.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1893.htm |title=Biography of Engels |accessdate=2007-07-30 |work=Marx-Engels Internet Archive}}</ref> Manchester was also an important cradle of the [[Labour Party (UK)| Labour Party]] and the [[Suffragette]] Movement.<ref>Kidd, Chapter 9 "England Arise! The Politics of Labour and Womens's Suffrage".</ref>  In 1878 the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|GPO]] provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/1851to1880/1878.htm|title=Events in Telecommunications History: 1878|work=BT Archives|accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>

Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Many of the great public buildings (including the Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the [[Hallé Orchestra]]. In 1889, when county councils were created in [[England]], the municipal borough became a [[county borough]] with even greater autonomy. During this period, the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was created by the canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey for 36&nbsp;miles from Salford to the Mersey estuary. This enabled ocean going ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester. By 1963 the port was the UK's third largest<ref>{{cite book | last = Parkinson-Bailey | first = John J | authorlink = | title = Manchester: an Architectural History | year = 2000 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | id = ISBN 0-7190-5606-3 | pages = p127}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last = Pevsner | first = Nikolaus | authorlink = Nikolaus Pevsner | title = The Buildings of England: South Lancashire|year = 1969 | publisher = Penguin | location = London | id = ISBN 0-14-071036-1 |pages= p267}}</ref> and employed over 3000 men, but the canal was unable to handle the increasingly large [[Containerization|container]] ships. Traffic declined, and the port closed in 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.salford.gov.uk/living/regeneration/geographicareas/quays-regen/salford-quays/manchesterdocks.htm |title = Manchester docks pre-1985 |accessdate = 2007-07-06 |date = [[10 June]] [[2005]] |work = Salford City Council web pages |publisher = Salford City Council }}</ref> 

Manchester suffered greatly from the inter-war depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.

===World War II===
During [[World War II]] Manchester was involved in heavy industrial construction. The city was attacked a number of times by the [[Luftwaffe]], particularly in the "Christmas Blitz" of 1941, which destroyed a large part of the historic city centre. In 1940 [[Manchester Cathedral]] was partially destroyed by a [[Germany|German]] air-raid.<ref>[http://www.manchestercathedralonline.co.uk/timeline2.html "Historical Timeline"] Manchester Cathedral's website</ref>

===1996 bomb===
{{main|1996 Manchester bombing}}

Manchester has a history of attacks attributed to Irish Republicanists, including arson in 1920, a series of explosions in 1939, and two bombs in 1992. On Saturday [[15 June]] [[1996]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) detonated a large bomb adjacent to a department store in the city centre. The largest to be detonated on British soil, the bomb caused over 200 injuries, heavily damaged nearby buildings, and broke windows half a mile away. The cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at £50 million, but this was quickly revised upwards.<ref>Hylton, pp&nbsp;227-230.</ref> The final insurance payout has been estimated at over £400 million, and many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/3704943.stm |title=The cost of terrorism| Programmes | Panorama | The cost of terrorism |accessdate=2007-07-09 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News|date=[[15 May]] [[2004]]}}</ref>

Large sections of the city dating from the 1960s have been either demolished and re-developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel. Old mills have been converted into modern apartments, [[Hulme]] has undergone extensive regeneration programmes, and million-pound lofthouse apartments have since been developed. The 169&nbsp;metre tall, 47-storey [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]], completed in 2006, is the tallest building in the UK outside London and highest residential accommodation in the Western Europe. The lower 23 floors form the [[Hilton]] Hotel, featuring a 'sky bar' on the 23rd floor.

===SuperCasino===
{{Current-section|date=July 2007}}
In January 2007, the independent Casino Advisory Panel awarded Manchester a licence to build the only [[supercasino]] in the UK,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/cap/pressnotices/press_finalpanelreport300107.htm|title=Casino Advisory Panel Recommendation}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/01/30/dome_feature.shtml|title=www.culture.gov.uk/cap/pressnotices/press_finalpanelreport300107.htm|title=Casino Advisory Panel Recommendation}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/01/30/dome_feature.shtml|title=Greenwich loses Casino Bet}}</ref> but in March the [[House of Lords]] rejected the decision by three votes rendering previous [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] acceptance meaningless.

==Governance==
[[Image:ManchesterTownHall OwlofDoom.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Manchester Town Hall]], used for the local governance of Manchester, is an example of [[Victorian era]] [[Gothic revival]] architecture.]]
{{main|Politics in Manchester}}
Manchester is represented by three tiers of government, [[Manchester City Council]] ("local"), UK Parliament ("national"), and European Parliament ("Europe"). [[Greater Manchester County Council]] administration was abolished in 1986, and so the city is effectively a [[unitary authority]]. Since its inception in 1995, Manchester has been a member of the [[English Core Cities Group]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corecities.com/coreDEV/coreindex.htm|title=Core Cities|author=[[English Core Cities Group]]|publisher=corecities.com|date=N.D.|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> which, amongst other things, serves to promote the social, cultural and economic status of the city at an international level.

===Civic history===
The town of Manchester was granted a charter by Thomas Grelley in 1301 but lost [[borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] by a court case in 1359. Until the 19th century local government was largely provided by manorial courts which were not finally ended until 1846.<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{cite web |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm |title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County |author=Anon |publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Records Office]] |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> 
From [[History of Lancashire|a very early time]], the township of Manchester lay within the [[historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]] of [[Lancashire]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> It formed its own ecclesiastical parish and [[Poor Law Union]] by the name of Manchester.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In 1792 commissioners, usually known as police commissioners, were established for the social improvement Manchester. In 1838 Manchester regained borough status, and comprised the townships of [[Beswick]], [[Cheetham Hill]], [[Chorlton upon Medlock]] and [[Hulme]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> By 1846 the Borough Council had taken over the powers of the police commissioners. In 1853 Manchester was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> 

In 1885 [[Bradford, Greater Manchester|Bradford]], [[Harpurhey]], [[Rusholme]] and parts of [[Moss Side]] and [[Withington]] townships became part of the City of Manchester. In 1889 the city became the [[County Borough of Manchester]], which was external to the [[administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Lancashire, and thus not governed by [[Lancashire County Council]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city from Lancashire, including former villages such as [[Burnage]], [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], [[Didsbury]], [[Fallowfield]], [[Levenshulme]], [[Longsight]], [[Withington]]. In 1931 the [[Cheshire]] [[civil parish]]es of [[Baguley]], [[Northenden]] and Northern Etchells from the south of the [[River Mersey]] were added.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In 1974, by way of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the City of Manchester became a [[metropolitan district]] of the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In this year, [[Ringway]] was also added to the city.

Manchester lies in a bowl-shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the [[Pennines|Pennine hills]], a mountain chain that runs the length of the [[Northern England]] and to the south by the [[Cheshire]] Plain. The city centre is on the east bank of the [[River Irwell]], near the confluence with the Rivers [[River Medlock|Medlock]] and the [[River Irk|Irk]], and is relatively low-lying, being between 35 and 42&nbsp;[[metre]]s (115 to 138&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above [[sea level]].<ref>Kidd, p&nbsp;11.</ref> The [[River Mersey]] flows through the south of Manchester. Much of the inner city, especially in the south, is flat, offering extensive views from many highrise buildings in the city of the foothills and moors of the Pennines, which can often be capped with snow in the winter months. Manchester's geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world's first industrial city. These features are its climate, its proximity to a [[port|seaport]] at [[Liverpool]], the availability of water power from its rivers, and its nearby [[coal]] reserves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msim.org.uk/uploadedDocs/Document_Depository_01/The%20Manchester%20Coalfields.pdf

===Climate===
Manchester has a [[temperate]] climate, like the rest of the United Kingdom, but with regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. Its average annual rainfall is 806.6&nbsp;mm<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/manchester_airport.html Manchester, England], www.metoffice.gov.uk.

URL accessed July 15, 2007.</ref> Manchester also has a relatively high humidity level, which lent itself to the optimised and breakage-free textile manufacturing which took place there. Snowfall is not a common sight in the city, due to the [[Urban climate|urban warming]] effect. The [[Pennines]] and [[Rossendale Forest]] hills that surround the city to its east and north receive much snow in the winter and many roads leading out of the city can be closed due to snow,<ref>[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/147/147321_roads_chaos_as_snow_sweeps_in.html MEN News report on road closures] accessed July 15 2007</ref> including the [[A62 road]] via Oldham and [[Standedge]], the [[A57 road|A57]] ([[Snake Pass]]) towards Sheffield,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highpeak.co.uk/hp/h_snakbd.htm |title=Snake Pass |accessdate=2007-07-06 |work=High Peak sightseers guide }}</ref> and the [[M62 motorway|M62]] over [[Saddleworth Moor]]

Manchester and the surrounding settlements in [[North West England]] are served by an international airport as well as a major motorway and rail network. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was the first passenger railway in the world. Greater Manchester has an extensive countywide railway network, and two mainline stations. A network of bus routes and a modern tram system radiates from Manchester City Centre. A canal network also remains from the Industrial Revolution.

==Culture==

===Nightlife===
[[Image:Piccadilly Gardens.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The central fountain in [[Piccadilly Gardens]]]]
Manchester played several key roles in the development of [[nightclub]] and [[DJ]] culture (see main article on [[Culture of Manchester]]). One of the oldest venues is the [[Band on the Wall]], a live music club in the [[Northern Quarter]]. It was built around 1862 as the flagship pub of a local brewery and originally called The George & Dragon. In 1975 it was taken on by jazz musician Steve Morris and Frank Cusick, and renamed The Band on the Wall, a longtime nickname for the club since the late 1920s alluding to its stage high on the back wall.<ref>[http://www.bandonthewall.org/history.html "A discussion with Johnny Roadhouse persuaded him to stick with the name Band on the Wall"], www.bandonthewall.org, retrieved [[15 July]] [[2007]].</ref>

Along with other areas that are frequented by late night revellers (such as [[Castlefield]], Deansgate Locks, the Printworks and the [[Northern Quarter]]), Manchester boasts the famous [[Canal Street]], the centre of the city's gay community. This was made famous by the [[Channel 4]] programme, [[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|'Queer as Folk']], and is the centre of the annual Pride celebrations, held on the last weekend in August.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Manchester|List of bands from Manchester}}
Manchester is home to two [[symphony orchestra]]s, the [[Hallé Orchestra]] and the [[BBC Philharmonic Orchestra]]. There is also a [[chamber orchestra]], the Manchester Camerata. In the 1950s the city was home to the so-called ‘Manchester School’ of classical composers, which comprised [[Harrison Birtwistle]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[David Ellis]] and [[Alexander Goehr]]. Manchester is a centre for musical education, with the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] and [[Chetham's School of Music|Chetham’s School of Music]]. The main classical venue was the [[Free Trade Hall]] on Peter Street, until the 1996 debut of the 2,500 seat concert venue [[Bridgewater Hall]]. 

Manchester’s main pop music venue is the [[Manchester Evening News Arena]], situated next to [[Manchester Victoria railway station]]. It seats over 21,000, is the largest arena of its type in Europe, and has been voted ''International Venue of the Year''.<ref>[http://www.pollstaronline.com/PCIA-Static/2001winners.htm "Pollstar Concert Industry Awards 2001"], Pollstar, retrieved [[24 June]] [[2007]].</ref> Other major venues include the [[Manchester Apollo]] and the [[Manchester Academy]]. Smaller venues throughout the city are the Bierkeller, the Roadhouse, and Night and Day Cafe. 

Bands that have emerged from the Manchester music scene include [[The Smiths]], the [[Buzzcocks]], [[The Fall]], [[Joy Division]] and its successor group [[New Order]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Doves]]. . Manchester was credited as the main regional driving force behind [[Indie music|indie]] bands of the 1980s including [[Happy Mondays]], [[The Charlatans]], [[Inspiral Carpets]], [[James (band)|James]], and [[The Stone Roses]]. These groups came from what became known as the "Madchester" scene that also centred around the legendary club Fac 51 Haçienda (also known as simply [[The Haçienda]]) developed by founder of [[factory records]] [[Anthony Wilson]]. Subsequently [[The Chemical Brothers]], although from southern England, formed in Manchester. Ex-Stone Roses frontman [[Ian Brown]] and ex-[[The Smiths|Smiths]] [[Morrissey]] continue successful solo careers. Other Greater Manchester natives include [[Richard Ashcroft]] and [[Jay Kay]] of [[Jamiroquai]].

===Literature===
In the 19th century, Manchester figured in novels that discussed the changes that industrialisation had brought to Britain. These included works such as ''Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life'' (1848) by [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/gaskell_elizabeth.shtml], and ''The Condition of the English Working Class in 1844'', written by [[Friedrich Engels]] while living and working in Manchester. [[Charles Dickens]] is reputed to have set his novel ''[[Hard Times]]'' in the city, and while it is partly modelled on Preston, it shows the influence of his friend Elizabeth Gaskell [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/pva/pva27.html].

===Theatre===
Larger venues include [[the Manchester Opera House]], featuring large scale touring shows and [[West End theatre|West End]] shows, the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester|Palace Theatre]], the [[Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester|Royal Exchange Theatre]] in Manchester’s former cotton exchange, and the [[Lowry Centre]], a touring venue in Salford. Smaller sites include the [[Library Theatre]], a producing theatre in the basement of the central library, the [[Green Room (Manchester)|Green Room]], the [[Contact Theatre]], and [[Studio Salford]]. The [[Dancehouse]] is dedicated to dance productions.

===Second or Third City?===
{{main|Second city of the United Kingdom}}
Manchester has recently been regarded by some as the [[Second city of the United Kingdom]]. A 2007 poll by the [[BBC]] placed it ahead of Birmingham in the the category of second city, but also ahead in the category of ''third'' city. Neither categories are officially sanctioned, and criteria for determining what 'second city' means are ill-defined. Certainly Manchester is not the second ''largest'' city in size or population, but some argue that cultural and historical criteria are important.

The redevelopment of recent years has heightened claims that Manchester is the [[second city of the United Kingdom]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2253035.stm "Manchester 'England's second city'"], BBC News, [[12 September]] [[2002]], retrieved [[2 May]] [[2006]]<br />•http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4293814.stm "Manchester 'close to second city'"], BBC News, [[29 September]] [[2005]], retrieved [[2 May]] [[2006]]<br />•http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6349501.stm "Manchester tops second city poll"], BBC News, [[10 February]] [[2007]], retrieved [[11 February]] [[2007]]<br />•http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/02_february/09/birmingham.shtml "Birmingham loses out to Manchester in second city face off"], BBC Press Office, [[9 February]] [[2007]], retrieved [[18 June]] [[2007]].</ref>This title however, which is unofficial in the UK, is also claimed by a number of other cities, including Birmingham which has traditionally held this title since the early 20th century.<ref>[http://education.independent.co.uk/higher/overseas_students/article89204.ece City Watch: Birmingham] - From [[The Independent]]<br />•http://travel.guardian.co.uk/article/2003/sep/06/unitedkingdom.birmingham.guardiansaturdaytravelsection Second coming] - From [[The Guardian]] Unlimited.<br />•http://www.cfic.org.uk/main.php?section=10 Birmingham, Britain's second city] The College for International Citizenship<br />•{{cite web|url=http://www3.oag.com/Cities/Guide?city=2&cat=2&guideID=2|title=OAG Cities Guide}}</ref>

===Universities===
Manchester is home to two [[University|universities]], the [[University of Manchester]] and [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom, and was created in autumn 2004 by the merger of [[Victoria University of Manchester]] and [[UMIST]].<ref>http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/archive/list/item/index.htm?year=2007&month=january&id=99915<br />• http://www.manchester.ac.uk/press/newsarchive/title,3976,en.htm</ref> [[Manchester Business School]], which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965, is also part of the University of Manchester. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed out of the old [[Polytechnic#United Kingdom|polytechnic college]] in the city<ref>Kidd, p&nbsp;208.</ref> and subsequently took over the old Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1992/Uksi_19922151_en_1.htm |title=The Education (Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education Higher Education Corporation) (Dissolution) Order 1992 |accessdate=2007-07-09 |format= |work=|publisher=Crown Copyright |year=1992}} ISBN 0-11-025151-2</ref>

The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] are grouped together around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, and form the largest city-centre group of higher education institutions in Europe.<ref>Hartwell, p&nbsp;105.</ref>

===Schools===
One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the [[Manchester Grammar School]]. Established in 1515<ref>Kidd, p&nbsp;206; Hylton, p&nbsp;25.</ref> as a free [[grammar school]] next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, South Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|direct-grant grammar school]] (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bentley, James |title=Dare to be wise: a history of the Manchester Grammar School |publisher=James & James |location=London |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=0-907383-041 |pages = pp&nbsp;108, 114, 119-121}}</ref> Its previous premises are now used by [[Chetham's School of Music]]. There are two schools nearby: [[Withington Girls' School]] and [[Manchester High School for Girls]].

Defunct radio stations include Sunset (which became) [[Kiss 102]] (now Galaxy), and KFM which became Signal Cheshire (now [[Signal 1]]). These stations, as well as [[pirate radio]], played a significant role in the city's [[House music]] culture, also known as the [[Madchester]] scene, which was based around clubs like the [[The Haçienda]] which had its own show on Kiss 102. 

Erstwhile producer and radio personality [[Karl Pilkington]], of ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' fame, hails from Manchester.

===Filmography===
{{Seealso|Films set in Manchester}}
Manchester is featured in films such as ''My Son, My Son!'' (1940), directed by [[Charles Vidor]] and starring [[Brian Aherne]] and [[Louis Hayward]]. Also ''[[Grand Hotel (film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), in which [[Wallace Beery]] often shouts "Manchester!". Others include ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]'' starring [[Ewan MacGregor]], and [[Sir Alec Guinness]]'s ''[[The Man in the White Suit]]''. More recently, the entire city of Manchester is engulfed in runaway fires in the 2002 film ''[[28 Days Later]]''.

Manchester is also home to the [http://www.miff.co.uk/ Manchester Film Festival] and has held the Commonwealth film festival.

===Magazines and newspapers===
''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper was founded in Manchester in 1821 as ''The Manchester Guardian''. Its head office is still in Manchester, though many of its management functions were moved to [[London]] in 1964. It shares an office on Hardman Street with sister publication ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' (biggest-selling daily paper although now free within the city centre), and the Manchester Metro News (free weekly, Greater Manchester's biggest-circulation newspaper). Another free newspaper is the [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] North West, available from [[Metrolink]] stops, rail stations and other busy locations.

For many years most of the national newspapers had offices in Manchester: ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[Daily Express]]'', ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''. Only ''[[The Daily Sport]]'' remain based in Manchester. At its height, 1,500 journalists were employed. But in the 1980s office closures began and today the "second Fleet Street" is no more. A late attempt to launch a Northern daily newspaper, ''North West Times'', floundered in the late 1980s lasting just three months. Another attempt was made with the ''[[North West Enquirer]]'', which hoped to provide a true "regional" newspaper for the [[North West England|North West]], much in the same vein as the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' does for [[Yorkshire]] or ''[[The Northern Echo]]'' does for the [[North East England|North East]]. It folded in October 2006.

There are several local lifestyle magazines, including 'YQ Magazine' and 'Moving Manchester'.
