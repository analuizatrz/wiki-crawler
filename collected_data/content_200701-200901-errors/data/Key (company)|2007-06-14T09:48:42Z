'''Key''' is a [[Japan]]ese [[visual novel]] studio under [[Visual Art's]], known for making dramatic and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]-oriented visual novels. ''[[Kanon]]'' was Key's debut release which combined an elaborate and sentimental storyline, an up-to-date [[anime]]-style drawing style and a popular musical score. Key's second game, ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'', was similarly well received in Japan, having a similar if not more complex storyline. Both ''Kanon'' and ''Air'' had non-erotic console ports released for the [[Dreamcast]] and the [[PlayStation 2]]. Key, as of May 2007, has released five games, with a sixth to be released in July 2007. Key has worked in the past with [[Interchannel]], [[Prototype (company)|Prototype]], and [[SoftBank Mobile]] for the consumer port releases of previous Key titles.

Every soundtrack that is released based from one of Key's titles is on a [[record label]] called [[Key Sounds Label]]. There are other albums on the label not directly related to the visual novels, such as two albums by [[Lia (singer)|Lia]] and one by [[Eufonius]]. The albums on this label have music composed by members from Key.

Three of Key's works, ''Kanon'', ''Air'', and ''Clannad'', have been made into [[anime]]. Key supervised the production of these anime while working with two animation studios: [[Toei Animation]] and [[Kyoto Animation]]. Toei Animation animated the first ''Kanon'' TV anime series, the [[Air (film)|''Air'' movie]], and the ''Clannad'' movie. Kyoto Animation animated the ''Air'' TV anime series, the second ''Kanon'' TV anime series, and the ''Clannad'' TV anime series which has yet to be released.

==History==
Before forming Key, the founding members worked for another visual novel development company called [[Tactics (company)|Tactics]]. While employed there, they contributed to three games: ''[[Dōsei]]'', ''[[Moon.]]'' and ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]''. After the release of ''One'', these developers transferred to [[Visual Art's]], where they created their debut title ''[[Kanon]]'' in 1999.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?t=36881&page=3|title=AnimeSuki forums regarding pre-Key Tactics games|accessdate=2006-12-24}}</ref> ''Kanon'' was an [[Hentai|H-game]],<ref name="keyproducts">{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/index.htm|title=Key's product list|accessdate=2007-05-03|language=Japanese}}</ref> though the scenes containing sexual intercourse were kept to a minimum. This gave the player more of a focus on the characters' stories and on the visuals and music which were highly praised, especially for a visual novel at the time of its release. A year later in 2000, Key released their second game ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'', which was also an H-game.<ref name="keyproducts"/> ''Air'' was made to be similar to ''Kanon'' with a compelling storyline and in-depth characterization along with a well-received soundtrack.

In 2001, Visual Art's created the [[record label]] [[Key Sounds Label]].<ref name="ksldisc">{{citeweb|url=http://key.soundslabel.com/discography.htm|title=Key Sounds Label discography|accessdate=2007-05-03|language=Japanese}}</ref> The music albums released by Key after this were put under this label; this does not include the first three albums which were released before the label was officially formed. The first album on this label was ''[[Humanity...]]'', though the only direct connection to Key's works is that it contains a remixed version of the opening theme to ''Air''. The albums under this label are composed by Key's signature [[composer]]s: Jun Maeda, [[Shinji Orito]], and [[Magome Togoshi]]. Three of the albums feature songs sung by [[Lia (singer)|Lia]], and one other, ''[[Love Song (album)|Love Song]]'', features the singer [[Riya]] from [[Eufonius]]. Two [[drama CD]]s have been released as well.<ref name="ksldisc"/>

The third game named ''[[Clannad (visual novel)|Clannad]]'' is a [[dating sim]] similar to Key's previous games, but is entirely clean, without any [[Hentai|adult]] content. ''Clannad'' suffered many delays before its release, leading to a great deal of anticipation from fans. The game finally released in 2004<ref name="keyproducts"/> and, although with more than two years of delay, was still popular. Seven months after ''Clannad'''s release, Key released their shortest game yet, ''[[Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume]]'', in late 2004. ''Planetarian'', in contrast to Key's past games, is a linear visual novel that does not require the user to make a choice, but to sit back and enjoy the story; this is what is referred to as a [[KineticNovel|kinetic novel]]. The company's fifth game was ''[[Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life]]'', an [[Eroge|adult]] game and sequel of sorts to ''Clannad'' released in 2005. Key will release their sixth game, ''[[Little Busters!]]'', in July 2007.<ref name="keyproducts"/>

==Staff==
===Main===
The main staff in Key are members that have had a hand in nearly every game released by Key and do the majority of the work involved. [[Jun Maeda]] has worked on the planning for the individual projects, and is one of the main scenario writers. Starting with ''Tomoyo After'', Jun Maeda was also credited for composing some of the music used in that game as well as with ''Little Busters!''.<ref name="erogamescape">{{citeweb|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/creater.php?creater=938|title=Key staff members at erogamescape.ddo.jp|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> [[Itaru Hinoue]] is Key's main artist and was the art director for Key's first three games.<ref name="hatena">{{citeweb|url=http://d.hatena.ne.jp/keyword/VisualArt%A1%C7s/Key|title=Information on Key|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> [[Na-Ga]], another prominent artist in the company mainly worked with background art in earlier games, but with ''Little Busters!'' was given the position of co-art director with Hinoue.<ref name="littlebusters!">{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/newsoft/products.htm|title=Little Busters! products page|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> Further computer graphics have been provided in the past by Shinory and Mochisuke.<ref name="kanon">{{citeweb|url=http://www7.tok2.com/home/bgr/pc18/kanon/kanon.html|title=Kanon staff information|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> One of Key's main [[composer]]s, [[Shinji Orito]], has been with the company since ''Kanon'', but starting with ''Air'', Key gained another now signature composer &mdash; [[Magome Togoshi]].<ref name="erogamescape"/>

===Other===
In addition to the main staff, there are others who have helped make the games released by Key. Tomotaka Fujii helped write the scenario for ''Air'', working as a scenario assistant.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www7.tok2.com/home/bgr/pc18/air/air.html|title=Air staff information|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> [[Eeji Komatsu]] worked as the art director for the [[KineticNovel|kinetic novel]] ''Planetarian'',<ref name="planetarian">{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/planetarian/|title=Key's official Planetarian website|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> and another artist, [[Fumio]], worked as the art director for ''Tomoyo After''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=5986|title=Tomoyo After staff information|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> Further scenario writers include [[Leo Kashida]], who has been working with Key since ''Tomoyo After'',<ref name="erogamescape"/> Hayato Tonogawa, and Kirio Jō who both started working with Key since ''Little Busters!''.<ref name="littlebusters!"/> Two new composers named Manack and PMMK helped with the music in ''Little Busters!'', and [[MintJam]] helped with arrangement.<ref name="littlebusters!"/>

===Former===
Many of Key's staff have left the company over time. [[Naoki Hisaya]] had worked as one of the main scenario writers for ''Kanon'',<ref name="kanon"/> but once the project was complete left the company to work for another video game company, Siesta.<ref name="hatena"/> Another member of the staff that made ''Kanon'' was [[OdiakeS]], a composer who has since left Key. OdiakeS returned to help in two music albums, one each released for ''Air'' and ''Clannad'', but has done nothing with Key since then.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.beta.or.jp/~odiakes/|title=OdiakeS' personal website|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> One of the staff members for ''Air'', Takashi Ishikawa, only participated in this game as one of the scenario writers, but did not contribute in future games released by Key.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/creater.php?creater=941|title=Takashi Ishikawa's involvement in Key|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> Ishikawa has since moved to another brand in [[Visual Art's]]. Kai, one of the scenario writers, contributed in ''Air'' and ''Clannad'', as did a different scenario writer named Tōya Okano. Kai moved to the company [[Ram (company)|Ram]] under Visual Art's and Okano moved to the company Daikumaneko, also under Visual Art's. Another scenario writer, [[Yūichi Suzumoto]], worked with Key between ''Air'' and ''Planetarian''. Suzumoto has since transferred to [[Leaf (company)|Leaf]] under the publisher Aquaplus. One of the original computer graphics artists, Miracle ☆ Mikipon, left after ''Clannad'', and a different computer graphics artist, Torino, worked with Key from ''Kanon'' until ''Clannad''. Mikipon is now working for [[Psycho (company)|Psycho]] under [[Nexton]], and Torino is now working for Ram under Visual Art's.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.psycho-cop.net/ff.htm|title=Miracle ☆ Mikipon employed by Psycho|accessdate=2007-06-13|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://ram.product.co.jp/5staff.html|title=Torino employed by Ram as a background artist|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref>

==Impact==
Despite the low number of products released, Key has had a large impact on the visual novel industry. Key's first product ''Kanon'' was "heavily hyped [and] had gamers impatient until its release. It was only one game released by Key so far, and yet [it] had already sent major shockwaves around the industry. And yet another game, 2 years later, sent even more shockwaves. ''Air'' was equally hyped and well received."<ref name="bluemist">{{citeweb|url=http://bluemist.animeblogger.net/archives/key/|title=Short Key history|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref>
