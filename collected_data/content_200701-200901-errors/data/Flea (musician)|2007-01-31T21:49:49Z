'''Michael Peter Balzary''' (born [[October 16]], [[1962]]), better known by his [[nickname]]/[[stage name]] '''Flea''', is the [[bassist]] for the [[alternative rock]]/[[funk rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and a frequent [[session musician]] for other music acts.  He has also [[actor|acted]] in a number of [[motion pictures|movies]].

==Early life==
Michael Balzary lived a relatively conventional childhood in [[Melbourne, Australia]], until his father Mick, a customs officer, was posted to [[New York City|New York]] in March 1967. Mick Balzary relocated his entire family to New York, including wife Patricia, his daughter Karen, and 5-year-old Michael. 

In 1971, only four years after arriving in the [[United States|U.S.]], Balzary's mother, Patricia, fell in love with jazz musician Walter Urban, Jr. and filed for divorce from Mick Balzary. Michael Balzary, his mother, sister, and soon-to-be-stepfather moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in 1972. {{Fact|date=January 2007}}

Balzary developed an affinity for [[music]] at a very early age. He first played the [[drums]], then he began the [[trumpet]] at age nine. Balzary displayed strong natural aptitude for the instrument and swiftly earned a place in the Los Angeles Junior Philharmonic Orchestra. 

Watching his stepfather playing with his bebop [[jazz band]] profoundly effected the eleven-year-old Balzary. His stepfather's musicianship inspired a lifelong love of jazz and the leading exponents of the genre, such as [[Miles Davis]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and [[Ornette Coleman]]. On [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'', Balzary confessed that he had no original interest in [[rock and roll]], and that his initial ambition was to become a jazz musician like his stepfather. 

===Fairfax High School===

Balzary was an avid trumpeteer and jazz fan when he began attending [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]] in September 1976. On his first day at Fairfax, Balzary was antagonizing fellow tenth-grade student Tony Shurr in the quadrangle, when  Balzary's future bandmate, [[Anthony Kiedis]], came to Shurr's defense. Despite the initial enmity between the Balzary and Kiedis, the two swiftly became best friends. As their friendship grew, Balzary introduced Kiedis to the world of jazz. 

Balzary continued to improve his trumpet skills, taking the rank of first trumpet in the Fairfax school orchestra. Kiedis admired Balzary for his constantly swollen lip (as noted in Kiedis's autobiography, ''Scar Tissue''). 

Through Kiedis, Balzary became friends with another Fairfax student and future bandmate, [[Hillel Slovak]]. Slovak played in a band called Anthym. Balzary's musical taste strayed from jazz when Slovak introduced him to rock music. Balzary soon became attuned to artists including [[Led Zeppelin]], [[KISS (band)|KISS]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and [[Jimi Hendrix]]. 

Spurred by his newfound interest in rock, Balzary allowed Slovak to tutor him in bass guitar in 1978. Slovak, in concurrence with Anthym's guitarist Alan Mishulsky and drummer [[Jack Irons]], considered the band's existing bassist Todd Strassman to be of sub-standard skill, in contrast to the musical talent he perceived in the other members of the band. One morning Strassman walked into school to find Balzary playing bass using his equipment. Infuriated, Strassman took his equipment and left the band. Balzary officially replaced Strassman, with the encouragement of the band who valued his musical and technical skills.

During a ski trip with Anthony Kiedis and friend Keith Barry, Balzary earned his long-standing nickname "Flea," which has become the singular name associated with the musician. <ref>http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/columns/the_history_of/the_history_of_flea_part_1.html History of the Flea (Accessed on January 21, 2007)</ref>

==Career==
[[Image:Flea in skeleton t-shirt.jpg|thumb|Flea performing with the Red Hot Chili Peppers]]

While playing in [[What Is This?|Anthym]], Flea's exeptional bass skills attracted attention from outside the band. In 1982, Flea received an offer to become the new bass player for [[Fear (band)|Fear]], an aggressive, punk band from the Los Angeles. He accepted the offer, playing for a short period with both bands. 

In 1983, Flea, Kiedis, Slovak, and Irons formed the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. They were signed with EMI within 6 months. Flea left Fear to concentrate on working with the Chili Peppers. Balzary also turned down an offer to play in the post-Sex Pistols band [[Public Image Ltd.]] with his longtime idol, [[John Lydon]], because he preferred to stay with his friends.

===Flea's style and influence===
Flea's unique bass-slapping technique influenced several musicians even before the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] broke into the mainstream. On their breakthrough album ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'', he refused to use the technique, fearing it would be imitated (as stated personally by Flea in the documentary of ''Blood Sugar'', "Funky Monks"). 

Flea's style is influenced by [[Bootsy Collins]], funk music and by the energy of early [[punk rock]] bands such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]].  Flea's slap funk technique is similar to that of [[Les Claypool]] of [[Primus]].

Flea has also aided the careers of several prominent musicians, most notably [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]]. In 1993, Flea met the unknown local artist, after he saw her perform at a local cafe. He went back to her van where she was currently living, where she sang a few of her songs. He described her singing voice as being "beautiful" and "breathtaking". Two years after this encounter Jewel was signed to [[Atlantic Records]] and released her diamond record, ''[[Pieces of You]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Calhoun |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |coauthors=Jensen |title=Revealing Jewel: An Intimate Portrait from Family and Friends |year=2003 |publisher=Atria |location=New York, NY |id=978-0743475402}}</ref>

In the liner notes of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' ''[[Greatest Hits (Red Hot Chili Peppers)|Greatest Hits]]'' compilation, Flea writes: {{cquote|I would like to mention the [[electric bass]] players who have had a huge influence on me and whom I have repeatedly stole from. They are... [[Jah Wobble]], [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], [[James Jamerson|James Jamerson Sr.]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Eric Avery]], [[Aston Barrett|Aston Family Man Barrett]], [[Mike Watt]], [[Andrew Weiss]], [[Peter Hook]], and the bass players for [[Fela Kuti]].}}

===Equipment===

Flea's signature bass up until ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' was the [[Music Man StingRay]]. In the studios for ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' and ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', he used a [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] Mach II and an [[Alembic Inc|Alembic]] Epic, respectively. From ''Californication'' onwards, he received a signature model from [[Modulus Guitars]], which is based on the StingRay. For ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'', he used a '62 [[Fender Jazz Bass|Fender Jazz bass]].

===Trumpet on the side===
Flea still plays trumpet occasionally, for example, as part of a [[horn section]] on the second [[Jane's Addiction]] album, on [[Mike Watt]]'s ''Ball Hog or Tug Boat?'', on [[The Mars Volta]]'s sophomore release ''[[Frances The Mute]]'', and with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] during a performance of ''[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]'' at Hollywood Rock '93, a music festival in Brazil. 

Most recently, he joined [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] on "The Fourth Movement of the Odyssey" for the ''[[Halo 2]]'' soundtrack.  The songs "Subway To Venus", "[[Pretty Little Ditty]]", and "[[Taste the Pain]]" on the Chili Peppers album ''[[Mother's Milk]]'', "[[Apache Rose Peacock]]" on ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'', and "Tear" on ''[[By the Way]]'' also feature Flea on trumpet. Flea also plays trumpet in some of the songs on ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'', namely "Torture Me", "Slow Cheetah", and "Hump De Bump". On occasion, Flea will play trumpet during Peppers' live performances.

===Independent work===
====Solo====
After the release of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' One Hot Minute album, Flea briefly pursued a solo career. While he finally never released an album, a few demos of his song survive, like "You Got Stuck With Me" and "Fiberoptics". Additionally, his song "I've Been Down" was released on the original movie soundtrack for ''[[The Basketball Diaries]]''.

====Session====
In 1982, Flea was the bassist for [[Fear (band)|Fear]] before choosing to stick with the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. He played bass on the hit 1989 single ''Bust a Move'' by [[Young MC]]. He played with Gibby & Andrew Weiss ([[Butthole Surfers]]) and [[Johnny Depp]] in 1995 in a band called [[P (group)|P]] on the 'Michael Stipe' [[7"]]. He played trumpet on Jane's Addiction's ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'', and filled in for [[Eric Avery]] during their reunion tour in 1997. While Flea was not a founding member of Jane's Addiction, he certainly played an important part in their musical history. He co-wrote, produced and continues to this day to perform as the bass player for Jane's Addiction, when his schedule permits. 
He played bass for [[The Mars Volta]] on 2003's ''[[De-Loused in the Comatorium]]'' and trumpet for 2005's ''[[Frances the Mute]]''. He also played bass for [[Alanis Morissette]] on the acclaimed song 'You Oughta Know', as well as guest appearances on countless albums by other artists. Flea has also played in support of the activist group [[Axis of Justice]].

====Acting====
Flea made his acting debut in the 1984 cult classic punk drama ''[[Suburbia (movie)|Suburbia]]'' where he was credited as "Mike B. The Flea." His filmography also includes ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'', ''[[Motorama (film)|Motorama]]'', ''[[Dudes (film)|Dudes]]'', ''[[Son in Law]]'', ''[[The Chase (1994 film)|The Chase]]'', ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', ''The Blue Iguana'', ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', ''Liar's Poker'', ''[[Mr. 3000]]'', and the 1998 remake of the [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] classic ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]''. More notably, Flea played the character "Needles" in ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'', and provided the voice of the [[feral children|feral boy]] Donnie in the animated television series and film ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]''.
