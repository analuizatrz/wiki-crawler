'''Rockell''' (born '''Rachel Alexandra Mercaldo''' on [[March 4]] [[1977]] in [[Long Island]], [[New York]]) is a [[freestyle music]] artist. 

==Profile==
In the late '90s, she had major dance hits with the songs "In A Dream," "When I'm Gone," and "Can't We Try" (a duet with [[Collage (singer)|Collage]] and remake of the [[Dan Hill]] and [[Vonda Shepard]] 1987 hit song). All of these tracks appeared on her 1998 debut album entitled ''What Are You Lookin' At?''. She released a second album, ''Instant Pleasure'', in 2000. 'Instant Pleasure' included the single "What U Did 2 Me" which made #101 pop in 2001.  Her best charting success is in Canada where she is still active performing shows at clubs.  Her debut single "I Fell in love" distributed by the then BMG Canada hit #1 on the Canadian singles charts while the follow-up mega hit "In a Dream" was at #6 and is still a dance club anthem and a favourite amongst freestyle music enthusiasts nationwide.

==Chart Success==
1996's "I Fell In Love" peaked at #61 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1997.  It hit the #1 spot on the Canadian Hot 100 singles chart during that year making it the most successful freestyle dance music single of the decade in Canada.

"In A Dream," the follow-up to "I Fell In Love" peaked at #72 on the Billboard Hot 100 in late 1997. It was #6 on the Hot 100 Canadian singles chart and solidified Rockell's position on the artist roster of the then BMG Music Canada.

"Can't We Try" with Collage peaked at #59 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1998.

"When I'm Gone" bubbled under the hot 100 in 1999.

Rockell's lead off single to her sophomore album 'Instant Pleasure,' "What U Did 2 Me" bubbled under the hot 100 at #101...however, it was her best selling (and arguably biggest hit) single and it garnered her a music video.

She also released "The Dance" (a cover of the Garth Brooks hit) and "Tears," but neither of these singles charted on the Hot 100.

In 2005, she came back with "L.O.V.E.", a limited independent release that had freestyle remixes by Russ Castella and Randy Weber Taylor, the original writer/producer of "In a dream".
