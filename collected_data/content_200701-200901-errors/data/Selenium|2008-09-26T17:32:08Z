'''Selenium''' ({{pronEng|səˈliniəm}}) is a [[chemical element]] with the [[atomic number]] 34, represented by the chemical  symbol '''Se'''. It is a [[nonmetal]], chemically related to [[sulfur]] and [[tellurium]], and rarely occurs in its elemental state in nature. It is toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts of it are necessary for cellular function in most, if not all, animals, forming the active center of the enzymes [[glutathione peroxidase]] and [[thioredoxin reductase]] (which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants) and three known [[deiodinase]] enzymes (which convert one [[thyroid hormone]] to another). Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, with some plants apparently requiring none.<ref name="autogenerated1">http://cals.arizona.edu/arec/pubs/rmg/1%20rangelandmanagement/2%20poisonousplants93.pdf</ref>

Isolated selenium occurs in several different forms, the most stable of which is a dense purplish-gray semi-metal (semiconductor) form that is structurally a trigonal polymer chain. It conducts [[electricity]] better in the light than in the dark, and is used in [[photocell]]s (see allotropic section below). Selenium also exists in many non-conductive forms: a black glass-like allotrope, as well as several red crystalline forms built of eight-membered [[Chemical bond|ring]] molecules, like its lighter chemical cousin sulfur. 

Selenium is found in economic quantities in [[sulfide]] ores such as [[pyrite]], partially replacing the [[sulfur]] in the ore matrix. Minerals that are selenide or selenate compounds are also known, but all are rare.

==Occurrence==
Selenium occurs naturally in a number of inorganic forms, including [[selenide]], [[selenate]] and [[sodium selenite|selenite]]. In soils, selenium most often occurs in soluble forms like selenate (analogous to sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff. 

Selenium has a biological role, and is found in organic compounds such as dimethyl selenide, [[selenomethionine]], [[selenocysteine]] and [[methylselenocysteine]]. In these compounds selenium plays an analogous role to sulfur.

Selenium is most commonly produced from [[selenide]] in many [[sulfide]] [[ores]], such as those of [[copper]], [[silver]], or [[lead]]. It is obtained as a byproduct of the processing of these ores, from the [[anode]] mud of copper refineries and the mud from the lead chambers of [[sulfuric acid]] plants. These muds can be processed by a number of means to obtain free selenium.

Natural sources of selenium include certain selenium-rich soils, and selenium that has been [[bioaccumulation|bioconcentrated]] by certain toxic plants such as [[locoweed]]. Anthropogenic sources of selenium include coal burning and the mining and smelting of sulfide ores.<ref>http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp92-c1.pdf</ref>

==Isotopes==
{{main|isotopes of selenium}}
Selenium has six naturally occurring [[isotope]]s, five of which are stable: <sup>74</sup>Se, <sup>76</sup>Se, <sup>77</sup>Se, <sup>78</sup>Se, and <sup>80</sup>Se. The last three also occur as [[fission products]], along with [[Se-79|<sup>79</sup>Se]] which has a [[halflife]] of 295,000 years, and <sup>82</sup>Se which has a very long half life (~10<sup>20</sup> yr, decaying via double beta decay to [[Krypton|<sup>82</sup>Kr]]) and for practical purposes can be considered to be stable. 23 other unstable isotopes have been characterized.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

''See also [[Selenium-79]]'' for more information on recent changes in the halflife of this fission product important for the dose calculations performed in the frame of the geological disposal of long-lived [[radioactive waste]].

==History and global demand==
Selenium ([[Greek language|Greek]] σελήνη ''selene'' meaning "Moon") was discovered in 1817 by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] who found the element associated with [[tellurium]] (named for the Earth).

Growth in selenium consumption was historically driven by steady development of new uses, including applications in rubber compounding, [[steel]] alloying, and [[selenium rectifiers]].  Selenium is also an essential material in the drums of laser printers and copiers.  By 1970, selenium in rectifiers had largely been replaced by [[silicon]], but its use as a photoconductor in plain paper copiers had become its leading application. During the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although it was still a large end-use) as more and more copiers using organic photoconductors were produced. Presently, the largest use of selenium world-wide is in glass manufacturing, followed by uses in chemicals and pigments. Electronic use, despite a number of continued applications, continues to decline.<ref>http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/selenium/830398.pdf</ref>

In 1996, continuing research showed a positive correlation between selenium supplementation and [[cancer]] prevention in humans, but widespread direct application of this important finding would not add significantly to demand owing to the small doses required. In the late 1990s, the use of selenium (usually with [[bismuth]]) as an additive to [[plumbing]] [[brass]]es to meet no-lead environmental standards, became important. At present, total world selenium production continues to increase modestly.

==Health effects==
Although it is toxic in large doses, selenium is an essential [[dietary mineral|micronutrient]] for animals. In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral, sometimes in toxic proportions in [[forage]] (some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other plants such as [[locoweed]] require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil).<ref name="autogenerated1" /> It is a component of the unusual [[amino acid]]s [[selenocysteine]] and [[selenomethionine]]. In humans, selenium is a [[dietary mineral|trace element]] nutrient which functions as [[cofactor]] for [[redox|reduction]] of [[antioxidant]] enzymes such as [[glutathione peroxidase]]s and certain forms of [[thioredoxin reductase]] found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).

[[Glutathione peroxidase]] (GSH-Px) catalyzes certain reactions which remove reactive oxygen species such as peroxide:

:2 GSH+ H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>---------GSH-Px → GSSG + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O

Selenium also plays a role in the functioning of the [[thyroid]] gland by participating as a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for the three known [[thyroid hormone]] [[deiodinase]]s.<ref>[http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/selenium/ Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Dietary selenium comes from nuts, cereals, meat, fish, and eggs. [[Brazil nut]]s are the richest ordinary dietary source (though this is soil-dependent, since the Brazil nut does not require high levels of the element for its own needs). High levels are found in [[kidney]], [[tuna]], [[crab]] and [[lobster]], in that order.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Barclay |first=Margaret N. I. |authorlink= |coauthors=Allan MacPherson, James Dixon |year=1995 |month= |title=Selenium content of a range of UK food |journal=Journal of food composition and analysis |volume=8 |issue= |pages=307–318 |id=0889-1575|doi=10.1006/jfca.1995.1025 }}</ref><ref> A list of selenium rich foods can be found on [http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h2 The Office of Dietary Supplements Selenium Fact Sheet].</ref>

===Toxicity===
Although selenium is an essential [[dietary mineral|trace element]], it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the [[Dietary Reference Intake|Tolerable Upper Intake Level]] of 400 micrograms per day can lead to [[selenosis]].<ref>[http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h7 Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Selenium<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can result in [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, [[pulmonary edema]] and death.<ref name="tp92-c3">[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp92-c3.pdf DRAFT<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Elemental selenium and most metallic [[selenide]]s have relatively low toxicities because of their low [[bioavailability]]. By contrast, [[selenate]] and [[selenous acid|selenite]] are very toxic, the acute toxicity differs from the chronic toxicity which for selenite the chronic toxic dose for human beings is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day for a long time.<ref>Wilber CG, Toxicology of selenium 1980 Clinical Toxicology volume 17, pages 171-230,(page211).</ref>  , and have an oxidant mode of action similar to that of arsenic. [[Hydrogen selenide]] is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas.<ref>http://www.tc.gc.ca/canutec/erg_gmu/search/guide.asp?Guide=117&Lang=EN</ref> Selenium also occurs in organic compounds such as dimethyl selenide, [[selenomethionine]], [[selenocysteine]] and [[methylselenocysteine]], all of which have high [[bioavailability]] and are toxic in large doses. [[Nanotechnology|Nano]]-size selenium has equal efficacy, but much lower toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhang J, Wang X, Xu T |title=Elemental selenium at nano size (Nano-Se) as a potential chemopreventive agent with reduced risk of selenium toxicity: comparison with se-methylselenocysteine in mice |journal=Toxicol.

[[Selenium poisoning]] of water systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normally dry undeveloped lands. This process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds (such as selenates) into the water, which may then be concentrated in new "wetlands" as the water evaporates. High selenium levels produced in this fashion have been found to have caused certain congenital disorders in wetland birds.<ref>http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~childers/3_31_05%20selenium.pdf</ref>

===Deficiency===
{{main|selenium deficiency}}
Selenium deficiency is relatively rare in healthy well-nourished individuals. It can occur in patients with severely compromised [[intestine|intestinal]] function, those undergoing [[total parenteral nutrition]], and also<ref>[http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/71/2/590 Effect of micronutrient status on natural killer cell immune function in healthy free-living subjects aged >=90 y1 - Ravaglia et al. 71 (2): 590 - American Journal of Clinical...<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> on advanced aged people (over 90). Alternatively, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are also at risk.

===Controversial health effects===

;HIV/AIDS: Some research has indicated a geographical link between regions of selenium deficient soils and peak incidences of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] infection. For example, much of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] is low in selenium. However, [[Senegal]] is not, and also has a significantly lower level of AIDS infection than the rest of the continent. AIDS appears to involve a slow and progressive  decline in levels of selenium in the body. Whether this decline in selenium levels is a direct result of the replication of HIV<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10608913&dopt=Abstract Nutrients and HIV: part one - beta carotene and s...[Altern Med Rev. 1999&#93; - PubMed Result<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> or related more generally to the overall malabsorption of nutrients by AIDS patients remains debated.
: Low selenium levels in AIDS patients have been directly correlated with decreased immune cell count and increased disease progression and risk of death.<ref>[http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h6 Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Selenium<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Selenium normally acts as an [[antioxidant]], so low levels of it may increase oxidative stress on the immune system leading to more rapid decline of the immune system. Others have argued that HIV encodes for the human selenoenzyme [[glutathione peroxidase]], which depletes the victim's selenium levels. Depleted selenium levels in turn lead to a decline in CD4 [[helper T-cell]]s, further weakening the immune system.<ref>http://www.hdfoster.com/index.html#Publications</ref>
: Regardless of the cause of depleted selenium levels in AIDS patients, studies have shown that selenium deficiency does strongly correlate with the progression of the disease and the risk of death.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9342257&dopt=Abstract High risk of HIV-related mortality is associated w...[J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1997&#93; - PubMed Result<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10225235&dopt=Abstract Mortality risk in selenium-deficient HIV-positive ...[J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1999&#93; - PubMed Result<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9481135&dopt=Abstract Micronutrient status in relationship to mortality ...[Nutr Rev. 1998&#93; - PubMed Result<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

;Diabetes: A well-controlled study showed that selenium intake is positively correlated with the risk of developing type II diabetes. Because high serum selenium levels are positively associated with the prevalence of diabetes, and because selenium deficiency is rare, supplementation is not recommended in well-nourished populations such as the U.S.<ref>[http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/30/4/829 Serum Selenium and Diabetes in U.S. Adults - Bleys et al. 30 (4): 829 - Diabetes Care<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Production and allotropic forms==
Selenium is a common byproduct of copper refining, or the production of sulfuric acid.<ref>http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp92-c5.pdf</ref><ref>[http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/34.html Selenium<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Se/key.html Chemistry : Periodic Table : selenium : key information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Isolation of selenium is often complicated by the presence of other compounds and elements. Commonly, production begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide. The selenium dioxide is then mixed with water producing selenous acid. The selenous acid is finally bubbled with sulfur dioxide producing elemental red amorphous selenium. 

Selenium produced in chemical reactions invariably appears as the amorphous red form-- an insoluble brick red powder. When this form is rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form which is usually sold industrially as beads. The most thermodynamically stable and dense form of selenium is the electrically conductive gray (trigonal) form, which is composed of long helical chains of selenium atoms. The conductivity of this form is notably light sensitive. Selenium also exists in three different deep red crystalline monoclinic forms, which are composed of Se<sub>8</sub> molecules, similar to many allotropes of sulfur.<ref>[http://www.chemistryexplained.com/A-Ar/Allotropes.html Allotropes - Group 13, Group 14, Group 15, Group 16<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Non-biological applications==
;Chemistry: Selenium is a catalyst in many chemical reactions and is widely used in various industrial and laboratory syntheses, especially [[Organoselenium chemistry]]. It is also widely used in structure determination of proteins and nucleic acids by X-ray crystallography (incorporation of one or more Se atoms helps with [[Multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion|MAD]] and [[Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion|SAD]] phasing.)

;Manufacturing and materials use: The largest use of selenium world-wide is in [[glass]] and [[ceramic]] manufacturing, where it is used to give a red color to glasses, [[vitreous enamel|enamels]] and [[ceramic glaze|glazes]] as well as to remove color from glass by counteracting the green tint imparted by ferrous impurities.
: Selenium is used with [[bismuth]] in [[brass]]es to replace more toxic [[lead]]. It is also used to improve abrasion resistance in [[vulcanization|vulcanized]] [[rubber]]s.

;Electronics: Because of its [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] and [[photoconductivity|photoconductive]] properties, selenium is used in [[photocopying]], [[photocell]]s, [[light meter]]s and [[solar cell]]s. It was once widely used in [[rectifier]]s. These uses have mostly been replaced by silicon-based devices, or are in the process of being replaced.  The most notable exception is in power DC [[surge protection]], where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than [[metal oxide varistor]]s.
: Sheets of amorphous selenium convert [[x-ray]] images to patterns of charge in [[xeroradiography]] and in solid-state flat panel x-ray cameras.

;Photography: Selenium is used in the [[photographic print toning|toning of photographic prints]], and it is sold as a toner by numerous photographic manufacturers including [[Kodak]] and [[Fotospeed]]. Its use intensifies and extends the tonal range of black and white photographic images as well as improving the permanence of prints.

;[[Nondestructive testing]]: Selenium is a highly effective [[gamma ray|Gamma]] source used in [[Industrial radiography]]{{Fact|date=February 2008}}.

==Biological applications==
;Medical use: The substance loosely called [[selenium sulfide]], '''SeS<sub>2</sub>''', actually selenium disulfide or selenium (IV) sulfide, is the active ingredient in some dandruff shampoos.<ref>[http://pharmacycode.com/Selenium(IV)_sulfide.html Accessed Dec. 25, 2007]</ref> The effect of the active ingredient is to kill the scalp fungus ''[[Malassezia]]'' which causes shedding of dry skin fragments. The ingredient is also used in body lotions to treat [[Tinea versicolor]] due to infection by a different species of ''Malassezia'' fungus.<ref>[http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/selenium.html Selenium sulfide. DermNet NZ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

;Nutrition: Selenium is used widely in [[vitamin]] preparations and other [[dietary supplement]]s, in small doses (typically 50 to 200 micrograms per day for adult humans). Some livestock [[fodder|feed]]s are fortified with selenium as well.


==Evolution in biology== 

Over three billion years ago, blue-green algae were the most primitive oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and are ancestors of multicellular eukaryotic algae.<ref name=venturi>Venturi S, Donati FM, Venturi A, Venturi M. 2000 . Environmental iodine deficiency: A challenge to the evolution of terrestrial life? Thyroid. 10 (8):727-9.</ref> Algae that contain the highest amount of antioxidant selenium, iodide and peroxidase enzymes, were the first living cells to produce poisonous oxygen in the atmosphere. Venturi et al.<ref name=venturi /><ref name=venturi2>Venturi S, Venturi M. Evolution of Dietary Antioxidant Defences. 2007. European Epi-Marker. 11, 3 :1-12.  http://web.tiscali.it/iodio/</ref> suggested that algal cells required a protective antioxidant action, in which selenium and  iodides, through peroxidase enzymes, have had this specific role. Selenium, which acts synergistically with iodine,<ref>Cocchi M, Venturi S. 2000. Selenium and Iodide: ancient antioxidants of cellular membranes? 7th Internat. Symp. on Selenium in Biology and Medicine. Venice (Italy). Abs. P-88 :134</ref> is a primitive mineral antioxidant, greatly present in the sea and prokaryotic cells, where it is an essential component of the family of glutathione peroxidase antioxidant enzymes (GSH-Px). In fact, [[seaweed]]s accumulate high quantity of selenium and iodine.<ref name=venturi /> In 2008, Küpper et al.,<ref>Küpper FC, Carpenter LJ, McFiggans GB, et al. 2008. Iodide accumulation provides kelp with an inorganic antioxidant impacting atmospheric chemistry. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.13;105(19):6954-8.</ref> showed that iodide also scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) in algae, and that its biological role is that of an inorganic antioxidant, the first to be described in a living system, active also in today’s humans.

From about three billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein families drive selenocysteine evolution. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, Archaea and eukaryotes as selenocysteine,<ref name=glady>Gladyshev VN, Hatfield DL. 1999 . Selenocysteine-containing proteins in mammals. J Biomed Sci. 6:151-160.</ref> where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and deiodinase of eukaryotic cells seem to have  a bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurred in green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish and chicken, too. One family of selenium-containing molecules as glutathione peroxidases repairs damaged cell membranes, while another (glutathione S-transferases) repairs damaged DNA and prevents mutations.<ref>Stadtman TC. 1996 . Selenocysteine. Annu Rev Biochem. 65:83-100.</ref> 

When about 500 Mya, plants and animals began to transfer from the sea to rivers and land, the environmental deficiency of marine mineral antioxidants (as selenium, iodine, etc.) was a challenge to the evolution of  terrestrial life.<ref name=venturi /> Trace elements involved in GSH-Px and superoxide dismutases enzymes activities, i.e. selenium, [[vanadium]], [[magnesium]], [[copper]] and [[zinc]], may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineral-deficient areas.<ref name=glady /> Marine organisms apparently retained and sometimes expanded their seleno-proteomes, whereas the seleno-proteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost. These findings suggest that, with the exception of [[vertebrate]]s, aquatic life supports selenium utilization, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element.<ref>Lobanov AV, Fomenko DE, Zhang Y, et al. 2007. Evolutionary dynamics of eukaryotic selenoproteomes: large selenoproteomes may associate with aquatic life and small with terrestrial life. Genome Biol. 8(9):R198.</ref> Marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentra¬tion of selenium and iodine. From about 500 Mya, freshwater  and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of  “new” endogenous antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), polyphenols, flavonoids, tocopherols etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in last 200-50 Mya, in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants. In fact the angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the late [[Jurassic]] period. 

The deiodinase isoenzymes constituted the second family of eukaryotic selenoproteins with identified enzyme function. Deiodinases  are able to extract electrons from iodides, and iodides from iodothyronines. So, are involved in thyroid hormone regulation, participating in the protection of thyrocytes from damage by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced for thyroid hormone biosynthesis.<ref name=venturi /><ref name=venturi2 /> About 200 Mya, new selenoproteins were developed as mammalian GSH-Px enzymes.<ref>Castellano S, Novoselov SV, Kryukov GV, et al.  2004.
