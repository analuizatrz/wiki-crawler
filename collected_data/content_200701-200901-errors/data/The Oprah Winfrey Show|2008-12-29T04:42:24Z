'''''The Oprah Winfrey Show''''' (often simply referred to as '''''Oprah''''') is a [[United States]] [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[talk show]], hosted and produced by its namesake [[Oprah Winfrey]], and is the highest-rated talk show in American television history.<ref>[http://www.kingworld.com/release/oprah_winfrey.html King World press release] Retrieved [[July 3]], [[2006]]</ref> It is currently the longest-running [[daytime television]] talk show in the [[United States]], having run since September 8, 1986, for over 22 seasons and 3,000 episodes (as of September 10, 2007). The show is renewed through 2011, but in a 2007 interview with [[Larry King]], Oprah said that in 2011, she will not renew her contract, thus ending the show.<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Oprah-Ending-2011-58308.aspx Will Oprah Winfrey End Show in 2011?]" ''[[TV Guide]]''. [[November 8]], [[2008]]. Retrieved on [[November 12]] [[2008]].</ref>

''Oprah'' has been included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's shortlist of the best television series of the twentieth century in 1998, and it made the top 50 of ''[[TV Guide]]'''s countdown of the greatest American shows of all time<ref>[http://www.ez-entertainment.net/features/tvguide50.htm Top 50 Greatest Shows Of All Time]</ref> in 2002.

The show is highly influential, especially with [[women]], and many of its topics penetrate into American pop-cultural consciousness. While early episodes of the show followed a [[Phil Donahue]]-style exploration of sensationalistic social issues, Oprah eventually transformed her series into a more positive, spiritually uplifting experience marked by [[Book discussion club|book clubs]], [[celebrity]] interviews, self-improvement segments, and philanthropic forays into world events.

The show began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|High Definition]] beginning with its 2008-09 season premiere episode on September 8, 2008, becoming one of the first nationally-syndicated daytime talk shows to do so. <ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6551268.html The Oprah Winfrey Show to Go HD - 4/14/2008 11:25:00 AM - Broadcasting & Cable<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> That season premiere was broadcast from [[Chicago]]'s [[Millennium Park]] and featured over 175 athletes from the [[U.S. Olympic Team]] including gold-medalists [[Michael Phelps]], [[Misty May-Treanor]], [[Kerri Walsh]], and [[Kobe Bryant]].

== Wildest Dreams ==
One of the show's features in recent years has been the "Wildest Dreams" tour, which fulfills the dreams of people reported to her by producers, found mostly from viewers who write in to the show, be the dream a new house, an encounter with a favorite performer, or a guest role on a popular TV show.

During her nineteenth season premiere (fall 2004), Winfrey surprised her entire [[audience]] by giving them each a [[Pontiac G6]]. Winfrey famously exclaimed, "You get a car! You get a car! You get a car! Everybody gets a car!" It was named as one of the greatest television moments in history by ''[[TV Guide]]''. Although Winfrey may be given credit for giving the cars away, they were donated to her by [[General Motors]] as a [[publicity stunt]]. In 2005, [[Tina Turner]] guest starred, allowing ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' star [[Felicity Huffman]] to fulfill her Wildest Dream of singing backup to Turner. Another included a man named David Caruso who lost 300 pounds after weighing 525 pounds. He came on the show in 2003 and told Oprah that one of his wishes was to sit in a [[Porsche]]. Minutes later, a white 2004 Porsche Boxster S (worth about $63,000) was given to him. Winfrey named this one of her 20 favorite moments on a special DVD set.
==Retirement==
Discovery Chief [[David Zaslav]] said that [[CBS Television Distribution]]’s The Oprah Winfrey Show will depart broadcast syndication in fall 2011, [[Harpo Productions]] isn’t so sure. Zaslav told analysts: “The current expectation is that after fall 2011 her show will go off of …syndication, and she will come to [[OWN]],” the cable network that Winfrey’s production company is creating in conjunction with Discovery. Winfrey’s distribution deal, which she re-signed with [[King World]] (now part of [[CBS Television Distribution]]) in August 2004, expires in fall 2011. That marks the end of Oprah’s 25th season. In a statement issued, Harpo Productions responded: "While David Zaslav's comments are true that Winfrey's current contract to produce The Oprah Winfrey Show will expire in 2011, she has not made a final decision as to whether she will continue her show in syndication beyond that," says Lisa Halliday, chief spokesperson for Harpo Productions, Inc.

In 1997, Winfrey said she was planning to retire, but then renewed her contract through 2002. In 2002, she said she would depart in 2006 – the show’s 20th anniversary year – but in 2004 she ended up re-upping through 2011, after riding a wave of high ratings and a revamped program in 2003. {{Fact|date=November 2008}}

== Interviews ==
[[Image:Oprahfirst.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Winfrey on the first national broadcast of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in 1986.]]
Winfrey has interviewed a plethora of [[political]] and public figures during the past twenty years. In the earlier seasons of the show, rather than offering a simple publicity platform, a celebrity would often feature after a period of intense media scrutiny, such was the case when the model [[Naomi Campbell]] appeared after there were claims she had a substance abuse problem. She often interviews celebrities on issues that directly involve them in some way, such as cancer or charity work.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

Winfrey claims her worst interviewing experience was with [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in the fourth season. The actress refused to talk about her marriages and current relationship, leading to a number of awkward silences. Taylor later apologized and returned in a better mood on Winfrey's couch.

Winfrey's interview with [[Tom Cruise]], which was broadcast on May 23, 2005, has also gained notoriety. Cruise&nbsp;— according to the ''[[The New York Times]]''&nbsp;— "jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell rapturously to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his new girlfriend, [[Katie Holmes]]." This scene quickly became part of American pop-cultural discourse and was heavily parodied in media as diverse as ''[[MADtv]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and the film ''[[Scary Movie 4]]''.

Non-celebrity guests are generally individuals who have been involved in an extraordinary situation. Examples of these include an episode in the fourth season which featured [[Truddi Chase]], a woman with [[Multiple Personality Disorder]] who reported being violently and sexually abused beginning at the age of two. After introducing Chase, who was there to promote her book ''When Rabbit Howls'', Oprah unexpectedly broke down in tears whilst reading the teleprompter, relating her own childhood molestation to that of the guest. Unable to control herself, Winfrey repeatedly asked producers to stop filming. Other non-celebrity appearances include guests who are chosen for being particularly un-fashionable and are given a fashion makeover by renowned style advisers [[Trinny Woodall]] and [[Susannah Constantine]]. 

== Regular segments ==
[[Image:HarpoStudiosOprahMarquee.jpg|thumb|right|Marquee for show, above entrance at [[Harpo Studios]] in [[Near West Side, Chicago]] ]]
;[[Oprah's Book Club]]
:Originally featured a monthly [[book]] highlight, including [[author]] interviews. Its popularity caused featured books to shoot to the top of bestseller lists, often increasing sales by as many as a million copies at its peak. It was suspended in 2002 and returned in 2003, now featuring more [[classic]] works of literature, with reduced selections per season. The old format was reintroduced in September 2005, but her selection of [[James Frey]]'s ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' became controversial due to accusations of falsification. January 2006 saw [[Elie Wiesel]]'s [[Night (book)|Night]] selected; Winfrey even traveled to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] with Mr. Wiesel. The most recent selection is ''[[The Story of Edgar Sawtelle]]'' by [[David Wroblewski]].

;What's The Buzz?
:Winfrey introduces up-and-coming public figures generating industry buzz but not otherwise widely known. In what several media commentators have labelled ''The Oprah Effect'', people appearing on this segment such as Oscar-winner [[Jamie Foxx]] and singer [[James Blunt]] have benefited from the extra publicity the show brings. Blunt in particular saw album sales increase dramatically and a top two spot on the Billboard 200.

;Remember Your Spirit
:Premiering and most popular during the mid-1990s, recurring guest and self described spiritualist [[Iyanla Vanzant]] emphasized the importance of self-affirmation and intrinsic worth.

;[[Oprah's Favorite Things]]
: Usually airs during the holiday shopping season or at the beginning of spring. Items personally favored by Winfrey are given away to the audience. Certain episodes of this type feature select groups of people; in 2005's Christmas edition [[Hurricane Katrina]] volunteer workers appeared in the audience. In November 2006 she opted to hand out credit cards of one-thousand dollars and camcorders to members of her studio audience, who were then told to help others creatively using the money; Winfrey has since called it favorite giveaway ever.

;[[Dr. Oz|Tuesdays With Dr. Oz]]
:Mehmet C. Oz, MD, the Ivy-League educated head of cardiac surgery at [[Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center]] in NYC and better known to millions of Winfrey's viewers as "Dr. Oz",  regularly appears on Tuesdays on the 2008-2009 season of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''.  In 2009, Dr. Oz will debut in first-run syndication with a series co-produced by [[Harpo Productions]] and [[Sony Pictures Television]] and distributed by Sony.

==Other famous moments==

*The surviving members of the [[Little Rock Nine]] confront some former classmates who heckled them on their first day of high school.
*On December 25, 1986, a frail [[Liberace]] made his final public appearance on ''Oprah'', dying six weeks later from [[AIDS]].
* In 1987, Winfrey traveled to all-white [[Forsyth County, Georgia]], which had gained a reputation as being a hotbed for racism. It turned out that a majority of the county actually supported racial integration.
*"The Weight Wagon" episode airing on November 5, 1988, showed Winfrey wheeling out a wagon containing fat, representing the weight she had lost.
*Winfrey was moved to tears by the sight of her fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Mary Duncan, in 1989. She appeared just when Winfrey read her name on the [[teleprompter]].
*The highest-rated single episode ever was in 1993 when [[Michael Jackson]] made a rare appearance on the show, during which he attempted to dispel many of the rumors surrounding him and told Winfrey he suffered from the skin-pigment disorder known as [[vitiligo]].
*[[A. J. McLean]] of the [[Backstreet Boys]] appeared in 2003 with his mother to openly discuss his drug addiction and rehabilitation. Winfrey surprised him with the rest of the band coming out to give him support, making this the first time they appeared together in two years.
*[[Jacqueline Saburido]] a woman who suffered burns on her entire body after a car crash in 1999 appeared in 2003, Winfrey later referred to her as one of her favorite all time guest because of her shining [[inner beauty]]. The drunk driver [[Reginald Stephey]]s mother also appeared on the same show talking to Jacqueline about her sons mistake.

== Ratings ==
The show averages about 8 million viewers per original airing and about 4.5 million for repeats.

== Criticism ==

Some of Winfrey's detractors accuse her show of having a liberal slant; she has championed such liberal causes as the [[living wage]], and featured filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] multiple times on the show.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} A controversial episode, which aired in 2005 (though originally aired to little apparent notice in October 2003), saw guests discussing the sexual act of "[[Anal-oral contact|rimming]]," igniting criticism.  The [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] received a proliferation of complaints from angry parents whose children watched the show in an early-evening slot in many television markets. However, most FCC correspondents were prodded to write by [[Howard Stern]], a noteworthy target of the agency, as well as  [[Jimmy Kimmel]], in an attempt to expose an FCC [[double standard]].<ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0504044oprah1.html FCC Swamped With Oprah Indecency Complaints - May 4, 2004<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://wizbangblog.com/2004/05/05/wizbang-exclusive-oprahs-indecency-fine.php Wizbang Exclusive! - Oprah's Indecency Fine (Wizbang)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Another recent controversy is Winfrey apparently declining to invite Republican vice presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] on her show until the end of the 2008 presidential election cycle. <ref>http://www.nypost.com/seven/09062008/news/nationalnews/palin_clubbed_by_oprah_snub_127736.htm</ref>. However, it is unlikely that Democratic vice presidential candidate [[Joe Biden]], or the presidential candidates would also guest on the show within the last two months of the election, due to FCC requirements requiring [[Equal-time rule|equal time]] for all of the candidates (although [[Phil Donahue]] avoided that issue by getting his show labeled a bona fide news interview show, which provides an exception to Equal-time). Also, after endorsing [[Barack Obama]] for the 2008 presidential election, Winfrey declared that until the election was over she would not invite ''any'' of the presidential ticket candidates on her show. Winfrey, however, has featured Obama on the show twice, in 2005 and 2006, prior to his announcement that he was running for President.

In the late 1990s, on a discussion of [[mad cow disease]], Winfrey stated that the disease fears had "stopped me cold from eating another burger!" Texas cattle ranchers considered that quote tantamount to [[libel]], and promptly sued her. As a result of the legal proceedings, the show was forced to move to [[Amarillo, Texas]] for a period of approximately one month, and furthermore, because of a [[gag order]], Winfrey was not allowed to even mention the trial on her show. Winfrey was acquitted of all charges.

== YouTube ==
Winfrey created a YouTube channel in November 2007, at [http://www.youtube.com/oprah youtube.com/oprah] that showcases some clips of her show and other relevant video features that are pertinent to a show's subject when aired.

== Cultural references ==
{{Unreferenced|date=June 2008}}{{Trivia|date=June 2008}}
* On the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] show ''[[Drake and Josh]]'', Winfrey is mentioned many times by Josh; he even has an autographed picture and a life-size cardboard cut out.  In one episode, Josh accidentally hits Oprah with his car.
* On the Nickelodeon show ''[[All That]]'', Winfrey and her talk show are lampooned on several occasions -- the program is known as ''Okrah!'' therein.
* On ''[[The Simpsons]]'', there is a talk show called ''Opal''. However, the real Oprah once "interviewed" [[Marge Simpson]] in a specially animated segment.
* On ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', Will Smith and his family attend a broadcasting on the show.
* On ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'', they have a spoof of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' that's called ''Hoping with Hoprah''.
* On the Disney show ''[[The Proud Family]]'', Sugar Mama appears on ''Oprah'' because of her lemon bars.
* In the now cancelled [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Hot Properties]]'', the focus is on four single women professionals, each with distinct personalities that contribute in their failure to secure dates and above all, their shared passion for ''Oprah''. One episode focuses entirely on the cast's quest to attend ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' being frustrated when one of the tickets gets lost. The episode ends with the cast meeting [[Gayle King]] in an elevator. King appears on the show as herself.
* In a recent episode of the program, Oprah quoted a post from her message board, inadvertently repeating the "over 9000" meme from 4chan.
