The first simple, sea dwelling organic structures appeared about 3,400 million years ago. It is considered that they may have formed when certain chemical (organic) molecules joined together. [[Prokaryote]]s, single-celled micro-organisms like blue green algae, were able to photosynthesize and produce [[oxygen]]. Around thousand million years later, sufficient oxygen had built up in the [[atmosphere]] and hence it allow multicellular organisms to proliferate in the Precambrian seas.Soft-bodied jellyfish , corals, and sea worms flourished about 700 Million years ago. Trilobites, the first animals with hard body frames, developed during the Cambrian period. About 363 million years ago amphibians came into existence. It was only after the appearence of reptiles that were independent of water.

{{main|Origin of life}}
The details of the origin of life are unknown, though the broad principles have been established. It has been proposed that life, or at least organic components, may have arrived on [[Earth]] from space (see “[[Panspermia]]”), while others argue that terrestrial origins are more probable. The mechanisms by which life would initially arise are nevertheless held to be similar.<ref name="Scientific-American-panspermia">{{cite journal

Somehow, in the energetic chemistry of early Earth, a molecule (or even something else) gained the ability to make copies of itself–the replicator. The nature of this molecule is unknown, its function having long since been superseded by life’s current replicator, [[DNA]]. In making copies of itself, the replicator did not always perform accurately: some copies contained an “error.” If the change destroyed the copying ability of the molecule, there could be no more copies, and the line would “die out.” On the other hand, a few rare changes might make the molecule replicate faster or better: those “strains” would become more numerous and “successful.” As choice raw materials (“food”) became depleted, strains which could exploit different materials, or perhaps halt the progress of other strains and steal their resources, became more numerous.<ref name="Dawkins-Ancestors-563">{{cite book

There is currently no method of determining which of these models, if any, closely fits the origin of [[life on Earth]]. One of the older theories, and one which has been worked out in some detail, will serve as an example of how this might occur. 

The high energy from volcanoes, [[lightning]], and [[ultraviolet radiation]] could help drive chemical reactions producing more complex molecules from simple compounds such as [[methane]] and [[ammonia]].<ref name="Fortey-38">{{cite book

All this continued for a very long time, with reactions occurring more or less at random, until by chance there arose a new molecule: the [[replicator]]. This had the bizarre property of promoting the chemical reactions which produced a copy of itself, and [[evolution]] began properly. 

Other theories posit a different replicator. In any case, DNA took over the function of the replicator at some point; all known life (with the exception of some viruses and [[prions]]) use DNA as their replicator, in an almost identical manner (see ''[[genetic code]]'').

Secondly, the diversity of life is not a set of completely unique organisms, but organisms that share morphological similarities. Thirdly, vestigial traits with no clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits, and finally, that organisms can be classified using these similarities into a hierarchy of nested groups.

Past species have also left records of their evolutionary history.

== Life before Cambrian ==
{{Main|Precambrian}}
The '''Precambrian''' extends from 4.6 billion years ago to the beginning of the [[Cambrian]] Period (about 570 [[annum|Ma]]).
It is not known when life originated, but carbon in 3800 million year old rocks from islands of western [[Greenland]] may be of organic origin.  Well-preserved bacteria older than 3460 million years have been found in [[Western Australia]].  Probable fossils 100 million years older have been found in the same area.  There is a fairly solid record of bacterial life throughout the remainder of the [[Precambrian]].  <ref name=prelifefm>{{cite web

Excepting a few contested reports of much older forms from [[Texas]] and [[India]], the first complex multicelled life forms seem to have appeared roughly 600 [[annum|Ma]].  A quite diverse collection of soft-bodied forms is known from a variety of locations worldwide between 542 and 600 [[annum|Ma]]. These are referred to as ''[[Ediacaran biota|Ediacaran or Vendian biota]]''. Hard-shelled creatures appeared toward the end of that timespan.

A very diverse collection of forms appeared around 544 [[annum|Ma]], starting in the latest Precambrian with a poorly understood ''[[small shelly fauna]]'' and ending in the very early Cambrian with a very diverse, and quite modern ''[[Burgess shale|Burgess fauna]]'', the rapid radiation of forms called the ''[[Cambrian explosion]]'' of life.

== Life during Phanerozoic ==

=== Paleozoic life ===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
[[image:Asaphiscuswheelerii.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Trilobites]] flourished throughout the lower Paleozoic era until becoming extinct in the [[Permian]] period]]
The '''Paleozoic''' spanned from roughly 542 [[mya (unit)|mya]] to roughly 251 mya ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004).
The Paleozoic covers the time from the first appearance of abundant, hard-shelled [[fossil]]s to the time when the [[continent]]s were beginning to be dominated by large, relatively sophisticated reptiles and relatively modern [[plant]]s. The lower (oldest) boundary was classically set at the first appearance of creatures known as [[trilobite]]s and [[archeocyathid]]s. The upper (youngest) boundary is set at a major [[extinction event]] 300 million years later, known as the [[Permian extinction]]. Modern practice sets the older boundary at the first appearance of a distinctive [[trace fossil]] called ''[[Trichophycus pedum]]''.

At the start of the era, life was confined to [[Ediacaran biota|Ediacaran fauna]].
There is some evidence that simple life may already have invaded the land at the start of the Paleozoic, but substantial plants and animals did not take to the land until the Silurian and did not thrive until the Devonian. Although primitive [[vertebrate]]s are known near the start of the Paleozoic, animal forms were dominated by [[invertebrate]]s until the mid-Paleozoic. [[Fish]] populations exploded in the Devonian. During the late Paleozoic, great [[forest]]s of primitive plants thrived on land forming the great [[coal]] beds of [[Europe]] and eastern North America. By the end of the era, the first large, sophisticated reptiles and the first modern plants ([[conifer]]s) had developed.

=== Mesozoic life ===
{{Main|Mesozoic}}
The '''Mesozoic''' extended roughly from 251 [[Mya (unit)|Ma]] to 65 Ma ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004).
The extinction of nearly all animal species at the end of the [[Permian]] period allowed for the [[adaptive radiation|radiation]] of many new lifeforms.  In particular, the extinction of the large [[herbivore|herbivorous]] and [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[dinocephalia]] left those [[ecological niche]]s empty. Some were filled by the surviving [[cynodont]]s and [[dicynodont]]s, the latter of which subsequently became extinct. [[Animal]] life during the Mesozoic was dominated, however, by large [[Archosaur|archosaurian]] [[reptile]]s that appeared a few million years after the Permian extinction: [[dinosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and aquatic reptiles such as [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, and [[mosasaur]]s.

The climatic changes of the late Jurassic and Cretaceous provided for further adaptive radiation. The Jurassic was the height of archosaur diversity, and the first [[bird]]s and [[Eutheria|placental mammal]]s also appeared. [[Flowering plant|Angiosperms]] radiated sometime in the early Cretaceous, first in the [[tropics]], but the even temperature gradient allowed them to spread toward the poles throughout the period. By the end of the Cretaceous, angiosperms dominated tree floras in many areas, although some evidence suggests that [[biomass]] was still dominated by [[cycad]] and [[fern]]s until after the KT extinction.

Some have argued that [[insect]]s diversified with angiosperms because insect [[anatomy]], especially the [[mouth]] parts, seems particularly well-suited for flowering plants. However, all major insect mouth parts preceded angiosperms and insect diversification actually slowed when they arrived, so their anatomy originally must have been suited for some other purpose.

As the temperatures in the seas increased, the larger animals of the early Mesozoic gradually began to disappear while smaller animals of all kinds, including [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, and perhaps the ancestor [[mammal]]s to [[primate]]s, evolved. The KT extinction exacerbated this trend. The large archosaurs became extinct, while birds and mammals thrived, as they do today.

=== Cenozoic life ===
{{Main|Cenozoic}}
The '''Cenozoic''' era covers the 65.5 million years since the [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event]].
The Cenozoic is the '''age of new life'''. During this era, mammals diverged from a few small, simple, generalized forms into a diverse collection of terrestrial, marine, and flying animals.
As the [[dinosaur]]s perished at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period, the [[mammal]]s took center stage. The mammals are the largest land animals of the Era, as the dinosaurs had been during the Mesozoic.

Dating of important boundaries, and description of faunal successions, should thus be regarded with some degree of caution until better data become available.


=== Ordovician-Silurian extinction events ===
{{Main|Ordovician-Silurian extinction events}}
[[Image:Extinction Intensity.png|thumb|300px|right|The Ordovician-Silurian extinction event, labeled "End O" here.]]

The extinctions occurred approximately 444–447 million years ago and mark the boundary between the [[Ordovician Period|Ordovician]] and the following [[Silurian Period]]s.  During this extinction event, which may have been composed of several distinct closely spaced events, there were several marked changes in biologically responsive [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope]]s, which may indicate separate events or particular phases within one event. 

At that time most complex [[multicellular organism]]s lived in the sea, and around 100 marine [[Scientific classification|families]] became extinct, covering about 49%<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rohde & Muller|year=2005|title=Cycles in Fossil Diversity|journal=Nature|volume=434|pages=208-210|id={{doi|10.1038/nature03339}}|issue=7030}}</ref> of [[genus|genera]] of [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] (a more reliable estimate than species). The [[brachiopod]]s and [[bryozoan]]s were decimated, along with many of the [[trilobite]], [[conodont]] and [[graptolite]] families.

Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions  than by a decrease in [[speciation]].<ref>{{Citation | last=Bambach | first=R.K. | last2=Knoll | first2=A.H. | last3=Wang | first3=S.C. | title=Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity | journal=Paleobiology | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=522–542 | date=December 2004 | url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&issn=0094-8373&volume=30&page=522}}</ref>

it is harder to produce such detailed statistics for land, river, swamp and lake environments because good Permian-Triassic rock sequences from terrestrial environments are extremely rare (the [[Karoo|Karoo basin]] is by far the best). 

Even so, there is enough evidence to indicate that:- 
* Over two-thirds of terrestrial [[amphibian]], [[sauropsid]] ("reptile") and [[therapsid]] ("mammal-like reptile") [[Family (biology)|families]] became extinct. 
* Large herbivores suffered the heaviest losses. 
* All Permian [[anapsid]] reptiles died out except the [[Procolophonidae|procolophonid]]s ([[testudines]] have anapsid skulls but are most often thought to have evolved later, from [[diapsid]] ancestors).<ref>Maxwell, W.

=== Late Devonian extinction ===
{{Main|Late Devonian extinction}}
The Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems, including the [[stromatoporoid]]s, and the [[rugosa|rugose]] and [[tabulate coral]]s. The reef system collapse was so severe that major reef-building (effected by new families of carbonate-excreting organisms, the modern scleractinian  corals) did not recover until the Mesozoic era. 

The late Devonian crash in [[biodiversity]] was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the [[Cretaceous]]: a recent survey (McGhee 1996) estimates that 22 percent of all the ''[[Family (biology)|families]]'' of marine animals (largely [[invertebrate]]s) were eliminated, the category of families offering a broad range of real structural diversity. Some 57 percent of the [[Genus|genera]] went extinct, and&mdash;the estimate most likely to be adjusted&mdash;at least 75 percent of the species did not survive into the following [[Carboniferous]]. The estimates of species loss depend on surveys of marine taxa that are perhaps not well enough known to assess their true rate of losses, and for the Devonian it is not easy to allow for possible effects of differential preservation and [[sampling bias]]es. Amongst the severely affected marine groups were the [[brachiopod]]s, [[trilobite]]s, [[ammonite]]s, [[conodont]]s, and [[acritarch]]s, as well as [[Agnatha|jawless fish]], and all [[placoderm]]s. Freshwater species, including our [[tetrapod]] ancestors, were less affected. 

=== Triassic-Jurassic extinction event ===
{{Main|Triassic-Jurassic extinction event}}
[[Image:Triassic-jurassic boundary.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ranges of families tetrapods through the Triassic and Early Jurassic.]]

The '''Triassic-Jurassic extinction event''' occurred 200 million years ago and is one of the major [[extinction event|extinction events]] of the [[Phanerozoic]] eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans.  20% of all marine families and all large [[Crurotarsi]] (non-dinosaurian [[archosaur|archosaurs]]), some remaining [[therapsid|therapsids]], and many of the large [[Amphibia|amphibians]] were wiped out.  At least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time went extinct.  This event opened an [[ecological niche]] allowing the [[dinosaur|dinosaurs]] to assume the dominant roles in the [[Jurassic]] period.

=== Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event ===
{{Main|Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event}}
[[Image:Impact event.jpg|thumb|300px|Artist's impression of a major impact event. The collision between Earth and an [[asteroid]] a few kilometers in diameter may release as much energy as several million nuclear weapons detonating.]]
The '''Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event''' was the catastrophic mass [[extinction]] of extant animal species in a comparatively short period of time, approximately 65.5 [[mya (unit)|million years ago]].
Most, if not all, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s became extinct during or possibly a few years after the event.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Favstovsky, D.E., and Sheehan, P.M.|date=2005|url=http://www.gsajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1130%2F1052-5173%282005%29015%3C4%3ATEOTDI%3E2.0.CO%3B2|title=The extinction of the dinosaurs in North America|journal=GSA Today|volume=15|issue=3|pages=4–10|accessdate=2007-05-18|doi=10.1130/1052-5173(2005)015%3C4:TEOTDI%3E2.0.CO;2}}</ref> Non-avian dinosaur fossils are not found later than the K–T boundary, except for a few controversial exceptions.  Many other groups of animals and plants, including [[mosasaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and some [[invertebrate]]s, also became extinct at the K–T boundary. The event marks the end of the [[Mesozoic]] Era, and the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] Era.

Most of the extinctions occurred in a relatively short time because extensive weather changes reduced [[photosynthesis]], thereby decreasing the amount of plant material available to [[herbivore|herbivorous animals]].  This change in food supply caused a massive disruption in Earth's ecology.

Despite the severity of the K–T extinction event, there was significant variability in the rate of extinction of different classes of organisms.  Organisms which depended on [[photosynthesis]] became extinct or suffered heavy losses due to reduced [[sunlight]].  [[photosynthesis|Photosynthesizing]] organisms, from [[plankton]] (e.g. [[coccolithophorids]]) to land [[plant]]s, formed the primary part of the food chain in the late Cretaceous.  [[Herbivores|Herbivorous]] animals, which depended on plants and plankton as their food, died out as their food sources became scarce; consequently, top [[predators]] such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' also began dying.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilf, P & Johnson KR|title=Land plant extinction at the end of the Cretaceous: a quantitative analysis of the North Dakota megafloral record|journal=Paleobiology|date=2004|volume=30|issue=3|pages=347–368|doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030%3C0347:LPEATE%3E2.0.CO;2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Keller, G & MacLeod, N|date=1996|title=Cretaceous–Tertiary Mass Extinctions: Biotic and Environmental Changes |publisher=WW Norton & Company|isbn=978-0393966572}}</ref>  
Animals which built [[calcium carbonate]] shells (for example, coccolithophorids along with many groups of [[mollusc]]s, including [[ammonite]]s, [[rudist]]s, [[freshwater snail]]s and [[mussel]]s), as well as organisms whose [[food chain]] depended on these [[calcium carbonate]] shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses.

Most omnivores, insectivores and [[carrion]]-eaters appear to have survived quite well. At the end of the Cretaceous there seem to have been no purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals. Many mammals, and the birds which survived the extinction, fed on [[insect]]s, [[larva]]e, [[worm]]s, snails, etc., which in turn fed on dead plant matter. They may have survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they lived in "[[Detritus (biology)|detritus]]-based" food chains.<ref name="SheehanHansen">{{cite journal| last =Sheehan| first =Peter| authorlink =| coauthors =Thor A.

In [[stream]] [[Biocoenosis|communities]] few groups of animals became extinct. Stream communities tend to rely less on food from living plants and more on detritus that washes in from land. This may have buffered them from extinction.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Major extinctions of land-dwelling vertebrates at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, eastern Montana|author=Sheehan, PM & Fastovsky, DE|date=1992|journal=Geology|volume=20|issue=6| pages=556–560|url=http://www.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/georef/1992034409|accessdate=2007-06-22}}</ref> Similar, but more complex patterns have been found in the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the [[Pelagic zone|water column]], than among animals living on or in the sea floor.

The largest air-breathing survivors, [[crocodilian]]s and [[champsosaur]]s, were semi-aquatic. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and can survive for months without food. Modern crocodilian young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. This has been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the Cretaceous.<ref name="SheehanHansen"/>

=== Holocene extinction event ===
{{Main|Holocene extinction event}}
[[Image:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Dodo]], a bird of Mauritius, became extinct during the mid-late [[17th century]] after humans destroyed the [[forest]]s where the birds made their homes and introduced animals that ate their eggs.]]
The '''Holocene extinction event''' is a name customarily given to the widespread, ongoing [[mass extinction]] of [[species]] during the modern [[Holocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]. The large number of extinctions span numerous families of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s  including [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[arthropod]]s; a sizeable fraction of these extinctions are occurring in the [[rainforest]]s.  Because the rate of this [[extinction event]] appears to be much more rapid than the "Big Five" mass extinctions, it is also known as the '''Sixth Extinction'''.  Since 1500 AD, 784 extinctions have been documented by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]].<ref>2006 version of IUCN redlist, http://www.iucn.org/bookstore/HTML-books/Red%20List%202004/completed/Executive%20Summary.html</ref>  However, since most extinctions are likely to go undocumented, scientists estimate that during the last century, between 20,000 and two million species have become extinct, but the precise total cannot be determined more accurately within the limits of present knowledge.  Up to 140,000 species per year (based on [[Species-area theory]])<ref>S.L. Pimm, G.J. Russell, J.L. Gittleman and T.M. Brooks, ''The Future of Biodiversity'', Science 269: 347-350 (1995)</ref> may be the present rate of extinction based upon upper bound estimating.

In broad usage, the Holocene extinction event includes the notable disappearance of large [[mammal]]s, known as [[megafauna]], by the end of the [[last ice age]] 9,000 to 13,000 years ago.  Such disappearances have been considered as either a response to climate change, a result of the [[overpopulation|proliferation]] of [[modern human]]s, or both.  These extinctions, occurring near the [[Pleistocene]] / Holocene boundary, are sometimes referred to as the ''[[New World Pleistocene Extinctions|Pleistocene Extinction Event]]'' or Ice Age extinction event.  However the Holocene extinction event continues through the events of the past several millennia and includes the present time.

The observed rate of extinction has accelerated dramatically in the last 50 years, to a pace greater than the rate seen during the Big Five.  There is no general agreement on whether to consider more recent extinctions as a distinct event or merely part of a single escalating process.  Only during these most recent parts of the extinction have [[plant]]s also suffered large losses. Overall, the Holocene extinction event is most significantly characterised by the presence of man-made driving factors and its very short [[geological timescale]] (tens to thousands of years) compared to most other extinction events.

=== Prokaryote ===
{{Main|Prokaryote}}
It is generally accepted that the [[origin of life|first living cells]] were some form of prokaryote and may have developed out of '''[[protobionts]]'''. Fossilized prokaryotes approximately 3.5 billion years old have been discovered, and prokaryotes are perhaps the most successful and abundant organism even today. In contrast the eukaryote only appeared between approximately 1.7 and 2.2 billion years ago.<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/askexpert_question.cfm?articleID=000C32DD-60E1-1C72-9EB7809EC588F2D7&catID=3&topicID=3 Scientific American], October 21, 1999</ref> While Earth is the only known place in the universe where life exist, some have suggested structures within a Martian [[meteorite]] should be interpreted as fossil prokaryotes; this is open to considerable debate and skepticism. 

Prokaryotes diversified greatly throughout their long existence. The metabolism of prokaryotes is far more varied than that of [[eukaryote]]s, leading to many highly distinct types of prokaryotes.  For example, in addition to using [[photosynthesis]] or organic compounds for energy like eukaryotes do, prokaryotes may obtain energy from inorganic chemicals such as [[hydrogen sulfide]].

=== Eukaryote ===
{{Main|Eukaryote}}
[[Image:Fiveking.PNG|thumb|right|175px|The original, now outdated, five-kingdom system.]]
The origin of the eukaryotic cell was a milestone in the evolution of life, since they include all complex cells and almost all multi-cellular organisms.  The timing of this series of events is hard to determine; Knoll (1992) suggests they developed approximately 1.6 - 2.1 billion years ago.  Fossils that are clearly related to modern groups start appearing around 1.2 billion years ago, in the form of a [[red algae#Fossil record|red alga]].

[[rRNA]] trees constructed during the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]] left most eukaryotes in an unresolved "crown" group (not technically a true [[crown group|crown]]), which was usually divided by the form of the mitochondrial cristae.  The few groups that lack mitochondria branched separately and so the absence was believed to be primitive, but this is now considered an artifact of [[long branch attraction]] and they are known to have lost them secondarily.

Trees based on [[actin]] and other molecules have painted a different and more complete picture.  Most eukaryotes are now included in several supergroups:

Several authorities recognize two larger clades, the [[unikont]]s and the [[bikont]]s, the unikonts deriving from an ancestral uniflagellar organism, and the bikonts deriving from an ancestral biflagellate.  In this system, the opisthokonts and amoebozoans are considered unikonts, and the rest are considered bikonts.  The chromists and alveolates may be part of a larger group that is ancestrally photosynthetic, called the [[chromalveolate]]s, but this remains contentious.  Some small protist groups have not been related to any of these supergroups, in particular the [[centrohelid]]s.
Eukaryotes are closely related to [[Archaea]], at least in terms of nuclear DNA and genetic machinery, and are placed by some, along with the Archaea, in the clade [[Neomura]].  In other respects, such as membrane composition, they are similar to [[Bacteria|eubacteria]].  Three main explanations for this have been proposed:

* Eukaryotes resulted from the complete fusion of two or more cells, the cytoplasm forming from a eubacterium and the nucleus from an archaeon ([[Viral Eukaryogenesis|alternatively]] a virus).
* Eukaryotes developed from Archaea, and acquired their eubacterial characteristics from the proto-mitochondrion.
* Eukaryotes and Archaea developed separately from a modified eubacterium.

The final hypothesis is currently the most accepted.
The origin of the endomembrane system and mitochondria are also disputed.  The '''phagotrophic hypothesis''' states the membranes originated with the development of endocytosis and later specialized; mitochondria were acquired by ingestion, like plastids.  The '''syntrophic hypothesis''' states that the proto-eukaryote relied on the proto-mitochondrion for food, and so ultimately grew to surround it; the membranes originate later, in part thanks to mitochondrial genes (the [[hydrogen hypothesis]] is one particular version).

=== Viruses ===
{{Main|Viruses}}
The origins of modern viruses are not entirely clear. It may be that no single mechanism can account for all viruses. They do not [[fossil]]ize well, so [[Molecular biology|molecular techniques]] have been the most useful means of hypothesising how they arose. Research in [[microfossil]] identification and molecular biology may yet discern fossil evidence dating to the [[Archean]] or [[Proterozoic]] [[eon (geology)|eons]]. Two main hypotheses currently exist.<ref name="prescott">{{cite book | title=Microbiology| last=Prescott| first=L| date=1993| publisher=Wm. C. Brown Publishers| id=0-697-01372-3}}</ref> 

Small viruses with only a few [[gene]]s may be runaway stretches of nucleic acid originating from the genome of a living organism. Their genetic material could have been derived from transferable genetic elements such as [[plasmid]]s or [[transposon]]s, which are prone to moving within, leaving, and entering genomes.

Viruses with larger genomes, such as [[poxvirus]]es, may have once been small cells which parasitised larger host cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitic lifestyle would have been lost in a streamlining process known as ''retrograde-evolution'' or ''reverse-evolution''. The bacteria [[Rickettsia]] and [[Chlamydia]] are living cells that, like viruses, can only reproduce inside host cells. They lend credence to the streamlining hypothesis, as their parasitic lifestyle is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a host cell.

It is hypothetically possible that viruses represent a primitive form of self replicating DNA and are a precursor to life as it is presently defined.

== Evolution of asymmetry ==

Features of the [[symmetry (biology)|symmetry]] are determined by the type of environment under which the organism has evoloved. Maximal extent of organism symmetry corresponds to a completely isotropic [[ecological niche]]. 

First organisms on [[Earth]] floating in the depths of water (unicellular and lower multicellular organisms) have the maximum possible spherical symmetry. They appeared approximately 3.5 billion years ago. Asymmetrization along the ''top–bottom'' axis occurred under the influence of [[gravity]]. This led to the appearance of the attached, low-mobility forms (plants and coelenterates) that had radial symmetry. 

Asymmetrization along the ''front–back'' axis occurred due to the interaction with space, when rapid motion was required (to escape from the predator, or to chase a prey). As a result, the main [[receptor]]s and the [[brain]] were moved to the front of the body. Organisms with bilateral symmetry were dominating last 650-800 million years. These are [[crustacean]]s, [[fish]] as well as the most progressive forms, i.e., [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[insect]]s.

Each transition changes one axis from symmetry to asymmetry with triaxial asymmetry placed at the end of the array (spherical → radial → bilateral → triaxial).

The trend towards asymmetrization can be followed in phylogeny of plant organs ([[flower]], [[leaf]], [[fruit]]s, and [[seed]]s). It is known, that zygomorphic (bilateral symmetry) flowers are evolutionary more progressive, than actinomorphic (radial symmetry) flowers, but are less progressive, than triaxial asymmetric ones. The morphology of a leaf during evolution follows the same picture- spherical symmetry of [[chlorella]], radial symmetry of pine needles, bilateral symmetry of Magnolia leafs, and triaxial asymmetry of Begonia or Elms leafs. The same trend can be found in embryogenesis—spherical zygote, radial gastrula, bilateral embryo and triaxial asymmetric child.

The scientific study of [[human evolution]] encompasses the development of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', but usually involves studying other [[hominidae|hominids]] and [[homininae|hominines]] as well, such as ''[[Australopithecus]]''. "Modern humans" are defined as the ''Homo sapiens'' [[species]], of which the only extant [[subspecies]] is ''Homo sapiens sapiens''; ''[[Homo sapiens idaltu]]'' (roughly translated as "elder wise man"), the other known subspecies, is extinct.<ref>[http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/projects/human/# Human evolution: the fossil evidence in 3D], by Philip L.

The closest living relatives of ''Homo sapiens'' are the two species of [[chimpanzee]]: the [[Bonobo]] (''Pan paniscus'') and the [[Common Chimpanzee]] (''Pan troglodytes''). These species are equally close (they share the same common ancestor), the main difference between them is the social organization: [[matriarchal]] for the Bonobo and [[patriarchal]] for the Common Chimpanzee. Full [[genome]] sequencing resulted in the conclusion that "after 6.5 [[million]]&nbsp;years of separate evolution, the differences between bonobo/chimpanzee and human are just 10 times greater than those between two unrelated people and 10 times less than those between rats and mice". In fact, 98.4% of the DNA sequence is identical between the two ''Pan'' species and human.<ref>[[Frans de Waal]], ''Bonobo''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997.

There are two prominent scientific theories of the origins of contemporary humans. They concern the relationship between modern humans and other hominids. The [[recent single-origin hypothesis|single-origin]], or "out-of-Africa", hypothesis proposes that modern humans evolved in Africa and later [[human migration|migrated]] outwards to replace hominids in other parts of the world. The [[multiregional hypothesis]], on the other hand, proposes that modern humans evolved, at least in part, from independent hominid populations.<ref>Eswaran, Vinayak, Harpending, Henry & Rogers, Alan R. ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WJS-4G3SC6X-1/2/aae7c2810f0d87628e228363c0e1bd66 Genomics refutes an exclusively African origin of humans]'', Journal of Human Evolution, In Press, Corrected Proof, retrieved [[May 6]], [[2005]].</ref>

Geneticists Lynn Jorde and [[Henry Harpending]] of the [[University of Utah]] proposed that the variation in human DNA is minute compared to that of other species, and that during the [[Late Pleistocene]], the human population was reduced to a small number of breeding pairs — no more than 10,000 and possibly as few as 1,000 — resulting in a very small residual gene pool. Various reasons for this hypothetical bottleneck have been postulated, the most popular being the [[Toba catastrophe theory]].

Human evolution is characterized by a number of important physiological trends, including the [[encephalization|expansion]] of the [[Cranial capacity|brain cavity]] and brain itself, which is typically 1,400&nbsp;cm³ in volume, over twice that of a chimpanzee or gorilla. The pattern of human postnatal brain growth differs from that of other apes ([[heterochrony]]), allowing for an extended period of social learning and [[language acquisition]] in juvenile humans. [[Physical anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] argue that a reorganization of the structure of the brain is more important than cranial expansion itself. Other significant evolutionary changes included a reduction of the [[canine tooth]], development of bipedal locomotion, and the descent of the [[larynx]] and [[hyoid bone]], making speech possible. How these trends are related and what their role is in the evolution of complex social organization and culture are matters of ongoing debate.<ref>Boyd, Robert & Silk, Joan B. (2003).
