'''Lymeswold cheese''' was an [[England|English]] [[cheese]] variety. Many English cheeses are named after regions, however Lymeswold is not the name of a place, although it may have been derived from the place name [[Wymeswold]]. The cheese was a soft, mild blue cheese, much like [[Brie cheese|Brie]], and was inspired by [[France|French]] cheeses. It was similar to non-branded cheeses sold as [[Blue Brie]]. For the export market, the cheese was branded '''Westminster Blue''', because people had difficulty pronouncing Lymeswold.

==Origins==
In [[1979]] the [[Milk Marketing Board]] initiated negotiations with the large dairy firm [[Unigate]] that led in [[1981]] to the restructuring of its processing and marketing activities under the [[Dairy Crest]] brand to use surplus milk production to make dairy products.  The initiatives that followed included the launch in [[1982]] of Lymeswold cheese. The cheese was at first produced at Cannington creamery in Somerset where the manager at the time was Mr R.P. Savage. The cheese's creation was hailed by [[Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester|Peter Walker]], then [[Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food|Agriculture Minister]], who said it would improve the balance of payments by replacing imports and becoming "one of our most successful cheese exports."

==Rise and Fall==
Following heavy launch promotion and a very successful [[brand]]ing exercise, initial demand for Lymeswold outstripped supply. It has been suggested that the Board then released maturing stocks before they were ready, which gave the cheese a reputation for poor quality. Certainly the initial success of the cheese did not turn into steady long-term sales. It was later subjected to strong competition from [[Cambozola]], a German cheese.  In the end, the cheese ceased production in [[1992]]. [[Dairy Crest]] said at the time that it "could not sustain demand." [[John Withley]], then the [[restaurant]] [[critic]] of the [[Daily Telegraph]], welcomed the news with "unfettered joy," saying it had always been "an artificial cheese."

==Continued influence==
The name Lymeswold has lived on as one of many running jokes in [[Private Eye]]. As it is well known that Lymeswold is not a real location, the word is also sometimes used for the name of a generic fictitious English place.
