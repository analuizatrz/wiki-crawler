'''Paramore''' is a [[Fueled By Ramen]] band from [[Franklin, Tennessee]].

== History ==
The Franklin, Tennessee-based band Paramore was formed by three members: brothers Zac and Josh Farro, and Hayley Williams. At the age of 13, Williams moved from her hometown of Meridian, Mississippi to the Nashville suburb, where she met the brothers. In the next few years, Paramore would begin to perform at venues outside the greater Nashville area, including the concert festivals [[Purple Door]] and [[Warped Tour]]. In April 2005, after being seen only once by a record executive for the music label [[Fueled by Ramen]], the band was offered a contract to produce a major market CD.

Paramore's first United States headlining tour kicked off on [[August 2]], [[2006]], leading them across the country and ending with a hometown show in Nashville, Tennessee. They also toured the United Kingdom from [[October 5]], [[2006]] to [[October 15]], [[2006]], where they ended in London at The [[Mean Fiddler]].

Paramore's future touring plans for 2007 include their second United States headlining tour, which includes a spot on The Bamboozle in New Jersey, from [[April 20]], [[2007]] to [[May 19]], [[2007]].

In March, 2007, Paramore announced through a [[livejournal]] update that Hunter Lamb had left the band to be with his fiancée.

==All We Know Is Falling==

On [[July 26]], [[2005]], the band released their first album, ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]''. As of  [[January 27]], [[2007]], the album has sold 81,332 copies.
