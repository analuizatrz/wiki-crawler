'''Salinas''' is the [[county seat]] and largest municipality of [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. The most current estimate from the California Department of Finance, places the 2006 population at 148,350,<ref name="California Department of Finance, 2006 population estimate">{{cite web|url=http://www.dof.ca.gov/HTML/DEMOGRAP/ReportsPapers/Estimates/E1/documents/E-1table.xls|title=California Department of Finance, 2006 population estimate|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> showing a small decline since 2000. The largely suburban city is located at the mouth of the [[Salinas Valley]] roughly eight miles from the [[Pacific Ocean]] and enjoys a mild climate. The climate is also ideal for the floral industry and grape vineyards planted by world-famous vintners. Salinas is known for being an agricultural center as well as being the hometown of famed writer and Nobel prize laureate [[John Steinbeck]].
==History ==
Salinas began around 1856 as the Halfway House, a stagecoach stop between [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]. In 1867, a post office was established, Salinas City was laid out, and the city was incorporated ten years later. The city was named after the word for Salty Marsh in Spanish, ''[[Salinas River (California)|salinas]].

Salinas' economy is largely based on [[agriculture]]. Located in one of California's richest [[farming]] regions, the area produces a variety of [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, including [[lettuce]], [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[watermelon]]s, [[broccoli]], [[carrot]]s, [[cabbage]]s and [[spinach]]. Therefore many major vegetable producers are headquartered in Salinas. The historic prevalence of [[row crop]]s is documented by [[aerial photograph]]ic interpretation of Earth Metrics,<ref>Earth Metrics Inc., ''Aerial photographic interpretation for Salinas, California'' and ''Environmental Assessment for Canada Mobile Estates, Salinas, California'', January 1990</ref> which study also indicated a major conversion of cropland to [[Urban area|urban]] uses over the time period 1956 to 1968,<ref>U.S.G.S. Map May 14,1956 ABG-6R-5, #75 1:20,000</ref><ref>U.S.G.S. Map June 13,1968 GS-VBZK-2-224, #214 1:30,000</ref> with that trend continuing for the next decades as well.

Salinas was also the [[birthplace]] of [[writer]] and Nobel Prize laureate [[John Steinbeck]]. The recently revitalized [[historic]] downtown, featuring much fine Victorian [[architecture]], is home to the [[National Steinbeck Center]] by Kasavan Architects, Executive Architect, the Steinbeck House (open weekdays) and the [[John Steinbeck Library]]. The city is currently{{when}} meeting with a group of local businesspeople who have received preliminary approval for a plan to build a mixed-use development on the site of the old Cominos Hotel which was torn down in the early 1990s due to [[earthquake]] damage. The plan calls for a high-rise hotel, conference facilities, retail and condominiums. Plans to restore the old [[Chinatown]], which featured in John Steinbeck's novel ''[[East of Eden]]'', just north of downtown, began in March 2007 with a vision of mixed uses emphasizing walkable neighborhoods, affordable and workforce housing, social services, retail and public green spaces.

Widewaters Near-Downtown Development Proposal
This proposal anticipates the potential development of new municipal facilities; city hall, police station, library and other governmental uses, combined with new commercial locations and new residential components in a multi-block area located two streets westward of the central city downtown area of the 100/200/300 blocks of Main Street (Oldtown area).

The primary properties to be considered for redevelopment include many City of Salinas parcels, buildings, and parking facilities. As many as five city blocks could be effected by this new redevelopment plan. The City of Salinas is currently in the process of establishing an exclusive negotiating agreement with the Widewaters Group.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Sunset Marina.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Sunset at Salinas River State Beach]].
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 22.8&nbsp;square miles (52.5&nbsp;km²), all of it land.

The city lies approximately 18 meters (59 ft) above sea level and is located roughly eight miles from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[Gabilan Mountains|Gabilan]] and [[Santa Lucia Mountains|Santa Lucia]] mountain ranges border the Salinas Valley to the east and west, respectively. Both mountain ranges and the Salinas Valley run approximately {{convert|90|mi|km|0}} south-east from Salinas towards [[King City, California|King City]].

== Demographics ==
[[Image:Salinas Income copy.png|thumb|300px|Map of income distribution in Salinas.<ref name = "US Census Bureau, Income Map"/>]]
At the 2005 [[census]]{{GR|2}}, there were 150,061 people, 39,297 households and 31,025 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 7,948.4 per square mile (3,068.1/km²). There were 39,659 housing units at an average density of 2,086.8/sq&nbsp;mi (805.5/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 44.10% [needs edit, probably "24.41%"] [[Hispanic]], 65.16% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 5.90% [[Asian American]], 3.27% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 1.26% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] out of which 49.2% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.6% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 14.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 21.6% were non-families. 17.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 6.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.69 and the average family size was 4.08.

Age distribution was 32.0% under the age of 19 or younger, 11.8% from 18 to 24, 33.7% from 25 to 44, 15.5% from 45 to 64, and 7.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 28 years. For every 100 females there were 117.7 males. For every 102 females age 18 and over, there were 117.4 males.

The median household [[income]] was $43,728, and the median family income was $44,669. Males had a median income of $35,641 versus $27,013 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $14,495. About 12.8% of families and 16.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 20.1% of those under age 18 and 9.4% of those age 65 or over.

Median household income in the city tended to be significantly higher alongside the city limits, especially in the northern Harden Ranch and Creekbridge neighborhoods. East Salinas and the downtown area suffered from a very low median household income as well as high crime rates. South and North Salinas featured roughly the same level of median households income with the latter being home to city's wealthiest newly constructed neighborhoods.<ref name="US Census Bureau, Income Map">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ThematicMapFramesetServlet?_bm=y&-tree_id=403&-_MapEvent=zoom&-errMsg=&-_useSS=N&-_dBy=150&-redoLog=false&-_zoomLevel=4&-tm_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_M00024&-tm_config=|b=50|l=en|t=403|zf=0.0|ms=thm_def|dw=0.3778881864165808|dh=0.22403586680110513|dt=gov.census.aff.domain.map.EnglishMapExtent|if=gif|cx=-121.6414055|cy=36.6865445|zl=5|pz=5|bo=|bl=|ft=350:349:335:389:388:332:331|fl=403:381:204:380:369:379:368|g=16000US0664224|ds=DEC_2000_SF3_U|sb=50|tud=false|db=150|mn=0|mx=83123|cc=1|cm=1|cn=7|cb=|um=Dollars|pr=0|th=DEC_2000_SF3_U_M00024|sf=N|sg=&-PANEL_ID=tm_result&-_pageY=&-_lang=en&-geo_id=16000US0664224&-_pageX=&-_mapY=&-_mapX=&-_latitude=&-_pan=&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-_longitude=&-_changeMap=Identify|title=US Census Bureau, Income Map|accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref>

== Economy ==
Salinas is known as the ''Salad Bowl of America'' or ''Salad Bowl of the World''. Over 80% of the [[lettuce]] grown in the [[United States]] is grown in the [[Salinas Valley]]. The city's labor force is 54.6% blue collar and 45.4% white collar. According to the 2000 US Census, 24% of the population worked in sales and office occupations,  21.4% worked in management, professional, and related occupations, 16.2% worked in service occupations, 14.9% worked in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, 14.4% worked in production, transportation, and material moving occupations, and 9.1% worked in construction, extraction, and maintenance occupations.

=== City funding ===
During the first half of this decade, the Salinas city government struggled to deal with funding shortages. A downturn in the state economy, combined with an unusually low per-capita tax base, forced the city to curtail certain services. During the crisis, Salinas almost became the first city in the [[United States]] to close its [[public library|libraries]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&s_site=mercurynews&p_multi=SJ&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1069151548E5C8E1&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title= Salinas prepares to shut libraries, a first in state|last=Beck|first=David L.|date=November 21, 2004| work=San Jose Mercury News|page=1B|accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>  However, private donations provided an ample stop-gap measure, keeping the libraries open with reduced hours. Donations were raised through [[Rally Salinas!]], a grassroots fundraising organization launched by the city's mayor, to keep the libraries open through 2005.

In November 2005, voters approved a tax measure to fund several vital services in the city, including libraries, by a 61 percent vote. The measure, known locally as Measure V, will provide some $11 million in funding to take effect in the 2007 fiscal year. The measure will allow the city to start restoring more than $15 million in service cuts including the closure of three recreation centers and the elimination of graffiti abatement and crossing guard money for schools. An independent oversight committee was appointed by the City Council to oversee the money raised by the tax increase, which will be in place for the next 10 years. In April 2006, the committee recommended dedicating 70% of revenues to restoring library and police services.

In 2006, the city's financial situation was considerably improved, as Salinas officials announced a budget surplus. In July 2007, library restoration had progressed enough to increase opening hours to 117 (across the three branches), which was the number before the budget cuts but only 68% of the system's peak of 171. In late July, the city announced the hiring of a new library director who declared a long-term goal of opening the system 7 days a week, which was achieved in October 2008. Various community groups, including Friends of the Salinas Public Library and the Salinas Library Commission, are championing the effort for reinvention of the library system to improve and expand services.

=== Housing/ Prices ===
In 2005, Salinas was ranked as the least affordable city in the United States. According to Alen Tugend, writing for the ''[[New York Times]]'', "in 2005, the least-affordable place in the country to live, measured by the percentage of income devoted to mortgage payments, was Salinas, Calif."<ref name="Tugend">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/realestate/07california.html|title=Tugend, A. (May 7, 2005). "The Least Affordable Place to Live? Try Salinas." ''The New York Times''.|accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref> While the [[Household income in the United States|median household income]] in Salinas remains near the national median at $50,165,<ref name="US Census Bureau, Salinas median household income">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=16000US0664224&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP32&-ds_name=D&-_lang=en|title=US Census Bureau, Salinas median household income|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> the median home price in the city has risen to $560,600<ref name="US Census Bureau, US Census Bureau, Salinas 2005 demographical profile">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=Search&geo_id=&_geoContext=&_street=&_county=Salinas&_cityTown=Salinas&_state=04000US06&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&pctxt=fph&pgsl=010|title=US Census Bureau, US Census Bureau, Salinas 2005 demographic profile|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>. The large discrepancy between household income levels and the median home price is largely due to a surge in house prices in the coastal California. Between 2004 and 2005, home prices within the city rose by 23.3%.<ref name="Money Magazine, Salinas median home price">{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bpretire/2006/snapshots/PL0664224.html|title=Money Magazine, Salinas median home price|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> The city has seen double digit growth in its median home prices each consecutive year between 2000 and 2005. During the [[2000 US Census]], the median asking price for a home was $229,000.<ref name="US Census Bureau, median home price asked during the 2000 Census">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=16000US0664224&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTH6&-ds_name=D&-_lang=en&-redoLog=false|title=US Census Bureau, median home price asked during the 2000 Census|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> Since then home prices have risen by $326,000 (142%) to over a half-million dollars. Household income, however, only rose a relatively modest 16.27%.<ref name="US Census Bureau, Salinas median household income, 2000 Census">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=16000US0664224&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP32&-ds_name=D&-_lang=en&-redoLog=false|title=US Census Bureau, Salinas median household income, 2000 Census|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> Today Salinas has a far higher median home price than considerably more [[Affluence in the United States|affluent]] communities such as [[Bellevue, Washington]] with a median home price of $405,000 and a [[median household income]] of $88,432.<ref name="Bellevue, WA median home price and income">{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2006/snapshots/PL5305210.html|title=Bellevue, WA median home price and income|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> As of 2006, the city's median household income remained 8.6% above the national median of $46,000, while the median home price had risen to 232.68% above the national median of $167,500.<ref name="US Census Bureau, US Census Bureau, Salinas 2005 demographical profile"/>

However, in the aftermath of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], home prices are in the process of returning to some semblance of affordability. The real estate research website [[Zillow]]'s data shows that, as of mid-2008, home prices in Salinas had returned to early 2004 levels, eliminating nearly all of the appreciation of the speculative bubble peak years.

A planned major redevelopment project located in the eastern portion of the central city area is anticipated to include more than 50 acres of currently developed properties. This project, as proposed, will offer mixed-use environment for residential, retail, services, commercial, office space and municipal uses.

===Crime===
[[Image:Salinas Crime.jpg|thumb|400px|The homicide rate since 1985 for Salinas, Sacramento and the US total.]]
One of the city's most serious problems are the [[Crime in the United States|violent crime-gangs]]. While the city's current violent crime rate is above the national average, historic trends suggest improvement. The number of [[aggravated assault]]s fell from 844 in 1993 to 661 in 1998. In 2004, there were 11.4 murders per 100,000 residents, more than twice the national average of 5.5. In 2005, however, the city's [[homicide]] rate decreased dramatically to a record low of 4.96 homicides per 100,000 persons, approximately 15% below national average where it remained for 2006. But in 2007 there were 14 homicides.<ref name = "FBI uniformed crime report statistics, Salinas, 2005"/> Overall the rate of homicides per 100,000 persons has remained largely stagnant since the mid 1980s, having returned from its record high levels in mid and late 1990s.<ref name="US Bureau of Justice Statistics, [[Violent Crime]] in Salinas since 1985">{{Cite web|url=http://bjsdata.ojp.usdoj.gov/dataonline/Search/Crime/Local/RunCrimeJurisbyJuris.cfm|title=US Bureau of Justice Statistics, Violent Crime in Salinas since 1985|accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref><ref name="US Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Vioent Crime Rates">{{cite web|url=http://bjsdata.ojp.usdoj.gov/dataonline/Search/Crime/State/RunCrimeStatebyState.cfm|title=US Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Vioent Crime Rates|accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref>

== Weather ==
[[Image:Las Palmas Snow.jpg|thumb|right|250px|On March 10, 2006, a record breaking storm covered many of the nearby mountain tops in a white blanket of snow.  Snow in the city of Salinas is extremely rare.]]
Salinas enjoys cool and moderate temperatures due to the "natural [[air conditioner]]" that conveys ocean air and fog in from the [[Monterey Bay]] to Salinas while towns to the north and south of Salinas experience hotter summers as mountains block the ocean air. Thus Salinas weather is closer to that of the [[Central Coast of California]] rather than that of inland valleys and thus enjoys a mild [[Mediterranean climate]] with typical daily highs ranging from the low 50s (°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) in the winter to the low 70s (°F) in the summer. The difference between ocean and air temperature also tends to create heavy morning fog during the summer months (known as the [[marine layer]]) driven by an onshore wind created by the local high pressure sunny portions of the Salinas Valley which extend north and south from Salinas and the Bay.

The average annual rainfall for the city is approximately 14.4 [[inch|in]]. Occasionally there is snowfall on the peaks of the Gabilan and Santa Lucia mountain ranges, but snow in the city itself is extremely rare, occurring about once every 10-20 years on average.

== Arts and Culture ==
Salinas boasts an emerging arts scene led by the First Fridays Art Walk [http://www.artistasunidos.org/Fridays.htm] and the innovative use of non-traditional or business venues to exhibit art and host live local music. The oldest gallery in Salinas, the Valley Art Gallery, has been active for over 30 years. The Hartnell College Gallery hosts world-class exhibitions of art during the school year. The National Steinbeck Center [http://www.steinbeck.org/MainFrame.html] has two galleries with changing exhibits, and the city's newest @Risk Gallery features cutting-edge and visionary exhibitions. The Art Walk, held in the downtown area, features 50 venues.

Live theater companies in Salinas include Ariel Theatrical [http://www.arieltheatrical.org/] located in the Wilson's Children's Theater in Oldtown Salinas, and the Western Stage [http://www.westernstage.com/], a professional company associated with Hartnell Community College.

Live local music is available at many restaurants in the downtown area, and during the First Fridays Art Walk. Concerts are held at the historic Fox California Theater [http://www.foxtheatersalinas.com/], Sherwood Hall and the [[Salinas Sports Complex]] [http://www.salinassportscomplex.com/], as well as at Hartnell Community College [http://www.hartnell.edu/].

Salinas is home to many public murals, including work by John Cerney [http://www.johncerney.com/] which can be viewed in the agricultural fields surrounding the city. [[Claes Oldenburg]] [http://www.oldenburgvanbruggen.com/] placed his sculpture, ''Hat in Three Stages of Landing'', in Sherwood Park at the center of the city.

The airport terminal is located on Mortensen Avenue and houses airport office staff as well as professional offices. The city is currently accepting proposals for leasing and operation of the restaurant located within the Terminal. Salinas Airport Commissioners agreed to a proposed project that would bring a 100-room hotel, offices and hangars to a vacant lot in front of the Salinas Municipal Airport terminal. The Salinas Jet Center would include a national chain hotel, {{convert|80000|sqft|m2|-3}} of office space, four large complexes combining more offices with airplane hangars and a 24-hour, full-service plane-fueling station. The project would also include a taxiway to allow planes to access the new hangars.

The airport has full [[Instrument Landing System]] (ILS) and [[VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR) located on the airport. The ILS has a Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System, with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights. The VOR approach has Runway End Identifier Lights. All but the ILS runway, RWY 31, have Visual Approach Slope Indicators (VASIs).
