'''Arthropods''' ([[Scientific classification|Phylum]] '''Arthropoda''', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:ἄρθρον|ἄρθρον]], meaning [[joint]] and [[wikt:ποδός|ποδός]], meaning [[foot]]) are the largest [[phylum]] of [[animal]]s and include the [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and others. More than 80% of described living animal species are arthropods&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |author=Anna Thanukos |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/arthropodstory |title=The Arthropod Story |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}</ref>, with over a million modern species described and a [[fossil record]] reaching back to the late [[proterozoic]] era. Arthropods are common throughout marine, freshwater, terrestrial, and even aerial environments, as well as including various [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] and [[parasite|parasitic]] forms. They range in size from microscopic [[plankton]] (~¼&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]) up to forms several [[metre]]s long. The largest living arthropod is the [[Japanese spider crab]], with a leg span up to 3½&nbsp;[[metre|m]] (12&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), and some prehistoric arthropods were even larger, such as ''[[Pterygotus]]'' and ''[[Arthropleura]]''.

Arthropods are characterised by the possession of a [[Segment (biology)|segment]]ed body with [[appendage]]s on each segment. They have a [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] heart and a [[ventral nervous system]]. All arthropods are covered by a hard [[exoskeleton]] made of [[chitin]], a [[polysaccharide]], which provides physical protection and resistance to [[desiccation]]. Periodically, an arthropod sheds this covering when it [[ecdysis|moults]].

== Basic arthropod structure ==

The success of arthropods is related to their hard '''[[exoskeleton]]''', segmentation, and jointed [[appendage]]s. The appendages are used for feeding, sensory reception, defense, and locomotion. The muscle system is more or less assisted by hydraulics originated from the blood pressure created by the heart&nbsp;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mspiderhydraulic.html |title=Do spiders have hydraulic legs? |publisher=[[The Straight Dope]] |date=[[2004-09-27]]}}</ref>. The hydraulic system in spiders is especially well developed.

[[Aquatic animal|Aquatic]] arthropods use [[gills]] to exchange gases. These gills have an extensive [[surface area]] in contact with the surrounding water. [[Terrestrial animal|Terrestrial]] arthropods have internal surfaces that are specialised for [[gas exchange]]. Insects and most other terrestrial species have [[invertebrate trachea|trachea]]l systems: air sacs leading into the body from pores called [[spiracles]] in the epidermis [[cuticle]]. Others use [[book lungs]], or [[gills]] modified for breathing air as seen in species like the [[coconut crab]]. Some areas of the legs of [[soldier crab]]s are covered with an oxygen absorbing membrane. The [[gill chamber]]s in terrestrial crabs sometimes have two different structures: one that is gilled and used for breathing underwater, and another specially adapted to take up oxygen from the air (a pseudolung).

Arthropods have an [[Circulatory system#Open circulatory system|open circulatory system]]. [[Haemolymph]] containing [[haemocyanin]], a [[copper]]-based oxygen-carrying protein, is propelled by a series of hearts into the body cavity where it comes in direct contact with the tissues. Arthropods are [[protostome]]s. There is a [[body cavity|coelom]], but it is reduced to a tiny cavity around the reproductive and excretory organs, and the dominant body cavity is a [[hemocoel|haemocoel]], filled with [[hemolymph|haemolymph]] which bathes the organs directly. The arthropod body is divided into a series of distinct segments, plus a pre-segmental ''acron'' which usually supports [[compound eyes|compound]] and simple eyes and a post-segmental ''[[telson]]''. These are grouped into distinct, specialised body regions called ''tagmata''. Each segment, at least primitively, supports a pair of [[appendage]]s.

The cuticle in arthropods forms a rigid [[exoskeleton]], composed mainly of [[chitin]], which is periodically shed as the animal grows. They contain an inner zone (procuticle) which is made of protein and chitin and is responsible for the strength of the exoskeleton. The outer zone (epicuticle) lies on the surface of the procuticle. It is nonchitinous and is a complex of [[proteins]] and [[lipids]]. It provides the moisture proofing and protection to the procuticle. The exoskeleton takes the form of plates called ''sclerites'' on the segments, plus rings on the appendages that divide them into segments separated by joints. This is in fact what gives arthropods their name — jointed feet — and separates them from their relatives, the [[Onychophora]] and [[Tardigrada]], also called [[Lobopoda]] (and which is sometimes included in a group called [[Panarthropoda]] that also includes arthropods). The exoskeletons of arthropods strengthen them against attack by predators and are impermeable to water. In order to grow, an arthropod must shed its old exoskeleton and secrete a new one. This process, [[ecdysis]], is expensive in terms of energy, and during the moulting period, an arthropod is vulnerable.

==Classification of arthropods==
[[Image:Common_blue_damselfly02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Common Blue Damselfly]] (''Enallagama cyathigerum''), an insect]]
Arthropods are typically [[scientific classification|classified]] into five [[subphylum|subphyla]], of which one is extinct&nbsp;<ref>{{ITIS|ID=82696|taxon=Arthropoda|date=August 15|year=2006}}</ref>:
# '''[[Trilobite]]s''' are a group of formerly numerous marine animals that died in the [[extinction event|mass extinction]] at the end of the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]].
# '''[[Chelicerata|Chelicerates]]''' include [[spider]]s, [[mite]]s, [[scorpion]]s and related organisms. They are characterised by the presence of [[chelicerae]].
# '''[[Myriapoda|Myriapods]]''' comprise [[millipede]]s and [[centipede]]s and their relatives and have many body segments, each bearing one or two pairs of legs. They are sometimes grouped with the hexapods.
# '''[[Hexapoda|Hexapods]]''' comprise [[insect]]s and three small orders of insect-like animals with six thoracic legs. They are sometimes grouped with the myriapods, in a group called [[Uniramia]], though genetic evidence tends to support a closer relationship between hexapods and crustaceans.
# '''[[Crustacean]]s''' are primarily marine (a notable exception being [[woodlouse|woodlice]]) and are characterised by having [[Arthropod leg#Biramous and uniramous|biramous]] appendages. They include [[lobster]]s, [[crab]]s, [[barnacle]]s, and many others.

Shaded taxa are parts of the subphylum [[Crustacea]].]]

Aside from these major groups, there are also a number of fossil forms including  [[anomalocarid]]s and [[Euthycarcinoidea|euthycarcinoids]]&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/rhynie/euthy.htm |title=The Rhynie Chert Euthycarcinoids |publisher=[[University of Aberdeen]] |accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref>, mostly from the lower [[Cambrian]], which are difficult to place, either from lack of obvious affinity to any of the main groups or from clear affinity to several of them.

The phylogeny of the arthropods has been an area of considerable interest and dispute. The validity of many of the arthropod groups suggested by earlier authors is being questioned by recent studies; these include [[Mandibulata]], [[Uniramia]] and [[Atelocerata]]. The most recent studies tend to suggest a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] Crustacea with different hexapod groups nested within it&nbsp;<ref name="Hassanin"/><ref>{{cite journal |quotes=no |title=The position of crustaceans within Arthropoda &mdash; Evidence from nine molecular loci and morphology |author=Giribet, G., S. Richter, G. D. Edgecombe & W. C. Wheeler |year=2005 |journal=Crustacean Issues |volume=16 |pages=307–352 |url=http://www.amonline.net.au/palaeontology/pdf/giribet-etal2005.pdf}}</ref>. The remaining clade of Myriapoda and Chelicerata is referred to as [[Paradoxopoda]] or [[Myriochelata]].

Since the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] recognises no priority above the rank of family, many of the higher groups can be referred to by a variety of different names&nbsp;<ref name="Campbell">{{cite web |url=http://www.peripatus.gen.nz/Taxa/Arthropoda/Index.html |author=Campbell, Reece & Mitchell |title=Arthropoda |date=[[2006-07-30]]}}</ref>.

==Evolution ==
[[Image:31-Velvet Worm.JPG|thumb|left|A [[velvet worm]]]]
Arthropods are thought to have branched from an ancestor of the segmented worms during the [[Pre-Cambrian]] era&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=Valentine, James W. |year=1989 |title=Bilaterians of the Precambrian-Cambrian Transition and the Annelid-Arthropod Relationship |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.]] |volume=86 |pages=2272–2275 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/86/7/2272}}</ref>. [[Velvet worms]] (Onychophora) are a good example of what it is imagined that their ancestors looked like, and their similarity to caterpillars and millipedes is thought to be not entirely coincidental&nbsp;<ref name="Campbell"/>. The common ancestral arthropod, though, apparently happened to be one that had evolved not just chitinous mouthparts like other segmented worms, but also a chitinous structure all over its body; with all arthropods, the segments have become distinct (at least in larvae), each covered with one or more plate, and with legs, or limbs, one pair per segment.

At one point, it was believed that the different subphyla of arthropods had separate origins from segmented worms, and in particular that the [[Uniramia]] were closer to the Onychophora than to other arthropods. However, this is now rejected by most biologists, and is contradicted by genetic studies.

Arthropods are grouped together with two similar phyla ([[Tardigrada]] and Onychophora) to form the monophyletic group [[Panarthropoda]].

Traditionally the [[Annelida]] have been considered the closest relatives of these three phyla, on account of their common segmentation. More recently, however, this has been considered  [[convergent evolution]], and the arthropods and allies may be more closely related to certain [[body cavity|pseudocoelomates]] such as [[roundworm]]s that share with them growth by moulting, or [[ecdysis]]. These two possible lineages have been termed the [[Articulata]] and [[Ecdysozoa]].

A proposed phylogeny of the arthropods after Nielsen is as follows&nbsp;<ref>{{cite book |author=Nielsen, C. |year=2001 |title=Animal Evolution: Interrelationships of the Living Phyla. Second Edition |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], Oxford |id=ISBN 978-0-19-850681-2}}</ref>:
