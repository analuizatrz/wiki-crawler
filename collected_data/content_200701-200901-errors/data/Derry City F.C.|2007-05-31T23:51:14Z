'''Derry City Football Club''' ({{lang-ga|'''Cumann Peile Chathair Dhoire'''}}, {{IPA2|kʊmən̪ˠ pɛlʲə xahəɾʲ ɣɛɾʲə}}) are an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The club play in the [[FAI Premier Division]], the top tier of league football in the [[Republic of Ireland]], and are the only participating club from Northern Ireland. They play at the [[Brandywell]] and wear red and white striped shirts. Their nickname, '''the Candystripes''', derives from their colours. Others refer to the club as '''the Red and White Army''' or abbreviate the name to '''Derry''' or '''City'''.

The club, founded in 1928, initially played in the [[Irish League]] &mdash; the domestic league in Northern Ireland &mdash; and won a league title in 1964&ndash;65. In 1971, security concerns related to the [[Troubles|unrest in Northern Ireland]] at that time meant that matches could not be played at the Brandywell, and the team played "home" fixtures 30 miles away in [[Coleraine]]. Security forces withdrew their objections to the use of the Brandywell the following year, but in the face of insistence from the Irish League that the unsustainable arrangement continue, the club withdrew from the league. After 13 years in junior football, they joined the [[League of Ireland|League of Ireland's]] new First Division for 1985&ndash;86. Derry won the First Division title and achieved promotion to the Premier Division in 1987, and have remained there since. The club went on to win a domestic [[The Treble|treble]] in 1988&ndash;89 and the Premier Division again in 1996&ndash;97.

{{main|History of Derry City F.C.}}
===Founding and the Irish League era===
Founded in 1928, Derry City decided against using the official title of the city — [[Derry-Londonderry name dispute|Londonderry]] — in their name. [[Irish nationalists|Nationalists]] refer to the city as "Derry", while [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionists]] often term it "Londonderry".<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6213890.stm City name row lands in High Court]", ''[[BBC News]]'', [[2006-12-06]].

The founders decided not to use the name of the city's previous main club, [[Derry Celtic F.C.|Derry Celtic]], to be more inclusive to all football fans in the city.<ref name=History>[http://derrycityfc.net/history/concise/index.php Derry City FC - A Concise History].

This situation lasted from September 1971 until October 1972 when, faced with dwindling crowds (most Derry fans were unwilling to travel to Coleraine due to the political situation and the longer journey) and dire finances, the club formally requested permission to return to the Brandywell.

Derry applied to join the reorganised [[Football League of Ireland]] (the league in the [[Republic of Ireland]]) in 1985 with the Brandywell as their home.

In April 1986 the club ran a competition in local schools to design a crest for them. The winning entry was designed by John Devlin, a [[St. Columb's College]] student, and was introduced on [[5 May]], [[1986]] as Derry hosted [[Nottingham Forest]] for a friendly. The crest depicted a simplified version of the city's [[Foyle Bridge]], which had opened 18 months previously, the traditional red and white stripes of the jersey bordered by thin black lines, the year in which the club was founded and a football in the centre representing the club as a footballing entity. The name of the club appeared in [[Impact (typeface)|Impact]] font.

Known cultural landmarks or items associated with the city are absent from the [[minimalist]] design. The crests have always been positioned over the heart on the home jerseys. The current away jersey has the crest on its upper-centre.

Plans of Derry City's to purchase a pitch fell through after their formation due to the tight time-scale between their birth in 1928 and the season's beginning in 1929 and so the [[Derry City Council|Londonderry Corporation]] (now the Derry City Council) was approached for the use of the Brandywell which had been used for football up until the end of the 19th century. They agreed and the club still operate under the constraints of [[The Honourable The Irish Society|the Honourable the Irish Society]] charter limitations which declare that the Brandywell must be available for the recreation of the community.

Derry City's first game at the Brandywell was a 2&ndash;1 loss to [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] on [[22 August]], [[1929]].<ref name=History/> In 1933, the purchase of Bond’s Field in the [[Waterside]] was mentioned, but it was thought to be too far away from the fanbase which had built up on the Cityside, especially in the Brandywell area. They also had first option on Derry Celtic’s old ground, [[Celtic Park (Derry)|Celtic Park]], but hesitated on a final decision and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] bought it ten years later. They also decided against buying Meenan Park for £1,500.<ref name=History/> 

Because of [[Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland's]] volatile political situation during the [[Troubles]] and security fears for [[Protestants]] and those of the [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]] tradition visiting the mainly [[Irish nationalist|nationalist]] city of [[Derry]], the [[Brandywell]] has not always been the home ground of Derry City. In 1970 and 1971, Derry had to play their "home" ties against [[Linfield FC|Linfield]] at [[Windsor Park]] in [[Belfast]] &mdash; the home-ground of Linfield. From September 1971 until October 1972 Derry were forced to play all their "home" games at the [[The Showgrounds (Coleraine)|Showgrounds]] in mainly Protestant [[Coleraine]], over 30&nbsp;miles away, as police ruled the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] Brandywell area as too unsafe for visiting unionists. The Brandywell did not see senior football for another 13 years as the [[Irish Football League]] upheld a ban on the stadium and Derry decided to leave the league as a result.<ref name=Bradley/> Only greyhound meetings and junior football were held during this time.<ref name=McGuinness/> Derry's admission to the [[League of Ireland]] in 1985 saw a return of senior games.

Derry City have made numerous appearances in popular and general culture. In the world of music, the club was given exposure by Derry [[punk music|punk]] band, the [[Undertones]], who had the cover of their 1980 hit single, ''My Perfect Cousin'', feature a [[Subbuteo]] figure sporting the colours of Derry City.

The club has also featured on popular television. Due to the fact that they are a club based in [[Northern Ireland]] playing in the league of the [[Republic of Ireland]] they often receive the attention of broadcasters in both jurisdictions. In the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' shown the night before Derry's clash with [[Paris St. Germain]] in the 2006&ndash;07 [[UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup's]] First Round, it was highlighted that [[Archie McLeod]], the grandfather of [[David Tennant]], the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' actor, was a Derry City player. Derry had supplied a lucrative signing-on fee and had enticed him over from [[Scotland]].<ref>Barratt, Dr. Nick. "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory/get_started/wdytya_celeb_gallery_04.shtml Who do you think you are? (Third series): David Tennant]", ''BBC History'', [[2006-09-27]]. Retrieved on [[2007-04-30]].</ref> Likewise, features about the club were run by ''[[Football Focus]]'' prior to and after the same UEFA Cup game. Irish television has also featured the club. Derry City played in the first [[League of Ireland]] match ever to be shown live on television when they visited [[Tolka Park]] to play [[Shelbourne FC|Shelbourne]] during the 1996&ndash;97 season. The game was broadcast on [[RTÉ|RTÉ's]] [[Network 2]] and finished 1&ndash;1 with [[Gary Beckett]] scoring for Derry.

Another medium to play host to the club has been the radio. On [[20 April]], [[2005]], Derry City featured in an audio documentary ''The Blues and the Candy Stripes'' on [[RTÉ Radio 1|RTÉ Radio 1's]] ''Documentary on One''. The documentary was produced in the aftermath of the historic friendly game between Derry and [[Linfield FC|Linfield]] that took place on [[22 February]], [[2005]] — the first between the two teams to occur since a game on [[25 January]], [[1969]] during which Linfield's fans had to be evacuated from the [[Brandywell]] by police at half-time due to civil unrest and ugly scenes within the ground.<ref name=Radio>"[http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/1044693.html The Blues and the Candy Stripes]", ''RTÉ.ie'', [[2005-04-20]].

The club is known for its community spirit and the supporters have played a pivotal role in the survival and successes of the club. When massive debts brought Derry close to extinction in the 2000&ndash;01 season, the local community responded en masse and saved the club. During the club's successful 2006 season, club captain, [[Peter Hutton (footballer)|Peter Hutton]] said:
{{blockquote|Nobody owns Derry City F.C. apart from the people of Derry. Five or six years ago the club was on its knees, on the verge of going out of business. There was no sugar-daddy, no millionaire, no [[Roman Abramovich]] to save the club. It was the people and the city who saved the club. People, fans, ordinary people; they went out and banged on doors to collect money, they went around pubs with collection buckets, they did what they could to keep the club alive. Derry is a close-knit place, a small community, they care about their club and that's why we still have a club. And every bit of success we may get this season is down to them.<ref>Fitzmaurice, Aidan.
