'''Bengali''' or '''Bangla''' (বাংলা, {{IPA2|'baŋla}}) is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] [[language]] of the eastern [[Indian subcontinent]], evolved from [[Prakrit]], [[Pāli]] and [[Sanskrit]].

Bengali is native to the region of eastern [[South Asia]] known as [[Bengal]], which comprises present day [[Bangladesh]] and the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]]. With nearly 230 million [[first language|native speakers]], Bengali is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world (it is ranked fourth in the world<ref name="lang4" />).

==History==

Like other [[List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern Indo-Aryan languages]], Bengali arose from the eastern [[Middle Indic languages]] of the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. [[Magadhi Prakrit]], the earliest recorded [[spoken language]] in the region and the language of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], had evolved into [[Ardhamagadhi]] ("Half Magadhi") in the early part of the first millennium CE. Ardhamagadhi, as with all of the Prakrits of North India, began to give way to what are called [[Apabhramsa]] languages just before the turn of the first millennium.<ref name="tb">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000}}</ref> The local Apabhramsa language of the eastern Subcontinent, Purvi Apabhramsa or [[Abahatta|Apabhramsa Abahatta]], eventually evolved into regional dialects, which in turn formed three groups: the [[Bihari languages]], the Oriya languages, and the Bengali-Assamese languages. Some argue for much earlier points of divergence—going back to even 500 CE<ref>{{Harv|Sen|1996}}</ref> but the language was not static; different varieties coexisted and authors often wrote in multiple dialects. For example, Magadhi Prakrit is believed to have evolved into Apabhramsa Abahatta around the 6th century which competed with Bengali for a period of time.<ref name="abahatta">[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/A_0001.htm Abahattha] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref>

Usually three periods are identified in the history of Bengali:<ref name="tb">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000}}</ref> 
# Old Bengali (900/1000 CE–1400 CE)—texts include ''[[Charyapada]]'', devotional songs; emergence of pronouns  ''Ami'',  ''tumi'',  etc;  verb  [[inflection]]s  -''ila'',  -''iba'',  etc. [[Oriya]] and [[Assamese]] branch out in this period.
# Middle Bengali (1400–1800 CE)—major texts of the period include [[Chandidas]]'s ''[[Srikrishnakirtan]]''; [[elision]] of word-final ''ô'' sound; spread of compound verbs; Persian influence. Some scholars further divide this period into early and late middle periods.
# New Bengali (since 1800 CE)—shortening of verbs and pronouns, among other changes (e.g. ''tahar'' → ''tar'' "his"/"her"; ''koriyachhilô'' → ''korechhilo'' [[Grammatical person|he/she]] [[grammatical tense|had]] [[grammatical aspect|done]]).

Historically closer to [[Pāli|Pali]], Bengali saw an increase in [[Sanskrit]] influence during the Middle Bengali ([[Chaitanya]] era), and also during the [[Bengal Renaissance]]. Of the modern [[Indo-European languages]] in South Asia, Bengali and [[Marathi]] retain a largely Sanskrit vocabulary base while [[Hindi]] and others are more influenced by [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. 

[[Image:Shaheed minar Roehl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shaheed Minar]], or the Martyr's monument, in [[Dhaka]], commemorates the struggle for the Bengali language]]
Until the 18th century, there was no attempt to document the grammar for Bengali. The first written Bengali dictionary/grammar, ''Vocabolario em idioma Bengalla, e Portuguez dividido em duas partes'', was written by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[missionary]] [[Manoel da Assumpcam]] between 1734 and 1742 while he was serving in [[Bhawal]].<ref name="firstgram">{{cite web

Bengali was the focus, in 1951–52, of the [[Language movement]] (''Bhasha Andolon'') in what was then [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]).<ref>{{Harv|Baxter|1997|pp=62-63}}</ref> Although Bengali speakers were more numerous in the population of [[Pakistan]], [[Urdu]] was legislated as the sole national language.  On [[February 21]], [[1952]], protesting students and activists walked into military and police fire in [[Dhaka University]] and three young students and several others were killed. Subsequently, [[UNESCO]] has declared [[21 February]] as [[International Mother Language Day]]. In a separate event in May 1961, police in [[Silchar]], India, killed eleven people who were protesting legislation that mandated the use of the Assamese language.<ref name="Assam1">{{cite web

===Dialects===
{{main|Bengali dialects}}

Regional variation in spoken Bengali constitutes a [[dialect continuum]]. Linguist [[Suniti Kumar Chatterjee]] grouped these dialects into four large clusters &mdash; Radh, Banga, Kamarupa and Varendra;<ref name="huq_sarkar">[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> but many alternative grouping schemes have also been proposed.<ref name="morshed">{{cite web

| title = Dialect 
| accessdate = 2006-11-17
| last = Morshed
| first = Abul Kalam Manjoor
| work = Banglapedia
| publisher = Asiatic Society of Bangladesh
}}</ref> The south-western dialects (Radh) form the basis of standard colloquial Bangla, while Bangali is the dominant dialect group in Bangladesh. In the dialects prevalent in much of eastern and south-eastern Bengal ([[Barisal]], [[Chittagong]], [[Dhaka]] and [[Sylhet]] divisions of Bangladesh), many of the stops and affricates heard in West Bengal are pronounced as [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]. Western [[postalveolar consonant|palato-alveolar]] affricates চ [{{IPA| tʃ}}], ছ [{{IPA| tʃʰ}}], জ [[{{IPA|dʒ}}]] correspond to eastern {{Unicode| চʻ}} [{{IPA|ts}}], ছ় [{{IPA|s}}], {{Unicode|জʻ}} [{{IPA|dz}}]~[[{{IPA|z}}]]. The influence of [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] on the phonology of Eastern Bengali is seen through the lack of nasalized vowels. Some variants of Bengali, particularly [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]] and [[Chakma language|Chakma Bengali]], have contrastive [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]; differences in the pitch of the speaker's voice can distinguish words.

[[Rajbangsi language|Rajbangsi]], Kharia Thar and Mal Paharia are closely related to Western Bengali dialects, but are typically classified as separate languages. Similarly, [[Hajong language|Hajong]] is considered a separate language, although it shares similarities to Northern Bengali dialects.<ref name="hajong">{{cite web

During standardization of Bengali in the late 19th and early 20th century, the cultural center of Bengal was its capital [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta). What is accepted as the standard form today in both West Bengal and Bangladesh is based on the West-Central dialect of [[Nadia District|Nadia]], a district located near Kolkata.<ref name="daniul">{{cite web

==Spoken and literary varieties==
Bengali exhibits strong [[diglossia]] between the written and spoken forms of the language. Two styles of writing, involving somewhat different vocabularies and syntax, have emerged:<ref name="daniul">{{cite web

# ''Shadhubhasha'' (সাধু ''shadhu'' = 'chaste' or 'sage'; ভাষা ''bhasha'' = 'language') is the written language with longer verb inflections and more of a [[Sanskrit]]-derived (তৎসম ''tôtshôm'') vocabulary. Songs such as India's national anthem ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' (by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]) and national song ''[[Vande Mātaram]]'' (by [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]]) were composed in Shadhubhasha. However, use of ''Shadhubhasha'' in modern writing is waning. 
# ''Choltibhasha'' (চলতিভাষা ) or ''Cholitobhasha'' (চলিত ''cholito'' = 'current' or 'running') is a written Bengali style exhibiting a preponderance colloquial idiom, and is the standard for written Bengali now. This form came into vogue towards the turn of the 19th century, promoted by the writings of [[Peary Chand Mitra]] (''[[Alaler Gharer Dulal]]'', 1857),<ref name="alal">{{cite web

Even in Standard Bengali, vocabulary items often divide along the split between the [[Muslim]] populace and the [[Hindu]] populace.

==Writing system==
{{main|Bengali script}}
[[Image:Anandabazarsnap1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''[[Anandabazar Patrika]]'', a news daily published from Kolkata in Bengali.]]

Bengali is written in the Bengali [[abugida]]. It is believed to have evolved from a modified [[Brahmic family|Brahmic]] script around 1000 CE,<ref name="akhor">[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0140.htm Bangla Script] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> and is similar to the [[Devanagari]] abugida used for [[Hindi]], [[Sanskrit]], and many other [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]] languages. The Bengali abugida is a [[cursive]] script with eleven [[vowel]] characters and thirty-nine [[consonant]] characters.<ref name="akhor">[http://banglapedia.org.bd/HT/B_0140.htm Bangla Script] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> As in all abugidas, every consonant in the Bengali script can come with what is called an "embedded" or "inherent" vowel sound.<ref name=it46>{{cite web

}}</ref> For example, the simple letter ম can represent the consonant ['''m'''] in a word like কম {{IPA|[kɔ'''m''']}} "less". However, in another word, the same letter ম can represent the sequences {{IPA|['''mɔ''']}} or {{IPA|['''mo''']}}, as in মত {{IPA|['''mɔ'''t̪]}} "opinion" and মন {{IPA|['''mo'''n]}} "mind", respectively, with no added symbol for the vowels {{IPA|['''ɔ''']}} or {{IPA|['''o''']}}. If the consonant sound is followed by some other vowel sound in the pronunciation, this can be written by using a variety of vowel diacritics above, below, before, after, or around the consonant they belong to. Vowels not associated with a consonant (for example, vowels at the beginning of a word) are written with separate symbols. To emphatically indicate that a consonant is not pronounced with the embedded vowel, an extra [[diacritic]] may be added below the consonant.  [[Consonant cluster]]s are typically indicated by [[Ligature (typography)|ligating]] two or more consonant symbols.

In spite of some modifications in the nineteenth century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the Sanskrit alphabet, <ref name="huq_sarkar">[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref>and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, the alphabet has two letters for the sound {{IPA|[dʒ]}} (জ and য) and three for the sound {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (শ, ষ, and স). Bengali punctuation marks, apart from the daŗi (|), or full stop, have been adopted from Western languages.<ref name="huq_sarkar">[http://banglapedia.org/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref>
[[Image:Tagoresignature.png|thumb|right|250px|Signature of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] &mdash; an example of [[penmanship]] in Bengali.]]

This same script, with a few small modifications, is also used for writing [[Assamese]]. Other related languages in the region also make use of the Bengali alphabet. [[Meitei language|Meitei]], a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language used in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], has been written in the Bengali abugida for centuries, though [[Meitei Mayek script|Meitei Mayek]] (the Meitei abugida) has been promoted in recent times. The script has been adopted for writing the [[Sylheti]] language as well, replacing the use of the old Sylheti Nagori script.<ref name="sylnagri">{{cite web

Magadhan languages such as Bengali are known for their wide variety of [[diphthongs]], or combinations of [[vowel]]s occurring within the same [[syllable]].<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=116}}</ref> Several vowel combinations can be considered true monosyllabic diphthongs, made up of the main vowel (the '''nucleus''') and the trailing vowel (the '''off-glide'''). Almost all other vowel combinations are possible, but only across two adjacent syllables, such as the disyllabic vowel combination {{IPA|[u.a]}} in কুয়া ''kua'' "well". As many as 25 vowel combinations can be found, but some of the more recent combinations have not passed through the stage between two syllables and a diphthongal monosyllable.<ref>{{Harv|Chatterji|1926|pp=415-416}}</ref>

===Stress===
In standard Bengali, [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] is predominantly initial. Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as '''''shô'''-ho-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta''''' "cooperation", where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress. The first syllable carries the greatest stress, with the third carrying a somewhat weaker stress, and all following odd-numbered syllables carrying very weak stress. However, in words borrowed from Sanskrit, the root syllable has stress, out of harmony with the situation with native Bengali words.<ref name="suniti_stress">{{Harv|Chatterji|1921|pp=19-20}}</ref>

Adding [[prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es to a word typically shifts the stress to the left; for example, while the word '''''shob'''-bho'' "civilized" carries the primary stress on the first syllable ['''shob'''], adding the [[negation|negative]] prefix [ô-] creates '''''ô'''-shob-bho'' "uncivilized", where the primary stress is now on the newly-added first syllable অ '''''ô'''''. In any case, word-stress does not alter the meaning of a word, and is always subsidiary to sentence-stress.<ref name="suniti_stress">{{Harv|Chatterji|1921|pp=19-20}}</ref>

===Intonation===
For Bengali words, intonation or pitch of voice have minor significance, apart from a few isolated cases. However in sentences intonation does play a significant role.<ref>{{Harv|Chatterji|1921|pp=20}}</ref> In a simple [[declarative sentence]], most words and/or phrases in Bengali carry a rising [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]],<ref name="inton0">{{Harvnb|Hayes|Lahiri|1991|pp=56}}</ref> with the exception of the last word in the sentence, which only carries a low tone. This [[intonation]]al pattern creates a musical tone to the typical Bengali sentence, with low and high tones alternating until the final drop in pitch to mark the end of the sentence.

In sentences involving [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]]ed words and/or phrases, the rising tones only last until the focused word; all following words carry a low tone.<ref name="inton0">{{Harvnb|Hayes|Lahiri|1991|pp=56}}</ref> This intonation pattern extends to [[wh-questions]], as wh-words are normally considered to be focused. In yes-no questions, the rising tones may be more exaggerated, and most importantly, the final syllable of the final word in the sentence takes a high falling tone instead of a flat low tone.<ref name="inton1">{{Harvnb|Hayes|Lahiri|1991|pp=57-58}}</ref>

===Vowel length===
[[Vowel length]] is not contrastive in Bengali; all else equal, there is no meaningful distinction between a "[[short vowel]]" and a "[[long vowel]]",<ref name>{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=6}}</ref> unlike the situation in many other Indic languages. However, when [[morpheme]] boundaries come into play, vowel length can sometimes distinguish otherwise homophonous words. This is due to the fact that [[open syllable|open]] [[syllable|monosyllables]] (i.e. words that are made up of only one syllable, with that syllable ending in the main vowel and not a consonant) have somewhat longer vowels than other syllable types.<ref name="munier">{{Harv|Ferguson|Chowdhury|1960|pp=16-18}}</ref> For example, the vowel in ''cha:'' "tea" is somewhat longer than the first vowel in ''chaţa'' "licking", as ''cha:'' is a word with only one syllable, and no final consonant. (The long vowel is marked with a colon : in these examples.) The [[Affix|suffix]] ''ţa'' "the" can be added to ''cha:'' to form ''cha:ţa'' "the tea". Even when another morpheme is attached to ''cha:'', the long vowel is preserved. Knowing this fact, some interesting cases of apparent vowel length distinction can be found. In general Bengali vowels tend to stay away from extreme vowel articulation.<ref name="munier">{{Harv|Ferguson|Chowdhury|1960|pp=16-18}}</ref>

Furthermore, using a form of [[reduplication]] called "echo reduplication", the long vowel in ''cha:'' can be copied into the reduplicant ''ţa:'', giving ''cha:ţa:'' "tea and all that comes with it". Thus, in addition to ''cha:ţa'' "the tea" (long first vowel) and ''chaţa'' "licking" (no long vowels), we have ''cha:ţa:'' "tea and all that comes with it" (both long vowels).

===Consonant clusters===
{{main|Bengali consonant clusters}}

Native Bengali (''tôdbhôb'') words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=125}}</ref> the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Bengali restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using Sanskrit or English borrowings, such as গেরাম ''geram'' (CV.CVC) for গ্রাম ''gram'' (CCVC) "village" or ইস্কুল ''iskul'' (VC.CVC) for স্কুল ''skul'' (CCVC) "school".

Sanskrit (তৎসম ''tôtshôm'') words borrowed into Bengali, however, possess a wide range of clusters, expanding the maximum syllable structure to CCCVC. Some of these clusters, such as the ''mr'' in মৃত্যু ''mrittu'' "death" or the ''sp'' in স্পষ্ট ''spôshţo'' "clear", have become extremely common, and can be considered legal consonant clusters in Bengali. English and other foreign (বিদেশী ''bideshi'') borrowings add even more cluster types into the Bengali inventory, further increasing the syllable capacity to CCCVCCCC, as commonly-used loanwords such as ট্রেন ''ţren'' "train" and গ্লাস ''glash'' "glass" are now even included in leading Bengali dictionaries.

Final consonant clusters are rare in Bengali.<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=126}}</ref> Most final consonant clusters were borrowed into Bengali from English, as in লিফ্‌ট ''lifţ'' "lift, elevator" and ব্যাংক ''bêņk'' "bank". However, final clusters do exist in some native Bengali words, although rarely in standard pronunciation. One example of a final cluster in a standard Bengali word would be গঞ্জ ''gônj'', which is found in names of hundreds of cities and towns across Bengal, including নবাবগঞ্জ ''Nôbabgônj'' and মানিকগঞ্জ ''Manikgônj''. Some nonstandard varieties of Bengali make use of final clusters quite often. For example, in some Purbo (eastern) dialects, final consonant clusters consisting of a nasal and its corresponding oral stop are common, as in চান্দ ''chand'' "moon". The Standard Bengali equivalent of ''chand'' would be চাঁদ ''chãd'', with a nasalized vowel instead of the final cluster.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Bengali grammar}}

Bengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]).  However, nouns and pronouns are highly [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[conjugation|conjugated]].

As a consequence, unlike Hindi, Bengali verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.

===Word order===
As a [[Head directionality parameter|Head-Final]] language, Bengali follows [[Subject Object Verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name="tb16">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[postposition]]s, as opposed to the [[preposition]]s used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name=UCLA1>{{cite web

| title = Bengali
| accessdate = 2006-11-20

| publisher = University of California, Los Angeles
}}</ref>

Yes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. Additionally optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. কি ''-ki'', না ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticized]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.

Wh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.

===Nouns===
Nouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name="tb">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000}}</ref> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]]. When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as -টা ''-ţa'' (singular) or -গুলা ''-gula'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]].

When counted, nouns take one of a small set of [[measure word]]s. As in many Asian languages (e.g. [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], etc.), nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. The noun's measure word ('''MW''') must be used between the numeral and the noun. Most nouns take the generic measure word -টা ''-ţa'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. -জন ''-jon'' for humans).

|}

Measuring nouns in Bengali without their corresponding measure words (e.g. আট বিড়াল ''aţ biŗal'' instead of আট'''টা''' বিড়াল ''aţ-'''ţa''' biŗal'' "eight cats") would typically be considered ungrammatical. However, omitting the noun and preserving the measure word is commonly encountered: e.g. শুধু এক'''জন''' থাকবে। ''Shudhu êk-'''jon''' thakbe.'' (lit. "Only one-'''MW''' will remain.") would be understood to mean "Only one '''person''' will remain.", given the semantic class implicit in -জন ''-jon''.

In this sense, all nouns in Bengali, unlike most other Indo-European languages, are similar to [[mass noun]]s.

===Verbs===
Verbs divide into two classes: [[finite verb|finite]] and non-finite. Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honor]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes.  The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200. 

[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]]. 

Bengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name="huq_sarkar">[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/B_0137.htm Bangla language] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref>  Thus "he is a teacher" is ''she shikkhôk'', (literally "he teacher").<ref name="hacche-bangali">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkhôk hochchhe''. This is viewed as ungrammatical by other speakers, and speakers of this variety are sometimes (humorously) referred as "hochchhe-Bangali".</ref> 
In this respect, Bengali is similar to [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

==Vocabulary==
[[Image:Bengali_Vocabulary.GIF|thumb|Sources of Bengali words|250px|right]]
{{main|Bengali vocabulary}}

Bengali has as many as 75,000 separate words, of which 50,000 (67%) are considered ''tôtshôm'' (direct reborrowings from Sanskrit), 21,100 (28%) are ''tôdbhôb'' (native Bengali vocabulary), and the rest being ''bideshi'' (foreign) and ''deshi'' (indigenous [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]]) words.

However, these figures do not take into account the fact that a large proportion of these words are archaic or highly technical, minimizing their actual usage. The productive vocabulary used in modern literary works, in fact, is made up mostly (67%) of ''tôdbhôb'' words, while ''tôtshôm'' only make up 25% of the total.<ref name="bhoumick">[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/T_0087.htm Tatsama] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref><ref name="bhoumick1">[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/T_0010.htm Tatbhava] in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> ''Deshi'' and ''Bideshi'' words together make up the remaining 8% of the vocabulary used in modern Bengali literature.

Due to centuries of contact with [[Europeans]], [[Mughals]], [[Arabs]], [[Turks]], [[Persians]], [[Afghans]], and [[East Asians]], Bengali has [[Loanword|borrowed]] many words from foreign languages. The most common borrowings from foreign languages come from three different kinds of contact. Close contact with neighboring peoples facilitated the borrowing of words from [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and several indigenous [[Austroasiatic languages]] of Bengal. After centuries of invasions from [[Persia]] and the [[Middle East]], numerous [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Pashtun language|Pashtun]] words were absorbed into Bengali. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and  [[English language|English]] words were later additions during the [[British India|colonial period]].
