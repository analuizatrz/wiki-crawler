'''Charles Sturt University''' ('''CSU''') is an [[Australia]]n multi-campus [[university]] in  [[New South Wales]]. It has campuses at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury-Wodonga]], [[Dubbo, New South Wales|Dubbo]], [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] and [[Wagga Wagga]]. It also has specialist centres in [[Canberra]], [[Manly]] (Sydney), [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] and [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]]. It is the main university servicing the west and southwest of New South Wales, and also serves north eastern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

CSU courses are also delivered by various [[Technical and Further Education|TAFEs]] (members of [[TAFE NSW]] and [[Holmesglen Institute of TAFE]] in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]]); and private institution [[Study Group]]'s [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]] and [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]] campuses (known as ''CSU Study Centres'').

CSU is well known for its extensive range of [[distance education]] courses, being a leader in the field and claims to be one of Australia's largest providers of distance education.

It was established on the [[19 July]] [[1989]] from the merger of several existing separately-administered [[College of Advanced Education|Colleges of Advanced Education]] including the Mitchell College of Advanced Education (MCAE) in Bathurst and the Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education (RMIHE) in Albury-Wodonga and Wagga Wagga, through the enactment of The Charles Sturt University Act, 1989 (Act No. 76, 1989). It is named in honour of explorer [[Charles Sturt]].

The MCAE had been formed on [[1 January]] [[1971]], and the RMIHE in Wagga Wagga and Albury-Wodonga had operated since [[1985]]. The latter institution had earlier succeeded the Riverina College of Advanced Education (RCAE), which was itself the result of an even earlier merger between Wagga Agricultural College and Wagga Teachers College. 

In late [[2004]], CSU formalised moves to assume control of the [[University of Sydney]]'s [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] campus, which came into force on 1 January. From that date, all new Orange campus students were eligible to qualify for degrees from CSU; continuing students continued to be awarded their degrees from Sydney.

In the 2005 Melbourne Institute International Standing of Australian Universities it was ranked 33rd out of the 38 Universities in Australia[http://www.australian-universities.com/rankings/ ]

Charles Sturt University is particularly well known for its degree courses in [[Mass media|media]] and [[Communication studies|communications]], the [[Creative Arts|creative arts]], [[viticulture]], [[agriculture]], [[nursing]], [[radiography]], [[teaching]], [[theology]] and [[accountancy]].  The University's winery has been, for some thirty years, the producer of acclaimed table wines and, more recently, the University has entered the commercial market with its range of specialist cheeses.

Initially CSU was one of a handful of Australian Universities not to increase tutition fees by 25%, one of the reforms introduced by federal education minster [[Brendan Nelson]] in [[2004]], but it has since voted to increase fees by the full 25% allowable starting from [[2006]].

On its Bathurst campus, CSU operates a radio station, [[2MCE FM Bathurst|2MCE]], which also acts as the originating studio for [[National Radio News]], a popular community radio news service.

CSU Cheese Factory is located at the university's Wagga Wagga campus. Construction was completed in 1998 and cheesemaking commenced in August 1998. CSU cheese "Bidgee Cheese" sales commenced in April 1999 at the Cellar Door at the CSU Winery in Wagga Wagga. Today Bidgee Cheese is sold throughout New South Wales and Victoria.
