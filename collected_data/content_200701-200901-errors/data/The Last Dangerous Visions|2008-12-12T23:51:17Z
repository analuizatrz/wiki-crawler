'''''The Last Dangerous Visions''''' was planned to be a sequel to the [[science fiction]] [[short story]] [[anthology|anthologies]] ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' and ''[[Again, Dangerous Visions]]'', originally published in 1967 and 1972 respectively.  It is edited by [[Harlan Ellison]]. 

The projected third collection was started but controversially never finished.  It has become something of a legend in science fiction as the genre's most famous unpublished book. It was originally announced for publication in 1973, but other work demanded Ellison's attention and the anthology has not seen print to date. He has come under criticism for his treatment of some writers who submitted their stories to him, whom some estimate to number nearly 150 (and many of whom have died in the ensuing three decades since the anthology was first announced). 

Various difficulties delayed publication many times.  As recently as May 2007, Ellison has said that he still wants to get the book out <ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/general/Ellison/interview_p2.html NEWSARAMA.COM: HARLAN ELLISON: BRING ON THE DANCING FROGS, Psrt 2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

[[United Kingdom|British]] author [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]], whose story "An Infinite Summer" had been accepted for the collection, wrote a lengthy critique of Ellison's failure to complete the project, published as "The Last Deadloss Visions" in the UK and, in book form, as ''The Book on the Edge of Forever'' (an allusion to the Ellison-written ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode ''[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]'') by [[Fantagraphics Books]] in the US.  The essay was once available online, but Priest has since requested the essay be withdrawn from the [[Internet]].

==Alternative publication of stories intended for the book==

Several stories purchased for ''Last Dangerous Visions'' were eventually published elsewhere. Perhaps the first was Christopher Priest's "An Infinite Summer", which appeared in Andromeda 1, edited by Peter Weston and published in 1976.

[[Michael Bishop (author)|Michael Bishop]]'s story "Dogs' Lives" was published in the Spring 1984 issue of [[The Missouri Review]].  It was subsequently reprinted in the 1985 edition of [[Best American Short Stories]].

"Himself in Anachron" by [[Cordwainer Smith]] (died 1966), was published in the 1993 collection of Smith's short fiction, ''The Rediscovery of Man''. Ellison threatened to sue [[New England Science Fiction Association]] (NESFA) for publishing ''Himself in Anachron'', sold to Ellison for the book by his widow,<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/a76.html| journal=Ansible| title=ConFrancisco Continued| id=ISSN 0265-9816| volume=76| month=November| year=1993}}</ref> but later reached an amicable settlement.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Ansible| title=Infinitely Improbable| volume=77| url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/a77.html| month=December| year=1993| id=ISSN 0265-9816}}</ref> 

[[Nelson Bond]]'s contribution, "Pipeline to Paradise," saw publication in 1995 in the anthology ''Wheel of Fortune'', edited by [[Roger Zelazny]]. It was reprinted in 2002 in Bond's second [[Arkham House]] collection, ''[[The Far Side of Nowhere]]''. Ellison has publicly acknowledged soliciting the story from Bond, who at the time had retired from writing.<ref>[http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/90254 Allen, Mike. "Roanoke writer widely admired," ''The Roanoke Times'', November 6, 2006.]</ref>

In 1999, DAW Books published an original anthology entitled "Prom Night," edited by Nancy Springer (and Martin H. Greenberg, uncredited), which contains [[Fred Saberhagen]]'s ''LDV'' story, "The Senior Prom." And in 2004, Haffner Press published a coffee-table retrospective of the works of [[Jack Williamson]], ''Seventy-Five: The Diamond Anniversary of a Science Fiction Pioneer,'' which contains his ''LDV'' story, "Previews of Hell." 

[[John Varley (author)|John Varley's]] "The Bellman", which was published in ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'' magazine in 2003 and has since been reprinted; and [[Joe Haldeman]]'s "Fantasy for Six Electrodes and One Adrenaline Drip", which Haldeman had believed lost until finding an old carbon copy of the manuscript and which was finally published in his 2006 collection ''A Separate War and Other Stories''. 

In 2005 Haffner Press published a large reprint collection of [[Edmond Hamilton]]'s two "Star Kings" novels and [[Leigh Brackett]]'s three stories starring Eric Stark, called ''Stark and the Star Kings''. The title story is the long-lost tale by both writers which should have been published in ''Last Dangerous Visions''.

Steven Bryan Bieler's story "Where Are They Now?" appeared in the Spring 2008 (Volume VII, Issue 4) online magazine "Slow Trains" <ref>"Slow Trains", Spring 2008 [http://www.slowtrains.com/vol7issue4/bielervol7issue4.html]</ref>.

In 2008, [[Orson Scott Card]] published "Geriatric Ward" in his collection of short fiction, [[Keeper of Dreams]]. He wanted to see the story published in ''The Last Dangerous Visions'', as [[Dangerous Visions]] and [[Again, Dangerous Visions]] had essentially taught him the art of writing speculative fiction, but he felt that, after so many decades, it would never happen.

At the time of this writing, these stories have also been published: 

*"Precis of the Rappacini Report" by [[Anthony Boucher]] (published as "Rappaccini's Other Daughter")
*"Living Alone in the Jungle" by [[Algis Budrys]] 
*"A Journey South" by [[John Christopher]]
