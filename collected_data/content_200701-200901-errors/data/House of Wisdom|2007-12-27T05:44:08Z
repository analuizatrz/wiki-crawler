The '''House of Wisdom''' ([[Arabic]] بيت الحكمة ''Bait al-Hikma'') was a library and translation institute in [[Abbassid]]-era [[Baghdad]]. It is considered to have been a major intellectual center of the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. 

== Origins ==
In [[750]], the [[Abbasid]] dynasty replaced the [[Umayyad]] dynasty as head of the Islamic empire, and in [[762]], the caliph [[al-Mansur]] (reigned 754 - 775) built [[Baghdad]], (In [[Iraq]]) and made it his capital (the previous capital being [[Damascus]] of [[Umayyad]] dynasty). In the [[Abbasid Empire]], scholars translated many foreign works into [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], built large libraries, and welcomed scholars persecuted by the [[Byzantine Empire]] [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/wiet.html]. There was also an imperial library in [[Ctesiphon]] (now [[Al-Mada'in]]) and works were also translated at the [[Academy of Gundishapur]],  during the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]]. The Abbasid dynasty adopted many practices from the Sassanid empire - among those, that of translating foreign works, except that now works were translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. For this purpose, al-Mansur founded a palace library, modeled after the Sassanid Imperial Library.

The House of Wisdom was originally concerned with translating and preserving Persian works, first from [[Pahlavi]] (Middle Persian), then from [[Syriac]] and eventually [[Greek language|Greek]]. 

Works on [[astrology]], [[mathematics]], [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], and [[philosophy]] were thus translated.

The [[Barmakids]] were influential in the ensuing movement of restoring and preserving Persian culture. They are also credited with the founding of the first [[paper mill]] in Baghdad. The secret of [[papermaking]] had been obtained from Chinese prisoners taken at the [[Battle of Talas]] (751). Previously, copyists would use [[papyrus]] (which is fragile) or [[parchment]] (which is expensive). The introduction of paper thus facilitated the multiplication of books and libraries.

== Under Al-Ma'mun ==

Under the sponsorship of caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] (reigned 813 - 833), the House of Wisdom took on new functions related to mathematics and astrology. The focus also shifted from Persian to Greek science.

At that time, the library was directed by the poet and astrologer [[Sahl ibn-Harun]] (d. 830); the other scholars associated with the library are [[al-Khawarizmi|Mohammed ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] (780 - 850), the [[Bana Musa brothers]] ([[Mohammed Jafar ibn Musa]], [[Ahmad ibn Musa]], and [[al-Hasan ibn Musa]]), and [[al-Kindi|Yaqub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi]] (801 - 873).

[[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] (809 - 873) was placed in charge of the translation work by the caliph. The most renowned translator  was the [[Sabians of Harran|Sabian]] [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] (826 - 901). Translations of this era were superior to earlier ones, however, soon after, the emphasis on translation work declined, as new ideas became more important.

The House of Wisdom flourished under al-Ma'mun's successors [[al-Mu'tasim]] (reign 833 - 842) and [[al-Wathiq]]  (reign 842 - 847), but declined under the reign of [[al-Mutawakkil]] (reign 847 - 861), mainly because Ma'mun, Mu'tasim, and Wathiq followed the sect of [[Mu'tazili]], while al-Mutawakkil followed orthodox [[Islam]]. He wanted to stop the spread of Greek philosophy which was one of the main tools in [[Mu'tazili]] theology.

== Destruction ==

Along with all other libraries in Baghdad, the House of Wisdom was destroyed during the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Mongol invasion of Baghdad]] in 1258. It was said that the waters of the [[Tigris]] ran black for six months with ink from the enormous quantities of books flung into the river.

The House of Wisdom eventually acquired a reputation as a center of learning, although [[universities]] as we know them did not exist at that time &mdash; transmission of knowledge was done directly from teacher to student, without any institutional surrounding. [[Madrasah]]s only began to develop in the city later on, when [[Nizam al-Mulk]] founded the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]].

== Other Houses of Wisdom ==

Some other places have also been called ''House of Wisdom'':

* In [[Cairo]], ''Dar al-Hikmah'', the "House of Wisdom", was another name of the [[House of Knowledge]], founded by the Fatimid Caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] in 1004.

* There is a research institute in Baghdad called ''Bayt al-Hikma'' after the Abbasid-era research center. While the complex includes a 13th century [[madrasa]], it isn't the same building as the medieval ''Bayt al-Hikma''. It was damaged during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

* One of the largest book-shops in the capital city of [[Yemen]], Sana'a is named Dar al-Hikma.
