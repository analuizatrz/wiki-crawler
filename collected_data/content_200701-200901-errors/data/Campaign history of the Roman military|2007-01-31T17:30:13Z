'''[[Ancient Rome]]''' was a city, a state, and later an empire in Eurasia and North Africa from around 756 BC to around 476 AD. Rome's history was often closely entwined with its '''military history''' over the roughly 13 centuries that the Roman state existed.  The core of the '''Military campaigns of ancient Rome''' is the account of the [[Roman military]]'s land battles, from the initial conquest of its neighbours in the [[Italian peninsula]] to its ultimate battle for its existence against invading [[Hun]]s, [[Vandals]] and [[Germanic Wars|Germanic tribes]]. Typically, naval battles were less significant to the military history of Rome, although there are notable exceptions such as during the [[First Punic War]].

The Roman army battled first against its tribal neighbours and Etruscan towns within Italy, and later came to dominate much of the land surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, including the provinces of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and [[Asia Minor]] at the Empire's height. From the outset, the majority of Rome's campaigns were characterised by one of two types: the first is the territorial [[expansionist]] campaign, normally beginning as as counter-offensive<ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 38</ref>, in which each victory brings subjugation of large areas of territory and allowed Rome to grow from a small town to the [[List of largest empires|third largest empire]] in the ancient world, encompassing almost one quarter of the world's total population<ref>Goldsmith, p. 263</ref>; and the second is the civil war of which examples plagued Rome right from its foundation to its eventual demise.

Roman armies were not, despite their formidable reputation and host of victories, invincible, and over the centuries the Romans "produced their share of incompetents"<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 15</ref> who led Roman armies into catastrophic defeats. Nevertheless, it was generally the fate of even the greatest of Rome's enemies, such as [[Pyrrhus]] and [[Hannibal]], to win the battle but lose the war. The history of Rome's campaigning is, if nothing else, a history of bloody-minded persistence overcoming appalling losses<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 31</ref><ref>The Punic Wars, p. 96</ref>.

Rome is almost unique in the ancient world in that its history, military and otherwise, is documented often in great detail almost from the city's very founding right through to its eventual demise. Whilst some histories have been sadly lost, such as Trajan's account of the Dacian Wars, and others, such as Rome's earliest histories, are at least semi-apocryphal, nevertheless the extant histories of Rome's military history are extensive.

The very earliest history, from the time of Rome's founding as a small tribal village, through towards the downfall of Rome's kings, is the least well preserved, due to Rome apparently lacking the processes of recording their history in written form until they made greater contact with Etruscan and Greek civilisation later and adopted the practice from them.

To antiquity we grant the indulgence of making the origins of cities more impressive by comingling the human with the divine, and if any people should be permitted to sanctify its inception and reckon the gods as its founders, surely the glory of the Roman people in war is such that, when it boasts Mars in particular as its parent... the nations of the world would as easily acquiesce in this claim as they do in our rule."

Although Livy's ''Ab Urbe Condita'' lists the traditional seven kings of Rome, the first four 'kings' ([[Romulus]], [[Numa]], [[Tullus Hostilius]] and [[Ancus Marcius]]) are almost certainly entirely apocryphal and [[Michael Grant|Grant]] and others argue that prior to the Etruscan kingdom of Rome was established under [[Tarquinius Priscus]], Rome would have been led by a religious leader of some sort<ref>The History of Rome, p. 21</ref>. Very little is known of Rome's military history during this era and what history has come down to us is of a legendary rather than factual nature. Traditionally, Romulus fortified the [[Palatine Hill]] after founding the city and Livy states that shortly after its founding Rome was "''equal to any of the surrounding cities in her prowess in war''".<ref>Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', Book 1, OUP, 1998, p. 13</ref> The first campaign, if such it can be called, that was fought by the Romans in this legendary account is their seizing of the women from several [[Sabine]] villages for purposes of "begetting their children"<ref>Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', Book 1, OUP, 1998, p. 15</ref>, an event known as [[The Rape of the Sabine Women]]. According to Livy, the village of [[Caenina]] responded first by invading Roman territory, but were routed and their city captured. The [[Antemnae]] were defeated next in a similar fashion, and again the [[Crustumerium]]. The main body of the Sabines attacked Rome and captured the citadel but were then routed.

There were further wars against the [[Fidenae]]<ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 33</ref>, [[Veii]], the [[Alba Longa|Albans]]<ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 27</ref>, the [[Medullia]], the [[Apiloae]]<ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 44</ref>, and the [[Collatia]]<ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 46</ref>, although little is known of the details of each.

Under the Etruscan kings [[Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]] and [[Tarquinius Superbus]] Rome expanded to north-west, coming to conflict again with the [[Veii]] after the expiry of the treaty that concluded their earlier conflict<ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 56</ref>. There was a further war against the [[Gabii]]<ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 61</ref>, and later against the [[Rutuli]]<ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 66</ref>. The Etruscan kings were overthrown as part of a wider reduction in Etruscan power in the region during this period, and Rome re-established itself as a [[republic]].<ref>The History of Rome, p. 31</ref>.

==Early Roman Republic (458 BC - 282 BC) ==
===Early Italian campaigns (458-396 BC)===
[[Image:Etruscan civilization map.png|thumb|right|305px|Map showing Rome's Etruscan neighbours]]
{{Campaignbox Rome's Early Italian Campaigns}}
The first non-apocryphal Roman wars were wars of both expansion and defence, aimed at protecting Rome itself from neighbouring cities and nations and, although sources disagree, it is possible that Rome itself was twice invested by Etruscan armies, first in around 509 BC under the recently-overthrown Tarquinius Superbus<ref>The History of Rome, p. 32</ref><ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 77</ref>, and again in 508 BC under the Etruscan [[Lars Porsenna]]<ref>The Rise of Rome, xxxi</ref><ref>The History of Rome, p. 32</ref><ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 80</ref>.  This sort of warfare characterized the early Republican Period when Rome was focused on consolidating its position in [[Italy]], and eventually conquering the peninsula<ref>The History of Rome, p. 33</ref>.

Initially, Rome's immediate neighbours were either Latin towns and villages on a similar tribal system to Rome itself, or else tribal Sabines from the Apennine hills beyond<ref>The History of Rome, p. 38</ref>. One by one Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities that were either under Etruscan control or else Latin towns that had cast off their Etruscan rulers, as had Rome<ref>The History of Rome, p. 38</ref>. Rome defeated the [[Lavinium|Lavinii]] and [[Tusculum|Tusculi]] in the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]] in [[496 BC]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 37</ref><ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 89</ref>, the [[Sabines]] in an Unknown Battle in [[449 BC]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 37</ref>, the [[Aequi]] in the [[Battle of Mons Algidus]] in [[458 BC]] and the [[Battle of Corbione]] in [[446 BC]]), the [[Volsci]] in the [[Battle of Corbione]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 13</ref> in [[446 BC]] and the [[Capture of Antium]] in [[377 BC]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 39)</ref>), the [[Aurunci]] in the [[Battle of Aricia]]<ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 96</ref>, and the [[Veii]] in the [[Battle of the Cremera]] in [[477 BC]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 41</ref> the [[Capture of Fidenae]] in [[435 BC]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 42</ref> and the [[Siege of Veii]] in [[396 BC]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 13</ref><ref>The History of Rome, p. 42</ref>. After defeating the Veii, the Romans had effectively completed the conquest of their immediate Etruscan neighbours, as well as secured their position against the immediate threat posed by the tribespeople of the Apennine hills.

However, Rome still controlled only a very limited area and the affairs of Rome still minor even to those in Italy: the remains of Veii, for instance, lie entirely within modern Rome's suburbs<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 13</ref>; the Romans were only just even coming to the attention of the Greeks<ref>The History of Rome, p. 44</ref>; and the bulk of Italy remained in the hands of [[Latin]], Sabine, Samnite and other peoples in the central part of Italy, [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] colonies to the south, and, notably, the [[Celts|Celtic people]], including the Gauls, to the north. The Celtic civilisation at this time was vibrant and growing in strength and territory. It is at the hands of the Gallic Celts that Rome suffered a humiliating defeat that temporarily set back its advance and was to imprint itself on the Roman consciousness.

===Celtic invasion of Italia (390-387 BC)===
{{Campaignbox Roman-Gaulish Wars}}
Several Gallic tribes had invaded Italy from the north, and a particularly warlike one<ref>The History of Rome, p. 44</ref>, the [[Senones]], invaded the Etruscan province of Siena and attacked the town of [[Clusium]], not far from Rome's sphere of influence. The Clusians, overwhelmed by the size of the enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. Half by accident and half by design<ref>The History of Rome, p. 44</ref> the Romans found themselves in conflict with the Senones, whom they met in pitched battle at the [[Battle of the Allia|Battle of Allia River]]<ref>The History of ROme, p. 44</ref> sometime around 387 BC. The Gauls defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops<ref>The History of Rome, p. 44</ref> and proceeded to pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and partially sacked the town<ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 329</ref> before being either driven off<ref>The Rise of Rome, p. 330</ref> or bought off<ref>The History of Rome, p. 44</ref>.

Now that the Romans and Gauls had blooded one another, intermittent warfare continued between the two in Italy for more that two centuries, including the [[Battle of Faesulae]] in [[225 BC]], the [[Battle of Telamon]] in [[224 BC]], the [[Battle of Clastidium]] in [[222 BC]], the [[Battle of Cremona (200 BC)|Battle of Cremona]] in [[200 BC]], the [[Battle of Mutina (194 BC)|Battle of Mutina]] in [[194 BC]], the [[Battle of Arausio]] in [[105 BC]], and the [[Battle of Vercellae]] in [[101 BC]]. The Celtic problem would not be resolved for Rome until the final subjugation of all Gaul following the [[Battle of Alesia]] in 52 BC.

===Roman expansion into Italia (343-282 BC)===
[[Image:Pietra bismantova.jpg|thumb|right|305px|Apennine hills around Samnium]]
{{Campaignbox Ancient Unification of Italy}}
{{Campaignbox Samnite Wars}}
After recovering from the sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. Despite their successes so far, their mastery of the whole of Italy was by no means assured at this point: the [[Samnites]] were a people just as martial as the Romans and with an objective of their own of securing more lands in the Italian plains. The [[First Samnite War]] of between 343 BC and 341 BC was a relatively short affair: the Romans beat the Samnites in both the [[Battle of Mount Gaurus]] in [[342 BC]] and the [[Battle of Suessola]] in [[341 BC]] but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the [[Latin War]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 48</ref>.

Rome was forced to contend by around 340 BC, then, against both Samnite incursions and a bitter war against their former allies. Rome bested the Latins in the [[Battle of Vesuvius]] and again in the [[Battle of Trifanum]], after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule<ref>The History of Rome, p. 49</ref>, which, perhaps due to Rome's lenient treatment of their defeated foe<ref>The History of Rome, p. 48</ref>, they submitted largely amicably to for the next 200 years.

The [[Second Samnite War]] , from 327 BC to 304 BC, was a much longer and more serious affair for both sides<ref>The History of Rome, p. 52</ref>, running for over twenty years and leading to massive casualties on both sides. The fortunes of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course: the Samnites seized Neoplis in the [[Capture of Neapolis]] in 327 BC<ref>The History of Rome, p. 52</ref>, which the Romans then re-captured before losing at the [[Battle of the Caudine Forks]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 52</ref> and the [[Battle of Lautulae]]. The Romans then proved victorious at the [[Battle of Bovianum]] and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies.

Seven years after their defeat, with Roman dominance of the area looking assured, the Samnites rose again and defeated he Romans at the [[Battle of Camerinum]] in [[298 BC]], to open the [[Third Samnite War]]. With this success in hand they managed to bring together a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome, all of whom were probably keen to prevent any one faction dominating the entire region. The army that faced the Romans at the [[Battle of Sentinum]] in [[295 BC]] therefore included Samnites, Gauls, Etruscans and Umbrians<ref>The History of Rome, p. 53</ref>. When the army under [[Fabius Rullianus]] and [[Publius Decimus Mus]] won a convincing victory over these combined forces it must have become clear that little could prevent Roman dominance of Italy. In the [[Battle of Populonia]] in 282 BC Rome finished off the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region.

==Mid-Roman Republic (281 BC - 148 BC)==
===Pyrrhic War (280-275 BC)===
[[Image:Pyrrhus route.jpg|305px|thumb|Route of Pyrrhus of Epirus]]
{{Campaignbox Pyrrhic War}}
By the end of the [[third century BC]], Rome had established itself as a major power on the [[Italia|Italian peninsula]], but had not yet come into conflict with the dominant military powers in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] at the time, [[Carthage]] and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek kingdoms]]. Rome had all but completely defeated the [[Samnites]], and greatly reduced [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] power in the region. However, the south of Italy was controlled by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] colonies of [[Magna Grecia]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 77</ref> who had been allied to the Samnites, and continued Roman expansion brought the two into inevitable conflict<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 14</ref><ref>The History of Rome, p. 78</ref>.

When a diplomatic dispute between Rome and the Greek colony of [[Tarentum]] erupted into open warfare in the naval [[Battle of Thurii]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 78</ref>, Tarentum appealed for aid to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], ruler of [[Epirus]], for military aid<ref>Antiquity, p. 151</ref><ref>The History of Rome, p. 78</ref>. Motivated by his diplomatic obligations to Tarentum, and a personal desire for military accomplishment, Pyrrhus landed a Greek army of some 25,000 men<ref>The History of ROme, p. 78</ref> and a contingent of [[war elephant]]s<ref>The History of Rome, p. 78</ref> on Italian soil in 280 B.C, where his forces were joined by the Greeks and a portion of the [[Samnites]] who revolted against Roman control.

The Roman legions had not yet seen elephants in battle, and their inexperience turned the tide in Pyrrhus' favour at the [[Battle of Heraclea]] in 280 BC<ref>The History of Rome, p. 78</ref>, and again at the [[Battle of Ausculum]] in 279 BC<ref>The History of Rome, p. 79</ref>. Despite these victories, Pyrrhus found his position in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus as long as his army remained in Italia. Furthermore, Rome entered into a treaty of support with [[Carthage]], and Pyrrhus found that despite his expectations, none of the [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic peoples]] would defect to the Greek and Samnite cause. Facing unacceptably heavy losses with each encounter with the Roman legions, and not finding further allies in Italia, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula and campaigned in [[Sicily]], abandoning his allies to deal with the Rome<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 14</ref>.

When his Sicilian campaign was also ultimately a failure, and at the request of his Italian allies, Pyrrhus returned to Italy. In 275 BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman legions at the [[Battle of Beneventum]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 79</ref>. This time the Romans had devised methods to deal with the war elephants, including the use of javelins<ref>The History of Rome, p. 79</ref> fire arrows{{fact}}. While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realized that his army had been exhausted and reduced by years of foreign campaigns, and seeing little hope for further gains, withdraw completely from Italy.

The conflicts with Pyrrhus would have a great effect on Rome, however. Rome has shown that it was capable of pitting its legions successfully against the dominant military [[superpower]]s of the Mediterranean, and further showed that the Greek kingdoms were incapable of defending their colonies. Rome quickly moved into southern Italia, subjugating and dividing Magna Grecia. Effectively dominating the Italian peninsula, and with a proven international military reputation<ref>The History of Rome, p. 80</ref>, Rome now began to look outwards at expansion into Sicily and the islands of the Mediterranean, a policy that would bring it into direct conflict with [[Carthage]]<ref>the Enemies of Rome, p. 16</ref><ref>The History of Rome, p. 80</ref>.

===Punic Wars (264-146 BC)===

Rome first began to make war outside the Italian peninsula in the [[Punic wars]] against [[Carthage]].  These wars, starting in [[264 BC]]<ref>Antiquity, p. 152</ref> were probably the largest conflict of the ancient world<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 13</ref> and saw Rome become a Mediterranean power, with territory in [[Sicily]], [[North Africa]], [[Spain]], and, after the [[Macedonian wars]], [[Greece]].

The [[First Punic War]] began in 264 BC when former Greek colonies on Sicily again began to appeal to the two powers between which they lay - Rome and Carthage - in order to solve internal conflicts<ref>Antiquity, p. 152</ref>. The willingness of both Rome and Carthage to become embroiled on the soil of a third party may indicate a recognition of each other's power without wishing to enter a full war of annihilation; certainly there was considerable disagreement within Rome about whether to prosecute the war<ref>The Punic Wars, p.68</ref>. The war saw land battles in Sicily early on such as the [[Battle of Agrigentum]] but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. For the Romans naval warfare was a relatively unexplored concept. Before the [[First Punic War]] in [[264 BC]] there was no Roman navy to speak of as all previous Roman war had been fought in [[Italy]].  But the war in [[Sicily]] against [[Carthage]], a great naval power, forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and train [[sailors]].

Rome took to naval warfare ''"like a brick to water"''<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 16</ref> and the first few naval battles of the [[First Punic War]] such as the [[Battle of the Lipari Islands]] were disasters for [[Rome]], as might be expected from a city that had no real prior experience of naval warfare. After inventing a grappling engine known as a [[Corvus]]<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 113</ref>, a Roman naval force under C. Duillius was able to roundly defeat a Carthaginian fleet at the [[Battle of Mylae]]. In just 4 years, a state without any real naval element had managed to better a maritime power in battle. A further naval victory followed at [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus]]<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 84</ref>.

A Roman force landed in Africa under Regulus, who was at first victorious, winning the [[Battle of Adys]]<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 86</ref> and forcing Carthage to sue for peace<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 87</ref> but the terms were so heavy that negotiations failed<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 87</ref> and, in response, the Carthaginians hired Xanthippus, a Spartan mercenary, to reorganize the army<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 88</ref>. Xanthippus managed to cut off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy, then defeated and captured Regulus at the [[Battle of Tunis]]<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 90</ref>.

Despite being defeated on African soil, with their new-found naval abilities, the Romans roundly beat the Carthaginians in naval battle again - largely through the tactical innovations of the Roman fleet<ref>Antiquity, p. 152</ref> - at the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]] and leaving Carthage without a fleet or sufficient coin to raise one. For a maritime power the loss of their access to the Mediterranean stung financially and psychologically, and the Carthaginians sued for peace<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 128</ref>.

Continuing distrust led to the renewal of hostilities in the [[Second Punic War]] when [[Hannibal Barca]] attacked [[Saguntum]]<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 29</ref><ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 25</ref>, leading the Romans to declare war. Hannibal then raised an army in Spain and famously crossed the Italian Alps to invade Italy<ref>Antiquity, p. 153</ref><ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 27</ref>. In the first battle on Italian soil at [[Battle of the Ticinus|Ticinus]] in 218 BC Hannibal defeated the Romans under [[Publius Cornelius Scipio|Scipio]] the elder in a small cavalry fight<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 30</ref><ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 29</ref>. Hannibal's success continued with victories in the [[Battle of the Trebia]] against [[Titius Sempronius Longus]]<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 30</ref><ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 31</ref>, the [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]] against [[Gaius Flaminius]]<ref>Polybius, The Histories, 243</ref><ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 34</ref>, and the [[Battle of Cannae]] against [[Lucius Aemilius Paulus]] and [[Publius Terentius Varro]]<ref>Polybius, The Histories, 263</ref><ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 36</ref>, in what is considered one of the great masterpieces of the tactical art, and for a while ''"Hannibal seemed invincible"''<ref>Antiquity, p. 153</ref>, able to beat Roman armies at will<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 38</ref>.

In the three battles of Nola, [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] managed to hold off Hannibal but then under successive consuls Hannibal smashed Roman armies at the [[First Battle of Capua]], the [[Battle of the Silarus]], the [[Second Battle of Herdonia]], the [[Battle of Numistro]] and the [[Battle of Asculum (209 BC)|Battle of Asculum]]. By this time Hannibal's brother [[Hasdrubal Barca]] sought to cross the Alps into Italy and join his brother. Although initially defeated in Spain in the [[Battle of Baecula]] the army of [[Gaius Claudius Nero]] defeated Hasdrubal at the [[Battle of the Metaurus]]<ref>Antiquity, p. 153</ref>.

Unable to defeat Hannibal himself on Italian soil, and with Hannibal savaging the Italian countryside but unwilling or unable to destroy Rome itself, the Romans sent an army to Italy with the intention of threatening the Carthaginian capital<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 40</ref>. In 203 BC at the [[Battle of Bagbrades]] the invading Roman army under [[Scipio Africanus Major]]defeated the Carthaginian army of [[Hasdrubal Gisco]] and [[Syphax]] and Hannibal was recalled to Africa<ref>Antiquity, p. 153</ref>. At the famous [[Battle of Zama]] Scipio decisively defeated<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 41</ref> - Cantor argues ''"annihilated"''<ref>Antiquity, p. 153</ref> -  [[Hannibal]] in North Africa, ending the [[Second Punic War]].

Carthage never managed to recover after the Second Punic War and the ''[[Third Punic War]]'' is in reality a simple punitive mission to raze the city of Carthage to the ground<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 338</ref>. Carthage was almost defenceless and when besieged offered immediate surrender, conceding to a string of outrageous Roman demands<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 339</ref>. The Romans refused the surrender, demanding as their terms the complete destruction of the city and, seeing little to lose, the Carthaginians prepared to fight<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 339</ref>. In the [[Battle of Carthage (c.149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] Carthage was stormed after a short siege and completely destroyed<ref>Antiquity, p. 154</ref>, its culture "almost totally extinguished"<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 12</ref>.

===Conquest of Iberian peninsula (218-19 BC)===
[[Image:España y Portugal.jpg|thumb|305px|right|Satellite view of the Iberian peninsula]]
{{Campaignbox Roman conquest of Hispania}}

Rome's conflict with the [[Carthaginian]]s in the [[Punic Wars]] led them into expansion in the [[Iberian peninsula]] of modern-day [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. The Carthaginian [[Barcids|Barcid Empire]] consisted of the Punic territories in Iberia. Italy remained the main theatre of war for much of the [[Second Punic War]], but the Romans also aimed to destroy the Punic-Gadean Barcid Empire in Iberia and prevent major Punic allies from linking up with forces in Italy.

Over the years Rome had gradually expanded along the southern Iberian coast until in 211 BC it captured [[Saguntum]]. Following two major military expeditions to Iberia, the Romans finally crushed Carthaginian control of the peninsula in 206 BC, at the [[Battle of Ilipa]], and the peninsula became a Roman province known as [[Hispania]]. From 206 BC onwards the only opposition to Roman control of the peninsula came from opposition from within the native [[Celt-Iberian]] tribes themselves as Rome expanded throughout the peninsula.

Following two small-scale rebellions in 197 BC<ref>The History of Rome, p. 122</ref>, in 194, war broke out in between the Romans and the [[Lusitani]] in the [[Lusitanian War]], in modern-day Portugal. By 179, the Romans had mostly succeeded in pacifying the region and bringing it under their control<ref>The History of Rome, p. 122</ref>.

In either [[155 BC]]{{fact}} or [[154 BC]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 122</ref>, a major revolt was reignited in [[Numantia]], which is known as the [[First Numantine War]] or ''Purinos Polemos'' (meaning Fiery War), a long war of resistance fought between the advancing legions of the Roman Republic and the Lusitani tribes of Hispania Ulterior. The praetor [[Servius Sulpicius Galba]] and the proconsul [[Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] arrived in 151 and began the process of subduing the local population<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 54</ref>. Galba betrayed the Lusitani leaders he had invited to peace talks and had them killed in 150, thus ending the first phase of the war<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 54</ref>.

The Lusitani revolted again in 146 BC under [[Viriathus]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 122</ref> invading [[Turdetenia]] in a guerilla war <ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 56</ref>. The Lusitanians were initially successful, defeating a Roman army at the [[Battle of Tribola]] and going on to [[Sack of Carpetania|sacking nearby Carpetania]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 57</ref>, and besting a second Roman army at the [[Battle of Mount Venus (146 BC)|First Battle of Mount Venus]] in 146 BC, again going on to [[Sack of Segobriga|sack another nearby city]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 57</ref>. In 144 BC, the general [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus]] campaigned successfully against the Lusitani, but failed in his attempts to arrest Viriathus.

In 144, Viriathus formed a league against Rome with several Celt-Iberian tribes and persuaded them to rise against Rome also, in the [[Second Numantine War]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 58</ref>, besting Roman armies at the [[Battle of Mount Venus (144 BC)|Second Battle of Mount Venus]] in 144 BC and again at the failed [[Siege of Erisone]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 58</ref>. In 139, Viriathus was finally killed in his sleep by three of his companions promised gifts by Rome<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 61</ref>. In 136 and 135, more attempts were made to take Numantia, but they failed. In 134 BC, the Consul [[Scipio Aemilianus]] finally succeeded in suppressing the rebellion following the successful [[Siege of Numantia]]<ref>The History  of Rome, p. 123</ref>.

Since the Roman invasion of the Iberian peninsula had begun in the south in the territories around the Mediterranean controlled by the Barcids, the last region of the peninsula to be subdued lay in the far north. The [[Cantabrian Wars]] or Astur-Cantabrian Wars, from 29 BC to 19 BC, occurred during the Roman conquest of these northern provinces of [[Cantabria]] and [[Asturias]]. Spain was fully occupied by 25 BC and the last revolt put down by 19 BC<ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 8</ref>

{{Campaignbox Rome against Antiochus III}}
Rome's preoccupation with its war with Carthage provided an opportunity for [[Philip V]] of [[Macedon]] in northern [[Greece]], to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 47</ref><ref>The History of ROme, p. 115</ref>. Rome discovered the agreement when, Philips' emissaries along with emissaries from Hannibal were captured, by the Roman fleet patrolling the southern Apulian coast<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 47</ref>. Desiring to prevent Philip from aiding Carthage in Italy and elsewhere, Rome sought out land allies in Greece and found partners in the [[Aetolian League]] of Greek city-states<ref>The History of Rome, p. 115</ref>, the [[Illyrians]] to the north of Macedon and the city-states of [[Pergamon]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 116</ref> and [[Rhodes]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 116</ref>, which lay across the Aegean from Macedon in modern-day Turkey<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 48</ref>.

The [[First Macedonian War]] saw the Romans involved in only limited land operations and when the Aetolians sued for peace with Philip once more Rome;s expeditionary force, with no more allies in Greece, but having achieved their objective of preventing Philip from aiding Hannibal, was ready to make peace herself<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 48</ref>. A treaty was drawn up at Phoenice in 205 BC which promised Rome a small indemnity<ref>Antiquity, p. 154</ref>, the so-called "[[Peace of Phoenice]]", formally ending the First Macedonian War<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 71</ref>.

Macedon started expanding on territory claimed by the Greek city states in 200 BC and these states called for help to their ally Rome<ref>The Enemies f Rome, p. 49</ref>. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum that he must submit Macedonia to being essentially a Roman province. Philip refused, and, after initial reluctance for further hostilities<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 72</ref>, Rome declared war against Philip in the [[Second Macedonian War]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 49</ref>. In the [[Battle of the Aous]] Roman forces under [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus]] defeated the Macedonians<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 73</ref>, and in a second larger battle under the same opposing commanders in 197 BC, in the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]]<ref>The History of ROme, p. 117</ref>, Flamininus again beat the Macedonians decisively<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 73</ref> and Macedonia was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Tempea]], in which it lost all claim to territory in Greece and Asia, and had to pay a war indemnity to Rome<ref>The Enemies of Rome. p. 51</ref>.

Between the second and third Macedonian wars Rome faced further conflict in the region due to a tapestry of shifting rivalries, alliances and leagues all seeking to gain greater influence. After the Macedonians had been defeated in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC, the Spartans stepped into the partial power vacuum in Greece. Fearing the Spartans would take increasing control of the region, the Romans drew on help from allies to prosecute the [[Roman-Spartan War]], defeating a Spartan army at the [[Battle of Gythium]] in 195 BC<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 51</ref>.

Rome now turned its attentions to [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III of Seleucia]] After campaigns in Bactria, India, Persia and Judea, [[Antiochus III the Great]] of the Seleucid Empire moved to Asia Minor to secure several coastal towns, a move that brought him into conflict with Roman interests. A Roman force under [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 191 BC)|Manius Acilius Glabrio]] defeated Antiochus at the [[Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC)|Battle of Thermopylae]] and forced him to evacuate Greece<ref>The History of Rome, p. 119</ref>: the Romans then pursued the Seleucids beyond Greece, beating them again in naval battles at the [[Battle of the Eurymedon (190 BC)|Battle of the Eurymedon]] and [[Battle of Myonessus]], and finally in a decisive engagement of the [[Battle of Magnesia]]<ref>The History of ROme, p. 119</ref> in the decisive victory of the war.

In 179 BC King Philip V of Macedon died<ref>The History of Rome, p. 120</ref> and his talented and ambitious son, Perseus, took his throne and showed a renewed interest in Greece<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 75</ref>, and allied himself with the warlike [[Bastarnae]]<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 75</ref>, both acts possibly violating the treaty signed with the Romans by his father, and certainly not "behaving as a subordinate ally should"<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 75</ref>. Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the [[Third Macedonian War]]. Perseus had initial success against the Romans, winning the [[Battle of Callicinus]] against the Roman consul [[Publius Licinius Crassus]]. However, as with all such ventures in this period, Rome responded by simply sending another consular army. The consular army of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus]] duly defeated the Macedonians at the [[Battle of Pydna]] in 168 BC<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 92</ref><ref>The History of Rome, p. 120</ref> and the Macedonians, lacking the reserve of the Romans and with King Perseus captured, duly capitulated, ending the [[Third Macedonian War]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 53</ref>.

The Fourth Macedonian War, fought from 150 BC to 148 BC, was the final war between Rome and Macedon and began when [[Andriscus]] usurped the Macedonian throne. The Romans raise a consular army under [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], who swiftly defeated Andriscus at the [[Battle of Pydna (148 BC)|Second battle of Pydna]].

==Late Roman Republic (147 BC - 30 BC) ==
===Jugurthine War (111-104 BC)===
{{Campaignbox Jugurthine War}}
The Jugurthine War, fought between [[Jugurtha]] of [[Numidia]] and Rome between 111-104 BC was the final Roman pacification of Northern Africa<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 29</ref> following Jugurtha's usurpation of the throne of Numidia, a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 64</ref>. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into accepting his usurpation<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 65</ref> and was granted half the kingdom. Following further aggression the Romans sent an army to tackle him. The Romans were defeated at the [[Battle of Suthul]] but faired better at the [[Battle of the Muthul]] and finally defeated Jugurtha at the [[Battle of Thala]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 69</ref>. Following another battle of unknown location, Jugurtha was finally captured by treachery<ref>The History of Rome, p. 153</ref>, ending the war<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 71</ref>. The war is notable in that it launched the political career of [[Gaius Marius]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 153</ref>, and in that it is possibly the first time that the Roman legions fought after their reorganization under the [[Marian reforms]], although it is possible that these reforms did not take effect until Marius' involvement in the Cimbrian War. However, it also marked the point at which Rome began to fear its own soldiers<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 29</ref>.

===Resurgence of the Celtic threat (121-101 BC)===
{{Campaignbox Cimbrian War}}

By 121 BC, memories of Rome itself being sacked by Celtic tribes from Gaul were still prominent despite their historical distance, but Rome was soon to face a resurgent Celtic threat twice more within the next twenty years.

First, in 121 BC, Rome came into contact with the Celtic tribes of the [[Allobroges]] and the [[Arverni]], both of which they defeated with apparent in ease in the [[First Battle of Avignon (121 BC)First Battle of Avignon]] and the [[Second Battle of Avignon (121 BC)|Second Battle of Avignon]], both in 121 BC, near the Rhone river the same year<ref>The History of Rome, p. 152</ref>.

The [[Cimbrian War]] ([[113 BC|113]]-[[101 BC]]) was a ar more serious affair that the clashes in 121 BC.  The [[Celtic]]-[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes of the [[Cimbri]] and the [[Teutons]] migrated from northern Europe into Rome's northern territories<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 75</ref>, and clashed with Rome and her allies<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 6</ref>. The Cimbrian War was the first time since the [[Second Punic War]] that [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]] and [[Rome]] itself had been seriously threatened and caused great fear in Rome<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 6</ref> prior to its successful resolution, after the Cimbri inadvertently granted the Romans a reprieve by diverting to plunder Spain, allowing Rome to carefully prepare for and successfully meet them in battle<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 75</ref>.

===Internal unrest (135-71 BC)===
{{Campaignbox Servile Wars}}
{{Campaignbox Ancient Unification of Italy}}
The extensive campaigning abroad by Roman generals, and the rewarding of soldiers with plunder on these campaigns, led to a worrying trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their generals over the state, and willing to follow them against the state<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 39</ref>. Rome was also plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because during this period vast tracts of land were given over to slave farming in which the slaves greatly outnumbered their Roman masters.  In the last century before the common era at least twelve [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars and rebellions]] occurred. This pattern did not break until Octavian (later ''[[Caesar Augustus]]'') ended it by becoming a successful challenger to the Senate's authority, and was made ''[[princeps]]'' (emperor).

Between 135 BC and 71 BC there were three [[Roman Servile Wars|"Servile Wars"]] involving slave uprisings against the Roman state, the third and final uprising the most serious<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 77</ref>, involving ultimately 150,000 revolting slaves<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 43</ref>. Additionally, in 91 BC the [[Social War]] broke out between Rome and its former allies in Italy<ref>The History of Rome, p. 156</ref> over dissent among the allies that they shared the risk of Rome's military campaigns, but not its rewards<ref>Antiquity, p. 167</ref><ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 30</ref><ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 75</ref>. Despite defeats such as the [[Battle of Fucine Lake]], the professional Roman troops defeated the Italian [[militia]]s in decisive engagements, notably the [[Battle of Asculum (89 BC)|Battle of Asculum]]. Despite their military defeat the ''Socii'' achieved their objectives with the [[Lex Julia]] and [[Lex Plautia Papiria]] and more than 500,000 Italians were granted citizenship<ref>Antiquity, p. 167</ref>.

The internal unrest reached its most serious in the two civil wars or marches upon Rome of the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] at the beginning of 82 BC. In the [[Battle of the Colline Gate]] at the very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Roman senate, along with some Samnite allies<ref>The History of Rome, p. 161</ref>. Whatever the rights and wrongs of his grievances against those in power of the state, his actions marked a watershed of Roman fighting Roman that was to pave the way for the wars of the [[triumvirate]], the overthrowing of the Senate as the ''de facto'' head of the Roman state, and the eventual [[Roman usurper|endemic usurpation of the later Empire]].

===Conflicts with Mithridates (89-63 BC)===
{{Campaignbox First Mithridatic War}}
{{Campaignbox Second Mithridatic War}}
{{Campaignbox Third Mithridatic War}}
[[Mithridates the Great]], was the ruler of Pontus, a large kingdom in Asia Minor, from 120 to 63 BC. He is remembered as one of Rome's most formidable and successful enemies who engaged three of the most prominent generals of the late Roman Republic: Sulla, Lucullus, and Pompey the Great. In a pattern familiar from the Punic Wars, the Romans came into conflict with him after their spheres of influence began to overlap: Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom and Rome for her part seemed equally keen for war and the loot and prestige it might bring<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 76</ref>. After conquering western Anatolia in 88 BC, Mithridates allegedly ordered the killing of the 80,000 Romans living there<ref>The History of Rome, p. 158</ref>. The alleged massacre may have been invented or exaggerated by the Romans but it was the official reason given for the launch of the [[First Mithridatic War]]. Lucius Cornelius Sulla forced Mithridates out of Greece proper after the [[Battle of Chaeronea (86 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] and later [[Battle of Orchomenus]] but then had to return to Italy to answer the threat posed by Marius; subsequently, Mithridates VI was defeated but not beaten. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved a mere temporary setback.

The [[Second Mithridatic War]] began when Rome tried to annex Bithnyia as a province. First [[Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] and then Pompey the Great were sent against Mithridates. Mithridates was at last defeated by Pompey in the [[Third Mithridatic War]].

===Campaign against the Cilician pirates (67 BC)===
{{Campaignbox Rome against the Cilician Pirates}}
The Mediterranean had at this time fallen into the hands of [[pirates]], largely from [[Cilicia]], since Rome had destroyed many of the states that had previously policed the sea with fleets, but had failed to step into the gap created<ref>The History of ROme, p. 165</ref>. The pirates had not only strangled shipping lanes but had plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia, and had even made descents upon Italy itself<ref>Rubicon, p. 170</ref>. After [[Marcus Antonius]] failed to clear the pirates, [[Pompey]] was nominated his successor as commander of a special naval task force to campaign against the pirates. It took Pompey supposedly just forty days to clear the western portion of the sea of pirates<ref>Cicero, ''Pro Lege Manilia'', 12 or De Imperio Cn. Pompei (in favour of the Manilian Law on the command of Pompey), 66 BC.</ref>, and restore communication between Spain, Africa, and Italy, defeating the pirates in the [[Battle of Korakesion]]. He first swept their craft from the Mediterranean and followed the main body of the pirates to their strongholds on the coast of [[Cilicia]]; and after defeating their fleet, he induced a great part of them, by promises of pardon, to surrender to him. Many of these he settled at Soli, which was henceforward called Pompeiopolis.

===Caesar's early campaigns (59-50 BC)===
[[Image:Caesar campaigns gaul.gif|thumb|305px|right|Map of the Gallic Wars]]
{{Campaignbox Gallic Wars}}
After a term as consul [[Julius Caesar]] was appointed to a five year term as Proconsular Governor of Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (the coast of Dalmatia)<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 58</ref>. Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul, which would give him the dramatic military success he sought<ref>In The Name of Rome, p. 187</ref>. To this end he stirred up popular nightmares of the first sack of Rome by the Gauls and the more recent spectre of the Cimbri and Teutones<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 187</ref>. When the [[Helvetii]] began to migrate on a route that would take them near (not into)<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 117</ref> the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his [[Gallic Wars]], fought between 58 BC and 49 BC<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 191</ref>. After slaughtering the Helvetii tribe, Caesar prosecuted a ''"long, bitter and costly"''<ref>Antiquity, p. 162</ref> campaign against other tribes across the breadth of Gaul, many of whom had fought alongside Rome against their common enemy the [[Helvetii]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 117</ref>, a campaign that Plutarch claims cost a million Gallic lives<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 48</ref> and annexed them to Rome. Although ''"fierce and able"''<ref>Antiquity, p. 162</ref> the Gauls were handicapped by internal disunity<ref>Antiquity, p. 162</ref><ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 116</ref>.

Caesar defeated the [[Helvetii]] in 58 BC at the [[Battle of the Arar]] and [[Battle of Bibracte]]<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 59</ref>, the Belgic confederacy at the [[Battle of the Axona]], the Nervii in 57 BC at the [[Battle of the Sabis]]<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 201</ref> and the Veneti in 56 BC. On [[August 26]] 55 and 54 BC he made [[Roman invasion of Britain|two expeditions to Britain]]<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 60</ref>. In 52 BC, following the [[Siege of Avaricum]] and a string of inconclusive battles<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 204</ref>, Caesar defeated a union of Gauls led by [[Vercingetorix]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 78</ref> at the [[Battle of Alesia]]<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 62</ref><ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 212</ref>, completing the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul. By 50 BC, the entirety of Gaul lay in Roman hands<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 62</ref>, . Caesar recorded his own accounts of these campaigns in ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' ("Commentaries on the Gallic War").

According to Plutarch and the writings of scholar Brendan Woods, the whole campaign resulted in 800 conquered cities, 300 subdued tribes, one million men sold to slavery and another three million dead in battlefields. Ancient historians notoriously exaggerated numbers of this kind, but Caesar's conquest of Gaul was certainly the greatest military invasion since the campaigns of Alexander the Great.

The victory was also far more lasting than those of Alexander's: Gaul never regained its Celtic identity, never attempted another nationalist rebellion, and remained loyal to Rome until the fall of the Western Empire in 476. However, whilst Gaul itself was to thereafter remain loyal, cracks were appearing within the Roman triumvirate - partly over concerns over the loyalty of Caesar's Gallic legions to his person rather than the state<ref>Antiquity, p. 162</ref> - that were soon to dive Rome into a length series of civil wars.

===Triumvirates, Caesarian ascension, and revolt (53-30 BC)===
[[Image:Caesar_and_Pompey.JPG|305px|thumb|right|Busts of Caesar (left) and Pompey]]
{{Campaignbox Caesar's Civil War}}

By 59 BC an unofficial political alliance known as the [[First Triumvirate]] was formed between [[Gaius Julius Caesar]], [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], and [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] to share power and influence<ref>Antiquity, p. 168</ref>. It was always an uncomfortable alliance given that Crassus and Pompeius intensely disliked one another. In 53 BC, Crassus launched an invasion of the Parthian Empire. After initial successes<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 133</ref>, he marched his army deep into the desert<ref>Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans, p. 266</ref>; but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and routed at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 213</ref><ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 79</ref> in ''"the greatest Roman defeat since Hannibal"''<ref>Antiquity, p. 169</ref> in which Crassus himself perished<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 271</ref>. The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate; consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting against Vercingetorix in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome, which revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards Caesar<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 214</ref> and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's enemies. In 51 BC, there were demands that Caesar would not be permitted to stand for Consul unless he turned over control of his armies, and the same demands were made of Pompey by other factions<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 215</ref>. Relinquishing his army, of course, leave Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose Civil War over laying down his command and facing trial<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 215</ref>. The triumvirate was shattered and conflict was inevitable.

Pompey initially assured Rome and the senate that he could defeat Caesar should he march on Rome<ref>Rubicon, p. 299</ref><ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 216</ref>. However, by the spring of 49 BC, when Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his invading legions and swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome<ref>Rubicon, p. 299</ref><ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 216</ref>Caesar's army was still under-strength, with certain legions remaining in Gaul<ref>Rubicon, p. 299</ref>, but on the other hand Pompey himself only had two legions at his command, both with uncertain loyalty having served under Caesar<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 216</ref>. Tom Holland attributes Pompey's willingness to abandon Rome to waves on panicking refugees stirring ancestral fears of invasions from the north<ref>Rubicon, p. 298</ref>. Pompey's legions retreated south towards Brundisium<ref>Rubicon, p. 303</ref>, and then fled to Greece<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 216</ref>. Caesar first directed his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Spain<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 217</ref> but following campaigning by Caesar in the [[Siege of Massilia]] and [[Battle of Ilerda]] decided to tackle Pompey himself<ref>The Civil War, 81-92</ref><ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 218</ref>. Pompey initially defeated Caesar at the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Battle of Dyrrachium]] in 48 BC<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 220</ref> but failing to follow up on the victory, Pompey was decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48 BC<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 227</ref> despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one<ref>Rubicon, p. 312</ref>, and fled again to Egypt, where he was murdered in an attempt to ingratiate the country with Caesar and avoid a war<ref>Antiquity, p. 169</ref><ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 227</ref>.

Pompey's death did not see the end of the civil wars since initially Pompey's supporters continued to fight on after his death. In 46 BC Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army when his former commander [[Titus Labienus]], who had defected to the Pompeians several years earlier, defeated him at the [[Battle of Ruspina]]. However, after this low point Caesar came back to defeat the Pompeian army of [[Metellus Scipio]] in the [[Battle of Thapsus]], after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Spain. Caesar defeated the combined forces of Titus Labienus and Gnaeus Pompey the Younger at the [[Battle of Munda]] in Spain. Labienus was killed in the battle and the Younger Pompey captured and executed.

Despite his military success, or probably because of it, fear spread of Caesar becoming an autocratic ruler of the state, thus ending the Roman Republic. This fear drove a group of senators naming themselves [[Brutus|The Liberators]] to assassinate him in 44 BC<ref>Antiquity, p. 170</ref>. Further civil war followed between those loyal to Caesar and those who supported the actions of the The Liberators. Caesar's supporter Mark Anthony declaimed Caesar's assassins and war broke out between Caesar's supporters and the supporters of the assassins. Antony was denounced as a public enemy, and Octavian was entrusted with the command of the war against him. In the [[Battle of Forum Gallorum]] Antony, besieging Caesar's assassin Decimus Brutus in [[Mutina]], defeated the forces of the consul Pansa, who was killed, but Antony was then immediately defeated by the army of the other consul, Hirtius. At the [[Battle of Mutina]] Antony was again defeated in battle by Hirtius, who was killed. Although Antony failed to capture Mutina, Decimus Brutus was murdered shortly thereafter.

Octavian betrayed his party, and came to terms with Caesarians Antony and Lepidus and on [[26 November]] 43 BC the [[Second Triumvirate]] was formed<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 237</ref>, this time in an official capacity<ref>Antiquity, p. 170</ref>. In 42 BC [[Triumvir]]s [[Marc Antony]] and [[Augustus|Octavian]] fought the indecisive [[Battle of Philippi]] with Caesar's assassins [[Marcus Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]]. Although Brutus defeated Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide. Brutus also committed suicide shortly afterwards.

However, civil war flared again when the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and [[Mark Anthony]] failed just as the first had almost as soon as its opponents had been removed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base and then launched a campaign against Mark Anthony<ref>Antiquity, p. 170</ref>. Together with Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony's brother, [[Fulvia]] raised eight legions in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian but she was defeated by Octavian at the [[Battle of Perugia]]. Her death led to partial reconciliation between Octavian and Anthony who went on to crush the army of [[Sextus Pompeius]], the last focus of opposition to the second triumvirate, in the naval [[Battle of Naulochus]].

As before, once opposition to the triumvirate was crushed, it started to tear at itself. The triumvirate expired on the last day of 33 BC and was not renewed in law and in 31 BC, the war started. At the [[Battle of Actium]], [[Augustus|Octavian]] decisively defeated Antony and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]] in a naval battle near Greece, using fire to destroy the enemy fleet<ref>The Roman History:The Reign of Augusutus, p. 61</ref>.

Octavian went on to become Emperor and, in the absence of political assassins or usurpers, was able to greatly expand the borders of the Empire.

Under emperors secure from interior enemies, such as [[Augustus]] and [[Trajan]], the military achieved great territorial gains in both the East and the West. In the West, following humiliating defeats at the hands of the [[Sugambri]], [[Tencteri]] and [[Usipetes]] tribes in 16 BC<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 244</ref>, Roman armies pushed north and west out of Gaul to subdue much of Germania. The [[Pannonian revolt]] in AD 6<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 244</ref> forced the Romans to cancel their plan to cement their conquest of Germany by invading [[Bohemia]]<ref>Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 37</ref> for the moment<ref>The History of Rome, p. 208</ref>. Despite the loss of several legions almost to the man in [[Publius Quinctilius Varus|Varus]]' famous defeat at the hands of the Germanic leader [[Arminius]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in 9 AD<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 245</ref><ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 159</ref>, Rome recovered and continued its expansion up to and beyond the borders of the known world. Roman legions under [[Germanicus]] pursued several more campaigns against the Germannic tribes of the [[Marcomanni]], [[Hermunduri]], [[Chatti]], [[Cherusci]], [[Bructeri]], and [[Marsi]]<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 143-144</ref>. Overcoming several mutinies in the armies along the Rhine<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 248</ref>, Germanicus defeated the German tribes of Arminius in a series of battles culminating in  the [[Battle of the Weser River]]<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 260</ref> and went on to [[Roman invasion of Britain|invade Britain]]. 

After [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|preliminary low-scale invasions of Britain]], the Romans [[Roman conquest of Britain|invaded Britain in force]] in 43 AD forcing their way inland through several battles against British tribes, including the [[Battle of the Medway]], the [[Battle of the Thames]], and the [[Battle of Caer Caradoc]]. Following a general uprising<ref>Tacitus, Annals 14.29-39, Agricola 14-16</ref><ref>Dio Cassius, Roman History 62.1-12</ref> in which the Britons sacked [[Sack of Camulodunum|Colchester]], [[Sack of Verulamium|St Albans]] and [[Sack of Londinium|London]]<ref>George Patrick Welch, Britannia: The Roman Conquest & Occupation of Britain, 1963, p. 107</ref>,  the Romans suppressed the rebellion in the [[Battle of Watling Street]]<ref>Tacitus, Annals 14.37</ref><ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 189</ref> and went on to push as far north as central Scotland in the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]]<ref>James Fraser, The Roman Conquest Of Scotland: The Battle Of Mons Graupius AD 84</ref>. Tribes in modern-day Scotland and Northern England repeatedly rebelled against Roman rule and two legionary bases were established in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] to protect against rebellion and incursions from the north, and who built and manned [[Hadrian's Wall]].

Back on the continent, the extension of the Empire's borders beyond the Rhine hung in the balance for some time, with the emperor [[Caligula]] apparently poised to invade in AD 39, and [[Cnaeus Domitius Corbulo]] crossing the Rhine in 47 AD and marching into the territory of the [[Frisii]] and [[Chauci]]<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 269</ref> before his successor [[Claudius]] ordered the suspension of further attacks across the Rhine<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 269</ref>, setting what was to become the permanent limit of the Empire's expansion in this direction<ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 38</ref>. 

In the East, [[Trajan]] turned his attention to [[Dacia]], an area north of Macedon and Greece and east of the Danube that had been on the Roman radar since before the days of Caesar<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 322</ref><ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 213</ref> when they had beaten a Roman army at the [[Battle of Histria]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 215</ref>. In 85, the Dacians had swarmed over the Danube and pillaged Moesia<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 216</ref> and initially defeated a legion the Emperor Domitian sent against them<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 217</ref>, but the Romans were victorious in the [[Battle of Tapae (88)|Battle of Tapae]] in 88 AD and a truce was drawn up<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 217</ref>.

Emperor Trajan recommenced hostilities against Dacia and, following an uncertain number of battles<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 219</ref>, defeated the Dacian general [[Decebalus]] in the [[Battle of Tapae (101)|Second Battle of Tapae]] in 101 AD and with Trajan's troops pressing towards the Dacian capital [[Sarmizegethusa]], Decebalus once more sought terms<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 329</ref>. Decebalus rebuilt his power and attacked Roman garrisons again in 105 AD, and in response Trajan again marched into Dacia<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 222</ref>, besieging the Dacian capital in the [[Siege of Sarmizethusa]], and razing it to the ground<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 223</ref>. With Dacia quelled, Trajan subsequently [[Trajan's invasion of the Parthian Empire|invaded the Parthian empire]], his conquests taking the Roman Empire to its greatest extent. Rome's borders in the east were governed more through a system of [[client states]] for some time, leading to indirect rule and less direct campaigning than in the west in this period<ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 39</ref>.

Further east, ancient Armenia between the [[Black Sea]] and [[Caspian Sea]] became a focus of contention between Rome and the [[Persian Empire]] and control of the region was repeatedly gained and lost. The Parthians forced Armenia into submission from 37 AD but in 47 AD the Romans retook control of the kingdom and offered it [[client state|client kingdom]] status. Under Nero, the Romans fought a campaign between 55 AD and 63 AD against the Parthian Empire, which had again invaded Armenia. After gaining Armenia again in 60 AD and subsequently losing it again in 62 AD, the Romans sent [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]] in 63 AD into the territories of [[Vologases I]] of [[Parthia]], who succeeded in return Armenia to Roman client status, where it remained for the next century.

===Jewish revolts (66-135)===
{{Campaignbox_Jewish-Roman_wars}}
The first Jewish-Roman War, sometimes called The Great Revolt, was the first of three major rebellions by the Jews of Judaea Province against the Roman Empire<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 294</ref>. Judea was already a troubled region with bitter violence among several competing Jewish sects<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 294</ref> and a long history of rebellion<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 192</ref> - Tacitus describes them as regarding the ''"the rest of mankind with all the hatred of enemies"''<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 194</ref>. The Jews' anger turned on Rome following robberies from their temples and Roman insensitivity - Tacitus says disgust and repulsion<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 194</ref> - towards their religion. The Jews began to prepare for armed revolt. Earlier successes including the repulse of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (66)First|Siege of Jerusalem]]<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 295</ref> and the [[Battle of Beth-Horon]]<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 295</ref> only attracted greater attention from Rome and Emperor Nero appointed general Vespasian to crush the rebellion. Vespasian led the legions [[Legio X Fretensis|X ''Fretensis'']] and [[Legio V Macedonica|V ''Macedonica'']] in a methodical clearance of the areas in revolt. By the year 68, Jewish resistance in the North had been crushed. A few towns and cities held out for a few years before falling to the Romans, leading to the [[Masada|siege of Masada]] in 74 AD<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 146</ref> and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Second Siege of Jerusalem]]<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 292</ref>.

In 115, revolt broke out again in the province, leading to the second Jewish-Roman war known as the [[Kitos War]], and again in 132 in what is known as [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]]. Both were brutally crushed.

===Struggle with Parthia (161-217)===
{{Campaignbox Roman-Parthian Wars}}
Further south, the Arascid dynasty ruled over the Parthian Empire. Mostly due to their invention of heavy cavalry, Parthia was the arch-enemy of the Roman Empire in the east. As early as 53 BC, the Roman general Crassus had invaded Parthia, but was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae but as we have seen in the years following the battle of Carrhae the Romans were divided in civil war and hence unable to campaign against Parthia. Trajan also campaigned against the Parthians and briefly captured their capital, putting a puppet ruler on the throne, but rebellions with the province and the Jewish revolts in Judea made it difficult to maintain the captured province and the territories were abandoned.

A revitalized Parthian Empire renewed its assault in 161, defeating two Roman armies and invading Armenia and Syria. Joint emperor [[Lucius Verus]] and general [[Gaius Avidius Cassius]] were sent in 162 to counter the resurgent Parthia. In this war, the city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was burned to the ground by Avidius Cassius in 164. The Parthians made peace but were forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans<ref>The History of Rome, p. 273</ref>.

In 197, Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] waged a brief and successful war against the Parthian Empire in retaliation for the support given to rival for the imperial throne [[Pescennius Niger]]. The Parthian capital Ctesiphon was sacked by the legions, and the northern half of Mesopotamia was restored to Rome.

Emperor [[Caracalla]], the son of Severus, marched on Parthia in 217 from Edessa to begin a war against them, but he was assassinated while on the march<ref>The History of ROme, p. 279</ref>. In 224, the Parthian Empire was crushed not by the Romans but by the rebellious Persian vassal king Ardashir revolted, leading to the establishment of the Persian or [[Sassanid Empire]], which replaced Parthia as Rome's major rival in the East.

Throughout the Parthian wars, tribal groups along the Rhine and Danube took advantage of Rome's preoccupation with the eastern frontier (and the plague that Romans suffered from after bringing it back form the east) and launched a series of raids and incursions into Rome's territories, including the [[Marcomannic Wars]].

==Late Roman Empire (180 AD - 476 AD)==
===Migration period (163-378)===
[[Image:Alemanni_expansion.png|thumb|305px|Area settled by the Alamanni, and sites of Roman-Alamannic battles, 3rd to 6th century]]
{{Campaignbox Rome against the Alamanni}}
{{Campaignbox Gothic Migration}}
{{Campaignbox Frankish Migration}}
{{Campaignbox Early Vandal Migration}}
After Varus' defeat in Germania in the first century, Rome had adopted a largely defensive strategy along the border with Germania, constructing a line of defences known as ''[[limes]]'' along the Rhine. Although the exact historicity is unclear, since the Romans often assigned one name to several distinct tribal groups, or conversely applied several names to a single group at different times, some mix of Germanic peoples, Celts, and tribes of mixed Celto-Germanic ethnicity were settled in the lands of Germania from the first century onwards. The [[Cherusci]], [[Bructeri]], [[Marsi]], and [[Chatti]] of Varus' time had by the third century either evolved into or been displaced by a confederacy or alliance of Germanic tribes collectively known as the [[Alamanni]], first mentioned by Cassius Dio describing the campaign of Caracalla in 213.

In around 166 AD, seveal german tribes pushed across the Danube, striking as far as Italy itself in the [[Siege of Aquileia]] in 166 AD<ref>The History of Rome, p. 273</ref>, and the heartland of Greece in the [[Sack of Eleusis]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 273</ref>.

Although the essential problem of large tribal groups on the frontier remained much the same as the situation Rome faced in earlier centuries, the third century saw a marked increase in the overall threat<ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 146</ref><ref>The History of Rome, p. 282</ref>, although there is disagreement over whether external pressure increased, or Rome's ability to meet it declined<ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 150</ref>. The [[Carpi]] and [[Sarmatians]] whom Rome had held at bay were replaced by the [[Goths]], the [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]] that Rome had defeated were replaced by the [[Alamanni]]<ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 147</ref>.

The assembled warbands of the Alamanni frequently crossed the ''limes'', attacking Germania Superior such that they were almost continually engaged in conflicts with the Roman Empire, such as the [[Battle of Philippopolis]] in 250 and the  [[Battle of Abrittus]] in 251, whilst Goths and [[Heruli]] ravaged the Aegean and, later, Greece, Thrace and Macedonia<ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 147</ref>. However, their first major assault deep into Roman territory came in 268. In that year the Romans were forced to denude much of their German frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion by another new Germanic tribal confederacy, the [[Visigoths]], from the east. The pressure of tribal groups pushing into the Empire was the end result of a chain of migrations with its roots far to the east<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 624</ref>: Asian [[Huns]] from the Russian steppe attacked the [[Goths]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 270</ref><ref>The History of Rome, p. 322</ref>, who in turn attacked the [[Dacians]], [[Alans]] and [[Sarmatians]] at or inside Rome's borders<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 196</ref>.The Visigoths first appeared in history as a distinct people in this invasion of 268 when swarmed over the Balkan peninsula and overran the Roman provinces of Pannonia and Illyricum and even threatened Italia itself.

The Alemanni seized the opportunity to launch a major invasion of Gaul and northern Italy. However, the Visigoths were defeated in battle that summer near the modern Italian-Slovenian border and then routed in the [[Battle of Naissus]]<ref>The Hitory of Rome, p. 285</ref> that September by [[Gallienus]], [[Claudius II|Claudius]] and [[Aurelian]], who then turned and defeated the Alemanni at the [[Battle of Lake Benacus]]. Claudius' successor [[Aurelian]] defeated the Goths twice more in the [[Battle of Fanum Fortunae]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 285</ref> and the [[Battle of Ticinum]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 285</ref>. The Visigoths remained a major threat to the Empire but directed their attacks away from Italy itself for several years after their defeat.

The Alemanni on the other hand resumed their drive towards Italy almost immediately. They defeated [[Aurelian]] at the [[Battle of Placentia]] in 271 but were beaten back for a short time after they lost the battles of [[Battle of Fano|Fano]] and [[Battle of Pavia (271)|Pavia]] later that year. They were beaten again in 298 at the battles of [[Battle of Lingones|Lingones]] and [[Battle of Vindonissa|Vindonissa]] but fifty years later they were resurgent again, making incursions in 356 at the [[Battle of Reims (356)|Battle of Reims]]<ref>In the name of Rome, p. 344</ref>, in 357 at the [[Battle of Strasbourg (357)|Battle of Strasbourg]]<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 345</ref>, in 367 at the [[Battle of Solicinium]] and in 378 at [[Battle of Argentovaria]]. In the same year the   - [[Visigoth]]s inflicted a crushing defeat on the Eastern Empire, at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in which the Eastern Emperor [[Valens]] was massacred along with tens of thousands of Roman troops<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 534</ref>.

At the same time, [[Franks]] raided through the North Sea and the [[English Channel]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 284</ref>, [[Vandals]] pressed across the Rhine, [[Iuthungi]] against the Danube, [[Iazyges]], [[Carpi]] and [[Taifali]] harassed Dacia, and [[Gepids]] joined the Goths and Heruli in attacks round the Black Sea<ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 149</ref>. At around the same time, lesser-known tribes such as the [[Bavares]], [[Baquates]] and [[Quinquegentanei]] raided Africa<ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 149</ref>.

At the start of the fifth century AD, the pressure on Rome's western borders was growing intense. However, it wasn't only the western borders that were under threat: Rome was under threat both internally and on its eastern borders.

===Usurpers (193-394)===
{{Campaignbox Crisis of the Third Century}}
{{Campaignbox Constantine Wars}}
{{Campaignbox Fourth Century Roman Civil Wars}}
Lacking support for the emperor among his military meant that commanders could establish sole control of the legions they were responsible for and usurp the imperial throne. The so-called [[Crisis of the Third Century]] describing the turmoil of murder, usurpation and infighting is traditionally seen as developing with the murder of the Emperor [[Alexander Severus]] in [[235]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 280</ref>. However, [[Cassius Dio]] marks the wider imperial decline as beginning in 180 AD with ascension of [[Commodus]] to the throne<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 226</ref>, a judgement with which [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] concurred<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 113</ref>, and [[Philip Matyszak|Matyszak]] states that ''"the rot... had become established long before"'' even that<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 226</ref>.

Though the crisis of the third century was not the absolute beginning of Rome's decline, nevertheless it did mark a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one another as they had not done since the final days of the Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers claimed themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire for months or days,a ll but two meeting with a violent end<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 227</ref>. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 133</ref>. Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the break up of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.

The situation was complex, often with 3 or more usurpers in existence at once. [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Pescennius Niger]], both rebel generals promoted as emperors by the legions they commanded, clashed for the first time in 193 AD at the [[Battle of Cyzicus (193)|Battle of Cyzicus]], in which Niger was defeated. However, it took two further defeats at the [[Battle of Nicaea]] later that year and the [[Battle of Issus (194)|Battle of Issus]] the following year, for Niger to be definitively defeated. Almost as soon as Niger's hopes of the imperial crown had been laid to rest, Severus was forced to deal with another rival for the throne in the person of [[Clodius Albinus]], who had originally been allied to Severus. Albinus was proclaimed emperor by his troops in Britain and, crossing over to Gaul, defeated Severus' general [[Virius Lupus]] in battle, before being in turn defeated and killed himself in the [[Battle of Lugdunum]] by Severus himself.

After this turmoil, Severus faced no more internal threats for the rest of his reign<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 129</ref>, and the reign of his successor [[Caracalla]] passed uninterrupted for a while until he was murdered by [[Macrinus]]<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 129</ref>, who proclaimed himsef emperor in his place. Despite Macrinus having his position ratified by the Roman senate, the troops of [[Elagabalus|Varius Avitus]] declared him to be emperor instead, and the two met in battle at the [[Battle of Antioch (218)|Battle of Antioch]] in 218 AD, in which Macrinus was defeated<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 130</ref>. However, Avitus himself - taking the imperial name Elagabalus - was murdered shortly afterwards<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 130</ref> and [[Alexander Severus]] was proclaimed emperor by both the Praetorian Guard and the senate who, after a short reign, was murdered in turn<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 130</ref>. His murderers were working on behalf of the army who were unhappy with their lot under his rule and who raised in his place [[Maximinus Thrax]]. However, just as he had been raised by the army, Maximinus was also brought down by them and despite winning the [[Battle of Carthage (238)|Battle of Carthage]] against the senate's newly-proclaimed [[Gordian II]], he was murdered<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 131</ref> when it appeared to his forces as though he would not be able to best the next senatorial candidate for the throne, Gordian [[III]].

Gordian III's fate is not certain, although he may have been murdered by his own successor, [[Philip the Arab]], who ruled for only a few years before the army again raised a general to proclaimed emperor, this time [[Decius]], who defeated Philip in the [[Battle of Verona]] to seize the throne<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 135</ref>. Several succeeding generals avoided battling usurpers for the throne chiefly by virtue of being murdered by their own troops before battle could commence, which at least relieved the empire momentarily of manpower losses to internal strife. The lone exception to this rule was [[Gallienus]], emperor from 260 AD to 268 AD, who saw off a [[Gallienus usurpers|remarkable array of usurpers]], most of whom he saw off in battle. The army was therefore spared further infighting probably until 273 AD, when Aurelian defeated the Gallic usurper [[Tetricus I|Tetricus]] in the [[Battle of Chalons (273)|Battle of Chalons]]. The next decade saw a barely credible number of usurpers, sometimes 3 at the same time, all vying for the imperial throne. Most of the battles are not recorded, primarily due to the turmoil of the time, until [[Diocletian]], a usurper himself, defeated [[Carinus]] at the [[Battle of the Margus]] to become emperor.

Some small measure of stability again returned at this point, with the empire split into a Tetrarchy of two greater and two lesses emperors, a system that staved off civil wars for a short time until 312 AD. In that year, relations between the tetrarchy collapsed for good and [[Constantine I]], [[Licinius]], [[Maxentius]] and [[Maximinus]] jostled for control of the empire. In the [[Battle of Turin (312)|Battle of Turin]] Constantine defeated Maxentius, and in the [[Battle of Tzirallum]] [[Licinius]] defeated [[Maximinus]]. From 314 AD onwards, Constantine defeated Licinius in the [[Battle of Cibalae]], then the [[Battle of Mardia]], and then again at the [[Battle of Adrianople (324)|Battle of Adrianople]], the [[Battle of the Hellespont]] and the [[Battle of Chrysopolis]].

Constantine then turne to Maxentius, beating him in the [[Battle of Verona (312)|Battle of Verona]] and the [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]] in the same year. Constantine's son [[Constantius II]] inherited his father's rule and later defeated the usurper [[Magnentius]] in first the [[Battle of Mursa Major]] and then the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]].

Successive emperors [[Valens]] and [[Theodosius I]] also defeated usurpers in, repsectively, the  [[Battle of Thyatira]], and the battles of [[Battle of the Save|the Save]] and [[Battle of the Frigidus|the Frigidus]].

===Struggle with the Sassanid Empire (230-363)===
{{Campaignbox Roman-Sassanid Wars}}
After overthrowing the Parthian confederacy<ref>The History of Rome, p. 283</ref>, the [[Sassanid Empire]] that arose from its remains pursued a more aggressive expansionist policy than their predecessors<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 234</ref><ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 151</ref> and continued to make war against Rome. In 230 AD, the first Sassanid emperor attacked Roman territory in first [[Armenia]] and then [[Mesopotamia]]<ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 151</ref> but Roman losses were largely restored by [[Severus]] within a few years<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 234</ref>. In 243, Emperor [[Gordian III]]'s army retook the Roman cities of Hatra, Nisibis and Carrhae from the Sassanids after defeating the Sassanids at the [[Battle of Resaena]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 235</ref>but  what happened next is unclear: Persian sources claim that Gordian III was defeated and killed in the [[Battle of Misikhe]]<ref>Shapur, Deeds of the God-Emperor Shapur</ref> but Roman sources mention this battle as insignificant setback and suggest that Gordian died elsewhere<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 236</ref>.

Certainly, the Sassanids had not been cowed by the previous battles with Rome and in 253 the Sassanids under [[Shapur I]] penetrated several times deeply into Roman territory, defeating a Roman force at the [[Battle of Barbalissos]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 236</ref> and conquering and plundering [[Antiochia]] in 252 following the [[Siege of Antiochia]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 236</ref><ref>The History of Rome, p. 283</ref>. The Romans recovered Antioch by 253 AD<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 237</ref>, and Emperor Valerian gathered an army and marched eastward to the Sassanid borders. In 260 at the [[Battle of Edessa]] the Sassanids defeated the Roman army<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 237</ref> and captured the Roman Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]]<ref>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 151</ref><ref>The History of Rome, p. 283</ref>.

There was a lasting peace between Rome and the Sassanid Empire between 297 and 337 following a treaty between [[Narseh]] and Emperor [[Diocletian]]. However, just before the death of [[Constantine I]] in 337, [[Shapur II]] broke the peace and began a twenty-six year conflict, attempting with little success to conquer Roman fortresses in the region. After early Sassanid successes including the [[Battle of Amida]] in 359 AD and the [[Siege of Pirisabora]] in 363 AD<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 358</ref>, Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]]  met Shapur II in 363 in the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (363)|Battle of Ctesiphon]] outside the walls of the Persian capital<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 358</ref>. The Romans were victorious but were unable to take the city, and were forced to retreat due to being in the middle of hostile territory. Julian was killed in the [[Battle of Samarra]] during the retreat, possibly by one of his own men<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 358</ref>.

There were several future wars, although all brief and small-scale, since both the Romans and the Sassanids were forced to deal with threats from other directions during the fifth century. A war against [[Bahram V]] in 420 over the persecution of the Christians in Persia led to a brief war that was soon concluded by treaty and in 441 a war with [[Yazdegerd II]] was again swiftly concluded by treaty after both parties battled threats elsewhere.

===Collapse of the Western Empire (402-476)===
[[Image:476eur.jpg|thumb|right|305px|Europe in 476, from ''Muir's Historical Atlas'' (1911).]]
{{Campaignbox Fall of Western Roman Empire}}
There have been many theories advanced for the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], and many dates given for its fall, from the onset of its decline in the third century<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 361</ref> to the fall of Constantinople in 1453<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 231</ref>. Militarily, however, the Empire finally fell after first being overrun by various non-Roman peoples and then having its heart in Italy seized by Germanic troops in a revolt. The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians deny that the Empire fell at all at this point. They are able to hold this position since the decline of the Empire had been a long and gradual process rather than a single event.

The Empire became gradually less romanized and increasingly Germanic in nature: although the Empire buckled under Visigoth assault, the overthrow of the last Emperor [[Romulus Augustus]] was carried out by federated Germanic troops from within the Roman army rather than foreign troops. In this sense had Odoacer not renounced the title of Emperor and named himself "King of Italy" instead, the Empire might have continued in name. Its identity, however, was no longer Roman - it was increasingly populated and governed by Germanic peoples long before 476. The Roman people were by the fifth century "''bereft of their military ethos''"<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 285</ref> and the Roman army itself a mere supplement to federated troops of Goths, Huns, Franks and others fighting on their behalf.

Rome's last gasp began when the Visigoths poured across the Danube once more in around 398 AD. Led by [[Alaric I]], they attempted to seize Constantinople<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 551</ref>, but were rebuffed and instead plundered much of Greece<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 260</ref>.In 402 AD they besieged Mediolanum, the capital of Roman Emperor [[Honorius]], defended by Roman Gothic troops. The arrival of the Roman [[Stilicho]] and his army forced Alaric to relieve the siege and move towards Hasta (modern Asti) in western Italy, where Stilicho attacked it at the [[Battle of Pollentia]]<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 563</ref>, capturing Alaric's familiars, while the Alan Saul, general of the Roman army, captured Alaric's camp. Stilicho offered to return the prisoners in exchange for the Visigoths returning to Illyricum but upon arriving at Verona, Alaric stopped his retreat. Stilicho again attacked at the [[Battle of Verona]]<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 565</ref> and again defeated Alaric<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 263</ref>, forcing him to withdraw from Italy.

In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy itself, but were defeated. However, in 406 AD an unprecendented number of tribes took advantage of the freezing of the Rhine to cross ''en masse'': Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians swept across the river and met little resistance in the [[Sack of Moguntiacum]] and the [[Sack of Treviri]]<ref>The History of Rome, p. 324</ref>, completely over-running Gaul. Despite this grave danger, or perhaps because of it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by usurpation, in one of which Stilicho, Rome's foremost defender of the period, was put to death<ref>The History of ROme, p. 327</ref>.

It is in this climate that, despite his earlier setback, Alaric returned again in 410 and managed to [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack Rome]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 267</ref><ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 589</ref>. The Roman capital had already been moved to the Italian city of Ravenna<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 587</ref>, but some historians view 410 as an alternative date for the true fall of the Roman Empire. Without possession of Rome or many of its former provinces, and increasingly Germanic in nature, the Roman Empire after 410 had little in common with the earlier Empire. By 410 AD, Britain had been mostly denuded of Roman troops<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 560</ref>, and by 425 AD was no longer part of the Empire, and much of western Europe was under barbarian kingdoms rules by [[Vandals]], [[Suebians]], [[Visigoths]] and [[Burgundians]]<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 187</ref>.

Those made desperately thirsty by their injuries drank water so augmented with blood that in their misery it seemed as though they were forced to drink the very blood which had poured from their wounds"

The remainder of Rome's territory, if not its nature, was defended for several decades following 410 largely by [[Flavius Aëtius]], who managed to play off each of Rome's barbarian invaders against one another: in 436 he led a Hunnic army against the Visigoths at Arles, and again in 436 at the [[Battle of Narbonne (436)|Battle of Narbonne]], and then in 451  led a combined army including his former enemy the Visigoths against the Huns at the [[Battle of the Catalunian Plains]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 276</ref><ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 489</ref>, beating them so soundly that although they later sacked [[Concordia]], [[Altinum]] and [[Patavium]], they never again directly threatened Rome. Despite being the only clear champion of the Empire at this point Aëtius was slain by the Emperor [[Valentinian III]]s own hand, leading [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] to allegedly observe, "I am ignorant, sir, of your motives or provocations; I only know that you have acted like a man who has cut off his right hand with his left".<ref>Gibbon, E., ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', ch. 35</ref>.

Carthage, the second largest city in the empire, was lost along with much of North Africa in 439 AD to the Vandals<ref>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 618</ref>, and the fate of Rome seemed sealed. By 476, what remained of the Empire was completely in the hands of federated Germanic troops and when they revolted led by [[Odoacer]] and deposed [[Romulus Augustus]] there was nobody to stop them. Odoacer happened to hold the part of the Empire around Italy and Rome but other parts of the Empire were ruled by Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alans and others. The Empire in the West had fallen<ref>Storming the Heavens, p. 187</ref>, and its remnant in Italy was no longer Roman in nature. The [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Goths continued to fight over Rome and the surrounding area for many years, though by this point Rome's importance was negligible. Following years of grinding war the city was by 540 AD near-abandoned and desolate with much of its environment turned into an unhealthy marsh, an inglorious end for a city that once ruled much of the known world.

At this point, Roman military history becomes [[Byzantine military|Byzantine military history]].

==Assessment==

There can be few militaries, either ancient or modern, who have campaigned so widely and over such a long period as the Roman military. Despite Napoleon's famous assertion that ''"The Gauls were not conquered by the Roman legions, but by Caesar"''<ref>In the Name of Rome, p. 377</ref>, the fact remains that Romans were willing to absorb horrific losses of life in the pursuit of their campaigns.<ref>The Punic Wars, p. 96</ref>. Whilst Roman generals often shared in the fate of their soldiers, it was by the millions of soldiers of the Roman military that the greatest sacrifice was borne, and for much of Rome's history, its soldiers fought loyally and selflessly for the state and their homes. To paraphrase [[Rupert Brooke]]<ref>]http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ltg/projects/jtap/tutorials/intro/brooke/vsoldier.html The Soldier, ''The Solider'']</ref>, there must be many a corner of a foreign field throughout Europe, Asia and Africa that is, forever, Rome.

However, in the later Empire soldiers followed commanders for little more than the promise of gold<ref>The History of Rome, p. 280</ref>, and whilst the threat to Rome from external enemies was great, it should have been able to withstand it had the soldiers of the late Empire not been campaigning almost as often against one another, and its generals plotting on usurping the throne rather than supporting it<ref>The History of Rome, p. 332</ref>.

Whilst the traditional view has been that the Roman expansion was a noble enterprise that was justified in that it ''"carried the torch of civilization into the barbarian darkness"''<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 9</ref>, an alternative view has emerged recently that the flourishing of Rome that followed its military expansion occurred only at the expense of extinguishing other nascent, vibrant cultures, such as the [[Celts]] and [[Dacians]]<ref>The Enemies of Rome, p. 9</ref>. Perhaps the very fact that so much of the heritage, laws, institutions and concepts of western life are influenced by a Rome from which we have inherited so much<ref>The History of Rome, p. 1</ref> breeds the concept that Rome was the only culture with much to offer - that nothing much was lost in those cultures that the Roman military extinguished - and hides the fact that much of Europe developed from a flat Roman monoculture. It is not possible to know whether the cultures the Roman military so successfully bested would have brought the descendants of their regions tyranny, poverty and shame or glory, wealth and enlightenment. All that is certain is that those cultures ''were'' bested by Rome.
