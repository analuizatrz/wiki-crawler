The '''legal system of Singapore''' is based on the [[English common law]] system. Major areas of law – particularly [[administrative law]], [[Contract|contract law]], [[equity]] and [[Trust law#United Kingdom|trust law]], [[property law]] and [[Tort|tort law]] – are largely [[Law of Singapore#Judicial precedents|judge-made]], though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes. However, other areas of law are almost completely [[Law of Singapore#Legislation|statutory]] in nature. These include [[Criminal law of Singapore|criminal law]], [[Corporations law|company law]] and [[Family law of Singapore|family law]].

Apart from referring to relevant Singapore cases, judges continue to refer to English [[case law]] where the issues pertain to a traditional common-law area of law, or involve the interpretation of Singapore statutes based on English enactments or English statutes applicable in Singapore. These days, there is also a greater tendency to consider decisions of important [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions such as [[Law of Australia|Australia]] and [[Law of Canada|Canada]], particularly if they take a different approach from [[English law]].

Certain Singapore statutes are not based on English enactments but on legislation from other jurisdictions. In such situations, court decisions from those jurisdictions on the original legislation are often examined. Thus, [[India|Indian]] law is sometimes consulted in the interpretation of the [[Evidence Act]]<ref>Cap. 97, 1997 Rev. Ed. (S'pore), available on-line from [http://statutes.agc.gov.sg Singapore Statutes Online],</ref> and the [[Criminal law of Singapore#The Penal Code|Penal Code]]<ref>Cap. 224, 1985 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> which were based on Indian statutes.

On the other hand, where the interpretation of the [[Constitution of Singapore]] is concerned, courts remain reluctant to take into account foreign legal materials on the basis that a constitution should primarily be interpreted within its own four walls rather than in the light of analogies from other jurisdictions; and because economic, political, social and other conditions in foreign countries are perceived to be different.

Aspects of Singapore law are perceived to be harsh. Certain laws such as the [[Internal Security Act]]<ref>Cap. 143, 1985 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> (which authorizes detention without trial in certain circumstances) and the [[Societies Act]]<ref>Cap. 311, 1985 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> (which regulates the formation of associations) that were enacted during British rule in Singapore remain on the statute book, and both [[Caning in Singapore|corporal]] and [[Capital punishment in Singapore|capital punishment]] are still in use.

==History==
===Before 1826===

[[Image:StamfordRaffles.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles (6 July 1781 – 5 July 1826).]]

Modern Singapore was founded on [[6 February]] [[1819]] by Sir [[Stamford Raffles]], an officer of the [[British East India Company]] and Lieutenant-Governor of [[Bengkulu|Bencoolen]], in an attempt to counter Dutch domination of trade in the East. Permission for the East India Company to set up a 'factory' on the island was obtained from the [[Sultan of Johor]] and [[Temenggung]] of Johor on that date, and outright [[cession]] of Singapore took place in [[1824]]. It has been suggested that prior to British acquisition of the island, the [[Malay people|Malay]] chief in charge of Singapore was the Temenggung of Johor. The [[Johor Sultanate]] was the successor of the [[Malacca Sultanate]], both of which had their own codes of law. It is also possible that [[adat|adat law]], often inadequately translated as 'customary law', governed the inhabitants of the island prior to its acquisition by the British. However, little, if anything, is known about the laws that were actually applicable. The British have always assumed that no law prevailed on the island of Singapore when it was acquired.

In [[1823]] Raffles promulgated '[[Raffles' Regulations|Regulations]]' for the administration of the island. Regulation III of [[20 January]] [[1823]] established a [[Magistrate|magistracy]] which had jurisdiction over "all descriptions of persons resorting under the British flag". The magistrates were enjoined to "follow the course of the British magistracy, as far as local circumstances permit, avoiding technicalities and unnecessary forms as much as possible, and executing the duties of their office with temper and discretion, according to the best of their judgment and conscience and the principles of substantial justice". Raffles' Regulations were most likely illegal as he was acting beyond the scope of his legal powers in making them – although he had power to place the factory at Singapore under the jurisdiction of Bencoolen, he was not vested with power to place the entire island under Bencoolen's control. In this respect, he had treated Singapore as if the entire island had been ceded to the British when the Treaty with the Sultan and the Temenggung had only permitted the establishment of a trading factory.<ref>Kevin Tan Yew Lee, "A Short Legal and Constitutional History of Singapore" in {{cite book|last=Woon|first=Walter (ed.)|title=The Singapore Legal System|publisher=Longman|date=1989|location=Singapore|id=ISBN 9971-89-993-0 (pbk.)}}, p. 3 at p. 8.</ref>

The same year, Raffles appointed [[John Crawfurd]] as [[Resident (title)#Residents in (British) Asia|Resident]] of Singapore. Crawfurd doubted the legitimacy of the judicial system set up by Raffles, and annulled proceedings in which magistrates had ordered the flogging of gamblers and the seizure of their properties. He eventually abolished the magistracy, replacing it with a [[Court of Requests]] overseen by an Assistant Resident which dealt with minor civil cases, and a Resident's Court hearing all other cases which he himself presided over. Crawfurd had no authoritative guide to the applicable law, so he decided cases on "general principles of English law", taking into account so far as he could the "character and manners of the different classes" of local inhabitants.<ref>L.A. Mills, "British Malaya 1824–1867" (1960) XXXIII ''Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society'' Part 3, cited in Mavis Chionh, "The Development of the Court System" in {{cite book|last=Tan|first=Kevin Y.L. (Yew Lee) (ed.)|title=Essays in Singapore Legal History|publisher=Singapore Academy of Law; Marshall Cavendish Academic|date=2005|location=Singapore|id=ISBN 981-210-389-9 (hbk.); ISBN 981-210-349-X (pbk.)}}, p. 93 at p. 99.</ref> Unfortunately, Crawfurd's courts also lacked legal foundation, and he had no legal powers over Europeans in Singapore. Serious cases involving British subjects had to be referred to Calcutta; otherwise, all he could do was to banish them from the island.<ref>Chionh, ''id.'' at pp. 97–98.</ref>

Despite the dubious legal status of the courts established in Singapore by Raffles and Crawfurd, they indicate that the ''de facto'' position was that between 1819 and 1826 English legal principles applied to Singapore.<ref>Walter Woon, "The Applicability of English Law in Singapore" in Woon, ''The Singapore Legal System'', ''op. cit.'', p. 107 at pp. 112-113.</ref>

On [[24 June]] 1824 Singapore and Malacca were formally transferred to the East India Company's administration by the [[Transfer of Singapore to East India Company, etc. Act 1824]] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1820-1839#1824 (5 Geo.IV)|5 Geo. IV c. 108]]) (U.K.). By virtue of the [[Fort Marlborough in India Act 1802]] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1801-1819#42 Geo. III 2|42 Geo. III c. 29]]) (U.K.) both territories, together with others in the region ceded to Britain by [[the Netherlands]], became subordinate to the [[Bengal Presidency|Presidency]] of [[Fort William, India|Fort William]] in [[Bengal]], and under the [[Government of India Act 1800]] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1780-1800#39 & 40 Geo. III 2|39 & 40 Geo. III c. 79]]) (U.K.) these territories became subject to the [[jurisdiction]] of the [[Supreme Court]] of Fort William.

The [[Indian Salaries and Pensions Act 1825]] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1820-1839#1825 (6 Geo. IV)|6 Geo. IV c. 85]]) (U.K.) authorized the East India Company to place Singapore and Malacca under the administration of Prince of Wales' Island (now [[Penang]]). The Company did so, thus creating the [[Straits Settlements]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bartholomew|first=G.W. (Geoffrey Wilson)|coauthors=Elizabeth Srinivasagam & Pascal Baylon Netto|title=Sesquicentennial Chronological Tables of the Written Laws of the Republic of Singapore 1834-1984|publisher=Malaya Law Review, Malayan Law Journal|date=1987|location=Singapore|id=ISBN 9971-70-053-0}} at p. xxvii.</ref>

===1826–1867: The 'Indian period'===

[[Image:East India House THS 1817 edited.jpg|thumb|275px|The [[East India House]], the headquarters of the East India Company, in Leadenhall Street, London, as seen c. 1817; it was demolished in 1929.]]

The statute 6 Geo. IV c. 85 empowered the [[The Crown#United Kingdom|British Crown]] to issue [[letters patent]] providing for the administration of justice in the Straits Settlements. The East India Company petitioned the Crown for the grant of such letters patent establishing "such Courts and Judicatures for the due administration of Justice and the security of the persons rights and property of the Inhabitants and the Public Revenue of and the Trial and Punishment of Capital and other Offences committed and the repression of vice within the said Settlement of Prince of Wales’ Island Singapore and Malacca…"

Granting the petition, the Crown issued the [[Second Charter of Justice]] on [[27 November]] [[1826]].<ref>The [[First Charter of Justice]] of 1807 applied only to Prince of Wales' Island (Penang).</ref> The Charter established the [[Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Malacca]], which was conferred "full Power and Authority… to give and pass Judgment and Sentence according to Justice and Right". This key clause was later judicially interpreted to have introduced English law into the Straits Settlements. The present understanding of this clause is that it made all English statutes and principles of English [[common law]] and equity in force as at 27 November 1826 applicable in the Straits Settlements (including Singapore), unless they were both unsuitable to local conditions and could not be modified to avoid causing injustice or oppression.<ref>{{cite book|last=Phang|first=Andrew Boon Leong||title=From Foundation to Legacy : The Second Charter of Justice|publisher=Singapore Academy of Law|date=2006|location=Singapore|id=ISBN 981-05-7194-1}} at pp. 19–23.</ref>

The Charter provided that the Court of Judicature was to be presided over by the [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth|Governor]] of the Straits Settlements and [[Resident Councillor]] of the settlement where the court was to be held, and another judge called the [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]]. Problems occurred with the first Recorder, Sir [[John Thomas Claridge]]. He complained that the Governor and Resident Councillors had refused to take any judicial business, and so responded by also refusing to take on the full business of the Court. He also bemoaned the lack of a "full, efficient and respectable court establishment of clerks, interpreters. etc." Although expected to travel from his base at Prince of Wales' Island to Singapore and Malacca, due to disputes over travelling expenses and arrangements, Claridge refused to do so. Thus, on [[22 May]] [[1828]] the Governor [[Robert Fullerton]], together with the Resident Councillor [[Kenneth Murchison, Resident Counsellor of Singapore|Kenneth Murchison]], were obliged to hold the first [[assizes]] in Singapore by themselves. Claridge was eventually recalled to the U.K. in [[1829]].<ref>Chionh, ''op. cit.'' at pp. 99–100.</ref>

[[Image:18261127-SecondCharterofJustice-titlepg.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The title page of the Second Charter of Justice of 27 November 1826, from the edition published in London by J.L. Cox in February 1827. This copy of the Charter was originally owned by the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements, and a photocopy of it is presently in the collection of the Library of the Supreme Court of Singapore.]]

The Charter conferred no legislative power on the Governor and Council of Prince of Wales' Island or, indeed, on any other individual or institution.<ref>Bartholomew, ''op. cit.'' at p. xxxiii.</ref> The general power to make laws was vested with the Supreme Government of India and the British Parliament.<ref>Lee, ''op. cit.'' at p. 11.</ref> By the [[East India Company Act 1813]] (also known as the [[British East India Company#Charter Act 1813|Charter Act 1813]]) ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1801-1819#53 Geo. III 2|53 Geo. III c. 155]]) (U.K.), Prince of Wales' Island itself had been conferred an extremely limited power to issue regulations relating to duties and taxes it was empowered to levy; pursuant to this power, it issued nine regulations that applied to the Straits Settlements.<ref>Bartholomew, ''op. cit.'' at p. xxxiv.</ref> However, on [[20 June]] [[1830]] the East India Company reduced the status of Prince of Wales' Island from a Presidency to a Residency.<ref>''Id.'' at p. xxxv.</ref> The island thus lost power to legislate for the Straits Settlements, which power was assumed by the [[Governor General of India|Governor General of Bengal]]. He issued four such regulations applicable to the Straits Settlements.<ref>''Id.'' at p. xxxvii.</ref>

Upon the downgrading of the Straits Settlements, the offices of Governor and Resident Councillors were abolished. This led Governor Fullerton to conclude that neither he nor the Resident Councillors were empowered any longer to administer justice under the Second Charter. In late [[1830]], Fullerton closed the courts and dismissed the judicial establishment before leaving for England. This led to legal chaos. Members of the mercantile community were in an uproar as they felt the ensuing confusion and inconvenience of having no local courts would disrupt commercial activity. In Singapore the Deputy Resident Murchison felt compelled to convene a court. However, the Acting [[Registrar#Court|Registrar]] [[James Loch, Acting Registrar of Singapore|James Loch]]<ref>It is not known whether this is the same person as the [[James Loch]] who is the subject of a separate Wikipedia article.</ref> took the view that the court was illegal, and it was soon closed again. In [[September 1831]] merchants of the Straits Settlements appealed to the British Parliament. By then, the East India Company had already decided that Fullerton had been mistaken. It decided to restore the titles of Governor and Resident Councillor so that these officers could continue to administer justice pursuant to the Charter. On [[9 June]] [[1832]] the Court of Judicature reopened at Prince of Wales' Island, and disposed of many outstanding cases that had amassed during the two years when the courts were closed.<ref>Chionh, ''op. cit.'' at pp. 100–101.</ref>

In [[1833]], the [[Government of India Act 1833]] (also known as the [[British East India Company#Charter Act 1833|Charter Act 1833]]) ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1820-1839#1833 (3 & 4 Will. IV)|3 & 4 Will. IV, c. 85]]) (U.K.) was passed by the British Parliament for the better government of the East India Company's possessions. Sole legislative power was transferred to the [[Governor General of India#Council|Governor General of India in Council]], thus inaugurating the period of Straits Settlements history known as the period of the 'Indian Acts'.<ref>Bartholomew, ''op. cit.'' at p. xxxix.</ref>

The Court of Judicature was reorganized by the [[Third Charter of Justice]] of [[12 August]] [[1855]]. The Straits Settlements now had two Recorders, one for Prince of Wales' Island, the other for Singapore and Malacca.<ref>Chionh, ''op. cit.'' at p. 103.</ref>

In [[1858]] the East India Company was abolished, and territories formerly administered by the Company were transferred to the Crown acting through the recently-appointed [[Secretary of State for India]]. This was effected by the [[Government of India Act 1858]] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1840-1859#1858 (21 & 22 Vict.)|21 & 22 Vic. c. 106]]) (U.K.). There was no change to the structure of the legal system – the Governor General of India continued to legislate for the Straits Settlements.<ref>Bartholomew, ''op. cit.'' at p. xlvi.</ref>

Unfortunately, many Acts passed by the Governor General during this period were not relevant to the Straits Settlements, and it was difficult to determine which were applicable. The situation was remedied by the passing of the Statute Law Revision Ordinance 1889 (No. 8 of 1889) (Ind.), which appointed commissioners to enquire into the matter and empowered them to publish a volume containing the text of any Indian Acts regarded as being in force. Any Acts not included ceased to be applicable forthwith.<ref>''Id.'' at p. xl.</ref>

===1867–1942: The Straits Settlements as a Crown colony===

With effect from [[1 April]] [[1867]], the Straits Settlements were detached from India and constituted as a separate [[British overseas territories|Crown colony]] by way of the [[Straits Settlements Act 1866]] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1860-1879#1866 (29 & 30 Vict.)|29 & 30 Vic. c. 115]]) (U.K.).<ref>''Id.'' at p. xlvi.</ref> A separate [[Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements|Legislative Council]] with the authority to make laws was set up for the Straits Settlements. Pieces of legislation passed by the Legislative Council were known as '[[ordinance]]s'.<ref>''Id.'' at p. xlvii.</ref>

By the Supreme Court Ordinance 1868 (S.S.),<ref>Ordinance No. 5 of 1868 (S.S.).</ref> the Court of Judicature of the Straits Settlements was abolished, and in its place the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements was established. The Governor<ref>By the Judicial Duties Act (No. 3 of 1867) (S.S.).</ref> and Resident Councillors<ref>By the Supreme Court Ordinance 1868 (No. 5 of 1868) (S.S.).</ref> ceased to be judges of the Court.

In [[1873]], the Supreme Court was reconstituted to consist of the [[Chief Justice]] and the Judge at Penang as well as a Senior and a Junior [[Puisne Judge]]. There were two divisions of the court, one at Singapore and Malacca and the other at Penang. As Singapore had become the Straits Settlements' centre of government and trade, the Chief Justice and Senior Puisne Judge were required to reside in Singapore, while the Judge of Penang and the Junior Puisne Judge resided in Penang. The Supreme Court was also conferred with jurisdiction to sit as a [[Court of Appeals|Court of Appeal]] in [[Civil law (common law)|civil matters]]. Following changes in the court structure in England, in [[1878]] the jurisdiction and residence of judges was made more flexible, thus impliedly abolishing the geographical division of the Supreme Court.<ref>Lee, ''op. cit.'' at p. 18.</ref> The first hierarchy of courts was also established, consisting of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements, Courts of Request, Courts of Two Magistrates, Magistrates' Courts, Coroners' Courts and Justices of the Peace. Appeals from decisions of the Supreme Court lay in the first instance to the Court of Appeal, and then to Her Majesty in Council, the latter appeals being heard by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Judicial Committee of Her Britannic Majesty's Privy Council]].<ref>The 1878 reforms were effected by the Courts Ordinance 1878 (No. 3 of 1878) (S.S.).</ref>

Also in 1878, a provision later known as [[Civil Law Act, section 5|section 5 of the Civil Law Act]] (S'pore)<ref>Cap. 43, 1985 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> was introduced into Straits Settlements law.<ref>By the Civil Law Ordinance 1878 (No. 4 of 1878) (S.S.).</ref> The provision stated that if a question or issue arose locally with respect to certain named categories of law or with respect to [[Law merchant|mercantile law]] generally, the law to be administered was to be the same as that administered in England at the corresponding period, unless other provision had been made by any law having force locally. It was felt the provision was needed because the Straits Settlements Supreme Court had a tendency to follow English case law premised on the existence of statutes that were not in force in the Colony. There was also a general sentiment that the common law should be common to the whole Empire.<ref>Walter Woon, "The Continuing Reception of English Commercial Law" in Woon, ''The Singapore Legal System'', ''op. cit.'', p. 139 at pp. 139–141.</ref> However, the manner in which section 5 was worded created much difficulty in determining whether particular English statutes applied locally.<ref>See, generally, Woon, ''id.'' at pp. 142–153; and {{cite book|last=Phang|first=Andrew Boon Leong||title=From Foundation to Legacy : The Second Charter of Justice|publisher=Singapore Academy of Law|date=2006|location=Singapore|id=ISBN 981-05-7194-1}} at pp. 27–35.</ref> Despite major amendments to the provision in [[1979]],<ref>By the Civil Law (Amendment No. 2) Act 1979 (No. 24 of 1979) (S'pore).</ref> the problems with it were not resolved until it was finally repealed in 1993 ([[Law of Singapore#1965 to the present: Singapore as a fully-independent nation|see below]]).

Under the Courts Ordinance Amendment 1885 (S.S.),<ref>Ordinance No. 15 of 1885 (S.S.)</ref> the set-up of the Supreme Court was again altered so that it now consisted of the Chief Justice and three puisne judges.<ref>Chionh, ''op. cit.'' at pp. 104–106.</ref> In [[1907]] the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was given a major overhaul.<ref>By the Courts Ordinance 1907 (No. 30 of 1907) (S.S.).</ref> The Court was split into two divisions – a Civil Division and a Criminal Division, each with both [[original jurisdiction|original]] and [[appellate jurisdiction]]. District Courts and Police Courts, which replaced the Magistrates' Courts, were also established. The Court of Requests, the jurisdiction of which had been drastically reduced in the intervening years, was abolished.<ref>Chionh, ''op. cit.'' at pp. 106–107.</ref> The last major changes in the court system before World War II took place in [[1934]] when a Court of Criminal Appeal, essentially an extension of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, was created,<ref>By way of the Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance 1931 (No. 5 of 1931) (S.S.): Lee, ''op. cit.'' at p. 19.</ref> and in [[1936]] when it was declared that the Supreme Court would consist of a High Court and Court of Appeal.<ref>By the Courts Ordinance (Cap. 10, 1936 Rev. Ed.) (S.S.).</ref>

===1942–1946: Singapore under Japanese and British Military Administration===

[[Image:BritishSurrender.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Gen. [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] (seated, left of centre) of the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] thumps the table with his fist to emphasize his terms – unconditional surrender of Singapore. Lt.-Gen. [[Arthur Ernest Percival|Arthur Percival]], General Officer Commanding (Malaya) of the [[British Army]] (right, back to camera) sits between his officers, his clenched hand to his mouth.]]

During [[World War II]], Singapore fell under [[Japanese Military Administration]] on [[15 February]] [[1942]]. There is much confusion as to where legislative authority lay, as there were several government or military bodies which had the power to make laws. These were, in order of descending authority, the Supreme Command of the Southern Army Headquarters, the 25th Army Headquarters, the Military Administration Department, the Malay (Malayan) Military Administration Headquarters, and the City Government of Tokubetu-si. Numerous regulations, laws and notices were issued by all these bodies through the Tokubetu-si without adhering to the normal chain of command. Although these laws were often contradictory, the body higher in the hierarchy always prevailed.

When the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] began, all existing courts ceased to function. By a decree of [[7 April]] [[1942]], a Military Court of Justice of the Nippon Army was established, and the civil courts were reopened by a proclamation dated [[27 May]]. This Proclamation made all former British laws applicable so long as they did not interfere with the Military Administration. The highest court was the Syonan Koto-Hoin (Syonan Supreme Court) which was opened on [[29 May]]. Although a court of appeal was constituted, it never sat.<ref>''Id.'' at p. 20.</ref>

There is some disagreement as to the status of judgments handed down by courts during the Japanese Occupation. The view has been taken by some post-Occupation courts that decisions by Japanese tribunals applying the law were valid. Others have held that since the Japanese administration did not set up tribunals in compliance with the requirements of Straits Settlements law, while the law continued to apply there were no proper courts in existence to enforce it.<ref>Bartholomew, ''op. cit.'' at pp. lxviii–lxix.</ref>

The Japanese surrendered on [[12 September]] [[1945]]. By Proclamation No. 1 (1945), the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] [[South East Asia Command|South East Asia]] established the [[British Military Administration]] which assumed full judicial, legislative, executive and administrative powers and responsibilities and conclusive jurisdiction over all persons and property throughout such areas of Malaya as were at any given time under the control of forces under his command.<ref>''Id.'' at p. lxix.</ref> The Proclamation also declared that all laws and customs existing immediately prior to the Japanese Occupation would be respected, except that such of the existing law as the Chief Civil Affairs Officer considered practicable to administer during the period of military administration. Otherwise, all proclamations and legislative enactments of whatever kind issued by or under the authority of the Japanese Military Administration ceased to have effect.<ref>''Id.'' at p. lxx.</ref>

By Proclamation No. 23 (1945), the Deputy Chief Civil Affairs Officer for the Singapore Division provided that every conviction of any offence by a tribunal establshed by the Japanese Military Administration was quashed, and any judgment convicting or purporting to convict any person or any offence was set aside.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> Civil proceedings were dealt with by the [[Japanese Judgments and Civil Proceedings Ordinance 1946]] (No. 3 of 1946) (S'pore), which had the effect of permitting post-Occupation courts to review the decrees of Japanese tribunals and to confirm, modify or reverse them.<ref>''Id.'' at p. lxxi.</ref>

===1946–1963: The end of the Straits Settlements: Singapore as a separate colony and self-governing state===

The British Military Administration was terminated by Proclamation No. 77 (1946) dated [[18 March]] [[1946]], and with effect from [[1 April]] the Straits Settlements were disbanded by the [[Straits Settlements (Repeal) Act 1946]] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1940-1959#9 & 10 Geo. VI 2|9 & 10 Geo. VI c. 37]]) (U.K.). By the [[Singapore Colony Order in Council 1946]] (S.R. & O. 1946 No. 464) (U.K.), Singapore was constituted as a new colony under the [[British Settlements Acts 1887]] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1880-1899#1887 (50 & 51 Vict)|50 & 51 Vic. c. 54]]) (U.K.). A Singapore Legislative Council was created with power to legislate for the peace, order and good government of the Colony.<ref>''Id.'' at pp. lxxxi–lxxxii.</ref> The High Court and Court of Appeal of the Straits Settlements became the Colony of Singapore High Court and Court of Appeal.

In [[1958]] Singapore was granted internal self-government and became the State of Singapore. This change was put into place by the [[Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council 1958]] ([[List of Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom, 1958|S.I. 1958 No. 1946]]) (U.K.) made under powers conferred by the [[State of Singapore Act 1958]] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1940-1959#6 & 7 Eliz. II 2|6 & 7 Eliz. II c. 59]]) (U.K.).<ref>''Id.'' at p. lxxiv.</ref> The Legislative Council was transformed into a Legislative Assembly consisting mainly of elected members.

During this period, the basic structure of the courts remained much as it had been in the pre-war colonial era, with only minor changes being made such as the redesignation of the Police Courts as Magistrates' Courts in [[1955]].<ref>By way of the Courts Ordinance 1955 (No. 14 of 1955, later Cap. 3, 1955 Rev. Ed.) (S'pore): Chionh, ''op. cit.'' at p. 113.</ref>

[[Image:Mmsia1.jpg|A national ceremony celebrates the formation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963.|right|thumb|200px]]

===1963–1965: Independence from the British Empire and merger with Malaysia===

Singapore joined the [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]] on [[16 September]] [[1963]], and thus ceased to be a colony of the British empire. The legal arrangements were effected by the enactment of the [[Malaysia Act 1963]] ([[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1960-1979#Public Acts 7|c. 35]]) (U.K.), the [[Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore (State Constitutions) Order in Council 1963]] ([[List of Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom, 1963|S.I. 1963 No. 1493]]) (U.K.) and the [[Malaysia Act 1963, Malaysia|Malaysia Act 1963]] (No. 26 of 1963) (M'sia).<ref>Bartholomew, ''op. cit.'' at p. lxxvi.</ref> The 1963 Order in Council provided that all laws in force in Singapore continued to apply subject to modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions that might be necessary to bring them into conformity with its new Constitution and the Malaysia Act.<ref>''Id.'' at p. lxxvii.</ref> With Singapore now a state in a larger federation, the Singapore Legislative Assembly was transformed into the Legislature of Singapore with power to make laws only regarding certain matters set out in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Malaysian Federal Constitution]]. Article 75 of the Federal Constitution also stated: "If any state law is inconsistent with a federal law, the federal law shall prevail and the state law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void."

During this period, a substantial number of Malaysian laws, including [[Federated Malay States]] Enactments and [[Malayan Union]] and [[Federation of Malaya]] Ordinances, were extended to Singapore. Some of these statutes continue to apply, often in modified form, in Singapore today.<ref>''Id.'' at p. lxxix.</ref>

Under the Malaysia Act 1963, the judicial power of Malaysia was vested in a [[Courts of Malaysia#Federal Court|Federal Court]], a [[Courts of Malaysia#High Courts|High Court]] in Malaya, a High Court in Borneo and a High Court in Singapore. This new structure was formalized with effect from [[16 March]] [[1964]] through the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (M'sia),<ref>No. 7 of 1964 (M'sia), reprinted as Act No. 6 of 1966 (S'pore) in the ''Singapore Reprints Supplement (Acts)''.</ref> which replaced the Supreme Court of the Colony of Singapore with the High Court of Malaysia in Singapore.<ref>Lee, ''op. cit.'' at p. 30.</ref> The jurisdiction of the High Court in Singapore was limited to all territory in the State of Singapore.<ref>Chionh, ''op. cit.'' at p. 113.</ref>

===1965 to the present: Singapore as a fully-independent nation===

[[Image:Singapore_Parliament_House.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Parliament House, Singapore]], which was officially opened on 4 October 1999.]]

Merger with Malaysia did not last: within two years, on [[9 August]] [[1965]], Singapore left the Federation and became a fully-independent [[republic]]. This was effected by the signing of the [[Independence of Singapore Agreement]] of [[7 August]] [[1965]] by Singapore and Malaysia, and the changes consequent to the Agreement were implemented by two Malaysian Acts, the [[Constitution and Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Act 1965]] (No. 31 of 1965) (M'sia) and the [[Constitution (Amendment) Act 1966]] (No. 59 of 1966) (M'sia); and by two Singapore Acts, the [[Constitution (Amendment) Act 1965]] (No. 8 of 1965) (S'pore) and the [[Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965]] (No. 9 of 1965) (S'pore). Section 5 of the latter Act provided that the legislative powers of the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], the supreme ruler of Malaysia, ceased to extend to Singapore, and vested instead in the [[President of Singapore|Head of Singapore]] and the Legislature of Singapore. Again, all laws were expressed to continue in force with such modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as might be necessary to bring them into conformity with the independent status of Singapore upon separation from Malaysia.<ref>Bartholomew, ''op. cit.'' at pp. lxxix–lxxx.</ref> Today, the [[Parliament of Singapore]] is an organ of state with [[plenary power]] to enact legislation for Singapore.

At the time of independence, the Singapore Parliament did not make any changes to the judicial system. Thus, for an anomalous four-year period, the High Court in Singapore remained part of the Malaysian court structure. This was remedied in [[1969]]. The Constitution was also amended to reconstitute the Privy Council as Singapore's court of final appeal,<ref>By the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1969 (No. 19 of 1969) (S'pore): Lee, ''op. cit.'' at pp. 30 and 32.</ref> and the highest appellate court within Singapore was organized into two divisions, the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal, which respectively dealt with civil and criminal matters.<ref>Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (No. 24 of 1969) (S'pore), now Cap. 322, 1999 Rev. Ed., available from [http://statutes.agc.gov.sg Singapore Statutes Online].</ref>

[[Image:Supreme Court Building, Aug 06.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Supreme Court, Singapore|Supreme Court Building]], designed by Foster & Partners, which commenced operations on 20 June 2005, as it appeared in August 2006.]]

In [[1970]] the [[subordinate courts]] were reorganized.<ref>By the Subordinate Courts Act 1970 (No. 19 of 1970) (S'pore), now Cap. 321, 1999 Rev. Ed., available from [http://statutes.agc.gov.sg Singapore Statutes Online].</ref> Since that time,
the Subordinate Courts of Singapore have consisted of the District Courts, the Magistrates' Courts, the Juvenile Courts and the Coroners' Courts.<ref>Chionh, ''op. cit.'' at pp. 114–115.</ref>

Steps to restrict appeals to the Privy Council were first taken in [[1989]]. In that year, the law was changed<ref>By the Judicial Committee (Amendment) Act 1989 (No. 21 of 1989) (S'pore).</ref> such that appeals to the Privy Council would only be permitted in a civil case if all the parties agreed to such an appeal prior to the hearing of the case by the Court of Appeal. In criminal cases, an appeal to the Privy Council could only be taken if the death penalty was involved and if the judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal were not unanimous in their decision. In [[1993]], the previous set-up of a separate Court of Appeal and Court of Criminal Appeal was done away with, and in their place a unified Court of Appeal was constituted for both civil and criminal appeals.<ref>By the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act 1993 (No. 16 of 1993) (S'pore).</ref> Judges of Appeal appointed to the Court of Appeal were no longer required to engage in High Court work. The Chief Justice sat as the President of the Court of Appeal. The establishment of the permanent Court of Appeal paved the way for the abolition of all appeals to the Privy Council with effect from [[8 April]] [[1994]].<ref>The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1994 (No. 5 of 1994) repealed Art. 100 of the Constitution, which had provided that the President could make arrangements with Her Majesty for reference to the Privy Council of appeals from the Supreme Court. The Judicial Committee Act 1966 (No. 37 of 1966, later Cap. 148, 1985 Rev. Ed.), which regulated the procedure for such appeals, was repealed by the Judicial Committee (Repeal) Act 1994 (No. 2 of 1994) (S'pore).</ref> Following this, the Court of Appeal issued a Practice Statement dated [[11 July]] [[1994]], stating that while the Court would treat its own prior decisions and those of the Privy Council as normally binding, where it appeared that adherence to such decisions "would cause injustice in a particular case or constrain the development of the law in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore" it would regard itself as free to depart from such decisions. It added that this power would be exercised sparingly, bearing in mind the danger of retrospectively disturbing contractual, proprietary and other legal rights.<ref>Chionh, ''op. cit.'' at pp. 116–117.</ref> Today the [[Judicial system of Singapore|Singapore Court of Appeal]] is the highest court in the land.

The independent status of Singapore's legal system was underlined by the repeal of [[Civil Law Act, section 5|section 5 of the Civil Law Act]] ([[Law of Singapore#1867–1942: The Straits Settlements as a Crown colony|see above]]) on [[12 November]] [[1993]] by the [[Application of English Law Act 1993]] (S'pore).<ref>No. 35 of 1993, now Cap. 7A, 1994 Rev. Ed. (S'pore), available from [http://statutes.agc.gov.sg Singapore Statutes Online].</ref> The Act aims to clarify the extent of the application of English law in Singapore. It states that the common law of England (including the principles and rules of equity), so far as it was part of the law of Singapore immediately before the commencement of the Act, continues to be part of Singapore law so far as it is applicable to the circumstances of Singapore and its inhabitants and subject to such modifications as those circumstances may require.<ref>''Id.'', s. 3.</ref> As for English statutes, only those that are listed in the Schedules to the Act apply or continue to apply in Singapore; no other English enactment is part of Singapore law.<ref>''Id.'', ss. 4 and 5. See, generally, Phang, ''op. cit.'' at pp. 37–49.</ref>

==Sources of law==

There are generally regarded to be three sources of law in Singapore: [[legislation]], [[Precedent|judicial precedents]] ([[case law]]) and [[custom (law)|custom]].<ref>See, generally, {{cite book|last=Chan|first=Helena H.M. (Hui-meng)|title=The Legal System of Singapore|publisher=Butterworths Asia|date=1995|location=Singapore|id=ISBN 0-409-99789-7 (pbk.)}}, ch. 6, pp. 105–112.</ref>

===Legislation===
Legislation, or [[statutory law]], can be divided into statutes and subsidiary legislation.

====Statutes====
[[Image:Statutes-Singapore.jpg|thumb|250px|''Statutes of the Republic of Singapore'', a series that consists of all Acts of the Singapore Parliament and English statutes that are currently in force in Singapore.]]

[[Statute]]s are written laws enacted by the Singapore Parliament, as well as by other bodies such as the British Parliament, Governor-General of India in Council and Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements which had power to pass laws for Singapore in the past. Statutes enacted by these other bodies may still be in force if they have not been [[Repeal|repealed]]. One particularly important statute is the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution of the Republic of Singapore]],<ref>The current version is the 1999 Reprint.</ref> which is the supreme law of Singapore – any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of the Constitution which is inconsistent with it is, to the extent of the inconsistency, void.<ref>''Id.'', Art. 4.</ref> Statutes of the Singapore Parliament, as well as English statutes in force in Singapore by virtue of the [[Application of English Law Act 1993]] (S'pore)<ref>Cap. 7A, 1994 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> ([[Law of Singapore#1965 to the present: Singapore as a fully-independent nation|see above]]), are published in looseleaf form in a series called the ''Statutes of the Republic of Singapore'' which is gathered in red binders, and are also accessible on-line from [http://statutes.agc.gov.sg Singapore Statutes Online], a free service provided by the [[Attorney-General's Chambers of Singapore]].

Most statutes, apart from amending Acts and certain Acts such as [[Supply Acts]], are assigned chapter numbers (the word 'chapter' is usually abbreviated 'Cap.'). Revised editions (abbreviated 'Rev. Ed.') of statutes that consolidate all amendments to statutes within certain periods of time are published regularly.

A statute of the Singapore Parliament begins its life as a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], which is usually introduced in Parliament by a [[Minister (government)|government minister]].<ref>Bills may also be introduced by private [[Member of Parliament#Singapore|Members of Parliament]], although this rarely occurs.</ref> In practice, most legislation is initiated by the [[Cabinet#Westminster cabinets|Cabinet]], either acting on its own or on the advice of senior [[Civil service|civil servants]]. Bills go through the following stages in Parliament:

#The introduction and [[Reading (legislature)#First reading|first reading]].
#The [[Reading (legislature)#Second reading|second reading]].
#The committee stage.
#The [[Reading (legislature)#Third reading|third reading]].

At the first reading, the bill is introduced into Parliament, usually by the responsible minister. No debate on the bill takes place. The bill is then printed and circulated among [[Member of Parliament#Singapore|Members of Parliament]] (MPs). On the second reading, the minister responsible for moving the bill usually makes a speech explaining the objects and reasons behind the bill. The general merits and principles of the bill are then debated.

The bill then proceeds to the committee stage, where the details of the drafting of the proposed law are examined. Where a bill is relatively uncontroversial, it is referred to a [[Committee of the Whole|committee of the whole Parliament]]; in other words, the whole Parliament resolves itself into a committee and discusses the bill clause by clause. Bills which are more controversial, or for which it is desired to obtain the views of interested groups or the public, are often referred to a [[Select Committee (United Kingdom)|select committee]]. This is a committee made up of certain MPs, who then invite interested persons to make representations to the committee. Public hearings to hear submissions on the bill may be held. The select committee then reports its findings, together with any suggested amendments to the bill, to Parliament.

The bill then goes through a third reading. At this stage, only amendments which are not of a material character may be made to the bill. The minister moving the third reading may also make a speech outlining the changes made to the bill. The bill is then put to the vote. In most cases, a [[simple majority]] of Parliament is all that is needed for the bill to be approved. However, bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a [[special majority]]: not less than two-thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings.<ref>Singapore Constitution, Art. 5(2).</ref>

Once a bill has been passed by Parliament, it must be submitted to a non-elected advisory body called the [[Presidential Council for Minority Rights]] (PCMR). The PCMR's responsibility is to draw attention to any legislation which, in its opinion, is a "differentiating measure", that is, one which discriminates against any racial or religious community. When the Council makes a favourable report or no report within the time prescribed (in which case the bill is conclusively presumed not to contain any differentiating measures), the bill is presented to the President for assent.

If the PCMR submits an adverse report, Parliament can either make amendments to the bill and resubmit it to the Council for approval, or decide to present the bill for the President's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two-thirds of all MPs. The PCMR has not rendered any adverse reports since it was set up in [[1970]].

Upon receiving presidential assent, a bill becomes law and is known as an [[Act of Parliament]]. However, the Act only comes into force on the date of its publication in the ''[[Government Gazette]]'', or on such other date that is stipulated by the Act or another law, or a notification made under a law.<ref>Chan, ''op. cit.'' at pp. 36–39, 107.</ref>

====Subsidiary legislation====
[[Image:SubsidiaryLegislation-Singapore.jpg|thumb|200px|The series ''Subsidiary Legislation of the Republic of Singapore'' is a compilation of all subsidiary legislation currently in force in Singapore.]]

[[Delegated legislation|Subsidiary legislation]], also known as 'delegated legislation' or 'subordinate legislation', is written law made by ministers or other administrative agencies such as government departments and [[Statutory boards of the Singapore Government|statutory boards]] under the authority of a statute (often called its 'parent Act') or other lawful authority, and not directly by Parliament. Although there is no general requirement (as there is in the United Kingdom) for subsidiary legislation to be laid before Parliament for its information, this is usually done in Singapore.<ref>{{cite book|title=Halsbury's Laws of Singapore|publisher=Butterworths Asia|date=1999|location=Singapore|id=ISBN 981-236-000-X (set)}}, vol. 1 at para. [10.020].</ref>

Subsidiary legislation is known by a variety of names. Section 2(1) of the Interpretation Act (S'pore)<ref>Cap. 1, 1999 Rev. Ed. (S'pore), available on-line from [http://statutes.agc.gov.sg Singapore Statutes Online].</ref> defines "subsidiary legislation" as meaning "any order in council, proclamation, rule, regulation, order, notification, by-law or other instrument made under any Act, Ordinance or other lawful authority and having legislative effect".

*An ''[[Order-in-Council|order-in-council]]'' is a law made directly by the British Crown in the exercise of its [[Royal Prerogative|prerogative]] law-making power which it previously possessed in respect of Singapore. Orders-in-council are made only on the advice of ministers, and operate subject to provisions made by or under any Act of Parliament.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bennion|first=F.A.R.|title=Statutory Interpretation : A Code (4th ed.)|publisher=Butterworths|date=2002|location=London|id=ISBN 0-406-94305-2}}, s. 48 on p. 193.</ref>
*A ''[[proclamation]]'' is an announcement made by or under the authority of the Crown.<ref>''Id.'' at s. 66 on p. 223.</ref>
*''Rules'' are generally legal instruments such as Rules of Court which regulate judicial or other procedure.<ref>''Id.'' at s. 64 on p. 220.</ref>
*''[[Regulation]]s'' are legal instruments implementing the substantive content of Acts of Parliament that have a continuing regulating effect.<ref>''Id.'' at s. 63 on p. 220.</ref>
*An ''order'' is a legal instrument which has an executive flavour and expresses an obvious command. Often, its effect is limited to a particular moment in time, rather than continuing.<ref>''Id.'' at s. 62 on p. 219.</ref>
*A ''notification'' is a legal instrument that provides factual information. For example, notifications are used to inform the public of the dates of commencement of statutes and the appointment of individuals to government posts.
*''[[Bylaw|By-laws]]'' are regulations made by certain public and private bodies, for instance, [[strata title]] management corporations. Their extent is usually limited to a relatively small geographical area or to the operations of a particular body only.<ref>''Id.'' at s. 65 on p. 221.</ref>

Subsidiary legislation must, unless otherwise expressly provided in any statute, be published in the ''Government Gazette'' and, unless expressly provided in the subsidiary legislation itself, takes effect and comes into operation on the date of its publication.<ref>Interpretation Act, ''op. cit.'', s. 23.</ref>

No subsidiary legislation made under an Act of Parliament may be inconsistent with the provisions of any Act.<ref>''Id.'', s. 19(c).</ref> This means that any subsidiary legislation which was made ''[[ultra vires]]'' its parent Act (that is, the Act did not confer power on the agency to make the subsidiary legislation) or is not consistent with any other statute is void to the extent of the inconsistency.<ref>''Halsbury's Laws of Singapore'', vol. 1, ''op. cit.'' at para. [10.018].</ref>

Subsidiary legislation currently in force in Singapore is published in looseleaf form in a series called the ''Subsidiary Legislation of the Republic of Singapore'' which is gathered in black binders. New subsidiary legislation published in the ''Gazette'' may be viewed for free on-line for five days on the [http://www.egazette.com.sg/current.php Electronic Gazette] website.

=====Examples of subsidiary legislation=====
*Under regulation 16 of the '''Environmental Public Health (Public Cleansing) Regulations'''<ref>Cap. 95, Rg. 3, 2000 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> made under the Environmental Public Health Act,<ref>Cap. 95, 2002 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> any person who has urinated or defecated in any sanitary convenience with a flushing system to which the public has access shall flush the sanitary convenience immediately after using it. Contravention of this regulation is an offence punishable:
::(a) for a first offence, to a fine not exceeding $1,000 and to a further fine not exceeding $100 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction;
::(b) for a second offence, to a fine not exceeding $2,000 and to a further fine not exceeding $200 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction; and
::(c) for a third or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding $5,000 and to a further fine not exceeding $500 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction.<ref>Environmental Public Health (Public Cleansing) Regulations, ''op. cit.'', reg. 30.</ref>
*The '''Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules'''<ref>Cap. 184, R. 1, 2000 Rev. Ed. (S'pore)</ref> made under the Miscellanous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act<ref>Cap. 184, 1997 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> require a permit to be taken out for any public assembly or procession of five or more persons in any public place. The rationale given for this law is that a large group of people who gather for a peaceful purpose can turn violent. In the 1950s and 1960s there several violent riots in Singapore, the last incident being the [[1964 Race Riots]] in which 36 people were killed. Although there have only been a few minor protests since then, the authorities continue to take a tough stance against unlicensed outdoor protests. On [[31 December]] [[2000]], 15 members of [[Falun Gong]] consisting of 13 foreigners and two Singaporeans were arrested at [[MacRitchie Park]] for holding an illegal assembly.
*Public speaking at [[Speakers' Corner#Singapore|Speakers' Corner]] is regulated by the '''Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order'''<ref>Cap. 257, O. 3, 2002 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> made under the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act.<ref>Cap. 257, 2001 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref>
*Under regulation 14 of the '''Rapid Transit Systems Regulations'''<ref>Cap. 263A, 1997 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> made under the Rapid Transit Systems Act,<ref>Cap. 263A, 2004 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> it is an offence to consume or attempt to consume any food or drinks while in or upon any part of the railway premises except in such places as are designated for this purpose by the [[Land Transport Authority]] or its licensee, or consume or attempt to consume any chewing gum or bubble gum while in or upon any part of the railway premises. Regulation 15 makes it an offence to spit, litter or soil any part of the railway premises. The maximum penalties for these offences are fines of up to $500 and $5,000 respectively.<ref>''Id.'', reg. 52 read with the Schedule.</ref>
*The '''Sale of Food (Prohibition of Chewing Gum) Regulations'''<ref>Cap. 283, Rg. 2, 2004 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> made under the Sale of Food Act<ref>Cap. 283, 2002 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> prohibits the sale or advertisement for sale of any [[Chewing gum ban in Singapore|chewing gum]].<ref>Sale of Food (Prohibition of Chewing Gum) Regulations, ''op. cit.'', reg. 2(1).</ref> The prohibition does not apply to the sale or advertisement of any chewing gum in respect of which a product licence has been granted under the Medicines Act.<ref>Cap. 176, 1985 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> Thus, it is now possible to purchase chewing gum for dental or medical purposes (for instance, for the purpose of [[nicotine replacement therapy]]) from pharmacies without a prescription.

[[Image:SLR-boundvols-case-looseissue.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The ''Singapore Law Reports'', first published by the Singapore Academy of Law in 1992, contain reports of significant judgments handed down by the High Court, Court of Appeal and Constitutional Tribunal of Singapore.]]

===Judicial precedents===
As Singapore is a [[English common law|common law]] [[jurisdiction]], judgments handed down by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and [[equity]] which have been laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly [[Contract|contract law]], equity and [[Trust law#United Kingdom|trust law]], [[property law]] and [[Tort|tort law]], are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.

Legal certainty and the orderly development of legal principles are promoted by the application of the doctrine of ''[[stare decisis]]'', also known as the doctrine of binding precedent. According to this doctrine, the decisions of higher courts are binding on lower courts. Thus, judgments of the Court of Appeal are binding on the High Court, and judgments of both of these superior courts are binding on subordinate courts. A judge is generally not bound by previous decisions made by other judges in courts of the same level; thus, a judge hearing a High Court case need not follow previous High Court decisions. Nonetheless, courts will generally do so as a matter of comity unless there are good reasons for doing otherwise. As the final appellate court in Singapore, the Court of Appeal is not bound by its previous decisions or those of predecessor courts such as the Privy Council. However, the Court continues to treat such decisions as "normally binding" and only departs from them "where adherence to such prior decisions would cause injustice in a particular case or constrain the development of the law in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore".<ref>Practice Statement dated [[11 July]] [[1994]].</ref> Only the ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' (that is, the legal principle that determines the outcome) of a case is binding according to the doctrine of ''stare decisis''; other legal principles expressed that are not crucial to the final decision (''[[obiter dicta]]'') are only [[Persuasive precedent|persuasive]].<ref>Chan, ''op. cit.'' at pp. 113–121.</ref>

As English courts do not form part of Singapore's hierarchy of courts, decisions of such courts are not binding on Singapore courts. However, as a result of Singapore's colonial heritage, English judicial precedents continue to exercise a strong influence on the legal system and are regarded as highly persuasive, particularly as regards the development of the common law, and the interpretation of English statutes applicable in Singapore and Singapore statutes modelled on English enactments. Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of Singapore law. For instance, Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of criminal law and procedure because Singapore borrowed heavily from India in these areas.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref>

The Constitution provides that the President may refer to a tribunal consisting of not less than three judges of the Supreme Court for its opinion any question as to the effect of any provision of the Constitution which has arisen or appears likely to arise.<ref>Singapore Constitution, ''op. cit.'', Art. 100(1).</ref> Where a Constitutional Tribunal has given an opinion, no court has jurisdiction to question the opinion, or the validity of any law the bill for which was the subject of a reference to the Tribunal.<ref>''Id.'', Art. 100(4).</ref>

During Straits Settlements times, cases pertaining to Singapore appeared in various privately-produced and official series of law reports such as ''[[Kyshe’s Reports]]'' (covering cases decided between 1808 and 1939), the ''[[Straits Law Journal]]'' (1839–1891) and the ''[[Straits Settlements Law Reports]]'' (1867–1942). From 1932 until 1992, Singapore cases appeared regularly in the ''[[Malayan Law Journal]]'' (MLJ), the only local series of law reports to be published continuously since the 1930s except during World War II. The MLJ is still consulted for Singapore cases decided prior to full independence in 1965. Since 1992, judgments of the High Court, Court of Appeal and Constitutional Tribunal of Singapore have appeared in the ''[[Singapore Law Reports]]'' (SLR), which is published by the [[Singapore Academy of Law]] under an exclusive licence from the [[Judicial system of Singapore|Supreme Court of Singapore]]. The Academy has also republished cases decided since Singapore's full independence in 1965 that appeared in the MLJ in special volumes of the SLR, and is currently working on a reissue of this body of case law. Cases published in the SLR as well as unreported judgments of the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts are available on-line from a fee-based service called [[LawNet]] [http://www.lawnet.com.sg], which is also managed by the Academy.

====Examples of judicial precedents====
*'''''[[Chng Suan Tze v. Minister of Home Affairs]]''''' (1988)<ref>[1988] S.L.R. 132, C.A. (S'pore).</ref> was a landmark Court of Appeal case in [[administrative law]], specifically with regards to reviewing the grounds of detention without trial under the [[Internal Security Act]].<ref>Cap. 143, 1985 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> One of the main issues before the court was whether the test for [[judicial review]] was objective or subjective; in other words, whether judges could examine whether the executive’s decision to detain a person was in fact based on national security considerations, as well as whether the executive’s considerations in determining the detention fell within the scope of the purposes specified in section 8(1) of the Act. The court, in an ''[[Obiter dictum|obiter]]'' ruling, advocated the objective standard, stating: "All power has legal limits and the rule of law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power."<ref>''Chng Suan Tze'', ''op. cit.'', at p. 156, para. 86.</ref> Although the case was legislatively overruled in respect of internal security matters by amendments to the [[Constitution of Singapore]] and the Internal Security Act, the principle still applies in judicial review proceedings not involving the Act.
*'''''Fay v. Public Prosecutor''''' (1994)<ref>[1994] 2 S.L.R. 154, H.C. (S'pore).</ref> concerned an American teenager, [[Michael P. Fay]], who was arrested in 1994 for vandalizing cars and stealing street signs. He pleaded guilty to two charges of vandalizing by spraying paint on a number of cars. On conviction by a subordinate court, he was sentenced to a total of four months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the [[Caning in Singapore|cane]]. For the purposes of sentencing, other charges were taken into consideration, including 16 charges of vandalism involving paint. Fay appealed to the High Court against the sentences, arguing that (a) proviso to section 3 of the Vandalism Act<ref>Cap. 341, 1985 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> required the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the indelible quality of the paint used before caning could be imposed; (b) a probation order was appropriate in this case; and (c) the trial judge below should have ordered a pre-sentencing report with a view to ordering probation. The appeal was dismissed. The case generated intense media interest in the United States, culminating in a formal request being made by the American government for the caning sentence not to be carried out. The request was rejected by the Singapore government on the basis that foreigners in Singapore could not be held to a different standard from citizens. However, a recommendation was made to the President to reduce the caning sentence from six strokes to four.

===Custom===
A [[Custom (law)|custom]] is an established practice or course of behaviour that is regarded by the persons engaged in the practice as law. Customs do not have the force of law unless they are recognized in a case. 'Legal' or 'trade' customs are not given recognition as law unless they are certain and not unreasonable or illegal.<ref>Chan, ''op. cit'', at p 122.</ref> In Singapore, custom is a minor source of law as not many customs have been given judicial recognition.

====Examples of custom====
*The general reception of English law under the [[Second Charter of Justice]] ([[Law of Singapore#1826–1867: The 'Indian period'|see above]]) was subject to three qualifications, one of which was that English law should be modified in its application to Singapore so as not to cause injustice or oppression to the indigenous people of the island. Regard was to be had to their religions, usages and manners. This principle was generally applied in family law and related matters; thus, in certain early cases English law was modified by Chinese, Malay and Hindu customary law, and some native usages or customs acquired the force of law. However, the enactment of the [[Women's Charter (Singapore)|Women's Charter]]<ref>Cap. 353, 1997 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> in [[1961]] has unified the family law for all ethno-religious groups in Singapore except the Muslims, who are separately regulated by the [[Administration of Muslim Law Act]].<ref>Cap. 3, 1985 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref>
*Where [[Malays in Singapore|Malay]] [[Muslim]]s are concerned, the application of Muslim law is modified by Malay custom as regards marriage, divorce and the distribution of the [[Estate (law)|estate]] of an [[Intestacy|intestate]] person. In fact, Muslim customary law and the Malay custom applicable to Malay Muslims appear to be the only strands of customary law which continue to have some significance in Singapore.
*The practice of marking cheques is a recognized banking custom in Singapore.<ref>Chan, ''op. cit.'', at pp. 121–122.</ref>

==Legal developments==
===June 2006===
*On [[18 April]] [[2005]], the government announced that it was relaxing its ban on [[casino]]s and would be allowing the development of two '[[integrated resort]]s' incorporating casinos, its aim being to boost the tourism industry. Both resorts are expected to open by 2009.{{fact}} Locals who wish to enter the casinos will be required to pay a daily entry fee of S$100 or purchase an annual entry pass for S$2,000. This measure is aimed at reducing the negative effects of [[compulsive gambling]]. The entry fees will be used to educate and counsel Singaporeans that have gambling habits. On [[1 June]] [[2006]] the Casino Control Act 2006<ref>No. 10 of 2006 (S'pore).</ref> came into force. Among other things, the Act establishes the [[Casino Regulatory Authority of Singapore]] and the [[National Council on Problem Gambling]]; and provides for the licensing of casinos and their employees, and the supervision and control of casino operators.

===September 2006===
*The [[Judicial system of Singapore|Subordinate Courts]] started a pilot project called the Lay Assistant Scheme in which persons, usually with some legal knowledge, attend hearings with litigants who are not represented by lawyers to advise them on non-legal issues and help them with administrative tasks. The scheme, a modification of the U.K.'s [[McKenzie Friend]] system, is intended to assist litigants who are not eligible for legal aid as they have an annual salary exceeding S$10,000 but cannot afford a lawyer. For the litigant to qualify, the other party must be legally represented. Lay assistants are not allowed to act as lawyers and may not address the court; any breach of court rules may render them liable to a maximum fine of S$1,000 or imprisonment of up to six months. Plans for introducing McKenzie Friends in court proceedings were first announced by [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Chan Sek Keong]] in [[May 2006]]. Students from the Pro Bono Group of the [[National University of Singapore#Law|Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore]], have been participating in the scheme.<ref>Ansley Ng, "[http://www.todayonline.com/articles/164112.asp Law Undergrads in Court's Pilot Scheme]", ''[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]'' ([[5 January]] [[2007]]).</ref>

===November 2006===
*The Ministry of Home Affairs held a public consultation between [[9 November]] and [[9 December]] [[2006]] on proposed changes to the Penal Code.<ref>Cap. 224, 1985 Rev. Ed. (S'pore): see Ministry of Home Affairs, "[http://www.reach.gov.sg/olcp/asp/ocp/ocp01d1.asp?id=3683 Consultation Paper on the Proposed Penal Code Amendments]" ([[8 November]] [[2006]]).</ref> Among the suggested changes are proposals to modify the marital immunity currently enjoyed by a husband against [[Spousal rape|raping]] his wife, and to decriminalize oral and anal sex by a consenting heterosexual couple aged 16 years and above.

===January 2007===
*In [[November 2006]], a 17-year-old man, Garyl Tan Jia Luo, was arrested for [[piggybacking|tapping]] into his neighbour's wireless Internet connection;<ref>"[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/11/asia/AS_GEN_Singapore_Internet_Charges.php Report: Singapore Teen Faces 3 Years' Jail for Tapping into Another's Wireless Internet]", ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' ([[10 November]] [[2006]]).</ref> he faced up to three years' imprisonment and a fine under the Computer Misuse Act.<ref>Cap. 50A, 1998 Rev. Ed. (S'pore).</ref> On [[19 December]], Tan pleaded guilty to the charge,<ref>Chua Hian Hou, "Wi-Fi Thief Pleads Guilty: 17-Year-Old Piggybacked on Neighbour's Network", ''[[The Straits Times]]'' ([[20 December]] [[2006]]).</ref> and on [[16 January]] [[2007]] he became the first person in Singapore to be convicted of the offence. He was sentenced by the [[Community Court (Singapore)|Community Court]] to 18 months' probation, half of which was to be served at a boys' home. For the remaining nine months, he had to stay indoors from 10:00 pm to 6:00 am. He was also sentenced to 80 hours of community service and banned from using the Internet for 18 months; his parents risked forfeiting a S$5,000 bond if he failed to abide by the ban. Tan was also given the option of enlisting early for [[National Service in Singapore|National Service]]. If he did so, he would not have to serve whatever remained of his sentence.<ref>Chua Hian Hou, "18-Month Net Ban, Community Service for PC Game Addict", ''The Straits Times'' ([[17 January]] [[2007]]); Ansley Ng, "[http://www.todayonline.com/articles/166274.asp Illegal Wireless-Network User Sentenced to 18 Months' Probation]", ''[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]'' ([[17 January]] [[2007]]).</ref> On [[4 January]] [[2007]], a second man, Lin Zhenghuang, was charged for using his neighbour's unsecured wireless network to post a bomb hoax on-line. Lin faces an additional 60 charges for using his notebook computer to illegally access the wireless networks of nine people in his neighbourhood repeatedly. Lin indicated that he intended to plead guilty.<ref>Chua Hian Hou, "21-Year-Old in Second Wi-Fi Case: The Charge: Using Neighbour's Network to Make Bomb Threat", ''The Straits Times'', ([[5 January]] [[2007]]).</ref>
