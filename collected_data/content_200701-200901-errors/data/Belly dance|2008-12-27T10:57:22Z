'''Belly dance''' ({{lang-ar|'''رقص شرقي'''}}) is a [[Western culture|Western]] term for a traditional [[Arab culture|Arab]] [[dance]] form. Some American devotees refer to it simply as "Middle Eastern Dance." In the [[Arabic language]] it is known as '''raqs sharqi''' ('''رقص شرقي'''; literally "oriental dance") or sometimes '''raqs baladi''' ('''رقص بلدي'''; literally "dance of country", and so "national" or "[[folk]]" dance). The term "raqs sharqi" may have originated in [[Egypt]]. In Greece and the Balkans, belly dance is called [[tsiftetelli]] (τσιφτετέλι), çiftetelli in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The term "belly dance" is a creation of [[Orientalism]], first used in English in 1899, and translating in French to "danse du ventre."<ref>Danse du Ventre is a colonial term given to women's dances of North Africa and the Middle East. Carlton, Donna. Looking For Little Egypt. Bloomington Indiana: IDD Books (1994): ix.</ref>

==General==
{{Confusing|date=July 2007}}
Native to North Africa and Asia, belly dancing (Arabic:''raqs al sharqi''رقص شرقي) is based on one of the oldest social dances in world history. Support for this theory stems from similarities between poses from the modern dance form and those depicted in ancient Egyptian art.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

There are two forms of belly dancing. The first is called '''raqs baladi,''' a social dance performed for fun and celebration by men and women of all ages, usually during festive occasions such as weddings and other social gatherings. The second form, the more theatrical version and the one most popular in America today, is called '''raqs sharqi.''' Like raqs baladi, raqs sharqi is performed by both male and female dancers.

In regions where belly dancing is native, boys and girls learn it informally from an early age by observing and imitating their elders during family/community celebrations and gatherings with friends.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Today, these ancient dance forms are taught in classes throughout the world where skilled dancers/teachers share the knowledge that has been passed down to them.
===Origins===
[[Image:Jean-Léon Gérôme 011.jpg|thumb|Artistic depiction of belly dancing]]
The origins of this dance form are actively debated among dance enthusiasts, especially given the limited academic research on the topic. Much of the research in this area has been done by the dancers themselves. However, the often overlooked fact that most dancing in the Middle East occurs in a social context rather than the more visible and glamorous context of professional nightclub performance,{{Fact|date=July 2007}} has led to a misunderstanding of the dance's true nature and has given rise to many conflicting theories about its origins. Because this dance is a fusion of many different styles it undoubtedly has a variety of origins, many of which stem from ethnic folk dancing. 

Many dancers subscribe to one or more of the following theories regarding the origins of belly dance:
* It descends from indigenous dances of [[Ancient Egypt|ancient]] [[Upper Egypt]] 
* It originated in Greece, spreading with [[Alexander the Great]]
* It descends from a religious dance once practiced by temple priestesses 
* It had been a part of traditional birthing practices in the region(s) of origin 
* It had spread from the migrations of the [[Romani people]] (also called "gypsies") and related groups descended from the [[Banjara]] of [[Rajasthan]]{{Fact|date=December 2007}} in northwestern [[India]]
* It originated in [[Uzbekistan]], traveling to India through the slave trade

Of these theories, the first one is rarely invoked, even though it has such a highly respected proponent as the Egyptian dancer [http://www.globaldancearts.com/article11.htm Dr. Mo Geddawi]. The most well-known and publicized theory is that belly dancing descends from a religious dance, and is usually the theory referred to in mainstream articles on the topic. 1960s [[Persian]] singer/dancer [[Jamila Salimpour]] was a proponent of this theory. It was also popularized in works such as "Earth Dancing" and "Grandmother's Secrets."

The traditional birthing practices theory relates to a sub-set of dance movements found in modern raqs sharqi. Strongly publicized through the [http://www.casbahdance.org/ROOTS.htm research] of the dancer/layperson-anthropologist Morocco (also known as Carolina Varga Dinicu), it asserts that belly dancing is a reworking of movements traditionally utilized to demonstrate or ease childbirth. Although lacking ideas about the exact origin of belly dance, this theory does have the advantage of being supported by numerous oral historical references, and is backed by commentary in [http://eres.geneseo.edu/farrellk/web/record.asp?id=53 The Dancer of Shamahka].

The Roma theory suggests that the [[Roma people|Roma]], and other related groups, either brought the form over as they traveled, or picked it up along the way and spread it around. Thanks to the fusion of Roma forms of dance into the raqs sharqi sphere in the West, these theories enjoy a popularity in the West that is not necessarily reflected in their original countries - although some of that may be due to strongly-held prejudices against the Roma. {{Fact|date=July 2007}}

Wherever it began, the dance has a long history in Africa and the Middle East. Despite the Islamic restriction of portraying humans in paintings, depictions of dancers have been found from the pre-Islamic and Islamic world. Books such as "The Art and Architecture of Islam 650-1250" show images of dancers on palace walls, as do [[Persian Empire|Persian]] miniature paintings from the 12th and 13th centuries. 

Outside the Middle East, raqs sharqi dancing was popularized during the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of the 18th and 19th centuries, whereby [[Orientalist]] artists depicted their interpretations of harem life in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Around this time, dancers from different Middle Eastern countries began to perform at various World Fairs. They often drew crowds that rivaled those of the technology exhibits. Some dancers were captured in early films. The short film, "Fatima's Dance," was widely distributed in the [[nickelodeon movie theater]]s. It drew criticism for its "immodest" dancing, and was eventually censored due to public pressure.

Some Western women began to learn from and imitate the dances of the Middle East (which by this time had been subjected to European colonization). Despite posing as a [[Java island|Javanese]] dancer, [[Mata Hari]]'s mystique is linked not to Indonesian dance but to Middle Eastern dance forms. The French author [[Colette]], and many other music hall performers, engaged in "oriental" dancing, sometimes passing off their own interpretations as authentic folkloric styles. The great dancer [[Ruth St. Denis]] also engaged in Middle Eastern-inspired dancing, but her approach was to put "oriental" dancing on the stage in the context of ballet, her goal being to lift all dance to a respectable art form. (In the early 1900s, it was a common social assumption in America and Europe that dancers were women of loose morals.)

Historically, most of the dances associated with belly dance were performed with the sexes separated; men with men and women with women. Few depictions of mixed dancing exist. This practice ensured that a "good" woman would not be seen dancing by anyone but her husband, her close family, or her female friends. Sometimes a professional dancer would go to a women's gathering with several musicians and get the women up and dancing. Today, sex segregation is not as strictly practiced in many urban areas, and sometimes both men and women will dance socially among close friends at a mixed function. However, while social dancing at family functions is accepted and even encouraged, there are many people in Middle Eastern and North African societies who regard the performances of professional dancers in revealing costumes for mixed audiences as morally objectionable. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that such performances be banned. {{Fact|date=July 2007}}

===Costume===
Because the most visible venue for belly dance is nightclubs (as well as video and DVD recordings of popular Egyptian dance celebrities), it is this version, rather than the folk or social versions, that is most popular. The costume now associated with this dance is called '''bedlah''' in Arabic (meaning "suit"), and was adopted by dancers in Egypt in the 1930s, eventually spreading to other countries in the region. It owes its creation to the harem fantasy productions of [[vaudeville]], [[burlesque]], and [[Hollywood]] during the turn of the last century, rather than to actual authentic Middle Eastern dress. An enterprising dancer, singer, and night club owner in [[Cairo]] named '''Badia Masabni''' is credited with adopting this costume because it was the image that Western tourists came to expect, rather than the native caftan/kaftan - which mostly concealed the contours of the body, with a scarf or belt tied around the hips to highlight the movements. The caftan is still used by performers to cover their costumes when not on stage.

The mainstays of costuming for the bedlah style include a fitted top or bra (usually with a fringe of beads or coins), a fitted hip belt (again with a fringe of beads or coins), and a skirt(s) (straight, layered, circular, or paneled). In the western world a "veil" - a 3-1/2 to 4-yard piece of fabric - may also be used to accentuate swirling arm movements throughout an entire dance or part of a dance. In the 1940s, [[King Farouk]] of Egypt employed Russian ballet instructor '''Ivanova''' to teach his daughters, and it was she who first taught the great Egyptian dancer [[Samia Gamal]] to use the veil to improve her arm carriage. Most Egyptian dancers use the veil as an opening prop which they discard within the first few minutes of their routines. 
 
In Egypt, dancers wear full-beaded dresses for the folkloric and baladi routines. These dresses are designed according to the type of dance and the tradition behind each dance. Similar outfits are also worn by American and European dancers when performing folk dances. Western dancers, however, have more freedom and may choose according to taste and fantasy. Costuming often varies with the particular style of dance.

In Egypt, America and Europe dancers wear full-beaded dresses for the folkloric and baladi dances. But generally costuming varies with the particular style of dance. Usually belly dance is associated with a cabaret costume. The cabaret costume usually consists of hip belt, bra, skirt and/or harem pants, and one or more veils. Decorative arm coverings, wristbands, headpieces, neckbands, scarves, face veils, jewelry and shoes are optional. Makeup usually is a very important piece of costume. 
The belly dancer’s belt should around the dancer’s hips, leaving the waist free to perform moves and belly rolls. The belt may have straight edge, or may be curved or angled and it should have jewels, coins, hanging fringe, or tassels on it to emphasize the movements of the hips. The dancer’s bra usually matches the belt in its decorative details and does not resemble lingerie. The classic harem pants are full, and gathered at the ankle, but could be modified. For cabaret pants are usually worn under skirt, because there could be revealed too much leg during the spins. The skirts are usually circle of different kinds of design and usually voluminous. The classic veil is usually three yards of sheer or featherweight fabric, often with decorative borders. Often to enhance the mystique of the dancer henna body art is often used. Henna is a natural vegetable dye which is prepared as a pate and topically applied to the skin. Usually henna is applied to the hands and feet. When removed after several hours, it it leaves reddish brown stain on the skin. 
Props are used to spark audience interest and add variety to the performance. Traditionally dancers were also performers, singers and musicians. There is a tradition to wear percussion instruments. Nevertheless today only very high skilled belly dancers use finger cymbals, many dancers rely on musicians to play for them. Some dancers use sticks and canes in their performances. Dancing with a veil which flows beautifully with dance movements adds a touch of elegance to the dance performance. Some dancers use sword for their performance, what can make the dance powerful and dramatic. The candles lights, which can dance with he dancer, add in the performance some mystery and drama. Some dancers use tambourine. This prop is very popular with Gypsy style troupes.

===Techniques===
Most of the basic steps and techniques used in belly dancing involve circular motions isolated to a certain part of the body. For example, a circular movement "drawn" parallel to the floor by the hips is known as a "hip circle", or by the rib-cage known as a "chest circle". Accents such as "hip lifts" or "drops" are use to draw the eye to hip movement such as "shimmies or hip circles", while shoulder or arm movements are to accent chest or belly undulations. Dancers often dance while balancing various props like baskets, swords or canes(canes in particular for folkloric dances.)as well as using silk or chiffon veils and wings for dramatic dance pieces.

==Raqs Sharqi==
Raqs Sharqi belly dancing consists of movements that are executed throughout the body. The focus of the dance is the pelvic and hip area. It is, fundamentally, a solo improvisational dance with its own unique dance vocabulary that is fluidly integrated with the music’s rhythm.

Raqs Sharqi dancers internalize and express the emotions evoked by the lyrics and the music.  Appropriately, the music is integral to the dance. The most admired Raqs Sharqi dancers are those who can best project their emotions through dance, even if their dance is made up of simple movements.  The dancer’s goal is to visually communicate to the audience the emotion and rhythm of the music. 
Raqs Sharqi translates from Arabic as "dance of the Orient" or "Oriental Dance". This is the oldest dance in the world.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} . Belly dance is a misnomer as the all parts of the body are involved in the dance, and the most important body part is the hips. The dancer’s goal is to visually communicate to the audience the emotion and rhythm of the music.

Many see Raqs Sharqi as a woman's dance, celebrating the sensuality and power of being a mature woman. A common school of thought believes that young dancers have limited life experience to use as a catalyst for dance.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Sohair Zaki, [[Fifi Abdou]], Lucy, Nagwa Fouad, and [[Dina Belly Dancer|Dina]] are all popular [[Egypt]]ian dancers above the age of forty.

Despite the fame of female dancers, men often perform Raqs Sharqi as well, however, not in public in Arab countries.

'''Egyptian-style''' raqs sharqi is based on Baladi an later the work of belly dance legends [[Samia Gamal]], [[Tahiya Karioka]], [[Naima Akef]], and other dancers who rose to fame during the golden years of the Egyptian film industry.  Later dancers who based their styles partially on the dances of these artists are Sohair Zaki, [[Fifi Abdou]], and [[Nagwa Fouad]].  All rose to fame between 1960 and 1980, are still popular today, and have nearly risen to the same level of stardom and influence on the style.

Though the basic movements of Raqs Sharqi have remained the same, the dance form continues to evolve. Nelly Mazloum and '''Mahmoud Reda''' are noted for incorporating elements of ballet into Raqs Sharqi and their influence can be seen in  modern Egyptian dancers who stand on relevé as they turn or travel through their dance space in a circle or figure eight.

In Egypt, three main forms of the traditional dance are associated with belly dance: '''Baladi/Beledi''', '''Sha'abi''' and '''Sharqi'''.

Egyptian belly dance was among the first styles to be witnessed by Westerners. During Napoleon's invasion of Egypt (the campaign which yielded the [[Rosetta stone]], leading to the translation of Egyptian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]]), Napoleon's troops encountered the [[Ghawazee]] tribe. The Ghawazee made their living as professional entertainers and musicians. The women often engaged in prostitution on the side, and often had a street dedicated to their trade in the towns where they resided, though some were quasi-[[nomadic]]. At first the French were repelled by their heavy jewelry and hair, and found their dancing "barbaric", but were soon lured by the hypnotic nature of their movements{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

The most important non-Egyptian forms of belly dance are the [[Syria]]n/ [[Lebanon|Lebanese]],[[Persia|Persian]] and the [[Turkey|Turkish]].

==Turkish forms==
Some mistakenly believe that [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] oriental dancing is known as [[Chifteteli|Çiftetelli]] because this style of music has been incorporated into oriental dancing by Greeks and Roma, illustrated by the fact that the [[Greece|Greek]] belly dance is called [[Tsifteteli]]. However, Turkish Çiftetelli is more correctly a form of wedding folk music, the part that makes up the lively part of the dance at the wedding and is not connected with oriental dancing.

Turkish belly dance today may have been influenced by Roma people as much as by the Egyptian and Syrian/Lebanese forms, having developed from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] ''rakkas'' to the oriental dance known worldwide today. As Turkish law does not impose restrictions on Turkish dancers' movements and costuming as in Egypt, where dancers are prevented from performing floor work and certain pelvic movements, Turkish dancers are often more outwardly expressive than their Egyptian counterparts. Many professional dancers and musicians in Turkey continue to be of Romani heritage as well. (However, people of Turkish Romani heritage also have a distinct dance style which is uniquely different from the Turkish Oriental style.)  Turkish dancers are known for their energetic, athletic (even gymnastic) style, and particularly, until the past few years, their adept use of finger cymbals, also known as [[zils]].  Connoisseurs of Turkish dance often say that a dancer who cannot play the zils is not an accomplished dancer.  Another distinguishing element of the Turkish style is the use of the [[Karsilama]] rhythm in a 9/8 time signature, counted as 12-34-56-789. Turkish belly dance costumes can be very revealing, with the belt sometimes worn high up on the waist and split skirts which expose the entire leg, although dancers today are costuming themselves more like Egyptian dancers and wearing more modest "mermaid"-style skirts. The Turkish style is emphasized further by the dancer wearing high heels and often platform shoes.  Famous Turkish belly dancers include Tulay Karaca, Nesrin Topkapi and Birgul Berai.

When immigrants from Turkey, [[Iran]], and the Arab states began to immigrate to New York in the 1930s and 1940s, dancers started to perform a mixture of these styles in the nightclubs and restaurants.  Often called "Classic Cabaret" or "American Cabaret" belly dance, these dancers are the grandmothers and great-grandmothers of some of today's most accomplished performers, such as Anahid Sofian and Artemis Mourat.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

==Belly dancing in the Western world==
[[Image:bellydancer costume.jpg|thumb|Fantasy-inspired non-historical Belly dancing costume, with coin bra, face veil, and beaded hip belt over skirt.]]
The term "belly dancing" (which is believed by some to be a mis-transliteration of the term for the dance style [[Beledi]] or Baladi, though it is also a literal translation of the term "danse du ventre" used by the French Orientalists) is generally credited to [[Sol Bloom]], entertainment director of the 1893 [[World's fair|World's Fair]], the [[World Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]].  Although there were dancers of this type present at the 1876 Centennial in Philadelphia, it was not until the 1893 fair that it gained national attention. There were authentic dancers from several Middle Eastern and North African countries, including Syria, Turkey and Algeria, but it was the dancers in the Egyptian Theater of The Street in Cairo exhibit who gained the most notoriety.  The rapid hip movements and the fact that the dancers were uncorseted, was considered shocking to the Victorian sensibilities of the day. In fact, there were attempts by many, most notably [[Anthony Comstock]], head of the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]], to have the Egyptian theater closed.

Although it is popularly believed that a dancer named  "Fatima", also known as [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]], stole the show, and continued to popularize this form of dancing, there is in fact no evidence to support this claim.<ref name="Carlton">Donna Carlton (1995). ''Looking for Little Egypt''. Bloomington, Indiana: International Dance Discovery Books. ISBN 0-9623998-1-7.</ref>  Neither photographs, nor reviews of the Egyptian Theater mention any such person.  The truth is that photographs, as well as accounts of the entertainments, show that there was not one solo dancer, but an entire troupe who performed in the Egyptian Theater.  The popularity of these dancers spawned dozens of imitators after the Fair, many of whom claimed to have been dancers at the Chicago Fair.  The most well known was Farida Mazar Spyropoulos, who supposedly stayed in the States after the Fair and married a Greek man named Spyropoulos. Oddly enough she was neither Egyptian nor Algerian, but Syrian.  Although she was Middle Eastern, there is no evidence that she was one of the dancers in the Egyptian theater.

The dance performed by the many dancers calling themselves "Little Egypt" was nicknamed the "[[Hootchy-Kootchy]]" or "[[Hoochee-Coochee]]", or the shimmy and shake. Due to cultural misunderstanding about the nature of the dance and misrepresentations by the many imitators in Burlesque halls and carnival sideshows, the western world considered it risqué, leading to the stereotype of an erotic suggestive dance.  

Because this dance style created such a craze, [[Thomas Edison]] made several [[film]]s of dancers in the 1890s.  Included in these are the [http://memory.loc.gov/mbrs/varsmp/1347.mpg Turkish dance, Ella Lola, 1898] and [http://memory.loc.gov/mbrs/varsmp/1143.mpg Crissie Sheridan in 1897] both available for on-line viewing through the [[Library of Congress]].   Another in this collection is [http://memory.loc.gov/mbrs/varsmp/1821.mpg Princess Rajah dance from 1904] which features a dancer playing [[Zil]]s (finger cymbals), doing "floor work", and balancing a chair in her teeth.

In addition, the sensational stories about the pseudo-Javanese dancer [[Mata Hari]], who was convicted in 1917 by the French for being a German spy during [[World War I]], and the fact that belly dancing could be seen only at [[vaudeville]] and in [[burlesque]] shows gave belly dancing a questionable reputation in polite society.  Hollywood did not help the reputation by only having three roles for a belly dancer (those of slave to be saved, a background dancer while the main characters talk, or a deceitful woman who uses her wiles to trick the main character), which created stereotypes of belly dancers that many dancers and instructors today are working hard to overcome. It is due to these stereotypes that many practitioners prefer to refer to their art as "Middle Eastern Dance".

While the beautiful classical Raqs Sharqi is still popular in the West, many dancers have created fusion forms such as [[American Tribal Style Belly Dance|American Tribal Style]] inspired by the folkloric dance styles of India, the Middle East and North Africa and even flamenco. Dancers in the United States, while respecting the origins of belly dance, are also exploring and creating within the dance form to address their own needs. Many women today in the U.S. and Europe approach belly dance as a tool for empowerment and strengthening of the body, mind, and spirit. Issues of body-image, self-esteem, healing from sexual violation, sisterhood, and self-authentication are regularly addressed in belly dance classes everywhere.

===United States===
[[Image:BellyDancer1.jpg|thumbnail|right|Tribal-style belly dancers.]]
With its emergence at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial, the last four decades of the 20th century moved belly dance in the U.S. more into the mainstream.  The current interest in the dance can be traced back to the 1950s and '60s.  It was in the ethnic nightclubs in major cities like New York, that most Americans first became acquainted with the dance.  These clubs were owned, operated and patronized by members of the ethnic communities of Mediterranean countries like Greece, Turkey, Lebanon and Syria.  At the time, most of the dancers were Greek or Turkish, but in time their ranks would grow to include Americans as well.  One example of this is the dancer "Morocco" of New York, who started her career in the night clubs of Greek Town on 8th Avenue.  These American dancers learned the dance by watching and imitating their Greek and Turkish sisters, as well as the patrons.

In the late 1960s and early '70s many of these dancers began offering dance classes.  With increasing exploration of the East in the late 1960s, many people became interested in everything Eastern, including dance.  Many touring Middle Eastern or Eastern bands took dancers with them as they toured to provide a visual representation of their music, which helped to spark interest in the dance.  This had the effect of creating many beautiful dancers who have generated greater interest in belly dancing.  The increased interest in belly dancing created diverse names for the same simple movements and the need to have a "style" as each teacher tried to distinguish differences in their way of teaching from other teachers.  This has hampered belly dance from acceptance with the more established dance forms because there is no nationally recognized choreography terminology that can be used to create repeatable dances.

A recent movement in the U.S. called [[American Tribal Style Belly Dance]], or ATS, represents everything from folklore-inspired dances to the fusion of ancient dance techniques from North India, the Middle East, and Africa.  Created in 1987 by Carolena Nericcio, founder of FatChanceBellydance in San Francisco, ATS has a format consisting of a vocabulary of steps that are designed to be performed improvisationally in a lead-follow manner.  ATS is performed in a group, typically with a chorus of dancers using ''zills'', or finger cymbals, as accompaniment.  The music can be folkloric or modern, and the costume is heavily layered, evoking traditions of any or all of its fusion of cultural influences. 

[[Suhaila Salimpour]] is a belly dance teacher who was born to Middle Eastern immigrants to the United States. She recently became the first American-born belly dancer to be interviewed on Arab television, and she is consistently compared to the native belly dancers in the Middle East. [http://www.therealsuhaila.com/bio.php]

Multicultural trends that have shaped Western and U.S. belly dance are still at work. Ever evolving, this versatile dance keeps absorbing a  blend of influences; modern fashion, film and television imagery, the worlds of country, rock, reggae, r&b, jazz, clubhouse, and hip hop music, underground subcultures, and many other contemporary influences. The umbrella term used to describe these hybrid forms of belly dance is "belly dance fusion", including "tribal fusion". One of the newest belly dance fusion trends is [[Gothic bellydance|gothic belly dance]] that incorporates many belly dance styles and motifs and seeks to express the darkness of the unknown that has inspired the music, philosophies, and lifestyles of the [[Goth subculture]]. [http://www.gothicbellydance.com/gothicbellydance/]

Every year in the U.S. more fusion and personal styles added into Belly Dance. From ballet, Urban Tribal, Techno Tribal, Afrocuban Tribal, World Fusion, Popping Fusions, Hip Hop Fusions, Jazz, contemporary, Indian, Asian gymnastics, fire dancing, stilt walking, hoop twirling and the reintroduction of burlesque type movements,{{Fact|date=July 2007}} With dancers seeking out education in more than one dance form in order to incorporate something new into their Belly Dance choreographies; it has become one of the most diverse dance forms within the U.S. to date.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

===Canada===
[[Image:Kensington Belly Dance 1.JPG|right|thumb|A belly dancer in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] in 2008]]
Canada has a belly dance community much like the United States with many different styles ranging from Raqs Sharqi to  Gypsy style. Many schools offer belly dance classes.

===United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland===

With its growing popularity in the western world, belly dance classes are thriving throughout the UK and Ireland, though the belly dance culture has been evidenced since the early 1960s, with many styles being taught including traditional, modern, tribal, Persian, Oriental, Turkish, Greek, Egyptian, American Tribal. 

Many festivals and workshops are held over the various regions of both countries, with three of the most popular being the Annual Glastonbury Majma, [http://www.majmadance.org.uk/], Raqs Britannia, [http://www.raqsbritannia.co.uk/] Jewel of Yorkshire, [http://www.jewelofyorkshire.co.uk] the Khelashi Belly Dance set in [[Wexford]], Ireland, [http://www.khelashidance.com/] and the Rashani Tribal Belly Dance set in [[Dublin]]. [http://www.rashanitribal.com/]

September 2007 sees the first Annual International Bellydance Congress being held in the UK. [http://www.bellydancecongress.com/index.htm]

===Australia===
The first wave of interest for belly dancing in Australia was during the late 70s to 80s with the influx of migrants and refugees escaping troubles in the Middle East, particularly the war in Lebanon. This was also the period that marked the increase in Middle Eastern musicians escaping the tensions in the region. Notable musicians of this period include drummer [[Jamal Zraika]].

There were notable performers during this period. These included [[Amera Eid]] who started the first belly dance boutique in Australia, Amera’s Palace, and [[Terezka Drnzik]] who established the first full time belly dance school in Sydney, The Akademi of Danse Orientale. Both of these experienced dancers and teachers have pedigrees linked back to [[Rozeta Ahalyea]] whose career spanned four decades.

The biggest belly dancing event is the annual Sydney Middle Eastern Dance Festival which started out in 1990 as a Bellydance-a-thon to raise money for charity.

Tribal style belly dance in Australia is gaining popularity as well. The most notable figure in this scene is Devi Mamak, the first Australian to have been accepted as a certified Fat Chance Bellydance teacher under the guidance of Carolena Nerricio. New Fat Chance moves developed in Australia by Devi Mamak and her troupe, Ghawazi Caravan, will be added to the official list of repertoire in the 8th video. The new moves are Arabic with a turn, triangle and the crazy camel.

==Male belly dancing==
[[Image:MaleBellyDance.jpg|thumb|right|Male belly dancer in Istanbul Turkey.]]
There is much debate over where and when men became part of the belly dance world. In various media, the art form is most often represented and emphasized as empowering for women, which may imply a belief that men have no place in an art form that is frequently and erroneously believed to be historically female. However, dancers such as Morocco (Carolina Varga-Dinicu), Tariq Sultan, Jasmin Jahal, and [[Laurel Victoria Gray]] have produced ample evidence to the contrary.<ref>Laurel Victoria Gray, "Dancing Boys," ''Arabesque'' magazine, Vol. 12 (May-June 1986). Gray discusses historical examples of male dancers, including those from the early centuries after the establishment of Islam, as well as the famous [[Bacchá|baccha]]s of Central Asia.</ref>

Pictorial evidence in the form of Turkish miniatures made during the [[Ottoman Empire]] show public performances being done by young men and boys called ''köçeks''. These dancers were widely popular; in fact, the Sultan employed a troupe of these male dancers in addition to a troupe of female dancers, (Metin And: A pictorial history of Turkish Dance). It has long been assumed that these dancers were female impersonators, because they performed in wide flamboyant skirts. A comparison with the female dancers however, shows that this was merely a costume worn for the dramatic effect caused by the swirling fabric. The female dancers did not wear specialized costumes at this time, but the ordinary dress of all women, which consisted of a pair of "harem pants", a long shirt, tight fitting vest covered by a flowing robe tied at the waist by a belt or shawl. Nevertheless, some of these male dancers did at times impersonate women. This was because they were not simply dancers but musicians and actors as well. As was the case in Shakespearean times, all dramatic roles were played by males since women were not allowed to entertain in public.

These dancers were so popular that fights often broke out over which troupe was considered the best. {{Fact|date=July 2007}}These upheavals were so frequent that they resulted in such performances being banned for a period of time during the 1830s.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Eventually the ban was lifted, but the decline of the Ottoman Empire, together with a push for modernization and the adoption of western tastes led to the eventual decline of such performances in Istanbul as well as other countries of the Empire such as Egypt.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Eventually, due to tourist demand, their place was taken by female entertainers.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Köçek dancers can still be found in the rural communities of Turkey, most notably in the region of [[Kastamonu]]. They have even begun appearing on television variety shows and on DVDs throughout Turkey.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

The current professional version of raqs sharqi, developed in Egypt in the 1930s, was deliberately designed to display an idealized notion of feminine grace beauty and glamor. Even so men continued to play a ''behind the scenes'' role in its development. Many of the most renowned choreographers and coaches are in fact men, such as Ibrahim Akef (cousin of the dance star Naima Akef) and Mahmoud Reda (founder of the renowned Reda Ensemble, the first theater dance troupe of Egypt).

The current trend of male performers of this dance form started in the '60s and 70s in the United States by such performers and teachers as Ibrahim Farrah (an American of Lebanese descent from Pennsylvania), Roman "Bert" Balladine and John Compton to name a few. Today male belly dancers are becoming more visible, not only in the United States, but around the world.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} These modern performers have even began to resurface in the Middle East in Greece, Turkey, Lebanon and Egypt. Most male dancers face artistic as well as social challenges. Such issues as whether there are or should be differences in costuming, attitude, and the dynamics of choreography between male and female belly dancing is a subject of debate among both male and female dancers.

Given the recent boom in interest regarding belly dance, a new generation of male dancers has embraced the form. Although still small in number compared to their female counterparts, their numbers have grown dramatically in the past 20 years.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}. 

Well-known male dancers in the U.S. and Latin America from the 1970s onward include Bert Balladine, John Compton, Sergio, Horacio Cifuentes, Kasim of Boston,famous Zill player on George Abdo's albums, Amir of Boston, Adam Basma, Ibrahim Farrah, Yousry Sharif, Aziz, Kamaal, Amir Thalib, Mark Balahadia, Francisco Carranza (Mr. Bellydance U.S. 1989) Canadian dancer Valizan, Jim Boz, and Tarik Sultan. Some of these dancers are American-born, others were immigrants from the Middle East and Europe. Basma was born in Lebanon. Sharif (who comes from Egypt and relocated to the U.S. in the early 1990s) was a member of the Reda Ensemble, the first national dance troupe in Egypt. Directed by Mahmoud Reda, a former gymnast who represented Egypt in the Olympics, the Reda Ensemble has existed continuously for over four decades. Other male belly dancers across the globe have made an impact on this dance form, most notably Horacio Cifuentes, who now resides in Germany and who has infused his ballet background with various types of Middle Eastern dance to create an impact on both male and female belly-dance styles. Tarik Sultan of New York has made a great contribution in the documentation of the history of the male role in the dance. His article "Oriental Dance, it isn't just for women any more", is one of the most historically and culturally accurate article on the subject. Also, Dr. [[Anthony Shay]], the author of ''Choreophobia'', in his article "The Male Dancer",  tackles the myths that the dance is a strictly female form and that men who did perform it were only imitating women. He offers historical and cultural sources to show that men have always been present in Middle Eastern dance, not only on the social level, but in the professional arena as well. Many dancers are now fast gaining recognition around the world as a dancers of exceptional skill such as; Egyptian male dancer Tito Seif, who performs in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh; Syrian male Dancer Jamil and Shiva, renowned performers in Sydney, Australia; Israeli born Asi Haskal, who holds many concerts in Israel. 

Regardless of occasional opposition both within the dance community by those who see the dance as an expression of female power, or those who view professional performances of this dance as "a woman's job", the number of male dancers around the world is growing and enjoying more acceptance.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

==Health and belly dancing==

The benefits of belly dance are both mental and physical. Dancing provides a good cardio-vascular workout and helps increase both flexibility and strength, focusing on the torso or "core muscles", although it also builds leg strength. Many belly dance styles emphasize muscular "isolations", teaching the ability to move various muscles or muscle groups independently. Veil work can also build arm, shoulder, and general upper-body strength, and playing the zils can build strength and independence of the fingers. Belly dance is suitable for all ages and body types, and can be as physical as the participant chooses.  The art form tones the arms, strengthens and tightens the abs and obliques, and improves flexibility. As a form of exercise, it can burn as many calories as light jogging, swimming or riding a bike.<ref>http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/belly-dancing/AN01491 Belly-dancing: A good exercise for weight loss? MayoClinic.com</ref>  

Belly dance is considered a non-impact, weight-bearing exercise, which is especially good for women, since it can reduce the risk of osteoporosis. There is minimal stress on knees and feet. Depending on the rhythms of the music and the repetitive body movements, participants can increase breathing and raise their heartbeat, which can assist in building cardiovascular strength. <ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.freediets.com/cardio-training/belly-dancing-workout |title = Belly-dancing Workout |date = [[2008-10-15]]| publisher = Freediets.com}}</ref>

Belly dance is the unique way to get in shape. According to Ali, the instructor in the studio, ”a single belly dance session works hundreds of muscles, burns calories and helps students to de-stress” (Smith 2003 ). An hour of belly dancing can burn as much as four hundred calories. No wonder the belly dance is so popular!  Also Smith says that according to the American Council on Exercise “belly dancing has emerged as one of the hot new workout trends in recent years”(Smith 2003 ). 
The advantage of belly dance is that it is suitable for all ages and body types (Shira 2008). Also the dance can be as physically challenging as the dancer or student chooses. Many belly dance styles teach the ability to move various muscles or muscle groups independently. Dancing with the veil can help to build strength of the upper-body, arm and shoulder. Playing the cymbals can get fingers trained to work independently and build strength. Hip kicks, circles, rolls and body twists strengthen abdomen muscles. The long muscles of the back are strengthen by hip kicks, hip circles and making figure 8s (Coluccia, Paffrath and Putz 2005). Belly dancing at low intensities increases metabolism.  The dance is not only strengthens, tones and tightens the body, but also improves flexibility. It is also a good calorie burn exercise. 
In the Eastern medicine as well as in physical therapy, the center of the body plays an important role. In Eastern and Indian philosophy pelvic area is the source of strength and storage of energy. Exciting the pelvic area with belly dance movements allows for the vital area at the base of the spine to open, freeing the flow of energy in this important area. 
The movements associated with belly dance strengthen the abdominal and pelvic region, preparing a woman for labor and birth with less pain and more celebration. Thus belly dancing could be used as a good pre labor therapy. Traditionally belly dance often was taught by wise women and includes a school course about pregnancy and birth. The pre- and postnatal research as well as the works of Frederic Le Boyer about gentle birth and Indian infant massage in the 1970s contributed to the decision to begin to place childbirth back into the hands of women (Coluccia, Paffrath and Putz 2005). 
Belly dance can reduce the risk of osteoporosis and offers just minimal stress on knees and feet. Research suggests that belly dance as a dance of the whole body is good and low stress training for women to prevent osteoporosis. Also the dance can assist in building cardiovascular strength. Professor Fobröse at the athletic academy in Köln, Germany, set out to “belly dance” research using electromyography, which had shown that regular belly dancing of about sixty minutes not only strengthens trapezius and abdominal muscles but also strengthens the heart and increases circulation (Coluccia, Paffrath and Putz 2005). 
The research of Anette Paffrath at the University of Hamburg involved experiences with belly dance by women with menstruation problems. The statements of the women showed a more positive approach toward their menstruation, sexuality, and bodies during the course of the class. The movements of belly dance are ideal for the mature body. All the organs affected by the hormonal changes of menopause are strengthened by increased blood circulation. 
Women are once again looking to belly dancing to discover the beauty and power of their bodies and to receive the physical and emotional benefits that arise from dance. Practicing the dance tones the muscles, gives a great work out, enhances the posture, strengthens the lower back, and mobilizes the abdominal and pelvic regions. Belly dancing also relieves menstrual problems and has been shown to be very useful during pregnancy and childbirth (Coluccia, Paffrath and Putz 2005). Belly dancing has enabled women to overcome self-esteem issues and increased their libido.
