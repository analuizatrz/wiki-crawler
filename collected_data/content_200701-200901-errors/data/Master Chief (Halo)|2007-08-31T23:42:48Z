'''Master Chief Petty Officer SPARTAN-117''', commonly referred to in-game as '''Master Chief''', is the fictional protagonist within the [[Halo universe]]. He is the main character of the [[video game]] ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', and one of the two [[playable character]]s in ''[[Halo 2]]''.  Additionally, he will appear in the soon to be released game ''[[Halo 3]]''. In addition to video games, the Master Chief appears in the novels ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'', ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', and ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', and ''[[Halo: Uprising]]'', and has cameos in both ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'' and the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]''.  He is voiced by [[Steve Downes]] in the [[video game]]s in which he appears.

The Master Chief is one of the most visible symbols of the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series. Originally designed by Marcus Lehto, Rob McLess, and Shi Kai Wang, the character is a [[silent protagonist]], towering but faceless, never once removing his armor or helmet in the games. The character has been referred to as an "icon", and is one of a few recognizable game mascots, a relative newcomer joining established characters such as [[Mario]], [[Lara Croft]], and [[Pikachu]]; ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' named the Master Chief as the eighth greatest video game character ever.

==Character design==
[[Image:Masterchief_sheik.png|thumb|150px|right|Shi Ki Wang's sketch which became the basis for the Master Chief.]]
The task of developing the Master Chief for the character's first appearance in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' fell on the project's Art Director, Marcus Lehto, and Rob McLees. Eventually, Shi Ki Wang was hired for conceptual art.<ref name=aoh20>{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |pages=20}}</ref> One of Wang's sketches was accepted and became the basis for the Master Chief. However, upon importing Wang's version into 3-D model form, it was decided the Master Chief looked too slender, "almost effeminate".<ref name=aoh20 /> The Master Chief was subsequently bulked up to the version currently found in the games.<ref name=aoh20 /> Similarly, the Chief's armor went through various changes, such as adding (and later in development losing) an antenna as well as gaining a green tint.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |title=One Million Years B.X. |author=Bungie|date=2006-02-10 |work=bungie.net|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060210224125/http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |archivedate=2006-02-10 }}</ref>

Bungie's [[Joseph Staten]] noted in an interview on creating believable video game characters that until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not considered how to make people immersed in the world of ''Halo''. "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," he said, "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space marine in really cool green armor."<ref>{{cite web|author=Cifaldi, Frank|date=2005-05-26|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050526/cifaldi_01.shtml|title=E3 Report: Developing Better Characters, Better Stories|work=gamasutra.com|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>

The Master Chief's voice is provided by [[Steve Downes]], a disc jockey and voice actor who had never played video games before ''Halo''.<ref name=interview1/> He was recommended for the part by Martin O'Donnell, who had done work with Downes for another video game.<ref>{{cite web|author=KLind|date=2006-07-26|url=http://buttonbasher.wordpress.com/2006/07/27/interview-master-chief-steve-downes/|title=Interview with the Master Chief|work=buttonbasher.com|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> Formal appearances of Downes at Bungie or Microsoft events have never occurred.

===Personality===
Steve Downes said that his voice acting for the Chief was based entirely on a written character description provided by Bungie, which specified a "[[Clint Eastwood]]"-like character of few words.  The actor noted in a [[podcast]] interview that during the recording he was given a fair amount of creative leeway in terms of developing the Chief's personality.<ref name=interview1>Downes, Steven. [http://www.davidjamesdague.com/MC_Part1.mp3 Interview with "Xerxdeej"], ''tiedtheleader.com''. (2005-08-23).</ref> In the games, the Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him a [[silent protagonist]].  Even during cutscenes, the Master Chief generally speaks sparingly, which leads to complaints that the Master Chief is not fleshed out believably character-wise.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bear, Erik|date=2004-12-16|url=http://www.sfhomeworld.org/make_contact/article.asp?articleID=164|title=''Halo 2'' vs ''Half Life 2''|work=sfhomeworld.org|accessdate=2007-08-19}}</ref>

In the official novels, the Chief's personality is expanded upon. Before awakening from cryosleep before the events of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', the Chief experiences a nightmare in which he is a powerless child, suggesting some physiological issues or trauma.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=15}}</ref> Being entirely encased in heavy armor and seven feet tall, the Chief (and other [[SPARTAN-II]]s) inspires awe and terror in friends and foes alike.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=15}}</ref> Despite his cold exterior, the Chief cares about his fellow soldiers, especially the Spartans he trained with.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=18}}</ref> At one point, the Master Chief risks being caught in a massive explosion in order to save a fellow Spartan,<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=324}}</ref> and withhold combat information on the threat of the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]] after realizing its disclosure would mean the death of [[Sergeant Major A.J.

===Outward appearance===
In the video games, the Master Chief is never seen without his armor. In the last cutscene of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', the Chief takes off his helmet, but the camera pans and his face is never seen; this intentional action on the part of Bungie Studios is to allow the player to better become the Master Chief.<ref name=time/> The only physical description of the Master Chief comes from the expanded universe. In the novels, the Chief is on one occasion briefed by Major Silva, and is told to come without his armor. During the briefing in ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', the Chief is described as being tall with short hair, serious eyes, and strong features.<ref name=tf80 /> His skin is "too white", testifying to the amount of time he spends in his armor.<ref name=tf80>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=80}}</ref> Inside his armor, the Master Chief stands about seven feet tall and weighs half a ton;<ref>{{cite book | year=2004 | editor=Bungie | title=''Halo 2'' Instruction Manual | pages=8 | publisher=Microsoft Game Studios|language=English}}</ref> without it, the Chief still stands 6 feet and 6 inches tall and weighs 287 lbs.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=205}}</ref>

===''Halo: The Fall of Reach''===
The Master Chief's backstory is never explained in the video games. However, the novel ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach|The Fall of Reach]]'', which serves as a prequel to the events of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', reveals much of the character's history. In the [[Halo universe]], this is the Master Chief's first chronological appearance; the book itself was released in [[2001]] as a companion to ''Halo''. The Master Chief, originally named John, was born in 2511 and spent the first part of his childhood on the human colony planet Eridanus 2, where he lived with his family. John was large for his six years of age, approximately a foot above his school peers. At this age he is described as a typical boy, having brown hair, freckles and a gap in between his two front teeth.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=24}}</ref> In 2517, John and seventy-four other children his age are covertly taken from their homes and replaced with [[United Nations Space Command#Flash clones|flash clones]] to hide the kidnapping.

These procedures had substantial risks,<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=56}}</ref> and only John and thirty-two other Spartans survive.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=60}}</ref>

The Master Chief's first appearance in the games is as the [[protagonist]] in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. In ''Halo: The Flood'', the [[2003]] novelization of the video game, the Chief is likewise the main character. The Master Chief first appears being awoken from cryosleep during the opening cinematic of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. Upon coming out of [[slipspace]], the ''[[Pillar of Autumn]]'' is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]]. Master Chief escapes the ship via a lifeboat. Upon landing on the surface of the ring, his first task is finding survivors from the crash. During the midst of fighting the Covenant, Master Chief and [[Cortana]] discover that Halo was created by the [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunners]] as a last line of defense against an alien parasite called [[Flood (Halo)|The Flood]].<ref name=bigblow/> The Flood is accidentally unleashed by the Covenant and begin to spread across the ring.<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark''': Greetings.

''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', the [[2003]] novel by [[Eric Nylund]], picks up the Master Chief's story soon after the events of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' and serves as a bridge between the events of ''Halo'' and ''Halo 2''.

The Chief retrieves his fellow soldiers, as well as [[Characters in the Halo series#Catherine Halsey|Dr. Catherine Halsey]], the creative genius behind the [[SPARTAN-II]] project. The Spartans then attack a massive Covenant command station, the ''Unyielding Hierophant'', preventing a Covenant assault on Earth.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=332}}</ref>

The Master Chief returns as one of two playable characters in ''[[Halo 2]]'', the [[2004]] sequel to the original video game. Upon arriving back on Earth following the events of ''First Strike'', the Master Chief's heavily damaged Mark V [[MJOLNIR]] armor is replaced by the newer Mark VI model, recently field-tested by [[Characters in the Halo series#Maria-062|SPARTAN-062 Maria]].<ref name=hgn71>{{cite book |last= Faerber|first= Jay|title=Armor Testing|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=|isbn=0785123725 |pages=71}}</ref> The Master Chief attends a brief awards ceremony aboard Cairo Station [[Magnetic Accelerator Cannon|defense platform]], which is interrupted by a Covenant invasion force.

===''Halo: Uprising'' and ''Halo 3''===
The Master Chief was only briefly featured in the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]'' story ''[[Halo Graphic Novel#The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor]]''; his cameo serves to tie the events of the story to around ''Halo: Combat Evolved''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sixth mission. However the Master Chief appears as a main character in Marvel's [[limited series]] ''[[Halo: Uprising]]'', breaking into a Covenant-held Forerunner structure before being captured by the Covenant.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bendis|first= Brian Michael|title=[[Halo: Uprising]], Book 1|year= 2007|publisher= [[Marvel Comics]]|location=New York |pages=20}}</ref> The comic, like ''First Strike'', serves as a bridge between two video games, ''Halo 2'' and ''Halo 3''. Very little is known currently about the Master Chief's role in Halo 3. The Halo 3 announcement trailer has placed him at New Mombasa, before a massive Forerunner artifact and surrounded by Covenant ships and aircraft. The third trailer depicts him fighting in multiple environments including Earth and on what appears to be a new Halo or an entirely new planet that shares Forerunner characteristics. A new development in Halo 3's story is that the Chief, along with his Marine allies, shall battle alongside the Arbiter and his Covenant separatists in an attempt to prevent the Prophet of Truth and his Covenant loyalists from activating the object unearthed during, or around the time of, the announcement trailer.

[[Team Ninja]] originally approached [[Bungie Studios]] asking to use the Master Chief in their upcoming game ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]''.
