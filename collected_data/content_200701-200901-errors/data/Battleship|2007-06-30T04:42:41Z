A '''battleship''' is a large, heavily-[[armor]]ed [[warship]] with a main battery consisting of the largest [[caliber]] of [[gun]]s. It is larger, better-armed and better-armored than [[cruiser]]s. 

Battleships have evolved a great deal over time, as designs continually adapt technological advances to maintain an edge. The word ''battleship'' was coined around 1794 and is a shortened form of ''[[ship of the line|line of battle ship]]'', the dominant warship in the [[Age of Sail]].<ref name ="OED">"battleship" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 4 Apr. 2000</ref> The term came into formal use in the late 1880s to describe a developed type of [[ironclad warship]],<ref name = "Stoll">Stoll, J. ''Steaming in the Dark?'', Journal of Conflict Resolution Vol. 36 No. 2, Jun 1992</ref> and by the 1890s design had become relatively standard on what is now known as the [[Pre-dreadnought|'''pre&ndash;Dreadnought battleship''']].  In 1905 [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] heralded a revolution in battleship design, and for many years modern battleships were referred to as '''dreadnought'''s.

More than a type of war vessel, battleships constituted a potent symbol of national might and naval domination.<ref name = "Sondhaus">Sondhaus, L. ''Naval Warfare 1815-1914'', ISBN 0-415-21478-5</ref> For decades, the numbers and abilities of battleships were a major factor in [[diplomacy]] and military [[strategy]]. The global [[arms race]] in battleship construction in the early 1900s was a significant factor in the origins of [[World War I]], which saw a clash of huge battlefleets at the [[Battle of Jutland]]. The construction of battleships was limited by the [[Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament|Naval Treaties]] of the 1920s and 1930s, but battleships both old and new were deployed during [[World War II]].

Despite this record, some historians and naval theorists question the value of the battleship. Aside from Jutland, there were few battleship clashes. And despite their great firepower and protection, battleships remained vulnerable to much smaller, cheaper ordnance and craft: initially the [[torpedo]] and [[Naval mine|mine]], and later [[aircraft]] and the [[guided missile]].<ref name = "Lenton">Lenton, H. T.: ''Krigsfartyg efter 1860''</ref> The growing range of engagement led to the battleship's replacement as the leading type of warship by the [[aircraft carrier]] during World War II, being retained into the [[Cold War]] only by the [[United States Navy]] for fire support purposes. These last battleships were removed from the U.S. [[Naval Vessel Register]] in March 2006.

==The ship of the line==
{{main|Ship of the line}}

The '''ship of the line''' was a large, unarmored wooden sailing warship mounting a [[artillery battery|battery]] of up to 120 [[smoothbore]] and [[carronade]] [[gun]]s. The ship of the line was a gradual evolution of a basic design dating as far back as the 1400s, and had changed little between the adoption of [[line of battle]] tactics in the early 17th century and the end of the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.<ref name = "OED" />
[[Image:Napoleon(1850).jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Le Napoléon (1850)|Le Napoléon]]'' (1850), the first steam battleship]]
The sheer number of guns fired [[broadside]] meant that the sailing battleship could wreck any wooden vessel, smashing the hull and masts and killing the crew. However, the effective range of the guns was as little as a few hundred yards, and sail tactics were dependent on the wind.

The first major change to the ship of the line concept was the introduction of [[steam power]] as an auxiliary [[Marine propulsion|propulsion system]]. Steam power was gradually introduced to the navy in the first half of the 19th century. 
The [[French Navy]] brought the technology to maturity with the 90-gun [[Le Napoléon (1850)|''Le Napoléon'']] in 1850<ref>"Napoleon (90 guns), the first purpose-designed screw line of battleships", ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship (p39)</ref> &mdash; the first true steam battleship.<ref>''"Hastened to completion Le Napoleon was launched on 16 May 1850, to become the world's first true steam battleship"'', ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship (p39)</ref> ''Napoleon'' was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots, regardless of the wind conditions: a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement. In the end, France and the United Kingdom were the only two countries to develop fleets of wooden steam screw battleships, although several other navies made some use of a mixture of screw battleships and paddle-steamer frigates. These included [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], [[Sweden]], [[Naples]], [[Prussia]], [[Denmark]] and [[Austria]].<ref name ="Sondhaus"/>

==Ironclads==
{{main|Ironclad warship}}

The adoption of steam power was only one of a number of technological advances which revolutionized warship design in the 19th century. The ship of the line was overtaken by the [[ironclad warship|ironclad]]: powered by steam, protected by metal armor, and armed with guns firing high-explosive shells. The first Royal Navy ship to bear the formal designation 'battleship' was the ironclad [[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS ''Warrior'']].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.northwood.mod.uk/nwood/history/warrior/warrior.htm|title=The HMS Warrior Story|accessdate=2007-03-18|publisher = Permanent Joint Headquarters, Northwood|format= |work= }}</ref>
[[Image:Hms warrior.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS ''Warrior'' (1860)]]]]
====Explosive shells====
Wooden hull ships stood up comparatively well to solid shot, as shown in the 1866 [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|battle of Lissa]], where the old Austrian steam battleship ''Kaiser'' ranged across a confused battlefield, rammed an Italian ironclad and took a pounding of several 300&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|pound]] shots at point blank range. Despite losing her bowsprit and her foremast, and being set on fire, she was ready for action the very next day.<ref name="Wilson">Wilson, H. W.: ''Ironclads in Action - Vol 1'', London, 1898, p. 240</ref> By contrast, guns which fired explosive or incendiary shells were a major threat to wooden ships, and these weapons became widespread in the 1840s. In the [[Crimean War]], the Russian Black Sea Fleet destroyed a flotilla of wooden Turkish ships with explosive shells at the [[Battle of Sinop]] in 1853. Later in the war French ironclad floating batteries used similar weapons against the defenses at [[Kinburn]].<ref name = "Lambert">Lambert, Andrew: ''Battleships in Transition'', pp. 92-96</ref>

====Iron armor and construction====
[[Image:LaGloirePhotograph.jpg|thumb|The French [[French battleship La Gloire|''La Gloire'']] (1859), the first ocean&ndash;going [[ironclad]] warship]]

The development of high-explosive shells made the use of iron [[armor]] plate on warships necessary. By the end of the 1850s, the potential of iron as a construction material for large ships had been proven by the mammoth [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']]. In 1859 [[France]] launched [[FS Gloire (1858-1883)|''La Gloire'']], the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She had the profile of a ship of the line, cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most of her journeys, ''La Gloire'' was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor.<ref>Gibbons, Tony: ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Battleships'', pp. 28-29</ref> ''Gloire'' prompted further innovation from the [[Royal Navy]], anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead. The superior armored frigate [[HMS Warrior (1860)|''Warrior'']] followed ''La Gloire'' by only fourteen months, and both nations embarked on a programme of building new ironclads and converting existing screw ships of the line to armored frigate status.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 30-31</ref> Within two years, Italy, Austria, Spain and Russia had all ordered ironclad warships, and by the time of the famous clash of the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] and the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] at the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] at least eight navies possessed ironclad ships.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/>
[[Image:LeRedoutablePhoto.jpg|thumb|The French [[French battleship Redoutable (1876)|''Redoutable]] (1876), the first battleship to use steel as the main building material.<ref>Gibbons, p. 93</ref>]]

Ironclad design saw wide experimentation. Different navies experimented with the positioning of guns, in [[turrets]] (like the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']]), [[centre-battery|centre-batteries]] or [[barbette]]s, or with the [[naval ram|ram]] as the principal weapon. As steam technology developed, masts were gradually removed from battleship designs. By the mid-1870s steel was used as a construction material alongside iron and wood. The French Navy's [[French battleship Redoutable (1876)|''Redoutable'']], laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876, was a central [[artillery battery|battery]] and [[barbette]] warship which became the first battleship in the world to use steel as the principal building material.<ref>Conway Marine, "Steam, Steel and Shellfire" (p. 96)</ref> Russia tried [[Russian battleship Novgorod|circular battleships]], which turned out to be one of the most unusual, if not outright bad, battleship designs ever built: when the guns were fired the ship spun on its axis like a top.<ref name = "Lenton"/>

==The pre-dreadnought==
{{main|Pre-dreadnought}}

[[Image:HMS Agamemnon (1908) profile drawing.png|thumb|Diagram of [[HMS Agamemnon (1906)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']], a typical late pre-dreadnought battleship]]

By the late 19th century, designs had gradually settled down what has become known as the '''pre-dreadnought battleship'''. These were heavily armored ships, mounting a mixed battery of guns in turrets, and without sails. The typical first-class battleship of the pre-dreadnought era displaced 15,000 to 17,000&nbsp;[[ton]]s, had a speed of 16&nbsp;[[knot (speed)|knots]], and an armament of four 12-[[inch]] guns in two turrets fore and aft with a mixed-calibre secondary battery in turrets amidships around the superstructure.<ref name = "Stoll"> An early design recognisably similar to the pre-dreadnought is the British [[Devastation class battleship|''Devastation''-class]] of 1871.<ref>Gibbons, Tony: ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Battleships'', p. 101</ref> However, it was not until the 1880s that similar designs were widespread,<ref name = "Lenton"/> and the type was perfected in the 1890s with the adoption of steel construction and armor.

The 12-inch main guns were the principal weapons for battleship-to-battleship combat. They were very slow-firing. The intermediate and secondary batteries had two roles. Against major ships, it was thought a 'hail of fire' from quick-firing secondary weapons could distract enemy gun crews by inflicting damage to the superstructure, and they would be more effective against smaller ships such as [[cruiser]]s. Smaller guns (12-pounders and smaller) were reserved for protecting the battleship against the threat of torpedo attack from [[destroyer]]s and [[torpedo boat]]s.<ref>War at Sea in the Ironclad Age, Richard Hill, ISBN 0-304-35273-X</ref>

The beginning of the pre-dreadnought era saw Britain's attempt to assert its naval might. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted, and expensive naval projects were criticised by political leaders of all inclinations.<ref name = "Sondhaus"/> However, in 1888, a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain's navy should be more powerful than the two next most powerful fleets combined was also enshrined. This policy was designed to deter French and Russian battleship-building, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with more and better pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.<ref name = "Sondhaus"/>

In the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th, the battleship building race became defined by conflict between Britain and Germany. The German naval laws of 1890 and 1898 authorised a fleet of 38 battleships, a vital threat to the balance of naval power.<ref name = "Sondhaus"/> Britain answered with further shipbuilding, but by the end of the pre-dreadnought era, British supremacy at sea had markedly weakened. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, twice as many as France and almost as many as the rest of the world put together. By 1897, Britain's lead was far less due to competition from France, Germany, and Russia, as well as the development of pre-dreadnought fleets in Italy, the United States and Japan.<ref>Kennedy, p. 209</ref> Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Chile and Brazil all had second-rate fleets led by [[armored cruiser]]s, [[panzership|coast service battleship]]s or [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]].<ref>Preston, Anthony: ''Jane's Fighting Ships of World War II''</ref> 

Pre-dreadnoughts continued the technical innovation of the ironclad. Turrets, armor plate, and [[steam engine]]s were all improved over the years, and [[torpedo]] tubes were introduced. A small number of designs, including the American [[Kearsarge class battleship|''Kearsarge'']] and [[Virginia class battleship|''Virginia'']] classes, experimented with all or part of the 8-inch intermediate battery superimposed over the 12-inch primary. Results were poor: recoil factors and blast effects resulted in the 8-inch battery being completely unusable, and the inability to separately train the primary and intermediate armament led to significant tactical limitation. Even though such innovative designs saved weight (a key reason for their inception), they proved too cumbersome in practice.<ref>Preston, Anthony. (1972) ''Battleships of World War I'', New York City: Galahad Books</ref>

==The Dreadnought era==
{{main|Dreadnought}}
In 1906, the revolutionary [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] made existing battleships obsolete. Combining an 'all-big-gun' armament of ten 12-inch (305&nbsp; [[millimetre|mm]]) rifles with unprecedented speed and protection, ''Dreadnought'' prompted navies worldwide to re-evaluate their battleship building programmes. The product of British technical superiority and the willpower of Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]], ''Dreadnought'' was no bolt from the blue. The concept of an all-big-gun ship had been in circulation for several years, and the Japanese had even laid down an all-big-gun battleship in 1904.<ref>Gibbons, p. 168</ref> The arrival of the Dreadnoughts sparked a new [[arms race]], principally between Britain and Germany but reflected worldwide, as the new class of warships became a crucial symbol of national power.

Technical development continued rapidly through the Dreadnought era, with step changes in armament, armor and propulsion meaning that ten years after ''Dreadnought'''s commissioning much more powerful ships were being built. These more powerful vessels were known as '''super-Dreadnoughts'''.

===The origin of the Dreadnought===
[[Image:Vittoriocuniberti001.jpg|right|thumb|Vittorio Cuniberti]]
[[Image:IJN Satsuma.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese battleship Satsuma|''Satsuma'']], the first ship to be designed (1904) and laid down (May 15th, 1905) as an "'all-big-gun" battleship was also the largest battleship in the world at the time of her launch.]]

The Italian naval architect [[Vittorio Cuniberti]] first articulated the concept of an all-big-gun battleship in 1903, stressing a large armored warship with a single [[caliber]] of guns as its only armament. When the [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]] did not pursue his ideas, Cuniberti wrote an article in [[Jane's Fighting Ships|''Jane's'']] propagating his concept, proposing the "ideal" future British battleship of 17,000&nbsp;tons, with a main battery of twelve 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns, 300 &nbsp;mm [[belt armor]], and speed of 24&nbsp;knots (44&nbsp;km/h).<ref>Cuniberti, Vittorio, "An Ideal Battleship for the British Fleet", All The World’s Fighting Ships, 1903, pp. 407-409.</ref>

The battleship [[Japanese battleship Satsuma|''Satsuma'']] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] became the first ship in the world to be designed (1904) and laid down (May 15th, 1905) as an all-big-gun battleship, although her armament would ultimately not be completed to specifications due to shortages of the British 12-inch Armstrong guns. ''Satsuma'' retained triple-expansion steam engines, though her sister ship [[Japanese battleship Aki|''Aki'']], completed in 1911, used turbines.
[[Image:Jackie Fisher.jpg|thumbnail|Jackie Fisher]]

The [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904-1905) provided operational experience to validate the 'all-big-gun' concept. At the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]] and the [[Battle of Tsushima]], pre-Dreadnought fleets exchanged volleys of 12&nbsp;in shells at ranges of 7 to 11&nbsp;[[kilometre]]s, beyond the range of the secondary batteries. It is often held that these engagements demonstrated the importance of the 12-inch gun over its smaller counterparts, though some historians take the view that the secondary batteries of the pre-Dreadnoughts were just as decisive as the larger weapons.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/> None of this was lost on the head of the British [[Admiralty]], [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]]. As early as 1904, Fisher had been convinced by the need for fast, powerful ships with an all-big-gun armament. If Tsushima influenced his thinking, it was to persuade him of the need to standardise on 12-inch guns.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/> Fisher's concern was that submarines and destroyers would be equipped with torpedoes which had a longer effective range than battleship guns, making speed imperative for [[capital ship]]s.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/> Fisher's preferred option for the Royal Navy was his brainchild, the [[battlecruiser]]: lightly armored but heavily armed with eight 12-inch guns and propelled to a remarkable speed of 25&nbsp;knots by [[steam turbine]]s. 

[[Image:HMS Dreadnought (1911) profile drawing.png|thumb|[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']]|left]]

It was to prove the revolutionary technology that the battleship HMS ''Dreadnought'' was laid down in 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armour belt, and was the first large ship powered by [[steam turbine]]s. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three along the centreline (one forward and two aft) and two on the wings, giving her twice the [[broadside]] of anything else afloat. She retained a number of 12-pounder (3-inch or 76 mm) [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] cannon for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was strong enough that she could conceivably go head-to-head with any other ship afloat in a gun battle and win.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 170-171</ref>

''Dreadnought'' was to have been followed by the three [[Invincible class battlecruiser|''Invincible''-class battlecruiser]]s, their construction delayed to allow lessons from the ''Dreadnought'''s construction to be used in their design. While Fisher may have intended ''Dreadnought'' to be the last Royal Navy battleship,<ref name ="Sondhaus"/> the design was so successful that he found little support for his plan to switch over to a battlecruiser navy. Although there were some problems with the ship (the design's [[wing turrets]] strained the hull when firing broadside, and the top of the thickest armor belt lay below the waterline when the ship was fully loaded), the Royal Navy promptly commissioned another six ships to a similar design in the ''Bellerophon'' and ''St Vincent'' classes.

===The dreadnought arms race===
In 1897, before the revolution in design brought about by ''Dreadnought'', the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building: a lead of 26 over France and of 50 over Germany.<ref>''The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery'', Paul M. Kennedy, ISBN 0-333-35094-4, p. 209</ref> In 1906, the Royal Navy now had a lead of only one: the ''Dreadnought'' herself. The new class of ship prompted an arms race with major strategic consequences. Major naval powers raced to build their own dreadnoughts to catch up with the United Kingdom. Possession of modern battleships was not only vital to naval power, but as with nuclear weapons today, represented a nation's standing in the world.<ref name = "Sondhaus"/> Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Austria and the United States all began Dreadnought programmes; and second-rank powers including Turkey, Argentina, Brazil and Chile commissioned Dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.<ref>''The First World War'', John Keegan, ISBN 0-7126-6645-1, p. 281</ref>

==World War I==
{{main|Naval Warfare of World War I}}
[[Image:British Grand Fleet 2.jpg|thumb|[[British Grand Fleet]] during [[World War I]]]]

The First World War was almost an anticlimax for the great Dreadnought fleets. There was no decisive clash of modern battlefleets to compare with the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. The role of battleships was marginal to the great land struggle in France and Russia; and it was equally marginal to the [[First Battle of the Atlantic]], the battle between German submarines and British merchant shipping. 

By virtue of geography, the Royal Navy could keep the [[High Seas Fleet|German High Seas Fleet]] bottled up in the North Sea with relative ease. Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British Dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on favourable terms: either inducing a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly fields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds.<ref>''The First World War'', John Keegan, ISBN 0-7126-6645-1, p. 289</ref> 

The first two years of war saw conflict in the North Sea limited to skirmishes by [[battlecruiser]]s at the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight]] and [[Battle of Dogger Bank]] and raids on the English coast. In the summer of 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on favourable terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets in the [[Battle of Jutland]]: an indecisive engagement.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 88-95</ref>

In the other naval theatres there were no decisive pitched battles. In the Black Sea, Russian and Turkish battleships skirmished, but nothing more. In the Baltic, action was largely limited to convoy raiding and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons was the [[Battle of Moon Sound]] at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The Adriatic was in a sense the mirror of the North Sea: the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by British and French blockading fleets. And in the Mediterranean, the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]].

The course of the war also illustrated the vulnerability of battleships to cheaper weapons. In September 1914, the U-boat threat to [[capital ship]]s was demonstrated by successful attacks on British cruisers, including the sinking of three British armored cruisers by the German submarine [[Unterseeboot 9 (1910)|U-9]] in less than an hour. Sea mines proved a threat the next month, when the recently commissioned British super-Dreadnought [[HMS Audacious (1912)|''Audacious'']] struck a mine. By the end of October, British strategy and tactics in the North Sea had changed to reduce the risk of U-boat attack.<ref>Massie, Robert. ''Castles of Steel'', London, 2005. pp127-145</ref> While Jutland was the only major clash of battleship fleets in history, the German plan for the battle relied on U-boat attacks on the British fleet; and the escape of the German fleet from the superior British firepower was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers closing on British battleships, causing them to turn away to avoid the threat of torpedo attack. Further near-misses from submarine attacks on battleships and casualties amongst cruisers led to growing paranoia in the Royal Navy about the vulnerability of battleships. By October 1916, the Royal Navy had essentially abandoned the North Sea, instructing the Grand Fleet not to go south of the [[Farne Islands]] unless adequately protected by destroyers. 

For the German part, the High Seas Fleet determined not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines; and since the submarines were more needed for commerce raiding, the fleet stayed in port for the remainder of the war.<ref>''The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery'', Paul Kennedy, ISBN 0-333-35094-4, pp. 247-249</ref>  Other theatres equally showed the role of small craft in damaging or destroying Dreadnoughts. The two Austrian Dreadnoughts lost in 1918 were the casualties of torpedo boats and of frogmen. The Allied capital ships lost in Gallipoli were sunk by mines and torpedo,<ref>[[HMS Majestic (1895)|HMS ''Majestic'']] and [[HMS Triumph (1903)|HMS ''Triumph'']] were torpedoed by ''U.21''; [[HMS Goliath (1898)|HMS ''Goliath'']] was torpedoed by the Turkish torpedo boat ''Muavenet''. </ref> while a Turkish pre-Dreadnought was caught in the Dardanelles by a British submarine.

==The inter-war period==
The inter-war period saw the battleship subjected to strict international limitations to prevent a costly arms-race breaking out.

For many years, German battleships simply ceased to exist. The [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]] required that most of the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in [[Scapa Flow]], [[Scotland]]. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. However, instead most of these ships were [[Scuttling|scuttled]] by their German crews on [[21 June]] [[1919]] just before the signature of the peace treaty. Versailles also limited the German Navy, preventing Germany from building or possessing any [[capital ship]]s.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', p. 118</ref>

While the victors were not limited by the Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were crippled from years of war. Faced with the prospect of a naval arms race against the USA, Britain was keen to conclude the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, requiring Britain to accept parity with the USA and abandoning the British alliance with Japan.<ref>Kennedy p 277</ref> The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, e.g. the [[Geneva Naval Conference|First Geneva Naval Conference]] (1927), the [[London Naval Treaty|First London Naval Treaty]] (1930), the [[Second Geneva Naval Conference]] (1932), and finally the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] (1936), which all meant limitations for major warships. These treaties would effectively end on [[1 September]] [[1939]] with the beginning of [[World War II]], but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 124-126, 139-142</ref> The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched from 1919&ndash;1939 than from 1905&ndash;1914. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British [[N3 battleship]], the first American [[South Dakota class battleship (1920)|''South Dakota''-class]], and the Japanese [[Kii class battleship|''Kii''-class]] &mdash; all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor &mdash; never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as '''treaty battleships'''.

===Rise of the aircraft carrier===
[[Image:Ostfriesland bombed by Mitchells team p19.jpg|thumb|Bombing tests which sank SMS ''Ostfriesland'', September, 1921]]

As early as 1914, the British Admiral Percy Scott prophesied that battleships would soon be made irrelevant by aeroplanes.<ref>Kennedy, op. cit., p. 199</ref> By the end of World War I, aeroplanes had successfully adopted the torpedo as a weapon.<ref>From the ''Guinness Book of Air Facts and Feats ''(3rd edition, 1977): "The first air attack using a torpedo dropped by an aeroplane was carried out by Flight Commander Charles H. K. Edmonds, flying a Short 184 seaplane from HMS ''Ben-My-Chree'' on 12 August 1915, against a 5,000 ton (5,080 tonne) Turkish supply ship in the Sea of Marmara. Although the enemy ship was hit and sunk, the captain of a British submarine claimed to have fired a torpedo simultaneously and sunk the ship. It was further stated that the British submarine E14 had attacked and immobilised the ship four days earlier.

However, on 17 August 1915, another Turkish ship was sunk by a torpedo of whose origin there can be no doubt. On this occasion Flight Commander C. H. Edmonds, flying a Short 184, torpedoed a Turkish steamer a few miles north of the Dardanelles. His formation colleague, Flight Lieutenant G. B. Dacre, was forced to land on the water owing to engine trouble but, seeing an enemy tug close by, taxied up to it and released his torpedo. The tug blew up and sank. Thereafter, Dacre was able to take off and return to the ''Ben-My-Chree''</ref> A proposed attack on the German fleet at anchor in 1918 using the [[Sopwith Cuckoo]] carrier-borne torpedo-bomber was considered and rejected &mdash; but it was only so long before such a technique would be adopted.

In the 1920s, General [[Billy Mitchell]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps]], believing that air forces had rendered navies around the world obsolete, presented his theory which claimed that aircraft could sink ships "under war conditions". This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell was nevertheless allowed to conduct a series of bombing tests on battleships. In 1921, he successfully sank numerous ships, including the stationary German World War I battleship, the [[USS Ostfriesland|''Ostfriesland'']] and the American pre-dreadnought [[USS Alabama (BB-8)|''Alabama'']].

Although Mitchell had stressed "war-time conditions", the ships themselves were obsolete, had no damage control and were stationary defenseless targets. The sinking of ''Ostfriesland'' was accomplished only by violating agreed-upon rules that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of various munitions; Mitchell's airmen disregarded the rule and quickly sank the ship in a coordinated attack. This proved&mdash;at least to Mitchell&mdash;that surface fleets were obsolete. In 1922, he met the like-minded Italian air power theorist [[Giulio Douhet]] on a trip to Europe and soon after an excerpted translation of Douhet's ''The Command of the Air'' began to circulate in the Air Service.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', p. 126</ref> While far from conclusive, Mitchell's test was significant in that it put proponents of the battleship against naval aviation on the back foot.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/>

===Rearmament===
[[Image:HMS Nelson (1931) profile drawing.png|thumb|Diagrams of the British [[Nelson class battleship]] of the inter-war period]]

The [[Royal Navy]], [[United States Navy]], and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] extensively upgraded and modernized their WWI-era battleships during the 1930s. One aspect of reconstruction were towers tall and stable enough to support optical rangefinder equipment for gunnery control. Some British ships received a large block superstructure nicknamed the "Queen Anne's castle", such as in the case of the ''[[HMS Queen Elizabeth (00)|Queen Elizabeth]]'' and ''[[HMS Warspite (03)|Warspite]]'', and this would be used in the new conning towers of the ''[[King George V class battleship (1939)|King George V]]'' fast battleships. The Japanese rebuilt all of their battleships, plus their battlecruisers, with the distinctive "[[pagoda]]" structures, though the ''[[Japanese battleship Hiei|Hiei]]'' received a more modern bridge tower that would influence the new ''[[Yamato class battleship|Yamato]]'' battleships. The US experimented with tripod and later caged masts, though after [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] some of the most severely damaged ships such as ''[[USS West Virginia (BB-48)|West Virginia]]'' and ''[[USS California (BB-44)|California]]'' were rebuilt to a similar appearance to their [[Iowa class battleship|fast battleship]] contemporaries. Optic fire-control systems were rendered obsolete by radar, which was effective beyond visual contact and was effective in complete darkness or adverse weather conditions[http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_fire.htm]. 

Even when the threat of war became significant again in the late 1930s, battleship construction never regained the level of importance which it had held in the years before World War I. The "building holiday" imposed by the naval treaties meant that the building capacity of dockyards worldwide was relatively reduced, and the strategic picture had changed. The development of the [[strategic bomber]] meant that the navy was no longer the only method of projecting power overseas. And the development of the [[aircraft carrier]] meant that battleships had a rival for the resources available for capital ship construction.

In Germany, the ambitious [[Plan Z]] for naval rearmament was abandoned in favour of a strategy of submarine warfare supplemented by the use of [[Bismarck class battleship|''Bismarck ''class battleship]]s and battlecruisers as commerce raiders. In Britain, the most pressing need was for air defences and convoy escorts to safeguard the civilian population from bombing or starvation, and re-armament construction plans consisted of five ships of the [[King George V class battleship (1939)|''King George V ''class]]. It was in the Mediterranean that navies remained most committed to battleship warfare. France intended to build six battleships of the [[Dunkerque class battleship|''Dunkerque'']] and [[Richelieu class battleship|''Richelieu'']] classes, and the Italians two powerful [[Littorio class battleship|''Littorio'']]-class ships. Neither navy built significant aircraft carriers. The USA preferred to spend limited funds on aircraft carriers until the [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota ''Class]]. Japan, also prioritising aircraft carriers, nevertheless began work on the two mammoth [[Yamato class battleship|''Yamato ''class battleship]]s.<ref name = "Lenton"/>

At the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Spanish navy consisted of two small dreadnought battleships, ''España'' and ''Jaime I''. ''España'', by then in reserve at the northwestern naval base of El Ferrol, fell into Nationalist hands in July 1936. The crew onboard ''Jaime I'' murdered their officers, mutinied and joined the Republican Navy. Thus each side would have one battleship; however, the Republican Navy generally lacked experienced officers. The Spanish battleships mainly restricted themselves to mutual blockades, convoy escort duties and shore bombardments&mdash;they rarely involved themselves in direct fighting against other surface units.<ref>Gibbons, p. 195</ref> In April 1937, ''España'' ran onto a mine that had been laid by own forces and sank with little loss of life. In May 1937, ''Jaime I'' was damaged by Nationalist air attacks and a grounding incident. The ship was forced to go back to port to be repaired. There she was again hit by several aerial bombs. It was then decided to tow the battleship to a more secure port, but during the transport she suffered an internal explosion that caused 300 deaths and her total loss. Several Italian and German capital ships participated in the non-intervention blockade. On May 29, 1937, two Republican aircraft managed to bomb the German pocket battleship [[German battleship Deutschland|''Deutschland'']] outside [[Ibiza]], causing severe damage and loss of life. [[German battleship Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] retaliated two days later by bombarding the city of [[Almería]] causing much destruction, and the resulting [[Deutschland incident]] meant the end of German and Italian support for non-intervention.<ref>Greger, René: ''Schlachtschiffe der Welt'', p. 251</ref>

==World War II==
German battleships &mdash; obsolete pre-dreadnoughts &mdash; fired the first shots of World War II with the bombardment of the Polish garrison at [[Westerplatte]];<ref>Gibbons, p. 163</ref> and the final surrender of the Japanese Empire took place aboard a United States Navy battleship, the USS Missouri. Between the two events, it became clear that battleships were now essentially auxiliary and aircraft carriers the new principal ships of the fleet. 

Battleships played a part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theatres; in the Atlantic, the Germans experimented with taking the battleship beyond conventional fleet action into an independent commerce raider. However, there were few battleship-on-battleship engagements. Battleships had little impact on the destroyer and submarine [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|Battle of the Atlantic]], and most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war were determined by [[aircraft carrier]]s.

In the first year of the war, battleships and battlecruisers defied predictions that aircraft would dominate naval warfare. [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and [[German battlecruiser Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] surprised and sank the aircraft carrier [[HMS Glorious|''Glorious'']] off western [[Norway]] in June 1940.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 246-247</ref> Although unescorted carriers still were considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, and therefore had to travel with escort, this engagement marked the last time a fleet carrier be sunk by surface gunnery. In the [[Attack on Mers-el-Kébir]], British capital ships opened fire on the French battleships harboured in Algiers with their own heavy guns, and later pursued fleeing French ships with planes from aircraft carriers.

===Taranto and Bismarck===
In late 1940 and 1941, a range of engagements saw battleships harassed by carrier aircraft.

The first example of the power of naval aviation was the British air attack on the Italian naval base at [[Battle of Taranto|Taranto]] that took place on the night of [[11 November]]&ndash;[[12 November]] [[1940]]. The Royal Navy flew a small number of aircraft to attack the Italian fleet at harbour. One Italian battleship was sunk and two damaged. Just as importantly the attack forced the Italian navy to change tactics and seek battle against the superior British navy, resulting in the defeat at the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]].

The  battleship war in the Atlantic was driven by the attempts of German capital ship [[commerce raider]]s&mdash;two battleships, the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] and the [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']], and two battlecruisers&mdash;to influence the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|Battle of the Atlantic]] by destroying Atlantic convoys supplying the United Kingdom. The superior numbers of British surface units devoted themselves to protecting the [[convoy]]s, and seeking out and trying to destroy the German ships, assisted by both naval and land-based aircraft and by sabotage attacks. On 24 May 1941, during an attempt to break out into the North Atlantic, the  battleship commerce raider [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']],  was engaged by the British battleship HMS ''Prince of Wales'' and the battlecruiser [[HMS Hood (1918)|''Hood'']]. ''Hood'' was sunk quickly by a hit to her magazines, while ''Bismarck'' and ''Prince of Wales'' scored three hits on each other, which compelled the German battleship to return home.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 228-229</ref> The Royal Navy hunted down ''Bismarck''; an attack by [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] [[biplane]] torpedo-bombers from the [[aircraft carrier]] [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|''Ark Royal'']] disabled her steering and allowed the British battleships to catch up; ''Bismarck'' was sunk on [[May 27]].<ref>Zetterling, Niklas: ''Bismarck'', pp. 248-260</ref>

===The Pacific battles===
[[Image:USS Pennsylvania moving into Lingayen Gulf.jpg|thumb|left|[[USS Pennsylvania (BB-38)|''Pennsylvania'']] leading battleship [[USS Colorado (BB-45)|''Colorado'']] and cruisers [[USS Louisville (CA-28)|''Louisville'']], [[USS Portland (CA-33)|''Portland'']], and [[USS Columbia (CL-56)|''Columbia'']] into [[Lingayen Gulf]], [[Philippines]], January 1945]]
In many of the crucial battles of the Pacific, for instance [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] and [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles.  Battleships in the Pacific ended up primarily performing shore bombardment and anti-aircraft defense for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's ''Yamato'' class, which carried a main battery of nine 18.1-[[inch]] (460 [[millimetre]]) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were seldom given a chance to show their potential.

====Pearl Harbor====
Before hostilities broke out in the Pacific Theatre, there was extensive pre-war planning centered around dreadnoughts. The [[Royal Navy]] could not achieve parity with the estimated nine Japanese [[capital ships]] in Southeast Asia, since doing so would leave only a handful of ships to use against Nazi Germany. However, Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was optimistic about the improving situation in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean and [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|allocating two ships]] to the colony's defense was seen as a compromise. Furthermore, the US Navy would agree to send its Pacific Fleet with its eight battleships to [[Singapore]] in the event that hostilities with Japan broke out.[http://www.forcez-survivors.org.uk/sinking1.html]

On [[December 7]], [[1941]] the Japanese launched a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Within a short time five of eight U.S. battleships were sunk or sinking, with the rest damaged. The Japanese had neutralized the U.S. battleship force in the Pacific region through an air attack, and thereby proven Mitchell's theory, showing the vulnerability of major warships lying at anchor, as at Taranto. The American aircraft carriers were however out to sea and evaded detection. They in turn would take up the fight, eventually turning the tide of the war in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. 

The [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of the British battleship ''Prince of Wales'']] and her escort, the battlecruiser HMS ''Repulse'' further demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack, in this case while at sea without air cover. Both ships were on their way to assist in the defense of [[Singapore]] when they were caught by Japanese land-based [[bomber]]s and [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] on [[December 10]] [[1941]]. ''Prince of Wales'' has the distinction of being the first modern battleship sunk by aircraft while underway and able to defend herself.<ref>Axell, Albert: ''Kamikaze'', p. 14</ref> 

These two incidents forced the Allies to make the aircraft carrier their most important vessel over the battleship, since it emphasized the potency of air power and because they had no operational dreadnought vessels available. 

====Guadalcanal====
Initially, when the US entered the war in December 1941, they had no battleships available in the Pacific Theatre. Eight of them were sunk or crippled at Pearl Harbor and would be sent home for repairs and reconstruction; regardless they would not have been able to keep up with the carriers. As well, the new [[fast battleships]] of [[North Carolina class battleship|''North Carolina'']] and [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota'']] classes were still undergoing trials. ''North Carolina'' and ''South Dakota'' were ready by summer of 1942 and provided crucial anti-aircraft defense during the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Eastern Solomons]] and [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz Islands]] carrier battles.
[[Image:Yamatotrials.jpg|thumb|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], seen in 1941, and her sister ship [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']] were the largest battleships in history]]

By contrast, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] enjoyed the advantage of a dozen operation battleships early in the war, but chose not to deploy them in any significant engagements. The ''[[Fuso class battleship|Fusōs]]'' and [[Ise class battleship|''Ise''s]], despite their extensive modernization and respectable speeds, were relegated to training and home defense, while the [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato''s]] and [[Yamato class battleship|''Yamato''s]] were being saved for [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|"Decisive Battle"]] which never came to fruition on Japanese terms. In fact, the only Japanese battleships to see much action in the early stages were [[Kongō class battlecruiser|''Kongō''s]] who served mostly as carrier escorts due to their high speed.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 262-263</ref>

During the later part of the [[Guadalcanal campaign]] in fall 1942, the Japanese and US were both forced to commit their battleships to surface combat, due to the need to carry out night operations, and because of the exhaustion of their carrier forces. During the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal#First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.2C November 13|First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], battleships [[Japanese battleship Hiei|''Hiei'']] and [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']] were driven off by a force of US cruisers and destroyers. Several US ships were lost and others were crippled but they managed to inflict critical damage on ''Hiei'', which was abandoned after being subject to repeated air attacks that made salvage impossible. The following evening, at the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on [[15 November]] [[1942]], the United States battleships [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']] and [[USS Washington (BB-56)|''Washington'']] fought and destroyed the surviving Japanese battleship [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']].

====Leyte Gulf====
At the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], heavy aircraft losses made the carriers ineffectual and forced the Japanese to finally commit their dreadnoughts, both old and new, to the upcoming [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Campaign]]. The objective in the "Decisive Battle" was to stop the Allies from capturing the Philippines, which would cut off the oil supply for the Empire and render the navy useless. The [[Battle off Samar]], on [[25 October]] [[1944]], proved that battleships were still a lethal weapon. The American [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]] of "Taffy 3"  had a narrow escape from falling under the guns of the Japanese battleships [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], [[Japanese battleship Kongō|''Kongō'']], [[Japanese battleship Haruna|''Haruna'']] and [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] and their [[cruiser]] escort. American destroyers and aircraft attacked the battleships, enabling the American task force to disengage.  Inexplicably, the Japanese fleet disengaged as well, despite being near to their intended target - the American amphibious landing forces at Leyte.

At Leyte Gulf, on [[25 October]] [[1944]], six battleships, led by Admiral [[Jesse Oldendorf]] of the U.S. 7th Fleet sank the Japanese admiral [[Shoji Nishimura]]'s battleship [[Japanese battleship Yamashiro|''Yamashiro'']] and would have sunk [[Japanese battleship Fusō|''Fusō'']] if it had not already been broken in two by destroyer torpedoes moments earlier during the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]]. This engagement marked the last time in history when battleship faced battleship.  It was also the day before this battle in a separate group further north that [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']], sistership to ''Yamato'', was sunk by aircraft attacks long before she could come within striking range of the American fleet.

===Soviet and Finnish battles===
During the Soviet-Finnish [[Winter War]], the Soviet battleships [[Battleship Petropavlovsk (1914)|''Marat'']] and [[Russian battleship Gangut (1909)|''Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya'']] made several attempts to neutralize Finnish coastal batteries in order to implement a full naval blockade. The damage was however little on the Finnish side and the defenders bit back, claiming at least one hit on ''Marat''.<ref>Appel, Erik: ''Finland i krig 1939-1940'', p. 182</ref> During the German assault on the Soviet Union, the Soviet battleships would serve as convoy escorts during the evacuation of [[Tallinn]], and as floating batteries during the [[siege of Leningrad]].<ref>Linder, Jan: ''Ofredens hav'', pp. 50-51</ref> The dense German and Finnish minefields and the submarine nets would effectively restrict Soviet traffic in the Gulf of Finland, forcing the larger vessels to remain at port.<ref>Linder, Jan: ''Ofredens hav'', pp. 50-51</ref><ref>Brunila, Kai: ''Finland i krig 1940-1944'', pp. 100-108, 220-225</ref> The ''Marat'' would eventually be sunk at her moorings by the German [[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka]] pilot [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] on [[23 September]] [[1941]]. The wreck continued in action as a floating battery for the remainder of the siege. ''Marat'' would later be refloated and both battleships served until the 1950s.<ref>Greger, René: ''Schlachtschiffe der Welt'', pp. 201</ref>

===Fire support===
With the German capital-ship raiders sunk or forced to remain in port, shore bombardment became the focus of Allied battleships in the Atlantic. It was while covering the Allied invasion of Morocco that the [[USS Massachusetts (BB-59)|''Massachusetts'']] fought and disabled [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] battleship [[French battleship Jean Bart (1940)|''Jean Bart'']] on [[27 October]],[[1942]].  A concentration of six battleships occurred as part of [[Operation Neptune]], in support of the D-Day landings in June 1944. D-Day also saw the humble sacrifice of two obsolete dreadnoughts, which were sunk as part of the breakwater around the Allied [[Mulberry harbour]]s.

===Aerial Defense===
[[Image:Kamikaze zero.jpg|thumb|A kamikaze (just left of center near the top border), a [[A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zero]] in this case, about to hit the [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']]]]

The [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse]] off the coast of [[Malaya]] in 1941 demonstrated that even the most modern battleships could not hold off aerial attacks without air cover. Afterwards, an [[aircraft carrier]]'s [[combat air patrol]] proved to be the most effective form of defense against enemy bombers; nonetheless a modern [[fast battleship]] could provide a vital point defense against attackers that broke through the fighter screen. The ''North Carolina'' and ''South Dakota'' demonstrated just that in the battles of the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Eastern Solomons]] and [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz Islands]], respectively, with ''North Carolina'' downing between 7 to 14 planes while ''South Dakota'' shot down 26 to 32. The battleships' presence was crucial during these 1942 battles, as the US were still months from being able to realize their material advantage, with too few planes and ships to interdict enough of the skilled Japanese pilots.

By 1944, Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]] had arrayed his forces, with the first line of defence being a radar-vectored [[combat air patrol]], and any attackers who managed to get through would be faced with anti-aircraft fire from a line of screening battleships and cruisers. This exacted such a heavy toll on the Japanese during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea#Japanese raids: The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot|Battle of the Philippine Sea]] that they failed to cause any significant damage to their targets, the aircraft carriers.[http://www.combinedfleet.com/btl_ps.htm] That being said, circumstances were vastly different from 1942 as the Japanese aircrews were inexperienced, and they were going up against veteran US pilots as well as many new carriers and battleships.

====AA Guns====
By the time that WWII came around, most battleships were heavily defended by numerous anti-aircraft batteries. Light AA guns (the Allies used autocannons like the [[Bofors 40 mm gun]] and [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]]) were similar to these on smaller ships but battleships had far more of them. Complementing these weapons were the developments of the [[proximity fuse]] and [[radar]].

Post WWI battleships, particularly British and American, had discarded the [[casemate]]s in favour of turret-mounted dual purpose secondary batteries ([[5"/38 caliber gun|5-inch]] or 6-inch calibre). Secondaries were initially designed to deal with rushing destroyers and torpedo boats, but there arose a need for heavy anti-aircraft armament as the potency of aircraft grew, particularly torpedo planes. The rationale was that it is unlikely that a battleship would be simultaneously facing both destroyers and aircraft, but it would take up too much space to have separate types of guns to deal with both threats. Both weapons had similar calibers and so they could be merged into a single battery type, and the turret mountings were less susceptible to flooding and had a better firing arc than casemates. The space saved from combining the two types of guns added to simplification of supply, increased deck armour coverage, stowage of other equipment, more light anti-aircraft batteries, and other needs. 

The [[Nelson class battleship]], incorporating many concepts from the [[G3 battlecruiser]], was the first design to incorporate the dual-purpose secondary battery. The secondaries were dual-purpose guns, which could be used both against surface and airborne attacks. Compared to light AA they had a slower rate of fire but they had a greater range and had sufficient punch to knock enemy planes out of the sky, which was a crucial defense against Japanese [[Kamikaze]]s in the latter years of WWII. They could also fire into the sea and create waterspouts to slap low flying torpedo planes with tonnes of water. Battleships could mount many more of these DP batteries than cruisers or carriers. 

German vessels such as the ''Bismarck'' class, by comparison, had dedicated secondary anti-ship batteries as well as dedicated heavy anti-aircraft batteries, instead of adopting the dual-purpose secondaries like the British or Americans. The ''Bismarck'' for instance had a battery of twelve 6&nbsp;inch (150&nbsp;mm) cannon that could be used against ships only, as they could not be elevated to fire on high-level targets, another sixteen 4&nbsp;inch (105&nbsp;mm) battery was mounted to deal with air threats. This tended to complicate ammunition supplies, take up more space, and compromise the numbers of both guns (reducing the anti-ship ''or'' anti-aircraft broadside). Like the Germans, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] also suffered similar problems as their secondaries were too slow to track aircraft.[http://www.combinedfleet.com/127_50.htm]

The Japanese even used the "San Shiki" (the Beehive) Model 13 anti-aircraft shell for the main gun armament of the  [[Yamato class battleship]]s, which would have in theory functioned as a supersized "shotgun", though this was not considered a success.[http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/wwii/Japanese.navy/jap_yamoto_bat.txt])

====Armour====
In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Jutland]] and post-WWI era, designers began drawing up armour schemes that protected against ordnance dropped by aircraft or submarines. The five ships of the American ''[[Tennessee class battleship|Tennessee]]'' and ''[[Colorado class battleship|Colorado]]'' classes had considerably enhanced underwater hull protection over that of previous battleships, as the result of result of extensive experimentation and testing. The proposed [[G3 battlecruiser]] planned to incorporate a thoroughly tested torpedo defense scheme, which was later used in the ''Nelson''-class. Not surprisingly, as many WWI battleships did not have such a protection system, they fared poorly against such weapons, which in WWII were increasingly being delivered by submarines and aircraft.

Battleships had an armoured belt for underwater protection against torpedoes or shells which hit betlow the waterline. From the lessons of Jutland, the protection scheme incorporated a sophisticated torpedo defense system (TDS)[http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_underw.htm]. By adopting a turbo-electric drive, this allowed a wholesale rearrangement and fine subdivision of the machinery spaces, while simultaneously narrowing them and permitting more space outboard for a layered system of voids, liquid-filled tanks and thin armored bulkheads[http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-071.htm]. By contrast, "thin-skinned" cruisers and carriers relied only on numerous compartments to prevent flooding from spreading (some were upgraded with anti-torpedo blisters, though these were much inferior to the battleship's armoured belt). During [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], it was the TDS and damage control counterflooding that saved ''[[USS West Virginia (BB-48)#7 December 1941|West Virginia]]'' from nine torpedo hits, while the ''[[USS Oklahoma (BB-37)|Oklahoma]]'' which lacked such a system capsized after just three such strikes. 

During the attack on the ''[[IJN Yamato|Yamato]]'', according to a PBS documentary, US torpedo bombers were taught to aim for either the bow or the stern, where the protective belt did not extend to. In order for torpedo planes to make their runs successfully, it was the job of fighters to strafe the battleship to suppress the AA guns, and for dive bombers to wreck havoc on the upper decks, destroying AA weapons and fire control systems. Pilots were also instructed to focus on one side of the ship, causing massive flooding which was difficult to counteract, leading to the ship capsizing. A bow hit was deadly, since the onrushing water from the battleship's high speed could wrench the hole open wider and collapse compartment bulkheads, which was why ''Yamato's'' sister ship ''[[IJN Musashi|Musashi]]'' foundered at Sibuyan Sea during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]].[http://www.combinedfleet.com/eclipkong.html] The stern attacks are best demonstrated by the cases of ''Bismarck'' and ''Prince of Wales''; the rudders and screws were similarly vulnerable.

As the armour decks of battleships were also of sufficient thickness, the [[Fleet Air Arm]] planned to release their armour-piercing bombs from a certain height in order to penetrate the Tirpitz's armor during [[Operation Tungsten]][http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_armor.htm]. As the British pilots did not release their ordnance from the optimal altitude, the German battleship suffered from extensive damage to her upperworks but her deck armor remained intact.[http://www.bismarck-class.dk/tirpitz/history/tiropertungsten.html] While the [[suicide attacks|suicide air attacks]] - the so-called [[kamikaze]] - struck many US battleships, none were seriously damaged due to their thick armor. The kamikaze were much more successful against lesser-armored ships.<ref>Axell, Albert: ''Kamikaze'', pp. 205-213</ref>

There were limits to the battleship's protection scheme, since it could not keep pace with the quicker developements in ordnance. For instance, the TDS in the ''[[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|South Dakota]]'' and ''[[Iowa class battleship|Iowa]]'' battleships were designed to absorb the energy from an underwater explosion equivalent to 700 pounds of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] &mdash; the Navy's best guess in the 1930s about Japanese weapons. But unbeknownst to U.S. Naval Intelligence, the Japanese 24-inch-diameter "[[Type 93 torpedo|Long Lance]]" torpedo, carried a charge equivalent to 891 pounds of TNT. And no amount of armour that could be practically incorporated would have saved the [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] from the massive 12,000 lb [[tallboy bomb]]s dropped by RAF Lancaster bombers during [[German battleship Tirpitz#Operations Paravane.2C Obviate and Catechism|Operation Catechism]].<ref>Tamelander, Michael: ''Slagskeppet Tirpitz''</ref><ref>Jacobsen, Alf R.: ''Dödligt angrepp''</ref>

====Coordination and Waves====
In a well-planned attack, fighter planes strafed the battleship to suppress the AA guns, dive bombers used their armour piercing bombs to cause topside damage and havoc. The fighters and dive bombers, however, were diversions in order to allow the torpedo planes to deliver their ordnance.

Battleships were able to sustain more punishment and had fewer vulnerable spots than cruisers and carriers, so it was difficult to rely upon scoring a critical hit (the cases of the Bismarck and Prince of Wales are considered exceptional). Instead, the way to defeat battleships was by attrition, inflicted accumulating damage, by overwhelming them with repeated waves of attacks. This is best demonstrated at the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]; at the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of the Sibuyan Sea|Sibuyan Sea]] where the super-dreadnought ''[[IJN Musashi|Musashi]]'' eventually succumbed to her damage, after being beset by waves of US carrier aircraft and with her being the primary focus of their attacks. The US planes would have accomplished less if they spread out to attack the rest of the ships in Kurita's powerful force. By contrast, the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Surigao Strait|October 24 air attack]] on Nishimura's southern pincer did little damage, even though both of his [[Fuso class battleship|battleships]] were slow WWI-era dreadnoughts and his force had far fewer screening ships, as he only faced a single wave from US carriers ''Franklin'' and ''Enterprise''. 

====Innovative Attacks====
The [[Axis Powers of World War II|Axis Powers]] implemented some unconventional methods. The Italians used with success their tested method of having [[frogmen]] delivering explosive charges to the ships, and managed to sink [[HMS Valiant (1914)|HMS ''Valiant'']] and [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] in the shallow waters of the harbor of [[Alexandria]], putting them out of action until 1942. Other more or less successful Italian methods included [[human torpedo|manned torpedoes]] and small [[MTM|motor assault boats]], which were filled with explosives, aimed at the target, sped up to full speed, while the pilot catapulted himself out from the dashing craft.<ref>Taylor, A. J. P.: ''1900-talet'', p. 139</ref>

The Germans developed a series of stand-off weapons, e.g. the [[precision-guided munition|guided bomb]] [[Fritz X]], which scored some early successes. On 9 September 1943, the Germans managed to sink the Italian battleship [[Italian battleship Roma (1940)|''Roma'']] and severely damage her sister ship, the [[Italian battleship Littorio|''Italia'']], while they were underway to surrender. The first one hit ''Roma'' amidship between 90 mm AA gun mounts, piercing deck and side, then exploded halving speed; the other one hit above deck between turret #2 and the conning tower. It caused an explosion that threw the turret outboard and affected the boilers, starting a major fire that detonated the main magazines. 1353 lives were lost; only 596 survivors, most badly burned, were rescued. Among those killed was the Italian Commander in Chief of Naval Battle Forces, [[Admiral Carlo Bergamini]]. One week later, the Germans scored another hit with a Fritz X on the British battleship [[HMS Warspite (1913)|''Warspite'']]. The bomb penetrated six decks before exploding against the bottom of the ship, blowing a large hole in her. The ship took in a total of 5,000 tonnes of water, lost steam (and thus all power, both to the ship herself and to all her systems), and had to be taken in tow. She reached Malta but was out of action for the next 12 months.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 190-191</ref> 

The British further developed their ability to sink battleships in harbour with minisubs and very heavy bombs dropped by strategic bombers. The last active German battleship, [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']], lurked until late into the war in Norwegian [[fjord]]s protected by [[anti-submarine weapon]]s and shore based anti-aircraft guns. She was severely damaged in September 1943 during [[Operation Source]], a daring covert attack by [[X class submarine|British mini-subs]]. After several air strikes, including [[Operation Tungsten]] which was made with carrier aircraft, ''Tirpitz'' was finally sunk in harbour by [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] heavy bombers carrying massive [[tallboy bomb]]s. During that action, codenamed [[German battleship Tirpitz#Operations Paravane.2C Obviate and Catechism|Operation Catechism]], two of the bombs had penetrated her armour, one holing her portside and the other starting a fire that eventually detonated her magazines and blew off her Caesar turret, causing her to capsize and killing 1000 of the 1700 men aboard.<ref>Tamelander, Michael: ''Slagskeppet Tirpitz''</ref><ref>Jacobsen, Alf R.: ''Dödligt angrepp''</ref>

==The Cold War==
[[Image:Atombombentest Crossroads-Baker.jpg|thumb|[[Operation Crossroads]] Event Baker explosion]]

After World War II, several navies retained battleships, but it became clear that they were not worth the considerable cost. During the War it had become clear that battleship-on-battleship engagements like Leyte Gulf or the sinking of the Hood were the exception and not the rule, and that engagement ranges were becoming longer and longer, making heavy gun armament irrelevant. The armor of a battleship was equally irrelevant in the face of a nuclear attack, and nuclear missiles with a range of 100&nbsp;kilometres or more could be mounted on the Soviet [[Kildin class destroyer|''Kildin'' class destroyer]] and [[Whiskey class submarine|''Whiskey'' class submarine]] by the end of the 1950s.
 
The remaining battleships met a variety of ends. [[USS Arkansas (BB-33)|USS ''Arkansas'']] and [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] were sunk during the testing of nuclear weapons in [[Operation Crossroads]] in 1946. Both battleships proved resistant to nuclear air burst but vulnerable to underwater nuclear explosions. The Italian [[Italian battleship Giulio Cesare|''Giulio Cesare'']] was taken by the Soviets as reparations and renamed ''Novorossiysk''; it was sunk by a German mine in the [[Black Sea]] on [[29 October]] [[1955]]. The two [[Andrea Doria class battleship|''Doria'' class]] ships were scrapped in the late 1950s. The French [[French battleship Lorraine|''Lorraine'']] was scrapped in 1954, [[French battleship Richelieu|''Richelieu'']] in 1964 and [[French battleship Jean Bart|''Jean Bart'']] in 1970. The United Kingdom's four surviving [[King George V class battleship (1939)|''King George V'' class]] ships were scrapped in 1957, and [[HMS Vanguard (1944)|''Vanguard'']] followed in 1960. All other surviving British battleships had been scrapped in the late 1940s. The Soviet Union's ''[[Battleship Petropavlovsk (1914)|Petropavlovsk]]'' was scrapped in 1953, [[Sevastopol (disambiguation)|''Sevastopol'']] in 1957 and [[Soviet battleship Gangut|''Gangut'']] in 1959. Brazil's ''Minas Gerais'' was scrapped in 1954, and her sister ship [[Brazilian battleship Sao Paulo|''São Paulo'']] sank en route to the breakers during a storm in 1951. [[Argentina]] kept its two [[Rivadavia class battleship|''Rivadavia'' class]] ships until 1956. Chile kept ''Almirante Latorre'' (formerly HMS ''Canada'') until 1959. The Turkish battlecruiser ''Yavuz'' (formerly the German [[SMS Goeben|''Goeben'']], launched in 1911) was scrapped in 1976 after an offer to sell it back to Germany was refused. Sweden had several small coastal defense battleships, one of which, ''[[HMS Gustav V|Gustav V]]'', survived until 1970. The Russians also scrapped four large incomplete cruisers in the late 1950s, whilst plans to build new battleships were abandoned following the death of Stalin in 1953. There were also several old ships of the line still used as housing ships or storage depots. Of these, all but HMS ''Victory'' were sunk or scrapped by 1957.

The ''Iowa'' class battleships gained a new lease of life in the U.S. Navy as fire support ships. Shipborne artillery support is considered by the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] as more accurate, more effective and less expensive than aerial strikes. [[Radar]] and computer controlled gunfire could be aimed with pinpoint accuracy to target. The United States recommissioned all four [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa'' class]] battleships for the [[Korean War]] and the [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']] for the [[Vietnam War]]. These were primarily used for shore bombardment, ''New Jersey'' firing seven times more rounds against shore targets in Vietnam than she had in the Second World War.<ref>History of World Seapower, Bernard Brett, ISBN 0-603-03723-2, p. 236</ref>

As part of [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[John F. Lehman]]'s effort to build a [[600-ship Navy]] in the 1980s, and in response to the commissioning of ''[[Soviet battlecruiser Kirov|Kirov]]'' by the Soviet Union the United States recommissioned all four ''Iowa'' class battleships. On several occasions, battleships were support ships in [[carrier battle group]]s, or led their own battle groups in a [[battleship battle group]]. These were modernized to carry [[Tomahawk missile]]s, with ''New Jersey'' seeing action bombarding [[Lebanon]] in 1983 and 1984, while [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']] and [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|''Wisconsin'']] fired their 16&nbsp;inch (406&nbsp;mm) guns at land targets and launched missiles in the [[Gulf War]] of 1991. ''Wisconsin'' served as the [[Tomahawk missile|TLAM]] strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of [[Operation Desert Storm]] and fired a total of 24 TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. This will most likely be the last combat action ever by a battleship. The primary threat to the battleships were Iraqi shore based surface-to-surface missiles; ''Missouri''  was targeted by two Iraqi [[Silkworm missile]]s, with one missing and another being intercepted by the British destroyer [[HMS Gloucester (D96)|HMS ''Gloucester'']].

All four ''Iowas'' were decommissioned in the early 1990s, making them the last battleships to see active service. USS ''Iowa'' and USS ''Wisconsin'' were, until fiscal year 2006, maintained in to a standard where they could be rapidly returned to service as fire support vessels, pending the development of a superior fire support vessel. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/bb-61.htm|title= Iowa Class Battleship|accessdate=2007-03-18 |publisher = Federation of American Scientists|format= |work= }}</ref> The U.S. Marine Corps believes that the current naval surface fire support gun and missile programs will not be able to provide adequate fire support for an amphibious assault or onshore operations.<ref>The USMC has revised its Naval Surface Gunfire Support requirements, leaving some questions as to whether or not the [[Zumwalt class destroyer]] can meet the Marine qualifications</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fas.org/man/gao/gao95160.htm|title= Naval Surface Fires Support|author = United States General Accounting Office|accessdate=2007-03-18 |publisher = Federation of American Scientists|format= |work= }}</ref>

==Today==
[[Image:Battleship Mikasa.jpg|thumb|300px|The Japanese [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']] is the only preserved pre-Dreadnought battleship]]

With the decommissioning of the last ''Iowa''s, no battleships remain in service (including in reserve) with any navy worldwide. A number are preserved as museum ships, either afloat or in dry-dock. The USA has a large number of battleships on display. [[USS Massachusetts (BB-59)|USS ''Massachusetts'']], [[USS North Carolina (BB-55)|''North Carolina'']], [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|''Alabama'']], [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']], [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|''Wisconsin'']], [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']],and [[USS Texas (BB-35)|''Texas'']]. ''Missouri'', and ''New Jersey'' are now museums at [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden, N.J.]] respectively. ''Wisconsin'' is a museum (at [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk, Va.]]), and was recently removed from the [[Naval Vessel Register]]. However, pending donation, the public can still only tour the deck, since the rest of the ship is closed off for dehumidification. The only other true battleship on display is the Japanese pre-Dreadnought [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']]. A number of ironclads and ships-of-the-line are also preserved, including [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], [[HMS Warrior (1860)|''Warrior'']], the Swedish [[Regalskeppet Vasa|''Vasa'']], the Dutch [[HNLMS Buffel|''Buffel'']] and [[HNLMS Schorpioen|''Schorpioen'']], and the Chilean war trophy, [[Huáscar (ship)|''Huáscar'']]. The earliest ancestor of the battleship still on display is the sixteenth-century English war vessel ''[[Mary Rose]]''.

==Battleships in strategy and doctrine==<!-- This section is linked from [[Pennsylvania class battleship]] -->
===Doctrine===
Battleships were the embodiment of [[sea power]]. For [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] and his followers, a strong navy was vital to the success of a nation, and control of the seas was vital for the projection of force on land and overseas. Mahan's theory dictated that the role of the battleship was to sweep the enemy from the seas.<ref>Massie, Robert K. ''Castles of Steel'', London, 2005. ISBN 1-844-134113</ref> The presence of battleships would make it impossible for the enemy to transport goods or armies, or to interfere with friendly trade and troop movements. While the work of escorting, blockading and raiding might be done by [[cruiser]]s or smaller vessels, the presence of the battleship threatened any enemy cruisers which might seek an engagement with greatly superior force.

This school of thought was highly influential in naval and political circles throughout the age of the battleship,<ref>Kennedy, op. cit., p2, p200, p206 et al.</ref><ref name="Sondhaus"/> and it called for a large fleet of the most powerful battleships possible. Mahan's work developed in the late 1880s and by the end of the 1890s it had a massive international impact.<ref name = "Sondhaus"/> The strength of Mahanian opinion was important in the development of the battleships arms races, and equally important in the agreement of the Powers to limit battleship numbers in the interwar era.

A related concept was that of a '[[fleet in being]]': the idea that a fleet of battleships, simply by its presence, could tie down superior enemy resources and, even without a decisive battle, tip the balance of a conflict. This suggested that even for inferior naval powers a battleship fleet could have important strategic impact.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/fleet-in-being.htm "Fleet In Being", Globalsecurity.org, retrieved 18 March 2007]</ref>

===Tactics===
While the role of battleships in both World Wars reflected Mahanian doctrine, the details of battleship deployment were more complex. Unlike the [[ship-of-the-line]], the battleships of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had significant vulnerability to torpedoes and mines, weapons which could be used by relatively small and inexpensive craft. The [[Jeune Ecole]] school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s recommended the placing of [[torpedo boat]]s alongside battleships; the boats would hide behind the battleships until gun-smoke obscured visibility enough for them to dart out and fire their torpedoes.<ref name = "Sondhaus" /> While this concept was vitiated by the development of smokeless propellant, the threat from more capable torpedo craft remained. By the 1890s the Royal Navy had developed the first [[destroyer]]s, small ships designed to intercept and drive off any attacking torpedo boats. During the First World War and subsequently, battleships were rarely deployed without a protective screen of destroyers.

Battleship doctrine emphasised the concentration of the battlefleet. In order for this concentrated force to be able to bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, [[airships]], submarines and aircraft were all used. So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.

===Strategic and diplomatic impact===
The presence of battleships had a great psychological and diplomatic impact. Similar to possessing [[nuclear weapons]] today, the ownership of battleships made a country count for something.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/>

Even during the Cold War, the psychological impact of a battleship was significant. In 1946, USS ''Missouri'' was dispatched to deliver the remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and Greek waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the Balkan region.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/missouri-iv.htm|title= USS Missouri|accessdate=2007-03-18 |publisher= Naval Historical Centre|format= |work= Directory of American Fighting Ships}}</ref> In September 1983, when [[Druze]] militia in [[Lebanon]]'s Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS ''New Jersey'' stopped the firing. Gunfire from ''New Jersey'' later killed militia leaders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/battleships/newjersey/bb62-nj.html |title= USS New Jersey|accessdate=2007-03-18 |format= |work= Directory of American Fighting Ships}}</ref>

===Value for money===
Battleships were the largest and most complex, and hence the most expensive warships of their time; as a result, the value of investment in battleships has always been contested. As the French politician Etienne Lamy wrote in 1879, ''The construction of battleships is so costly, their effectiveness so uncertain and of such short duration, that the enterprise of creating an armored fleet seems to leave fruitless the perseverance of a people''.<ref>Quoted in[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JIW/is_4_58/ai_n15927771/pg_5 Net-Centric before its time: The Jeune École and Its Lessons for Today] Erik J. Dahl US Naval War College Review, Autumn 2005, Vol. 58, No. 4</ref> The [[Jeune Ecole]] school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s sought alternatives to the crippling expense and debatable utility of a conventional battlefleet, proposing what would nowadays be termed a [[sea denial]] strategy, based on fast, long-ranged cruisers for commerce raiding and torpedo boat flotillas to attack enemy ships attempting to blockade French ports. In many respects the ideas of the ''Jeune Ecole'' were ahead of their time; it was not until the twentieth century that efficient mines, torpedoes, submarines and aircraft were available allowing similar ideas to be implemented with much more potent effect.<ref>Dahl, ''op cit.''</ref> 

The determination of powers such as [[Imperial Germany]] to build battlefleets with which to confront much stronger rivals has been criticised by historians, who emphasise the futility of investment in a battlefleet which has no chance of matching its opponent in an actual battle.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/> According to this view, attempts by a weaker navy to compete head-to-head with a stronger one in battleship construction simply wasted resources which could have been better invested in attacking the enemy's points of weakness. In Germany's case, the British dependence on massive imports of food and raw materials proved to be a near-fatal weakness, once Germany had accepted the political risk of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] against commercial shipping. Although the U-boat offensive in 1917-18 was ultimately defeated, it was successful in causing huge material loss and forcing the Allies to divert vast resources into [[Anti-submarine warfare|Anti-submarine Warfare]]. This success, though not ultimately decisive, was nevertheless in sharp contrast to the inability of the German battlefleet to challenge the supremacy of Britain's far stronger fleet.

The problem for a maritime nation that does not maintain a balanced fleet, with at least some ability to contest a set-piece battle, is that it surrenders the use the sea for its own purposes, whether economic or military; and, in addition, lacks the ability to interdict enemy shipping movements which are protected by a sufficient escort. Such a strategy exposes the nation to blockade or even, in the worst case, invasion. In addition, while a navy optimised for sea denial operations may maximise its potential against a stronger opponent, it will be at a disadvantage against nations of similar strength of its own, but which have invested their resources in a more conventional fleet. For this reason, maritime nations which are unable to compete with the dominant naval power have usually sought to achieve an accommodation with that power, thereby allowing them to resource a balanced fleet with which to deal with their more direct rivals. Examples of this strategy are the French [[Entente cordiale|''entente'']] with Britain in the decade preceding the First World War; and the British withdrawal in 1921 from its [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|alliance with Japan]], in order to avoid a confrontation with the much more powerful USA.
