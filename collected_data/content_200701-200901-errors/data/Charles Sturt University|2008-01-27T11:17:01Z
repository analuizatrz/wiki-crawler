'''Charles Sturt University''' ('''CSU''') is an [[Australia]]n multi-campus [[university]] in [[New South Wales]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. It has campuses at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury-Wodonga]], [[Dubbo, New South Wales|Dubbo]], [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] and [[Wagga Wagga]]. It also has specialist centres in [[Canberra]], [[Manly]] (Sydney), [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] and [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]]. It is the only state institution delivering higher education in "western NSW" (the part of New South Wales west of the [[Blue Mountains]]), and is the only university with campuses in that area.

CSU courses are also delivered by various [[Technical and Further Education|TAFEs]] (members of [[TAFE NSW]] and [[Holmesglen Institute of TAFE]] in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]]); and private institution ''Study Group'''s [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]] and [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] campuses (known as ''CSU Study Centres''). CSU also offers teacher training courses at a campus in Ontario, Canada.

CSU is well known for its extensive range of [[distance education]] courses, being a leader in the field and claims to be one of Australia's largest providers of distance education.

== History ==

[[Image:CD Blake Auditorium.jpg|thumb|left|CD Blake Auditorium, Bathurst campus, CSU]]
The University was established on [[1 July]] [[1989]] from the merger of several existing separately-administered [[College of Advanced Education|Colleges of Advanced Education]] including the Mitchell College of Advanced Education in Bathurst, the Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education in Albury-Wodonga and the Riverina College of Advanced Education in Wagga Wagga,<ref name="Morris">{{cite book | author=Morris, Sherry | title= Wagga Wagga, a history| publisher=Bobby Graham Publishers, Wagga Wagga| year=1999| id=ISBN 1-875247-12-2}}</ref> through the enactment of The Charles Sturt University Act, 1989 (Act No. 76, 1989). It is named in honour of explorer [[Charles Sturt]].

The Mitchell College of Advanced Education had been formed on [[1 January]] [[1971]], and the Riverina-Murray Institute in Wagga Wagga and Albury-Wodonga had operated since 1985. The latter institution had earlier succeeded the Riverina College of Advanced Education, which was itself the result of an even earlier merger between Wagga Agricultural College and Wagga Teachers College. 

In late 2004, CSU formalised moves to assume control of the [[University of Sydney]]'s [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] campus, which came into force on [[1 January]] [[2005]]. From that date, all new Orange campus students were eligible to qualify for degrees from CSU; continuing students continued to be awarded their degrees from Sydney.

Initially, CSU was one of a handful of Australian universities not to increase tuition fees by 25%, one of the reforms introduced by federal education minister [[Brendan Nelson]] in 2004, but it later voted to increase fees by the full 25% allowable starting from 2006.
