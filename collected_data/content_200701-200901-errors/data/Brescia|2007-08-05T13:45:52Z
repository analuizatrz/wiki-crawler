'''Brescia''' ([[Eastern_Lombard|Lombard]]: ''Brèsa'') is a city in the region of [[Lombardy]] in northern [[Italy]]. It is situated at the foot of the [[Alps]], between the Mella and the Naviglio, with a population of around 190,000. It is the second largest city in [[Lombardy]], after the capital, [[Milan]].

The city is the administrative capital of the [[Province of Brescia]], one of the largest in Italy, with about 1,200,000 inhabitants. The ancient city of [[Brixia]], Brescia has been an important regional centre since pre-Roman times and a number of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[medieval]] monuments are preserved, among which is the prominent castle. 
[[Image:Brescia city skyline from the city castle.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Sight of Brescia from the city castle.]]
The city is at the centre of the third-largest Italian industrial area, concentrating on mechanical and automotive [[engineering]] and machine tools. Its companies are typically small or medium- sized enterprises, often with family managements. The financial sector is also a major employer, and the tourist trade benefits from the proximity of [[Lake Garda]], [[Lake Iseo]]  and the Alps.

The plan of the city is rectangular, and the streets intersect at right angles, a peculiarity handed down from Roman times, though the area enclosed by the medieval walls is larger than that of the Roman town, which occupied the eastern portion of the present one. The Piazza del Museo marks the site of the forum, and the museum on its north side is ensconced in a Corinthian temple with three ''cellae'', by some attributed to Hercules, but more probably the Capitolium of the city, erected by [[Vespasian]] in AD 73 (if the inscription really belongs to the building<ref>cf. Th. Mommsen in ''Corp. Inscrip. Lat.'' v. No. 4312, Berlin, 1872</ref>, which was excavated in 1823. The museum houses a famous bronze statue of Victory, found in 1826. Scanty remains of a building on the south side of the forum, called the curia, but which may have been a basilica, and of the theatre, east of the temple, still exist.

==History==
===Ancient history===
Different mythological versions of the foundation of Brescia exist: one assigns it to [[Hercules]], while another attributes it to ''Altilia'' ("the other Ilium") by a fugitive from the siege of [[Troy]]. According to a further one, the founder was the king of the [[Ligures]] Cidnus, who had invaded the [[Po River|Padan Plain]] in the late [[Bronze Age]]. Other scholars attribute the foundation to the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]s.

Invaded by the [[Gauls]] [[Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)|Cenomani]], allied of the [[Insubres|Insubri]], in the [[4th century BC]]E, it became their capital; the city bcame Roman in 225 B.C., when the Cenomani submitted to Rome. During the [[Carthaginian Wars]] '''''Brixia''''' was usually allied of the Romans: in [[202 BC]]E it was part of a Celt confederation against them, but, after a secret agreement, changed side and attacked by surprise the Insubri, destroying them. Subsequently the city and the tribe entered peacefully in the Roman world as a faithful allied, maintaining a certain administrative freedom. In [[89 BC]]E it was recognized as ''civitas'' ("city") and in [[41 BC]]E received the Roman citizenship.  [[Augustus]] founded a civil (not a military) colony here in 27 B.C., and he and Tiberius constructed an aqueduct to supply it.  The Roman Brixia had at least three temples, an aqueduct, an [[amphitheater]], a forum with a further temple built under [[Vespasianus]], and some baths.

When [[Constantine I|Constantine]] advanced against [[Maxentius]] in [[312]], an engagement took place at Brescia in which the enemy was forced to retreat as far as [[Verona]]. In [[402]] the city was ravaged by the [[Visigoths]] of [[Alaric I]]. During the invasion of the [[Huns]] under [[Attila]], the city was again besieged and sacked ([[452]]) while, some forty years later, it was one of the first conquests of the Goth general [[Theoderic the Great]] in his war against [[Odovacer]].

===Medieval history===
In [[568]] or [[569]] Brescia was occupied by the [[Lombards]], who made it the capital of one of their semi-independent duchies. First duke was one Alachis, who died in [[573]]. Later dukes included the future king [[Rotharis]] and [[Rodoald]], and Alachis II, a fervent anti-Catholic who was killed in the batte of [[Cornate d'Adda]] ([[688]]). The last king of the Lombard, [[Desiderius]], had been also duke of Brescia. In [[774]] [[Charlemagne]] captured the city and ended the existence of the Lombard kingdom in northern Italy. 

Notingus was the first (prince-)bishop (in [[844]]) who bore the title of [[Count]] (see [[Bishopric of Brescia]]). Later the power of the bishop as imperial representative was gradually defied by the local citizens and nobles, Brescia becoming a free commune around the early 12th century. Subsequently it expanded in the nearby countryside, first at the expenses of the local landholders, and later against the neighbouring communes, notably [[Bergamo]] and [[Cremona]]. Brescia defeated the latter two times at [[Pontoglio]], and then at the Grumore (mid-12th century) and in the battle of the Malamorte ([[1192]]).
 
In the successive struggles between the Lombard cities and the emperors, Brescia was implicated in some of the leagues and in all of the uprisings against them. In the [[Battle of Legnano]] the contingent from Brescia was the second in size after that of [[Milan]]. The [[Peace of Constance]] ([[1183]]) that ended the war with [[Frederick Barbarossa]] confirmed officially the free status of the commune. Memorable is also the [[siege of Brescia|siege]] laid to Brescia by the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in [[1238]] on account of the part taken by this city in the [[battle of Cortenova]] ([[27 November]], [[1237]]). Brescia came through this assault victorious. After the fall of the [[Hohenstaufen]], republican institutions declined at Brescia as in the other free cities and the leadership was contested between powerful families, chief among them the Maggi and the Brusati, the latter of the (pro-imperial, anti-papal) [[Ghibelline]] party.  In 1258 it fell into the hands of Eccelino of Verona.

In [[1311]] [[Emperor Henry VII]] laid siege to Brescia for six months, losing three-fourths of his army. Later the [[Scaliger]] of Verona, aided by the exiled Ghibellines, sought to place Brescia under subjection. The citizens of Brescia then recoursed to [[John I of Bohemia|John of Luxemburg]], but [[Mastino II della Scala]] expelled the governor appointed by him. His mastery was soon contested by the Visconti of Milan, but not even their rule was undisputed, as [[Pandolfo Malatesta]] in [[1406]] took possession of the city, but in [[1416]] bartered it to [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], who in [[1426]] sold it to the Venetians. The Milanese nobles forced Filippo to resume hostilities against the Venetians, and thus to attempt the recovery of this city, but he was defeated in the [[battle of Maclodio]] ([[1427]]), near Brescia. In [[1439]] Brescia was once more besieged by [[Francesco Sforza]], captain of the Venetians, who defeated [[Niccolò Piccinino]], Filippo's [[condottiero]]. Thenceforward Brescia acknowledged the authority of Venice, with the exception of the years between [[1512]] and [[1520]], when it was occupied by the French armies under [[Gaston de Foix]]. Early in the 16th century it was one of the wealthiest cities of Lombardy, but has never recovered from its sack by the French.  It subsequently shared the fortunes of the Venetian republic until [[1796]], when it came under Austrian dominion.

===Modern history===
{{sect-stub}}
After the end of the [[Napoleon]]ic era, Brescia was annexed to the Austrian puppet state called [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]. Brescia revolted in 1848. It distinguished again for the revolt called the [[Ten Days of Brescia]] (march 1849), for which the poet [[Giosuè Carducci]] called it "Leonessa d'Italia" ("Italian Lionesse"), being the only Lombard town to rally to Charles Albert in the latter year; but was taken after ten days' obstinate street fighting by the Austrians under Haynau.

In 1769 the city was devastated when the Church of San Nazaro was struck by [[lightning]].  The resulting fire ignited 200,000 lb (90,000 kg) of [[gunpowder]] being stored there, causing a massive explosion which destroyed one sixth of the city and killed 3,000 people.  

Brescia was annexed to Italy in 1859.

The city was awarded a Gold Medal for its resistance against Fascism, in the late [[World War II]]. 

On [[May 28]], [[1974]], it was the seat of the bloody [[Piazza della Loggia bombing]].

==Main sights==
*''Piazza della Loggia'', a noteworthy example of [[Renaissance]] ''piazza'', with the omonymous [[loggia]] (the current Town Hall) built in 1492 by the architect Filippino de' Grassi. On [[May 28]] [[1974]] the square was the location of a [[Piazza della Loggia bombing|terrorist bombing]].
*''Duomo Vecchio'' ("Old Cathedral"), also known as ''La Rotonda''. It is an exteriorly rusticated [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church, striking for its circular shape. The main structure was built in the 11th century on the ruins of an earlier basilica. Near the entrance is the pink Veronese marble sarcophagus of Berardo Maggi, while in the presbitery is the entrance to the crypt of San Filastrio. The structure houses paintings of the ''Assumption'', the ''Evangelists Luke and Mark'', and ''Feast of the Paschal Lamb'' , and ''Eli and the Angel'' by Alessandro Bonvicino (known as ''il Moretto''); two canvasses by [[Girolamo Romanino]], and other paintings by [[Palma il Giovane]], [[Francesco Maffei]], Bonvicino, and others<ref>[http://www.bresciainvetrina.it/bresciaarte/duomovecchio.htm#top| Duomo Vecchio]</ref>.
*''Duomo Nuovo'' ("New Cathedral"): Construction on the new cathedral began in 1604 and continued till 1825. While initially a contract was awarded to [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]], economic shortfalls awarded the project, still completed in a Palladian style, to the young Brescian architect [[Giovanni Battista Lantana]], with decorative projects were directed mainly by [[Pietro Maria Bagnadore]]. The facade is mainly owed to the designs [[Giovanni Battista Marchetti|Giovanni Battista]] and [[Antonio Marchetti]], while the cupola was designed by [[Luigi Cagnola]]. Interior frescoes including the ''Marriage, Visitation, and Birth of the Virgin'', as well as the ''Sacrifice of Isaac'', were frescoed by Alessandro Bonvicino|Bonvicino]]. The main attractions is the ''Arch of Sts. Apollonius and [[Filastrius]]'' (1510)<ref>[http://www.bresciainvetrina.it/bresciaarte/duomonuovo.htm| Duomo Nuovo.]</ref>.
*The ''Broletto'', formerly the Town Hall. It is a massive building of the 12th and 13th centuries with a lofty tower.
*In Piazza del Foro is the most important array of Roman remains in Lombardy. These include the Capitoline Temple, built by Vespasianus in 73 AD.
*The ''[[Basilica of San Salvatore|monastery of San Salvatore]]'' (os ''Santa Giulia''), dating from the Lombard age but later renovated several times. It is one of the best example of High Middle Ages architecture in northern Italy. 
*''[[Santa Maria dei Miracoli]]'' (1488-1523), with a fine façade by [[Giovanni Antonio Amadeo]], decorated with bas-reliefs and a Renaissance ''[[peristilium]]''.
*The Romanesque-Gothic church of St. Francis, with a Gothic façade and cloisters.
*The castle, at the north-east angle of the town, commands a fine view. 
*Church of ''San Nazario e Celso'', with the ''[[Averoldi Polyptych]]'' by [[Titian]].
*Church of ''San Clemente'', with numerous painting by [[Alessandro Bonvicino]] (generally known as Moretto).
*Church of ''San Giovanni'', with a refectory partly painted by the Moretto and partly by [[Girolamo Romanino]].
*The [[Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo]], the local art gallery hosts works of the painters of the classical Brescian school, [[Girolamo Romanino|Romanino]], [[Alessandro Bonvicino|Bonvicino]], and Bonvicino's pupil, [[Giovanni Battista Moroni]]. 
*Biblioteca Queriniana, containing rare early manuscripts, including a 14th-century manuscript of [[Dante]], and some rare [[incunabula]]. 

The city has no less than seventy-two public fountains.  The stone quarries of [[Mazzano]], 20 km east of Brescia, supplied marble for the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II]] in Rome.
