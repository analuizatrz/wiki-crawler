==Pre-history==

Human settlement in what is now [[Estonia]] became possible when the ice from the last [[ice age|glacial era]] melted away 11,000–13,000 years ago. The oldest known human settlement in Estonia is located by the [[Pärnu|Pärnu River]], near the village of Pulli. It has been dated to the beginning of the 9th millennium BC. Previously known hunting and fishing communities from around 6500 BC once lived near the town of [[Kunda]]. Bone and stone artefacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia, as well as in [[Latvia]], northern [[Lithuania]] and southern [[Finland]]. The Kunda culture group belongs to the middle [[stone age]], or [[Mesolithic period]] (in Estonia from the beginning of the 9th millennium to the 5th millennium BC). 

[[Estonian language|Estonian]] is a [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric language]] and belongs to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family. The modern language that is most closely related to Estonian is [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. Both Finnish and Estonian are [[Finnic]] languages, which comprises one branch of the larger [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric language]] family.

The origins of the Estonian and Finnish peoples and their languages are a matter of some controversy. In the 19th century the Finnish researcher [[Matthias Castren|Castrén]] prevailed with the theory that "their original home" was in west-central [[Siberia]]. Later, a theory of an ancient homeland of all Finno-Ugric peoples situated in the [[Volga]] and [[Kama]] rivers region within the European part of Russia appeared more credible. Until the 1970s most linguists believed Estonians to have arrived in Estonia as late as the first few centuries AD. In the 1980s these ideas drastically changed. The old theory was challenged by another postulating a wide-ranged "homeland" between the Volga river and Scandinavia. In light of new archaeological findings, it was concluded that the ancestors of Estonians and Finns arrived at their present territory many thousands of years ago, perhaps in many successive waves of immigration.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

Estonians are claimed by some to be one of the longest settled European peoples, whose ancestors may have corresponded to the [[Comb Ceramic Culture]] people, who lived on the southeastern shores of the [[Baltic Sea]] over 5,000 years ago. However, it is quite probable that the ancestors of present-day Estonians had lived there for 10,000, or even more, years.  Like other early agricultural societies, the ancient people of Estonia are believed to have been organized into economically self-sufficient, male-dominated clans with few differences in wealth or social power. By the early [[Middle Ages]] most Estonians were small landholders, with farmsteads primarily organised by village. The government remained decentralized, with local political and administrative subdivisions emerging only around the 1st century AD. By then, Estonia had a population of over 150,000 people. 

The name "Estonia" (in modern Estonian: ''Eesti'') could be derived from the word "[[Aesti|Aestii]]", the name given by the ancient [[Germanic people]] to the peoples living northeast of the [[Vistula River]]. The Roman historian [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] in [[98]] A.D. was the first to mention the "Aestii" people, and early [[Scandinavians]] called the land south of the [[Gulf of Finland]] ''Eistland'', and the people ''eistr''.

==The Middle Ages==
[[Image:Danmarks flag 1219 Lorentzen.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] falling from the sky during the [[Battle of Lyndanisse]], [[1219]].]]

Estonia remained one of the last corners of medieval Europe to be [[Christianity|Christianized]]. In 1193 [[Pope Celestine III]] called for a crusade against [[paganism|pagan]]s in [[Northern Europe]]. [[Northern Crusades]] from Northern [[Germany]] established the stronghold of [[Riga]] (in modern Latvia). With the help of the newly converted local tribes of [[Livonian people|Livs]] and [[Latvians|Letts]], the crusaders initiated raids into part of what is present-day Estonia in 1208. Estonian tribes fiercely resisted the attacks from Riga and occasionally themselves sacked territories controlled by the crusaders. In 1217 the German crusading order the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Sword Brethren]] and their recently converted allies, won a major battle in which the Estonian commander [[Lembitu of Lehola|Lembitu]] was killed.  The period of the several Northern Crusade battles in Estonia between [[1208]] and [[1227]] is also known as the period of Estonian ancient fight for independence. 

===Danish Estonia===
{{main|Danish Estonia}}
Northern Estonia was conquered by [[Denmark|Danish]] crusaders led by king [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Waldemar II]], who arrived in [[1219]] on the site of [[Tallinn]] ([[Battle of Lyndanisse]]). 

In 1227 the Sword Brethren conquered the last indigenous stronghold in the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]]. After the conquest, all remaining local pagans of Estonia were ostensibly [[Christianity|Christianized]]. 

[[Image:Confederation of Livonia 1260.svg|left|400px|thumb|[[Livonia]] in [[1260]].]]

The territory was then divided between the [[Livonian Order|Livonian branch]] of the [[Teutonic Order]], the [[Bishopric of Dorpat]] (in Estonian: ''Tartu piiskopkond'') and the [[Bishopric of Oesel-Wiek]] (in Estonian: ''Saare-Lääne piiskopkond''). The Northern part of Estonia - more exactly Harjumaa and Virumaa districts (in German: Harrien und Wierland) - was a nominal possession of [[Denmark]] until 1346. [[Tallinn]] (Reval) was given the [[Lübeck law|Lübeck Rights]] in 1248 and joined the [[Hanseatic League]] at the end of the 13th century. In [[1343]] the people of northern Estonia and Saaremaa (Oesel) Island started a rebellion ([[St. George's Night Uprising]]) against the rule of their German-speaking landlords. The uprising was put down, and [[Vesse]], the rebel King of Saaremaa, was hanged in 1344. 

[[Image:Carta Marina.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|[[Carta marina]] of [[Baltic Sea]], [[1539]].]]

Despite local rebellions and [[Muscovy|Muscovian]] invasions in 1481 and 1558, the local [[Low German]]-speaking [[Baltic Germans|upper class]] continued to rule Estonia and from 1524 preserved Estonian commitment to the [[Protestant Reformation]].

==Swedish period==
Northern Estonia submitted to [[Sweden|Swedish]] control in 1561 during the [[Livonian War]], and during 1582–83 southern Estonia ([[Livonia]]) became part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. In 1625, mainland Estonia came entirely under Swedish rule. In 1631, [[Gustavus Adolphus|Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden]] allowed the [[nobility]] to grant the peasantry greater [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]], and in 1632 established a [[printing press]] and [[University of Tartu|University]] in the city of [[Tartu]].

==Part of Imperial Russia==
Sweden's defeat by Russia in the [[Great Northern War]] in 1721 resulted in the [[Treaty of Nystad]], and Russian rule was then imposed on what later became modern Estonia. Nonetheless, the legal system, [[Lutheran]] church, local and town governments, and education remained mostly German until the late 19th century and partially until 1918.

By 1819, the [[Baltic provinces]] were the first in the Russian empire in which serfdom was abolished, the largely autonomous nobility allowing the peasants to own their own land or move to the cities. These moves created the economic foundation for the coming to life of the local national identity and culture as Estonia was caught in a current of national awakening that began sweeping through Europe in the mid-1800s.

A cultural movement sprang forth to adopt the use of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as the language of instruction in schools, all-Estonian song festivals were held regularly after 1869, and a national literature in Estonian developed. "[[Kalevipoeg]]", Estonia's epic national epic, was published in 1861 in both Estonian and German.

1889 marked the beginning of the central government-sponsored policy of [[Russification]]. The impact of this was that many of the [[Baltic German]] legal institutions were either abolished or had to do their work in Russian - a good example of this is the [[University of Tartu]].

As the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] swept through Estonia, the Estonians called for [[freedom of the press]] and [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]], for universal [[suffrage|franchise]], and for national autonomy. Estonian gains were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood.

With the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] in [[World War I]], [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Russia's Provisional Government]] granted national autonomy to Estonia in April. A popularly elected assembly (''[[Maapäev]]'') was formed but was quickly forced underground by the [[Bolshevik]]s. The Committee of Elders of the underground Maapäev proclaimed the Republic of Estonia on [[February 24]], [[1918]], one day before German troops invaded. After the collapse of the short-lived [[United Baltic Duchy]] and the withdrawal of German troops in November 1918, an Estonian provisional Government retook office. A military invasion by Soviet Russia followed a few days later, however, marking the beginning of the [[Estonian War of Independence]] (1918-1920). The Estonian army cleared the entire territory of Estonia of Soviet troops by February 1919. On [[February 2]], [[1920]], the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]] was signed by the Republic of Estonia and [[Bolshevist Russia]]. The terms of the treaty stated that Russia renounced in perpetuity all rights to the territory of Estonia. The Republic of Estonia obtained international recognition and became a member of the [[League of Nations]] in 1921.

==Independence==
The first period of independence lasted 22 years, beginning in 1918. Estonia underwent a number of economic, social, and political reforms necessary to come to terms with its new status as a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[state]]. Economically and socially, land reform in 1919 was the most important step. Large estate holdings belonging to the [[Baltic nobility]] were redistributed among the peasants and especially among volunteers in the [[Estonian War of Independence]].  Estonia's principal markets became [[Scandinavia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and western Europe, with some exports to the [[United States]] and to the [[Soviet Union]].

The first constitution of the Republic of Estonia, adopted in 1920, established a [[parliamentary]] form of government.  The parliament (''[[Riigikogu]]'') consisted of 100 members elected for 3-year terms. Between 1921 and 1931, Estonia had 11 governments. Political parties were banned and the parliament was not in session between 1934 and 1938 as the country was [[rule by decree|ruled by decree]] by [[Konstantin Päts]], who was eventually elected as the first President of the Republic in 1938.                  

The independence period was one of great cultural advancement. Estonian language schools were established, and artistic life of all kinds flourished. One of the more notable cultural acts of the independence period, unique in western Europe at the time of its passage in 1925, was a guarantee of cultural autonomy to [[minority group]]s comprising at least 3,000 persons, including [[Jew]]s (see [[history of the Jews in Estonia]]). Historians see the lack of any bloodshed after a nearly "700-year German rule" as indication that it must have been mild by comparison.

Estonia had pursued a policy of neutrality, but it was of no consequence after the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] signed the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] on [[August 23]], [[1939]] in which the two great powers agreed to divide up the countries situated between them ([[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], Estonia, and [[Finland]]) with Estonia falling in the Soviet "sphere of influence". After the invasion of Poland [[Orzeł incident]] took place when Polish submarine [[ORP Orzeł]] looked for shelter in [[Tallinn]] but escaped after [[Soviet Union]] attacked Poland on [[September 17]]. Estonian's lack of will and/or incapability to disarm and intern the crew caused Soviet Union to accuse Estonia of "helping them escape" and claim that Estonia was not neutral. On [[September 24]], [[1939]], the Soviet Union threatened Estonia with war unless provided with military bases in the country –- an ultimatum with which the Estonian government complied.

==Period of Soviet and German occupation==
===Creation of Estonian SSR===
On [[June 16]]-17, [[1940]], the Soviet troops occupied the whole territory of Estonia and demanded a change to a new pro-Soviet puppet government. Similarly to the developments in neighboring Latvia and Lithuania, the [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|occupation]] and change of government was then in the three countries followed by "parliamentary elections" where all but pro-Communist candidates were outlawed. The "parliament" so elected proclaimed Estonia a Socialist Republic on [[July 21]], [[1940]] and unanimously requested Estonia to be "accepted" into the [[Soviet Union]]. Estonia was formally annexed into the Soviet Union on [[August 6]] and renamed the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]].<ref>Magnus Ilmjärv ''Hääletu alistumine'', (''Silent Submission''), Tallinn, Argo, 2004, ISBN 9949-415-04-7</ref>  The 1940 occupation and annexation of Estonia into the Soviet Union was [[Stimson Doctrine|considered illegal and never officially recognized]] by Great Britain, the [[United States]] and other Western democracies.

The Soviet authorities, having gained control over Estonia, immediately imposed a regime of terror. During the first year of Soviet occupation (1940-1941) over 8,000 people, including most of the country's leading politicians and military officers, were arrested. About 2,200 of the arrested were executed in Estonia, while most others were moved to prison camps in Russia, from where very few were later able to return alive. On [[June 14]], [[1941]], when mass [[deportation]]s took place simultaneously in all three Baltic countries, about 10,000 Estonian civilians were deported to [[Siberia]] and other remote areas of the Soviet Union, where nearly half of them later perished. Of the 32,100 Estonian men who were forcibly relocated to Russia under the pretext of mobilisation into the Soviet army after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, nearly 40 percent died within the next year in the so-called "[[labour battalion]]s" through hunger, cold and overworking. During the first Soviet occupation of 1940-41 about 500 Jews were deported to [[Siberia]]

===German Occupation===
After [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the [[Soviet Union]] on [[June 22]], [[1941]], and the Wehrmacht reached Estonia in July 1941, most Estonians greeted the Germans with relatively open arms and hoped to restore independence. But it soon became clear that sovereignty was out of the question. Estonia became a part of the German-occupied "[[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]]". A [[Sicherheitspolizei]] was established for internal security under the leadership of [[Ain-Ervin Mere]].

Estonia had a relatively small [[History of the Jews in Estonia|Jewish]] population of 4,500 people before the war. Round-ups and killings of Jews began immediately following the arrival of the first German troops in 1941, who were closely followed by the extermination squad ''[[Einsatzkommando]]'' (''[[Sonderkommando]]'') 1A, part of [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe A]]. Arrests and executions continued as the Germans, with the assistance of local collaborators, advanced through Estonia. About 50 percent of Estonia's Jewish community, aware of the fate that otherwise awaited them, managed to escape to the Soviet Union; virtually all the remainder (between 950 and 1,000 men, women and children) were killed before the end of 1941. Fewer than a dozen Estonian Jews are known to have survived the war in Estonia. The Nazi regime also established 22 [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration and labor camps]] in Estonia for foreign Jews, the largest, [[Vaivara]], had 20,000 Jewish prisoners pass through its gates, and several thousand foreign Jews were killed at the [[Kalevi Liiva]] camp.

Despite the German refusal to recognize Estonia's sovereignty, many Estonians heeded the call to fight the Soviets, especially in 1944 when, with the Allied victory over Germany becoming certain, the only option to save Estonia's independence was to stave off a new Soviet invasion of Estonia until Germany's capitulation. The initial formation of a volunteer SS Estonian [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Legion legion] was eventually to become in 1944 a full-sized [[Waffen SS]] volunteer division, the [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)]]. The Estonian units saw action defending the [[Battle of Narva (1944)|Narva line]] throughout 1944. 

As the Germans retreated in September 1944, [[Jüri Uluots]], the last Prime Minister of the Estonian Republic prior to Soviet occupation, assumed the responsibilities of president (as dictated in the Constitution) and appointed a new government while seeking recognition from the [[Allies]].  The new government fled to [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] and operated in exile until 1992, when [[Heinrich Mark]], the prime minister of the Estonian government in exile acting as president, presented his credentials to incoming president [[Lennart Meri]].

===After World War II===

[[Image:Baltic states borders.jpg|thumb|border changes of Estonia after World War II]]

In [[World War II]] Estonia suffered huge losses. Ports were destroyed, and 45% of industry and 40% of the railways were damaged.  Estonia's population decreased by one-fifth, about 200,000 people. Some 10% of the population (over 80,000 people) fled to the West between 1940 and 1944.  More than 30,000 soldiers were killed in action. In 1944 Russian [[air raid]]s destroyed [[Narva]] and one-third of the residential area in [[Tallinn]]. By the late autumn of 1944, Soviet forces expelled the last German troops from Estonia, ushering in a second phase of Soviet rule, followed again by a wave of arrests and executions of people considered disloyal to the Soviets.

An anti-Soviet [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement known as the [[Forest Brothers|"Metsavennad" ("Forest Brothers")]] developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946-48. It is hard to tell how many people were in the ranks of the ''Metsavennad'', however it is estimated on different times there could be about 30,000–35,000 people. Probably the last Forest Brother was caught in the September of 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.

In March 1949, 20,722 people (2.5% of the population) were deported to Siberia. By the beginning of the 1950s, the occupying regime had suppressed the resistance movement.

After the war the Communist Party of the [[Estonian SSR|Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (ECP) became the pre-eminent organization in the republic. The ethnic Estonian share in the total ECP membership decreased from 90% in 1941 to 48% in 1952.
[[Image:Flag of Estonian SSR.svg|thumb|[[Flag of Estonian SSR]]]]
After [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death, Party membership vastly expanded its social base to include more ethnic Estonians. By the mid-1960s, the percentage of ethnic Estonian membership stabilized near 50%. On the eve of [[perestroika]] the ECP claimed about 100,000 members; less than half were ethnic Estonians and they totalled less than 2% of the country's population.

One positive aspect of the post-Stalin era in Estonia was the re-permission in the late 1950s of citizens' contacts with foreign countries. Ties were reactivated with [[Finland]], and in the 1960s, a ferry connection was opened from Tallinn to [[Helsinki]] and Estonians began watching Finnish television. This electronic "window on the West" afforded Estonians more information on current affairs and more access to Western culture and thought than any other group in the Soviet Union. This heightened media environment was important in preparing Estonians for their vanguard role in extending perestroika during the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] era.

In the late 1970s, Estonian society grew increasingly concerned about the threat of cultural Russification to the Estonian language and national identity. By 1981, Russian was taught in the first grade of Estonian language schools and was also introduced into the Estonian pre-school teaching.

By the beginning of the Gorbachev era, concern over the cultural survival of the Estonian people had reached a critical point. The ECP remained stable in the early perestroika years but waned in the late 1980s. Other political movements, groupings, and parties moved to fill the power vacuum. The first and most important was the [[Estonian Popular Front]], established in April 1988 with its own platform, leadership, and broad constituency. The [[Greens]] and the dissident-led [[Estonian National Independence Party]] soon followed. By 1989, the political spectrum widened, and new parties were formed and re-formed almost daily.

The republic's [[Supreme Soviet]] transformed into an authentic regional lawmaking body. This relatively conservative legislature passed an early declaration of sovereignty ([[November 16]], [[1988]]); a law on economic independence (May 1989) confirmed by the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet that November; a language law making Estonian the [[official language]] (January 1989); and local and republic election laws stipulating residency requirements for voting and candidacy (August, November 1989).

Although the majority of Estonia's large Russian-speaking diaspora of Soviet-era immigrants did not support full independence, they were divided in their goals for the republic. In March 1990 some 18% of [[Russian language|Russian]] speakers supported the idea of a fully independent Estonia, up from 7% the previous autumn, and by early 1990 only a small minority of ethnic Estonians were opposed to full independence.

==Regaining independence==

Despite the emergence of the Popular Front and the Supreme Soviet as a new lawmaking body, since 1989 the different segments of the indigenous Estonian population had been politically mobilized by different and competing actors. The Popular Front's proposal, to declare the independence of Estonia as a new, so-called "third republic" whose citizens would be all those living there at the moment found less and less support over time. 

A grassroots Estonian Citizens' Committees Movement launched in 1989 with the objective of registering all pre-war citizens of the Republic of Estonia and their descendants in order to convene a Congress of Estonia. Their emphasis was on the illegal nature of the Soviet system and that hundreds of thousands inhabitants of Estonia had not ceased to be citizens of Estonian Republic which still existed ''de jure'', recognized by the majority of Western nations. Despite the hostility of the mainstream official press and intimidation by Soviet Estonian authorities, dozens of local citizens' committees were elected by popular initiative all over the country. These quickly organized into a nation-wide structure and by the beginning of 1990, over 900,000 people had registered themselves as citizens of the Republic of Estonia. 

The spring of 1990 saw two free elections and two alternative legislatures developed in Estonia. On [[24 February]] [[1990]], the 464-member Congress of Estonia (including 35 delegates of refugee communities abroad) was elected by the registered citizens of the republic. The Congress of Estonia convened for the first time in Tallinn [[March 11]]–12, 1990, passing 14 declarations and resolutions. A 70-member standing committee (Eesti Komitee) was elected with [[Tunne Kelam]] as its chairman. 

In the [[March 18]] [[1990]] elections for the 105-member Supreme Soviet all residents of Estonia were eligible to participate, including all Soviet-era immigrants from the U.S.S.R. and approximately 50,000 Soviet troops stationed there. The Popular Front coalition, composed of [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Centrism|centrist parties]] and led by former [[Central Planning Committee]] official [[Edgar Savisaar]], gained a parliamentary majority. In May 1990, the Supreme Soviet restored the name of the "Republic of Estonia" and proclaimed only laws adopted in Estonia (by the Supreme Soviet) as valid.

In March 1991 a referendum was held on the issue of independence. This was somewhat controversial, as holding a referendum could be taken as signalling that Estonian independence would be established rather than "re"-established. There was some discussion about whether it was appropriate to allow the Russian immigrant minority to vote, or if this decision should be reserved exclusively for citizens of Estonia. In the end all major political parties backed the referendum, considering it most important to send a strong signal to the world. To further legitimise the vote, all residents of Estonia were allowed to participate. The result vindicated these decisions, as the referendum produced a strong endorsement for independence. Turnout was 82%, and 64% of all possible voters in the country backed independence, with only 17% against. 

Through a strict, non-confrontational policy in pursuing independence, Estonia managed to avoid the violence which [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] incurred in the bloody January 1991 crackdowns and in the border customs-post guard murders that summer. During the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)#Yeltsin and the dissolution of the USSR|August coup]] in the U.S.S.R., Estonia was able to maintain constant operation and control of its [[telecommunication]]s facilities, thereby offering the [[Western world|West]] a clear view into the latest coup developments and serving as a conduit for swift Western support and recognition of Estonia's redeclaration of independence on [[August 20]], [[1991]]. [[August 20]] remains a national holiday in Estonia because of this.  Following Europe's lead, the United States formally reestablished diplomatic relations with Estonia on [[September 2]], and the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet offered recognition on [[September 6]].

After more than 3 years of negotiations, on [[August 31]], [[1994]], the armed forces of [[Russia]] withdrew from Estonia. Since fully regaining independence Estonia has had 12 governments with 8 prime ministers: [[Mart Laar]], [[Andres Tarand]], [[Tiit Vähi]], [[Mart Siimann]], [[Siim Kallas]], [[Juhan Parts]], and [[Andrus Ansip]]. The PMs of the interim government (1990–1992) were [[Edgar Savisaar]] and [[Tiit Vähi]].

Since the last Russian troops left in [[1994]], Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with Western Europe. Estonia opened accession negotiations with the [[European Union]] in 1998 and joined in 2004, shortly after becoming a member of [[NATO]].
