[[Image:Lasvegas.usa.arp.400pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The south end of The Strip; approximately one third of the entire Strip is represented here.]]
The '''Las Vegas Strip''' (also known as '''The Strip''') is a 4&nbsp;[[mile|mi]] (6.7&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) section of [[Las Vegas Boulevard|Las Vegas Boulevard South]] that has been designated an [[National Scenic Byway|All-American Road]]. 
Only part of The Strip is located within the city limits of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]: the section north of Sahara Avenue. The section south of Sahara Avenue is in [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]]'s unincorporated Township of [[Paradise, Nevada]]. 

Many of the largest [[hotel]], [[casino]] and [[resort]] properties in the world are located on The Strip. Over the years, Las Vegas Boulevard South has been called [[Arrowhead Highway]], "Salt Lake Highway", [[U.S. Highway 91]], and ''Los Angeles Highway''. The Strip was reportedly named by [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[police officer]] Guy McAfee, after his hometown's [[Sunset Strip]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lasvegas/peopleevents/p_mcafee.html |title=Las Vegas: An Unconventional History |accessdate=2007-06-07 |format= |work= [[American Experience]]}}</ref>

==Boundaries==
[[Image:Roadtrip 02 bg 041506.jpg|thumb|right|A similar view of the Strip at night from the Paris Hotel and Casino's Eiffel Tower]]
At the northern point of the Strip is the [[Stratosphere Las Vegas|Stratosphere]] while [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino|Mandalay Bay]] marks the southern tip. Nearly 3.5 miles of the 4-mile length are located in the township of [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]], [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]]. Depending on the definition, very little to none of it is within the Las Vegas city limits. [[McCarran International Airport|McCarran Airport]] (LAS) is located at the southern end of The Strip, along with the famous [[Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign]], which also appears in the median of Las Vegas Boulevard at the north end near the intersection of east St. Louis and south Main Streets. The "South Strip" is used to describe the section of Las Vegas Boulevard between Sunset Road or Blue Diamond Road and St. Rose Parkway.

==History==
The first casino to be built on Highway 91 was the ''Pair-o-Dice Club'' in 1931; the first on what is today's Strip was the [[El Rancho Vegas]], opening on [[April 3]] [[1941]] with 63 rooms and standing for almost 20 years before being destroyed by fire in 1960. Its success spawned a second hotel on what would become The Strip, the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|Hotel Last Frontier]], in 1942. The [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]] opened a few years later, on [[December 26]] [[1946]].

In 1968, [[Kirk Kerkorian]] purchased the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]] and hired Sahara Hotels Vice President Alex Shoofey as President. Alex Shoofey brought along 33 of Sahara's top executives. The Flamingo was used to train future employees of the International Hotel, which was under construction. Opening in 1969, the [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]], with 1,512 rooms, became the largest hotel in the world, and began the era of mega-resorts. The International is known as the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] today.

The first [[MGM Grand Hotel and Casino]], also a Kerkorian property, opened in 1973 with 2,084 rooms. At the time, this was the largest hotel in the world by number of rooms. On [[November 21]] [[1980]], the MGM Grand suffered the worst resort fire in the history of Las Vegas, killing 87 people as a result of electrical problems. It reopened eight months later. In 1986, Kerkorian sold the MGM Grand to Bally Manufacturing, and it was renamed [[Bally's Las Vegas|Bally's]].
[[Image:Las Vegas by Night.jpg|thumb|left|Las Vegas Strip at night with the Aladdin (Now Planet Hollywood) and Paris hotels]]
The opening of [[The Mirage]] in 1989 set a new level to the Las Vegas experience, as smaller hotels and casinos made way for the larger mega-resorts. These huge facilities offer [[entertainment]] and [[restaurant|dining]] options, as well as gambling and lodging. This change impacted the smaller, well-known and now historic hotels and casinos, like [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|The Dunes]], [[Sands Hotel|The Sands]] and the [[Stardust Hotel|Stardust]].

In 1995, following the death of [[Dean Martin]], the lights along the strip were dimmed in a sign of respect to him. In 2005, Las Vegas renamed Industrial Road "Dean Martin Drive", also as a tribute to the famous [[Rat Pack]] singer, actor, and frequent Las Vegas entertainer.

In an effort to attract families, resorts offered more attractions geared toward youth, but had limited success. The (current) [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] opened in 1993 with Grand Adventures [[amusement park]], but the park closed in 2000 due to lack of interest. Similarly, in 2003 [[Treasure Island Hotel and Casino|Treasure Island]] closed its own [[video arcade]] and abandoned the previous [[pirate]] theme, adopting the new ''ti'' name.
[[Image:Las Vegas Strip (view North from Tropicana intersection).jpg|thumb|right|View of the Strip, looking north from the [[Tropicana - Las Vegas Boulevard intersection|Tropicana intersection]]]]
Downtown Las Vegas hotels and casinos suffered heavily from the Strip's boom. They have funneled money into remodeling the [[facade]]s of casinos, adding additional security and new attractions, like the [[Fremont Street Experience]] and [[Neonopolis]] (complete with movie theaters).

In addition to the large hotels, casinos and resorts, The Strip is home to a few smaller casinos, [[motel]]s and other attractions, such as [[M&M World]], [[Adventuredome]] and the [[Fashion Show Mall]]. Starting in the mid-1990s, The Strip became a popular [[New Year's Eve]] celebration destination. [[Wet 'n Wild]] water park, located next to the Sahara hotel, closed permanently at the end of the 2004 season.

In 2004, [[MGM Mirage]] announced plans for ''[[Project City Center]]'', a 66-acre (600,000 mÂ²), $7 billion multi-use project on the site of the Boardwalk hotel and adjoining land. It will consist of hotel, casino, condo, retail and other uses on the site. When completed, City Center will be the largest such complex in the world. Construction began in April 2006, and the first elements of this project are expected to be available in 2009.

In December 2006, the Las Vegas Strip became the world's second largest gambling center,<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last= Barboza |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Asian Rival Moves Past Las Vegas |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/business/worldbusiness/24macao.html?ex=1327294800&en=150850fd9370148a&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |work= |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2007-01-24 |accessdate= }}</ref> and it was announced that a 1,888-foot (575 m) high-rise hotel and condominium would be built on the Las Vegas Strip on the former Wet 'n Wild site. The building is seeking [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] approval, and if built, the tower would be the tallest building in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |first= Arnold M.  |last=Knightly |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Strip development is really going vertical |url= http://www.lvbusinesspress.com/articles/2006/12/07/news/iq_11011032.txt |work= |publisher= [[Las Vegas Business Press]]|date=2006-12-07 |accessdate= }}</ref>

==The Strip today==
{{wide image |Las Vegas Strip panorama.jpg|1450px|The Las Vegas Strip by night with [[Project City Center]] construction on the bottom right}}

===Transportation===
While not on The Strip itself, the [[Las Vegas Monorail]] runs on the east side of The Strip from Tropicana Avenue to Sahara Road.

[[Image:The_deuce_CAT_ticket.jpg|thumb|right|A 24-hour pass for [[The Deuce]] bus costs $5.]]
[[Citizens Area Transit|CAT Bus]] provides service on the strip with double decker buses known as [[The Deuce]]. The Deuce stops at most major resorts and continues north to downtown and the Fremont Street Experience. A current [http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/cat/fareinfo.htm list of fares] is available.

A tourist trolley service travels up and down The Strip and stops at various, but not all, Strip hotels, along with a stop at the Fashion Show Mall. The fare is $2.00 for a one way ride, regardless how far you travel down the strip. Alternatively, a 24-hour pass is $5, and exact change is required. Trolleys are scheduled to arrive every 15 minutes.

Two small, free cable-pulled [[tram]]s operate on the Strip. One runs between Treasure Island and The Mirage, while the other provides service to [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino|Mandalay Bay]], [[Luxor Hotel|Luxor]], and [[Excalibur Hotel and Casino|Excalibur]].

===Free shuttles===
[[Image:LVBlvdRushHourDec2005.JPG|thumb|right|Las Vegas Blvd. traffic during the day]]
* Between [[Harrah's Las Vegas]] and the [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino]]. Approximately every 30 minutes.
* Between [[Sam's Town]] and [[Bill's Gamblin' Hall and Saloon]], [[Harrah's Las Vegas]], [[Riviera Hotel]], and [[Tropicana Resort & Casino]]. Approximately every hour and a half.
* Between [[Caesars Palace]] and the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino. Approximately every 30 minutes.
* Between [[Paris Las Vegas|Paris]]/[[Bally's Las Vegas|Bally's]] and the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino. Approximately every 30 minutes.
* Between [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino]] and the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] and the [[Harley-Davidson Cafe]] (next to [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino|Planet Hollywood]]). Leaves the Hard Rock on the hour.
* Between Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, [[Fashion Show Mall]] and the [[The Forum Shops at Caesars|Forum Shops at Caesars Palace]]. Leaves the Hard Rock on the hour.
* Between [[Wynn Las Vegas]] and the [[Las Vegas Convention Center]] [[Las Vegas Monorail|Monorail]] Stop.

Many free shuttles have a policy requiring a room key from an affiliated casino, but it is not typically enforced.

===Walking around===
Several Strip hotels have undertaken efforts to make the street more pedestrian-friendly. New casinos design their [[faÃ§ade]]s to attract walk-up customers, and many of these entrances have become attractions themselves - the Fountains at [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio]], the volcano at [[The Mirage]], and the [[Treasure Island Hotel and Casino|Treasure Island]] (TI) Sirens of TI are the most well-known. People gather on the sidewalks in front of the casinos to watch these shows.

To alleviate traffic issues at popular intersections, footbridges have been installed to help pedestrians more safely cross the roads. The [[Tropicana - Las Vegas Boulevard intersection|Tropicana - Las Vegas Boulevard]] footbridges were the first to be installed, and based on the success of this project additional footbridges have been built on Las Vegas Boulevard at the Flamingo Road intersection; between The Mirage/Treasure Island and The Venetian; and the latest ones at the Las Vegas Boulevard-Spring Mountain and Sands Avenue intersection connecting the Wynn with the Fashion Show Mall.

===Golf courses===
In recent years, all but one of the on-Strip [[golf course]]s (the Desert Inn Golf Course) have fallen prey to the mega-resorts need for land and have closed. Developer [[Steve Wynn (developer)|Steve Wynn]], founder of previously owned [[Mirage Resorts]], purchased the Desert Inn and golf course for his new company [[Wynn Resorts Limited|Wynn Resorts]]. In 2005, he opened [[Wynn Las Vegas]], complete with remodeled golf course providing tee times to hotel guests only.

In 2000, [http://www.balihaigolfclub.com/ Bali Hai Golf Club] opened just south of Mandalay Bay and the Strip. Catering to a high-end golf enthusiast, the Bali Hai Golf Course can easily be seen by drivers on [[Interstate 15]].
