"'''Ulysses'''" is a poem by the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] poet [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] (1809–92), written in 1833 and published in 1842. In the poem, [[Ulysses]] describes his discontent and restlessness upon returning to his kingdom, [[Ithaca]], after his far-reaching travels. He yearns to explore again, despite reunion with his wife [[Penelope]] and son [[Telemachus]].

Many authors, from [[Euripides]] to [[Shakespeare]], have incorporated Ulysses in their works since the character first appeared in [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' (c. 800–600 [[Anno Domini|BC]]). Tennyson's Ulysses echoes Homer's, but most resembles "Ulisse" in [[Dante|Dante's]] ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'' (c. 1320), in which Ulisse is condemned to hell for his zealous pursuit of knowledge and for his adventures at others' expense. 

For most of the poem's history, a non-ironic reading of its themes prevailed: the heroic, resolute Ulysses was admired for his determination "to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield".<ref>Pettigrew, p. 28.</ref> This, the poem's last line, has become a popular quotation. The non-ironic interpretation is supported by Tennyson's statements about the poem, and the events in his life—the death of a close friend—when he wrote it. Scholars have since offered other interpretations of the poem, arguing that Ulysses' sentiment and the poem's [[dramatic monologue]] form are inconsistent and reveal flaws in Ulysses' character or Tennyson's conception of the poem.

As the poem begins, Ulysses ([[Odysseus]] in Greek)<ref>The word "Ulysses" (more correctly "Ulixes") is the Latin form of the Greek "[[Odysseus]]", source of the word "odyssey".</ref> has returned to his kingdom, [[Ithaca]], after fighting in the Trojan War and travelling home from a long, eventful journey. Confronted again by domestic life, Ulysses describes his lack of contentment, including his indifference toward the "savage race" whom he governs. Ulysses contrasts his restlessness and boredom with his heroic past. He contemplates his age and eventual death—"Life piled on life / Were all too little, and of one to me / Little remains"—and longs for experience and knowledge, asserting the dullness of pausing. His son Telemachus will inherit the throne that Ulysses finds burdensome. While Ulysses thinks Telemachus will be an adequate king, he seems to have little empathy for his son—"He works his work, I mine"—and the necessary methods of governing—"by slow prudence" and "through soft degrees". In the final verse, Ulysses turns his attention to his mariners and calls on them to join him on another quest, making no guarantees as to their fate but attempting to conjure their heroic past:

<poem>
:… Come, my friends,
:'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
:Push off, and sitting well in order smite
:The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
:To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
:Of all the western stars, until I die.
:It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;
:It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
:And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
</poem>

The poem's seventy lines of [[blank verse]] are presented as a [[dramatic monologue]]. Ulysses' forceful and unadorned language expresses his conflicting moods as he searches for continuity between his past and future. He seems to carefully choose his tone to reinforce his sophistication and rank.<ref>Campbell, p. 132.</ref> The poem's insistent [[iambic pentameter]] is often interrupted by [[spondee]]s ([[metrical feet]] consisting of two long syllables), which slow down the movement of the poem. Noteworthy are lines 19–21:

<poem>
:Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough
:Gleams that untravel'd world whose margin fades
:Forever and forever when I move.
</poem>

The poet [[Matthew Arnold]], Tennyson's contemporary, remarked, "these three lines by themselves take up nearly as much time as a whole book of the ''Iliad''."<ref>Quoted in Markley, p. 125.</ref>
Many of the poem's clauses carry over line endings; this [[enjambment]] emphasizes Ulysses' restlessness and dissatisfaction.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Three Modes in Tennyson's Prosody|author=Ostriker, Alicia | journal=PMLA|volume=82|issue=2|year=May 1967|pages=273–284}}</ref>

Tennyson completed the poem on [[October 20]], [[1833]],<ref>Tennyson, A. T., & Day, A. (1991), 360.</ref> but it was not published until 1842 in his second collection of ''Poems''. Unlike many of Tennyson's other important poems, "Ulysses" was not revised after its publication.<!--Cressman--> It has, however, been printed with both three and four paragraphs. With three paragraphs, the poem is divided at lines 33 and 44; with four, the five-line introduction becomes its own movement. Tennyson originally blocked out the poem in four paragraphs, a structure that affects the analysis of Ulysses' narration. In the four-movement version, the first and third are thematically parallel, but may be read as interior and exterior [[monologue]]s, respectively.<ref>Pettigrew, p. 41.</ref>

== Interpretations ==

=== Autobiographical elements ===

[[Image:Arthur Henry Hallam.jpg|thumb|120px|"Ulysses" was written after the death of Tennyson's close friend, Arthur Henry Hallam (1811–33).]]

Tennyson penned "Ulysses" after the death of his close Cambridge friend, the poet [[Arthur Henry Hallam]] (1811–33), with whom Tennyson had a close emotional bond. The two friends had spent much time discussing poetry and philosophy and writing verse together. Together they had traveled to [[southern France]], the [[Pyrenees]], and Germany. Tennyson and his circle considered Hallam destined for greatness, perhaps as a statesman.<ref>Hughes, p. 197.</ref> 

When he heard on [[October 1]], [[1833]] of his friend's death, Tennyson was living in [[Somersby, Lincolnshire|Somersby]], [[Lincolnshire]], in close quarters with his mother and nine of his ten siblings. His father had died in 1831, requiring Tennyson to move home and take responsibility for the family. Tennyson's friends became increasingly concerned about his mental and physical health during this time. The family had little income, and two of Tennyson's brothers were mentally ill. As Tennyson's outlook was improving—he was adjusting to his new domestic duties, regaining contact with friends, and had published his 1832 book of poems—the news of Hallam's death arrived. Tennyson shared his grief with his sister, [[Emilia Tennyson|Emily]], who had lost her fiance.

The emotional gulf between the state of his domestic affairs and the loss of his special friendship informs the reading of "Ulysses"—particularly its treatment of domesticity—according to Victorian scholar Linda Hughes.<ref name="hughes">Hughes.</ref> At one moment, Ulysses' discontent seems to mirror Tennyson's, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by traveling again. It may be that Ulysses' determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth;<ref>Hughes, p. 199.</ref> he said that the poem "gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life".<ref>Quoted in Tennyson, A. T., & Roberts, A. (2000), p. 567.</ref> Reflecting on another occasion, the poet stated, "There is more about myself in ''Ulysses'', which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, but that still life must be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of [Hallam's] loss upon me than many poems in ''In Memoriam''."<ref>Quoted in Hughes, p. 195.</ref> Hallam's death influenced much of Tennyson's poetry, including perhaps his most highly regarded work, ''[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]'', begun in 1833 and completed seventeen years later.

For other critics, stylistic incongruities between the poem and its author make "Ulysses" exceptional. [[University of Sussex]] English literature chair W. W. Robson writes, "Tennyson, the responsible social being, the admirably serious and 'committed' individual, is uttering strenuous sentiments in the accent of Tennyson the most un-strenuous, lonely and poignant of poets."<ref name="robson">Robson, W. W. (1957). "The Dilemma of Tennyson". In Killham (1960), p. 159.</ref> He finds that Tennyson's two widely noted personae—the "responsible social being" and the melancholic poet—meet uniquely in "Ulysses", yet seem not to recognize each other within the text.

=== Literary context ===

Many poets have written about Ulysses, among them [[Homer]], [[Euripides]], [[Horace]], [[Dante]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Alexander Pope]], but Tennyson's poem is considered the first modern account.<ref name="Stanford202">Stanford, p. 202.</ref> In the twentieth century, [[James Joyce|James Joyce's]] novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) and [[Ezra Pound|Ezra Pound's]] poem ''[[The Cantos]]'' (1915–62) invoked the character. 

Tennyson adopts aspects of his Ulysses from many sources.<ref name="Stanford202" /> Homer's ''Odyssey'' provides the narrative background: the prophet [[Tiresias]] foretells in the 11th book of the ''Odyssey'' that Ulysses will return to Ithaca after a difficult voyage, begin a new, mysterious voyage, and die an "unwarlike" death at sea. Tennyson's Ulysses, however, is not the lover of public affairs of Homer's poems. Rather, "Ulisse" from [[Dante|Dante's]] ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'' is Tennyson's main source for the character,<ref>Pettigrew, p. 31.</ref> which has an important effect on the poem's interpretation.<ref>Tennyson wrote in the margin of [[Euripedes]]' ''Hecabe'', "Ulysses is, as usual, crafty [and] unfeeling." (Markley, p. 123).</ref> Ulisse describes his foretold voyage in the ''Inferno'''s 26th [[canto]], in which he is condemned to hell for using his gift of reason for evil. Dante treats Ulisse, with his "zeal&nbsp;…/ T'explore the world", as an evil counselor who lusts for adventure at the expense of his family and his duties in Ithaca.<ref>Rowlinson (1994), p. 241.</ref> Tennyson projects this zeal into Ulysses' unquenched desire for knowledge:<ref>Schwarz, D. R. (1987). ''Reading Joyce's Ulysses.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, p. 39. ISBN 0312664583.</ref> 

<poem>
:And this gray spirit yearning in desire
:To follow knowledge like a sinking star,
:Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.
</poem>

The poet's intention to recall Homer's character is also evident in certain passages. "I am become a name" recalls an episode in the ''Odyssey'' in which [[Demodocus (Homer)|Demodocus]] sings about Odysseus's adventures in the king's presence, acknowledging his fame. With phrases such as "There gloom the dark broad seas" and "The deep / Moans round with many voices", Tennyson seems to be consciously invoking Homer.<ref>Markley, p. 124.</ref>

Critics have noted the influence of Shakespeare in two passages. In the early movement, the savage race "that hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me" echoes [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet's]] [[soliloquy]]: "What is a man, / If his chief good and market of his time / Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more."<ref>IV, iv. 32 ff., quoted in Bush, Douglas (Jan 1943). "Tennyson's 'Ulysses' and 'Hamlet'." ''The Modern Language Review'', 38(1), 38.</ref> Tennyson's "How dull it is pause, to make an end, / to rust unburnish’d, not to shine in use!" recalls Shakespeare's Ulysses in ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' (c. 1602):<ref>''Troilus and Cressida'', Act III, Scene III, quoted in Stanford, p. 203.</ref>
<poem>
:Perserverance, my dear lord,
:Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
:Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail,
:In monumental mockery.
</poem>

The last movement—among the most familiar passages in nineteenth-century English-language poetry—presents decisively the influence of Dante.<ref>i) Robson, W. W. (1957). "The Dilemma of Tennyson". In Killham (1960). ii) Stanford.</ref>  Ulysses turns his attention from himself and his kingdom and speaks of ports, seas, and his mariners. The strains of discontent and weakness in old age remain throughout the poem, but Tennyson leaves Ulysses to "strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield", recalling the Dantesque infernal desire for knowledge. The last words of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] character echo Tennyson's Ulysses, who calls his men to join him on one last journey. Quoting Ulisse:

<poem>
:'O brothers', said I, 'who are come despite
:Ten thousand perils to the West, let none,
:While still our senses hold the vigil slight
:Remaining to us ere our course is run,
:Be willing to forgo experience
:Of the unpeopled world beyond the sun.
:Regard your origin,—from whom and whence!
:Not to exist like brutes, but made were ye
:To follow virtue and intelligence'.<ref>Quoted in Robson, W. W. (1957). "The Dilemma of Tennyson". In Killham (1960).</ref>
</poem>

According to the modern Tennyson critic Matthew Rowlinson, "Ulysses" is an argument for continuation of narrative in a textual tradition, and a "meditation on the ground of that continuity".<ref>Rowlinson (1994), p. 122.</ref> The narrator asserts the inseparability of Ulysses, the person, with his name. Ulysses says, "I am become a name&nbsp;… I am a part of all that I have met" in successive sentences and in parallel clauses. He speaks in the fictional time of Homer’s Ulysses, but his claim is also that of Tennyson’s text, existing in another temporal order, and therefore refers to his fame ''extending from'' the Homeric and other works about him.<ref>Rowlinson (1994), p. 121–123.</ref>

=== Ulysses as narrator ===

[[Image:Paradise Lost 2.jpg|right|thumb|"Satan rises from the burning lake" (1866) by [[Gustave Doré]]; one interpretation of the poem compares Ulysses with Milton's Satan in ''Paradise Lost''.]]

The degree to which Tennyson identifies with Ulysses has been one of the great debates among scholars of the poem.<ref name="hughes"/> Critics who find that Tennyson identifies with the speaker read Ulysses' speech "affirmatively", or without [[irony]]. Many other interpretations of the poem have developed from the argument that Tennyson does not identify with Ulysses, and further criticism  has suggested that the purported inconsistencies in Ulysses' character are the fault of the poet himself.

Key to the affirmative reading of "Ulysses" is the biographical context of the poem.  Such a reading takes into account Tennyson's statements about writing the poem—"the need to go forward"—and considers that he would not undermine Ulysses' determination with irony when he needed a similar stalwartness to face life after Hallam's death. Ulysses is thus seen as an heroic character whose determination to seek "some work of noble note" is courageous in the face of a "still hearth" and old age.<ref name="hughes194">Hughes, p. 194.</ref> 

Tennyson, however, discouraged an autobiographical interpretation of his monologues.<ref>Campbell, p. 130.</ref> Until the early twentieth century, readers reacted to the poem sympathetically. The meaning of the poem was increasingly debated as Tennyson's stature rose.<ref>Hughes, p. 200.</ref> After [[Duke University]] English scholar Paull F. Baum argued in 1948 that Ulysses recalls [[John Milton|Milton's]] Satan in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667),<ref>Baum, P. F. (1948). ''Tennyson sixty years after.'' Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press. Cited in Hughes (1979).</ref> the ironic interpretation became dominant. Ulysses' apparent disdain for those around him is one facet of the ironic perspective. He declares that he is "matched with an aged wife", indicates his weariness in governing a "savage race", and suggests his philosophical distance from his son Telemachus. A skeptical reading of the third movement finds it a condescending tribute to Telemachus and a rejection of his "slow prudence". However, the adjectives used to describe Telemachus—"blameless", "discerning", and "decent"—are words with positive connotations in other of Tennyson's poetry and within the classical tradition.<ref name="hughes194"/> 

Critic E. J. Chiasson argued in 1954 that Ulysses is unfaithful, and that Tennyson uses a "method of indirection" to affirm the need for religious faith by showing how Ulysses' unfaithfulness leads to his neglect of kingdom and family. Chiasson finds the poem "intractable" in Tennyson's canon, but the poem's meaning resolves itself when this indirection is understood: it illustrates Tennyson's conviction that "disregarding religious sanctions and 'submitting all things to desire' leads to either a [[wikt:sybaritic|sybaritic]] or a brutal repudiation of responsibility and 'life'."<ref>E. J. Chiasson, "Tennyson's 'Ulysses'—A Re-Interpretation". In Killham (1960), 164–173.</ref>

Other ironic readings have connected Ulysses to [[Byronic hero]]es such as [[Childe Harold]], and found him longing for withdrawal, even death, in the form of his proposed quest. In the Homeric narrative, Ulysses' mariners, whom he calls on—"Come, my friends, / 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world"—are dead, which has encouraged psychological interpretations.<ref name="hughes"/>

=== The dramatic monologue ===

Scholars disagree about how "Ulysses" functions as a [[dramatic monologue]]; it is not necessarily clear to whom Ulysses is speaking, if anyone, and from what location. Some see the verse turning from a [[soliloquy]] to a public address as Ulysses seems to speak to himself in the first two movements, then turn to an audience as he introduces his son, then relocate to the seashore where he addresses his mariners.<ref>Hughes, p. 201.</ref> In this interpretation, the comparatively direct and honest language of the first two movements is set against the more politically minded tone of the last two movements. For example, the third paragraph about Telemachus, in which Ulysses muses again about domestic life, is a "revised version [of the first movement fit] for public consumption".<ref>Pettigrew, p. 41.</ref>

The ironic interpretations of "Ulysses" may be the result of a tendency to consider the narrator of a dramatic monologue as necessarily "[[unreliable narrator|unreliable]]". According to critic Dwight Culler, the poem has been a victim of revisionist readings in which the reader expects to reconstruct the truth from a misleading narrator's accidental revelations.<ref>Culler, p. 368.</ref>  Culler views "Ulysses" instead as a [[dialectic]] in which the speaker weighs the virtues of a contemplative and an active approach to life.<ref>Markley, p. 126.</ref> Ulysses moves through four stages of emotion that are self-revelatory, not ironic. Beginning with his rejection of the "barren, sterile life" of Ithaca, he then remembers his heroic past, recognizes the validity of Telemachus' method of governing, and with these thoughts begins another journey.<ref>Culler, p. 383.</ref>

In noting the sense of passivity in the poem, critics highlight Tennyson's tendency toward the melancholic. [[T. S. Eliot]] opines that "Tennyson could not tell a story at all".<ref name="eliot"/> He finds Dante's treatment of Ulysses exciting, while Tennyson's piece is "an elegiac  mood".<ref name="eliot">T. S. Eliot, "In Memoriam". In Killham (1960), 210.</ref> "Ulysses" is found lacking in  narrative action; the hero's goal is vague, and by the poem's famous last line, it is not clear for what he is "striving", or to what he refuses to yield. According to Victorian scholar Herbert Tucker, Tennyson’s characters "move" through time and space to be moved inwardly.<ref name="tucker11">Tucker, p. 11.</ref> 
To Ulysses, experience is "somewhere out there",<ref name="tucker11"/>

=== Canonization ===

The contemporary reviews of "Ulysses" were positive and found no irony in the poem. Author [[John Sterling (author)|John Sterling]]&mdash;a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]] along with Tennyson&mdash;wrote  in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' in 1842, "How superior is 'Ulysses'! There is in this work a delightful epic tone, and a clear impassioned wisdom quietly carving its sage words and graceful figures on pale but lasting marble."<ref name="MarkleyQ124">Quoted in Markley, p. 124.</ref> Tennyson's 1842 volume of poetry impressed Scottish writer [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Quoting lines 62–64 in an 1842 letter to Tennyson—

<poem>
:It may be that the gulfs will wash us down,
:It may be we shall touch the happy Isles
:And see the great Achilles whom we knew! [sic]
</poem>

—Carlyle remarked, "These lines do not make me weep, but there is in me what would fill whole Lachrymatories as I read."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Carlyle and Tennyson|author=Sanders, Charles Richard|journal=PMLA|volume=76|issue=1|year=March, 1961|pages=82–97}}</ref> English writer and theologian [[Richard Holt Hutton]] summarized the poem as "[Tennyson's] friendly picture of the insatiable craving for new experience, enterprise, and adventure, when under the control of a luminous reason and a self-controlled will."<ref name="qstorch">Quoted in Storch, p. 283.</ref> The contemporary poet [[Matthew Arnold]] was early in observing the narrative irony of the poem: he found Ulysses' speech "the least ''plain'', the most ''un-Homeric'', which can possibly be conceived. Homer presents his thought to you just as it wells from the source of his mind: Mr. Tennyson carefully distills his thought before he will part with it. Hence comes&nbsp;… a heightened and elaborate air."<ref name="MarkleyQ124"/> 

[[Image:Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson - Project Gutenberg eText 17768.jpg|thumb|left|Tennyson, as Poet Laureate, used verse to promote Britain and her colonies; "Ulysses" has been interpreted as anticipating the concept of imperialism.]]
 
"Ulysses" was well-received by critics, yet its rise within the Tennyson canon took decades. Tennyson did not usually select it for publication in poetry anthologies; in teaching anthologies, however, the poem was usually included&mdash;and it remains a popular teaching poem today. Its current prominence in Tennyson's oeuvre is the result of two trends, according to Matthew Rowlinson: the rise of formal English poetry studies in the late nineteenth century, and the Victorian effort to articulate a British culture that could be exported.<ref name="r1992">Rowlinson (1992).</ref> He argues that "Ulysses" forms part of the prehistory of imperialism—a term that only appeared in the language in 1851. The protagonist sounds like a "colonial administrator", and his reference to seeking a newer world echoes the phrase "[[New World]]", which became common during the [[Renaissance]].  While "Ulysses" cannot be read as overtly imperialistic, Tennyson's later work as [[Poet Laureate]] sometimes argues for the value of Britain's colonies, or was accused of [[jingoism]]. Rowlinson invokes the Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser|Louis Althusser's]] extension of the argument that ideology is ahistorical, finding that Tennyson's poem "comes before an ideological construction for which it nonetheless makes people nostalgic".<ref name="r1992"/>

"Ulysses" remains much admired, even as the twentieth century brought new interpretations of the poem—scholars became skeptical of the narratorial voice and explored meanings beyond the [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]].<ref>Pettigrew, p. 27.</ref> In a 1929 essay, [[T. S. Eliot]] called "Ulysses" a "perfect poem",<ref>T. S. Eliot (1950). ''Selected essays, 1917-1932.'' New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 210. ISBN 0151803870.</ref> while noting that Tennyson's achievement is the result of "forcing". An analogue of Ulysses is found in Eliot's "[[Gerontion]]" (1920). Both poems are narrated by an aged man contemplating life's end. An excerpt from "Gerontion" reads as an ironic comment on "Ulysses"' introductory lines:<ref>Fulweiler, p. 170.</ref> 

<poem>
     Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.
     The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,
     Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.

                 I am an old man,	 
     A dull head among windy places.
</poem> 

The Italian poet [[Giovanni Pascoli]] (1855–1912) stated that his long lyric poem ''L'ultimo viaggio'' was an attempt to reconcile the portrayals of Ulysses in Dante and Tennyson with the prophecy that Ulysses would die "a mild death off the sea."<ref>Stanford, p. 205.</ref> Ulysses leaves Ithaca to retrace his epic voyage rather than begin another.

Professor of literature [[Basil Willey]] commented in 1956, "In 'Ulysses' the sense that he must press on and not moulder in idleness is expressed objectively, through the classical story, and not subjectively as his own experience. [Tennyson] comes here as near perfection in the grand manner as he ever did; the poem is flawless in tone from beginning to end; spare, grave, free from excessive decoration, and full of firmly controlled feeling."<ref name="qstorch"/>

=== Cultural legacy ===

Many readers have accepted the acclaimed last lines of "Ulysses" as inspirational, despite the ironic interpretations that find Ulysses' character inconsistent. For example, the poem's ending line has been used as a motto by schools and other organizations. The final three lines are inscribed on a cross commemorating Antarctic explorer [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and his party, who died on their return voyage from the South Pole in 1912:<ref>{{cite journal|author=Maher, Patrick|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3907/is_200501/ai_n13635392|title=A Ulysses Connection: Examining Experiences in the Ross Sea Region, Antarctica|journal=Journal of Experiential Education|year=2005|accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref>

<poem>
:One equal temper of heroic hearts,
:Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
:To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
