'''''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest''''' is an [[Academy Award]]-winning [[2006 in film|2006]] [[pirate]] [[Adventure film|adventure]] [[film]] that follows the [[2003 in film|2003]] summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''. The sequel is again directed by [[Gore Verbinski]] and produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]. 

[[Johnny Depp]], [[Orlando Bloom]] and [[Keira Knightley]] reprise their roles as [[Captain Jack Sparrow]], [[Will Turner]] and [[Elizabeth Swann]], respectively. Also returning are [[Jack Davenport]] as Commodore [[James Norrington]] and [[Jonathan Pryce]] as [[Weatherby Swann|Governor Weatherby Swann]]. Joining the cast are [[Bill Nighy]], who portrays the villainous [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] and [[Stellan Skarsgård]] playing Will Turner's father, [["Bootstrap Bill" Turner]]. 

The film was released in Australia and the United Kingdom on [[July 6]], [[2006]], and in the United States and Canada on  [[July 7]], [[2006]]. The movie set several records in its first three days, with an opening weekend of $135,600,000. As of its date of close, [[December 7]] [[2006]], the film has made $423,315,812 in the U.S. and became the third film to reach the $1,000,000,000 worldwide mark, with $1,065,659,812. ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' is set to follow on [[May 25]], [[2007]].

==Production==
Information about the two sequels to ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'' was presented at a [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] Investor Conference Studio Presentation in 2005. The title for the first sequel was revealed to be ''Dead Man's Chest'', and a second sequel was promised for a May [[2007 in film|2007]] theatrical release.

Locations were in the Costa Alegre, in [[Jalisco]] ([[Mexico]]) and [[Barrouallie]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St. Vincent]]. The sequel also includes [[location shooting]] in [[Dominica]] as well as [[The Bahamas]]. The filmmakers are largely shooting the two sequels [[List of films produced back-to-back|back-to-back]], à la ''[[The Matrix series|The Matrix Trilogy]]'', although throughout [[2005]] primary filming was for ''Dead Man's Chest'', with only a handful of scenes for the third movie being shot. Because of the back-to-back setup, filming for ''At World's End'' was not finished until [[February 7]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wordplayer.com/forums/moviesarc07/index.cgi?read=83160 | title=MOVIES Message Board - ARCHIVE 7 | author=Ted Elliott | publisher=Wordplay Forums | accessdate=2006-07-09}}</ref> During production, the "tank" set where many of the shipboard sequences are filmed was severely damaged by [[Hurricane Wilma]]. <ref>Special feature "According to Plan" of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest''' Special Edition's second DVD.</ref> 

''Dead Man's Chest'' premiered at [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]] on [[June 24]] [[2006]], two days prior to the reopening day of the refurbished [[Pirates of the Caribbean (theme park ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] attraction on which the movie series is based. The refurbished attraction includes an adjusted storyline and [[Audio-Animatronic|Audio Animatronics]] based on the movies and opened [[June 26]] [[2006]]. The same attraction at [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Florida]] also underwent refurbishment to feature captain Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and an appearance by the films' supernatural character Davy Jones as part of the attraction and reopened on [[July 6]] [[2006]] in conjunction with the film's theatrical release.

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
As the age of [[piracy]] nears its end, a new threat appears in [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]]&mdash;the [[East India Trading Company]] (EITC). Guiding the company's monopolistic expansion in the Caribbean is [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] ([[Tom Hollander]]), a powerful and ruthless EITC agent. Beckett intends to eradicate all pirates from the area. To this end, he arrests [[Elizabeth Swann]] ([[Keira Knightley]]) and [[Will Turner]] ([[Orlando Bloom]]) shortly before their wedding ceremony, threatening to execute them and the absent ex-Commodore [[James Norrington]] ([[Jack Davenport]]) for abetting [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow's]] escape. What Beckett really wants, however, is Sparrow and his magical compass, and he coerces Will into searching for both by offering [[clemency]].

While Elizabeth is in jail, Will searches for Jack. An informant in [[Tortuga]] leads him to the [[Black Pearl]] that is run aground on [[Pelegosto]], a [[cannibal]]-inhabited island where Jack and his crew are captive. Jack hid there after being visited by his former crew mate, [["Bootstrap Bill" Turner]], who is now an indentured sailor on the ghost ship, the ''[[The Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]''. Bootstrap delivered the ''Black Spot'' to Jack, a mark that his debt to [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Captain Davy Jones]] is due. Thirteen years previously, Jones raised the ''Black Pearl'' (formerly known as the Wicked Wench) from the ocean floor and made Jack her captain. In exchange, Jack must now serve aboard the ''Dutchman'' for 100 years or face Jones' leviathan, the [[The Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]]. 

Will, Jack and the crew escape, unexpectedly recruiting escapees [[Pintel and Ragetti]] as they are attempting to commandeer the ''Pearl'', and head to sea. Jack has been searching for a key that leads to untold riches, but his magical compass fails to work for him. He agrees to give Will the compass if he helps him find the key and what it unlocks. Seeking assistance from [[Tia Dalma]] ([[Naomie Harris]]), a voodoo priestess, Jack learns the compass will not work because he does not know what he truly wants&mdash;or he knows but is unable to claim it as his own. The key, Tia tells him, unlocks the ''Dead Man's Chest'' containing Davy Jones' beating [[heart]]. When the pain of lost love was too much to bear, Jones carved it from his chest and buried it. Whoever possesses the heart controls Davy Jones, thereby controlling the oceans. Back at sea, the Flying Dutchman encounters Sparrow, who deviously attempts to barter Will in exchange for himself. But Jones demands 100 souls within three days for Jack’s freedom and keeps Will as a "good faith payment." 

In Port Royal, Governor [[Weatherby Swann]] frees Elizabeth. Confronting Beckett at gunpoint, she forces him to validate a [[Letter of Marque]]&mdash;a royal document with which Beckett intends to recruit Sparrow as a [[privateer]] and that Elizabeth wants for Will. Stowing away on a merchant vessel, Elizabeth lands in [[Tortuga]] where she finds Jack and [[Joshamee Gibbs|Gibbs]] recruiting unsuspecting sailors in a pub. A fallen James Norrington also applies. Blaming Sparrow for his ruin, he tries to shoot the captain and ignites a brawl. Elizabeth knocks him out to save him from the angry mob. At the dock, Jack reveals the compass' secret to Elizabeth; it points to what the holder wants most in the world. When he convinces her that she can save Will by finding the chest, she gets a bearing. Once the ship is underway, tension arises between Jack and Elizabeth when each discovers the compass now points to the other. It is unclear if they desire one another or if each seeks the other as a means to obtain what they truly want. 
[[Image:JackDMC.jpg|left|thumb|225px|Jack opens the Dead Man's Chest containing Jones' heart.]]

On [[Isla Cruces]], Jack, Norrington, and Elizabeth find the Dead Man's Chest. Will, who has escaped the ''Dutchman'' with help from his father, Bootstrap Bill, arrives with the key that he stole from Davy Jones. Will wants to stab the heart to free his father, but a three-way duel erupts between Jack, Norrington, and Will, each claiming it; the arrival of Jones' crew and Ragetti and Pintel trying to make off with the chest further complicate matters. It is Norrington who ultimately escapes with the heart and the Letter of Marque while Jones’ crewmen retrieve a now-empty chest.

[[Image:Jack VS.. The Kraken.JPG|thumb|right|225px|Jack battles the Kraken.]]
The Flying Dutchman pursues the Black Pearl, but with the wind behind them, the Pearl outruns her. Jones ends the pursuit and instead summons the Kraken. In a moment of cowardice, Jack abandons the ship in a longboat, but unable to desert his crew, he returns in time to save them. He gives the order to abandon ship before the Kraken makes its final assault. ‎Realizing the Kraken is only hunting Jack, a deceptive Elizabeth kisses him while handcuffing him to the mast. Racked with guilt over her deceit, she tells the others Jack chose to remain behind, unaware Will witnessed the scene and now believes she loves Sparrow. Freeing himself from the shackles, Jack charges the Kraken, but the colossal beast drags him and the ''Pearl'' to a watery grave. Watching from his ship, Davy Jones declares their debt settled, although he soon discovers the chest is empty.

Arriving in Port Royal, Norrington presents the heart and the Letters of Marque to Lord Beckett in a bid to regain his career. Cutler Beckett now controls the seas. The grieving crew seeks refuge with Tia Dalma. Consoling them, she asks if they would sail to the World's End to return Jack and the ''Black Pearl''. When they agree, she says they will need a captain who knows those waters. To everyone's shock, the formerly dead [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]] ([[Geoffrey Rush]]) descends the stairs, eating an apple, and demanding to know what has become of his ship.

After the credits, the jailhouse dog that the cannibals chased earlier in the film has been crowned chief and is presumably about to be eaten by them.

===Critical reaction===
After months of anticipation and industry hype, reviews for ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' were mixed, as the film scored a 54% "Rotten" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest | title=Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) | publisher=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref> Among the positive critics were Michael Booth of the [[Denver Post]], who awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising it as "two hours and 20 minutes of escapism that once again makes the movies safe for guilt-free fun."<ref>{{cite web | title = Aye, mates: "Pirates" sequel is worth the doubloons

Although the film's greatest critic was british film critic Mark Kermode, who described the film as 'indicitive of the death of western civilisation'.[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1210274,00.html] Still, viewers were generally more positive, as the film currently holds a 7.3/10 user rating on the [[Internet Movie Database]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383574/ | title=Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) | publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref>

==Trivia==
{{too much trivia}}
*Walt Disney Pictures has been questioned by the National Garifuna Council, a representative body of the [[Garifuna]] people, for what they feel is a racist portrayal of the Calinago, or [[Caribs]], as [[cannibal]]s in ''Dead Man's Chest''. The Council called for what they considered to be a fair and accurate representation, and Disney responded that the script could not be altered. No known changes were made to the film.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4263227.stm | title=Film row over Pirates 'cannibals'|date=[[February 14]] [[2005]] | publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.seinebight.com/Disney-Garinagu.htm | title=Letter from Michael Polonio to Walt Disney Company-Must Read | publisher=Seine Bight | author=Michael Polonio | accessdate=2006-07-09}}</ref>

*This was also the first Disney film to use a new computer-generated Disney [[production logo]] before the film<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002802054 | title=Old Disney magic in new animated logo | publisher=[[hollywood Reporter|hollywoodreporter.com]] | accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref>. The first movie had no opening logos.
* According to Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot, the shot of Elizabeth clinging to Jack's leg as he prepares to shoot the powder keg was directly influenced by the work of [[Frank Frazetta]].
* In the Pelegosto scene, Leech, one of Jack's crew, makes an off comment about how only six of the remaining crew are truly needed to salvage the Pearl, and, ironically he and the rest of the men die moments later, leaving only the six more important crewmen (including Gibbs and Will). This is (apparently) a self mocking in-joke about the [[character shields]] that exist within the series, and definitely in this movie in itself.
* According to the film's writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio in the Dead Man's Chest DVD commentary, the captain that Mercer kills at the pier is named Hawkins, and is meant to be the father of Jim Hawkins, the lead character in Robert Louis Stevenson's [[Treasure Island]]. The writers claim that in the novel, Jim's father disappeared without a trace, and thus decided to supply an explanation. However, Jim's father never leaves home in the novel, and in fact dies from an illness in chapter three, rather than at the hands of the East India Company.
* The dice game played aboard the ''Dutchman'' is called [[Liar's dice|Liar's Dice]].
*For a dose of authenticity in the film's final twist, the actors were left unaware that [[Geoffrey Rush]] would appear in the movie. They were told that the person descending the stairs would be [[Anamaria]] from ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''; their surprised looks as Rush descends are genuine.
* Another authentic reaction was [[Orlando Bloom|Orlando Bloom's]] when Jack and Elizabeth kiss. A false page was inserted into his script; hence, the look of surprise on his face is genuine.
* Keira Knightley had to wear hair extensions during the filming of the movie. This was because her hair had been cut short for her role in ''[[Domino (film)|Domino]]''.

==References to and similarities with the first film==
{{toomuchtrivia}}
There are various references throughout the movie to scenes and lines that were in the first film. These include, but are not limited to: 
* Governor Swann accidentally pulls a candlestick off the prison wall, mirroring Will pulling one off of the Governor's wall in the first film.
* In the first film, when Elizabeth has just fallen off the cliff, Jack is having a conversation with the two soldiers, and is in the process of saying "and then they made me their chief", before he jumps in to save her. This is just Jack describing another version of his escape off the island after Barbossa marooned him. This is later told in an audio commentary.
* Jack asks "Why is the rum always gone?" and advises people to keep the rum away from Elizabeth ("Hide the rum!") when he recognizes her as one of the new crew signed on in Tortuga. This mirrors a scene in the first film, in which Elizabeth destroyed a large cache of rum. Jack (who had particularly enjoyed the rum), had asked, "Why is the rum gone?" twice. (In ''Dead Man's Chest'' he answers his own question when he gets up, staggers slightly drunkenly, and says, "Oh, that's why...")
* While Will was searching for Jack, one of the men reported that Jack could definitely be found in Singapore. In the first movie, when Jack saves Elizabeth by cutting open her corset, one of the soldiers remarked that he wouldn't have thought of that, and Jack responded "Clearly, you've never been to Singapore."
* Captain Barbossa is portrayed eating an apple, which was the symbol of desire he felt in the previous film.
* While Will is searching for Jack at Tortuga, he runs into Giselle and Scarlett. During their brief meeting Giselle slaps Will in the face as a message to be given to Jack; this is a nod to the first film when Jack and Will visit Tortuga where Scarlett and Giselle slap Jack in the face.  Will's facial reaction to the slap is also similar to Jack's facial reaction in the first film. 
*Will's comment about getting to the island using a pair of sea turtles strapped to his feet echoes the story Gibbs told Will to explain how Jack escaped from the island he was marooned on prior to the events of the first film. Jack comments in response, "Not so easy, is it?"
*Just before the crew of the Black Pearl is to leave the island that Davy Jones's heart is buried on, Jack hits Will over the head with an oar, which Will did to Jack in the first film.
*A reference to the famous dog with the keys is made when the prisoners are seen calling to Elizabeth in the same manner they used when calling the dog.
*When escaping from the cannibals and climbing aboard the Black Pearl, Jack says, "Alas, my children! This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost... ['caught' is inaudible because he gets splashed in the face by a wave] ... Captain Jack Sparrow." Jack says the same line at the beginning of the first film when he escapes after briefly holding Elizabeth hostage. He also says it at the end of the film before he falls off a ledge. Furthermore, Jack was only able to finish his speech the first time he said this line; he is always interrupted every try after. (Ironically, the first and only time he says it whole, he is caught a few scenes later.) 
*When Jack and Will sword fight in the first movie, Jack asks Will, "You're not a [[eunuch]] are you?" He also tells Barbossa that Will's a eunuch after the Interceptor explodes. In the second film, when the cannibals bring Will to Jack, Jack describes Will as "Eunuchy snip-snip" while making a cutting motion with his fingers. In the special deleted scenes disk for the first movie, Pintel states, "I used to date a eunuch." Jack also describes Will as having a "lovely singing voice" in the first film (in relation to the eunuch joke). In the second film Jack calls Will a "terrific soprano."
*Elizabeth has tried to garner attention three times by fainting in both movies, with the first two times from the first film working, the first for legitimately having no air because of her tight corset, and the second as a distraction for Will to rescue Jack from his hanging. In the second movie, she tries again to stop Will, Jack, and Norrington to stop their fight, but fails this time.
*In both films, we see Jack Sparrow using a rather unorthodox method of transportation in his first scene. In the first film he stands atop the mast of a sinking dinghy. In the second, he uses a coffin and a skeletal leg as a paddle. Both occurrences had skeletal remains and a sign of respect to the deceased from Jack. In the first, it was skeletal pirates hanging from the rocks at Port Royal, and Jack solemnly salutes them as he passes. In the second, it is a skeletal leg that Jack uses as a paddle, with the words, "Sorry, mate."
* Pintel says "'Ello Poppet" to Elizabeth as he did in the first film.
* At the end of the first film Jack tells Norrington he was rooting for him.  In the second film Jack says he's still rooting for him.
* When Jack takes Elizabeth hostage in ''Curse of the Black Pearl'', he remarks, "I knew you'd warm up to me." When Norrington attempts to stop Will from stabbing Davy Jones' heart in ''Dead Man's Chest'', Jack begins to say the same line before Norrington turns on him as well.
* After being knocked out by the oar swung by Jack, Will recovers on the Black Pearl while Elizabeth watches over him, recalling how they met in the first film.
* In the first movie, Barbossa looks at a ship through a telescope and Jack jumps right in front of him. In the second movie, Jack is looking at a ship through a telescope and Davy Jones appears right in front of him.
* In the first movie, Jack and Will find Gibbs lying unconscious in a sty. Norrington ends up in the same position after the bar fight and being knocked unconscious by Elizabeth.
* After the Kraken destroys the boat Will escapes to, he is seen climbing onto a plank of wood, recalling the way he was found as a child in the first movie.
* Also, this makes three times Will survives boat wrecks (four counting the Black Pearl) after this movie, with the writers of the DVD commentary saying that obviously Will has "a touch of destiny" in him.
*Norrington refers to Will as Elizabeth's "latest fiance," which is a reference to the fact that Norrington was Elizabeth's fiance in the first movie.
*Jack saves Elizabeth once in both films with a single shot: 
:*When Barbossa has his gun shot aimed at her, Jack shoots Barbossa, as a distraction so Will can lift the curse off of the crew.
:*Elizabeth loses the gun to shoot the barrels that will explode and hurt the Kraken; Jack takes the gun from her, and as her arms are wrapped around his legs, he fires, injuring the Kraken's tentacles.
*Elizabeth loses a dress in both movies:
:*When she falls off the cliff and Jack rescues her, he rips off her dress to make it easier, and it floats to the bottom.
:*When she stows away on the merchant ship and later leaves, she leaves the dress behind and it is lost when the Kraken attacks.
When Pintel and Ragetti salvage the black pearl they climb up the ropes in the same way they climbed the ropes on the interceptor in the first film
