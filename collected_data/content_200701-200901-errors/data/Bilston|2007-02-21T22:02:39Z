'''Bilston''' is a town in [[England]]'s [[West Midlands county|West Midlands]].  It is the south-eastern corner of the Metropolitan Borough and City of [[Wolverhampton]].  Two [[Ward (politics)|wards]] of Wolverhampton City Council cover the town: [[Bilston East]] and [[Bilston North]].

==History==
Bilston was first mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as a village called ''Billestune'', being a largely rural area until the [[nineteenth century]].  Situated just two miles south-east of Wolverhampton, it was extensively developed for factories and [[coal]]mining.  Many houses were constructed in the Bilston area.  Between [[1920]] and [[1966]], the council replaced most of the nineteenth century [[terraced house]]s with rented modern houses and flats on developments like Stowlawn, The Lunt and Bunker's Hill.  Bilston has had a [[market]] in the town centre for many years.

A Bilston [[Urban District]] Council was formed in [[1894]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] covering the ancient parish of Bilston.   The urban district was granted a [[Royal Charter]] in 1933, becoming a [[municipal borough]] and the First Charter Mayor was Alderman Herbert Beach.  In 1966 the borough of Bilston was abolished, with most of its territory annexed to the [[county borough]] of Wolverhampton (see [[History of West Midlands]]).

Bilston's Town Hall is presently being refurbished.  It had been derelict since the 1990s after Wolverhampton Council discontinued its use as Housing Offices.  It is hoped that the Town Hall will be brought back into public use follwing the completion of its refurbishment.

==People==
On June 6th 1862, Bilston was the birthplace of the poet [[Sir Henry Newbolt]].

[[John Wilkinson (industrialist)]], "king of the ironmasters," built a blast furnace in Bilston in 1748. He lived and died in [[Bradley, West Midlands]]. His body was returned to his home town of Cumbria.

[[Carl M. Cox]], media entrepreneur and record producer, was born at Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital and grew up in [[Bradley, West Midlands]] attending Wilkinson Primary School (1984-1990).  The school, named after the aforesaid [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)]], was locally renowned for its traditional and strictly imposed uniform, including the mandatory wearing of knee length shorts for all boys.

==Transport==
From [[1850]] to [[1972]] there was a [[railway]] station in Bilston town centre, but passenger services were then withdrawn and the line via Bilston (from Wolverhampton to [[West Bromwich]]) had been almost completely abandoned within a decade. The final stub of the railway, connecting a town centre scrapyard with the [[South Staffordshire Line]] at [[Wednesbury]], closed in [[1992]], only to be re-opened [[1999|seven years later]] as the first phase of the [[Midland Metro]] [[tram]] line between Wolverhampton and [[Birmingham]]. Bilston is served by [[Bilston Central tram stop|Bilston Central]], Loxdale and [[The Crescent tram stop|The Crescent]] [[tram stop]]s.

Another significant development in the Bilston area was the [[A463 road|A463]] [[Black Country Route]]. With more and more cars on the road, the roads around Bilston town centre became increasingly congested as the [[twentieth century]] progressed. It became so severe that, by the late [[1960s]], the government had drawn up plans for a new [[dual carriageway]] bypassing Bilston (and running from the [[A4123 road|A4123]] near [[Coseley]] to Junction 10 of the [[M6 motorway]] at [[Walsall]]) which was scheduled to be completed by [[1976]]. However, the plans collapsed and Bilston was condemned to increased congestion, for another decade at least.

The plans for a new dual carriageway were revived in the early [[1980s]]. This time the planners had decided on a slightly different route which would run much closer to Bilston town centre. The first phase of the road (to be known as Black County Route) was completed in [[1986]], though initially running around half a mile east of the A4123. It was extended in [[1991]] to Oxford Street in Bilston town centre. This expansion resulted in a number of buildings being demolished and some roads having to be re-routed while one road (Market Street) was completely obliterated. This new road changed the face of Bilston town centre forever.

During [[1995]], the final phase of the Black Country Route between Bilston town centre and Junction 10 of the M6 was completed. This new road has seen a major improvement in the traffic flow around Bilston town centre.
