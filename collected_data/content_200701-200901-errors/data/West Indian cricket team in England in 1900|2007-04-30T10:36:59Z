The '''West Indian cricket team''' toured '''England''' for [[cricket]] matches in the '''[[1900 English cricket season|1900 season]]'''.

The team played 17 matches between [[11 June]] and [[11 August]] [[1900]]. The [[Marylebone Cricket Club|M.C.C.]] ruled the matches as not first class. 10 of the matches were against counties in the Championship and they also played London County who were also [[first class cricket|first class]] at that time.

==Touring team==

The 15 players that eventually made up the team consisted of:

*[[Aucher Warner|R.S.A. Warner]], Trinidad, Captain
*W. Bowring, Barbados
*W.T. Burton, British Guiana, a Professional
*[[Lebrun Constantine|L.S. Constantine]], Trinidad
*[[Percy Cox (cricketer)|P.I. Cox]], Barbados
*L.S. D'Ade, Trinidad
*P.A. Goodman, Barbados
*D.C.S. Hinds, Barbados
*M.M. Kerr, Jamaica
*[[Gilbert Livingston (cricketer)|G.V. Livingston]], Jamaica
*G.C. Learmond, British Guiana
*W.H. Mignon, Grenada
*[[Charles Ollivierre|C.A. Ollivierre]], St. Vincent
*S.W. Sproston, British Guiana
*J. Woods, Trinidad, a Professional

W.C. Nock of Trinidad was the manager. Sproston acted a captain in the absense of [[Aucher Warner]]. [[Plum Warner|P.F. Warner]] played in 1 match. R.S.A. Warner and P.F. Warner were brothers.

Cricket page 44 gives what is presumably the original list of 14 selections and 4 reserves. The selections includes H.A. Cole (Barbados) and G.B.Y. Cox (Barbados). Of the reserves P.I. Cox and Livingston made the final team, the other reserves being W.E. Goodman (British Guiana) and F.L. Pearce (Jamaica). R.S.A. Warner is not mentioned.

Cricket page 130 has an anonymous letter giving further details following a metting in Barbados on April 17th. A letter had been received from British Guiana indicating that Sproston was unable to accompany the team, although this eventually turned out not to be the case. A letter was received from Jamaica suggesting that Livingston should go in Cole's place, this being agreed to. Further a letter was received from Mr. Aucher Warner offering his services as captain in accordance with the West Indies Cricket Committee in London. This offer was accepted and Bowring the original captain was to tour as an ordinary member. The team given also excludes P.I. Cox who did eventually take part in the tour.

H.B.G. Austin was unable to tour as he was fighting in South Africa.

The majority of the team was white. Burton and Woods were, of course, black as were Constantine, Hinds (?) and Olivierre amongst the Amateurs.

==Preliminaries==

The Trinidad contingent sailed from Port of Spain on [[May 24]] on R.M.S. Eden where they met the other tourists. On the day of their departure they were entertained at luncheon at the Ice House by the Barbados Commitee. They left Barbados on R.M.S. Trent on [[May 26]] and after a record journey arrived in Southampton on [[June 6]].

The tourists had a few days practice on the Hampshire ground and then travelled up to London to start their first match on [[June 11]].
