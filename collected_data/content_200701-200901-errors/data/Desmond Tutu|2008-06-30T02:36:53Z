'''Desmond Mpilo Tutu''' (born [[7 October]] [[1931]]) is a [[South Africa]]n [[cleric]] and activist who rose to [[worldwide]] fame during the 1980s as an opponent of [[History of South Africa in the Apartheid Era|apartheid]].  Tutu was elected and ordained the first black South African [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Cape Town]], South Africa, and [[Primate (religion)|primate]] of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa (now the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]]). He is generally credited with coining the term [[Rainbow Nation]] as a metaphor for post-apartheid [[South Africa]] after 1994 under [[African National Congress]] rule. The expression has since entered mainstream consciousness to describe South Africa's ethnic diversity. 

Tutu is widely regarded as "South Africa's moral conscience"<ref name = usazim>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-03-16-tutu-zimbabwe_N.htm |title=Archbishop Desmond Tutu lambasts African silence on Zimbabwe|date= 2007|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref> and has been described by former President of South Africa, [[Nelson Mandela]], as "sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid and seldom without humour, Desmond Tutu's voice will always be the voice of the voiceless".<ref name=noway/> Tutu chaired the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] and is currently the chairman of [[Global Elders|The Elders]]. Tutu is vocal in his defence of human rights and uses his high profile to campaign for the oppressed. He is committed to stopping global [[AIDS]] and has served as the honorary chairman for the Global AIDS Alliance. He received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1984, the [[Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism]], and the Magubela prize for liberty in 1986. In February 2007 he was awarded the [[Gandhi Peace Prize]] by [[Abdul Kalam|Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam]], President of [[India]]. Tutu has also compiled several books of his speeches and sayings.

==Early years==
Desmond Mpilo Tutu was born in [[Klerksdorp]], [[Transvaal]] on [[7 October]], [[1931]], the second of the three children of Zacheriah Zililo Tutu and his wife, Aletta, although the only son.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ccds.charlotte.nc.us/History/Africa/02/miller/miller.htm| title = Desmond Tutu - A Man with a Mission|first = Lindsay|last = Miller|accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref> Tutu's family moved to [[Johannesburg]] when he was 12 years old where his father was a teacher and his mother a cleaner and cook at a school for the blind.<ref name = presentation>{{cite web|url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1984/presentation-speech.html|title = Presentation Speech of 1984 Nobel Prize for Peace|publisher= The Nobel Foundation |first = Egil|last = Aarvik|date =1984 |accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref> Here he met [[Trevor Huddleston]] who was a parish priest in the black slum of [[Sophiatown]] and later Tutu's mentor. "One day", says Tutu, "I was standing in the street with my mother when a white man in a priest's clothing walked past. As he passed us he took off his hat to my mother. I couldn't believe my eyes - a white man who greeted a black working class woman!"<ref name=presentation/>  

Although Tutu wanted to become a [[physician]], his family could not afford the training, and he followed his father's footsteps into [[teaching]]. Tutu studied at the Pretoria Bantu Normal College from 1951 through 1953, and went on to teach at Johannesburg Bantu High School and at Munsienville High School in [[Mogale City]]. However, he resigned following the passage of the [[Bantu Education Act]], in protest of the poor educational prospects for black South Africans. He continued his studies, this time in [[theology]], at St Peter's Theology College in Rosettenville and in 1960 was ordained as an [[Anglican]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] following in the footsteps of his mentor and fellow activist, [[Trevor Huddleston]]. 
 
Tutu then travelled to [[King's College London]], (1962–1966), where he received his [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree]]s in Theology. During this time he worked as a part-time curate, first at [[St Albans Cathedral]] and then at St. Mary's in [[Bletchingley]], Surrey. He later returned to South Africa and from 1967 until 1972 used his lectures to highlight the circumstances of the African population. He wrote a letter to [[B.J. Vorster|Prime Minister Vorster]], in which he described the situation in South Africa as a "[[gunpowder|powder barrel]] that can explode at any time."  The letter was never answered. He became [[chaplain]] at the [[University of Fort Hare]] in 1967, a hotbed of dissent and one of the few quality universities for African students in the southern part of Africa. From 1970 to 1972, Tutu lectured at the [[National University of Lesotho]] .

Tutu faced a difficult balancing act: voicing black discontent while leading a largely white parish. Alternately charming and challenging them, he appealed to their Afrikaner heritage, recalling that their forebears had endured British concentration camps. Somewhat to the bewilderment of other black leaders, he patiently courted Vorster’s successor, [[P. W. Botha]], explaining that even [[Moses]] continued to reason with Pharaoh. But white liberals grew nervous when Tutu called for a boycott of South African products.<ref name=tutustory/> In 1972 Tutu returned to the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where he was appointed vice-director of the Theological Education Fund of the [[World Council of Churches]], at [[Bromley]] in [[Kent]]. He returned to South Africa in 1975 and was appointed Anglican [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Johannesburg]]—the first African person to hold that position. 

===Personal life===
On [[2 July]] [[1955]], Tutu married Nomalizo Leah Shenxane, a teacher who had met while at college. They had four children:  Trevor Thamsanqa Tutu, Theresa Thandeka Tutu, Naomi Nontombi Tutu and Mpho Andrea Tutu, all of whom attended the [[Waterford Kamhlaba]] School in [[Swaziland]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.helpkids.org.za/pages.php?id=26|publisher = Cape Town Child Welfare|title = Our Patron - Archbishop Desmond Tutu|accessdate = 2008-06-06}}</ref> 

His son, Trevor Tutu, caused a bombscare at [[East London Airport]] in 1989 and was arrested. In 1991 he was convicted of contravening the Civil Aviation Act by falsely claiming there had been a bomb on board a [[South African Airways]] 'plane at East London Airport.<ref name = freed>{{cite news|title = Trevor Tutu freed from prison after being granted amnesty|url = http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/media/1997/9711/s971128s.htm|date = 1997-11-28|publisher = SAPA|accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref> The bomb threat delayed the [[Johannesburg]] bound flight for more than three hours, costing [[South African Airways]] some R28000. At the time Trevor Tutu announced his intention to appeal against his sentence, but failed to arrive for the appeal hearings. He forfeited his bail of R15000.<ref name=freed/> He was due to begin serving his sentence in 1993, but failed to hand himself over to prison authorities. He was finally arrested in [[Johannesburg]] in August 1997. He applied for amnesty from the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] which was granted in 1997. He was then released from Goodwood Prison in [[Cape Town]] where he had begun serving his three-and-a-half year prison sentence after a court in [[East London]] refused to grant him bail.<ref>{{cite news|title = Tutu's son in amnesty bid |url = http://www.dispatch.co.za/1997/09/27/page%209.htm| publisher = Dispatch|date = 1997-09-27|accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref> 

His daughter, Naomi Tutu, founded the Tutu Foundation for Development and Relief in Southern Africa, based in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. She has followed in her father's footsteps as a human rights activist and is currently a program coordinator for the Race Relations Institute at [[Fisk University]], in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://dept.kent.edu/violence_symposium/naomi_tutu.htm| title = Nontombi Naomi Tutu|accessdate = 2008-06-01|publisher = Kent State University}}</ref> His other daughter, Mpho Tutu, has also followed her father's footsteps and in 2004 was ordained an [[Episcopal]] priest by her father.<ref>{{cite web|title = Reverend Mpho Tutu|publisher = 2004 Women of Distinction|accessdate = 2008-06-01|date = 2004|url = http://pages.interlog.com/~saww/2004Mpho.html}}</ref> She is also the founder and executive director of the Tutu Institute for Prayer and Pilgrimage and the chairperson of the board of the Global AIDS Alliance.<ref>{{cite web|title = The Reverend Mpho A.

In 1997, Tutu was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and underwent successful treatment in the US. He subsequently became patron of the South African Prostate Cancer Foundation which was established in 2007.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.prostatecancerfoundation.co.za/A_Aboutus_Media.asp |title=Taking the fight against prostate cancer to South Africans|date=2007-03-03|publisher=Prostate Cancer Foundation of South Africa|accessdate=2008-04-23}}</ref>

==Tutu's role during Apartheid==
{{Apartheid}}
In 1976 protests in [[Soweto]], also known as the [[Soweto Riots]], against the government's use of [[Afrikaans]] as a compulsory medium of instruction in black schools became a massive uprising against apartheid.  From then on Tutu supported an economic [[boycott]] of his country. He vigorously opposed the "constructive engagement" policy of the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration in the United States, which advocated "friendly persuasion". Tutu rather supported disinvestment, although it hit the poor hardest for if disinvestment threw blacks out of work, Tutu argued, at least they would be suffering "with a purpose". Disinvestment did succeed, causing the value of the Rand to plunge and pressuring the government toward reform. Tutu pressed the advantage and organised peaceful marches which brought thirty thousand people onto the streets of [[Cape Town]]. That was the turning point: within months, [[Nelson Mandela]] was freed from prison, and apartheid was beginning to crumble.<ref name=tutustory>{{cite web |url=http://www.christiancentury.org/article.lasso?id=2441|author=Wood, Lawrence|title=Tutu's story|date=2006-10-17| publisher=The Christian Century|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>  

Desmond Tutu was [[Bishop]] of [[Lesotho]] from 1976 until 1978, when he became [[Secretary-General]] of the [[South African Council of Churches]]. From this position, he was able to continue his work against apartheid with agreement from nearly all churches. Tutu consistently advocated [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]] between all parties involved in apartheid through his writings and lectures at home and abroad. Tutu's opposition was vigorous and unequivocal, and he was outspoken both in South Africa and abroad, often comparing apartheid to [[Nazism]] and [[Communism]]. As a result the government twice revoked his passport, and he was jailed briefly in 1980 after a protest march. It was thought by many that Tutu's increasing international reputation and his rigorous advocacy of non-violence protected him from harsher penalties. Tutu was also harsh in his criticism of the violent tactics of some anti-apartheid groups such as the [[African National Congress]] and denounced [[terrorism]] and [[Communism]]. When a new constitution was proposed for South Africa in 1983 to defend against the anti-apartheid movement, Bishop Tutu helped form the National Forum Committee to fight the constitutional changes.<ref>{{cite book|first = Desmond|last = Tutu|title = The Rainbow People of God: The Making of a Peaceful Revolution|publisher = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|date = 1994|place = New York}}</ref> 

In 1985, Tutu was appointed the Bishop of [[Johannesburg]] before he became the first black person to lead the Anglican Church in [[South Africa]] on [[7 September]] [[1986]] on the retirement of former Archbishop, [[Philip Welsford Richmond Russell]]. From 1987 to 1997 he was president of the All Africa Conference of Churches. In 1989 he was invited to [[Birmingham, England|Birmingham]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]] as part of Citywide Christian Celebrations.  Tutu and his wife visited a number of establishments including the [[Nelson Mandela]] School in [[Sparkbrook]].

Tutu was considered as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1990, however [[George Carey]] was chosen in his stead. Tutu has commented that he is "glad" that he was not chosen as once installed in [[Lambeth Palace]], he would have been homesick for South Africa, unhappy to be away from home during a critical time in the country's history.<ref>{{cite news|title = Tutu calls for church reform| publisher = BBC| date = 2002-06-10| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/2036677.stm |accessdate = 2008-01-23}}</ref> 

In 1990, Tutu and the ex-Vice Chancellor of the [[University of the Western Cape]] Professor Jakes Gerwel founded the Desmond Tutu Educational Trust. The Trust was established to fund developmental programmes in tertiary education and provides capacity building at 17 historically disadvantaged institutions. Tutu's work as a mediator in order to prevent all-out racial war was evident at the funeral of [[South African Communist Party]] leader [[Chris Hani]] in 1993. Tutu spurred a crowd of 120,000 to repeat after him the chants, over and over: "We will be free!", "All of us!", "Black and white together!" and finished his speech saying:
<blockquote>
"We are the rainbow people of God! We are unstoppable! Nobody can stop us on our march to victory! No one, no guns, nothing! Nothing will stop us, for we are moving to freedom! We are moving to freedom and nobody can stop us! For God is on our side!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1945580,00.html |author=Carlin, John|title=Former aide John Allen’s authorised biography offers an intimate view of Desmond Tutu|date=2006-11-12| publisher=The Observer|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>
</blockquote>

In 1993, he was a patron of the Cape Town Olympic Bid Committee. In 1994 he was an appointed a patron of the World Campaign Against Military and Nuclear Collaboration with South Africa, Beacon Millennium and Action from Ireland. In 1995 he was appointed a Chaplain and Sub-Prelate of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]],<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=54002|startpage=5286|date=[[7 April]] [[1995]]|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> and he became a patron of the American Harmony Child Foundation and the Hospice Association of Southern Africa.

==Tutu's role since Apartheid==
[[Image:Desmond Tutu Quilt.jpg|thumb|left|This quilt by Hollis Chatelain features Tutu surrounded by children.]]
After the fall of apartheid, Tutu headed the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]]. He retired as [[Archbishop of Cape Town]] in 1996 and was succeeded by [[Njongonkulu Ndungane]]. At a thanksgiving for Desmond Tutu upon his retirement as Archbishop in 1996, [[Nelson Mandela]] said: <blockquote>
His joy in our diversity and his spirit of forgiveness are as much part of his immeasurable contribution to our nation as his passion for justice and his solidarity with the poor.<ref name = noway>{{cite web|url = http://www.racismnoway.com.au/classroom/factsheets/42.html |title = Fact Sheet: Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu|Publisher = Racism. No Way.|date = 2006-01-19|accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Since his retirement, Tutu has worked as a global activist on issues pertaining to democracy, freedom and human rights. In 2006, Tutu launched a global campaign, organised by [[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan]], to ensure that all children were registered at birth, as an unregistered child did not officially exist and was vulnerable to traffickers and during disasters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4289393.stm |title=Tutu calls for child registration|date= 2005-02-22| publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> 

===Role in South Africa===
Since his retirement, Tutu has worked to critique the new South African government. Tutu has been vocal in condemnation of corruption, the ineffectiveness of the [[ANC]]-led government to deal with poverty, and the recent outbreaks of xenophobic violence in townships across South Africa. 

After a decade of freedom for [[South Africa]], Archbishop Tutu was honoured with the invitation to deliver the annual Nelson Mandela Foundation Lecture. On [[November 23]], [[2004]] Tutu was given the address entitled, "Look to the Rock from Which You Were Hewn."  This lecture, critical of the [[African National Congress|ANC]]-controlled government, stirred a pot of controversy between Tutu and [[Thabo Mbeki]], calling into question "the right to criticise."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nu.ac.za/ccs/default.asp?3,28,10,1763|title=Controversy: Tutu, Mbeki & the freedom to criticise|date= 2005|author=Tutu, Mbeki & others |publisher=Centre for Civil Society |accessdate=}}</ref> 

He made a stinging attack against South Africa's political elite, saying the country was "sitting on a powder keg"<ref name=keg>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4035809.stm |title=Tutu warns of poverty 'powder keg'|date= 2004-11-23 |publisher=BBC|accessdate=}}</ref> because of its failure to alleviate poverty a decade after apartheid's end. Tutu also said that attempts to boost black economic ownership were only benefiting an elite minority, while political "kowtowing" within the ruling ANC was hampering democracy. Tutu asked, "What is black empowerment when it seems to benefit not the vast majority but an elite that tends to be recycled?"<ref name=keg/> 

The archbishop criticised politicians for debating whether to give the poor an income grant of $16 (£12) a month and said the idea should be seriously considered. Tutu has often spoken in support of the Basic Income Grant (BIG) which has so far been defeated in parliament. After the first round of volleys were fired, [[South African Press Association]] [[journalist]], [[Ben Maclennan]] reported Tutu's response as: "Thank you Mr President for telling me what you think of me, that I am--a liar with scant regard for the truth, and a charlatan posing with his concern for the poor, the hungry, the oppressed and the voiceless."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.armsdeal-vpo.co.za/quotes.html|title=Quotes of the Week|author=Maclennan, Ben|date= 2004-12-02|publisher=Sapa|accessdate=}}</ref>

Tutu warned of corruption shortly after the re-election of the [[African National Congress]] government of South Africa, saying that they "stopped the gravy train just long enough to get on themselves."."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mandela/interviews/tutu.html|first=John|last = Carlin |title=Interview with Tutu|date= |publisher=PBS Frontline|accessdate=2006-09-07}}</ref> In August 2006 Archbishop Tutu publicly urged [[Jacob Zuma]], the South African politician who had been accused of sexual crimes and corruption, to drop out of the ANC's presidential succession race. He said in a public lecture that he would not be able to hold his "head high" if Zuma became leader after being accused both of rape and corruption. In September 2006, Tutu repeated his opposition to Zuma's candidacy as ANC leader due to Zuma's "moral failings"."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5384310.stm |title=S Africa is losing its way - Tutu|date= 2006-09-27|publisher=BBC|accessdate=}}</ref> 

The head of the Congress of South African Students condemned Tutu as a "loose cannon" and a "scandalous man" — a reaction which prompted an angry Mbeki to side with Tutu.  Zuma's personal advisor responded by accusing Tutu of having double standards and "selective amnesia" (as well as being old). Elias Khumalo claims the archbishop "had found it so easy to accept the apology from the apartheid government that committed unspeakable atrocities against millions of South Africans", yet now "cannot find it in his heart to accept the apology from this humble man who has erred". Tutu and Zuma’s public criticism of each other are reflections of a turbulent time in South African politics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=282735&area=/insight/insight__national/|title=Zuma camp lashes out at 'old' Tutu|publisher+[[Mail & Guardian]]|date=[[2006-09-01]]|accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref>

Tutu has condemned the xenophobic violence which occurred throughout South Africa in May 2008. Tutu, who once intervened in the apartheid years to prevent a mob necklacing a man, said that when South Africans were fighting against apartheid they had been supported by people around the world and particularly in Africa. Although they were poor, other Africans welcomed South Africans as refugees, and allowed liberation movements to have bases in their territory even if it meant those countries were going to be attacked by the South African Defence force. Tutu called on South Africans to end the violence as thousands of refugees have sought refuge in shelters.<ref>{{cite news|title = 'Please, please stop'|publisher = News24|date = 2008-05-19|url = http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_2325358,00.html|accessdate = 2008-05-31}}</ref>

===Chairman of The Elders===
On [[18 July]] [[2007]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Graça Machel]], and [[Desmond Tutu]] convened [[Global Elders|The Elders]], a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom, leadership and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems.  Mandela announced its formation in a speech on his 89th birthday. Archbishop Tutu is serving as its Chair. Other founding members include [[Kofi Annan]], [[Ela Bhatt]], [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Li Zhaoxing]], [[Mary Robinson]], [[Muhammad Yunus]] and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], whose chair was left symbolically empty due to her confinement as a [[political prisoner]] in [[Burma]].

"This group can speak freely and boldly, working both publicly and behind the scenes on whatever actions need to be taken,” Mandela commented.  “Together we will work to support courage where there is fear, foster agreement where there is conflict, and inspire hope where there is despair."<ref>{{cite press release|url = http://theelders-news.blogspot.com/2008/01/for-immediate-release-july-18-2007.html|publisher= The Elders|date = 2007-07-18|accessdate = 2008-06-06|title = Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu Announce The Elders}}</ref> The Elders will be independently funded by a group of Founders, including [[Richard Branson]], [[Peter Gabriel]], Ray Chambers, [[Michael Chambers]], Bridgeway Foundation, Pam [[Omidyar]], Humanity United, [[Amy Robbins]], [[Shashi Ruia]], Dick Tarlow and the [[United Nations Foundation]].

===Role in the Third World===
[[Image:Desmond Tutu and Brad Pitt.jpg|thumb|Tutu and [[Brad Pitt]] on the cover of [[Vanity Fair]]]]
Tutu has focused on drawing awareness to issues such as poverty, AIDS and non-democratic governments in the Third World. In particular he has focused on issues in [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Palestine]]. Tutu also led The Elders' first mission to travel to [[Sudan]] in September-October 2007 to foster peace in the [[Darfur crisis]]. "Our hope is that we can keep Darfur in the spotlight and spur on governments to help keep peace in the region," said Tutu.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/0,,2-11_2236256,00.html |title=Tutu denounces rights abuses|date= 2007-12-10|publisher=News24|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> 

Tutu has also been vocal in his condemnation of Chinese crackdowns on Tibetan activists. Tutu spoke at a candle-lit vigil on the eve of the [[San Francisco]] relay. Tutu does not support a full boycott of the Olympic Games, but he has called on the heads of States worldwide to not attend the Opening Ceremonies of the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cbs5.com/video/?id=32966@kpix.dayport.com|title=Raw Video: Desmont Tutu On SF Torch Relay|publisher=CBS|date=2008-04-08|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

====Zimbabwe====
Tutu has been vocal in his criticism of human rights abuses in [[Zimbabwe]] as well as the [[South Africa]]n government's policy of quiet diplomacy towards Zimbabwe. In 2007 he said the "quiet diplomacy" pursued by the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) had "not worked at all" and he called on Britain and the West to pressure [[SADC]], including South Africa, which was chairing talks between President Mugabe's [[Zanu-PF]] party and the opposition [[Movement for Democratic Change]], to set firm deadlines for action, with consequences if they were not met.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/09/19/wtutu119.xml|title=Zimbabwe needs your help, Tutu tells Brown|date= 2007-09-19| publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref> Tutu has often criticized [[Robert Mugabe]] in the past and he once described the autocratic leader as "a cartoon figure of an archetypical African dictator".<ref name=usazim/> In 2008, he called for the international community to intervene in Zimbabwe - by force if necessary <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7479696.stm]</ref>. Mugabe, on the other hand, has called Tutu an "angry, evil and embittered little bishop".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article2631943.ece|title=Working with a rabble-rouser|date= 2007-10-10| author=John Allen|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

<blockquote>
We Africans should hang our heads in shame. How can what is happening in Zimbabwe elicit hardly a word of concern let alone condemnation from us leaders of Africa? After the horrible things done to hapless people in Harare, has come the recent crackdown on members of the opposition ... what more has to happen before we who are leaders, religious and political, of our mother Africa are moved to cry out "Enough is enough?".<ref name=timeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/people/special%20projects/tutu-d/timeline-tutu.html|title=Desmond Tutu Quotes|date= 2007| publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref>
</blockquote>

He has often stated that all leaders in Africa should condemn Zimbabwe: "What an awful blot on our copy book. Do we really care about human rights, do we care that people of flesh and blood, fellow Africans, are being treated like rubbish, almost worse than they were ever treated by rabid racists?"<ref name=usazim/> After the Zimbabwean presidential elections in April 2008, Tutu expressed his hope that Mugabe would step down after it was initially reported that Mugabe had lost the elections. Tutu reiterated his support of the democratic process and hoped that Mugabe would adhere to the voice of the people:

<blockquote>
That is democracy. Democracy is, you change government when people decide. I mean when your time is over, your time is over. We hope the transition will be a peaceful one, relatively peaceful, and that Mr Mugabe will step down with dignity, gracefully.<ref name=retire>{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=739329|title=‘Mugabe must step down with dignity’|date= 2008-04-02| publisher=The Times|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Tutu called Mugabe "someone we were very proud of", as he "did a fantastic job, and it’s such a great shame, because he had a wonderful legacy. If he had stepped down ten or so years ago he would be held in very, very high regard. And I still want to say we must honour him for the things that he did do, and just say what a shame."<ref name=retire/>

Tutu stated that he feared that riots would break out in Zimbabwe if the election results were ignored. He proposed that a peace-keeping force should be sent to the region to ensure stability. 
<blockquote>
Anything that would save the possibilities of bloodshed, of conflict, I am quite willing to support. The people of Zimbabwe have suffered enough, and we don’t...want any more possibilities of bloodshed.

===United Nations role===

However, Tutu has also criticised the UN, particularly on the issue of [[West Papua]]. Tutu expressed support for the [[West Papua]]n independence movement, criticizing the [[United Nations]]' role in the takeover of West Papua by [[Indonesia]].  Tutu said:  "For many years the people of South Africa suffered under the yoke of oppression and apartheid. Many people continue to suffer brutal oppression, where their fundamental dignity as human beings is denied. One such people is the people of West Papua."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://westpapuaaction.buz.org/unreview/|title = Statement by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, South Africa|publisher = West Papuan Action|date = 2004-02-23|accessdate = 2008-06-06}}</ref>

Tutu was named to head a United Nations fact-finding mission to the [[Gaza Strip]] town of [[Beit Hanoun]], where, in a [[Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident|November 2006 incident]] the [[Israel Defense Forces]] killed 19 civilians after troops wound up a week-long incursion aimed at curbing [[2006 Israel-Gaza conflict|Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel]] from the town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1162378513178 | title=Tutu to head UN rights mission to Gaza |date=2006-11-29| last = Slosberg  | first = Jacob| publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=}}</ref> Tutu planned to travel to the Palestinian territory to "assess the situation of victims, address the needs of survivors and make recommendations on ways and means to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli assaults," according to the president of the UN [[Human Rights Council]], [[Luis Alfonso De Alba]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1164881856613&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull| title=Israel may give no-no to Tutu's trip to Beit Hanun|date=2006-12-09| coauthors =Keinon, Herb | last = Hoffman| first = Gil| publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=}}</ref> Israeli officials expressed concern that the report would be biased against Israel.

===Political views===
====Against poverty====
Before the [[31st G8 summit]] at Gleneagles, [[Scotland]] in 2005, Tutu called on world leaders to promote free trade with poorer countries. Tutu also called on an end to expensive taxes on anti-AIDS drugs. Tutu said:
<blockquote>
"I would hope they would begin to say, 'lets to do something about subsidies'. You ask the so-called-developing world, 'Why can't you people produce more?' - and they produce - and then they find that the markets have barriers that are put down or are clobbered twice over."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4356821.stm |title=Archbishop Tutu calls for G8 help|date=2005-03-17|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref>
</blockquote>
Following this summit, the G8 leaders promised to increase aid to developing countries by $48bn a year by 2010. Further, they gave their word of honour that they would do the best they could to achieve universal access to prevention and treatment for the millions and millions of people globally threatened by HIV/AIDS.

Before the [[32nd G8 summit]] in [[Germany]] in 2007, Tutu called on the G8 to focus on poverty in the Third World. Following the [[Millennium Summit|United Nations Millennium Summit]] in 2000, it appeared that world leaders were determined as never before to set and meet specific goals regarding extreme poverty.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.worldaidscampaign.info/index.php/en/media__1/press_releases/desmond_tutu_keep_your_promises|title=Desmond Tutu: Keep your Promises|date=2006-10-19|publisher=World Aids Campaign|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>

====Against unilateralism====
[[Image:Desmond Tutu and George Bush.jpg|thumb|Tutu and USA President [[George W. Bush]] on the cover of ''[[Vanity Fair]]'']]
In January 2003, Tutu attacked British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair|Tony Blair's]] stance in supporting American President [[George W. Bush]] over Iraq. The alliance of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States of America]] led to the outbreak of the [[Iraq War]] later that year. Tutu asked why Iraq was being singled out when [[Europe]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] also had weapons of mass destruction. Tutu demanded:<blockquote>
"When does compassion, when does morality, when does caring come in? I just hope that one day that people will realise that peace is a far better path to follow. Many, many of us are deeply saddened to see a great country such as the United States aided and abetted extraordinarily by Britain. I have a great deal of time for your prime minister but I'm shocked to see a powerful country use its power frequently, unilaterally. The United States says you do this to the world, if you don't do it we will do it - that's sad."<ref>{{cite news|title = Tutu condemns Blair's Iraq stance| publisher = BBC| date = 2003-01-05|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2628607.stm|accessdate = 2008-01-23}}</ref> </blockquote>

In October 2004, Tutu appeared in a play at [[Off Broadway]], [[New York]] called ''[[Honor Bound to Defend Freedom|Guantanamo - Honour-bound to Defend Freedom]]''. This play was highly critical of the US handling of detainees at [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]]. Tutu played Lord Justice Steyn, a judge who questions the legal justification of the detention regime.<ref>{{cite news|title = Tutu in anti-Guantanamo theatre| publisher = BBC| date = 2004-10-02| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3709288.stm |accessdate = 2008-01-23}}</ref>

In January 2005, Tutu added his voice to the growing dissent over terrorist suspects held at [[Camp X-Ray]] in [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]], referring to detentions without trial as "utterly unacceptable." Tutu compared these detentions to those under Apartheid. Tutu also emphasised that when South Africa had used those methods the country had been condemned, however when powerful countries such as Britain and the United States of America had invoked such power the world was silent and in that silence accepted their methods even though they violated essential human rights. Tutu said:

<blockquote>The rule of law is in order to ensure that those who have power don't use their power arbitrarily and every person retains their human rights until you have proven conclusively that so-and-so is in fact guilty. Whilst we are saying thank you that these have been released, what is happening to those left behind? We in South Africa used to have a dispensation that detained people without trial and the world quite rightly condemned that as unacceptable. Now if it was unacceptable then how come it can be acceptable to Britain and the United States. It is so, so deeply distressing. I am opposed to any arbitrary detention that is happening, even in Britain.<ref>{{cite news|title = Tutu calls for Guantanamo release| publisher = BBC| date = 2005-01-12| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4167369.stm |accessdate = 2008-01-22}}</ref></blockquote>

In February 2006, Tutu repeated these statements after a UN report was published which called for the closure of the camp. Tutu stated that the [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]] camp was a stain on the character of the United States, while the legislation in Britain which gave a 28 day detention period for terror suspects was "excessive" and "untenable". Tutu pointed out that similar arguments were being made in Britain and the United States which the South African apartheid regime had used. "It is disgraceful and one cannot find strong enough words to condemn what Britain and the United States and some of their allies have accepted," said Tutu. Tutu also attacked Tony Blair's failed attempt to hold terrorist suspects in Britain for up to 90 days without charge. "Ninety days for a South African is an awful deja-vu because we had in South Africa in the bad old days a 90-day detention law," he said. Under apartheid, as at [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], people were held for "unconscionably long periods" and then released, he said. Tutu stated:<blockquote>
"Are you able to restore to those people the time when their freedom was denied them? If you have evidence for goodness sake produce it in a court of law. People with power have an incredible capacity for wanting to be able to retain that power and don't like scrutiny."<ref>{{cite news|title = Tutu calls for Guantanamo closure| publisher = BBC| date = 2006-02-17| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4723512.stm |accessdate = 2008-01-22}}</ref></blockquote>

In 2007, Tutu stated that the global "war on terror" could not be won if people were living in desperate conditions. Tutu said that the global disparity between rich and poor people creates instability.
<blockquote>
"You can never win a war against terror as long as there are conditions in the world that make people desperate - poverty, disease, ignorance, et cetera. I think people are beginning to realize that you can't have pockets of prosperity in one part of the world and huge deserts of poverty and deprivation and think that you can have a stable and secure world."<ref name = povertyterror>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/09/16/talkasia.tutu/|title=Tutu: Poverty fueling terror|date= 2007-09-16| publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>
</blockquote>

====Against HIV/AIDS and TB====
Tutu has been a tireless campaigner for health and human rights, and has been particularly vocal in support of controlling TB and HIV.<ref name=tbhiv>{{cite news|url=http://www.tbhiv-create.org/NewsUpdates/archbishop_desmond_tutu.htm|title=Archbischop Desmond Tutu urges TB/HIV workers to continue to relieve suffering from dual scourges|publisher=Desmond Tutu HIV Centre|date=2005-09-28|accessdate=2008-04-24}}</ref> In 2003 the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre was founded in [[Cape Town]], while the Desmond Tutu TB Centre was founded in 2003 at [[Stellenbosch University]]. Tutu suffered from TB in his youth and has been active in assisting those afflicted, especially as TB and HIV/Aids deaths have become intrinsically linked in South Africa. “Those of you who work to care for people suffering from AIDS and TB are wiping a tear from God’s eye,” Archbishop Tutu said.<ref name=tbhiv/>

On [[20 April]] [[2005]], after Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected as [[Pope Benedict XVI]], Tutu said he was sad that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was unlikely to change its opposition to [[condom]]s amidst the fight against [[HIV]]/AIDS in [[Africa]]: "We would have hoped for someone more open to the more recent developments in the world, the whole question of the ministry of women and a more reasonable position with regards to condoms and HIV/AIDS."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4463873.stm|title=Africans hail conservative Pope|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2005-04-20]]|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref>

In 2007, statistics were released that indicated HIV and AIDS numbers were lower than previously thought in South Africa. However, Tutu named these statistics "cold comfort" as it was unacceptable that 600 people died of AIDS in South Africa everyday. Tutu also rebuked the government for wasting time by discussing what caused HIV/Aids, which particularly attacks Mbeki and Health Minister [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]] for their [[AIDS denialism|denialist stance]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Aids_Focus/0,,2-7-659_2230486,00.html|title=Aids stats 'cold comfort'- Tutu|publisher=News24|date=2007-11-30|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref>

====Church reform====
In 2002, Tutu called for a reform of the [[Anglican Church]] in regard to how its leader, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is chosen. The ultimate appointment is made by the British Prime Minister and thus Tutu said that the selection process will only be properly democratic and representative when the link between church and state is broken. In February 2006 Tutu took part in the 9th Assembly of the [[World Council of Churches]], held in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]]. There he manifested his commitment to [[ecumenism]] and praised the efforts of Christian churches to promote dialogue to diminish their differences. For Tutu, "a united church is no optional extra."

In the debate about [[Anglican views of homosexuality]] he has opposed Christian discrimination against homosexuals.  Commenting days after the [[5 August]] [[2003]] election of [[Gene Robinson]], an openly [[gay]] man to be a bishop in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], Desmond Tutu said, "In our Church here in South Africa, that doesn't make a difference. We just say that at the moment, we believe that they should remain [[celibate]] and we don't see what the fuss is about."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gay.com/headlines/4846|title=Desmond Tutu: gay bishop row is just "fuss"|publisher=Gay.com UK|date=[[2006-08-11]]|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref> Tutu has remarked that it is sad the Church is spending time disagreeing on sexual orientation "when we face so many devastating problems – poverty, HIV/AIDS, war and conflict".<ref name = spero>{{cite news |url=http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idCategory=33&idsub=128&id=2141 |title=Tutu calls on Anglicans to accept gay bishop |publisher=Spero News |date=[[2005-11-14]] |accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref> 

Tutu has increased his criticism of conservative attitudes to homosexuality within his own church, equating [[homophobia]] with [[racism]]. Stating at a conference in Nairobi that he is "deeply disturbed that in the face of some of the most horrendous problems facing Africa, we concentrate on 'what do I do in bed with whom'".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-3528.html|title=Tutu stands up for gays|publisher=Pink News|date=2007-01-19|accessdate=}}</ref> In an interview with BBC Radio 4 on 18 November 2007, Archbishop Desmond Tutu accused the church of being obsessed with homosexuality and declared: "If God, as they say, is homophobic, I wouldn't worship that God."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7100295.stm |title=Desmond Tutu chides Church for gay stance |publisher=BBC|date=2007-11-18|accessdate=}}</ref>

===Academic role===
In 1998, he was appointed as the [[Robert W. Woodruff|Robert R Woodruff]] Visiting Professor at [[Emory University]], [[Atlanta]]. He returned to [[Emory University]] the following year as the William R Cannon Visiting Distinguished Professor. In 2000, he founded the Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation to raise funds for the Desmond Tutu Peace Centre in Cape Town. The following year he launched the Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation USA, which is designed to work with universities nationwide to create leadership academies emphasising peace, social justice and reconciliation. 

In 2001, the Desmond Tutu Educational Trust, with funding from the [[W.K. Kellogg Foundation]], launched the Desmond Tutu Footprints of the Legends Awards which recognises leadership in combating prejudice, human rights, research and poverty eradication. Since 2004, he has been a Visiting Professor at [[King's College London]], although in 2007, he joined 600 college students and sailed around the world with [[Semester at Sea]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=621 |title=Nobel Peace Prize Winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu to Sail with Semester at Sea for Entire Spring Semester|date=2006-09-26|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=2008-01-05}}</ref>

On [[16 October]] [[1984]], Tutu was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].  The Nobel Committee cited his "role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa."<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1984/press.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize for 1984|publisher=[[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref> This was seen as a gesture of support for him and The South African Council of Churches which he led at that time.

Walker Distinguished Humanitarian Service Award]]. 

In June 1999, Tutu was invited to give the annual Wilberforce Lecture in [[Kingston upon Hull]], commemorating the life and achievements of the anti-slavery campaigner [[William Wilberforce]]. Tutu used the occasion to praise the people of the city for their traditional support of freedom and for standing with the people of South Africa in their fight against apartheid. He was also presented with the [[freedom of the city]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.wilberforcelecturetrust.co.uk/index.php/lectures/lecture-detail/1999-lecture-by-archbishop-desmond-tutu/|title = 1999 Lecture: Archbishop Desmond Tutu|accessdate = 2008-06-06|publisher = Wilberforce Lecture Trust}}</ref>

Tutu has been awarded the ''freedom of the city'' in cities in [[Italy]], [[Wales]], [[England]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. He has received numerous doctorates and fellowships at distinguished universities. He has been named a Grand Officer of the [[Légion d'honneur]] by France, Germany has awarded him the Order of Merit Grand Cross, while he received the [[Sydney Peace Prize]] in 1999. He is also the recipient of the [[Gandhi Peace Prize]], the King Hussein Prize and the Marion Doenhoff Prize for International Reconciliation and Understanding.

==Writings==
Tutu has contributed to the field of [[social psychology]]. His writing appeared in Greater Good Magazine, published by the [[Greater Good Science Center]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  His contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships. His most recent article with Greater Good magazine is titled: "Why to Forgive", which examines how forgiveness is not only personally rewarding, but also politically necessary in allowing South Africa to have a new beginning. However, Tutu states that forgiveness is not turning a blind eye to wrongs; true reconciliation exposes the awfulness, the abuse, the pain, the hurt, the truth. It could even sometimes make things worse. It is a risky undertaking but in the end it is worthwhile, because in the end only an honest confrontation with reality can bring healing.
