'''Churches affiliated with Australian Christian Churches''' refers to churches that are apart of [[Australian Christian Churches]], the Australian organisation of the [[Assemblies of God]] (AOG), a [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]] originating in the [[United States|United States of America]]. There are over 1,100 churches in Australian Christian Churches that represent 180,000 adherents across Australia. Member churches work together to provide support for each other and cooperate in [[evangelism|evangelisation]].

==Church names==

When the Assemblies of God in Australia was incorporated in 1937, churches generally were the name of the location and then the words ''Assembly of God''. For example, the AOG church in [[Paradise, South Australia|Paradise]] was called ''Paradise Assembly of God'' (the church is now [[Paradise Community Church]]). When [[Frank Houston]] moved to Australia in 1977 to plant a church in [[Sydney]], he called his church ''[[Sydney Christian Life Centre]]''. From his church, Houston planted several others with the ''Christian Life Centre'' name. 

From the 1990s onwards, there has been a large change in the naming of AOG churches. Many churches with ''Assembly of God'' (AOG) or ''Christian Life Centre'' (CLC) in their name, changed their name to make it shorter and more generic. Many churches have replaced AOG and CLC with ''Christian Church'' or ''Christian Centre''. For example, ''Mt. Gravatt Assembly of God'' became ''[[Garden City Christian Church]]''. Another trend is for churches to change their name to a popular name or word that represents the church. For example, ''Hills Christian Life Centre'' became ''[[Hillsong Church]]'' once the name ''Hillsong'' became more well-known than the church name.

==Church style==

Churches in Australian Christian Churches are known for their [[Pentecostal]] stlye services that involve contemporary praise and worship, speaking in tongues, lifting of hands in worship and biblical princibles teaching. AOG churches were originally seen to be cult like and strange, as they were very different to other evangelical churches. However, as other evangelical churches have evolved, AOG churches have become the forefront of the contemporary church.

===Praise and worship===

While Australian Christian Churches use a wide range of worship styes, generally churches use contemporary prasie and worship music for services. From using [[Hymn]]s in the 1930s to 1950s, music from the [[Jesus movement]] in the 1960s and 1970s and the [[Contemporary Christian worship|contemporary praise and worship]] of the 1980s to today, AOG churches have continualy adapted to new styles of praise and worship.

In recent decades, churches affiliated with Australian Christian Churches have revolutionised church praise and worship. The largest driving force for this change is the popularity of [[Hillsong Music]] of [[Hillsong Church]]. Other influences are [[Planetshakers]], [[Hillsong United (band)|Hillsong United]], [[Youth Alive]] and [[Paradise Community Church]]. Many ACC churches have released albums containing songs written in the church.

==Megachurches==

Most of the megachurches in Australia are affiliated with Australian Christian Churches. In the 1970s and 1980s, the largest churches in the movement were Garden City Christian Church and Paradise Community Church. In the 1990s, Hillsong Church became the largest church in the movement and also in Australia. Today there are 10 Assemblies of God churches that are classified as [[megachurch]]es with over 2,000 attending each weekend.
