Producers contracted seven studios to animate the first season. An international team handled digital post-production and QuestWorld scenes, while [[Japan]]ese and [[Korea]]n animators drew traditional [[cel]] sequences.<ref name="animag" /> Over a quarter of the first season's footage was digitally inked and painted "to enhance the background and the atmospheric elements."<ref name="animag" /> Producers applied the process "in excess of 20 hours per episode...just for effects...We added light effects, rain, snow, glitter, reflections, fog, [which] made things much more realistic."<ref name="animag" /> Japan-based Mook Studios exclusively animated the second season.<ref name="anipla" /> Several [[composer]]s wrote incidental music and cues, and Gary Lionelli rearranged the original ''Jonny Quest'' theme. Composer [[Guy Moon]] considered working for the show the "hardest thing I've done in my life", as the producers "want it big, Big, BIG."<ref name="guymoon">{{cite web | title=Guy Moon | year=1996 | author=Clay, Jennifer | url=http://www.bmi.com/guymoon.html | publisher=[[BMI]] | archivedate=1996-10-20 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19961020023157/http://bmi.com/guymoon.html | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> "They want a big orchestra with a good synth rig...It's great because they push me so much I'll probably replace my whole demo reel with ''Jonny Quest'' music.

===Network run and ratings===
Turner aired ''Real Adventures'' seven nights a week on three of its networks—[[TBS (TV network)|TBS]], [[Turner Network Television|TNT]], and Cartoon Network—for an unprecedented twenty-one weekly showings.<ref name="charleston" /><ref name="marketing" /> Turner's marketers surmised, "the audiences of kids watching TNT in the morning or TBS in the afternoon and...Cartoon in prime time and late night are close to mutually exclusive," with Seibert adding that "different audiences watch the networks at different times."<ref name="elecmedia">{{cite journal | last = Walley | first = Wayne | title = 'Jonny Quest' is back with triple debut | date=[[1996-08-26]] | journal = [[Electronic Media]] | volume = 15 | issue = 35 | publisher = Crain Communications Inc.}}</ref><ref name="tvguidetracy" /> ''Real Adventures'' premiered August 26, 1996, three months after a twenty-hour "Farewell Marathon" of original ''Quest''.<ref name="farewellmarathon">{{cite journal | last = Vancheri | first = Barbara | title = It's a boy for WPXI's Finnegan | date=[[1996-05-03]] | journal = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] p. 34}}</ref> The show averaged a 2.0 [[Nielsen Ratings|Nielsen rating]] over August and September 1996, considered a strong start for an animated series.<ref name="ratings20">{{cite journal | last = Haddad | first = Charles | title = Cartoon Network tops 30 million, Large subscribership helps sell advertising | date=[[1996-10-01]] | journal = [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] p.

===Reruns===
[[Rerun]]s aired for two years on [[Toonami]] until [[September 24]], [[1999]], on Cartoon Network in other formats until [[December 14]], [[2002]], and on [[CNX]] until 2003. They also appeared on [[FOX Kids]], with the first airing on [[November 22]], [[1999]]. [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]'s reruns of the show ended on 
[[May 26]], [[2000]], and had not been renewed since then.

===QuestWorld===
Producers cultivated an element of [[virtual reality]] through QuestWorld, a cyberspace simulation rendered with three-dimensional computer animation and [[motion capture]].<ref name="animag" /> QuestWorld was designed as an extension of contemporary technology, similar to the classic series's high-tech lasers, satellites, and robots.<ref name="timesherald" /> Seibert traced its origin to "the same problem that James Bond [has]...When you look at even his newest gadgets, they're somewhat quaint."<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Planners derived inspiration from [[cyberpunk]] novels written by [[Neal Stephenson]] and [[William Gibson]], including ''[[Snow Crash]]''.<ref name="jonnyredux" /> QuestWorld characters were created as [[wire frame]] models, augmented with faces scanned from clay busts, then digitally painted and inked.<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Animation company Buzz F/X, based in [[Montreal]] and [[Santa Monica]], created first season sequences.<ref name="lord">{{cite web | author=Lord, Francois | title=Francois Lord's Commentary | date=[[1997-04-11]] | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Francois_Lord%27s_Commentary | publisher = QuestFan.com/wiki | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Work began in April 1996 with the opening titles—a gliding journey through a canyon of green, cartographic lines with scenes illuminated upon the walls. Budgetary constraints forbade the supervision of experienced animators in Montreal, allegedly "why the opening sequence is so ugly" according to a Buzz F/X animator.<ref name="lord" /> Short segments of action and adventure called ''Quest Bytes'' were produced to follow episodes.
[[Image:Trajq-questworld-tobardoandback.png|right|200px|thumb|Race and Surd fighting in QuestWorld from season one's ''To Bardo and Back'']]
Work on ''Escape to Questworld'' and ''Trouble on the Colorado'' followed; animators worked "12 hours a day, 6 days a week in a small garage" with inadequate computers.<ref name="lord" /> Buzz F/X augmented the small team in July with ten recruits, but only two were experienced. Amateur employees struggled with lighting and syncing jerky motion capture from the House of Moves in [[Venice Beach]].<ref name="lord" /> By August, the team worked "14 hours a day, 7 days a week," including full nights and mornings.<ref name="lord" /> After two more episodes, Buzz F/X terminated its unprofitable contract with Hanna-Barbera, which hired [[Blur Studio]] to finish season two.<ref name="lord" /> Blur used [[Intergraph]] hardware; its sharp performance deadlines and visible usage attracted press attention and sealed an amicable relationship with Hanna-Barbera.<ref name="wiregraph">{{cite journal | title = Intergraph Workstations Play Starring Role in "The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest" at Blur Studio | date=[[1997-02-12]] | journal = [[Business Wire]] | publisher = Gale Group}}</ref><ref name="intergraph">{{cite web | title=Intergraph takes on new 'Quest' | year=1997 | author=McWilliams, James | url=http://www.htimes.com/today/access/oldfiles/quest.html | publisher=The Huntsville Times | archivedate=1997-07-28 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970728084643/http://www.htimes.com/today/access/oldfiles/quest.html | accessdate=15 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Both companies produced in total roughly 100 minutes of computer animation for QuestWorld—more than ''[[Toy Story]]''.<ref name="animag" />

==Creative direction==
The show's premise is that Dr. Quest, a famous [[phenomenology|phenomenologist]], investigates mysterious occurrences and exotic locales with his son, Jonny Quest, bodyguard Race Bannon, Race's daughter Jessie, assistant Hadji Singh, and pet [[bulldog]] Bandit.<ref name="animag" /><ref name="virgin">{{cite journal | title = Virgin Sound and Vision inks licensing agreement with Turner New Media; VSV brings Hanna-Barbera's The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest into computer age with CD-ROM | date=[[1996-03-18]] | journal = [[Business Wire]] | publisher = Gale Group}}</ref> Peter Lawrence set the story a few years after the classic series, with Jonny and his friends now teenagers.<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence aimed to use "existing, real phenomenon"—such as the "Airstrips of [[Nazca]], the Ruins of [[Teotihuacan]] or the possible existence of [[Giant Squid]]"—to capture the curiosity of audiences.<ref name="bible" /> Stressing that "plausibility is a keynote", he suggested coverage of real-world enigma, [[cryptozoology]], exotic locales, or fictional but "believable" mysteries.<ref name="bible" /> The Quests would also find challenge in the virtual environment of QuestWorld, and frequently encounter the villainous [[Jeremiah Surd]] and [[Ezekiel Rage]]. Paralyzed years prior by Race Bannon's [[SWAT]] team, Surd would try to exact revenge through technology, while Rage—a former government agent left for dead on a botched mission—would try to destroy the world with nuclear terrorism. The Quests would sparingly fight "monster[s] of the week...simply out to get [them]", instead battling antagonists who are not "necessarily malevolent" and whose conflicts lay in "personal objective or ambition...opposed by Dr. Quest."<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence stationed the family at a new compound on the coast of Maine, replete with "houses, barns and workshops."<ref name="bible" /> Rooms suited for each character included a library for Dr. Quest, workshop for Jonny, computer-equipped den for Jessie, dojo and gym for Race, and lighthouse lookout for Hadji's meditation.<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence equipped Dr. Quest with a fleet of air, land, and sea vehicles, including a [[World War II]]-era [[biplane]] and state-of-the-art [[catamaran]] named ''Questor'' with [[diving bell]]s and smaller research vessels stored in the hulls.<ref name="bible" /><ref name="vehicles">{{cite web | title=Vehicles | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Vehicles | publisher = QuestFan.com/wiki  | accessdate=20 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> More emphasis would be placed on Jonny than in the classic ''Quest'', with Seibert summarizing the shift:

{{cquote2|We decided to make the show more Jonny-centric. If you analyze the original show, you'll see it's really the Dr. Quest and Race show. Jonny was just hanging out—after all, what can a 10-year-old do?

===Characters===
[[Image:Trajq-expeditiontokhumbu.png|right|200px|thumb|Hadji, Jessie, and Jonny from the season one episode ''Expedition to Khumbu'']]
Seibert explained Jonny's age, 14, as one in which "you think you can solve problems like an adult, but you may go get yourself into trouble."<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Lawrence gave Jonny "a straight-ahead, right-on attitude...His life is cool and he embraces it wholeheartedly."<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence and later writers emphasized that Jonny was "more a Man-Of-Action in training...than an intellectual," and created tension by contrasting his father's academic leanings with Jonny's affinity for Race's lifestyle.<ref name="bible" /> Hadji, age 16, became Dr. Quest's personal assistant, who "does not have his mentor's formal education in the sciences but...shares his burning interest in archaeology, anthropology and...the paranormal."<ref name="bible" /> A [[Sikh]] and student [[yogin]], he exhibited a "fatalistic and accepting attitude to whatever is happening...[starting] from the philosophical point of view that everything is as it's supposed to be."<ref name="bible" /> Hadji often used wise aphorisms, taken from "any culture or any source...Sometimes it will baffle Jonny."<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence cut Hadji's classic [[telekinesis]] to align his abilities with realistic yogin practices. "He doesn't say things like 'Sim, Sim Sala Bim' anymore," season one voice actor [[Michael Benyaer]] explained. "The writers and producers actually researched the actual yogic powers. He can do more plausible stuff. There is an episode where Hadji pretends to stop his breathing so that the bad guys think he is dead."<ref name="cinef">{{cite journal | last = Kingston | first = F. Colin | title = Older and bolder, the cartoon quester returns on Turner TV. | date=October 1996 | journal = [[Cinefantastique]] | volume = 28 | issue = 3}}</ref>

Jessie Bannon, age 15, was characterized as "just as tough...smarter...[and] more thoughtful" than Jonny, and "more in tune with Hadji". She was "more of an egghead" who elected to spend time with Dr. Quest as Jonny did with Race.<Ref name="bible" /> Her father, age 38, retained his classic "laconic sense of humor" and "fearless and utterly dependable" nature.<Ref name="bible" /> Race Bannon retired from government work due to ethical scruples with his former intelligence agency.<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Writers noted that Race "can't help being the overprotective Dad" for Jessie, while Jonny is "the boy Race never had."<ref name="jonnyredux" /> His new western accent and elaborate [[simile]]s were met with resistance from older ''Quest'' fans.<ref name="semifaq" /> Dr. Benton Quest, age 55, retired from government research and operated from the "Quest Compound" on the coast of Maine.<ref name="bible" /> "Driven by his desire to know more about...the inexplicable worldwide phenomena which he investigates," he was "consulted by individuals, governments and corporations to investigate any mysterious chain of events."<Ref name="bible" /> Described as "single-minded—almost to the point of obsession—in his pursuit of knowledge," he often encountered trouble as "his drive to learn blanks out more basic instincts like self-preservation."<Ref name="bible" /> Jessie appreciated his "ponderous" sense of humor.<Ref name="bible" /> Lawrence removed Bandit's clownish origins and presented him in useful roles.<Ref name="bible" /> Summarizing the group's behavior, he wrote:

{{cquote2|Jonny's response to danger will be close to Race's. Jessie's intrigue with mysterious, unexplained phenomena will be close to Dr. Quest's. And Hadji, with his roots in a different culture and a more spiritual approach to life, is different again.<ref name="bible" />}}

In response to preliminary criticism over character changes, Fred Seibert hoped ''Real Adventures'' would find success as new interpretations of [[comic book]] heroes had done.<ref name="angryclassicfan">{{cite journal | last = Rollins | first = Ron | title = Seen & overheard | date=[[1996-10-22]] | journal = [[Dayton Daily News]] p. 3C | publisher = Cox Ohio Publishing}}</ref><ref name="animag" /> Notwithstanding his desire, season two directors Larry Houston and Davis Doi changed the writing and Takashi's designs to a more "classic" feel.<ref name="semifaq" /> Writer Glenn Leopold revived Hadji's "latent psionic powers"—including spoon-bending and "rope tricks"—as he felt the first season's realism was "not that interesting to watch...the more visual his 'power', the better."<ref name="bible" /> All characters lost a year in age; Jonny was now 13.<ref name="bible" /> Writer Lance Falk returned Race to governmental guard duty, sealed by an episodic visit with classic spymaster Phil Corven.<ref name="bible" /><ref name="racecommentary">{{cite web | title=Lance Falk Episode Commentary #5 Race Against Danger | author=Falk, Lance | date=[[1997-02-23]] | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lance_Falk%27s_Episode_Commentary#.235_Race_Against_Danger | publisher = QuestFan.com/wiki | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> While Race lost his western accent, Dr. Quest gained his classic red hair and rudimentary combat skills.<ref name="thoughtcommentary">{{cite web | title=Lance Falk Episode Commentary #3 Thoughtscape | author=Falk, Lance | date=[[1997-02-14]] | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lance_Falk%27s_Episode_Commentary#.233_Thoughtscape | publisher = QuestFan.com/wiki | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Initially resistant to Jessie, Falk came to regard her as the "missing piece needed to complete the Quest family," and Leopold added slight romantic overtones to episodes.<ref name="anipla" /> Fans complained about changes to Jessie, criticized as a [[damsel in distress]] with stereotypically female pink clothes.<ref name="thoughtcommentary" /> Falk defended his portrayal as giving her realistic, "human" fears.<ref name="thoughtcommentary" /><ref name="semifaq" /> An academic paper on animated gender stereotypes later pointed out that Jonny saved Jessie from danger six times during a second season show.<ref name="genderstereotypes">{{cite web | title=Gender Stereotypes in Children's Television Cartoons | author=Eick, Kelly | date=May 1998 | url=http://cla.calpoly.edu/%7Ejrubba/495/papersS98/paper1.html | publisher=California Polytechnic College of Liberal Arts | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===Greater creative liberties===
Second season writers took greater creative liberties with ''Real Adventures'', invoking ghosts, other dimensions, and megalomaniacal schemes. Whereas Peter Lawrence wrote "lots of spiritual, mystical plots...[where] they uncover a lot of hoaxes," Falk and Leopold geared towards a "slam-bang adventure show with real monsters" and furthered the "action's emphasis more [on] Jonny" and his friends.<ref name="anipla" /><ref name="bible" /> Falk explained, "...if [accuracy] gets in the way of 'cool'...cool's gonna win out every time (as it should)," emphasizing that "''Jonny Quest'' is a show with one foot in the ''fantastic'', and one foot solidly based in reality."<ref name="wintercommentary" /><ref name="anipla" /> Opposed to the ubiquitous use of QuestWorld, the new team was nonetheless contractually obligated to use the concept in their work.<ref name="anipla" /> Falk felt that virtual reality paradoxically undermined the show's "strong connection to reality," and suggested that after so many dangerous incidents Dr. Quest would have simply turned the system off.<ref name="semifaq" /> Writers brought back several classic characters, including Pasha the Peddler, Jezebel Jade, and Dr. Zin.<ref name="anipla" /> Falk also honored ''Quest'' creator [[Doug Wildey]] by creating an eponymous grandfather for Jonny in the episode ''Nuclear Netherworld''.<ref name="anipla" /> The team created Estella Velasquez as Jessie's mother to retcon the telefilms, as Jade "would never get married to anybody."<ref name="anipla" /> Writers eliminated villains Rage and Surd in favor of new adversaries.<ref name="anipla" /> Comparing ''Quest'' without Zin to "James Bond without S.P.E.C.T.R.E.", Falk penned a season finale featuring classic robot spies and a visceral fight between Dr. Quest and Zin.<ref name="anipla" /> With the Maine compound destroyed in the aftermath, Falk planned to resuscitate Palm Key as the ''Quest'' home in new episodes. However, Cartoon Network did not renew ''Real Adventures'', despite a pledge to explore the history of Jonny's mother in the season premiere.<ref name="anipla" />

==Cast==
The first season of ''Real Adventures'' featured [[J. D. Roth]] as Jonny, [[George Segal]] as Dr. Quest, [[Robert Patrick]] as Race, [[Jesse Douglas (actress)|Jesse Douglas]] as Jessie, and [[Michael Benyaer]] as Hadji. A childhood fan of the original series, J.D. Roth remarked that he was "so into the idea of what they were trying to accomplish that I had to be Jonny."<ref name="cinef" /> Roth was attracted by Jonny's characterization as "a real kid, who has real instincts, who wants to help people. He has star quality."<ref name="roth1">{{cite web | date=[[1996-08-21]] | author=Gray, Ellen | title=The new `Jonny Quest' is full of ideas for children's programming | url=http://www.newstimes.com/archive/aug2196/tvf.htm | publisher=Knight-Ridder Media | archivedate=1997-04-30 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970430170024/http://www.newstimes.com/archive/aug2196/tvf.htm| accessdate=15 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> He found that "[Jonny] doesn't think about how he's going to do it; he just wants to go do it...he is full of enthusiasm, and it is infectious."<ref name="cinef" /> Roth admired the show's educational quality, something he had tried to integrate in his personal television pilots.<ref name="roth1" /> He later expressed that "Jonny is crazy about his dad. He looks up to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr Quest knows that Jonny is going to be something really special."<ref name="cinef" /> Michael Banyaer enjoyed playing Hadji—"[he] is one of the few roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy. I mean, how many East Indian heroes have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive kids out there. He is the outsider in all of us."<ref name="cinef" /> A [[Star Wars]] fan, Banyaer also relished the opportunity to work with [[Mark Hamill]] for ''In the Realm of the Condor''.<ref name="cinef" />

When asked about Jessie's inclusion, Jesse Douglas stated, "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard for the rest of the storyline."<ref name="cinef" /> Roth supported her, claiming that "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with...I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend."<ref name="cinef" /> Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults "there might be a [[Spencer Tracy|Tracy]]/[[Katharine Hepburn|Hepburn]] thing going on."<ref name="tvguidetracy">{{cite journal | last = Vered | first = Annabel | title = A heat wave of sizzling stars | date=[[1996-06-18]] | journal = [[TV Guide]] | volume = 44 | issue = 23}}</ref> Hanna-Barbera bought out the first cast's contracts as part of second season changes and hired new actors.<ref name="semifaq" /> Season two featured [[Quinton Flynn]] as Jonny, [[John de Lancie]] as Dr. Quest, [[Granville Van Dusen]] (first two episodes) and [[Robert Foxworth]] as Race, [[Jennifer Hale]] as Jessie, and [[Rob Paulsen]] as Hadji. [[Don Messick]] attempted to reprise his classic role as Dr. Quest, but was forced into retirement after suffering a [[stroke]] during early sessions.<ref name="anipla" /> His recorded dialogue included work on the episode ''Rock of Rages'', one line of which survived overdubbing by de Lancie.<ref name="ragescommentary">{{cite web | title=Lance Falk Episode Commentary #1 Rock of Rages | author=Falk, Lance | date=[[1997-02-08]] | url=http://questfan.com/Page/Lance_Falk%27s_Episode_Commentary#.231_Rock_of_Rages.html | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Van Dusen voiced Bannon in the 1986 ''Quest'' series, and Foxworth took over the part coincidentally after an audition for Dr. Quest.<ref name="anipla" /> Paulsen previously voiced Hadji in the two ''Quest'' telefilms.<ref name="paulsen">{{cite web | title=IMDb: Rob Paulsen | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0667326/ | publisher=Internet Movie Database Inc. | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Several products were listed in the "Quest Adventure Value Pack" catalogue, which encouraged $40 savings through combined purchases.<ref name="brandweek3" /> Among other products, the catalogue was packaged with [[Kid Rhino]]'s [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] audio adventure based on the episode ''Return of the Anasazi''.<ref name="kidrhino">{{cite web | date=[[1996-09-17]] | title=The new kid rhino takes a journey into the world of Jonny Quest | url=http://www.rhino.com/hotpress/jonnyquestpr.html | publisher=Knight-Ridder Media | archivedate=1997-06-14 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970614064532/http://www.rhino.com/hotpress/jonnyquestpr.html | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The show's [[Closing credits|credits]] advertised a [[soundtrack]] available from Rhino, but such a release was never otherwise promoted or sold.<ref name="semifaq" /> Hanna-Barbera set up the website ''Questworld.com'' as the show's internet hub, presenting it as if it were written by members of the Quest team.<ref name="questworldcom1">{{cite web | title=Quest Cast: Jessie Bannon | url=http://questworld.com/cast/jessie.html | publisher=Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc. | archivedate=1997-03-27 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970327145421/http://questworld.com/cast/jessie.html | accessdate=15 July | accessyear=2007}}</ref> In keeping with the show's educational, real-world premise, the site hosted several links to academic, archaeological, and exploratory websites.<ref name="questworldcom2">{{cite web | title=Questworld: Archaeology | url=http://www.questworld.com/adventures/archaeology.html | publisher=Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc. | archivedate=1998-01-21 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19980121205058/questworld.com/adventures/archaeology.html | accessdate=15 July | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The marketing campaign culminated with the release of eight season one episodes over [[VHS]] with suggested retail prices of $12.98 per unit.<ref name="marketing" /> The size of the push left one newspaper reviewer wondering, "are [the Quests] back because they're too cool to die, or because they're too well known to be squandered as a licensing product?"<ref name="dailyheraldrevue" /> [[Hanna-Barbera]] chief [[Fred Seibert]] expected high sales and success:

Virgin designed certain segments in [[stereoscopy|3D]] and included special Chromatek plastic viewing glasses with game copies. Footage voices were dubbed over by Michael Banyaer as Hadji, Charles Howerton as Dr. Quest, and the season two cast. The game's music featured a "high-intensity orchestral sound" prone to [[monotony]].<ref name="morningreview" /> One reviewer cited a lack of [[replay value]] and different modes of difficulty as weaknesses, but concluded that ''Roswell'' offered "good entertainment and variety".<ref name="morningreview" /> Critics were divided over the puzzles' difficulty, naming it both "ingenious" and "elementary".<ref name="ajroswell">{{cite journal | title = Visions of computer games swim in their heads | date=[[1996-12-21]] | journal = [[Albuquerque Journal]] p. 7 | publisher = Albuquerque Journal}}</ref><ref name="morningreview" /> Peter Scisco of ComputerLife and FamilyPC's testers criticized some of the puzzles for relying on "reflexes, not logical thinking."<ref name="computerliferoswell">{{cite journal | first = Peter | last = Scisco | title = Junior Sleuths on the Loose: The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest: Cover-Up At Roswell | date=[[1996-12-21]] | journal = ComputerLife vol. 4, issue 3, p. 113}}</ref> Contrarily, Entertainment Weekly's reviewer found the challenges too easy, considering them unimaginative "Pac-Man rip-offs and dopey jigsaws," and rated the game B+.<ref name="ewroswell">{{cite journal | first = Kipp | last = Cheng | title = Jonny Quest: Crisis at Area 51 | date= [[1996-10-04]] | journal = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | issue = 347}}</ref> Scisco appreciated the nonviolent content and the inclusion of Jessie's strong female character, but named the extra-terrestrial story "too familiar".<ref name="computerliferoswell" />

Everybody needs to do their own thing."<ref name="barbera" /> [[People (magazine)|People]] praised Turner's shift from the "politically correct claptrap" of ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers]]'', giving ''Real Adventures'' a B grade as "children's programming the way it oughta be."<ref name="peoplereview" /> Peter Scisco of ComputerLife appreciated that the team "rely on their brains, not mutant superpowers."<ref name="computerliferoswell" />

The [[Toronto Star]] scathingly criticized the show for hosting "facile plots heavily laced with jarring science fiction and incongruous computer animation," and called QuestWorld a "poorly explained techno-gimmick."<ref name="torontostar" /> Though praising the computer animation, The Star regarded traditional sequences as "flat and textureless, with minimal characterization, unnaturally stiff movement and poor execution of shading and shadow."<ref name="torontostar" /> Ted Cox of the Chicago Daily Herald disagreed, lauding "realistic" traditional and digital animation—"such as the play of light on the ocean."<ref name="dailyheraldrevue" /> Cox conceded that in some spots, motion seemed "remarkably uneven".<ref name="dailyheraldrevue" /> TV Guide also found the animation to be somewhat flat, but considered the sound effects and backgrounds "state-of-the-art."<ref name="tvguidereview" /> Greg Aaron of [[HotWired]] praised the franchise's return, but warned against QuestWorld hype, arguing that "it will take more than visual sophistication to hook today's viewers".<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Senior vice president of production Sherry Gunther admitted that the motion capture technology was "best reserved for recording broad movements...because the technology is still a little crude."<ref name="jonnyredux" />

Alberto Menache expanded this criticism of QuestWorld in the book ''Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Video Games'', labeling the virtual reality simulation a "failure" laden with "many mistakes."<Ref name="capturecrit">{{cite book | last = Menache | first = Alberto | title = Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Video Games | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | date = October 1999 | pages = 52–53 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9njZ482OYfwC&dq | isbn=0124906303}}</ref> He explained that the size difference between the motion capturers and the characters caused unsteady animation and shaking—consequently mismatching interaction with props or uneven terrain.<Ref name="capturecrit" /> Menache levied blame upon the show's budget, which did not allow for digital post-production and review. Producers instead expected "plug-and-play" results straight from the capture studio.<Ref name="capturecrit" /> Menache concluded that the QuestWorld sequences were the result of a "pipeline set up for mass production" with little testing or advance planning.<Ref name="capturecrit" /> These criticisms mirrored the comments of Buzz F/X animator Francois Lord, who revealed that the company's Montreal animators were inexperienced and forced to deliver on rushed schedules.<ref name="lord" /> Contrasting their work with Blur Studio's, he pointed out that amid more experienced workers, Blur "had twice as [much] time as we did and twice as [much] money."<ref name="lord" /> Menache was less critical of the facial capture, considering it "medium-quality...but still acceptable for the kind of television budget this project had."<Ref name="capturecrit" />
