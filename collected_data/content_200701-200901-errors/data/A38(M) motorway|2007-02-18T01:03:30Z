The '''A38(M)''' is a [[motorway]] in [[Birmingham, England|Birmingham]], [[England]].  It is 2 [[Mile|miles]] (3.2[[km]]) long and was opened on [[May 24]], [[1972]]<ref name="ma-dates">[http://www.iht.org/motorway/a38mastonstat.htm The Motorway Archive A38(M) - Dates]</ref>. It forms part of the [[A38 road|A38]] and is also known as the '''Aston Expressway'''.

==Route==
The A38(M) runs from the [[A5127 road|A5127]]  through [[Gravelly Hill Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]] where the A38 joins and then shortly after traffic from the [[M6 motorway]] also joins. It then enters a [[tidal flow]] section with a total of 7 lanes.  Lane use is controlled by means of electronic overhead signs, with one lane always closed to create a buffer between the two directions of travel - there is no [[central reservation]]. Access to the centre lane, which contains a drainage channel, is now forbidden to [[motorcycle]]s because of a fatal accident which happened when one of the drainage covers dislodged<ref>[http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/a38m/ CBRD Motorway Database - A38(M)]</ref>.   In the morning, there are normally 4 lanes for Birmingham bound traffic and 2 lanes for traffic northbound.  In the evening rush hour, there are 4 lanes outbound and 2 lanes towards the city centre.  At all other times, the road runs with 3 lanes in each direction. 

The route is on a [[bridge]] as it passes through [[Aston]]; this section cuts through the grounds of [[Aston Hall]]<ref name="ma-main">[http://www.iht.org/motorway/a38mastonexp.htm The Motorway Archive - A38(M)]</ref>.  The road passes through its first junction after 1 mile.  It then enters a cutting before reaching the second junction, where the tidal flow ends as does the motorway.

Due to the nature of the road, the speed limit is reduced to 50 [[mph]] (80 [[km/h]]), with no [[speed cameras]].

The traffic island at Dartmouth Circus houses a redundant [[Boulton and Watt]] [[steam engine]].

==Trivia==
*The motorway is crossed by a gantry which used to house a [[vinegar]] [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]], carrying the condiment from one part of the [[HP Sauce]] factory to the other. Once, in the 1970s, this leaked, damaging the paintwork on several passing cars.
*The motorway is curved in Aston to avoid an [[Ansells]] [[brewery]]. The brewery was demolished before the road was finished<ref name="ma-main" />.
