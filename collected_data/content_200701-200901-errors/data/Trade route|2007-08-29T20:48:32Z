{{Trade route}}
A '''trade route''' is the sequence of [[pathway]]s and stopping places used for the [[Commerce|commercial]] [[transport]] of [[cargo]]. Trade routes can be [[landform|land]] or [[marine (ocean)|water]]-based. 

Trade routes have existed since the begining of [[civilization]] and —  due to their importance —  have often influenced the [[political]] policies of the regions involved.

==Important trade routes==
[[Image:GDRT230.jpg|right|180px|thumb|The economy of the [[Qataban|Kingdom of Qataban]] (light blue) was based on the cultivation and trade of spices and aromatics including frankincense and myrrh. These were exported to the [[Mediterranean]], India and [[Abyssinia]] where they were greatly prized by many cultures, using camels on routes through Arabia, and to India by sea.]]
===Early trade===
[[Anatolia]] lay on the land routes to [[Europe]] and the sea route from the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Black Sea]].<ref>Stearns 2001: 37</ref> Records from the [[19th century BCE]] attest to the existance of an [[Assyrian]] [[merchant]] [[colony]] at [[Kanesh]] in [[Cappadocia]].<ref>Stearns 2001: 37</ref>  The domestication of [[camel]] allowed [[Arabian]] nomads to control long distance trade in [[spice]]s and [[silk]] from the [[Far East]].<ref>Stearns 2001: 41</ref> The [[Egyptian]]s had traded in the [[Red sea]], importing [[spice]]s from the "[[Land of Punt]]" and from [[Arabia]].<ref>Rawlinson 2001: 11-12</ref>

===Incense Route===
{{main|Incense route}}
The [[Incense route]] — which included both land and sea routes — stretched across Egypt to [[India]] through [[Arabia]], and was one of the major trading routes of the [[ancient times]]. The Incense Route trade included goods such as Arabian [[frankincense]], [[myrrh]]; Indian spices, [[ebony]], fine [[textiles]]; and [[East Africa]]n rare woods, feathers, animal skins, gold.

The middlemen and controllers of the Incense Route trade were the [[Chaldean]]s<ref>Larsen 1983: 56</ref> and the Arabian [[Nabateans]]. However, the importance of the Arabian land routes declined when [[Ptolemy_VIII_Euergetes_II|Ptolemy Euergetes II]] began searching for direct sea routes to India, later used by the Romans for [[Roman trade with India]]. However, Pre-Islamic Meccans kept trading along the land routes, satisfying the Roman demand for luxury goods.<ref>Crone 2004: 10</ref>

===Silk Route===
[[Image:Silkroutes.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The trading routes along the Silk Road]]
{{main|Silk Route}}
The Silk Route connected —  commercially and culturally —  the civilizations of Rome, Egypt, [[Mesopotamia]], India and [[China]].

The goods traded along the Silk Route included [[silk]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[Wine]], woven goods, [[metal]]work, [[glass]]ware, [[salt]], [[ceramics]], [[wool]] rugs, [[textiles]], [[dates]], [[crystal]], [[tea]], [[saffron]], [[horse]]s, [[lapdog]]s, [[jasmine]], [[sandalwood]], [[brass]]ware, [[camel]]s, [[almond]]s, [[jade]], [[oil]], [[amber]], [[gold]] [[silver]], [[sugar]], [[hemp]] and [[cotton]].<ref>[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/exhibit/trade/trade.html]</ref> 

[[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhism was transmitted]] from India to various other countries occurred along the Silk Road. The Silk Route additionally was a pathway for combining artistic influences from [[Central Asia]], [[Greece]], [[Persia]], India and China to give rise to unique schools of art such as the [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist school]].

===Spice Trade===

{{main|Spice trade}}
The Spice Trade revolved around trading of spices from India and the [[Moluccas]], with prominent trading partners including [[Europe]], Arabia, Persia, China and [[Africa]]. During the [[middle ages]], explorers [[Pero da Covilha]] and [[Vasco da Gama]] charted out sea routes to India thereby ushering an age of European [[colonialism]].

The Spice Trade was chiefly centered around the sea routes, and made use of ports such as [[Muziris]], [[Puri]], [[Alexandria]], [[Damietta]], [[Aden]], [[Siraf]], [[Calicut]], [[Malabar]], [[Macao]], [[Banda]], [[Surat]], [[Penang]], [[Sumatra]], [[Grenada]] and later stretching to [[Japan]] and [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. The goods traded along the Spice Route included [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], [[nutmeg]], [[sandalwood]] and [[clove]]. Additionally, the [[early transpeninsular routeway]] was a part of the Spice Route in the [[Malay Peninsula]].

===King's Highway===
{{main|King's Highway (ancient)}}
The King’s Highway stretched from Egypt to [[Aqaba]] and led to [[Damascus]] to the north. The highway connected [[Edom]], [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], [[Heliopolis]], [[Mitla Pass]], [[Eilat]], [[Aqaba]], [[Aravah]], [[Petra]], [[Ma'an]], [[Sela]], [[Shaubak]], [[Gerasa]], [[Bozrah]], [[Damascus]] and [[Tadmor]], ending at [[Resafa]] on [[Euphrates]].

The [[Israelites]] and the [[Nabateans]] exercised control over this route. The King's Highway was also a [[pilgrimage]] route for both the [[Christian]]s and the [[Muslim]]s.

===Via Maris===
{{main|Via Maris}}
Via Maris, literally the ''Way of the Sea,'' connected Egypt with the ancient [[middle east]]. It was one of the main trade routes connecting Egypt to the middle east, the other being [[King's Highway]]. The Via Maris was also connected to the King's Highway to as far as the [[Euphrates River]].

===Amber Road===
{{main|Amber Road}}
The [[Amber Road]], consisting of waterways and ancient highways, connected Europe to Asia and the Mediterranean.[[Image:Varangian routes.png|thumb|right|150px|Map showing the major Varangian trade routes: the Volga trade route (in red) and the [[Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks]] (in purple). Other trade routes of the [[8th century|8th]]-[[11th century|11th centuries]] shown in orange.]]

The main component of trade along this route was [[amber]], used as a decorative and ornamental material. Several [[amber finding locations]] were also located strategically along the trade route.

===Volga trade route===
{{main|Volga trade route}}
The Volga trade route connected [[Northern Europe]] with Northwestern [[Russia]] via the [[Caspian Sea]]. The merchants from the [[Islamic world]] also traded with the [[Rus]] using this route.

As a series of land and sea routes, this route was established by the [[Norsemen]] in the [[9th century]]. Both the [[Sassanid]] and the [[Arab]]s had traded along this route, and the route finds mention in the works of the Persian geographer [[ibn Rustah]].

This route was soon overshadowed by the [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], which ran down the [[Dnieper]] to the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]].

==Significance of trade routes==
===Cultural===
The activities along trade routes led to a complex series of cultural exchanges  —  notably involving [[religion]] and [[art]] —  between various civilizations.

According to [[Philip D. Curtin]] (1984):<ref>Curtin 1984: 103</ref>

| Successive religious changes in Southeast Asia also followed from the work of later commercial missionaries. Just as [[Mahayana Buddhism]] spread along the trade routes of Central Asia from India to China and Japan, [[Hinayana Buddhism]] was to spread, mainly from [[Ceylon]], to become the dominant religion of [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. Even later, the conversion to [[Islam]] of [[Malaya]], [[Indonesia]], and the southern [[Philippines]] was also the work of people who came with a [[Muslim]] trade diaspora.

The introduction of [[Buddhism]] from north east India through the [[Silk Route]] revolutionized art and thought throughout the [[Far East]]. Buddhist missionaries traveled between China, Central Asia and India to propogate Buddhism. 

The penetration of Buddhism in China gave rise to a unique school of art known as [[Serindian art]], literally ''Seres'' (China) and India. Another artistic revolution to have occurred along the Silk route was the founding of the [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist school of art]].

[[Hindu]] priests traveled along trade routes and introduced their religion, [[ritual]]s, [[mythology]], [[script]], [[literature]] and[[ language]] to Southeast Asia.<ref>Elisseeff 2000: 273</ref> [[Jesuit]] missionaries, such as [[St. Francis Xavier]], followed the Portuguese to spread [[Roman Catholic]] [[Christianity]] to Asia.

===Strategic===
[[Image:Tilglath pileser iii.jpg|130px|right|thumb|Tiglath-Pileser III &mdash; [[stela]] from the walls of his palace ([[British Museum]], [[London]])]]
The economic position of a trade route attaches [[strategic]] importance to the protection of commercial activities by [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] and [[military]] means. Historically, trade routes have attracted the attention of [[invader]]s  seeking to benefit from the prosperity of the route.

[[Tiglath-Pileser III]] attacked [[Gaza]] in order to control trade along the [[Incense Route]].<ref>Edwards 1969: 330</ref> The [[Romans]] sacked [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and controlled [[Roman trade with India|trade with India]].<ref>Shaw 2003: 426</ref>

Due the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] hold on the [[Levant]] during the second half of the [[fifteenth century]] the traditional [[Spice Route]] shifted from the [[Persian Gulf]] to the [[Red Sea]].<ref>Tarling 1999: 10</ref> This led to the search for a new route to Asian Spice Trade pioneered by Vasco Da Gama's voyage to the west coast of India in [[1498]].<ref>Tarling 1999: 10</ref> In [[1504]], [[Manuel I of Portugal]] decreed a restriction on leaking of information with regard to the new discovery of Asian trade routes, not a single book on the subject was published during the first fifty years of the [[sixteenth century]] a a result.<ref>Tarling 1999: 10</ref> 

According to [[Nicholas Tarling]] (1999):<ref>Tarling 1999: 10</ref>

{| border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="90%" style="background-color: #EEEEEE;"

| [[Affonso de Albuquerque]] became the architect of the Portugese Asian empire, or the ''Estado da India'', with its administrative centre at [[Goa]]. It was he who conceived of strategy to control the vital nodes of the Spice Route. This meant seizing Melaka, the principal collecting port of cloves, nutmeg, mace, and [[Southeast Asia]]n pepper; controlling maritime traffic along the west coast of India; capturing [[Hormuz]] at the mouth of the [[Persian Gulf]]; and conquering Aden, which was strategically located at the entrance to the Red Sea. This grand plan nearly succeeded; the island of Goa fell in [[1510]], to be followed by Maleka if [[1511]] and Hormuz in [[1515]]. Only Aden successfully resisted a Portugese attack in [[1513]] and remained outside direct Portugese control.

The growing competition among the nations involved in trade along the [[Spice route]] led to armed conflicts for control of the spice trade. In [[1641]], Portuguese Molucca was captured by the [[Dutch]].<ref>Donkin 2003: 169</ref> This capture saw concentrated plantation on cloves and nutmegs and then[[Image:SMS Dresden German Cruiser LOC 16727.jpg|thumb|150px|left|SMS Dresden passing through the [[Kiel Canal]] ]] —  using the Treaty of [[Batavia]] ([[1652]]) —  an attempt to destroy trees on all other islands.<ref>Donkin 2003: 169</ref> This was done to keep the supply in check in order to control the important markets of spices.<ref>Donkin 2003: 169</ref>

The [[seventeenth century]] saw military disturbances around the [[Ottawa]] river trade route.<ref>Easterbrook 1988: 75</ref> During the late [[eighteenth century]], the [[French]] built military forts at strategic locations along the main trade routes of [[Canada]].<ref>Easterbrook 1988: 127</ref> These forts checked the British advances, served as trading posts which included the [[native Americans]] in [[fur]] trade and acted as communications posts.<ref>Easterbrook 1988: 127</ref>

During the [[First World War]], [[Germany]] planned to attack the trade route between [[Trinidad]] and [[Barbados]] by entering the [[South America]].<ref>Halpern 1994: 79</ref> German ships ''[[SMS Karlsruhe (1912)|SMS Karlsruhe]]'' and ''[[SMS Emden (1906)|SMS Emden]]'' attacked allied trade, despite British and French preventive measures.<ref>Halpern 1994: 79</ref> Another German ship ''[[SMS Dresden]]'' attacked the South American trade, sinking two ships before being assigned to naval operations in the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific  theater]].<ref>Halpern 1994: 79</ref>
