'''Jason Andrew Varitek''' (born [[April 11]] [[1972]] in {{city-state|Rochester|Michigan}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[baseball]] player. After being traded as a minor league prospect by the [[Seattle Mariners]], Varitek has played his entire major league career for the [[Boston Red Sox]]. A two time all-star and [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove Award winner]] at [[catcher]], Varitek was an integral part of the [[2004 World Series]] and [[2007 World Series]] Championship teams. In 2005 he was named the [[Major League Baseball Team Captains|captain]] of the Red Sox, the fourth player given the honor. He is a [[switch-hitter]]. His nickname is "'Tek" or "The Captain." 

Achieving high success at every level, Varitek is one of only two players in the history of the sport to have played in the World Championship game of the [[Little League World Series]], in the National Championship game of the [[College World Series]], and in the Major League [[World Series]] ([[Ed Vosberg]] is the other). Varitek stands alone as the only baseball player in history to have played in the three aforementioned World Series along with playing on the [[Baseball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Olympic Baseball]] team, and in the [[World Baseball Classic]]. As well, his [[Lake Brantley High School]] baseball team won the Florida State Championship his senior year in 1990 and was named the number one high school baseball team in the land by a USA Today poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jason-varitek.com/biography.htm|title=Jason Varitek biography}}</ref><br>

==Little League career==
[[Image:Variteklittleleagueworldseries.jpg|thumb|left|Jason Varitek in the [[Little League World Series]], 1984]]
Varitek played in the [[1984 Little League World Series]], leading his {{city-state|Altamonte Springs|Florida}} team to victory in the United States Championship bracket in a 4-2 victory over [[Southport, Indiana]]. Yet, the national champions fell in the [[Little League World Series#Little League World Series champions|world championship game]] to the international champion from [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], by a score of 6-2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/littleleague/|title=Sporting News History of LLWS}}</ref> Varitek played [[shortstop]], [[third base]], and [[catcher]] in his three LLWS games, performing well defensively, but was hitless going 0 for 7 with two walks and a run scored.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littleleague.org/media/jasonvsjason.asp|title=Jason vs. Jason: LLB World Series Participants Square Off in MLB World Series}}</ref><br><br>
==High school and college==
While in high school, Varitek was a third baseman and catcher for the [[Lake Brantley High School]] baseball team in Altamonte Springs, FL. The Patriots' usual catcher was Jerry Thurston, himself a pro prospect. In 1990, the Patriots won the state championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhsaa.org/records/rec_ba.pdf|title=History of Florida State Champions|format=PDF}}</ref> He was also a member of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team and was named Baseball America's 1993 College Player of the Year at Georgia Tech; he appeared in 3 games for the U.S. team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic.

Varitek attended [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], where he helped lead the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets baseball|Yellow Jackets baseball team]] to the 1994 [[College World Series]] championships, along with teammates [[Nomar Garciaparra]] and [[Jay Payton]]. He graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in management and is the only Tech baseball player to have his number (33) retired. 

==Early professional career==
Varitek played two summers in the [[Cape Cod Baseball League]] with the [[Hyannis Mets]]. In 1993 he hit .371 while winning both the league batting championship and MVP. He was drafted 21st overall in the first round by the [[Minnesota Twins]] in 1993,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jason-varitek.com/articles/insidebaseball.htm|title=Inside Baseball at the College World Series}}</ref> but opted to return for his senior year of college. Following graduation, Varitek signed with agent [[Scott Boras]] and was drafted by the [[Seattle Mariners]] in the first round of the 1994 amateur draft, with the 14th pick overall.<ref name="six">{{cite web|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/111402aaa.html|title=Varitek, Garciaparra Inducted Into Cape Cod Baseball Hall of Fame}}</ref> A pioneer of the loopholes in the draft process, Varitek signed with the [[St. Paul Saints]] in the independent [[Northern League (baseball)|Northern League]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jason-varitek.com/articles/varitekseatleagree.htm|title=Varitek, Seattle finally agree; MLB averts lawsuit}}</ref> before agreeing to terms with the Mariners, and consequently did not enter the Mariners' [[minor league]] system until 1995. When he finally did join the franchise, Varitek was sent to the AA affiliate [[Port City Roosters]] where he first met longtime teammate Derek Lowe. He was traded with [[pitcher]] [[Derek Lowe]] to the Red Sox during the 1997 season, in return for [[relief pitcher|reliever]] [[Heathcliff Slocumb]], often cited as one of the best trades in the Red Sox's favor in recent history.

==Major league career==
===1998 rookie year - 2001===
Varitek was called up for a single game on [[September 24]], [[1997]], collecting a single in his only at bat. The next season Varitek split time with incumbent catcher [[Scott Hatteberg]] playing in 86 games.<ref name="bbr">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml|title=Baseball Reference}}</ref> Varitek showed signs of things to come in the 1998 season and with a strong spring training following the season, Varitek ensured himself the starting role. 1999 was a breakout year for the young catcher; he played 144 games in that season while hitting for a .269 average, with 20 [[home runs]], and 76 [[RBI]]s.<ref name="bbr">[http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml Baseball Reference}</ref> 1999 also gave Varitek his first taste of the playoffs. Varitek went 5-21 with 3 RBI in the [[1999 American League Division Series|1999 ALDS]] against the [[Cleveland Indians]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redsoxbaseball.tripod.com/stats/playoffs/99lds.html|title=1999 ALDS Stats}}</ref> and 4-20 with 1 RBI in the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] against the [[New York Yankees]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redsoxbaseball.tripod.com/stats/playoffs/99lcs.html|title=1999 ALCS Stats}}</ref> Varitek looked forward to building on his success from the year before, but in 2000 he did not show the same potential and had a disappointing offensive output. He hit just .248 with only 10 home runs and 65 RBI.<ref name="bbr">[http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml Baseball Reference}</ref> Prior to the 2001 season, Varitek signed a 3 year $14.9 million contract with the Red Sox, and off to a hot start before he was sidelined for the season with a broken left elbow after he dove to catch a foul ball on [[June 7]]. The play went on to be a top [[Web gem|Web Gem]] for the month of July in 2001. Varitek finished the season with a .293 average, 7 home runs, and 25 RBI in just 51 games played.<ref name="bbr">[http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml Baseball Reference]</ref> Stretched out over a season, this would lead to over 20 home runs and 75 RBIs, in line with his 1999 season, encouraging the Red Sox front office.

===2002 and 2003===
Varitek returned to the Red Sox lineup fulltime in the 2002 season. The return did not go smoothly, however, as Varitek struggled to find himself at the plate. Despite not reaching his full offensive potential,<ref name="bbr">[http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml Baseball Reference]</ref> pitchers and coaches alike began to notice how much Varitek's preparation and knowledge of the game was helping the pitchers. His study habits and extra hours of work with pitchers would soon become his defining attribute and make him a household name around the league. Varitek and the Red Sox entered the 2003 season with a renewed fire to reach the playoffs after missing in the previous three years. Varitek instantly became a leader in the working class clubhouse featuring new faces such as [[Kevin Millar]], [[David Ortiz]], [[Bill Mueller]], and [[Todd Walker]] along with original players [[Trot Nixon]] and [[Lou Merloni]]. 2003 was Varitek's best year to date and earned his first all-star selection after the fans voted him on with the [[All-Star Final Vote]]. He was hitting .296 with 15 HRs and 51 RBIs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/news/mlb_news.jspymd=20030709&content_id=417344&vkey=allstar2003&fext=.jsp|title=2003 Varitek, Jenkins are All-Stars}}</ref> going into the all-star break and finished the season off with a solid .273 average, 25 HRs and 85 RBIs,<ref name="bbr">[http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/varitja01.shtml Baseball Reference]</ref> all career highs. Varitek also led the Red Sox to a [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball Wild Card|Wild Card]] berth and their first playoff appearance since 1999.

===2004 and the World Series===
[[Image:WorldSeriesRing.jpg|thumb|A 2004 Boston Red Sox World Series Ring. Ring courtesy of Red Sox Vice-Chairman [[Les Otten]]]]
In 2004, Varitek compiled a career-high .296 [[batting average]] with 18 [[home run]]s and 73 [[Run batted in|RBI]]. During a nationally televised game on [[July 24]], [[2004]], Varitek shoved his glove into the face of Yankees' Alex Rodriguez to protect [[Bronson Arroyo]], causing a bench-clearing brawl. Though he was ejected (along with Rodriguez) from the game following the incident, the moment sparked Boston to an 11-10 come from behind victory. It is also sometimes regarded as the turning point in the Red Sox season, as they posted MLB's best record after the melee. The Red Sox culminated the season with their first [[World Series]] championship in 86 years. Having played in this World Series, Varitek became the second player to have played in the Little League World Series, College World Series, and Major League World Series. (The first player to do this was [[Ed Vosberg]]). At the end of the year, Varitek became a [[free agent]] and signed a 4-year, $40-million contract with the Red Sox.

===Free agency to promotion to Captain===
After Varitek's re-signing, the Red Sox appointed him to be the third team captain since 1923, after [[Carl Yastrzemski]] (1969-83) and [[Jim Rice]] (1986-89). There are currently only three other captains in Major League Baseball: [[Derek Jeter]] of the [[New York Yankees]], [[Paul Konerko]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]], and [[Mike Sweeney]] of the [[Kansas City Royals]].

According to baseball media, Varitek is valued as a catcher for his ability to work with pitchers, using scouting reports and video footage to plan each game. He also won his first [[Gold Glove Award]], his first [[Silver Slugger]], and his second All-Star selection in 2005.

Through April 2007, Varitek had a career batting average of .268 with 131 home runs and 548 RBI in 3570 plate appearances.

In 2006, Varitek represented the United States in the [[World Baseball Classic]]. He made the most of his playing time, hitting a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam home run]] against Team Canada allowing [[USA Baseball|Team USA]] to move from 8-2, to 8-6. Team Canada, however, kept the lead in the [[upset]] victory.

On [[July 18]], [[2006]], Varitek played his 991st game at catcher for the [[Boston Red Sox]], breaking [[Carlton Fisk]]'s club record. That game was a home game vs. [[Kansas City Royals|Kansas City]], during which Varitek's achievement was recognized before the top of the 5th inning (after the game was official and couldn't be cancelled due to weather). Varitek received a standing ovation from the sellout crowd at [[Fenway Park]] for a few moments before play began. On [[July 31]], [[2006]], Varitek was injured rounding the bases in a 9-8 victory over the Cleveland Indians (his 1000th Career Game as catcher) but said he believed the initial injury to the knee occurred while he was blocking home plate to make the tag against the Angels [[Mike Napoli]] on [[July 29]], [[2006]]. He had surgery on [[August 3]], [[2006]] to repair torn cartilage in his left knee. Varitek returned to the Red Sox lineup on [[September 4]], following a short rehabilitation assignment in Pawtucket.

On [[September 19]], [[2006]], Jason was honored during a pre-game ceremony as the first Red Sox catcher to catch 1,000 games. The Red Sox Captain was presented with a special award by Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk, who held the Boston club record with 990 career games caught before Varitek surpassed that total on [[July 18]] versus Kansas City. The Sox backstop caught his 1000th game on [[July 31]] and by the evening of the ceremony had appeared in 1,009 games behind the plate.
That same night, Jason also received the 2006 Red Sox Heart and Hustle Award from the local chapter of the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, which is presented to a player exemplifying the values, tradition, and spirit of the game of baseball. A national winner will be selected from the individual club honorees later this year.

In 2007, Red Sox starting pitcher [[Julian Tavarez]] called Varitek the smartest catcher he has ever had.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redsox.bostonherald.com/redSox/view.bg?articleid=1000623&format=text|title=redsox.bostonherald.com/redSox/view.bg?articleid=1000623&format=text<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>
