'''Jackie Ormes''' (1917? - [[January 2]], [[1986]]) is known as the first [[African American|Black]] [[United States|American]] [[female]] [[cartoonist]].

== Early Career ==
Jackie Ormes was born Zelda Jackson in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. The daughter of an artist and writer father, Ormes started out in journalism as a sports reporter for the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'', a [[African American newspapers|black newspaper]]. Her stories included the heavyweight [[boxing match]] between [[John Henry Lewis]] and [[Joe Louis]].

Ormes later moved to Chicago and in [[1942]] began working for the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', another black newspaper, although her cartoons did not appear in that paper.<ref name="pcoc">{{cite web

== Torchy Brown ==

While working at the ''Courier'', Ormes created the cartoon ''Torchy Brown'', featuring an African-American heroine of the same name. Like the better-known [[Brenda Starr]] strip, which would debut in [[1940]] featuring a white female lead, Torchy's adventures included romance and action with soap-opera style plotting. In her earliest appearances, Torchy is a teenager as part of a family, but later is portrayed as a young adult woman.

''Torchy Brown'' appeared weekly in the ''Courier'' as a color Sunday feature, debuting on May 1, 1937 <ref name="stripper"/>, and was syndicated to 14 other black newspapers around the country, making her the first female African-American [[Print syndication#Comic-strip syndication|syndicated cartoonist]]. <ref name="toonopedia">{{cite web

Torchy presented an image of a black woman who, in contrast to the contemporary stereotypical media portrayals, was confident, intelligent, and brave. The strip's focus on the issues of black communities led to comics addressing relevant topics such as [[Environmental racism|disproportionate pollution]] in primarily black areas. <ref name="aar">{{cite web

Ormes also created [[Paper doll|paper dolls]] based on Torchy, with costumes and clothing that could be cut out and "worn" by the character, under the name ''Torchy's Togs''. These were popular not only among younger readers who enjoyed the dolls and teenage readers who would sew their own clothes based on Torchy's fashions, but also for black servicemen who had limited choices among pin-up girls who were women of color.

== Patty-Jo 'n' Ginger ==
[[Image:070217ormes1-1-.jpegâ€Ž|thumb|''Patty Jo 'n Ginger'' strip, 1946]]
''Patty-Jo 'n' Ginger'' was a single-panel strip created by Ormes starting on September 1, 1945 <ref name="stripper2">{{cite web

A Patty Jo doll was sold in the late 1940s, and was one of the first dolls to positively portray a black girl. Part of the Terri Lee line of dolls, Patty Jo dolls were very popular gifts for Christmas 1948, and are now collector's items. <ref name="pdm">{{cite web

Jackie Ormes retired from cartooning in the 1960s, although she continued creating art, including mural and portraits. 

Ormes was a passionate [[Fashion doll|doll]] [[Collectibles|collector]] with 150 dolls in her collection, and she was active in the United Federation of Doll Clubs chapter in Chicago.

She was also on the board of directors for the [[DuSable Museum|DuSable Museum of African-American History and Art]]. <ref name="aar"/>
