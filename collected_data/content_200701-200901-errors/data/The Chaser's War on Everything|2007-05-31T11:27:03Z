'''''The Chaser's War on Everything''''' (often shortened to '''''The War''''' by The Chaser cast) is a satirical television comedy series broadcast on [[ABC TV]] in [[Australia]].  The series is produced by satire group [[The Chaser]].  Returning is [[Chris Taylor (comedian)|Chris Taylor]] (who is also the show's script editor), [[Julian Morrow]] (now acting as executive producer), [[Craig Reucassel]], [[Andrew Hansen]] and [[Chas Licciardello]]. [[Dominic Knight]] also returned as a writer, but does not play a major on-screen role.  [[Charles Firth]]'s role is downplayed due to his move to the [[United States]], although he still does roving reports for the show.

In [[December]] [[2006]] ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' won an [[Australian Film Institute]] Award for 'Best Television Comedy Series' and [[Andrew Hansen]] won an AFI Award for 'Best Performance in a Television Comedy.'<ref>{{cite website|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791055/awards|title=Awards for "The Chaser's War on Everything"|publisher=IMDB Awards list}}</ref>

In [[May]] [[2007]], the program was nominated for the [[TV Week]] [[Logie Award|Logie]] award "Most Outstanding Comedy Program".<ref name="Logies">

|publisher=ninemsn Pty Ltd.}}</ref>

A [[DVD]] of the first thirteen episodes of Season One was released on [[August 17]] [[2006]]. A second [[DVD]] with episodes 14-26 was released on [[November 1]] [[2006]]. Season Two of the series is currently airing every Wednesday at 9p.m. ([[AEST]]) on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]. A replay of the show is also shown every Friday at 11pm on ABC and every Sunday at 8.30p.m. on [[ABC2]].

==Show Concept==
The show's studio segments are performed panel-style in front of a live audience on a set reminiscent of where the Chaser group used to meet. These segments are interspersed with pre-produced location items and fake ads. The series looks at all issues and attacks a wide range of current topics in politics and the media.

==Season 2==
In lead up to the Season 2 return, now aired in prime time<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/pranksters-slated-for-prime-time/2007/01/27/1169788741631.html|title=ABC pranksters slated for prime time|date=[[2007-01-28]]|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>, the team produced a live webcast of people counting down to the first episode of the season.
New segments have also been developed and the opening sequence has been reworked with a [[Mission Impossible]] style theme. The new timeslot of 9pm on Wednesday nights has resulted in an impressive increase to the shows ratings. Despite being in direct competition with regularly high rating shows on commercial networks, weekly ratings of close to 1.5 million viewers have been achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=11885|title=Media Spy - Wednesday 9 May - Forums|date=[[2007-05-10]]|publisher=[[Media Spy]]}}</ref>

==Segments on the Show==
{{spoiler}}
Segments in {{fontcolor|#F28500||'''orange'''}} were in Season 1, but so far have not been in Season 2. Segments in {{fontcolor|#009900||'''green'''}} denote a new segment introduced in Season 2. Segments in '''black''' have been in both seasons.

===Prominent Segments===

These have appeared on the show as the most prominent segments, forming the backbone of the show.

* '''"What Have We Learnt from Current Affairs This Week?"''' -- Pokes fun at programs ''[[Today Tonight]]'' and ''[[A Current Affair (Australia)|A Current Affair]]'', keeping scores for every story matching a category such as "Menace To Society", "Old People Screwed Over" and "People Cheating The System". Most segments feature a lesson on their reporting techniques. Subjects covered include how to spot 'dodgy' guys, how to identify the different types of experts (including those who "flip pages" and "click mice"), and the art of network cross-promotion. They also make fun of both shows' tendency to come to fast inaccurate conclusions. In one of the episodes they held the What Have We Learnt From Current Affairs This Week? Oscars and in the final episode of Season 1, they presented the "What Have We Learned From Current Affairs This Week Awards". Andrew and Chas also presented ''A Current Affair'' with the "Slightly Less Crap Than Today Tonight Award". In Season 2, there has been a reduction in the frequency of this segment, in favour of new segments ''"The News According To Fox"'' and ''"What You Missed On Cable"''.

* '''Surprise Spruiker''' -- A shop "spruiker" (Andrew Hansen) attempts to help various institutions sell things, such as [[Giorgio Armani]] suits, [[WorkChoices]] or [[Dell]] laptops, by turning up outside with a microphone and speaker and spruiking out of his own generosity. His wireless speaker is generally carried out of range of the microphone by security, and he is escorted away. In the final episode of season one, the Crazy Warehouse guy and the Surprise Spruiker had a stand off (using special effects to create the situation, as they are both played by Hansen) in which the Crazy Warehouse guy crammed the speaker over the Surprise Spruiker's head.

* '''"Pursuit Trivia"''' -- Julian Morrow tests the general knowledge of a politician or celebrity by asking a [[Trivial Pursuit]] question from a game card in his hand at an interview or press conference.  As yet only two people, [[Kevin Rudd]] and [[Shannon Noll]], have successfully answered a question. In a deleted scene on the DVD release of the show, Alex Lloyd repeatedly asked for more questions, until he also got one right.

* '''"Scenes from the Life of the Crazy Warehouse Guy"''' -- A stereotypical announcer (Andrew Hansen) from a [[persian rug]] [[warehouse]] [[television advertisement]] uses his unique speaking style in everyday situations such as ordering [[McDonald's]], asking for help in a public library or talking on a mobile phone in a crowded [[tram]]. Most of this segment for the first season was shot on the same day near the start of the season. In the [[August 11]] [[2006]] episode the Crazy Warehouse Guy appeared in the studio, playing the piano and singing a duet with [[Emily Taheny]] from [[Comedy Inc.]]  The song was a modified version of [[George Gershwin]]'s "[[Let's Call the Whole Thing Off]]". In the final episode of the first series, the Crazy Warehouse Guy met with the Surprise Spruiker (Andrew Hansen's other recurring character) at the Rug Warehouse and had a stand-off.

* {{fontcolor|#F28500||'''"In Other News..."'''}} -- Julian and Craig look at the news for this week and put foward their point of view of issues, also featuring various stunts relating to the news.

* '''"Firth in the USA"''' -- [[Charles Firth]], now living in America, performs some kind of stunt or conducts some kind of interview. Segments included Firth trying to get into [[Yale University]]'s '[[Skull and Bones]]' [[secret society]]), attempting to be thrown out of more corporate headquarters in one day than [[Michael Moore]] has in his entire career and flirting with male Christian fundamentalists. He also once went to [[Africa]] to see if products that stated they were "world famous" really were. The episode where Firth promotes to the Americans that many "famous landmarks" are located in Australia has attracted acclaim, as it showed that the Americans interviewed had believed that the [[Great Wall of China]] is located in Darwin, and that the "real" [[Mount Rushmore]] is in Australia as well.

* '''"Mr Ten Questions"''' -- Andrew Hansen shows up at a press conference and proceeds to ask 10 questions (which vary in degrees of relevance) without letting the interviewee speak until he has read out the list. So far [[Anthony LaPaglia]] is the only person to successfully answer all the questions, he did however get prompts from Andrew.

* '''"The Ad Roadtest"''' -- The team recreate situations shown in advertisements to see if they would work in real life. Examples include the confidentiality of [[Oral-B]] [[dentist]]s, if the use of [[Axe (deodorant)#Release of Clix|Lynx 'Clix' deodorant]] really does attract more girls, if Godfrey's vacuum cleaners really can lift up bowling balls, and whether dancing can result in getting a job, as evident in the [[Carlton Draught]] commercial.

* {{fontcolor|#F28500||'''"A Message From Osama Bin Laden"'''}} -- An existing video of the infamous terrorist [[Osama Bin Laden]] is subbed with incorrect and humorous subtitles, often declaring a [[Jihad]] on various people for arbitrary irritations.  Videos of [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] and [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] have also been used in a similar manner.

* '''"Citizens' Infringement Officer"''' -- Julian gives out fines to people for absurd reasons. For example  giving fake fines to parking inspectors, people with "wanker" number plates, bad mobile phone ringtones, inappropriate baby names and unattractive tattoos.

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"The Fixers"'''}} -- Julian and Craig take on tough problems and offer an easy fix. Such problems include David Hicks, Chas' smell and recycled water. It can be seen as a replacement for the "In Other News" segment from Season 1.

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"If Life Were A Musical"'''}} -- Members of the cast go to the public, targeting a specific person with a problem, and behave as though they are in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-esque musical.

===Occasional Segments===

These segments support the show, however do not feature prominently.

* {{fontcolor|#F28500||'''"Famous Face Off"'''}} -- Two "masters" in a particular field compete to be the best in an endeavour such as tongue-twisting newsreading or "[[goalkeeper|blocking]]" reforms in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]].

* {{fontcolor|#F28500||'''"The 2:30 Report"'''}} -- In this segment Chas and Julian review the worst of late-night television, such as late night game shows and Christian programming.

* '''"What Have We Learnt From History?"''' -- In this segment the cast test whether people today have learnt a lesson from events in the past, for example the invasion of the [[Trojan Horse]], the story of Genesis or the German Invasion of Poland in WWll.  <!-- Good idea to keep it down to 3 otherwise there would be too many examples -->

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"The News According To Fox"'''}} -- In a similar fashion to "What Have We Learned from Current Affairs This Week?", Chas and Andrew satirically criticise the bias of the popular American [[Fox News Channel]].

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"Clive The Slightly-Too-Loud Commuter"'''}} -- Andrew goes onto public transport and begins to talk too loudly on his mobile phone about very personal issues such as drugs or genital health.

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"What You Missed on Cable"'''}} -- An occasional segment which shows the oddities of some programs on cable and sometimes comparing them to bland programming on the [[ABC TV|ABC]]. Talk show [[Maury (TV series)|Maury]] features prominently in this segment.

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"Anna Coren's [[Segue]] of the Week"'''}} -- A very occasional segment, integrated into "What Have We Learnt from Current Affairs This Week?", looking at Coren's transitions between stories on ''Today Tonight''.

* {{fontcolor|#009900||'''"Nut Job of the Week"'''}} -- The team takes a look at the "special people in our society" - people who have "alternative views". For example, [[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]]'s theory on how to acquire your deepest desires by the [[Law of Attraction]] was tested in the general public.

== Recurring themes ==
*'''Songs''' — Andrew Hansen performs songs with a humorous theme. Some include [[Prolix]] [[Songwriter]] (a songwriter who is prolix); Hill$ong (a parody of [[Hillsong]]); boyBand (a parody on [[boyband|boybands]]) and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Comedian]] (a parody of [[Billy Connolly]]). Although all the music and vocals are by Andrew, the other members often appear to be singing or playing but they are in fact miming or pretending to play. The songs are usually written by Andrew or Chris.
*'''Stunts''' — The Chaser team approach people and perform stunts. Examples include Craig trying to hug John Howard whilst holding an axe and a chainsaw (after a schoolkid hugged Howard whilst holding a screw driver). Famously, Chas also once tried to sell 'better' merchandise to NRL's Bulldogs supporters, including knuckledusters, balaclavas and fake knives. 
*'''Television Advertisements''' — Throughout the series the team create satirical [[television advertisements]]. These advertise a false item or mock existing ads. Some notable ones include 'sandy' toilet paper, toilet paper made out of sandpaper; and a parody of the the government ad, 'Violence Against Women - Australia Says No', in which they changed it to, 'Appearing In Government Ads - Australia Says No'. This was also used to promote the new season (2007) of the show on the ABC, where they changed it to state that they had no new material.
*'''Movie Trailers''' — The team creates parody trailers for existing movies. Some include ''When a Telemarketer Calls'' (''[[When a Stranger Calls]]''), ''Brokeback Mountain: Christian Edition'' (''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''), ''American [[Pi|π]]'' (''[[American Pie]]''), and ''[[Carlton & United Beverages|Carlton United]] 93'' (''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'').
*'''Community Opinion''' — One of the team members goes out to get the community opinion. One includes Craig asking tourists about the new Australian tourist campaign, '[[So where the bloody hell are you?]]', which has the subject of much media attention of the use of the word "bloody". Instead, Craig asked opinions on 'new' campaigns, including; 'Don't be a prick, visit Australia,', 'Australia, it shits all over everywhere else' and 'Fuck, Australia's fucking great so why the fuck aren't you here motherfucker?'. In another segment, Julian asked people if they thought iPods were anti-social, while listening to an [[iPod]] himself.
*'''Door to Door''' — One or two members go door-knocking around the neighbourhood. Some sketches include asking people if they want to join Al-Qaeda, if they can keep homeless people at their house for the duration of the Commonwealth Games and door to door spam.
*'''Chas' Challenge''' — A challenge is put forward to Chas. Some include [[bonehead|boneheading]] at the Logies and achieving the world's shortest [[taxi]] fare (under 20 metres).

==Controversies and well known stunts==
Some of the events on the show have received news coverage.

===Julian Morrow's novelty cheque===

On [[February 8]] [[2006]], before the first episode of the show had screened, Julian Morrow approached [[Australian Wheat Board]] executive Charles Stott with a fake novelty cheque, made out to [[Saddam Hussein]], and asked Stott to sign it.  Stott's lawyer said his client felt intimidated by the stunt,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200602/s1565449.htm|title=AWB inquiry not laughing over 'The Chaser' stunt|date=[[2006-02-08]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> and the footage of the stunt was not shown in the first episode as scheduled due to "legal reasons". In the first episode to go to air, Julian Morrow responded, by raising the point that Charles Stott has done business with Saddam Hussein, one of the most frightening and powerful dictators on Earth, yet he is intimidated by a large novelty cheque. The footage of this stunt does appear as a bonus on the show's first DVD.

===Chris Taylor on Sunrise===
[[Image:Taylorsunrise.jpg|thumb|right|Chris Taylor on Sunrise]]

On the ninth episode of the show, Chris Taylor announced that he planned to break-up with his wife of seven years, but he didn't want to ask her "the usual boring way," but do "something special, something she'll remember". The segment shows several of Taylor's attempts to "pop the question," including hanging a sign over a freeway, and "proposing" on a big screen at an outdoor festival. For the finale, Taylor introduces the interview of him on the morning television program, ''[[Sunrise (TV program)|Sunrise]]''. In the interview, Taylor asks the host if he can send a quick message to his partner, he then proceeds to tell her to "Get the fuck out of my life". This finale from the segment was leaked onto the internet and has been widely distributed by email. Many viewers believed the segment was actually real but Taylor admitted on national radio station [[Triple J]] that it was set up. It was actually filmed after ''[[Sunrise (TV program)|Sunrise]]'' went to air and shown on ''The Chaser's War on Everything'' only at this time. Channel Seven also edited the footage and edited in all the onscreen graphics before giving them the footage.  The hosts of Sunrise admitted it was a set up. However they did not know what Taylor was going to say because he only asked if he could do a bit for the show. Sunrise replayed a censored version of the clip on [[August 21]] [[2006]] when they had the Chaser team on the show promoting their new DVD.

===Chas Licciardello's Bulldogs incident===

On [[July 14]] [[2006]], [[Chas Licciardello]] was charged with offensive conduct after attempting to sell fake [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] merchandise outside an [[National Rugby League|NRL]] game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,19796246-26619,00.html|title=ABC to probe Chaser prank|publisher=[[News Limited]]|date=[[2006-07-15]]}}</ref> The merchandise included plastic [[knuckledusters]] and [[balaclava]]s in the Bulldogs' colours, and was supposed to satirise recent violent clashes between rugby league fans.  Several Bulldogs fans took offense and attempted to attack Licciardello, and as a result he was charged for offensive behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/chaser-canterbury-joke-gets-no-laughs/2006/07/15/1152637916434.html|title=Chaser Canterbury joke gets no laughs|date=[[2006-07-16]]|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> On the broadcast following his arrest, Licciardello appeared onstage in handcuffs and within an iron cage. On that same episode, he apologised for his actions, claiming to understand why the Bulldogs fans were offended: because Canterbury Bulldogs fans much prefer to use their fists. This statement was accompanied by footage of Bulldog's supporters assaulting opposing team supporter's during a match. After appearing in court with co-star Julian Morrow, Licciardello pleaded not guilty and the matter was adjourned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/chaser-star-pleads-not-guilty/2006/08/29/1156617314466.html|title=Chaser star pleads not guilty|date=[[2006-07-16]]|publisher=[[The Age]]}}</ref> On [[January 23]], [[2007]], Licciardello was found [[not guilty]] of the offensive behaviour charge.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1831871.htm|title=Chaser star cleared over Bulldogs stunt|date=[[2007-01-23]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>

===Craig Reucassel's axe stunt===

On [[2 August]] [[2006]], Craig Reucassel responded to a news story about a private school student who had hugged Prime Minister [[John Howard]] while holding a [[screwdriver]] during one of the PM's morning walks.  To test the Prime Minister's security arrangements, he approached John Howard during a morning walk and asked for a hug while holding a large plastic [[battle axe]].  Reucassel did receive the hug, but a later approach while holding a running [[chainsaw]] was not so successful.  There was much debate surrounding whether or not to turn on the chainsaw and whether they would be shot at for doing this.<ref>{{Citation

Cut out from this segment was the attempt between the axe and the chainsaw, in which Reucassel was holding a four-point-star mace. He did not achieve his hug on that occasion, either. Anybody who listens to the DVD commentaries of the Chaser's War on Everything will know just how difficult it was for them to actually find John Howard at all.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/we-are-amused/2006/08/02/1154198182710.html|title=Chaser axe stunt gets Howard going|date=[[2006-08-02]]|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>

===Julian Morrow's Virgin Blue ticket prank===

On [[16 August]] [[2006]], Julian Morrow purchased two airline tickets on the [[Virgin Blue]] airline under the names "[[Al-Qaeda|Al Kyder]]" and "[[Terrorist|Terry Wrist]]", checked in using the automated check-in, and then did not show up for boarding, so that the names would be read out in a final boarding call over [[Kingsford Smith International Airport|Sydney Airport]]'s public address system.<ref name="virginblue">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/a-stunt-too-far/2006/08/18/1155407999231.html|title=Al Kyder: Virgin on the ridiculous|date=[[2006-08-18]]|publisher=[[The Age]]}}</ref> The prank was acknowledged by Virgin Blue who criticised the use of taxpayer dollars in the "childish humour".<ref name="virginblue"/>

===Craig Reucassel's Speedos===

On [[March 19]] [[2007]], during a campaign appearance for the [[New South Wales general election, 2007|New South Wales State Election]], the then-[[Opposition (Australia)|opposition leader]] [[Peter Debnam]] was confronted by Craig Reucassel wearing nothing but [[Speedos]] and a baseball cap <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Speedowearing-comedian-confronts-Debnam/2007/03/19/1174152947020.html|title=Speedo wearing comedian confronts Debnam|date=[[2007-03-19]]|publisher=[[The Age]]}}</ref>, making fun of Debnam's campaign appearances in the swimwear.  When TV cameras remained focused on Reucassel rather than Mr Debnam, he said, "Sorry, I'm not Peter Debnam, he's over there. Just because I'm wearing this doesn't mean I'm Peter Debnam".  Reucassel stuck around for the press conference but failed to draw a response from the opposition leader, and was again ignored when he went to shake Mr Debnam's hand. Although he wasn't quite ignored by a security team as he attempted to enter Mr Debnam's car replying whilst being pushed away from the car, "Oh sorry I'm not Peter Debnam I forgot".

==Video podcasting==

[[Image:chaservodcastblock.png|thumb|right|The ABC has stopped allowing visitors from outside of Australia from accessing ''The Chaser's War On Everything'' vodcasts]]

On [[July 27]] [[2006]] the ABC announced that entire episodes of The Chaser's War on Everything, along with [[jtv]], would be made available for download via a [[vodcast]]ing system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s1698372.htm|title=ABC launches Vodcasting|date=[[2006-07-27]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref>  Just days after appearing on the Australian [[iTunes]] podcasting directory, the show took the number one position. The first season vodcast episodes contained all material originally broadcast but some shows in the second season featured copyrighted music (such as the famous theme to [[Cops]], [[Bad Boys]]), and so had to be removed from the podcast.

As of Season 2, Episode 6, which aired on May 2, 2007, the ABC has stopped allowing visitors from outside of Australia from accessing the vodcast. Instead, they receive the following message:

"We're sorry, this video podcast is made available for use by persons located in Australia only. If you are not located in Australia, you are not authorised to use this podcast."

===YouTube===
Hundreds of clips from the show were pulled from video sharing site [[YouTube]] after a fake [[DMCA]] take down notice.<ref>

==Trivia==
*Original names for the series which were rejected by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] include 'Thank Allah It's Friday!' and 'The Chaser's Age Of Terror Variety Hour' .<ref>{{Citation
