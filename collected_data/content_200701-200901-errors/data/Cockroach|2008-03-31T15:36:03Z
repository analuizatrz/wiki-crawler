'''Cockroaches''' (or simply "roaches") are [[insect]]s of the order '''Blattodea'''. This name derives from the [[Latin]] word for "cockroach", ''blatta''.

Among the most well-known species are the [[American cockroach]], ''Periplaneta americana'', which is about 30&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] (1 inch) long, the [[German cockroach]], ''Blattella germanica'', about 15&nbsp;mm (1/2 inch) long, the [[Asian cockroach]], ''Blattella asahinai'', also about 15&nbsp;mm (1/2 inch) in length, and the [[Oriental cockroach]], ''Blatta orientalis'', about 25&nbsp;mm (3/4 inch). [[Tropics|Tropical]] cockroaches are often much bigger, and extinct cockroach relatives such as the [[Carboniferous]] ''[[Archimylacris]]'' and the [[Permian]] ''[[Apthoroblattina]]'' were several times as large as these. Cockroaches are generally considered [[pest (animal)|pest]]s; however, only about 30 species (less than 1%) infest urban habitats.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

==Evolutionary history and relationships==
The earliest cockroach-like fossils are from the [[Carboniferous]] period between 354&ndash;295 million years ago. However, these fossils differ from modern cockroaches in having long [[ovipositor]]s and are the ancestors of [[mantid]]s as well as modern cockroaches. The first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal ovipositors appear in the early [[Cretaceous]].

[[Mantodea]], [[Isoptera]], and Blattodea are usually combined by [[entomologists]] into a higher group called [[Dictyoptera]]. Current evidence strongly suggests that [[termite]]s have evolved directly from true cockroaches, and many authors now consider termites to be a family of cockroaches<ref>{{cite news | title = Termites are 'social cockroaches' | language = English | publisher = BBC News | date = [[13 April]] [[2007]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6553219.stm | accessdate =  }}</ref><ref>Eggleton, P. &al. (2007), ''Biological Letters'', [[June 7]], cited in ''Science News'' vol. 171, p. 318 </ref>, as Blattodea excluding Isoptera is not a [[monophyletic]] group[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6553219.stm].

==Biology==
Cockroaches are most common in tropical and [[subtropical]] climates. Some species are in close association with human dwellings and widely found around garbage or in the kitchen. Cockroaches are generally [[omnivorous]] with the exception of the [[wood]]-eating genus ''[[Cryptocercus]]''; these roaches are incapable of digesting [[cellulose]] themselves, but have symbiotic relationships with various [[protozoa]]ns and [[bacteria]] that digest the cellulose, allowing them to extract the nutrients. The similarity of these symbionts to those in [[termite]]s are such that the genus ''Cryptocercus'' has been believed to be more closely related to [[termite]]s than to other cockroaches<ref>Eggleton, P. (2001). Termites and trees: a review of recent advances in termite phylogenetics. Insectes Sociaux 48: 187-193.</ref>, and current research strongly supports this hypothesis of relationships<ref>[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/20/6/907.pdf Evidence for Cocladogenesis Between Diverse Dictyopteran Lineages and Their Intracellular Endosymbionts]</ref>.

[[Image:Cockroach nymph australia.jpg|thumb|200 px|left|Nymph of a cockroach, 3 mm in length]]
Cockroaches, like all insects, breathe through a system of tubes called [[tracheae]]. The tracheae of insects are attached to the [[spiracle]]s, excluding the head. Thus, all insects, including cockroaches, can breathe without a head. The valves open when the [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] level in the insect rises to a high level; then the CO<sub>2</sub> [[Diffusion|diffuses]] out of the tracheae to the outside and fresh [[dioxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]] diffuses in. The tracheal system brings the air directly to [[cell]]s because they branch continually like a tree until their finest divisions tracheoles are associated with each cell, allowing gaseous oxygen to dissolve in the cytoplasm lying across the fine cuticle lining of the tracheole. CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses out of the cell into the tracheole.

Insects do not have lungs and thus do not actively breathe in the vertebrate lung manner. However, in some very large insects the diffusion process may not be sufficient to provide oxygen at the necessary rate and body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air out and in the spiracles and one can actually call this breathing.[http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/kunkel/cockroach_faq.html#Q21]

Cockroaches can survive sterile surgical decapitation for a very long period, especially if recently fed, but of course become unable to feed and die within a few weeks.<ref name='Sci-Am 2007-03-15'> {{cite journal|title=Fact or Fiction?: A Cockroach Can Live without Its Head|journal=Scientific American|date=2007-03-15|first=Charles|last=Choi|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=5244F57C-E7F2-99DF-3E40BA295C3DCC0A&sc=I100322|format=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

[[Image:Blatella germanica cdc.jpg|thumb|Female ''[[Blatella germanica]]'' with ootheca]]
Female cockroaches are sometimes seen carrying egg cases on the end of their abdomen; the egg case of the German cockroach holds about 30&ndash;40 long, thin eggs, packed like frankfurters in the case called an [[ootheca]]. The eggs hatch from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air and are initially bright white [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] that continue inflating themselves with air and harden and darken within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while [[ecdysis|molting]] has led to many individuals to claim to have seen albino cockroaches.

[[Image:Snodgrass common household roaches.png|thumb|left|'''Common household roaches''' A. [[German cockroach]], B. [[American cockroach]], C. [[Australian cockroach]], D&E. [[Oriental cockroach]] (♀ & ♂)]]
A female German cockroach carries an egg capsule containing around 40 eggs. She drops the capsule prior to hatching. Development from eggs to adults takes 3-4 months. Cockroaches live up to a year. The female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, it can produce 300-400 offspring. Other species of cockroach, however, can produce an extremely high number of eggs in a lifetime, but only needs to be impregnated once to be able to lay eggs for the rest of its life.

The world's largest cockroach is the Australian [[giant burrowing cockroach]], which can grow to 9&nbsp;cm in length and weigh more than 30&nbsp;[[gram]]s. Comparable in size is the giant cockroach ''[[Blaberus giganteus]]'', which grows to a similar length but is not as heavy.

Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and will run away when exposed to light. A peculiar exception is the [[Oriental cockroach]], which is attracted to light. 

Cockroaches are among the hardiest insects on the planet, some species capable of remaining active for a month without food, or being able to survive on limited resources like the glue from the back of postage stamps.<ref name='M & V E'>{{cite book|last=Mullen|first=Gary

It is popularly suggested that cockroaches will "inherit the earth" if humanity destroys itself in a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Cockroaches do indeed have a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrates, with the lethal dose perhaps 6 to 15 times that for humans. However, they are not exceptionally radiation-resistant compared to other insects, such as the [[fruit fly]]&nbsp;.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1567313.htm|title=Cockroaches & Radiation |accessmonthday=10 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref> The [[MythBusters]] of [[Discovery Channel]] had tested this popular belief in an episode aired on January 30, 2008, and had confirmed that fruit flies do indeed have a higher resistance to radiation than cockroaches.

The cockroach's ability to withstand radiation better than human beings can be explained in terms of the cell cycle. Cells are more vulnerable to effects of radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once when in its molting cycle, which at most happens weekly in a juvenile roach. The cells of the cockroach take roughly 48 hours to complete a molting cycle, which would give time enough for radiation to affect it but not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time. This would mean some would be unaffected by the initial radiation and thus survive, at least until the fallout arrived.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/kunkel/cockroach_faq.html#Q5 |title=Are cockroaches resistant to radiation? |author =Joseph G.

==Behavior==
Cockroaches have been shown to exhibit [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent behaviour]].<ref name="viegas">{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/cockroach.html |title=Cockroaches Make Group Decisions |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |author=Jennifer Viegas |accessmonthday=10 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Research being conducted at the [[University of Florida]] shows that cockroaches leave chemical trails in their feces. Other cockroaches will follow these trails to discover sources of food and water, and also discover where other cockroaches are hiding. Research has shown that group-based decision making is responsible for more complex behavior such as resource allocation.  A study where 50 cockroaches were placed in a dish with three shelters with a capacity for 40 insects in each, the insects arranged themselves in two shelters with 25 insects in each, leaving the third shelter empty.  When the capacity of the shelters was increased to more than 50 insects per shelter, all of the cockroaches arranged themselves in one shelter.  Researchers found a balance between cooperation and competition exists in group decision-making behavior found in cockroaches.  The models used in this research can also explain the group dynamics of other insects and animals.<ref name="viegas"/>

Another study tested the hypothesis that cockroaches use just two pieces of information to decide where to go under those conditions: how dark it is and how many of their friends are there. The study conducted by José Halloy and colleagues at the [[Free University of Brussels]] and other European institutions created a set of tiny [[robot]]s that to the roaches appear to be other roaches and can thus alter the roaches perception of [[critical mass]]. The robots were also specially scented so that they would be accepted by the real roaches.<ref>{{cite web

== Cockroaches and health risks ==
A 2005 US national study on factors that affect [[asthma]] in inner-city children shows that cockroach allergens appear to worsen asthma symptoms more than other known triggers.  This study, funded by the [[United States|US]] [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] (NIEHS) and the US [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID), is the first large-scale study to rank asthma triggers according to severity.

Additionally, a 2005 research study, sponsored by the [[National Pest Management Association]] (NPMA), shows a disparity in homeowner knowledge about this link.  Only 10% of homeowners in the USA feel that cockroaches are a threat to their family's health.

==Habitat==
[[Image:Bush Cockroach.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A bush cockroach]]
Cockroaches live in a wide range of environments around the world.  Pest species of cockroaches adapt readily to a variety of environments, but prefer warm conditions found within buildings.  Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments and do not fare well in the average household.  Only about 20 species of cockroaches out of the known 4,000-7,500 are suited to thrive in the typical home.

Free-standing houses sited near wilderness areas or those with elaborate gardens often remain strikingly cockroach-free without chemical control or any particularly rigorous attention to hygiene. The explanation appears to be the surrounding habitat carries a healthy population of inoffensive non-invasive species of cockroaches, in turn supporting a population of cockroach predators, which do not discriminate between invasive and non-invasive species.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}
    
Often when such houses are sprayed with insecticide for the first time, the most noticeable effect is the appearance of large numbers of dead predatory species such as [[centipedes]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

==Pest control==
[[Image:Roach control.jpg|thumb|right|165px|Cockroach control, with cockroach baits, boric acid, and hydramethylnon gel.]]
There are numerous parasites and predators of cockroaches, but few of them have proven to be highly effective for biological control. [[Wasps]] in the family [[Evaniidae]] are perhaps the most effective insect predators, as they attack the egg cases, and wasps in the family [[Ampulicidae]] are predators on adult and nymphal cockroaches (e.g., ''[[Ampulex compressa]]''). The [[house centipede]], however, is probably the most effective control agent of cockroaches, though most homeowners find the centipedes themselves objectionable.
Preventative measures include keeping all food stored away in sealed containers, using garbage cans with a tight lid, frequent cleaning in the kitchen, and regular vacuuming. Any water leaks, such as dripping taps, should also be repaired. It is also helpful to seal off any entry points, such as holes around baseboards, in between kitchen cabinets, pipes, doors, and windows with some steel wool or copper mesh and some cement, putty or silicone caulk. Once a cockroach infestation occurs, chemical controls may help alleviate the problem. Bait stations, gels containing [[hydramethylnon]] or [[fipronil]], as well as [[boric acid]] powder, are toxic to cockroaches.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population.  Additionally, pest control products containing [[deltamethrin]] are very effective.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Lowering the habitat temperature below freezing point may render most of the eggs infertile. This method may be practical in rural homes but it is highly unlikely to work in large cities.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

In Asia, car owners are known to use Pandan leaves as a natural cockroach repellent in their vehicles.<ref>Li J. and Ho S.H.

American cockroaches have been known to live up to three months without food and a month without water. Frequently living outdoors, although preferring warm climates and considered "cold intolerant," they are resilient enough to survive freezing temperatures.
In Russia, some people, after opening all cupboards, leave a saucepan half-full of sulfur burning on a gas ring, then quickly come back in to switch it off (with gas mask)and then go for a week end or so. This is said to be protective for ten years.

==Popular culture==
{{Trivia|date=March 2008}}
In popular culture, cockroaches are often regarded as vile and extremely resilient pests, due to their shiny [[exoskeleton]]s (making them look slimy, contrary to their fastidious habits), and their size, unusual for a scavenging insect.

The character Dr. Berenbaum (based on the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] entomologist) suggests that it is actually swarms of cockroaches that are responsible for most [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] sightings because they can generate an electro-static field which can be illuminated dependent on atmospheric conditions. In one of the scenes, a cockroach that escaped can be seen crawling over the camera, making it appear that the viewer's television has become infested. Though the shot was not planned, the producers decided to leave it in the episode.
*''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', Alf inadvertently releases a [[Melmac (planet)|Melmacian]] cockroach in the house.  When it is sprayed with [[insecticide]], it grows bigger until it is large enough to eat him.  He discovers that a bottle of perfume will kill the cockroach.

Actually, the type of bug into which Gregor transforms is not specified, though it is referred to as "[[vermin]]" and the little physical description offered could match either a cockroach or beetle. Conversely, [[Tyler Knox]] published a noir comedy in 2006 called "Kockroach" (William Morrow) in which a cockroach wakes up one morning as a man and becomes a leading gangster in [[Times Square]] during the 1950s.
*''[[Revolt of the Cockroach People]]'', an autobiographical novel by [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], cockroaches are used as a metaphor for oppressed and downtrodden minorities in US society in the 1960s and 70s, particularly Mexican-Americans.  There are several references to the folk song [[La Cucaracha]] throughout the novel.

*''[[Deadly Rooms of Death]]'' (DROD), cockroaches are considered as flesh-eating monsters, which infest dungeons of all kinds.
*The role playing game ''[[Werewolf: The Apocalypse]]'' feature a tribe of werewolf, the ''[[Glass Walkers]]'' who have the unusual totem Cockroach as their spiritual patron, the Glass Walkers find themselves semi-pariahs among their brethren for their love for the city (and, to a lesser extent, for their affinity for humanity and its technology).

;Music
*Los Angeles rapper [[Russ Parr|Bobby Jimmy]] released the song "Roaches" as a parody of [[Timex Social Club]]'s hit song "Rumors".  Its chorus line was ''Look at all these roaches / Around me everyday / Need somethin' strong / To make 'em go away''.
*Hardcore rapper [[Necro]] has a track called "Cockroaches" in which he raps about people's fear and/or dislike of cockroaches.
*The album [[Infest]] from [[Papa Roach]] features a large roach on the cover. 
*The [[Shuffle Demons]] did a song in 1986, ''Get Out Of My House, Roach'', on the album [[Streetniks]]
*[[Sleepytime Gorilla Museum]]'s second studio album, [[Of Natural History]] features the song ''Cockroach,'' which describes cockroaches with disgust.
*The album [[Lonesome Crowded West]] published in [[1997]] by [[United States|American]] [[indie rock]] band [[Modest Mouse]] contains a song titled ''Doin' the Cockroach''.

;Nicknames
*[[Boxing]] coach [[Freddie Roach]] was nicknamed La Cucaracha (The Cockroach) when he was still competing as a fighter.
*In Australian [[rugby league]], the [[New South Wales state rugby league team|New South Wales State of Origin Team]] are informally known as the Cockroaches, due to the commonality of the cockroach as a household pest in [[New South Wales|that state]]. Their opponents, the [[Queensland State of Origin Team]], are known as the [[Cane Toad]]s, after [[Queensland|that state]]'s most common pest.

==History==
Some of the earliest writings with regards to cockroaches encourage their use as medicine. [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] (''[[1st century]]''), [[Kamal al-Din al-Damiri]] and [[Abu Hanifa ad-Dainuri]] (''[[9th century]]'') all offered medicines that either suggest grinding them up with oil or boiling. The list of ailments included earaches, open wounds and "gynecological disorders."{{Fact|date=April 2007}}
