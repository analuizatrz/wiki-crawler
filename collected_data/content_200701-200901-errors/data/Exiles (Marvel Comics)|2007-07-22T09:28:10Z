The '''Exiles''' are a group of [[fiction]]al [[comic book]] characters from [[Marvel Comics]]. The Exiles, created by writer [[Judd Winick]] and artist [[Mike McKone]], consists of characters from different dimensions, or realities, which have been removed from time and space in order to correct problems (often called “hiccups") in various alternate worlds and divergent timelines in the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]. The team usually is made up of six members and each time a member is killed or returned to his or her home reality, a new member is introduced and joins the team. However, the series is notable for the number of characters who stay dead, in contrast to the [[Comic book death|frequent resurrections]] that occur in the main Marvel and DC continuities. This is presumably because of the possibilities allowed by alternate versions of characters, whose fates are entirely separate to their mainstream counterparts. So far only Deadpool and Hyperion have been revived. The Exiles were originally given missions by the [[Timebroker]], through a wrist-worn communication device called the Tallus.

== Fictional team biography ==
The Exiles team consisted originally of [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] (Clarice Ferguson, from the [[Age of Apocalypse]] continuity), [[Mimic (comics)#Exiles|Mimic]] (Calvin Rankin), Magnus (son of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]), [[Thunderbird (comics)#Exiles|Thunderbird]] (John Proudstar), [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]] (Talia Josephine "T.J." Wagner, daughter of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Scarlet Witch]]) and [[Morph (comics)|Morph]].

[[IMAGE:XMEN 05252005 0024.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Exiles #1. Art by Mike McKone.]]

When Magnus dies<ref>''Exiles'' #2</ref>, he is replaced by [[Sunfire (Exiles)|Sunfire]] (Mariko Yashida). [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Sasquatch]] (Heather Hudson) arrives when Thunderbird becomes comatose during a battle with the world-eating [[Galactus]]<ref>''Exiles'' #10</ref>.

The Exiles then discover there is a second team conscripted by the [[Timebroker]], [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]]<ref>''Exiles'' #12</ref>, whose missions typically involve killing or maiming innocents and heroes. The two teams join forces to rescue a group of children from a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] prison camp. However, the teams are told the second stage of the mission is to kill one of the children - David Richards (son of [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Franklin Richards]]) - who will apparently grow up to become a powerful super villain. Weapon X are willing to kill him, but the Exiles are not and the two teams fight until the Timebroker intervenes. Sabretooth (of the Weapon X team) agrees to stay behind and raise David Richards himself.

The [[Timebroker]] sends Blink home after a visit to a world plagued by a variant of the [[Legacy Virus]], since the team had repaired her personal broken chain in time<ref>''Exiles'' #22</ref> and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] (Illyana Rasputin) takes her place. Mimic then replaces Blink as leader, gaining the Tallus.

The Exiles arrive in the main [[Marvel Universe]] ([[Earth-616]]) where they meet the [[X-Men]] after [[Havok]]'s cancelled wedding<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #425-426</ref>. The Exiles team up with the X-Men against an evil Havok from the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' universe, who shares a body with the good Havok. After Havok is subdued, the Timebroker arrives to personally eliminate the ''Mutant X'' Havok's consciousness.<ref>''Exiles'' #28-30</ref>

After [[Sunfire (Exiles)|Sunfire]] is killed by a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]-infected [[Mimic (comics)#Exiles|Mimic]]<ref>''Exiles'' #37</ref>, she is replaced by the Exiles' former teammate [[Blink (comics)|Blink]]. During the next mission<ref>''Exiles'' #43</ref>, the Exiles and Weapon X are forced to battle each other until only six remain alive. [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] is killed by Hyperion when she attempts to switch sides and betray the Exiles. Hyperion is eventually defeated by Blink, who teleports his own [[heat vision]] into his back, paralyzing him. [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] (of Weapon X) is allowed to deliver the killing blow against Hyperion with Magik's sword, which actually kills them both, leaving five Exiles alive and their mission complete.

The Exiles visit the main Marvel Universe for a second time<ref>''Exiles'' #46-48</ref> where they are joined by [[Namora]], who replaces Magik, and are instructed to "leave their possessions and earn their wings". Reed Richards deduces this means they are to leave [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]] behind (whose power involves [[possession]]) and have [[Beak (comics)|Beak]] join the Exiles, which is confirmed by the [[Timebroker]].

===The Timebreakers===
The team are told by [[Celestial (comics)|The Celestials]] to "beware the Timebreaker, he is not what he seems"<ref>''Exiles'' #53</ref>. After this, the Timebroker's behavior becomes increasingly strange. [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Heather Hudson]] is removed from the team<ref>''Exiles'' #59</ref> without explanation and replaced with former [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]] member [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. The Tallus orders the Exiles to kill [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and despite their refusal, they are allowed to move onto a new mission (normally a mission ''must'' be completed for the Exiles to move on). Next, the Timebroker replaces Beak with [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]]<ref>''Exiles'' #60</ref>, which they are informed is a punishment for disobeying previous orders.

Eventually, the Exiles break free of the Timebroker and stage a raid on Panoptichron (also known as the "Crystal Palace"), home of the Timebroker and a location from which many parallel universes can be monitored. Here they discover that the Timebreakers are an alien race of bug-like beings who found the Panoptichron and accidentally broke a series of timelines. Lacking the power to repair the timelines, they concocted this scheme of recruiting heroes from various worlds to do their work for them.  Not only that, all previously "returned" heroes are actually in Panoptichron, frozen in blocks, along with the killed heroes. As a final twist, the evil Hyperion has broken free of his prison and has taken over Panoptichron. The Exiles defeat Hyperion, but at the cost of Namora and Holocaust's lives. Beak returns from stasis and saved the day by calling on two good versions of Hyperion for help, fulfilling his destiny as an Exile. Only Blink, Mimic, Morph, Sabretooth, Beak, and Heather Hudson remain to pick up the pieces.<ref>''Exiles'' #62-65</ref>

===World Tour===
The Exiles then return to [[Earth-616]] to take Beak home. Unfortunately, Earth-616 is dominated by the [[House of M]]. During their stay, the Exiles run afoul of the body-hopping serial killer [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]], who steals data from the Panoptichron and escapes from [[Earth-616]], leaving Beak [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]] back home<ref>''Exiles'' #69-71</ref>. The Exiles chase Proteus through several realities, including [[New Universe]]<ref>''Exiles'' #72-74</ref>, [[Marvel 2099|2099]]<ref>''Exiles'' #75-76</ref>, [[Squadron Supreme]]<ref>''Exiles'' #77-78</ref>, [[Hulk (comics)|Future Imperfect]]<ref>''Exiles'' #79-80</ref>, and [[Heroes Reborn]]<ref>''Exiles'' #81-82</ref>, before finally bringing Proteus down by trapping him in Morph’s body, which does not decay, unlike all of Proteus’ other host bodies. During the “World Tour” of hunting down Proteus, Mimic is possessed by Proteus and dies, the Exiles create divergent timelines in 2099 and the New Universe, and pick up new members [[Longshot]], [[Spider-Man 2099]], and [[Power Princess]].

The Exiles begin cleaning out the stasis gallery of former Exiles and Weapon X members and send them back home. Iron Man, Daredevil, and Angel are sent back to their respective realities alive, while every other Earth with a missing superhuman holds a funeral. Blink, at the suggestion of Power Princess, takes Mimic home to be buried with his X-Men instead of burying him in Panoptichron. Spider-Man, Sabretooth, and Heather Hudson all decided to visit their home realities. <ref>''Exiles'' #83</ref>Unfortunately, the Timebreakers ditch the Exiles when the Timebreakers believe that they are not saving realities as they should be. However, after using several squads of Wolverines to complete the next mission and failing, Logan (from [[Days of Future Past]]) and young James Howlett convince the Timebreakers that the Exiles are needed<ref>''Exiles'' #84-85</ref>. The Exiles finally resume their reality-saving missions for the first time since they discovered Panoptichron when they save a reality where the [[Silver Surfer]] has already destroyed the Earth and is trying to destroy [[Galactus]], who is the restorer of worlds in this reality<ref>''Exiles'' #86-87</ref>.

===Post-World Tour===
Then, Heather discovers an Earth inhabited by a disturbingly close approximation of the original Exiles team, complete with their own Timebroker. After the "classic Exiles" fight "the all-new Exiles" (as Morph put it), it is later revealed that the whole thing was a scheme orchestrated by the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]], who seeks revenge on the Exiles for freeing Professor X on their first mission and ruining a bet. The Exiles, past and present, join forces with the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] of that Earth to defeat the Grandmaster. The current team then leaves the Earth in the hands of the approximation Exiles.

The Exiles then take three weeks to save a chain of cracked realities, injuring Blink, Morph, and Spider-Man. They also discover that Proteus is possibly immune to metal while in Morph’s body. Meanwhile, former Exile, Thunderbird, is in the stasis gallery, dreaming of what might have been had he not become comatose.

===Enter Psylocke===
Later, [[Power Princess]] leaves the team to return to the [[Squadron Supreme]] and [[Psylocke]] is brought on board to replace her.<ref>''Exiles'' #89</ref> Blink, Longshot, and Spider-Man are brainwashed by Hydra leaving only Sabretooth to pick up Morph and Psylocke. They are sent to kill Reed Richards. Slaymaster's arrival makes them fail as Betsy faints before killing Reed. The world was erased, with the Exiles still there, but it was magically restored by Reed Richards, and Valeria Richards' amulet restores the world's population because they were being stored in the amulet. The Exiles are still there so they can help Psylocke recover from wounds inflicted by Wolverine, and to help rebuild the planet<ref>''Exiles'' #93</ref>. Meanwhile, another Slaymaster slays another Psylocke on another world. After the Exiles return to Panoptichron, they find it empty, with no equipment, Timebreakers, or Heather. Blink and Morph eventually visit Heather, who thought the Exiles were dead and left Panoptichron. Heather is now pregnant and out of commission, so [[Psylocke]] stays behind to learn more about the Panoptichron while the other Exiles resume their missions. There she experiences visions which warn her of something bad to come, while the Exiles appear on a a seemingly perfect world led by Victor Von Doom but when Blink is caught by Reed Richards she begins to discover what hides behind this facade<ref>''Exiles'' #96</ref>.

===Future===
All information below is based off of images and teasers from [http://www.marvel.com/catalog]'s online catalog previews.
*In ''Exiles'' #95, the Exiles start a new mission, continuing a 5-part arc, leading up to Exiles #100.
*''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' is a 5-issue mini-serie which will work as a cross-over between Exiles and [[Excalibur (comics)#New_Excalibur_.282005.29|New Excalibur]] debuting with issues #1 and #2 in October<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/Oct07/solicitations.html</ref>
*Nocturne will be rejoining the Exiles before the end of 2007, and a male version of Mystique will also show up in the title.

==Tallus==
The Tallus is a communications device, which is worn by the leader of the group, that was formerly used by the Timebroker to assign each mission. Blink wears the Tallus in the beginning, but it is later transferred to Sabretooth when Blink rebels against the Timebroker (later revealed to be Hyperion). Mimic also wears the Tallus for a time in Blink's absence. It is now used as a means of communication between Heather Hudson and Sabretooth on various missions.

==Weapon X==
{{main|Weapon X (Exiles)}}

First seen in ''Exiles'' #5 as a version of the Exiles that did more ruthless missions. This team had various members and its roster changed more than the Exiles. Weapon X was originally composed of [[Sabretooth (comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles|Sabretooth]], [[Garrison Kane#Exiles|Kane]], [[Mesmero#Exiles|Mesmero]], [[Alternate versions of Wolverine#Exiles & Weapon X|Wolverine]], [[David North (comics)#Exiles|Maverick]], and [[Deadpool (comics)#Exiles|Deadpool]]. The team was destroyed during the "A Blink in Time" arc, when the Timebroker wanted to downsize both teams in hopes of killing off the insane [[Hyperion (comics)#Exiles|Hyperion]], who abandoned missions to try to rule worlds.

==Exiles characters==
Whenever one of the Exiles dies, is sent home, or something happens to them, they are replaced by someone else, and thus the roster changes. The first occurrence is when Magnus dies in Exiles #2, and Sunfire comes on board to replace him. The current Exiles roster is:

*[[Blink (comics)|Blink]]
*[[Morph (comics)|Morph]]
*[[Sabretooth (comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles|Sabretooth]]
*[[Longshot]]
*[[Spider-Man 2099]]
*[[Psylocke#Joining the Exiles|Psylocke]]

After the Timebreakers fired the original Exiles Team, they gathered multiple squads consisting solely of alternate versions of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. The last Wolverine squad was formed in ''Exiles'' #85 and consisted the following members:

{| class="wikitable" width=90%

|-
||[[Wolverine (comics)|Patch]] (Earth-181)
||James "Logan" Howlett
||Exiles #85
||Apparently from the same Earth as Weapon X's Daredevil.  Killed by Sabretooth.

|-
||[[Wolverine (comics)|Zombie Wolvie]] (Earth-2149)
||James "Logan" Howlett
||''Exiles'' #85
||Not the same Zombie Wolverine who first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' 22-23 and ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' #1-5. The original Marvel Zombies version became a member of The Galactus as of Marvel Zombies #5.  Killed when Elsie Dee's internal bomb went off.

|-
||[[Albert (comics)|Albert Dee]] (Earth-50211)
||
||Exiles #85
||An android built to destroy Wolverine, Elsie Dee's acolyte.  Killed in the blast when Logan attacked Brother Mutant.

|-
||[[Elsie-Dee#Exiles|Elsie Dee]] (Earth-50211)
||
||Exiles #85
||An android built to destroy Wolverine, Albert Dee's acolyte.  Detonated her internal bomb to weaken Brother Mutant.

|-
||[[Wolverine (comics)|Weapon X]] (Earth-520)
||James "Logan" Howlett
||Exiles #85
||Logan, right after his adamantium was implanted on him by the [[Weapon X]] Program.  Assumed dead in the Exiles attack on Brother Mutant.
|-
||[[Wolverine (comics)|James Howlett]] (Earth-1880)
||James Howlett
||Exiles #85
||He has just discovered his powers and thusly has assumed neither Logan's nor Wolverine's identity.  The only Wolverine Exile to return home alive from the team introduced in Exiles #85.
|-
||[[Wolverine (comics)|Major Logan]] (Earth-811/DotFP)
||James "Logan" Howlett
||Uncanny X-Men #141/Exiles #85 (as an Exile)
||He apparently survived his demise at the hand of the Sentinels thanks to his healing Factor. He, Marvel Girl III, Hyperstorm and Kate Pryde are the only known survivors from the X-Men in this timeline.  Killed by an energy blast as he nearly killed Brother Mutant.  His death echoes the one featured in the [[Days of Future Past]] timeline (although a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]], not another mutant, killed him in that timeline). It is not clear if this storyline takes place before or after events in the [[Earth X]] universe. Thus this character may come from a (further) divergent reality.

|-
|-
||Others
||James "Logan" Howlett/ Jaimie Howlett ?
||Exiles #85-86
||43 other Wolverine versions were to be seen on issue #86 cover, a [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], a [[clown]], and a [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] version were featured in the comics and at least 3 were on the Panoptichrons screen at the end of #86. 27 of them died, according to Heather Hudson (including 6 of the 7 main). Other versions included female Wolverines, Brother Xavier and a Deadpool-like version.
 
|-
</TABLE>

The mission of these Wolverine Teams was to eliminate the Brother Mutant, but he(?) captured and hypnotized them. Finally, the last Wolverine Team manages to kill the Brother Mutant, with the help of the First Exiles Team. In the end, seventeen Wolverines perished during the fight. James Howlett was the only member sent home.

===Other characters===
In ''Exiles'' there has been a number of special heroes, villains and others. Some of them are even significant in more than one reality and/or story.
