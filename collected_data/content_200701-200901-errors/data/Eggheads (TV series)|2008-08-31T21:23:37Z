'''''Eggheads''''' is a [[BBC]] [[quiz show]] presented by [[Dermot Murnaghan]] and [[Jeremy Vine]]<ref name="Vine">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/aug/07/bbc.television?gusrc=rss&feed=media Jeremy Vine set to return to BBC2]</ref> on a rotation basis. The Eggheads are a team, made up of five British quiz champions who compete against a new panel of challengers each episode.

==Quiz champions==
The quiz champions who compete on the show are:
*[[Kevin Ashman]]: winner of ''[[British Quiz Championship]]'', ''European Quiz Championship'', ''[[World Quizzing Championships]]'', ''[[Fifteen to One]]'', ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'', ''[[Brain of Britain]]'' and ''[[Mind Sports Olympiad]]''. 
*[[C. J. de Mooi]]: winner of ''[[BrainTeaser]]'', ''[[100% (game show)|100%]]'' and ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' as well as having been [[Mensa International|Mensa]] chess champion.
*[[Daphne Fowler]]: winner of ''[[Fifteen to One]]'', ''[[Brain of Britain]]'' and ''[[Going for Gold]]''.

===Sixth egghead===
In May 2008, auditions began to be held for a sixth person to join the Eggheads team. Although no offical comment has been made, the auditions are now over. It is unknown when the new egghead will be revealed. But they will be televised with [[Dermot Murnaghan]] hosting. <ref name="Vine"/><ref>[http://www.beonscreen.com/uk/tv-shows/game-quiz/are-you-as-clever-as-an-egghead-2255.asp Are you as clever as an Egghead]</ref><ref>[http://www.iqagb.co.uk/trivia/viewtopic.php?t=6998 Eggie Hunt - Updated]</ref>
It was also announced [[Jeremy Vine]] would now share the presenting duties with original host [[Dermot Murnaghan]], due to the latter having commitments to his other job on [[Sky News]].<ref name="Vine"/>

==Title sequence==
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by the host, stating 'These five people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is: can they be beaten?' The five Eggheads are displayed in revolving egg-shaped frames, with a blue background.

==Format==
There are four main rounds, in which the challengers are given a category, and choose one of their players to play against an Egghead of their choice, and they choose whether or not to go first — all aspects designed to give the challengers an advantage. They are asked three [[multiple choice]] questions each; if these result in a tie, non-multiple choice questions are asked in pairs, in a [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] fashion. Possible categories for these rounds are Arts & Books, Entertainment, Food & Drink, History, Geography, Politics, Science and Sport. The contestants do not know the categories or their order in advance, but are guaranteed that at least one of Entertainment or Sport will come up.

After the main rounds the final takes place, in which the losing players from the main round are not allowed to compete and a dominant team could thus have a 5–1 advantage. All remaining players are allowed to confer and the category is always General Knowledge.

Should the challengers win, they receive £1,000 plus a further £1,000 for each day the Eggheads had previously gone undefeated. Defeat usually leads Murnaghan to ask "Congratulations Eggheads, can anyone beat you?", although, after being beaten on quite a few occasions, the phrase became "Congratulations Eggheads, who will beat you?" The Eggheads have a tendency to show off somewhat, often giving extra information or using obscure cross-references to some of their answers.

==History==
The show has been running for six series, represented by the same five Eggheads.
The teams that have defeated the Eggheads include:
* The ''Unicorn Inn'' from [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]], who won the thirteenth edition in [[November]] [[2003]] in a sudden death tie break. 

* ''Spaghetti'', a group of [[Mensa International |mensans]] from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], who won £19,000. 

* ''Second Class'', a group of postmen won £37,000 on the [[27 September]] [[2006]], which remained the highest win ever for just over a year.

* ''Beer Today, Gone Tomorrow'', a group of students from [[Oxford Brookes University]] won £75,000 on the [[28 September]] [[2007]], the highest prize won on the show so far <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookes.ac.uk/about/news/eggheads|title=Brookes students triumph on BBC quiz show|date=2007-10-04|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>. Despite only two of them being in the final round versus four Eggheads (minus Chris), they won by correctly answering the question "Which [[European Union|EU]] capital city is farthest south - [[Lisbon]], [[Valletta]] or [[Nicosia]]?" the answer being Nicosia in [[Cyprus]]. The Eggheads answered the following question incorrectly, believing that eight states in the [[United States]] officially sanction the [[death penalty]] (the correct answer being 38). At the end of the programme, the winners stated that they plan to treat themselves by travelling to Nicosia.

* ''Preston Quizmasters'', won £3,000 on [[3 October]] [[2007]].

* A team from the [[Museum of London]] and the [[Museum in Docklands]] won £33,000 on [[20 November]] [[2007]]. The challengers had just two members in the final round versus four Eggheads (minus Judith), but managed to win after the Eggheads answered one question incorrectly in the final round, believing that actor [[Jeff Goldblum]] had appeared drunk on US chat show [[The View]] in November 2006 when in fact it was [[Danny DeVito]].

* A team from a Manchester City website - Blue Vibe - beat the Eggheads on [[7 December]] [[2007]], winning £12,000

* ''Beer and Skittles'', a [[Leicestershire]] pub team from The Unicorn [[Lutterworth]] won £5,000 on [[12 February]] [[2008]]. Two remaining team members beat the four Eggheads (minus Chris) in a sudden death tie-break. The Challengers correctly answered that a [[liger]] is the [[offspring]] of a [[male]] [[lion]] and a [[tiger|tigress]], but the Eggheads incorrectly said that the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[god]] of [[dancing|dance]] was [[Krishna]]. The answer was [[Shiva]].

* ''Weakly Players'', a [[Cardiff]]-based amateur dramatics team won £27,000 on [[20 March]] [[2008]]. The Eggheads (minus Daphne) got their final multiple-choice General Knowledge question wrong. The Eggheads believed that [[Radio Happy Isles]] and [[Radio Happy Lagoon]] were broadcast in [[Samoa]], not the correct answer, which was the [[Solomon Islands]].

* ''Sean and the Sheep'', a team composed of four Welsh people and an Englishman called Sean won £20,000 on [[17 April]] [[2008]]. The Eggheads (minus Judith and CJ) got their second multiple-choice General Knowledge question wrong, believing that the word [[Trabant]] - a German automobile - literally meant "worker". The correct answer is satellite. Sean and The Sheep won 3-1.

* ''Tapheads'', a team of work colleges at [[Welsh Water]], who won £13,000 on [[6 May]] [[2008]]. In the final round the Eggheads team contained only Daphne and Chris; in 'sudden death', they incorrectly believed the heads side of a coin was called the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]. The correct answer is the obverse.

* On [[13 May]] [[2008]], ''The Ratpack'' became the first team to win with only one remaining team member in the final round. Alex, the final team member, answered all of his questions correctly, having decided to go first. Having answered their first two questions correctly the final question for the Eggheads was: "Colin Myler was appointed Editor of which [[newspaper]] in [[2007]]?" The three possible answers were [[News Of The World]], [[The Sun]] and [[Daily Mail]]. The Eggheads incorrectly chose [[The Sun]]. The correct answer was [[News Of The World]]. The "Ratpack" won £5,000. 

* On [[June 5]], [[2008]], ''Lads Wot Lunch'' from [[Surrey]] beat the Eggheads (minus Judith & Chris) to win £12,000. The Eggheads' final multiple-choice question was "Which coin was officially decommissioned in [[1993]]? The answers were [[Half crown]], [[British half penny coin|half penny]] or [[British two shilling coin|florin]]. Kevin & Daphne overruled CJ and said it was the halfpenny, it was the florin.  

* On [[June 12]], [[2008]], ''[[South Wales Warriors]]'', an American Football team from [[Cardiff]], beat the Eggheads (minus Chris, Judith & Kevin) to win £5,000.  The Eggheads' second multiple-choice question was "The singer [[Edith Piaf]] was famous for her romantic association with which sportsman? The answers were [[Marcel Cerdan]], [[René Lacoste]] or [[Just Fontaine]].  CJ and Daphne incorrectly chose Lacoste, however the correct answer was Cerdan.

* On [[August 25]], [[2008]], ''Loser's Corner'', from [[Belfast]], beat the Eggheads (minus CJ) to win £6,000.  The Eggheads' third multiple-choice question was "Which [[Wales|Welsh]] band released the album ''Hey Venus!'' in 2007? The answers were [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[Super Furry Animals]] or [[Stereophonics]].  The Eggheads incorrectly chose [[Manic Street Preachers]]. The correct answer was [[Super Furry Animals]], which CJ appeared to know. "Loser's Corner", then correctly guessed that in [[1989]], [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy#Marriage|Marina Ogilvy]] was the first member of the [[British Royal Family]] to win the [[Rear of the Year]] award.

Occasionally, the show has had some well-known people on the challengers' team. Multi-World Darts Champion [[Phil Taylor]] has appeared, as well as the [[England Women's Cricket Team]] and [[reality TV]] celebrities [[Jade Goody]] and [[Eugene Sully]].
