The '''Lhasa Apso''' is a small [[dog breed|breed]] of watchdog originally from [[Tibet]] used to guard monasteries.  

==Appearance==
According to the [[American Kennel Club]], Lhasa Apsos should measure about 10 to 11 inches at the [[withers]]. Males should weigh between 14 and 18 pounds, and females should weigh between 12 and 14 pounds. The forelegs should be straight, and the hindquarters should be well-developed and muscular. The breed standard requires dark brown eyes of medium size and a coal-black nose. Lhasa Apsos are similiar in appearance to the [[Shih tzu]] dog but their personalities and temperament are very different. Shih Tzus were bred as companian dogs while the Lhasa was bred as a watchdog, a position that the Lhasa takes very seriously.

The texture of the coat should be heavy, straight, hard, neither woolly nor silky, and very dense. A Lhasa's coat should be of good length.  All colors are equally acceptable, with or without dark tips to ears and beard. The tail should be carried in a tight screw over the back. The [[breed standard]] currently used by the American Kennel Club was approved July 11, 1978.<ref>[http://www.akc.org/breeds/lhasa_apso/index.cfm  American Kennel Club - Lhasa Apso]</ref>

Lhasa Apsos typically live between 12-15 years, though some have been reported to live as long as 18 years.

==Temperament==
Lhasa Apsos are naturally happy, playful, and mischievous dogs. However, Lhasas are very intelligent and are known for being very independent. Because of these traits, they are often hard to train and can be rather manipulative of their owners. When properly socialized and trained, Lhasa Apsos make good family dogs because they are very protective of it's human family and property. Lhasas require 20-30 minutes of daily exercise, making them good apartment dogs.

Originally bred and used as indoor watchdogs in Tibet due to their keen hearing and dark bark. Lhasas were bred to patrol the interior of the house or monastary and only alert if someone entered or approached the property. The Lhasa was expected to then follow the intruder barking until his master arrived to check on the intruder. Unlike Shih Tzus, the Lhasas are very weary of strangers and house guests.
