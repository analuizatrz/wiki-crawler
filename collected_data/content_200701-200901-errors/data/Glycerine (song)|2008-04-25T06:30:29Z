'''"Glycerine"''' is the 4th single from [[post-grunge]] band [[Bush (band)|Bush]]'s debut album ''[[Sixteen Stone]]''. Bush had increasing popularity in the United States with the band's singles doing well on America. With the third single "[[Comedown (song)|Comedown]]," Bush reached number 1 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart for two weeks. "Glyercine" did the same. The song arguably is Bush's most recognizable. Thanks to the success of ''Sixteen Stone'', the follow up album ''[[Razorblade Suitcase]]'' debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, and sold 3,000,000 copies.  
The video for Glycerine was notable for being shot in a very short time period when the band was on tour in the United States.  The video was shot so quickly because the band's visas had expired.  In spite of being very simple and unadorned, the video was highly acclaimed and won several awards, including the [[MTV Video Music Award - Viewer's Choice]] from the 1996 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

The song is also well known for being performed live, solo, by [[Gavin Rossdale]], during a heavy storm at the 1996 MTV Spring Break. Footage of the performance was put into video rotation by MTV.

== Lyrics ==
"It must be your skin that I'm sinkin in
Must be for real cause now I can feel
and I didn't mind
it's not my kind
not my time to wonder why
everything's gone white
and everything's grey
now your here now you away
I don't want this
remember that
I'll never forget where your at
don't let the days go by
glycerine

I'm never alone
I'm alone all the time
are you at one
or do you lie
we live in a wheel
where everyone steals
but when we rise it's like strawberry fields

If I treated you bad
you bruise my face
couldn't love you more
you got a beautiful taste
don't let the days go by
could have been easier on you
I coudn't change though I wanted to
could have been easier by three
our old friend fear and you and me
glycerine (repeat)
don't let the days go by
glycerine

I needed you more
when we wanted us less
I could not kiss just regress
it might just be
clear simple and plain
that's just fine
that's just one of my names
don't let the days go by
could've been easier on you
glycerine"
