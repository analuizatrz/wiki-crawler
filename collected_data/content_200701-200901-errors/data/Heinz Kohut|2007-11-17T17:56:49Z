'''Heinz Kohut''' [[May 3]] [[1913]] &ndash; [[October 8]] [[1981]] is best known for his development of ''[[Self psychology|Self Psychology]]'', a school of thought within [[psychodynamic]]/[[psychoanalytic]] theory,  [[psychiatrist]] '''Heinz Kohut's''' contributions transformed the modern practice of analytic and dynamic treatment approaches.

==Early life==
Kohut was born on [[May 3]], [[1913]] to an [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] Jewish family and received his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] in neurology at the University of Vienna.  Like many [[Jews]], including [[Freud]], Kohut fled [[Nazi]] occupation of his native [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] in [[1939]]. Kohut settled in [[Chicago]] and became a prominent member of the Chicago Institute of Psychoanalysis. Kohut was 
such a strong proponent of the traditional psychoanalytic perspective that was dominant in the U.S. that he jokingly called himself "Mr. Psychoanalysis."[http://www.2think.org/heinz_kohut.shtml]

==Development of Self Psychology==
In the aftermath of [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]], Freudian analysis was too focused on individual guilt and failed to reflect the new [[zeitgeist]] (the emotional interests and needs of people struggling with issues of identity, meaning, ideals, and self-expression). [http://www.2think.org/heinz_kohut.shtml]  Though he initially tried to remain true to the traditional analytic viewpoint with which he had become associated and viewed the self as separate but coexistent to the [[ego]], Kohut later rejected Freud's structural theory of the [[id]], ego, and [[superego]].  He then developed his ideas around what he called the tripartite (three-part) self.<ref name=insideout>Flanagan, L.M. (1996). The theory of self psychology.  In (Eds.) Berzoff, J., Flanagan, L.M., & Hertz, P. ''Inside out and outside in'', New Jersey:Jason Aronson Inc.)</ref>

According to Kohut, this three-part self can only develop when the needs of one's "self states," including one's sense of worth and well-being, are met in relationships with others. In contrast to traditional psychoanalysis that focused on drives (instinctual motivations of sex and aggression), internal conflicts, and fantasies, self psychology thus placed a great deal of emphasis on the vicissitudes of relationships.

Kohut demonstrated his interest in how we develop our "sense of self" using [[Narcissism (psychology)|narcissism]] as a model. If a person is [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], it will allow him or her to suppress feelings of low self-esteem. By talking highly of himself or herself, the person can eliminate his or her sense of worthlessness.

==Historical Context==
Kohut expanded on his theory during the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]], a time in which aggressive individuality, overindulgence, greed, and restlessness left many people feeling empty, fragile, and fragmented.<ref name=insideout/>

Perhaps because of its positive, open, and empathic stance on human nature as a whole as well as the individual, self psychology is considered one of the "four psychologies" (the others being [[Drive Theory]], [[ego psychology]], and [[object relations]]); that is, one of the primary theories on which modern dynamic therapists and theorists rely.  According to [[biographer]] Charles Strozier, "Kohut...may well have saved psychoanalysis from itself."[http://www.2think.org/heinz_kohut.shtml]  Without his focus on empathic relationships, dynamic theory might well have faded in comparison to one of the other major psychology orientations (which include [[humanism]] and [[Behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy]]) that were being developed around the same time.

Also according to Strozier, Kohut's book ''The Analysis of the Self: A Systematic Analysis of the Treatment of the Narcissistic Personality Disorders'' [http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=ijp.054.0363a] "had a significant impact on the field by extending Freud's theory of [[narcissism]] and introducing what Kohut called the 'self-object transferences' of mirroring and idealization." In other words, children need to idealize and emotionally "sink into"  and identify with the idealized competence of admired figures.  They also need to have their self-worth reflected back ("mirrored") by empathic and caregiving others. These experiences allow them to thereby learn the self-soothing and other skills that are necessary for the development of a healthy (cohesive, vigorous) sense of self. For example, therapists become the idealized parent and through transference the patient begins to get the things he has missed. The patient also has the opportunity to reflect on how early the troubling relationship led to personality problems. Narcissism arises from poor attachment at an early age.  Freud also believed that narcissism hides low self esteem, and that therapy will reparent them through transference and they begin to get the things they missed. Later, Kohut added the third major self-object theme (and he dropped the hyphen in self-object) of alter-ego/twinship, the theme of being part of a larger human identification with others.

Though dynamic theory tends to place emphasis on childhood development, Kohut believed that the need for such self-object relationships does not end at childhood but continues throughout all stages of a person's life.<ref>Elson, Miriam. (1986). Self Psychology in Clinical Social Work</ref> 

In the final week of his life, knowing that his time was at an end, Kohut spent as much time as he could with his family and friends. He fell into a [[coma]] on the evening of [[October 7]], [[1981]], and died of cancer on the morning of [[October 8]].
