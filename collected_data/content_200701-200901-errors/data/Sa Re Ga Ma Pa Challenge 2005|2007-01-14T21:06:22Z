[[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa]] Challenge 2005 was a reality series, an extension of the famous Sa Re Ga Ma programmed aired on TV ten years back on Zee TV. With the Challenge series, Zee brought 48 great singers across India. The process started with elimination rounds by the four mentors: Aadesh Shrivastav (Baghban fame), Himesh Reshimiyaa (Tere Naam fame), Jatin-Lalit (Pehla Nasha fame) and Ismail Durbar (HDDCS fame). The mentors picked one girl and one boy amidst 4 boys and 4 girls who took part durign the course of a month.Hence the 48 were eliminated to 32 - 16 boys and girls.

After that they were put into Gharanas (Groups). Aadesh Shrivastav's group was the Jai Ho Gharana, Himesh Reshimiyaas the Lets Rock Gharana, Jatin Lalit the Hum Mein Hain Dum Gharana and Ismail Durbar's the Yalgaar Ho Gharana.

Each Gharana had to pick 8 contestants in total from the contestants selected through the auditions, and wildcard entries.

After weeks of selection, it came down to 8 contestants per Gharana, the final 32.

From these final 32 through series of elimination amidst top judges like Shiv - Hari, Pt. Jasraj, Alka Yagik, Jagjit Singh etc, 10 top singers were selected , 5 male and 5 female.

There was only one contestant that was proven to be too good for this competition in the audition rounds and that was Nihira. Her Challka Challka Re was too good and won her the title of 'best singer of C2005'. 

The only three contestants to have gone through the perfect green card on first day pattern were Vinit Hemachandra and Nihira. Nihira was the only girl out of all to have been perfect when being chosen by judges.
