'''Panavision''' is a [[motion picture]] equipment [[company (law)|company]] specializing in [[camera]]s and lenses. Originally formed by [[Robert Gottschalk]] as a small partnership to create [[anamorphic]] projection lenses during the [[widescreen]] boom in the 1950s, Panavision has steadily expanded its product lines to meet the demands of modern filmmakers. The company introduced its first products in the mid to late 1950s and revolutionized widescreen movies, eventually helping the [[CinemaScope]] process win the format wars to become one of the primary widescreen processes in common use today. Panavision helped revolutionize the process of filmmaking with the Panaflex [[35 mm film|35 mm]] camera in 1972 and has continued to refine this achievement through the introduction of more modern cameras including the Millennium (1997) and the new Digital Cinema camera; the Genesis (2004).

Unlike most of its competitors, Panavision operates exclusively as a rental facility and owns its entire inventory. This allows Panavision to invest the most research and development funding and integrate the highest quality manufacturing into every product without worrying about the end retail value. Maintaining their entire inventory also allows Panavision to constantly update their existing equipment and apply those updates to every model in the inventory, as opposed to just the newest models getting the upgrades. The company is based in [[Woodland Hills, California]], [[United States]].

==Early history==
Panavision was founded in late 1953 by [[Robert Gottschalk]] who partnered with Harry Eller, Richard Moore, [[Meredith Merle Nicholson|Meredith Nicholson]], Walter Wallin and [[William Mann]].<ref name="users">Samuelson, David W. ''Panaflex Users' Manual'' Focal Press. 1990. ISBN 0-2408-0267-5</ref>  The company was formally incorporated in 1954, which is the more commonly cited foundation date. Panavision was principally established for the manufacture of anamorphic projection lenses to meet the growing demands of theaters showing [[CinemaScope]] films.<ref name="ROUD">Roudebush, James.

Retrieved on [[2007-01-19]]</ref> At the time of Panavision's formation, Gottschalk owned a camera shop in Westwood Village, California, where some of his most common customers were cinematographers.<ref name="golden">Samuelson, David W. "Golden Years" ''[[American Cinematographer]] Magazine'', September, 2003 pp. 70-77.</ref> A few years earlier while he and Richard Moore, who worked with him in the camera shop, were experimenting with [[underwater photography]], Gottschalk had become interested in the technology of [[anamorphic]] lenses and experimented with anamorphic photography to get a wider field of view from his underwater camera housing.<ref name="acpstory">Henderson, Scott. "The Panavision Story" ''American Cinematographer Magazine'' April, 1977.</ref> The technology was originally designed during [[World War I]] to increase the field of view on tank periscopes<ref name="golden"/> by horizontally "squeezing" thus allowing a wider field of view once unsqueezed by complementary anamorphic optical element. This allowed the tank operator to see double the horizontal field of view without significant optical distortion. Gottschalk and Moore bought some of these lenses from C.P. Goerz, a [[New York]] [[optics]] company, to utilize in their underwater photography. After the widescreen boom in the 1950s, Gottschalk recognized an opportunity to provide this lens technology to the film industry, first for projectors and then - in an improved manner from CinemaScope - for cameras. Nicholson, a friend of Moore's, started working as a [[cameraman]] on several early tests of anamorphic photography.<ref name="BIJL">Bijl, Adriaan.

In the 1950s, the motion picture industry was highly threatened by the advent of [[television]], which was keeping moviegoers at home and significantly effecting box office sales. Film studios began looking for ways to draw audiences back into the theaters with innovations that television could not provide. These innovations included a resurgance of color films, three-dimensional films, stereophonic sound and, most notably, [[widescreen|wide screen]] movies. [[Cinerama]] was among the first [[widescreen]] processes offered to the public.<ref>Hart, Martin.

Retrieved on [[2007-01-19]]</ref> In its initial conception, the cumbersome system it required three cameras and three synced [[projectors]] working side-by-side on one long screen. Among the obvious logistical and financial challenges of tripling equipment usage and cost, the final image had the somewhat annoying aspect of vertical lines between the three images on the projection screen.<ref>Pryor, Thomas M.

Retrieved on [[2007-01-19]]</ref> Looking to create a high-impact method of widescreen filmmaking that was both more cost-efficient and less complicated or visually distracting, [[20th Century Fox]] had been working to design an anamorphic production system, called [[CinemaScope]]. This involved shooting the film with anamorphic lenses.<ref name="GRAY">Gray, Peter. [http://jkor.com/peter/scopehist.html "CinemaScope, A Concise History".] Retrieved on [[2007-01-19]]</ref> The images were then projected back with complementary anamorphic lenses on the projector that expanded the image, creating an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] twice as wide as the frame itself. By the time the first CinemaScope film, ''[[The Robe]]'', was announced for production, Gottschalk, Moore, and Nicholson already had a full demo reel of work with their own an anamorphic underwater system.<ref name="BIJL"/> 

[[Image:Panalogosm.png|thumb|left|The Panavision logo incorporates three [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s into its design â€“ 1.33 (TV, Standard "Academy") on the inside, 1.85 (standard US widescreen) in the middle, and 2.35/2.40 (anamorphic) on the outside.]]
Gottschalk learned, through a vendor to his camera store, that [[Bausch & Lomb]] were having difficulty filling the orders for theatrical anamorphic projection lenses.<ref name="BIJL"/> Gottschalk teamed up with William Mann, who provided the optical manufacturing. Mann, in turn, introduced Walter Wallin, who had formally studied [[optics]]. Thanks primarily to Wallin input, the anamorphic lens design they settled on was prismatic rather than the Bauch & Lomb CinemaScope cylindrical method.<ref name="BIJL"/> This meant that the anamorphic lens extension factor (how much the image is horizontally unsqueezed) could be manually shifted, which was useful for projectionists switching between non-anamorphic ("flat" or "spherical") trailers and an anamorphic feature.<ref name="BIJL"/> 

Panavision's first product, the Super Panatar projection lens, debuted in March 1954 for $1,100 and quickly captured the market.<ref name="PANHIST">[http://www.panavision.com/history.php "History"] Official company history and timeline Panavision.com. Retrieved on [[2007-01-19]]</ref>  The Super Panatar was a rectangular box that simply attached to the existing projection lens with a special bracket.<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/superpanatar-d.htm ''Super Panatar Instruction Manual''.] Panavision, 1954. HTML transcription by Widescreenmuseum.com. Retrieved on [[2007-01-19]]</ref> Panavision then improved on the Super Panatar with their second product, the Ultra Panatar, which was an improved lighter cylindrical design that could be screwed directly to the front of the projection lens.<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/Widescreen/ultrapanatar2.htm ''Ultra Panatar Instruction Manual''.] Panavision. 1955. HTML transcription by Widescreenmuseum.com. Retrieved on [[2007-01-19]]</ref> Panavision lenses gradually replaced CinemaScope as the leading anamorphic system for theatrical projection.<ref name="history"/>

In December of 1954, the company created a specialized lens for film laboratories called the Micro Panatar which, when fitted to an [[optical printer]], could be used to create "flat" (non-anamorphic) prints from anamorphic negatives. This allowed any given film to be released in the widest number of theaters as it could be shown even if the theater owner did not have an anamorphic system installed. To accomplish this dual platform release strategy before the Micro Panatar, studios would sometimes shoot films with two different side-by-side cameras, one anamorphic and one spherical, so that non-widescreen theaters could still exhibit the film. The cost savings of eliminating the second camera and making flat prints in [[post-production]] with the Micro Panatar were enormous.<ref name="ROUD"/>

The CinemaScope camera lens system had its faults. Many early CinemaScope films were described as "fuzzy" due to imperfect optics.<ref name="history">Cook, David A. ''A History of Narrative Film'' Norton & Company. 1990. ISBN 0-393-95553-2</ref> IN the same year, Gottschalk set out to create an improved anamorphic camera lens by utilizing a variable prismatic system that was nearly distortion free. 

Panavision was commissioned by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] to create the [[MGM Camera 65|Camera 65]] system.<ref name="HART">Hart,Martin. [http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/Widescreen/c65story.htm "Solving The Mysteries of MGM Camera 65 and Ultra Panavision 70".] Widescreenmuseum.com. September, 2002. Retrieved on [[2007-01-19]]</ref> The resulting system used a [[65 mm film]] camera in conjunction with the APO Panatar lens, which was an integrated anamorphic lens (as opposed to a standard [[prime lens]] with an anamorphoser mounted on it). This created a 1.25x anamorphic squeeze factor.<ref>Hart, Martin. [http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/special/camera65.htm ''MGM Camera 65 Circa 1959 Anamorphic 70mm Print''.] Widescreenmuseum.com. Retrieved on [[2007-01-19]]</ref> This process, which created an astounding aspect ratio of 2.75:1, was first called MGM 65 and then Panavision 65, before finally settling on the official title of [[Ultra Panavision]]. The system was only used on a small handful of films, the first of which was ''[[Raintree County]]'' (1956).<ref name="HART"/> Ironically the film was only released as a 35 mm anamorphic print due to the fact that all [[70 mm]] theaters were solidly booked up with ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|Around the World in Eighty Days]]''. The first film to actually be shown in 70 mm anamorphic, ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', was released in 1959.<ref name="HART"/> Subsequent Ultra Panavision films were ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' (1962), ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (movie)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1964), ''[[Battle of the Bulge]]'' (1965), ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965), ''[[The Hallelujah Trail]]'' (1965), and ''[[Khartoum (film)|Khartoum]]'' (1966).<ref>Hart, Martin. [http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcr6.htm "Cinerama Single Film Presentations"] Widescreenmuseum.com. Retrieved on [[2007-01-20]]</ref> Virtually all of the 70 mm prints of these films that are still in circulation today are straight spherical (2.20:1 ratio), due to the rarity of remaining 1.25x anamorphosers for 70 mm projectors.
[[Image:UltraPanatar.jpg|thumb|right|200 px| Panavision's Ultra Panatar lens.]]
Another factor that played into the replacement of the CinemaScope process was Panavision's last major early innovation, the Auto Panatar camera lens for 35 mm anamorphic productions.<ref name="ROUD"/> Early CinemaScope camera lenses were notoriously problematic in close ups with an optical aberration that was commonly known as "the mumps": a widening of the face in close-ups due to a loss of anamorphic power as a subject approaches the lens.<ref name="ROUD"/> Although, because of the novelty of the new anamorphic process, early CinemaScope productions were willing to compensate for this aberration by simply avoiding close ups, as the anamorphic process became more popular, it became more of a problem. Panavision solved the problem by adding a rotating lens element that moved in mechanical sync with the [[Focus (optics)|focus]] ring. This completely eliminated the distortion and allowed for natural close up anamorphic photography. The Auto Panatar was released in 1958 and was rapidly adopted industry-wide, eventually making CinemaScope lenses obsolete. This innovation earned Panavision the first of its 15 Academy Awards for technical achievement.<ref name="ROUD"/> While Fox insisted on maintaining CinemaScope for a time, the actors were not happy. [[Frank Sinatra]] is reputed to have demanded the use of the Panavision Auto Panatar lenses for Fox's ''[[Von Ryan's Express]]''. These demands, in addition to the notion that the Panavision's systems were manufactured by an independent company and not the product of a rival studio, eventually led Fox to completely abandon CinemaScope for Auto Panatars in 1965. Sinatra's ''Von Ryan's Express'' marked Fox's first picture with Panavision lenses.<ref>[http://www.panavision.com/in_frame_detail.php?spotid=13&langid=1&typeid=1 "Honoring Our Own".] Panavision.com. Retrieved on [[2007-01-19]]</ref> To meet with the extraordinary demands for Panavision projection lenses, Gottschalk resorted to retrofitting some of the Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lenses into Panavision housings with the new astigmatic attachment, which improved them greatly. This was 'discovered' by the competition many years after Gottschalk's death when a lead designer from Bausch & Lomb, who had originally been involved with the CinemaScope project, came to work as a designer for Panavision and - after opening some of the older lenses - discovered the superior secret.<ref name="golden"/>

==Middle period and changes==
By 1962, four of the founding partners had left the company to pursue private careers.<ref name="BIJL"/> In that same year, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s Ultra Panavision production of ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' was going so far over budget that the studio was forced to liquidate some assets to balance the load. It was during this liquidation that Panavision managed to acquire MGM's camera equipment division.<ref name="BIJL"/> 

The company spent the next five years retrofitting the standard BNC 35mm cameras to develop a lighter, quieter camera with a [[Reflex finder|reflex viewfinder]]; the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) was released in 1967. The camera weighed a "lighter" 100 pounds and featured a 200 degree shutter. The PSR's gained popularity very quickly to become one of the most wanted studio cameras in the world.<ref name="acpstory"/> Panavision expanded their manufacturing to include spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography and gained an even larger share of the market. 

In 1968 Panavision released a handheld 65 mm camera.<ref name="BIJL"/> However, the process of blowing up 35 mm anamorphic films to 70 mm had virtually destroyed all 65 mm productions. Shooting 35 mm anamorphic for a 70 mm theatrical release had such significant cost savings, there was little need to shoot 65 mm.<ref>Loring, Charles. "Breakthrough in 35mm-to-70mm Print-Up Process" ''American Cinematographer Magazine'' April, 1964.</ref> ''[[The Cardinal]]'' (1964) was the first film which used this process. The optical blow-up technique succeeded in virtually rendering all 65 mm production obsolete. Since 1970, only a handful of films have been shot in 65 mm.<ref name="SUPER">Hart, Martin. [http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/splist.htm "Super Panavision Filmography"] Widescreenmuseum.com. Retrieved on [[2007-01-19]]</ref>

In the mid 1960s, Gottschalk elected to alter Panavision's business model and maintain their full inventory, allowing usage of Panavision cameras and lenses by rental only, rather than sales.<ref name="BIJL2">Bijl, Adriaan. [http://www.in70mm.com/newsletter/2002/67/panavision/diffusion.htm "The Importance of Panavision: Diffusion Phase"]. Retrieved on [[2007-01-20]]</ref> The advantages of this method were that more money could be spent on equipment development (hence to a higher standard)and all equipment could be maintained and modified directly by the company. Over the first few years of the PSR many refinements were made. With the choice to rent the equipment only, it guaranteed that every refinement made was fully integrated into every camera in their inventory. As they weren't worried about selling the cameras or maintaining a competitive cost, there was no limit on the logistical cost of manufacturing. This allowed Panavision to manufacture their cameras to the highest standards making them more durable.<ref>[http://www.secinfo.com/dsvrn.12e8.d.htm Securities and Exchange Commission information for Panavision] Secinfo.com.

This new business model required additional upfront capital and, to this end, the company was sold to Banner Productions in 1965 with although Gottschalk remaining as president.<ref name="BIJL2"/> Panavision benefited from the purchase by becoming the global company it is today, branching out into markets beyond [[Hollywood]] including New York, Europe, Australia, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.<ref name="acpstory"/> [[Kinney National Service]] bought out Banner in 1968 and then took over [[Warner Brothers]] the following year, eventually renaming itself [[Warner Communications]].<ref name="BIJL2"/> Consequently, the deeper pockets of new owners allowed a massive expansion in inventory and a leap forward in research and development.

Albert Mayer headed up the next major project: the creation of a lightweight, quiet reflex camera adaptable to either handheld or studio conditions. Following four years of development, the [[Panaflex]] debuted in 1972. A revolutionary camera that operated virtually silently, thus no longer needing a heavy and cumbersome [[blimp|sound blimp]], and could be used for sync hand-held work. The Panaflex set itself apart by also including a digital electronic [[tachometer]] and [[camera magazine|magazine]] motors for the take-up reel.<ref name="probstmill">Probst, Christopher.

ISBN 0-8065-1540-6</ref>

As the 1970s moved on, the Panaflex line was continually updated and expanded in further incarnations: the Panaflex X, Panaflex Lightweight (for [[steadicam]]), Panastar (high speed camera), Panaflex Gold, and Panaflex G2. Work with [[video camera]]s was first explored with the Panacam, although the company chose to leave the field for others to develop in the meantime. A competitor to the [[Steadicam]], known as the Panaglide, was also developed and released.<ref name="BIJL2"/>

==Post-Gottschalk==
Robert Gottschalk died in 1982, aged 64. After Gottschalk's death, Kinney National sold the company to a consortium headed by Chicago newspaper and department store heir [[Frederick Field]],<ref name="afi">Slide, Anthony. "Panavision" ''The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary'' Limelight Editions. 1990. pp. 253-4. ISBN 0-8791-0139-3</ref> [[Ted Field]] and John Farrand, who brought sweeping changes to the then-stagnant company. Optics testing was computerized, the new Platinum model camera was built (1986), and a new line of lenses known as Primos were created (1990), which exhibited matching color characteristics across the lens line.<ref name="BIJL2"/> The company was sold to Lee Lighting in 1987 but financing was overextended, and the ownership reverted to [[Warburg Pincus]] in 1989.<ref name="BIJL2"/>

In 1987, responding to sensed demand for the resurrection of a 65 mm camera, development began on a new model, which was released in 1991 and known as System 65.<ref name="PANHIST"/> However, Arri beat them to market two years prior with the Arriflex 765. Production, for one reason or another, did not wind up re-adopting the gauge, and only a small handful of films used 65 mm during this time period; notably, ''[[Far and Away]]'', parts of ''[[Little Buddha]]'', [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s version of ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'', and parts of ''[[The New World]]''. Branagh's ''Hamlet'' also has the distinction of being the last known feature film to be shot entirely on 65 mm.<ref name="SUPER"/>

[[Image:pvxlstudio.jpg|thumb|left|The Panaflex Millennium XL series drastically reduced the size of the camera body through some modifications to the film transport mechanism.]]

As the end of the 1990s approached, it was clear that the movement for [[digital cinema]] was gaining [[mindshare]] in Hollywood, and so current CEO John Farrand moved to capitalize on this by both improving its film camera systems and approaching the vanguard of high-end digital camera development.<ref name="probstmill"/> To accomplish this on one end, the Millennium 35 mm camera was created. The design concept was to rethink every component of the Panavision line of cameras and integrate the latest space-age materials and technologies into the design of a new model. Nolan Murdock and Albert Mayer, Sr (who was on the design team for the original Panaflex) headed up the team, which started research and design in 1992.<ref name="probstmill"/> When released the Millennium camera replaced the Platinum as the flagship camera. This was followed by the Millennium XL (1999) and XL2 (2004).<ref name="KACZ">Kaczek, FrÃ©dÃ©ric-GÃ©rard.

Retrieved on [[2007-01-20]]</ref> The first feature films to use each of these cameras were ''[[The Perfect Storm]]'' and ''[[Just Like Heaven]]'', respectively. The XL series not only made for a much smaller camera body suitable for interoperability between studio, handheld, and steadicam work, but also marked the first significant change to the film transport mechanism in the camera since the Panaflex:  two smaller sprocket drums for feed and takeup (a design similar to the [[Moviecam]] and subsequent [[Arricam]]) instead of one large drum to do both.<ref>Probst, Christopher.

==Panavision goes digital==

After a number of aborted attempts to create a film-style video camera in the 1970s and 80, Panavision joined the digital revolution through the creation of DHD Ventures in July 2000, a partnership company co-owned with [[Sony]] for the creation of an high definition quality up to the standards of feature film production requirements.<ref>Panavision Inc.

The next step in the evolution of a digital cinema camera was also created through a collaboration between Sony and Panavision, but this time Panavision was involved from the initial stages of development. The plan was to create a digital cinema camera that could utilize all of the existing 35 mm lenses at Panavision's disposal (something not possible with 3-CCD video cameras like the F900). This lead to the creation of the Genesis HD camera in 2004, a [[chroma subsampling|full bandwidth (4:4:4)]] [[Serial Digital Interface|HD SDI]] camera with improved [[colorimetry]] and [[sensitometry]]-related specs and a [[Super 35 mm film]]-sized recording area, making it focally compatible with all regular 35 mm lenses and giving a true 35 mm [[depth of field]].<ref name="hodigital">Holben, Jay.
