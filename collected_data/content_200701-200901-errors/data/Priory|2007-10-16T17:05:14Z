A '''priory''' is a house of men or women under religious vows headed by a [[prior]] or prioress.

Priories may be houses of mendicant friars  or religious sisters (as the [[Dominicans]], [[Augustinian Hermits|Augustinians]] and [[Carmelites]], for instance), or monasteries of monks or nuns (as the [[Carthusians]]).

The [[Benedictines]] and their offshoots ([[Cistercians]] and [[Trappists]] among them), the [[Premonstratensians]], and the [[military orders]] distinguish between '''conventual''' and simple or '''obedientiary''' priories. '''Conventual priories''' are those autonomous houses which have no [[abbot]]s, either because the canonically required number of twelve monks has not yet been reached or for some other reason. At present the Benedictine Order has twenty-seven conventual priories. '''Simple''' or '''obedientiary priories''' are dependencies of abbeys. Their superior, who is subject to the abbot in everything, is called simple or obedientiary prior. These monasteries are satellites of the mother abbey.

Priories were originally Catholic institutions. A special case is the ecumenical priory of the [[Taizé Community]].
