'''Chew Magna''' ({{gbmapping|ST575631}}) is a village within the [[Chew Valley]] in [[Bath and North East Somerset|North East Somerset]], [[England]]. To the south of the village is [[Chew Valley Lake]]. The village is on the B3130, about 10 miles from [[Bristol]], 15 miles from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], 13 miles from the city of [[Wells]], and 6 miles from [[Bristol International Airport]]. 

It is just on the northern edge of the [[Mendip Hills]] (a designated [[Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in England and Wales|Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]), and was designated a [[conservation area]] in 1978.<ref>{{cite book | year = 1986 | title = Keynsham & Chew Valley Local Plan | publisher = Wansdyke District Council}}</ref> There are many [[listed buildings]] reflecting the history of the village. The [[River Chew]] flows through the village. Just outside the village is [[Chew Magna Reservoir]] this small [[Bristol Water]] supply reservoir intercepts the [[Winford]] Brook.

It has around 1,200 residents. There are two [[primary school]]s and a [[secondary school]], several shops and small businesses, three churches, three pubs serving the area. There is also a football pitch and children's play area. The village frequently wins regional categories in the [[Calor Village of the Year]] competition, and is currently moving towards [[zero waste]] status, having been described as "probably the greenest parish in Britain".<ref>{{cite web | title=Nothing venture | work=Guardian Unlimited : Society | url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/societyguardian/story/0,,1643091,00.html | accessdate=2006-05-12}}</ref>

== History ==
Chew Magna is the largest village in the district, and can trace its importance back to [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] times. It was a thriving woollen centre in the [[Middle Ages]]. The manor of Chew was held by the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]], from 1062 to 1548, and for that reason the village was called Chew Episcopi or Bishop's Chew. The Bishops built a palace near the church of St. Andrews, which was visited by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in 1250.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Robert |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A History of Somerset |year=1983 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |id=ISBN 0-85033-461-6 }}</ref> Chew Court is a surviving part of the palace. More recently, since about 1600, the name has been Chew Magna because this has been the most important of the several villages along the banks of the [[River Chew]]. 

According to Robinson it was an episcopal property held by [[Gisa, Bishop of Wells|Giso]], the last Saxon bishop and the name Magna comes from the Latin meaning 'the greater'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Somerset Place Names |year=1992 |publisher=The Dovecote Press Ltd |location=Wimbourne |isbn=1874336032}}</ref>

Around 1700 the Lord of the Manor was Sir William Jones the Attourney General of England<ref>{{cite book | author=Cruickshanks | year = 1986 | title = The House of Commons 1690 1715 5 Volume Set p527 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | id =ISBN 0-521-77221-4 }}</ref> and in the 1820s it was the seat of [[George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton|Lord Lyttelton]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Great Britain Parliament | year = 1849 | title = Hansards Parliamentary Debates p779 }}</ref> Until about 1880 the village had [[toll road]]s and a toll house to collect the fees.<ref name="durham2">{{cite book | author = Durham, I. & M.| year = 1991 | title = Chew Magna and the Chew Valley in old photographs | publisher = Redcliffe Press | id =ISBN 1-872971-61-X }}</ref>

During the 19th and 20th centuries the importance of the wool trade in the village declined and it became largely a [[Bedroom community|dormitory area]] for the cities of [[Bristol]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], although it has continued to be the commercial centre of the valley. The building of Chew Valley Lake in the 1950s has brought further opportunities for [[leisure]] and [[tourism]].

In the church are several memorials to the Stracheys of [[Stowey|Sutton Court]] together with a wooden [[effigy]] of a [[Knight]] cross-legged and leaning on one elbow, in 15th century [[armour]], thought to be of Sir John de Hauteville or a descendant, and possibly transferred from a church at Norton Hautville before it was demolished.<ref>{{cite book | author = Mason, Edmund J. & Mason, Doreen | year 1982 | title = Avon Villages | publisher = Robert Hale Ltd | id=ISBN 0-7091-9585-0 }}</ref> Another effigy in the north chapel is of Sir John Loe and his lady.

Mears and Stainbank of London to commemorate the [[Diamond Jubilee]] of [[Queen Victoria]]. Two additional bells, the gift of Brigadier Ommanney, were added in 1928 to complete the [[octave]], which does still contain two of the Bilbie bells.
