An '''aircraft carrier''' is a [[warship]] designed with a primary mission of deploying and recovering [[aircraft]], acting as a sea-going [[airbase]]. Aircraft carriers thus allow a [[navy|naval]] force to project [[air power]] great distances without having to depend on local bases for staging aircraft operations. They have evolved from wooden vessels used to deploy a [[balloon]] into [[nuclear powered]] warships that carry dozens of fixed and [[rotary wing]] aircraft.

[[Balloon carrier]]s were the first ships to deploy manned aircraft, used during the 19th and early 20th century, mainly for observation purposes. The 1903 advent of [[fixed wing]] airplanes was followed in 1910 by the first flight of such an aircraft from the deck of a US Navy [[cruiser]]. [[Seaplane]]s and [[seaplane tender]] support ships, such as {{HMS|Engadine|1911|6}}, followed. The development of flat top vessels produced the first large fleet ships. This evolution was well underway by the mid 1920s, resulting in ships such as the {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}}, ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Hōshō|Hōshō]]'', and the {{Sclass|Lexington|aircraft carrier|1}}s.

[[World War II]] saw the first large scale use and further refinement of the aircraft carrier, spawning several types. [[Escort aircraft carrier]]s, such as {{USS|Bogue|CVE-9|6}}, were built only during [[World War II]]. Although some were purpose built, most were converted from merchant ships, and were a stop-gap measure in order to provide air support for convoys and amphibious invasions. [[Light aircraft carrier]]s, such as {{USS|Independence|CVL-22|6}} represented a larger, more "militarized" version of the escort carrier concept. Although the light carriers usually carried the same size [[air groups]] as escort carriers, they had the advantage of higher speed as they had been converted from cruisers under construction rather than civilian merchant ships.

<!-- This section is far to detailed about tangental matters for the lead, and needs proper citations anyway. -->
Wartime [[Emergency|emergencies]] also saw the creation or conversion of other, unconventional aircraft carriers. [[CAM ship]]s, like the {{SS|Michael E}}, were cargo carrying merchant ships which could launch but not retrieve fighter aircraft from a catapult. These vessels were an emergency measure during World War II as were [[Merchant aircraft carrier]]s (MACs), such as {{MV|Empire MacAlpine}}, another emergency measure which saw cargo-carrying merchant ships equipped with flight decks. [[Battlecarrier]]s were created by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] to partially compensate for the loss of carrier strength at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]].{{Fact|date=March 2008}} Two of them were made from {{Sclass|Ise|battleship}}s during late 1943. The aft turrets were removed and replaced with a hangar, deck and catapult. The heavy cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Mogami (1934)|''Mogami'']] concurrently received a similar conversion. This "half and half" design was an unsuccessful compromise, being neither one thing nor the other. [[Submarine aircraft carrier]]s, such as the French [[French submarine Surcouf|''Surcouf'']], or the Japanese [[I-400 class submarine]]s, which were capable of carrying 3 [[Aichi]] [[Aichi M6A|M6A ''Seiran'']] aircraft, were first built in the 1920s, but were generally unsuccessful at war. Modern navies that operate such ships treat aircraft carriers as the [[capital ship]] of the fleet, a role previously played by the [[battleship]]. The change, part of the growth of air power as a significant part of warfare, took place during [[World War II]]. This change was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft.

Following the war, the scope of carrier operations continued to increase in size and importance. [[Supercarrier]]s, typically displacing 75,000&nbsp;tonnes or greater, have become the pinnacle of carrier development. Most are powered by nuclear reactors and form the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home. [[Amphibious assault ship]]s, such as {{USS|Tarawa|LHA-1|6}} or {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, serve the purpose of carrying and landing Marines and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose. Also known as "commando carriers" or "helicopter carriers", they have a secondary capability to operate VSTOL aircraft.

Lacking the firepower of other warships, carriers by themselves are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines or missiles and therefore travel as part of a [[carrier battle group]] (CVBG) for their protection. Unlike other types of capital ships in the 20th century, aircraft carrier designs since World War II have been effectively unlimited by any consideration save budgetary, and the ships have increased in size to handle the larger aircraft: The large, modern {{Sclass|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|4}} of United States Navy carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II-era {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same, a consequence of the steadily increasing size of military aircraft over the years.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

==History and milestones==

Though aircraft carriers are given their definition with respect to fixed-wing aircraft, the first known instance of using a ship for airborne operations occurred in 1806, when the British Royal Navy's Lord [[Thomas Cochrane]] launched kites from the 32-gun frigate {{HMS|Pallas}} in order to drop propaganda leaflets on the French territory. {{Fact|date=April 2008}}

===Balloon carriers===
{{main|Balloon carrier}}
[[Image:balloon barge.jpg|thumb|The Union Army balloon ''Washington'' aboard the ''George Washington Parke Custis'', towed by the tug '' Coeur de Lion''.]]

On [[12 July]] [[1849]], the Austrian Navy ship ''Vulcano'' launched a manned [[hot air balloon]] in order to drop bombs on [[Venice]], although the attempt failed due to contrary winds.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.sandcastlevi.com/sea/carriers/cvchap1a.htm |title=Carriers: Airpower at Sea - The Early Years / Part 1 |accessdate=2007-08-03 |first=Arnold E. van Beverhoudt, Jr. |date=2003-01-01 |work=sandcastlevi.com |publisher=Sandcastle VI }}</ref>

Later, during the [[American Civil War]], about the time of the [[Peninsula Campaign]], gas-filled [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]s were being used to perform reconnaissance on Confederate positions. The battles soon turned inland into the heavily forested areas of the Peninsula, however, where balloons could not travel. A coal barge, the George Washington Parke Custis, was cleared of all deck rigging to accommodate the gas generators and apparatus of balloons. From the GWP Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]], Chief Aeronaut of the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]], made his first ascents over the [[Potomac River]] and telegraphed claims of the success of the first aerial venture ever made from a water-borne vessel. Other barges were converted to assist with the other military balloons transported about the eastern waterways. It is only fair to point out in deference to modern aircraft carriers that none of these Civil War crafts had ever taken to the high seas.

Balloons launched from ships led to the development of [[balloon carrier]]s, or balloon tenders, during [[World War I]], by the navies of Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Sweden. About ten such "balloon tenders" were built, their main objective being aerial observation posts. These ships were either decommissioned or converted to [[seaplane tender]]s after the war.

===Seaplane carriers===
{{main|Seaplane carrier}}
[[Image:CanardVoisinJune1912.jpg|thumb|left|The first seaplane carrier, the French ''[[La Foudre]]'' (right, with hangar and crane), with one of her ''[[Canard Voisin]]'' seaplanes taking off, during tactical exercises in June 1912.]]

The invention of the [[seaplane]] in March 1910 with the French ''[[Le Canard]]'' led to the earliest development of a ship designed to carry airplanes, albeit equipped with floats: in December 1911 appears the French Navy ''[[La Foudre]]'', the first [[seaplane carrier]], and the first known carrier of [[airplanes]]. Commissioned as a seaplane tender, and carrying float-equipped planes under hangars on the main deck, from where they were lowered on the sea with a crane, she participated in tactical exercises in the Mediterranean in 1912. ''La Foudre'' was further modified in November 1913 with a 10 meter long flat deck to launch her seaplanes.<ref>[http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/carriers/france.htm#foud Description]and [http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/carriers/images/europe/foudre-2.jpg photograph] of ''Foudre''</ref>

{{HMS|Hermes|1913|6}}, temporarily converted as an experimental seaplane carrier in April-May 1913, is also one of the first seaplane carriers, and the first experimental seaplane carrier of the British Navy. She was originally laid down as a merchant ship, but was converted on the building stocks to be a seaplane carrier for a few trials in 1913, before being converted again to a cruiser, and back again to a seaplane carrier in 1914. She was sunk by a German submarine in October 1914. The first seaplane tender of the US Navy was the {{USS|Mississippi|BB-23|6}}, converted to that role in December 1913.<ref>[http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/carriers/us_sea1.htm First US seaplane carrier, the USS ''Mississippi'']</ref>

Many [[cruiser (warship)|cruisers]] and [[capital ship]]s of the inter-war years often carried a catapult launched seaplane for reconnaissance and spotting the fall of the guns. It was launched by a catapult and recovered by crane from the water after landing. These were highly successful during World War II; there were many notable successes early in the war as shown by {{HMS|Warspite|1913|6}}’s float equipped [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] during the [[Second Battle of Narvik]] in 1940, where it spotted for the guns of the British warships, ensuring all seven German destroyers were sunk, and sinking the German submarine [[U-64]] with its own bombs.<ref name="Green V6 p90-91"> {{cite book |title=War Planes of the Second World War: Volume Six: Floatplanes |last=Green |first= William|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1962 |publisher=Macdonald |location=London |isbn= |pages=p. 90-91 }}</ref>  The Japanese Rufe floatplane derived from the Zero was a formidable fighter with only a slight loss in flight performance; one of their pilots scored 26 kills in the [[A6M2-N Rufe]], a score only bettered by a handful of American pilots throughout WW2. {{Fact|date=April 2008}} Other Japanese seaplanes launched from tenders and warships sank merchant ships and conducted small-scale ground attacks. The culmination of the type was the American 300+ mph ({{nowrap|480 km/h}}) Curtiss [[SC Seahawk]] which was actually a fighter aircraft like the Rufe in addition to a two-seat gunnery spotter and transport for an injured man in a litter. {{Fact|date=April 2008}}Spotter seaplane aircraft on U.S. Navy cruisers and battleships were in service until 1949. Seaplane fighters were considered poor combat aircraft compared to their carrier-launched brethren; they were slower due to the drag of their pontoons or boat hulls. Contemporary propeller-driven, land-based fighter aircraft were much faster ({{nowrap|450-480 mph}} / {{nowrap|720-770 km/h}} as opposed to {{nowrap|300-350 mph}} / {{nowrap|480-560 km/h)}} and more heavily armed. {{Fact|date=April 2008}} The [[Curtiss Seahawk]] only had two 0.50 inch ({{nowrap|12.7 mm}}) calibre machine guns compared to four {{nowrap|20 mm}} cannon in the Grumman [[F8F Bearcat]] or four 0.50 ({{nowrap|12.7 mm}}) cal machine guns plus two {{nowrap|20 mm}} cannon in the Vought [[F4U Corsair]]. Jet aircraft of just a few years later were faster still (500+ mph) and still better armed, especially with the development of [[air to air missile]]s in the early to mid 1950s.

|-
| style="text-align: left;" | [[Clément Ader]], "[[L'Aviation Militaire]]", 1909
|}
As heavier-than-air aircraft developed in the early 20th century, various navies began to take an interest in their potential use as scouts for their big gun warships. In 1909 the French inventor [[Clément Ader]] published in his book "[[L'Aviation Militaire]]" the description of a ship to operate airplanes at sea, with a flat flight deck, an island [[superstructure]], deck elevators and a hangar bay.<ref>Clement Ader on the structure of the aircraft carrier:<br>
"An airplane-carrying vessel is indispensable. These vessels will be constructed on a plan very different from what is currently used. First of all the deck will be cleared of all obstacles. It will be flat, as wide as possible without jeopardizing the nautical lines of the hull, and it will look like a landing field." Military Aviation, p35<br>
On stowage:<br>
"Of necessity, the airplanes will be stowed below decks; they would be solidly fixed anchored to their bases, each in its place, so they would not be affected with the pitching and rolling. Access to this lower decks would be by an elevator sufficiently long and wide to hold an airplane with its wings folded. A large, sliding trap would cover the hole in the deck, and it would have waterproof joints, so that neither rain nor seawater, from heavy seas could penetrate below." Military Aviation, p36<br>
On the technique of landing:<br>
"The ship will be headed straight into the wind, the stern clear, but a padded bulwark set up forward in case the airplane should run past the stop line" Military Aviation, p37</ref> That year the US Naval Attaché in Paris sent a report on his observations.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.sandcastlevi.com/sea/carriers/cvchap1b.htm |title=Carriers: Airpower at Sea - The Early Years / Part 2 |accessdate=2007-08-03 |first=Arnold E. van Beverhoudt, Jr. |date=2003-01-01 |work=sandcastlevi.com |publisher=Sandcastle VI }}</ref>

[[Image:First airplane takeoff from a warship.jpg|thumb|left|Ely takes off from<br>USS ''Birmingham'', [[14 November]] [[1910]].]]

A number of experimental flights were made to test the concept. [[Eugene Ely]] was the first [[Aviator|pilot]] to launch from a stationary ship in November 1910. He took off from a structure fixed over the forecastle of the US [[armored cruiser]] {{USS|Birmingham|CL-2|6}} at [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]] and landed nearby on [[Willoughby Spit]] after some five minutes in the air.

[[Image:USS Pennsylvania - First airplane landing.jpg|thumb|Ely lands on USS ''Pennsylvania'', <br>[[18 January]] [[1911]].]]

On [[January 18]] [[1911]] he became the first pilot to land on a stationary ship. He took off from the [[The Shops at Tanforan|Tanforan racetrack]] and landed on a similar temporary structure on the aft of {{USS|Pennsylvania|ACR-4|6}} anchored at the [[San Francisco]] waterfront&mdash;the improvised braking system of sandbags and ropes led directly to the arrestor hook and wires described above. His aircraft was then turned around and he was able to take off again. [[Commander]] [[Charles Rumney Samson]], [[Royal Navy|RN]], became the first airman to take off from a moving warship on [[May 2]] [[1912]]. He took off in a [[Short S27]] from the battleship {{HMS|Hibernia|1905|6}} while she steamed at 10.5&nbsp;knots ({{nowrap|19 km/h}}) during the [[Royal Fleet Review]] at [[Weymouth]].

===World War I===
[[Image:Wakamiya.jpg|thumb|The Japanese seaplane carrier [[Japanese seaplane carrier Wakamiya|''Wakamiya'']] conducted the world's first naval-launched air raids in September 1914.]]

The first strike from a carrier against a land target as well as a sea target took place in September 1914 when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] seaplane carrier [[Japanese seaplane carrier Wakamiya|''Wakamiya'']] conducted the world's first naval-launched air raids<ref>Wakamiya is "credited with conducting the first successful carrier air raid in history" [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/index.html Source:GlobalSecurity.org], also "the first air raid in history to result in a success" ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/wakamiya-av.htm here])</ref> from [[Kiaochow Bay]] during the [[Battle of Tsingtao]] in China.<ref>"Sabre et pinceau", Christian Polak, p92</ref> The four [[Maurice Farman]] seaplanes bombarded German-held land targets (communication centers and command centers) and damaged a German minelayer in the [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]] peninsula from September until [[November 6]] [[1914]], when the Germans surrendered.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/wakamiya-av.htm GlobalSecurity: ''IJN Wakamiya Seaplane Carrier'']accessed 2007-11-20.</ref> On the Western front the first naval air raid occurred on [[December 25]] [[1914]] when twelve seaplanes from {{HMS|Engadine|1911|6}}, {{HMS|Riviera|3=2}} and {{HMS|Empress|1914|2}} (cross-channel steamers converted into seaplane carriers) [[Cuxhaven Raid|attacked the Zeppelin base at Cuxhaven]]. The attack was not a complete success, although a German warship was damaged; nevertheless the raid demonstrated in the European theatre the feasibility of attack by ship-borne aircraft and showed the strategic importance of this new weapon. 

[[Image:Ark Royal (1914).jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Ark Royal|1914|6}}, a seaplane carrier also equipped with two regular aeroplanes, was arguably the first modern aircraft carrier.]]

{{HMS|Ark Royal|1914|6}} was arguably the first modern aircraft carrier. She was originally laid down as a merchant ship, but was converted on the building stocks to be a hybrid airplane/seaplane carrier with a launch platform. Launched [[September 5]] [[1914]], she served in the [[Dardanelles]] campaign and throughout World War I.

Other carrier operations were mounted during the war, the most successful taking place on [[19 July]] [[1918]] when seven [[Sopwith Camel]]s launched from {{HMS|Furious|1916|6}} attacked the German [[Zeppelin]] base at [[Tondern]], with two {{Auto lb|50|0}} bombs each. Several [[airship]]s and [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]s were destroyed, but as the carrier had no method of recovering the aircraft safely, two of the pilots ditched their aircraft in the sea alongside the carrier while the others headed for neutral [[Denmark]].

===Inter-war years===
[[Image:H42235.jpg|thumb|upright|The first full-length flat deck, {{HMS|Argus|I49|6}} in 1918]]

The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922 placed strict limits on the tonnages of battleships and [[battlecruiser]]s for the major naval powers after [[World War I]], as well as not only a limit on the total tonnage for carriers, but also an upper limit of 27,000&nbsp;tonnes for each ship. Although exceptions were made regarding the maximum ship tonnage (fleet units counted, experimental units did not), the total tonnage could not be exceeded. However, while all of the major navies were over-tonnage on battleships, they were all considerably under-tonnage on aircraft carriers. Consequently, many battleships and battlecruisers under construction (or in service) were converted into aircraft carriers. The first ship to have a full length flat deck was {{HMS|Argus|1917|6}}, the conversion of which was completed in September 1918, with the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] not following suit until 1920, when the conversion of {{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}} (an experimental ship which did not count against America's carrier tonnage) had completed. The first American fleet carriers would not join the service until November, 1927 when the {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} was commissioned. ({{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}} was commissioned in December of that year.)

[[Image:Japanese aircraft carrier Hosho.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s 1922 [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hōshō|''Hōshō'']], was the world's first built-from-the-keel-up aircraft carrier.<ref name=globalsecurity/>]]

The first purpose-designed aircraft carrier to be laid down was the {{HMS|Hermes|1923|6}} in 1918. Japan began work on [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hōshō|''Hōshō'']] the following year. In December 1922, ''Hōshō'' became the first to be commissioned, while HMS ''Hermes'' began service in July 1923.<ref name=globalsecurity>"Hōshō was a carrier from the keel, the first of its kind completed in any navy of the world" Scot MacDonald [http://www.history.navy.mil/download/car-7.pdf US Navy History: ''Evolution of Aircraft Carriers'']</ref><ref>"The Imperial Japanese Navy was a pioneer in naval aviation, having commissioned the world's first built-from-the-keel-up carrier, the ''Hosho''." [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ijn.htm GlobalSecurity: ''Carrier Hosho''].</ref> ''Hermes''<nowiki>'</nowiki> design preceded and influenced that of ''Hōshō'', and its construction actually began earlier, but numerous tests, experiments and budget considerations delayed its commission.

By the late 1930s, aircraft carriers around the world typically carried three types of aircraft: [[torpedo bomber]]s, also used for conventional bombings and [[reconnaissance]]; [[dive bomber]]s, also used for reconnaissance (in the U.S. Navy, aircraft of this type  were known as "scout bombers"); and [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] for fleet defence and bomber escort duties. Because of the restricted space on aircraft carriers, all these aircraft were of small, single-engined types, usually with [[folding wing]]s to facilitate storage.

===World War II===
[[Image:HMS Audacity (D10).jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Audacity|D10|6}} was the world's first escort carrier]]

Aircraft carriers played a significant role in World War II. With seven aircraft carriers afloat, the British Royal Navy had a considerable numerical advantage at the start of the war as neither the Germans nor the Italians had carriers of their own.<ref>{{cite book |title=World War Two: A Military History  |last=Black |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Black |year= 2003|publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0415305349 |pages=p.17}} </ref> However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of {{HMS|Glorious|77|6}} by [[Germany|German]] battlecruisers during the Norwegian campaign in 1940. 

This apparent weakness to battleships was turned on its head in November 1940 when {{HMS|Illustrious|R87|6}} launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at [[Battle of Taranto|Taranto]]. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships in the harbour at a cost of two of the 21 attacking [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bombers]]. Carriers also played a major part in reinforcing [[Malta]], both by transporting planes and by defending convoys sent to supply the besieged island. The use of carriers prevented the [[Italian Navy]] and land-based German aircraft from dominating the [[Mediterranean]] theatre.

In the Atlantic, aircraft from {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} and {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}} were responsible for slowing [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] during May 1941. Later in the war, escort carriers proved their worth guarding convoys crossing the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]] and [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic]] oceans.

[[Image:Aerial photography of HMS Victorious.jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}} during [[World War II]].]]

Many of the major battles in the [[Pacific]] involved aircraft carriers. [[Japan]] started the war with ten aircraft carriers, the largest and most modern carrier fleet in the world at that time. There were six American aircraft carriers at the beginning of the hostilities, although only three of them were operating in the Pacific.

Drawing on the 1939 Japanese development of shallow water modifications for aerial torpedoes and the 1940 British aerial attack on the Italian fleet at [[Taranto]], the 1941 Japanese surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was a clear illustration of the [[power projection]] capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single striking unit marked a turning point in naval history, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. (Though Germany and Italy began construction of carriers, neither ship was completed. Of the two, Germany's ''[[German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' had the greater potential.)

Meanwhile, the Japanese began their advance through [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']] by Japanese land-based aircraft drove home the need for this ship class for fleet defence from aerial attack. In April 1942, the Japanese fast carrier strike force ranged into the [[Indian Ocean raid|Indian Ocean]] and sank shipping, including the damaged and undefended carrier {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}}. Smaller Allied fleets with inadequate aerial protection were forced to retreat or be destroyed. In the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]], US and Japanese fleets traded aircraft strikes in the first battle where neither side's ships sighted the other and carriers fought each other for the first time. At the [[Battle of Midway]] all four Japanese carriers engaged were sunk by planes from three American carriers (one of which was lost) and the battle is considered the turning point of the war in the Pacific. Notably, the battle was orchestrated by the Japanese to draw out American carriers that had proven very elusive and troublesome to the Japanese. 

[[Image:USS Saratoga Enterprise Hornet San-Jacinto 701512.jpg|thumb|right|4 US Navy carriers right after the war, showing the size and length difference between an early battlecruiser conversion, the {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} (bottom), an early fleet carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}} (2nd from bottom), a war time built ''[[Essex class aircraft carrier|Essex]]''-class carrier (2nd from top, the {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|2}}) and a light carrier based on a cruiser hull, the {{USS|San Jacinto|CVL-30|2}} (top).]]

Subsequently the US was able to build up large numbers of aircraft aboard a mixture of [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''fleet'']], [[Independence class aircraft carrier|''light'']] and (newly commissioned) [[Escort carriers|''escort carriers'']], primarily with the introduction of the [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''Essex'' class]] in 1943. These ships, around which were built the fast carrier task forces of the [[United States 3rd Fleet|Third]] and [[United States 5th Fleet|Fifth Fleets]], played a major part in winning the [[Pacific war]].  The reign of the battleship as the primary component of a fleet ended when U.S. carrier-borne aircraft sunk the largest battleships ever built, the Japanese super battleships [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']] in 1944 and [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] in 1945.  Japan also built the largest aircraft carrier of the war, [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano|''Shinano'']], which was a ''Yamato'' class ship converted mid-way through construction after the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at [[Battle of midway|''Midway'']]. She was sunk by the patrolling US submarine {{USS|Archer-Fish|SS-311|2}} while in transit shortly after commissioning, but before being fully outfitted or operational in November 1944.

==Important innovations just before and during World War II==
[[Image:HIJMS Taiho 02.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Taihō|''Taihō'']] had a hurricane bow.]]
[[Image:USS Saratoga.jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} circa 1935.]]

===Hurricane bow=== <!-- Added subheader so this could be linked to from articles such as USS Hornet (CV-12) -->

A hurricane bow is a completely enclosed hangar deck, first seen on the American [[Lexington class aircraft carrier|''Lexington'' class]] aircraft carriers which entered service in 1927. Combat experience proved it to be by far the most useful configuration for the bow of the ship among others that were tried; including second flying-off decks and an anti-aircraft battery (the latter was the most common American configuration during World War II). {{Fact|date=April 2008}}This feature would be re-incorporated into American carriers post-war. The Japanese carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Taihō|''Taihō'']] was the first of their ships to incorporate it.

===Light aircraft carriers===

The loss of three major carriers in quick succession in the Pacific led the US Navy to develop the light carrier (CVL) from [[light cruiser]] hulls that had already been laid down. They were intended to provide additional fast carriers, as escort carriers did not have the requisite speed to keep up with the fleet carriers and their escorts. The actual U.S. Navy classification was small aircraft carrier (CVL), not light. Prior to July 1943, they were just classified as aircraft carriers (CV).<ref>CVL--Small Aircraft Carriers, [[Naval Historical Center]], http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/cvl-no.htm, accessed 22 September 2006.</ref>  

The British Royal Navy made a similar design which served both them and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries after World War II. One of these carriers, India's [[INS Viraat|INS ''Viraat'']], formerly {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}}, is still being used.

===Escort carriers and merchant aircraft carriers===

To protect Atlantic [[convoy]]s, the British developed what they called [[Merchant Aircraft Carrier]]s, which were merchant ships equipped with a flat deck for half a dozen aircraft. These operated with civilian crews, under merchant colors, and carried their normal cargo besides providing air support for the convoy. As there was no lift or hangar, aircraft maintenance was limited and the aircraft spent the entire trip sitting on the deck.

These served as stop-gap until dedicated [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]] could be built in the US (US classification ''CVE''). About a third of the size of a fleet carrier, it carried about two dozen aircraft for anti-submarine duties. Over one hundred were built or converted from merchantmen.

Escort carriers were built in the US from two basic hull designs: one from a merchant ship, and the other from a slightly larger, slightly faster tanker. Besides defending convoys, these were used to transport aircraft across the ocean. Nevertheless, some participated in the battles to liberate the [[Philippines]], notably the [[Battle off Samar]] in which six escort carriers and their escorting destroyers briefly took on five Japanese battleships and bluffed them into retreating.

===Catapult aircraft merchantmen===

As an emergency stop-gap before sufficient merchant aircraft carriers became available, the British provided air cover for convoys using ''Catapult aircraft merchantman'' (CAM ships) and [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s. CAM ships were merchant vessels equipped with an aircraft, usually a battle-weary [[Hawker Hurricane]], launched by a catapult. Once launched, the aircraft could not land back on the deck and had to ditch in the sea if it was not within range of land. Over two years, fewer than 10 launches were ever made, yet these flights did have some success: 6 bombers for the loss of a single pilot.

==Post-war developments==

[[Image:DeHavilland Vampire HMS Ocean Dec1945 NAN1 47.jpg|thumb|The first carrier landing and take-off of a jet aircraft - [[Eric "Winkle" Brown]] landing on {{HMS|Ocean|R68|6}} in 1945]]

Three major post-war developments came from the need to improve operations of jet-powered aircraft, which had higher weights and landing speeds than their propeller-powered forbears.

The first jet landing on a carrier was made by [[Eric "Winkle" Brown|Lt Cdr Eric "Winkle" Brown]] who landed on {{HMS|Ocean|R68|6}} in the specially modified [[de Havilland Vampire]] ''[[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|LZ551/G]]'' [http://www.airliners.net/photo/UK---Navy/De-Havilland-Sea/1312997/L/&width=1200&height=812&sok=WHERE__(reg_%3D_%27LZ551%27)_&sort=_order_by_photo_id_DESC_&photo_nr=1&prev_id=&next_id=1188987] on [[3 December]] [[1945]].<ref name=BritishNavalAviation>{{cite book | last = Sturtivant | first = Ray | title = Btitish Naval Aviation, The Fleet Air Arm, 1917-1990 | publisher = Arm & Armour Press | year = 1990 | location = London | doi = 358.4'00941 | isbn = 0 85368 938 5}}</ref>  Brown is also notable for being the all-time record holder for the number of carrier landings (2,407).<ref name=BritishNavalAviation/>

After these successful tests, there were still many misgivings about the suitability of operating jet aircraft routinely from carriers and ''LZ551/G'' was taken to [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]] to participate in trials of the experimental "rubber deck".  Despite a lot of effort in developing this idea, it was found to be unnecessary and following the introduction of angled flight decks, jets were operating from carriers by the mid 1950s.<ref name=BritishNavalAviation/>

===Angled decks===
[[Image:Cvnanim.gif|thumb|left| The angled [[flight deck]] allows for safe simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft.]]

During the Second World War, aircraft would land on the flight deck parallel to the long axis of the ship's [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]. Aircraft which had already landed would be parked on the deck at the bow end of the flight deck. A crash barrier was raised behind them to stop any landing aircraft which overshot the landing area because its landing hook missed the arrestor cables. If this happened, it would often cause serious damage or injury and even, if the crash barrier was not strong enough, destruction of parked aircraft.

An important development of the early 1950s was the British invention of the angled deck by Capt D.R.F. Campbell RN in conjunction with Lewis Boddington,<ref name=BritishNavalAviation/> where the runway was canted at an angle of a few degrees from the longitudinal axis of the ship. If an aircraft misses the arrestor cables (referred to as a "[[bolter (aviation)|bolter]]"), the pilot only needs to increase [[engine]] power to maximum to get airborne again and will not hit the parked aircraft because the angled deck points out over the sea.

The first trials of an angled flight deck were conducted aboard {{HMS|Triumph|R16|6}}<ref name=BritishNavalAviation/> using a painted on angled runway in 1952.  The first carriers to be modified with a port side extension for the angled flight deck were {{USS|Antietam|CV-36|2}} in  December 1952 and {{HMS|Centaur|R06|6}} in 1954.<ref name=seapowerangledeck>{{cite web | title = Sea Power Centre Australia, HMA Ship Histories | url = http://www.navy.gov.au/spc/history/ships/melbourne2-deck.html | accessdate = 10 June 1008}}</ref>  The first three ships to be actually completed with angled flight decks were all delivered in 1955: {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} in February, {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}} in October and {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}} in November.<ref name=seapowerangledeck/>

===Steam catapults===

The modern [[Aircraft catapult|steam-powered catapult]], powered by steam from the ship's [[boiler]]s or reactors, was invented by Commander C.C. Mitchell of the British [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNVR]].<ref name=BritishNavalAviation/> It was widely adopted following trials on {{HMS|Perseus|R51|6}} between 1950 and 1952 which showed it to be more powerful and reliable than the hydraulic catapults which had been introduced in the 1940s.<ref name=BritishNavalAviation/>

===Optical Landing Systems===
[[Image:FS CdG Optics.jpg|thumb|Landing optics of ''[[FS Charles de Gaulle|Charles de Gaulle]]'', note that this system is of the later [[Fresnel lens]] design.]]

The first of the [[Optical Landing System]]s was another British innovation, the [[Mirror landing aid|Mirror Landing Aid]] invented by Lieutenant Commander H. C. N. Goodhart RN.<ref name=BritishNavalAviation/> This was a gyroscopically-controlled convex mirror (in later designs replaced by a [[Fresnel lens]] Optical Landing System) on the port side of the deck.  On either side of the mirror was a line of green "datum" lights. A bright orange "source" light was shone into the mirror creating the "ball" (or "meatball" in later USN parlance), which could be seen by the aviator who was about to land. The position of the ball compared to the datum lights indicated the aircraft's position in relation to the desired glidepath: if the ball was above the datum, the plane was high; below the datum, the plane was low; between the datum, the plane was on glidepath. The gyro stabilisation compensated for much of the movement of the flight deck due to the sea, giving a constant glidepath.  The first trials of a mirror landing sight were conducted on HMS ''Illustrious'' in 1952.<ref name=BritishNavalAviation/>  Prior to OLS's, pilots relied on visual flag signals from Landing Signal Officers [[LSO]]s to help maintain proper glidepath.

===Nuclear age===

The US Navy attempted to become a strategic nuclear force in parallel with the USAF long range bombers with the project to build {{USS|United States|CVA-58|2}}, which was termed CVA, with the "A" signifying "atomic". This ship would have carried long range twin-engine bombers, each of which could carry an atomic bomb. The project was canceled under pressure from the newly-created [[United States Air Force]], and the letter "A" was re-cycled to mean "attack." But this only delayed the growth of carriers. [[Nuclear weapon]]s would be part of the carrier weapons load despite Air Force objections beginning in 1955 aboard {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}}, and by the end of the fifties the Navy had a series of nuclear-armed attack aircraft (see also [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)#Early career|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'' (CV-42)]]).

The US Navy also built the first aircraft carrier to be powered by nuclear reactors. {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} is powered by eight nuclear reactors and was the second surface warship (after {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|6}}) to be powered in this way. Subsequent supercarriers starting with {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68|6}} took advantage of this technology to increase their endurance utilizing only two reactors. The only other nation to have followed the US lead is France with [[FS Charles de Gaulle|''Charles de Gaulle'']] although nuclear power is used for submarine propulsion by France, Great Britain, China and the former Soviet Union.

===Helicopters===
[[Image:USS Tripoli LPH10 a.jpg|thumb|The ''Tripoli'', a US Navy ''Iwo Jima'' class helicopter carrier]]

The post-war years also saw the development of the [[helicopter]], with a variety of useful roles and mission capability aboard aircraft carriers. Whereas fixed-wing aircraft are suited to air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack, helicopters are used to transport equipment and personnel and can be used in an [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) role, with dipping sonar, air-launched torpedoes, and depth charges; as well as anti-surface vessel warfare, with air-launched anti-ship missiles.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the UK and the U.S. converted some of their older carriers into Commando Carriers or [[Landing Platform Helicopter|LPHs]]; sea-going helicopter airfields like {{HMS|Bulwark|R08|6}}. To mitigate against the expensive connotations of the term "aircraft carrier", the new [[Invincible class aircraft carriers|''Invincible'' class]] carriers were originally designated as "through deck cruisers" and were initially helicopter-only craft to operate as escort carriers. The arrival of the Sea Harrier [[VTOL]]/[[STOVL]] fast jet meant they could carry fixed-wing aircraft, despite their short flight deck. 

The U.S. used some {{Sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier|0}} carriers initially as pure ASW carriers, embarking helicopters and fixed-wing ASW aircraft like the [[S-2 Tracker]]. Later, specialized [[Landing Platform Helicopter|LPH]] helicopter carriers for the transport of [[United States Marine Corps]] troops and their helicopter transports were developed. These were evolved into the [[Landing Helicopter Assault|LHA]] and later into the [[Landing Helicopter Dock|LHD]] classes of amphibious assault ships, the U.S. Navy LHA and LHD ships normally also embark a few [[AV-8B Harrier II|Harrier]] aircraft.

===Ski-jump ramp===
[[Image:INS Viraat (R22) Malabar 07.jpg|thumb|[[India]]'s light carrier [[INS Viraat|INS ''Viraat'']], with ski-jump]]

Another British innovation was the ski-jump ramp as an alternative to contemporary catapult systems.<ref name=BritishNavalAviation/> As the [[Royal Navy]] retired or sold the last of its [[World War II]]-era carriers, they were replaced with smaller ships designed to operate helicopters and the [[VTOL]] [[Sea Harrier]] jet; ships such as [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|HMS ''Invincible'']]. The ski-jump gave the Harriers a [[STOVL]] capability, allowing them to take off with heavier payloads.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} It has since been adopted by the navies of several nations.

==Post-World War II conflicts==
===UN carrier operations in the Korean War===

The United Nations command began carrier operations against the [[North Korean Army]] on [[July 3]], [[1950]] in response to the invasion of [[South Korea]]. [[Task Force 77]] consisted at that time of the carriers {{USS|Valley Forge|CV-45|6}} and {{HMS|Triumph|R16|6}}. Before the armistice of [[July 27]], [[1953]], 12 U.S. carriers served 27 tours in the [[Sea of Japan]] as part of the Task Force 77. During periods of intensive air operations as many as four carriers were on the line at the same time (see [[Attack on the Sui-ho Dam]]), but the norm was two on the line with a third "ready" carrier at [[Yokosuka]] able to respond to the Sea of Japan at short notice.

A second carrier unit, Task Force 95, served as a blockade force in the [[Yellow Sea]] off the west coast of North Korea. The task force consisted of a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] light carrier ({{HMS|Triumph|R16|6}}, {{HMS|Theseus|R64|2}}, {{HMS|Glory|R62|2}}, {{HMS|Ocean|R68|2}}, and {{HMAS|Sydney|R17|6}} and usually a U.S. escort carrier ({{USS|Badoeng Strait|CVE-116|6}}, {{USS|Bairoko|CVE-115|2}}, {{USS|Point Cruz|CVE-119|2}}, {{USS|Rendova|CVE-114|2}}, and {{USS|Sicily|CVE-118|2}}).

Over 301,000 carrier strikes were flown during the Korean War: 255,545 by the aircraft of Task Force 77; 25,400 by the Commonwealth aircraft of Task Force 95, and 20,375 by the escort carriers of Task Force 95. United States Navy and Marine Corps carrier-based combat losses were 541 aircraft. The [[Fleet Air Arm]] lost 86 aircraft in combat, and the Australian [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]] 15.

===Post-colonial conflicts===
In the period following WW-II through the 1960s the UK, France and the Netherlands employed their carriers during decolonization conflicts of former colonies.  

France employed the carriers [[HMS Biter (D97)|''Dixmude'']], [[La Fayette (R96)|''La Fayette'']], [[USS Belleau Wood (CVL-24)|''Bois Belleau'']], and [[Arromanches (R 95)|''Arromanches'']] as bases to strike enemy positions during the 1946-1954 [[First Indochina War]].<ref>http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/carriers/france.htm</ref>

England and France used carrier based aircraft from the [[HMS Eagle (R05)|''HMS Eagle'']], [[HMS Albion (R07)|''HMS Albion'']], [[HMS Bulwark (R08)|''HMS Bulwark'']], [[Arromanches (R 95)|''Arromanches'']], and [[La Fayette (R96)|''La Fayette'']] to hit Egyptian positions and the [[HMS Ocean (R68)|''HMS Ocean'']] and [[HMS Theseus (R64)|''HMS Theseus'']] as floating bases to ferry troops ashore by helicopter during the [[1956]] [[Suez Crisis]] in the first ever large-scale helicopter borne assault.  <ref>http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_256.shtml</ref>

The Netherlands deployed the [[HNLMS Karel Doorman (R81)|''Karel Doorman'']] and an escorting battle group to its colony [[Western New Guinea]] in [[1962]] to protect it from [[Indonesia]]n invasion, this intervention which nearly resulted in her being attacked by the [[Indonesian Air Force]] using Soviet supplied [[Tupolev Tu-16|Tupolev Tu-16KS-1 Badger]] anti-ship missile carrying naval bombers, this was avoided by a last minute cease fire.<ref>http://www.angkasa-online.com/09/12/english/english1.htm</ref>

In [[1964]]-[[1967]] the [[Royal Navy]] deployed the [[Eastern Fleet|Far East Fleet]] carriers [[HMS Ark Royal (R09)|HMS Ark Royal]], [[HMS Centaur (R06)|HMS Centaur]], and [[HMS Victorious (R38)|HMS Victorious]] in support of Borneo Operations against the invading Indonesians in defense of [[Malaysia]].  [[HMS Albion (R07)|''HMS Albion'']] and [[HMS Bulwark (R08)|''HMS Bulwark'']] were deployed as commando carriers.  The Australian carrier [[HMAS Sydney (R17)|HMAS Sydney]] served as a troop transport.<ref>http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Borneo/units.html</ref>

===U.S. carrier operations in Southeast Asia===

The United States Navy fought "the most protracted, bitter, and costly war" (René Francillon) in the history of naval aviation from [[August 2]], [[1964]] to [[August 15]], [[1973]] in the waters of the [[South China Sea]]. Operating from two deployment points ([[Yankee Station]] and [[Dixie Station]]), carrier aircraft supported combat operations in [[South Vietnam]] and conducted bombing operations in conjunction with the [[U.S. Air Force]] in [[North Vietnam]] under [[Operation Flaming Dart|Operations Flaming Dart]], [[Operation Rolling Thunder|Rolling Thunder]], and [[Operation Linebacker|Linebacker]]. The number of carriers on the line varied during differing points of the conflict, but as many as six operated at one time during [[Operation Linebacker]].

Twenty-one aircraft carriers (all operational attack carriers during the era except {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|2}}) deployed to [[Task Force 77]] of the U.S. [[Seventh Fleet]], conducting 86 war cruises and operating 9,178 total days on the line in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. 530 aircraft were lost in combat and 329 more in operational accidents, causing the deaths of 377 naval aviators, with 64 others reported missing and 179 taken [[prisoner-of-war]]. 205 officers and men of the ship's complements of three carriers ({{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|2}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|2}}, and {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|2}}) were killed in major shipboard fires.

===Falklands War===
[[Image:HMS Invincible (R05) Norfolk.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}.]]

During the [[Falklands War]] the United Kingdom was able to win a conflict 8,000&nbsp;miles (13,000&nbsp;km) from home in large part due to the use of the light fleet carrier {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}} and the smaller "through deck cruiser" {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}. The Falklands showed the value of a [[STOVL]] aircraft&mdash;the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] (the RN [[Sea Harrier]] and press-ganged RAF Harriers)&mdash;in defending the fleet and assault force from shore based aircraft and for attacking the enemy. Sea Harriers shot down 21 fast attack jets and suffered no aerial combat losses, although six were lost to accidents and ground fire. Helicopters from the carriers were used to deploy troops, [[medevac]], [[Search and rescue|SAR]] and [[ASW]].

An opposite lesson from the Falklands War was the withdrawal of Argentina's aircraft carrier [[ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2)|ARA ''Veinticinco de Mayo'']] with her [[A-4 Skyhawk|A-4Qs]]. The sinking of the Argentine cruiser [[ARA General Belgrano|ARA ''General Belgrano'']] caused the premature home deployment as it showed that capital ships were vulnerable in the nuclear submarines' hunting ground.

===Operations in the Persian Gulf===

The US has also made use of carriers in the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Afghanistan]] and to protect its interests in the Pacific. During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] US aircraft carriers served as the primary base of US air power. Even without the ability to place significant numbers of aircraft in Middle Eastern airbases, the United States was capable of carrying out significant air attacks from carrier-based squadrons. Recently, US aircraft carriers, such as the {{USS|Ronald Reagan|CVN-76|2}} provided air support for counter-insurgency operations in Iraq.

==Aircraft carriers today==
[[Image:Fleet 5 nations.jpg|thumb|Four modern aircraft carriers of various types – {{USS|John C. Stennis|CVN-74|6}}, [[FS Charles de Gaulle|FS ''Charles de Gaulle'']], {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}} and {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|6}} — and escort vessels on operations in 2002. The ships are sailing much closer together than they would during combat operations.]]

Aircraft carriers are generally the largest ships operated by [[Navy|navies]]; a [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz'']] class carrier powered by two [[nuclear reactor]]s and four [[steam turbine]]s is {{nowrap|1092 feet}} ({{nowrap|333 m}}) long and costs about $4.5 billion. The United States has the majority of aircraft carriers with eleven in service, one under construction, and one on order (it has to be noted that all of them are supercarriers), and is also the only country with [[supercarriers]]. Its aircraft carriers are a cornerstone of American power projection capability. 

Nine countries maintain [[List of aircraft carriers in service|a total of 22]] (+8 under construction) aircraft carriers in active service: [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Russia]], [[Italy]], [[India]], [[Spain]], [[Brazil]], and [[Thailand]]. In addition the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] possesses the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aircraft carrier [[Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag|''Varyag'']], but most naval analysts believe that they have no intention to operate it, but instead are using ''Varyag'' to learn about carrier operations for future Chinese aircraft carriers. The [[United States]], [[Brazil]], [[South Korea]], [[United Kingdom]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]] and [[France]] also operate vessels capable of carrying and operating multiple helicopters.

[[Image:Gaule96.jpg|thumb|left|[[France]]'s ''[[Charles de Gaulle (R 91)|Charles de Gaulle]]'' (R-91), currently the only nuclear powered aircraft carrier operated by a country other than the [[United States]].]]

Aircraft carriers are generally accompanied by a number of other ships, to provide protection for the relatively unwieldy carrier, to carry supplies, and to provide additional offensive capabilities. This is often termed a battle group or carrier group, sometimes a [[carrier battle group]].

In the early 21st century, worldwide aircraft carriers are capable of carrying about 1250 aircraft.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} US carriers account for over 1000 of these.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} The United Kingdom and France are both undergoing a major expansion in carrier capability, but the United States will still maintain a very large lead.

===Flight deck===
{{main|Flight deck}}

As "runways at sea," modern aircraft carriers have a flat-top deck design that serves as a [[flight deck]] for [[take off|take-off]] and [[landing]] of aircraft. Aircraft take off to the front, into the wind, and land from the rear. Carriers steam at speed, for example up to {{nowrap|35 [[knot (nautical)|knots]]}} ({{nowrap|65 km/h}}), into the wind during take-off in order to increase the [[apparent wind]] speed over the deck, thereby reducing the speed of the aircraft relative to the ship. On some ships, a steam-powered [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] is used to propel the aircraft forward, assisting the power of its engines and allowing it to take off in a shorter distance than would otherwise be required. On other carriers, aircraft do not require assistance for take off — the requirement for assistance relates to aircraft design and performance. Conversely, when landing on a carrier, conventional aircraft rely upon a [[tailhook]] that catches on [[arrestor wires]] stretched across the deck to bring them to a stop in a shorter distance than normal. Other aircraft — [[helicopter]]s and [[V/STOL]] (Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing) designs — utilize their hover capability to land vertically and so require no assistance in speed reduction upon landing.

[[Image:DN-SD-07-00030.jpg|thumb|right|Ripples appear along the fuselage of a US Navy [[E-2C Hawkeye]] due to loads from landing on the {{USS|Harry S. Truman|CVN-75|6}}]]

Conventional ("tailhook") aircraft rely upon a [[landing signal officer]] (LSO) to control the plane's landing approach, visually gauging altitude, attitude, and speed, and transmitting that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot. From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as [[Mirror landing aid|mirrors]] provided information on proper [[glide slope]], but LSOs still transmit voice calls to landing pilots by radio.

The flight deck of an aircraft carrier is one of the world's most dangerous places to work. To facilitate working on the flight deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier, the sailors wear colored shirts that designate their responsibilities. White shirts are responsible for safety, red shirts handle munitions, purple shirts (grapes) handle jet fuel, green shirts handle the catapult and arresting gear, etc.  

Yellow shirts are responsible for directing aircraft.  Key personnel involved in the flight deck include the Shooters, the Handler, and the Air Boss.  Shooters are pilots or [[Naval Flight Officer]]s and are responsible for launching aircraft. The Handler works just inside the island from the flight deck and is responsible for the movement of aircraft before launching and after landing. The Air Boss (usually a commander) occupies the top bridge (aka the "tower" or Primary Flight Control) and has the overall responsibility for controlling takeoffs, landings, "those aircraft in the air near the ship, and the movement of planes on the flight deck, which itself resembles a well-choreographed ballet."<ref>http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/powerhouse.asp</ref>  The captain of the ship spends most of his time one level below Primary on the Navigation Bridge.  Below the Navigation Bridge is the Flag Bridge, designated for the embarked admiral and his staff.

Since the early 1950s it has been common to direct the landing recovery area off to port at an angle to the line of the ship. The primary function of the angled deck landing area is to allow aircraft that miss the arresting wires, referred to as a "bolter", to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked on the forward parts of the deck. The angled deck also allows launching of aircraft at the same time as others land. 

[[Image:USS Harry S Truman (CVN-75) Flight Deck.JPG|thumb|left|[[F/A-18 Hornet]]s on the [[flight deck]] of the [[Nimitz class carrier|''Nimitz''-class]] [[supercarrier]] {{USS|Harry S. Truman|CVN-75|2}}]]

The above deck areas of the warship (the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], flight [[control tower]], and so on) are concentrated to the [[starboard]] side of the deck in a relatively small area called an "island".  Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island and such a configuration has not been seen in a fleet sized carrier. The "flush deck" configuration proved to have very significant drawbacks, complicating navigation, air traffic control and numerous other factors.

A more recent configuration, used by the British [[Royal Navy]], has a ski-jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was developed to help launch [[VTOL]] (or [[STOVL]]) aircraft (aircraft that are able to take off and land with little or no forward movement) such as the [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]]. Although the aircraft are capable of flying vertically off the deck, using the ramp is more fuel efficient. As catapults and arrestor cables are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for equipment. The disadvantage of the ski-jump — and the reason this configuration has not appeared on American supercarriers — is the penalty that it exacts on aircraft size, payload and fuel load (and thus range): Large, slow planes such as the [[E-2 Hawkeye]] and heavily-laden strike fighters like the [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]] cannot use a ski-jump because their high weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck, or catapult assistance.

==Future aircraft carriers==
{{Future ship|section}}

Several nations which currently possess aircraft carriers are in the process of planning new classes to replace current ones. The world's navies still generally see the aircraft carrier as the main future capital ship, with developments such as the [[arsenal ship]], which have been promoted as an alternative, seen as too limited in terms of flexibility.

Military experts such as [[John Keegan]]<ref>[http://www.combatreform2.com/submarineaircraftcarriers.htm Submarine aircraft carriers] (uneven-quality private website, but has third-party citations in support)</ref> have noted that in any future naval conflict between reasonably evenly matched powers, all surface ships - including aircraft carriers - would be at extreme and disproportionate risk, mainly due to the advanced capabilities of satellite reconnaissance and anti-ship missiles. Contrary to the thrust of most current naval spending, Keegan therefore postulates that eventually, most navies will move to [[submarine]]s as their main fighting ships, including in roles where submarines play only a minor or no role at the moment.

;Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy

In June 2005, reports from boxun.com that the [[People's Republic of China]] would build a US$ 362 million aircraft carrier with a displacement of 78,000&nbsp;tonnes were denied by Chinese defence official ''Zhang Guangqin''.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/ra/news/stories/s1394667.htm Radio Australia report, ''China denies reports of aircraft carrier project'']</ref> 

China bought the unfinished [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aircraft carrier ''[[Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag|Varyag]]'' in 2001 from Ukraine, supposedly to be turned into a floating casino. Pictures taken while in port suggest this plan has been abandoned and show that work is being carried out to maintain its military function. There is no conclusive evidence as to what role it would play in the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|Chinese Navy]].

;French Navy

The [[French Navy]] had set in motion plans for a [[Future French aircraft carrier|second CTOL aircraft carrier]], to supplement ''[[Charles de Gaulle (R 91)|Charles de Gaulle]]''. The design was to be much larger, in the range of 65-74,000 tonnes, and would not have been nuclear-powered like Charles de Gaulle. There were plans to buy the third carrier of the current [[Royal Navy CVF programme|Royal Navy design]] for [[CATOBAR]] operations. (The [[Thales Group|Thales]]/[[BAE Systems]] design for the Royal Navy is for a STOVL carrier which is reconfigurable to CATOBAR operations.)

On [[21 June]] [[2008]], French President [[Nicholas Sarkozy]] decided to pull out of the Franco-British project. Sarkozy stated that a final decision on the future of French participation in the Project would be taken in 2011 or 2012. British plans for two aircraft carriers go ahead as planned despite the French withdrawal.<ref>[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article4183255.ece President Sarkozy ditches Franco-British carrier project]</ref>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Project 71 Aircraft carrier.gif|thumb|left|An artist's rendering of the [[Vikrant class aircraft carrier]] set to join the Indian Navy in 2012. {{deletable image-caption}}]] -->

[[India]] started the construction of a 37,500&nbsp;tonne, 252&nbsp;meter-long [[Vikrant class aircraft carrier|''Vikrant'' class aircraft carrier]] in April 2005. The new carrier will cost US$762 million and will operate [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG 29K 'Fulcrum']], Naval [[HAL Tejas]] and Sea Harrier aircraft along with the Indian-made helicopter [[HAL Dhruv]]. The ship will be powered by four turbine engines and will have a range of 7,500&nbsp;nautical miles (14,000&nbsp;km), carrying 160 officers, 1400 sailors, and 30 aircraft. The carrier is being constructed by a state-run shipyard in Cochin.

In 2004, India bought the [[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov|''Admiral Gorshkov'']] from [[Russia]] for US$1.5 billion. It is most likely to be named the [[INS Vikramaditya|INS ''Vikramaditya'']], and was expected to join the [[Indian Navy]] in 2008 after a refit.<ref>[http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/12/content_433517.htm Article on India's indigenously built aircraft carrier.]</ref> However, delays in the refit were announced in the middle of July 2007. Eduard Borisov, an acting director of the [[Sevmash]] plant responsible for the refit, stated that production capabilities of the plant were overestimated for the current funding level, and the refit will not be completed until 2011<ref>[http://www.finiz.ru/economic/article1243725 Izvestia.ru (in Russian)]</ref> with a total cost of $4.5 billion.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} Vladimir Pastuhov, Sevmash director, had to step down, along with two other top managers of large defence contractors, in the largest scandal in the Russian defence industry in recent years.<ref>[http://www.lenta.ru/articles/2007/08/01/sevmash/ Lenta.Ru article on the scandal (in Russian)]</ref>

;Italian Navy

The construction of the conventionally powered ''[[Marina Militare]]'' STOVL aircraft carrier [[Cavour (550)|''Cavour'']] began in 2001. The ship is being built by [[Fincantieri]] of Italy. After much delay, ''Cavour'' is expected to enter service in 2009 to complement the Marina Militare aircraft carrier [[Giuseppe Garibaldi (551)|''Giuseppe Garibaldi'']].

;Royal Navy (United Kingdom)

The [[Royal Navy]] has signed a deal to build two new larger STOVL aircraft carriers (the [[Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier|''Queen Elizabeth'' class]]) to replace the three [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible'' class]] carriers. These two ships are to be named {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|CVF|6}} and {{HMS|Prince of Wales|CVF|6}}.<ref name="pike_cvf">"[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/cvf.htm ''Queen Elizabeth'' class Future Aircraft Carrier CVF (002)]." Pike, J. [[GlobalSecurity.org]].</ref><ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7486683.stm</ref> They will be able to operate up to 48 aircraft and will have a displacement of around 65,000&nbsp;tonnes. The two ships are due to enter service in 2014 and 2016 respectively. Their primary aircraft complement will be made up of [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35B Lightning II]]s, and their ship's company will number around 1000.

The two ships will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy. Initially to be configured for STOVL operations, the carriers are to be adaptable to STOBAR or CATOBAR configurations to allow any type of future generation of aircraft to operate from them.

;Russian Navy

[[Russian Navy]] Commander-in-Chief [[Admiral]] [[Vladimir Masorin]] officially stated on June 23, 2007, that the Navy is currently considering the specifications of a new nuclear aircraft carrier design,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kommersant.com/p-10807/r_500/aircraft_carrier/ |title=Russia to Build New Aircraft Carrier |accessdate= 2007-06-23}}</ref><ref name="lenta 6/23">[http://www.lenta.ru/news/2007/06/23/aircarrier/ Lenta.Ru newssite][http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=http://www.lenta.ru/news/2007/06/23/aircarrier/&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.lenta.ru/news/2007/06/23/aircarrier/%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG Google translation - English 06/23/2007]</ref> for the class that was first announced about a month earlier. Production of the carriers is believed to start around 2010 at the Zvezdochka plant in [[Severodvinsk]], where a large [[drydock]], capable of launching vessels with more than 100,000 ton displacement, is now being built.<ref name="lenta 07/04>[http://lenta.ru/news/2006/07/04/carrier/ Lenta.Ru newssite] [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=http://lenta.ru/news/2006/07/04/carrier/&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://lenta.ru/news/2006/07/04/carrier/%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG Google translation - English 07/04/2006]</ref>

In his statement, Admiral Masorin stated that the general dimensions of the project have already been determined. The projected carrier is to have nuclear propulsion, to displace about 50,000 tons and to carry an air wing of 30-50 air superiority aircraft and helicopters, which makes her roughly comparable with the French [[Charles de Gaulle (R 91)|''Charles de Gaulle'']] carrier. "The giants that the US Navy builds, those that carry 100-130 aircraft, we won't build anything like that", said [[Admiral]] [[Vladimir Masorin|Masorin]].<ref name="lenta 6/23"/> The planned specifications reflect the role, traditional in the [[Russian Navy]], of the aircraft carrier as an air support platform for [[guided missile cruiser]]s and [[submarine]]s.

The Russian naval establishment had long agreed that since the decommissioning of the [[Kiev class aircraft carrier|''Kiev'' class carrier]]s the only operational carrier, the ''[[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|Admiral Kuznetsov]]'', was insufficient, and that three or four carriers were necessary to meet the Navy's air support requirements.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} However financial and organisational turmoil in the 1990s made even the maintenance of the ''Admiral Kuznetsov'' a difficult undertaking. The improvement in [[Russia]]'s economic situation after the year 2000 has allowed a major increase in defence spending. Admiral [[Vladimir Vysotsky (Admiral)|Vladimir Vysotsky]] announced on [[Navy Day]] 2008 that Russia plans to build 5 or 6 carriers of the new design for deployment in the [[Russian Northern Fleet|Northern]] and [[Pacific Ocean Fleet (Russia)|Pacific]] fleets, starting around 2012-2013.<ref>RIA Novosti. 2008, 27 July. [http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080727/115004797.html "Russia to have 5-6 aircraft carriers in Northern, Pacific Fleets"].</ref> The new carrier groups are planned to be at full strength around 2050-2060.<ref>RIA Novosti. 2008, 4 April. [http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080404/103745057.html "Russia to have 5-6 aircraft carriers by 2060 - Navy commander"].</ref>

;Spanish Navy

The project for the 231&nbsp;meter-long, 27,000-30,000-tonne [[Juan Carlos I (BPE ship)|''Juan Carlos I'']] for the [[Spanish Navy]] was approved in 2003, and its construction started in August 2005, with the shipbuilding firm [[Navantia]] in charge of the project. The ''Juan Carlos I'' is a vessel designed to operate both as [[amphibious assault ship]] vessel and as VSTOL aircraft carrier, depending on the mission assigned. The design was made keeping in mind the low-intensity conflicts in which the Spanish Navy is likely to be involved in the future. When it is configured to operate as VSTOL aircraft carrier, the operating range will be about 27,000&nbsp;tonnes, and it will operate a maximum of 30 [[AV-8B Harrier II|AV-8B+ Matadors]], [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] or a mixed force of both aircraft. The ship is provided with a ski-jump and a three-dimensional radar based combat system, and she will be the second operating aircraft carrier of the Spanish navy after [[Spanish aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias|''Príncipe de Asturias'']]. Australia is also purchasing two of these vessels, the [[Canberra class Landing Helicopter Dock|''Canberra'' class]] large amphibious ships, for the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. At this time the unfinished Australian ships are not planned to operate VTOL aircraft, however against the apparent wishes of the [[Royal Australian Navy]]<ref>http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23426308-662,00.html</ref>.

<!-- While the speculation on the next possible Spanish Navy carrier is very interesting, Wikipedia requires verifiable, reliable sources in order to add such info to articles.

;US Navy
[[Image:USS Gerald R. Ford.jpg|thumb|Virtual depiction of the new US Navy ''Gerald R. Ford-Class'' carrier]]

The current US Fleet of [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz'' class]] carriers are to be followed into service (and in some cases replaced) by the [[Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carrier|''Gerald R. Ford'' (CVN-78) class]]. It is expected that the ships will be larger than the {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68|2}}, and will also be designed to be less detectable by radar. The United States Navy is also looking to make these new carriers more automated in an effort to reduce the amount of funding required to maintain and operate its [[supercarrier]]s.

With the decommissioning of the {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|6}} in March, 2007, the US fleet has been reduced to 11 supercarriers; thus creating major discussions between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Congress. The House Armed Services Seapower subcommittee on [[July 24]], [[2007]] is recommending 7, maybe 8 new carriers (1 every 4 years). However, the debate is deepened over budgeting for the $12-14.5 billion (plus $12 billion for development and research) for the ''Gerald Ford''-class carrier (estimated service 2015). And, comparing these expenditures for a smaller $2 billion 45,000-ton class big-deck amphibious assault ships for squadrons of the new [[F-35 Lightning II#F-35B|F-35Bs]].<ref name="AFAmag">{{cite journal  | last = Kreisher  | first = Otto| title = Seven New Carriers(Maybe)| journal = AIR FORCE MAGAZINE, Journal of the Air Force Association | volume = 90 | issue = 10| pages = pp.68–71 | month = October | year = 2007 | publisher = Air Force Association | url = http://www.afa.org/magazine/oct2007/ | id = {{ISSN|0730-6784}} | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}</ref>
