'''''Lost''''' is an American [[Serial (radio and television)|serial drama]] [[television program|television series]]. It follows the lives of [[plane crash]] survivors on a mysterious tropical [[island]], after a commercial [[Oceanic Flight 815|passenger jet]] flying between Sydney, Australia and Los Angeles, United States crashes somewhere in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Each episode typically features a primary storyline on the island as well as a secondary storyline from [[Flashback (literary technique)|another point]] in a character's life. The series was created by [[Damon Lindelof]], [[J. J. Abrams]] and [[Jeffrey Lieber]], and is filmed primarily on location in [[Oahu, Hawaii]].<ref name="ABC About ''Lost''">[http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index?pn=about ''Lost'': About the Show - ABC.com]</ref> [[Pilot (Lost)|The pilot episode]] was first broadcast on September 22, 2004.<ref name = "Pilot: Part 1">{{cite episode | title = Pilot: Part 1 | episodelink = Pilot (Lost) | series = Lost | serieslink = Lost (TV series) | credits = [[J.

In May 2007, it was announced that ''Lost'' would continue for its fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons, concluding with the 117th produced episode in May 2010. These three final seasons were planned to consist of 16 episodes each, running weekly in the spring uninterrupted by repeats. However, due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], the fourth season was shortened to 14 episodes. To compensate, seasons five and six will each consist of seventeen episodes.<ref name=17ep>[http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TV-Show-Blog/Tv-Previews/Lost-Scads-Scoopy/800037760 Lost Finale Spoilers, Scoops and More News]" ''[[TV Guide]]''.

==Production==
===Conception===
The series began [[Filmmaking#Development|development]] in January 2004, when [[Lloyd Braun (media executive)|Lloyd Braun]], head of ABC at the time, ordered an initial script from [[Spelling Television]] based on his concept of a cross between the novel ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', the movie ''[[Cast Away]]'', the television series ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', and the popular reality show ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]''. Gadi Pollack notes that some of "the influences of ''Lost'' came from...the game ''[[Myst]]''."<ref>"''Lost'': Getting Your Fix," ''Game Informer'' 177 (January 2008): 79.</ref>  [[Jeffrey Lieber]] was hired and wrote ''Nowhere'', based on his pitch to write the [[television pilot|pilot]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cast Away| last=Bernstein|first=David|url=http://chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2007/Cast-Away/index.php?cp=2&si=1#artanc| publisher=[[Chicago (magazine)|''Chicago'' magazine]]|date=August 2007}}</ref> Unhappy with the result and a subsequent rewrite, Braun contacted [[J. J. Abrams]], who had a deal with Touchstone Television (now [[ABC Studios]]), and was also the creator of the TV series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', to write a new pilot script.  Although initially hesitant, Abrams warmed up to the idea on the condition that the series would have a [[supernatural]] angle to it, and collaborated with [[Damon Lindelof]] to create the series' style and characters.<ref name="DT081405"> {{cite news| last=Craig| first=Olga| title=The man who discovered ''Lost'' — and found himself out of a job| url=http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/08/14/wlost14.xml| publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=2005-08-14}}</ref> Together, Abrams and Lindelof also created a series "[[Bible (writing)|bible]]", and conceived and detailed the major [[Mythology|mythological]] ideas and plot points for an ideal five to six season run for the show.<ref> {{cite web| last=Jensen| first=Jeff| title=When Stephen King met the ''Lost'' boys...| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1562722,00.html| publisher=EW.com|accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref><ref>Burk, Bryan, ''Lost Season 1 DVD'' (extras), [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]], September 6, 2005.</ref>  The development of the show was constrained by tight deadlines, as it had been commissioned late in the 2004 season's development cycle.

''Lost'''s two-part pilot episode was the most expensive in the network's history, reportedly costing between [[United States dollar|US $]]10 and US $14 million,<ref>{{cite news|title=New series gives Hawaii 3 TV shows in production| last=Ryan|first=Tim|url =http://starbulletin.com/2004/05/17/news/story7.html| publisher=''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]''|date=2004-05-17}}</ref> compared to the average cost of an hour-long pilot in 2005 of US $4 million.<ref name="EIDC050405">{{cite press release|url =http://www.eidc.com/EIDC_Press_Release_050405.pdf#search=%22production%20cost%20of%20a%20television%20TV%20pilot%22|publisher= Entertainment Industry Development Corporation |title=EIDC Issues First Overview of Pilot Production Activity and Economic Impact|date=2005-05-04|accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref> The series, which debuted on September 22, 2004, became one of the biggest critical and commercial successes of the [[2004 in television|2004 television season]].

===Episode format===
Episodes have a distinct structure: following a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative, each show begins with a [[cold open]]. Often a close up of a character's eye will follow. At a dramatic juncture, the screen cuts to black and the title [[graphic]], slightly out-of-focus, glides towards the viewer accompanied by an ominous, discordant sound. The [[opening credits]] generally appear alphabetically by last name over the scenes that immediately follow. While there is a continuous [[story arc]], each episode relates events concurrently with off-island [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s and later, [[flashforward]]s, centered on a particular character. The majority of episodes end with a suspenseful [[twist ending|twist]] or [[cliffhanger]], revealed just seconds before a [[smash cut]] to black and the title graphic. Others, following a plot resolution, will finish with a reflective closing scene that precedes a simple [[fade (lighting)|fade to black]], and in particularly tragic or heart-felt closing scenes, the booming noise that accompanies the title graphic will be silenced, amplifying the impact of the event.

===Music===
{{main|List of music featured on Lost}}
''Lost'' features an [[incidental music|orchestral score]] performed by the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra]] and composed by [[Michael Giacchino]], incorporating many recurring themes for subjects such as events, locations and characters, something uncommon in television music. Giacchino achieved some of the sounds for the score using unusual instruments, such as striking suspended pieces of the plane's [[fuselage]].<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/podcasts/101323.html Official ''Lost'' Podcast] January 9, 2006.</ref> On March 21, 2006, the record label [[Varèse Sarabande]] released the original television [[soundtrack]] for ''Lost'''s first season.<ref name="Soundtrack 1">[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EHSVDM ''Lost'': Season 1 Original Soundtrack- Amazon.com]</ref> The soundtrack included select full-length versions of the most popular themes of the season and the main title, which was composed by series creator J.J. Abrams.<ref name="Soundtrack 1"/> Varèse Sarabande released a soundtrack featuring music from the second season of ''Lost'' on October 3, 2006.<ref name="Soundtrack 2">[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I2IQ9M ''Lost'': Season 2 Original Soundtrack- Amazon.com]</ref> A soundtrack  for the third season was released on May 6, 2008.

Pop culture songs have been used sparingly in the series, given the mainly orchestral score. When such songs are featured, they usually originate from a [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|diegetic]] source. Examples are the various songs played on Hurley's portable CD player throughout the first season (until its batteries died in the episode "[[...In Translation]]"), which featured [[Joe Purdy|Joe Purdy's]] "Wash Away", or the use of the record player in the second season, which included [[Cass Elliot]]'s "[[Make Your Own Kind of Music (song)|Make Your Own Kind of Music]]" and [[Petula Clark]]'s "[[Downtown (song)|Downtown]]" in the second and third season premieres respectively. In two episodes, Charlie is shown on a street corner playing guitar and singing the [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] song "[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]". In the third season's finale, Jack is driving down the street listening to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "Scentless Apprentice," right before he arrives to the Hoffs/Drawlar Funeral Parlor, and in the parallel scene in the fourth season's finale he arrives listening to "[[Gouge Away]]" by [[Pixies]]. The third season also used [[Three Dog Night]]'s [[Shambala (song)|Shambala]] on two occasions in the van. The only two pop songs that have ever been used without a source (i.e. non-[[diegetic]]) are [[Ann-Margret]]'s "Slowly," in the episode "[[I Do (Lost)|I Do]]" and "I Shall Not Walk Alone", written by [[Ben Harper]], and covered by [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]] in the episode "[[Confidence Man (Lost)|Confidence Man]]". Alternate music is used in several international broadcasts. For instance, in the [[Japan]]ese broadcast of ''Lost'', the [[Theme music|theme song]] for season one is "Here I Am" by [[Chemistry (band)|Chemistry]], the [[Theme music|theme song]] for season two is "[[Losin']]" by [[Yuna Ito]], and the [[Theme music|theme song]] for season three is "Fire Walk With Me" by [[Fantômas (band)|Fantômas]].

===Filming locations===
[[Image:LOSTDock.jpg|right|thumb|A local dock in Hawaii, as seen in "[[Live Together, Die Alone]]".]]
''Lost'' is filmed on [[Panavision]] [[35 mm]] cameras almost entirely on the Hawaiian island of [[Oahu]]. The original island scenes for the pilot were filmed at [[Mokulē'ia, Hawai'i|Mokulē'ia]] Beach, near the northwest tip of the island. Later beach scenes take place in secluded spots of the famous [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]]. Cave scenes in the first season were filmed on a [[sound stage]] built at a [[Xerox]] parts warehouse, which had been empty since an [[Xerox murders|employee mass shooting]] took place there in 1999.<ref>{{cite news| last=Veitch| first=Kristin| title=''Lost'' Secrets Found! |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20041208152612/http://www.eonline.com/Gossip/Kristin/Archive2004/041016.html| publisher=[[E!

Various urban areas in and around [[Honolulu]] are used as stand-ins for locations around the world, including [[California]], [[New York]], [[Iowa]], [[Miami]], [[South Korea]], [[Iraq]], [[Nigeria]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Paris]], [[Thailand]], [[Berlin]] and [[Australia]]. For example, scenes set in a [[Sydney Airport]] were filmed at the [[Hawaii Convention Center]], while a [[World War II]]-era bunker was used as an [[Iraqi Republican Guard]] installation.  Also, scenes set in Germany during the winter were also filmed in a relatively regular Hawaiian neighborhood, with just crushed ice scattered everywhere to create snow and German automobile signs on the street were used.  <ref>{{cite news|last=Godvin|first=Tara|title=Oahu plays the world|publisher=''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]''|url =http://starbulletin.com/2005/05/25/features/story4.html|date=2005-05-25}}</ref> Extensive archives of filming locations are tracked at a repository at the [http://www.lostvirtualtour.com/ ''Lost'' Virtual Tour].

===Online distribution===
In addition to traditional terrestrial and [[satellite broadcasting]], ''Lost'' has been at the forefront of new television distribution methods. It was one of the first series issued through [[Apple Computer|Apple's]] [[iTunes Store]] service for playback on an [[iPod]] or within the [[iTunes]] software. Since October 2005, new episodes, without commercials, have been available for download the day after they air on ABC, for American audiences. On August 29, 2007 Lost became one of the first TV programs available for download in the UK store. Since the airing of Season 4 in the UK, episodes of Lost are available the Monday after the Sunday they air on Sky One.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=Apple|date=2007-08-29|url =http://www.apple.com/uk/pr/2007/08/290808_itunes_tvshows.html|title=Apple Announces Hit Television Programming Now Available on the iTunes Store in the UK}}</ref> "Lost" was also among the first TV shows on the [[Germany|German]] [[iTunes]] store.<ref>{{cite article|publisher=heise online|date=2008-04-02|url =http://www.heise.de/newsticker/suche/ergebnis?rm=result;words=Apple%20TV%20Serien;q=apple%20tv-serien;url=/newsticker/meldung/105856/|title=iTunes Deutschland verkauft TV-Serien}}</ref>

In April 2006, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] announced that ''Lost'' would be available for free online in streaming format, with advertising, on ABC's website, as part of a two-month experiment of future distribution strategies. The trial, which ran from May to June 2006, caused a stir among network affiliates who were afraid of being cut out of advertising revenue. The streaming of ''Lost'' episodes direct from ABC's website was only available to viewers in the United States due to international licensing agreements.<ref>{{cite news| first=Joshua| last=Chaffin| coauthor= Aline van Duyn|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/341d65ba-c894-11da-b642-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=f5f96136-709f-11da-89d3-0000779e2340,print=yes.html | title=Disney's ABC to offer TV shows free on web | publisher=''Financial Times''| date=2006-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|publisher=DisneyABC TV|date=2006-04-10|url =http://www.disneyabctv.com/datvg_press/dispDNR.html?id=041006_06|title=Disney-ABC Television Group takes ABC Primetime Online}}</ref> As of May 2008, full episodes from Seasons 1–4 are available as [[High-definition video|high-definition]] streaming video on the ABC website, but only to users in the US who use Microsoft or Apple operating systems. New episodes are available the day after original primetime airing.  Viewers are required to view five or six 30-second advertising spots, equally dispersed throughout the episode.  These spots appear as an overlay graphic ad with smaller video ad and usually feature high-profile advertisers. 

Episodes from both [[Lost (season 1)|season one]] and [[Lost (season 2)|season two]] were available on the UK's [[Channel 4]]'s website, but have since expired.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/L/lost/vod/index.html ''Lost'' Episodes Online - Channel 4.com]</ref> Both parts of "Pilot" were available to watch for free, and other episodes cost [[Pound sterling|GB£]]0.99 each. Due to licensing agreements, the service was only accessible in the UK. [[Virgin Media]] has made the first three seasons of ''Lost'' available on demand via their TV Choice On Demand function, allowing viewers to watch the first three seasons at any time in high-definition or [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]]. Currently, only Season Two and Three are available. All episodes available on the service are free to Virgin Media subscribers. As of November 25, 2006, Lost episodes were available on Sky's VOD service, [[Sky Anytime]]. Users with the correct Sky Subscription can download recent Lost episodes for free, however, much like Channel 4's 4OD application, they expire. Users without a relevant Sky subscription for Lost can exchange prepaid credit for rental of an episode. Other online distribution sites include: France's [[TF1]] website,<ref>{{cite web|title=TF1 ''Lost'' Episodes Online (French)|url =http://www.tf1vision.com/liste.php?rub=CAT8&fltCode=182&p=53/?trk=1&e=7}}</ref> [[AOL]] Video,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.dailytech.com/ABC+to+Offer+Free+Shows+Online+Via+AOL/article9002c.htm| title =  ABC to Offer Free Shows Online Via AOL| author = Mick, Jason| date = 2007-09-21| publisher = ''DailyTech''}}</ref> [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox Live]] service,<ref>''Microsoft'', "[http://www.xbox.com/en-US/marketplace/media/9601d8e7-462f-4a36-bdbb-3e0d24dc4d16/ Xbox LIVE Marketplace - Lost]." </ref> and [[Hot (Israel)|HOT]] V.O.D. service in Israel.

===DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases===

[[List of Lost episodes|Episode 2]], [[Lost (season 4)|season 4]].  Aired on February 7, 2008.</ref> there are 72 initial survivors (71 humans and one dog) spread across the three sections of the plane crash. The opening season featured 14 regular speaking roles, making it the second largest cast in a currently airing American prime time television show behind ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. While a large cast makes ''Lost'' more expensive to produce, the writers benefit from more flexibility in story decisions. According to series executive producer Bryan Burk, "You can have more interactions between characters and create more diverse characters, more back stories, more love triangles."<ref>{{cite news|title=TV hits maximum occupancy|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|last=Keveney|first=Bill|url =http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-11-08-ensemble-casts_x.htm| date=2005-08-11 }}</ref>

The initial season had 14 major roles getting star [[billing (film)|billing]].  [[Naveen Andrews]] portrayed former [[Iraqi Republican Guard]] [[Sayid Jarrah]].  [[Emilie de Ravin]] played the pregnant Australian [[Claire Littleton]].  [[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]] acted as the troubled surgeon and protagonist [[Jack Shephard]].  [[Jorge Garcia]] portrayed [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes]], an unlucky lottery winner.  [[Maggie Grace]] played [[Shannon Rutherford]], a former dance teacher.  [[Josh Holloway]] acted as con man [[James "Sawyer" Ford]].  [[Yunjin Kim]] played [[Sun-Hwa Kwon]], the daughter of a powerful Korean businessman and mobster, with [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as her husband [[Jin-Soo Kwon]].  [[Evangeline Lilly]] portrayed fugitive [[Kate Austen]].  [[Dominic Monaghan]] acted as ex-rock star drug addict [[Charlie Pace]].  [[Terry O'Quinn]] played the mysterious [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]].  [[Harold Perrineau]] portrayed construction worker [[Michael Dawson (Lost)|Michael Dawson]], while child actor [[Malcolm David Kelley]] acted as his young son, [[Walt Lloyd]].  [[Ian Somerhalder]] played [[Boone Carlyle]], chief operating officer of his mother's wedding business and step brother of Shannon.
 
During the first two seasons, some characters were written out to make room for new characters with new stories.<ref>{{cite news|url =http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-09-13-lost_x.htm| publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|last= Keck|first=William |date=2005-09-13|title=''Lost'' in the face of death}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci06prog_lost.shtml|publisher=Comic Con|title=Interview with Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse|quote="Carlton: There will always be new characters that will be joining the cast of Lost.

Walt became a guest star after the events of the first season's finale, making rare appearances throughout season two. Shannon's departure eight episodes into season two made way for newcomers [[Mr. Eko]], a Nigerian Catholic priest and former criminal played by [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]]; [[Ana Lucia Cortez]], an airport security guard and former police officer played by [[Michelle Rodriguez]]; and [[Libby (Lost)|Libby]], a purported clinical psychologist portrayed by [[Cynthia Watros]]. Ana Lucia and Libby were written out of the series toward the end of season two.

In season three, [[Henry Ian Cusick]] received star billing as former Scottish soldier [[Desmond David Hume]], as did [[Michael Emerson]] in the role of [[Ben Linus]] (formerly known as Henry Gale), a high ranking member of the "[[Others (Lost)|Others]]." In addition, three new actors joined the regular cast: [[Elizabeth Mitchell (actress)|Elizabeth Mitchell]], as fertility doctor and "Other" [[Juliet Burke]], and [[Kiele Sanchez]] and [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as background survivor couple [[Nikki and Paulo|Nikki Fernandez]] and [[Nikki and Paulo|Paulo]]. Eko was written out early in the season, and Nikki and Paulo were written out mid-season in their first flashback episode. Charlie was written out in the third season finale.

Numerous supporting characters have been given expansive and recurring appearances in the progressive storyline. [[Danielle Rousseau]] ([[Mira Furlan]]), a French member of an earlier scientific expedition to the island first encountered as a voice recording in the pilot episode, appears throughout the series; she is searching for her daughter, who later turns up in the form of [[Alex (Lost)|Alex Rousseau]] ([[Tania Raymonde]]).  In the second season, married couple [[Rose Henderson]] ([[L. Scott Caldwell]]) and [[Bernard Nadler]] ([[Sam Anderson]]), separated on opposite sides of the island (she with the main characters, he with the tail section survivors) were featured in a flashback episode after being reunited.  Corporate magnate [[Characters of Lost#Charles Widmore|Charles Widmore]] ([[Alan Dale]]) has connections to both Ben and Desmond. Desmond is in love with his daughter [[Characters of Lost#Penelope "Penny" Widmore|Penelope "Penny" Widmore]] ([[Sonya Walger]]). The introduction of the "[[Others (Lost)|Others]]," inhabitants of the island, has featured such characters as [[Tom (Lost)|Tom]] aka Mr. Friendly ([[M. C. Gainey]]), [[Ethan Rom]] ([[William Mapother]]) and [[Characters of Lost#Richard Alpert|Richard Alpert]] ([[Nestor Carbonell]]), all of whom have been shown in both flashbacks and the ongoing story.  Jack's father [[Christian Shephard]] ([[John Terry (actor)|John Terry]]) has appeared in multiple flashbacks of various characters.  In the fourth season, [[Kevin Durand]] plays [[Martin Keamy]] and [[Jeff Fahey]] plays [[Frank Lapidus]], respectively a mercenary and a pilot hired by Widmore to find the island. The team leader was [[Characters of Lost#Naomi Dorrit|Naomi Dorrit]] ([[Marsha Thomason]]), the first person to arrive to the island after the crash of Oceanic 815.

===Casting===
Many of the first season roles were a result of the executive producers' liking of various actors. The main character Jack was originally going to die in the [[Pilot (Lost)|pilot]], and was hoped to be played by [[Michael Keaton]]; however, ABC executives were adamant that Jack live.<ref name="DVD">{{cite video | title = Before They Were Lost | medium = [[Documentary film|Documentary]] | location = ''[[Lost DVD releases|Lost: The Complete First Season]]'' | publisher = [[Buena Vista Distribution|Buena Vista Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>  Before it was decided that Jack would live, Kate was to emerge as the leader of the survivors; she was originally conceived to be more like the character of Rose. [[Dominic Monaghan]] auditioned for the role of Sawyer, who at the time was supposed to be a suit-wearing city con man. The producers enjoyed Monaghan's performance and changed the character of Charlie, originally a middle-aged former rock star, to fit him. [[Jorge Garcia]] also auditioned for Sawyer, and the part of Hurley was written for him. When [[Josh Holloway]] auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked the edge he brought to the character (he reportedly kicked a chair when he forgot his lines and got angry in the audition) and his [[Southern American English|southern accent]], so they changed Sawyer to fit Holloway's acting. [[Yunjin Kim]] auditioned for Kate, but the producers wrote the character of Sun for her and the character of Jin, portrayed by [[Daniel Dae Kim]], to be her husband. Sayid, played by [[Naveen Andrews]], was also not in the original script. Locke and Michael were written with their actors in mind. [[Emilie de Ravin]] who plays Claire was originally cast in what was supposed to be a recurring role.<ref name="DVD" /> In the second season, [[Michael Emerson]] was contracted to play Ben ("Henry Gale") for three episodes. His role was extended to eight episodes because of his acting skills, and eventually for the whole of season three and season four.<ref> {{cite web|url =http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=16663|author=Braun, Kyle|title=Michael Emerson, ''Lost'' Interview|publisher=[[UGO Networks]]|accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref>

== Mythology==
{{main|Mythology of Lost}}
<!--This is a general summary only; the specific references should go to the main Mythology article.-->

In parallel to its character development, episodes of ''Lost'' include a number of mysterious elements that have been ascribed to [[science fiction]] or [[supernatural]] phenomena. The creators of the series refer to these elements as composing the [[mythology]] of the series, and they form the basis of fan speculation.<ref>Benson, Jim. [http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA601539.html "The ''Lost'' Generation: Networks Go Eerie."] ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', May 16, 2005.</ref> Among the show's mythological elements is a "monster" that roams the island; a mysterious group of inhabitants whom the survivors refer to as "The Others"; an organization called the [[DHARMA Initiative]] that has placed several [[DHARMA Initiative stations|research stations]] on the island; a [[Lost numbers|sequence of numbers]] that have made frequent appearances in the lives of the characters in the past, present and future; and personal connections or [[synchronicity]] between the characters, of which they are often unaware.

===Discredited theories===

The ONLY theories to be included in this section are those specifically REFUTED by the show's creators/writers. ALL unsourced theories will be removed, as Original Research. All that is needed is a brief statement of the theory and a link to the verifiable source, indicating who dismissed the theory. -->

At the heart of the series is a complex and cryptic storyline that spawns numerous unresolved questions.<ref>

|publisher=IGN.com|date=2006-11-13}}</ref> Encouraged by ''Lost'''s writers and stars, who often interact with fans online, viewers and TV critics alike have taken to widespread theorizing in an attempt to unravel the mysteries. Theories mainly concern the nature of the island, the origins of the "monster" and the "Others," the meaning of the numbers, and the reasons for both the crash and the survival of some passengers.{{Fact|date=October 2008}} Several of the more common fan theories have been discussed and rejected by the show's creators, the most common being that the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 are dead or in [[purgatory]].

==Recurring elements==
[[Image:Pilot2backgammon.jpg|right|thumb|John Locke holds up the two opposing colors of backgammon stones in the pilot episode.]]

There are several recurring elements and [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] on ''Lost'', which generally have no direct effect on the story itself, but expand the show's literary and philosophical [[subtext]].

The pilot episode garnered 18.6 million viewers, easily winning its 9/8 central timeslot, and giving ABC its strongest [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] since 2000 when ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' was initially aired—beaten only the following month by the premiere of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', "ABC sure could use a breakout drama success, as it hasn't had a real hit since ''[[The Practice]]''. ''Lost'' represents the network's best start for a drama with eighteen to forty-nine year olds since ''[[Once and Again]]'' in 1999, and in total viewers since ''[[Murder One (TV series)|Murder One]]'' in 1995."<ref>{{cite news|first=Rick|last=Kissell|title=ABC, Eye have quite some night|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117910869?categoryid=14&cs=1|publisher=''Variety''|date= 2004-09-25}}</ref>

For its first season, ''Lost'' averaged 16 million viewers, ranking 14th in viewership among [[prime-time]] shows, and 15th among the eighteen to forty-nine year old [[demographic]].<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Its second season fared equally well: again, ''Lost'' ranked 14th in viewership, with an average of 15.5 million viewers. However, it improved its rating with eighteen to forty-nine year olds, ranking 8th.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The second season premiere was even more viewed than the first, pulling in over 23 million viewers and setting a series record.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds24619.html|title=US Ratings: ''Lost'' premiere draws 23 million|first=Neil|last=Wilkes|publisher=Digital Spy (UK)|date=2005-09-23}}</ref> The third season premiere brought in 18.8 million viewers. The seventh episode of the season, back from a three-month hiatus, saw a drop to 14.5 million. Over the course of the spring season, ratings would plunge to as low as 11 million viewers before recovering to near 14 million for the season finale. The ratings drop was partially explained when [[Nielsen Ratings|Nielsen]] released [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] ratings, showing ''Lost'' as the most recorded series on television. However, despite overall ratings losses, ''Lost'' still won its hour in the crucial 18–49 demographic and put out the highest 18–49 numbers in the 10pm time slot ahead of any show on any network that season. The fourth season premiere saw an increase from the previous episode to 16.1 million viewers,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/ratings/e3ia68feb4e2d5900e47c15c857a8015761||source=''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''|date=2008-02-02|title=''Lost'' roars back with Thurs. win}}</ref> though by the eighth episode, viewers had decreased to a series low of 11.461&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.buddytv.com/articles/lost/lost-season-4-suffers-ratings-17888.aspx?pollid=1001379&answer=1005380#poll1001379 buddytv.com]</ref> A survey of twenty countries by ''Informa Telecoms and Media'' in 2006 concluded that ''Lost'' was the second most popular TV show in those countries, after ''[[CSI: Miami]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5231334.stm|date=2006-07-31|title=''CSI'' show 'most popular in world'|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

Fans of ''Lost'' have been able to explore ABC-produced tie-in websites, tie-in novels, an official forum sponsored by the creative team behind ''Lost'' ("The Fuselage"), "[[mobisode]]s," podcasts by the producers, an official magazine, and an [[alternate reality game]] (ARG) "[[The Lost Experience]]."<ref name="StPetersburg20060111" /><ref>{{cite news|url =http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_30/b3994072.htm| title=Network Finds Marketing Paradise with ''Lost''|first=Tom|last=Lowry| date=2006-07-24| publisher=''[[BusinessWeek]]'' Online|accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref> An official fanclub was launched in the summer of 2005 through Creation Entertainment.<ref name="ABCpress20050512"/>

Also, ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'', a ''[[Machinima]]'' ''[[Comic science fiction]]'' seemed to have poked fun at it in (one of) the ending(s) to the series, episode 100. The makers of Red vs. Blue also poked fun at the Lost intro in an episode of [[The Strangerhood]]. Lost was also featured as an easter egg in [[Valve Corporation]]'s videogame, ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]''. Similarly the ''Lost'' numbers 4, 8, 15 and 16 can be seen on the loading screen for the video game ''[[Skate (video game)|Skate.]]'' [[Comic book]]s such as ''[[Catwoman]]'' and ''[[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]''; daily strips ''[[Monty (comic strip)|Monty]]'' and ''[[Over the Hedge]]''; web comics ''[[Piled Higher and Deeper]]''<ref>[http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=766 ''Piled Higher and Deeper'': Previously, on ''Lost''] September 27, 2006.</ref> and ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]''<ref> [http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/11/01 ''Penny Arcade'': Ba Dum Bum Psh] November 1, 2006.</ref> and humor magazine ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' have all incorporated ''Lost'' references. Similarly, several rock bands have published songs whose themes and titles were derived from the series, such as [[Moneen]] ("Don't Ever Tell Locke What He Can't Do"), [[Senses Fail]] ("Lost And Found" and "All The Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues"), and [[Gatsbys American Dream]] ("You All Everybody" and "Station 5: The Pearl").

After the episode "[[Numbers (Lost)|Numbers]]" aired on March 2, 2005, numerous people used the eponymous figures ([[Mythology of Lost#The Numbers|4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42]]) as lottery entries. According to the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', within three days, the numbers were tried over 500 times by local players.<ref>{{cite news

==Other media==
The characters and setting of ''Lost'' have appeared in several official [[tie-in]]s outside of the television broadcast, including in print, on the Internet, and in short videos for mobile phones. Three [[novelization]]s have been released by [[Hyperion Books]], a publisher owned by [[Disney]], ABC's parent company. They are ''Endangered Species'' (ISBN 0-7868-9090-8) and ''Secret Identity'' (ISBN 0-7868-9091-6) both by Cathy Hapka and ''Signs of Life'' (ISBN 0-7868-9092-4) by Frank Thompson. Additionally, Hyperion published a [[metafictional]] book titled ''Bad Twin'' (ISBN 1-4013-0276-9), written by Laurence Shames,<ref>{{cite news | last=Zeitchik | first=Steven | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117945504?categoryId=14&cs=1 | title=Inside Move: It's a Shames | publisher=''[[Daily Variety]]'' | date=2006-06-18 | accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref> and credited to fictitious author "[[Gary Troup (Lost)|Gary Troup]]," who was claimed to be a passenger on Oceanic Flight 815 by ABC's marketing department.

Several unofficial books relating to the show have also been published. ''Finding Lost: The Unofficial Guide'' (ISBN 1-55022-743-2) by Nikki Stafford and published by [[ECW Press]] is a book detailing the show for fans and those new to the show. ''What Can Be Found in LOST?'' (ISBN 0-7369-2121-4) by John Ankerberg and Dillon Burrough, published by Harvest House is the first book dedicated to an investigation of the spiritual themes of the series from a Christian perspective. ''Living Lost: Why We're All Stuck on the Island'' (ISBN 1891053027) by J. Wood,<ref>[http://www.gcpress.com/lost/ Wood, J. ''Living Lost: Why We're All Stuck on the Island''. GCPress.com.]</ref> published by the Garett County Press, is the first work of cultural criticism based on the series. The book explores the show's strange engagement with the contemporary experiences of war, (mis)information, and terrorism, and argues that the audience functions as a character in the narrative. The author also writes a blog column<ref>[http://www.powells.com/blog/?author=104 ''Lost'' blog by J. Wood – Powells.com]</ref> during the second part of the third season for [[Powell's Books]]. Each post discusses the previous episode's literary, historical, philosophical and narrative connections.

The show's networks and producers have made extensive use of the Internet in expanding the background of the story. For example, during the first season, a fictional diary by an unseen survivor called "Janelle Granger" was presented on the ABC web site for the series. Likewise, a tie-in website about the fictional [[Oceanic Airlines]] appeared during the first season, which included several [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter eggs]] and clues about the show. Another tie-in website was launched after the airing of "[[Episodes of Lost (season 2)#Orientation|Orientation]]" about the [[Hanso Foundation]]. In the UK, the interactive back-stories of several characters are included in "Lost Untold," a section of [[Channel 4]]'s ''Lost'' website. Similarly, since November 2005, ABC has produced an official [[podcast]], hosted by series writers and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. The podcast typically features a discussion about the weekly episode, interviews with cast members and questions from viewers.<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index?pn=podcast ''Lost'': Podcasts – ABC.com]</ref> [[Sky One]] also hosts a podcast presented by [[Iain Lee]] on their website, which analyzes each episode after it airs in the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.skyoneonline.co.uk/lost/podcasts.html ''Lost'': Podcasts – SkyOneOnline.co.uk]</ref>

The foray into the online realm culminated in the ''[[Lost Experience]]'', an Internet-based [[alternate reality game]] produced by Channel 7 (Australia), ABC (America) and Channel Four (UK), which began in early May 2006. The game presents a five-phase parallel storyline, primarily involving the [[Hanso Foundation]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070220211850/http://www.disneyabctv.com/datvg_press/dispDNR.html?id=072506_12 | title=Global interactive phenomenon, Lost Experience, to reveal meaning behind mysterious numbers on international hit TV show ''Lost'' | publisher=ABC Press Release ([[Internet Archive]]) | date=2006-07-25 | accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref>

Short mini-episodes ("[[mobisode]]s") called the ''Lost Video Diaries'' were originally scheduled for viewing by [[Verizon Wireless]] subscribers via its V-Cast system, but were delayed by contract disputes.<ref>{{cite news | first=Andrew and Jesse Hiestand | last=Wallenstein | title=ABC, unions reach deal on cell phone TV shows | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=2006-04-25 | accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061030135819/http://www.disneyabctv.com/datvg_press/dispDNR.html?id=042406_14 | title=Disney-ABC Television Group's Touchstone Television Finalizes Agreements to Partner with Guilds on "''Lost'' Video Diaries," Original Mini-Episodes Inspired by the Emmy Award-Winning Series for Mobile Distribution | publisher=ABC Press Release ([[Internet Archive]]) |date=2006-04-24 | accessdate=2006-10-30}}</ref> The mobisodes were renamed ''[[Lost: Missing Pieces]]'' and aired from November 7, 2007 to January 28, 2008.

===Licensed merchandise===

A video game, ''[[Lost: Via Domus]]'', has been released, developed by [[Ubisoft]], for [[game consoles]] and home computers,<ref>[http://www.ubisoftgroup.com/index.php?p=59&art_id=60&vars=Y29tX2lkPTMyNA%3D%3D Ubisoft and Touchstone team up to create ''Lost'' video game."] Ubisoftgroup.com, May 22, 2006.
