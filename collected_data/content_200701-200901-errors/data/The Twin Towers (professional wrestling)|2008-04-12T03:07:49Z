The '''Twin Towers''' were a [[Professional wrestling]] [[tag team]] consisting of Akeem "The African Dream" (formerly the [[George Gray (wrestler)|One Man Gang]]) and [[Ray Traylor|Big Bossman]] from 1988 to 1990. They were managed by [[Ken Johnson (wrestling)|Slick]] throughout their run as a team.

==Career==
The [[Ray Traylor|Big Bossman]] and [[One Man Gang]] had previously had a feud, in which Big Bossman won the [[UWF Heavyweight Championship]]. Bossman then entered the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] in 1988 feuding with the arguable top [[face]] at that time [[Hulk Hogan]]. During this time Akeem & The Big Bossman formed a tag team and called themselves "Twin Towers" and were managed by Slick. The [[team]] both competed together and alone against the [[The Mega Powers]] (Hogan & Randy Savage). After the Mega Powers broke up, The Twin Towers turned their attention to the tag team division, feuding with [[the Rockers]], [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]], and others. After [[WrestleMania]] the team restarted their feud with Hogan, giving Bossman a [[WWE Championship|WWF Title]] shot, which he lost. Also at this time they teamed with Andre the Giant losing to [[Jim Duggan]] and Demolition at [[SummerSlam (1989)|SummerSlam 1989]].

==Break up==
Later that year [[The Twin Towers (professional wrestling)|The Twin Towers]] broke up and the Big Boss Man turned [[face]]. This led to a match at [[WrestleMania VI]] in which the Bossman, without Slick, won over Akeem. Subsequently, The Boss Man later began teaming up with his former foe, [[Hulk Hogan]], against many forces. Akeem would leave the WWF in October 1990.
