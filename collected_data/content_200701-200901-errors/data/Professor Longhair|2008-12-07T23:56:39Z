'''Professor Longhair''' (born '''Henry Roeland Byrd''', also known as '''Roy "Bald Head" Byrd''' and as '''Fess''') ([[December 19]], [[1918]] - [[January 30]], [[1980]]) was a [[New Orleans]] [[blues]] singer and pianist.  He was born in [[Bogalusa, Louisiana]].  He was noted for his unique piano style, which he described as "a combination of [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]], [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], and [[calypso music|Calypso]]", and his unusual, expressive voice, described once as "freak unique".  He was called the '''Bach of Rock and Roll''' for the clarity, varied and extremely accurate and "funky" syncopation, and the beautiful tone of his piano playing.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}  Byrd is noteworthy for having been active in two distinct periods, both in the heyday of early rhythm and blues, and in the resurgence of interest in various forms of traditional jazz after the [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]] was created.  At that time Byrd became a New Orleans icon.

Professor Longhair had only one national commercial hit, "Bald Head" in 1950, and he lacked the crossover appeal for the white audience of [[Fats Domino]]. But his rollicking, idiosyncratic, rumba-based piano and exuberant singing made him one of New Orleans biggest rock stars.

==Musical career==
Professor Longhair began his career in [[New Orleans]] near the end of the 1940s but was not well known outside of the city at that time. Throughout the 1950s he recorded for  [[Atlantic Records]],  [[Federal Records]] and other, local labels. In the 1960s his career faltered and he became a janitor and gambled.  But he was rediscovered in 1969 as the large white [[blues]] audience began to appreciate him and he was referred to as the "Father of New Orleans R&B". During this period his albums, such as ''[[Crawfish Fiesta]]'' on [[Alligator Records]] and ''[[New Orleans Piano]]'' for Atlantic became readily available. In 1980, Professor Longhair died.<ref name=recordedblues>{{cite book| last = Oliver (ed.)| first = Paul| title = The Blackwell Guide to Recorded Blues| publisher = Blackwell Publisher
