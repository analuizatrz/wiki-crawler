'''''The Economist''''' is an [[English language|English]]-language weekly news and [[international affairs]] publication owned by "The Economist Newspaper Ltd" and edited in [[London]]. It has been in continuous publication since [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]] established it in September 1843. As at summer 2007, its average [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] tops 1.2 million copies a week, about half of which are sold in North America.<ref name="gainsreaders">{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5250996 |title='Economist' Magazine Wins American Readers |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=[[NPR]] }}</ref> Consequently it is often seen as a [[transatlantic]] (as opposed to solely British) news source.

The aim of ''The Economist'' is "to take part in a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress."<ref>http://www.economist.co.uk/opinion/</ref> Subjects covered include international [[news]], [[economics]], [[politics]], [[business]], [[finance]], [[science]], [[technology]],  and the [[art]]s. The publication targets an educated readership and counts among its [[audience]] influential business and [[government]] decision-makers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://printmediakit.economist.com/Reader_reviews.40.0.html |title=How our readers view The Economist |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> 

It takes a [[The Economist editorial stance|strongly argued editorial stance]] on many issues, especially its support for [[free trade]] and [[fiscal conservatism]]. It therefore practices [[advocacy journalism]].

Although ''The Economist'' calls itself a newspaper and refers to its staff as correspondents, it is printed in [[magazine]] form on glossy [[paper]], like a [[newsmagazine]]. 

''The Economist'' belongs to [[The Economist Group]]. The publication interests of the group include the ''CFO'' brand family as well as the annual ''[[World in...]]'', the lifestyle quarterly ''[[Intelligent Life]]'', ''[[European Voice]]'' and ''[[Roll Call]]'' (known as "the Newspaper of [[Capitol Hill]]"). Another part of the group is [[The Economist Intelligence Unit]], a research and advisory company providing country, industry and management analysis worldwide. Since 1928, half the shares of The Economist Group have been owned by the ''[[Financial Times]]'', a subsidiary of [[Pearson PLC]], and the other half by a group of independent shareholders, including many members of the staff. The editor's independence is guaranteed by the existence of a board of trustees, which formally appoints him and without whose permission he cannot be removed.

==Features==
''The Economist'''s primary focus is world [[news]], [[politics]] and [[business]], but it also runs regular sections on [[science]] and [[technology]] as well as books and the [[art]]s.   Every two weeks, the newspaper includes, as an additional section, an in-depth special report of a particular business issue, business sector or geographical region. Every three months, ''The Economist'' publishes a technology report called Technology Quarterly or TQ.

Articles often take a definite editorial stance and almost never carry a [[byline]]. Not even the name of the [[editing|editor]] (from 2006, [[John Micklethwait]]) is printed in the issue. It is a longstanding tradition that an editor's only signed article during his tenure is written on the occasion of his departure from the position. The author of a piece is named in certain circumstances: when notable persons are invited to contribute opinion pieces; when ''Economist'' writers compile special reports; and to highlight a potential [[conflict of interest]] over a book review. The names of ''Economist'' editors and correspondents can be located, however, via the media directory pages of the website.

The newspaper has a trademark tight writing style that is famous for putting a maximum amount of information into a minimum of column inches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/research/StyleGuide/ |title=The Economist style guide |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> Since 1995, ''The Economist'' has published one [[obituary]] every week, of a significant person, not necessarily famous, from any field of endeavour.

''The Economist'' is known for its [[Big Mac Index]], which uses the price of a [[Big Mac]] hamburger sold by [[McDonald's]] in different [[country|countries]] as an informal measure of the [[purchasing power parity|purchasing power]] of currencies. While whimsical, exchange rates in Western countries have been more likely to adjust to the Big Mac index than vice-versa.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} 

Each opinion column in the newspaper is devoted to a particular area of interest. The names of these columns reflect the topic they concentrate on:
* ''Bagehot'' ([[United Kingdom|Britain]]) &mdash; named for [[Walter Bagehot]] ({{pronEng|ˈbædʒət}}), nineteenth-century British constitutional expert and early editor of ''The Economist''.
* ''Charlemagne'' (Europe) &mdash; named for [[Charlemagne]], founder of the [[Frankish Empire]].
* ''Lexington'' ([[United States]]) &mdash; named for [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], the site of the beginning of the [[American War of Independence]].
* ''Buttonwood'' ([[finance]]) &mdash; named for the [[American sycamore|buttonwood]] tree where early [[Wall Street]] traders gathered. Until September 2006 this was available only as an online column, but it is now included in the print edition.

Two other regular columns are:
* ''Face Value'': about prominent people in the business world.
* ''Economics Focus'': a general economics column, frequently based on academic research. 

The magazine goes to press on Thursdays, is available online from Thursday between 6 and 7pm GMT, and is available on [[newsstand]]s in many countries the next day. It is printed at seven sites around the world.

''The Economist'' newspaper sponsors yearly "[[Innovation Awards]]", in the categories of bioscience, computing and communications, energy and the environment, social and economic innovation, business-process innovation, consumer products, and a special “no boundaries” category. It also sponsors a writing award.

''The Economist'' also produces the annual ''The World in'' [''Year''] publication.

In 1845 during [[Railway Mania]], ''The Economist'' changed its name to ''The Economist, Weekly Commercial Times, Bankers' Gazette, and Railway Monitor. A Political, Literary and General Newspaper''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue8_9/odlyzko/ |title=The many paradoxes of broadband |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=firstmonday.org }}</ref>

==Opinions==
{{Main article|The Economist editorial stance}}

When the newspaper was founded, the term "[[economism]]" denoted what would today be termed [[fiscal conservatism]] in the [[United States]], or [[economic liberalism]] in the rest of the world (and historically in the United States as well). ''The Economist'' generally supports [[free markets]] and opposes extreme [[socialism]]. It is in favour of [[globalisation]] and free [[immigration]]. Economic liberalism is generally associated with the right, but is now favoured by some traditionally left-wing parties. It also supports [[social liberalism]], which is often seen as left-wing, especially in the United States. This contrast derives in part from ''The Economist's'' roots in [[classical liberalism]], disfavouring government interference in either social or economic activity. According to former editor Bill Emmott, "the ''Economist'''s philosophy has always been liberal, not conservative."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,408484,00.html |title=Time for a referendum on the monarchy |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=[[The Guardian]] }}</ref> However, the views taken by individual contributors are quite diverse.

''The Economist'' has endorsed both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]] in recent British elections, and both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates in the United States.

A history of ''The Economist'' by the editors of Economist.com puts it this way:

{{quotation|What, besides free trade and free markets, does ''The Economist'' believe in? "It is to the Radicals that ''The Economist'' still likes to think of itself as belonging. The extreme centre is the paper's historical position." That is as true today as when former ''Economist'' editor Geoffrey Crowther said it in 1955. ''The Economist'' considers itself the enemy of privilege, pomposity and predictability. It has backed conservatives such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. It has supported the Americans in Vietnam. But it has also endorsed Harold Wilson and Bill Clinton, and espoused a variety of liberal causes: opposing capital punishment from its earliest days, while favouring penal reform and decolonisation, as well as&mdash;more recently&mdash;gun control and gay marriage.|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/help/DisplayHelp.cfm?folder=663377 |title=About us |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref>}}

''The Economist'' has frequently criticised figures and countries deemed corrupt or dishonest. In recent years, for example, it has been critical of World Bank president [[Paul Wolfowitz]], [[Silvio Berlusconi]], [[Italy]]'s former Prime Minister (who dubbed it ''The Ecommunist''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/09/324682.html |title=Report of Rome anti-war demo on Saturday 24th with photos |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=[[Indymedia]] }}</ref>); [[Laurent Kabila]], the late president of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]; and [[Robert Mugabe]], the head of government in [[Zimbabwe]]. ''The Economist'' also called for [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's impeachment]] and later for [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s resignation after the emergence of the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2647493 |title=Resign Rumsfeld |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> Although ''The Economist'' supported George W. Bush's election campaign in 2000{{Fact|date=October 2007}} and as of January 2007 maintains vocal support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq (but criticized the "almost criminal negligence" of the Bush Administration’s handling of the war),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RRRTGGP |title=Mugged by reality |accessdate=2007-04-09 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> the editors backed John Kerry in the 2004 election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_QTVPPQ |title=Crunch time in America |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3329802 |title=The incompetent or the incoherent? |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref>. The paper has also supported some left-wing issues{{Fact|date=December 2007}} such as progressive taxation, criticizing the U.S. tax model in a recent issue, and seems to support some government regulation on health issues (such as smoking in public areas) and income inequality (higher taxes for the wealthy), as long as it is done lightly. Although it is also a big advocate of flat taxes.   The ''Economist'' consistently favours guest worker programs and amnesties especially in 2006 when one article was titled "Sense not [[Jim Sensenbrenner|Sensenbrenner]]."<ref>[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displayStory.cfm?story_id=6744217 Sense, not Sensenbrenner], The Economist, [[March 30]], [[2006]]</ref>

==Tone and voice==
''The Economist'' does not print by-lines identifying the authors of articles other than survey articles and articles written by outsiders "By Invitation". In their own words: "It is written anonymously, because it is a paper whose collective voice and personality matter more than the identities of individual journalists."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/about/about_economist.cfm |title=The Economist &mdash; About us |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> Where needed, references to the author within the article are made as "your correspondent." Rare exceptions to this rule occur where there might otherwise be a conflict of interest such as when reviewing a book written by someone connected with ''The Economist''.

The editorial staff enforces a strictly uniform voice throughout the magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/ |title=The Economist &mdash; Style guide |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> As a result, most articles read as though they were written by a single author, displaying dry, understated wit, and precise use of language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/index.cfm?page=673927 |title=The Economist &mdash; Tone |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/research/johnson/ |title=Johnson |accessdate=2006-12-27 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> <!--a trait which many define as "classically British":needs a source--> The magazine's popular style guide, often similarly dry and punchy, is published in print and online. [http://www.economist.com/research/StyleGuide/]

The magazine's treatment of economics presumes a working familiarity with fundamental concepts of classical economics. For instance, it does not explain terms like [[invisible hand]], [[macroeconomics]], or [[demand curve]], and may take just six or seven words to explain the theory of [[comparative advantage]]. However, articles involving economics do not presume any formal training on the part of the reader, and aim to be accessible to the reasonably educated and intelligent layperson. The newspaper usually does not translate short French quotes or phrases, and sentences in Ancient Greek or Latin are not uncommon. It does however describe the nature or business of even well-known entities; writing for example, "Goldman Sachs, an investment bank". 

It strives to be well-rounded. As well as financial and economic issues, it reports on science, culture, language, literature, and art, and is careful to hire writers and editors who are well-versed in these subjects.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The publication displays a sense of whimsy, especially in article titles (preceded by a header that clearly indicates the subject area). Many articles include some witticism, image captions are often humorous and the letters section usually concludes with an odd or light-hearted letter. These efforts at humor have sometimes had a mixed reception. For example, the cover of the [[September 20]], [[2003]] issue, headlined by a story on the [[Cancún]] [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] ministerial meeting, featured a cactus [[Finger (gesture)|giving the middle finger]].<ref>[http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayCover.cfm?url=/images/20030920/20030920issuecovUS400.jpg Issue Cover for Sep 20th 2003], economist.com</ref> Readers sent both positive and negative letters in response.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_NDJJSJP Letters: Pointing the Finger], The Economist, [[October 2]], [[2003]]</ref>

==Circulation==
Circulation for the newspaper, audited by the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations]] (ABC), was over 1.2 million for the first half of 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ads.economist.com/the-economist/circulation/worldwide-circulation/ |title=Worldwide circulation |accessdate=2007-08-21 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref> 
Sales inside North America were around 54% of the total, with sales in the UK making up 14% of the total and continental Europe 19%. ''The Economist'' claims sales, both by subscription and on newsstands, in over 200 countries. 

The newspaper consciously adopts an [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] approach and notes that over 80% of its readership is from outside the UK, its country of publication. Global sales have doubled since 1997. Of its American readers, two out of three make more than $100,000 a year.<ref name="gainsreaders"/>

The Economist Newspaper Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[The Economist Group]]. One half of The Economist Group is owned by private shareholders, including members of the [[Rothschild banking family of England]] (Sir [[Evelyn de Rothschild]] was Chairman of the company from 1972 to 1989), and the other half by the [[Financial Times]], a subsidiary of [[Pearson PLC|The Pearson Group]]. The [[editorial independence]] of ''The Economist'' is strictly upheld. An independent trust board, which has power to block any changes of the editor, exists to ensure this.

==Letters==
''The Economist'' frequently receives letters from senior businesspeople, politicians and spokespeople for government departments, Non-Governmental Organisations and pressure-groups, but well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of [[Corporate Social Responsibility]], published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from [[Oxfam]], the [[UN World Food Programme]], [[UN Global Compact]], the Chairman of [[BT Group plc|BT]], an ex-Director of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and the UK [[Institute of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/542754 |title=Compilation: Full text of responses to Economist survey on Corporate Social Responsibility (January-February 2005) |accessdate=2007-02-03 |work=Business & Human Rights}}</ref>.  It has published a lively selection of letters on topics such as intelligent design and global warming. Many of the letters ''The Economist'' chooses to publish pull no punches in criticising its editorial stance. The father of a soldier, who had been sent to Iraq three times, demanded that ''The Economist'' apologise for supporting the war.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} After ''The Economist'' ran a critique of Amnesty International and human rights in general in its issue dated [[March 24]], [[2007]], its letters page ran a vibrant reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the UN Human Rights Commission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8954694 |title=Letters: On Amnesty International and human rights, Iraq, tax breaks Apr 4 2007 |accessdate=09 Nov 2007|work=Economist.com}}</ref> Letters published in the magazine are typically between 150 and 200 words long. Most other letters received are published online in "[http://www.economist.com/debate/theinbox/ The Inbox]".

==Special features==
Fortnightly, ''The Economist'' publishes [http://www.economist.com/specialreports/ special reports] (previously called [[survey article|surveys]]) on a given topic—the five main categories being [http://www.economist.com/specialreports/specialreportslist.cfm?category=455021 Countries and Regions], [http://www.economist.com/specialreports/specialreportslist.cfm?category=455022 Business], [http://www.economist.com/specialreports/specialreportslist.cfm?category=455023 Finance and Economics], [http://www.economist.com/specialreports/specialreportslist.cfm?category=455024 Science and Technology], and [http://www.economist.com/specialreports/specialreportslist.cfm?category=455025 Other]. The reports consist of a series of articles in the form of summaries and analysis, and, contrary to the magazine's custom, they carry a [[byline]].  Every three months, there's a [http://www.economist.com/science/tq/ Technology Quarterly] that can be thought of as a special report focusing on recent trends and developments in science and technology.

Since July [[2007]] <ref>{{cite web |last=Allen |first=Katie |date=[[July 11]], [[2007]] |url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2124016,00.html |title=Economist launches audio magazine |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |accessdate=2007-08-16 }}</ref>, there has also been a complete [http://www.economist.com/audioedition/ audio edition] of the magazine available 5pm London time on Fridays, the next day after the print magazine is published. It is free for subscribers and available for a fee for non-subscribers.

==Censorship==
Sections of ''The Economist'' criticising authoritarian regimes, such as [[People's Republic of China|China]], are frequently removed from the newspaper by the authorities in those countries. Despite having its Asia-Pacific office in [[Singapore]], ''The Economist'' regularly has difficulties with the [[Lee Kuan Yew|Lee]] dynasty, having been sued successfully by them for [[libel]] on a number of occasions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HL01Ae01.html |title=Inconvenient truths in Singapore |accessdate=2007-01-31 |format= |work=[[Asia Times]] }}</ref>

On [[June 15]], [[2006]] [[Iran]] banned the sale of ''The Economist'' when it published a map labelling the [[Persian Gulf]] simply as "Gulf" — a choice that derives its political significance from a claim by certain Arabs resulting in [[Persian Gulf naming dispute]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150191582529&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |title=Iran bans ''The Economist'' over map |accessdate=2007-01-31 |format= |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] }}</ref>

[[Robert Mugabe|Robert Mugabe's]] government in [[Zimbabwe]] went further, and imprisoned [[Andrew Meldrum]], ''The Economist'''s correspondent there. The government charged him with violating a statute against "publishing untruth" for writing that a woman was decapitated by Mugabe supporters. The decapitation claim was retracted and allegedly fabricated by the woman's husband. The correspondent was later acquitted, only to receive a deportation order.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=2574 |title=Guardian and RFI correspondent risks two years in jail |accessdate=2007-01-31 |format= |work=[[Reporters Without Borders]] }}</ref>

==References in popular culture==

* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Catch 'Em If You Can]]", [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is traveling by air in first class and says "Look at me, I'm reading ''The Economist''. Did you know Indonesia is at a crossroads?" and when questioned by his wife, he simply replies "It is!" Four days later, with its customary dry wit, ''The Economist'' alluded to the quote, and published an article about Indonesia referring to the "crossroads". The title of the issue was "Indonesia's Gambit".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_NGPQNST |title=The electoral week &mdash; On the trail |accessdate=2006-12-28 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_NGPQNQR |title=Investing in Indonesia |accessdate=2006-12-28 |format= |work=economist.com }}</ref>  About seven months later, ''The Economist'' ran a cover headline reading "Indonesia at a Crossroads."<ref>The Economist, December 11-17, 2004, [http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayCover.cfm?url=/images/20041211/20041211issuecovEU400.jpg cover]</ref>
