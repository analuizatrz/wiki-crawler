==Plot==
Quahog becomes the subject of a [[Flu|flu epidemic]], and Peter goes to see [[List of Family Guy characters|Dr. Hartman]] for a vaccine. Although they are in short supply, and the elderly must therefore take priority, Peter manages to get one anyway (by pretending to fall onto the syringe). While looking through Peter's papers, Hartman realizes that Peter needs a [[prostate exam]]. Peter agrees to get one, despite not knowing what it is. Peter is shocked by the concept of the exam, feeling he was sexually violated after Hartman puts his finger up his anus. Upon running home (naked) to tell Lois about his ordeal, she is non-supportive, much to his disappointment. He then suffers a nervous meltdown and later, resorts to informing his friends about the incident, to which they tell him Hartman "raped" them too. As a result of this, Peter decides to sue Hartman in a [[court of law]], with Lois unable to talk him out of it.

In the courtroom, Peter unintentionally exaggerates the story. The judge is not convinced, and even recalls his own prostate exam being uneventful. However, after further prompting from Peter, the judge "[[confabulation|remembers]]" being abused and declares Hartman guilty, revoking his license. As Peter celebrates his victory at [[List_of_places_on_Family_Guy#Arts_and_entertainment|The Drunken Clam]], his frequent need to urinate causes concern among his friends, where [[List of Family Guy characters#Seamus|Seamus]] informs him that his prostate may be infected. However, his lawsuit makes it unlikely that any doctor would treat him. Peter visits Dr. Hartman in disguise and unsuccessfully tries to trick him, but the doctor decides that his [[Hippocratic Oath]] requires him to go ahead with the examination anyway. In the epilogue, his license is reinstated.

Meanwhile, Stewie is playing at the park with his teddy, Rupert, who is almost destroyed by a dog. Lois retrieves then fixes the bear, causing Stewie to rethink all the bad thoughts he's had of Lois. Stewie becomes enamored with her, which she takes as refreshing at first, but eventually, she becomes exhausted and frustrated at his increased dependency and even has a nightmare of harming him. Taking Brian's advice, she starts ignoring his demands for attention until he injures himself falling down the stairs; Lois tries to apologize for her behavior, but Stewie is so disgusted by it that it causes him to hate her once again.<ref name="Episode">{{cite video|year=2005|title=Plot synopsis information for the episode "Stewie Loves Lois"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

==Production==
When Stewie is fantasizing about murdering and harming Lois, he performs several karate and kung-fu moves. This is a reference to an individual whom Mark Hentemann, a writer for ''Family Guy'', used to know. He was the boy who would come to school, car washes or other events and tell stories about the people who he had been in physical fights with.<ref name="MacFarlane">{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|year=2007|title=Family Guy volume 5 (Region 1) or Season 6 (Region 2) DVD commentary for the episode "Stewie Loves Lois"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> During the scene when Stewie describes Lois as being the female version of [[Bonnie Hunt]], MacFarlane comments that he feels bad about that joke, as just before it was broadcast - Hunt telephoned him on his mobile phone and told him about how much she enjoyed the show, however the gag was not removed due to its expected airing date being so close to when the telephone call was made.<ref name="MacFarlane"/>

For a reason which was not specified, the sound of Lois's footsteps when going down the basement stairs during her dream of killing Stewie, had to be overcome by Stewie talking more often. This line of Stewie making general conversation in the same scene, was altered several times due to lack of laughter from the audience.<ref name="MacFarlane"/> MacFarlane comments that the scene of Peter standing up to his teacher who was giving the class a [[Exam|written examination]], is a reference to "80's TV bullshit".<ref name="MacFarlane"/><ref name="Goodman"/>

==Reception==
[[IGN]]'s Dan Iverson commented that "the Stewie/Lois story was really kind of funny", noting that the scene was "a nice window in on parenting". He describes the scene of Stewie shouting at Brian in Spanish as being "very funny". However, Iverson criticized the episode, noting that the scene of Peter giving his story in court went from just "creepy and awkward to just plain disturbing". The episode received a final rating by Iverson of 4.5/10.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730920p1.html|title=Stewie Loves Lois|accessdate=2007-11-09|author=Iverson, Dan|date=September 06, 2006|publisher=IGN}}</ref>
