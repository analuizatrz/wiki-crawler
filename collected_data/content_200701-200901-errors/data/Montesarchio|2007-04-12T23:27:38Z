'''Montesarchio''' ([[Latin]]: '''Caudium'''; [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|Καύδιον}}) is a commune in the [[Province of Benevento]], [[Campania]], [[Italy]].

==History==

Montesarchio is the site of ancient [[Caudium (ancient city) |Caudium]], an ancient city of [[Samnium]], situated on the road from Beneventum (modern [[Benevento]]) to [[Capua]]. It seems probable that it was in early times a place of importance, and the capital or chief city of the tribe called the [[Caudini]]; but it bears only a secondary place in history. It is first mentioned during the [[Second Samnite War]], [[321 BCE]], when the [[Samnite]] army under [[C. Pontius]] encamped there, previous to the great disaster of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the neighbouring pass known as the [[Caudine Forks]] ([[Livy]] ix. 2); and again, a few years later, as the head-quarters occupied by the Samnites, with a view of being at hand to watch the movements of the [[Campanians]]. (''Id.'' ix. 27.) The town of Caudium is not mentioned during the [[Second Punic War]], though the tribe of the Caudini is repeatedly alluded to. Niebuhr supposes the city to have been destroyed by the Romans, in revenge for their great defeat in its neighbourhood; but there is no evidence for this. It reappears at a later period as a small town situated on the [[Appian Way]], and apparently deriving its chief importance from the transit of travellers (Hor. Sat. i. 5. 51; [[Strabo]] v. p. 249): the same causes preserved it in existence down to the close of the [[Roman Empire]]. ([[Ptolemy|Ptol.]] iii. 1. § 67; [[Antonine Itinerary|Itin. Ant.]] p. 111; Itin. Hier. p. 610; [[Tabula Peutingeriana|Tab. Peut.]]) We learn that it received a colony of veterans; and it appears from [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], as well as from inscriptions, that it retained its municipal character, though deprived of a large portion of its territory in favor of the neighboring city of Beneventum. (Plin. iii. 11. s. 16; Lib. Colon. p. 232; Orelli, ''Inscr.'' 128, 131.) The period of its destruction is unknown: the name is still found in the ninth century, but it is uncertain whether the town still existed at that time.

The position of Caudium is fixed by the Itineraries, which all concur in placing it on the Appian Way, 21 Roman miles from Capua, and 11 from Beneventum; and as the total distance thus given from Capua to Beneventum is perfectly correct, there can be no doubt that the division of it is so too.
