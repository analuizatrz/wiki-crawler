A '''black hole''' is an object predicted by [[general relativity]],<ref name="predicted">The Singularities of Gravitational Collapse and Cosmology. S. W. Hawking, R.

Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Vol. 314, No. 1519 ([[27 January]] [[1970]]), pp. 529-548</ref> with a gravitational field so powerful that even [[electromagnetic radiation]] (such as [[light]]) cannot escape its pull.<ref name="encarta1">{{Cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761558067/Black_Hole.html|title=Black hole|accessdate=2006-12-24|publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia|year=2006|author=Pasachoff, Jay M.; A.B., A.M., Ph.D.|work=MSN Encarta|format=html}}</ref>

A black hole is ''defined'' to be a region of [[space-time]] where escape to the outside universe is impossible. The [[Boundary (topology)|outer boundary]] of this region is called the [[event horizon]]. Nothing can move from inside the event horizon to the outside, even briefly, due to the extreme gravitational field existing within the region. For the same reason, observers outside the event horizon cannot see any events which may be happening within the event horizon; thus any energy being radiated or events happening within the region are forever unable to be seen or detected from outside. Within the black hole is a '''[[Gravitational singularity|singularity]]''', an anomalous place where matter is compressed to the degree that the known laws of physics no longer apply to it.

Theoretically, a black hole can be any size. Astrophysicists expect to find black holes with masses ranging between roughly the mass of the [[Sun]] ("stellar-mass" black holes) to many millions of times the mass of the Sun ([[supermassive black hole]]s).

The existence of black holes in the universe is well supported by [[astronomical observation]], particularly from studying [[X-ray]] emission from [[X-ray binaries]] and [[active galactic nuclei]]. It has also been hypothesized that black holes radiate an undetectably small amount of energy due to [[quantum mechanical]] effects. This is called [[Hawking radiation]].

==Simple overview==
[[Image:BH LMC.png|270px|right|thumb|Gravitational distortions caused by a black hole in front of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (artistic interpretation)]]

Most planets and other [[celestial bodies]] are stable because the [[Pauli force]] between electrons prevents atoms from collapsing into each other, while [[Gravitation|gravity]], [[electromagnetism]], and the [[strong force]] pull them together. These create a balance which allows material bodies to retain their shape and structure. In extreme circumstances, however, if there is enough matter in a small enough space, gravity ends up winning, and the matter collapses: [[electron]]s cannot stay distant from the [[atomic nucleus]], and incredibly dense matter forms (sometimes called [[neutronium]]). Eventually, if the star is massive enough, even the [[Pauli force]] between [[nucleons]] cannot resist gravity and the star collapses into itself further forming a black hole. In a way that can be hard to imagine, ''nothing'' can stop this collapse if enough matter gets into a small enough space, and the matter collapses to a point of zero height, width, and depth, known as a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]], in which the matter is so dense it is no longer "matter" in any real sense, but some kind of [[anomaly]] in [[space]]. Anything that gets too close to this singularity will also collapse into it the same way, whether it is matter, [[energy]] or even light itself, which is the fastest thing in the universe. The failure of even light to escape its gravitation is how the phenomenon initially acquired the name '''black hole'''.

Because matter and energy which passes this "boundary" can never escape back again, observers outside this invisible "boundary" can neither see inside nor detect what might happen within the interior - it is forever unable to be witnessed. The invisible 'dividing line' in space where matter or energy will be unavoidably drawn into the black hole is known as the [[event horizon]], because like the earth's [[horizon]] nothing can be seen beyond it.

It was later found that energy can escape from black holes in an unexpected way, and that therefore black holes can ''evaporate''. In space, [[virtual particle]]s are continually coming into existence and vanishing on a microscopic scale that is so small they cannot easily be detected. This is a consequence of [[quantum physics]] and only works on a subatomic scale. Conceptually, these particles can be imagined to appear in pairs and vanish a tiny fraction of a second later again. For this reason they are not readily noticed. But close to the black hole's event horizon, the intense gravitational field separates the two particles even in the fractional second that they exist. One particle may be absorbed into the black hole, the other escapes. From an external perspective all that is seen is the second of these, giving the appearance of energy being radiated outward, escaping from its gravitational field beyond the event horizon. In this way, paradoxically, black holes can evaporate. This process is thought to be significant for the very smallest black holes, as a black hole of stellar mass or larger would absorb more energy from [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] than they lose this way. The radiation emitted is referred to as [[Hawking radiation]].

Black holes generally come in two types: those with a mass up to ten times the mass of our [[Sun]], and those with a mass that is millions or billions of times that of our sun. The latter are called [[supermassive black hole]]s, and are thought to exist at the centers of galaxies.<ref>{{cite book | author=Julian H. Krolik | title=Active Galactic Nuclei | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=1999 | id =ISBN 0-691-01151-6}}</ref> [[Micro black holes]] are believed to be possible but very short-lived, capable of creation under extreme circumstances such as the [[Big Bang]] or perhaps by very high powered [[particle accelerator]]s or [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s.<ref>Scientific American, May 2005</ref>

==History==
The concept of a body so massive that even light could not escape was put forward by the [[geologist]] [[John Michell]] in a 1784 paper sent to [[Henry Cavendish]] and published by the [[Royal Society]].<ref>J. Michell, Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., 74 (1784) 35-57.</ref> At that time, the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] theory of [[Gravitation|gravity]] and the concept of [[escape velocity]] were well known. Michell computed that a body with 500 times the radius of the Sun and of the same [[density]] would have, at its surface, an escape velocity exceeding that of the [[speed of light]], and therefore would be invisible. In his words:
{{cquote|''If the semi-diameter of a sphere of the same density as the Sun were to exceed that of the Sun in the proportion of 500 to 1, a body falling from an infinite height towards it would have acquired at its surface greater velocity than that of light, and consequently supposing light to be attracted by the same force in proportion to its vis inertiae (inertial mass), with other bodies, all light emitted from such a body would be made to return towards it by its own proper gravity.''}}

Michell considered the possibility that many such objects that cannot be seen might be present in the cosmos.

In 1796, the mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] promoted the same idea in the first and second editions of his book ''Exposition du système du Monde'' (it was removed from later editions). The idea gained little attention in the nineteenth century, since light was thought to be a massless wave, hence not influenced by gravity.

In 1915, [[Albert Einstein]] developed the theory of gravity called [[general relativity]], having earlier shown that gravity does influence light. A few months later, [[Karl Schwarzschild]] gave the [[Schwarzschild metric|solution]] for the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass,<ref>K. Schwarzschild, Sitzungsber.Preuss.Akad.Wiss.Berlin (Math.Phys.), (1916) 189-196</ref><ref>K. Schwarzschild, Sitzungsber.Preuss.Akad.Wiss.Berlin (Math.Phys.), (1916) 424-434</ref> showing that a black hole could theoretically exist. The [[Schwarzschild radius]] is now known to be the radius of the [[event horizon]] of a non-rotating black hole, but this was not well understood at that time. Schwarzschild himself thought it was not physical. A few months after Schwarzschild, a student of [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]], Johannes Droste, independently gave the same solution for the point mass and wrote more extensively about its properties.

In 1930, the [[astrophysicist]] [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] argued that special relativity demonstrated that a non-radiating body above 1.44 solar masses, now known as the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], would collapse since there was nothing known at that time that could stop it from doing so. His arguments were opposed by [[Arthur Eddington]], who believed that something would inevitably stop the collapse. Both were correct, since a [[white dwarf]] more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a [[neutron star]]. However, a neutron star above about three solar masses (the [[Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit]]) will itself become unstable against collapse due to similar physics.

In 1939, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and H. Snyder predicted that massive stars could undergo a dramatic [[gravitational collapse]]. Black holes could, in principle, be formed in nature. Such objects for a while were called frozen stars since the collapse would be observed to rapidly slow down and become heavily [[redshift]]ed near the Schwarzschild radius. The mathematics showed that an outside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where it crosses that radius. These hypothetical objects were not the topic of much interest until the late 1960s. Most physicists believed that they were a peculiar feature of the highly symmetric solution found by Schwarzschild, and that objects collapsing in nature would not form black holes.

Interest in black holes was rekindled in 1967 because of theoretical and experimental progress. In 1970, [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Roger Penrose]] proved that black holes are a generic feature in Einstein's theory of gravity, and cannot be avoided in some collapsing objects.<ref name="predicted" /> Interest was renewed in the astronomical community with the discovery of [[pulsar]]s. Shortly thereafter, the expression "black hole" was coined by theoretical physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.truephysics.com/history/timeline/timeline1961_1980.html| title=The True Physics Project - Physics in a New Way.|accessdate=2006-04-21}}</ref> being first used in his public lecture ''Our Universe: the Known and Unknown'' on [[29 December]] [[1967]]. The older Newtonian objects of Michell and Laplace are often referred to as "[[dark star]]s" to distinguish them from the "black holes" of general relativity.

==Evidence==

The blurred ring is due to objects whose light must travel close enough to the black hole to suffer [[gravitational lens]]ing distortion before being observed.]]
===Formation and size===
[[General relativity]] (as well as most other metric theories of gravity) not only says that black holes ''can'' exist, but in fact predicts that they will be formed in nature whenever a sufficient amount of mass gets packed in a given region of space, through a process called [[gravitational collapse]]; as the mass inside the given region of space increases, its gravity becomes stronger and (in the language of relativity) increasingly deforms the space around it, until ultimately nothing (not even light) can escape the gravity; at this point an [[event horizon]] is formed, and matter and energy must inevitably collapse to a density beyond the limits of known physics. For example, if the Sun was compressed to a radius of roughly three kilometers (about 1/232,000 its present radius or 1/1.2487&times;10<sup>16</sup> of its initial volume), the resulting gravitational field would create an event horizon around it, and thus a black hole.

A quantitative analysis of this idea led to the prediction that a stellar remnant above about three to five times the mass of the Sun (the [[Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit]]) would be unable to support itself as a [[neutron star]] via [[degeneracy pressure]], and would inevitably collapse into a black hole. Stellar remnants with this mass are expected to be produced immediately at the end of the lives of stars that are more than 25 to 50 times the mass of the Sun, or by accretion of matter onto an existing [[neutron star]].

Stellar collapse will generate black holes containing at least three [[solar mass]]es. Black holes smaller than this limit can only be created if their matter is subjected to sufficient pressure from some source other than self-gravitation. The enormous pressures needed for this are thought to have existed in the very early stages of the universe, possibly creating [[primordial black hole]]s which could have masses smaller than that of the Sun.

[[Supermassive black hole]]s are believed to exist in the center of most [[galaxy|galaxies]], including our own [[Milky Way]]. This type of black hole contains millions to billions of solar masses, and there are several models of how they might have been formed. The first is via gravitational collapse of a dense cluster of stars. A second is by large amounts of mass accreting onto a "seed" black hole of stellar mass. A third is by repeated fusion of smaller black holes. Effects of such supermassive black holes on spacetime may be observed in regions as the [[Virgo Cluster]] of galaxies, for example, the location of [[Messier 87|M87]] (see image below) and its neighbors.

[[Intermediate-mass black hole]]s have a mass between that of stellar and supermassive black holes, typically in the range of thousands of solar masses. Intermediate-mass black holes have been proposed as a possible power source for [[Ultraluminous X-ray source|ultra-luminous X ray sources]], and in 2004 detection was claimed of an intermediate-mass black hole orbiting the [[Sagittarius A*]] supermassive black hole candidate at the core of the Milky Way galaxy. This detection is disputed.

The lower limit on the mass of a black hole comes from the quantum arguments. According to the most commonly accepted physics, one should not expect to observe black holes lighter than the [[Planck mass]], or approximately 10<sup>-5</sup> g, and even those would only exist for minuscule periods of time before evaporating. If true, this limit would rule out the possibility of creating miniature black holes in the laboratory in the foreseeable future: even today, center-of-mass collision energies of the world's most advanced particle accelerators are still 14-15 orders of magnitude lower than the Planck mass.

However, certain models of [[theory of everything|unification]] of the [[fundamental interaction|four fundamental forces]] do allow the formation of [[micro black hole]]s under laboratory conditions. These postulate that the energy at which [[gravity]] is unified with the other forces is comparable to the energy at which the other three are [[grand unification theory|unified]], as opposed to being the [[Planck energy]] (which is much higher). This would allow production of extremely short-lived black holes in terrestrial [[particle accelerator]]s. No conclusive evidence of this type of black hole production has been presented, though even a negative result improves constraints on [[compactification (physics)|compactification]] of extra dimensions from [[string theory]] or other models of physics.

===Observation===
[[Image:Black hole jet diagram.jpg|right|350px|thumb|Formation of extragalactic jets from a black hole's accretion disk]]
In theory, no object within the event horizon of a black hole can ever escape, including light. However, black holes can be inductively detected from observation of [[phenomena]] near them, such as [[gravitational lensing]], [[galactic jets]], and stars that appear to be in [[orbit]] (typically with short [[orbital period]]s of only a few hours or days suggesting a massive partner) around a point in [[space]] where there is no visible matter.

The most conspicuous effects are believed to come from matter accreting onto a black hole, which is predicted to collect into an extremely hot and fast-spinning [[accretion disk]]. The internal [[viscosity]] of the disk causes it to become extremely hot, and emit large amounts of [[X-ray]] and [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]]. This process is extremely efficient and can convert about 10% of the [[rest mass]] [[energy]] of an object into [[radiation]], as opposed to [[nuclear fusion]] which can only convert a few percent of the [[mass]] to energy. Other observed effects are narrow [[relativistic jet|jets]] of particles at relativistic speeds heading along the disk's axis.

However, accretion disks, jets, and orbiting objects are found not only around black holes, but also around other objects such as [[neutron star]]s and [[white dwarf]]s; and the dynamics of bodies near these non-black hole attractors is largely similar to that of bodies around black holes. It is currently a very complex and active field of research involving [[magnetic field]]s and [[plasma physics]] to disentangle what is going on. Hence, for the most part, observations of accretion disks and orbital motions merely indicate that there is a compact object of a certain mass, and says very little about the nature of that object. The identification of an object as a black hole requires the further assumption that no other object (or bound system of objects) could be so massive and compact. Most astrophysicists accept that this is the case, since according to general relativity, any concentration of matter of sufficient density must necessarily collapse into a black hole.

One important observable difference between black holes and other compact massive objects is that any infalling matter will eventually collide with the latter at relativistic speeds, leading to emission as the kinetic energy of the matter is thermalized. In addition [[thermonuclear]] "burning" may occur on the surface of compact massive objects as material collides or builds up. These processes produce irregular intense flares of [[X-rays]] and other hard radiation around some objects. The lack of such flare-ups around such a compact concentration of mass is taken as evidence suggesting that the object is a black hole which lacks a surface onto which matter can collect and from which radiation can be emitted.

===Suspected black holes===
[[Image:Black Hole Merger.jpg|thumb|right|240px|An artist depiction of two black holes merging.]]

There is now a great deal of indirect astronomical observational evidence for black holes in two mass ranges:
* [[stellar black hole|stellar mass black holes]] with masses of a typical [[star]] (4 &ndash; 15 times the mass of our Sun), and
* [[supermassive black hole]]s with masses ranging from on the order of <math>10^5</math> to <math>10^{10}</math> solar masses.

Additionally, there is some evidence for [[intermediate-mass black hole]]s (IMBHs), those with masses of a few hundred to a few thousand times that of the Sun. These black holes may be responsible for the emission from [[ultraluminous X-ray source]]s (ULXs).

Candidates for stellar-mass black holes were identified mainly by the presence of accretion disks of the right size and speed, without the irregular flare-ups that are expected from disks around other compact objects. Stellar-mass black holes may be involved in [[gamma ray burst]]s (GRBs); short duration GRBs are believed to be caused by colliding [[neutron star]]s, which form a black hole on merging. Observations of long GRBs in association with [[supernova]]e<ref>{{cite web| url=http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/universe/plasma_univ.html| title=The Plasma Universe| publisher = Liftoff to Space Exploration (NASA)| accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref> suggest that long GRBs are caused by [[collapsars]];<ref>{{cite book| url=http://www.wkap.nl/prod/b/0-7923-3784-0| title=Plasma Astrophysics and Cosmology - The Second IEEE International Workshop, Princeton, New Jersey, [[May 12]]-10 12, 1993| editor=Peratt, Anthony L.|id=ISBN 0-7923-3784-0}}</ref> a massive star whose core collapses to form a black hole, drawing in the surrounding material. Therefore, a GRB could possibly signal the birth of a new black hole, aiding efforts to search for them.

Candidates for more massive black holes were first provided by the [[active galactic nuclei]] and [[quasar]]s, discovered by [[radioastronomy|radioastronomers]] in the 1960s. The efficient conversion of mass into energy by friction in the accretion disk of a black hole seems to be the only explanation for the copious amounts of energy generated by such objects. Indeed the introduction of this theory in the 1970s removed a major objection to the belief that quasars were distant galaxies &mdash; namely, that no physical mechanism could generate that much energy.

From observations in the 1980s of motions of stars around the galactic centre, it is now believed that such supermassive black holes exist in the centre of most galaxies, including our own [[Milky Way]]. [[Sagittarius A*]] is now generally agreed to be the location of a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way galaxy. The orbits of stars within a few [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] of Sagittarius A* rule out any object other than a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way assuming the current standard laws of physics are correct.

[[Image:M87_jet.jpg|left|thumb|The jet emitted by the galaxy [[Elliptical Galaxy M87|M87]] in this image is thought to be caused by a [[supermassive black hole]] at the galaxy's centre]]

The current picture is that all galaxies may have a supermassive black hole in their centre, and that this black hole accretes gas and dust in the middle of the galaxies generating huge amounts of radiation &mdash; until all the nearby mass has been swallowed and the process shuts off. This picture may also explain why there are no nearby [[quasar]]s.

Although the details are still not clear, it seems that the growth of the black hole is intimately related to the growth of the spheroidal component &mdash; an [[elliptical galaxy]], or the [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]] of a [[spiral galaxy]] &mdash; in which it lives.

In 2002, the Hubble Telescope identified evidence indicating that intermediate size black holes exist in [[globular clusters]] named [[Messier 15|M15]] and [[Mayall II|G1]]. The evidence for the black holes stemmed from the orbital velocity of the stars in the globular clusters; however, a group of [[neutron star]]s could cause similar observations.

=== Nearest black hole candidates ===
Apart from [[Sagittarius A*]], the black hole in our Milky Way's center, there are several strong black hole candidates nearer than it to us, all of them X-ray binaries which draw matter from their partner via an accretion disk. They have masses from three to more than a dozen sun masses.<ref>J. Casares: ''Observational evidence for stellar mass black holes.'' [http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612312 Preprint]</ref><ref>M.R.

===Recent discoveries===
In 2004, astronomers found 31 candidate supermassive black holes from searching obscured [[quasar]]s. The lead scientist said that there are from two to five times as many supermassive black holes as previously predicted.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://physicsweb.org/articles/news/8/6/1| title=Hidden black holes come into view| year=[[2 June]] [[2004]]| publisher=Physicsweb| accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref>

In June 2004 astronomers found a super-massive black hole, [[Q0906+6930]], at the centre of a distant [[galaxy]] about 12.7 billion light years away. This observation indicated rapid creation of super-massive black holes in the early universe.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/heavy_blazar_040628.html| title=Massive Black Hole Stumps Researchers| first=Tariq| last=Malik| year=[[28 June]] [[2004]]| publisher=Space.com| accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref>

In November 2004 a team of astronomers reported the discovery of the first [[intermediate-mass black hole]] in our Galaxy, orbiting three light-years from Sagittarius A*. This medium black hole of 1,300 solar masses is within a cluster of seven stars, possibly the remnant of a massive star cluster that has been stripped down by the Galactic Centre.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041108//full/041108-2.html#B2| title=Second black hole found at the centre of our Galaxy| publisher=News@Nature.com| accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.edpsciences-usa.org/articles/aa/abs/2004/31/aa0147-03/aa0147-03.html| title=The nature of the Galactic Center source IRS 13 revealed by high spatial resolution in the infrared| accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref> This observation may add support to the idea that supermassive black holes grow by absorbing nearby smaller black holes and stars.

In February 2005, a [[blue giant]] [[star]] [[SDSS J090745.0+24507]] was found to be leaving the [[Milky Way]] at twice the escape velocity (0.0022 of the speed of light), having been catapulted out of the galactic core which its path can be traced back to. The high velocity of this star supports the hypothesis of a super-massive black hole in the centre of the galaxy.

The formation of [[micro black hole]]s on Earth in [[particle accelerators]] has been tentatively reported,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4357613.stm| year=[[17 March]] [[2005]]| title=Lab fireball 'may be black hole'| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref> but not yet confirmed. So far there are no observed candidates for [[primordial black hole]]s.

In January 2007, researchers at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom reported finding a black hole inside a compact group of ancient stars known as a [[globular cluster]]. Many doubted newly-formed black holes could exist in such locations due to gravitational interactions.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6231623.stm| title=Black hole found in ancient lair| accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref>

==Features and theories==
Black holes require the [[general relativity|general relativistic]] concept of a curved [[spacetime]]: their most striking properties rely on a distortion of the geometry of the space surrounding them.

===Gravitational field===
The gravitational field outside a black hole is identical to the field produced by any other [[Divergence theorem#Spherically symmetric mass distribution|spherically symmetric object]] of the same mass. The popular conception of black holes as "sucking" things in is false: objects can orbit around black holes indefinitely without getting any closer. The strange properties of spacetime only become noticeable closer to the black hole.

===Event horizon===
The effective boundary of a black hole is known as the ''[[event horizon]]''. The event horizon is not a physical surface; it is the invisible dividing line in space beyond which outside observers cannot see, and from within which matter and energy cannot exit. [[Stephen Hawking]] proved that the topology of the event horizon of a non-spinning black hole is a sphere. Due to the extremely strong gravitational field, anything inside the event horizon, including a photon, is prevented from escaping across the event horizon. Particles from outside this region can fall in, cross the event horizon, and will never be able to leave. In this sense, the event horizon is a little like the [[point of no return]].

External observers cannot probe the interior of a black hole. Consequently according to (non-quantum) general relativity, black holes can be entirely characterized by these parameters: [[energy]], [[linear momentum]], [[angular momentum]], [[electric charge]], and position at a specific time. This principle is summarized by the saying, coined by [[John Archibald Wheeler]], "[[no hair theorem|black holes have no hair]]" meaning that there are no features that distinguish one black hole from another, other than energy, linear momentum, charge, angular momentum, and location.

===Space-time distortion and frame of reference===
Objects in a gravitational field experience a slowing down of [[time]], called [[time dilation]], relative to observers outside the field. This phenomenon has been verified experimentally in the [[Scout rocket experiment]] of 1976,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/relativ/gratim.html| title=Gravitational Red Shift| accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref> and is, for example, taken into account in the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS). Near the event horizon, the time dilation increases rapidly.

From the viewpoint of a distant observer, an object falling into a black hole appears to slow down, approaching but never quite reaching the event horizon. As the object falls into the black hole, it appears redder and dimmer to the distant observer, due to the extreme [[gravitational red shift]] caused by the gravity of the black hole. Eventually, the falling object becomes so dim that it can no longer be seen, at a point just before it reaches the event horizon.

From the viewpoint of the falling object, nothing particularly special happens at the event horizon. The object crosses the event horizon and reaches the singularity at the center within a finite amount of [[proper time]], as measured by a watch carried with the falling observer.

From the viewpoint of the falling observer, distant objects may appear either blue-shifted or red-shifted, depending on the observer's trajectory. Light is blue-shifted by the gravity of the black hole, but is red-shifted by the velocity of the falling object.

===Inside the event horizon===
Space-time inside the event horizon of an uncharged non-rotating black hole is peculiar in that the singularity is in every observer's future, so all particles within the event horizon move inexorably towards it ([[Roger Penrose|Penrose]] and [[Stephen Hawking|Hawking]]). This means that there is a conceptual inaccuracy in the non-relativistic concept of a black hole as originally proposed by [[John Michell]] in 1783. In Michell's theory, the escape velocity at the surface of the star is greater than the speed of light, but it would still be theoretically possible to hoist an object out of a black hole using a rope. General relativity eliminates such loopholes, because once an object is inside the event horizon, its time-line contains an end-point to time itself, and no possible [[world line]] comes back out through the event horizon. Once inside the black hole, at most one course-correction (performed immediately) is appropriate to maximize your survival time.

As the object continues to approach the singularity, it will be stretched radially with respect to the black hole and compressed in directions perpendicular to this axis. This phenomenon, called [[spaghettification]], occurs as a result of [[tidal force]]s: the parts of the object closer to the singularity feel a stronger pull towards it (causing stretching along the axis), and all parts are pulled in the direction of the singularity, which is only aligned with the object's average motion along the axis of the object (causing compression towards the axis).

===Singularity===
At the center of the black hole, well inside the event horizon, general relativity predicts a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]], a place where the curvature of spacetime becomes infinite and gravitational forces become infinitely strong.

In a non-rotating black hole, the singularity is one-dimensional, extended in the time direction only. In a rotating black hole, the singularity is two-dimensional, extended in time and in longitude.

It is expected that future refinements or generalizations of general relativity (in particular [[quantum gravity]]) will change what is thought about the nature of black hole interiors. Most theorists interpret the mathematical singularity of the equations as indicating that the current theory is not complete, and that new phenomena must come into play as one approaches the singularity.<ref name="smolin">{{cite book | author=Lee Smolin | title=Three Roads To Quantum Gravity | publisher=Basic Books | year=2001 | id=ISBN 0-465-07835-4}}</ref>

The [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]] asserts that there are no [[naked singularity|naked singularities]] in general relativity. This hypothesis is that every singularity is hidden behind an event horizon and cannot be probed. Whether this hypothesis is true remains an active area of theoretical research.

===Rotating black holes===
{{main|Rotating black hole}}
[[Image:Accretion_disk.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of a black hole with a closely orbiting companion star that exceeds its [[Roche limit]]. In-falling matter forms an [[accretion disk]], with some of the matter being ejected in highly energetic polar jets.]]

According to theory, the event horizon of a black hole that is not spinning is spherical, and its singularity is expected to be a single point where the curvature becomes infinite. If the black hole carries angular momentum (inherited from a star that is spinning at the time of its collapse), it begins to drag space-time surrounding the event horizon in an effect known as [[frame-dragging]]. This spinning area surrounding the event horizon is called the [[ergosphere]] and has an [[ellipsoid]]al shape. Since the ergosphere is located outside the event horizon, objects can exist within the ergosphere without falling into the hole. However, because space-time itself is moving in the ergosphere, it is impossible for objects to remain in a fixed position. Objects grazing the ergosphere could in some circumstances be catapulted outwards at great speed, extracting energy (and angular momentum) from the hole, hence the Greek name ''ergosphere'' ("sphere of work") because it is capable of doing work.

The singularity inside a rotating black hole is expected to be a ring, rather than a point, though the interior geometry of a rotating black hole is currently not well understood. While the fate of an observer falling into a non-rotating black hole is [[spaghettification]], the fate of an observer falling into a rotating black hole is much less clear. For instance, in the Kerr geometry, an infalling observer can potentially escape [[spaghettification]] by passing through an [[inner horizon]]. However, it is unlikely that the actual interior geometry of a rotating black hole is the [[Kerr metric|Kerr]] geometry due to stability issues, and the ultimate fate of an observer falling into a rotating black hole is currently not known.<ref>{{cite journal |

===Entropy and Hawking radiation===
In 1971, [[Stephen Hawking]] showed that the total area of the event horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never decrease. This sounded remarkably similar to the Second Law of [[Thermodynamics]], with area playing the role of [[entropy]]. Classically, one could violate the second law of thermodynamics by material entering a black hole disappearing from our universe and resulting in a decrease of the total entropy of the universe. Therefore, [[Jacob Bekenstein]] proposed that a black hole should have an entropy and that it should be proportional to its horizon area. Since black holes do not classically emit radiation, the thermodynamic viewpoint was simply an analogy. However, in 1974, Hawking applied [[quantum field theory]] to the curved spacetime around the event horizon and discovered that black holes can emit [[Hawking radiation]], a form of [[thermal radiation]]. Using the [[Laws of black hole mechanics#The First Law|first law of black hole mechanics]], it follows that the entropy of a black hole is one quarter of the area of the horizon. This is a universal result and can be extended to apply to cosmological horizons such as in [[de Sitter space]]. It was later suggested that black holes are maximum-entropy objects, meaning that the maximum entropy of a region of space is the entropy of the largest black hole that can fit into it. This led to the [[holographic principle]].

The Hawking radiation reflects a characteristic [[temperature]] of the black hole, which can be calculated from its entropy. This temperature in fact falls the more massive a black hole becomes: the more energy a black hole absorbs, the colder it gets. A black hole with roughly the [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#23|mass of the planet Mercury]] would have a temperature in equilibrium with the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation (about 2.73 K). More massive than this, a black hole will be colder than the background radiation, and it will gain energy from the background faster than it gives energy up through Hawking radiation, becoming even colder still. However, for a less massive black hole the effect implies that the mass of the black hole will slowly evaporate with time, with the black hole becoming hotter and hotter as it does so. Although these effects are negligible for black holes massive enough to have been formed astronomically, they would rapidly become significant for hypothetical [[micro black hole|smaller black holes]], where quantum-mechanical effects dominate. Indeed, small black holes are predicted to undergo runaway evaporation and eventually vanish in a burst of radiation.
[[Image:First Gold Beam-Beam Collision Events at RHIC at 100 100 GeV c per beam recorded by STAR.jpg|thumb|right|400px|If ultra-high-energy collisions of particles in a [[particle accelerator]] can create microscopic black holes, it is expected that all types of particles will be emitted by black hole evaporation, providing key evidence for any [[grand unified theory]]. Above are the high energy particles produced in a gold ion collision on the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]].]]
Although general relativity can be used to perform a semi-classical calculation of black hole entropy, this situation is theoretically unsatisfying. In [[statistical mechanics]], entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system which have the same macroscopic qualities(such as [[mass]], [[charge]], [[pressure]], etc.). But without a satisfactory theory of [[quantum gravity]], one cannot perform such a computation for black holes. Some promise has been shown by [[string theory]], however. There one posits that the microscopic degrees of freedom of the black hole are [[D-brane]]s. By counting the states of D-branes with given charges and energy, the entropy for certain [[supersymmetric]] black holes has been reproduced. Extending the region of validity of these calculations is an ongoing area of research.

===Black hole unitarity===
An open question in fundamental physics is the so-called information loss paradox, or [[black hole information paradox|black hole unitarity]] paradox. Classically, the laws of physics are the same run forward or in reverse. That is, if the position and velocity of every particle in the universe were measured, we could (disregarding [[chaos theory|chaos]]) work backwards to discover the history of the universe arbitrarily far in the past. In quantum mechanics, this corresponds to a vital property called [[unitarity]] which has to do with the conservation of probability.

Black holes, however, might violate this rule. The position under classical general relativity is subtle but straightforward: because of the classical [[no hair theorem]], we can never determine what went into the black hole. However, as seen from the outside, information is never actually destroyed, as matter falling into the black hole appears from the outside to become more and more red-shifted as it approaches (but never ultimately appears to reach) the event horizon.

Ideas of [[quantum gravity]], on the other hand, suggest that there can only be a limited finite entropy (ie a maximum finite amount of information) associated with the space near the horizon; but the change in the entropy of the horizon plus the entropy of the Hawking radiation is always sufficient to take up all of the entropy of matter and energy falling into the black hole.

Many physicists are concerned however that this is still not sufficiently well understood. In particular, at a quantum level, is the quantum state of the Hawking radiation uniquely determined by the history of what has fallen into the black hole; and is the history of what has fallen into the black hole uniquely determined by the quantum state of the black hole and the radiation? This is what determinism, and unitarity, would require.

For a long time [[Stephen Hawking]] had opposed such ideas, holding to his original 1975 position that the Hawking radiation is entirely thermal and therefore entirely random, representing new nondeterministically created information. However, on [[21 July]] [[2004]] he presented a new argument, reversing his previous position.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040712/full/040712-12.html| title=Hawking changes his mind about black holes| publisher=News@Nature.com| accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref> On this new calculation, the entropy associated with the black hole itself would still be inaccessible to external observers; and in the absence of this information, it is impossible to relate in a 1:1 way the information in the Hawking radiation (embodied in its detailed internal correlations) to the initial state of the system. However, if the black hole evaporates completely, then such an identification can be made, and unitarity is preserved. It is not clear how far even the specialist scientific community is yet persuaded by the mathematical machinery Hawking has used (indeed many regard ''all'' work on quantum gravity so far as highly speculative); but Hawking himself found it sufficiently convincing to pay out on a [[Thorne-Hawking-Preskill bet|bet]] he had made in 1997 with Caltech physicist [[John Preskill]], to considerable media interest.

==Mathematical theory==
{{see|Schwarzschild metric |Deriving the Schwarzschild solution}}

Black holes are predictions of [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]]. There are many known solutions to the [[Einstein field equations]] which describe black holes, and they are also thought to be an inevitable part of the evolution of any star of a certain size. In particular, they occur in the [[Schwarzschild metric]], one of the earliest and simplest solutions to Einstein's equations, found by [[Karl Schwarzschild]] in 1915. This solution describes the [[curvature]] of [[spacetime]] in the vicinity of a static and [[sphere|spherically]] [[symmetry|symmetric]] object, where the [[Metric space|metric]] is,

:<math> \mathrm{d}s^2 = - c^2 \left( 1 - {2Gm \over c^2 r} \right) \mathrm{d}t^2 + \left( 1 - {2Gm \over c^2 r} \right)^{-1} \mathrm{d}r^2 + r^2 \mathrm{d}\Omega^2 </math>,

where <math>\mathrm{d}\Omega^2 = \mathrm{d}\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\; \mathrm{d}\phi^2</math> is a standard element of solid angle.

According to general relativity, a gravitating object will collapse into a black hole if its radius is smaller than a characteristic distance, known as the [[Schwarzschild radius]]. (Indeed, [[Buchdahl's theorem]] in general relativity shows that in the case of a [[fluid solution|perfect fluid model]] of a compact object, the true lower limit is somewhat larger than the Schwarzschild radius.) Below this radius, spacetime is so strongly curved that any light ray emitted in this region, regardless of the direction in which it is emitted, will travel towards the centre of the system. Because [[special relativity|relativity]] forbids anything from traveling [[faster-than-light|faster than light]], anything below the Schwarzschild radius &ndash; including the constituent particles of the gravitating object &ndash; will collapse into the centre. A [[gravitational singularity]], a region of theoretically infinite density, forms at this point. Because not even light can escape from within the Schwarzschild radius, a classical black hole would truly appear [[black]].

The Schwarzschild radius is given by

:<math>r_{\rm S} = {2\,Gm \over c^2} </math>

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], ''m'' is the [[mass]] of the object, and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. For an object with the mass of the [[Earth]], the Schwarzschild radius is a mere 9 [[1 E-3 m|millimeters]] &mdash; about the size of a [[marble (toy)|marble]].

The mean density inside the Schwarzschild radius decreases as the mass of the black hole increases, so while an earth-mass black hole would have a density of 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>, a supermassive black hole of 10<sup>9</sup> [[solar mass]]es has a density of around 20&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>, less than water! The mean density is given by

:<math>\rho=\frac{3\,c^6}{32\pi m^2G^3}</math>

Since the Earth has a mean radius of 6371 km, its volume would have to be reduced 4 &times; 10<sup>26</sup> times to collapse into a black hole. For an object with the mass of the [[Sun]], the Schwarzschild radius is approximately 3&nbsp;km, much smaller than the Sun's current radius of about 696,000 km. It is also significantly smaller than the radius to which the Sun will ultimately shrink after exhausting its nuclear fuel, which is several thousand kilometers. More massive stars can collapse into black holes at the end of their lifetimes.

The formula also implies that any object with a given mean density is a black hole if its radius is large enough. The same formula applies for [[white holes]] as well. For example, if the [[visible universe]] has a mean density equal to the [[critical density]], then it is a [[white hole]], since its [[singularity]] is in the past and not in the future as should be for a black hole.

More general black holes are also predicted by other solutions to Einstein's equations, such as the [[Kerr metric]] for a rotating black hole, which possesses a [[ring singularity]]. Then we have the [[Reissner-Nordström metric]] for charged black holes. Last the [[Kerr-Newman metric]] is for the case of a charged and rotating black hole.

There is also the Black Hole Entropy formula:

:<math>S = \frac{Akc^3}{4\hbar G}</math>

Where '''A''' is the area of the event horizon of the black hole, '''<math>\hbar</math>''' is [[Dirac's constant]] (the "reduced [[Planck constant]]"), '''k''' is the [[Boltzmann constant]], '''G''' is the [[gravitational constant]], '''c''' is the [[speed of light]] and '''S''' is the [[entropy]].

A convenient length scale to measure black hole processes is the "gravitational radius", which is equal to
:<math>r_{\rm G} = {Gm \over c^2} </math>
When expressed in terms of this length scale, many phenomena appear at integer radii.
For example, the radius of a Schwarzschild black hole is two gravitational radii and the radius of a maximally rotating Kerr black hole is one gravitational radius. The location of the light circularization radius around a Schwarzschild black hole (where light may orbit the hole in an unstable circular orbit) is <math>3r_{\rm G}</math>. The location of the marginally stable orbit, thought to be close to the inner edge of an accretion disk, is at <math>6r_{\rm G}</math> for a Schwarzschild black hole.

==Alternative models==
Several alternative models, which behave like a black hole but avoid the singularity, have been proposed. But most researchers judge these concepts artificial, as they are more complicated but do not give near term observable differences from black holes (see [[Occam's razor]]). The most prominent alternative theory is the [[Gravastar]].

In March 2005, physicist [[George Chapline]] at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[California]] proposed that black holes do not exist, and that objects currently thought to be black holes are actually [[dark-energy star]]s. He draws this conclusion from some quantum mechanical analyses. Although his proposal currently has little support in the physics community, it was widely reported by the media.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050328/full/050328-8.html| title=Black holes 'do not exist'| publisher=News@Nature.com| accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0503200| title=Dark Energy Stars| first=G.| last=Chapline| accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref>

Finally, [[plasma cosmology|plasma cosmologists]] suggest that [[Birkeland current]]s provide an alternative explanation for the observed phenomenon, whereby [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] transfer energy over great distances to smaller regions where it may be periodically or catastrophically released. [[Anthony Peratt]] explains the flickering of electromagnetic radiation:{{Fact|date=February 2007}} "The flickering of a light in Los Angeles does not mean that the supply source, a waterfall or hydroelectric dam in the Pacific Northwest, has abruptly changed dimensions or any other physical property. The flickering comes from electrical changes at the observed load or radiative source, such as the formation of instabilities or virtual anodes or cathodes in charged particle beams that are orders of magnitude smaller than the supply. Bizarre and interesting non-physical interpretations are obtained if the flickering light is interpreted by a distant observer to be both the source and supply." Plasma cosmology in this manner is a minority view not within mainstream science

==Black holes and Earth==
Black holes are sometimes listed among the most serious potential threats to Earth and humanity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/feature/story/0,13026,1458536,00.html|title=What a way to go|publisher=Guardian UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisdomofsolomon.com/bigbang.html|title=Big Bang Machine could destroy Earth|publisher=Sunday Times}}</ref>There are two principal ways in which they could affect Earth.
* There is evidence that some black holes are not stationary, rather, they "wander" through space.<ref>[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/blackhole_010913.html Wayward Black Hole Staggers Through Galaxy, Passes Nearby] Robert Roy Britt, [[30 June]] 2005. Retrieved [[7 January]] 2007.</ref> There is only a very slim possibility that a rogue black hole might pass near, or even through our Solar System.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Science/story?id=2365372&page=1 Black Holes: The Deadliest Force in the Universe] ABC News, [[28 August]] 2006. Retrieved [[7 January]] 2007.</ref> At a typical speed of stars' relative motion in the Milky Way, it would take a few decades for a black hole to traverse the Solar System, during which time it would wreak havoc on planets' orbits, and possibly affect Earth and Sun directly if it passes near them.

Fortunately, any black hole with mass that is large enough to cause problems for Earth would be detected well in advance, possibly hundreds of years before its arrival, by its effect on outer planets' orbits. Small black holes would be much less destructive and would pass through the Solar System relatively unnoticed unless they happen to hit one of the planets.
* There is a theoretical possibility that a [[micro black hole]] might be created inside a [[particle accelerator]].<ref>[http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=1011 To the Higgs Particle and Beyond: U.Va. Physicists are Part of an International Team Searching for the Last Undiscovered Aspect of the Standard Model of Physics] Brad Cox, [[8 November]] 2006. Retrieved [[7 January]] 2007.</ref> Again, this is not a cause for concern. Many particle collisions that naturally occur as the [[cosmic rays]] hit the edge of our atmosphere are often far more energetic than any collisions created by man. If micro black holes can be created this way, they are already created every day without our involvement.

Even if, say, two [[protons]] at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] can merge to create a micro black hole, this black hole would be extremely unstable, and it would vaporize due to [[Hawking radiation]] before it had a chance to propagate. For a 14 [[TeV]] black hole (the center-of-mass energy at the Large Hadron Collider), direct computation of its lifetime by Hawking formula gives 10<sup>-100</sup> seconds.
