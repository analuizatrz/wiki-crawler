[[Image:SB Presidio.jpg|thumb|right|400px|A view of the restored portion of the Presidio in 2005.]] The '''El Presidio Real de Santa Bárbara''' (or '''Royal Presidio of Santa Barbara''') was a military installation in [[Santa Barbara, California]], built by [[Spain]] in 1782, with the mission of defending the ''[[Spanish missions in California#Military Districts|Second Military District]]'' in California.  In addition to being a significant [[tourist attraction]], it is an active [[archaeological site]].  It is the second oldest surviving building in California; only the chapel at [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] (known as "Father Serra's Church") is older.  In addition, it was the last military outpost to be built by Spain in the New World. <ref>Tompkins, 1975, p. 8 </ref>

A small portion of the original Presidio survives to the present day, and has been restored.  While most of the original structure is gone, because the original layout was twisted several degrees from the street grid upon which the town was later built, some traces of it can be seen in aerial photography (for instance in walls, fences, and some buildings which follow property lines in conformance with the Presidio's geometry).  The only parts of the large quadrangle to be restored are some of the guard quarters, as well as the Cañedo Adobe, which became the property of a former Presidio soldier after the facility was decommissioned.

The chapel in the Presidio, one of the restored buildings, was the primary place of worship for the residents of early Santa Barbara, since the mission, a mile and a half away, was mainly intended for use by the native [[Chumash]] Indians after their conversion to [[Christianity]].

==History==
The site of the Presidio was chosen by [[Felipe de Neve]], the first governor of the Californias.  Perceiving that the coast at Santa Barbara was vulnerable to attack, he located a spot near a harbor which was sheltered from severe storms.  In addition, there was an ample supply of both building materials and water nearby.  Construction began on [[April 21]], [[1782]], and Padre [[Junípero Serra]] blessed the site.

The first commandante, [[José Francisco Ortega]], planned the fortifications and irrigating works. He obtained livestock for the presidio from Ventura, established orchards, and began large-scale farming. Four years later, construction of the nearby [[Mission Santa Barbara]] began.  The town of Santa Barbara developed around the Presidio, which offered protection for the residents.

The Presidio was built as a fortress, and therefore included a strong outer wall with an open parade ground on all sides affording clear visibility.  While, during its sixty years of operation, it was never attacked by a strong military force, the assaults of nature were more severe:  several devastating earthquakes in the early 19th century destroyed much of the structure.  At the time of the [[Mexican-American War]], very little remained in usable condition, and on [[December 27]], [[1846]], when [[John C. Frémont]] crossed [[San Marcos Pass]] during rainy weather and came up on the Presidio and the town from behind, the Presidio surrendered without a fight.  None was necessary; the garrison was away, in [[Los Angeles]].  Frémont had heard that the Mexican army was lying in ambush for him at [[Gaviota Pass]], the only sensible route over the mountains at that time, and had crossed the difficult muddy track on San Marcos Pass to outflank them, but this move turned out not to have been necessary.  Mexican General [[Andrés Pico]] later surrendered his force to Frémont, recognizing that the war was lost. <ref>Tompkins, 1975, p. 33-35 </ref>

In 1963, the Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation (SBTHP) was founded, with the primary mission of restoring the Presidio.  In 1966, the land on which the Presidio is located became a State Historic Park. <ref>SBTHP web site </ref>  On December 27, 2006, the SBTHP signed an agreement with the California State Parks Department to manage the Presidio.<ref>KEYT, December 27, 2006.</ref>  Work on the restoration continues.
