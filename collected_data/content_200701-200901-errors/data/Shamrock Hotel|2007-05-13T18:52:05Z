The '''Shamrock Hotel''' was a hotel located in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]].  The hotel was constructed between [[1946]] and [[1949]] by [[wildcatter]] [[Glenn McCarthy]] at a location south of [[Downtown Houston|downtown]] in the [[Texas Medical Center]]. The hotel was the largest built in the United States in the 1940s. The hotel was later sold to the [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] hotel chain and was renamed the Shamrock Hilton.

==Facilities==
The Shamrock Hotel was designed by the [[Fort Worth]] architect Wyatt C. Hedrick. Stone and Webster Construction Company and the Tellepsen Construction Company were general contractors. Robert D. Harrell of Los Angeles designed the interior. Ralph Ellis Gunn was the landscape architect. <ref>http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/SS/ccs5.html</ref>

The eighteen-story, 1,100-room hotel was conceived by McCarthy as a downtown-sized hotel scaled to the convention trade but set in a suburban location. adjacent to the hotel to the north was a five-story building containing a 1,000-car garage and 25,000-square-foot exhibition hall. To the south was the hotel's landscaped garden, terrace, and swimming pool. The pool measured 165 by 142 feet and was described as the largest outdoor pool in the world, so large that it could accommodate exhibition [[waterskiing]]. <ref> http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/SS/ccs5.html </ref>

When originally opened, the Shamrock had a staff of 1,200, headed by a manager imported from the Waldorf-Astoria. The 5,000-square-foot lobby was paneled in Bolivian mahogany and [[Art Deco]] trim. McCarthy requested that furnishings and decor be in 63 shades of [[green]], <ref>http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811889-1,00.html</ref> in honor of his ancestral Ireland. Every room had air-conditioning and television, which were rare amenities at the time. <ref> http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E7D8133BF93AA15751C1A963948260&sec=travel&spon=&pagewanted=1</ref>

==History==
===Grand opening===
At the time it was built, the hotel was an approximate three miles south of the downtown area of Houston. Construction costs were $21 million. With 50,000 people gathered to eat $42-a-plate dinners, no expense was spared as it opened on [[St. Patrick’s Day]], [[1949]]. <ref>http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4203/ch1-1.htm</ref> <ref name="HT-SHAMR">Stephen Fox.

===Operational years===
From 1949 to [[1953]], the hotel hosted the radio program "Saturday at the Shamrock," produced by the [[American Broadcasting Corporation]]. At the time, it was the only nationally broadcast scripted radio program not produced in New York or Los Angeles. <ref> http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/SS/ccs5.html</ref>

The Shamrock experienced frequent problems with rates of occupancy. In [[1952]] McCarthy defaulted on a loan, and the hotel was acquired by the Equitable Life Assurance Society. In [[1954]], the property was purchased by the [[Hilton Hotels Corporation]], which operated the hotel until [[1986]] as the Shamrock Hilton.

===End of an era===
The hotel was purchased by the Texas Medical Center in [[1985]] and was demolished shortly thereafter on June 1, 1987. The land was later developed into an additional parking lot for the medical center facilities.<ref>''Texas Monthly Guide To Houston'' (1996)  ISBN 0-87719-272-3</ref> <ref>http://www.texmedctr.tmc.edu/root/en/GetToKnow/History/DetailedChronology.htm</ref> Prior to its demolition, historical preservationists held a rally in March 1986 protesting the redevelopment.<ref name="HOU_BIZ_JOUR">Staff Writer.
