{{Politics of the European Union}}
The '''European Commission''' forms part of the [[executive (government)|executive]] branch of the [[European Union]]. It is one of the Union's [[Institutions of the European Union|three main political Institutions]]. It is a [[cabinet government]] of 27 [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]] led by a [[President of the European Commission|Commission President]]. The current President is [[José Manuel Barroso]], who leads the [[Barroso Commission]] who took office in 2004. It is responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the [[Treaties of the European Union|Union's treaties]] and the general day-to-day running of the Union.<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = The European Commission.|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>

The Commission is based in the [[Berlaymont building]] in [[Brussels]] and is supported by an administrative body of about 23,000 European civil servants divided into departments called [[Directorate-General]]. The term "Commission" can either mean the entire administrative body of the Commission or just the college of 27 Commissioners. Its internal [[working language]]s are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]].<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = The European Commission.|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>

==History==<!-- This section is linked from [[President of the European Commission]] -->
{{main|History of the European Commission}}
The Commission originated in [[1951]] with the establishment of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. Its administrative executive was the 9 member "High Authority", headed by a President. In [[1958]], with the creation of two new communities, two sister bodies were established under the terms of the [[Treaties of Rome]]. These were the Commission of the [[European Economic Community]] and the Commission of the [[European Atomic Energy Community]]. The former of these two bodies is generally considered as the "direct ancestor" of the modern Commission, rather than the older High Authority, hence the Commission today recognises the EEC's [[Hallstein Commission]] as the first European Commission. The three bodies co-existed until [[1 July]] [[1967]] where, by means of the [[Merger Treaty]], the three bodies were combined into a single administration under President [[Jean Rey (politician)|Jean Rey]]. This body was called the "Commission of the European Communities"<ref>{{cite web|last = European NAvigator|title = European Commission.|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3202 |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>. One of the most successful Commissioners was that headed by [[Jacques Delors]] ([[Delors Commission]])<ref>{{cite web|last =Merritt|first=Giles|title = A Bit More Delors Could Revamp the Commission| publisher =[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=1992-01-21|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/01/21/edgi_0.php|accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last =[[Burson-Marsteller]]|title = The new Commission - some initial thoughts|date=2004|url=http://www.bmbrussels.be/box_bmnewcomm.php|accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref>. Although the latter Commissions did not see the same success yet saw an expansion of powers, with the President becoming known as the "Prime Minister of Europe" under Prodi.<ref>{{cite web|last =James|first=Barry|title = Prodi to Have Wide, New Powers as Head of the European Commission| publisher =[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=1999-04-16|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/04/16/eu.2.t_0.php|accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last =Rossant|first=John|title = Commentary: Romano Prodi: Europe's First Prime Minister?

==Powers and functions==
[[Image:Jose Manuel BarrosoCROPPED.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Incumbent President Barroso]]
The Commission was set up at the start of the Union to act as an independent supranational authority, it has been described as "the only body paid to think European".<ref>{{cite web|last = EurActiv|title = Interview with European Commission Secretary-General Catherine Day|date=2006-09-25|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/interview-european-commission-secretary-general-catherine-day/article-158149 |accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> Although the members come from national governments they are bound to act independently, neutral from other influences. This is in contrast to the [[Council of the European Union|Council]], which represents governments, and the [[European Parliament|Parliament]], which represents [[EU citizen|citizens]].<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = The European Commission.|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>

Executive power of the Union is held by the Council, representing governments. That power is conferred upon the Commission by the Council and may be withdrawn.<ref>{{cite web|last = European NAvigator|title = Executive body.|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3312 |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last = European NAvigator|title = Implementing powers of the Council of the European Union.|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=5625 |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Powers are outlined in Articles 211-219 of the EC treaty.<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]: Eur-lex|title = Consolidated version of the Treaty Establishing the European Community|url=http://europa.eu/eur-lex/en/treaties/dat/C_2002325EN.003301.html |accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> The Commission is more restricted than most national executives in part due to the lack of the Commission's lack of power over areas like [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|foreign policy]], that power is held by the [[European Council]] which has been described be some also as an executive. Considering that under the [[Reform Treaty]] the European Council would become a formal institution with the power of appointing the Commission, it could be said that the two bodies combined hold the executive power of the Union (the European Council also holding individually national executive powers). However the Commission individually currently only holds that powers over the [[European Community]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Bermann|first = George|title = Executive Power in the New European Constitution|date=2004|url=http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/papers/04/040501-13.pdf|accessdate = 2006-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last = Stark|first = Christine|title = Evolution of the European Council: The implications of a permanent seat|date=2002-09-04|url=http://www.dragoman.org/ec/belfast-2002.pdf|accessdate = 2006-06-18}}</ref> The [[government]]al powers of the Commission have been such that some such as former [[Belgian Prime Minister]] [[Guy Verhofstadt]] have suggested changing its name to the "European Government", calling the present name of "commission" as ''ridiculous''.<ref>{{cite book| last = Verhofstadt| first =Guy| title =The United States of Europe| publisher =Federal Trust| date =2006| location =[[London]]| pages =69| isbn =1-903403-86-3}}</ref>

[[Image:Berlaymont 557 AL.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Berlaymont, the Commission's seat]]
The Commission differs from the other institutions in that over the European Community, it alone as [[legislative initiative]]. Meaning that it alone can make formal proposals for legislation, [[bill (proposed law)|bills]] cannot originate in the legislative branch. It has some right over the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP pillar]] but no right over [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]]. How Council and Commission are able to request legislation however, in most cases the Commission initiates on the basis of these proposals. This monopoly is to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of [[European law]].<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = Glossary: Right of initiative.|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/initiative_right_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last = Council website|title = The Commission's right of initiative.|url=http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/02/cv00/00230en2.pdf |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> However this has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most national parliaments holding the right in some respect.<ref>{{cite web|last = Murray|first=Alasdair|title = Reform not or languish later.|date=2002-09-30|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/murray_parl_0902.html |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Under the Reform Treaty, EU citizens would also be able to request the Commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures, but it would not be binding.<ref>{{cite web|last = Wallis |first = Diana| authorlink =Diana Wallis|last2=Picard|first2=Severine|title = The Citizens' Right of Initiative in the European Constitution: A Second Chance for Democracy.|url=http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2005/demodef/wallis |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>

Once legislation is passed, it is the Commission's responsibility to ensure it is implemented, by member states or through the [[agencies of the European Union]]. In adopting the necessary technical measures the Commission is assisted by committees made up of representatives of member states. This process is sometimes known by the jargon term of [[comitology]].<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = Glossary: Comitology.|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/comitology_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> It is also responsible for the implementation of the [[EU budget]]; ensuring, along with the [[Court of Auditors]], that EU funds are correctly spent. In particular the Commission has a duty to ensure the treaties and law is upheld, potentially by taking member states to the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]]. In this role it is known informally as the "guardian of the treaties".<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = The European Commission.|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>

The Commission also provides [[foreign relations of the European Union|external representation]] for the Union. It is responsible for negotiating international trade agreements, such as within the [[World Trade Organisation]]. The Presidents of the Commission and Council attend [[G8]] meetings.<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = The European Commission.|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Under the rejected [[European Constitution]], the new post of [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] would have been called the "Union Foreign Minister", the first time a Commissioner would be called a "Minister".<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = Constitution for Europe: The Minister for Foreign Affairs.|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/minister_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>

==College==
[[Image:European Commission Room (Open Day) 1.jpg|right|220px|thumb|The college's meeting room on floor 13]]
The Commission President is nominated by the [[European Council]] who is then officially elected by the [[European Parliament]]. The President is often a leading politician from a member-state. In selecting their nomination the European Council take into account the latest European Elections hence the recent swing to the centre-right has produced the current President, [[José Manuel Barroso]] of the [[European People's Party]]. The President appoints a number of Vice-Presidents. There are currently 5, including a single "First" Vice-President. They have relatively little extra power through the position beyond their existing portfolio. The current First-Vice-President is [[Margot Wallström]]. The Commission is composed of a 26-member college of "[[European Commissioner|Commissioners]]" (excluding the President). Each one from, but not representing, a member state and holding a specific portfolio delegated from the President. The whole Commission have to be approved by, and can be thrown out by, the Parliament. Each holds a portfolio such as [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition]] or [[European Commissioner for Enterprise & Industry|Enterprise & Industry]].<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = The European Commission.|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>

The present Commission, the Barroso Commission, took office in late 2004 after being delayed by objections from the Parliament. In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members. With the large size of the Commission, President Barroso has adopted a more Presidential style of control over the college, which has earned him some criticism.<ref>{{cite web|last = Beunderman |first=Mark|publisher=EU Observer|title = EU commission sees civil servants' power grow.|date=2007-02-22|url=http://euobserver.com/843/23553 |accessdate = 2007-02-27}}</ref> There has also been a greater degree of [[European Commissioner#Politicisation|Politicisation within the Commission]], being welcomed by Commissioner Wallström as necessary for citizens engagement.<ref>{{cite web|last = Mahony |first=Honor|publisher=EU Observer|title = Brussels struggles with communication policy.|date=2007-05-07|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24016 |accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref>

==Organisation==
The Commission is primarily based in Brussels, in the Berlaymont. The President's office and the Commission's meeting room are based on the 13th floor. The Commission also operates out of [[Brussels and the European Union|numerous other buildings in Brussels]] and [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]].<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = The European Commission.|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last = Castle |first=Stephen|publisher=The Independent|title = After 13 years of hold-ups and incompetence, the EU's 'Berlaymonster' rises like a phoenix.|date=2004-08-05|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article50224.ece |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>

The Commission is divided into departments known as [[Directorate-General|Directorates-General]] (DGs) that can be likened to departments or [[Ministry (government department)| ministries]]. Each covers a specific policy area or service such as External relations or Translation. Each DG is headed by Director-General who is responsible to a Commissioner. A Commissioners portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs. DGs prepare proposals and if adopted by a majority of Commissioners when meeting it goes forward to Parliament and Council for consideration.<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = Eurojargon.|url=http://europa.eu/abc/eurojargon/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = The European Commission.|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> 

[[Image:Berlaymont Press Room.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Press Room in the Berlaymont]]
According to figures published by the Commission 23,043 persons were employed by the Commission as officials and temporary agents in April 2007. Additionally 9019 "external staff" (e.g. Contractual agents, detached national experts, young experts etc.) were employed. The single largest DG is the [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]] with a 2186 strong staff. The largest group by nationality is [[Belgium|Belgian]] (21.4 %), probably due to a majority (16,626) of staff being based in the country.<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]: Civil Service|title = Staff figures.|url=http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/about/figures/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> The Commission's civil service is headed by a [[Secretary-General of the European Commission|Secretary General]], currently [[Catherine Day]].<ref>{{cite web|last = EurActiv|title = Interview with European Commission Secretary-General Catherine Day|date=2006-09-25|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/interview-european-commission-secretary-general-catherine-day/article-158149 |accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref>

Communication with the press is handled by the [[Directorate-General Communication (European Commission)|Directorate-General Communication]]. The Commission's [[spokesperson]] is Johannes Laitenberger and his two deputy spokespersons are Leonor Ribeiro da Silva and Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen. They take the midday [[Mass media|press]] briefings (aka, the "Midday Presser") which take place every weekday in the Commission's press room at the Berlaymont. At those briefings, journalists can ask can ask European Commission officials absolutely anything they want and legitimately expect to get an "on the record" answer on live TV. Such a situation is unique in the world.<ref>{{cite web|last =Lynam|first=Joe|title = The peculiar world of the European Union| publisher =[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] News|date=2007-04-01|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6496813.stm |accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> There's a greater number of press corps in Brussels than [[Washington D.C.]] with media outlets in every Union member-state having a Brussels [[correspondent]].<ref>{{cite journal|last = Parker|first = John|title = A tale of two cities|journal = E!Sharp magazine|pages = 42-44|date = January - February 2007|publisher = Encompass Publications }}</ref>

==Legitimacy==
It is argued by some that the method of appointment for the Commission increases the [[democratic deficit in the European Union]]. While the Commission is the executive branch, the candidate are chosen primarily by the 27 national governments, meaning it is hard for the Commission to be thrown out directly by the voters. The legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the Parliament along with Parliament's power to sack the body. However there has been less than 50% turn out in the Parliament's elections [[European Parliament election, 1999|since 1999]]. While higher than some national elections, including the [[US Congress]], the fact that there are no direct elections to the Commission President like in the US makes the post less legitimate in the eyes of the public.<ref>{{cite web|last =Mulvey|first=Stephen|title = The EU's democratic challenge| publisher =[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] News|date=2003-11-21|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3224666.stm |accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> A further problem is the lack of a coherant electorate, as even though democratic structures and methods are developing there is not such a mirror in creating a European [[civil society]].<ref>{{cite web|last =Lamming|first=Richard|title = The democratic credentials of the new European Union: does the Constitution increase the EU's democratic legitimacy?| publisher =[[Federal Union]]|date=2004-09-10|url=http://www.federalunion.org.uk/europe/democraticcredentials.shtml |accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> It is seen by some that the new Reform Treaty goes some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president.<ref>{{cite web|last = [[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|title = Glossary: Democratic deficit.|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/democratic_deficit_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Under the plans of Vice President Wallström, [[European political parties]] would gain greater prominence and could lead to the Commission President being elected via the [[Elections in the European Union|Parliament's elections]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Mahony |first=Honor|title = European politics to get more political| publisher =EU Observer|date=2007-06-27|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24370 |accessdate = 2007-06-27}}</ref>

The alternative viewpoint on the Commission states that the policy areas in which it has power to initiate legislation are ill suited to an institution accountable to electoral pressures. In this respect the Commission has been compared with institutions such as independent [[Central Bank]]s which deal with technical areas of policy that are of little electoral salience. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Majone |first=Giandomenico |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |month= |title=Perils of Parliamentarization |journal=Governance |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=375 |id= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>

==Future of the Commission==
The proposed [[Reform Treaty]], the details of which were agreed in June 2007, largely retains the reforms outlined in the rejected [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|Constitutional Treaty]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Council of the European Union|title = Brussels European Council 21/22 June 2007: Presidency Conclusions |date=2007-06-20|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/94932.pdf|accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}</ref> Under the constitution's reforms, most notably force a reduction in the number of Commissioners. From [[2014]], only two out of three member-states would have the right to representation, with this representation being rotated equally between all states and a maximum of two Commissioners per state in any single Commission. The Commission would also include the new [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]], as one of the Vice Presidents, replacing the [[European Commissioner for External Relations|External Relations Commissioner]].

The Constitution also enshrines the new convention of taking into account the most recent European elections when appointing the Commission President, creating a stronger link between the citizens and the Commission. The President is still proposed by the Council although when the decision goes to the Parliament the term "elect" is used rather than "approve". Whether this symbolic move will produce practical change is unknown. The treaty extends the Commission's control over initiating and reaffirms existing functions and conventions. For example; executive, budget and representative functions as well as independence and collective responsibility.
