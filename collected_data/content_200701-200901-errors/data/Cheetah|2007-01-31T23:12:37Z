The '''Cheetah''' (derived from [[Sanskrit]] word ''Chitraka'' meaning "Speckled") (''Acinonyx jubatus'') is an atypical member of the cat family ([[Felidae]]), a poor climber that hunts by speed rather than by stealth. As such, it is placed in its own genus, '''''Acinonyx'''''. It is the fastest of all land animals and although its fastest speed is unknown, it can reach speeds of more than 65 [[miles per hour|mph]] (105 [[kilometers per hour|km/h]])<ref>The Cheetah's fastest recorded speed was 105km/h (65.25 mph). <i>Cheetah</i>, Luke Hunter and Dave Hamman, (Struik Publishers, 2003), pp. 37-38</ref> in short bursts up to 500 yards (460 m), as well as being able to accelerate from 0 to 110 km/h (~70 [[miles per hour|mph]]) in 3 seconds, faster than most [[supercars]].

==Description==
[[Image:Cheetah.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Cheetah]]
The Cheetah has a slender, long-legged body with blunt [[unretractable]] [[claw]]s. Its [[chest]] is deep and its [[waist]] is narrow. Its coat is tan with small, round, black spots, and the fur is coarse and short. The Cheetah has a small [[head (anatomy)|head]] with high-set eyes. Black "tear marks" run from the corner of its eyes down the sides of the nose to its mouth to keep sunlight out of its eyes and to aid in hunting and seeing long distances.

The adult animal weighs from 40 to 65 [[kilogram|kg]] (90 to 140 [[Pound (weight)|lb]]). Its total body length is from 112 to 135 cm (45 [[inch|in]] to 55 in), while the tail can measure up to 84 [[Centimetre|cm]] (33 in). Males tend to be slightly larger than females and have a slightly bigger heads, but there is great variation in Cheetah sizes and it is difficult to tell males and females apart by appearance alone. 

The fur of the Cheetah is tan with round black spots in order to help [[camouflage]] it. The Cheetah's black spots measure from ¾ to 1¼ inches across (2–3 cm). There are no spots on its white belly, however, the tail has spots, which merge to form four to six dark rings at the end. The cheetah's tail usually ends in a bushy white tuft.
[[Image:Cheetah4.jpg|thumb|A portrait of a Cheetah]]
Some Cheetahs also have a rare fur pattern [[mutation]]: Cheetahs with larger, blotchy, merged spots are known as 'King Cheetahs'. It was once thought to be a separate subspecies, but it is merely a mutation of the African Cheetah. The 'King Cheetah' has only been seen in the wild a handful of times, but it has been bred in captivity.

The Cheetah's paws have unretractable claws (known only in two other cat species - the [[Fishing Cat]] and the [[Iriomote Cat]]) offering the cat extra grip in its high-speed pursuits. The [[ligament]] structure of the Cheetah's claws is the same as those of other cats; it simply lacks the sheath of skin and fur present in other varieties, and therefore the claws are always visible. With the exception of the [[dewclaw]], the claw itself is also much shorter and straighter than other cats.

Adaptations that enable the Cheetah to run as fast as it does include large nostrils that allow for optimal oxygen intake, and an enlarged heart and lungs that work together to circulate oxygen efficiently. While running, in addition to having good traction due to its semi-retractable claws, the Cheetah uses its tail as a rudder-like means of steering to allow it to make sharp turns, necessary to outflank prey who often make such turns to escape.

Unlike "true" [[Pantherinae|big cats]], the Cheetah can [[purr]] as it inhales, but cannot roar. By contrast, the big cats can roar but cannot purr, except while exhaling. However, the Cheetah is still considered by some to be the smallest of the big cats. While it is often mistaken for the [[Leopard]], the Cheetah does have distinguishing features, such as the aforementioned long "tear-streak" lines on each side of its nose that run from the corner of its eyes to its mouth. The body frame of the Cheetah is also very different from that of the Leopard, most notably so in its thinner and extra long tail.

The Cheetah is a vulnerable species. Out of all the big cats, it is the least able to [[adaptation|adapt]] to new environments. It has always proved difficult to breed in captivity, although recently a few zoos have been successful. Once widely shot for its fur, the Cheetah now suffers more from the loss of both habitat and prey.

The Cheetah is considered the most primitive of all cats, and until recently was thought to have evolved approximately 18 million years ago, although new research puts the last common ancestor of all 40 existing species of feline more recently, at 11 million years. The Cheetah's natural enemies are the [[Lion]], [[hyena]]s, and the Leopard.

==Reproduction and social life==
[[Image:Maasai_Mara_Cheetah_2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cheetahs in [[Masai Mara]] game reserve, [[Kenya]]]]

Females reach sexual maturity in 20 to 24 months, and males around 12 months (although they do not usually mate until at least 3 years old), and mating occurs throughout the year. Females give [[childbirth|birth]] to up to nine cubs after a [[gestation]] period of ninety to ninety-eight days, although the average litter size is 3 to 5. Cubs weigh from 150 to 300 g (5 to 10 [[ounce|oz]].) at birth. Unlike some other cats, the Cheetah is born with its characteristic spots. Cubs are also born with a downy underlying fur on their necks, called a ''mantle'', extending to mid-back. This gives them a mane or Mohawk-type appearance; this fur is shed as the Cheetah grows older. It has been speculated that this mane gives a Cheetah cub the appearance of the [[Ratel]], to scare away potential aggressors.

Death rate is very high during the early weeks, and up to 90% of the cubs are killed during this time by the Lion, hyenas or even by [[eagle]]s. Cubs leave their mother between thirteen and twenty months after birth. The Cheetah can live over twenty years, but its life is often short, for it loses its speed with old age.

Unlike males, females are solitary and tend to avoid each other, though some mother/daughter pairs have been known to continue for small periods of time. The Cheetah has a unique, well-structured social order. Females live alone except when they are raising cubs and they raise their cubs on their own. The first 18 months of a cub's life are important - cubs learn many lessons because survival depends on knowing how to hunt wild prey species and avoid other predators. At 18 months, the mother leaves the cubs, who then form a [[sibling]], or 'sib', group, that will stay together for another 6 months. At about 2 years, the female siblings leave the group, and the young males remain together for life. Life span is up to 12 years in wild, but up to 20 years in captivity.

===Territories===
====Males====
Males are very sociable and will group together for life, usually with their brothers in the same litter; although if a cub is the only male in the litter then two or three lone males may group up, or a lone male may join an existing group. These groups are called ''coalitions''. A coalition is six times more likely to obtain a [[territory (animal)|territory]] than a lone male, although studies have shown that coalitions keep their territories just as long as lone males - four to four and a half years.

Males are very territorial. Females' home ranges can be very large and trying to build a territory around several females' ranges is impossible to defend. Instead, males choose the points at which several of the females' home ranges overlap, creating a much smaller space, which can be properly defended against intruders while maximizing the chance of reproduction. Coalitions will try their utmost to maintain territories in order to find females with which they will mate. The size of the territory also depends on the available resources; depending on the part of Africa, the size of a male's territory can vary greatly from 37 [[square metre|km²]] to 160 km².

Males mark their territory by urinating on objects that stand out, such as trees, logs, or [[termite]] mounds. The whole coalition contributes to the scent. Males will attempt to kill any intruders and fights often result in serious injury or death.

====Females====

===Vocalizations===
The Cheetah cannot roar, but do have the following vocalizations: 

*'''Yipping''' - When a Cheetah attempts to find each another, or a mother tries to locate her cubs, it uses a high-pitched barking called yipping. The yips made by a Cheetah cub sound more like a bird chirping, and so are termed '''chirping'''.

*'''Churring''', '''stuttering''' or '''stutter-barking''' - This vocalization is emitted by a Cheetah during social meetings. A churr can be seen as a social invitation to other Cheetahs, an expression of interest, uncertainty, or appeasement or during meetings with the opposite sex (although each sex churrs for different reasons).

*'''Growling''' - This vocalization is often accompanied by hissing and spitting and is exhibited by the Cheetah during annoyance, or when faced with danger.

*'''Yowling''' - This is an escalated version of growling, usually displayed when danger worsens.

*'''Purring''' - This is made when the Cheetah is content, usually during pleasant social meetings (e.g. a mother with her cubs).

==Diet and hunting==
The Cheetah is a [[carnivore]], eating mostly [[mammal]]s under 40 kg (90 lb), including [[Thomson's Gazelle]] and the [[Impala]]. [[Wildebeest]]s and [[calves]] are hunted when the Cheetah hunts in groups. [[Guineafowl]] and [[hare]]s are also hunted. While the other big cats mainly hunt by night, the Cheetah is a [[diurnal (animal)|diurnal]] hunter. It hunts usually either early in the morning or later in the evening when it is not so hot, but there is still enough light - the Cheetah hunts by [[visual perception|vision]] rather than by [[scent]]. Prey is stalked to within 10-30 [[meter]]s (30-100 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]), then chased. The chase is usually over in less than a minute, and if the Cheetah fails to make a quick catch, it will often give up rather than waste energy. 

Another reason the Cheetah may give up is because running at such high speeds puts a great deal of strain on the Cheetah's body. The Cheetah's body temperature becomes so high that it would be deadly to continue - this is why the Cheetah is often seen resting even after it has caught its prey. If it is a hard chase, it sometimes needs to rest for half an hour or more. Roughly half of the chases are successful. The Cheetah kills its prey by tripping it during the chase, then biting it on the underside of the throat to suffocate it, for the Cheetah is not strong enough to break the necks of the [[gazelle]]s it mainly hunts. The bite may also puncture a vital artery in the neck. Then the Cheetah proceeds to devour its catch as quickly as possible before the kill is taken by stronger predators.

==Habitat==
[[Image:Serengeti_Cheetah.jpg|thumb|right|275px|A Cheetah in [[Serengeti National Park]], [[Tanzania]]]]
The Cheetah thrives in areas with vast expanses of land where prey is abundant. In [[Namibia]], it has been found in a variety of habitats, including [[grassland]]s, [[savannah]]s, dense [[vegetation]], and mountainous terrain. Ninety-five percent live on commercial [[agriculture|farms]]. The Cheetah is found in the wild primarily in Africa, but in the past its range extended into [[India]]. Conservationists using camera traps have recently discovered surviving populations in [[Iran]] and are taking steps to protect them. In much of its former range, it was [[domestication|domesticated]] by [[aristocracy|aristocrat]]s and used to hunt [[antelope]]s in much the same way as is still done with members of the [[greyhound]] group of dogs. Aside from an estimated 200 Cheetahs living in Iran ([[Khorasan]] Province), the distribution of the Cheetah is now limited to Africa. There are 5 [[subspecies]] of cheetah in the genus ''Acinonyx'': four in Africa and one in Iran. The endangered subspecies ''Acinonyx jubatus venaticus'' lives in Asia (Iran). In 1990, there were reports in the [[Times of India]] of a Cheetah sighting in [[East India|eastern India]]. There is a chance some Cheetahs remain in India, though it is doubtful. There have also been reports of Asiatic cheetahs in the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] Province of [[Pakistan]], though these continue to be unverified. The Cheetah prefers to live in an open [[biotope]], such as semi-[[desert]], [[prairie]], and thick brush.

==Genetics==
[[Image:CheetahWithCub.jpg|thumb|left|Cheetah mother with cub]]

The Cheetah has unusually low [[heredity|genetic]] variability and high abnormal [[sperm]] count. Skin grafts between non-related Cheetahs illustrate this point in that there is no rejection of the donor skin. It is thought that it went through a prolonged period of [[inbreeding]] following a [[genetic bottleneck]] during the last [[ice age]]. It probably evolved in Africa during the [[Miocene]] epoch (26 million to 7.5 million years ago), before [[migration|migrating]] to Asia. New research by a team led by Warren Johnson and Stephen O’Brien of the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity ([[National Cancer Institute]] in Frederick, [[Maryland]], [[United States|US]]) has recently placed the last common ancestor of all existing cat species as living in Asia c. 11 million years ago, which may lead to revision and refinement of existing ideas about Cheetah evolution. Now-extinct species include: ''Acinonyx pardinensis'' ([[Pliocene]] epoch), much larger than the modern Cheetah and found in Europe, India, and China; ''Acinonyx intermedius'' (mid-[[Pleistocene]] period), found over the same range. The extinct genus ''[[Miracinonyx]]'' was extremely Cheetah-like, but recent DNA analysis has shown that ''Miracinonyx inexpectatus'', ''Miracinonyx studeri'', and ''Miracinonyx trumani'' (early to late Pleistocene epoch), found in North America and called the "North American Cheetah" are not true cheetahs, instead being close relatives to the [[Cougar]].

===Subspecies===
For a short time it was thought that there were six subspecies of cheetah, but ''Acinonyx rex'' - the King Cheetah (see below) - was abandoned after it was discovered the variation was only a recessive gene. The subspecies ''Acinonyx jubatus guttatus'' - the Woolly Cheetah - may also have been a variation due to a recessive gene.  The current five sub-species of ''Acinonyx jubatus'' are:
* ''[[Acinonyx jubatus hecki]]'' - [[West Africa]].
* ''[[Acinonyx jubatus jubatus]]'' - [[Southern Africa]].
* ''[[Acinonyx jubatus raineyii]]'' - [[East Africa]].
* ''[[Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii]]'' - [[Central Asia]].
* ''[[Acinonyx jubatus venaticus]]'' - [[Iran]].

==Morphs and variations==
===King Cheetah===
{{main|King Cheetah}}

The [[King Cheetah]] was first noted in [[Zimbabwe]] in 1926. In 1927, the naturalist [[Reginald Innes Pocock]] declared it a separate species, but reversed this decision in 1939 due to lack of evidence. In 1928, a skin purchased by Lord Rothschild was found to be intermediate in pattern between the King Cheetah and spotted Cheetah and Abel Chapman considered it to be a color form of the spotted Cheetah. 22 such skins were found between 1926 and 1974. Since 1927, the King Cheetahs was reported 5 more times in the wild. Although strangely marked skins had come from Africa, a live King Cheetah was not photographed until 1974 in [[South Africa]]'s [[Kruger National Park]]. [[Cryptozoology|Cryptozoologists]] Paul and Lena Bottriell photographed one during an expedition in 1975. They also managed to obtain stuffed specimens. It appeared larger than a spotted Cheetah and its fur had a different texture. There was another wild sighting in 1986 — the first for 7 years. By 1987, 38 specimens had been recorded, many from pelts.

Its species status was resolved in 1981 when king cheetahs were born at the De Wildt Cheetah Center in South Africa. In May 1981, two spotted sisters gave birth there and each litter contained one king cheetah. The sisters had both mated with a wild-caught male from the [[Transvaal]] area (where King Cheetahs had been recorded). Further King Cheetahs were later born at the Center. This mutation has been reported in Zimbabwe, Botswana and in the northern part of South Africa's former Transvaal province.

===Other variations===
Other rare color morphs included speckled cheetahs, [[melanism|melanistic]] cheetahs, [[albinism|albino]] cheetahs and grayish cheetahs. Most were reported in Indian cheetahs, particularly in captive specimens kept for hunting.

The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] of India, Jahangir, recorded having a white cheetah presented to him in 1608. In the memoirs of Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri, the Emperor says that in the third year of his reign: ''Raja Bir Singh Deo brought a white cheetah to show me. Although other sorts of creatures, both birds and beasts have white varieties .... I had never seen a white cheetah. Its spots, which are (usually) black, were of a blue colour, and the whiteness of the body also inclined to blue-ishness.'' This suggests a chinchilla mutation which restricts the amount of pigment on the hair shaft. Although the spots were formed of black pigment, the less dense pigmentation gives a hazy, grayish effect. As well as Jahangir's white cheetah at Agra, a report of "incipient albinism" has come from Beaufort West according to Guggisberg.

In a letter to "Nature in East Africa", HF Stoneham reported a melanistic cheetah (black with ghost markings) in the Trans-Nzoia District of [[Kenya]] in 1925. Vesey Fitzgerald saw a melanistic cheetah in [[Zambia]] in the company of a spotted cheetah. Red (erythristic) cheetahs have dark tawny spots on a golden background. Cream (isabelline) cheetahs have pale red spots on a pale background. Some desert region cheetahs are unusually pale; probably they are better-camouflaged and therefore better hunters and more likely to breed and pass on their paler coloration. Blue (Maltese or gray) cheetahs have variously been described as white cheetahs with gray-blue spots (chinchilla) or pale grey cheetahs with darker grey spots (Maltese mutation). A cheetah with hardly any spots was shot in Tanzania on 1921 (Pocock), it had only a few spots on the neck and back and these were unusually small.

==Woolly cheetah==
Woolly cheetahs were reported in the 19th century as a separate species of cheetah that had longer, denser fur. Several specimens were obtained. It may be that creatures were in fact the same species as the present-day cheetah, but with a genetic disposition to long fur. The woolly cheetah has, in any case, vanished.

In 1877, Philip Sclater of the [[Zoological Society of London]] wrote of a recent acquisition by the zoo: ''It presents generally the appearance of a cheetah, but is thicker in the body, and has shorter and stouter limbs, and a much thicker tail. When adult it will probably be considerably larger than the cheetah, and is larger even now than our three specimens of that animal. The fur is much more woolly and dense than in the cheetah, as is particularly noticeable on the ears, mane and tail.

Woolly cheetahs were observed to have thicker bodies and stouter limbs than normal cheetahs, although this may have been a misleading appearance given by the long hair. They had dense, woolly hair especially on the tail and neck where it formed a ruff or mane. The long fur made the normal spotted cheetah pattern indistinct and the animals appeared pale fawn with dark, round blotches. 

Long hair in cats is due to [[recessive gene]]s, so the pertinent gene here may still be present in a few individuals. However, the cheetah gene pool is unusually uniform so the lack of modern longhaired cheetahs means the mutation has probably vanished.

The whole of the body is of a pale [[isabelline]] color, rather paler on the belly and lower parts, but covered all over, including the belly, with round dark fulvous blotches. There are no traces of the black spots which are so conspicuous in all of the varieties of the cheetah which I have seen, nor of the characteristic black line between the mouth and eye.''

Although described as blotched, a painting of the cheetah depicts it as freckled and the artist mistakenly added "eyeliner" markings which were not present in the actual specimen. In 1878, a second woolly cheetah was reported as a preserved specimen in the South African Museum. Both the London and South African specimens had come from Beaufort West. In 1884, a third skin was obtained from the same area, though this had more distinct spots and was a little smaller. By the 1880s, the trophy hunters had eliminated the woolly cheetah.

In Harmsworth Natural History (1910), R Lydekker wrote of the "hunting leopard" or "chita" (old spelling of cheetah) in which he distinguished it from the "normal" cheetah: "The hunting leopard of South Africa has been stated to differ from the Indian animal in its stouter build, thicker tail, and denser and more woolly fur, the longest hairs occurring on the neck, ears, and tail. This woolly hunting leopard was regarded by its describer as a distinct species (''Cynaelurus lanius''), but it is, at most, only a local race, of which the proper name is ''C. jubatus guttatus''."

==Economic importance==
[[Image:Cheetah lying down & looking around.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Lying cheetah]]
Cheetah fur was formerly regarded as a [[status symbol]]. Today, cheetahs have a growing [[Economic system|economic]] importance for [[ecotourism]] and they are also found in [[zoo]]s. Because cheetahs are far less aggressive than other big cats, cubs are sometimes sold as [[pet]]s.  

Cheetahs were formerly, and are sometimes still, hunted because many farmers believe that they eat [[livestock]]. When the species came under threat, numerous campaigns were launched to try to educate farmers and encourage them to conserve cheetahs. Recent evidence has shown that if cheetahs can avoid it they will not attack and eat livestock, preferring their wild prey. However, they have no problem with including farmland as part of their territory, leading to conflict.

[[Ancient Egypt]]ians often kept them as pets. They were also tamed and trained for hunting. Cheetahs would be taken to hunting fields in low-sided carts or by horseback, hooded and blindfolded, and kept on leashes while dogs flushed out their prey. When the prey was near enough, the cheetahs would be released and their blindfolds removed. This tradition was passed on to the ancient [[Persians]] and carried to [[India]]. This practice continued into the twentieth century by Indian princes. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance, their use as pets spreading just as their hunting skills were. Other such princes and kings kept them as pets, including [[Gengis Khan]] and [[Charlemagne]], who boasted of having kept cheetahs within their palace grounds. As recently as the 1930s the Emperor of [[Abyssinia]], [[Haile Selassie]], was often photographed leading a cheetah by a leash.

==Conservation status==
Cheetah cubs have a high [[mortality rate]] due to genetic factors and predation by carnivores in competition with the cheetah, such as the lion and hyena. Some biologists now believe that they are too inbred to flourish as a species.

Cheetahs are included on the [[IUCN]] list: [[vulnerable species]] (African subspecies threatened, Asiatic subspecies in critical situation) as well as on the US ESA: [[threatened species]] - Appendix I of [[CITES]] (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). Approximately 12,400 cheetahs remain in the wild in 25 African countries; [[Namibia]] has the most, with about 2,500. Another 50-60 critically endangered [[Asiatic Cheetah]]s are thought to remain in [[Iran]]. There have been successful breeding programs, including the use of [[in-vitro fertilization]], in zoos around the world.

Founded in [[Namibia]] in 1990, the [[Cheetah Conservation Fund]]'s mission is to be an internationally recognised centre of excellence in research and education on cheetahs and their eco-systems, working with all stakeholders to achieve best practice in the conservation and management of the world's cheetahs.

The [[Cheetah Conservation Foundation]] was set up in [[1993]] for the cheetah protection. It is based in [[South Africa]].

==Cultural references to cheetahs==
* In [[Titian]]'s ''Bacchus and Ariadne'' (1523), the god's [[chariot]] is borne by cheetahs (which were used as hunting animals in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]]). Cheetahs were often associated with the god Dionysus, whom the Romans called Bacchus.
