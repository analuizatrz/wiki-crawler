'''Sir Granville de Laune Ryrie''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Volunteer Decoration|VD]] ([[1 July]] [[1865]] – [[2 October]] [[1937]]) was an [[Australia]]n soldier and politician who served in the [[Second Boer War]] and the [[First World War]].

==Early life==
Ryrie was born in [[Michelago, New South Wales]] on [[1 July]] [[1865]], into a farming family. His father was Alexander Ryrie, a grazier and member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] (1880-91) and of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] (1892-1909), and his mother was Charlotte, née Faunce, both born in [[New South Wales]]. Granville was educated at [[Mittagong, New South Wales|Mittagong]] and at [[The King's School, Sydney]]; he later became a [[stockman|jackaroo]], and eventually managed his own property. He was also a good heavyweight boxer. In 1896 he married Mary, whom Ryrie nicknamed Mick.

Ryrie volunteered to serve in the [[Second Boer War]], from 1899 to 1902. He was selected to serve in one of the Bushmen's Contingents, groups of [[light horse]]men, because of his skills on horseback and in shooting. During the war he was promoted to the position of honorary Major.

==Pre-war political career==
In April 1906, Ryrie was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as member for [[electoral district of Queanbeyan|Queanbeyan]], where he served until 1910. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[Australian House of Representatives]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910 election]], but was successfully elected to the [[Division of North Sydney]] at a by-election on [[11 March]] [[1911]], following the death of  [[George Edwards (Australian politician)|Hon. George Edwards]].

==Military career==

At the beginning of the [[First World War]], Ryrie was promoted to [[Brigadier-General]], and was given command of the [[Australian 2nd Light Horse Brigade]], part of the [[Anzac Mounted Division]]. He was in the [[Suez canal]] area and then joined the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] on [[19 May]] [[1915]], where he was wounded twice. He was later moved to [[Egypt]] and [[London]] for respite, but rejoined the Brigade for the [[Sinai and Palestine campaign]]. He was involved in the famous charge of the light horse in the [[Third Battle of Gaza]], in which Australian forces [[Battle of Beersheba|captured the town of Beersheba]]. In December 1918 he was made commander of the [[Australian Mounted Division]], and in April [[1919]] was put in charge of the [[Australian Imperial Force]]. He was promoted [[Major General]] in September.

==Post-war career==

After returning to Australia, Ryrie remained the Member for North Sydney. In 1920, he was made an Assistant Minister for Defence in the [[Fifth Hughes Ministry|ministry]] of [[Billy Hughes]], assisting Senator [[George Pearce]]. At the [[Australian federal election, 1922|1922 election]] he was elected to the newly created [[Division of Warringah]], where he served until [[1927]], when he was appointed Australia's High Commissioner to the [[United Kingdom]] in [[London]]. He was also an Australian delegate to the [[League of Nations]].

Ryrie returned to Australia in [[1932]], and died in [[Sydney]] on [[2 October]] [[1937]], survived by his wife and children. He was buried at Michelago after a state service at St Andrew's Anglican Cathedral.

Micalago Station is still in the Ryrie family and is run by David Ryrie, Granvilles eldest grandson. David and his family still reside in the original homestead.

Ryrie Street in [[North Ryde]], Australia is named in his honour.
