'''Plutonium''' ({{pronEng|pluːˈtoʊniəm}}, symbol '''Pu,''' [[atomic number]] 94) is a rare [[radioactive]], [[metal]]lic [[chemical element]]. The most significant [[isotope]] of plutonium is <sup>239</sup>Pu, with a [[half-life]] of 24,100 years; this isotope is [[fissile]] and is used in most modern [[nuclear weapon]]s. [[Plutonium-239]] can be synthesized from natural [[uranium]]. 

The most stable isotope is <sup>244</sup>Pu, with a half-life of approximately 80 million years, long enough to be found in extremely small quantities in nature, making <sup>244</sup>Pu the most [[nucleon]]-rich <!--heaviest--> atom that naturally occurs in the [[Earth's crust]], albeit in small traces.<ref>{{Citation

Pu-239 is suitable for use in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Pu-238 is suitable for use in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s.

==Characteristics==
===Physical===
The metal has a bright, silver-like appearance at first, much like [[nickel]], but it [[oxidation | oxidizes]] very quickly to a dull gray.<ref name="WISER"/> It is about as hard and brittle as gray [[cast iron]] unless it is [[alloy]]ed with other metals to make it soft and ductile.<ref name="WISER"/> Although it is a metal, it is not a good conductor of [[thermal conductivity | heat]] or [[electrical conductivity | electricity]] like most other metals.<ref name="WISER">{{cite web

[[alpha decay|Alpha particle emission]], which is essentially the release of high-energy [[helium]] nuclei formed as a by-product of fission, is the most common form of [[radiation]] given off by plutonium.<ref name="NNDC"/>  Heat given off by these alpha particles make a mass of plutonium the size of a [[softball]] hot to the touch while a somewhat larger mass can boil a [[liter]] of water in a few minutes, although this varies with isotopic composition.<ref name="Heiserman1992"/>{{inote|page 338}}

[[Electrical resistivity]] of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal and oddly ''decreases'' as temperature is increased.{{inote|Miner1968p544}} Resistivity in fact continues to ''increase'' as temperature decreases to a maximum at 100&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], after which it rapidly decreases with lower temperature.<ref name="Miner1968p544"/> Radiation damage causes a steady increase of resistivity with time at around 20&nbsp;K with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.{{inote|Miner1968p544}} 

Due to self-irradiation, plutonium fatigues throughout its crystal structure.<ref name="HeckerPlutonium" /> However, self-irradiation can also lead to [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] which counteracts some of the fatigue effects.

===Nuclear===
Plutonium is a radioactive [[actinide]] metal that, with  [[uranium]], is one of the few elements with one or more [[fissile]] [[isotope]]s.

[[Image:Plutonium ring.jpg|left|thumb|A ring of weapons-grade electrorefined plutonium.]]
The plutonium isotope <sup>239</sup>Pu can undergo nuclear fission if its nucleus is struck by a neutron, particularly a thermal [[neutron]].<ref name="Stwertka1998"/> The fission of <sup>239</sup>Pu itself releases neutrons that bombard other <sup>239</sup>Pu atoms, which fission and release more neutrons and so on in a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This isotope has a positive multiplication factor (k), which means that if the metal is present in sufficient mass and with an appropriate geometry (e.g., a compressed sphere), it can form a [[critical mass]].  During fission, a tiny fraction of the nuclear material (i.e., the [[mass defect]]) is converted directly into a large amount of energy; a kilogram of <sup>239</sup>Pu can produce an explosion equivalent to 20,000&nbsp;tons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]].<ref name="Heiserman1992"/> It is this energy that makes <sup>239</sup>Pu useful in [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear reactor|reactors]]. 

The presence of the isotope <sup>240</sup>Pu in a material limits its nuclear bomb potential since it emits neutrons randomly, increasing the difficulty of accurately initiating the chain reaction at the desired instant and thus reducing the bomb's reliability and power.<ref>{{cite book

The isotopes of plutonium range in [[mass number]] from 228 to 247.<ref name="NNDC"/> The primary [[decay mode]]s before the most stable isotope, <sup>244</sup>Pu, are [[spontaneous fission]] and [[alpha emission]]; the primary mode after is [[beta emission]].<ref name="NNDC"/> The primary [[decay product]]s before <sup>244</sup>Pu are [[uranium]] and [[neptunium]] isotopes (neglecting the wide range of daughter nuclei created by fission processes), and the primary products after are [[americium]] isotopes.<ref name="NNDC"/> <sup>241</sup>Pu is the [[parent isotope]] of the [[neptunium decay series]], decaying to [[americium]]-241 via β or electron emission.<ref name="Heiserman1992"/>{{inote|page 340}}

<sup>238</sup>Pu and <sup>239</sup>Pu are the most-widely synthesized isotopes.<ref name="Heiserman1992"/> Plutonium-239 is synthesized via the following reaction using uranium (U) and neutrons (n) via beta decay (β<sup>-</sup>):<ref name="Greenwood1997p1259">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=1259}}</ref>
:<sup>238</sup>U + n → <sup>239</sup>U (half-life 23.5 min; &beta;<sup>-</sup>) → <sup>239</sup>Np (2.36&nbsp;days; &beta;<sup>-</sup>) → <sup>239</sup>Pu (24,100 years)
In other words, neutrons from the fission of <sup>235</sup>U are [[neutron capture|captured]] by <sup>238</sup>U nuclei to form form <sup>239</sup>U; a [[beta decay]] adds a proton to form <sup>239</sup>[[Neptunium|Np]] (half-life 2.3&nbsp;days) and another beta decay forms <sup>239</sup>Pu, which has a half-life of 24,000 years.<ref name="Emsley2001"/> <sup>238</sup>Pu is synthesized by bombarding <sup>238</sup>U with [[deuteron]]s (d, the nuclei of heavy [[hydrogen]]) in the following reaction:<ref name="Heiserman1992"/>{{inote|page 339}}
:<sup>238</sup>U(d,2n)<sup>238</sup>Np → <sup>238</sup>Pu + &beta;<sup>-</sup>
In this equation, a deuteron hitting <sup>238</sup>U produces two neutrons and neptunium-238. The <sup>238</sup>Np spontaneously decays by emitting negative beta particles to form <sup>238</sup>Pu.

===Allotropes===
[[Image:Pu-phases.png|thumb|A diagram of the allotropes of plutonium at ambient pressure]]

The presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult, as it changes state very readily. For example, the unalloyed α phase exists at room temperature and has machining characteristics similar to [[cast iron]] but transitions to the plastic and easy to work β phase at slightly higher temperatures.<ref name="Miner1968p542"/> The reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood; recent research has focused on constructing accurate computer models of the [[phase transition]]s.{{inote|Ambient pressure phase diagram of plutonium}} The &alpha; phase also possesses a low-[[Molecular symmetry|symmetry structure]], causing it to become progressively more brittle over time.<ref name="Baker1983"/> 

Plutonium in the delta phase normally exists in the 310 to 452&nbsp;°C range but is often [[alloy]]ed with a small percentage of [[gallium]], [[aluminium]], or [[cerium]] to increase phase stability at room temperature and thereby enhance workability and allows it to be [[welding|welded]].<ref name="Miner1968p542"/> <!-- NEEDS CITE Interestingly, in fission weapons, the explosive [[shock wave]]s used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual delta phase plutonium to the denser alpha phase, significantly helping to achieve [[supercriticality]]. /NEEDS CITE -->

===Compounds and chemistry===
[[Image:Plutonium in solution.jpg|thumb|right|370px|Image showing colors of various oxidation states of Pu in solution on the left and colors of only one Pu oxidation state (IV) on the right in solutions containing different anions.]]
At room temperature, pure plutonium is silvery in color but gives a yellow tarnish when [[oxidation|oxidized]].<ref name="Heiserman1992"/>{{inote|page 339; ref for alpha form, which is the most common at room temps}} The element displays four common ionic [[oxidation state]]s in aqueous solution<ref name="CRC2006p4-27"/> and one rare one:
*Pu(III), as Pu<sup>3+</sup> (blue lavender)
*Pu(IV), as Pu<sup>4+</sup> (yellow brown)
*Pu(V), as PuO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> (pink?)<ref group=note>The PuO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> ion is unstable in solution and will disproportionate into Pu<sup>4+</sup> and PuO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>; the Pu<sup>4+</sup> will then oxidize the remaining PuO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> to PuO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>, being reduced in turn to Pu<sup>3+</sup>. Thus, aqueous solutions of plutonium tend over time towards a mixture of Pu<sup>3+</sup> and PuO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>.

Metallic plutonium is produced by reacting plutonium fluoride with either [[barium]] or [[lithium]] at 1200&nbsp;°C.<ref name="Emsley2001"/> It is attacked by [[acid]]s, [[oxygen]], and steam but not by [[alkalis]] and dissolves easily in concentrated [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]], [[hydroiodic acid|hydroiodic]] and [[perchloric acid]]s.<ref name="Miner1968p545">{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p=545}}</ref> Molten metal must be kept in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction with air.<ref name="Miner1968p542">{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p=542}}</ref> At 135°C the metal will ignite in air and will explode if placed in [[carbon tetrachloride]].<ref name="Emsley2001"/> 

[[Image:Plutonium pyrophoricity.jpg|thumb|left|Plutonium pyrophoricity can cause it to look like a glowing ember under certain conditions.]]
Plutonium is an active metal. In moist air or moist [[argon]], the metal oxidizes rapidly, producing a mixture of [[oxide]]s and [[hydride]]s.<ref name="WISER"/> If the metal is exposed long enough to a limited amount of water vapor, an olive-green powdery surface coating of [[Plutonium(IV) oxide | PuO<sub>2</sub>]] is formed.<ref name="WISER"/> Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms just PuO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="Miner1968p545"/> 

With this coating, the metal is [[Pyrophoricity | pyrophoric]], meaning it can ignite spontaneously, so plutonium metal is usually handled in an inert, dry atmosphere of [[nitrogen]] or argon.<ref name="WISER"/> Oxygen retards the effects of moisture and acts as a [[Passivation | passivating]] agent.<ref name="WISER"/>

Plutonium reacts readily with oxygen, forming PuO and PuO<sub>2</sub>, as well as intermediate oxides;<ref name="CRC2006p4-27"/> plutonium oxide fills 40% more volume than plutonium metal.<ref name="Emsley2001"/> It reacts with the [[halogen]]s, giving rise to compounds such as PuX<sub>3</sub> where X can be F, Cl, Br or I; [[Plutonium fluoride|PuF<sub>4</sub>]] is also seen.<ref name="CRC2006p4-27"/> The following oxyhalides are observed: PuOCl, PuOBr and PuOI.<ref name="CRC2006p4-27"/> It will react with [[carbon]] to form PuC, nitrogen to form [[Plutonium nitride|PuN]] and [[silicon]] to form PuSi<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="CRC2006p4-27"/> 

[[Crucible]]s used to contain plutonium need to be able to withstand its strongly [[reduction (chemistry)|reducing]] properties.<ref name="Miner1968p542"/> Refractory metals such as [[tantalum]] and [[tungsten]] along with the more stable oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides and silicides can tolerate this, however.<ref name="Miner1968p542"/> Melting in an [[Electric arc furnace]] can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible.<ref name="Miner1968p542"/>

Plutonium can form [[alloy]]s and intermediate compounds with most other metals. Exceptions include [[lithium]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]] of the [[alkali metal]]s; [[barium]], [[calcium]] and [[strontium]] of the [[alkaline earth metal]]s; and [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]] of the [[rare earth metal]]s.<ref name="Miner1968p545"/> Partial exceptions include the [[refractory metal]]s [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[niobium]], [[tantalum]] and [[tungsten]], which, while soluble in liquid plutonium and insoluble or only slightly so in solid plutonium.<ref name="Miner1968p545"/>

===Discovery===
[[Image:Seaborg Geiger Gilman Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Glenn Seaborg]] at the Geiger Counter, 301 [[Gilman Hall]], Berkeley, California, where he discovered plutonium.]]
Plutonium (<sup>238</sup>Pu) was first produced and isolated on December 14, 1940, and chemically identified on February 23, 1941, by Dr. [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], [[Edwin McMillan|Edwin M.

A paper documenting the discovery was prepared by the team and sent to the journal ''[[Physical Review]]'' in March 1941.<ref name="Emsley2001"/> The paper was withdrawn before publication after the discovery that an isotope of the new element (<sup>239</sup>Pu) could undergo [[nuclear fission]] in a way that might be useful in an [[atomic bomb]].

Chemists at the [[University of Chicago]] began to study the newly-manufactured radioactive element. The [[George Herbert Jones Laboratory]] at the university was the site where, on August 18, 1942, a trace quantity of this new element was isolated and measured for the first time. About 50&nbsp;micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1&nbsp;microgram was isolated.<ref name="Miner1968p541">{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p=541}}</ref> This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight.<ref group="note">Room 405 of the building was named a [[National Historic Landmark]] in May 1967.</ref><ref name="uchicago">{{cite web | title=Room 405, George Herbert Jones Laboratory | publisher=National Park Service | url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=735&ResourceType=Building}}</ref> In November 1943 some plutonium trifluoride was [[reduction|reduced]] to create the first sample of plutonium metal; a few micrograms of metallic beads.<ref name="Miner1968p541"/> Enough plutonium was produced to make it the first synthetically-made element to be visible with the unaided eye.<ref name="Miner1968p540">{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p=540}}</ref>

The nuclear properties of plutonium-239 were also studied; researchers found that when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially-fast [[chain reaction]]. This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if a [[critical mass]] of the isotope is assembled in one place.<ref name="Emsley2001"/>

During [[World War II]] the U.S. government set-up  the [[Manhattan Project]], which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb. The first production reactor that made plutonium-239 was the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]]. It went online in 1943 and was built at a facility in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], [[Tennessee]] that later became the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].<ref name="Emsley2001"/><ref group="note">During the Manhattan Project, plutonium was also often referred to as simply "49":. the number 4 was for the last digit in 94 (atomic number of plutonium), and 9 was for the last digit in Pu-239, the weapon-grade fissile isotope used in nuclear bombs.

Later, large (200&nbsp;MW) [[nuclear reactor|reactors]] were set up at the [[Hanford Site]] near [[Richland, Washington]], for the mass production of plutonium. Plutonium was produced using uranium that was bombarded by neutrons. The [[fuel rod]]s this reaction took place in were removed after six months and [[nitric acid]] was used to extract the plutonium as [[plutonium nitrate]]. 

Six kilograms of plutonium were detonated in the first atomic bomb test, codenamed [[Trinity test|"Trinity"]], on July 16, 1945 near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]].<ref name="Miner1968p541"/> Conventional explosives were used in the Trinity device to force pieces of plutonium into a critical mass that was immediately showered with neutrons from an initiator made of [[beryllium]] and [[polonium]].<ref name="Emsley2001"/> Together, this ensured a runaway chain reaction and explosion. 

[[Image:Hanford Site 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Hanford Site plutonium production reactors along the [[Columbia River]] during the Manhattan Project.]]
Plutonium was also used in the "[[Fat Man]]" atomic bomb dropped on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki, Japan]] on August 9, 1945. Fat Man's detonation was equivalent to several thousand tons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and killed 70,000 and wounded another 100,000.<ref name="Emsley2001"/><ref group=note>Fat Man's original target was [[Kokura]] but the city was obscured by clouds so the back-up city of Nagasaki was used. Kokura was re-scheduled for nuclear destruction on August 17th but was spared when the war ended before that.</ref> The "[[Little Boy]]" bomb dropped on [[Hiroshima]] three days earlier used [[uranium-235]], not plutonium. On August 11th, a second plutonium-based bomb was scheduled to be dropped on [[Kumagaya]] but was not ready in time; 6000 tons of conventional explosives were used to destroy the city instead.<ref name="Emsley2001"/> Japan capitulated on August 15th, effectively ending the war.

Large stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium were built up by both the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] during the [[Cold War]]. The U.S. reactors at Hanford and the [[Savannah River Site]] in South Carolina produced 103,000&nbsp;kg<ref>{{cite web|title=Plutonium: The first 50 years: United States plutonium production, acquisition, and utilization from 1944 to 1994| publisher=U.S. Department of Energy | url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/pu50yb.html#ZZ13 | date= September 1994 }} </ref> and an estimated 170,000&nbsp;kg of military-grade plutonium was produced in Russia.<ref>{{cite web | title=Safeguarding nuclear weapons-usable materials in Russia| url=http://docs.nrdc.org/nuclear/nuc_06129701a_185.pdf | author=Thomas B.

These so-called 'hydrogen bombs' are a variety of nuclear weapon that use what is in effect an atomic bomb to trigger the [[nuclear fusion]] of heavy [[hydrogen]] isotopes. Their destructive yield is commonly in the millions of tons of TNT equivalent compared with the thousands of tons of TNT equivalent of atomic devices.{{harv|Emsley|2001}}</ref> Each year about 20,000&nbsp;kg of the element is still produced as a by-product of the [[nuclear power]] industry.<ref name="CRC2006p4-27">{{harvnb|CRC|2006|p=4-27}}</ref> As much as 1000&nbsp;tonnes of plutonium may be in storage with more than 200&nbsp;tonnes of that either inside or extracted from nuclear weapons.<ref name="Emsley2001"/> 

Since the end of the Cold War, these stockpiles have become a focus of [[nuclear proliferation]] concerns. In the U.S., some plutonium extracted from dismantled nuclear weapons is melted to form glass logs of plutonium oxide that weigh two&nbsp;tonnes.<ref name="Emsley2001"/> The glass consists of [[borosilicate]]s mixed with as [[cadmium]] and [[gadolinium]], which are all powerful neutron absorbers.<ref group=note>[[Gadolinium zirconium oxide]] ({{chem|Gd|2|Zr|2|O|7}}) has been studied because it could hold plutonium for up to 30 million years.{{harv|Emsley|2001}}</ref> These logs are planned to be encased in [[stainless steel]] and stored as much as 4&nbsp;km underground in bore holes that will be back-filled with [[concrete]].<ref name="Emsley2001"/> As of 2008, the only facility in the U.S. that is scheduled to store plutonium in this way is the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]], which is about {{convert|100|mi|km}} north-east of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. A great deal of local and state opposition exists against this plan.

===Medical experimentation===
During the initial years after the discovery of plutonium, when its biological and physical properties were very poorly understood, a series of [[human radiation experiments]] were performed by the U.S. government and by private organizations acting on its behalf. During and after the end of World War II, scientists working on the Manhattan Project and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted studies of the effects of plutonium on laboratory animals and human subjects. In the case of human subjects, this involved injecting solutions containing (typically) five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill, or to have a life expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition. 

These eighteen injections were made without the [[informed consent]] of those patients and were not done with the belief that the injections would heal their conditions; rather, they were used to develop diagnostic tools for determining the uptake of plutonium in the body for use in developing safety standards for people working with plutonium during the course of developing nuclear weapons.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Los Alamos Science|title=The Human Plutonium Injection Experiments|url=http://library.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/getfile?00326640.pdf|accessdate=2006-06-06|year=1995|author=William Moss and Roger Eckhardt |volume=23 |pages=177–233 |format=PDF}}</ref>

The episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the [[Hippocratic Oath]], and has been sharply criticised as failing "both the test of our national values and the test of humanity."<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|title=Injected! (Review of Eileen Welsome's ''The Plutonium Files'')|url=http://www.thebulletin.org/article.php?art_ofn=nd99longworthf|accessdate=2006-06-06|year=1999|author=R.C. Longworth}}</ref> More sympathetic commentators have noted that while it was definitely a breach in trust and ethics, "the effects of the plutonium injections were not as damaging to the subjects as the early news stories painted, nor were they so inconsequential as many scientists, then and now, believe."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Michael S. Yesley |title='Ethical Harm' and the Plutonium Injection Experiments |journal=Los Alamos Science |volume=23 |year=1995 |pages=280–283, on 283 |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/pubs/00326649.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

==Applications==
===Nuclear weapons===
[[Image:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|The [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan]] in 1945 had a plutonium core.]]
The isotope <sup>239</sup>Pu is a key [[fissile]] component in [[nuclear weapon]]s, due to its ease of fissioning and availability. Encasing the bomb's sphere of plutonium in a [[Nuclear weapon design|tamper]] decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]] by [[neutron reflector | reflecting escaping neutrons]] back into the plutonium core. This reduces the amount of plutonium needed to reach criticality from 16&nbsp;kg to 10&nbsp;kg, which is a sphere with a diameter of 10&nbsp;cm.<ref>{{cite book|title=Physics for Radiation Protection|last=Martin|first=James E.|pages=532}}</ref> This critical mass is about a third of <sup>235</sup>U.<ref name="Heiserman1992"/> 

The Manhattan Project's "[[Fat Man]]" type plutonium bombs, using explosive compression of Pu to significantly higher densities than normal, were able to function with plutonium cores of only 6.2&nbsp;kg.<ref group=note>Much of the information about the plutonium in the [[Fat Man]] bomb comes from reports of the criticality accidents of [[Harry K. Daghlian, Jr.]] and [[Louis Slotin]], both of whom died after conducting experiments with plutonium bomb cores. See http://members.tripod.com/~Arnold_Dion/Daghlian/accident.html.</ref> Complete detonation may be achieved through the use of an additional neutron source (often from a small amount of fusion fuel).  The Fat Man bomb had an explosive yield of 21 kilotons. (See also [[Nuclear weapon design#Enriched materials|nuclear weapon design]].)

At one time nuclear fusion explosives were seriously considered to economically excavate large inter-oceanic canals and in other large earth-moving operations.<ref name="Miner1968p545"/> Under those plans, plutonium would likely have been used to initiate the fusion reaction. These plans were abandoned after a negative public perception of [[nuclear fallout]] grew.

===Power source===
The isotope [[plutonium-238]] (<sup>238</sup>Pu) has a half-life of 88 years and emits a large amount of [[thermal energy]] as it decays without harmful [[gamma ray]]s. Being an [[Alpha particle|alpha]] emitter, it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding. In fact, one [[kilogram]] of plutonium-238 can generate 22&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[kilowatt-hour]]s of heat energy.<ref name="Heiserman1992"/>{{inote|page 338}}

[[Image:Plutonium pellet.jpg|left|thumb|A pellet of plutonium-238, glowing due to [[blackbody radiation]], used for [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s.]]
These characteristics make it well-suited for electrical power generation for devices which must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime. It is therefore used in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s such as those powering the [[Cassini probe|Cassini]], [[Voyager program|Voyager]] and [[New Horizons]] space probes. Earlier versions of the same technology powered the [[ALSEP]] and [[EASEP]] systems including [[seismology|seismic]] experiments on the [[Apollo 14]] Moon mission.<ref name="Emsley2001"/>  

Plutonium-238 has also been used successfully to power artificial heart [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]]s, to reduce the risk of repeated surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theodoregray.com/periodictable/Elements/094/index.html |title=Theodore Gary's periodic table:Plutonium}}</ref> It has been largely replaced by [[lithium]]-based [[primary cell]]s, but as of 2003 there were somewhere between 50 and 100 plutonium-powered pacemakers still implanted and functioning in living patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orau.org/PTP/collection/Miscellaneous/pacemaker.htm |title=Plutonium Powered Pacemaker (1974) |publisher=Orau.org |date= |accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref> This isotope was also used to heat [[Scuba]] suits.<ref name="Miner1968p545"/> Plutonium-238 mixed with [[beryllium]] is used to generate neutrons for research purposes.<ref name="Emsley2001"/>
<br clear=all/>

===Use of plutonium waste===
In 2002, the [[United States Department of Energy]] took possession of 34&nbsp;tonnes of excess weapons-grade plutonium stockpiles from the [[United States Department of Defense]], and as of early 2003 was considering converting several nuclear power plants in the U.S. from [[enriched uranium]] fuel to mixed oxides ([[MOX fuel|MOX]]) of uranium and plutonium as a means of disposing of plutonium stocks. Mox fuel is used in [[fast breeder reactor]]s and consists of 60&nbsp;kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after 4 years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements).<ref name="Emsley2001"/>  

Efficiencies are also attained through [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]]: A fuel rod is reprocessed after 3 years of use to remove waste products, which by then account for 3% of the total weight of the rods.<ref name="Emsley2001"/> Any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those 3 years are left and the rod goes back into production.<ref group=note>Breakdown of plutonium in a spent nuclear fuel rod: <sup>239</sup>Pu (~58%), <sup>240</sup>Pu (24%), <sup>241</sup>Pu (11%), <sup>242</sup>Pu (5%), and <sup>238</sup>Pu (2%). {{harv|Emsely|2001}}</ref>

==Precautions==
{{seealso|Plutonium in the environment}}
===Toxicity===

Isotopes and compounds of plutonium are toxic due to its radioactivity.<ref name="ATSDR">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR),  [http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp143.html Toxicological Profile for Plutonium], Draft for Public Comment, September 2007 (accessed May 22, 2008)</ref> While plutonium is sometimes described in media reports as "the most toxic substance known to man", from the standpoint of actual chemical or radiological [[toxicity]] this is incorrect.<ref>Bernard L. Cohen in ''Nuclear Engergy;'' Karl Otto Ott and Bernard I. Spinrad, eds. (New York: Plenum Press, 1985), pp. 355-365</ref><ref name="world-nuclear">[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf15.html Plutonium], World Nuclear Association, April 2008 (website accessed May/22/2008)</ref> When taken in by mouth, plutonium is less poisonous than if inhaled, since it is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion.<ref name="Emsley2001"/> The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the increase in lifetime cancer risk for inhaled plutonium as 3×10<sup>−8</sup>&nbsp;pCi<sup>−1</sup>.<ref> {{cite web| url= http://consolidationeis.doe.gov/PDFs/PlutoniumANLFactSheetOct2001.pdf| title=ANL human health fact sheet--plutonium| publisher=Argonne National Laboratory| date=October 2001| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref><ref group=note>This means that inhaling 1&nbsp;μCi, or about 2.5&nbsp;μg of reactor-grade plutonium is estimated to increase one's lifetime risk of developing cancer as a result of the exposure to 3%.</ref> 

When plutonium is absorbed into the body, it is excreted very slowly, with a [[biological half-life]] of 200 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radiological control technical training DOE-HDBK-1122-99 | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy| url=http://hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1122-04/part9of9.pdf }}</ref> Plutonium has a metallic taste.<ref>{{cite book

</ref>

Plutonium may be extremely dangerous when handled incorrectly. The [[alpha particle|alpha]] radiation it emits does not penetrate the skin, but can irradiate internal organs when plutonium is inhaled or ingested.<ref name="Emsley2001"/> Particularly at risk is the [[skeleton]], where it is likely to be absorbed by the bone surface, and the [[liver]], where it will likely collect and become concentrated.<ref name="Miner1968p545"/>

Other substances, including [[ricin]], [[tetrodotoxin]], [[botulinum]] toxin, and [[tetanus]] toxin, are fatal in doses of (sometimes far) under one milligram, and others (the [[nerve agent]]s, the [[amanita]] toxin) are in the range of a few milligrams. As such, plutonium is not unusual in terms of toxicity, even by inhalation. In addition, those substances are fatal in hours to days, whereas plutonium (and other cancer-causing radioactives) give an increased chance of illness decades in the future. Considerably larger amounts may cause acute [[radiation poisoning]] and death if ingested or inhaled; however, so far, no human is known to have immediately died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies.<ref name="world-nuclear"/>

===Disposal difficulties===
In contrast to naturally occurring radioisotopes such as [[radium]] or [[Carbon-14|C-14]], plutonium was manufactured, concentrated, and isolated in large amounts (hundreds of metric tons) during the [[Cold War]] for weapons production. These stockpiles, whether or not in weapons form, pose a significant problem because, unlike chemical or biological agents, no chemical process can destroy them. One proposal to dispose of surplus weapons-grade plutonium is to mix it with highly radioactive isotopes (e.g., spent reactor fuel) to deter handling by potential thieves or terrorists. Another is to mix it with uranium and use it to fuel nuclear power reactors (the ''mixed oxide'' or [[MOX]] approach). This would not only fission (and thereby destroy) much of the Pu-239, but also transmute a significant fraction of the remainder into Pu-240 and heavier isotopes that would make the resulting mixture useless for nuclear weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309050421/html/index.html|author=National Academy of Sciences, Committee on International Security and Arms Control|title=Management and Disposition of Excess Weapons Plutonium|year=1994}}</ref>

===Criticality potential===
[[Image:Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg|thumb|A simulated sphere of plutonium surrounded by neutron-reflecting [[tungsten carbide]] blocks in a re-enactment of Harry Daghlian's 1945 experiment.]]
Toxicity issues aside, care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach [[Critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]], particularly because plutonium's critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-235's.<ref name="Heiserman1992"/> A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and [[gamma ray]]s.<ref name="Miner1968p546">{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p=546}}</ref> Despite not being confined by external pressure as is required for a nuclear weapon, it will nevertheless heat itself and break whatever confining environment it is in. Shape is relevant; compact shapes such as spheres are to be avoided. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.<ref name="CRC2006p4-27"/> A weapon-scale nuclear explosion cannot occur accidentally, since it requires a greatly supercritical mass in order to explode rather than simply melt or fragment. However, a marginally critical mass will cause a lethal dose of radiation and has in fact done so in the past on several occasions.

[[Criticality accident]]s have occurred in the past, some of them with lethal consequences. Careless handling of tungsten carbide bricks around a 6.2 kg plutonium sphere resulted in a lethal dose of radiation at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] on August 21, 1945, when scientist [[Harry K. Daghlian, Jr.]] received a dose estimated to be 510 [[Roentgen equivalent man|rems]] (5.1 [[Sievert|Sv]]) and died 28 days later.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.lanl.gov/news/index.php/fuseaction/home.story/story_id/1054/view/print|title=Criticality accidents report issued|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|location=Los Alamos, New Mexico|accessdate=2008-11-16|year=2000|last=Roark|first=Kevin N.}}</ref> Nine months later, another Los Alamos scientist, [[Louis Slotin]], died from a similar accident involving a beryllium reflector and the same plutonium core (the so-called "[[demon core]]") that had previously claimed the life of Daghlian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanl.gov/history/people/R_Schreiber.shtml|title=Raemer Schreiber|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|location=Los Alamos, New Mexico|accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref> These incidents were fictionalized in the 1989 film ''[[Fat Man and Little Boy]]''. In December 1958, during a process of purifying plutonium at Los Alamos, a critical mass was formed in a mixing vessel, which resulted in the death of a crane operator.<ref name="CriticalityAccidents">{{cite journal|title=A Review of Criticality Accidents|id=LA-13638|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|location=Los Alamos, New Mexico|year=2000|page=16|last=McLaughlin|first=Thomas P.|coauthors=Monahan, Shean P.; Pruvost, Norman L.}}</ref> Other accidents of this sort have occurred in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Japan]], and many other countries.<ref name="CriticalityAccidents"/> (See [[List of nuclear accidents]].)

===Flammability===
Metallic plutonium is also a fire hazard, especially if the material is finely divided. It reacts chemically with oxygen and water, which may result in an accumulation of [[plutonium hydride]], a [[pyrophoric]] substance; that is, a material that will ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands considerably in size as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. Magnesium-oxide sand is the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a [[heat sink]], and also blocks off oxygen. There was a major plutonium-initiated fire at the [[Rocky Flats Plant]] near [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]] in 1969.<ref>David Albright and Kevin O'Neill (1999). ''[http://www.isis-online.org/publications/usfacilities/Rfpbrf.html The Lessons of Nuclear Secrecy at Rocky Flats]''. ISIS Issue Brief.</ref> To avoid these problems, special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry [[inert]] atmosphere is required.<ref>[http://www.hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081d.html#ZZ281 Primer on Spontaneous Heating and Pyrophoricity - Pyrophoric Metals - Plutonium], Department of Energy Handbook DOE-HDBK-1081-94, December 1994.
