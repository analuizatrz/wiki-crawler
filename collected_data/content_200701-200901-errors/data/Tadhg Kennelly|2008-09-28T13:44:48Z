'''Tadhg Kennelly''' (born [[1 July]] [[1981]]) is a former [[Gaelic football]] player from [[Listowel]], [[County Kerry]], who is now a backline [[Australian rules football]] player for the [[Sydney Swans]], in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL).

==Early and private life==
Kennelly was born in [[Listowel]] in 1981.  He is the son of [[Tim Kennelly]], a former [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] winner with [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]].[http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/kennellys_champion_irish_dad_dies_after_being_there_for_tadghsswansfairytale/2005/12/07/1133829661245.html].  Kennelly's firstname, [[Tadhg]] is often mispronounced as "Tie" in Australia, but is in fact pronounced "Tie-g".  

Tadhg grew up playing Gaelic football and was recognised as a highly talented underage player with [[Kerry GAA]]<ref>[http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2004/0326/sport/kfeyauauojid/ Kennelly to miss Swans' AFL opener | BreakingNews.ie<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In 1999, he agreed to play Australian rules with the Swans <ref>[http://listowelemmets.kerry.gaa.ie/historyoftheclub.html Listowel Emmets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <ref>[http://www.rte.ie/tv/ttv/thecafe/tadhgjoe.html/ RTE TV]</ref>.

==AFL career==

After his debut in 2001 (following elevation from the [[AFL Draft|rookie list]]), he now is a permanent fixture in the Sydney line-up as a dashing rebound defender, wearing the no. 17 guernsey. He was second (behind [[Leo Barry]]) for [[rebound (sports)|rebound]]s (77) from the defensive [[50-metre arc]] in 2004. Tadhg has become a high-profile member of the Swans outfit, well-known for his exciting play, his nationality and his "Talking With Tadhg" articles on the Swans' website.

Kennelly became the first [[Irishman]] to win an [[Australian Football League|AFL]] premiership medal in 2005, after playing all 26 games for the [[Sydney Swans]] that year. The hype surrounding Kennelly's appearance in the [[AFL Grand Final]] was so much that [[Network Ten]] sent out its usual game-day [[boundary rider (sport)|boundary rider]], [[Andrew Maher]], over to [[County Kerry]] to visit Tadhg's family for the week and watch the Grand Final with them.  Kennelly also appeared in the 2006 Grand Final, but the Swans lost 85-84 to the [[West Coast Eagles]].<ref>http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2006/0930/sport/cwqlsnauauid/ BreakingNews.ie report</ref>

In 2007 and 2008 after several seasons missing only a handful of games, Kennelly suffered the a series of serious leg and shoulder injuries which became major setbacks to his AFL career.  His knee buckled from a heavy tackle from the [[Melbourne Demons]] [[Byron Pickett]], causing an [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] tear and seeing him miss several matches and later matches due to complications.  In 2008, he again injured his knee, dislocating his knee cap and injuring his shoulder.  

He was selected in the Dream Team for the [[AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match]]<ref>http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/2008041512023030 Kennelly represents the world in AFL Tribute Match] from worldfootynews.com</ref>, but later withdrew due to injury.  He was quick to recover, however, and made an appearance for the Swans the following week, though again succumbed to the injury curse.  During the rest of 2008, Kennelly's shoulder continually dislocated during games and his unorthodox methods of popping it back in was the subject of much media interest.

==Return to Ireland==
Kennelly has expressed a desire to return home to Ireland and leave the [[Australian Football League|AFL]], as he would like to emulate the success of his father and win an [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] medal with his native county's team, [[Kerry GAA]].<ref>[http://www.kerrygaa.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=118&Itemid=2 Kerry GAA - Tadhg Kennelly to Return to Kerry Football<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
In December 2005, Kennelly's father [[Tim Kennelly|Tim]] died suddenly at age 51.[http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/kennellys_champion_irish_dad_dies_after_being_there_for_tadghsswansfairytale/2005/12/07/1133829661245.html]  It is believed his father's death may have some bearing on Kennelly's wish to return to Ireland.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/family-man-torn-between-home-and-blood-brothers/2006/09/09/1157222378362.html Family man torn between home and blood brothers - AFL - Sport - smh.com.au<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On the last day of August, 2006, Tadhg Kennelly ended months of speculation by announcing he would be staying on with the Swans for a further 3 years. Kennelly said that this would be his last AFL contract and that he would be returning to Ireland to live at the end of the three year contract.  In March 2008, Kennelly announced that he would "definitely" return to Ireland in 2009 to play with Kerry, as "I want to win an All-Ireland with Kerry".<ref>[http://www.kerrygaa.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=118&Itemid=2 Kerry GAA - Tadhg Kennelly to Return to Kerry Football<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <ref>[http://www.hoganstand.com/Kerry/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=91674 Hoganstand.com - GAA Football & Hurling<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
