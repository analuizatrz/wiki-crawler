'''James Thomas (Jim) Brewer''' ([[November 17]], [[1937]] &ndash; [[November 16]], [[1987]]) was an American [[relief pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]]. From 1960 through 1976, Brewer played for the [[Chicago Cubs]] (1960–1963), [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (1964–1975) and [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] (1975–1976). He batted and threw left-handed.

Following the wise advice of legendary [[Warren Spahn]], Brewer developed a nasty [[screwball]] to become one of the most successful relievers in the [[National League]] between the 1960s and 70s. 

A native of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma,  Brewer compiled a 69-65 record with 810 [[strikeout]]s and a 3.07 [[earned run average|ERA]] in a 17-year career that began with the Cubs and ended with the Angels. But he is most remembered for his 12 seasons with the Dodgers. 

In his career, Brewer recorded 132 [[save (sport)|saves]], 125 of them with the Dodgers, appearing in 474 games for the club. Only two Dodgers pitchers, [[Don Sutton]] and [[Don Drysdale]], have more appearances –550 and 518, respectively.

As a Dodgers member, Brewer appeared in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1973 All-Star Game]] and in three [[World Series]] ([[1965 World Series|1965]]-[[1966 World Series|66]] and [[1974 World Series|1974]]). From 73 he averaged 19.5 saves a season, with a career-high 24 in 1970, and in 1972, he posted an 1.26 ERA and averaged a significant 4.69 [[hits per nine innings]]. 

Brewer is perhaps best known for an altercation with [[Billy Martin]]. On [[August 4]], [[1960]], Brewer, then with the Cubs, [[brushback pitch|brushed back]] Martin, then with the [[Cincinnati Reds]], with a pitch in the second inning of a game at [[Wrigley Field]]. Martin threw his bat at Brewer, who picked it up and started to hand it to Martin as Martin approached. Martin punched Brewer in the right eye, breaking his cheekbone. Brewer was hospitalized for two months, and Martin served a five-day suspension. The Cubs sued Martin for $1 million for the loss of Brewer's services, but later dropped their case. Brewer, however, pursued his, and in [[1969 in baseball|1969]] a judge ordered Martin to pay $10,000 in damages. When informed of the judgment by the press, Billy asked sarcastically, "How do they want it? Cash or check?"

Brewer died in [[Tyler, Texas]], of injuries suffered in an automobile accident, just a day before his 50th birthday.
