The '''Toraja''' are an [[ethnic group]], [[indigenous people|indigenous]] to a [[mountainous]] region of [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]].  The population numbers approximately 650,000, of which 450,000 still live in ''[[Tana Toraja]]'' ('Land of Toraja') Regency.<ref name="official"/>  The majority of the population is [[Christianity|Christian]], with [[Islam|Muslim]] and local [[animism|animist]] beliefs, known as ''aluk'' (the way), as minorities.  The Indonesian government has recognized this animist belief as ''Aluk To Dolo'' ('Way of the Ancestors').

The word ''toraja'' comes from the [[Bugis]] language ''to riaja'' meaning 'people of the uplands'. The [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]] named the people ''Toraja'' in 1909.<ref name="Nooy-Palm">cf. Nooy-Palm (1979).</ref>  Torajans are renowned for their elaborate [[funeral]] rites, [[Grave (burial)|burial site]]s carved into rocky cliffs, massive peaked-roof traditional houses known as ''[[tongkonan]]'', and colorful [[wood carving]].  Toraja funeral rites are major social events, usually attended by hundreds of people, and last for several days.

Prior to the 20th century, Torajans lived in [[autonomous]] villages practising animism and were relatively untouched by the outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Toraja highlanders to Christianity.  When ''Tana Toraja'' was further opened to the outside world in the 1970s, it became an icon of [[tourism in Indonesia]], exploited by tourism developers and studied by [[anthropologist]]s.<ref name="Adams1990"/> By the 1990s, when tourism was at its peak, Toraja [[sociocultural evolution|socioculture had evolved]] significantly from an [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[society]]&mdash;in which [[social life]] and [[habituation|habit]]s were outgrowths by the ''Aluk To Dolo''&mdash;into a largely Christian society.<ref name="Adams1995">cf. Adams (1995).</ref>

==Ethnic group identity==
The Toraja's consciousness of themselves as a distinct [[ethnic group]] prior to the [[20th century]] was virtually non-existent. <!-- This should be borne in mind when attempting to understand them as an ethnic group.  -->Prior to [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonization]] and [[Christianization]], Torajans, who lived in highland areas, were oriented towards and identified with their own villages and did not share a broader sense of identity. Although ritual complexes created linkages between highland villages, there were nevertheless dialect variations, differences in hierarchical orientations and an array of ritual practices in the [[Sulawesi]] highland region. 'Toraja' was first used as a lowlander expression for highlanders in general (''to'' = people and ''riaja'' = uplands, according to the coastal languages).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hetty Nooy-Palm| title=Introduction to the Sa'dan People and their Country| journal=Archipel| volume=15 |date=1975 |pages=163&mdash;192}}</ref> As a result the term 'Toraja' initially had more currency with outsiders&mdash;such as the [[Bugis]] and [[Makassarese]] who constitute a majority of the lowland of Sulawesi&mdash;than with insiders.  As Bigalke demonstrated in his 1981 dissertation (now a book),<ref>Bigalke (2005)</ref> it was the intense years of the Dutch missionaries in the highlands that gave rise to Toraja ethnic consciousness in the Sa'dan Toraja region which was further cemented with the rise of tourism in the [[Tana Toraja|Tana Toraja Regency]].<ref>cf. Adams (2006).</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Locator_of_toraja.png|thumb|left|Location of Toraja (green) among Makassarese (yellow) and Bugis (red) on Sulawesi island]]
The [[Gulf of Tonkin]], lying between northern [[Vietnam]] and southern [[China]], is believed to be the origin of the Toraja.<ref name="cyrut">{{cite book|author=A.C. Kruyt|title=De West-Toradjas op Midden-Celebes|date= 1938|publisher=Noord-Hollandsche Uitgevers-Maatschappij|location=Amsterdam}}</ref>  There has been a long [[acculturation]] process of local [[Malay race|Malay people]] in Sulawesi with these Chinese [[immigrants]].  At first, the immigrants lived along Sulawesi's coastal areas, near Enrekang Bay, but subsequently moved upland.

From the seventeenth century, the Dutch established trade and political control on Sulawesi through the [[Dutch East Indies Company]].  Over two centuries, they ignored the upland people due to their inaccessibility and the unproductive [[agriculture|agricultural]] prospects of their mountainous area.  In the late [[nineteenth century]], the Dutch became increasingly concerned about the spread of [[Islam]] in the south of Sulawesi, especially among Makassarese people.  The Dutch saw the animist highlanders as a pool of potential [[Christians]].  In 1909, the Reformed Missionary Alliance of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (GZB) began [[Mission (Christian)|missionary]] work, in which it was helped by the Dutch colonial government.<ref name="Nooy-Palm"/>  In addition to introducing [[Christianity]], the Dutch [[abolitionism|abolished]] [[slavery]], (see Society section below), and applied local taxes.  A line was drawn around the Sa'dan area and called ''Tana Toraja'' ('the land of Toraja').  The name was thus, not taken from the Toraja language itself, but from an outsider's point of view.  Tana Toraja was first a subdivision of the [[Luwu|Luwu kingdom]] which had claimed the area.  In 1946, the Dutch granted Tana Toraja as a [[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|regentschap]].<ref name="Bigalke1981">cf. Bigalke (1981)</ref>

Early Dutch missionaries faced strong opposition especially among [[elite]] Torajans as the abolishment of their profitable [[slave trade]] angered them.<ref name="Nooy-Palm88">cf. Kis-Jovak et al (1988), Ch. 2, Hetty Nooy-Palm, ''The World of Toraja'', pp. 12&ndash;18.</ref> Some Torajans were forcibly relocated to the lowlands by the Dutch, where they could be more easily controlled.  Taxes were kept high, undermining the wealth of the elites. Ultimately, the Dutch failed to subdue Toraja culture and only a few Torajans were [[Religious conversion|converted]].<ref name="Ngelow2004">cf. Ngelow (2004)</ref>  In 1950, only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity.<ref name="Nooy-Palm88"/>

In the 1930s, Muslim lowlanders attacked the Torajans, resulting in widespread Christian conversion among those who sought to align themselves with the Dutch for [[Political asylum|political protection]] and to form a movement against the Bugis and Makassarese Muslims.  In the years 1951 to 1965 (following [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian independence]]), southern Sulawesi faced a turbulent period with the [[Darul Islam]] separatist movement fighting for an [[Islamic state]] in Sulawesi.  The fifteen years of [[guerrilla]] warfare led to massive conversions to Christianity;<ref name="Volkman1983">cf. Volkman (1983).</ref> the number of Christians rose from 23,000 to 90,000 between 1950 and 1965.<ref>cf. Bigalke (1981), p. 434.</ref>

Yet, alignment with the Indonesian government itself did not always guarantee safety for the Torajans.  In 1965, a Presidential Decree required every Indonesian citizen to belong to one of five officially recognized religions: [[Islam]], Christianity ([[Protestantism]] and [[Catholicism]]), [[Hinduism]], or [[Buddhism]].<ref name="Yang2005">{{cite journal|last=Yang|date=2005|first=Heriyanto|title=The history and legal position of Confucianism in postindependence Indonesia|journal=Marburg Journal of Religion|volume=10|issue=1| url=http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/pdf/2005/yang2005.pdf}}</ref>  The Torajan religious belief (''aluk'') was not officially recognized and the Torajans raised their voices against the law.  In an agreement to make ''aluk'' in concordance with the law, ''aluk'' had to be accepted as part of one of the official religions.  In 1969, ''Aluk To Dolo'' (the way of ancestors) was legalized as a [[sect]] of [[Agama Hindu Dharma]], the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.<ref name="Volkman1990">cf. Volkman (1990).</ref>

==Society==
Three types of [[affiliation]] exist in Toraja society: [[family]], [[social class|class]] and [[religion]]. 

===Family affiliation===
[[Image:Tana_Toraja.jpg|thumb|right|A Toraja village.]]
Family is the [[Primary group|primary social]] and political grouping in Toraja society. Each village is one [[extended family]], the seat of which is the ''tongkonan'', a traditional Toraja house.  Each tongkonan has its own name and becomes the name of the village.  The familial dons maintain village unity. A common practice to strengthen [[kinship]] is intermarriage between cousins. Kinship is actively [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocal]], meaning that the extended family helps each other [[farming|farm]], share buffalo rituals, and pay off [[debt]]s. 

Each person belongs to both father's and mother's families, the only bilateral family line in Indonesia.<ref name="Nooy-Palm88"/>  Children, therefore, [[Inheritance|inherit]] household affiliation from both their mother and their father, including land and even family debts.  Children's names are given based on kinship and they are usually named after dead relatives. Names of aunts, uncles and cousins are commonly referred to in the names of mothers, fathers and siblings.

Prior formal administration of Toraja villages by the [[Tana Toraja|Tana Toraja Regency]], each Toraja village was [[autonomous]] in terms of [[authority]]. In a more complex situation, in which one Toraja family could not handle their problems alone, several villages formed a group.  Some villages united against other villages for different reasons.  For example, several sided with the Dutch against the lowlanders.  Others fought the Dutch.  Traditional animists and Christian Torajans sometimes united against Muslims.  At other times, all Torajans (including Muslims) united against the Bugis people.<ref name="Nooy-Palm88"/>

===Class affiliation===
[[Image:Torajankids2.jpg|thumb|left|Torajan children in Maruang]]
In early Toraja society, family relationships were tied closely to [[social class]]. There were three strata: [[nobles]], [[Middle class|commoners]], and [[slaves]], although the latter was [[abolitionism|abolished]] in 1909 by the [[Dutch East Indies]] government.  
Class was inherited through the mother. Therefore it was a strong [[taboo]] to marry "down" with a woman from lower class.  On the other hand, marrying a woman from a [[Upper class|higher class]] could improve the status of the next generation. 

The nobility's condescending attitude towards the commoners was present as late as the 1950s and the nobility is still maintained for reasons of family prestige.<ref name="Bigalke1981"/>  The nobility, who they believed to be direct descendants of the descended person from [[heaven]],<ref name="Wellenkamp1998">cf. Wellenkamp (1988).</ref> lived in tongkonans, while commoners lived in less lavish houses (a bamboo shack called ''banua'').  Slaves lived in small huts, which must be built around their owner's tongkonan.  Commoners might marry with anyone, but nobles preferred to [[consanguinity|marry in-family]] to maintain their status.  Sometimes nobles were married with Bugis or Makassarese nobles.  Commoners and slaves were prohibited from having [[funerals|death feasts]].  Despite the close kinship and status inheritance, there was a certain degree of [[social mobility]], as marriage could change someone's status, or the status could be changed as they lost or gained wealth.<ref name="Bigalke1981"/>  Wealth is counted by the number of [[water buffalo]]s that someone has, which will be [[Slaughter (livestock)|slaughtered]] during his/her funeral feast.

[[Slavery|Slaves]] in Toraja were family's property.  Sometimes Torajans decided themselves to become slaves when they had a debt, pledging to work as payment.  Slaves could be possessed during wars, and [[slave trade|slave trading]] was common.  Slaves could buy their freedom back, but their children still inherited slave status.  Slave life was the lowest.  Slaves were prohibited from wearing [[bronze]] and [[gold]], carving their houses, eating from the same dishes as their owners, or having [[sex]] with a free woman.  The last crime was [[capital punishment|punishable by death]].<ref name="Bigalke1981"/>

===Religion affiliation===
Toraja's indigenous belief is [[polytheistic]] [[animism]], called ''aluk'', or the way (sometimes it is translated as "the law"). In the Toraja myth, the ancestors of Torajan people came down from heaven by using a stair.  This stair was then used by the Torajans as a communication medium with ''Puang Matua'', [[Creator deity|the Creator]].<ref name="myth">This Toraja myth was directly translated from the history of Toraja at the official Tana Toraja website [http://www.toraja.go.id/sejarah.php]</ref>  The cosmos, according to ''aluk'', is divided into the upper world (heaven), the world of man (earth), and the underworld.<ref name="Nooy-Palm88"/>  At first, heaven and earth were married, then there was a darkness, a separation, and finally the light. Animals live in the underworld which is represented by rectangular space enclosed by pillars; the earth is for mankind and the heaven world is located above covered with a saddle shaped roof. Other Toraja's gods include ''Pong Banggai di Rante'' (God of Earth), ''Indo' Ongon-Ongon'' (Goddess who can cause earthquake), ''Pong Lalondong'' (God of death), ''Indo' Belo Tumbang'' (Goddess of medicine), and many more.<ref name="philtar">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Toraja Religion|encyclopedia=Overview of World Religion|publisher=St. Martin College, UK|accessdate=2006-09-06|url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/indon/toraj.html}}</ref>

The authority, whose words and actions should be taken both in life ([[agriculture]]) and death ([[funerals]]), is called ''to minaa'' (an ''aluk'' [[priest]]).  ''Aluk'' is not just a [[belief system]]; it is a combination of law, religion, and habit.  ''Aluk'' governs social life, agricultural practices, dealing with ancestral, rituals, etc.  Details of ''aluk'' may vary from one village to another.  One common law is the requirement that death and life rituals must be separated.  Torajans believe that performing death rituals might ruin their corpses when it is combined with life rituals.<ref>  The death rituals are scholarly known as "smoke-descending" rituals, while the life rituals are "smoke-ascending" rituals; cf. Wellenkamp (1988).</ref>  Both death and life rituals are equally important.  During the Dutch missionary works, Christian Torajans were prohibited from attending or performing life rituals, while allowing them to perform death rituals.<ref name="Ngelow2004"/>  Consequently, Toraja's death rituals are still practiced today, while life rituals diminished.

==Culture==
===Tongkonan===
[[Image:Tongkonan1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A tongkonan with colorful decorations on the wall.]] 
{{main|Tongkonan}}
Tongkonan is the traditional Toraja house, a family house made by [[bamboo]] with a distinguished boat-shaped roof that represents praying to the sky. Red, black and yellow colored wood with detailed carvings decorate the outside wall. The word tongkonan comes from the Toraja language's ''tongkon'', or to sit.

Tongkonan symbolizes Toraja's [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]].<ref>cf. Kis-Jovak et al (1988), Ch. 4, Hetty Nooy-Palm, ''The house as microcosm'', p. 34.</ref>  According to the Toraja [[Mythology|myth]], the first tongkonan house was built in heaven on four poles and the roof was made of [[India]]n [[cloth]]. When the first Toraja's ancestor descended to earth, he imitated the house and held a big ceremony.<ref name="tongkonan">{{cite web|url=http://www.toraja.net/culture/arcitecture/index.html|title=Toraja Architecture|accessdate=2009-09-04}}</ref>

The construction of tongkonan is a laborious work and it is usually built with the help of all family members. There are three different types of tongkonan.  ''Tongkonan layuk'' is the house of the highest authority, used as the "center of government".  The second type is the ''tongkonan pekamberan'', which belongs to the family group members who have some authorities in [[adat|local traditions]].  The last one is ''tongkonan batu'', which belongs to the ordinary family members. In the original Toraja society, only nobles had the right to build tongkonan, but presently Torajans build tongkonan mainly to attract tourists.

===Wood carvings===
[[Image:TorajaArt.JPG|thumb|left|A Toraja wood carving. Each panel symbolizes a goodwill.]]

The Toraja language is [[Spoken language|only spoken]]; no [[writing system]] exists.<ref name="Palmer2006"/> To express social and religious concepts, Torajans [[Wood carving|carve wood]], calling it ''Pa'ssura'' (or "the writing"). Wood carvings are therefore Toraja's cultural manifestation. 

Each carving receives a special name and common motifs are animals and plants that symbolize of some goodwill.<ref name="Sande1989"/>  For example, water plants and animals, such as [[crabs]], [[tadpoles]] and water [[weeds]], are commonly found to symbolize [[fertility]]. The left image shows an example of Toraja wood carving, consisting of 15 square panels. The center bottom panel represents buffalo or wealth, because they wish a lot of [[water buffalo|buffalos]] for their family. The center panel represents a knot and a box. It is a hope that all of their offspring will be happy and live in harmony, just like goods that are kept safe in a box.  The top left and top right squares represent an [[aquatic animal]], indicating the need for fast and hard work just like moving in the surface of water. It also represents the need for a certain skill to produce good results. 

Regularity and order are common features in Toraja wood carving (see table below), as well as abstracts and geometrical designs. Nature is frequently used as the basis of Toraja's ornaments, because nature is full of abstractions and geometries with regularities and ordering.<ref name="Palmer2006"/> Toraja's ornaments have been studied in [[ethnomathematics]] to reveal its mathematical structure, but Torajans make these arts only based on some approximations.<ref name="Palmer2006">{{cite conference|first=Miquel Alberti|last=Palmer|title=The Kira-kira method of the Torajan woodcarvers of Sulawesi to divide a segment into equal parts.|booktitle=Third International Conference on Ethnomathematics: Cultural Connections and Mathematical Manipulations|date=2006|location=Auckland, New Zealand|url=http://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~poisard/ICEm3/3.Prez%20Not%20Given/Prez%20not%20given%20papers/Alberti-paper.doc|format=[[DOC (computing)|doc]]}}</ref>  To create an ornament, bamboo sticks are used as a geometrical tool.

===Funeral rites===
[[Image:Burial_Site_2.jpg|thumb|right|A stone carved burial site. ''Tau tau'' (effigies of the deceased) were put in the cave, facing down the land.]]
In the Toraja society, [[Funeral|funeral ritual]] is the most elaborate and expensive event.  The richer and more powerful an individual, the more expensive his or her funeral.  In the ''aluk'' religion, only nobles have the right to have an extensive death feast.<ref>In the present-day, where tourism is the main income of the Torajans, funeral feasts were held by non-noble rich families, mainly performed for tourist attractions. Volkman (1982) called this phenomenon as a death funeral inflation.</ref>

The expensive cost of death feast is often made the ceremony held in weeks, months or years after the actual death, because the deceased family needs to raise significant funds to cover the funeral expenses.<ref>In 1992, the most powerful Torajan, the former chief of Tana Toraja Regency, died and his family had asked US$ 125,000 to a Japanese TV company for a license fee to film the funeral, in order to cover the funeral expenses; cf. Yamashita (1994).</ref>  Traditionally, Torajans believe that death is not a sudden abrupt event, but rather a gradual process toward ''Puya'' (the land of souls) or the [[afterlife]].  During the waiting period, the body of the [[the dead|deceased]] is wrapped in several layers of cloth and kept under the house or tongkonan.  The soul of the deceased is thought to linger around the village until the funeral ceremony is completed, after which it begins its journey to ''Puya''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=To the Afterworld and Back: Mourning and Dreams of the Dead among the Toraja|journal=Ethos|author=Douglas Hollan|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0091-2131%28199512%2923%3A4%3C424%3ATTAABM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-E|volume=23|issue=4|pages=424&ndash;436|date=1995}}</ref>

The death feast of a nobleman is usually attended by thousands of people and lasts for several days.  The most noticeable component in the ritual is [[water buffalo|buffalos]].  The more powerful the person who died, the more buffalos are slaughtered at their death feast.  Buffalo carcasses, including their heads, are usually lined on a field, waiting for their owner who is in the "sleeping stage". Torajans believe that the deceased person will need the buffalos to make the journey.

There are three methods of [[burial]]. The [[coffin]], including any possessions which will be needed in the afterlife, will be either put in a [[cave]] [[Grave (burial)|grave]], a stone grave, or hung on a [[cliff]].  The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave, carved out of the rocky cliff, which usually costs a lot of money and takes some months to complete.  In some places, the stone cave is enough to accommodate the whole family.  A wooden carved [[effigy]], called ''tau tau'', is usually put in the cave and faced down over the land.<ref>Unfortunately, these ''tau tau'' have been targeted by [[grave robbing|grave robbers]] for antique collectors.  In several occasions, a stolen tau tau effigy of Toraja appeared in an exhibition show, for instances, at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in 1981 and at the Arnold Herstand Gallery in [[New York]] in 1984, see Volkman (1990).</ref>

A unique type of burial is to hang the coffin by ropes, either on a cliff face or from trees for dead babies and children  This hanging grave usually lasts for some years, until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground below.

==Language==
The ethnic Toraja language is dominant in Tana Toraja, although the national [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] language is spoken in the community.<ref name="official"/>  All [[elementary school]]s in Tana Toraja teach Toraja language. [[Denominationalism|Denominations of the language]] include ''Kalumpang'', ''Mamasa'', ''Tae' '', ''Talondo' '', ''Toala' '', and ''Toraja-Sa'dan''. All of them belong to the [[Malayo-Polynesian]] language from the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family.<ref name="gordon2005Toraja">{{cite book|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/web.asp|last=Gordon|first=Raymond G.|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|date=2005|publisher=Dallas, Tex.: SIL International|format=online version|accessdate=2006-10-17}}</ref> Each denomination has its own [[dialect]]s, as seen in the table below.

Toraja dialects have been affected by influences from other languages.  For instance, Rongkong and Bua dialects of Tae' are a product a mixture between [[Bugis]], Tae' and [[Java]] languages.<ref name="taejournal">{{cite journal | title = Bahasa Tae' Luwu Masuki Dunia Ilmiah| journal = Palopo | publisher = JURnalCelebe | date = 2005-05-11 | url = http://www.jurnalcelebes.com/view.php?id=196&jenis=jurnal_adat|accessdate = 2006-10-16 }}</ref> [[Transmigration program]], that has been proposed since the [[Dutch East Indies|colonialism]] period, is the major cause of the [[Variety (linguistics)|language varieties]].

==Economy==
Toraja economy was first based on [[agriculture]] with cultivated wet [[rice]] in [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]]d [[fiord]]s on mountain slopes, and other supplemental crops, such as [[cassava]] and [[maize]].  [[Livestock]] of [[water buffalo]]s, [[pig]]s, and [[chicken]]s were also produced, mainly for ceremonial sacrifices and consumption.<ref name="Volkman1983">cf. Volkman (1983).</ref>  This agricultural-based economy was maintained until the 1965 [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era.

Starting from 1965 Indonesia was developed and expanded to foreign investments. [[Multinational corporation]]s of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[mining]] companies ([[gold]], [[coal]], [[steel]], [[copper]], etc.) opened new mining sites in Indonesia.  The corporations needed highly motivated, educated and [[underemployed]] labor workers.  Torajans, mostly young ones, were directly attracted to work at the foreign companies.  A large number of Torajan youth went to work at oil and timber companies in [[Kalimantan]], mines and forests of [[Papua]] and the cities of [[Sulawesi]] and [[Java]].  The [[out-migration]] flow of Torajans was a steady until 1985.<ref name="Volkman1990">cf. Volkman (1990).</ref>

When Tana Toraja was opened for tourism in 1984, the economy in Toraja gradually shifted to the tourism industry.  Especially in the 1980s and 1990s, Torajans obtained their income from tourism by working in hotels as tour guides or selling souvenirs. Whilst most young Torajans were still interested to work in mining or oil companies, because the income is bigger and they can support their families back home in Tana Toraja.  With the rise of political and economic instability in Indonesia in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as well as recent inter-religious conflicts elsewhere on Sulawesi, tourism to Tana Toraja has consequently plummeted.

==Commercialization==
[[Image:Toraja_tumbs.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A Torajan tomb in a high rocky cliff. It is one example of tourist attractions in Tana Toraja.]]
Before the 1970s, Toraja was virtually unknown to Western tourism.  In 1971, about fifty Europeans visited Tana Toraja.  In 1972, at least 400 visitors attended a funeral ritual of Puang of Sangalla, the highest-ranking [[nobleman]] in Tana Toraja and the last pure blood Torajan noble.  The event was documented by [[National Geographic]] and broadcasted in several European countries.<ref name="Volkman1990"/>  In 1976, about 12,000 tourists visited the regency and in 1981, Toraja [[sculpture]] was exhibited in major North American museums.<ref name="Volkman1982">cf. Volkman (1982).</ref>  "The land of the heavenly kings of Tana Toraja", as written in the exhibition brochure, embraced the outside world.

In 1984, the Ministry of Tourism of Indonesia declared Tana Toraja Regency the ''prima donna'' of [[South Sulawesi]].  Tana Toraja was then heralded as "the second stop after [[Bali]]".<ref name="Adams1995"/>  Tourism was increasing dramatically.  In 1985, the number of foreign visitors increased to 150,000, excluding 80,000 domestic tourists.  By 1987, tourists to Tana Toraja numbered 179,948 annually.<ref name="Adams1990">cf. Adams (1990).</ref>  Souvenir stands appeared in Rantepao and at the most visited tourist sites, roads were paved, and new hotels and tourist-oriented restaurants were opened.  An airstrip was opened in the regency in 1981.  Finally, by the mid 1990s, some tourists were starting to feel that Toraja was too commercialized.<ref>{{cite book|last=Posey|first=Darell A|coauthors=Dutfiel, Graham|title=Beyond Intellectual Property: Toward Traditional Resource Rights for Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities|publisher=IDRC|date=1996|id=ISBN 0-88936-799-X}}</ref>

In 1985 the South Sulawesi [[Provinces of Indonesia|provincial government]] recognized eighteen Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist objects.  With this came the introduction of zoning restrictions for these sites such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans and burial sites.  This plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders (tourism developers).  As a result, in 1987, the Toraja village Kété Kesú and several other designated "tourist objects" closed their doors to tourists.  This closure did not last more than a few days, as the villagers felt it was too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.<ref name="Adams1990"/>

Tourism has played a major role in the [[sociocultural evolution]] of Toraja society.  In the original Toraja society, there was a ritual which allowed commoners to marry nobles (''puang'') and gain nobility for their children.  However, tourist imageries have changed such that Torajans are covering up their [[social status]].  High social status is not as esteemed in Tana Toraja as it once before.  Many low ranking citizens can gain enough wealth by working outside the region, and then marrying a noble woman to declare themselves, and their children, nobles.<ref name="Adams1995"/>
