The '''Flood''' is a fictional [[parasite|parasitic]] [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] life form in the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game series. They are introduced in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' as a secondary enemy to the game's protagonist, [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], and return in ''[[Halo 2]]''  and ''[[Halo 3]]'' to fill the same role. The Flood are driven by a desire to infest sentient life they encounter, and are depicted as such a threat that the ancient [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] were forced to kill most of themselves and all other sentient life nearly 100,000 years before the beginning of ''Halo'' in an effort to starve the Flood to death.<ref>{{cite web|date=2006-08-01|author=HBO staff|url=http://halosm.bungie.org/story/staten083106.html|title=HBO interview with Staten|work=halo.bungie.org|accessdate=Jan 1|accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref>'''343 Guilty Spark:''' After exhausting every other strategic option, my creators activated the rings.

The player's discovery of the Flood is kept suspenseful and tense, and was one of the surprises reviewers noted positively upon release,<ref name=gamespot>{{cite web|author=Fielder, Joe|date=2001-11-09|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/halo/review.html?page=4|title=Halo: Combat Evolved'' for Xbox Review|work=gamespot.com|accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref> although others found the Flood too derivative and a clichéd element of science fiction.

==Game development==
The Flood were added early in the game development stage of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', before the game had made its jump from the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platform and Bungie was bought by [[Microsoft]]; a design for one Flood form appeared as early as 1997.<ref>{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |pages=67}}</ref> At one point, the ringworld ''Halo'' featured dinosaur-like terrestrial creatures, but due to gameplay constraints, these were dropped. An additional consideration was that Bungie felt the presence of other native species would dilute the impact and surprise of the Flood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |title=One Million Years B.X. |author=Bungie|date=2006-02-10 |work=bungie.net|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060210224125/http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |archivedate=2006-02-10 }}</ref>

Commenting upon the inception of the Flood, Bungie staff member Chris Butcher noted that "the idea behind the Flood as the forgotten peril that ended a galaxy-spanning empire is a pretty fundamental tenet of good sci-fi."<ref>{{cite web|date=2002-01-09|url=http://halo.bungie.org/misc/interviews/getinthegame.butcher.010902/|title=Halo Chat with Developer Chris Butcher|work=halo.bungie.org|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref>

==Physiology==
[[Image:Flood3.jpg|thumb|right|The "Infection" stage of the Flood.]]
The Flood are depicted as having a complicated lifecycle; smaller base forms of Flood infect and mutate hosts into other forms, which ultimately repeat the cycle by spawning the smaller forms. The largest self-contained form the Flood can produce itself, without using other biomasses,<ref>{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |pages=64}}</ref> is an "Infection form". As its name suggests, the Infection form homes in on hosts (living or dead), attempting to drive sharp spines into the host and tap into the nervous system. This tap causes the host to be incapacitated, while the Infection form burrows into the host's body and begins the mutation process, bringing the host under Flood control. Hosts that have been recently converted are noted to be weaker than those who have been under Flood control for long periods.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=140}}</ref>

Depending on the size or condition of the host, the Infection form is seen to turn the host into several other forms to serve the Flood's purpose. Suitable hosts are turned into "Combat forms", which are described as extremely powerful and resilient warriors. Combat forms are able to resist extreme punishment while utilizing either the weapons of their hosts or the long, whip-like tentacles developed during their mutation to kill any non-Flood in sight.<ref name=h295>{{cite book |author= Piggyback||title=''Halo 2: The Official Strategy Guide: The Flood]''|year= 2004|publisher= Piggyback Interactive Ltd.|location=United States |isbn=0-7615-4473-9|pages=95}}</ref> In the first two games, Combat forms are always mutated Marines or Covenant Elites, recognizable by their respectively thin or bulky appearance, but Brutes can be seen amongst the Combat forms in ''[[Halo 3]]''. If a host is unsuitable for combat (too small, missing limbs, etc.), it will mutate into a "Carrier form", which as the name suggests is designed to transport and spread more Infection forms. The upper-body of Carrier form swells into a bulbous sac while the legs remain intact. When it moves close enough to a potential host (or is shot repeatedly), the Carrier form explodes like a grenade, both releasing its contents and killing anything within range.
          
The Flood also create forms for tasks other than finding more food. In ''Halo'', the Flood are seen to create "Brain forms"; these spongy creatures, resembling a large bag of flesh with tentacles, can be used to interrogate victims, stripping information from the mind of the host before eventually assimilating them into itself.<ref name=tf200>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=200}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=225}}</ref> Once the Flood acquires enough biomass, they will begin developing a [[Gravemind]], which serves as a central intelligence for the infection, creating a hive mind scenario. Graveminds are extremely intelligent and resourceful, often playing their enemies against each other. As a Gravemind develops, it is able to exact more control over the lesser flood forms and is eventually able to develop entirely new forms referred to as Pure Forms. Pure forms do not require a host body to create and are instead formed from degraded biomatter built around a calcium frame. Pure forms are capable of shape-shifting to a limited degree, allowing them to adapt to different combat situations.

During the [[Iris (game)|Iris ARG]], the [[Iris (game)#Server #4|Fourth Server]] postulates that the Flood is of [[Extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic origin]] — that is, not of the [[Milky Way]].

==Appearances==
===''Halo: Combat Evolved''===
{{seealso|Halo: Combat Evolved}}
The Flood make their surprise appearance more than halfway through ''Halo: Combat Evolved''<nowikI>'</nowiki>s campaign, during the mission "343 Guilty Spark". The [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] is sent on an extraction mission by Cortana to try and find Captain [[Characters in the Halo series#Jacob Keyes|Jacob Keyes]], who disappeared in a swamp while looking for a weapons cache.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=200}}</ref>

The Master Chief finds that the Covenant have released the Flood accidentally, and the sheer numbers of the parasite overwhelmed Keyes and his squad. While most of the [[United Nations Space Command|UNSC]] Marines were converted to Combat forms, Keyes is interrogated by the Flood in an attempt to learn the location of Earth. Keyes successfully resists,<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=199}}</ref> but is assimilated by the Flood before the Master Chief can rescue him. The emergence of the Flood prompts Halo's "Monitor", [[343 Guilty Spark]], to enlist the help of the Master Chief in activating Halo's defenses and preventing a Flood outbreak.<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark''': Greetings. I am the Monitor of installation 04. I am 343 Guilty Spark. Someone has released the Flood. My function is to prevent it from leaving this installation. But I require your assistance. Come.

===''Halo Graphic Novel''===
The 2006 one-shot ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]'' expands upon the Flood's release on Halo in two stories. The first, ''Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'', takes place early on in the level "343 Guilty Spark" during ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. The Flood manage to pilot a Covenant dropship off Halo, and crash-land the vessel on a Covenant agricultural ship, ''[[Covenant (Halo)#Infinite Succor|Infinite Succor]]''. Successfully assimilating most of the Covenant and wildlife aboard the ship, the Flood are stopped by a Covenant strike team led by [[Characters in the Halo series#Rtas 'Vadumee|Rtas 'Vadumee]], who sets the ship on a course into the nearby sun.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammock|first= Lee|title=The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=|isbn=0785123725 |pages=}}</ref>

The second story details the escape of Sergeant [[Characters in the Halo series#Avery Johnson|Avery Johnson]] from the clutches of the Flood, immediately after Keyes' squad is overrun during ''Halo''. Due to a pre-existing medical condition called Boren's Syndrome, the Flood parasites cannot infect Johnson and attempt to kill him instead.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nihei |first= Tsutomu|title=Breaking Quarantine|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=|isbn=0785123725 |pages=}}</ref>

===''Halo 2''===
{{seealso|Halo 2|Halo: Ghosts of Onyx}}
The Flood returned in ''[[Halo 2]]'', first being released by the Heretic Elites in a Forerunner gas-complex above Threshold, and later released accidentally on [[Delta Halo]].<ref>'''Truth''': We are, all of us, gravely concerned. The release of the parasite was unexpected, unfortunate, but there is no need to panic. - {{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie Studios| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2004| platform =[[Xbox]]| version = | level = Gravemind| language = English }}</ref> The Flood in this game feature several differences from those in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'': Combat forms are able to hijack and drive vehicles, Infection forms can reanimate disabled Combat forms if they are not too badly damaged, and the Carrier forms are far less numerous (in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the player could often dispatch hordes of Flood simply by destroying the numerous Carrier forms).

The Flood on Delta Halo are led by the [[Gravemind]], a massive creature that dwells in the bowels of the ring. Gravemind rescues both the Master Chief and [[Arbiter (Halo)|the Arbiter]] when they are nearly killed in separate engagements, and sends each in different places in an effort to stop the Covenant from activating the ring.<ref>'''Gravemind''': If you will not hear the truth, then I will show it to you. There is still time to stop the key from turning, but first it must be found. You will search one likely spot... / ...and you will search another.

===''Halo 3''===
{{seealso|Halo 3}}
[[Image:Floodbrutes h3.png|thumb|right|A group of infected Covenant Brutes.]]
New Flood forms are encountered in ''Halo 3'', and the previously existing forms now show new abilities. Infection forms are able to convert corpses or even live hosts into new Combat forms in a matter of seconds. Brutes are now able to be infected, and are strewn among the Flood troops. However, Combat forms are now more prone to melee damage than in the first two games. While Combat forms retain the inarticulate screams that they possessed in ''Halo 2'', the Gravemind taunts the player through the various Flood forms during gameplay. Finally, the Carrier forms release more Infection forms than in previous games.

A new, mutable Flood combat form appears in ''Halo 3'', called the "Pure Form." It resembles a [[Covenant (Halo)#Drones|Covenant Drone]] at first, called a Stalker form, being weak in close combat but able to climb up walls. However, it can suddenly transform into a Tank Form; a huge brute like creature, capable of withstanding immense punishment, reminiscent of the scrapped "Drinol" character. It can further mutate into another insect-like form called the Ranged form, which can fire large numbers of spikes. These creatures are formed when the Flood gain access to large enough stocks of calcium, which it uses to form a framework for biomass collected from other species.

In ''Halo 3'', a Flood-infected starship crashes on Earth, and begins to infect the human populace. In order to stop the threat, the former [[Covenant Elite]]s [[vitrification|glass]] the infected areas(presumably half the African continent). Later on, the Flood-infested [[High Charity]], along with Gravemind, arrive at the [[Halo (megastructure)#The Ark|The Ark]] and temporarily ally with the Arbiter and Master Chief in order to stop the [[Hierarchs (Halo)|Prophet of Truth]] from activating all the ringworlds. With the greatest threat to the Flood's existence now eliminated, Gravemind turns on his allies. Though High Charity is destroyed by the Master Chief, Gravemind survives on a new Halo under construction in the middle of the Ark. Despite the Flood's best efforts, the ring is activated by the Master Chief, neutralizing the Flood far from the Milky Way galaxy.

==Reception==
The surprise appearance of the Flood during ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' was seen as an important plot twist. Actress [[Aisha Tyler]] said that "[every time the Flood appear], even though I've played it a million times, is a totally terrifying moment."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameroom.mlgpro.com/view/zyiJ5z9YWvg.html|title=Sci vs. Fi - ''Halo 3'' Documentary|work=mlgpro.com|accessdate=2007-10-05|date=2007-10-02}}</ref> Despite this, the response to the presence of the Flood in ''Halo 2'' and ''Halo 3'' was mixed. A panel of online reviewers noted that the Flood appeared in ''Halo 2'' for no obvious reasons, and were simply described as "aggravating" to play against.<ref name=free>{{cite web|author=Team Freemont|year=2004|url=http://www.teamfremont.com/reviews/Halo2.shtml|title=Team Freemont: Halo 2 review|work=teamfremont.com|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> Similarly, reviewers including Victor Godinez of ''Dallas News'' felt that the Flood were too derivative of other [[science fiction|sci-fi]] stereotypes, and functioned as "space [[zombie]]s".<ref name=free/><ref>{{cite web|author=Godinez, Victor|date=2006-07-16 |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/ptech/gamereviews2/071806ccdrPTECHhalobook.1d4d3a2.html|title=Review: The Halo Graphic Novel|work=dallasnews.com|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref> Gamecritics.com noted in their review of ''Halo 3'' that even though the Flood looked better than ever, their single strategy of rushing the player proved tedious.<ref name="gamecritics review">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamecritics.com/halo-3-review|title=''Halo 3'' Review|author=Weissenberger, Daniel|date=2007-10-01|accessdate=2007-10-02|work=gamecritics.com}}</ref>

Lee Hammock, writer of the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]'' story ''The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'', described the basis of the story as a way to showcase the true danger of the Flood as an intelligent menace, rather than something the player happens upon and shoots. Hammock also stated that the story would prove the intelligent nature of the Flood, and "hopefully [[euthanization|euthanize]] the idea that they are just space zombies";<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammock|first= Lee|title=The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=|isbn=0785123725 |pages=}}</ref> this treatment was received positively by critics.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scrofani|date=2006-07-16|url=http://www.gzpro.org/gameofthemonth.htm|title=Game Zone Pro: ''Halo Graphic Novel''|work=gzpro.org|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref>
