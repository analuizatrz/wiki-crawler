The '''Melbourne Storm''' are an Australian professional [[rugby league]] football club based in the city of [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The Melbourne club play in the Australasia's elite competition, the [[National Rugby League]] premiership. The Melbourne Storm have won one premiership in their ten years in the first grade competition.

The club was founded in 1998, in the new competition National Rugby League. The club is the first first-grade club based in Victoria. The club has been successful in a [[Aussie rules]] heartland. They play their home games at [[Olympic Park Stadium|Olympic Park]] but previously played their home games at [[Telstra Dome]].

Melbourne have won the 1999 grand final only two years after being admitted into the competition, making them the quickest [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership#1908: Rugby league premiership in Sydney|non-foundation]] team to win a premiership. The club also became the minor premiers in 2006, for most wins. They made the grand final in 2006, but lost to [[Brisbane Broncos|Brisbane]] and became Runner Up.

==History==
In 1996, the [[Australian Rugby League]] (ARL) decided to establish a Melbourne based team due to the high attendences at recent [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] matches. But in May 1997, [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] boss [[John Ribot]] pushed for a Melbourne based club in the Super League competition, which was the rival against the ARL competition.<ref name="page344">{{cite book | last = Collis, Ian and Whitaker, Alan | title = The History of Rugby League Clubs | accessdate = 21 | accessyear = 2007 | accessmonth = 7 | year = 2004 | publisher = New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | location = Sydney | pages = 344 | isbn = 174110075-5 }}</ref> Former [[Brisbane Broncos]] centre [[Chris Johns (rugby league)|Chris Johns]] became the CEO of the club and Ribot steps down from head of the Super League to set up the club. In September 1997, Melbourne announced that [[Chris Anderson]] would be their foundation coach, and then the Super League announced that their new team will be named the Melbourne Storm.<ref>{{cite book | last = Collis, Ian and Whitaker, Alan | title = The History of Rugby League Clubs | accessdate = 21 | accessyear = 2007 | accessmonth = 7 | year = 2004 | publisher = New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | location = Sydney | pages = 345 | isbn = 174110075-5 }}</ref>

The Melbourne club then went forward with signing players from other clubs, including [[Robbie Ross]], [[Glenn Lazarus]], [[Brett Kimmorley]] and [[Scott Hill]]. With the Super League and ARL joining into one competition, the Melbourne team was now part of the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) for the 1998 season. In their first ever game, they defeated [[Illawarra Steelers|Illawarra]], with [[Glenn Lazarus]] being their inaugural captain. The Melbourne Storm, in a complete shock to the rest of the competition, won their first four games, before losing to [[Auckland Warriors|Auckland]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Collis, Ian and Whitaker, Alan | title = The History of Rugby League Clubs | accessdate = 21 | accessyear = 2007 | accessmonth = 7 | year = 2004 | publisher = New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | location = Sydney | pages = 346 | isbn = 174110075-5 }}</ref> They went on to make the finals, but were defeated by eventual premiers [[Brisbane Broncos]].<ref name="page347">{{cite book | last = Collis, Ian and Whitaker, Alan | title = The History of Rugby League Clubs | accessdate = 21 | accessyear = 2007 | accessmonth = 7 | year = 2004 | publisher = New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | location = Sydney | pages = 347 | isbn = 174110075-5 }}</ref>

In 1999, The Storm won their eight of their first eleven games, and went on to make the finals in 3rd position on the premiership ladder. The team was thrashed in the quarter final by [[St. George Illawarra Dragons|St. George Illawarra]], but came from behind in both the semi-final and prelimenery final to make the grand final. Melbourne faced St. George Illawarra in the 1999 grand final, St. George Illawarra were clear faviourites due to comfortably defeating Melbourne just three weeks earlier. When St. George Illawarra were ahead 14-0 at half time and Melbourne seemed down and out, but two tries in to Melbourne put the scoreline at 18-14 in favour of St. George Illawarra with 15 minute remaining. With three minutes remaining, [[Craig Smith]], the winger for Melbourne, went over the line however was knocked out by a high tacle which caused him to lose the ball. In a historic video refereeing decision, a penalty try was awarded and Melbourne's [[Matt Geyer]] kicked the goal that won Melbourne the 1999 Grand final.<ref name="page347"/><ref>{{cite book | last = Collis, Ian and Whitaker, Alan | title = The History of Rugby League Clubs | accessdate = 21 | accessyear = 2007 | accessmonth = 7 | year = 2004 | publisher = New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | location = Sydney | pages = 348 | isbn = 174110075-5 }}</ref>

Between 2000 and 2002, the Melbourne club performed poorly. Cracks were starting to appear between Johns, Ribot and Anderson through out the period, and Anderson quit as coach of Melbourne mid season of 2001, and was replaced by [[Mark Murray (rugby league)|Mark Murray]]. The Melbourne club failed to make the finals in 2001. Johns left the club as CEO at the end of 2002 and coach Murray was released due to the Storm poor form. [[Craig Bellamy (rugby league)|Craig Bellamy]] was announced as the new coach of Melbourne for 2003.<ref>{{cite book | last = Collis, Ian and Whitaker, Alan | title = The History of Rugby League Clubs | accessdate = 21 | accessyear = 2007 | accessmonth = 7 | year = 2004 | publisher = New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | location = Sydney | pages = 349 | isbn = 174110075-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Collis, Ian and Whitaker, Alan | title = The History of Rugby League Clubs | accessdate = 21 | accessyear = 2007 | accessmonth = 7 | year = 2004 | publisher = New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | location = Sydney | pages = 350 | isbn = 174110075-5 }}</ref>

Between 2003 and 2005, Melbourne made the finals under coach Bellamy, but lost before the grand final. In 2006, the Melbourne team won their first minor premiership for being on top of the NRL ladder. Melbourne only lost four games in the season making them outright leaders by four wins.<ref name="a">{{cite web|title=Rugby League Tables / Season 2006|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/2006.html#lad|accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref> They went on to win their two finals matches and go on to the grand final.<ref name="a"/> But in the grand final, against the [[Brisbane Broncos]], they lost 8-15 to make it them runners up despite being favourites for the title.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_league/international_and_australian/5392958.stm|accessdate=2007-07-28|title=Broncos edge Storm for NRL title|publisher=''BBC News''}}</ref>

==Emblem and Colours==
Originally, the club favoured the name Melbourne Mavericks with a gunslinger logo holding a fistful of aces. The club officials were all set to go with this until News Limited's [[Lachlan Murdoch]] told them to go with something else because the Macericks sounded too American. So CEO [[Chris Johns]] and [[John Ribot]] decided to go with the themes lightning, power and storm. The club then became known as the Melbourne Storm.<ref name="page344"/>

The Storm were always going to go with the colours of their state, [[Victoria]]. These were navy blue with a white 'V'. But club consultant Peter McWhirter, from JAG fasion house, suggested that they should also have a flash of gold to make their merchandise more attractive.<ref name="page344"/>
