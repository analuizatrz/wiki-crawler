The '''Democratic Party''' is one of two major [[Political party|political parties]] in the [[United States]], the other being the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. It is the oldest political party in the United States and arguably<!--please see long discussions on Talk before altering this--> the oldest party in the world.<ref>{{cite book | author=Jules Witcover | title=Party of the People: A History of the Democrats | year=2003 | chapter=1 | page=3}}</ref><ref>Democratic Party, Encyclopedia Britannica Online, Accessed August 21, 2007.

Since the 2006 [[United States general elections, 2006|midterm elections]] the Democratic Party is the [[Two-party system|majority party]] for the [[110th United States Congress|110th]] [[United States Congress|Congress]]; the party holds an outright majority in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate|Democratic caucus]] (including two [[Independent (politician)|independents]]) constitutes a majority in the [[United States Senate]]. Democrats also hold a majority of [[List of current United States Governors|state governorships]] and control a [[plurality]] of [[List of U.S. state legislatures|state legislatures]]. It is currently the largest political party with 72 million registered members, 42.6 percent of the electorate.<ref name="Neuhart, P. (22 January, 2004). Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats. ''USA Today'''.">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/neuharth/2004-01-22-neuharth_x.htm|title=Neuhart, P. (22 January, 2004). Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats. ''USA Today'''.|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref> The democratic base comprises two widely diverging [[Demography of the United States|demographics]].  On one hand, there are those in the [[working class]], who are commonly conservative on social issues. On the other hand, it includes [[Educational attainment in the United States|well-educated]] and relatively [[Affluence in the United States|affluent]] [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]].<ref name="Pew Research Center.">{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=945|title=Pew Research Center.

The Democratic Party traces its origins to the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]], founded by [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and other influential opponents of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]]s in 1792. Since the division of the Republican Party in the election of [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]], it has consistently positioned itself to the [[Left-wing politics|left]] of the Republican Party in economic as well as social matters.  The economically left-leaning activist philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]], has shaped much of the party's economic agenda since [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]]. Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] [[New Deal coalition|coalition]] usually controlled the national government until 1964. The [[civil rights movement]] of the 1960s, championed by the party despite opposition at the time from its Southern wing, has continued to inspire the party's liberal principles.

== Current structure and composition ==
[[Image:Party affiliation USA.jpg|thumb|left|Registered Democrats, Republicans and Independents in millions<ref name="Neuhart, P. (22 January, 2004). Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats. ''USA Today'''."/>]]

The [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) is responsible for promoting Democratic campaign activities. While the DNC is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the Democratic Platform, the DNC is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy.  In presidential elections it supervises the [[Democratic National Convention]]. The national convention is, subject to the charter of the party, the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when it is in session, with the DNC running the party's organization at other times. The DNC is currently chaired by former Vermont Governor [[Howard Dean]].

The [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) assists party candidates in House races; its current chairman (selected by the party caucus) is Rep. [[Chris Van Hollen]] of Maryland. Similarly the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] (DSCC) raises large sums for Senate races. It is currently headed by Senator [[Charles E. Schumer]] of New York. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), currently chaired by Mike Gronstal of Iowa, is a smaller organization with much less funding that focuses on state legislative races. The DNC sponsors the [[College Democrats of America]] (CDA), a student-outreach organization with the goal of training and engaging a new generation of Democratic activists. [[Democrats Abroad]] is the organization for Americans living outside the United States; they work to advance the goals of the party and encourage Americans living abroad to support the Democrats. The [[Young Democrats of America]] (YDA) is a youth-led organization that attempts to draw in and mobilize young people for Democratic candidates, but operates outside of the DNC. The [[Democratic Governors Association]] (DGA) is an organization supporting the candidacies of Democratic gubernatorial nominees and incumbents; it is currently chaired by Governor [[Kathleen Sebelius]] of Kansas.

Each state also has a state committee, made up of elected committee members as well as ex-officio committee members (usually elected officials and representatives of major constituencies), which in turn elects a chair.  County, town, city and ward committees generally are comprised of individuals elected at the local level.  State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses, and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.  Rarely do they have much funding, but in 2005 DNC Chairman Dean began a program (called the "50 State Strategy") of using DNC national funds to assist all state parties and paying for full time professional staffers.<ref>{{cite news | last = Gilgoff | first = Dan | title = Dean's List | date = [[2006-07-16]] | url = http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060716/24dems.htm | publisher = [[U.S. News & World Report]] | accessdate = 2007-04-26}}</ref>

==Ideology and voter base==
{{see|Factions in the Democratic Party (United States)}}
[[Image:Democratic base.jpg|thumb|300px|Composition of the Democratic base according to a 2005 Pew Research Center study.]]

Since the 1890s, the Democratic Party has favored "[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]" positions (the term "liberal" in this sense describes [[social liberalism]], not [[classical liberalism]]).  In recent exit polls, the Democratic Party has had broad appeal across all socio-ethno-economic demographics.<ref name="CNN. (2000). Exit Poll.">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/results/index.epolls.html|title=CNN. (2000). Exit Poll.|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref><ref name="CNN. (2004).

(10 May, 2005). Beyond Red vs. Blue.">{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=945|title=Pew Research Center. (10 May, 2005). Beyond Red vs. Blue.|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> The Democratic Party is currently the nation's largest party. In 2004, roughly 72 million (42.6 percent) Americans were registered Democrats, compared to 55 million (32.5 percent) Republicans and 42 million (24.8 percent) independents.<ref name="Neuhart, P. (22 January, 2004). Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats. ''USA Today'''."/>

Historically, the party has favored farmers, laborers, labor unions, and religious and ethnic minorities; it has opposed unregulated business and finance, and favored progressive income taxes. In foreign policy, internationalism (including interventionism) was a dominant theme from 1913 to the mid 1960s. In the 1930s, the party began advocating welfare spending programs targeted at the poor. The party had a pro-business wing, typified by [[Al Smith]], that shrank in the 1930s. The [[Southern Democrats|Southern]] conservative wing shrank in the 1980s. The major influences for liberalism were labor unions (which peaked in the 1936-1952 era), and the [[African American]] wing, which has steadily grown since the 1960s. Since the 1970s, [[environmentalism]] has been a major new component.

In recent decades, the party has adopted a [[Centrism|centrists]] economic and more [[Social progressivism|socially progressive]] agenda, with the voter base having shifted considerably. Once dominated by unionized labor and the [[working class]], the Democratic base now consists of [[social liberalism|social liberals]] who tend to be well educated with above-average incomes as well as the socially more conservative working class. Today, Democrats advocate [[civil liberties]], social freedoms, equal rights, [[affirmative action]], [[fiscal responsibility]], and a [[Capitalism|free enterprise]] system tempered by government intervention ([[mixed economy]]). The economic policy adopted by the modern Democratic Party, including the former [[Clinton administration]], may also be referred to as the "[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndol.org/ndol_ci.cfm?kaid=128&subid=187&contentid=895|title=Democratic Leadership Council. (1 June, 1998). About the Third Way.|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref> The party believes that government should play a role in alleviating poverty and [[social injustice]], even if such requires a larger role for government and [[progressive tax]]ation. 

The Democratic Party, once dominant in the [[Southeastern United States]], is now strongest in the Northeast ([[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]]), [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]], as well as along the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] (especially [[Coastal California]]), including [[Hawaii]]. The Democrats are also strongest in [[List of United States cities by population|major cities]]. Recently, Democratic candidates have been faring better in some southern states, such as [[Virginia]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Florida]], and in the Rocky Mountain states, especially [[Colorado]] and [[Montana]].

====Ideologies====
{{main|Political ideologies in the United States}}
With over 72 million registered members, the Democartic Party is home to an ideologically diverse base. Progressives form the by far largest and most influential ideological demographic within the part.

====Progressives====
{{main|Modern liberalism in the United States|Liberalism in the United States|Progressivism in the United States}}
[[Image:Liberal opinions copy.jpg|thumb|350px|Opinions of liberals in a 2005 Pew Research Center study.]]

[[Social liberalism|Social liberals]], also referred to as progressives or Modern liberals, constitute a large part, about 45.6 percent, of the Democratic voter base. Liberals thereby form the largest united typological demographic within the Democratic base. According to the Pew Research Center liberals constitute roughly 19 percent of the electorate with 92 percent of American liberals favoring the Democratic Party.<ref name="Pew Research Center."/> While college-educated professionals were mostly Republican until the 1950s; they now comprise perhaps the most vital component of the Democratic Party.<ref name="Judis, B. J. (11 July, 2003). The trouble with Howard Dean. ''Salon.com''.">{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/07/11/dean/index.html|title=Judis, B. J. (11 July, 2003). The trouble with Howard Dean. ''Salon.com''.|accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> A majority of liberals favor diplomacy over military action, [[stem-cell research]], the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]], secular government, stricter [[gun control]] and environmental protection laws as well as the preservation of [[abortion rights]]. Immigration and cultural diversity is deemed positive; liberals favor [[cultural pluralism]], a system in which immigrants retain their native culture in addition to adopting their new culture. They tend to be rather divided on free trade agreements and organizations such as [[NAFTA]]. Most liberals oppose increased military standing and the display of the [[Ten Commandments]] in public buildings.<ref name="Pew Research Center."/>

This ideological group differs from the traditional organized labor base. According to the Pew Research Center, a plurality of 41% resided in [[mass affluent]] households and 49% were college graduates, the highest figure of any typographical group. It was also the fastest growing typological group between the late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref name="Pew Research Center."/> Liberals include most of academia<ref name="Kurtz, H. (29 March, 2005).

Exit Poll.">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/results/index.epolls.html|title=CNN. (2000). Exit Poll.|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref><ref name="CNN. (2004). Exit Poll."/><ref name="CNN.

Many [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] Democrats are descendants of the [[New Left]] of Democratic presidential candidate Senator [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota; others were involved in the presidential candidacies of [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] and U.S. Rep. [[Dennis Kucinich]] of [[Ohio]]; and still others are disaffected former members of the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]]. The [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] (CPC) is a caucus of progressive Democrats, and is the single largest Democratic caucus in the House of Representatives. Its members have included [[Dennis Kucinich]], [[John Conyers]] (Michigan), [[Jim McDermott]] (Washington), [[John Lewis (politician)|John Lewis]] (Georgia), the late Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] (Minnesota), [[Barbara Lee]] (California), [[Sherrod Brown]] (Ohio), and [[Bernie Sanders]] (I-VT).

====Civil libertarians====
[[Civil libertarian]]s also often support the Democratic Party because its positions on such issues as [[civil rights]] and [[separation of church and state]] are more closely aligned to their own than the positions of the Republican Party, and because the Democrats' economic agenda may be more appealing to them than that of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. They oppose gun control, the "[[Prohibition (drugs)|War on Drugs]],"  [[protectionism]], [[corporate welfare]], governmental borrowing, and an [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy. The Democratic Freedom Caucus is an organized group of this faction.

====Conservatives====
In the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the [[Blue Dog Democrats]], a caucus of fiscal and social conservatives and moderates, primarily southerners, forms part of the Democratic Party's current faction of [[Conservative Democrat]]s. They have acted as a unified voting bloc in the past, giving its forty plus members some ability to change legislation and broker compromises with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s leadership. [[Pro-life]] Democrats are sometimes classified as conservatives on the basis of [[social conservatism]].

====Centrists====
Though [[centrism|centrist]] Democrats differ on a variety of issues, they typically foster a mix of political views and ideas. Compared to other Democratic factions, they are mostly more supportive of the use of military force, including the war in Iraq, and are more willing to reduce government welfare, as indicated by their support for [[welfare reform]] and [[tax cuts]]. One of the most influential factions is the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC), a non-profit organization that advocates [[centrism|centrist]] positions for the party. The DLC hails President [[Bill Clinton]] as proof of the viability of [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]] politicians and a DLC success story. Former Representative [[Harold Ford, Jr.]] of [[Tennessee]] is its current chairman.

===Professionals===
While professionals, those who have a college education and whose work revolves around the conceptualization of ideas, have supported the Democratic Party by a slight majority since 2000. Between 1988 and 2000, professionals favored Democrats by a 12 percentage point marging. While the professional class was once a stronghold of the Republican Party it has become increasingly split between the two parties, leagning in favor of the Democratic Party. The increasing support for Democratic canidates among professionals may be traced to the prevalence of social liberal values among this group.<ref name="Judis & Teixeira">{{web cite |url=http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:bueazvJ1K7IJ:www.prospect.org/cs/articles%3Farticle%3Dback_to_the_future061807+liberals+demographic&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=14&gl=us

====Economists====
American [[Economist#United States|economists]] strongly support the Democratic Party, with their views on policy being largely in accordance with the Democratic platform.

====Academia====
[[Image:Academia politics.jpg|thumb|right|Percent of faculty members identifying as liberal and conservative by discipline.]]
Academicians, intellectuals and the highly [[Educational attainment|educated]] overall constitute an important part of the Democratic voter base. [[Academia]] in particular tends to be [[Modern liberalism in the United States|progressive]]. A 2005 survey, nearly three quarters, 72%, of full-time faculty members identified as liberal, while 15% identified as conservative. The [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]] were the most liberal disciplines while business was the most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]].

===Labor===
Since the 1930s, a critical component of the Democratic Party coalition has been [[Labor unions in the United States|organized labor]].  Labor unions supply a great deal of the money, grass roots political organization, and voting base of support for the party. The historic decline in union membership over the past half century has been accompanied by a growing disparity between public sector and private sector union membership percentages. The three most significant labor groupings in the Democratic coalition today are the [[AFL-CIO]] and [[Change to Win Federation|Change to Win]] [[National trade union center|labor federations]], as well as the [[National Education Association]], a large, unaffiliated [[teacher|teachers']] union. Both the AFL-CIO and Change to Win have identified their top legislative priority for 2007 as passage of the [[Employee Free Choice Act]]. Other important issues for labor unions include supporting [[industrial policy]] (including [[protectionism]]) that sustains unionized [[manufacturing]] jobs, raising the [[minimum wage]] and promoting broad social programs such as [[Social Security (United States)|social security]] and [[universal health care]].

====Working class====
{{see|Social class in the United States}}
[[Image:Gilbert class.jpg|thumb|300px|American social class model according to [[Dennis Gilbert]].<ref name="The American Class Structure">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1998 | title = The American Class Structure | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = New York | id = 0-534-50520-1}}</ref>]]

The working class is largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work. It consists mainly of [[Clerk#United States|clerical]] and [[blue collar]] workers.<ref name="The American Class Structure"/>Even though most in the working class are able afford an adequate standard of living, high economic insecurity and possible personal benefit from an extended social safety net, make the majority of working class person left-of-center on economic issues. Most working class Democrats differ from most liberals, however, in their socially more conservative views. Working class tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of liberals, respectively. Together socially conservative and the financially disadvantaged comprised roughly 54% of the Democratic base.<ref name="Pew Research Center."/> The continued importance of the working class votes manifests itself in recent CNN exit polls, which show the Democratic Party garner the majority of votes from those with low [[Income in the United States|incomes]] and little education.<ref name="CNN. (2000). Exit Poll."/><ref name="CNN. (2004). Exit Poll."/><ref name="CNN. (2006). Exit Poll."/>

===Ethnic Minorities===
A large portion of the Democratic voting base are [[Ethnic Minority|ethnic minorities]]. The Democrats positions on affirmative action, labor unions, and immigration have a strong appeal to many ethnic minorities.  

====African Americans====
From the end of the Civil War, [[African American]]s favored the Republican Party. However, they began drifting to the Democratic Party in the 1930s, as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt's]] [[New Deal]] programs gave economic relief to all minorities, including African Americans and [[Hispanics]].  Support for the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s by Democratic presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] helped give the Democrats even larger support among the African American community, although their position also alienated the [[Southern strategy|Southern White]] population.

====Hispanics====
The Hispanic population, particularly the large [[Mexican American]] population in the [[Southwest United States|Southwest]] and large [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]] and [[Dominican American|Dominican]] populations in the [[Northeast United States|Northeast]], have been strong supporters of the Democratic Party. Hispanics tend to be working class and, therefore, have left-leaning economic but socially conservative views. They are commonly opposed to [[homosexuality]] and [[abortion]], but favor liberal views on immigration. In the [[1996 U.S. Presidential Election]], Democratic President [[Bill Clinton]] received 72 percent of the Hispanic vote. Since then, however, the Republican Party has gained increasing support from the Hispanic community, especially among Hispanic Protestants and [[Pentecostalism|pentacostals]]. Along with Bush's much more liberal views on immigration, President Bush was the first Republican president to gain 40 percent of the Hispanic vote (he did so in the [[2004 U.S. Presidential Election]]). Yet, the Republican Party's support among Hispanics eroded in the [[United States House elections, 2006|2006 mid-term elections]], droping from 44 to 30 percent, with the Democrats gaining in the Hispanic vote from 55 percent in 2004 to 69 percent in 2006.<ref name="CNN. (2004). Exit Poll."/><ref name="CNN. (2006). Exit Poll."/> The shift in the Hispanic population's support back to the Democratic party was largely dued to the [[2006 United States immigration reform protests|Immigration Debate]] which was sparked by [[H.R. 4437]], a Republican supported enforcement only bill concerning [[illegal immigration]].

====Asian Americans====
The Democratic Party also has strong support in the small but growing [[Asian American]] population. The Asian population had been a stronghold of the Republican Party until the [[1992 United States Presidential Election|1992 Presidential]] in which [[George H. W. Bush]] won 55% of the Asian vote, compared to [[Bill Clinton]] winning 31%, and [[Ross Perot]] winning 15% of the Asian vote. Originally, the vast majority of Asian Americans consisted of [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese refugees]] and [[Filipino American|Filipinos]], the latter being economically and socially conservative. The Democratic party made gains among the Asian American population starting with 1996 and in 2006, won 62% of the Asian vote. This is dued to demographic shifts in the Asian American community, with growing numbers of [[Chinese American|Chinese]] and [[Indian American|Asian Indian]] immigrants that are typically economic centrist and [[Social progressivism|social progressives]].

====Others====
The Democratic Party also has strong support among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population, particularly in [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Montana]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]].

Jewish communities tend to be a stronghold for the Democratic Party, with more than 70% of Jewish voters having cast their ballots for the Democrats in the 2004 and 2006 elections.<ref name="CNN. (2004). Exit Poll."/><ref name="CNN. (2006). Exit Poll."/>

==Recent issue stances==
===Economic issues===
====Minimum wage====
Democrats favor a higher [[minimum wage]], and more regular increases, in order to assist the working poor. The [[Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007]] is an early component of the Democrats' agenda during the [[110th Congress]]. In 2006, the Democrats supported six state ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage; all six initiatives passed.

====Renewable energy and oil====
Democrats have opposed tax cuts and incentives to oil companies, favoring a policy of developing domestic [[renewable energy]]. Democratic governors have led the way in this issue, such as [[Montana|Montana's]] state-supported wind farm and "clean coal" programs.

====Fiscal responsibility====
Democrats believe that theirs is the party best able to achieve [[Balanced budget|fiscal responsibility]]. Democrats increasingly call for responsible tax policies and government spending that keeps the [[budget deficit]] under control. The Democratic-led House of Representatives reinstated the [[PAYGO]] (pay-as-you-go) budget rule at the start of the [[110th Congress]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Day Two: House passes new budget rules | date = [[2007-01-05]] | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16487187 | publisher = [[Associated Press]] | accessdate = 2007-01-05}}</ref> DNC Chairman [[Howard Dean]] has cited [[Bill Clinton]]'s presidency as a model for fiscal responsibility.

====Health care and insurance coverage====
Democrats call for "affordable and quality health care," and many advocate an expansion of government intervention in this area. Many Democrats favor a national health insurance system in a variety of forms to address the rising costs of modern health insurance. Some Democrats, such as Rep. [[John Dingell]] and Senator [[Edward Kennedy]], have called for a program of "[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] for All."<ref>[http://energycommerce.house.gov/medicare/medicareforall.shtml Medicare for All] ([[PDF]]). Retrieved on [[2007-01-25]].</ref>

Some Democratic governors have supported purchasing [[Canada|Canadian]] drugs, citing lower costs and budget restrictions as a primary incentive.  Recognizing that unpaid insurance bills increase costs to the service provider, who passes the cost on to health-care consumers, many Democrats advocate expansion of health insurance coverage.

====Environment====
The Democratic Party generally sides with [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]] and favors conservation of natural resources together with strong environmental laws against pollution. Democrats support preservation of endangered lands and species, clean land management and regulation on pollutants.

The most contentious and concerning environmental issue championed by the party is [[global warming]]. Democrats, most notably former Vice President [[Al Gore]], have pressed for stern regulation of [[greenhouse gases]]. However, Gore has come under fire for his house using large amounts of energy. <ref>{{web cite |url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/bush/house.asp |title=Email compares George W. Bush's eco-friendly ranch with Al Gore's energy-expending mansion |accessdate=2007-09-26 |publisher=snopes.com}}</ref>

====College education====
Most Democrats have the long term aim of having low-cost, publicly funded college education with low tuition fees (like in much of continental Europe) which should be available to every eligible American student, or alternatively, with increasing state funding for student financial aid such as the [[Pell grant]] or college tuition tax-deduction.<ref>{{cite web | title = Clinton Joins Key Senate Democrats to Release Report on "The College Cost Crunch" | date = [[2006-06-28]] | url = http://clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=258005 | work = clinton.senate.gov | accessdate = 2006-11-25}}</ref><ref>[http://www.democrats.org/a/national/economic_growth/ Economic Prosperity and Educational Excellence]. Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[11-25]].</ref>

====Trade agreements====
The Democratic Party has a mixed record on [[international trade]] agreements that reflects a diversity of viewpoints in the party. The liberal and [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] wing of the party, including the intelligentsia and college-educated professionals overall tend to favor [[globalization]], while the organized labor wing of the party opposes it.<ref name="Rorty, R. (1997). ''Acheiving Our Country: Leftist Though In Twenthieth Century America''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.">Rorty, R. (1997). ''Acheiving Our Country: Leftist Though In Twenthieth Century America''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> In the 1990s, the Clinton administration and a number of prominent Democrats pushed through a number of agreements such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).  Since then, the party's shift away from free trade became evident in the [[Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement|Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) vote, with 15 House Democrats voting for the agreement and 187 voting against.<ref>{{cite news |last= Weisman |first=Jonathan |title=CAFTA Reflects Democrats' Shift From Trade Bills |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date=[[2005-07-06]] |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/05/AR2005070501345_pf.html |accessdate=2006-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Nichols |first=John |title=CAFTA Vote Outs "Bush Democrats" |publisher=[[The Nation]] |date=[[2005-07-28]] |url=http://www.thenation.com/blogs/thebeat?bid=1&pid=8874 |accessdate=2006-12-15}}</ref>

In his 1997 ''Achieving Our Country'', [[philosopher]] [[Richard Rorty]], [[professor]] at [[Stanford University]] states that economic globalization "invites two responses from the Left. The first is two insist that the inequalities between nations need to be mitigated... The second is to insist that the primary responsibility of each democratic nation-state is to its own least advantaged citizens... the first response suggests that the old democracies should open their borders, whereas the second suggests that they should close them. The first response comes naturally to academic leftists, who have always been internationally minded. The second comes naturally to members of trade unions, and to marginally employed people who can most easily be recruited into right-wing populist movements." (p. 88)<ref name="Rorty, R. (1997). ''Acheiving Our Country: Leftist Though In Twenthieth Century America''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.">Rorty, R. (1997). ''Acheiving Our Country: Leftist Though In Twenthieth Century America''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref>

====Alternate Minimum Tax====

While the Democratic Party is in support of a progressive tax structure, it has vowed to adjust the [[Alternate Minimum Tax]] (AMT). The tax was originally designed to tax the rich but now may affect many mass affluent households, especially those with [[Income in the United States|incomes]] between $75,000 to $100,000. The party proposed to re-adjust the tax in such manner as to restore its initial intention. According to a 2007 Reuters News Report, "House Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Charles Rangel]] has said he will push for permanent AMT relief for those taxpayers who were never meant to pay it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN1322551420070415|title=Smith, D. (14 April, 2007). Democrat says middle class tax relief a priority. ''Reuters''.|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref>

===Social issues===
====Discrimination====
The Democratic Party supports [[Equal Opportunity Employment|Equal Opportunity]] for all Americans regardless of sex, age, race, sexual orientation, religion, creed, or national origin.

The Democratic Party mostly supports [[affirmative action]] as a way to redress past discrimination and ensure equitable employment regardless of ethnicity or gender, but opposes the use of quotas in hiring.  Democrats also strongly support the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] to prohibit discrimination against people on the basis of physical or mental disability.

====Same-sex marriage and [[LGBT]] rights====
The Democratic Party is divided on the subject of [[same-sex marriage]]. Some members favor [[civil union]]s for same-sex couples, liberals commonly favor legalized marriage, and others are opposed to same-sex marriage on religious grounds. The 2004 Democratic National Platform stated that marriage should be defined at the state level and it repudiated the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]]. Almost all agree, however, that discrimination against persons because of their sexual orientation is wrong, support [[adoption]] rights for same sex couples, and also oppose the military's "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" policy.

====Reproductive rights====
Most members of the Democratic Party believe that all women should have access to [[birth control]], and supports public funding of contraception for poor women. The Democratic Party, in its national platforms since 1992, has called for [[abortion]] to be "safe, legal and rare"—namely, keeping it legal by rejecting laws that allow governmental interference in abortion decisions, and reducing the number of abortions by promoting both knowledge of reproduction and contraception, and incentives for adoption. When Congress voted on the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] in 2003, Congressional Democrats were split, with a minority—including current Senate [[Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]]—supporting the ban, and the majority of Democrats opposing the legislation.

The Democratic Party opposes attempts to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which declared abortion to be a Constitutionally-protected right, and ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' which lays out the legal framework in which government action alleged to violate that right is assessed by courts.  As a matter of the [[Privacy|right to privacy]] and of [[feminism|gender equality]], many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference. They believe that each woman, conferring with her conscience, has the right to choose for herself whether abortion is morally correct. Many Democrats also believe that poor women should have a right to publicly funded abortions.

====Stem cell research====
The Democratic Party has voiced overwhelming support for all [[stem cell research]] with federal funding. In his 2004 platform, [[John Kerry]] affirmed his support of federally funded stem-cell research "under the strictest ethical guidelines." He explained, "We will not walk away from the chance to save lives and reduce human suffering."

===Foreign policy issues===
====Invasion of Afghanistan====
Democrats in the House of Representatives and United States Senate near-unanimously voted for the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force|authorization of military force]] against "those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States" in [[Afghanistan]] in 2001, supporting the [[NATO]] coalition invasion of the nation. Most elected Democrats continue in their support of the Afghanistan conflict, and some have voiced concerns that the Iraq War is shifting too many resources away from the presence in Afghanistan.

====Iraq War====
In 2002, Democrats were divided as most in the Senate voted for the [[Iraq Resolution|authorization of the use of force against Iraq]] while a majority of Democrats in the House (81 for, 126 against) voted against it. Since then, many prominent Democrats have expressed regret about this decision, such as former Senator [[John Edwards]], and have called it a mistake, while others, such as Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] have criticized the conduct of the war but not repudiated their initial vote for it. Amongst lawmakers, Democrats are the most vocal critics of the [[Iraq War]] and the President's management of the war. Democrats in the House of Representatives near-unanimously supported a [[non-binding resolution]] disapproving of President Bush's decision to send [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|additional troops into Iraq in 2007]]. Congressional Democrats overwhelmingly supported military funding legislation which included a provision that set "a timeline for the withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq" by [[March 31]] [[2008]], but also would leave combat forces in Iraq for purposes such as targeted counter-terrorism operations.<ref>{{cite news | last = Flaherty | first = Anne | title = Congress passes Iraq bill, veto awaits | url = http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/04/26/veto_awaits_iraq_troop_withdrawal_bill/ | date = [[2007-04-26]] | publiser = [[Associated Press]] accessdate = 2007-04-26}}.</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = US Democrats push for 2008 Iraq exit | url = http://news.brisbanetimes.com.au/us-democrats-push-for-2008-iraq-exit/20075426-9l4.html | date = [[2007-04-26]] | publisher = [[Reuters]] | accessdate = 2007-04-26}}</ref> After a veto from the president, and a failed attempt in Congress to override the veto,<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Democrats fail to override Bush on war funding | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/02/africa/prexy.php | date = [[2007-05-02]] | publisher = [[International Herald Tribune]] | accessdate = 2007-05-02}}</ref> the [[U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007]] was passed by Congress and signed by the president after the timetable was dropped.

====Unilateralism====
Democrats usually oppose the doctrine of [[unilateralism]], which dictates that the United States should use military force without any assistance from other nations whenever it believes there is a threat to its security or welfare. They believe the United States should act in the international arena in concert with strong alliances and broad international support. This was a major foreign policy issue of [[John Kerry]]'s 2004 presidential campaign; his platform attributed rifts with international allies to unilateralism.

In a general sense, the modern Democratic Party is more closely aligned with the [[international relations theory|international relations theories]] of [[liberal international relations theory|liberalism]],  [[neoliberalism in international relations|neoliberalism]], and [[functionalism in international relations|functionalism]] than [[realism (international relations)|realism]] and [[neorealism]], though realism has some influence on the party.

===Legal issues===
====Torture====
Democrats are opposed to use of [[torture]] against individuals apprehended and held prisoner by the military of the United States, and deny that categorizing military prisoners as [[unlawful combatants]] excludes them from the rights granted under the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Democrats contend that torture is inhumane, decreases the United States' moral standing in the world, and produces questionable results.

====USA PATRIOT Act====
All Democrats in the U.S. Senate except for [[Wisconsin]] Senator [[Russ Feingold]] voted for the original [[USA PATRIOT Act]] legislation. After voicing concerns over the "invasion of privacy" and other [[civil liberties|civil liberty]] restrictions of the Act, the Democrats split on the renewal in 2006. Most Democratic Senators voted to renew it, while most Democratic Representatives voted against renewal. It should be noted renewal was only allowed after many of the most invasive clauses in the Act were removed or curbed.

====Right to privacy====
The Democratic Party believes that individuals should have a [[right to privacy]], and generally supports laws which place restrictions on law-enforcement and intelligence agency monitoring of U.S. citizens. Some Democratic Party officeholders have championed consumer-protection laws that limit the sharing of consumer data between corporations. Most Democrats believe that government should not regulate consensual non-commercial sexual conduct (among adults), as a matter of personal privacy.

====Crime====
Democrats often focus on methods of crime prevention, believing that preventive measures save taxpayers' money in prison, policing and medical costs, and prevent crime and murder. They emphasize improved community policing and more on-duty police officers in order to help accomplish this goal. The party's platform in 2000 and 2004 cited crackdowns on [[gang]]s and [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] as preventive methods. The party's platforms have also addressed the issue of domestic violence, calling for strict penalties for offenders and protection for victims.

====Gun control====
With a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various [[Gun politics|gun control]] measures, most notably the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]], the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]] of 1993 and Crime Control Act of 1994.  However, many Democrats, especially rural, Southern, and Western Democrats, favor fewer restrictions on firearm possession and warned the party was defeated in the 2000 presidential election in rural areas because of the issue.<ref>{{cite news |last=Abramsky |first=Sasha |title=Democrat Killer? |publisher=[[The Nation]] |date=[[2005-04-18]] |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050418/abramsky |accessdate=2006-10-10}}</ref> In the national platform for 2004, the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 [[Federal assault weapons ban|Assault Weapons Ban]].

==History==
{{main|History of the United States Democratic Party}}
<!-- This is a summary.  For extensive, detailed edits, edit the main history article.  Simple edits without bloat of the summary are welcome. Comment added April 2007. -->

The Democratic Party evolved from the [[Anti-federalist]] factions that opposed the [[Hamiltonian economic program|fiscal policies]] of [[Alexander Hamilton]] in the early 1790s when [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]] organized the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]]. The party's favored states' rights, strict construction of the Constitution, opposition to a national bank, and opposition to moneyed interests. It ascended to power in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]]. After the [[War of 1812]], the party's chief rival, the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]], disbanded. The party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles was later led by [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] became the chief rival of the Democrats until the 1850s. As the Democrats became increasingly associated with "[[The Slave Power]]," and the Whigs splintered over the issue of slavery and faded away, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] emerged in the 1850s in opposition to the expansion of slavery and in support of modernization.

The Democrats split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Buchanan]] along Northern and Southern lines, while the Republican Party gained an ascendancy in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|election of 1860]]. As the [[American Civil War]] broke out, Northern Democrats were divided into [[War Democrats]] and [[Peace Democrats]]. Most War Democrats rallied to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the Republicans' [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]]. The Democrats benefited from white Southerners' resentment of [[Reconstruction]] after the war and consequent hostility to the Republican Party. After [[Redeemers]] ended Reconstruction in the 1870s, and the disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in the 1890s, the South, voting Democratic, became known as the "[[Solid South]]." Though Republicans continued to control the White House until 1884, the Democrats remained competitive. The party was dominated by pro-business [[Bourbon Democrats]] led by [[Samuel J. Tilden]] and [[Grover Cleveland]], who represented mercantile, banking and railroad interests, opposed imperialism and overseas expansion, fought for the gold standard, opposed bimetallism, and crusaded against corruption, high taxes, and tariffs. Cleveland was elected to non-consecutive presidential terms in 1884 and 1892.

Agrarian Democrats demanding [[free silver]] overthrew the Bourbon Democrats in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] for the presidency (a nomination repeated by Democrats in 1900 and 1908). Bryan waged a vigorous campaign attacking Eastern moneyed interests, but he lost to Republican [[William McKinley]]. The Democrats took control of the House in 1910 and elected [[Woodrow Wilson]] as president in 1912 and 1916. Wilson led Congress to, in effect, put to rest the issues of tariffs, money, and antitrust that had dominated politics for 40 years with new progressive laws. The [[Great Depression]] in 1929 that occurred under Republican President [[Herbert Hoover]] and the Republican Congress set the stage for a more liberal government; the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives nearly uninterrupted from 1931 until 1995 and won most presidential elections until 1968. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], elected to presidency in 1932, came forth with government programs called the [[New Deal]]. New Deal liberalism meant the promotion of social welfare, labor unions, civil rights, and regulation of business. The opponents, who stressed long-term growth, support for business, and low taxes, started calling themselves "conservatives." 

Issues facing parties and the United States after the [[Second World War]] included the [[Cold War]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Republicans attracted conservatives and white Southerners from the Democratic coalition with their resistance to New Deal and [[Great Society]] liberalism and the Republicans' use of the [[Southern Strategy]]. African Americans, who traditionally supported the Republican Party, began supporting Democrats following the ascent of the Franklin Roosevelt administration, the New Deal, and the Civil Rights movement. The Democratic Party's main base of support shifted to the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], marking a dramatic reversal of history. [[Bill Clinton]] was elected to the presidency in 1992 and 1996 and governed as a [[New Democrat]] while the Democratic Party lost control of Congress in the [[Republican Revolution|election of 1994]] to the Republican Party; the Democratic Party [[United States general elections, 2006|regained majority control of Congress in 2006]]. Some of the party's key issues in the early 21st century have included the methods of how to combat terrorism, homeland security, labor rights, environmentalism, and the preservation of liberal government programs.

==Symbols and name==
[[Image:Democraticjackass.jpg|thumb|180px|"A Live Jackass Kicking a Dead Lion" by Thomas Nast. ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's Weekly]]'', [[January 19]], [[1870]].]]
In the 1790s, the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] deliberately used the terms "Democrat" and "Democratic Party" as insults against Jeffersonians. For example, in 1798, [[George Washington]] wrote that "you could as soon scrub the blackamore white, as to change the principles of a profest Democrat; and that he will leave nothing unattempted to overturn the Government of this Country."<ref>{{cite web |title = George Washington to James McHenry, September 30, 1798 |url = http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=mgw4&fileName=gwpage113.db&recNum=107 |accessdate = 2006-10-12}} [http://www.pbs.org/georgewashington/collection/post_pres_1798sep30.html Transcript].</ref> By the 1830s, however, the term that had once been considered an insult became the party's name. In the late 19th century, the term "The Democracy" was in common use for the party.

The most common symbol for the party is the [[donkey]], although the party itself never officially adopted this symbol.<ref>[http://www.democrats.org/a/2005/06/history_of_the.php History of the Democratic Donkey]. Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[11-15]].</ref> The origins of this symbol are unknown, but several theories have been proposed. According to one theory, in its original form, the jackass was born in the intense mudslinging that occurred during the presidential race of [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828]] in which [[Andrew Jackson]] was sometimes called a jackass by his opponents. A [[political cartoon]] depicting Jackson riding and directing a donkey (representing the Democratic Party) was published in 1837. A political cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] in an 1870 edition of ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's Weekly]]'' revived the donkey as a symbol for the Democratic Party. Cartoonists followed Nast and used the donkey to represent the Democrats, and the elephant to represent the Republicans.

In the early 20th century, the traditional symbol of the Democratic Party in [[Midwest|Midwestern states]] such as [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Ohio]] was the [[rooster]], as opposed to the Republican [[eagle]]. This symbol still appears on Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Indiana [[ballot]]s. For the majority of the 20th century, [[Missouri]] Democrats used the [[Statue of Liberty]] as their ballot [[emblem]]. This meant that when [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian]] candidates received [[ballot access]] in Missouri in 1976, they could not use the Statue of Liberty, their national symbol, as the ballot emblem. Missouri Libertarians instead used the [[Liberty Bell]] until 1995, when the [[mule]] became Missouri's state animal. From 1995 to 2004, there was some confusion among voters, as the Democratic ticket was marked with the Statue of Liberty, and it seemed that the Libertarians were using a donkey.

Although both major political parties (and many minor ones) use the traditional American red, white, and blue colors in their marketing and representations, since election night [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] the color blue has become the identified color of the Democratic Party, while the color red has become the identified color of the opposition [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. That night, for the first time, all major broadcast television networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: [[blue states]] for [[Al Gore]] (Democratic nominee) and red states for [[George W. Bush]] (Republican nominee). Since then, the color blue has been widely used by the media to represent the party, much to the confusion of non-American observers, as blue is the traditional color of the [[right-wing politics|right]] and red the color of the [[left-wing politics|left]] outside of the United States (c.f. red for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] and blue for the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] in [[Canada]], or red for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and blue for [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] in the [[United Kingdom]]). Blue has also been used by party supporters for promotional efforts (e.g BuyBlue, BlueFund) and by the party itself, which in 2006 unveiled the "Red to Blue Program" to support Democratic candidates running against Republican incumbents in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]].

[[Jefferson-Jackson Day]] is the most common name given to the annual fundraising celebration held by local chapters of the Democratic Party. It is named after Presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Andrew Jackson]], whom the party regards as its distinguished early leaders.

The song "[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]" is the unofficial song of the Democratic Party. It was used prominently when [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] was nominated for president at the [[1932 Democratic National Convention]] and remains a sentimental favorite for Democrats today. More recently, the emotionally similar song "[[Beautiful Day]]" by the band [[U2]] has become a favorite theme song for Democratic candidates. [[John Kerry]] used the song during his 2004 presidential campaign, and it was used as a celebratory tune by several Democratic Congressional candidates in 2006.<ref>{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Gruss | title = Local roast becomes political pep rally for Democrats | publisher = [[The Virginian-Pilot]] | date = [[2006-11-21]] | url = http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=114762&ran=246752 | accessdate = 2007-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Scherer | title = 'The Democrats are ready to lead' | publisher = [[Salon.com]] | date = [[2006-11-08]] | url = http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/11/08/pelosi/ | accessdate = 2007-03-18}}</ref>
