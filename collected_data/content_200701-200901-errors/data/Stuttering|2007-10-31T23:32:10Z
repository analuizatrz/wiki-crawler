'''Stuttering''', also known as '''stammering''' in the [[United Kingdom]], is a [[speech disorder]] in which the flow of [[Speech communication|speech]] is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks in which the stutterer is unable to produce sounds. 'Verbal non-fluency' is the accepted{{Fact|date=September 2007}} umbrella term for such [[speech impediment]]s. The term ''stuttering'' is most commonly associated with involuntary sound repetition, but it also encompasses the abnormal hesitation or pausing before speech, referred to by stutterers as ''blocks'', and the prolongation of certain sounds, usually [[vowel]]s. Much of what constitutes "stuttering" cannot be noted by the listener; this includes such things as sound and word fears, situational fears, anxiety, tension, [[self-pity]], stress, shame, and a feeling of "loss of control" during speech. The emotional state of the individual who stutters in response to the stuttering often constitutes the most difficult aspect of the disorder.  The term "stuttering", as popularly used, covers a wide spectrum of severity: it may encompass individuals with barely perceptible impediments, for whom the disorder is largely cosmetic, as well as others with extremely severe symptoms, for whom the problem can effectively prevent most oral communication.

Stuttering is generally not a problem with the physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words. Despite popular perceptions to the contrary, stuttering does not affect and has no bearing on intelligence. Apart from their speech impediment, people who stutter may well be 'normal' in the clinical sense of the term. Anxiety, low confidence, nervousness, and stress therefore do not cause stuttering ''per se'', although they are very often the result of living with a highly stigmatized disability and, in turn, exacerbate the problem. 

The disorder is also ''variable'', which means that in certain situations, such as talking on the telephone, the stuttering might be more severe or less, depending on the anxiety level connected with that activity. In other situations, such as singing (as with [[country music]] star [[Mel Tillis]] or pop singer [[Gareth Gates]]) or speaking alone (or reading from a script, as with actor [[James Earl Jones]] and broadcast journalist [[John Stossel]]), fluency improves. (It is thought that speech production in these situations, as opposed to normal spontaneous speech, may involve a different neurological function.)  Some very mild stutterers, such as [[Bob Newhart]], have used the disorder to their advantage, although more severe stutterers very often face serious hurdles in their social and professional lives. Although the exact [[etiology]] of stuttering is unknown, both [[genetics]] and [[neurophysiology]] are thought to contribute. Although there are many treatments and [[speech therapy]] techniques available that may help increase [[fluency]] in some stutterers, there is essentially no "cure" for the disorder at present.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

==Classification==
Developmental stuttering is stuttering that originates when a child is learning to speak and develops as the child matures into adulthood. Other speech disorders with symptoms resembling stuttering are [[cluttering]], [[Parkinson's disease#Motor symptoms|Parkinson's speech]], [[essential tremor]], [[spasmodic dysphonia]] and [[social anxiety]].

==Characteristics==
===Primary behaviors===
Primary stuttering behaviors are the overt, observable signs of speech fluency breakdown, including repeating sounds, syllables, words or phrases, silent blocks and prolongation of sounds. These differ in from the normal disfluencies found in all speakers in that that stuttering disfluencies may last longer, occur more frequently, and are produced with more effort and strain.<ref name =W56>{{cite book

*'''Repetition''' occurs when a ''unit of speech'', such as a sound, syllable, word, or phrase is repeated and are typical in children who are beginning to stutter. 
*'''Prolongations''' are the unnatural lengthening of [[continuant]] sounds, for example,"mmmmmmmmmilk".  Prolongations are also common in children beginning to stutter.
*'''Blocks''' are inappropriate cessation of sound and air, often associated with freezing of the movement of the tongue, lips and/or vocal folds. Blocks often develop later, and can be associated with muscle tension and effort.<ref name =Guitar>{{Cite book

===Secondary behaviors===
Secondary stuttering behaviors are unrelated to speech production and are learned behaviors which become linked to the primary behaviors. 

Secondary behaviors include escape behaviors, in which a stutterer attempts to terminate a moment of stuttering. Examples might be physical movements such as sudden loss of eye contact, eye-blinking, head jerks, hand tapping, interjected "starter" sounds and words, such as "um," "ah," "you know".<ref>Ward, pp.6–7</ref><ref>Guitar, pp.16</ref>  In many cases, these devices work at first, and are therefore reinforced, becoming a habit that is subsequently difficult to break.<ref>Guitar, pp.16</ref>

Secondary behaviors also refer to the use of avoidance strategies such avoiding specific words, people or situations that the person finds difficult. Some stutterers successfully use extensive avoidance of situations and words to maintain fluency and may have little or no evidence of primary stuttering behaviors.  Such covert stutterers often have high levels of anxiety, and extreme fear of even the most mild disfluency.<ref>Ward, pp.6–7</ref>

====Variability====
The severity of a stutter is often not constant even for severe stutterers.  Stutterers commonly report dramatically increased fluency when talking in unison with another speaker, copying another's speech, whispering, singing, and acting or when talking to [[pets]], young children, or themselves.<ref> Ward, pp. 13-14</ref>  Other situations, such as public speaking and speaking on the telephone are often greatly feared by stutterers, and increased stuttering reported.<ref> Ward, pp. 14</ref>

===Feelings and attitudes===
Stuttering may have a significant negative cognitive and affective impact on the stutterer.  In a famous analogy, Joseph Sheehan, a prominent researcher in the field, compared stuttering to an iceberg, with the overt aspects of stuttering above the waterline, and the larger mass of negative emotions invisible below the surface.<ref> Kalinowski and Saltuklaroglu, pp. 17</ref> Feelings of embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger guilt are frequent in stutterers,<ref> Ward, pp. 179</ref> and may actually increase tension and effort, leading to increased stuttering.<ref> Guitar, pp. 16-7</ref>  With time, continued exposure to difficult speaking experiences may crystallize into a negative self-concept and self-image. A stutterer may project his attitudes onto others, believing that they think he is nervous or stupid. Such negative feelings and attitudes may need to be a major focus of a treatment program.<ref> Guitar, pp. 16-7</ref>

==Sub-types==
===Developmental===
Stuttering is typically a [[developmental disorder]] beginning in early childhood and continuing into adulthood at least 20% of children of those affected.<ref name="craig2005">{{cite journal |author=
 Craig A, Tran Y|title=The epidemiology of stuttering: The need for reliable estimates of prevalence and anxiety levels over the lifespan|journal= Advances in Speech–Language Pathology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=41-46 |year=2005 |pmid=17429528 |doi=}}</ref>
The mean onset of stuttering is 30 months, or two and a half years old.<ref name="fn 30"/>
As [[Speech communication|speech]] and [[language]] are difficult and complex skills to learn, almost all children have some difficulty in developing these skills. This results in normal dysfluencies that tend to be single-syllable, whole-word or phrase repetitions, [[interjections]], brief pauses, or revisions. In the early years, a child will not usually exhibit visible tension, frustration or anxiety when speaking dysfluently and most will be unaware of the interruptions in their speech. With young stutterers, their dysfluency tends to be episodic, and periods of stuttering are followed by periods of relative fluency. This pattern remains through all stages of a stutterer's development, but as the stutter develops, the dysfluencies tend to develop more into repetitions and sound prolongations, often combined together (e.g., "Lllllets g-g-go there").

Usually by the age of six, a stutter is exacerbated when the child is excited, upset or under some type of pressure. Also around this age, a child will start to become aware of problems in his or her speech. After this age, stuttering includes repetitions, prolongations, and blocks. It also becomes more and more chronic, with longer periods of disfluency.  Secondary motor behaviors (eye blinking, lip movements, etc.) may be used during moments of stuttering or frustration. Also, fear and avoidance of sounds, words, people, or speaking situations usually begin at this time, along with feelings of embarrassment and shame. By age 14 , the stutter is usually classified as an "Advanced stutter," characterized by frequent and noticeable interruptions, with poor [[eye contact]] and the use of various tricks to disguise the stuttering. Along with a mature stutter come advanced feelings of fear and increasingly frequent avoidance of unfavorable speaking situations. Around this time many become fully aware of their disorder and begin to identify themselves as "stutterers." With this may come deeper frustration, embarrassment and shame.

===Acquired===
In rare cases, stuttering may acquired in adulthood as the results of neurological event such as a head injury, tumour, stroke or drug abuse/misuse. The stuttering has different characteristics from its developmental equivalent: it tends to be limited to part-word or sound repetitions, and is associated with a relative lack of anxiety and secondary stuttering behaviors. Techniques such as altered auditory feedback (see below) which may promote fluency in stutterers with the developmental condition, are not effective with the acquired type.<ref name="craig2005"/><ref> Ward, pp.4, 332-335</ref> 

Psychogenic stuttering may also arise after a traumatic experience such as a bereavement, the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma. Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous: the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant events, it is constant and uninfluenced that different speaking situations, and there is initial little awareness or concern shown by the speaker in their speech.<ref> Ward, pp. 4, 332, 335-337 </ref>

==Causes of developmental stuttering==
No single, exclusive cause of developmental stuttering is known. A variety of hypotheses and theories suggest multiple factors contributing to stuttering.<ref>Guitar, pp. 5-6</ref><ref>Ward, pp.14-15</ref>
Among these is the strong evidence that stuttering has a genetic basis.<ref>Guitar, pp. 5-6</ref> Children who have first-degree relatives who stutter are three times as likely to develop a stutter.<ref>Ward, pp. 11</ref> However, twin and adoption studies suggest that genetic factors interact with environmental factors for stuttering to occur,<ref>Guitar, pp. 66</ref> and forty to seventy percent of stutterers have no family history of the disorder.<ref>Guitar, pp. 39</ref>
There is evidence that stuttering is more common in children who also have concommitant speech, language, learning or motor difficulties.<ref>Ward, pp. 12</ref>

In some stutterers, congenital factors may play a role.  These may include physical trauma at or around birth, including cerebral palsy, retardation, or stressful situations, such as the birth of a sibling, moving, or a sudden growth in linguistic ability.<ref>Guitar, pp. 66</ref><ref>Guitar, pp. 5-6</ref>   

Brain scans of adult stutterers have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.<ref>Guitar, pp. 66</ref>

==Treatment==

===Fluency shaping therapy===
Fluency shaping therapy trains stutterers to speak fluently by relaxing their breathing, vocal folds, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue).

Stutterers are usually trained to breathe with their diaphragms, gently increase vocal fold tension at the beginning of words (gentle onsets), slow their speaking rate by stretching vowels, and reduce articulatory pressure. The result is slow, monotonic, but fluent speech. This abnormal-sounding speech is used only in the speech clinic. After the stutterer masters these target speech behaviors, speaking rate and prosody (emotional intonation) are increased, until the stutterer sounds normal. This normal-sounding, fluent speech is then transferred to daily life outside the speech clinic.

===Stuttering modification therapy===
The goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering but to modify it so that stuttering is easier and less effortful.<ref> Ward, pp.253</ref>  The rationale is that since fear and anxiety causes increased stuttering, using easier stuttering and with less fear and avoidance, stuttering will decrease.  The most widely known approach was published by Charles Van Riper in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy.<ref> Ward, pp. 245</ref>

As proposed by Van Riper, stuttering modification therapy has four overlapping stages:<ref> Ward, pp. 247-253</ref>

*In the first stage, called identification, the stutterer and clinician identify the core behaviors, secondary behaviors, and feelings and attitudes that characterize the stuttering.
*In the second stage, called desensitization, the stutterer works to reduce fear and and anxiety by freezing stuttering behaviors, confronting difficult sounds, words and situations, and intentionally stuttering ("voluntary stuttering").
*In the third stage, called modification, the stutterer learns "easy stuttering." This is done by "cancellations" (stopping in a dysfluency, pausing a few moments, and saying the word again); "pull-outs," or pulling out of a dysfluency into fluent speech; and "preparatory sets," or looking ahead for words one may stutter on, and using "easy stuttering" on those words.
*In the fourth stage, called stabilization, the stutterer prepares practice assignments, makes preparatory sets and pull-outs automatic, and changes their self-concept from being a person who stutters to being a person who speaks fluently most of the time but who occasionally stutters mildly.

===Anti-stuttering devices===
{{seealso|Anti-stuttering devices}}
Altered auditory feedback, so that stutterers hears their voice differently, has been used for over 50 years in the treatment of stuttering.<ref name="bothe2007">{{cite journal |author=
 Bothe AK, Finn P, Bramlett RE |title=Pseudoscience and the SpeechEasy: Reply to Kalinowski, Saltuklaroglu, Stuart, and Guntupalli (2007)|journal= American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology |volume=16 |issue= |pages=77-83 |year=2007 |pmid=17329678 |doi=}}</ref>  Altered auditory feedback effect can be produced by speaking in chorus with another person, by providing blocking out the stutterer's voice while talking (masking), by delaying the stutterer's voice slightly (delayed auditory feedback) and/or by altering the frequency of the feedback (frequency altered feedback).  Studies of these techniques have had mixed results, with some stutterers showing substantial reductions in stuttering, while others improved only slightly or not at all.<ref name="bothe2007"/>  In a 2006 review of the efficacy of stuttering treatments, none of the studies on altered auditory feedback met the criteria for experimental quality, including the absence of control groups.<ref name =Bothe2006I>{{cite journal |author=Bothe AK,Davidow JH, Bramlett RE, Ingham RJ |title=Stuttering Treatment Research 1970-2005: I.

===Anti-stuttering medications===
The effectiveness of pharmacological agents, such as [[anti-convulsant]]s, [[anti-depressants]], [[antipsychotic]] and [[antihypertensive]] medications, and [[dopamine antagonists]] in the treatment of stuttering has been evaluated in studies involving both adults and children.<ref name =Bothe2006>{{cite journal |author=Bothe AK, Davidow JH, Bramlett RE, Franic DM, Ingham RJ |title=Stuttering Treatment Research 1970-2005: II.

A comprehensive review of pharmacological treatments of stuttering in 2006 concluded that few of the drug trials were methodologically sound.<ref name =Bothe2006/>  Of those that were, only one, not unflawed study,<ref name="fn 12"> {{cite journal |author=Maguire GA, Riley GD, Franklin DL, Gottschalk LA |title=Risperidone for the treatment of stuttering |journal=Journal of clinical psychopharmacology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=479–82 |year=2000 |pmid=10917410 |doi=}}</ref> showed a reduction in stuttering to less than 5%. In addition, potentially serious side effects of pharmacological treatments were noted.<ref name =Bothe2006/>

==Prognosis==
Among preschoolers, the prognosis for recovery is good.  Based on research, about 65% of preschoolers who stutter recover spontaneously in the first two years of stuttering,<ref name="fn 30">{{cite journal |author=Yairi E, Ambrose N |title=Onset of stuttering in preschool children: selected factors |journal=Journal of speech and hearing research |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=782–8 |year=1992 |pmid=1405533 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="fn 31">Yairi E (1993).

Once stuttering has become established, and the child has developed secondary behaviors, the prognosis is more guarded,<ref>Guitar, pp. 7</ref> and only 18% of children who stutter after five years recover spontaneously.<ref name=fn 32">{{cite journal |author=Andrews G, Craig A, Feyer AM, Hoddinott S, Howie P, Neilson M |title=Stuttering: a review of research findings and theories circa 1982 |journal=The Journal of speech and hearing disorders |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=226–46 |year=1983 |pmid=6353066 |doi=}}</ref> However, with treatment young children may be left with little evidence of stuttering.<ref>Guitar, pp. 7</ref> 

With adult stutterers, there is no known cure,<ref>Ward, pp. 16</ref> though they may make partial recovery with intervention. Stutterers often learn to stutter less severely and be less affected emotionally, though others may make no progress with therapy.<ref>Guitar, pp. 7</ref>

==Societal aspects==
{{seealso|Cultural references to stuttering}}
[[Image:LewisCarrollSelfPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lewis Carroll]], the well-known author of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'', was afflicted with a stammer, as were his siblings.]]
For centuries stuttering has featured prominently in both [[popular culture]] and in [[society]] at large. Because of the unusual-sounding speech that is produced, as well as the behaviors and attitudes that accompany a stutter, stuttering has been a subject of scientific interest, curiosity, discrimination, and ridicule. Stuttering was, and essentially still is, a riddle with a long history of interest and speculation into its causes and cures. Stutterers can be traced back centuries to the likes of [[Demosthenes]],{{Fact|date=September 2007}} [[Aesop]],{{Fact|date=September 2007}} and [[Aristotle]]{{Fact|date=September 2007}}&mdash;some{{vague}} interpret a passage of the [[Bible]] to indicate [[Moses]] also to have been a stutterer.<ref name="fn 5">This interpretation is on the Biblical passage ''"Lord, open my breast, and do Thou ease for me my task, Unloose the knot upon my tongue, that they may understand my words."'' Traditional Hebrew ''midrashim'' (commentaries) give stuttering as the reason for Moses' reluctance to speak. He had [[Aaron]] as his public speaker.</ref> Misinformation and superstition have influenced society's perceptions of the causes and remedies of a stutter, as well as the intelligence and perceived disposition of people afflicted with the disorder.

Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter, the man who became the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Claudius]] was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} His infirmity is also thought to have saved him from the fate of many other Roman nobles during the purges of [[Tiberius]] and [[Caligula]].{{Fact|date=September 2007}} [[Isaac Newton]], the English scientist who developed the [[Gravity|law of gravity]], also had a stutter.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} Other famous Englishmen who stammered were King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]]{{Fact|date=September 2007}} and Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who led the UK through World War II. Although George VI went through years of speech therapy for his stammer, Churchill thought that his own very mild stutter added an interesting element to his voice: "Sometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience…"<ref name="fn 10">{{cite web | title=Churchill: A Study in Oratory | work=The Churchill Centre | url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=814 | accessdate=2005-04-05}}</ref>

===Ancient views of stuttering===
[[Image:Notker Balbulus 2.jpg|thumb|left|Notker Balbulus, from a medieval manuscript.]]
For centuries "cures" such as consistently drinking water from a snail shell for the rest of one's life, "hitting a stutterer in the face when the weather is cloudy", strengthening the tongue as a muscle, and various [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]] were used.<ref name="fn 6">{{cite web | author = Kuster, Judith Maginnis | title=Folk Myths About Stuttering | work=Minnesota State University | date = [[April 1]], [[2005]] | url= http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/Infostuttering/folkmyths.html | accessdate=2005-04-03}}</ref>  Similarly, in the past people have subscribed to theories about the causes of stuttering which today are considered odd. Proposed causes of stuttering have included  [[tickling]] an infant too much, eating improperly during [[breastfeeding]], allowing an infant to look in the mirror, cutting a child's hair before the child spoke his or her first words, having too small a tongue, or the "work of the devil."<ref name="fn 6"/> 

[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] physicians attributed stuttering to an imbalance of the [[four bodily humors]]: yellow bile, blood, black bile, and phlegm. Humoral manipulation continued to be a dominant treatment for stuttering until the eighteenth century. Italian [[pathologist]] [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Giovanni Morgagni]] attributed stuttering to deviations in the [[hyoid bone]], a conclusion he came to via [[autopsy]]. Later in the century, surgical intervention, via resection of a triangular wedge from the posterior tongue to prevent spasms of the tongue, was also tried.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Blessed [[Notker of St. Gall]] (ca. 840–912), called Balbulus (“The Stutterer”) and described by his biographer as being "delicate of body but not of mind, stuttering of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine," was invoked against stammering.

===Discrimination and awareness===
[[Image:Porky Pig1.jpg|right|thumb|One of the most famous stuttering fictional characters is the animated cartoon character  "[[Porky Pig]]" from the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' theatrical cartoon series.]]
In addition to personal feelings of shame or anxiety, discrimination is a significant problem for stutterers. The majority of stutterers experience or have experienced [[bullying]], harassment, or ridicule to some degree during their school years from both peers and teachers who do not understand the condition.<ref name="fn 11">{{cite journal |author=Hugh-Jones S, Smith PK |title=Self-reports of short- and long-term effects of bullying on children who stammer |journal=The British journal of educational psychology |volume=69 ( Pt 2) |issue= |pages=141–58 |year=1999 |pmid=10405616 | accessdate = 2007-09-23 | laysummary = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,292176,00.html | laysource = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | laydate =  1999-06-04}}</ref> It can be especially difficult for stutterers to form friendships or romantic relationships,{{Fact|date=September 2007}} both because stutterers may avoid social exposure and because non-stutterers may find the disorder unattractive. The stigma of stuttering carries over into the workplace, often resulting in severe [[employment discrimination]] against stutterers.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} Consequently, stuttering has been legally classified as a disability in many parts of the world, affording stutterers the same protection from wrongful discrimination as for people with other disabilities. The UK [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] both expressly protect stutterers from [[wrongful dismissal]] or discrimination.<ref>Merley, Dennis J.

The [[U.S. Congress]] passed a resolution in May 1988 designating the second week of May as Stuttering Awareness Week, while  [[International Stuttering Awareness Day]] (ISAD), is held internationally on [[October 22]]. In September 2005, ISAD was recognised and supported by over 30 Members of the European Parliament (MEPS) at a reception given by the European League of Stuttering Associations. 

Even though public awareness of stuttering has improved markedly over the years,{{Fact|date=October 2007}} misconceptions are still common, usually reinforced by inaccurate media portrayals of stuttering and through popular misconception.
