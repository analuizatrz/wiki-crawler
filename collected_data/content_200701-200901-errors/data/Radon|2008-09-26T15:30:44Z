'''Radon''' ({{pronEng|ˈreɪdɒn}}) is the [[chemical element]]  that has the symbol '''Rn''' and [[atomic number]] 86. Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, [[radioactive]] [[noble gas]] that is formed from the decay of [[radium]]. It is one of the heaviest substances that are gases under normal conditions and is considered to be a health hazard. The most stable [[isotope]], <sup>222</sup>Rn, has a [[half-life]] of 3.8 days and is used in [[radiotherapy]]. While having been less studied by chemists due to its radioactivity, there are a few known compounds of this generally unreactive element.

Radon is a significant contaminant that affects [[indoor air quality]] worldwide. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings and reportedly causes 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the [[United States]] alone.<ref>{{cite web| title = A Citizen's Guide to Radon| publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency| date = 2007-11-26| url = http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/citguide.html|accessdate = 2008-06-26}}</ref> Radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking, and radon-induced lung cancer is thought to be the 6th leading cause of cancer death overall.

In 1910, Sir [[William Ramsay]] and [[Robert Whytlaw-Gray]] isolated radon, determined its density, and determined that it was the heaviest known [[gas]].<ref name=ramsay/> They wrote that "L'expression l'émanation du radium est fort incommode," (the expression of radium emanation is very awkward) and suggested the new name niton (Nt) (from the Latin "nitens" meaning "shining") in order to emphasize the property of gases that cause the phosphorescence of some substances,<ref name=ramsay>{{cite journal  | title = La densité de l’emanation du radium | author = Ramsay, W.;  Gray, R.

In 1923, the International Committee for Chemical Elements and [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) chose among the names radon (Rn), thoron (Tn), and actinon (An). Later, when isotopes were numbered instead of named, the element took the name of the most stable isotope, ''radon'', while Tn became <sup>220</sup>Rn and An <sup>219</sup>Rn. As late as the 1960s, the element was also referred to simply as ''emanation''.<ref>{{citejournal | doi = 10.1016/0022-1902(65)80255-X | year = 1965 | publisher  = Elsevier Science Ltd. | title = Some physical and chemical properties of element 118 (Eka-Em) and element 86 (Em) | author =  Grosse, A.

The first major studies with radon and health occurred in the context of uranium mining, first in the [[Joachimsthal]] region of [[Bohemia]] and then in the [[Southwestern United States]] during the early [[Cold War]]. Because radon is a product of uranium, underground uranium mines may have high concentrations of radon. Many uranium miners in the [[Four Corners]] region contracted [[lung cancer]] and other pathologies as a result of high levels of exposure to radon in the mid-1950s. The increased number of incidences of lung cancer was particularly pronounced among [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[Mormon]] miners, because those groups normally have low rates of lung cancer. Safety standards requiring expensive ventilation were not widely implemented or policed during this period.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Century of X-rays and Radioactivity in Medicine|author=Mould, Richard Francis|year=1993|isbn=0750302240|publisher=CRC Press}}</ref>

The danger of radon exposure in dwellings was discovered in 1984 when Stanley Watras, an employee at the [[Limerick nuclear power plant]] in [[Pennsylvania]], set off the [[Geiger counter|radiation alarms]] on his way to work for two weeks while authorities searched for the source of the contamination. They found that the source was high levels of radon – about 100,000 [[Becquerel|Bq]]/m³ (2,700 [[Curie|pCi]]/L) – in his house's [[basement]], and it was not related to the nuclear plant. The risks associated with living in his house were estimated to be equivalent to [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] 135 packs of [[cigarette]]s every day. Following this highly publicized event, national radon safety standards were set, and radon detection and ventilation became a standard homeowner concern.<ref name=dioxinradon>{{cite journal | author =  Harrison, Kathryn;  Hoberg, George | title = Setting the Environmental Agenda in Canada and the United States: The Cases of Dioxin and Radon | journal= Canadian Journal of Political Science | year = 1991 | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–27 | url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0008-4239%28199103%2924%3A1%3C3%3ASTEAIC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-U }}</ref>

== Isotopes ==
{{main|Isotopes of radon}}

Radon has no stable [[isotope]]s. There are 34 radioactive isotopes that have been studied which range from an [[atomic mass]] of 195 to 228.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{citeweb|url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/|title=Interactive Chart of Nuclides|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|author=Sonzogni, Alejandro|location=National Nuclear Data Center|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref> The most stable isotope is <sup>222</sup>Rn, which is a [[decay product]] of [[radium-226|<sup>226</sup>Ra]]. It has a [[half-life]] of 3.823 days and decomposes by [[alpha particle]] emission into [[polonium-218|<sup>218</sup>Po]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Among the decay daughters of this decay chain is also the highly unstable isotope <sup>218</sup>Rn. The naturally occurring <sup>226</sup>Ra is a product of the [[decay chain]] of [[uranium-238|<sup>238</sup>U]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/library/randrep/du/mr1018.7.appa.html |title=Principal Decay Scheme of the Uranium Series<!- Bot generated title -> |publisher=Gulflink.osd.mil |date= |accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref>  This decay series (with half-lives) is
:<sup>238</sup>U (4.5 x 10<sup>9</sup> yr) → [[thorium-234|<sup>234</sup>Th]] (24.1 days) → [[isotopes of protactinium|<sup>234</sup>Pa]] (1.18 min) → [[uranium-234|<sup>234</sup>U]] (250,000 yr) → [[thorium-230|<sup>230</sup>Th]] (75,000 yr) → <sup>226</sup>Ra (1,600 yr) → '''<sup>222</sup>Rn''' (3.82 days) → <sup>218</sup>Po (3.1 min) → <sup>218</sup>At (1.5 s) → '''<sup>218</sup>Rn''' (35 ms) → [[lead-214|<sup>214</sup>Pb]] (26.8 min) → [[bismuth-214|<sup>214</sup>Bi]] (19.7 min) → [[polonium-214|<sup>214</sup>Po]] (164 µs) → [[lead-210|<sup>210</sup>Pb]] (22.3 yr) → [[bismuth-210|<sup>210</sup>Bi]] (5.01 days) → [[polonium-210|<sup>210</sup>Po]] (138 days) → [[lead-206|<sup>206</sup>Pb]] (stable)

There are three other isotopes that have a half life of over an hour: <sup>211</sup>Rn, <sup>210</sup>Rn and <sup>224</sup>Rn. The <sup>220</sup>Rn isotope is a natural decay product of the most stable [[thorium]] isotope (<sup>232</sup>Th), named thoron. It has a half-life of 55.6 seconds and also emits alpha radiation. Similarly, <sup>219</sup>Rn is derived from the most stable isotope of [[actinium]] (<sup>227</sup>Ac) — named “actinon” — and is an alpha emitter with a half-life of 3.96 seconds.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

== Characteristics == 
At [[standard temperature and pressure]], radon forms a [[monatomic]] gas with a density of 9.73&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>,<ref>{{cite web| title = Radon| publisher = All Measures| year = 2004| url = http://www.allmeasures.com/Formulae/d1/d2/d3/Results2_2.asp?formula=2&material=Radon+%5BRn%5D| accessdate = 2008-02-12}}</ref> about 8 times the surface density of the Earth's atmosphere, 1.217&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>,<ref>{{cite web| last=Williams | first=David R. | date=2007-04-19 | url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html | title=Earth Fact Sheet | publisher=[[NASA]] | accessdate=2008-06-26 }}</ref> and is one of the heaviest gases at room temperature and the heaviest of the noble gases, excluding [[ununoctium]]. At [[standard temperature and pressure]], radon is a colorless gas, but when it is cooled below its [[freezing point]] of {{convert|202|K}}, it has a brilliant phosphorescence which turns [[yellow]] as the temperature is lowered, and becomes [[Orange (colour)|orange]]-[[red]] as the air liquefies at temperatures below {{convert|93|K}}.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele086.html|title=Radon |publisher=Jefferson Lab }}</ref> Upon condensation, radon also glows because of the intense radiation it produces.

Natural radon concentrations in [[Earth's atmosphere]] are so low that radon-rich water in contact with the atmosphere will continually lose radon by [[volatilization]]. Hence, [[ground water]] has a higher concentration of <sup>222</sup>Rn than [[surface water]], because the radon is continuously produced by radioactive decay of <sup>226</sup>[[Radium|Ra]] present in rocks. Likewise, the saturated zone of a soil frequently has a higher radon content than the unsaturated zone because of diffusional losses to the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-28|title=The Geology of Radon|publisher=United States Geological Survey}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-28|url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/08953/EGU2008-A-08953.pdf?PHPSESSID=|title=Radon-222 as a tracer in groundwater-surface water interactions|publisher=Lancaster University}}</ref>

Radon is a health hazard as exposure can cause [[lung cancer]] – it is, in fact, the second major cause of lung cancer after smoking.<ref name="Catelinois"/>  Radon as a terrestrial source of [[background radiation]] is of particular concern because, although on average it is very rare, this intensely radioactive element can be found in high concentrations in many areas of the world, where it represents a significant health hazard. Radon-222 has been classified by [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] as being [[carcinogenic]] to humans.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/content/PED_1_3x_Known_and_Probable_Carcinogens.asp|title=Known and Probable Carcinogens |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] }}</ref>

Radon commercialization is regulated, but it is available in small quantities, at a price of almost $6,000 per mililitre.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=https://srmors.nist.gov/view_detail.cfm?srm=4972|title= SRM  4972 - Radon-222 Emanation Standard  |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}</ref> Because it is also radioactive and is a relatively unreactive chemical element, radon has few uses and is seldom used in academic research.

==Chemistry==
[[Image:Electron shell 086 Radon.svg|right|thumb|An electron shell diagram for radon. Note the [[octet rule|eight electrons]] in the [[valence shell|outer shell]].]]

Radon is a member of the zero-[[Valence (chemistry)|valence]] elements that are called [[noble gas|noble]] or [[inert]] [[gas]]es. It is inert to most common chemical reactions, such as combustion, because the outer [[valence shell]] contains eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound.<ref>{{cite web | last=Bader | first=Richard F.W. | url=http://miranda.chemistry.mcmaster.ca/esam/ | title=An Introduction to the Electronic Structure of Atoms and Molecules | publisher=[[McMaster University]] | accessdate=2008-06-26 }}</ref> However, due to [[periodicity|periodic trends]], radon has a lower [[electronegativity]] than the element one period before it, [[xenon]], and is therefore more reactive.

Because of its price and radioactivity, experimental chemical research is seldom performed with radon, and as a result there are very few reported compounds of radon, all either [[fluoride]]s or [[oxide]]s. Radon can be [[Oxidation|oxidized]] by a few powerful oxidizing agents such as [[fluorine|{{chem|F|2}}]], thus forming [[radon fluoride]].<ref> {{cite journal | author = Stein, L.  | year = 1970 | journal = Science | volume =168 | pages = 362 | doi = 10.1126/science.168.3929.362 | title = Ionic Radon Solution | pmid = 17809133}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author =  Pitzer, Kenneth S. | year = 1975 | journal =  J.

Radon is found in some petroleum. Because radon has a similar pressure and temperature curve as propane, and oil refineries separate petrochemicals based on their boiling points, the piping carrying freshly separated propane in oil refineries can become partially radioactive due to radon decay particles.  Residues from the [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] industry often contain [[radium]] and its daughters. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be radium rich, while the water, oil, and gas from a well often contains radon. The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. An oil processing plant, the area of the plant where [[propane]] is processed, is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point as propane.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Survey & Identification of NORM Contaminated Equipment| journal = Enprotec / Hibbs & Todd | volume = 7| issue = 1| month = October | year = 2004| url = http://www.enprotec-inc.com/Presentations/NORM.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-02-14}}</ref>

Radon, along with the noble gases [[krypton]] and [[xenon]], is also produced during the operation of [[nuclear power plants]].  A small fraction of it leaks out of the fuel, through the cladding, and into the cooling water, from which it is scavenged.  It is then routed to a holding tank where it remains for a large number of half-lives.  It is finally purged to the open air through a tall stack, which is carefully monitored for radiation level.

Radon collects over samples of radium-226 at a rate of about 0.001 cm3/day per gram of radium. The radon (<sup>222</sup>Rn) released into the air decays to <sup>210</sup>Pb and other radioisotopes, the levels of [[lead|<sup>210</sup>Pb]] can be measured.  The rate of deposition of this radioisotope is dependent on the weather. In the early part of the 20th century in the [[USA]], gold which was contaminated with lead-210 entered the jewelry industry. This was from gold seeds which had held radon-222 that had been melted down after the radon had decayed. The daughters of the radon are still radioactive today.<ref>{{cite web| title = Poster Issued by the New York Department of Health (ca. 1981)| publisher = Oak Ridge Associated Universities| date = 2007-07-25| url = http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/hpposters/goldjewelry.htm| accessdate = 2008-06-26}}</ref>

===Medical===
It has been said that exposure to radon gas mitigates auto-immune diseases such as [[arthritis]].<ref >{{cite web| url = http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2143 | title = Radon Health Mines: Boulder and Basin, Montana |  publisher= Roadside America |  accessdate=2007-12-04 }}</ref> As a result, in the late 20th century and early 21st century, some "health mines" were established in [[Basin, Montana]] which attracted people seeking relief from health problems such as arthritis through limited exposure to radioactive mine water and radon. The practice is controversial because of the "well-documented ill effects of high-dose radiation on the body."<ref>{{cite journal | last = Salak | first = Kara  | coauthors =  Nordeman, Landon | title = 59631: Mining for Miracles  | journal = National Geographic  | publisher = National Geographic Society  | year = 2004  | url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0401/feature7/index.html | accessdate = 2008-06-26  }}</ref>

Radioactive water baths have been applied since 1906 in [[Jáchymov]], [[Czech Republic]], but even before radon discovery they were used in [[Bad Gastein]], [[Austria]]. Radium-rich springs are also used in traditional [[Japan]]ese [[onsen]] in [[Misasa, Tottori|Misasa]], [[Tottori]] prefecture. Drinking therapy is applied in [[Bad Brambach]], [[Germany]]. Inhalation therapy is carried out in Gasteiner-Heilstollen, [[Austria]], in [[Kowary]], [[Poland]] and in [[Boulder, Montana]], [[United States]]. In the United States and Europe there are several "radon [[destination spa|spas]]," where people sit for minutes or hours in a high-radon atmosphere in the belief that low doses of radiation will invigorate or energize them.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=http://www.petros.cz/spa/spa_ja.asp|title=Jáchymov |publisher=Petros }}</ref>

In addition to personal testimonies of arthritis relief and other benefits, there is some scientific evidence for this belief, known as [[radiation hormesis|hormesis]]. However, the general scientific community finds it unsubstantiated. There is no known biological mechanism by which such an effect could occur. In addition, it conflicts with the internationally recognized standard that there is [[Linear no-threshold model|no safe threshold]] for radiation exposure and that exposure should be limited to that [[ALARA|"as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA)]].

The radon gas which is used as a [[cancer]] treatment in medicine is obtained from the decay of a [[radium chloride]] source. In the past, [[radium]] and radon have both been used for [[X-ray]] [[medical radiography]], but they have fallen out of use as they are radiotoxic [[alpha radiation]] emitters which are expensive and have been replaced with [[iridium-192]] and [[cobalt-60]] since they are far better photon sources.

===Scientific===
Radon emanation from the soil varies with soil type and with surface uranium content, so outdoor radon concentrations can be used to track air masses to a limited degree. This fact has been put to use by some atmospheric scientists. Because of radon's rapid loss to air and comparatively rapid decay, radon is used in [[hydrology|hydrologic]] research that studies the interaction between ground water and [[stream]]s. Any significant concentration of radon in a stream is a good indicator that there are local inputs of ground water. Radon is also used in the dating of oil-containing soils because radon has a high affinity of oil-like substances.

Radon soil-concentration has been used in an experimental way to map buried close-subsurface geological faults because concentrations are generally higher over the faults. Similarly, it has found some limited use in geothermal prospecting. Some researchers have also looked at elevated soil-gas radon concentrations, or rapid changes in soil or groundwater radon concentrations, as a predictor for [[earthquake]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Richon, P.; Sabroux, J.-C.; Halbwachs, M.; Vandemeulebrouck, J.; Poussielgue, N.; Tabbagh, J.; Punongbayan, R.|year=2003|title=Radon anomaly in the soil of Taal volcano, the Philippines: A likely precursor of the M 7.1 Mindoro earthquake (1994)|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume= 30|issue= 9|pages=34–41}}</ref> Results have been generally unconvincing but may ultimately prove to have some limited use in specific locations.

Radon is a known pollutant emitted from geothermal power stations, though it disperses rapidly, and no radiological hazard has been demonstrated in various investigations. The trend in geothermal plants is to reinject all emissions by pumping deep underground, and this seems likely to ultimately decrease such radon hazards further.

== Testing and mitigation ==
[[ASTM International|ASTM]] E-2121 is a standard for reducing radon in homes as far as practicable below 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) in indoor air.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.epa.gov/iaq/radon/pubs/mitstds.html| title = Recommended Residential Radon Mitigation Standard of Practice | publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | accessdate = 2008-02-02}}</ref><ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2121.htm| title = ASTM E2121-03 Standard Practice for Installing Radon Mitigation Systems in Existing Low-Rise Residential Buildings | publisher = ASTM International  | accessdate = 2008-02-02}}</ref>  Radon test kits are commercially available. The kit includes a collector that the user hangs in the lowest livable floor of the house for 2 to 7 days. The user then sends the collector to a laboratory for analysis. The National Environmental Health Association provides a list of radon measurement professionals.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.radongas.org/Description_of_Radon_Measurement_Service.html| title = Residential Measurement Provider| accessdate = 2008-02-02| publisher = The National Environmental Health Association -- National Radon Proficiency Program}}</ref> Long term kits, taking collections for up to one year, are also available.  An open-land test kit can test radon emissions from the land before construction begins.  The EPA and the National Environmental Health Association have identified 15 types of radon testing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.radongas.org/device.htm| title = Radon Measurement Method Definitions| accessdate = 2008-02-02| publisher = The National Environmental Health Association -- National Radon Proficiency Program}}</ref> A [[Lucas cell]] is one type of device.

Radon levels fluctuate naturally. An initial test might not be an accurate assessment of your home's average radon level.  Transient weather can affect short term measurements.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.radon.com/radon/radon_mitigation.html| title = You've found radon in your home - what should you do?| accessdate = 2008-02-02| publisher = Air Chek, Inc.}}</ref> Therefore, a high result (over 4 pc/l) justifies repeating the test before undertaking more expensive abatement projects.  Measurements between 4 and 10 pc/l warrant a long term radon test. Measurements over 10 pc/l warrant only another short term test so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed.  Purchasers of real estate are advised to delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to 4 pc/l or less.

The National Environmental Health Association administers a voluntary National Radon Proficiency Program for radon professionals consisting of individuals and companies wanting to take training courses and examinations to demonstrate their competency.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.radongas.org/| title = National Radon Proficiency Program| accessdate = 2008-02-02 | publisher = The National Environmental Health Association -- National Radon Proficiency Program  }} </ref> A list of mitigation service providers is available.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.radongas.org/Description_of_Radon_Mitigation_Services.html| title = Residential Mitigation Provider| accessdate = 2008-02-02 | publisher = The National Environmental Health Association -- National Radon Proficiency Program}}</ref> [[Radon mitigation|Indoor radon can be mitigated]] by sealing basement foundations, water drainage, or by sub-slab de-pressurization. In severe cases, mitigation can use air pipes and fans to exhaust sub-slab air to the outside. Indoor ventilation systems are more effective, but exterior ventilation can be cost-effective in some cases.

Modern construction that conserves energy by making homes air tight exacerbates the risks of radon exposure if radon is present in the home.  Older homes with more porous construction are more likely to vent radon naturally.  Positive-pressure ventilation systems can be combined with a heat exchanger to recover energy in the process of exchanging air with the outside, and it should be noted that simply exhausting basement air to the outside is not necessarily a viable solution as this can actually draw radon gas ''into'' a dwelling.  Homes built on a crawl space can benefit from a radon collector installed under a radon barrier (a sheet of plastic that covers the crawl space).

</div>

Radon is the invisible, radioactive atomic gas that results from radioactive decay of some forms of uranium that may be found in rock formations beneath buildings or in certain building materials themselves. Radon is most likely the most pervasive serious hazard for indoor air in the United States and Europe, and is probably responsible for tens of thousands of lung cancer deaths per year. There are relatively simple tests for radon gas, but these tests are not commonly done, even in areas of known systematic hazards. Radon is a very heavy gas and thus will tend to accumulate at the floor level. Building materials can be a significant source of radon, but very little testing is done for stone, rock, or tile products brought into building sites. The half-life for radon is 3.8 days, indicating that once the source is removed, the hazard will be greatly reduced within a few weeks. However, annually, thousands of people go to radon-contaminated mines for deliberate exposure to help with the symptoms of [[arthritis]] without any serious health effects.<ref name=Catelinois />

Radon presents significant risks, since it is a colorless and odorless [[gas]], and therefore not readily detectable by a human. The radiation decay products [[ion]]ize genetic material, causing mutations that sometimes turn cancerous. Radon exposure is the second major cause of lung cancer after smoking.<ref name="Catelinois">{{cite journal |last =Catelinois | first =O | coauthors = Rogel, A; Laurier, D; et al. | title =Lung Cancer Attributable to Indoor Radon Exposure in France: Impact of the Risk Models and Uncertainty Analysis | journal =Environmental Health Perspectives | volume =114 | issue =9 | pages =1361–1366 | publisher =National Institute of Environmental Health Science | month =May | year =2006 | url =http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=16966089 | doi =10.1289/ehp.9070 | pmid =16966089 | accessdate =2008-06-26 }}</ref> Radon gas levels vary by locality and the composition of the underlying soil and rocks. For example, in areas such as [[Cornwall]] in the [[UK]], which has [[granite]] as substrata, radon gas is a major problem, and buildings have to be force-ventilated with fans to lower radon gas concentrations. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) estimates that one in 15 homes in the United States has radon levels above the recommended guideline of 4 [[picocurie]]s per liter (pCi/L) (148 [[becquerel|Bq]]/[[cubic metre|m³]]).<ref name="EPA radon">{{cite web | last =EPA | authorlink =United States Environmental Protection Agency | title =Radiation Protection: Radon | publisher =EPA | month =November | year =2007 | url =http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/radon.html | accessdate =2008-04-17 }}</ref> [[Iowa]] has the highest average radon concentration in the United States; studies performed there have demonstrated a 50% increased lung cancer risk with prolonged radon exposure above the EPA's action level of 4 pCi/L.<ref name="Field">{{cite journal | last =Field | first =RW | coauthors = Steck, DJ; Smith, BJ; et al. | title =Residential radon gas exposure and lung cancer: the Iowa Radon Lung Cancer Study | journal =American Journal of Epidemiology | volume =151 | issue =11 | pages =1091–1102 | publisher =Oxford Journals | month =June | year =2000 | url =http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/151/11/1091  | pmid =10873134 | accessdate =2008-06-26 }}</ref><ref name="EPA Iowa">{{cite web | last =EPA | authorlink =United States Environmental Protection Agency | title =Iowa Radon Lung Cancer Study | publisher =EPA | month =June | year =2000 | url =http://www.epa.gov/radon/iowastudy.html | accessdate =2008-06-26 }}</ref>

Radon is a terrestrial source of radiation of particular concern because — although on average it is very rare — this intensely radioactive element can be found in high concentrations in many areas of the world, where it represents a significant health hazard. Radon is a decay product of uranium, which is relatively common in the earth's crust, but generally concentrated in ore-bearing rocks scattered around the world. Radon seeps out of these ores into the atmosphere or into ground water, and in these localities it can accumulate within dwellings and expose humans to high concentrations. The widespread construction of well insulated and sealed homes in the northern industrialized world has led to radon becoming the primary source of background radiation in some localities in northern North America and Europe. Some of these areas, including [[Cornwall]] and [[Aberdeenshire]] in the [[United Kingdom]] have high enough natural radiation levels that nuclear licensed sites cannot be built there — the sites would already exceed legal radiation limits before they opened, and the natural topsoil and rock would all have to be disposed of as [[low-level nuclear waste]].<ref name=pubs />

Radiation exposure from radon is indirect. Radon has a short half-life (4 days) and decays into other solid particulate [[Decay chain#Radium series|radium-series]] radioactive nuclides. These radioactive particles are inhaled and remain lodged in the lungs, causing continued exposure. People in affected localities can receive up to 10 mSv per year background radiation.<ref name=pubs>{{cite web| title = Publications | publisher = United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation| date = 2008-02-06| url = http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html| accessdate = 2008-02-15}}</ref> Radon is thus the second leading cause of [[lung cancer]] after [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], and accounts for 15,000 to 22,000 cancer deaths per year in the US alone.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/radon|title=Radon and Cancer: Questions and Answers|publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]}}</ref>  The general population is exposed to small amounts of polonium as a radon daughter in indoor air; the isotopes <small><sup>214</sup></small>Po and <small><sup>218</sup></small>Po are thought to cause the majority<ref>{{cite journal|title=Health Risks of Radon and Other Internally Deposited Alpha-Emitters-BEIR IV|journal=Biometrics|publisher=National Research Council|author=Darby, S.

The general effects of radon to the human body are caused by its radioactivity and consequent risk of radiation-induced cancer. As an inert gas, radon has a low solubility in body fluids, which leads to a uniform distribution of the gas throughout the body. Radon gas and its solid decay products are [[carcinogen]]s.  The greatest health risks come from exposure to the inhaled solid radon gas decay products that are produced during its radioactive decay.  Two of these decay products, [[polonium]]-218 and 214, present a significant radiologic hazard.<ref name = williams>{{cite web| url = http://www.cheec.uiowa.edu/misc/radon_occ.pdf| format = PDF| last = Field| first = R. William| year = 1999| accessdate = 2008-02-02|title = Radon Occurrence and Health Risk}}</ref> Once the radioactive decay products are inhaled into the lung, they undergo further radioactive decay, releasing small bursts of energy in the form of [[alpha particles]] that can either cause [[DNA]] breaks or create [[free radical]]s.<ref name = williams/>

It is not known whether radon can cause health effects in other organs besides the lungs. The effects of radon, if found in food or drinking water, are unknown.

The largest single source of radiation exposure to the general public is naturally-occurring radon gas, which comprises approximately 55% of the annual background dose.  The largest natural contributor to public radiation dose is radon, a naturally occurring, radioactive gas found in soil and rock.<ref>{{cite web| title = Radiation Dose Chart| publisher = American Nuclear Society| year = 2007| url = http://www.ans.org/pi/resources/dosechart/| accessdate = 2008-02-15}}</ref> If the gas is inhaled, some of the radon particles may attach to the inner lining of the lung. These particles continue to decay, emitting alpha particles which can damage cells in the lung tissue.<ref name="EPA radon" /> The death of [[Marie Curie]] at age 66 from leukemia was likely caused by prolonged exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation. Its discoverer, Curie worked extensively with radium, which decays into radon,<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q535.html|title=Answer to Question #535 Submitted to "Ask the Experts"|publisher=Health Physics Society}}</ref> along with other radioactive materials that emit [[beta decay|beta]] and [[gamma ray|gamma]] rays.

The results of a methodical ten-year-long, case-controlled study of residential radon exposure in Worcester County, Massachusetts, found an apparent 60% ''reduction'' in lung cancer risk amongst people exposed to low levels (0–150 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>) of radon gas; levels typically encountered in 90% of American homes — an apparent support for the idea of radiation [[hormesis]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Thompson, R.E.; Nelson, D.F.; Popkin, J.H.; Popkin, Z.|year= 2008|title=Case-control study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure in Worcester County, Massachusetts.|publisher=Health Physics|journal=The Radiation Safety Journal|volume=94|issue=3|pages=228–241|pmid=18301096|url=http://www.health-physics.com/pt/re/healthphys/abstract.00004032-200803000-00002.htm;jsessionid=Lj2TJn73ypCntw86Y2LyCy022qxbQyhsFw1VJ5xqBfMClW8ZBrVr!-1646499982!181195629!8091!-1}}</ref> The study paid close attention to the [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort's]] levels of smoking, occupational exposure to carcinogens and education attainment. However, unlike the majority of the residential radon studies, the study was not population-based. Errors in retrospective exposure assessment could not be ruled out in the finding at low levels.
