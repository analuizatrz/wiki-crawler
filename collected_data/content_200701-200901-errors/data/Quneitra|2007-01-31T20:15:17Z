'''Quneitra''' or '''Al Qunaytirah'''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] القنيطرة) is a city in southwestern [[Syria]], capital of the [[Quneitra Governorate]], which is now largely abandoned. It came under Israeli control as a result of the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. It was briefly placed back under Syrian control during the [[Yom Kippur War]], but Israel recaptured it. Since the "Agreement on Disengagement" signed on 31 May 1974, it lies in the UN-monitored demilitarized zone between [[Syria]] and [[Israel]] ([[UNDOF]]). 

==Religious importance== 

Tradition holds that [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] passed through Qunaytirah on his way from Damascus to [[Jerusalem]].  The city was home to an important [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] church until the Six Day War. Syria claims Israel destroyed and robbed the church [http://www.tzemachdovid.org/Facts/camera6.shtml], while Israel claims that the town, including the church, was destroyed by Syrian artillery during and before the [[Yom Kippur War]] [http://www.tzemachdovid.org/Facts/camera6.shtml].

Al Qunaytirah is also the name of a governorate of southwestern Syria that officially includes the Israeli portion of the [[Golan Heights]]. The legal status of the territories is discussed in [[International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict]].

==Destruction==

''The New York Times'' on [[October 21]] [[1973]] referred to Quneitra as "''a bombed-out military town the Syrians lost to the Israelis ...''"[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/07/world/07CND-POPE.html?ei=5070&en=57316cbb4c7d11fc&ex=1133326800&searchpv=site01&pagewanted=print]

In a "''Report of the Security Council commission''" established under resolution 446, Yassin Rikab, a witness called in by Mr. Najib Al Ahmad, Special Representative of [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), testified about Israel's alleged destruction of the city before withdrawal: "At the beginning of June 1974, the witness had visited the city of Quneitra, where he saw a large number of Israeli bulldozers destroying the town and the surrounding areas." [http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/ded9d4b9fbef11c1802564360057f1f2?OpenDocument]

The General Assembly of the United Nations condemned what it saw as Israel's role in the destruction of the city in Resolution 3240 dated [[29 November]] [[1974]]. [http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/RES/3240(XXIX)&Lang=E&Area=RESOLUTION] 

Israel, on the other hand, claims that the town was destroyed by Syrian artillery before and during the [[Yom Kippur War]].

Since [[2005]], Syria has pledged to reconstruct the city.
