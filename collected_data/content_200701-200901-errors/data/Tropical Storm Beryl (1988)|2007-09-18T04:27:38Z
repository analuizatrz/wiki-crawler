'''Tropical Storm Beryl''' was an unusual [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic]] [[tropical cyclone]] that formed over southeastern [[Louisiana]] in August of [[1988]]. The second tropical storm of the [[1988 Atlantic hurricane season]], Beryl developed from a slow-moving [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure on [[August 8]]. It tracked southeastward into the coastal waters of eastern Louisiana, and Beryl reached peak winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h) while located about 75&nbsp;miles (120&nbsp;km) southeast of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. The storm turned to the northwest over Louisiana and [[Texas]], and slowly dissipated. The remnants of Beryl continued northward into the central [[United States]], dropping some rainfall and providing relief to a severe [[1988 North American heat wave|heat wave]].

Due to its slow motion, Beryl dropped heavy amounts of rainfall, peaking at 16.09&nbsp;inches (408&nbsp;mm) on [[Dauphin Island]] in [[Alabama]]. The rainfall caused some reports of flooding, while prolonged durations of rough waves resulted in severe beach erosion. The waves capsized a boat in [[Mobile Bay]], killing one of its passengers. Overall damage was minor, totaling about $3&nbsp;million (1988&nbsp;USD, $5.12&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Beryl 1988 track.png}}
A weak surface [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure emerged into the northeast [[Gulf of Mexico]] on [[August 1]]. Under weak steering currents, the trough drifted westward, and slowly became better defined with the formation of a circulation in the mid- through upper-levels of the atmosphere. An upper-level low developed over [[Texas]], providing unfavorable amounts of vertical [[wind shear]]. A surface circulation was first evident on satellite imagery on [[August 4]] just off the coast of [[Mississippi]], and for several days it remained nearly stationary over the [[Mississippi Sound]]. As the upper-level low over Texas drifted southwestward, an [[anticyclone]] developed over the system, with the circulation becoming better defined and more vertically aligned. On [[August 7]], the system drifted into southeastern [[Louisiana]]. It continued to become better organized, and on [[August 8]] it developed into Tropical Depression Three while located near the northern coast of [[Lake Pontchartrain]].<ref name="tcr1">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-03-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1988-prelim/beryl/prelim01.gif|year=1988|title=Tropical Storm Beryl Preliminary Report}}</ref> This is unusual in that tropical cyclones rarely form over land.<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web| author=NHC Hurricane Research Division|title=Atlantic hurricane best track|publisher=NOAA| date=[[2006-02-17]]|accessdate=2007-03-28|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/easyhurdat_5105.html}}</ref>

Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression drifted southeastward, and within hours of its formation it emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. Based on ship reports and [[tropical cyclone observation|observations]] from [[oil rig]]s, it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl at 1000&nbsp;UTC on [[August 8]] while located just offshore coastal Louisiana.<ref name="tcr1"/> Conditions remained favorable for further intensification, with the circulation located over warm waters and maintaining well-defined [[tropical cyclone#structure|outflow]]; early on [[August 9]] Beryl attained its peak intensity of 50&nbsp;mph while located about 75&nbsp;miles (120&nbsp;km) southeast of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. Shortly thereafter, a trough from the northwest dissipated the anticyclone and resulted in a steady northwest motion very near where the cyclone originally moved offshore. Beryl maintained tropical storm status for about 18 hours before weakening to a tropical depression over central Louisiana. It turned to the northwest, and the surface circulation dissipated on [[August 10]] while located a short distance south of [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].<ref name="tcr2">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-03-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1988-prelim/beryl/prelim02.gif|year=1988|title=Tropical Storm Beryl Preliminary Report (Page 2)}}</ref> The surface low pressure area crossed into north [[Texas]] before dissipating early on [[August 12]], while its upper-level circulation turned northward into [[Oklahoma]] before being merged by an approaching trough.<ref name="rain">{{cite web|author=David Roth|year=2006|title=Rainfall Summary for Tropical Storm Beryl|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2007-03-27|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/beryl1988.html}}</ref>

==Preparations==
Upon becoming a tropical storm, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] from the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Pensacola, Florida]]. 6&nbsp;hours later, the warning was extended westward to [[Morgan City, Louisiana]].<ref name="tcr12">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-03-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1988-prelim/beryl/prelim12.gif|year=1988|title=Tropical Storm Beryl Preliminary Report (Page 12)}}</ref> The threat of Beryl prompted some voluntary evacuations in [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard Parish]] in [[Louisiana]],<ref name="tcr3"/> and also forced the evacuations of thousands from offshore oil rigs.<ref name="spt89">{{cite news|author=Saint Petersburg Times|date=1988-08-09|title=Beryl hovering off Louisiana|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> Officials advised small craft to remain at port from [[Port O'Connor, Texas]] to [[Pensacola, Florida]].<ref name="upi88">{{cite news|author=Jeff Woods|date=1988-08-08|title=Domestic News|publisher=United Press International|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

Rainfall from the storm reached over 7&nbsp;inches (175&nbsp;mm) a short distance east of [[Pensacola, Florida]], though impact in the state was minor.<ref name="rain"/> Wind gusts peaked at 38&nbsp;mph (61&nbsp;km/h) in Pensacola.<ref name="mwr">{{cite web|author=Miles Lawrence and James Gross|year=1989|title=Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1988|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-03-27|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0493/117/10/pdf/i1520-0493-117-10-2248.pdf}}</ref> In [[Alabama]], Beryl produced sustained winds of 38&nbsp;mph (61&nbsp;km/h), with gusts to 54&nbsp;mph (86&nbsp;km/h), as well as above normal tides.<ref name="mwr"/> The storm dropped heavy rainfall in coastal portions of Alabama, peaking at 16.09&nbsp;inches (408&nbsp;mm) on [[Dauphin Island]].<ref name="rain"/> Rough waves overturned a shrimp boat in [[Mobile Bay]]. A 15-year-old boy on the boat drowned, the only direct fatality from the storm. The boy's father, also on the boat, spent 24&nbsp;hours in the water before being rescued by the [[United States Coast Guard]]. The waves caused severe beach erosion along the coastline, with Dauphin Island losing 60 to 70&nbsp;feet (18 to 21&nbsp;m) of beach.<ref name="tcr3">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-03-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1988-prelim/beryl/prelim03.gif|year=1988|title=Tropical Storm Beryl Preliminary Report (Page 3)}}</ref> 

In [[Mississippi]], coastal areas reported heavy amounts of precipitation, reaching over 10&nbsp;inches (250&nbsp;mm) in [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson County]]. Sustained winds reached 47&nbsp;mph (76&nbsp;km/h) at [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], the strongest wind on a land station.<ref name="mwr"/> Similar to Alabama, strong waves caused considerable beach erosion along portions of the coastline.<ref name="tcr3"/>

Beryl dropped rainfall across much of [[Louisiana]], peaking at over 10&nbsp;inches (250&nbsp;mm) near [[Morgan City, Louisiana|Morgan City]].<ref name="rain"/> The rainfall caused significant river flooding along the [[Biloxi River]].<ref name="usgs88">{{cite web|author=United States Geological Survey|url=http://ks.water.usgs.gov/Kansas/pubs/reports/wsp.2502.sum88.html#HDR1|title=Summary of Significant Floods, 1988|accessdate=2007-03-27|year=2005}}</ref> Wind gusts were fairly light across the state, reaching 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].<ref name="mwr"/> The winds caused light tree damage, which resulted in some power outages. A storm tide of about 5&nbsp;feet (1.5&nbsp;m) caused some coastal flooding.<ref name="tcr3"/>

The remnants of Beryl produced locally heavy precipitation peaking at about 12&nbsp;inches (300&nbsp;mm) in east-central [[Texas]],<ref name="mwr"/> resulting in some reports of [[flash flood]]ing.<ref name="tcr3"/> The rainfall flooded some roads and also causes severe river flooding on the [[Angelina River]].<ref name="upi811">{{cite news|author=United Press International|date=1988-08-11|title=Beryl remnants soak East Texas|accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref> Remnant moisture dropped about 5&nbsp;inches (125&nbsp;mm) of rain in southeast [[Oklahoma]] and 3&nbsp;inches (75&nbsp;mm) in southwestern [[Arkansas]].<ref name="rain"/> Further inland, the remnants of Beryl cooled temperatures and provided relief to the severe [[1988 North American heat wave|heat wave]] in the central [[United States]].<ref name="ap813">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|date=1988-08-13|title=Temperatures Reach Record Levels|accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref>

Throughout its path, Beryl caused about $3&nbsp;million in damage (1988&nbsp;USD, $5.12&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD), primarily along the immediate coastline from erosion or flood damage.<ref name="tcr3"/> Due to the minor damage, the name ''Beryl'' was not [[List of retired Atlantic hurricanes|retired]]; it was re-used in [[Tropical Storm Beryl (1994)|1994]], [[Tropical Storm Beryl (2000)|2000]], and [[Tropical Storm Beryl (2006)|2006]].
