'''Zionism''' is an international [[Jewish political movements|political movement]] that originally supported the reestablishment of a [[homeland for the Jewish People]] in [[Palestine]] ([[Hebrew]]: Eretz Yisra'el, “the [[Land of Israel]]”), and continues primarily as support for the modern [[state]] of [[Israel]].<ref name=Definition>"An international movement originally for the establishment of a Jewish national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of modern Israel." ("Zionism," Webster's 11th Collegiate Dictionary). See also [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9078399/Zionism "Zionism"], ''Encyclopedia Britannica'', which describes it as a "Jewish nationalist movement that has had as its goal the creation and support of a Jewish national state in Palestine, the ancient homeland of the Jews (Hebrew: Eretz Yisra'el, “the Land of Israel”)," and ''The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language,'' Fourth Edition, which defines it as "A Jewish movement that arose in the late 19th century in response to growing anti-Semitism and sought to reestablish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Modern Zionism is concerned with the support and development of the state of Israel." </ref>

Although its origins are earlier, the movement was formally established by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] journalist [[Theodor Herzl]] in the late [[19th century]]. The movement was eventually successful in establishing Israel in 1948, as the world's first and only modern [[Jewish State]].

While Zionism is based in part upon [[Judaism|religious tradition]] linking the Jewish people to the [[Land of Israel]], where the concept of Jewish [[nationhood]] is thought to have first evolved somewhere between 1200 BCE and the late [[Second Temple]] era (i.e. up to 70 CE),<ref>"...from Zion, where King David fashioned the first Jewish nation" (Friedland, Roger and Hecht, Richard ''To Rule Jerusalem'', p. 27).</ref><ref>"By the late Second Temple times, when widely held Messianic beliefs were so politically powerful in their implications and repercussions, and when the significance of political authority, territorial sovereignty, and religious belief for the fate of the Jews as a people was so widely and vehemently contested, it seems clear that Jewish nationhood was a social and cultural reality".

==Terminology==

The word "Zionism" itself is derived from the word "Zion" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ציון, ''Tzi-yon''), one of the names of [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Land of Israel]], as mentioned in the [[Bible]]: 
<blockquote>
and the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.(Isaiah 35:10)
</blockquote>
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:1892 Self Emancipation by Birnbaum.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1892 issue of ''Self Emancipation'' by N. Birnbaum describing the principles of Zionism]] -->
It was coined as a term for Jewish [[nationalism]] by [[Austria]]n [[Jew]]ish publisher [[Nathan Birnbaum]], founder of the first nationalist Jewish students' movement ''Kadimah'', in his journal ''Selbstemanzipation'' (''Self Emancipation'') in 1890. (Birnbaum eventually turned against political Zionism and became the first secretary-general of the anti-Zionist [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] movement [[Agudat Israel]].)<ref>De Lange, Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Judaism'', Cambridge University Press (2000), p. 30.  ISBN 0-521-46624-5.</ref>

Certain individuals and groups have used the term "Zionism" as a pejorative to justify attacks on Jews. According to historians [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Howard Sachar]] and [[Jack Fischel]] among others, the label "Zionist" is in some cases also used  as a [[euphemism]] for Jews in general by apologists for [[antisemitism]].<ref>Misuse of the term "Zionism":
*"... behind the cover of "anti-Zionism" lurks a variety of motives that ought to be called by their true name. When, in the 1950s under Stalin, the Jews of the Soviet Union came under severe attack and scores were executed, it was under the banner of anti-Zionism rather than anti-Semitism, which had been given a bad name by Adolf Hitler. When in later years the policy of Israeli governments was attacked as racist or colonialist in various parts of the world, the basis of the criticism was quite often the belief that Israel had no right to exist in the first place, not opposition to specific policies of the Israeli government. Traditional anti-Semitism has gone out of fashion in the West except on the extreme right. But something we might call post-anti-Semitism has taken its place. It is less violent in its aims, but still very real. By and large it has not been too difficult to differentiate between genuine and bogus anti-Zionism. The test is twofold. It is almost always clear whether the attacks are directed against a specific policy carried out by an Israeli government (for instance, as an occupying power) or against the existence of Israel. Secondly, there is the test of selectivity. If from all the evils besetting the world, the misdeeds, real or imaginary, of Zionism are singled out and given constant and relentless publicity, it can be taken for granted that the true motive is not anti-Zionism but something different and more sweeping." ([[Walter Laqueur|Laqueur, Walter]]: ''Dying for Jerusalem: The Past, Present and Future of the Holiest City'' (Sourcebooks, Inc., 2006) ISBN 1-4022-0632-1. p. 55)
*"In late July 1967, Moscow launched an unprecedented propaganda campaign against Zionism as a "world threat." Defeat was attributed not to tiny Israel alone, but to an "all-powerful international force." ... In its flagrant vulgarity, the new propaganda assault soon achieved Nazi-era characteristics. The Soviet public was saturated with racist canards. Extracts from Trofim Kichko's notorious 1963 volume, ''Judaism Without Embellishment'', were extensively republished in the Soviet media. Yuri Ivanov's ''Beware: Zionism'', a book essentially replicated ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', was given nationwide coverage." ([[Howard Sachar]]: ''A History of the Jews in the Modern World'' (Knopf, NY. 2005) p.722

Zionism can be distinguished from [[Territorialism]], a Jewish nationalist movement calling for a Jewish homeland not necessarily in [[Palestine]]. During the early history of Zionism, a number of proposals were made for settling Jews outside of Europe, but ultimately all of these were rejected or failed. The debate over these proposals helped to define the nature and focus of the Zionist movement.

==History==
{{main |History of Zionism}}

Since the first century CE most Jews have lived in exile, although there has been a constant presence of Jews in the [[Land of Israel]] (Eretz Israel). According to Judaism, Eretz Israel, or [[Zion]], is a land promised to the Jews by God according to the [[Bible]]. Following the 2nd century [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], Jews were expelled from [[Palestine]] to form the [[Jewish diaspora]]. In the nineteenth century a current in Judaism supporting a return grew in popularity. Even before 1897, which is generally seen as the year in which practical Zionism started, Jews immigrated to Palestine, the [[Aliyah#Pre-Zionist aliyah (1200-1882)|pre-Zionist Aliyah]].<ref>C.D. Smith, 2001, 'Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict', 4th ed., ISBN 0-312-20828-6, p. 1-12, 33-38</ref>

Jewish immigration to Palestine started in earnest in 1882. The so-called [[First Aliyah]]  saw  the arrival of about 30,000 Jews over twenty years. Most [[Jewish refugees|immigrants]] came from Russia, where anti-semitism was rampant. They founded a number of agricultural settlements with financial support from Jewish philanthropists in Western Europe. The [[Second Aliyah]] started in 1904. Further [[Aliyah]]s followed between the two World Wars, fueled in the 1930s by [[Nazi]] persecution. 

In the 1890s [[Theodor Herzl]] infused Zionism with a new and practical urgency. He brought the [[World Zionist Organization]] into being and, together with [[Nathan Birnbaum]], planned its First Congress at [[Basel]] in 1897.<ref>[http://fusion.dalmatech.com/%7Eadmin24/files/zionism_in-britishpalestine.pdf Zionism & The British In Palestine], by [[Arjun Sethi|Sethi,Arjun]] (University of Maryland) January 2007, accessed May 20, 2007.</ref> This current in Zionism is known as political Zionism because it aimed at reaching a political agreement with the Power ruling Palestine. Up to 1917 this was the Ottoman Empire, and then until 1948 it was Britain on behalf of the League of Nations. The WZO also supported small scale settlement in Palestine. 

Lobbying by [[Chaim Weizmann]] (cultural Zionists) and others culminated in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]] by the British government. This declaration endorsed the creation of a Jewish Homeland in Palestine. In 1922, the [[League of nations]] endorsed the declaration in the  [[British mandate of Palestine|Mandate it gave to Britain]]: <blockquote>The Mandatory (…) will secure the establishment of the Jewish national home, as laid down in the preamble, and the development of self-governing institutions, and also for safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective of race and religion.<ref>League of Nations Palestine Mandate, July 24, 1922, sateofisrael.com/mandate</ref></blockquote> 

Palestinian Arabs resisted Zionist migration. There were riots in 1920, 1921 and 1929, sometimes accompanied by massacres of Jews. Britain supported Jewish immigration in principle, but in reaction to Arab violence imposed restrictions on Jewish immigration. 

The[[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]] led the British to establish the [[Peel Commission]] to investigate the situation. The commission called for a two-state solution and compulsory transfer of populations.  This solution was rejected by the British and instead the [[White Paper of 1939]] proposed an end to Jewish immigration by 1944, with a  further 75,000 to be admitted by then. In principle, the British stuck to this policy until the end of the Mandate.

After WWII and the Holocaust, support for Zionism among Jews and Gentiles increased. The British, were attacked in Palestine by Zionist groups because of restrictions on Jewish immigration, the best known attack being the 1946 [[King David Hotel bombing]]. Unable to resolve the conflict, the  British referred the issue to the newly created [[United Nations]].

In 1947, the [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine|UNSCOP]] recommended the partition of western Palestine into a Jewish state, an Arab state and a UN-controlled territory (''[[Corpus separatum]]'') around [[Jerusalem]].<ref>UNITED NATIONS SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON PALESTINE; REPORT TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, A/364, 3 September 1947</ref> This partition plan was adopted on November 29th, 1947 with [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181|UN GA Resolution 181]], 33 votes in favor, 13 against, and 10 abstentions. The vote itself, which required a two-third majority, was a very dramatic affair and led to celebrations in the streets of Jewish cities.<ref>[http://youtube.com/watch?v=rEGUPlhtMWQ Three minutes, 2000 years], Video from the Jewish Agency for Israel, via [[YouTube]]</ref>

The Arab states rejected the UN decision, demanding a single state with an Arab majority. [[1947-1948 Civil War in mandatory Palestine|violence immediately exploded in Palestine]] between Jews and Arabs. On 14 May 1948, at the end of the [[British Mandate of Palestine|British mandate]], the Jewish Agency, led by [[Ben-Gurion]] declared the creation of the State of Israel and the same day, the armies of four<ref> Traditional historiography considered 7 countries attacked Israel : Egypt, Transjordan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Historians have since pointed out that Yemen and Saudi Arabia only sent small contingents of soldiers and Lebanon forces didn't enter the country.</ref> [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|Arab countries invaded Palestine]].

During  the following eight months, [[Israel Defense Forces|Israel forces]] defended the Jewish partition and conquered portions of the Arab partition, enlarging its portion to 78 percent of mandatory Palestine. The conflict led to an exodus of about 711,000 Arab Palestinians <ref>GENERAL PROGRESS REPORT AND SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONCILIATION COMMISSION FOR PALESTINE, Covering the period from 11 December 1949 to 23 October 1950, GA A/1367/Rev.1 23 October 1950</ref>, of whom about 46.000 were [[Internally Displaced Palestinians| internally displaced persons]] in Israel. The war ended with the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], which included new cease-fire lines, the so-called [[Green Line (Israel)|Green line]].

After the war the Arabs continued to reject Israel's right to exist and demanded that it retreat to the 1947 partition lines. They sustained this demand until 1967 when the rest of western Palestine was conquered by Israel during the [[Six-Day War]], after which Arab states demanded that Israel retreat to the 1949 green line, the only "borders" currently recognized by the international community. These borders are commonly referred as the "pre-1967 borders". The border with Egypt was legalized in the 1979 [[Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty]], and the border with Jordan in the 1994 [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace]]. 

After the creation of the State of Israel the WZO continued to exist as an organisation dedicated to assisting and encouraging Jews to migrate to Israel, as well as providing political support for Israel.

==Types of Zionism==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=May 2007}}
Over the years a variety of schools of thought have evolved with different schools dominating at different times.  In addition Zionists come from a wide variety of backgrounds and at times different national groups, such as Russian Jews, German, Polish, British or American Jews have exercised strong influence.

===Labor Zionism===
{{main|Labor Zionism}}
{{see also|Kibbutz Movement|Kibbutz}}

Around 1900 the chief rival to Zionism among young Jews in Eastern Europe was the [[socialist movement]]. Many Jews were abandoning Judaism in favour of [[Communism]] or supported the [[Bund]], a Jewish socialist movement which called for [[Jewish Autonomism|Jewish autonomy]] in Eastern Europe and promoted [[Yiddish]] as the Jewish language.

Many socialist Zionists originated in Russia. They believed that centuries of being oppressed in anti-Semitic societies had reduced Jews to a meek, vulnerable, despairing existence which invited further anti-Semitism. They argued that Jews could escape their situation by becoming farmers, workers, and soldiers in a country of their own. Most socialist Zionists rejected religion as perpetuating a "[[Diaspora]] mentality" among the Jewish people and established rural communes in Israel called "[[Kibbutzim]]". Major theoreticians of Socialist Zionism included [[Moses Hess]], [[Nahum Syrkin]], [[Ber Borochov]] and [[Aaron David Gordon]], and leading figures in the movement included [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Berl Katznelson]]. Most Socialist Zionists rejected [[Yiddish]] as a language of exile, embracing Hebrew as the common Jewish tongue.  Socialist and Labor Zionism was ardently secularist with many Labor Zionists being committed atheists or opposed to religion. Consequently, the movement often had an antagonistic relationship with [[Orthodox Judaism]].

Labor Zionism became the dominant force in the political and economic life of the [[Yishuv]] during the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] - partly as a consequence of its role in organizing Jewish economic life through the [[Histadrut]] -  and was the dominant ideology of the political establishment in Israel until the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 election]] when the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]] was defeated.

===Liberal Zionism===
{{mainarticle|General Zionists}}
General Zionism (or Liberal Zionism) was initially the dominant trend within the Zionist movement from the [[First Zionist Congress]] in 1897 until after the First World War. Many of the General Zionists were German or Russian Liberals but following the Bolshevik and Nazi revolutions, Labour Zionists came to dominate the movement. General Zionists identified with the liberal European Jewish middle class (or [[bourgeois]]) from which many Zionist leaders such as Herzl and [[Chaim Weizmann]] came and believed that a Jewish state could be accomplished through lobbying the Great Powers of Europe and influential circles in European society. General Zionism declined in the face of growing extremism and antisemitism in Central Europe, and because of the superiour ability of Labour Zionism to generate migration to Palestine.

===Revisionist Zionism===
{{main|Revisionist Zionism}}
The Revisionist Zionists were a group led by [[Jabotinsky]] who advocated pressing Britain to allow mass Jewish emigration and the formation of a Jewish Army in Palestine.  The army would force the Arab population to accept mass Jewish migration and promote British interests in the region. 

Revisionist Zionism was detested by the Socialist Zionist movement which saw them as being influenced by [[Fascism]] and the movement caused a great deal of concern among Arab Palestinians. After the [[1929 Palestine riots|1929 Arab riots]], the British banned Jabotinsky from entering Palestine. 

Revisionism was popular in Poland but lacked large support in Palestine. In 1935 the Revisionists left the [[Zionist Organization]] and formed an alternative, the [[New Zionist Organization]]. They rejoined the ZO in 1946.

===Religious Zionism===
{{main|Religious Zionism}}
In the 1920s and 1930s, a small but vocal group of religious Jews began to develop the concept of [[Religious Zionism]] under such leaders as Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] (the first [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi of Palestine]]) and his son Rabbi Zevi Judah Kook.  They saw great religious and traditional value in many of Zionism's ideals, while rejecting its anti-religious undertones. They were also motivated by a concern that growing secularization of Zionism and antagonism towards it from Orthodox Jews would lead to a schism in the Jewish people.  As such, they sought to forge a branch of Orthodox Judaism which would properly embrace Zionism's positive ideals while also serving as a bridge between Orthodox and secular Jews.
After the [[Six Day War]] the movement came to play a significant role in Israeli Political life.

== Particularities of Zionism ==
===The negation of the Diaspora===
{{main|The "Negation of the Diaspora" in Zionism}}
According to Eliezer Schweid the rejection of life in the Diaspora is a central assumption in all currents of Zionism.<ref>E. Schweid, ‘Rejection of the Diaspora in Zionist Thought’, in ‘’Essential Papers onZionsm, ed. By Reinharz & Shapira, 1996, ISBN 0-8147-7449-0, p.133</ref> Underlying this attitude was the feeling that the Diaspora restricted the full growth of Jewish national life. 

===Adoption of Hebrew===
{{main|Revival of the Hebrew language}}
Zionists preferred to speak [[Hebrew]], an organic [[semitic language]] that developed under conditions of freedom in ancient [[Judah]], modernizing and adapting it for everyday use. Zionists sometimes refused to speak [[Yiddish]], a language they considered affected by [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian persecution]].  Once they moved to Israel, many Zionists refused to speak their (diasporic) mother tongues and gave themselves new, Hebrew names.

===Reaction to antisemitism===
In this matter Sternhell distinguishes two schools of thought in Zionism. One was the liberal or utilitarian school of Herzl and Nordau. Especially after the [[Dreyfus Affair]] they held that antisemitism would never disappear, and saw Zionism as a rational solution for Jewish individuals. The other was the organic nationalist school. It was prevalent among the Zionists in Palestine, and saw Zionism as a project to rescue the Jewish nation and not as a project to rescue Jewish individuals. Zionism was a matter of the "Rebirth of the Nation".<ref>Z. Sternhell, 'The founding myths of Israel', 1998, p. 3-36, ISBN 0-691-01694-1, p. 49-51</ref>

==Opposition, critics and evolution of Zionism==<!-- This section is linked from [[Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs]] -->
{{main|Anti-Zionism|Non-Zionism|Post-Zionism|Neo-Zionism}}
There have been a number of critics of Zionism, including Jewish anti-Zionists, pro-Palestinian activists, academics, and politicians. The [[Arab League]] and [[Arab Higher Committee]] rejected the [[UN Partition Plan]] (United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181) approving the creation of a Jewish and Arab state in [[Palestine]],<ref>[[Ahron Bregman|Bregman, Ahron]] (2002), A History of Israel, Palgrave Macmillan, ISBN 0333676319, pp. 40-41.</ref> and some of the most vocal critics of Zionism have been [[Arabs]], many of whom view Israel as occupying what they view as Arab land.<ref>El-Nawawy, Mohammed (2002). ''The Israeli-Egyptian Peace Process in the reporting of western Journalists''. Ablex/Greenwood, pg. 19 ISBN 1567505449 "It is a barrier that has been created by years and years of antagonism with Israelis; a barrier that was strengthened by the Egyptian and Arab news media at large which have enforced the Arabs' stereotypes about the Israelis as invaders of Arab land."</ref><ref>Khalidi, Rashid (2006). ''The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood''. Beacon Press, pg. 19. </ref> Such critics generally opposed Israel's creation in 1948, and continue to criticize the Zionist movement which underlies it. These critics view the changes in demographic balance which accompanied the creation of Israel, including the displacement of some 700,000 Arab [[palestinian refugee|refugees]],<ref>The U.N.'s final estimate of the total number of Palestinian Refugees was 711,000 according to the ''[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/93037e3b939746de8525610200567883!OpenDocument General Progress Report and Supplementary Report of the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine, Covering the Period from [[11 December]] [[1949]] to [[23 October]] [[1950]]]'', published by the [[United Nations Conciliation Commission]], [[October 23]], [[1950]].

General Assembly Official Records, 5th Session, Supplement No. 18, Document A/1367/Rev.1)</ref> and the accompanying violence, as negative but inevitable consequences of Zionism and the concept of a [[Jewish State]].  

While most Jewish groups are pro-Zionist, some ''[[Haredi Judaism|haredi]]'' Jewish communities (most vocally the [[Satmar]] Hasidim and the small [[Neturei Karta]] group), oppose Zionism on religious grounds.<ref> [http://www.zionismontheweb.org/antizionism/Against_Zionists_not_Jews.htm Again Zionists Not Jews], Anti-Zionist Resource Center, Zionism On The Web.</ref> The primary ''haredi'' anti-Zionist work is ''[[Vayoel Moshe]]'' by Satmar [[Rebbe]] [[Joel Teitelbaum]]. This lengthy dissertation asserts that Zionism is forbidden in Judaism, based on an ''[[Aggadah|aggadic]]'' passage in the [[Talmud]],  tractate ''[[Ketubot (Talmud)|Ketubot]]'' 111a. There are also individuals of Jewish origin, such as [[Noam Chomsky]], who have taken strong public stands criticizing various aspects of Israeli policy, but who resist the claim that they oppose Zionism itself.<ref>''Pirates and Emperors: International Terrorism in the Real World''', Noam Chomsky, Black Rose Books, 1991. "My own views, for example, are regularly condemned as 'militant anti-Zionism' by people who are well aware of those views, clearly and repeatedly expressed: that Israel within its internationally recognised borders should be accorded the rights of any state in the international system, no more, no less, and that discriminatory institutional structures that in law and practice assign a special status to one category of citizens (Jews, Whites, Christians, etc.), granting them rights denied others, should be dismantled. I will not enter here into the question of what should properly be called 'Zionism' -- but merely note what follows from designation of these views as "militant anti-Zionism:" Zionism is the doctrine that Israel must be accorded rights beyond those of any other state; it must maintain control of occupied territories, thus barring any meaningful form of self-determination for Palestinians; and it must remain a state based on the principle of discrimination against non-Jewish citizens." (Page 33) </ref>

Other non-Zionist Israeli movements, such as the [[canaanites (movement)|Canaanite]] movement led by poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] in the 1930s and 1940s, have argued that "Israeli" should be a new pan-ethnic [[nationality]].  A related modern movement is known as [[post-Zionism]], which asserts that Israel should abandon the concept of a "state of the Jewish people" and instead strive to be a state of all its citizens.<ref>[http://www.meforum.org/article/469 Can Israel Survive Post-Zionism?] by Meyrav Wurmser. Middle East Quarterly, March 1999</ref> Another opinion favors a [[binational solution|binational state]] in which Arabs and Jews live together while enjoying some type of autonomy.

Some critics of Zionism have [[Zionism and racism allegations|accused it of racism]], an accusation endorsed by the 1975 [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]], which was revoked in 1991.<ref>van Boven, Theodor. ''United Nations strategies to combat racism and racial discrimination:
past experiences and present perspectives.'' UN Economic and Social Council, 26 February 1999. ([http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/f5361232f18f18a3802567a600353646?Opendocument E/CN.4/1999/WG.1/BP.7].)</ref> Zionists reject the charges that Zionism is racist, insisting it is no different than any other national liberation movement of oppressed peoples, and argue that since criticism of both the state of Israel and Zionism is often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, much of it can be attributed to [[antisemitism]].<ref name=Taguieff>Taguieff, Pierre-André.

During the last quarter of 20th century, the decline of classic nationalism in Israel lead to the rise of two antagonistic movement : [[neo-Zionism]] and [[post-Zionism]]. Both mark the Israeli version of a worldwide phenomenon: the ascendancy of globalization and with it the emergence of a market society and liberal culture, on one hand, and a local backlash on the other.<ref>[[Uri Ram]], ''The Future of the Past in Israel - A Sociology of Knowledge Approach'', in [[Benny Morris]], ''Making Israel'', p.224.</ref> The traits of both neo-Zionism and post-Zionism are not entirely foreign to "classical" Zionism but they differ by accentuing antagonist and diametrally opposed poles already present in Zionism. "Neo Zionism accentuates the messianic and particularistic dimensions of Zionist nationalism, while post-Zionism accentuates its normalising and universalistic dimensions".<ref name = "Chan58">[[Steve Chan]], [[Anita Shapira]], [[Derek Jonathan]], ''Israeli Historical Revisionism: from left to right'', Routledge, 2002, p.58.</ref>

==Non-Jewish Zionism==
===Marcus Garvey and Black Zionism===
Zionist success in winning British support for formation of a Jewish National Home in Palestine helped inspire the African-American Nationalist [[Marcus Garvey]] to form a movement dedicated to returning Americans of African origin to Africa. During a speech in [[Harlem]] in 1920 Garvey stated that
<blockquote>
other races were engaged in seeing their cause through&mdash;the Jews through their Zionist movement and the Irish through their Irish movement&mdash;and I decided that, cost what it might, I would make this a favorable time to see the Negro's interest through.<ref>[[Negro World]] 6 March 1920, cited in http://www.international.ucla.edu/africa/mgpp/lifeintr.asp (accessed 29/11/2007).</ref></blockquote>
Garvey established a shipping company, the [[Black Star Line]], to ship Black Americans to Africa, but for various reasons failed in his endeavour. His ideas helped inspire the [[Rastafarian]] movement in Jamaica, the [[Black Jews]]<ref>[http://www.blackjews.org/RabbiBios/RabbiFord.html BlackJews.org - A Project of the International Board of Rabbis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and [[The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem]] who initially moved to Liberia before settling in Israel.

[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] was an ardent supporter of Zionism, and the [[NAACP]] endorsed the creation of Israel in 1948. [[Paul Robeson]], [[Bayard Rustin]], and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] also supported zionism.<ref>[http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_evangelicals.html Why Don’t Jews Like the Christians Who Like Them] by James Q. Wilson, City Journal Winter 2008</ref>

===Christian Zionism===
{{main|Christian Zionism}}

In addition to Jewish Zionism, there was always a small number of [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionists]] that existed from the early days of the Zionist movement.

Throughout the entire 19th century and early 20th century, the return of the Jews to the Holy Land was widely supported by such eminent figures as [[Queen Victoria]], [[King Edward VII]], [[John Adams]], the second President of the [[United States]], [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]] of [[South Africa]], [[Tomáš Masaryk|President Masaryk]] of [[Czechoslovakia]],  [[Benedetto Croce]], [[Italy|Italian]] philosopher and historian, [[Henry Dunant]], founder of the [[Red Cross]] and author of the [[Geneva Conventions]], [[Fridtjof Nansen]], [[Norway|Norwegian]] scientist and humanitarian. 

The [[France|French]] government through Minister M. Cambon formally committed itself to “the renaissance of the Jewish nationality in that Land from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries ago". 

In [[China]], Wang, Minister of Foreign Affairs, declared that "the Nationalist government is in full sympathy with the Jewish people in their desire to establish a country for themselves."<ref> Palestine: The Original Sin , Meir Abelson [http://www.acpr.org.il/ENGLISH-NATIV/issue1/Abelson-1.htm] </ref>

Evangelical Christians have a long history of supporting Zionism.  Famous evangelical supporters of Israel include British Prime Ministers [[Lloyd George]] and [[Arthur Balfour]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Orde Wingate]] whose activities in support of Zionism, led the British Army to ban him from ever serving in Palestine. According to Charles Merkley of Carleton University, Christian Zionism strengthened significantly after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], and many [[Dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] Christians, especially in the United States, now strongly support Zionism.

===Muslims & Christian Arabs supporting Zionism===
Sheikh [[Abdul Hadi Palazzi]], the leader of Italian Muslim Assembly and a co-founder of the [[Islam-Israel Fellowship]] and Canadian [[Imam]] [[Khaleel Mohammed]], find support for Zionism in the [[Qur'an]].<ref>Glazov, Jamie. [http://www.frontpagemagazine.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID={AD363EAC-228E-432A-9F15-8702D7765792} "The Anti-Terror, Pro-Israel Sheikh"] ''[[FrontPage Magazine]]'', September 12, 2005. "I find in the Qur'an that God granted the Land of Israel to the Children of Israel and ordered them to settle therein ({{cite quran|5|21|style=ref}}) and that before the [[Qiyamah|Last Day]] He will bring the Children of Israel to retake possession of their Land, gathering them from different countries and nations ({{cite quran|17|104|style=ref}}). Consequently, as a Muslim who abides by the Qur'an, I believe that opposing the existence of the State of Israel means opposing a Divine decree."</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Cobb |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The scathing scholar |quote=despite what Muslims are taught, Islam's holy book, the Koran, supports the right of Israel to exist and for Jews to live there.|url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=604855a0-7b9c-4519-a841-f4736d59eaa1 |work= |publisher=[[The Ottawa Citizen]] |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=2008-03-26 }}</ref> Other Muslims who have supported Zionism include Bengali journalist [[Salah Choudhury]] and Pakistani journalist [[Tashbih Sayyed]].<ref>Neuwirth, Rachel.

[[Arabic-speaking Christians|Christian Arabs]] publicly supporting Israel include US author [[Nonie Darwish]], creator of the [http://www.arabsforisrael.com/ Arabs for Israel] web site, and former Muslim [[Magdi Allam]], author of ''Viva Israele''.<ref>ISBN 9788804567776</ref>, both born in Egypt.
