An '''erg''' (also '''sand sea''' or '''dune sea''') is a large, relatively flat area of [[desert]] covered with [[wind]]-swept [[sand]] with little or no vegetative cover.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16813 | title=Issaouane Erg, Algeria | publisher=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] | accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> The term takes its name from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''erg'' ({{lang|ar|عرق}}), meaning "dune field".<ref name="corps">{{cite web | url=http://www.tec.army.mil/research/products/desert_guide/lsmsheet/lsseas.htm | title=Summary: Sand Seas/Ergs/Dune Fields | work=Desert Guide | publisher=[[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] | accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> Strictly speaking, an erg is defined as a desert area that contains more than 125 [[square kilometer]]s of [[aeolian]] or wind-blown sand<ref name="e2">{{cite web | url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=erg | title=Erg | publisher=[[Everything2]] | accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> and where sand covers more than 20% of the surface.<ref name="corps"/> Smaller areas are known as [[dune field]]s.

==Description==
[[Image:Morocco Africa Flickr Rosino December 2005 84514010.jpg|left|thumb|[[Erg Chebbi]], Morocco. ({{coord|31.17°|-3.98°|display=inline}})]]
Ergs are concentrated in two broad belts between [[20th parallel north|20°]] to [[40th parallel north|40°N]] and [[20th parallel south|20°]] to [[40th parallel south|40°S]]  latitudes, which include regions crossed by the dry, subsiding air of the [[trade wind]]s. Active ergs are limited to regions that receive, on the average, no more than 150 mm of annual precipitation.<ref name="corps"/> The largest are in [[North Africa|northern]] and [[Southern Africa|southern]] [[Africa]], [[Central Asia|central]] and [[Southwest Asia|western]] [[Asia]], and [[Central Australia]]. In [[South America]], ergs are limited by the [[Andes|Andes Mountains]], but they do contain extremely large dunes in coastal [[Peru]] and northwestern [[Argentina]].  They are also found in several parts of the northeast coast of [[Brasil]]. The only active erg in [[North America]] is in the [[Gran Desierto de Altar]] ({{coord|31.95°|-114.14°|display=inline}}) that extends from the [[Sonoran Desert]] in the northwestern Mexican state of [[Sonora]] to  the [[Yuma Desert]] of [[Arizona]] and the [[Algodones Dunes]] of southeastern [[California]]. An erg that has been fixed by vegetation forms the [[Nebraska Sand Hills]] ({{coord|42.13°|-102.19°|display=inline}}).

Sand seas and dune fields generally occur in regions downwind of copious sources of dry, loose sand, such as dry [[riverbed]]s and [[river delta|deltas]], [[floodplain]]s, [[sandur|glacial outwash plains]], dry [[lake]]s, and [[beach]]es. Almost all major ergs are located downwind from river beds in areas that are too dry to support extensive vegetative cover and are thus subject to long-continued wind erosion. Sand from these abundant sources migrates downwind and builds up into very large dunes where its movement is halted or slowed by [[topographic]] barriers to windflow or by convergence of windflow. Entire ergs and dune fields tend to migrate downwind as far as hundreds of kilometers from their sources of sand. Such accumulation requires long periods of time. At least one million years are required to build ergs with very large dunes, such as those on the [[Arabian Peninsula]], in North Africa, and in central Asia.<ref>Wilson, I. 1971. Desert sandflow basins and a model for the development of ergs. Geographical Journal, v. 137, Pt. 2, pp. 180-199.</ref> Sand seas that have accumulated in subsiding structural and topographic basins, such as the [[Murzuk Sand Sea]] ({{coord|25.90°|13.90°|display=inline}}) of [[Libya]], may attain great thicknesses (more than 1000&nbsp;m<ref>Glennie, K.W. 1970. Desert sedimentary environments: Developments in sedimentology 14, Enclosure 4. New York: American Elsevier Publishing Co.</ref>) but others, such as the ergs of linear dunes in the [[Simpson Desert]] 
({{coord|-24.95°|137.42°|display=inline}})  and [[Great Sandy Desert]] ({{coord|-19.70°|122.62°|display=inline}}) of Australia, may be no thicker than the individual dunes superposed on the [[alluvial plain]]. Within sand seas in a given area, the dunes tend to be of a single type. For example, there are ergs or fields of linear dunes, of crescentic dunes, of star dunes, and of parabolic dunes, and these dune arrays tend to have consistent orientations and sizes.<ref>Breed, C.S., and T. Grow. 1979. Morphology and distribution of dunes in sand seas observed by remote sensing. In A study of global sand seas, edited by E.D. McKee.

By nature, ergs are very active. Smaller dunes form and migrate along the flanks of the larger dunes and sand ridges. Occasional [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] fills basins formed by the dunes; as the water evaporates, [[salt]] deposits are left behind.

Individual dunes in ergs typically have widths, lengths, or both dimensions greater than 500&nbsp;m.<ref name="corps"/> Both the regional extent of their sand cover and the complexity and great size of their dunes distinguish ergs from dune fields.

==Extraterrestrial ergs==

{{seealso|List of extraterrestrial dune fields}}
Ergs are a geological feature that can be found on [[planet]]s where an [[atmosphere]] capable of significant [[wind erosion]] acts on the surface for a significant period of time, creating [[sand]] and allowing it to accumulate.
Today at least three bodies, apart from Earth, are known in the [[solar system]] to feature ergs on their surface: Venus, Mars and Titan.

===Venus===
At least two ergs have been recognized by the [[Magellan probe]] on [[Venus]]: the Aglaonice dune field, which covers approximately {{convert|1290|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, and the Meshkenet dune field (~{{convert|17120|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on|disp=slash}}).<ref>Greeley, R., et al. (1992), [http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1992/92JE00980.shtml Aeolian features on Venus: Preliminary Magellan results], J. Geophys. Res., 97(E8), 13,319–13,345.</ref> These seem to be mostly transverse dune fields (with dune crests perpendicular to prevailing winds).

===Mars===
[[Mars]] shows very large ergs, especially next to the polar caps, where dunes can reach a considerable size.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mystery_monday_031110.html | title=Sand Dunes on Mars Reach Dizzying Heights | publisher=Space.com | first=Robert Roy | last=Britt | date=2003-11-10}}</ref> Ergs on Mars can exhibit strange shapes and patterns, due to complex interaction with the underlying surface and wind direction.

===Titan===
Radar images captured by the [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]] spacecraft as it flew by [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] in October 2005 show sand dunes at Titan's equator much like those in deserts of Earth. One erg was observed to be more than {{convert|930|mi|km|0}} long.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://uanews.org/node/12303 | title=Titan's Seas Are Sand | work=UA News | publisher=University of Arizona | first=Lori | last=Stiles | date=2006-05-04}}</ref> The sand dunes are believed to be formed by wind generated as a result of tidal forces from Saturn on Titan's atmosphere.

The images are evidence that these dunes were built from winds that blow in one direction before switching to another and then back to the first direction and so on, causing the sand dunes to build up in long parallel lines. These tidal winds combined with Titan's west-to-east zonal winds create dunes aligned west-to-east nearly everywhere except close to mountains, which alter wind direction.

The sand on Titan might have formed when liquid methane rained and eroded the ice bedrock, possibly in the form of flash floods. Alternatively, the sand could also have come from organic solids produced by photochemical reactions in Titan's atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060504_sands_titan.html | title=Saharan Sand Dunes Found on Saturn's Moon Titan | publisher=Space.com | first=Sara | last=Goudarzi | date=2006-05-04}}</ref>
