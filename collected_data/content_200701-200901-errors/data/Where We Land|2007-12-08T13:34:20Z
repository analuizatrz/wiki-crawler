'''''Where We Land''''' is the first studio [[album]] by [[Irish Australian]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Damien Leith]]. It was released by [[Sony BMG]] in [[Australia]] on [[August 18]], [[2007]], and in [[Ireland]] on [[September 28]], [[2007]]. Leith produced the album for seven months and created the album entirely with [[acoustic music|acoustic]] songs. He wrote or co-wrote nine of the twelve songs, collaborating with [[Alex Lloyd]] and his music director [[Paul Gray (songwriter)|Paul Gray]] ([[Wa Wa Nee]]) in a few songs. All of his original songs were inspired by his friends and family. Leith included two [[cover version|cover songs]] in the album, [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s "Songbird" from the album ''[[Rumours]]'' and the traditional Irish song "[[Danny Boy]]". ''Where We Land'' received mostly average reviews from critics. It debuted in the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Albums Chart]] at number-one and was certified [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]]. The album spawned the singles "[[22 Steps]]" and "[[All I Want Is You (Damien Leith song)|All I Want Is You]]". Leith embarked on a national tour across Australia to promote the album in November 2007.

==Background==

Damien Leith stated how his debut studio album wanted to pan out: "I didn't really want to do anybody else's songs... I just wanted this album to be mine".<ref name="Why Damien Leith's flying high">Moran, Jonathon. "[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22177159-5001021,00.html Why Damien Leith's flying high]", ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'', [[August 5]], [[2007]]. Retrieved on [[September 9]], [[2007]].</ref> Immediately after ''[[Australian Idol]]'' concluded, he convinced the producers of the show to break from protocol by giving him longer time to record the album.<ref name="One hell of a journey">Mathewson, Catriona. "[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22249255-5003421,00.html One hell of a journey]", ''[[Courier Mail]]'', [[August 16]], [[2007]]. Retrieved on [[September 22]], [[2007]].</ref> The protocol was that the ''Australian Idol'' winners had only one week after the competition ended to record their first album. He decided to work on his first studio album for the next few months.<ref name="Why Damien Leith's flying high"/> Leith was aware of the little success of the previous two ''Idol'' winners, [[Casey Donovan (singer)|Casey Donovan]] and [[Kate DeAraugo]], so he decided to turn something more palpable than the previous winners by producing an album of original songs. He comments, "I suppose the main thing for me was trying to establish myself as a songwriter out of it because that's something that hasn't really been promoted in the past."<ref name="One hell of a journey"/> He was determined to create as much original material as possible for the album, and create songs that truly represent who he was.<ref name="Damien Leith releases album of originals">"[http://www.thewest.com.au/aapstory.aspx?StoryName=409993 Damien Leith releases album of originals]", ''[[The West Australian]]'', [[August 17]], [[2007]]. Retrieved on [[September 9]], [[2007]].</ref> He also wanted the themes in the lyrics to not only be personal, but broad enough so that listeners can relate to them.<ref name="Why Damien Leith's flying high"/>

==Production and recording==

Leith remarked that recording the album was an exciting but nerve-racking experience.<ref name="Edgy start to songs in the attic">Sams, Christine. "[http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/edgy-start-to-songs-in-the-attic/2007/08/12/1186857326981.html Edgy start to songs in the attic]", ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', [[August 13]], [[2007]]. Retrieved on [[September 9]], [[2007]].</ref> He recorded his music at [[Sony BMG]]'s recording studio in [[East Sydney]].<ref>Sams, Christine. "[http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/the-damien-sessions/2007/06/24/1182623722239.html Damien Leith's recording sessions]", ''[[The Sun-Herald]]'', [[June 25]], [[2007]]. Retrieved on [[September 21]], [[2007]].</ref> His producers already had in mind what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally [[acoustic music|acoustic]].<ref>Delaney, Colin. "[http://www.tntdownunder.com/article/2441469719.html Interview with Damien Leith]", Travel Down Under, [[August 20]], [[2007]]. Retrieved on [[September 21]], [[2007]].</ref> Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new ''Australian Idol'', he knew that it was risky to produce an acoustic based album because it was very different from the records produced by the previous ''Idol'' contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat [[pop music|pop]] songs. He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.<ref name="Damien Leith releases album of originals"/>

As a result, he and his producers spent the time to work on the songs which would appeal to a broader audience. Leith did this by holding onto several elements in his music that people had enjoyed on ''Australian Idol''.<ref name="Q&A with Damien Leith">Adams, Cameron. "[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22132538-2902,00.html?from=public_rss Q & A with Damien Leith]", ''[[Herald Sun]]'', [[July 26]], [[2007]]. Retrieved on [[September 15]], [[2007]].</ref> However, he still wanted to show new elements to the album, so he held on some elements of acoustic music. Leith comments,

<blockquote>"We didn't want to be too acoustic, or too rocky. I've been conscious of the people who bought ''[[The Winner's Journey]]'', but also conscious about grabbing a new audience as well... I think this album's got all those kind of ''Winner's Journey'' elements – the falsetto and the emotional thing. But it's got a lot of me in it too."<ref name="One hell of a journey"/></blockquote>

Damien Leith was also conscious of the lyrics we wrote. He added a few emotional [[ballad (music)|ballads]] which contained strong lyrics, but had left out the songs he thought were too depressing.<ref name="Q&A with Damien Leith"/>

Leith spent seven months of recording and writing and worked with Bryon Jones, James Roche and Ross Fraser. Initially, he wanted the album to he released in March, but it was pushed back to August, partly due to the prolonged success of ''The Winner's Journey'' and partly because of the large amount of songs they had to cull.<ref name="One hell of a journey"/> 

==Writing and inspiration==

The songs he wrote were inspired by his family and friends. A few of the songs explored the themes of [[love]] and fulfillment. "Not Just for the Weekend" was a song he wrote after the birth of his second son, Jagger. The song "Beautiful" is a love song written to his wife Eileen.<ref name="Damien Leith releases album of originals"/> Other songs in the album explored much darker themes. "Blew It All Away" is a heartfelt song about the [[suicide]] of a friend, which happened shortly after another friend died from cancer. Another song, "Alone" was inspired from a friend who was struggling after his father's death. "Shine Like the Sun" is about a friend in [[Ireland]] who was experiencing a rough relationship.<ref name="Edgy start to songs in the attic"/>

Leith wrote or co-wrote a total of nine tracks out of the twelve in the album. Incidentally, the first single and the opening track "[[22 Steps]]" was a song he did not write; it was written by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Andy Stochansky]]. Another non-original track Leith recorded was a [[cover song|cover]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s "Songbird" from their album ''[[Rumours]]''. This song holds special meaning for Leith, as his sister sang this song during his and Eileen's wedding.<ref name="No new Leith on life">Moran, Jonathon.

Retrieved on [[September 15]], [[2007]].</ref> Leith collaborated with Australian writers in a few songs, including [[Alex Lloyd]] who co-wrote with Leith the songs "Beautiful" and "Blew It All Away".<ref>McCabe, Kathy.

Retrieved on [[September 15]], [[2007]].</ref> They also wrote four other songs which they did not include in the album because they were too [[alternative rock|alternative]].<ref name="One hell of a journey"/> His musical director [[Paul Gray (songwriter)|Paul Gray]] of [[Wa Wa Nee]] co-wrote the track "Alone".<ref name="Q&A with Damien Leith"/> He left out his debut single "[[Night of My Life]]", originally written for his win on ''Idol'', because he could not relate to the lyrics in his everyday life, only within the context of the show.<ref name="One hell of a journey"/> [[Sony BMG]] added a raw bonus track, the traditional Irish song "[[Danny Boy]]" which Leith did a one-take recording of for a fan. Initially, Leith was hesitant to include it in the album because it was so raw.<ref name="Edgy start to songs in the attic"/>

Damien Leith chose to name the album ''Where We Land'' as it described all the things that happened to him in the past year individually and professionally, and also illustrated his journey to Australia in various ways.<ref>[http://www.damienleith.com.au/biography/home.do Damien Leith Biography].

==Critical reception==

Responses from critics have given mostly average reviews of the album. Polly Coufos from ''[[The Sunday Times (Australia)|The Sunday Times]]'' considers Damien Leith as "the most complete artist ''Australian Idol'' has yet uncovered". Coufos rated the album 3.5 stars, and comments that "Leith uses that heavenly [[falsetto]] as often as possible without making himself appear a one-trick pony". Coufos, however says that the two cover songs, "Songbird" and "Danny Boy" are an "unnecessary hedging of bets".<ref>Coufos, Polly.
