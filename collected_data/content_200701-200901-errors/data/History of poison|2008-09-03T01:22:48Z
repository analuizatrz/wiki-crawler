{{toxicology}}
The '''history of [[poison]]'''<ref>[[Poison]] is defined as a "substance that causes death or injury when swallowed or absorbed." {{cite book|title=Collins English Dictionary|author=Colins Dictionaries, from the Bank of English|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|pages=594|date=2001|id=ISBN 0007666918}}</ref> stretches from before 4500 BC to the [[present day]]. Poisons have been used for many purposes across the span of human existence, most commonly as [[weapon]]s, [[anti-venom]]s, and [[medicine]]s. Poison has allowed much progress in branches of medicine, [[toxicology]], and [[technology]], among other sciences.

Poison was discovered in [[ancient times]], and was used by primitive tribes and civilizations as a hunting tool to quicken and ensure the death of their prey or enemies. This use of poison grew more advanced, and many of these ancient peoples began forging weapons designed specifically for poison enhancement. Later in history, particularly at the time of the [[Roman empire]], one of the more prevalent uses for poison was [[assassination]]. As early as 331 BC, poisonings executed at the dinner table or in drinks were reported, and the practice became a common occurrence. The use of fatal substances was seen among every social class; even the [[nobility]] would often use it to dispose of unwanted political or economic opponents.

In the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Europe, poison became a more popular form of killing, though cures surfaced for many of the more widely known poisons. This was stimulated by the increased availability of poisons; shops known as [[apothecaries]], selling various medicinal wares, were open to the public, and from there, substances that were traditionally used for curative purposes were employed for more sinister means. At approximately the same time, other areas of the world were making great advances in terms of poison; [[Arab]]s had successfully made arsenic odorless and transparent, making assassinations impossible to detect. This "poison epidemic" was also prevalent in parts of [[Asia]] at this time, as well.

Over the centuries, the use of poisons for devious means and harmful purposes continued to escalate. The means for curing these poisons also continued to advance, but new poisons surfaced and became popular among criminals. In the present day, poisoning by harmful intent is less prevalent, and the risk of accidental poisoning now exists more in everyday substances and products. In addition, its use has widened exponentially; poison is often used as a [[pesticide]], [[disinfectant]], cleaning solution, or [[preservative]], among others. Despite this, the first use of poison&mdash;as a hunting tool&mdash;still remains in remote parts of developing countries, especially those in [[Africa]], [[South America]], and Asia.

==Ancient times and Dark Ages==
[[Image:Strychnos Toxifera by Koehler 1887.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Strychnos toxifera'', a plant used for the making of dart and arrow poisons]]
[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] findings prove that while [[human evolution|primitive mankind]] used conventional weapons such as axes and clubs, and later swords, they sought more subtle, destructive means of causing [[death]]&mdash;something that could be achieved through poison.<ref name="ancient">{{Cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.mvm.ed.ac.uk/studentwebs/session2/group12/ancient.htm|title=Ancient poisons|accessmonthday=1 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
Grooves for storing or holding poisons such as [[tubocurarine]] have been found in their hunting weapons and tools, showing that early humans had discovered poisons of varying potency and applied them to their weapons.<ref name="ancient" /> Some<!-- who? --> speculate that this use and existence of these strange and noxious substances was kept secret within the more important and higher-ranked members of a [[tribe]] or [[clan]], and were seen as emblems of a greater power. This may have also given birth to the concept of the stereotypical "[[medicine man]]" or "[[witch doctor]]".<ref name="ancient" />

Once the use and danger of poison was realized, it became apparent that something had to be done. [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]], King of [[Pontus]] (an ancient [[Hellenistic]] state of northern [[Anatolia]]), from around 114&ndash;63 BC, lived in constant fear of being assassinated through poison. He became a hard-working pioneer in the search for a cure for poisons.<ref name="ancient" /> In his position of power, he was able to test poisons on criminals facing execution, and then if there was a possible antidote. He was paranoid to the point that he administered daily amounts of poisons in an attempt to make himself immune to as many poisons as he could.<ref name="ancient" /> Eventually, he discovered a formula that combined small portions of dozens of the best-known herbal remedies of the time, which he named [[Mithridatium]].<ref name="ancient" /> This was kept secret until his kingdom was invaded by [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]], who took it back to Rome.  After being defeated by [[Pompey]], Mithridates' antidote prescriptions and notes of medicinal plants were taken by the Romans and translated into Latin.<ref name="mithridatum">Grout, James. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/aconite/mithridatum.html Mithridatum] (June 2008). Retrieved on 29 April 2007.</ref>

[[Pliny the Younger]] describes over 7000 different poisons. One he describes as "The blood of a duck found in a certain district of Pontus, which was supposed to live on poisonous food, and the blood of this duck was afterwards used in the preparation of the Mithridatum, because it fed on poisonous plants and suffered no harm."<ref name="ancient" />

Indian surgeon [[Sushruta]] defined the stages of slow poisoning and the remedies of slow poisoning. He also mentions antidotes and the use of traditional substances to counter the effects of poisoning.<ref>Wujastyk, D. et. al. ''The Roots of Ayurveda: Selections from Sanskrit Medical Writings''. ISBN 0140448241. p. 144</ref>

===India===
Poisoned weapons were used in ancient India,<ref name="chatterjee">Chatterjee, Hiralal. ''International Law and Inter-state Relations in Ancient India'' (1958). K. L. Mukhopadhyay. p. 104</ref> and war tactics in [[history of India|ancient India]] have references to poison. A verse in Sanskrit reads "''Jalam visravayet sarmavamavisravyam ca dusayet''," which translates to "Waters of wells were to be mixed with poison and thus polluted."<ref name="chatterjee"/>

[[Chanakya|Chānakya]] (c. 350&ndash;283 BC), also known as ''Kautilya'', was adviser and [[prime minister]]<ref>{{cite journal | first = Roger | last = Boesche | year = 2003 | month = January | title = Kautilya's ''Arthaśāstra'' on War and Diplomacy in Ancient India | journal = The Journal of Military History | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–37 | id = ISSN 0899-3718 | doi = 10.1353/jmh.2003.0006 }} "Kautilya [[is]] sometimes called a chancellor or prime minister to Chandragupta, something like a Bismarck…"</ref> to the first [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] Emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] (c. 340&ndash;293 BC).

[[Image:Flint sword and spear.jpg|left|thumb|150px|An example of a flint sword and spear, weapons used for hunting in ancient times.]]

===Egypt===
Unlike many civilizations, records of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] knowledge and use of poisons can only be dated back to approximately 300 BC. However, it is believed that the earliest known Egyptian [[pharaoh]], [[Menes]], studied the properties of poisonous plants and venoms, according to early records.<ref name="ancient" />

After this, however, evidence of knowledge of poison in Ptolemaic Egypt can be traced to the writings of an ancient  alchemist, [[Agathodiamon]] (100BC approx.), who spoke of an (unidentified) mineral that when mixed with [[natron]] produced a 'fiery poison'. He described this poison as 'disappearing in water', giving a clear solution. <ref name="emsley2-3">Emsley, pp. 2&ndash;3</ref> Emsley speculates that the 'fiery poison' was arsenic trioxide, the unidentified mineral having to have been either [[realgar]] or [[orpiment]], due to the relation between the unidentified mineral and his other writings.<ref name="emsley2-3">Emsley, pp. 2&ndash;3</ref>

The Egyptians are also thought to have come into knowledge about elements such as [[antimony]], [[copper]], [[arsenic|crude arsenic]], [[lead]], [[opium]], and [[mandrake (plant)|mandrake]] (among others). Other such secrets were revealed in [[papyrus|papyri]]. Egyptians are now thought to be the first to properly master [[distillation]], and to manipulate the poison that can be retrieved from peach kernels<!-- Is this cyanide? -->.<ref name="ancient" />

Finally, [[Cleopatra]] is said to have poisoned herself with an asp after hearing of [[Marc Antony]]'s demise. Prior to her death, she was said to have sent many of her maidservants to act as guinea pigs to test different poisons, including [[belladonna (plant)|belladonna]], [[henbane]], and the [[strychnine]] tree's seed.<ref name="RD">{{cite book |author= |title=Magic and Medicine of Plants |publisher=Reader's Digest Association |location=Pleasantville, N.Y |year=1986 |pages=389 |isbn=0-89577-221-3 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

===Rome===
[[Image:Nero Palatino Inv618.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A bust of the Roman Emperor Nero, who used cyanide to dispose of unwanted family members]]

In Roman times, poisoning carried out at the dinner table or common eating or drinking area was not unheard of, or even uncommon, and was happening as early as 331 BC.<ref name="ancient" /> These poisonings would have been used for self-advantageous reasons in every class of the social order. The writer [[Livy]] describes the poisoning of members of the upper class and nobles of [[Rome]], and Roman emperor [[Nero]] is known to have favored the use of poisons on his relatives, even hiring a personal poisoner. His preferred poison was said to be [[cyanide]].<ref name="ancient" />

Nero's predecessor, [[Claudius]], was allegedly poisoned with mushrooms or alternatively poison herbs.<ref name=Suet44>Suetonius, ''Claudius''</ref> However, accounts of the way Claudius died vary greatly. [[Halotus]], his taster, Xenophon, his doctor, and the infamous poisoner [[Locusta]] have all been accused of possibly being the administrator of the fatal substance, but [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], his final wife, is considered to be the most likely to have arranged his murder and may have even administered the poison herself. Some report that he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at his evening meal, while some say that he recovered somewhat, only to be poisoned once more by a feather dipped in poison which was pushed down his throat under the pretense of helping him to vomit,<ref>[[Tacitus]]; ''Annals'' XII p. 64, pp. 66&ndash;67;</ref> or by poisoned gruel or an enema.<ref name=Suet44/> Agrippina is considered to be the murderer, because she was ambitious for her son, [[Nero]], and Claudius had become suspicious of her intrigues.<ref>Accounts of his death: [[Suetonius]] ''Claudius'' p. 43&ndash;44; [[Tacitus]]; ''Annals'' XII 64, pp. 66&ndash;67; [[Pliny the Elder]] ''Natural History'' II p. 92, XI p. 189, XXII p. 92.</ref>

==Middle Ages==
Later, in Europe during the Middle Ages, when the nature of poisons were known better than simply as [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[witchcraft]], there were sellers and suppliers of [[potion]]s and poisons, known as [[apothecaries]].<ref name="medieval">{{cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.mvm.ed.ac.uk/studentwebs/session2/group12/middle.htm|title=Medieval poisons|accessmonthday=1 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref><!-- source not reliable!!! --> Despite the fact that the medicinal uses of poisons were now known, it was no secret that people bought poisons for less useful and lawful reasons. The alchemists who worked in these apothecaries suffered a considerable risk to their health, working so invariably close to poisonous substances.<ref name="emsley2">Emsley, p. 2</ref> At the same time, in other areas of the world, the technological advancement of poisons was expanding, and in the [[Arab]] nations, some had succeeded in making arsenic transparent, odourless and tasteless when applied to a drink, a method which would allow poison murderers to remain undetected for at least one millennium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A4350755|title=A Brief History of Poisoning|accessmonthday=21 April|accessyear=2007|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

An excerpt from [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', a text that existed sometime in the [[14th century]] to the [[15th century]] describes a killer buying poison from an apothecary to rid a [[rat]] infestation:

{{blockquote|And forth he goes&mdash;no longer he would tarry&mdash;<br />Into the town unto a ‘pothecary<br /> And prayed him that he woulde sell<br /> Some poison, that he might his rattes quell…<br /> The ‘pothecary answered: "And thou shalt have<br /> A thing that, all so God my soule save,<br /> In all this world there is no creature<br /> That ate or drunk has of this confiture<br /> Not but the montance of a corn of wheat<br /> That he ne shall his life anon forlete.<br /> Yea, starve (die) he shall, and that in lesse while<br /> Than thou wilt go a pace but not a mile<br /> The poison is so strong and violent<br />|[[Canterbury Tales]]&mdash;''[[The Pardoner's Tale]]''. Lines 565&ndash;581.}}

This is one example of work of [[literature]] related to poison; poisons and potions were a very popular subject particularly in fiction, such as in Shakespeare's works. There were also academic texts discussing the subject, and both [[non-fiction]] and [[fiction]] were written for the most part by [[monk]]s, whose [[knowledge]] and [[wisdom]] were respected, and as such authored a large portion of published works on the subject.<ref name="medieval"/>

One example of a non-fiction work is ''The Book of Venoms'', a book describing the known poisons of the time, their effects and uses, written by Magister Santes de Ardoynis in 1424. It also recommended the best known treatments for a given poison.
Despite this, it is considered probable that these factual works were not released to the [[public]], but kept within appropriate learned circles for study and research.<ref name="medieval" />

===Public reaction===
If the truth was kept from the public, it did not prevent the spawning of [[folk-lore|folklore]] and [[rumors]] about poisons, and use of them for purposes that were distasteful to the public. This caused a level of [[paranoia]] within areas of the societies of [[England]] and [[Europe]].<ref name="medieval" /> This wave of concern was furthered by the availability of "medicine" potent enough to be lethal when secretly administered in sufficient quantity&mdash;it provided an easy way to kill, and one which was subtle, quiet, and generally allowed the criminal to remain undetected.<ref name="medieval" />
Perhaps it was this wave of paranoia that swept the streets, or the public need for answers about these toxins, but books about ways of counteracting poisons became sought for, and fed off the mounting anxiety, even though generally being wholly inaccurate.<ref name="medieval" />

Naturally, crafty book salesmen would have sought to inflame the issue as a marketing ploy, and exaggerate the risk so that people would buy their books in search of a non-existent security. Other salesmen such as [[jewelry]] traders offering a supposedly poison-weakening [[amulet]], or a [[Physician|doctor]] selling a magical cure would have profited greatly in such times of doubt.
The information the public craved was kept from them, a treasure only for scholars and scientists, and so the public was left to make their own assumptions.<ref name="medieval" />

==Later imperial Asia==
Despite the negative effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example can be found in the works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar [[Rhazes]], writer of ''Secret of Secrets'', which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a [[laxative]]. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the [[itch]]', which is now referred to as [[scabies]]. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.<ref name="emsley3-4">Emsley, pp. 3&ndash;4</ref>

In India, the troubled 14th and 15th centuries in [[Rajasthan]] saw invasions in the [[Rajput]] heartlands. Rajput women practiced a custom of ''jauhar'' ( literally ''the taking of life'') when their sons, brothers, or husbands faced certain death in battle. ''Jauhar'' was practiced within the ''[[Kshatriya]]'' warrior class to avoid the fate of subservience, slavery, rape, or slaughter at the hands of the invading forces.<ref>Bose, Mandakranta. ''Faces of the Feminine in Ancient, Medieval, and Modern India'' (2000). Oxford University Press. ISBN 0195122291. p. 26</ref>

==Renaissance==
By the [[Renaissance]], the use of poisons for unlawful and reprehensible intentions had peaked; it was arguably becoming any assassin or murderer's essential tool.<ref name="Renaissance">{{cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.mvm.ed.ac.uk/studentwebs/session2/group12/renaissance.htm|title=Poisons of the Renaissance|accessmonthday=1 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref> This peaking of poison's popularity within crime syndicates and circles would probably have been due at least in part to the new discoveries that were then being made about poison.<ref name="Renaissance" />
Italian alchemists for one were, in the 14th and 15th century, realizing the potential of the combining of poisonous substances to create even more potent brews than the ones that had been put together,<ref name="Renaissance" /> and other new properties of poison were becoming clearer. A science of the study was forming, something today known as toxicology.
So prominently used for homicide in society was poison that one would be fearful even to attend a dinner party for fear of having the food or drink poisoned by either the host or perhaps one of the guests.<ref name="Renaissance" />

===Borgia family===
[[Image:Alexander VI - Pinturicchio detail.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The very controversial Pope Alexander VI, also known at birth as Roderic Borja]]
[[Cesare Borgia]] was the son of [[Pope Alexander VI]], perhaps one of the most disputed popes in regards to legitimacy, having used his power to promote his five sons to high titles.<ref name="Renaissance" /> He was thought to be a hostile and ruthless man, and was avoided and feared. Borgia was notorious not only for being the son of a very controversial man, but also because he was thought to be a poison-wielding murderer.<ref name="Renaissance" /> In the following quote, [[Apollinaire]] describes what he believes is a kind of 'Borgia Recipe' used for the disposing of victims:

{{cquote|La Cantarella. That which the Borgias utilised in conjunction with [[arsenic]] without knowing it, was [[phosphorus]], a secret which had been divulged to the Borgias by a Spanish monk, who also knew the antidote for it, as well as an antidote for arsenic; one sees, therefore that they were well armed.}}

After the death of Cesare Borgia's father, many rumors circulated proposing several theories about the cause, although most ended with the Pope having died in some horrible way involving murder, usually by poisoning. Apollinaire's idea was that the pope was poisoned by wine which was in fact intended for another at the dinner table, [[Cardinal de Corneto]]. [[Sanuto]] held a similar theory, except that it involved a box of sweetmeats, instead of wine.<ref name="Renaissance" /> Whatever the case, the death of the pope elicited little mourning, which was expected after the debased standards of his tenure. Historical evidence suggests that the pope was indeed poisoned in some way; when his body was exhibited, it was in a shocking state of decomposition. To reduce suspicion, it was only on display at night by candlelight.<ref name="Renaissance" />

Cesare Borgia's passing did not cause much sadness either, a result of the reputation that he had forged for himself. However, his sister [[Lucrezia Borgia|Lucrezia]] did mourn for this man who had been accused of so many crimes. Lucrezia was also considered a wrongdoer, but may in fact have been held responsible for some of Cesare's misdeeds.<ref name="Renaissance" />

===Council of Ten===
By the 16th century, the use of poison had become an art of sorts, and, in several cities of [[Italy]] including [[Venice]] and Rome, there were actual schools teaching the ways of poison and the 'art' which had been born.<ref name="Renaisance2">{{cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.mvm.ed.ac.uk/studentwebs/session2/group12/renaissance.htm|title=Poisons of the Renaissance|accessmonthday=2 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
Earlier, in the fifteenth century, a guild of alchemists and poisoners known as the Council of Ten was formed. This [[cult]] of poison-wielding assassins carried out contracts for people who paid them enough money, and usually anyone contracted for death ended up slain, killed by an undetected dose of lethal substances of varying description.<ref name="Renaisance2" />

===''Neopoliani Magioe Naturalis''===
''Neopoliani Magioe Naturalis'' was a publication first printed just before [[1590]] that detailed the art of poisoning, and effective methods of using poison to commit homicide. The most effective way of killing someone with poison, according to the work, was by drugging someone's wine, a method that was very popular at the time.<ref name="Renaisance2" />
One 'very strong mixture' used in the book is the ''Veninum Lupinum'', which consists of a mix of [[Aconitum|aconite]], [[taxus baccata]], [[caustic lime]], [[arsenic]], bitter [[almonds]] and powdered [[glass]] mixed with honey. The overall product is a [[pill (pharmacy)|pill]] approximately the size of a [[walnut]].<ref name="Renaisance2" />

==16th&ndash;18th centuries==
By the end of the [[16th century]], the art and popularity of poison had moved from Italy to [[France]], where criminal poisoning was becoming more and more frequent. It is estimated that in the 1570s that there would have been about thirty thousand people in [[Paris]] alone using poison or having some connection to poison in an illegal or immoral way.<ref name="later">{{cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.mvm.ed.ac.uk/studentwebs/session2/group12/16th.htm|title=16-18th century in Poison|accessmonthday=2 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref> It was becoming something of which was described as a 'plague' or 'epidemic'.<ref name="later" />
And this epidemic, while obviously contributing greatly to the death toll, was also greatly affecting citizens who had no connection to poison.
Many people, nobles especially, were becoming extremely afraid of poisoning. They would attend dinner parties of only the most trusted, and hired only hand-picked servants.
Several instances very famous or high-born people who were very afraid of poisoning are both [[Henrietta Anne Stuart|Henrietta Anne of England]] and [[Henry IV]].<ref name="later" />
The princess Henrietta Anne of England was so fearful and aware of poisoning that she instantly made the assumption that she had been poisoned when she was afflicted with a peritonitis due to a duodenal ulcer, while Henry IV, while making a visit to the [[Louvre]], was recorded to have eaten only eggs that he had cooked himself, and drank only water that he had poured for himself.<ref name="later" />
Later, in 1662, Louis XIV limited the sale of poisons within apothecaries, and certain poisons were not to be sold, except to people whom the shopkeeper knew well to be trustworthy.<ref name="later" />

Trustworthy alchemists did, however, become hard to find during this period; many of them were [[con men]], fooling both their patrons and the public at large into believing that [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]], thought then to be something of a 'core' element&mdash;one of which all others were invariably composed&mdash;was convertible into gold and other fine metals. While many took advantage of this belief, others genuinely, in the name of science, attempted to make gold out of less valuable and duller elements. Such of these alchemists were driven towards the same goal of attaining three objects of high desire within alchemical circles: the Philiosopher's Stone, able to change [[base metal]]s into pure gold; the [[Elixir of Life]], which lengthened one's life expansively, and finally, the [[Alkahest]], a substance which was capable of dissolving anything. The pursuit of these goals, as fantastical, but scientifically supported as it was, retarded greatly the progress of alchemical science, as these goals were ultimately impossible to realize.<ref name="emsley2">Emsley, p. 2</ref>
[[Image:Louis-xiv-lebrunl.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Louis XIV]]

===Chambre Ardente===
At a similar time to the ban of poisons, priests in [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] became so astounded with the number of poison-related confessions that they had listened to that they decided to inform the king about how bad the 'epidemic' of poison actually was.<ref name="later" /> In response to this, the king organized an order dedicated to the investigation of poisonings called the ''[[Chambre Ardente]]'', and the investigation itself became known as the ''[[Poison Affair|affaire des poisons]]''.

Despite the fact that the inquisitors had been sponsored by the sovereign himself, they failed to catch many of the worst and most murderous poisoners, in whom probably had many connections in which were employed to evade punishment. However, in the life of the order, approximately 442 persons were caught and received punishment.<ref name="later" />
The work of this order did cause a backfiring, or side effect that was a magnifying in the interest of poison and how to use them, and, inexplicably, many people actually became actively involved in poison after the birth of an order made to reduce poisonings.<ref name="later" />

[[Image:Charles II of Spain.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Carlos II, or Charles II, of Spain]]

===Spain===
While criminals based in Italy and England were the first to introduce poison as a means of murder or harm, during this period the use of poison truly was spreading all over Europe.
[[Spanish Empire|Spain]] was notable for the fact that it had, by some means or another, committed several failed attempts at the disposal of [[Queen Elizabeth of England]].<ref name="later" />
One person named Dr. [[Rodrigo Lopez]], a Jewish physician, was called on by Spain to kill the queen, but he was caught and then later hanged, drawn and quartered for the act, though Elizabeth herself and [[Robert Cecil]] doubted his guilt.<ref name="later" /> It is thought that some aspects, specifically a character, of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' may refer to or have been inspired by this Dr. Lopez.
After this particular incident, the queen's food had to be tasted for poisoning, and greater security was put into effect. She was even known to have taken antidotes on a weekly basis for protection.

Conversely, royal assassination attempts by poison were also domestic in Spain, with several people and groups wanting to kill the monarchs. One successful attempt at this (probable one of few in Europe) was the poisoning of [[Maria Luisa of Orléans|Marie Louise]], the wife of [[Charles II of Spain|Carlos II]], who died suddenly in September [[1689]].<ref name="later" />

==20th century==
The same trend continued through the [[Victorian era]], and was still labeled as an epidemic of sorts. Poison was still considered one of the easiest and simplest ways to commit murder.<ref name="Vic">{{cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.mvm.ed.ac.uk/studentwebs/session2/group12/victorian.htm|title=Victorian era in Poison|accessmonthday=3 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
However, several changes occurred in the Victorian era, such as the rise of the [[life insurance]] [[industry]], which made poisoning the "fashionable" crime, considering the guaranteed and lucrative profit in the killing of a life-ensured relative with a large price on their head.<ref name="Vic" />
But as the move into the 1900s occurred, the technology of preventing poisoning became better and more efficient, and criminal poisoning become much more difficult than in previous centuries.<ref name="twenty">{{cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.mvm.ed.ac.uk/studentwebs/session2/group12/20th.htm|title=20th century in Poisoning|accessmonthday=3 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
It had to be made cleaner and better planned to match the ever-advancing technologies employed against would-be poisoners.<ref name="twenty" />
However, because of a wider range of educated people, more people were able to understand how to use poison and were intelligent or skilled enough to plan out a logical poison-induced murder, whereas in past times, usually only a select few knowledgeable people knew enough to conduct a successful homicide.<ref name="twenty" />

[[Image:Goersuicide.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Goering]] in his cell after committing suicide by taking a lethal dose of cyanide.]]

===Old poisons===
Poison used in the past were also present in 20th century murders. In the early 20th century, arsenic was often used, but during the middle of the century, cyanide became quite popular. It was used during [[World War II]] by captured agents of the Resistance as a means of suicide to escape the heinous torture of their enemies.<ref name="twenty" /> Nazi war leader [[Herman Goering]] even used it to kill himself the night before he was supposed to be hanged during the [[Nuremberg Trials]].<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/nurembergcont.htm The Sentencing and Execution of Nazi War Criminals, 1946]. Retrieved on 3 April, 2007.</ref> [[Adolf Hitler]] had also taken a pill of [[cyanide]] shortly before the fall of [[Berlin]] along with his wife, [[Eva Braun]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902253,00.html TIME magazine - How Hitler Died]. Retrieved 21 May 2007.</ref>

However, new poisons became more frequently used to outmatch the knowledge of the current toxicology field of science. In this way, wielding a new and unknown poison, a poisoner could kill someone, and the death might be mistaken as an unfortunate case of a rare [[illness]].<ref name="twenty" /> This put a new strain on toxicology and other branches dealing with poison, and toxicologists were forced to work hard to keep up with the criminals who were using poisons that they had never previously encountered.

==Present day==
In the late 20th century, an increasing number of products used for everyday life proved to be poisonous. The risk of being poisoned nowadays lies more in the accidental factor, where poison be induced or taken by accident. These problems occur more frequently in [[children]], and poisoning is the 4th most common cause of death within young people. Accidental ingestions are most common in children less than 5 years old.

However, [[hospital]] and emergency facilities are much enhanced compared to the first half of the 20th century and before,
and antidotes are more available.
Antidotes have been found for many poisons, and the antidotes for some of the most commonly known poisons are shown in the table below:

However, poison still exists as a murderous entity today, but it is not as popular form of conducting murder as it used to be in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration.

One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident [[Alexander Litvinenko]] in 2006 from lethal [[Polonium|polonium-210]] [[radiation poisoning]] under highly suspicious circumstances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/news/articles/press_releases/2006/241106_litvinenko.htm |title=HPA Press Release | Mr Alexander Litvinenko– Health Protection Agency Statement |accessdate=2008-01-10 |format= |work=}}</ref>

===Other uses===
Today, poison is used for a wider variety of purposes than it used to be. For example, poison can be used to rid an unwanted infestation by pests or to kill weeds. Such chemicals, known as [[pesticide]]s,<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/index.htm What is a Pesticide?] (US EPA definitions) retrieved [[June 24]], [[2006]]</ref> have been known to be used in some form since about 2500 BC. However, the use of pesticides has increased staggeringly from [[1950]], and presently approximately 2.5 [[million]] tons of industrial pesticides are used each year.<ref>Miller, G. Tyler Jr. (2002). Living in the Environment (12th Ed.). Belmont: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.</ref> Other poisons can also be used to [[Food preservation|preserve foods]] and building material.

===In developing cultures===
Today, in many developing peoples of countries such as certain parts of Africa, South America and Asia, the use of poison as an actual weapon of hunting and attack still endures.
In Africa, certain arrow poisons are made using floral ingredients, such as of that taken from the plant ''Acokanthera''. This plant contains [[ouabain]], which is a cardiac glycoside, [[oleander]], and [[milkweed]]s.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/curare.htm|title=African arrow poison ingredients|accessmonthdate=28 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
Poisoned arrows are also still used in the jungle areas of [[Assam]], [[Burma]] and [[Malaysia]]. The ingredients for the creation of these poisons are mainly extracted from plants of the ''[[Antiaris]]'', ''[[Strychnos]]'' and ''Strophanthus'' genera, and ''[[Antiaris toxicaria]]'' (a tree of the [[mulberry]] and [[breadfruit]] family), for example, is used in the Java island of Indonesia, as well as several of its surrounding islands.
The juice or liquid extracts are smeared on the head of the arrow, and inflicts the target [[paralysis]], [[convulsions]] and/or [[cardiac arrest]], virtually on strike due to the speed in which the extracts can effect a victim.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/object_stories/arrows/index.html|title=Poisoned Arrows|accessmonthdate=30 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

As well as plant based poisons, there are others that are made that are based on animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a [[beetle]] genus of the Northern [[Kalahari Desert]] is used to create a slow-acting poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an [[adhesive]]. However, instead of the plant sap, a [[powder (substance)|powder]] made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.museums.org.za/bio/insects/beetles/chrysomelidae/arrows.htm|title=Animal Based Poisons Today - Kalahari Beetle|accessmonthdate=30 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
