==History==
{{main article|History of Florida Atlantic University}}
===Beginnings===

On July 15, [[1961]], the [[Florida Legislature]] passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in southeastern Florida.  A [[1940's]] era [[Boca Raton Airport|Army airbase]] in Boca Raton, Florida was selected as the site of the new university.  In [[1962]], the [[Florida Board of Control]] selected "Florida Atlantic University" as the name of the new institution.  Ground was broken on December 8, 1962.  FAU opened on September 14, 1964, six days behind schedule because of [[Hurricane Cleo]].  The first university in the nation to offer only upper-division and graduate work, FAU had an initial student body of 867.  U.S. [[Presidential system|President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] dedicated the university on October 25, 1964, and received the first honorary doctorate awarded by Florida Atlantic.  
[[Image:FAU Alumni Plaza.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Alumni Plaza]]
In [[1969]], the [[Florida Board of Regents|Board of Regents]] (successor to the Board of Control) approved an intercollegiate athletics program at FAU.  The university teams become known as the [[Burrowing owl|Owls]].  FAU expanded to [[Broward County, Florida]] in 1971, with the founding of the Commercial Boulevard campus in [[Fort Lauderdale]].  During that same year the university was also named a burrowing owl sanctuary.  By 1973, fall semester enrollment was 5,632.  By the fall semester of [[1983]], enrollment would reach 9,388.  For the first time in [[1984]], due to a rapidly growing population, Florida Atlantic opened its doors to [[freshmen]] and [[sophomores]].  In 1985, the Downtown Fort Lauderdale campus opened on Las Olas Boulevard.  

In [[1989]], the [[Florida Legislature]] designated Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County.  The university also reached $10 million in sponsored research activity for the first time.  Fall semester enrollment was 13,148.  In [[1993]], FAU was elected to the [[National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges]], the nation’s oldest higher education professional association.  The university's intercollegiate teams also joined the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] and moved to [[NCAA Division I]].  In [[1995]], Florida Atlantic purchased [[Barry University|Barry University’s]] [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] facility to establish a campus on the [[Treasure Coast]], in partnership with [[Indian River Community College]].  By [[1997]], sponsored research funding exceeded $24 million.  

In [[1999]], [[Howard Schnellenberger]], a legendary figure in [[college football]], was named Florida Atlantic’s first head [[american football|football]] coach.  The Barry and Florence Friedberg Lifelong Learning Center opened on the Boca Raton campus.  The [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]] campus also opened and was formally named for the late [[John D. MacArthur]].  Sponsored research funding exceeded $36 million.  By [[2003]], fall semester enrollment was 24,961.  FAU also has maintained the most diverse student body in the State University System, with [[minority]] enrollment of 34.6 percent.

In [[2003]], the State of Florida awarded FAU $10 million to establish the Center of Excellence in Biomedical and Marine Biotechnology, a research facility that searches the waters off Florida's coastline for drugs from natural sources that could be used to treat [[cancer]], [[heart disease]] and other serious illnesses.  The Lady Owls [[softball]] team won the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] championship for the seventh time and was listed among the all-time greatest teams in college softball history by the National Fastpitch Coaches Association.  In [[2004]], FAU admitted its first students to the [[University of Miami]]/Florida Atlantic University [[medical school]] partnership.

In 2006, FAU enrollment dropped 1.3% which could result in losses of up $2 million in expected student tuition and fees. This pattern mirrors other school districts in the area such as [[Broward County Public Schools]] which lost 10,000 students over the past two years and Palm Beach County schools which lost just over 3,000. Officials believe the high housing prices and previous years hurricanes are a factor.

===University presidents===
Florida Atlantic University's [[List of Presidents of Florida Atlantic University|fifth president]] is [[Frank T. Brogan]].[http://www.fau.edu/academic/iea/factbk/pres05.htm]
[[Image:FAU Baldwin House.jpg|right|thumb|250px|President's Residence at Baldwin House]]

==Regional Campuses==
In addition to the original campus in Boca Raton, FAU also has six other campuses to service the [[South Florida]] region. These campuses are located in the cities of:
*[[Dania Beach, Florida|Dania Beach]]
*[[Davie, Florida|Davie]]
*[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]
*[[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]]
*[[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] 
*[[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]], at the [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]] 
The Boca Raton campus remains the main campus with 69% of FAU's students enrolled there.[http://www.fau.edu/academic/iea/inst/facts.htm] At the present time, four student dormitories are present on this campus: Indian River Towers, Heritage Park Towers, Algonquin Hall, and the Village Apartments. There is additional housing located at the Jupiter campus for the [[Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College]]. 

==Academics==
[[Image:FAU Library.jpg|left|thumb|250px|S.E. Wimberly Library]]
In 1998, more than one-quarter of Florida Atlantic freshmen did not meet the state of Florida's minimum admission standards.[http://www.sptimes.com/State/120698/Some_find_university_2.html] In 2004, FAU's Board of Trustees raised admission standards for incoming Freshmen. [http://www.upressonline.com/media/storage/paper518/news/2004/02/05/Opinions/New-Admissions.Standards.Good.For.Fau.Bad.For.Florida-597434.shtml?norewrite200607121033&sourcedomain=www.upressonline.com] The Board stated a goal for a 3.2 [[GPA]] and a 500 score on each section of the [[SAT]] for admittance in 2007. Students with lower grades and scores would be required to take remedial courses at a [[community college]] before entering FAU. As a result of the increased admissions standards, by 2005, the average freshman entering Florida Atlantic had a 3.4 high school GPA, and scored 1058 on the SAT or a 22 on the [[ACT (examination)|ACT]].[http://www.fau.edu/academic/iea/inst/facts.htm]

Florida Atlantic University operates the largest continuing education program in the [[United States]]. Named the Lifelong Learning Society, the program serves the educational interests of [[senior citizens]] by providing classes focusing on subjects of interest, and provides audit options for regular university classes. In order to facilitate the growth of this program, in 1999 the Barry and Florence Friedberg Lifelong Learning Center opened on the Boca Raton campus. 

===Colleges===

===University Programs===
====Research====
Florida Atlantic has two [[Research and Development|Research and Development Parks (R&D)]]. One is located in [[Deerfield Beach]], Florida, and the other is located on the main Boca Raton campus. The R&D Parks provide outside research companies the ability to interact with the university community and take advantage of its facilities, resources, and expertise.  Located inside the R&D Park on the Boca Raton campus is a Technology Business Incubator (TBI). The TBI works to foster the start-up and growth of technology based businesses associated with Florida Atlantic University.[http://www.research-park.org/]

[[The Scripps Research Institute]] is currently in the process of developing a sister campus at the Jupiter FAU campus. '''Scripps Florida''' now operates with approximately 188 scientists, technicians, and administrative staff at a 40,000 square-foot lab facility.[http://www1.tcpalm.com/tcp/business/article/0,2541,TCP_998_4867069,00.html] Upon completion Scripps will operate out of a 364,000 square-foot, state-of-the-art biomedical research facility focusing on basic biomedical science, drug discovery, and technology development.
[[Image:FAU Schmidt BioMedical Center.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Schmidt Biomedical Science Center]]
FAU is the home of '''The Center of Excellence in Biomedical and Marine Biotechnology'''. Established in 2003, the University's Center of Excellence in Biomedical and Marine Biotechnology was selected by Florida’s Emerging Technology Commission as one of three centers in the state to receive $10 million in initial funding. Since receiving the startup funding, FAU has secured an additional $26 million from other sources, including federal and private research grants. As a result, the center has emerged as an academic and industry partnership combining expertise in [[ocean engineering]], [[biotechnology|marine biotechnology]], [[functional genomics]], [[proteomics]], and [[bioinformatics]]. Researchers, scientists, and students at the center are designing technologies to explore the sea, working to discover new medicines, and developing new therapeutics to combat agents of [[bioterrorism]].[http://wise.fau.edu/research/centers.php#EXCEL] 

Florida Atlantic is also the home of '''The Imaging Technology Center and [[NASA]] Imaging Technology Space Center'''. Located in the College of Engineering and Computer Science, the Center specializes in digital imaging research and development for use in both government and commercial applications in the areas of [[medical technology]], [[surveillance]], [[communications]], [[education]], [[inspection]], [[observation|scientific observation]], [[manufacturing]], visual recognition and identification, and [[motion picture]] and [[digital video]]. Within the Imaging Technology Center is one of 12 NASA Research Partnership Centers throughout the nation which develops dual-use research and development with the participation of NASA and other related industries in the U.S. The center occupies two sets of laboratories and administrative offices on Florida Atlantic’s main campus in Boca Raton and at the Fort Lauderdale Tower campus. The Imaging Technology Center is developing a [[curriculum]] for [[digital imaging]] and processing, and is establishing FAU as the only university in the nation to offer this technical concentration—a highly valuable resource for [[national defense]] and the medical and video industries. [http://wise.fau.edu/research/centers.php#IMAGING]

====Medical====
In 2004, FAU launched a medical school program in conjunction with the [[University of Miami]] (UM). Medical students spend the first two years of their education at the Boca Raton campus before transferring to [[Miami]] for rotations and receiving their degree from UM. On June 28, 2006, Florida Atlantic and [[Boca Raton Community Hospital]] approved an agreement between the two institutions to implement a land lease for the development and operation of a community-university affiliated teaching hospital. 

The hospital will serve as the primary teaching hospital for the regional campus of the [[Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine|UM Miller School of Medicine]] at FAU.  Facility construction is expected to begin in [[2008]] with completion by [[2011]]. Approximately 38 acres of Florida Atlantic land, located on the southeast corner of FAU’s Boca Raton campus, will host the [[infrastructure]] for the teaching hospital. This will enable medical students to complete their entire education at Florida Atlantic's Boca Raton campus. The private room, 530-bed hospital will provide FAU facilities and resources to support [[undergraduate]] and [[Graduate school|graduate]] medical education programs customary to primary teaching hospitals within major academic medical centers.  The facilities will include resident/student conference rooms, a [[conference]] center with teleconferencing capabilities including an [[auditorium]] and small group conference rooms, resident sleeping quarters with lockers, resident dining facilities, a resident lounge, a medical [[library]] with state-of-the-art [[Information technology|IT]] systems and increased square footage in other areas of the hospital to accommodate students and residents.

[[Image:Florida_Atlantic_University_op_800x578.jpg|right|thumb|FAU Athletics Logo]]
The Boca Raton campus was designated a [[burrowing owl]] sanctuary in [[1971]], by the [[Audubon Society]]. The owl prefers the campus because there are not many predators other than cats, near the [[Boca Raton Airport]]. The feisty bird, traditionally associated with wisdom and determination, serves as the University's mascot.

A 2001 report by the [[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy]] found that students from the FAU College of Business' School of Accounting ranked seventh among all colleges and universities nationwide based on the percentage of candidates passing all four subjects of the [[Certified Public Accountant]] examination. In 1998, Florida Atlantic graduate Mindy Tyson placed first in the United States in the CPA exams and was awarded the Gold Medal.
