'''Super Typhoon Paka''' ('''Super Typhoon Rubing''' [[PAGASA]]) was an extraordinarily powerful [[tropical cyclone]] that caused extensive damage in the southern [[Mariana Islands]] (including [[Guam]]) in December of [[1997]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Paka 1997 track.png}}
Paka was tracked as a tropical disturbance near [[Hawaii]] before advisories were issued on December 2 to upgrade it to Tropical Depression Five-C. The system strengthened and was named Tropical Storm Paka, the Hawaiian Name for Pat, on the afternoon of December 2 when sustained winds were estimated to be 35 knots. Paka moved westward, crossing the [[International Date Line]], and strengthening as it did.  It continued moving westward, still strengthening.  On [[December 15]], the storm reached its peak in intensity, with sustained winds of about 185 miles per hour, as a category 5 super typhoon.

The storm continued moving west, weakening to 160 mph as it approached the island of Guam. Paka's southern eyewall slammed into Guam on [[December 16]].  By landfall, the storm had decreased in intensity yet again, this time to 150 mph (240 km/h). The storm continued moving west and eventually moved into an unfavorable environment for development.  The storm completely dissipated on [[December 22]].

==Impact==
Loss of life on Guam was minimized due to a wide use of reinforced concrete in residential construction, strict building codes, and public shelters for those without adequate homes.  Infrastructure and property damage, however, was catastrophic.

A gust caused by Super Typhoon Paka over Guam was recorded at 236 mph (380 km/h); however, this reading had to be discarded, since the [[anemometer]] was damaged by the storm. Had it been confirmed, this would be the strongest non-tornadic wind ever recorded at the [[Earth]]'s surface. (The current record is held by a non-hurricane wind registering 231 mph (372 km/h) at [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] in [[New Hampshire]].)
