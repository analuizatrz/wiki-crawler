The '''Kingdom of Asturias''' was the first [[Christianity|Christian]] political entity to be established in the [[Iberian peninsula]] after the collapse of the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Kingdom. This followed the defeat of [[Monarch|King]] [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]] and the subsequent [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Islamic conquest of Hispania]].

==Establishment==
[[Image:Don Pelayo.jpg|thumb|left|200ppx|Monument in memory of Pelayo in [[Covadonga]]]]The kingdom was established by a  nobleman, [[Pelayo]] who had returned to his country after the [[Battle of Guadalete]], where he became elected leader of the [[Astures]] and founded the Kingdom of Asturias. However, Pelayo's kingdom initially was little more than a banner for the existing guerilla forces. 

Under his leadership, the attacks on the [[Berber people|Berbers]] increased. In [[722]] (or possibly in [[724]] or as early as [[718]]), the [[Emir]] sent a force led by [[Munuza]] to quell this rebellion and establish [[Moors|Moorish]] control of the region. This force was defeated in the valley of [[Battle of Covadonga]]. The most commonly accepted hypothesis for this battle (epic as described by [[Christian]] chronicles, but a mere skirmish in [[Muslim]] texts) is that the Moorish column was attacked from the cliffs and then fell back through the valleys towards present day [[Gijón]], but was attacked whilst in retreat by the retinue and nearly destroyed. After this first battle, the Astures grew stronger. Once he had expelled the Moors from the eastern valleys of Asturias, Pelayo attacked [[León, Spain|León]], the main city in the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula and secured the mountain passes, isolating the region from Moorish attack.

Pelayo continued attacking those Berbers which remained north of the Asturian Mountains until they withdrew. He then married his son [[Favila of Asturias|Favila]] to Duke [[Peter of Cantabria]]’s daughter, a descendant of the former Astur dynasty. 

Pelayo founded a dynasty in Asturias that survived for centuries and gradually expanded the kingdom's boundaries until all of northwest Iberia was included by roughly [[775]]. The reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]] from [[791]]-[[842]] saw further expansion of the kingdom to the south, almost as far as [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].

==Recognition==
It was not until King [[Alfonso II of Asturias]] (791-842), that the kingdom was firmly established with Alfonso's recognition as king of Asturias by [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Pope]]. He conquered [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basques]]. During his reign, the holy bones of [[James the Great|St. James the Great]] were declared to be found in Galicia, at [[Santiago de Compostela]] (from Latin campus stellae, literally "the field of the star"). Pilgrims from all over [[Europe]] opened a way of communication between the isolated Asturias and the [[Carolingian]] lands and beyond.

The first capital city was [[Cangas de Onís]]. Then, in [[Silo of Asturias|Silo's]] time, it was moved to [[Pravia]]. Alfonso II chose [[Oviedo]] as the definite capital of the Kingdom. The kingdom was known as Asturias until [[924]], when it became the [[Kingdom of León]]. It continued under that name until incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]] in [[1230]], after [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III]] became joint king of the two kingdoms.

==Legacy==
The Kingdom of Asturias was, in its infancy, an indigenous reaction of [[Astur|Astures]] and [[Cantabri]] peoples to a foreign invasion. Those people had fought hard against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] of the Ancient Ages, and resisted partially to [[Romanisation]] (although it was deep - in fact, the [[Celtic languages]] were lost). Thus, they conserved part of its pre-Roman features, such as [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] [[inheritance]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, and a certain amount of [[social equality]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. However, when [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] influence of the people who migrated to the Christian Kingdom of the North grew, Feudalism settled up in Asturias. 

This kingdom is the birthplace of one of the most outstanding European [[Medieval architecture|Medieval Architectural styles]]: Asturian [[Preromanesque]]. This style of Architecture was largely founded by [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]].

This small kingdom was a milestone in the fight against [[Adoptionist]] [[heresy]], with [[Beatus of Liébana]] as a major figure. In the time of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]], the shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela|Santiago]] was "found." The pilgrimage to Santiago, [[Camino de Santiago]], was a nexus within Europe, and many pilgrims (and their money) passed through Asturias on their way to Santiago de Compostela.
