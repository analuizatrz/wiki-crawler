'''The Great Shamokin Path''' (also known as the "Shamokin Path") was a major [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[trail]] in the [[U.S. State]] of [[Pennsylvania]] that ran from the [[Saponi village of Shamokin]] (modern day [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]]) along the [[left bank]] of the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]] north and then west to the Great Island (near modern day [[Lock Haven, Pennsylvania|Lock Haven]]). There it left the river and continued further west to Chinklacamoose (what is now the borough of [[Clearfield]]) and finally [[Kittanning]]. It was once the [[Rural Valley Railroad]].

The Great Shamokin Path connected the [[Susquehanna River]] with the [[Allegheny River]] (and the [[Ohio River]] downstream of Kittanning). For several decades in the early 1700s the villages of Shamokin and Kittanning were two of the most important Native American villages in Pennsylvania. 

Perhaps the path's best known use was by [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] [[Bishop]] Ettwein and his group of some 200 [[Lenape]] and [[Mohican]] [[Christian]]s in 1772. They traveled west along the path from their village of Friedensh√ºtten (''Cabins of Peace'') near modern [[Wyalusing, Pennsylvania|Wyalusing]] on the North Branch of the Susquehanna to their new village of Friedensstadt (''City of Peace'') on the [[Beaver River]] in southwestern Pennsylvania.

==Geography==
The village of Shamokin was just south of the "forks of the Susquehanna", the [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the [[Susquehanna River]] (also known as the North Branch). From there, the Great Shamokin Path headed north and [[ford (crossing)|forded]] the river to current [[Northumberland, Pennsylvania|Northumberland]], then went along the left bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River to the [[Shawnee]] town of Chillisquaque on [[Chillisquaque Creek]]. The path continued north through what are now [[Milton, Pennsylvania|Milton]] and [[Watsontown, Pennsylvania|Watsontown]], where the path forked into two branches, both leading to Canaserage on [[Muncy Creek]] (today [[Muncy, Pennsylvania|Muncy]]). 

At Canaserage the river and path turned west, but there were at least two other paths that led northeast: the [[Wyalusing Path]] (along Muncy Creek to [[Wyalusing, Pennsylvania|Wyalusing]]); and the [[Towanda Path]] (to [[Towanda, Pennsylvania|Towanda]]), both on the North Branch of the Susquehanna River.

The Great Shamokin Path led west to the village of Otstonwakin (now [[Montoursville, Pennsylvania|Montoursville]]) on [[Loyalsock Creek]] and then to French Margaret's Town (now western [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]]) on [[Lycoming Creek]]. The [[Sheshequin Path]] led north along Lycoming Creek to Sheshequin (now [[Ulster, Pennsylvania|Ulster]]) on the North Branch Susuqhehanna River. Further west the path went through the village of Quenashawakee, forded [[Larrys Creek]] and [[Pine Creek (Pennsylvania)|Pine Creek]] and came to the Great Island, (now just east of [[Lock Haven, Pennsylvania|Lock Haven]]).

The Great Island was an important crossroads with paths leading in many directions. The Great Shamokin Path left the river here (which turns north) to continue west along [[Bald Eagle Creek (West Branch Susquehanna River)|Bald Eagle Creek]], fording Beech Creek and following Marsh Creek and Little Marsh Creek to its end. Then it climbed the [[Allegheny Front]] to modern day [[Snow Shoe, Pennsylvania|Show Shoe]] and on to Moshannon, where there were two branches possible to Kylertown. The branches differed in their fords of [[Black Moshannon Creek]] and [[Moshannon Creek]], both of which were difficult to cross. From Kylertown the path continued west, fording [[Clearfield Creek]] before reaching Chinklacamoose (now [[Clearfield, Pennsylvania|Clearfield]]).

At Chinklacamoose the Great Shamokin Path rejoined the West Branch Susquehanna River and followed it west seven miles to [[Curwensville, Pennsylvania]] and [[Anderson Creek]]. Several crossings of the Susquehanna were needed to avoid thickets of [[mountain laurel]] bushes here. The path then followed Anderson Creek a few miles, left it to go west to what is now Chestnut Grove, and then on to the Big Spring (now Luthersburg). There Mead's Path left to go northwest to [[Venango, Pennsylvania|Venango]], while the Great Shamokin Path ran southwest and followed tributaries of and [[Mahoning Creek]] to [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania|Punxsutawney]]. Here the path's course is less clear, but it left Mahoning Creek to eventually follow [[Cowanshannock Creek]] to Kittanning and the Allegheny River.<ref name="path">{{cite book
