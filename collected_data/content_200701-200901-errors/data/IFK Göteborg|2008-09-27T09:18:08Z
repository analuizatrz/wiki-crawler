'''IFK Göteborg''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] professional [[Football (soccer)|football club]] based in [[Gothenburg]]. The club is often referred to simply as '''IFK''', although this can be confusing as there are many other clubs in Sweden who use [[IFK|the abbreviation]] as part of their name. IFK Göteborg, formed on [[4 October]] [[1904]], have won 18 national championship titles, five national cup titles, and two [[UEFA Cup]]s.

With [[Malmö FF]] and [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], IFK Göteborg are often considered part of the "Big Three" in Swedish club football, who have 43 championship titles between them. IFK is arguably the most successful club in Sweden, and perhaps in [[Scandinavia]], as it is the only Scandinavian team to have won a pan-European competition. IFK won the [[UEFA Cup]] in [[UEFA Cup 1981-82|1982]] and [[UEFA Cup 1986-87|1987]]. They currently rank in the highest Swedish league, [[Allsvenskan]], where they have played for the majority of their history. They have played top flight football in Sweden since [[1977 in Swedish football|1977]], which currently is the longest top flight tenure of any club in Sweden&mdash;the next longest is [[Helsingborgs IF]] and [[Halmstads BK]], since 1993.

IFK is one of the most popular football clubs in Sweden, with diverse country-wide support. They have played most of their home games at [[Gamla Ullevi]] stadium, and some at the larger [[Ullevi]] stadium. The former pitch was torn down in 2007 and a new stadium, [[Nya Gamla Ullevi]], is under construction and will host IFK as of 2009.

== History ==
{{main|History of IFK Göteborg}}
IFK Göteborg was founded at Café Olivedal on [[4 October]] [[1904]],<ref name="nylin47">Nylin, p. 47.</ref> becoming the 39th [[Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna|IFK association]].<ref name="jonsson9">Jönsson, p. 9.</ref> A committee for [[Football (soccer)|football]] was created at the historic first meeting; the association's first football match ended in a 4&ndash;1 victory against a club from the local area, [[IK Viking]].<ref name="jonsson10">Jönsson, p. 10.</ref> The foundation of IFK Göteborg was important for the development of [[Football (soccer)|football]] in the city, as until that point, [[Örgryte IS]], the largest of Gothenburg clubs, were dominant. IFK Göteborg represented some needed competition.<ref name="jonsson1113">Jönsson, pp. 11&ndash;13.</ref>

IFK Göteborg became the first Swedish team in four years to beat Örgryte IS in 1907.<ref name="jonsson13">Jönsson, p. 13.</ref> They then went on to win their first [[Swedish football champions|Swedish Championship]] in [[1908 in Swedish football|1908]] by winning the cup tournament [[Svenska Mästerskapet]], and three players from the club were selected to play for [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in the national team's first match.<ref name="jonsson13" /> That year IFK played teams from outside Sweden for the first time, meeting the Danish clubs [[Østerbro BK]] and [[Boldklubben af 1893]].<ref name="jonsson13" />

In 1910 the team played in blue and white striped jerseys for the first time.<ref name="jonsson19">Jönsson, p. 19.</ref> Two years later the team drew 1&ndash;1 in a game against the 1912 Swedish Olympic team, and the newspapers in [[Stockholm]] nominated IFK Göteborg as "the best Swedish football club ever".<ref name="jonsson20">Jönsson, p. 20.</ref> IFK Göteborg won [[Svenska Serien]]&mdash;the highest Swedish league at the time, but not the Swedish Championship deciding competition&mdash;for the fifth time in a row in [[1916-17 in Swedish football|1917]]. The early IFK Göteborg team had no trainer; the club gained its first such official in 1921, when [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Alexander Brody (manager)|Alexander Brody]] was hired.<ref name="jonsson25">Jönsson, p. 25.</ref> Brody was appointed manager for IFK two years later. The first Swedish official national league, [[Allsvenskan]], started in late [[1924-25 in Swedish football|1924]], the year the legendary [[Filip Johansson|Filip 'Svarte-Filip' Johansson]] made his debut for IFK Göteborg.<ref name="glanell108">Glanell, p. 108.</ref> The club finished second, but 'Svarte-Filip' scored 39 goals in 22 games and was the league's top goalscorer.<ref name="nylin48">Nylin, p. 48.</ref>

IFK won their first Allsvenskan title in [[1934-35 in Swedish football|1934&ndash;35]], having gained eight silver and bronze medals since the league start eleven years earlier. Swedish football was dominated by teams from [[Gothenburg]] during the first ten years of Allsvenskan,<ref name="glanell99101">Glanell, pp. 98&ndash;101.</ref> but IFK Göteborg were surprisingly relegated in [[1937-38 in Swedish football|1937&ndash;38]],<ref name="nylin49">Nylin, p. 49.</ref> although the team was promoted back to Allsvenskan the next season. Back in the highest division, IFK finished second, with the league continuing despite the breakout of [[World War II]]. IFK won another title in [[1941-42 in Swedish football|1941&ndash;42]] with a strong team,<ref name="nylin49" /> but the rest of the decade saw mixed results. The 1940s team included the talented [[Gunnar Gren]], who became the top scorer in [[1946-47 in Swedish football|1946&ndash;47]]. He was also awarded [[Guldbollen]] as the best player in Sweden, and won an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal with the Swedish team at the [[Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics|1948 games]].<ref name="jonsson55">Jönsson, p. 55.</ref> When Gren left in 1949, IFK were relegated from [[Allsvenskan]] the following season. As happened the last time IFK played in a lower league, they were promoted directly back to Allsvenskan after one season in [[Division 2]]. IFK went on to compete in a European cup&mdash;the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup]]&mdash;for the first time in 1958, but were eliminated in the second round by [[FC Erzgebirge Aue|SC Wismut]]. In [[1959 in Swedish football|1959]] the all-time Allsvenskan record attendance of 52,194 was set when IFK played [[Örgryte IS]] at [[Ullevi|Nya Ullevi]].<ref name="sfs">{{cite web |title=Högsta och lägsta publiksiffror i Allsvenskan |url=http://www.bolletinen.se/sfs/allsvenskan/toppublik.pdf |format=PDF| publisher=Sveriges Fotbollshistoriker och Statistiker |date=2004 |accessdate=2007-06-20}} {{sv icon}}</ref>

After an unglamorous decade, IFK were led by manager and former player [[Bertil Johansson|Bertil 'Bebben' Johansson]] to a surprising championship title in [[1969 in Swedish football|1969]].<ref name="nylin49" /> The following season was one of the darkest in their history.<ref name="nylin49" /><ref name="jonsson88">Jönsson, p. 88.</ref> IFK were relegated, and unlike previous relegations they did not make an immediate return. After three seasons in the second league IFK had lost all signs of being a team from Allsvenskan,<ref name="jonsson99">Jönsson, p. 99.</ref> and had still not managed to gain promotion. But after hard work from board member [[Anders Bernmar]] and others to get the club on the right track, IFK were promoted to Allsvenskan in [[1976 in Swedish football|1976]].<ref name="jonsson99" /> In 1979, IFK hired [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] as manager.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sven-Göran Eriksson |date=2006 |publisher=The Football Association |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/Coaches/Postings/2003/09/SvenCoach.htm |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> He introduced the [[Formation (football)#4-4-2|4-4-2]] system with "pressure and support"&mdash;called the [[Swenglish]] model<ref name="offsidetoken">{{cite web |title=Bakgrundsfakta till Token från Torsby |date=2006 |url=http://www.offside.org/index.cfm?templateID=3&pageID=4&action=readFullArticle&articleID=85&issueID=37 |publisher=Offside |accessdate=2007-07-13}} {{sv icon}}</ref>&mdash;which would give IFK great success later on, and his first season at the club ended with a second place in Allsvenskan and the club's first gold medal in [[Svenska Cupen]].

[[Image:Ifk goteborg osk.jpg|thumb|280px|left|IFK Göteborg and their fans celebrate a goal against [[Örebro SK]] in 2004.]]

After reinforcing the team with several expensive players<ref name="jonsson109">Jönsson, p. 109.</ref>&mdash;including [[Thomas Wernerson]] and [[Stig Fredriksson]]&mdash;IFK had finished second in the league and reached the quarter-finals in the [[UEFA Cup]] as 1981 came to an end. [[1982 in Swedish football|1982]] then became a turbulent season as the whole board was replaced and the club almost went [[bankrupt]]&mdash;even needing to borrow money from the official supporter's association to travel to [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] to play the quarter-final of the UEFA Cup.<ref name="jonsson110111">Jönsson, p.p 110&ndash;111.</ref> After the troubled start IFK won every competition they entered, including Allsvenskan, the Allsvenskan play-off, Svenska Cupen, and the UEFA Cup, defeating [[Hamburger SV]] 4&ndash;0 on aggregate in the finals.<ref name="1977-89">{{cite web |last=Jönsson |first=Ingemar |title=IFK Göteborg: 1977-89 |date=2003 |url=http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/portal/page?_pageid=113,61271&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |publisher=IFK Göteborg |accessdate=2007-07-13}} {{sv icon}}</ref> During the following 15 years the club was the leading club in Swedish football,<ref name="nylin50">Nylin, p. 50.</ref> winning the Swedish championship ten times, the domestic cup three times and the UEFA Cup twice.

IFK managed to field a strong team for a couple of years and won gold in the league in both [[1983 in Swedish football|1983]] and [[1984 in Swedish football|1984]], and the cup in 1983. In [[1986 in Swedish football|1986]], the team reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] but were defeated on penalties against [[FC Barcelona]].<ref name="cresswell">{{cite web |last=Cresswell |first=Peterjon |title=Magazine: Gothenburg |date=2003 |url=http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/Kind=64/newsId=62730.html |publisher=uefa.com |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> A new team of talents won both the UEFA Cup and Allsvenskan once again in 1987,<ref name="1977-89" /> after beating [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] in the UEFA Cup final. The junior coach [[Roger Gustafsson]] took over the team from [[Gunder Bengtsson]] in 1990, and his time with IFK was to become very successful, winning Allsvenskan five times between 1990 and 1995.<ref name="jonsson321">Jönsson, p. 321.</ref>

As IFK won the [[1993 in Swedish football|1993]] Allsvenskan they qualified for European competition. IFK advanced to the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League]], where they faced [[FC Barcelona]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray]]. Elimination at the group stage was widely anticipated,<ref name="nittiotalet">{{cite web |author=M.H. |title=Nittiotalet är över - men minnena består |date=1999 |url=http://www2.svenskafans.com/ifkgoteborg/artiklar/nittiotalet.asp |publisher=Alltid Blåvitt |accessdate=2007-06-20}} {{sv icon}}</ref><ref name="gp941231">{{cite news |last=Guslen |first=Bertil |title=Blåvitt 1994 var mästarlaget som fick Europa att se rött |date=[[1994-12-31]] |publisher=[[Göteborgs-Posten]]}}</ref> but IFK Göteborg confounded expectations by winning the group and advancing to the knockout stage. However, IFK Göteborg was eliminated in the quarter-finals by [[Bayern Munich]] on the [[away goals rule]].

The last years before the new millennium were disappointing for IFK, providing a stark contrast to the earlier success.<ref name="1996-2000">{{cite web |last=Jönsson |first=Ingemar |title=IFK Göteborg: 1996-00 |date=2003 |url=http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/portal/page?_pageid=113,61275&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |publisher=IFK Göteborg |accessdate=2007-06-20}} {{sv icon}}</ref> The team only managed a silver in 1997 and an eighth place in 1998, after buying several expensive players who failed to produce.<ref name="1996-2000" /><ref name="jonsson153">Jönsson, p. 153.</ref> IFK changed manager in the middle of a season two years in a row&mdash;in [[1998 in Swedish football|1998]] and [[1999 in Swedish football|1999]]&mdash;when the club never before had changed manager even once during an ongoing season.<ref name="1996-2000" /> The last year of the decade ended with a sixth place finish. The new millennium offered varied results, with the club playing a relegation play-off in 2002, but challenging for the championship in 2001, 2004, and 2005. And in 2007, the first title in eleven years was secured in the last round of Allsvenskan. The club then won the national cup [[Svenska Cupen]] the next season. IFK Göteborg are still considered to be one of the "Big Three" in Swedish football, along with [[Malmö FF]] and [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], despite only having won two titles in the last ten years.<ref name="cresswell" /><ref name="nylin102747">Nylin, pp. 10, 27 & 47.</ref>

== Colours and crest ==
The traditional colours of all [[Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna|IFK associations]] are blue and white, and IFK Göteborg is no exception. The club's first kit was a blue jersey with a single horizontal white stripe and a four-pointed star, one of the IFK association symbols, in white on the chest.<ref name="jonsson11">Jönsson, p. 11.</ref> The next few years white or blue jerseys without stripes were used. In 1910, a kit comprising a blue and white vertically striped jersey and blue shorts was used for the first time.<ref name="jonsson19">Jönsson, p. 19.</ref> This kit has remained as the home colours ever since. A blue and white logotype of the main sponsor [[ICA AB|ICA]]&mdash;a grocery store chain&mdash;has figured on the jersey front since 1982,<ref name="jonsson304">Jönsson, p. 304.</ref> and has almost become part of the jersey.<ref name="jonsson177178">Jönsson, pp. 177&ndash;178.</ref><ref name="vlt041206">{{cite news |title=Juve, Inter, Milan - och VSK |url=http://www.vlt.se/artikelmall.asp?version=118460 |date=[[2004-12-06]] |publisher=[[Vestmanlands Läns Tidning]] |accessdate=2007-06-20}} {{sv icon}}</ref> No other major sponsors are seen on the kit which, together with the long time use, has made the kit a classic in Swedish football.<ref name="vlt041206" /> The traditional away kit is red and white, in different styles, though other colour combinations, for example orange and white, have been used, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s. The away kit introduced in 2005 once again uses red and white. An almost completely white third kit with blue details was introduced in mid-2007 after requests from supporters.<ref name="helvitt">{{cite web |last=Ericson |first=Tomas |title=Blåvitt spelar i helvitt imorgon |date=[[2007-06-11]] |url=http://www.svenskafans.com/fotboll/ifkgoteborg/artikel.asp?id=175704 |publisher=Alltid Blåvitt |accessdate=2007-06-20}} {{sv icon}}</ref>

The crest of IFK Göteborg has its origins in the [[coat-of-arms]] of the city of [[Gothenburg]] which in turn is based on several other [[heraldic]] arms. The lion on a field of silver and blue is the heraldic arms of the [[Folkung|Folkungaätt]], holding the [[Three Crowns]] of [[Sweden]], both symbols being used in the [[Coat of Arms of Sweden]]. This arm was granted to the city by [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]].<ref name="stadsvapen">{{cite web |title=Stadsvapnets historia |date=[[2007-05-04]] |url=http://www.goteborg.se/prod/sk/goteborg.nsf/1/om_goteborg,stadsvapnets_historia?OpenDocument |publisher=Göteborgs Stad |accessdate=2007-07-13}} {{sv icon}}</ref> The coat-of-arms of Gothenburg sees the lion facing the sinister (heraldic right) side which often is interpreted as a fleeing lion, the normal being a lion facing the dexter (left) side, but IFK chose to have the lion facing dexter on the club crest. Adding the three letters [[IFK]] on top and the crest used since it first appeared on the kit in 1919 is complete.<ref name="jonsson241">Jönsson, p. 241.</ref>

== Stadium ==
{{see also|Gamla Ullevi|Ullevi|Nya Gamla Ullevi}}
[[Image:Gamla ullevi ifkgot wolfsbu.jpg|right|thumb|[[Gamla Ullevi]] seen from north-west.]]

Historically, IFK Göteborg's main home stadium has been [[Gamla Ullevi]], where the majority of the competitive games have been played. The club has played there in two separate periods, most recently after leaving [[Ullevi]] (Nya Ullevi) in 1992, although matches attracting large crowds&mdash;such as [[local derby|derbies]] against the rivals [[Örgryte IS]] and [[GAIS]], or international games&mdash;were still played at the larger Ullevi stadium. Gamla Ullevi's capacity was 18,000 when used in the 1990s and 2000s, while Nya Ullevi has a capacity of 43,200.<ref name="gamlaullevi">{{cite web |title=IFK Göteborg: Gamla Ullevi |date=2006 |url=http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/portal/page?_pageid=113,64384&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&element_id=70288 |publisher=IFK Göteborg |accessdate=2007-06-21}} {{sv icon}}</ref><ref name="ullevi">{{cite web |title=IFK Göteborg: Ullevi |date=2006 |url=http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/portal/page?_pageid=113,61281&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |publisher=IFK Göteborg |accessdate=2007-06-21}} {{sv icon}}</ref>

Gamla Ullevi was demolished on [[9 January]] [[2007]] to make place for a new stadium, [[Nya Gamla Ullevi]], with a capacity of 18,000. The new stadium will be completed in late 2008, but not opened until the start of the [[2009 in Swedish football|2009 season]]. During construction, IFK Göteborg will play the [[2007 in Swedish football|2007]] and [[2008 in Swedish football|2008 seasons]] at Nya Ullevi.<ref name="gp070109">{{cite news |author=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå|TT]] |title=Rivningen av Gamla Ullevi igång |publisher=[[Göteborgs-Posten]] |date=2007-01-09 |url=http://www.gp.se/gp/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=128&a=318111 |accessdate=2007-05-04}} {{sv icon}}</ref>

IFK Göteborg have used three other stadiums as official home grounds. The first ground was [[Idrottsplatsen]], in use from 1905 to 1916. It was built in 1896 for the cycling club Göteborgs Velocipedklubb, and was originally used for [[track cycling]]. During the [[1909 in Swedish football|1909 season]] IFK Göteborg also used [[Örgryte IS]]' home ground of the time, [[Balders Hage]], due to a conflict with the owners of Idrottsplatsen.<ref name="jonsson44">Jönsson, p. 44.</ref> The third official stadium was [[Walhalla IP|Walhalla Idrottsplats]], used for a number of home matches at the same time as Idrottsplatsen. A fourth ground, [[Slottsskogsparken]], has never been the official home ground, but has nonetheless been used a number of times for IFK Göteborg home matches.<ref name="jonsson4647">Jönsson, pp. 46&ndash;47.</ref>

Idrottsplatsen fell into decline due to poor leadership and a troubled economy in the 1910s,<ref name="jonsson43">Jönsson, p. 43.</ref> and a decision was made to completely renovate the arena with the help of outside sponsorship and funding. The construction of the new football ground was started in 1915 and used the site of Idrottsplatsen as foundation. The new stadium, originally named Ullervi,<ref name="jonsson45">Jönsson, p. 45.</ref> but later changed to Ullevi and finally Gamla Ullevi, was opened in 1916. It was the home ground of IFK Göteborg until 1958, when Nya Ullevi&mdash;built for the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] held in Sweden&mdash;was opened. Due to a number of seasons with low attendance in Swedish football in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a move back to Gamla Ullevi was made in 1992.<ref name="jonsson46">Jönsson, p. 46.</ref>

== Supporters ==
{{see also|Supporterklubben Änglarna}}
Before the foundation of IFK Göteborg, the dominant club in the Gothenburg area was [[Örgryte IS]], which was considered a [[middle class]] club, and in later years an [[upper class]] club, like most clubs of that time. IFK became popular amongst the [[working class]], creating a fierce rivalry based upon both local pride and [[social class]]. In the early 20th century, supporters were supposed to act as gentlemen, applauding and supporting both their own team, and the opponents. However, this proved a hard task for supporters of the Gothenburg teams. Local patriotism and class differences sometimes resulted in fights and pitch invasions, making the Swedish press view IFK and Örgryte fans as the scum of Swedish football.<ref name="jonsson190">Jönsson, p. 190.</ref>

After the [[First World War]], the rivalry calmed, and Gothenburg supporters became known as friendly and sportsmanlike fans. However, this only applied to the behaviour on home ground, as IFK supporters continued to behave badly when travelling to away matches by train (called ''göteborgstågen'', the Gothenburg trains), a phenomenon that grew quickly in the 1920s. This behaviour peaked in 1939, just after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], when approximately 1,900 IFK fans travelled to [[Borås]] to see IFK play [[IF Elfsborg]]. After a 2&ndash;3 loss, the fans fought with the Borås police, before returning home to Gothenburg and disturbing a [[Blackout (wartime)|wartime blackout]] exercise.<ref name="jonsson190">Jönsson, p. 190.</ref>

[[Image:Ifk goteborg supporters.jpg|thumb|280px|left|IFK Göteborg supporters at the home derby against [[Örgryte IS]] in 2005.]]

As in most other parts of the world, the decades following the Second World War were relatively free from football violence and the supporter culture did not change much. Swedish football culture started to change in the late 1960s, becoming heavily inspired and influenced by the [[England|English]] supporter culture. This flourished in the 1970s and 1980s, giving birth to some of the most well-known Swedish supporters clubs, [[AIK]]'s Black Army, [[Djurgårdens IF]]'s [[Blue Saints]] (later [[Järnkaminerna]]), and IFK Göteborg's supporters club, [[Supporterklubben Änglarna|Änglarna]] (the Angels). The first attempt to found an IFK supporters club was made in 1969, but interest diminished when IFK Göteborg were relegated from the highest league the following year. The supporters club was not re-founded until 1973, which is considered the year of foundation of Änglarna.<ref name="johansson">{{cite web |last=Johansson |first=Andreas |title=Historik |date=2004 |url=http://www.anglarna.se/?page=0106 |publisher=Änglarna.se |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref>

As the club gained success in European club tournaments in the 1980s and 1990s, and thousands of IFK fans travelled to [[Hamburg]], [[Barcelona]], [[Dundee]], [[Milan]], [[Manchester]] and [[Munich]], the supporters gained influence on the club, for example by loaning money to the almost [[bankrupt]] IFK Göteborg so the team could go to Barcelona to play the semi-final in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1986, or by being the main force behind the move back to Gamla Ullevi in 1992.<ref name="jonsson110111" /><ref name="jonsson191912">Jönsson, pp. 191&ndash;192.</ref> The early 1990s saw a downward trend in attendance numbers, even though the club was successful on the pitch, but the trend turned in the later years of the decade and the first few years of the new millennium brought the club's highest average attendance since the early 1980s.<ref name="jonsson344345">Jönsson, pp. 344&ndash;345.</ref>

In the 2000s, supporter culture in Sweden started to shift from being English-influenced to being more influenced by the [[Southern Europe]]an countries and their football culture, making [[tifo]]s and [[ultras]] a common sight in Swedish arenas. From acting as an almost uniform group of fans gathered under the same flag, the supporter club Änglarna, IFK fans created separate supporter factions, including Ultra Bulldogs, Young Lions and West Coast Angelz. IFK is the most popular football club in Sweden;<ref name="cresswell" /> a 2004 survey concluded that IFK Göteborg had support from 13% of Swedish football fans.<ref name="cefossom">{{cite paper |author=CEFOS/SOM-Institutet |title=Svenska fotbollssupportrar |publisher=[[Göteborg University]] |date=[[2004-04-27]]}}</ref> A majority, 55%, of football fans in Gothenburg support IFK, and the club is the fourth most popular in [[Stockholm]] (after AIK, Djurgårdens IF and [[Hammarby IF]]) and the second most popular in [[Malmö]], after [[Malmö FF]].<ref name="cefossom" />
