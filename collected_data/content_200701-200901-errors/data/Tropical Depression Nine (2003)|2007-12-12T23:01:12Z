'''Tropical Depression Nine''' was a weak tropical depression that developed and dissipated in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]] in August of [[2003]]. It formed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[August 21]] to the south of [[Puerto Rico]], and was initially forecast to strengthen to tropical storm status, due to the [[tropical cyclogenesis|favorable conditions for development]] in the area. However, [[wind shear]] developed over the system, and the depression degenerated to a tropical wave on [[August 22]]. The system produced moderate to heavy rainfall throughout its path, and damage was reported to a few houses in [[Martinique]] from severe [[rainfall]]. In Puerto Rico, the rains flooded 10&nbsp;houses, while in the [[Dominican Republic]] the precipitation led to overflown rivers and two injuries.

The depression quickly showed signs of organization with the development of [[rainbands|banding features]] around its blossoming convection.

==Preparations==
Coinciding with the issuance of the first advisory on the tropical depression, the government of the [[Dominican Republic]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Tropical Storm Watch|tropical storm watch]] from [[Barahona]] to its border with [[Haiti]], while a tropical storm watch was issued from Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic westward to [[Port-au-Prince]].

==Impact==

Before developing into Tropical Depression Nine, the precursor tropical wave dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the [[Lesser Antilles]], including 1.96&nbsp;inches (50&nbsp;mm) at [[Hewanorra International Airport]] in [[Saint Lucia]]. There, a peak wind gust of 33&nbsp;mph (53&nbsp;km/h) was reported. <ref name="st. lucia">{{cite web|author=Mike Davis|year=2003|title=Unofficial Reports from Saint Lucia|publisher=Stormcarib.com|accessdate=2006-10-24|url=http://www.stormcarib.com/reports/2003/stlucia.shtml}}</ref> In [[Barbados]], the system produced a 65 mph (105 km/h) wind gust at the top of a hotel, and heavy rainfall that resulted in flooding throughout the island. Several roads were covered with floodwaters, and many people caught in the deluge pulled off the road to wait for a break in the downpour. However, the precipitation was beneficial, as it was the first rainfall after two weeks of hot and dry conditions.<ref name="Barbados">{{cite web|author=Stormcarib.net|year=2003|title=Unofficial Reports from Barbados|accessdate=2006-10-24|url=http://www.stormcarib.com/reports/2003/barbados.shtml}}</ref> Heavy rainfall was also reported in [[Martinique]], which resulted in flooding and mudslides. The flooding downed several trees and closed roads in isolated locations. The flooding also damaged several houses, with some people losing everything.<ref name="martinique">{{cite web|author=Stormcarib.com|year=2003|title=Unofficial Reports from Martinique|accessdate=2006-10-24|url=http://www.stormcarib.com/reports/2003/martinique.shtml}}</ref>

The depression caused moderate rainfall in [[Puerto Rico]], where two to three inches (50 to 75&nbsp;mm) of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] were recorded.<ref name="ncdc2">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for Puerto Rico|accessdate=2006-10-24|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~529809}}</ref> The flooding from the rainfall entered 10&nbsp;houses.

The depression dropped over 1&nbsp;inch (25&nbsp;mm) of precipitation across much of the [[Dominican Republic]]; [[Santo Domingo]] reported a peak total of 3.9&nbsp;in (98&nbsp;mm). The rainfall led to flooding, primarily east and west of the capital city. Several roads were flooded, obstructing traffic. The flooding collapsed a sports center and a house, injuring two people inside. Further inland, 160&nbsp;people had to be evacuated when more than 100&nbsp;houses were flooded. Crop damage was also reported. In [[Pedernales, Dominican Republic|Pedernales]], gusty winds uprooted trees, several of which fell on power lines which caused power outages in the town. Five rivers overflowed their banks, as well.<ref name="wmo">{{cite web|author=World Meteorological Organization|year=2004|title=Final Report of the 2003 Hurricane Season|accessdate=2006-10-24|url=http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/TCP/Reports/HC26-English.pdf}}</ref> The rainfall was welcome in the country, as conditions were dry in the preceding months.<ref name="domrep"/> Flooding was also reported in eastern [[Jamaica]], though damage there, if any, is unknown.<ref name="wmo"/>
