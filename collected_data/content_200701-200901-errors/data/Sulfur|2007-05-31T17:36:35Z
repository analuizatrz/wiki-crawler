{{Infobox sulfur}}
'''Sulfur''' or '''sulphur''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/ˈsʌlfə(ɹ)/}}, [[#Spelling|see spelling below]]) is the [[chemical element]] that has the symbol '''S''' and [[atomic number]] 16. It is an abundant, tasteless, [[Valency (chemistry)|multivalent]] [[non-metal]].  Sulfur,  in its native form,  is a yellow crystalline solid.  In [[nature]],  it can be found as the pure element or as [[sulfide]] and [[sulfate]] minerals.  It is an essential element for life and is found in two [[amino acid]]s, [[cysteine]] and [[methionine]]. Its commercial uses are primarily in [[fertilizer]]s, but it is also widely used in [[gunpowder]], [[match]]es, [[insecticide]]s and [[fungicide]]s.

== Notable characteristics ==
[[Image:Burning-sulfur.png|thumb|left|Sulfur melts to a blood-red liquid. When burned, it emits a blue flame.]]
At room temperature, sulfur is a soft bright yellow solid.  Elemental sulfur has only a faint odor similar to that of [[matches]].  The odor associated with rotten eggs is from [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S) and organic sulfur compounds.  Sulfur burns with a blue flame that emits [[sulfur dioxide]], notable for its peculiar suffocating odor.  Sulfur is insoluble in water but [[solubility|soluble]] in [[carbon disulfide]] and to a lesser extent in other nonpolar organic solvents such as [[benzene]] and [[toluene]].  Common [[oxidation state]]s of sulfur include &minus;2, +2, +4 and +6.  Sulfur forms stable compounds with all elements except the [[noble gas]]es. 
Sulfur in the solid state ordinarily exists as cyclic crown-shaped S<sub>8</sub> molecules. Sulfur has many [[allotropy|allotrope]]s besides S<sub>8</sub>. Removing one atom from the crown gives S<sub>7</sub>, which is responsible for sulfur's distinctive yellow color. Many other rings have been prepared, including S<sub>12</sub> and S<sub>18</sub>. By contrast, its lighter neighbor [[oxygen]] only exists in two states of allotropic significance: O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. [[Selenium]], the heavier analogue of sulfur can form rings but is more often found as a polymer chain.

[[Image:Cyclooctasulfur-above-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|The structure of the cyclooctasulfur molecule, S<sub>8</sub>]]
The [[crystallography]] of sulfur is complex. Depending on the specific conditions, the sulfur [[allotrope]]s form several distinct [[crystal structure]]s, with '''[[rhombic]]''' and '''[[monoclinic]]''' S<sub>8</sub> best known.

A noteworthy property of sulfur is that its [[viscosity]] in its molten state, unlike most other liquids, increases above temperatures of 200°C due to the formation of [[polymer]] chains.  The molten sulfur also becomes dark red in colour above this temperature due to the presence of free valences on terminal atoms of the polymer chains.  However, after a specific temperature is reached, the viscosity is reduced because there is enough energy to break the chains.

[[Amorphous]] or "plastic" sulfur can be produced through the rapid cooling of molten sulfur. [[X-ray crystallography]] studies show that the amorphous form may have a [[helix|helical]] structure with eight atoms per turn. This form is [[Metastability in molecules|metastable]] at room temperature and gradually reverts back to crystalline form. This process happens within a matter of hours to days but can be rapidly catalyzed.

== Applications ==
In the late [[1700s]], [[furniture]] makers used molten sulfur to produce decorative [[inlay]]s in their craft.  Because of the [[sulfur dioxide]] produced during the process of melting sulfur, the craft of sulfur inlays was soon abandoned. Molten sulfur is sometimes still used for setting steel bolts into drilled concrete holes where high shock resistance is desired for floor-mounted equipment attachment points.  Pure powdered sulfur was also used as a medicinal tonic and laxative.

Sulfur has many modern industrial uses. Through its major derivative, [[sulfuric acid]] ([[hydrogen|H]]<sub>2</sub>S[[oxygen|O]]<sub>4</sub>), sulfur ranks as one of the most important industrial raw materials. It is of prime importance to every sector of the [[world economy|world's economies]].

Sulfuric acid production is the major route in industrial sulfur chemistry on the way to many end-uses, and production and consumption of sulfuric acid has been regarded as one of the best indices of a nation's industrial development.  [http://www.pafko.com/history/h_s_acid.html]. For example, more sulfuric acid is produced in the [[United States]] every year than any other industrial chemical; although interestingly the rate of increase of U.S. production has encountered shocks since the mid 1960's, mirroring U.S. loss of industrial post-[[World War II]] world influence. Principal uses for the acid include ore processing, fertilizer manufacturing, oil refining, wastewater processing, and chemical synthesis.

Sulfur is also used in [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[detergents]], the [[vulcanization]] of rubber, [[fungicide]]s, ie skin care soaps, and in the manufacture of [[phosphate]] fertilizers. [[Sulfite]]s are used to [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]] [[paper]] and as a preservative in [[wine]] and dried [[fruit]]. Because of its flammable nature, sulfur also finds use in [[match]]es, [[gunpowder]], and [[firework]]s. Sodium or ammonium [[sodium thiosulfate|thiosulfate]] is used as photographic fixing agents. [[Magnesium sulfate]], better known as [[Epsom salts]], can be used as a [[laxative]], a bath additive, an [[exfoliant]], a [[magnesium]] supplement for plants, or a [[desiccant]].  Sulfur is used as a light-generating medium in the rare lighting fixtures known as [[sulfur lamp]]s. Elemental sulfur crystals are commonly sought after by rock collectors for their brightly colored [[polyhedron]] shapes.

== Biological role ==
Sulfur is an essential component of all living [[cell (biology)|cells]]. 

Sulfur may also serve as chemical food source for some primitive organisms: some forms of [[bacterium|bacteria]] use [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S) in the place of water as the [[electron]] donor in a primitive [[photosynthesis]]-like process. Inorganic sulfur forms a part of [[iron-sulfur cluster]]s, and sulfur is the bridging ligand in the [[copper|Cu]]<sub>A</sub> site of [[cytochrome c oxidase]], a basic substance involved in utilization of oxygen by all aerobic life. 

Sulfur is absorbed by [[plant]]s via the [[root]]s from soil as the [[sulfate]] [[ion]] and reduced to sulfide before it is incorporated into [[cysteine]] and other organic sulfur compounds ([[sulfur assimilation]]).  

In [[plants]] and [[animals]] the [[amino acid]]s [[cysteine]] and [[methionine]] contain sulfur, as do all [[polypeptide]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[enzyme]]s which contain these amino acids. [[Homocysteine]] and [[taurine]] are other sulfur-containing acids which are similar in structure, but which are not coded for by [[DNA]], and are not part of the [[primary structure]] of proteins. [[Glutathione]] is an important sulfur-containing tripeptide which plays a role in cells as a source of chemical reduction potential in the cell, through its sulfhydryl (-SH) moiety. Many important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with -SH moieties to handle reactions involving acyl-containing biochemicals: two common examples from basic metabolism are [[coenzyme A]] and [[alpha-lipoic acid]]. 

[[Disulfide bond]]s (S-S bonds) formed between cysteine residues in peptide chains are very important in protein assembly and structure. These strong covalent bonds between peptide chains give proteins a great deal of extra toughness and resiliancy. For example, the high strength of feathers and hair is in part due to their high content of S-S bonds and their high content of cysteine and sulfur (eggs are high in sulfur because large amounts of the element are necessary for feather formation). The high disulfide content of hair and feathers also contributes to their indigestibility, and also their smelly odor when burned.

== Environmental impact ==
The burning of [[coal]] and/or [[petroleum]] by industry and [[power plants]] creates massive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] (S[[oxygen|O]]<sub>2</sub>) which reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce [[sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>).  This sulfuric acid is a component of [[acid rain]], which lowers the [[pH]] of [[soil]] and freshwater bodies, resulting in substantial damage to the [[natural environment]] and [[chemical weathering]] of statues and structures. Fuel standards increasingly require sulfur to be extracted from [[fossil fuel]]s to prevent the formation of acid rain. This extracted sulfur is then refined and represents a large portion of sulfur production.

== History ==
[[Image:Large Sulfur Crystal.jpg|thumb|left|Sulfur crystal from Agrigento, [[Sicily]], [[Italy]] ]]

Sulfur ([[Sanskrit]], ''sulvari''; [[Latin]] ''sulfur'' or ''sulpur'') was known in ancient times, and is referred to in the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Pentateuch]] ([[Genesis]]). The word itself probably is from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''sufra'' meaning yellow, from the bright color of the naturally occurring form, although the Sanskrit name for sulfur, ''sulvari'' could also be interpreted as meaning "enemy of copper".{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

English translations of the Bible commonly refer to sulfur as "brimstone", giving rise to the name of 'Fire and brimstone' [[sermon]]s, in which listeners are reminded of the fate of eternal damnation that awaits the nonbelieving and unrepented. It is from this part of the Bible that [[Hell]] is implied to "smell of sulfur", although as mentioned above sulfur is in fact odorless.  The "smell of sulfur" usually refers to the odor of [[hydrogen sulfide]], e.g. from rotten eggs.  Burning sulfur produces [[sulfur dioxide]], the smell associated with burnt matches.

[[Homer]] mentioned "pest-averting sulfur" in the [[8th century BC]] and in [[424 BC]], the tribe of [[Boeotia]] destroyed the walls of a city by burning a mixture of coal, sulfur, and tar under them {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. 

Sulfur was known in [[China]] since the 6th century BC, in a natural form that the Chinese had called 'brimstone', or ''shiliuhuang'' that was found in [[Hanzhong]].<ref name="yunming 487">Yunming, 487.</ref> By the 3rd century, the Chinese discovered that sulfur could be extracted from [[pyrite]].<ref name="yunming 487"/> Chinese Daoists were interested in sulfur's flammability and its reactivity with certain metals, yet its earliest practical uses were found in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].<ref name="yunming 487"/> A [[Song Dynasty]] military treatise of 1044 AD described different formulas for Chinese [[gun powder]], which is a mixture of [[potassium nitrate]] ([[potassium|K]][[nitrogen|N]][[oxygen|O]]<sub>3</sub>), [[carbon]], and sulfur. Early [[alchemy|alchemists]] gave sulfur its own [[alchemical symbol]] which was a triangle at the top of a cross. 

In the late [[1770s]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]] helped convince the scientific community that sulfur was an element and not a compound. In 1867, sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]]. The overlying layer of earth was [[quicksand]], prohibiting ordinary mining operations.  Therefore the [[Frasch process]] was utilized.

== Occurrence ==
[[Image:NZ sulfur NI.jpg|thumb|right|Sulfur crystalites at [[Waiotapu]] [[hot springs]], [[New Zealand]]]]
[[Image:AlbertaSulfurAtVancouverBC.jpg|thumb|right|Sulfur recovered from hydrocarbons in [[Alberta]], stockpiled for shipment at [[Vancouver|Vancouver, B. C.]]]]
Elemental sulfur can be found near [[hot spring]]s and [[volcanic]] regions in many parts of the world, especially along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].  Such volcanic deposits are currently mined in [[Indonesia]], [[Chile]], and [[Japan]]. [[Sicily]] is also famous for its sulfur mines.

Significant deposits of elemental sulfur also exist in [[salt domes]] along the coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and in [[evaporite]]s in eastern Europe and western Asia.  The sulfur in these deposits is believed to come from the action of [[anaerobic bacteria]] on [[Mineral#Sulfate class|sulfate minerals]], especially [[gypsum]], although apparently native sulfur may be produced by geological processes alone, without the aid of living organisms (see below). However, fossil-based sulfur deposits from salt domes are the basis for commercial production in the [[United States]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Ukraine]].

Sulfur production through [[hydrodesulfurization]] of oil, gas, and the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] has produced a surplus - huge stockpiles of sulfur now exist throughout Alberta, Canada.

Common naturally occurring sulfur compounds include the [[Mineral#Sulfide class|sulfide minerals]], such as [[pyrite]] (iron sulfide), [[cinnabar]] (mercury sulfide), [[galena]] ([[lead sulfide]]), [[sphalerite]] (zinc sulfide) and [[stibnite]] (antimony sulfide); and the sulfates, such as gypsum (calcium sulfate), [[alunite]] (potassium aluminium sulfate), and [[barite]] (barium sulfate).  It occurs naturally in volcanic emissions, such as from [[hydrothermal vent]]s, and from bacterial action on decaying sulfur-containing organic matter.

The distinctive colors of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]'s [[volcano|volcanic]] moon, [[Io (moon)|Io]], are from various forms of molten, solid and gaseous sulfur. There is also a dark area near the [[Moon|Lunar]] [[Impact crater|crater]] [[Aristarchus (crater)|Aristarchus]] that may be a sulfur deposit. Sulfur is also present in many types of [[meteorite]]s.

== Extraction == 
Sulfur is extracted by mainly two processes: the Sicilian process and the Frasch process. The Sicilian process, which was first used in [[Sicily]], was utilized in ancient times to get sulfur from rocks present in volcanic regions. In this process, the sulfur deposits are piled and stacked in brick kilns built on sloping hillsides, and with airspaces between them. Then powdered sulfur is put on top of the sulfur deposit and lit on fire. As the sulfur burns it produces heat, which melts the sulfur deposits, causing the molten sulfur to flow down the sloping hillsides. The molten sulfur can then be collected in wooden buckets. 

The second process used to obtain sulfur is the Frasch process. In this method, three concentric pipes are used: The outermost pipe contains superheated water, which melts the sulfur, and the innermost pipe is filled with hot compressed air, which serves to create foam and pressure. The resulting sulfur foam is then expelled out through the middle pipe. 

The Frasch process produces sulfur with a 99.5% purity content, and which needs no further purification. On the other hand, the sulfur produced by the Sicilian process must be purified by distillation.

== Compounds ==
[[Image:Sulfur powder.jpg|right|thumb|Sulfur powder]]
[[Hydrogen sulfide]] has the characteristic smell of rotten eggs. Dissolved in water, hydrogen sulfide is acidic and will react with metals to form a series of metal sulfides. Natural metal sulfides are common, especially those of iron. Iron sulfide is called [[pyrite]], the so-called ''fool's gold''. Interestingly, pyrite can show semiconductor properties.[http://home.earthlink.net/~lenyr/iposc.htm] [[Galena]], a naturally occurring lead sulfide, was the first [[semiconductor]] discovered, and found a use as a signal [[rectifier]] in the "cat's whiskers" of early [[crystal radio]]s.

Many of the unpleasant odors of organic matter are based on sulfur-containing compounds such as [[Methanethiol|methyl]] and [[Ethanethiol|ethyl mercaptan]] used to scent natural gas so that leaks are easily detectable. The odor of [[garlic]] and "[[skunk]] stink" are also caused by sulfur-containing organic compounds. However, not all organic sulfur compounds smell unpleasant; for example, [[grapefruit mercaptan]], a sulfur-containing [[terpene|monoterpenoid]] is responsible for the characteristic scent of [[grapefruit]].

Polymeric sulfur nitride has metallic properties even though it does not contain any [[metal]] atoms. This compound also has unusual electrical and optical properties. This polymer can be made from [[tetrasulfur tetranitride]] S<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>.

Phosphorus sulfides are important in synthesis.  For example, P<sub>4</sub>S<sub>10</sub> and its derivatives [[Lawesson's reagent]] and [[naphthalen-1,8-diyl 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide]] are used to replace oxygen from some organic molecules with sulfur.

'''Inorganic sulfur compounds:'''
* [[Sulfide]]s (S<sup>2−</sup>), a complex family of compounds usually derived from S<sup>2−</sup>.  [[Cadmium sulfide]] (CdS) is an example.
* [[Sulfites]] (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>), the salts of [[sulfurous acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>) which is generated by dissolving SO<sub>2</sub> in water. Sulfurous acid and the corresponding sulfites are fairly strong reducing agents. Other compounds derived from SO<sub>2</sub> include the pyrosulfite or metabisulfite ion (S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub><sup>2−</sup>).
* [[Sulfate]]s (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>), the salts of [[sulfuric acid]]. Sulfuric acid also reacts with SO<sub>3</sub> in equimolar ratios to form [[pyrosulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>).
* [[sodium thiosulfate|Thiosulfates]] (sometimes referred to as thiosulfites or "hyposulfites") (S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>). Thiosulfates are used in photographic fixing (HYPO) as reducing agents.  Ammonium thiosulfate is being investigated as a [[cyanide]] replacement in leaching [[gold]].[http://doccopper.tripod.com/gold/AltLixiv.html]
* [[Sodium dithionite]], Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, is the highly reducing dianion derived from hyposulfurous/dithionous acid.
* [[Sodium dithionate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>).
* [[Polythionic acid]]s (H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>''n''</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), where ''n'' can range from 3 to 80.
* [[Peroxymonosulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>5</sub>) and [[peroxydisulfuric acid]]s (H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>), made from the action of SO<sub>3</sub> on concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide|H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]], and [[sulfuric acid|H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]] on concentrated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> respectively.
* [[Sodium polysulfide]]s (Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>x</sub>)
* [[Sulfur hexafluoride]], SF<sub>6</sub>, a dense gas at ambient conditions, is used as nonreactive and nontoxic propellant
* Sulfur nitrides are chain and cyclic compounds containing only S and N.  [[Tetrasulfur tetranitride]] S<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is an example.
* [[Thiocyanate]]s contain the SCN<sup>−</sup> group.  Oxidation of thiocyanoate gives [[thiocyanogen]], (SCN)<sub>2</sub> with the connectivity NCS-SCN.

'''Organic sulfur compounds''' (where R, R', and R'' are organic groups such as CH<sub>3</sub>):

* [[Thioether]]s have the form ''R''-S-''R&prime;''.  These compounds are the sulfur equivalents of [[ether]]s.
* [[Sulfonium]] ions have the formula RR'S-'R'", i.e. where three groups are attached to the cationic sulfur center.  [[Dimethylsulfoniopropionate]] ([[DMSP]];  (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sup>+</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COO<sup>−</sup>) is a sulfonium ion, which is important in the marine organic sulfur cycle.
* [[Thiol]]s (also known as mercaptans) have the form R-SH.  These are the sulfur equivalents of [[alcohol]]s.
* [[Thiolate]]s ions have the form R-S<sup>-</sup>.  Such anions arise upon treatment of [[thiol]]s with base.
* [[Sulfoxide]]s have the form ''R''-S(=O)-''R''&prime;. A common sulfoxide is [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]].
* [[Sulfone]]s have the form ''R''-S(=O)<sub>2</sub>-''R''&prime;.  A common sulfone is sulfolane C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>.

== Isotopes ==
Sulfur has 18 [[isotope]]s, four of which are stable: <sup>32</sup>S (95.02%), <sup>33</sup>S (0.75%), <sup>34</sup>S (4.21%), and <sup>36</sup>S (0.02%). Other than <sup>35</sup>S, the [[radioactive isotopes]] of sulfur are all short lived. <sup>35</sup>S is formed from [[cosmic ray]] [[spallation]] of <sup>40</sup>[[argon|Ar]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It has a [[half-life]] of 87 days.

When sulfide [[mineral]]s are precipitated, isotopic equilibration among solids and liquid may cause small differences in the δS-34 values of co-genetic minerals. The differences between minerals can be used to estimate the temperature of equilibration. The δ[[carbon|C]]-13 and δS-34 of coexisting [[carbonate]]s and sulfides can be used to determine the [[pH]] and [[oxygen]] [[fugacity]] of the ore-bearing fluid during ore formation.

In most [[forest]] ecosystems, sulfate is derived mostly from the atmosphere; weathering of ore minerals and evaporites also contribute some sulfur. Sulfur with a distinctive isotopic composition has been used to identify pollution sources, and enriched sulfur has been added as a tracer in [[hydrology|hydrologic]] studies. Differences in the [[natural abundance]]s can also be used in systems where there is sufficient variation in the <sup>34</sup>S of ecosystem components. [[Rocky Mountain]] lakes thought to be dominated by atmospheric sources of sulfate have been found to have different δS-34 values from lakes believed to be dominated by watershed sources of sulfate.

== Precautions ==
Carbon disulfide, carbon oxysulfide, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfur dioxide should all be handled with care.

Although ''[[sulfur dioxide]]'' is sufficiently safe to be used as a [[food additive]] in small amounts, at high concentrations it reacts with moisture to form [[sulfurous acid]] which in sufficient quantities may harm the [[lungs]], [[eyes]] or other [[Biological tissue|tissues]]. In organisms without lungs such as insects or plants, it otherwise prevents [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]].

''[[Hydrogen sulfide]]'' is quite [[toxic]] (more toxic than [[cyanide]]).{{Fact|date=May 2007}}  Although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so potential victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late.

== Spelling ==
The element has traditionally been spelled ''sulphur'' in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]] and [[India]], but ''sulfur'' in the [[United States]], while both spellings are used in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]]. [[IUPAC]] adopted the spelling “sulfur” in 1990, as did the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] Nomenclature Committee in 1992.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}  The spelling of the term in non-official texts is gradually becoming uniform as ''sulfur''.

The Latin name of the element is ''sulfur'' with an F. Since it is an original Latin name and not a [[Classical Greek]] loan, the fricative phoneme is indeed denoted with ''f'' rather than ''ph'' (which would denote the Greek letter φ). Sulfur in Greek is ''theion'' (θεῖον), whence comes the prefix [[thio-]].
