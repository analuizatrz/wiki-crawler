'''Ronald 'Ernest' Paul''' (born [[August 20]] [[1935]]) is a 10th-term [[United States Congress|Congressman]], [[physician]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]) and a [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential candidate]] from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], seeking the [[2008 Republican presidential candidates|nomination of the Republican Party]].

As a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he has represented [[Texas's 14th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] since 1997 and represented [[Texas's 22nd congressional district|Texas's 22nd district]] in 1976 and from 1979 to 1985.

Paul advocates a strictly limited role for the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], low [[taxes]], [[free market]]s, a [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] foreign policy, and a return to [[Monetary policy|monetary policies]] based on [[Hard money (policy)|commodity-backed currency]]. He has earned the nickname "Dr. No" because he is a [[physician|medical doctor]] who votes against any bill he believes violates the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.com.com/They+call+him+Dr.+No+for+good+reason/2010-1071_3-940767.html|title= Perspective: They call him Dr. No for good reason|author= McCullagh, Declan|date= 2002-07-01|publisher= CNET News}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Paul was born in [[Green Tree, Pennsylvania|Green Tree]], [[Pennsylvania]] (southwest of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]), to Howard Caspar Paul (1904–1997), the son of a [[Germany|German]] [[immigrant]], and Margaret Paul (1908–2001), who owned a dairy farm outside Pittsburgh.<ref name="dailypaul1">{{cite web |url= http://dailypaul.com/node/53|title= The American Dream - Through the Eyes of Mrs. Ron Paul|author= Paul, Carol|date= 2007-03-16|publisher= Daily Paul}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wargs.com/political/paul.html|title= The Ancestors of Ron Paul|accessdate= 2007-05-20|author= Reitwiesner, William Addams|publisher= Wargs.com}}</ref>  He was the third of five sons born during seven years in the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="dailypaul1"/> Paul's father had an eighth-grade education.  In his early years, Paul worked at his parents' dairy at age five, delivered newspapers, and worked in a drugstore.<ref name="dailypaul1"/>

He graduated from Dormont High School in [[Dormont, Pennsylvania]], in 1953 with honors.  He excelled in [[track and field]], winning the Pennsylvania state championship in the 220-yard dash and coming in second in the 440-yard dash as a junior.  He once beat a young man who eventually went to the Olympics.  He was also on the [[wrestling]] team and president of the student council.<ref name="dailypaul1"/> 

Paul paid for his first year at [[Gettysburg College]] with saved newspaper-delivery and lawn-mowing money. Paul delivered mail and laundry on the side while in Gettysburg; for one year, he managed the college coffee shop.  He gave up track after a knee injury, but joined the college swimming team instead after taking it up as therapy.  He had been offered a full [[scholarship]] to run for the track team but declined it, worried that he wouldn't regain his previous speed.  Paul was inducted into [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity,<ref>http://www.fraternalcaucus.org/greeks_congress</ref> and he served as steward and house manager of the fraternity.  He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1957.<ref name="dailypaul1"/>

He was then accepted to [[Duke University School of Medicine]], where he received his [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) in 1961. He did his [[internship]] and a year of [[residency]] training, both in [[internal medicine]], at [[Henry Ford Hospital]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] from 1961 to 1962<ref name="dailypaul1"/> and [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in [[obstetrics]]/[[gynecology]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1965 to 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=P000583|title= PAUL, Ronald Ernest|accessdate= 2007-05-20|publisher= United States Congress}}</ref>

Paul is well-versed in the economic philosophy of the [[Austrian school of economics]], and has authored several books (see below) on the subject. He has pictures of [[Friedrich von Hayek]],  [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Murray Rothbard]] hanging on his office wall.<ref>[http://www.amconmag.com/2007/2007_06_18/cover.html "Lone Star"]American Conservative Magazine, June 18, 2007.

==Medical career==
Paul interrupted his medical training to serve as a [[flight surgeon]] in the [[United States Air Force]] at [[Kelly Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] from 1963 to 1965.  Paul served in the [[Air National Guard]] from 1965 to 1968 while completing his medical residency in [[Pittsburgh]]. 

Paul began his medical practice in [[Lake Jackson, Texas]], as a specialist in [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]], delivering more than 4,000 babies. He took over the practice of a retiring doctor and was busy as the only obstetrician and gynecologist in [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]].  Paul said of his time as a doctor, "I delivered forty to fifty babies a month and did a lot of surgery."<ref name="texasmonthly2001">{{cite web |url= http://www.texasmonthly.com/2001-10-01/feature7.php|title= Dr. No|author= Gwynne, S.C.|date= 2001-10-01|publisher= ''[[Texas Monthly]]''}}</ref> 

Dr. Paul did not accept [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or [[Medicaid]] as a physician; instead, he would do the work [[Pro bono publico|for free]] or work at a greatly lowered payment or payment plan for needy patients.<ref name="paulfacts">{{cite web |url= http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070323/23paulfacts.htm|title= 10 Things You Didn't Know About Ron Paul|author= Burton, Danielle|date= 2007-03-23|publisher= ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''}}</ref><ref name="paulsneery">{{cite web |url= http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_199806/ai_n8799789|title= Paul vs. Sneery|date= 1998-06-26|publisher= ''Human Events''}}</ref>

==Family life==
Paul and his wife, Carol Wells, were married on February 1, 1957.  Carol asked Ron to their first date at a [[Sadie Hawkins]] dance.<ref name="dailypaul1"/>  They went to colleges in different states but kept in touch and married in Ron's senior year at [[Gettysburg College]].<ref name="dailypaul1"/>  

They have five children: Ronnie, Lori, Rand, Robert, and Joy. They also have seventeen grandchildren and one great-grandchild.<ref name="firstfamily">{{cite web |url= http://www.dailypaul.com/node/185 |title= The First Family ???|author= Pyeatt, Matt|date= May 24, 2007|publisher= Daily Paul}}</ref>  While they lived in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] for his residency, Carol ran a dance school in their basement.<ref name="dailypaul1"/>  Three of the children, Robert, Rand, and Joy also became medical doctors. Rand specializes in [[ophthalmology]] and Robert specializes in [[family practice]].  Like Congressman Paul, his daughter Joy specializes in [[obstetrics]]/[[gynecology]].<ref name="firstfamily"/>  Paul supported his children during their undergraduate and medical school years, not allowing them to take part in [[subsidy|subsidized]] federal [[student loan]] programs. He has not signed up for a [[congressional pension]] for the same reason.<ref name="paulfacts"/>

When her husband was campaigning in the 14th District, Carol Paul decided to help his campaign by compiling family recipes into a [[cookbook]] and sending it to constituents.<ref name="saynot">{{cite web |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/08/AR2006070800966_2.html|title= Congressman Paul's Legislative Strategy?

==Political positions==

{{main|Political positions of Ron Paul}}

Paul supports [[free trade]], the [[gold standard]], handgun ownership, and tight border security.  He opposes [[abortion]], [[capital punishment]], the [[Federal Reserve]], foreign intervention, [[gay marriage]], [[income tax]], and the [[war on drugs]].  He believes that the federal government should have no influence on [[education]].  He has stated that religion should play a role in public life, but that there should be no [[state religion]].<ref>http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul148.html</ref>

In his [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], Paul has stated that he would like to "reinstate the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and restore the [[Republic]]." He believes in maintaining and restoring civil liberties.<ref name="patriotism">{{cite web | title=Patriotism | url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul388.html | work=House of Representatives |publisher= Lew Rockwell | date=2007-05-22 | accessdate=2007-06-08}} </ref>  His voting record is consistent in rejection of a [[welfare state]] role for the federal government and advocacy of [[Gold standard|hard currency]] and a [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] [[foreign policy]].

[[Image:Ronpaulspeaking.jpg|right|thumb|Ron Paul cites the [[9/11 commission report]] as evidence of "[[blowback (intelligence)|blowback]]" resulting from US foreign policy, in May 2007]]
In the May 3, 2007, GOP Debate, Paul stated that as President, he would immediately seek the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and the abolition of the income tax. He has said that he knows change on federal taxation and the gold standard would have to be gradual, with a switch to a federal [[sales tax]] rather than income tax and eventual smaller government with not as much tax needed, coupled with a gradual return of gold-backed currency.<ref name="eaglespeech">{{cite web |url= http://www.theeagle.com/stories/052007/politics_20070520008.php|title= Presidential candidate Paul makes stop in Brenham|accessdate= 2007-06-14|publisher= Bryan-College Station Eagle}}</ref>  As Congressman, he has long fought for the [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|prohibition of direct taxes]] by repeal of the [[16th Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment]] which authorized the [[income tax]].  Paul has been called a "Taxpayer's Friend" by the [[National Taxpayers Union]] every year he has been in Congress, indicating a fiscal conservative voting record on spending of taxpayer dollars.<ref name="ntu2008">{{cite web |url= http://www.ntu.org/main/page.php?PageID=97|title= NTU's Fiscal "Snapshot" of the 2008 Presidential Race|accessdate= 2007-06-10|publisher= National Taxpayers Union}}</ref>

Paul stated that the bill "would allow Congress to authorize the President to specifically target Bin Laden and his associates using non-government armed forces. Since it is nearly impossible for U.S. intelligence teams to get close to Bin Laden, the marque and reprisal approach creates an incentive for people in Afghanistan or elsewhere to turn him over to the U.S."<ref>{{cite web | title=Paul Offers President New Tool in the War on Terrorism | author=Ron Paul | url=http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press2001/pr101101.htm | publisher= Rep.

Paul has opposed U.S. involvement in opposing [[Sudan]]'s [[human rights]] violations in [[Darfur]].    On November 19, 2004, Paul, speaking on the floor of the House, opposed intervention in what he described as a "civil war with nothing to do with us," asking "(w)hy does it always seem that when we hear urgent clamor for the United States to intervene, oil or some other valuable commodity just happens to be present?"<ref>[http://www.ronpaullibrary.org/document.php?id=582 HON. RON PAUL OF TEXAS

Paul's desire to secure U.S. borders remains a key topic in his 2008 presidential campaign. He opposes the North American Union proposition and its proposed integration of [[Mexico]], the United States of America, and [[Canada]].  Paul voted "yes" on the [[Secure Fence Act of 2006]], which authorizes the construction of an additional 700 miles of double-layered fencing between the U.S and Mexico. Paul opposes [[illegal immigration]] as well as [[amnesty]] for illegal immigrants.  He also introduced legislation that would amend the Constitution to stop giving automatic citizenship to babies who are born in the United States  to non-citizen parents, which has been in effect since the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] was ratified in 1868.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rethinking Birthright Citizenship | author=Ron Paul | url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2006/tst100206.htm | publisher= Rep. Ron Paul, official website | date=2006-10-02 | accessdate=2007-05-20}} </ref>

Ron Paul links his pro-life position closely to his libertarian views. Paul supports allowing individual states to decide on the legality of [[abortion]] citing that it is not an enumerated power of the federal government.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ontheissues.org/TX/Ron_Paul.htm|title= Ron Paul on the Issues|accessdate=2007-06-24 |publisher=On the Issues}}</ref> Accordingly, he has challenged [[Roe v.

He supports the U.S. converting to a free market healthcare system, saying in an interview on New Hampshire NPR that the present system is akin to a "[[corporatism|corporatist-fascist]]" system which keeps prices high. He says that in industries with freer markets, prices go down due to technological innovation, but because of the corporatist system, this is prevented from happening in healthcare. He opposes the [[socialized healthcare]] alternative offered by Democrats as being harmful as well.<ref name="npr-2007-06-05">{{cite web | title=Republican Representative Ron Paul of Texas | url=http://www.nhpr.org/node/13016 | publisher= New Hampshire National Public Radio | date=2007-06-05 | accessdate=2007-06-08}} </ref>

An [[obstetrician]] by trade, Paul is [[pro-life]]. Paul holds that the United States Constitution does not grant the federal government any authority to [[legalize]] or [[ban (law)|ban]] [[abortion]].  He believes that his pro-life stance aligns with his libertarianism, on the premise that abortion is aggression against a person. Nevertheless, in order to offset the effects of [[Roe v. Wade]], he voted in favor of the federal ''[[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]]''. He has also introduced H.R. 4379  that would prohibit the [[Supreme Court]] from ruling on issues relating to abortion, [[birth control]], the definition of [[marriage]] and [[homosexuality]] and states that the court's precedent in these areas would no longer be binding.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.4379:|] on the homepage of the Library of Congress accessed at [[March 4]] [[2007]]</ref>

==Early congressional career==
A prominent physician in his district when he went into politics, Paul became a [[delegate]] to the Texas state Republican [[Political convention|convention]] in 1974. He had decided to enter politics on August 15, 1971, when President [[Richard Nixon]] went off the [[gold standard]] completely.  He said, "After that day, all money would be political money rather than money of real value. I was astounded."<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> 

Paul was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congressman from the 22nd District of Texas in 1974, an election where Democratic candidates won heavily, against the incumbent Democrat [[Robert R. Casey]]. When President [[Gerald R. Ford]] appointed Casey as head of the [[Federal Maritime Commission]], a [[special election]] was held in [[April]] [[1976]] to choose a new congressperson. Paul won that election but lost six months later in the [[general election]] to Democrat [[Robert Gammage|Robert A. Gammage]]. The vote was close: fewer than 300 votes out of 180,000. He then defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch. Paul won new terms in 1980 and 1982.  Paul was the first Republican to represent the area in the House of Representatives.<ref name="campaigncom">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF-s1voM_Y The Ron Paul Story] on YouTube accessed on [[June 14]] [[2007]]</ref>  He was one of only four Republican congressmen to endorse [[Ronald Reagan]] for president against [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976,<ref name="2008bio"/> when Dr. Paul led the Texas delegation in support of Reagan at the national Republican convention.<ref name="campaigncom"/>   

Paul delivered babies on Mondays and Saturdays during his entire term as the 22nd District representative.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  During this time, he began to gain his reputation as "Dr. No", with his refusal to vote for laws he felt to be unconstitutional called "legendary" by the ''Wall Street Journal''.<ref name="campaigncom"/>

In the 1980 election, despite spending half of what his Democratic opponent did, he won a tight contest.<ref name="wsj1997"/> Paul was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[U.S. Senate]] in the 1984 [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] primary against [[Phil Gramm]]. In 1985, Paul voluntarily left his seat to return to full-time medical practice<ref name="2008bio"/> and was succeeded by [[Tom DeLay]], then a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]].<ref>http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legis/members/roster.cfm?leg=68</ref> In a farewell address on the House floor, Paul said, "Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare.  Vote trading is seen as good politics. The errand-boy mentality is ordinary, the defender of liberty is seen as bizarre. It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic."<ref name="insight1997"/>

==1988 presidential campaign==
In the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]], despite having no previous affiliation with the [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian Party]], Paul won that party's nomination for the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidency]]. Appearing on the ballot in 46 states and the [[District of Columbia]],<ref name="1988nytimes">{{cite web |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0712FB3E5C0C748DDDA90994D0484D81|title=  Now for a Real Underdog: Ron Paul, Libertarian, for President|date= 1988-10-17|publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''}}</ref> he placed third in the [[popular vote]] (with 431,750 votes - 0.47%), behind Republican [[George H.

Bush had been [[Vice President of the United States|vice-president]].<ref name="campaign1996"/>

Paul said that he was doing more during his presidential run than reach office: he was trying to spread his liberty-minded ideas and would often talk to school groups that weren't old enough to vote. "We're just as interested in the future generation as this election.  These kids will vote eventually, and maybe, just maybe, they'll go home and talk to their parents."<ref name="1988nytimes"/>

During his time as Libertarian candidate, Paul gained supporters nationwide who agreed with him on many of his positions—on gun rights, [[fiscal conservatism]], [[home-schooling]], right-to-lifers, and others who thought the federal government was heading in the wrong direction.  These supporters formed a nationwide support base that encouraged him to return to office and supported his campaigns financially.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

After the election, Paul had a coin business and worked at his own [[think tank]] until returning to Congress.<ref name="spectator1999">{{citation|title= A principled maverick|date= 1999-11|publisher= ''The American Spectator''}}</ref>

==Later congressional career==
===Campaigns===
[[Image:Ron paul.jpg|right|thumb|Congressional portrait]]
In 1996, Paul returned to Congress after a tougher battle than he had faced in the 1970s.  He thought that he could get more accomplished in Congress after the Republicans took over both houses of Congress in the 1994 election.<ref name="paulsneery">  His Republican primary opponent, [[Greg Laughlin]], had support from leaders within the Republican Party, including House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and Texas Governor [[George W.

His Democratic opponent in the fall election, [[lawyer]] Charles "Lefty" Morris, lost in a close margin despite running numerous attacks on Paul, including his past votes to repeal federal drug laws in favor of state legislation and portions of old newsletters, assisted by the [[AFL-CIO]].  Paul in turn labeled Morris a pawn of trial lawyers and big labor.  He raised more money than Morris, with the help of his national network of donors: $1.2 million to Morris' $472,153.  Ken Bryan, a Democratic consultant to some of Paul's opponents, has said, "He has one of the largest contributor bases in Congress, outside of the leadership."  Most of Paul's contributions are given in small amounts by individuals.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  That year, he had the third-highest amount of individual contributions of any House member, behind Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[Bob Dornan]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.reason.com/news/show/118086.html|title= Paul for President?:The maverick libertarian Republican talks on war, immigration, and presidential ambition.|accessdate= 2007-05-28|author= Doherty, Brian|date= 2007-01-22|publisher= Reason Magazine }}</ref>

In 1998 he again won the primary and the election and outraised his opponent by a large margin, $2.1 million to $734,000.  Opposing a Democratic rice farmer and former [[Matagorda County, Texas|Matagorda County]] judge, Loy Sneary, Paul won by 11 percentage points; he ran ads warning voters to be "leery of Sneary."<ref name="saynot"/> Paul accused Judge Sneary of voting to raise his pay by 5%, increasing his judge's travel budget by 400% in one year, and creating more government bureaucracy by starting a new government agency to handle a license plate fee he enacted.  Sneary's aides said he had voted to raise all county employees' pay by 5% in a "cost of living" increase. Paul countered that he had never voted to raise congressional pay.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story.mpl/content/chronicle/metropolitan/98/08/15/notebook.2-0.html|title= Foes lock horns over Paul's radio ads|accessdate= 2007-05-26|author= |date= 1998-08-14|work= Campaign Notebook|publisher= Houston Chronicle}}</ref><ref name="paulsneery"/>

and Chris Peden, Friendswood city councilman.  [http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA052207.EN.PAUL.94898f61.html]

===Principles===
''Texas Monthly'', calling Paul "both deeply principled and wholly uncompromised," wrote in 2001 that he does not take money from [[political action committee]]s (PACs), is not swayed by Congressional lobbyists, only votes on his "deeply held beliefs" and does not cut "backroom deals."  They write, "The phrase 'honest politician' is an oxymoron; yet in the sense that Paul never, ever votes against his stated principles... the phrase describes him."  Along with not signing up for a Congressional pension, Paul's Congressional office returns money to the government each year; in 2000, the sum returned was $50,000.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

However, records from the Federal Election Commission show that he does take money from PACs, although much less than most of his counterparts in Congress. Dr. Paul consistently received PAC money during the 1998, 2000, 2004, and 2006 congressional electoral cycles.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/memberprofile.asp?cid=N00005906&Cycle=2006&CollapseAll=TRUE|title= PAC Contributions to Paul, Ron (R-TX)|accessdate= 2007-06-04|publisher= OpenSecrets.org}}</ref> 

In a special report, the group Clean Up Washington listed Paul as taking the seventh-least amount of money from PACs of all members of the House, as well as one of the members of Congress accepting the least amount of money from lobbyists and as ranking fourth in taking the most percentage of contributions from small donors. Their data studied contributions from the 2000 election cycle to midway through 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cleanupwashington.org/sii/pdfs/factsheet.pdf|title= Under the Influence: Highlights from Public Citizen's Special Interest Index|accessdate= 2007-06-04|date= |year= 2006|month= 10|format= |work= |publisher= [[Public Citizen]]|pages= }}</ref>  Of the 2008 Republican presidential candidates, he has accepted the least percentage of PAC money.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/summary.asp?id=N00005906&cycle=2008|title= 2008 Presidential Election: Ron Paul Campaign Money|accessdate= 2007-06-04|publisher= OpenSecrets.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/index.asp|title= 2008 Presidential Election: Banking on Becoming President|accessdate= 2007-06-04|publisher= OpenSecrets.org}}</ref>

"Dr. No" can be "maddeningly uncooperative" to his Republican colleagues because he will not give in to pressure to vote for bills that he views as spending taxpayers' money in a wasteful manner or for bills that he feels violate the Constitution.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  Once when former House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] exhorted every Republican to vote the party line, he invoked a "Ron Paul exemption," saying Paul could vote as he pleased.<ref name="spectator1999"/> Fellow fiscal conservative [[Jeff Flake]] said in 2006, "When I'm the only no vote, I can usually rest assured he's on a plane somewhere."  Paul recounts that once, a bill passed 432-3.  He thought the bill was based on a bad principle, and he had convinced the two members of the House sitting next to him to join him in casting a "No" vote while they waited.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rlc.org/?p=FAQ|title=  Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=2007-06-24 |publisher= Republican Liberty Caucus}}</ref>

Paul has said that when current [[South Carolina]] governor [[Mark Sanford]] was in Congress with him from 1996 to 2002, he and Sanford often had voted together as the only "no" votes on bills that created more spending.<ref>''The State'', Columbia, South Carolina, May 16, 2007, Knight Ridder Business Service, written by Wayne Washington, "Great expectations and gamesmanship: Signs, photo-ops, chitchat: It's all part of pre-debate spin for candidates"</ref>  ''[[The American Spectator]]'' noted that Paul's lone dissents garner him more respect than mockery among his colleagues.<ref name="spectator1999"/>

===Relationship with district===
Paul continued to work as an [[obstetrician]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas]], even while serving in Congress, delivering many constituents' babies.  As of 2001, he was one of few doctors in the House (eight, including dentists) and part of an even smaller group that continued to practice while in office. Journalists have reported that it is not unusual for younger people in his home district to approach him and say that he delivered them.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

Paul is against some legislation that coastal or rural members of [[Congress]] usually are not.  Paul's district in Texas borders the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with 675 miles of coastline and also includes suburbs of [[Houston]]; it was redistricted prior to the 2004 election. Paul is opposed to federally funded [[flood insurance]] because it requires those who do not live near [[flood]] zones to subsidize those who choose to live in an area that is prone to flooding and does not allow those in flood zones to choose their own insurer. In an "overwhelmingly rural region," Paul opposes farm subsidies because they go to big corporations rather than small farmers. Despite voting against bills with large support in Congress, such as the farm bill, the congressman's "contrarian nature" and devotion to lowering taxes appeals to voters in the 14th District<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>.

While some politicians would find it unthinkable to vote against bringing "[[pork barrel spending|pork]]" to their home district, Paul diverts funds that already exist within bills away from other members' districts to his district.<ref name="wsj2003">{{cite web |url= http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB104725224693862700.html|title= A Far-Right Texan Inspires Antiwar Left|accessdate= 2007-06-15|author= SHAILAGH MURRAY|date= 2003-03-10|year= 2003|publisher= ''Wall Street Journal''}}</ref>   Paul spends time in the district to compensate for "violat[ing] almost every rule of political survival you can think of."<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  He sometimes spends three to four days a week in his district addressing constituents' concerns, often accompanied by one of his 17 grandchildren.  He attends graduations, civic ceremonies, and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] honor ceremonies.  In an expansive district, it is not unusual for him to log more than 300 miles per day visiting [[constituents]] or handling their concerns.  He is particularly effective at reaching 14th District voters on veterans' issues, such as procuring medals for war veterans who lost or never received their medals; he holds medal ceremonies for those whose medals are being presented.  He has helped senior citizens of the district get free or low-cost prescription drugs through a little-known drug company program.  His staff sends out birthday cards to constituents, as well as [[condolence]] cards on the deaths of family members.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

===Sponsored legislation and affiliations===
Paul sponsors many bills in Congress, many of which, like ones that would abolish the [[income tax]] or the [[Federal Reserve]], do not get out of committee.  Nevertheless, he has been named one of the "50 Most Effective Members of Congress" by ''Congressional Quarterly''.<ref name="ronpaulis">{{cite web |url= http://www.ronpaulforcongress.com/html/ronpaulis.html |title= Ron Paul Is… | accessdate= 2007-06-15|publisher= Ron Paul for Congress}}</ref> He has sponsored successful legislation to prevent the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] from seizing a church in New York state through [[eminent domain]] and a bill transferring ownership of the [[Lake Texana]] dam project from the federal government to [[Texas]].<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  Paul has also sponsored legislation to end the [[Bank Secrecy Act]].<ref name="bankact">{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press99/pr060999h.htm|title=  Henry Hyde cosponsors Bank Secrecy Sunset Act|accessdate= 2007-06-13|author= Ron Paul congressional office|date= 1999-06-09|year= 1999|publisher= US House of Representatives homepage}}</ref>  Paul said in 2004 that he had refused to vote for more than 700 bills creating a larger government over his previous two terms in office.<ref name="scspeech">{{cite web |url= http://www.lewrockwell.com/yates/yates92.html|title=  An Evening With Dr. Ron Paul|accessdate= 2007-06-13|author= Steven Yates|date= 2004-04-07|year= 2004|publisher= Lew Rockwell}}</ref>  In March 2001, Paul introduced the "Constitutional War Powers Resolution of 2001" which would repeal the War Powers Resolution and not allow presidents to go to war without a formal declaration of war from Congress, except in cases of an attack on the US.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22022|title= Bill would restore Congress' war powers|accessdate= 2007-06-13|author= Jon Dougherty|date= 2001-03-13|year= 2001|publisher= World Net Daily}}</ref>

Congressman Paul serves on the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services]], [[United States House Committee on International Relations|International Relations Committee]], and the Joint Economic Committee.  He is vice-chairman of the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee and also serves on the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy, Technology, and Economic Growth.  Under the Committee on International Relations, he serves on the Western Hemisphere and Asia and the Pacific subcommittees.<ref name="officialbio"/>

Paul was one of 17 members of a bipartisan coalition of members of Congress who filed a lawsuit against President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999 over his conduct of the war in Kosovo.  In the filing, they accused Clinton of not reporting to Congress within 48 hours on the status of the action as required by the 1973 [[War Powers Resolution]] and not first obtaining a declaration of war from Congress as required in the Constitution.  Congress had voted 427 to 2 against a declaration of war with [[Yugoslavia]] and had voted to deny support for the air campaign in Kosovo.  A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that since Congress had voted for funding after the US was actively engaged in the war with Kosovo, legislators had sent a confusing message about whether they approved of the war. Paul said that the judge's decision was an attempt to circumvent the Constitution and make it legal for the president to conduct a war without approval from Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press99/pr060999.htm|title= Judge sides with Clinton|accessdate= 2007-06-12|author= Ron Paul's Congressional office|date= 1999-06-09|year= 1999|publisher= US House of Representatives homepage}}</ref>

Paul introduced legislation to declare war on Iraq in October 2002. He said he would not vote for his own bill, but if his fellow members of Congress wished to go to war in Iraq, they should follow the Constitution and declare war.  In a hearing on the resolution, Republican Rep. [[Henry Hyde]] said, "There are things in the Constitution that have been overtaken by events, by time. Declaration of war is one of them. There are things no longer relevant to a modern society. Why declare war if you don’t have to? We are saying to the President, use your judgment. So, to demand that we declare war is to strengthen something to death. You have got a hammerlock on this situation, and it is not called for. Inappropriate, anachronistic, it isn’t done anymore."<ref name="scspeech"/> As one of five Republicans to vote against the Iraq War Resolution, Paul inspired the founding of a group called the National Peace Lobby Project to promote a resolution he and Oregon representative [[Peter DeFazio]] sponsored to repeal the war authorization in February 2003.  His column "35 Questions That Won't Be Asked About Iraq" was translated and published in German, French, Russian, Italian and Swiss publications before the Iraq War began.<ref name="wsj2003"/>

Paul has asserted that his fellow members of Congress passed the [[Patriot Act]] without actually reading it and examining how it infringed on ordinary Americans' civil liberties, as a reaction to September 11.<ref name="scspeech"/>  Paul has said his fellow members of Congress have increased domestic spending by 33% since Bush came into office.  After introduction of a 2005 bill that was touted as "slashing" government programs, he wrote that the bill only decreased spending by less than a fraction of 1% and that "Congress couldn't slash spending if the members' lives depended on it."<ref name="budgetslashing">{{cite web |url= http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul287.html|title=  Too Little Too Late|accessdate= 2007-06-13|author= Ron Paul|date= 2005-11-15|year= 2005|publisher= Lew Rockwell}}</ref> 

Paul served as honorary chairman and is a current member of the [[Republican Liberty Caucus]], a political action organization dedicated to promoting the ideals of individual rights, limited government and free enterprise within the Republican Party.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://fl.rlc.org/|title= RLC of Florida|accessdate= 2007-03-04|author= |date= |year= |work= |publisher= Republican Liberty Caucus of Florida}}</ref> He also serves on the Liberty Committee, a group of liberty-minded congresspeople from both sides of the aisle.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thelibertycommittee.org/|title= The Liberty Committee|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> He is a founding member of the Congressional Rural Caucus, which deals with agricultural and rural issues.<ref name="ronpaulis"/>

Unlike many political candidates, Paul receives the overwhelming majority of his campaign contributions (96.8% in 2005–2006) from individuals.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.asp?CID=N00005906&cycle=2006|title= Contributions|accessdate= 2007-05-25|work= Ron Paul: Campaign Finance/Money|publisher= OpenSecrets.org}}</ref>

Ron Paul formally declared his candidacy for the 2008 Republican nomination on [[March 12]], [[2007]], as a guest on ''[[Washington Journal]]'' on [[C-SPAN]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA031207.paul2008.EN.74141d9.html | title = Paul formally launches presidential bid | first = Gary | last = Martin | work = San Antonio Express-News | date = 2007-03-12 | accessdate = 2007-03-13}}</ref><ref>[http://chbn.com/Clip.aspx?key=1CD9E3A0397BCBEC Ron Paul announcing candidacy on C-SPAN]</ref>  

Paul came in second in fundraising in [[New Hampshire]] during first quarter fundraising, trailing only [[Mitt Romney]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ronpaul2008.typepad.com/ron_paul_2008/2007/04/press_release_2.html|title= Ron Paul Second in New Hampshire Fundraising|accessdate= 2007-06-08|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= Ron Paul 2008 Presidential Campaign}}</ref> Since he did not declare his candidacy until March, he had less time to raise money than other candidates who had declared earlier in the quarter.

Paul has participated all in all three nationally-televised candidate debates thus far. His most prominent moment came during the May 15 GOP Presidential debate when the following exchange occurred with fellow Republican hopeful [[Rudy Giuliani]]:

<blockquote>PAUL: They attack us because we've been over there. We've been bombing Iraq for 10 years. We've been in the Middle East [for years]. I think [Ronald] Reagan was right. We don't understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics. Right now, we're building an embassy in Iraq that is bigger than the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. We're building 14 permanent bases. What would we say here if [[People's Republic of China|China]] was doing this in our country or in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]? We would be objecting.</blockquote>

<blockquote>GIULIANI: That's really an extraordinary statement. That's an extraordinary statement, as someone who lived through the attack of September 11, that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq. I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th. And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PAUL: I believe very sincerely that the CIA is correct when they teach and talk about [[blowback (intelligence)|blowback]]. When we went into Iran in 1953 and installed the Shah, yes there was blowback.  The reaction to that was the taking of our hostages, and that persists.  And if we ignore that, we ignore that at our own risk.  If we think we can do what we want around the world and not incite hatred, then we have a problem.  They don't come here to attack us because we're rich and we're free, they come and attack us because we're over there.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7d_e9lrcZ8</ref></blockquote>

That's true for most people, but black males age 13 who have been raised on the streets and who have joined criminal gangs are as big, strong, tough, scary and culpable as any adult and should be treated as such."  

The ''Houston Chronicle'' article also quotes the newsletter as saying, "Opinion polls consistently show that only about 5 percent of blacks have sensible political opinions, i.e. support the free market, individual liberty and the end of welfare and affirmative action." And, "Given the inefficiencies of what D.C. laughingly calls the 'criminal justice system', I think we can safely assume that 95 percent of the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal." ... [although] "we are constantly told that it is evil to be afraid of black men, it is hardly irrational. Black men commit murders, rapes, robberies, muggings and burglaries all out of proportion to their numbers."</ref>  
				 
In a 2001 interview with ''Texas Monthly'' magazine, Paul acknowledged that the comments were printed in the newsletter under his name, but explained that they did not represent his views and that they were written by a [[ghostwriter]]. He further stated that he felt some moral responsibility for the words that had been attributed to him, despite the fact that they did not represent his way of thinking: 
<blockquote>"They were never my words, but I had some moral responsibility for them...I actually really wanted to try to explain that it doesn't come from me directly, but they [campaign aides] said that's too confusing. 'It appeared in your letter and your name was on that letter and therefore you have to live with it.'"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.latestpolitics.com/blog/2007/05/ron-paul-and-race-continued.html | title=Ron Paul and Race, Continued | author=Ryan Sager | publisher=The New York Sun | date=2007-05-18 | accessdate=2007-05-20}} quoting from {{cite news | title=Dr. No | author=S.C. Gwynne | publisher=Texas Monthly magazine | date =October 2001}}</ref><ref name=texasmonthly2001/></blockquote> 	 

He further stated: 	 

<blockquote>"I could never say this in the campaign, but those words weren't really written by me. It wasn't my language at all. Other people help me with my newsletter as I travel around. I think the one on Barbara Jordan was the saddest thing, because Barbara and I served together and actually she was a delightful lady... we wanted to do something on affirmative action, and it ended up in the newsletter and became personalized. I never personalize anything."<ref name=texasmonthly2001/></blockquote> 	 

''Texas Monthly'' wrote in 2001, <cite>"What made the statements in the publication even more puzzling was that, in four terms as a U. S. congressman and one presidential race, Paul had never uttered anything remotely like this."</cite> They state that it would have been easier for him to deny the accusations at the time, because the controversy would have destroyed most politicians.<ref name=texasmonthly2001/>
