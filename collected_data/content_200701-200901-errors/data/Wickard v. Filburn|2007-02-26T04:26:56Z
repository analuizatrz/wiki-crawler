'''''Wickard v. Filburn''''', [[Case citation|317 U.S. 111]] ([[1942]]), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision interpreting the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which permits the [[United States Congress]] to "regulate Commerce . . . among the several States."

==Background of the case==
During the [[New Deal]], under the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]], the government imposed quotas on the production of a number of crops, including [[wheat]].  '''Roscoe Filburn''' was a farmer who produced wheat in excess of the amount permitted under the applicable production quota.  He argued that, because the excess wheat was produced for his private consumption on his own farm, it never entered commerce at all, much less interstate commerce, and therefore was not a proper subject of federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.

===Amount of wheat at issue===
Roscoe Filburn exceeded his production quota by 239 excess bushels.  To consume this amount in the form of bread, Mr. Filburn and his family would have had to consume nearly 44 one-pound loaves each day for the following year.[http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=901026]

==The Court's decision==
The Supreme Court rejected this argument, holding that Filburn's wheat competed with wheat sold in interstate commerce.  The Court reasoned that if Filburn had not used home-grown wheat, he would have had to buy wheat on the open market.  The Court held that Congress's power to regulate commerce was not limited to the supply side of commerce, but that it could regulate demand as well.  The Court also held that Congress could regulate wholly intrastate, non-commercial activity if such activity, viewed in the aggregate, would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, even if the individual effects are trivial.

Wickard has often been seen as marking the end to any limits on Congress's commerce clause powers.  One commentator has written: “In the wake of [[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation|Jones & Laughlin]] and Wickard [v. Filburn], it has become clear that . . . Congress has authority to regulate virtually all private economic activity.”<ref>Earl M. Maltz as quoted in footnote 223 of Jim Chen, [http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=901026  "Filburn's Legacy,"] 52 Emory Law Journal 1719 (2003)</ref>

==Subsequent jurisprudence==
In the landmark [[1995]] case of ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'', the first decision in six decades to invalidate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of [[Congress]] under the [[commerce clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], the Supreme Court described ''Filburn'' as "perhaps the most far reaching example of [[commerce clause]] authority over intrastate commerce."  The Supreme Court majority that decided the [[2005]] case ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' relied heavily on ''Filburn'' in upholding the power of the federal government to prosecute individuals who grow their own medicinal marijuana pursuant to state law.  In ''Gonzales'', the court held that, as with the home grown wheat at issue in ''Filburn'', home grown marijuana is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce.
