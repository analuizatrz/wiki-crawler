'''Natalie Clifford Barney''' ([[31 October]] [[1876]] &ndash; [[2 February]] [[1972]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[expatriate]] who lived, wrote, and hosted a literary [[salon (gathering)|salon]] in [[Paris]]. She was a [[poet]], [[memoir]]ist, and [[epigram]]matist, but believed her life was her true work of art. {{Fact|date=December 2007}}

Her salon, held at her home on Paris's [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]] for more than 60 years, brought together writers and artists from around the world, including many of the leading figures in French literature as well as the American and British [[Modernists]] of the [[Lost Generation]].  She worked to promote writing by women, forming a "Women's Academy" in response to the all-male [[French Academy]], while also providing support and inspiration to male writers from [[Remy de Gourmont]] to [[Truman Capote]].<ref>Schenkar, 161–181.</ref>

She was openly [[lesbian]] and began publishing love poems to women under her own name as early as 1900, considering scandal "the best way of getting rid of nuisances".<ref>Secrest, 275.</ref>  In her writings she supported [[feminism]], [[paganism]], and [[pacifism]].  She opposed [[monogamy]] and had many overlapping long- and short-term relationships, including an on-and-off romance with poet [[Renée Vivien]] and a 50-year relationship with painter [[Romaine Brooks]].  Her life and love affairs served as inspiration for many novels, ranging from the salacious French bestseller ''Sapphic Idyll'' to ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'', arguably the most famous lesbian novel of the 20th century.<ref>Barney's roles in ''Sapphic Idyll'' and ''The Well of Loneliness'' are discussed in Rodriguez, 94–95 and 273–275; regarding the fame of ''The Well'', see Lockard.</ref> 

==Early life==
[[Image:Natalie and Missal.jpg|thumb|left|Natalie Barney at about age 13, painted by Alice Pike Barney.]] 
Natalie Barney was born in 1876 to Albert Clifford Barney, son of a wealthy manufacturer of railway cars in [[Dayton, Ohio]], and [[Alice Pike Barney]].<ref>Rodriguez, 18–19.</ref>  When she was six years old her family spent the summer at [[New York]]'s Long Beach Hotel, where [[Oscar Wilde]] happened to be speaking on his American lecture tour.  Wilde scooped her up as she ran past him fleeing a group of small boys, held her out of their reach, then sat her down on his knee and told her a story.<ref>Rodriguez, 31.  Barney recounted this incident in ''Adventures of the Mind'', 31.</ref>  The next day he joined Barney and her mother on the beach; their conversation changed the course of Alice's life, inspiring her to pursue art seriously despite her husband's disapproval.<ref>Rodriguez, 30–31.</ref>  She later studied under [[Carolus-Duran]] and [[James McNeill Whistler]].<ref>Haskell.</ref>  Many of her paintings are now in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].<ref>''Alice Pike Barney: Biography''.</ref>

Like many girls of her time, Barney had a haphazard education.<ref>Rodriguez, 62.</ref>  Her interest in the [[French language]] began with a [[governess]] who motivated her by reading [[Jules Verne]]'s stories aloud, so that she had to learn quickly to understand them.<ref>Secrest, 262.</ref>  Later she and her younger sister [[Laura Clifford Barney]] attended Les Ruches, a French boarding school founded by feminist [[Marie Souvestre]].<ref>Rodriguez, 39.</ref>  As an adult, she spoke fluently and without an accent; she made her home in Paris, and nearly all her published works were written in French.

When she was ten, her family moved from Ohio to [[Washington, D.C.]], spending summers in [[Bar Harbor (town), Maine|Bar Harbor, Maine]].  As the rebellious and unconventional daughter of one of the wealthiest families in town, she was frequently mentioned in Washington newspapers.  In her early twenties she made headlines by galloping through Bar Harbor while driving a second horse on a lead ahead of her, and by riding astride instead of [[sidesaddle]].<ref>Rodriguez, 59–60, 191.</ref>

[[Image:Liane de Pougy postcard.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A postcard depicting [[Liane de Pougy]].]]
Barney said she knew by age 12 that she was lesbian,<ref>Rodriguez, 52.</ref> and was determined to "live openly, without hiding anything".<ref>Benstock, 272.</ref>  In 1899, after seeing the [[courtesan]] [[Liane de Pougy]] at a dance hall in Paris, she presented herself at de Pougy's residence in a page costume and announced that she was a "page of love" sent by [[Sappho]].  Although de Pougy was one of the most famous women in France, constantly sought after by wealthy and titled men, Barney's audacity charmed her.  Their brief affair became the subject of de Pougy's tell-all ''[[roman à clef]]'' ''Idylle Saphique'' (''Sapphic Idyll'').  Published in 1901, the book became the talk of Paris and was reprinted at least 69 times in its first year; soon it was well known that Barney was the model for one of the characters.  By that time, however, the two had already broken up, after quarreling repeatedly over Barney's desire to "rescue" de Pougy from her life as a courtesan.<ref>Rodriguez, 88–103.</ref>

Barney herself contributed a chapter to ''Idylle Saphique,'' in which she described reclining at de Pougy's feet in a screened box at the theater, watching [[Sarah Bernhardt]] play [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]].<ref>Rodriguez, 97.</ref>  During intermission Barney, as "Flossie", compares Hamlet's situation with that of women:  "What is there for women who feel the passion for action when pitiless Destiny hold them in chains?  Destiny made us women at a time when the law of men is the only law that is recognized."<ref>As translated in Wickes, 40.</ref>  She also wrote her own [[epistolary novel]] about the affair, ''Lettres à une Connue'' (''Letters to a Woman I Have Known'').  Although she failed to find a publisher for the book, and later called it naive and clumsy, it is notable for its discussion of [[homosexuality]], which Barney regarded as natural, comparing it to [[albinism]].<ref>Rodriguez, 95.</ref>  "My queerness", she said, "is not a vice, is not deliberate, and harms no one."<ref>As translated in Souhami (2005), 57.</ref>

== Renée Vivien ==
In November 1899 Barney met the poet Pauline Tarn, better known by her pen name [[Renée Vivien]].  For Vivien it was love at first sight, while Barney became fascinated with Vivien after hearing her recite one of her poems,<ref>Rodriguez, 105–106.</ref> which she described as "haunted by the desire for death".<ref>Barney, ''A Perilous Advantage'', 15.</ref>  Their romantic relationship was also a creative exchange that inspired both of them to write; Barney provided a feminist theoretical framework that Vivien explored in her poetry.  They adapted the imagery of the [[Symbolist]] poets and the conventions of [[courtly love]] to describe love between women, and found examples of heroic women in history and myth.<ref>Jay, xii-xiv.</ref>  [[Sappho]] was an especially important influence; they studied [[Greek language|Greek]] in order to read the surviving fragments of her poetry in the original, and both wrote plays about her life.<ref>Jay, 63, 67.</ref>

[[Image:Natalie Barney and Renee Vivien.jpg|thumb|left|Renée Vivien (left) and Natalie Barney posing for a portrait in [[1795-1820 in fashion|''Directoire''-era costume]].]]
Vivien saw Barney as a [[muse]]; as Barney put it, "she had found new inspiration through me, almost without knowing me."  Barney felt that Vivien had cast her as a ''[[femme fatale]]'' and that she wanted "to lose herself... entirely in suffering" for the sake of her art.<ref>Barney, ''A Perilous Advantage'', 19, 24–25.</ref>  Vivien also believed in [[fidelity]], which Barney was unwilling to agree to.  In 1901, while Barney was visiting her family in Washington, D.C., Vivien stopped answering her letters.  Barney tried for years to get her back, at one point persuading a friend, the operatic mezzo-soprano [[Emma Calvé]], to sing under Vivien's window so that she could throw a poem, wrapped around a bouquet of flowers, up to her on her balcony.  Both flowers and poem were intercepted and returned by a governess.<ref name="jay-11">Jay, 11–15.</ref>

In 1904 she wrote ''Je Me Souviens'' (''I Remember''), an intensely personal prose poem about their relationship, and presented a single handwritten copy to Vivien in an attempt to win her back.  They reconciled and travelled together to [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], where they lived happily together for a short time and talked about starting a school of poetry for women like the one that, according to tradition, Sappho had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before.  Soon, however, Vivien received a letter from her lover Hélène, the Baroness de Zuylen de Nyevelt, and decided to go to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] to break up with her in person.  She planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward, but instead she stayed with the Baroness.  This time the breakup was permanent.<ref name="jay-11" />  

In the following years Vivien's health declined rapidly.  According to [[Colette]], a friend and neighbor of Vivien's, she drank heavily—rinsing her mouth with perfumed water to conceal the extent of her drinking—and ate almost nothing.<ref>Colette, 83–103.</ref>  Colette's account has led some to refer to Vivien as [[anorexia nervosa|anorexic]],<ref>Jay, 19.</ref> though that diagnosis did not yet exist during her lifetime.  She was also addicted to the sedative [[chloral hydrate]].  In 1908 she attempted suicide by overdosing on [[laudanum]].<ref>Rodriguez, 116, 186–187.</ref>  She died the following year.  In a memoir written fifty years later, Barney said "She could not be saved.  Her life was a long suicide.  Everything turned to dust and ashes in her hands."<ref>Barney, ''Souvenirs Indiscrets'', quoted in Souhami (2005), 52.</ref>

== Poetry and plays ==
[[Image:Quelques Portraits-Sonnets de Femmes.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the 1900 edition of ''Quelques Portraits-Sonnets de Femmes''.]] 
In 1900 Barney published her first book, a collection of poems entitled ''Quelques Portraits-Sonnets de Femmes'' (''Some Portrait-Sonnets of Women'').  The poems used traditional French verse forms—Barney disapproved of [[free verse]]—and a formal, old-fashioned style.  They have been described as "apprentice work".  By publishing them, however, Barney became the first woman poet to openly write about love of women since Sappho.<ref>Rodriguez, 115.</ref> Her mother contributed pastel illustrations of the subjects of the poems, unaware that three of the four women who modeled for her were her daughter's lovers.<ref>Kling, 137.</ref>

Reviews were generally positive, glossing over the lesbian theme of the poems—or even misrepresenting it; the ''Washington Mirror'' said Barney "writes odes to men's lips and eyes; not like a novice, either."<ref>''Washington Mirror'', [[9 March]] [[1901]].  Quoted in Rodriguez, 121.</ref>  But a headline in a society gossip paper—"Sappho Sings in Washington"—alerted her father, who bought and destroyed the publisher's remaining stock and printing plates.<ref>Rodriguez, 123.</ref>

[[Image:Alice Pike Barney - Waterlily.jpg|thumb|left|''Waterlily'', a portrait of Barney's cousin Ellen Goin, was one of the illustrations for ''Quelques Portraits-Sonnets de Femmes''.]]
To escape her father's notice, Barney published her next book, ''Cinq Petits Dialogues Grecs'' (''Five Short Greek Dialogues'', 1901), under the [[pseudonym]] Tryphé.  The name came from the works of [[Pierre Louÿs]], who helped to edit and revise the [[manuscript]]; she also dedicated the book to him.  The first of the dialogues is set in ancient Greece and contains a long description of Sappho, who is "more faithful in her inconstancy than others in their fidelity"; another argues for [[paganism]] over [[Christianity]].<ref>Wickes, 50–52.</ref> Barney's father's death in 1902 left her with a substantial fortune, freeing her from any need to conceal the authorship of her books; she never used a pseudonym again.<ref>Rodriguez, 150–151.</ref>

''Je Me Souviens'' was published in 1910, after Vivien's death.<ref>Rodriguez, 203–204</ref>  The same year, Barney published ''Actes et Entr'actes'' (''Acts and Interludes''), a collection of short plays and poems.  One of the plays, ''Equivoque'' (''Ambiguity''), is a revisionist version of the legend of [[Sappho]]'s death: instead of throwing herself off a cliff for the love of the sailor [[Phaon]], she does so out of grief that Phaon is marrying the woman she loves.  The play incorporates quotations from Sappho's fragments, with Barney's own footnotes in Greek.<ref>Benstock, 291.</ref>

Barney did not take her poetry as seriously as Vivien did; she said "if I had one ambition it was to make my life itself into a poem."<ref>Barney, ''A Perilous Advantage'', 19.</ref>  Her plays were performed only in amateur productions in her garden; according to [[Karla Jay]], most of them lack coherent plots and "would probably baffle even the most sympathetic audience".<ref>Jay, 53.</ref>  After 1910 she primarily wrote the epigrams and memoirs for which she is better known.  A final book of poetry, ''Poems & Poemes: Autres Alliances'', appeared in 1920; it collected romantic poetry in both French and English.  Barney asked Ezra Pound to edit the poems, but ignored the detailed recommendations he made.<ref>Rodriguez, 255–256.</ref>

==Salon==
For over 60 years, Barney hosted a literary [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]—a weekly gathering at which people met to socialize and discuss literature, art, music, and any other topic of interest. Barney worked to feature women's writing while also hosting some of the most prominent male writers of her time; she brought together [[expatriate]] [[Modernists]] with members of the [[French Academy]]. Her salon was, according to Joan Schenkar, "a place where lesbian assignations ''and'' appointments with academics could coexist in a kind of cheerful, cross-pollinating, cognitive dissonance".<ref>Schenkar, 164–165; see also Rodriguez, 183.</ref>

The salon evolved from the gatherings Barney held at her house in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]] in the early 1900s, where the entertainment included poetry readings, theatricals (in which [[Colette]] sometimes performed), and once, a dance performance by [[Mata Hari]], who rode into the garden as [[Lady Godiva]] on a white horse harnessed with [[turquoise]] [[cloisonné]].<ref>Schenkar, 144.</ref>

[[Image:Atget - Pavillon at 20 Rue Jacob.jpg|thumb|right|The two-story ''pavillon'' at 20, Rue Jacob.]]
It may have been the play ''Equivoque'' that led to her leaving Neuilly in 1909.  According to a contemporary newspaper article, her landlord objected to her holding an outdoor performance of a play about Sappho, which he felt "followed nature too closely".<ref>''Dayton Journal'', [[1909]]-[[11-14]]. Quoted in Rodriguez, 172.</ref>  She cancelled her lease and rented the ''pavillon'' at 20, Rue Jacob in [[Paris]]'s [[Latin Quarter (Paris)|Latin Quarter]] where her salon was held until the late 1960s:  a small two-story house, separated on three sides from the main building on the street.  Adjoining the ''pavillon'' was a large, overgrown garden with a [[Doric order|Doric]] "Temple of Friendship" tucked into one corner.  In its new location the salon developed a more decorous outward face, focusing on poetry readings and conversation—in part because Barney had been told the ''pavillon's'' floors would not hold up to large dancing parties.<ref>Rodriguez, 177, and Schenkar, 195.</ref>  Frequent guests during this period included [[Pierre Louÿs]], [[Paul Claudel]], [[Philippe Berthelot]], and the translator [[J. C. Mardrus]].<ref>Wickes 108–109.</ref>

During [[World War I]], the salon became a haven for those opposed to the war.  [[Henri Barbusse]] once gave a reading from his anti-war novel ''Under Fire'', and Barney hosted a Women's Congress for Peace at the Rue Jacob.  Other visitors to the salon during the war included [[Oscar Milosz]], [[Auguste Rodin]], and the poet [[Alan Seeger]], who came while on leaves from the [[French Foreign Legion]] until his death in combat in 1916.<ref>Rodriguez, 221–223.</ref>

[[Image:Atget - Temple of Friendship at 20 Rue Jacob.jpg|thumb|left|The Temple of Friendship.]]
In the early 1920s, [[Ezra Pound]] was a frequent visitor and a close friend of Barney's.  The two schemed together to subsidize [[Paul Valéry]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] so they could quit their jobs and focus on writing; Valéry, however, found other [[patrons]], and Eliot refused the grant.  Pound introduced Barney to the [[avant-garde]] composer [[George Antheil]], and while her own taste in music leaned toward the traditional, she hosted premieres of Antheil's ''Symphony for Five Instruments'' and ''First String Quartet'' at the Rue Jacob.<ref>Rodriguez, 243–250.</ref>  It was also at Barney's salon that Pound met his longtime [[mistress (lover)|mistress]], the violinist [[Olga Rudge]].<ref>Conover, 2–3.</ref>

In 1927, Barney started an ''Académie des Femmes'' (Women's Academy) to honor women writers—a response to the influential French Academy, founded in the 17th century by [[Louis XIII]], whose 40 "immortals" included no women at the time. Unlike the French Academy, it was not a formal organization, but a series of readings held as part of the regular Friday salons.  Honorees included [[Colette]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Anna Wickham]], [[Rachilde]], [[Lucie Delarue-Mardrus]], [[Mina Loy]], [[Djuna Barnes]], and (posthumously) [[Renée Vivien]].<ref>Wickes, 153, 167.</ref>  

Other visitors to the salon during the 20s included French writers [[André Gide]], [[Anatole France]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Louis Aragon]], and [[Jean Cocteau]]; English-language writers [[Ford Madox Ford]], [[W. Somerset Maugham]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and [[William Carlos Williams]]; German poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]; Bengali poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], the first Nobel laureate from Asia; journalist [[Janet Flanner]], who defined the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' style; journalist, activist, and publisher [[Nancy Cunard]]; publishers [[Mary Phelps Jacob|Caresse]] and [[Harry Crosby]]; art collector and patron [[Peggy Guggenheim]]; [[Sylvia Beach]], the bookstore owner who published [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''; painters [[Tamara de Lempicka]] and [[Marie Laurencin]]; and dancer [[Isadora Duncan]].<ref>Rodriguez, 246–247.</ref>

[[Image:Natalie Barney - Aventures de L'Esprit.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''Aventures de l'Esprit''.]]
Barney drew a diagram for her 1929 book ''Aventures de l'Esprit'' (''Adventures of the Mind''), crowding over a hundred names of people who had attended the salon into a crude map of the house, garden, and Temple of Friendship.  The first half of the book contained reminiscences of 13 male writers she had known or met over the years; the second half devoted a chapter to each of the members of the ''Académie des Femmes''.<ref>Rodriguez, 260.</ref>  This gender-balanced structure was not reflected in the book's packaging, which listed seven of the male writers included in the book, then added "... and some women."

In the late 20s, [[Radclyffe Hall]] drew a crowd; her novel ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' had recently been banned in the UK.<ref>Flanner, 48.</ref>  A reading by the poet [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] packed the salon in 1932.  At another Friday in the 1930s, [[Virgil Thomson]] sang from ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'', an opera based on a libretto by Gertrude Stein.<ref>Rodriguez 249–50, 301.</ref>

Of the famous Modernist writers who spent time in Paris, [[Ernest Hemingway]] never made an appearance at the salon.  [[James Joyce]] came once or twice, but didn't care for it.  [[Marcel Proust]] never attended a Friday, though he did come to 20, Rue Jacob once to talk to Barney about lesbian culture as research for ''In Search of Lost Time''.  His visit had to be postponed repeatedly due to his poor health, and when it finally did happen, he was too nervous to bring up the subject he had come to discuss.<ref>Rodriguez, 250–251.</ref>

==Epigrams and novel==

''Èparpillements'' (''Scatterings'', 1910) was Barney's first collection of ''pensées''—literally, thoughts.  This literary form had been associated with salon culture in France since the 17th century, when the genre was perfected at the salon of [[Madeleine de Souvré, marquise de Sablé|Madame de Sablé]].<ref>Conley, 20.</ref>  Barney's ''pensées'', like de Sablé's own ''Maximes'', were short, often one-line [[epigrams]] or ''[[bon mot]]s'' such as "There are more evil ears than bad mouths" and "To be married is to be neither alone nor together."<ref>Barney, ''A Perilous Advantage'', 97.</ref>  

[[Image:Rouveyre - Le Philosophe Chez Ses Amies.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Remy de Gourmont with Elisabeth de Gramont and Natalie Barney in 1913.  Drawing by [[André Rouveyre]].]]
Her literary career got a boost after she sent a copy of ''Èparpillements'' to [[Remy de Gourmont]], a French poet, literary critic, and philosopher who had become a recluse after contracting the disfiguring disease [[lupus vulgaris]] in his thirties.<ref>Wickes (120), Rodriguez (190), and Jay (26) all refer to de Gourmont's condition simply as "lupus", but Denkiger (1148) and other French sources call it "''lupus tuberculeux''"—apparently lupus vulgaris, which is a form of tuberculosis of the skin, unrelated to [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], the disease now commonly known as lupus.</ref>  He was impressed enough to invite her to one of the Sunday gatherings at his home, at which he usually received only a small group of old friends.  She was a rejuvenating influence in his life, coaxing him out for evening car rides, dinners at the Rue Jacob, a masked ball, even a short cruise on the [[Seine]].  He turned some of their wide-ranging conversations into a series of letters that he published in the ''[[Mercure de France]]'', addressing her as ''l'Amazone,'' a French word that can mean either ''horsewoman'' or ''[[Amazons|Amazon]]''; the letters were later collected in book form.  He died in 1915, but the nickname he gave her would stay with her all her life—even her tombstone identifies her as "the Amazon of Remy de Gourmont"—and his ''Letters to the Amazon'' left readers wanting to know more about the woman who had inspired them.<ref>Rodriguez, 191–196, 199–201.</ref>

Barney obliged in 1920 with ''Pensées d'une Amazone'' (''Thoughts of an Amazon''), her most overtly political work.  In the first section, "Sexual Adversity, War, and Feminism", she developed [[feminism|feminist]] and [[pacifism|pacifist]] themes, describing war as an "involuntary and collective suicide ordained by man".<ref>Benstock, 296.</ref>  In war, she said, men "father death as women mother life, with courage and without choice".<ref>Jay, 29.</ref>  The epigrammatic form makes it difficult to determine the details of Barney's views; ideas are presented only to be dropped, and some ''pensées'' seem to contradict others.<ref>Rodriguez, 257–258.</ref>  Some critics interpret her as saying that the aggression that leads to war is visible in all male relationships.  Karla Jay, however, argues that her philosophy was not that sweeping, and is better summed up by the epigram "Those who ''love'' war lack the love of an adequate sport—the art of living."<ref>Rodriguez, 257; Benstock, 296; Jay, 29.</ref>

Another section of ''Pensées d'une Amazone'', "Misunderstanding, or Sappho's Lawsuit", gathered historical writings about homosexuality along with her own commentary.<ref>Rodriguez, 259.</ref>  She also covered topics such as alcohol, friendship, old age, and literature, writing "Novels are longer than life"<ref>Barney, ''A Perilous Advantage'', 118.</ref> and "Romanticism is a childhood ailment; those who had it young are the most robust."<ref>Barney, ''A Perilous Advantage'', 123.</ref>  A third volume, ''Nouvelles Pensées de l'Amazone'' (''New Thoughts of the Amazon''), appeared in 1939.

''The One Who is Legion, or A.D.'s After-Life'' (1930) was Barney's only book written entirely in English, as well as her only novel.  Illustrated by [[Romaine Brooks]], it concerns a [[suicide]], known only as A.D., who is brought back to life as a [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] being and reads the book of her own life.  This [[Fictional book|book-within-a-book]], entitled ''The Love-Lives of A.D.'', is a collection of hymns, poems and epigrams, much like Barney's own other writings.<ref>Benstock, 298–299.</ref>

== Major relationships ==
Barney practiced, and advocated, what would today be called [[polyamory]].  As early as 1901, in ''Cinq Petits Dialogues Grecs,'' she  argued in favor of multiple relationships and against jealousy;<ref>Rodriguez, 139</ref> in ''Èparpillements'' she wrote "One is unfaithful to those one loves in order that their charm does not become mere habit."<ref>Barney, ''A Perilous Advantage'', 103.</ref>  While she could be jealous herself, she actively encouraged at least some of her lovers to be [[nonmonogamy|nonmonogamous]] as well.<ref>Schenkar, 360.</ref>  

Due in part to Jean Chalon's early biography of her, published in English as ''Portrait of a Seductress'', she has become more widely known for her many relationships than for her writing or her salon.<ref>"I would be asked at dinner parties what I was working on and, replying, 'Natalie Clifford Barney,' I expected the usual post Jean Chalon response, 'What? The lesbian [[Don Juan]]?'"  Livia (1992), 181.</ref>  She once wrote out a list, divided into three categories:  liaisons, demi-liaisons, and adventures.  [[Colette]] was a demi-liaison, while the artist and furniture designer [[Eyre de Lanux]], with whom she had an off-and-on affair for several years, was listed as an adventure.  Among the liaisons—the relationships that she considered most important—were [[Olive Custance]], [[Renée Vivien]], [[Elisabeth de Gramont]], [[Romaine Brooks]], and [[Dolly Wilde]].<ref>Schenkar, 156, and Rodriguez, 298, give slightly different accounts of this list.</ref>  Of these, the three longest relationships were with de Gramont, Brooks, and Wilde; from 1927, she was involved with all three of them simultaneously, a situation that ended only with Wilde's death.  Her shorter affairs, such as those with Colette and [[Lucie Delarue-Mardrus]], often evolved into lifelong friendships.

=== Elisabeth de Gramont ===
[[Image:Elisabeth de Gramont - Nadar - 1889.jpg|thumb|right|Elisabeth de Gramont in 1889.]]
Elisabeth de Gramont, the [[Duchess]] of Clermont-Tonnerre, was a writer best known for her popular memoirs.  A descendant of [[Henry IV of France]], she had grown up among the aristocracy; when she was a child, according to Janet Flanner, "peasants on her farm... begged her not to clean her shoes before entering their houses".<ref>Flanner, 43.</ref>  She looked back on this lost world of wealth and privilege with little regret, and became known as the "red duchess" for her support of [[socialism]].  She was married and had two daughters in 1910, when she met Natalie Barney; her husband is said to have been violent and tyrannical.<ref>Rodriguez, 196–199.</ref>  They eventually separated, and in 1918 she and Barney wrote up a marriage contract stating that "[n]o one union shall be so strong as this union, nor another joining so tender—nor relationship so lasting."<ref name="rapazzini">Rapazzini.</ref> 

De Gramont accepted Barney's nonmonogamy—perhaps reluctantly at first—and went out of her way to be gracious to her other lovers,<ref>Rodriguez, 227–228</ref> always including Romaine Brooks when she invited Barney to vacation in the country.<ref>Secrest, 138.</ref>  The relationship continued until de Gramont's death in 1954.

=== Romaine Brooks ===
[[Image:Natalie Barney and Romaine Brooks.jpg|thumb|left|Natalie Barney and Romaine Brooks, circa 1915.]]
Barney's longest relationship was with the American [[painter]] Romaine Brooks, whom she met around [[1914]].  Brooks specialized in [[portraiture]] and was noted for her somber palette of gray, black, and white.  During the 1920s she painted portraits of several members of Barney's social circle, including de Gramont and Barney herself.  

Brooks tolerated Barney's casual affairs well enough to tease her about them, and had a few of her own over the years, but could become jealous when a new love became serious.  Usually she simply left town, but at one point she gave Barney an ultimatum to choose between her and Dolly Wilde—relenting once Barney had given in.<ref>Rodriguez, 295–301.</ref>  At the same time, while Brooks was devoted to Barney, she did not want to live with her as a full-time couple; she disliked Paris, disdained Barney's friends, hated the constant socializing on which Barney thrived, and felt that she was fully herself only when alone.<ref>Souhami (2005), 137–139, 146, and Secrest, 277.</ref>  To accommodate Brooks's need for solitude they built a summer home consisting of two separate wings joined by a dining room, which they called ''Villa Trait d'Union'', the hyphenated villa.  Brooks also spent much of the year in Italy or travelling elsewhere in Europe, away from Barney.<ref>Rodriguez, 227, 295.</ref> They remained devoted to one another for over fifty years.

===Dolly Wilde===
[[Dolly Wilde]] was the niece of [[Oscar Wilde]] and the last of her family to bear the Wilde name.  She was renowned for her epigrammatic wit but, unlike her famous uncle, never managed to apply her gifts to any publishable writing; her letters are her only legacy.  She did some work as a translator and was often supported by others, including Natalie Barney, whom she met in 1927.<ref>Schenkar, 7–14, 359.</ref>

Like Vivien, Wilde seemed bent on self-destruction.  She drank heavily, was addicted to heroin, and attempted suicide several times.  Barney financed [[detoxification]]s, which were never effective; she emerged from one nursing-home stay with a new dependency on the sleeping draught [[paraldehyde]], then available over-the-counter.<ref>Schenkar, 280–293.</ref>

In 1939 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and refused surgery, seeking alternative treatments.<ref>Schenkar, 269.</ref>  The following year, [[World War II]] separated her from Barney; she fled [[Paris]] for [[England]] while Barney went to [[Italy]] with Brooks.<ref>Rodriguez, 318.</ref>  She died in 1941 from causes that have never been fully explained, possibly a paraldehyde overdose.<ref>Schenkar, 37–48.</ref>

== World War II and after ==

Barney's attitudes during [[World War II]] have been controversial.  In 1937, Una, Lady Troubridge had complained that Barney "talked a lot of half-baked nonsense about the tyranny of [[fascism]]".<ref>Souhami (1999), 332.</ref>  Barney herself was one-eighth [[Jewish]], and since she spent the war in [[Italy]] with Romaine Brooks, risked deportation to a [[concentration camp]]—a fate she avoided only by wiring her sister Laura for a notarized document attesting to her [[confirmation]].  Nevertheless, having no other source of information about the war, she believed [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[propaganda]] that portrayed the [[Allies]] as the aggressors, so that pro-[[Fascism]] seemed to her to be a logical consequence of her [[pacifism]].  An unpublished memoir she wrote during the war years is  pro-Fascist and [[anti-Semitic]], quoting speeches by [[Hitler]] apparently with approval.<ref>Livia (1992), 192–193</ref>

It is possible that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used as evidence that she was not Jewish;<ref>Livia (1992), 191.  Rodriguez, 315, calls this a plausible theory.</ref> alternatively, she may have been influenced by [[Ezra Pound]]'s anti-Semitic radio broadcasts.<ref>Rodriguez, 317.</ref>  Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing passage on a ship to the United States.<ref>Livia (1992), 192–193</ref>  By the end of the war her sympathies had again changed, and she saw the Allies as liberators.<ref>Rodriguez, 326–327.</ref>

''Villa Trait d'Union'' was destroyed by bombing.  After the war, Brooks declined to live with Barney in Paris; she remained in Italy, and they visited each other frequently.<ref>Secrest, 368.</ref>  Their relationship remained [[monogamous]] until the mid-1950s, when Barney met her last new love, Janine Lahovary, the wife of a retired [[Romania]]n ambassador.  Lahovary made a point of winning Romaine Brooks's friendship, Barney reassured Brooks that their relationship still came first, and the triangle appeared to be stable.<ref>Rodriguez, 341–344.</ref>

[[Image:Carolus-Duran---Natalie-at-.jpg|thumb|right|This painting by [[Carolus-Duran]] of Natalie Barney at age ten hung on the wall of her salon at 20, Rue Jacob.<ref>Schenkar, 177.</ref>]]
The salon resumed in 1949 and continued to attract young writers for whom it was as much a piece of history as a place where literary reputations were made.  [[Truman Capote]] was an intermittent guest for almost ten years; he described the decor as "totally turn-of-the-century" and remembered that Barney introduced him to the models for several characters in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''.<ref>Wickes, 255–256</ref>  [[Alice B. Toklas]] became a regular after Gertrude Stein's death in 1946.  Fridays in the 1960s honored [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]] and [[Marguerite Yourcenar]], who in 1980—eight years after Barney's death—became the first female member of the French Academy.<ref>Rodriguez, 336, 353–4.</ref>

Barney did not return to writing epigrams, but did publish two volumes of memoirs about other writers she had known, ''Souvenirs Indiscrets'' (''Indiscreet Memories'', 1960) and ''Traits et Portraits'' (''Traits and Portraits'', 1963).  She also worked to find a publisher for Brooks's memoirs and to place her paintings in galleries.<ref>Souhami, 194.</ref>

In the late 1960s Brooks became increasingly reclusive and paranoid; she sank into a depression and refused to see the doctors Barney sent.  Bitter at Lahovary's presence during their last years, which she had hoped they would spend alone together, she finally broke off contact with Barney.  Barney continued to write to her, but received no replies.  Brooks died in December 1970, and Barney on [[February 2]], [[1972]].<ref>Rodriguez, 362–365.</ref>

==Legacy==
By the end of Barney's life her work had been largely forgotten.  Only in the 1980s did she begin to be recognized for what Karla Jay calls an "almost uncanny anticipation" of the concerns of later feminist writers.<ref>Jay, xv.</ref>  English translations of some of her memoirs, essays, and epigrams appeared in 1992, but most of her plays and poetry are still untranslated.

Her indirect influence on literature, through her salon and her many literary friendships, can be seen in the number of writers who have addressed or portrayed her in their works.  ''Claudine S'en Va'' (''[[Claudine and Annie]]'', 1903) by [[Colette]] contains a brief appearance by Barney as "Miss Flossie,"<ref>Wickes, 98.</ref> echoing the nickname she had earlier been given in de Pougy's novel ''Idylle Saphique''.  [[Renée Vivien]] wrote many poems about her, as well as a Symbolist novel, ''Une Femme M'Apparut'' (''A Woman Appeared to Me'', 1904), in which she is described as having "eyes ... as sharp and blue as a blade.... The charm of peril emanated from her and drew me inexorably."<ref>Jay, 9, 13.</ref>  [[Remy de Gourmont]] addressed her in his ''Letters to the Amazon'', and [[Truman Capote]] mentioned her in his last, unfinished novel ''[[Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel|Answered Prayers]]''.  She also appeared in two later novels by writers who never met her: Francesco Rapazzini's ''Un Soir chez l'Amazone'' (''An Evening with the Amazon'', 2004) is a historical novel about Barney's salon, while Anna Livia's ''Minimax'' (1991) portrays both her and Renee Vivien as still-living vampires.

According to Lillian Faderman, "There was probably no lesbian in the four decades between 1928 and the late 1960s capable of reading English or any of the eleven languages into which the book was translated who was unfamiliar with ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]''."<ref>Faderman, 322.</ref>  Although the novel's author, Radclyffe Hall, intended it as an argument for greater tolerance for what she called "[[Sexual inversion|sexual inverts]]", it has often been criticized by lesbian readers for its protagonist's self-hatred and its use of terms like "freak" and "mistake of nature".<ref>Love, 115–116.</ref>  Barney, as the salon hostess Valérie Seymour, appears in the novel as the symbol of a different attitude.<ref>Stimpson, 369–373.</ref>  "Valérie, placid and self-assured, created an atmosphere of courage; everyone felt very normal and brave when they gathered together at Valérie Seymour's."<ref>Hall, 352.</ref>

[[Lucie Delarue-Mardrus]] wrote love poems to Barney in the early years of the century, and in 1930 depicted her in a novel, ''L'Ange et les Pervers'' (''The Angel and the Perverts''), in which she said she "analyzed and described Natalie at length as well as the life into which she initiated me".  The [[protagonist]] of the novel is a [[hermaphrodite]] named Marion who lives a double life, frequenting literary salons in female dress, then changing from skirt to trousers to attend gay soirées. Barney is Laurette Wells, a salon hostess who spends much of the novel trying to win back an ex-lover loosely based on Renée Vivien.<ref>Livia (1995), 22–23.</ref> The book's portrayal of her is at times harshly critical, but she is the only person whose company Marion enjoys.  He/she tells Wells that she is "perverse... dissolute, self-centered, unfair, stubborn, sometimes miserly... [but] a genuine rebel, ever ready to incite others to rebellion.... [Y]ou are capable of loving someone just as they are, even a thief—in that lies your only fidelity.  And so you have my respect."<ref>Delarue-Mardrus, 80–81.</ref>

After meeting Barney in the 1930s, the Russian poet [[Marina Ivanovna Tsvetaeva]] addressed her in a ''Letter to the Amazon'' (1934) in which she expressed her conflicted feelings about love between women.  The result, according to [[Terry Castle]], is "an entirely cryptic, paranoid, overwhelming piece of reverie".<ref>Castle, 658.  English translations of Tsvetaeva's ''Letter to the Amazon'' can be found in Castle's anthology and in {{cite journal | last = Tsvetaeva | first = Marina | authorlink = | coauthors = trans. Sonja Franeta | title = Letter to an Amazon | journal = The Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | publisher = | date=  October 31, 1994 | url =  | pages = 9 }}</ref>

Barney and the women in her social circle are the subject of [[Djuna Barnes]]'s ''[[Ladies Almanack]]'' (1928), a ''[[roman à clef]]'' written in an archaic, [[Rabelaisian]] style, with Barnes's own illustrations in the style of [[Elizabethan]] [[woodcuts]].  She has the lead role as Dame Evangeline Musset, "who was in her Heart one Grand Red Cross for the Pursuance, the Relief and the Distraction, of such Girls as in their Hinder Parts, and their Fore Parts, and in whatsoever Parts did suffer them most, lament Cruelly".<ref>Barnes, 6.</ref>  "[A] Pioneer and a Menace" in her youth, Dame Musset has reached "a witty and learned Fifty";<ref>Barnes, 34, 9.</ref> she rescues women in distress, dispenses wisdom, and upon her death is elevated to sainthood.  Also appearing pseudonymously are Elisabeth de Gramont, [[Romaine Brooks]], [[Dolly Wilde]], [[Radclyffe Hall]] and her partner Una, Lady Troubridge, [[Janet Flanner]] and Solita Solano, and [[Mina Loy]].<ref>Weiss, 151–153.</ref>  The obscure language, inside jokes, and ambiguity of ''Ladies Almanack'' have kept critics arguing about whether it is an affectionate satire or a bitter attack, but Barney herself loved the book and reread it throughout her life.<ref>Barnes, xxxii-xxxiv.</ref>
