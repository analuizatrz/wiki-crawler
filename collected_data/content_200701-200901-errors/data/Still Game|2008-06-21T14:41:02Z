'''''Still Game''''' is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[sitcom]],  produced by [[The Comedy Unit]] with the [[BBC]], and created by [[Ford Kiernan]] and [[Greg Hemphill]], who also play the lead characters. Since its debut on [[September 1]], [[2002]], ''Still Game'' has shown [[List of Still Game episodes|forty four episodes]], including [[Christmas]] and [[Hogmanay]] specials.

The title refers to two [[Glasgow|Glaswegian]] [[pensioner]]s, named [[Jack Jarvis (Still Game character)|Jack Jarvis]] and [[Victor McDade]], and is set in the [[fictional]] [[Glasgow]] district of Craiglang. The show was broadcast first on [[BBC One Scotland]], as were series 2 and 3. Prior to its [[Still Game#Series 4 (2005)|fourth series]], ''Still Game'' received a UK-wide broadcast on [[BBC Two]]. The move has cemented the show's popular appeal across the UK, gaining critical acclaim and higher ratings than its neighbouring programmes on [[BBC Two|BBC Two Comedy Zone]]. 

==History==
[[Image:Stillgamecover.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The stage play of ''Still Game''|{{deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 12 March 2008}}]]
''Still Game'' started as a stage play, featuring three characters: Jack Jarvis, Victor McDade, and Winston Ingram. Due to a broken lift, the three men are stranded in Victor's flat, and discuss a variety of subjects ranging from death to sex. The stage play toured Scotland, [[England]], [[Ireland]] and [[Canada]] before returning to Glasgow, where it was filmed and released on video and DVD.

A small number of revisions accompanied Still Game's transition from stage to television. [[Gavin Mitchell (actor)|Gavin Mitchell]], who originally played Winston (and was replaced with Paul Riley for later performances), plays the part of Boabby the Barman in the series; and later characters, such as Tam Mullen and Isa Drennan, both mentioned briefly in the play, are fleshed out into supporting characters.

In 1998, Jack and Victor appeared in a number of skits in the tongue-in-cheek documentary about Scottish [[pop music]] called ''Och Around the Clock''. In these there are shown to be watching while sitting in Victor's flat. As with the [[Muppet]] characters of [[Statler and Waldorf]], their skits centred on the duo's disparaging comments about the performers.

The characters reappeared in Kiernan and Hemphill's sketch show ''[[Chewin' the Fat]]''. Nearly every episode of ''Chewin' The Fat'' featured Jack, Victor, Tam and Winston, with minor differences from their counterparts in the series. By the time ''Still Game'' became show in its own right, Winston's physical appearance had changed significantly, but was still played by [[Paul Riley]]. As the show has evolved, supporting characters like Winston, Isa and the local shopkeeper, Navid Harrid have attained greater centrality to storylines.

Even though they started the first series, Jack and Victor made their final appearance on Chewin' the Fat in the 2002 [[Hogmanay]] Special.

Still Game's sixth series ended on [[August 23]], [[2007]] on [[BBC Two]]. A Christmas Special was aired on [[BBC One Scotland]] on [[23 December]] at 10:15 pm. It was aired to the rest of the UK on [[BBC Two]] on [[28 December]] at 10:50 pm. There was also a [[Hogmanay]] special called "Hootenanny" aired on [[BBC One Scotland]], later aired to the rest of the UK on [[2 January]] [[2008]].

==Filming locations==
[[Image:theclansmanjennys.JPG|200px|left|thumb|The local [[pub]], Jenny's, as seen in ''"Hard Nuts"''.]]
Although ''Still Game'' is set in the fictional Craiglang area of [[Glasgow]], the [[Maryhill]] district of the city is one of the most common filming locations. The shops featured in the series can be found in the [[Townhead]] area of Glasgow. The [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] and its locks are used in background shots, as are the high-rise tower blocks, including the one in which Jack and Victor live called "Osprey Heights". For the first three series of the show, a real pub ("The Gimlet") in [[Ruchill]] was used to film the exterior shots of the pub Jenny's, previously The Clansman. However, between series three and four, the owner of the pub tore the building down, causing the fourth series production team to build an exterior in a set in Dumbarton, the same lot where ''[[River City]]'' is filmed. Scene interiors (Jack and Victor's flats, hallways and the interior of Navid's shop are specially constructed sets, built within a warehouse complex, now a Maryhill industrial estate (and called Craigmont Studios).

Finport, as mentioned and seen in the fifth series, was actually filmed on location in [[Largs]] and [[Saltcoats]], [[North Ayrshire]], both of which were once popular seaside resorts with Glaswegians. The shots of the promenade and the sea wall is that of Saltcoats' harbour area. The café that Jack and Victor walk past is The Melbourne Café in Saltcoats. The pub scene is set in the Royal Oak pub in Largs, while the [[bed and breakfast]], where Jack and Victor stay the night in, is located in the north end of Largs promenade. In the scene where Jack and Victor arrive on the bus from the right in Finport this actually leads from the sea, there is no road there. In the scene where Jack and Victor find Winston, a wide panning shot reveals the famous Nardini ice-cream building and the [[Caledonian MacBrayne]] ferry to [[Millport]].

== Series summaries ==
{{main|List of Still Game episodes}}

For the show's first three series, the broadcast of ''Still Game'' was limited to [[BBC One Scotland]]. The show was then moved to [[BBC Two]] for the fourth series and shown throughout the UK. On [[December 28]], [[2005]], ''Still Game'''s first [[Christmas television special|Christmas special]] was shown on [[BBC One]], the first national broadcast of the show on the channel. A fifth series of the show started filming in February 2006 and was shown the following June on BBC Two. As of 2006, series three had not been shown nationally, and only five episodes from the first two series were shown on national BBC Two from [[17 January]] to [[14 February]] [[2004]].

In the first three series, the episode titles were all [[Scots language]] words that were related to the episode. Starting from season four, the episodes were titled using standard English so that general audiences could understand them.

The events of ''Still Game'' take place in a [[floating timeline]] where the characters remain the same age from series to series. One of the most prominent examples of this is that Victor reveals that he is 74 years old in ''Scran'', an episode of the second series, but it is not until the fifth series (''Smoke On The Water'') that he celebrates his 75th birthday.

Referring to the fifth series' finale, the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' heralded for ''Still Game'' to be added to the ranks of the "greatest sitcoms ever". They called the episode "classic comedy" and said it was " a perfect mix of empathetic friendship, laugh-out-loud gags, real feeling in the acting and genuine warmth and chemistry between the characters".<ref name="daily record2">{{cite web | title=Daily Record | work=STILL GAME FOR A LAUGH, AND INTO THE BIG LEAGUE | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17457550&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=still-game-for-a-laugh--and-into-the-big-league--name_page.html | accessmonthday=August 4 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The Daily Record also revealed ''Still Game'' was trouncing rivals ''[[The Catherine Tate Show]]'' and [[Steve Coogan|Steve Coogan's]] ''[[Saxondale]]'' with 300,000 and 700,000 more viewers respectively.

He also commented that the sitcom "paints [Scotland] in broad strokes", through its use of [[stereotypes]].<ref name=theherald>{{cite web | title=The Herald | work=Grisly reality of the afterlife | url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/features/66465.html | accessmonthday= August 6 | accessyear= 2006}}</ref> TV Today praised the show for being "refreshing" in the age of dying sitcoms.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=July 2007}}
*Just before the fifth series started filming, a pest control team had to be called in to the Maryhill studio set when it was discovered that rats had infested Navid's shop and were eating their way through the stock. The alarm was raised after Jane McCarry (Isa) found a dead rat on the set, due to the close proximity of the ''[[Forth & Clyde Canal]]''<ref name="daily record3">{{cite web | title=Daily Record | work=A FORD IN THE RIVER | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16708129&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=a-ford-in-the-river--name_page.html/ | accessmonthday=August 4 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>
*The first 5 series were made by the Comedy Unit production company who also made ''Chewin' the Fat'' and ''[[Rab C. Nesbitt]]'', but after the Comedy Unit was sold, Greg and Ford decided to leave and go independent.
*In the episode "A Fresh Lick", Navid is distracted with the videotape in the back of the shop. The customer he is meant to be serving eventually says she will go to "Kohli's". This is a nod to Sanjeev Kohli, who plays the part of Navid. "Kohli's" is again mentioned in "Hot Seat".
*Scotland's [[2006 UEFA U-19 Championship (squads)#Scotland|under-nineteen football team]] were noted to have watched ''Still Game'' before going on to win against the [[2006 UEFA U-19 Championship (squads)#Czech Republic|Czech Republic]] in the [[2006 European Under-19 Football Championship]].<ref name=dailyrecord5>{{cite web | title=Daily Record | work=JACK AND VICTORY | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17457298&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=jack-and-victory--name_page.html | accessmonthday=August 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>
