'''Aberystwyth railway station''' is a [[railway station]] serving the seaside and university town of [[Aberystwyth]], [[Ceredigion]], [[Wales]].  It is served by passenger trains operated by [[Arriva Trains Wales]], being situated at the terminus of the [[Cambrian Line]], and also by the [[narrow-gauge]] [[Vale of Rheidol Railway]].

== History ==
The original station was built in the [[1860s]] by the [[Cambrian Railway]] to serve trains arrived on the now-closed route from [[Carmarthen Aberystwyth Line|Carmarthen to Aberystwyth]] via [[Lampeter]] and the route to [[Machynlleth]] which remains today.  The original railway station was greatly extended in [[1925]] with the original station building on one side of the platforms being replaced by a grand terminus building. This was built by the [[Great Western Railway]], to show the locals their power, and to reassure them that the GWR had a vested interest in maintaining the railway service in West Wales- something that had been called into question at the grouping when the Cambrian Railway which owned the station and all the lines into it had been absorbed by the larger, rather more faceless GWR, that had its headquarters far away in London.

With the decline of railway usage and of tourism within the United Kingdom the facilities were far too large for its purpose.  The railway yard was lifted in the [[1980s]], and the row of buildings along the front of it demolished in the 1990s to allow construction of a new retail park and bus station.  The 1925 station building has seen several uses, including as a local museum, but was eventually sold off and converted into a [[Wetherspoons]] pub.  This conversion maintained the architecture and won awards.  Other parts of the building have become an Indian restaurant, office space and accommodation for a local furniture-recycling scheme.

Aberystwyth Motive Power Depot was notable as being the last steam locomotive depot on the British Rail network; all steam services ceased in 1968 with the sole exception of the Vale of Rheidol line, which was steam operated until privatisation in 1989, and remains so today. Accordingly it was an often requested posting for staff.

==Today==
The station itself as of [[2006]] has a single mainline platform used by trains to [[Machynlleth]] with a loop that is used to reverse locomotive-hauled specials, including steam services and maintenance trains.  The second mainline platform had the track removed in [[1982]] and the signal box was also closed.  Access to the station and the station facilities are now primarily via the original [[1864]] building.

The platform that was originally used by trains via Lampeter to Carmarthen is now used by the narrow gauge [[steam locomotive|steam-operated]] [[Vale of Rheidol Railway]].  Opened in [[1902]],
this railway originally had its own terminus at ''Aberystwyth Smithfield'' (named after Smithfield Road, now Park Avenue).  This closed in [[1925]] and was replaced by a station a short distance from the main railway station; the station site is now a supermarket car park.  In [[1968]] it moved again, this time to use the now-free platform at the main Aberystwyth station where there is a runaround loop and access to the former mainline railway shed.  Nowadays this is used as the storage and works area by the Vale of Rheidol Railway.

== Services ==
Arriva Trains Wales services operate to [[Shrewsbury railway station|Shrewsbury]] and '''[[Birmingham New Street Station|Birmingham New Street]]''' approximately every 2 hours although there are proposals, funded by the Welsh Assembly, to increase the frequency of this service to hourly. They currently call at [[Borth]], [[Dovey Junction]], [[Machynlleth]], [[Caersws]], [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]], [[Welshpool]], [[Shrewsbury]], [[Wellington]], [[Telford Central]], [[Wolverhampton]], and [[Birmingham New Street]].
