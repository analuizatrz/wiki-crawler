'''Channel M''' is a television station which is based in [[Manchester]]. Originally named '''Manchester Student Television''', the channel's output is specifically designed for [[Greater Manchester]]. It began broadcasting on 14 February 2000.

The main sources of content used to be [[CHUM Limited|CHUM]], [[Euronews]], Channel M's own productions and the [[University of Salford]]. However, recently there has been considerable investment and the development of a raft of own developed content, focusing on news, music, lifestyle  and sport.

Owners of Channel M, The [[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] also operates [[The Guardian]], [[The Observer]] and [[The Manchester Evening News|The MEN]] from the '''MEN Media''' building in [[Spinningfields]], Manchester. It owns the '''Smooth''' and '''Century''' radio brands which operate in [[Greater Manchester]].

==Coverage==
As an [[Restricted Service Licence|RSL]] station Channel M was primarily available [[free to air]] in part of Greater Manchester. In 2004 Channel M launched on the [[NTL]] platform (now part of [[Virgin Media]]), but the biggest increase in viewership was when the channel launched on the [[Sky Digital (UK)|Sky Digital]] Satellite platform in April 2006. When the channel launched on Sky it was the first [[Restricted Service Licence|RSL]] channel to broadcast on satellite. This gave the television station UK-wide coverage on the BSkyB service. 

The channel can be received on analogue television, on channel 39 (615 MHz) in some western and southern areas of the conurbation, on [[Virgin Media]] Channel 878 around [[Greater Manchester]], [[Lancashire|Mid-Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]] and nationwide on [[Sky Digital (UK)|Sky]] channel 203. The service is not available on [[Freeview]].

The channel also become the first broadcaster in the region to offer its programmes on demand via broadband TV on its award-winning website. [http://www.channelm.co.uk]

==Channel M News==
The main focus for Channel M is its news and current affairs programming. The two-hour weekday evening news service '''Channel M News Live''' is broadcast between 1700-1900 and presented by Jess Dunsdon and Andy Crane. Before the two-hour service began on 17th September 2007, the programme was filmed at 1700 and was repeated half-hourly until 1900 and there was only one main anchor, usually Andy Crane. [[Manchester Evening News|MEN]] columnist, '''Channel M Breakfast''' and '''City Life''' Anchor Byron Evans also featured regularly as a Channel M News presenter until he became anchor of the breakfast programme.

'''Channel M News at Nine''' was launched in summer 2006 and was broadcast from 2100-2200, providing a more in-depth look at the area's news stories. This programme was anchored by Andy Crane and [[BBC Radio Manchester]] presenter Heather Stott until she returned to [[BBC North West Tonight]] to present the weather. Since 17th September 2007 this programme is now half of its original length and is filmed between 2100-2130 and repeated again at 2130-2200.

'''Channel M Breakfast''' broadcasts from 0600-0900 every morning. Bryon Evans, Nikki Dean & Nina Warhurst are usually the programme's anchors. Special guests, entertainment and sport editors are present on the sofa. The news headlines are normally read by Clare Fallon and the  traffic, travel and weather updates are usually read by Michelle "Totty" Totton. When the show started on Monday 16th April 2007 it replaced the [[Euronews]] feed, which broadcast on Channel M in the same timeslot. Euronews now broadcasts on Channel M from 0300-0600.

Channel M News bulletins are filmed at the Channel M News studio located in the [[Urbis]] museum in [[Manchester City Centre]]. Until [[August 2005]] the news service was broadcast from [[The Printworks]] entertainment complex which is nearby.  Due to a week-long exhibition at the [[Urbis]] building in January 2007, Channel M News was filmed from the newsroom of the [[Guardian Media Group|Guardian Media Group]]'s '''MEN Media''' Building in [[Spinningfields]], Manchester, where some of the news-gathering operations are based.

==Original Programming==
The channel's biggest audiences are for its news bulletins. Its sports programmes are also big draws. It is also renowned for its comedy talk-show [[Frank Sidebottom's Proper Telly Show]] and its music coverage. With these shows, the channel is starting to attract a lot of interest nationally{{Fact|date=September 2007}}. Something else which is attracting national interest is [[Re:Loaded]], the channel's computer and video game programme presented by [[Gerry McLaughlin]]{{Fact|date=September 2007}}. 

Sport programming such as '''Code XIII''', '''Talking Sharks''', '''FC United-The Fans' Club''', '''The Phoenix Ice Hockey Show''', '''Seconds Out''' and '''Inside MCFC''' broadcast news and content from Greater Manchester's sporting teams.

Entertainment programming is broadcast at the 8pm slot and throughout the daytime schedule. '''City Life''', '''Style In The City''', '''Cookin' Impossible''' and '''Fashion Face Off''' feature regularly. These show a mix of celebrity interviews; music, culture, food and fashion news from around Manchester.

'''Cookin' Impossible''' is a tongue-in-cheek cookery show in which Music Presenter and local celebrity gerry McLaughlin is set a culinary task and has to fulfil it. '''Style In The City''' is presented by Gemma Gofton and features the latest trends, hidden fahsion boutiques and fashion events in and around Manchester.

'''The Great Northern Music Show''','''City Centre Social''' and '''Saturday Social''' are Channel M's main music features and are usually presented by Gerry McLaughlin. These programmes usually show live or ''unplugged'' sets from [[Alternative rock|alternative]] and [[Indie (music)|indie]] bands. 

At 4pm and intervals throughout the day '''Channel M Playlist''' and '''Manchester Music''' are broadcast, which completely replaces the [[CHUM Television]]'s North American music output on the channel. This slot simply shows music videos, usually from the [[Alternative rock|alternative]] and [[Indie (music)|indie]] genres.

Travel-style magazine '''I Love Manchester''' is an hour-long review, showcasing an area of the Greater Manchester conurbation in each episode. The programme explores entertainment, fashion, food and a hidden side to parts of city. The programme has run for three series and is presented by former Breakfast anchor Steph Elmore, with a third series currently in development.

In terms of broadcast awards, [[University of Salford]] productions '''Hitting Home''' and '''Reel North''' have received multiple nominations from the [http://www.rts.org.uk Royal Television Society] since 2001, respectively winning Best Regional Current Affairs Programme in 2005 and Best Regional Programme in 2006.

==Advertising==
Channel M's extremely localised audience is unusual for a British television channel. This has promoted an opportunity for local advertising on a Greater Manchester-wide scale. 

The majority of the commercials shown on Channel M are produced by local companies attempting to attract this localised audience. One can recognise that many of these commercials are extremely low budget. Large companies like [[Ikea]] and [[dfs (retailer)|DFS]] have also advertised on Channel M, the former during the opening of Greater Manchester's first Ikea store in [[Ashton-Under-Lyne]]. Many of these adverts are also shown on [[ITV1|Channel 3]] in the [[Granada Television]] Region. Channel M offers businesses an opportunity to create a television advertisement, as the channel also films, edits and produces commercials.

==The Future==
Channel M's former dependence on imported programmes (mainly music and entertainment programming from Canadian [[CHUM Limited|CHUM]]) is down to the amount of Original programming created by Channel M. The Schedule is almost completely made up of Channel M In-House Productions with some films from the University Of Salford being shown later at night. The [[Euronews]] breakfast slot was moved back to early morning due to the creation of '''Channel M Breakfast''', making Channel M 24-Hour for the first time. 

Former [[BBC Radio Manchester]] host, [[Granada Television|Granada]] presenter and Factory Records boss [[Anthony Wilson]] was due to present a new Friday evening music and entertainment show called '''The New Friday''', produced by former Granada producer and [[BBC Radio Manchester]] host Eamonn O'Neill. However, this programme was postponed after Wilson became terminally ill with cancer. Wilson died on Friday 10th August 2007. '''The City Centre Social''' series presented by Gerry McLaughlin has filled this programming gap, and live music programmes seem to have become more dominant since the plans for '''New Friday''' had to be abandoned.

==Manchester Media==
[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] which is based at offices in the Spinningfields district of Manchester owns Channel M. Over the past two years, large amounts have been spent publicising Channel M in a billboard, taxi wrap-around, adshel and newspaper campaign. Channel M's news reporters liaise with journalists at GMG's The [[Manchester Evening News]], MEN Media's local weekly newspapers and GMG's Greater Manchester-based radio stations [[Smooth Radio]] and [[Century FM]]. This access is obviously advantageous to a relatively new television channel, it means that cross-reference advertising can be done for free and that newsgathering operation can be shared. An example of this cross referencing is that on the cover of the [[Manchester Evening News|MEN]] every day, there is a reference to a news feature or programme on Channel M that evening.

Other broadcasting headquarters in Manchester include [[ITV]] franchisee [[Granada Television]] which is located on Quay Street and [[BBC]]'s Northern England hub on [[Oxford Road, Manchester|Oxford Road]] where [[BBC North West|North West Tonight]] and [[BBC Radio Manchester]] are based. Piccadilly Radio 261's offspring [[Key 103]] and [[Magic 1152]] broadcast from [[Castlefield]]. 

In 2005, the channel won the "Best Newcomer" award at the [[Royal Television Society]] Awards.
