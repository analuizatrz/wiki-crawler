'''Paramore''' is a [[pop punk]] band from [[Franklin, Tennessee]]. 

== History ==
The [[Franklin, Tennessee]]-based band Paramore was formed by three members: brothers Zac and Josh Farro, and Hayley Williams. At the age of 13, Williams moved from her hometown of [[Meridian, Mississippi]] to the Nashville suburb, where she met the brothers. In the next few years, Paramore would begin to perform at venues outside the greater Nashville area, including the concert festivals [[Purple Door]] and [[Warped Tour]]. In April 2005, after being seen only once by a record executive for the music label [[Fueled by Ramen]], the band was offered a contract to produce a major market CD. 

Paramore's first United States headlining tour kicked off (joined by [[This Providence]], [[Cute Is What We Aim For]], and [[Hit the Lights (band)|Hit the Lights]]) on [[August 2]], [[2006]],  leading them across the country and ending with a hometown show in Nashville, Tennessee. They also toured the United Kingdom from [[October 5]], [[2006]] to [[October 15]], [[2006]], where they ended in London at The [[Mean Fiddler]].

Paramore covered [[Foo Fighters]]' "My Hero" for the ''[[Sound of Superman]]'' soundtrack, and Williams' voice has been featured on two tracks by other bands: "Keep Dreaming Upside Down" by [[October Fall]], as well as "Then Came To Kill" by [[The Chariot (band)|The Chariot]].

Paramore recorded their second album, ''[[RIOT!]]'', from December 2006 to March 2007. The band will be playing in the Warped Tour 2007 and had a headlining tour in April with [[This Providence]], [[The Almost]], and [[Love Arcade]].  They have stated that they will play about 3 new songs and confirmed the song "Hallelujah" would be on the new record. ''RIOT!'' which was released [[June 12]], [[2007]].

On March 12, 2007, Paramore announced through a [[LiveJournal]] update that Hunter Lamb had left the band to be with his fiancée. He has been replaced by Taylor York, a close friend,temporarily to help them with their performances on the [[Warped Tour]].

Paramore played on the Dimebag Darrell Stage at the Download Festival, Donnington on Friday the 8th of June, 2007.

Paramore's sophmore album "[[RIOT!]]" entered the Billboard 200 at #20 with over 42,000 units sold, marking the band’s best-ever sales week, and one of the highest sales and chart debuts for Fueled By Ramen (second only to Fall Out Boy).
