The '''SS ''Foundation Franklin''''' was a sea-going [[salvage]] vessel operated by [[Foundation Maritime]] between [[1930]]-[[1949]]. The ship was  built for the [[British Navy]] in [[1918]].

== History ==

The ''Foundation Franklin'' was built as [[HMS Frisky|HMS ''Frisky'']] by John Lewis and Sons Shipbuilding at [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]], in 1918. She was designed to move capitol warships, and operate in rough weather. 
The ship was commissioned in the spring of [[1919]], but the ending of  [[World War I]] ended the need for the HMS ''Frisky''. She was used to tow warships to [[Scapa Flow]] until being laid up. In 1924, the ship was sold and performed towing work on the [[Rhine River]] and in the [[Baltic Sea]]. The ''Frisky'' was later purchased by a German project intending to tow barges across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and renamed SS ''Gustavo Ipland'', but the project was destined to fall through. The former HMS ''Frisky'' then was laid up until 1930.<ref> {{cite book

The ship was purchased in January, 1930 at Hamburg, Germany by  [[Foundation Maritime]] representative Captain James Sutherland at Hamburg, Germany, Brought to Southampton for further refit and inspection the same year where she was registered under the the Red Ensign and given the name ''Foundation Franklin''. Brought to Foundation Maritime headquarters in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]] In 1931, she was further refitted by Halifax Shipyards for Atlantic salvage service.

Later, a homeport was established at Halifax, Nova Scotia on Lower Water Street.<ref> {{cite book

One of the most successful and hard-working vessels of her type, she continued to operate in the [[salvage]] role until [[1948]], when, during the tow of the vessel ''Arosa'' a hurricane damaged the ship beyond economical repair.

''Foundation Franklin'' was converted to from coal to fuel oil in 1945.
