'''Interlingua''' is an [[international auxiliary language]] (IAL) published in [[1951]] by the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] (IALA). It is the most widely used naturalistic [[auxiliary language]].<ref>Gopsill, F. P., ''International Languages: A Matter for Interlingua''. British Interlingua Society, 1990.</ref> Interlingua combines the vocabulary common to the major Western languages with a simple and regular grammar, making it understandable immediately to hundreds of millions of people. Interlingua's simplicity and international vocabulary make it unusually easy to learn. Conversely, Interlingua can be used to learn many other languages quickly and easily.<ref>Gopsill, F. P., ''International Languages: A Matter for Interlingua''. British Interlingua Society, 1990.</ref> 

== Rationale ==

[[Image:Map-Romance_Language_World.png|300px|right|thumb|Areas where a Romance language is commonly spoken are colored on the map. Interlingua should be well comprehensible to at least a large part of the more than <span style="white-space: nowrap">600 million</span> native Romance speakers alone.]]

The expansive movements of science, technology, trade, diplomacy, and the arts, combined with the historical dominance of the [[Latin language|Latin]] language has resulted in a large common vocabulary among Western languages. With Interlingua a systematic procedure was (and is) used to extract and standardize the most widespread word or words for a concept found in a set of ''control languages'': [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], with [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] as secondary references. Words from any language are eligible for inclusion, so long as their internationality is shown by their presence in these control languages. Hence, Interlingua includes such diverse word forms as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''geisha'' and ''tsunami'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''califa'', [[Aborigine|Aboriginal]] ''kanguru'', and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''sauna''. <ref>Gode, Alexander, et al.  [http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED.html ''Interlingua-English: a dictionary of the international language'']. Storm Publishers, New York, 1951.</ref>

Interlingua combines this pre-existing vocabulary with a minimal grammar based on the control languages. People with a good knowledge of a [[Romance language|Romance]] language, or a smattering of a Romance language plus a good knowledge of the ''[[international scientific vocabulary]]'' can frequently understand it immediately on reading or hearing it. Educated speakers of [[English language|English]] also enjoy this easy comprehension.<ref>See for example Sexton, Brian C., "Interlingua at first hearing," ''Lingua e Vita'', 1995, Issue 83.</ref> The immediate comprehension of Interlingua, in turn, makes it unusually easy to learn. Speakers of [[language|other language]]s can also learn to speak and write Interlingua in a short time, thanks to its simple grammar and [[Free word-building in Interlingua|regular word formation]] using a small number of [[root (linguistics)|roots]] and [[affix]]es.

Once learned, Interlingua can be used to learn other related languages quickly, and in some studies, even to understand them immediately. Research with [[Swedish language|Swedish]] students has shown that, after learning Interlingua, they can translate elementary texts from Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. In one study in 1974, an Interlingua class translated a Spanish text that students who had taken 150 hours of Spanish found too difficult to understand. Gopsill has suggested that Interlingua's freedom from irregularities allowed the students to grasp quickly the mechanisms of language.<ref>Gopsill, F. P., ''International Languages: A Matter for Interlingua''. British Interlingua Society, 1990.</ref>

Words in Interlingua retain their natural form; they are never distorted to fit a pre-existing grammar or set of rules. Each word retains its normal spelling, pronunciation, and meanings. For this reason, Interlingua is frequently termed a ''naturalistic'' IAL.

== History ==
=== International Auxiliary Language Association ===
Ultimate credit for Interlingua must go to the American heiress [[Alice Vanderbilt Morris]] (1874–1950), who became interested in [[linguistics]] and the [[international auxiliary language]] movement in the early 1920s. In [[1924]], Morris and her husband, David Hennen Morris, established the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in [[New York City]]. Their aim was to place the study of IALs on a scientific basis. Morris developed the research program of IALA in consultation with [[Edward Sapir]], [[William Edward Collinson]], and [[Otto Jespersen]].<ref>Falk, Julia S. "Words without grammar: Linguists and the international language movement in the United States, ''Language and Communication'', 15(3): pp. 241-259. Pergamon, 1995.</ref>

The IALA became a major supporter of mainstream American linguistics, funding, for example, Sapir's cross-linguistic semantic studies of totality (1930) and grading phenomena (1944). Morris herself edited Sapir and [[Morris Swadesh]]'s 1932 cross-linguistic study of ending-point phenomena, and Collinson's 1937 study of indication. Although the Morrises and their family provided most of IALA's funding, it also received support from such prestigious groups as the [[Carnegie Corporation]], the [[Ford Foundation]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].<ref>Gopsill, F. P., ''International languages: A matter for Interlinga.'' British Interlingua Society, 1990.</ref>

In its early years, IALA concerned itself with three tasks: finding other organizations around the world with similar goals; building a library of books about [[language]]s and [[interlinguistics]]; and comparing extant IALs, including [[Esperanto]], [[Esperanto II]], [[Ido]], [[Latino Sine Flexione]], [[Novial]], and [[Occidental language|Occidental]]. In pursuit of the last goal, it conducted parallel studies of these languages, with comparative studies of national languages, under the direction of scholars at American and European universities.<ref>Bray, Mary Connell. ''Interlingua-English Dictionary'' [Foreword]. New York, Storm Publishers, 1951.</ref> It also arranged conferences with proponents of these IALs, debating features and goals of their representative languages. With a "concession rule" that required participants to make a certain number of concessions, early debates at IALA sometimes grew from heated to explosive.<ref>Gopsill, F. P., ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. British Interlingua Society, 1990.</ref>

At the Second International Interlanguage Congress, held in [[Geneva]] in [[1931]], IALA began to break new ground. Its conference was attended by recognized linguists, 27 of whom signed a testimonial of support for IALA's research program. An additional eight added their signatures at the third congress, convened in [[Rome]] in [[1933]].<ref>Gopsill, F. P., ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. British Interlingua Society, 1990.</ref>

Also in 1933, Professor [[Herbert N. Shenton]] of [[Syracuse University]] organized an intensive study of the problems encountered with interlanguages when used in international conferences. Later that same year, Dr. [[Edward L. Thorndike]] published a paper about the relative learning speeds of "natural" and "modular" constructed languages. Both Shenton and Thorndike were major influences on IALA's work from then on.<ref>Bray, Mary Connell. ''Interlingua-English Dictionary'' [Foreword]. New York, Storm Publishers, 1951.</ref>

In [[1937]], the first steps towards the finalization of Interlingua were taken when a committee of 24 eminent linguists from 19 universities published ''Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary''. However, the outbreak of [[World War II]] in [[1939]] cut short the intended biannual meetings of the committee.<ref>Gopsill, F. P., ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. British Interlingua Society, 1990.</ref>

===Development of a new language===
Originally, the association had not set out to create its own language. Its goal was to identify which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it most effectively. However, after ten years of research, more and more members of IALA concluded that none of the existing [[interlanguage]]s were up to the task. By [[1937]], the members had made the decision to create a new language, to the surprise of the world's interlanguage community.

To that point, much of the debate had been equivocal on the decision to use naturalistic (e.g., [[Novial]] and [[Occidental]]) or systematic (e.g., [[Esperanto]] and [[Ido]]) words. During the war years, proponents of a naturalistic interlanguage won out. The first support was Dr. Thorndike's paper; the second was a concession by proponents of the systematic languages that thousands of words were already present in many &ndash; or even a majority &ndash; of the European languages. Their argument was that systematic derivation of words was a [[Procrustes|Procrustian bed]], forcing the learner to unlearn and re-memorize a new derivation scheme when a usable vocabulary was already available. This finally convinced supporters of the systematic languages, and IALA from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best.

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], IALA's research activities were moved from Liverpool to New York, where [[Ezra Clark Stillman|E. Clark Stillman]] established a new research staff. Stillman, with the assistance of Dr. [[Alexander Gode]], developed a ''prototyping'' technique &ndash; an objective methodology for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of ''control languages''.

In [[1943]] Stillman left for war work and Gode became Acting Director of Research. In [[1945]], IALA published a ''General Report'' &ndash; largely Morris's work &ndash; which presented three models for IALA's language:
* Model P was a naturalistic model that made no attempt to regularize the prototyped vocabulary. 
* Model E was lightly schematicized along the lines of [[Occidental]].
* Model K was moderately schematicized along the lines of [[Ido]] (i.e., somewhat less schematicized than [[Esperanto]]).

From [[1946]] to [[1948]], the renowned French linguist [[André Martinet]] was Director of Research. During this period IALA continued to develop models and conducted polling to determine the optimal form of the final language. An initial survey gauged reactions to the three models of 1945. In 1946, IALA sent an extensive survey to more than 3,000 language teachers and related professionals on three continents.

Four models were canvassed: Model P and K, plus two new models similar to Model E of 1945.

|- valign=top
| &nbsp; || colspan=3 | (modern Interlingua) || &nbsp; ||''Io ha nascite, o dea con le oculos azur, de parentes barbar, inter le bon e virtuose Cimmerios''
|}

Model P was unchanged from 1945; Model K was slightly modified in the direction of [[Ido]].

The results of the survey were striking. The two more schematic models, C and K, were rejected &ndash; K overwhelmingly. Of the two naturalistic models, M attracted somewhat more support than P. Taking national biases into account (for example, the French who were polled disproportionately favored Model M), IALA decided on a compromise between models M and P, with certain elements of C.

===Finalization===
When Martinet took up a position at [[Columbia University]] in 1948, Gode took on the last phase of Interlingua's development.  His task was to combine elements of Model M and Model P; take the flaws seen in both by the polled community and repair them with elements of Model C as needed; and simultaneously develop a vocabulary.

The vocabulary and verb conjugations of Interlingua were first presented in [[1951]]. That year, IALA published the finalized ''[[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|Interlingua Grammar]]'', the 27,000-word ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary]]'' ([[IED]]), and an introductory manual entitled ''Interlingua a Prime Vista'' ("Interlingua at First Sight").

===Success, decline, and resurgence===
 
An early practical application of Interlingua was the scientific newsletter ''Spectroscopia Molecular'', published from 1952 to 1980.<ref>Breinstrup, Thomas, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/publicationes/spectroscopia.htm "Un revolution in le mundo scientific" (A revolution in the scientific world).] Accessed January 16, 2007.</ref> In 1954 Interlingua was used at the Second World Cardiological Congress, in [[Washington DC]], for both written summaries and oral interpretation. Within a few years, it found similar use at nine further medical congresses. Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, some thirty scientific and especially medical journals provided article summaries in Interlingua. [[Science Service]], the publisher of ''Science Newsletter'' at the time, published a monthly column in Interlingua from the early 1950s until Gode's death in 1970. In 1967, the powerful [[International Organization for Standardization]], which normalizes terminology, voted almost unanimously to adopt Interlingua as the basis for its dictionaries.<ref>Gopsill, F. P., ''International Languages: A Matter for Interlingua''. British Interlingua Society, 1990.</ref>

The [[International Auxiliary Language Association|IALA]] closed its doors in 1953 but was not formally dissolved until 1956 or later.<ref>Esterhill, Frank, [http://www.interlingua.org/html/copy_of_ii-history.htm#_ednref19 ''Interlingua Institute: A History''. New York: Interlingua Institute, 2000.]</ref> Its role in promoting Interlingua was largely taken on by Science Service,<ref>F. P., and Sexton, B. C., [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-3.htm Gopsill, "Le natura, si &ndash; un schema, no".] Accessed January 16, 2007.</ref> which hired Gode as head of its newly formed [[Interlingua Division of Science Service|Interlingua Division]].<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/gode.htm Biographias: Alexander Gottfried Friedrich Gode-von Aesch]. Accessed January 16, 2007</ref> [[Hugh E. Blair]], Gode's close friend and colleague, became his assistant.<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/blair.htm Biographias: Hugh Edward Blair.] Accessed January 16, 2007</ref> A successor organization, the Interlingua Institute,<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/organisationes.htm Portrait del organisationes de interlingua.] Access January 16, 2007.</ref> was founded in 1970 to promote Interlingua in the US and Canada. The new institute supported the work of other linguistic organizations, made considerable scholarly contributions and produced Interlingua precis for scholarly and medical publications. One of its largest achievements was two immense volumes on phytopathology produced by the American Phytopathological Society in 1976 and 1977.<ref>Esterhill, Frank, [http://www.interlingua.org/html/copy_of_ii-history.htm ''Interlingua Institute: A History''.] New York: Interlingua Institute, 2000.</ref> 

The Interlingua Institute was adrift for a while after the deaths of Blair in 1967 and Gode in 1970. According to Esterhill,<ref>Esterhill, Frank, [http://www.interlingua.org/html/copy_of_ii-history.htm ''Interlingua Institute: A History''.] New York: Interlingua Institute, 2000.</ref> however, publishing slowed only briefly in the late 1960s and revived soon afterward, at about the time of the 1971 second edition of the IED. Flourishing interest in [[Europe]] may have counterbalanced the struggles taking place in America.

Interlingua had attracted many former adherents of other international-language projects, notably [[Occidental]] and [[Ido]]. The former Occidentalist [[Richard Berger|Ric Berger]] founded The [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] ([[UMI]]) in 1955,<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/organisationes.htm Portrait del organisationes de interlingua.] Accessed January 16, 2007.</ref> and by the late 1950s, interest in Interlingua in Europe had already begun to overtake that in North America. Media coverage at the time, for example, was apparently heaviest in Northern and [[Eastern Europe]]. Frequent European coverage has continued to date, joined by media attention in [[South America]] in the early 1990s <ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/publicationes/pressa.htm Interlingua in le pressa.] Accessed January 17, 2007.</ref>.
 
Beginning in the 1980s UMI has held international conferences every two years (typical attendance at the earlier meetings was 50 to 100) and launched a publishing programme that eventually produced over 100 volumes. Other Interlingua-language works were published by university presses in [[Sweden]] and [[Italy]], and in the 1990s, [[Brazil]] and [[Switzerland]]<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/libros/pt.htm Bibliographia de Interlingua.] Accessed January 16, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/stenstrom.htm Biographias: Ingvar Stenström.] Accessed January 16, 2007</ref>. Several [[Scandinavia]]n schools undertook projects that used Interlingua as a means of teaching the international scientific and intellectual vocabulary.

In 2000, the Interlingua Institute was dissolved amid funding disputes with the UMI; the American Interlingua Society, established the following year, succeeded the institute and responded to new interest emerging in [[Mexico]].<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/organisationes.htm Portrait del organisationes de interlingua.] Accessed January 16, 2007.</ref>

===Behind the Iron Curtain===

Interlingua was spoken and promoted in the Communist empire, in spite of persecution and efforts to suppress information about the language. In [[East Germany]], communist officials confiscated the letters and magazines that the UMI sent to Walter Raédler, the Interlingua representative there.<ref>"Interlingua usate in le posta". [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/stampaspostal.htm Historia de Interlingua], 2001, revised 2006.</ref> In [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Július Tomin]] received threatening letters after his first article on Interlingua was published.<ref>Breinstrup, Thomas. "Persecutate pro parlar Interlingua." ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', 1995, Issue 5.</ref> Despite continuing persecution, he went on to become the Czech Interlingua representative, teach Interlingua in the school system, and author a long series of published articles and books.<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/tomin.htm Biographias: Július Tomin. Historia de Interlingua, 2001.] Revised 2006.</ref>

===Today===
: ''See also: [[#Community|Community]]'' 

Today, interest in Interlingua has expanded from the scientific community to the general public. Individuals, governments, and private companies use Interlingua for learning and instruction, travel, online publishing, and communication across language barriers. Interlingua is promoted internationally by the [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] (president: Barbara Rubinstein, Sweden; secretary-general: Petyo Angelov, [[Bulgaria]]). Periodicals and books are produced by many national organizations, such as the [[Societate American pro Interlingua]] (president: Dr. [[Stanley Mulaik]]), the Svenska Sällskapet för Interlingua (secretary: Ingvar Stenström), and the [[Brazilian Union for Interlingua]] (president: Gilson Passos).

Currently, [[Panorama In Interlingua]] is the most prominent of several Interlingua periodicals. It is a 28-page magazine published bimonthly that covers current events, science, editorials, and Interlingua. Thanks to the Internet, Interlingua has seen a resurgence over the last decade, with the number of speakers jumping tenfold by some estimates.

== Vocabulary ==
{{See also|Free word-building in Interlingua|Interlingua dictionaries}}

The IALA set up a control group of seven [[Romance language|Romance]], German, and [[Slavic languages]] with much shared vocabulary, grouped into six units: [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]]/[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (treated as one unit), and [[English language|English]], with [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] as alternatives. A word is eligible for Interlingua if it occurs with similar meanings in three or more of these units. Self-explanatory compounds can be included with support from at least one control language. In the rare case when this procedure fails, grammatical words, required to operate the language, are taken from [[Latin]].

The form of an Interlingua word is the most recent form common to the historical or hypothetical words from which the national words evolved. ''Derivativational series'', or series of words formed by suffixes, are also considered. The French ''oeil'', Italian ''occhio'', Spanish ''ojo'' and Portuguese ''olho'', 'eye', appear quite different, but they descend from a historical form ''oculus''. This, and international derivatives like ''ocular'' and ''oculista'', determine the form ''oculo'' to be used in Interlingua.

New words can be derived internally &ndash; that is, from existing Interlingua words &ndash; or extracted from the control languages in the manner of the original vocabulary. Internal word-building, though freer than in the control languages, is more limited than in schematic IALs. Most Interlingua dictionaries include only words with support in the control languages.

Interlingua as now used tends to have less [[Classical Latin]] vocabulary than  IALA's original version, replaced in part by southern Romance vocabulary.  For example ''emer'' ('to buy') has been mostly replaced by ''comprar''; ''sed'' ('but') with ''ma''; and ''nimis'' ('too') with ''troppo''. However, other classical Latin words, such as ''pro'' 'for', ''contra'' 'against', ''post'' 'after' and ''ergo'' 'therefore' are retained because they are seen as more internationally understandable than their Romance counterparts.

Unassimilated words of foreign origin retain the spelling, pronunciation, and plurals of the original languages: ''affaire'', ''bureau(x)'', ''software'', ''interview(s)'', ''defait(s)'', ''cheque'', ''standard(s)'', ''test(s)'', ''schizzo'', ''rancho'', ''kümmel'', ''cappuccino'' (optional plural ''cappuccini''). Many users tend to substitute regular plurals, however, especially in less common words.

===Orthography and pronunciation===

Interlingua uses the standard Latin alphabet with all its 26 letters and in general no diacritics. Keeping with its naturalistic design philosophy, Interlingua does not have a particularly [[phonemic orthography]] by international auxiliary language standards even if one were to consider [[digraph]]s as separate [[grapheme]]s. On the other hand, this same naturalism also grants a considerable latitude to any prospective speaker when choosing the particular [[allophone]] to realize a phoneme allowing for the influence of his or her native language habits as long as it all remains within reason and doesn't hinder communication. An important thing to point out is that unstressed vowels should never be pronounced as a schwa ([ə]) as could be the tendency of a speaker with an English language background.

For the most part, [[consonant]]s are pronounced as in English, while the [[vowel]]s are like Spanish or Italian. Four vowel pairs (<ai>, <au>, <eu>, <oi>{{fact}}<!-- citation only requested for the last diphthong -->) are pronounced as falling [[diphthong]]s ({{IPA|/ɑi/, /ɑu/, /eu/, /oi/}}). Exceptions are as follows:

* <c> is "soft" ({{IPA|/ts/}}) before <e>, <nowiki><i></nowiki>, or <y>; otherwise "hard" {{IPA|/k/}}.
* <ch> is most often {{IPA|/k/}} and is used before <e>, <nowiki><i></nowiki>, or <y> or in words of Greek origin.
* <g> is "hard" ({{IPA|/g/}}), except in the sequences -<age> and -<agi>- (preceding a vowel), where it has the sound of French <j> ({{IPA|/ʒ/}}).
* <h> is silent in the combinations <rh> and <nowiki><th></nowiki> ({{IPA|/ɾ/}} and ({{IPA|/t/}}).
* <nowiki><i></nowiki> is like English <y> {{IPA|/j/}} before another vowel, unless stressed (<union> {{IPA|/u'njon/}}, <via> {{IPA|/'viɑ/}}).
* <j> is French <j> ({{IPA|/ʒ/}}).
* <q> is {{IPA|/k/}} and occurs almost exclusively in the combination <qu> {{IPA|/kw/}}. 
* <ph> is {{IPA|/f/}} in words of Greek origin.
* <r> is lightly rolled or trilled {{IPA|/ɾ/, /r/}}, as in Italian or Spanish.
* <ti> becomes {{IPA|/tsj/}} before a vowel, unless the <nowiki><i></nowiki> is stressed or in the combination -<sti>- (<nation> {{IPA|/nɑ'tsjon/}}; but <politia> {{IPA|/po.li'tiɑ/}}, <question> {{IPA|/kwe'stjon/}}.
* <nowiki><u></nowiki> is {{IPA|/w/}} before another vowel, unless stressed (<continuar> {{IPA|/kon.ti'nwɑɾ/}}, <duo> {{IPA|/'du.o/}}.
* <y> has the same value as <nowiki><i></nowiki>

Double consonants are pronounced as single (<fila> {{IPA|/'fi.lɑ/}}, <illa> {{IPA|/'i.lɑ/}}).

=== Alternative pronunciations ===

Alternative pronunciations are permitted for some letters and combinations:

* Some speakers pronounce "soft" <c> as {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/tʃ/}} rather than {{IPA|/ts/}}.
* <h> is optionally silent in all positions.
* Many speakers pronounce <j> and "soft" <g> like English <j> {{IPA|/dʒ/}}.
* <p> is optionally silent in initial ''pn-, ps-,'' and ''pt-''.
* <qu> is pronounced as {{IPA|/k/}} before <e> or <nowiki><i></nowiki> by some speakers. Almost all speakers pronounce the particles <que> and <qui> as {{IPA|/ke, ki/}}.
* <nowiki><s></nowiki> may be voiced {{IPA|[z]}} between two vowels. <ss> is always {{IPA|/s/}}.
* Some speakers pronounce the "soft" <ti> as {{IPA|/sj/}} rather than {{IPA|/tsj/}}. A few keep it "hard" ({{IPA|/tj/}}).
* <x> may be voiced {{IPA|[gz]}} between two vowels.

=== Stress ===

The ''general rule'' is that stress falls on the vowel before the last consonant (e.g., ''l'''i'''ngua, ess'''e'''r, requirim'''e'''nto'', 'language', 'to be', 'requirement'), and where that isn't possible, on the first vowel (''v'''i'''a'', 'way', '''''i'''o cr'''e'''a'', 'I create'). There are a few exceptions, and the following rules account for most of them: 

* Adjectives and nouns ending in with a vowel followed by ''-le, -ne,'' or ''-re'' are stressed on the third-last syllable (''fr'''a'''gile, m'''a'''rgine, '''a'''ltere'' 'other', but ''illa imp'''o'''ne'' 'she imposes').
* Words ending in ''-ica/-ico, -ide/-ido'' and ''-ula/-ulo,'' are stressed on the third-last syllable (''pol'''i'''tica, scient'''i'''fico, r'''a'''pide, st'''u'''pido, cap'''i'''tula, s'''e'''culo'' 'century').
* Words ending in ''-ic'' are stressed on the second-last syllable (''c'''u'''bic'').
* The addition of a plural suffix doesn't change the stress of a noun (''cant'''o'''n'', ''cant'''o'''nes'').
* Verbs in the future tense are stressed on the final ''-a'' (''io scribe'''ra''''' 'I shall write').
* Verbs in the conditional tense are stressed on the second-last syllable (e.g. ''il esse'''re'''a sage'' 'it would be wise').

Users may pronounce all words according to the general rule mentioned above. For example, ''kilom'''e'''tro'' is acceptable, although ''kil'''o'''metro'' is preferred for etymological reasons.

=== Loanwords ===

Like its source languages, Interlingua has a number of words that can be considered to be unassimilated [[loanword]]s of foreign origin; they exhibit traits that deviate from the norm presented in this section. They can be pronounced differently than the spelling suggests, even exhibiting foreign sounds like the [[voiceless velar fricative]] [x] and the [[close front rounded vowel]] [y], or the spelling may contain [[diacritic]]s or other marks. If, however, the diacritics would be superfluous given the pronunciation system of Interlingua, they are removed.

== Grammar ==
{{details|Interlingua grammar}}

The grammar of Interlingua is similar to that of the Romance languages, but greatly simplified, primarily under the influence of English. If a grammatical feature was absent from at least one of the primary control languages, it was dropped. Thus, Interlingua has no noun-adjective agreement (Spanish and Portuguese ''gatos negros'', 'black cats'), since this is absent from English, and no progressive verb tenses (English ''I am reading''), since they are absent from French. The definite article ''le'' is invariable, as in English.

Nouns have no grammatical [[gender]]. Plurals are formed by adding ''-s'', or ''-es'' after a final consonant (for a final ''c'', add ''-h-'' and then ''-es''). [[Pronouns]] take only two forms: one for the subject and indirect object, and the other for the direct object.  Most [[adverb]]s are derived regularly from [[adjective]]s by adding ''-(a)mente''.

The verb system is a simplified version of the systems found in the Romance languages. Verbs take the same form for all persons (''io, tu, illa vive'', 'I live', 'you live', 'she lives'). The only exceptions are some optional forms for ''esser'', 'to be'. The [[indicative]] (''pare'', 'appear', 'appears') is the same as the [[imperative]] (''pare!'' 'appear!'), and there is no [[subjunctive]]. Three common verbs usually take short forms in the present tense: ''es'' for 'is', 'am', 'are;' ''ha'' for 'has', 'have;' and ''va'' for 'go', 'goes'. A few irregular verb forms are available, but rarely used.

There are four simple tenses/moods (the present, past, and future tenses and the conditional mood) and four compound tenses/moods/voices (the past and future tenses, the conditional mood, and the passive voice). These compound structures employ an auxiliary plus the infinitive or the past participle (e.g., ''Ille ha arrivate'', 'He has arrived'). Simple and compound tenses can be combined in various ways to express more complex tenses (e.g., ''Nos haberea morite'', 'We would have died'). See [[Interlingua grammar]].

Word order is essentially Subject–Verb–Object, except that direct object pronouns come before the verb (''Io les vide'', 'I see them') as in the Romance languages. Adjectives may precede or follow the nouns they modify, but they most often precede it. The position of adverbs is flexible, though constrained by common sense.

== Community ==
It's not certain how many people have an active knowledge of Interlingua, but their numbers have grown consistently over most of the past half-century. As noted above, Interlingua is the most widely spoken naturalistic [[auxiliary language]]. While Panorama sometimes reports on native speakers of Interlingua, their numbers are currently unknown.{{fact}}

Interlingua's greatest advantage is that it is the most widely ''understood'' [[International Auxiliary Language]] (IAL) by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.

Interlingua has active speakers on all continents, especially in [[South America]] and in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Northern Europe]], most notably [[Scandinavia]]; also in [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. In [[Africa]], Interlingua has official representation in the [[Republic of the Congo]]. There are copious Interlingua web pages, including editions of Wikipedia and Wiktionary, and a number of periodicals, including ''Panorama in Interlingua'' from the [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] (UMI) and magazines of the national societies allied with it. There are several active mailing lists, and Interlingua is also in use in certain [[Usenet]] newsgroups, particularly in the europa.* hierarchy. Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.<ref>"Radioemissiones in e re Interlingua," ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', Issue 3, 2006.</ref> Interlingua was the "secret language" in the television series ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,'' which aired from 1964 to 1968.<ref>Lingua secrete de agentes in TV, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/themanfromuncle.htm Historia de Interlingua, 2001], Revised 2006.</ref> In recent years, samples of Interlingua have also been seen in music and anime.

Interlingua is taught in many high schools and universities, sometimes as a means of teaching other languages quickly, presenting [[interlinguistics]], or introducing the international vocabulary. The prestigious [[University of Granada]] in [[Spain]], for example, offers an Interlingua course in collaboration with the Centro de Formación Continue.<ref>"A notar," ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]],'' Issue 4, 2006.</ref>

Every two years, the UMI organizes an international conference in a different country; the most recent conference ([[2005]]), in [[Sweden]], was attended by slightly over 250 people. In the year between, the Scandinavian Interlingua societies co-organize a conference in Sweden. National organizations such as the Union Brazilian pro Interlingua also organize regular conferences.

== Criticisms and controversies ==
{{see also|Irregularities and exceptions in Interlingua|Ido and Interlingua compared}}

While Interlingua is a successful auxiliary language, it has been criticised, often by proponents of other auxiliary languages, which usually focus on issues it was never meant to address. This may be partly because both opponents and supporters see Interlingua as a candidate for being ''the'' universal second "<u>neutral</u>" language for the world to use.

Being a European-based language, Interlingua is not easily presented as a neutral language for the whole world instead of just [[Europe]] or the [[Western world]], although one could argue that favoring some with the choice of vocabulary would be acceptable as long as it wouldn't make it harder for others to learn. Speakers of languages other than [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] have an additional disadvantage.

Conversely, Interlingua has been suggested as a useful language for study as an introduction to Indo-European languages in general, and Romance languages in particular. In fact, Interlingua has been taught at Swedish high schools for this purpose.

One point of criticism that does take Interlingua's design goals into account is that its credential as being "[[Standard Average European]]" is too weak outside the Romance languages. Some opponents see the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], and [[Celtic languages]], in particular, as having little influence. 

Proponents point out that Interlingua's source languages include not only Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the source languages are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of their words also appear in other languages &ndash; still more when derivative forms and [[loan translation]]s are included. Tests showed that if a larger number of source languages were used, the results would be about the same. So, IALA  selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality. In addition, the grammar of Interlingua is still simpler than most or all Indo-European languages, contributing to ease of learning.

Finally, other auxiliary languages have a mix of words that is similar to Interlingua's, but accidentally hidden. Wordforms are frequently altered to fit pre-established rules of grammar and orthography. For example, all accusative adjectives might end in ''-en'', or the letter ''x'' might be replaced by combinations such as ''gz'' and ''ks''. In addition, some schematic languages contain words that look unfamiliar because they are entirely invented. Thus, the linguistic mix of the schematic auxiliary languages is not so much sweeping and inclusive as difficult to make out.

The [[Lord's Prayer]]:

: ''Nostre Patre, qui es in le celos,''
: ''que tu nomine sia sanctificate;''
: ''que tu regno veni;''
: ''que tu voluntate sia facite''
: ''super le terra como etiam in le celo.''
: ''Da nos hodie nostre pan quotidian,''
: ''e pardona a nos nostre debitas''
: ''como nos pardona a nostre debitores,''
: ''e non duce nos in tentation,''
: ''sed libera nos del mal.''

From an essay by Alexander Gode:

:''Interlingua se ha distachate ab le movimento pro le disveloppamento e le introduction de un lingua universal pro tote le humanitate. Si o non on crede que un lingua pro tote le humanitate es possibile, si o non on crede que interlingua va devenir un tal lingua es totalmente indifferente ab le puncto de vista de interlingua mesme. Le sol facto que importa (ab le puncto de vista de interlingua mesme) es que interlingua, gratias a su ambition de reflecter le homogeneitate cultural e ergo linguistic del occidente, es capace de render servicios tangibile a iste precise momento del historia del mundo. Il es per su contributiones actual e non per le promissas de su adherentes que interlingua vole esser judicate.''<ref>''Novas de Interlingua'', May/June 1958.</ref>

:Interlingua has detached itself from the movement for the development and introduction of a universal language for all humanity. Whether or not one believes that a language for all humanity is possible, whether or not one believes that Interlingua will become such a language is totally irrelevant from the point of point of view of Interlingua itself. The only fact that matters (from the point of view of Interlingua itself) is that Interlingua, thanks to its ambition of reflecting the cultural and thus linguistic homogeneity of the West, is capable of rendering tangible services at this precise moment in the history of the world. It is by its present contributions and not by the promises of its adherents that Interlingua wishes to be judged.
