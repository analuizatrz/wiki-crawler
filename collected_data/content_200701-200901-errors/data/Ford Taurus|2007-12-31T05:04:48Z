The '''Ford Taurus''' is an [[automobile]] manufactured by the [[Ford Motor Company]] in the [[United States]]. Initially a [[front-wheel drive]] [[mid-size car]], it was introduced in December 1985, replacing the [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Ford LTD]]. Today's Taurus is a [[full-size car]] available in front- or [[all-wheel drive]]. The Taurus was mainly sold in North America, but the third generation model was exported to [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]] in a slightly modified form. Throughout its life, the Taurus has had a [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] sibling, the [[Mercury Sable|Sable]]. Most Tauruses have been built in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] or in Ford's Hapeville Plant near [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

The original Taurus was a milestone design for Ford and the entire American automotive industry, as well as a very influential vehicle in the marketplace. Ford has sold over 6.7&nbsp;million Tauruses worldwide during its 20 years of production.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Mayne | first = Eric | date = [[2005-05-19]] | url = http://www.detnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0504/19/C01-154989.htm | title = End of Ford Taurus closes era | publisher = The Detroit News | accessdate = 2007-08-22}}</ref> Between 1992 and 1996, the Taurus was the best-selling car in the [[United States]], prompting [[Honda]] to grow the U.S. version of the [[Honda Accord|Accord]] to a similar size.<ref name = "bestselling">{{Cite web | last = DiPetro | first = John | date = [[2003-04-18]] | publisher = Edmunds | url = http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46007 | title = Inside Line: Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable | accessdate = 2006-05-29}}</ref> The Taurus eventually lost its best-seller status in 1997 to the [[Toyota Camry]].<ref name = "det">{{Cite news | url = http://www.detnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0504/19/C01-154989.htm | last = Mayne | first = Eric | date = [[2005-04-19]] | publisher = [[Detroit News]] | title = End of Ford Taurus closes era | accessdate = 2006-05-16}}</ref>

==Development==
[[Image:Taurusdesign2.jpg|thumb|right|Taurus clay model along with many of the original design sketches.]]

When Ford set out to develop the Taurus, they employed a strategy of teamwork that would prove revolutionary in the car development process.<ref name = "Taub">{{Cite book | title = Taurus: The Making of the Car That Saved Ford | first = Eric | last = Taub | year = 1991 | month = November | isbn = 0525933727 | publisher = [[E. P. Dutton]]}}</ref> Previously, at both Ford and [[General Motors]], interior and exterior designers worked separately with no input from each other or from engineers. As a result, the interiors and exteriors of many American cars seemed "mismatched".<ref name = "Taub"/> Taurus development started in 1981, using a method similar to that Ford used when developing the [[Ford Escort (North American)|Escort]], in which engineers from all Ford branches worldwide worked together.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Visnic | first = Bill | date = [[1996-03-01]] | publisher = Ward's Autoworld | url = http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_escort_fords_years/ | title = Escort: Ford's 15 years on a learning curve | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> Unlike the Escort, though, the Taurus was developed entirely by American engineers at Ford's headquarters.<ref name = "Taub"/> The new engineering team was assembled by designer [[Jack Telnack]], and was dubbed "Team Taurus".<ref name = "Taub"/>

The Taurus went through many revisions throughout its development. Original prototypes contained a full glass roof similar to that of the [[Subaru SVX]], though it was deemed "too radical" and abandoned.<ref name = "Taub"/> Customer input played an instrumental role in the Taurus' development, as many components including [[radio]]s, [[steering wheel]]s, [[seat]]s, [[wheel]]s, and entire [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] setups were selected by large numbers of average people though a series of surveys conducted by Ford.<ref name = "Taub"/> In addition, Ford disassembled many competing cars such as the [[Toyota Camry]], the [[Honda Accord]], and the more luxurious [[BMW E28|BMW 5 Series]] in order to examine their parts and components.<ref name = "Taub"/>

Ford premiered the Taurus in a resounding way. In mid-1985, Ford gathered executives and the press for the unveiling of the Taurus and Mercury Sable. The event took place at the [[MGM Studios]] Soundstage 85, where ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' had been filmed.<ref name = "Taub" /> The studio was decorated in a space theme, with stars on the walls, [[Unidentified flying object|flying saucer]] decorations, and refreshments served in flying saucer shaped coolers.<ref name = "Taub" /> For the unveiling, "space" music started playing, as projected stars floated around the room in dance floor fashion. The outlines of the cars glowed green through the curtain; as the curtain flew up, strobe lights flashed, highlighting the cars.<ref name = "Taub"/> Many industry journalists, as well as executives at Ford and [[Chrysler]], believed the Taurus was going to be a failure.<ref name = "Taub"/> Chrysler executives believed customers would instead embrace their more conventional [[Dodge Dynasty]] and [[Chrysler New Yorker]].<ref name = "Taub"/> Executives at Ford knew producing the Taurus was a gamble, as they ran the risk of the car being so advanced it would turn off potential customers. As a result, Ford continued to produce the LTD, which the Taurus was designed to replace in 1986.<ref name = "Taub"/> If the Taurus failed, Ford would have to file for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]].<ref name = "Taub"/> The Taurus, however, ended up being a resounding success, selling over a million units in its first generation alone.<ref name = "Taub"/>

The first-generation Taurus was launched in 1986 to strong fanfare and sales, replacing the slow-selling LTD. Upon the Taurus' debut, Ford was producing a range of rear-wheel drive cars, as [[Chrysler]] and [[General Motors]] offered more front-wheel drive vehicles. With the introduction of the [[Ford Tempo|Tempo]], Ford had started its own transition to front-wheel drive. The Taurus displayed a rounder shape than its contemporaries, often likened to a '[[jelly bean]]' or 'flying potato',<ref name = "jellybean">{{cite web | last = Schneiderman | first = R.M. | date = [[2006-10-27]] | publisher = Forbes | url = http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2006/10/27/ford-taurus-demise-cx_rs_1027autofacescan01.html | title = Ford Taurus, R.I.P.| accessdate = 2007-06-29}}</ref> inspired by the design of the [[Audi 100#C3, 1983–92|Audi 5000]] and Ford's own Tempo. The aerodynamic design of the Taurus was not purely cosmetic, however. Its aerodynamic shape made the car more fuel efficient, allowing Ford to meet the more stringent [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) standards applied by the [[United States]] government.<ref name = "Taub"/> The Taurus' success ultimately led to an American [[automobile design]] revolution; Chrysler and General Motors developed aerodynamic cars in order to capitalize on the Taurus' success.<ref name="Taub"/>

The Taurus and Sable used flush aerodynamic composite [[headlights]], and were the first mainstream sedans from a U.S. automaker to use the new lights. Instead of a conventional [[grille]], the Taurus had a front panel to adopt a grille-less 'bottom breather' nose, first pioneered by the [[Citroën DS]] in the 1950s, and also used briefly on the Mustang. Some special performance models were fitted with additional ventilation openings. The Sable twin had a wraparound "lightbar" with two headlights and a low-wattage stretch in between. The doors went into the roof, and the handles were recessed. The Taurus also had large glass areas, which were flushed into the body, not recessed. 

The interior was available with bucket seats, a rare feature for most American mid-size sedans at the time, and the [[dashboard]] wrapped around the driver and flowed into the door panels to create more of a "cockpit" feel.<ref name = "bestselling"/> The interior contained many innovations, such as a storage box on the rear shelf,<ref name = "G1" /> seats designed to provide maximum comfort for their occupant no matter what position they were in,<ref name = "Taub" /> and a rear seat that was raised slightly higher than the front seat so rear passengers could see the road ahead of them.<ref name = "Taub" />

[[Image:89-91 Ford Taurus wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1989-1991 Ford Taurus wagon]]

The Taurus originally came in four models, MT-5, L, GL, and LX. The MT-5 and L models were basic, starting at [[USD|US$]]10,500, with the GL offering a few interior upgrades like rear headrests and a folding armrest, as well as the standard 3.0&nbsp;litre V6.<ref name = "bestselling" /> The LX was loaded with [[air conditioning]], [[power window]]s, power seats, electric door locks, a cassette stereo and [[cruise control]], although these features were also available as options on the other cars. The top-of-the-line LX [[station wagon]] sold for $14,300.<ref name = "bestselling" />

For 1986, the engines were a 90&nbsp;horsepower (67&nbsp;kW) 2.5&nbsp;litre ''[[Ford HSC engine|HSC]]'' four-cylinder found in the [[Manual transmission|MT-5]] and L models or a new 140&nbsp;horsepower (104&nbsp;kW) 3.0&nbsp;litre [[Ford Vulcan engine|Vulcan]] [[V6 engine|V6]], optional on the L and standard on the GL and LX models. The MT-5 was equipped with a five-speed [[manual transmission]], Vulcan models used a newly-designed four-speed [[Ford AXOD transmission|AXOD]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]], while HSC-equipped cars used the 3-speed [[Ford ATX transmission|ATX]] automatic. Ford's 3.8&nbsp;litre [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|Essex]] [[V6 engine|V6]] was added to the lineup in 1988. Although the power output was rated at the same 140&nbsp;horsepower (104&nbsp;kW) as the 3.0&nbsp;litre engine, this V6 produced 215&nbsp;ft•lbf (291&nbsp;N•m) of [[torque]]. However, the 3.8 is known for premature failure of [[head gasket]]s.<ref name = "bestselling" />

In 1990, the interior received a facelift, incorporating a new [[steering wheel]] design with an [[airbag]], a new [[gear shift]]er and a new [[dashboard]] with a new instrument panel.<ref name = "G1" /> The 2.5&nbsp;litre four was given [[sequential fuel injection]], increasing power by 15&nbsp;horsepower (11.2&nbsp;kW) and torque by 10&nbsp;ft•lbf (13.6&nbsp;N•m), as did the 3.0&nbsp;litre V6, although output remained the same for that engine.<ref name = "Engines" /> All but the SHO were fitted with a four-speed automatic for 1990 and a new electronic [[Ford AXOD-E transmission|AXOD-E]] transmission in 1991. LX cars were also fitted with [[anti-lock brake]]s as standard that year.<ref name = "bestselling"/>

===First generation SHO===
[[Image:Taurus-SHO-2.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Taurus SHO with the "Plus" package]]

In 1989, Ford added the performance-oriented SHO model, which stands for "Super High Output".<ref name = "G1" /> This was substantiated by a [[Ford SHO V6 engine|Yamaha 3.0 L]] [[V6]] that made 220 hp and 200 ft·lbf.  Although Ford's reasons for creating the SHO are unclear, it is best known that it was created to use up engines that were meant for a competitor for the [[Toyota MR2]] and [[Pontiac Fiero]] that was shelved in the middle of development.<ref name="SHONTELL">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordmuscle.com/archives/2005/08/SHOnTell/|title=SHO n Tell|publisher=Jon Mikelonis and Matt Wilder|accessdate=2006-07-28}}</ref> As a result, Ford initially advertised the SHO as a limited production vehicle.<ref>{{cite video | people = Ford Motor Company | title = 1989 Ford Taurus SHO commercial | publisher = Ford Motor Company | url = http://www.retrojunk.com/details_commercial/4176/ | date = [[2007-07-19]]}}</ref> However, the SHO turned out to be more successful than Ford had expected, and production continued after 1989.<ref name = "SHONTELL" />

The SHO differed from the normal Taurus on the exterior by having different bumpers, side cladding, fog lamps, and a rear spoiler. The interior also differed, with sports seats and an 8000&nbsp;rpm [[tachometer]]. The SHO became the only Taurus to feature a [[manual transmission]] since the MT5 was discontinued in that year.<ref name = "G1">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G1/index.html |title=Generation 1 Spotter's Guide |publisher=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher= Taurus Car Club of America |date= |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>

A special edition of the SHO called the Plus package became available in 1991. It came as part of option package #212A and contained different styling cues from the standard SHO, including a plastic 'Power Bulge' hood, a plastic spoiler without the 3rd brake light, 24V V6 badges, body colored molding, non-painted mirrors, body color TAURUS badge, and non-SHO 'slicer' wheels.  There were two special sub-options to the Plus package: White painted cars came with white painted wheels, and a plus exclusive Jade Green (sometimes called Deep Jade Green) was available only in 1991.<ref name="shotimes">{{cite web|url=http://www.shotimes.com/php-bin/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0&sid=20|title=The 1991 SHO "Plus" Option|publisher=SHOTIMES mailing list|accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>

The Taurus received its first significant cosmetic update in 1992. With the older model facing slumping sales, this new model brought sales back up again, with 410,000 examples sold during 1992, a number unheard of even today.<ref name="det" /> While the design was basically the same, every body panel except for the roof was changed. Ford also gave the Taurus what they called a 'smarter appointed interior',<ref>{{cite video | people = Taurus Car Club of America | title = 1992 Ford Taurus Advertisement (Stencil) | publisher = Ford Motor Company | url = http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Articles/Ads/92_Stencil.wmv | date = [[2007-07-19]]}}</ref> which offered such luxuries as [[Air conditioning|electronic automatic climate control]] (an option for the LX and, later, SE; standard on SHO models), power sliding [[moonroof]], leather seats, as well as other features. Wagon versions that retained the front bench seat and were equipped with the optional rear facing third seat had seating capacity for eight passengers. The Taurus was the best-selling car in the United States for every year of this cosmetic update.<ref name= "bestselling"/>
[[Image:2nd-Ford-Taurus-GL-wagon-rear.jpg|thumb|left|1992 Taurus GL wagon. The base model Tauruses had grey bumpers and side trim for 1992 only. In 1993, these parts became color keyed, just like in the higher model Tauruses.]]
The 2.5L four-cylinder engine had been eliminated after 1991, making the 3.0&nbsp;litre V6 standard in all non-SHO models (except the LX Wagon, which had the 3.8L standard) from 1992-on. The next year (1993), the cheaper L base model was dropped, as well as the "InstaClear" [[Defroster|heated windshield]] and the front [[cornering lamp]]s on LX models.<ref name = "TCCA" /> For both 3.0L and 3.8&nbsp;litre V6 engines, the drive belt system became a single-belt setup for 1993 (previously, the alternator had used a separate belt). A passenger-side airbag became standard for 1994, including a redesigned drivers side airbag and steering wheel (though this newer look had been on the SHO since 1993).<ref name = "TCCA" /> Also for 1994, all wheel options were now 15&nbsp;inches. Previously, 14&nbsp;inch wheels were standard on GL models. For 1994 and 1995, the LX model received unique crystiline headlamps.<ref name = "Consumerguide">{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1995-ford-taurus.htm |title=1990–1995 Ford Taurus Review |publisher=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>

The last year of this updated Taurus generation was 1995. For the 1995 model year, a sportier ''SE'' model was added.<ref name = "TCCA" /> It featured alloy wheels which were borrowed from the LX, had combination leather/cloth bucket seats separated by a console, unique "Crystalline" headlamp assemblies also borrowed from the LX, and a rear deck lid "lip" [[spoiler]] borrowed from the SHO.<ref name = "TCCA" /> The SE trim had either the standard 3.0L Vulcan V6 or the optional 3.8L Essex V6.<ref name = "TCCA" />

The second generation also came in a modified [[Police]] version. A police Taurus was a GL trim with the 3.8&nbsp;litre Essex V6 engine that was slightly different than the regular Essex engine.<ref name = "Engines">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Engine/index.html |title=Ford Taurus engines |publisher= |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date= |accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> The police version of this engine uses high silicone [[alloy]] [[piston]]s which can be identified by two notches in the top of the piston. Output of the police Essex version was 15&nbsp;bhp greater than the standard due to the addition of a dual [[exhaust]] muffler system, similar to that standard on the SHO; a Y-pipe was added after the resonator which allowed for the split to both sides of the rear of the vehicle.<ref name = "Wolfe">{{cite web |url=http://www.denniswolfe.com/Taurus/Police.htm |title=Tauruses serving the community |publisher=Denniswolfe.com/Taurus |publisher=Denniswolfe.com |date= |accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> Other changes included a larger [[fuel tank]], stainless steel [[brake line]]s, standard 4-wheel disc [[brake]]s with ABS, a modified front grille fascia that had a slit in it to allow for increased airflow to the radiator, and a calibrated 140&nbsp;mph [[speedometer]].<ref name = "TCCA" />

===Second generation SHO===
[[Image:Ford Taurus SHO (second-gen).jpg|thumb|left|A second generation SHO]]
The SHO model continued with the same powertrain as before: The Yamaha-developed 3.0L V6 and 5-speed manual transmission. The second generation SHO also got its own front fascia that was basically the Mercury Sable's front fascia with a different bumper, fog lamps, and no middle lightbar.<ref name="TCCA">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G2/index.html |title=Generation 2 Spotters Guide |publisher=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2006-12-18 |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> The SHO also got unique seats, wheels, side cladding, dual exhaust, as well as a unique rear bumper. 

The lack of an automatic transmission had hurt sales, which was a situation that Ford rectified in 1993. A 3.2&nbsp;L version of the [[Ford SHO V6 engine]] was introduced for automatic-equipped SHO, which still had 220&nbsp;hp (164&nbsp;kW), but now boasted 215&nbsp;ft•lbf (292&nbsp;N•m), a 15&nbsp;ft•lbf (20.3&nbsp;N•m) increase over the 3.0&nbsp;L version.<ref name = "Consumerguide" />

In 1993, Ford did a minor redesign of the SHO interior, updating the center console. Other changes for 1993 included a trunklid spoiler, with integrated center high mount stop lamp.<ref name="TCCA" />

The second generation SHO entered popular culture due to the fact that a 1992 model is owned by comedian [[Conan O'Brien]], and that he often talks about it on [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]], his late night [[talk show]], when speaking about his personal life and interests.<ref name="Shoners">{{cite web|url= http://www.shotimes.com/php-bin/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0&sid=18|title=Famous SHO owners|publisher=SHOTIMES FAQ|accessdate=2006-07-28}}</ref> He devoted a special segment of the show to his SHO onetime, where in a fictional skit, he set off to sell the vehicle and use the money to buy a large estate in [[Europe]]. In the skit, he fails to sell the car, but then pretends to sell the car to [[Brad Pitt]]. 

By request of [[Car and Driver]] magazine, a SHO station wagon was created by the Car and Driver staff with the help of Ford engineers.<ref name = "CAD">{{cite journal| last =Phillips| first =John| title =The Billy Wagon.

They then replaced the stock engine and drivetrain with SHO drivetrain. Inside, the interior was replicated of that of a high spec SHO sedan, including its sport seats, steering wheel, and included most of the SHO's equipment.<ref name = "CAD" /> The staff then tested it, and took it on a cross country trip. The model became nothing more than a one off special, and the Car and Driver staff as well as Ford admitted that the SHO wagon was created "just for fun", and was never meant to be a serious production vehicle.<ref name = "CAD" />

The 1996 model year saw the first complete redesign for the Taurus. Developing the new Taurus was hard on Ford's designers and engineers, as they claimed that completely redesigning the Taurus would be comparable to "repainting the [[Mona Lisa]]."<ref name = "MW" /> As a result, they went through many different designs, and spent months trying to perfect the design of the new Taurus.<ref name = "MW" /> Ford wanted the new Taurus to be just as groundbreaking as the original 1986 Taurus, so they designed many new features for the new Taurus, including the "Integrated Control Panel", which combined the controls for the [[radio]] and [[air conditioning]] into one panel, and the "flip/fold center console", in which [[bench seat]] equipped cars could have the center of the bench fold out into a console with [[cupholder]]s.<ref name = "MW" /> The Taurus' designers also specially tuned every panel so every the sound made from the door closing to the [[windshield wiper]]s working was acoustically pleasing.<ref name = "MW" /><ref name = "ovaly">{{cite journal| last =Karr| first =Jeff| title =Balance of Power: America's Most Popular Car Is All New.

[[Image:3rd-Ford-Taurus-wagon.jpg|thumb|left|Taurus wagon]]
Ford had hoped the radical redesign would lead to the same success it had had with the 1986 Taurus. Ford even went as far as predicting that the new Taurus would continue the outgoing model's record of selling over 400,000 units a year.<ref name = "ovaly" /> However, the controversial oval theme was not well received by the press. [[Motor Trend]] stated, "It will shock some, and delight others."<ref name = "ovaly" /> Although the Taurus managed to continue as America's best selling car for that year, it lost that status in 1997 when [[Toyota]] launched a redesigned Camry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46002 |title=Inside Line: Toyota Camry |publisher=Edmunds.com |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2003-1-20 |accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref><ref name="MW">{{cite book|title=Car: A Drama of The American Workplace|first=Mary|last=Walton|year=1997|month=May|publisher=[[W.

The new Taurus cost more than the outgoing model; the suggested retail price for the 1996 model increased US$2,500 over the 1995 model.<ref name = "bestselling" /> However, Ford introduced a basic "G" trim line mid way through the 1996 model year.<ref name = "Gen III">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G3/index.html |title=Taurus/Sable Spotter's Guide Generation 3 |publisher=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> Thus, the trim lines consisted of the G at the bottom, with the GL as the mid priced model, and the LX as the most luxurious. The 1996 model year was the first time that the Taurus did not have an optional engine. The base G and GL had the (145&nbsp;hp (108&nbsp;kW) 3.0&nbsp;L [[Ford Vulcan V6 engine|Vulcan]] [[V6 engine|V6]], while the high end LX got the 3.0&nbsp;L [[double overhead cam|DOHC]] [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|Duratec 30]] V6.

[[Image:1998-99 Ford Taurus Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1998–1999 Taurus sedan]]

In an effort to reverse the declining sales of the Taurus, Ford tried to increase its appeal by making some cosmetic changes for the 1998 and 1999 model years. These changes included redesigning the [[grille]] openings in the front, changing the design from two oval openings to a full width opening for the air dam and moving the Ford logo down into an enlarged opening between the lights, mounted onto a [[Jaguar (automobile)|Jaguar]]-esque 'motif bar'. These years were also fitted with different [[headlight]] lenses, featuring completely clear lenses and a multi-reflector surface in the rear of the housing, around the bulb; these were known as the 'disco ball' headlights. The rear turn signal lenses were changed from amber to red, to match the rest of the lightbar assembly.<ref name = "Gen III" /> Ford also eliminated the two downmarket trim levels, G and GL, made the LX the most basic trim level, and reinstated the upscale ''SE'' model from 1995, which featured a harder suspension and four-wheel disc brakes.<ref name="Consumerguide96">{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1996-to-1999-ford-taurus.htm |title=1996–1999 Ford Taurus Review |publisher=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>

[[Image:Taurus Ghia1.jpg|thumb|left|1997 Australian-market Taurus Ghia]]

As well as being sold in the [[North American]] market, third generation models were sent abroad to places such as [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Japan]] and [[New Zealand]], in [[Driving on the left or right|right-hand drive]] configuration. However, this action proved unsuccessful.<ref name = "AU">{{cite web | url = http://glassguide.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/RT/A3099F03533DD3B2CA256D6E001DE35F_Our+Opinion?OpenDocument | title = Ford Taurus Ghia: our opinion | publisher = Glassguide.au | publisher = Glass Guide | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> In these markets, it wore [[Mercury Sable]] [[headlamp]]s, a unique front bumper cover with inset parking and turn signal lamps, and a Taurus-style rear, due to those countries' regulations regarding [[automotive lighting]]. Some minor changes were made to the interior besides the change to right hand drive, they also featured a handbrake, which was never available on North American Tauruses, and the radio was reversed. Australians and New Zealanders tended to stay away from the cars, due to their high price; a well equipped, larger-engined [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Ford Fairmont (Australia)|Ford Fairmont]] cost around the same amount.<ref name = "AU"/> While the Japanese market was offered the station wagon, Australian buyers could only opt for a single-spec sedan, known as the ''Taurus Ghia''.<ref name = "AU"/>

===Third generation SHO===
[[Image:SHO 2.JPG|thumb|right|1997 Ford Taurus]]
For 1996, the SHO model was redesigned. Unlike its predecessors, this SHO was more refined and used less radical bodywork. It differed from the normal Taurus with different seats, [[wheel]]s, [[bumper]]s, drivetrain, as well as a fin being put on the driver's side [[windshield wiper]], to keep it on the [[windshield]] at high speeds. Unlike the previous SHOs though, this model was designed for comfort instead of performance.<ref>{{cite book|title=1996 New cars, Ford Taurus SHO|publisher=[[Car and Driver]]|first=Barry|last=Winfield|edition=|id=|year=1995|month=October}}</ref>

A 235&nbsp;hp (175&nbsp;kW) [[Ford Yamaha V8 engine|3.4&nbsp;L DOHC V8]] was specified for the SHO model, but it was given the same four speed transmission as the LX: the manual gearbox option was no longer offered on the SHO.<ref name = "bestselling" /> Separation of the [[camshaft]] from its sprocket has been implicated in a growing number of engine failures, at around the 50,000&nbsp;mile (80,000&nbsp;km) mark.<ref name = "v8" /> The standard warranty on this model was 36,000&nbsp;miles (58,000&nbsp;km). This problem can be rectified by having the camshafts welded.<ref name="v8">{{cite web|url=http://www.v8sho.com/SHO/WhatWeKnow.htm|title=What We Know, What Ford Does Not Want You to Know, & Who Is To Blame|publisher=V8SHO.com|accessmonthday=January 26 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> This SHO model sold in lower numbers than the previous SHO generations, with sales peaking at 9,000 units in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Other/SHOcount.html |title=SHO Numbers |publisher=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> As a result, Ford cut the SHO when redesigning the Taurus for its fourth generation.

The Taurus received another redesign in 2000, which replaced many of the oval derived design elements of the previous model. The redesign also featured a taller roof over the rear-passenger space as well as a taller trunk, significantly increasing room.<ref name = "Consumerguide00" /> The interior was completely redesigned, although certain elements of the interior were retained from the outgoing model, such as the integrated control panel, which combined the sound system and climate controls into one panel. The [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] was also softened to appeal to a broader, non-sporting audience.<ref name = "Consumerguide00" /> Electrically-adjustable [[pedals]] became an option on the 2000 Taurus.<ref name = "Consumerguide00" /> To reduce the price to keep it competitive, Ford did cost cutting on the car, such as giving the Taurus rear [[drum brake]]s, eliminating the dual [[exhaust]] on the higher end models, and trimming many other small features.<ref name="Consumerguide00">{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2000-to-2006-ford-taurus.htm |title=2000-2006 Ford Taurus Review |publisher=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> The SHO model was also dropped.

The new Taurus was designed with safety in mind. It had a host of new safety features, including extra frame reinforcing, [[traction control]] and new optional side front seat mounted driver and passenger [[air bag]]s were added (which would become options in 2002) as well as a new system what Ford called the "Personal Safety System", which measured crash severity, and tightened the [[seat belt]]s and inflated the airbag to match.<ref name = "Consumerguide00" /> As a result, the 2000 Taurus got a five star crash safety rating from the [[NHTSA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.safercar.gov/Index2.cfm?myClass=PC&myYear=2000&myMake=Ford&myModel=Taurus&GoButton=View+specific+vehicle&myMake2=&myModel2=|title=2000 Ford Taurus crash test ratings |publisher=Safercar.gov |accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref>
[[Image:00-05 Ford Taurus wagon.jpg|thumb|left|Taurus wagon]]
The trim lines were completely rearranged for the 2000 model year. The most basic model was the LX, with the SE as the mid priced model, a new trim named "SES" as the value model, and the SEL as the highest end model, with the SEL slotting just under the [[Mercury Sable]] GS.

The 2002 Taurus offered two free options on every trim level, including a CD player and power driver's seat on the ''SE'', a power [[moonroof]] or leather interior on the ''SES'' and both of these luxury options on the ''SEL''. Side airbags and [[traction control]] were added as options on all models.<ref name = "bestselling" />

The SEL trim line got slightly redesigned for 2003, to give it a more upscale image. Among the changes it got was that it got a new instrument cluster, wheels, as well as the dash getting slightly redesigned, with [[woodgrain]] trim replacing the black trim. It also got woodgrain on the [[steering wheel]] rim and around the [[power window]] switches on the front doors.<ref name = "bestselling" /> Also in 2003, Ford created a Centennial Version Taurus to celebrate Ford's 100th anniversary. This special Taurus included many extras, such as lighter wood trim, special leather seats, [[headlight]]s with black accents, special wheels, a special leather case for the owner's manual, a leather jacket that said "Ford:100 years", a similar [[watch]], and a letter from [[William Clay Ford, Jr.]] Production was limited to 3,000 units.<ref name = "Cent">{{cite web | url = http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Specials/Cent.html | title = Centennial Taurus | publisher = Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia | publisher = Taurus Car Club of America | date = [[2007-01-21]] | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}</ref>

[[Image:sportrims.jpg|thumb|left|SES Sport Rims]]For 2003 and 2004, the SES Deluxe model received a "Sport" package, which consisted of special, unique rims, similar in design to the SHO "Slicer" rims that were featured on later Gen I SHOs and all Gen II SHOs, and the Duratec engine, mated to the AX4N transmission, standard.  In addition, the exterior of the vehicle received Sport badging on the front quarter-panels, the interior received two-toned cloth seats, a two-toned dash applique, special "Sport" floor mats, and a leather covered steering wheel.  To complete the package, the "spears" on the front of rear of the vehicle, which housed the Ford emblem, were body colored.  SES Sport models were available in only Black, Patriot Blue, Matador Red, Silver Frost, and Dark Shadow Gray, while the only interior offered was Dark Charcoal.

For 2004, the Taurus got a new front bumper, headlights, taillights, as well as new wheel options. Inside were a new instrument cluster, steering wheel, as well as the addition of a diagnostic center in the gauge cluster, that would tell if there were any problems with the car, as well as average fuel economy. It also was able to perform a "system check" per request of the driver, to make sure that the engine was functioning properly. 2005 to 2007 models remain mostly unchanged from 2004. In 2006 the Duratec engine was dropped from the lineup.<ref name = "Consumerguide00" />

===Initial discontinuation===
[[Image:Ford Taurus (2005) (photograph by Theo, 2006).jpg|thumb|right|2005 Ford Taurus]]
Taurus sales had slumped significantly in the years prior to its demise, losing significant market share to [[Japan]]ese sedans.<ref name="det"/> Production of the Taurus wagon was discontinued in January 2005; sedan retail sales halted after a short 2006 model year. The 2007 Taurus was sold exclusively to [[Fleet vehicles|fleets]] in the [[United States]], but was still offered to consumers in [[Canada]]. Production ended on [[October 27]], [[2006]], as Ford idled the Atlanta plant, as part of ''[[The Way Forward]]''. The last Ford Taurus rolled off the assembly line around 7:00am,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.leftlanenews.com/last-ford-taurus-built-today.html | title = Last Ford Taurus built today | publisher = Left Lane News | date = [[2006-10-27]]}}</ref> destined for delivery to [[S.

Rather than investing in an older platform, Ford chose to concentrate on development of the larger 2005 [[Ford Five Hundred|Five Hundred]] and [[Ford Freestyle|Freestyle]] (a taller crossover sedan and wagon, based on a Volvo FWD/AWD platform) and the 2006 [[Ford Fusion (North America)|Fusion]] (a Mazda6-based sedan, similar in size to the original Taurus), both vehicles replaced the Taurus in the Ford lineup.

The discontinuation of the Taurus was controversial. While many believed that the Taurus was discontinued because it could no longer compete in the growing sedan market,<ref name="DetNews">{{cite news | url = http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061023/AUTO01/610230304/1148 | title = Storied Ford Taurus reaches end of line | publisher = [[Detroit News]] | date = [[2006-10-23]] | accessdate = 2007-08-14}}</ref> others believed that if Ford wanted to save the car, they could have easily done so.<ref>{{Cite video | title = Final Ford Taurus interview | publisher = ABC News | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwuCm8hNXgI | date = [[2007-07-26]]}}</ref> One went as far as calling the Taurus the biggest fall from grace in history, and even blamed Ford being in dire straits today on their letting the Taurus become nothing more than a "rental car" and focusing all its money on SUVs.<ref name = "Autoblog">{{cite web | url = http://www.autoblog.com/2006/10/19/so-long-friend-ford-producing-the-last-taurus-next-week/ | title = So long, friend.

[[MSNBC]] interviewed many Ford workers who felt that Ford unjustly abandoned the car that had done so much to revitalize Ford and the US industry. In an [[October 25]], [[2006]] USA Today editorial, "How Ford starved its Taurus" it was noted that the Japanese stick with their winners and make them better (such as the [[Toyota Corolla]], which has been in continuous production since the 1960s),<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/2008/corolla/key_features/history.html | title = Toyota Corolla history | publisher = Toyota.com | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> while [[Detroit]] retires cars or entire division nameplates to keep with the current trends.<ref>{{cite news | title = How Ford starved its Taurus | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-10-24-ford-taurus_x.htm | publisher = USA Today | date = [[2006-10-25]] | accessdate = 2006-10-25}}</ref>

After [[Alan Mulally]] took position as Ford's CEO, rumors were rampant that he was interested in reviving the Taurus. Mulally said that he was baffled by the fact that Ford was going to discontinue the Taurus, and that he believed that the discontinuation of the Taurus was unjust, even asking "How can it go away, it is the best selling car in America."<ref name = "Alan" /> He said that the discontinuation of the Taurus disappointed many of Ford's loyal customers, who wanted Ford to instead continue to improve the Taurus instead of abandoning it.<ref name = "Alan" /> Mulally also stated that under his leadership, Ford will start to remain more loyal to its customers and nameplates, and will continue to stick with and improve successful nameplates to keep customers loyal to the brand, and the revival of the Taurus was the first such move.<ref>{{Cite video | title = Ford CEO Alan Mulally on the new Ford Taurus | publisher = Autoinsider news | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYlNOtqI8tc | date = 2007-07-26]]}}</ref>

As a result, the [[Ford Five Hundred]] sedan, as produced for the 2005–2007 model year, was scheduled for a significant styling facelift update and power upgrade for the 2008 model year. Ford decided to redesignate that model the Taurus because of customer recognition and dealer demand.<ref>{{cite web |title=Five Hundred To Be Renamed Taurus| url=http://www.stangbangers.com/News_FordFiveHundred.htm|publisher=stangbangers.com|accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> It was determined that Ford's strategy to redesignate new cars in the lineup with new names beginning with the letter ''F'', as in [[Ford Focus (North America)|Ford Focus]], [[Ford Fusion (North America)|Ford Fusion]], and [[Ford Freestyle]], was not a good marketing move, as some of the renamed cars had highly recognizable iconic names.

Changes to the new Taurus from the existing Five Hundred include over 500 changes with the most obvious being a newly styled front end and the addition of the 263&nbsp;hp 3.5&nbsp;L [[Ford Cyclone engine|Duratec 35]] V6 which replaces the 203&nbsp;hp [[Ford Mondeo V6 engine|Duratec 30]] 3.0&nbsp;L V6.

Along with the facelifted Five Hundred, Ford also created a facelifted [[Ford Freestyle|Freestyle]] model, also in an attempt to improve sagging sales.

==Awards==
[[Image:COTY.jpg|thumb|right|150px|All 1986 Tauruses came with this sticker on the back window that advertised that it was the 1986 "Car of the Year".]]

The Taurus won many awards in its production run, with the original Taurus winning many awards. For 1986, the Taurus was named Motor Trend's [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year]].
