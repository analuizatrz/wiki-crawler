==History==
A small group of [[Franciscan]] [[friars]] left [[Germany]] in [[1858]] to serve the German-speaking population in what was then the frontier state of Illinois. In [[1860]], they founded the institution as '''St. Francis Solanus College''', receiving a formal charter from the state in [[1873]].

The college proved to be an excellent site for the training of young Franciscan priests, and in 1917 the name was changed to the '''Quincy College and Seminary'''.

In [[1932]], women were admitted to the college for the first time.  Until  the [[1960]] â€“ [[1961|61]] school year and the construction of Centennial Hall, they were housed several blocks south of the main campus, in converted Victorian mansions that still exist today, though no longer owned by the school.  (Stillwell Hall is now the Quincy Museum, and Bonfoy Hall is privately owned.)

In 1970 the seminary portion of the school was closed and the school renamed to simply '''Quincy College'''.  The seminary campus, a mile north of the main college campus, has since been used by the college for extra dormitory space, athletic fields, and classroom and office space.  The dormitory is now used as a retreat center, and the academic portion of the North Campus houses most of the Division of Mathematics and Science.  North Campus has also been leased to local Police and 911 services.

In the late 1980s, the college began considering granting graduate degrees; this became a reality a few years later and in 1993 the college was officially renamed Quincy University.

==Academics==
At the graduate level, QU offers a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree and a Master of Science in Education (M.S.Ed.) degree.

At the undergraduate level, QU offers Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees in 32 major areas of concentration.  They also offer an Associate of Science degree in Aviation, and a variety of non-degree programs.

Despite recent panic over a drop in incoming students, University officials claim there is no reason to question the future of the institution.

Future plans attempting to prevent the closing of the small University supposedly include selling the "North Campus" to the Illinois State University system to establish a satellite Law School.  North Campus has already been recently used to host a 911 operator site and became the new home to school's music program in the Fall Semester of 2006.  The music department move came after plans to raze one of the campus' most historic buildings, Solano Hall, once the dorm of John Mahoney.  Despite financial problems, the University plans to build a new Arts and Sciences Building in the soon to be open space, taking the place of the current North Campus science facilities.  The new Arts and Sciences building should be completed by the dawn of the next decade, completing the musical chair shuffle of department locales.
