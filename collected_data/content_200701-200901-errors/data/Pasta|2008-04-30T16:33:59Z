'''Pasta''' is an [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] food made from a [[dough]] using [[flour]], [[water]] and/or [[Egg (food)|eggs]].

There are approximately 350 different [[shapes of pasta]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lifeinitaly.com/food/pasta-history.asp |title=History of Pasta |accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref>. A few examples include [[spaghetti]] (solid [[cylinders]]), [[macaroni]] ([[Tubing (material)|tubes]] or hollow cylinders), [[fusilli]] (swirls), [[lasagna]] (sheets), and [[gnocchi]] (balls), although this is considered a separate dish by some. The two basic styles of pasta are dried and fresh. There are also variations in the ingredients used in pasta. The time for which pasta can be stored varies from days to years depending upon whether the pasta is made with egg or not, and whether it is dried or fresh<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/get_cooking/cooks_guide/pasta.shtml |title=BBC Food - Get cooking - Pasta |accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref>. Pasta is [[boiled]] prior to consumption.

The word, ''pasta'', can also denote dishes in which pasta products are the primary ingredient, served with sauce or seasonings.

__TOC__
==Ingredients==
There are many ingredients that can be used to make pasta dough. They range from a simple flour and water mixture, to those that call for the addition of eggs, spices and cheeses, or even [[squid ink]] to the dough.  

Under Italian law, dry pasta can only be made from [[durum]] wheat [[semolina]] flour. This flour has a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: "to the tooth", meaning not too soft). Abroad, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour (such as [[farina]]), but this yields a softer product, which cannot be cooked ''al dente''.

Particular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and/or milling methods to make the flour. Some pasta varieties, such as [[Pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. Various types of fresh pasta include [[egg (food)|eggs]] (''pasta all'uovo''). [[Gnocchi]] are often listed among pasta dishes, although they are quite different in ingredients (mainly milled [[potato]]es).

==Preparation==
Pasta can be made by hand but is more commonly made with special tools or machines. [[Extrusion]] tools force ingredients through holes in a plate known as a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]. Lamination tools squeeze ingredients through rollers into sheets of a particular thickness, which are then cut by slitters.

The innovation of dried pasta, in the form of long thin noodles we use today (spaghetti), is attributed to the Arabs<ref name = Watson/> who occupied Southern Italy (i.e. Sicily) around the 12th Century. Prior to this, Italians are said to have eaten their pasta freshly made (''pasta fresca'') in a gnocchi like form.

Common pasta sauces in [[Northern Italy]] include [[pesto]] and [[ragù alla bolognese]]; in [[Central Italy]], simple [[tomato sauce]], [[amatriciana]] and [[carbonara]], and in [[Southern Italy]], spicy tomato, garlic, and olive oil based sauces, often paired with fresh vegetables or seafood. Varieties include [[puttanesca]], ''pasta alla norma'' (tomatoes, eggplant and fresh or baked cheese), ''pasta con le sarde'' (fresh sardines, pine nuts, fennel and olive oil), ''spaghetti aglio, olio e peperoncino'' (literally with garlic, (olive) oil and hot chili peppers).

[[Fettuccine Alfredo]], with butter and cheese, and spaghetti with tomato sauce with or without ground meat or meatballs are popular Italian-style dishes in the [[United States]].

As pasta is introduced elsewhere in the world, it has been incorporated into a number of local cuisines that may have significantly different ways of preparations from those of its country of origin.  In [[Hong Kong]], the local Chinese has adopted pasta, primarily [[spaghetti]] and [[macaroni]], as an ingredient in the [[Hong Kong-style Western cuisine]].  In the territory's [[Cha chaan teng]]s, pasta, most commonly macaroni, is cooked in water, and served in broth with [[ham]] or [[sausage|frankfurter sausages]], peas, [[shiitake|black mushrooms]], and optionally [[egg (food)|eggs]] reminiscent of [[noodle soup]] dishes. This is often a course for breakfast or light lunch fare <ref>AP, Explore the world of Canto-Western cuisine, January 8, 2007  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16440507/</ref>.  The method often involves cooking the pasta well beyond the [[al dente]] stage and washing the starches off the pasta after cooking, measures frowned upon in Italy or in Hong Kong's more authentic Italian eateries.
