==History and touring==
{{main|Chinese Democracy Tour}}
Recording for ''Chinese Democracy'' began in 1994. Ex-bassist [[Duff McKagan]] is quoted as saying, "[the] band was so splintered at that point that nothing got started".<ref name="time off">{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoff.com.au/index.php?area=Interviews&pg=38&subarea=38&sel=6127&PHPSESSID=b1255c323c0977e85e64fe287a9f7654=

Slash was replaced by [[Nine Inch Nails]] touring guitarist [[Robin Finck]], ex-[[The Replacements|Replacements]] bassist [[Tommy Stinson]] replaced McKagan, and [[Josh Freese]] joined as the drummer.

In early 1998, the band — which comprised Rose, Finck, Stinson and Freese along with long-time Guns N' Roses associate [[Paul Tobias]], keyboardists [[Dizzy Reed]] and [[Chris Pitman]] — began recording at Rumbo Recorders, a state-of-the-art studio in the [[San Fernando Valley]] where Guns N' Roses had partially recorded parts for their debut album, ''Appetite for Destruction''. During this time, [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] paid Rose [[United States dollar|$]]1 million to try and finish the album, with a further $1 million if he handed it in to them by March 1, 1999.<ref name="NY Times" />

Finck briefly left the band to rejoin Nine Inch Nails on tour in 1999.  In 2000, Rose hired [[avant-garde metal]] guitarist [[Buckethead]], and drummer [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan "Brain" Mantia]], who has appeared on many of Buckethead's solo albums, to replace the departed Freese. Later on in 2000, Finck rejoined the band as the third guitarist.

Rhythm guitarist [[Richard Fortus]] joined the band in 2002, replacing Tobias, who had left because of his disdain for touring. In August 2002, the band honored tour dates in Hong Kong, Japan, England and Belgium. They infamously played at the [[2002 MTV Video Music Awards]], on August 29, during their medley of "[[Welcome to the Jungle]]", "Madagascar" and "[[Paradise City]]" Rose seemed out of breath and struggled to keep up with the rest of the band; Rose's vocal performance was the subject of much criticism by fans and critics.<ref name="GN'R slammed by critic">{{cite web| url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=6031 | title = Guns N' Roses Slammed By Boston Globe Writer Over VMA Appearance | accessdate = 2007-11-21| date=  2002-09-11| publisher = Blabbermouth.net}}</ref><ref name="blabbermouth august 30">{{cite web| url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=5759 | title = Guns N' Roses Perform At VMAs, Axl Rose Shuns Press Amid Plastic-Surgery-Gone-Wrong Reports | accessdate = 2007-11-21| date=  2002-08-30| publisher = Blabbermouth.net}}</ref> After the VMA appearance, the band embarked on their first North American tour since the spring of 1993.

After the 2002 tour, the band went on hiatus. They were scheduled to play at [[Rock In Rio|Rock in Rio IV]] in May 2004, but cancelled. Rose claimed Buckethead's departure in March 2004 left them unable to perform:
{{cquote|The band has been put in an untenable position by guitarist Buckethead and his untimely departure. On behalf of Guns N' Roses and myself I apologize to the fans who planned to see us at Rock in Rio - Lisbon. The festival and its tradition mean a lot to me personally and I sincerely do not enjoy being robbed by one of our own of the opportunity to be the first artist to play it for the third time. I would also like to express my gratitude to those who chose to embrace Buckethead's role in Guns and support our new line up. We greatly appreciate Bucket's contributions and remain open to 'discussions' as there are obviously several issues to resolve. In the meantime rather than dwelling on the negative, Guns will be moving forward and surprisingly (without giving away any details) this unfortunate set of circumstances may have given us the opportunity to take our recording that one extra step further.<ref name="rio cancellation">{{cite web|url =

On [[December 14]], [[2006]], Rose published an open letter to the band's fans on their website, he announced the cancellation of the final four shows of the North American tour, claiming that those shows were taking up time the band needed to finish recording ''Chinese Democracy''. Rose also revealed that the band had parted company with their manager Merck Mercuriadis, implying that the reason the album wasn't released in 2006 was Mercuriadis's fault (many times throughout 2006, Rose had said the album would be released that year). In the letter, Rose announced a tentative release date of March 6, 2007 for the album, however, the album was once again delayed.<ref name="Axl's open letter" /> The next day, Mercuriadis replied to Rose's letter, stating that he had organized many recording sessions which Rose had failed to attend.

==Sound==
In 1999, the [[industrial metal]] song "[[Oh My God (Guns N' Roses song)|Oh My God]]" was released on the ''[[End of Days (1999 film)|End of Days]]'' soundtrack. It featured current Guns N' Roses members [[Axl Rose]], [[Dizzy Reed]], [[Robin Finck]], [[Chris Pitman]] and [[Tommy Stinson]], along with  former members [[Paul Tobias]] and [[Josh Freese]]. [[Dave Navarro]] and Gary Sunshine also recorded guitar parts for the song. "Oh My God" was unpopular upon its release, and was described by [[Allmusic]] as "a less than satisfying comeback".<ref name="NY Times" /><ref name="AMG-EoD">{{cite web|url=http://wc02.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:fxfrxqwkld0e|title=All Music Guide: End of Days - Overview|accessdate=2006-11-17|author=Erlewine, Stephen|publisher=''[[All Media Guide]]''}}</ref> The sound of ''Chinese Democracy'' was often reported to be industrial rock music similar to [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], a style that Rose had long been a fan of. However, in a 2001 interview with an Argentine radio station, Rose stated the album wasn't industrial, and would vary in styles:
{{cquote|It is not industrial, the closest thing to that was perhaps "Oh My God", but there are some songs that won't be on the album that were this way.

In 2003, DJ [[Eddie Trunk]] spoke about the demo of "I.R.S." which was leaked on his radio show:
{{cquote|It reminded me of Use Your Illusion-era stuff, with some modern flairs to it. The song had a loop track in the beginning, but then, when it kicked in, it was that same dramatic Guns N' Roses hard rock.<ref name="MTV Trunk" />}}

During the launch party for [[Korn]]'s 2006 tour, Rose conducted an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he told the magazine:
{{cquote|It's a very complex record, I'm trying to do something different. Some of the arrangements are kind of like [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Some people are going to say, 'It doesn't sound like Axl Rose, it doesn't sound like Guns N' Roses.' But you'll like at least a few songs on there.<ref name="RS2006-01-13" />}}

In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article in 2006, former [[Skid Row (heavy metal band)|Skid Row]] frontman [[Sebastian Bach]] described the album as "epic" and "mind-blowing" and added:
{{cquote|It’s a very cool album - it’s badass with killer screams, killer guitar riffs, but it’s got a totally modern sound. The word for it is ‘grand.’ It’s fucking epic. He’s reinvented himself yet again.<ref name="DiS-Bach" />}}

Bach also described a song entitled "Sorry":
{{cquote|There’s this one song called ‘Sorry’ that’s almost like [[doom metal]] with Axl singing really clean over this grinding, slow beat that is fucking mean, I cannot get it out of my head.<ref name="DiS-Bach" />}}

Bach has also described the album as having "the rawness and the power of ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'', but it also has the grandiosity of '[[November Rain]]'."<ref name="RS-2007-09-26">{{cite web

==Leaks==
In September 2003, radio DJ [[Eddie Trunk]] played a new Guns N' Roses song titled "I.R.S." on his syndicated radio show ''Friday Night Rocks ... With Eddie Trunk''. This was at the insistence of his in-studio guest [[Mike Piazza]], who had received a CD in the mail the previous month.<ref name="MTV Trunk">{{cite web

An excerpt of the song "I.R.S." leaked onto the Internet in April 2005. The band's management referred to it as a "low quality demo", but it was most likely a recording of Eddie Trunk's broadcast of the song from 2003.<ref name="ultimate guitar">{{cite web

[[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] confirmed on his [[blog]] that he recorded guitar for the "Catcher in the Rye" demo in 1999.<ref name="brian may" /> 

On [[February 20]], [[2007]], a new version of the song "Better" was leaked onto the Internet. Dizzy Reed confirmed the song was real on the band's website. He also claimed [[Harley-Davidson]] was the source of the leak: "We were doing a commercial with Harley-Davidson. Harley was going to do a version using 'Paradise City' and another version using 'Better'. Their web site even had a version up for like one day with 'Better', but the version of 'Better' that they had was an unfinished, unapproved demo.

A studio version of "Madagascar" was leaked onto a fansite on [[March 29]], [[2007]]; the track was leaked by a well known member on a Guns N' Roses fan forum.

Three more tracks leaked in early May, 2007; the album's title track, "Chinese Democracy", "There Was a Time", "The Blues" and another, more recent version of "I.R.S.". All three tracks had previously been played live and "Chinese Democracy" had been partially leaked in March. They were allegedly leaked by the wrestler [[Mister Saint Laurent]].<ref>Prior to the songs being leaked, someone with the username "MisterSaintLaurent" offered thousands of [[USD|dollars]] for unheard ''Chinese Democracy'' demos on various Guns N' Roses fan forums. However, Saint Laurent has never officially confirmed or denied that it was him. </ref>

Nine further demos from ''Chinese Democracy'' sessions were leaked on [[June 18]], [[2008]] to Kevin "Skwerl" Cogill's blog Antiquiet. Three songs—"Rhiad and the Bedouins", a song which had been performed live on the ''[[Chinese Democracy Tour]]'' in 2001 and 2002; a track whose name is unknown thus far; and "If the World", a song which was an unused part of the setlist during 2006 leg of the ''Chinese Democracy Tour''—had never previously leaked; the other six songs are remixed or reworked versions of songs which have previously leaked in demo form: "Better", "Chinese Democracy", "I.R.S.", "Madagascar", "The Blues" and "There Was a Time". The songs were leaked via Antiquiet.com, a music website. Antiquiet streamed the songs on its website, claiming they were "mastered, finished versions that you probably haven't heard".<ref name="18-6-08">{{cite web

According to a March 2005 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article, production costs for the album have reached $13 million, making it probably the most expensive recording never to be released.<ref name="NY Times">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/06/arts/music/06leed.html?ei=5090&en=a13c0fac87670850&ex=1267851600&adxnnl=1&partner=rssuserland&pagewanted=all&adxnnlx=1195322585-YcO/12l8xR/GIod6+bXFQA

Rose issued a press release on Guns N' Roses' official website on [[December 14]], [[2006]]. Entitled "An open letter to the fans from Axl", Rose announced the cancellation of four concerts that were scheduled for January 2007, he stated that if the band fulfilled the concerts, "valuable time needed by the band and record company for the proper setup and release of the album ''Chinese Democracy'' would have been lost". Also in the letter, he confirmed that Guns N' Roses had parted company with manager Merck Mercuriadis. Rose blamed much of the album's delay on Mercuriadis. Rose also announced a tentative release date for ''Chinese Democracy'' of [[March 6]] [[2007]], he remarked that it was the first time the band had publicly named a release date for the album.<ref name="Axl's open letter">{{cite web|url=http://www.newgnr.com/articles/axlletter121506.html|title=An open letter from Axl Rose|publisher=GunsNRoses.com|author=Rose, Axl|date=[[2006-12-14]]|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>

Despite Rose's announcement, the album was once again delayed. On [[February 22]], [[2007]], the band's road manager, [[Del James]], issued a press release definitively stating that all recording for the album had been completed.  James elaborated, "There is no official release date, as the band is currently mixing, but after some delays and scheduling difficulties, things appear to be moving along."<ref name="DelJames">{{cite web|url=http://web.gunsnroses.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070222&content_id=a1&vkey=news&fext=.jsp

In a 2007 interview, Sebastian Bach claimed Rose had planned to have the album released by Christmas 2007: "I know Axl was very serious about putting something out before Christmas. He was talking to me about it. He was talking about finishing liner notes." Bach also said that ''Chinese Democracy'''s delay might be because of business problems: "I think there's a lot of business shit that goes on with him. It's just not as easy. It's a little more complicated than people think."<ref name="Bach interview - RMM">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockmymonkey.com/interviews/07/11/SebastianBach.php|title=Rock My Monkey - Sebastian Bach Interview|publisher=Rock My Monkey|accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> Little was said about the record after this, and 2007 saw no official release of the new material.

In January 2008, rumors arose that ''Chinese Democracy'' had been handed over to Geffen Records, but had been delayed because the label and Rose could not agree on the marketing of the album.<ref name="antimusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/08/jan/10GNR_Finish_CD.shtml|title=GNR Finish CD?|publisher=antiMusic|accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref> [[Eddie Trunk]] also claimed Geffen might have the album: "I hear the new G&R CD is actually done, but the delay in release is not the bands{{sic}} issues but the label.  There is so much money tied up in this record that in todays{{sic}} business it will be virtually impossible to be profitable, meaning the label might want to sell it off but can not find a buyer since nobody buys CDs anymore. Problem might not be Axl this time around and might keep this CD in limbo for more years to come. Hopefully it gets resolved."<ref name="Eddie Trunk blog">{{cite web|url=http://www.eddietrunk.com/blog.php|title=Eddie Trunk - Trunk Blog|author=Trunk, Eddie|publisher=Eddietrunk.com|accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref> However, in a February 2008 interview with Classic Rock Magazine, Rose's personal manager, Beta Lebeis, debunked Trunk's suggestion and  was quoted as saying "we're currently in negotiations with the record label".<ref name="Classic Rock article 2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/page/classicrock?entry=it_s_a_fact|title=It's a Fact|publisher=Classic Rock Magazine|accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref>

==Controversy and lawsuits==
In 2004, Geffen Records released ''[[Greatest Hits (Guns N' Roses album)|Greatest Hits]]''. Rose, along with Slash and McKagan, attempted to block the album's release. They filed a lawsuit against Geffen, claiming the album was unauthorized and would damage the band's reputation, Rose also claimed it would distract the band from completing ''Chinese Democracy''. A week before the scheduled release, a judge denied their request for an injunction and the album was released.<ref name="AMG-GH">{{cite web|url=http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:8iazqjkwojha=

===Title conflicts===
On [[April 1]], [[2003]], [[The Offspring]] announced that they would be naming their upcoming album ''Chinese Democrazy<!-- Note: This is the correct title - see the ref. --> (You Snooze, You Lose)''. The Offspring's lead singer [[Dexter Holland]] elaborated, "You snooze, you lose. Axl ripped off my braids, I ripped off his album title."<ref name="offspring">{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470891/20030401/story.jhtml | title = Guns N' Roses' ''Chinese Democracy'' Snatched By Offspring | accessdate = 2007-01-08 | last = D'Angelo | first = Joe | date=  2003-04-01 | work = MTV.com}}</ref> However, it turned out to be an April Fools' joke and the Offspring album was eventually released under the title ''[[Splinter (The Offspring album)|Splinter]]'' instead.

==Track listing==
Although the entire track listing for ''Chinese Democracy'' has not been confirmed, various members of the band and people associated with the band have confirmed certain tracks which will appear on the album. All but two of the confirmed tracks have been played live during the ''[[Chinese Democracy Tour]]'', the exceptions being "Sorry" and "Shackler's Revenge".
