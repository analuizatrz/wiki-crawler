'''Mobile''' ({{IPA2|moʊˈbiːl}}) [http://www.bartleby.com/61/wavs/93/M0359300.wav (pronunciation)]  is a city located in [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile County]], [[Alabama]], [[US]], along the northwest shore of [[Mobile Bay]].  The population of the city was 197,833 according to the 2006 estimate.<ref name=popest/>  It is the principal city of the Mobile [[metropolitan statistical area]] (MSA), which had a population of approximately 429,622 and a population of 588,246 in the combined statistical area in 2006.

Mobile is the third most populous city in the State of Alabama and the principal city of the second most populous metropolitan area of the state. <ref name="citypop">{{cite web|title=''USA: Alabama''|work=CityPopulation.de|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/USA-Alabama.html|accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref> 

The city's name is derived from the presence of the Mobile (Mauvile or Maubila) [[Native Americans in the US|Indians]] in the area at the time of founding. <ref name="mgs">{{cite web|title=''Local History Information and Links''|work=Mobile Genealogical Society|url=http://www.siteone.com/clubs/mgs/history.htm|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref> 

The city is the [[county seat]] of [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile County]].  Mobile is the original home of [[Mardi Gras]], a tradition that started in [[1703]], and is the second largest celebration in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title=''Gulf Coast's oldest Mardi Gras''|publisher=USA Today|date=2004-01-26|url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2004-01-26-mobile-mardi-gras_x.htm|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref>  Mobile is the only saltwater port in [[Alabama]]. 

Beginning as the first capital of French colonial [[Louisiana]] in [[1702]], during the past 300 years, Mobile has officially flown six flags, including [[France]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], [[Spain]], the Republic of Alabama ([[1861]]), the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and the [[United States]].

==History==
The original French settlement of [http://www.thingstodo.com/states/AL/history.htm "Fort Louis de la Mobile"], was first established in [[1702]], at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff on the [[Mobile River]], as the first capital of the French colony of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. Following a series of floods, the town was relocated downriver to its present location near the head of [[Mobile Bay]] in [[1711]], with another wooden ''Fort Louis''.<ref name=MoMfort>

    Museum of Mobile, Mobile, Alabama, 2006, webpage:
    [http://www.museumofmobile.com/html/other_museums.php MoM-Other].
</ref>
The capital of the [[Louisiana Territory]] was moved to [[Biloxi]] in [[1720]] and to [[New Orleans]] in [[1723]],<ref name=MoMfort/> and Mobile was relegated to the role of frontier town and trading post.
In [[1723]], construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began, and was renamed as [[Fort Conde|Fort Condé]] in honor of King [[Louis XIV]]’s brother.<ref name=MoMfort/>

In [[1763]], the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed, ending the French and Indian War. The treaty ceded Mobile to Great Britain and under British rule the colony flourished. The British renamed the city Fort Charlotte, after the English Queen, and re-energized the port. Major exports included timber, naval stores, indigo, hides, rice, pecans and cattle. 

The immediate British enforcement of race codes threw the denizens of the French-derived culture into chaos. The [[French Creole]] world was noted for its laissez-faire attitude to racial matters and the stringent English codes chased some of Mobile's Creole residents westward into Louisiana. 
[[Image:Battle of Mobile Bay map.jpg |thumb|270px|left| '''Mobile''', Alabama (upper left), during the [[American Civil War]].]] 
[[Battle of Fort Charlotte|The Spanish captured]] the port town in [[1780]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Spanish held Mobile until [[1813]] when, it was captured by the American [[General]] Wilkinson. By then it was the second largest seaport on the Gulf Coast.

The Cotton Boom of the early [[19th century]] brought an explosion of commerce to what had been a sleepy frontier town. By the [[1850s]], Mobile was one of the 4 busiest ports in the US. The wealth created by this trade brought the city to a cultural high point. Mobile became known throughout the country and the world.

In another note of differentiation between the somewhat cosmopolitan port and the hinterlands of predominantly Protestant Alabama, Mobile was declared a [[diocese]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in this same period. What would become known as McGill-Toolen High School was also established during this time. In [[1830]], Bishop [[Michael Portier]] founded [[Spring Hill College]], one of the oldest Catholic schools in the country.  Control of the college was assumed by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]] in [[1847]].

In [[1860]], ''Clotilde'', the last known ship to arrive in the Americas with a cargo of slaves, was abandoned by its captain near Mobile.  A number of the slaves escaped and formed their own community on the banks of the Mobile River, which became known as [[Africatown]]. The inhabitants of this community retained their [[Africa]]n customs and language well into the [[20th century]].

Mobile grew substantially in the period leading up to the [[American Civil War]], when the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] heavily fortified it. Union naval forces established a [[blockade]] under the command of [[Admiral]] [[David Farragut]]. The Confederates countered by constructing blockade-runners: fast, shallow-draft, low-slung ships that could either out-run or evade the blockaders, maintaining a trickle of trade in and out of Mobile. Also, the [[Hunley]], the first submarine to sink an enemy vessel in combat, was built and tested in Mobile. 

In August, 1864 Farragut's ships fought their way past the two forts (Gaines and Morgan) guarding the mouth of Mobile Bay and defeated a small force of wooden Confederate gunboats and the ironclad [[CSS Tennessee]], in the famous [[Battle of Mobile Bay]]. It is here that Farragut is alleged to have uttered his famous "Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead" quote. The city of Mobile later surrendered to the Union army in order to avoid destruction. Ironically, on [[May 25]], [[1865]], weeks after [[Jefferson Davis]] had dissolved the Confederacy, an ammunition depot explosion -- called the great [[Mobile magazine explosion]] -- killed some 300 people and destroyed a significant portion of the city.

After the war, the harbor was substantially improved and deepened, and shipbuilding became a notable industry. However, the city languished as a result of Reconstruction and the general economic decline of the South.
[[Image:Mobile Market House LOC det 4a13425u.jpg|thumb|230px|right| Old Market House in Mobile, circa [[1906]].]]

The military buildup prior to and during World War II resulted in a massive increase in population. Shipyards were churning out vessels for the war effort and in 1938 the US Army bought the municipal airport (Bates Field was relocated about 10 miles west of the city and is now known as Mobile Regional Airport) and there developed the Brookley Army Air Field, later, Brookley Air Force Base. Brookley quickly became the area's largest employer. In the mid-1960s the Air Force Base was closed due to a Department of Defense "base realignment" and the airport returned to the city. Today, it is known as [[Mobile Downtown Airport]].

During the war, the phenomenal influx of workers created a huge housing shortage. Citizens rented out extra rooms and also converted porches, garages and even chicken coops into rentals. Several federal housing projects were quickly built to house the new maritime and Air Force workers. Several of these are still to be found, notably the community of [[Birdville]]. "Thomas James Place" was the proper name for Birdville which was built just outside of Brookley Air Force base to provide relief for the housing shortage. The development consisted of a series of interwoven curving concrete streets named after various birds, hence the nickname Birdville.

By [[1956]], Mobile's square mileage had tripled to accommodate the growth. [[Brookley]]'s closure in the mid-[[1960s]] sent economic tremors through the area which took many years to absorb. 

Also, in the post-war period, the pulp and paper industry became a major industry in Mobile. [[Scott Paper Company]] and [[International Paper]] combined to have one of the area's largest workforces. However, the demise of these industries within the last decade also hurt the local economy. On the other hand, during the last 15 years, the chemical, oil and gas, tourism, maritime and aerospace industries have expanded significantly and provided a much needed economic boost.

In [[1964]], the [[University of South Alabama]] opened its doors and its tremendous impact on the community and economy was deeply felt in a variety of sectors. The university, the largest employer in the area,{{fact|date=March 2007}} operates several hospitals and has a noted medical school.

Mobile's seafood industry rose to a position of note for a while, with Mobile Bay [[oyster]]s acclaimed far and wide, but this waned almost to the point of extinction in the last quarter of the 20th century. A few shrimpers still hang on in the South Mobile County fishing village of [[Bayou La Batre]], immortalized in the book and film [[Forrest Gump]], but their future appears uncertain. 

Four members of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] were born in Mobile:  [[Hank Aaron]], [[Willie McCovey]], [[Satchel Paige]] and [[Ozzie Smith]]. A fifth Hall-of-Famer, [[Billy Williams (baseball player)|Billy Williams]], was born in the suburban community of Whistler. Notable yearly activities that take place in Mobile include the [[Senior Bowl]], [[Mardi Gras]] (the oldest in the country), the [[GMAC Bowl]], and the [[Azalea Trail Run]]. In addition, the [[Mobile BayBears]] baseball team play in the Double A [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]].

The eastern shore of Mobile Bay periodically experiences an unusual phenomenon called a [[Mobile Bay Jubilee|Jubilee]].  A jubilee, which usually takes place in the wee hours of warm summer nights, describes a massive upsurge of sea life from the bottom of the bay. This phenomenon has also been observed in a similar bay in Japan and is believed to be caused by low oxygen levels in the water.  This upsurge to the surface usually consists of crabs, shrimp, flounder and other sea delicacies.  Needless to say, a jubilee, when first realized, is quickly spread by word of mouth along the coast, providing an impromptu fishing party in the middle of the night.  Jubilee Parkway (the [[I-10]] bridge across Mobile Bay) is named after this phenomenon.

On [[10 November]] [[1993]] the [[city]] formally twinned with the [[Japan]]ese [[Ichihara, Chiba|city of Ichihara]], [[Chiba prefecture]].

Hurricane Frederic, which struck the area on September 12, 1979, caused severe damage in Mobile.  Many residents were without power, water, telephone and basic necessities for weeks.  Fortunately, only one death was recorded.  The economic boom that followed Frederic, in addition to the economic growth of the 1980s, vastly improved Mobile's overall economic picture.

Mobile and its suburbs suffered considerable damage when [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck the Gulf Coast on [[August 29]], 2005. Although losing electric power for weeks, most of the city survived relatively intact compared to eastern New Orleans, coastal Louisiana, and [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on Mississippi|coastal Mississippi]], but the high winds and [[flood]]ing destroyed homes in coastal areas and damaged some parts of the downtown area, and at least two people died in hurricane-related car accidents.

==Geography==
===Topography===
Mobile is located at 30°40'46" North, 88°6'12" West (30.679523, -88.103280).{{GR|1}} According to the [[US Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 412.9 [[square kilometre|km²]] (159.4 [[square mile|mi²]]).  305.4 km² (117.9 mi²) of it is land and 107.6 km² (41.5 mi²) of it is water.  The total area is 26.05% water.
===Climate===
Mobile, as a central [[Gulf Coast of the US|Gulf Coast]] city has a [[subtropical]] [[climate]], which consists of mild, wet winters and hot, wet summers. Mobile is also very vulnerable to [[storm surge]] from [[hurricane]]s, which the area frequently experiences.  Historically, it has the highest annual rainfall of any urban area in the United States.

===Hurricanes===
Mobile suffered its worst natural disaster on [[September 12]], [[1979]] when Category 3 [[hurricane]] [[Hurricane Frederic]] slammed into the heart of the city.  The storm caused tremendous damage to nearby [[Dauphin Island, Alabama|Dauphin Island]] and [[Gulf Shores, Alabama|Gulf Shores]].  The city took over 5 years to fully recover from the devastating hurricane.

On [[September 16]], [[2004]], Mobile received a glancing blow from Category 3 [[Hurricane Ivan]] which made landfall in Gulf Shores. Mobile was caught in Ivan's western [[eye]] and the destruction was eerily similar to 1979's Frederic.

In August of [[2005]], Mobile received another glancing blow from [[Hurricane Katrina]]. A storm surge exceeding 12 feet devastated eastern parts of Mobile.  The surge was the highest recorded in Mobile in over 85 years.

Mobile has also suffered damage from hurricanes: [[Hurricane Camille|Camille]], [[Hurricane Elena|Elena]], [[Hurricane Georges|Georges]], [[Hurricane Erin|Erin]], [[Hurricane Opal|Opal]], [[Hurricane Florence|Florence]], [[Hurricane Cindy|Cindy]] and [[Hurricane Danny|Danny]].

==Economy==
[[Image:Mobile Alabama harbor aerial view.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the port of Mobile]]
Mobile's [[Port of Mobile|Alabama State Docks]] is currently undergoing the largest expansion in its history by expanding its container processing and storage facility and increasing container storage at the docks by over 1,000%.  Mobile is also in the race to become home to the nations largest military contract in history, a $200+ Billion air force tanker project which would generate over 5,000 high paying jobs in Mobile, pushing the city to very front of the nations most prosperous cities. The rapidly growing auto industry in Alabama has resulted in over 2,000 new jobs created in Mobile.  Mobile also has benefited greatly economically from the Hurricane Katrina disaster with thousands of evacuees relocating to Mobile.

Since the Katrina disaster, Mobile has seen a housing boom of more than 2,200 new homes built in only the past 16 months, exceeding even the post World War II boom of the late 1940s.  Mobile is also one of two finalist areas for the ThyssenKrupp Steel Processing Plant, which when built, will be the largest steel plant in North America employing nearly 3,000 people.

Since [[1852]], the Battle House hotel has been a fixture of the Mobile landscape. Although the original hotel was destroyed in a fire in [[1905]], it was rebuilt and has remained a Mobile area landmark. It was the location of [[Woodrow Wilson|President Woodrow Wilson's]] famous speech in [[1913]] where he declared that the US would never again fight in a foreign war of aggression. In [[1974]], the hotel went vacant, as much of downtown was doing at the time.

In [[2001]], the Mobile City Council approved a deal with the [[Retirement Systems of Alabama]] for a complete restoration of the historic hotel, as well as construction of the Battle House Tower, a 35-story, 745-foot (227 m) tall [[skyscraper]] that will not only be the tallest building in Alabama, but also one of the tallest buildings on the [[Gulf Coast]]. Only sixteen cities in the United States will have one or more buildings taller than Mobile's tallest building.{{fact|date=March 2007}}

The Battle House Project is the crowning achievement of the "String of Pearls" initiative undertaken by the administration of former Mayor Mike Dow (1989-2005), which saw the construction of the Arthur Outlaw Convention Center and the Cruise Ship Terminal, the approval of the soon to be constructed Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico, and the complete rebirth of Dauphin Street, Mobile's historic commercial corridor. 

Other projects in the works include a number of high-rise condominium towers on Water Street in the heart of the downtown waterfront, as well as the construction of a historic [[Mardi Gras]] themed city park in downtown and a brand new state of the art federal courthouse. Large commercial ventures are in the works for the metropolitan area.

Many scenes in director [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]] were filmed in Mobile: in the [[Bankhead Tunnel]]; in a large hangar at Mobile Downtown Airport (alien mothership arrival) and some exterior shots near the hangar; and in a West Mobile suburb (exteriors at the Neary residence). Nearby [[Bay Minette]] stood in for [[Moorcroft, Wyoming]] in the rail-station evacuation scene.

Most of the Steven Segal movie [[Under Siege]] costaring [[Tommy Lee Jones]] were filmed on the [[USS Alabama]] which is on display to the public docked on Mobile Bay at Battleship Park.
  
Mobile ranks third on the list of cities that have produced the most members of the Baseball Hall of Fame (Five: Hank Aaron, Billy Williams, Willie McCovey, Satchel Paige, and Ozzie Smith). New York City and Chicago are first and second, respectively. 

Among some Mobilians, there is a certain prestige associated with being a native.  Those residents consider themselves blessed by the fact that they were "conceived under an Azalea Bush and raised in the shallow waters of Mobile Bay."

The local pop band, [http://www.theuglistick.com The Ugli Stick], performs a song written by lead singer Eric Erdmann, called "The D.I.P. Song" which references his blue collar neighborhood in Mobile ("DIP" is Dauphin Island Parkway).

Several people migrated from Mobile to an area in [[Arizona]] which was then named [[Mobile, Arizona|"Mobile"]].  It was founded in the early [[1900s]] as an area for [[African-Americans]] to live and some of its early residents were [[sharecroppers]] from Mobile, Alabama.

The Regional Football League had one football season before going bankrupt, its champion for the year was the Mobile-based Admirals, which was the only franchise in the league which did not default.

'''Pronunciation''':  As pronounced by long-term residents, the second syllable of "Mobile" is emphasized "mo-BEEL" when ending a phrase ("American Mardi Gras began in Mobile"); however, within a phrase, both syllables get similar stress, as in "Mobile County."  This is similar to emphasizing "York" in "New York, New York" versus "New York City" stressing ''City'' ([http://www.bartleby.com/61/wavs/93/M0359300.wav "Hear how to properly pronounce Mobile"]).
