'''Cape Lisburne''' is a Cape in [[Alaska]]. It is located at the NW point of the [[Lisburne Peninsula]] on the [[Chukchi Sea]] coast, 40 mi. NE of village of [[Point Hope]], Arctic Slope. 

The first European to sight this cape was [[Captain Cook]]. He named it in August 21, 1778 and wrote: ''"The southern extreme seemed to form a point which was named Cape Lisburne."'' 

An early [[Inuit]] name for the cape was "Uivaq," generally spelled "[[Wevok, Alaska|Wevok]]" or "Wevuk". Cape Lisburne was often referred to as "Uivaq Ungasiktoq" meaning "distant cape" as opposed to "Uivaq Qanitoq" (Cape Thompson) meaning "near cape."
