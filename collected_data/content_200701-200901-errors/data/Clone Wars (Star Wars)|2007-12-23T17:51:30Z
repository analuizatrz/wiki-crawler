The '''Clone Wars''' (also known as the '''Clone War''') are a series of fictional [[Star Wars galaxy|intragalactic]] battles in [[George Lucas]]'s [[science fiction]] saga ''[[Star Wars]]''. The conflict is first mentioned in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' (1977),<ref name="CloneWarsBasics">{{cite web | author= | title="Starwars.com: What are the Clone Wars?"| url=http://www.starwars.com/clonewars/about/whatarecw.html | publisher=[[Starwars.com]] | year=[[2006]] | accessmonthday=August 3 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> but not featured until the second and third episodes of the six-part ''Star Wars'' film series: ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) and ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005). The animated [[microseries]] ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'' (2003-2005) chronicle the major campaigns of the war. Additional events and stories are detailed in a multimedia campaign consisting of ''Star Wars'' [[Expanded Universe (Star Wars)|literature and video games]]. Many of the events featured have parallels in history, politics, and mythology from which Lucas and other writers drew inspiration. Critics and film historians debate which parallels are most prominent or consistent.

The Clone Wars begin during the Separatist Crisis when thousands of [[solar system|star systems]] [[seceded]] from the [[Galactic Republic (Star Wars)|Galactic Republic]] to form the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] (CIS). The [[Battle of Geonosis|first battle]] occurs on the CIS planet [[Geonosis]] where the Republic's new [[clone trooper|clone army]], led by [[Jedi]] generals, combats the Separatists' [[battle droids]].  War quickly spreads across the galaxy and eventually reaches the Republic's capital, [[Coruscant]]. The Clone Wars end shortly after the [[Great Jedi Purge]], the Separatist Massacre on [[Mustafar]], and the establishment of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. The events causing the war and those leading to its conclusion are orchestrated by the Republic's chief executive, [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine]].<ref name="Trilogy">[[George Lucas|Lucas, George]]. The ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy (1977 – 2005)</ref>

== Origins ==
The beginnings of the war are first portrayed in the 1999 film ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' (the first chapter but fourth release in the series) as the [[Invasion of Theed]] and the [[Battle of Naboo]]. However, the real tension begins with the Separatist Crisis, a series of debates in the [[Galactic Republic]] that are referred to in ''Attack of the Clones'', and began about two years prior to the start of that film. By the beginning of ''Attack of the Clones'', many [[solar system|star systems]] have [[secession|seceded]] from the Republic. The tension caused by this secession eventually leads to the outbreak of war.<ref name="PalpatineRise">{{cite web | author= | title="Palpatine at Star Wars: Databank"| url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/palpatine/index.html | publisher=[[Starwars.com]]|year=[[2006]] | accessmonthday=August 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The war has different causes: The Republic's Chancellor [[Palpatine]] tells his people that the war began because of several different reasons such as the years of separation by the outer rim territories, the separatists capture of the Jedi and the Separatists financing of rebellions by radical states within the Republic. While these are all true, Palpatine had covertly influenced all these events with the help of his secret apprentice, Count Dooku.

By the end of ''Revenge of the Sith'', it is clear that the war was engineered by Palpatine to facilitate both his own rise to power and the formation of the Galactic Empire. He plays both sides against each other &mdash; as a Republic Senator (and later Chancellor), advocating the Republic to stop the threat of secession, and as the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious, by advising the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatists]]. The Clone Wars thus become the first of two major [[civil war]]s in the ''Star Wars'' galaxy, the other being the [[Galactic Civil War]] that makes up the main conflict of the second trilogy.

== Story ==
The conflicts leading up to the Clone Wars begin 32 years before the events of ''A New Hope'' and during the second half of the film ''The Phantom Menace''. The Trade Federation, a major galactic trade organization, blockades the small planet Naboo and demands the capitulation of the world by its queen, [[Padmé Amidala]], who refuses their demands and requests help from the [[Galactic Republic (Star Wars)|Galactic Republic]], the main governing body of the galaxy. The Republic responds by sending two [[Jedi]] ambassadors, Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his apprentice [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] to oversee the situation and negotiate with the Trade Federation. The Federation, wary of the Jedi and secretly taking orders from [[Darth Sidious]], attempt to murder the Jedi, who escape to Naboo just as the Federation begins a full-scale invasion. Following a brief occupation, the Trade Federation are defeated by an alliance of the Naboo military and the indigenous Gungan Tribes, with the help of the Jedi. <ref>{{cite web | author=George Lucas | title="Star Wars: The Phantom Menace Script at IMSDb| url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-The-Phantom-Menace.html | publisher=[[IMSDb]] and [[Lucasfilm]]|year=[[1999]] | accessmonthday=August 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Following these events, Jedi [[Count Dooku|Dooku]] resigns his commission and returns to his homeworld of Serenno.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title="Count Dooku at Star Wars: Databank"| url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/countdooku/index.html | publisher=[[Starwars.com]] | year=[[2006]] | accessmonthday=August 3 |accessyear=2006}}</ref>  Unbeknownst to the [[Jedi Council]], Dooku has fallen under the control of Sith master [[Darth Sidious]], who begins organizing a separatist coalition of planets and civilizations with the intention of seceding from the Republic. During this time, the Separatists begin forming their own armies, which primarily consist of battle droids constructed by the Trade Federation and their allies.

Following the attempted assassination of Senator Padmé Amidala, Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker's investigation puts them on the trail of [[Jango Fett]], an intergalactic bounty hunter. Tracking him to the world of Kamino, Obi-Wan discovers that the Kaminoans have used samples of Fett's DNA to clone a vast army of soldiers, called [[Clone Trooper]]s. The order for the soldiers was submitted to the Kaminoans by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, later revealed to be an alias of Count Dooku. Meanwhile, the Republic soon faces internal opposition as several thousand worlds publicly secede from the Galactic Republic and form the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], or CIS. The Republic Senate proposes the Military Creation Act, allowing for the development of a large military to prevent further secession and civil war. Before the act can be voted upon, the Confederacy's military forces on [[Geonosis]] are discovered and the subsequent [[Battle of Geonosis]] is waged, which essentially proves the necessity of such an army. [[Palpatine|Chancellor Palpatine]], the then Head of State of the Republic, is quickly granted emergency powers by the Republic Senate, which he uses to raise the Grand Army of the Republic, a large military force made up of the Clone Troopers illicitly commissioned by Dooku and Sidious. The Battle of Geonosis marks the end of ''Attack of the Clones'' and the beginning of the Clone War.

During the in-universe time period between ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'', conflict between the Republic and the Separatists increases and expands, which is chronicled in an extensive [[#Multimedia campaign|Multimedia campaign]].

Three years after the Battle of Geonosis, the Confederacy [[Battle of Coruscant|attempts to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine]] from the Republic capital world of [[Coruscant]]. The Chancellor is rescued and Confederacy leader Count Dooku killed, thanks to the efforts of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.

At this point in the Clone Wars timeline, the Outer Rim Sieges are in full swing, as well as numerous other battles across the galaxy. The Jedi are considered battle commanders, far outranking clones in terms of battle prowess, and are spread thin across the galaxy. One of the key battles of the Outer Rim Sieges is the Battle of Utapau, depicted in ''Revenge of the Sith''; during the battle, Obi-Wan strikes a crippling blow to the Confederacy by killing one of their most prominent leaders, [[General Grievous]].

Left behind by Obi-Wan on Coruscant, Anakin discovers that Palpatine is also Darth Sidious, Sith leader of the Confederacy. He informs [[Mace Windu]], who promptly comes with a posse of Jedi Knights to detain the corrupt Chancellor. A furious duel ensues, until only Windu and Palpatine are left standing. Skywalker arrives at the Chancellor's quarters to find Palpatine at the mercy of Windu's lightsaber. Anakin, promised by Palpatine enough power to save his wife Padmé from death, slashes Windu's lightsaber hand off, allowing Palpatine to kill Windu. Palpatine/Sidious takes Anakin as his new Sith Apprentice, after losing Dooku, and gives him the Sith name [[Darth Vader]]. Anakin has now completely fallen under the sway of the Dark Side.

Utilizing the attack by Mace Windu and the Jedi as a pretext, Palpatine issues [[Order 66]], a pre-arranged military command ordering all Clone Troopers to execute their Jedi commanders. The newly-christened Darth Vader leads the [[Operation:Knightfall|raid on the Jedi Temple]] with the [[501st Legion (Star Wars)|501st Clone Trooper Legion]] and kills all the Jedi in the Temple, including children Jedi living in the Temple. The handful of survivors of the [[Great Jedi Purge]] include Yoda and Obi-Wan. 

With the extermination of the Jedi complete, Palpatine marks an end to the Republic, naming himself ruler of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. During this time, Emperor Palpatine dispatches Vader to Mustafar to kill the rest of the Separatist leaders. With the elimination of the Confederacy leadership, Palpatine orders all battle droids to be shut down immediately, effectively ending the war.

In the ''Star Wars'' timeline, both the Clone Wars and its results are portrayed as the process which shifted the Galactic Republic from a [[democracy]] to a [[dictatorship]]. In a 2002 [[TIME Magazine]] interview, ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] explains:

: "All [[democracy|democracies]] turn into [[dictatorship]]s&mdash;but not by coup. The people give their democracy to a dictator, whether it's [[Julius Caesar]] or [[Napoleon]] or [[Adolf Hitler]]. Ultimately, the general population goes along with the idea. What kinds of things push people and institutions in this direction? That's the issue I've been exploring: how did the Republic turn into the Empire? … How does a good person go bad, and how does a democracy become a dictatorship?"<ref>{{cite web | author=TIME Magazine | title="All democracies turn into dictatorships…" | url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/670092/posts | publisher=[[TIME Magazine]]|year=[[2002-04-21]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In ''Attack of the Clones'', [[Palpatine]] orchestrates the Separatist movement (and the Clone Wars that followed) to worry the citizens of the Republic, thus forcing the Senate to grant him emergency powers. According to character [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], these powers increase as the Clone Wars extend into a search for [[General Grevious]], who replaces [[Count Dooku]] as Separatist leader.<ref>"'''OBI-WAN:''' The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today." {{cite web | author=George Lucas | title="Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Script at IMSDb"| url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-Revenge-of-the-Sith.html | publisher=[[IMSDb]] and [[Lucasfilm]] | year=[[2005-05-19]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>"'''PALPATINE:''' That may be true, but with Count Dooku dead, [General Grevious] is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive." {{cite web | author=George Lucas | title="Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Script at IMSDb"| url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-Revenge-of-the-Sith.html | publisher=[[IMSDb]] and [[Lucasfilm]] | year=[[2005-05-19]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> During ''Revenge of the Sith'', Palpatine declares himself Emperor by blaming the Jedi for the Republic's problems, resulting in a Jedi purge via [[Order 66]].<ref>"'''PALPATINE/DARTH SlDIOUS:''' Commander Cody, the time has come.

Comparisons have been made between the political aspects of the Clone Wars and the events leading up to [[World War II]]. Radio host [[Clyde Lewis]]' article on historical similarities in Star Wars claims that Palpatine's tactics parallel those of [[Adolf Hitler]] and Nazi Germany; both leaders used wars and [[scapegoat]]s to manipulate society's emotional state, thus providing the leadership with support and power.<ref>{{cite web | author=Clyde Lewis | title="The Sith Sense"| url=http://www.groundzeromedia.org/dis/sith/sith.shtml | publisher=[[Ground Zero]] | year=[[2005]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> This viewpoint was also expressed in an editorial on the Clone Wars Unofficial Website.<ref>{{cite web | author=Andrew Liptak | title="The Sith Sense"| url=http://www.clonewarz.com/features/editorials/cwempire.htm | publisher=The Clone Wars Unofficial Website | year=[[2003-06-17]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Another writer compares the Clone Wars with [[World War II]] in general, basing his argument on the fact that Lucas was born during the [[baby boomer]] generation, and the [[Galactic Civil War|dark times]] featured in the original trilogy rival the dark, uncertain [[Cold War]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Stephen Chambers | title="Star Wars As Baby Boomer Script"| url=http://www.radicalcenter.net/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=52 | publisher=Radical Center | year=[[2006-04-18]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>  Lucas, however, cited in multiple interviews that one of his primary influences for the political backdrop behind the Clone Wars (and all of Star Wars) was the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]/[[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] era, when leaders embraced corruption for what they thought was the best course of action.<ref>{{cite web | author=David Germain | title="'Star Wars' Raises Questions on US Policy" | url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0517-07.htm | publisher=Associated Press | year=[[2005-05-17]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Chris Burns | title="Lucas on Iraq war, 'Star Wars'" | url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/16/cannes.starwars/ | publisher=CNN.com|year=[[2005-05-16]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

There is a variety of opinions on the historical parallels between the political aspects of the Clone Wars and the [[War in Iraq]]. In claiming that the Star Wars galaxy under the deceitful Palpatine parallels the modern issues of the [[United States]], an editorial on [[Antiwar.com]] states that "[Star Wars] establishes first the generally agreeable premise that it's right to overthrow oppressive government, before bringing into focus something more discomforting – that the corrupt tyranny referred to is our own".<ref>{{cite web | author=Scott Horton | title="Star Wars and the American Empire"| url=http://www.antiwar.com/orig/horton.php?articleid=6041 | publisher=AntiWar.com | year=[[2005-05-23]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Additionally, an article from Wiretap claims that "like Palpatine, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration has been able to feed on people's fears to gain more power".<ref>{{cite web | author=Brian Fanelli | title="U.S. Politics in "A Galaxy Far, Far Away""| url=http://www.wiretapmag.org/stories/22284 | year=[[2005-06-22]]}}</ref> However, in an interview with Kiro 7 News, ''Star Wars'' producer [[Rick McCallum]] explained:

: "George is a product of Vietnam, not a product of Bush. [The political aspects of the Clone Wars] has been in the context of every script I've ever read&mdash;every draft&mdash;way before Bush became president…"<ref>{{cite web | author=Tim Lammers | title="DVD Is Hardly End For 'Sith' Producer McCallum"| url=http://www.kirotv.com/starwars/5221153/detail.html | publisher=KIROTV.com | year=[[2005-11-02]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Lucas claims, however, that "The parallels between what we did in Vietnam and what we're doing in Iraq now are unbelievable."  Nevertheless, he states that "When I wrote [the backstory/Clone Wars], Iraq didn't exist".<ref>{{cite web | author=David Germain | title="'Star Wars' Raises Questions on US Policy" | url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0517-07.htm | publisher=Associated Press | year=[[2005-05-17]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The Clone Wars parallel the [[American Civil War]] in many respects. The Confederacy of Independent Systems shares a similar name to the [[Confederate States of America]]; it also seceded from the Republic, much like the south seceded from the Union. Like Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]], Count Dooku was respected by his enemies, and had he survived, he most likely would have been accepted by them.<ref>{{cite book | first=Matthew Woodring | last=Stover | authorlink=Matthew Stover | year=2005 | title=Revenge of the Sith | publisher=Del Rey | id=ISBN 0-345-42883-8}}</ref> (It must be remembered, however, that few knew Dooku was secretly workng for the Sith and Palpatine. Had the general public known this, they would never have accepted him.)

=== Star Wars ===
A portion of the vehicles developed by the [[Lucasfilm]] graphic designers, including the [[AT-TE]] and the [[AT-XT#AT-XT|AT-XT]] walkers, were created to enhance the technological continuity of the Clone Wars in relation to the [[Galactic Civil War]], the central conflict in the original trilogy of ''Star Wars'' films.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title="AT-TE walker at Star Wars: Databank"| url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/vehicle/atte/?id=bts | publisher=[[Starwars.com]] | year=[[2006]] | accessmonthday=August 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Other examples of technological continuity is displayed at the Battle of Coruscant, in which  [[List of Star Wars starfighters#ARC-170 starfighter|ARC-170 starfighters]] were designed with S-foils, much like those seen in the ship designs of the original films.<ref>'''PILOT''': We're on your tail, General Kenobi!

In the original trilogy, the Clone Wars are only referenced in ''A New Hope''. Lucas stated that he first designed a backstory which preceded the original film trilogy &mdash; the events surrounding the Clone War era.<ref name="Idea"> ''All I Need Is An Idea'' DVD Special Featurette, [2001]</ref>

The Clone Wars span the three years between ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'', and thus are, for the most part, off-screen. The Expanded Universe is recounting events with an ambitious [[multimedia]] campaign.<ref name="CloneWarsBasics" />

The videogame ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' was released in 2002 for [[PlayStation 2]], [[GameCube]], and [[Xbox]].  It is set immediately after the final events of ''Attack of the Clones'', and spans many new worlds and settings not mentioned in the films or novelizations. Additionally, ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II]]'' expand the scenarios of the conflict and add new angles to previously covered battles.

The cartoon [[miniseries|microseries]] ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'' started airing in November 2003 on [[Cartoon Network]]. It was a series of 20 episodes, each three to five minutes long, showing several of the battles of the war not mentioned in any of the films.

Another [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|TV series]], of more than one hundred episodes, unrelated to the previous one, is also in production by Lucasfilms Animation and Lucasfilms Animation Singapore.  It is scheduled to become a [[3D computer graphics|3D animated]] television series.<ref>{{cite web | author=BBC News | title=Star Wars to become new TV series | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4484915.stm | publisher=[[BBC News]]|year=[[2005-04-26]] | accessmonthday=May 5 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The comic series ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' has also shed light on this era of the ''Star Wars'' universe, focusing in particular on the exploits of the Jedi characters Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, [[Quinlan Vos]], and [[Aayla Secura]].<ref name="CloneWarsBasics" /> Multiple series of [[List of Star Wars books#The Clone Wars Series (22.5 BBY - 19.5 BBY)|novels]] based on all aspects of the Clone Wars have been published, as well.
