[[East Sussex]], [[United Kingdom]]</ref> is a type of [[alternative medicine]], highly controversial among experts, that aims to treat "like with like."  The term "homoeopathy" was coined by the [[Germany|German]] physician [[Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann]] ([[1755]]&ndash;[[1843]]) and first appeared in print in 1807.<ref>Hahnemann, S.

Homeopathic treatment involves giving a patient with symptoms of an illness extremely small or nonexistent dose of the agents that, according to its canon, produce the same symptoms in healthy people when exposed to larger quantities.  A homeopathic remedy is prepared by diluting the substance in a series of steps.  Most homeopathic remedies are so highly diluted that few or no molecules of the original substance are likely to remain after dilution so rendering them ineffective as treatments.<ref>Ernst, E. and Kaptchuk, T.J., ''Homeopathy Revisited,'' Archives of Internal Medicine,  156(19):2162-4, 1996, PMID 8885813</ref><ref>Kleijnen, J., Knipschild, P., and ter Riet, G, ''Clinical Trials of Homeopathy,'' British Medical Journal, 302(6782):316-23, 1991, PMID 1825800</ref> Homeopathy asserts that the remedy will [[Water Memory|retain a memory]] of the diluted substance and the therapeutic potency of a remedy can be increased by serial dilution combined with [[succussion]], or vigorous shaking.

==History of homeopathy==
{{main|History of homeopathy}}
Although the reasoning behind homeopathy extends at least as far back as the [[Ancient Greeks]], the modern "father of homeopathy" was the German physician Samuel Hahnemann, who began outlining his theories of "''[[Law of similars|medical similars]]''" in a series of articles and monographs in [[1796]],<ref>Hahnemann, S. Versuch über ein neues Prinzip zur Auffindung der Heilkräfte der Arzneisubstanzen, nebst einigen Blicken auf die bisherigen. [Hufeland's] J. d. pract. Arzkd. (1796) 2(3):391-439 and 2(4):465-561. This article can be read in English translation on the [http://www.minutus.org/index.asp Minutus] website, where it appears as [http://www.minutus.org/library/article_read.asp?id=6 ''Essay On A New Principle For Ascertaining The Curative Powers Of Drugs - Birth of Homeopat''], [[Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann]], 1796.</ref> though the term "homeopathy" did not appear in his writings until [[1807]].<ref>Hahnemann, S. Fingerzeige auf den homöopathischen Gebrauch der Arzneien in der bisherigen Praxis. [Hufeland's] N. J. d. pract. Arzkd. (1807) 26:5-43</ref> Hahnemann's main opus in homeopathy was the book, ''[[The Organon of the Healing Art|The Organon of Medicine]]'', with five editions published between 1810 and 1842.<ref>The six editions were published in [[Leipzig]], 1810 (1st edition); Leipzig, end of the year, 1818 (2nd edition); [[Kothen]], Easter, 1824 (3rd edition); Kothen, January, 1829 (4th edition); and Kothen, March 28th, 1833 (5th edition). A sixth edition was written and finished in [[Paris]] around February 1842, but was not published until the 1900s.  These first five editions were published in German, and the 5th Edition was translated by Robert Ellis Dudgeon in 1893. The 6th Edition was translated by William Boericke and published in 1922. There have subsequently been many other translations, such as a version in 1996 by Steven Decker, and a recent French version by Pierre Schmidt and Jost Kunzli.</ref>

==Philosophy and Treatments==
{{see also|Homeopathic techniques}}
Homeopathy regards diseases as <cite>morbid derangements of the organism</cite>,<ref name="organon-11">[http://www.homeopathyhome.com/reference/organon/4.html#11 ''Organon Of Medicine § 11''], Samuel Hahnemann, Web Version Copyright&nbsp;© 1997 Homeopathy Home</ref> and states that instances of disease in different people differ fundamentally.<ref>[http://www.homeoint.org/morrell/articles/uniqueness.htm ''Homeopathy Views the Uniqueness of Each Patient''], Peter Morrell, [http://www.homeoint.org/morrell/articles/index.htm Articles on Homeopathy by Peter Morrell], July 2003.</ref> Homeopathy views a sick person as having a dynamic disturbance in a hypothetical "[[vital force]]", a disturbance which, homeopaths claim, underlies standard medical diagnoses of named diseases.<ref>[http://www.lyghtforce.com/HomeopathyOnline/Issue3/sequence.html ''Taking Homeopathy into the Shadows: A Sequential Causal Approach to Treating Chronic Disease''], Rudolf Verspoor, Homeopathy Online, October-December 1996, Vol. 1, No. 3</ref> 

Homeopathy is based on the 'principle of similars', first expressed by Hahnemann as ''similia similibus curentur'' or 'let likes cure likes'. This is  opposite to the 'principle of contraries' which was central to the [[Galenic formulation|Galenic]] medicine in which  Hahnemann had been trained. The '[[law of similars]]' is an ancient medical maxim,<ref>[http://www.tcfnm.com/homeopathy.htm Homeopathy], Dr. Peterson, Center for Natural Medicine, Winona, Minnesota</ref><ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/532.html ''Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann''], [http://whonamedit.com Who Named it?] </ref> but its modern form is based on Hahnemann's hypothesis that a constellation of symptoms induced by a given homeopathic remedy in a group of healthy individuals will cure a similar set of symptoms in the sick. Symptom patterns associated with various remedies are determined by '[[Homeopathic proving|provings]]', in which healthy volunteers are given remedies, of varying concentrations, and the resulting physical and mental symptoms are compiled by observers into a "''drug picture''".<ref>[http://www.hpathy.com/materiamedica/hahnemann-materia-pura/china.asp ''CHINA (Cinchona Bark.)''], [[Samuel Hahnemann]], [[Materia Medica Pura]], vol. iii, 2nd edit., 1825, [http://www.hpathy.com/ Homeopathy for Everyone: Everything Homeopathic!]</ref>

The law of similars is more of a guiding principle than a [[scientific law]]. It is not built on a hypothesis that can be [[falsifiability|falsified]]. A failure to cure homeopathically can always be ostensibly attributed to incorrect selection of a remedy.

There are many methods for determining the most-similar remedy (the ''simillimum''), and homeopaths sometimes disagree. This is partly due to the complexity of the "''totality of symptoms''" concept. That is, homeopaths do not use all symptoms, but decide which are the most characteristic. This subjective evaluation of case analysis relies on knowledge and experience. Finally, the ''drug picture'' in the [[Homeopathic Materia Medica]] is always more comprehensive than the symptoms exhibited by any individual. These factors mean that a homeopathic prescription can remain presumptive until it is verified by testing the effect of the remedy on the patient.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}   

Hahnemann [[homeopathic proving|tested]] many substances commonly used as medicines in his time, such as [[antimony]] and [[rhubarb]], and also poisons like [[arsenic]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[belladonna]], to discover what symptoms they produced in healthy individuals. Homeopathy uses many animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances. Examples include ''natrum muriaticum'' ([[sodium chloride|common salt]]), ''[[lachesis muta]]'' ([[bushmaster (snake)|bushmaster snake venom]]), ''[[opium]]'', and ''[[thyroid hormone|thyroidinum]]''. 

Other homeopathic remedies involve dilution of the agent or product of the disease. These are the so-called "''[[Isopathy|isopathic remedies]]''", and include ''[[nosode]]s'' made from diseased tissue, and ''[[sarcode]]s'' made from healthy tissue. [[Rabies]] [[nosode]], for example, is made by diluting the saliva of a rabid dog. Apis mel., another homeopathic remedy, is made from the venom of the [[Western honey bee]], and is used to treat bee stings and fever induced by viral infections.

Today, about 3000 remedies are used in homeopathy; about 300 are based on comprehensive [[Homeopathic Materia Medica]] information, and about 1500 on relatively fragmentary knowledge. The rest are used experimentally in difficult cases based on the law of similars, either without knowledge of their homeopathic properties or through speculative knowledge independent of the law of similars. This modern approach also harks back to the ancient '[[doctrine of signatures]],' which Hahnemann rejected as uncertain guesswork.<ref>[http://www.hpathy.com/materiamedica/hahnemann-materia-pura/chelidonium.asp ''CHELIDONIUM MAJUS (Celandine.)''], [[Samuel Hahnemann]], [[Materia Medica Pura]], vol. iv, 2nd edit., 1825.,[http://www.hpathy.com/ Homeopathy for Everyone: Everything Homeopathic!]</ref>

===Modern efforts to further develop homeopathy===

The constant efforts by homeopaths to develop new treatments are driven by many different forces. For example, some are tempted to use an [[isopathy|isopathic]], or disease-associated agent as a first prescription in a 'stuck' case when the beginning of disease coincides with a specific event such as [[vaccination]].<ref>[http://www.hpathy.com/tautopathy/tautopathy.asp ''Tautopathy - An Introduction''], Manish Bhatia, [[Tautopathy]], [http://www.hpathy.com/ Homeopathy for Everyone: Everything Homeopathic!]</ref> Also, it is common to try a chemically-related substance when a remedy that was well-indicated fails. A good example of this is the use of  ''[[bowel]] [[nosode]]s'',<ref>[http://homeoint.org/books5/paterson/index.htm ''The Bowel Nosodes''], John Paterson, Br Homeopath J., 1950 Jul;40(3):153-62., PMID 15426696</ref> which were introduced by the British homeopaths, [[Edward Bach]] (1886–1936), John Paterson and Charles Edwin Wheeler in the 1920s. Their use is based on the variable bowel [[bacterial]] [[Gut flora|flora]] thought to be associated with persons of different homeopathic constitutional types. Though receiving more attention today, the ''bowel nosodes'' are rarely used outside British homeopathy.

More recently, homeopathy has embraced substances based on their elemental classification (the [[periodic table]] or biological [[taxonomy]]).<ref>[http://www.homeoinfo.com/06_materia_medica/remedies/modern_divisions.php ''Modern Divisions''], Douglas Hoff, [http://homeoinfo.com/ Classical Homeopathy]</ref><ref>[http://janscholten.com/page5.html ''Jan Scholten''], Jan Scholten, 2004
</ref> This approach may create convenient systems for grouping remedies and classifying the ever-burgeoning [[Homeopathic Materia Medica]], but its usefulness is questioned by some purists on the basis that it involves speculation about remedy action without provings.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060117192852/www.simillimum.com/Thelittlelibrary/Bookreviewsarticles/reviewscholten.html ''REVIEW OF SCHOLTEN'S HOMEOPATHY AND MINERALS: The Minerals in Homoeopathy''], David Little, Homeopathic Online Education, 1998.</ref>

Some modern homeopaths are exploring the use of even more esoteric substances. These are known as "imponderables", because they do not originate from a material but from [[electromagnetic energy]] or other energy presumed to have been "captured" by a substance like [[alcohol]] or [[lactose]]. The captured "energy" can be in many forms, such as ''[[X-rays]]'', ''[[Sol]]'' (sunlight), ''[[Positronium]]'',<ref>[http://www.hominf.org/posi/posiintr.htm ''Anti Matter: The Homœopathic Proving of Positronium - A Remedy prepared from the Annihilation Radiation of Positronium, an atomic structure consisting of an electron and a positron''], Misha Norland & TG 15, School of Homœopathy, 1998.</ref> ''[[electricity|Electricitas]]''<ref>[http://homeoint.org/clarke/e/elect.htm  ''Electricitas: Electricity. The effects of atmospheric electricity and static electricity. Attenuations are made from sugar of milk saturated with the current.''], John Henry CLARKE, A DICTIONARY OF PRACTICAL MATERIA MEDICA, Médi-T ®</ref> or even light collected using a [[telescope]] (for example, from the star ''[[Polaris]]''). Recent ventures by homeopaths into even more esoteric substances include  ''Tempesta''<ref>[http://uk.geocities.com/veryscarymary/stormremedy1.html The Homeopathic Proving of 'Tempesta' the Storm], Mary English, registered member of the Society of Homeopaths</ref> (thunderstorm), and  ''Berlin wall''.<ref>[http://www.biolumanetics.net/tantalus/Cases/BerlinWall.htm ''THE BERLIN WALL: A REMEDY OF POWER''], Charles Wansbrough, [http://www.biolumanetics.net/tantalus/ PRECISION HOMEOPATHY: Engineering clarity through a Techno-Shamanic Process Bioliminal Homeopathy]
</ref>

==Miasms as a cause of disease==

Another important component of homeopathy is the concept of "''miasms''". Hahnemann hypothesized that certain illnesses leave behind some residual damage, or ''miasm'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "stain" or "[[dyscrasia|imbalance]]"), which is postulated to be responsible for chronic diseases, and is said to be passed on genetically. There are three types of miasms in homeopathy:

#[[syphilis]], resulting in damage to the brain, nerves, and bones, resulting in deafness, insanity, alcoholism, etc. 
# "sycosis", a term used in homeopathy to refer to suppressed [[gonorrhoea]], damaging the [[mucous membrane]]s and genital tract, producing sensitivity to damp weather and storms
#"[[psora]]", damaging the skin, resulting in many types of internal disease states

Hahneman developed his miasm hypothesis because he was concerned about the failures of his homeopathic remedies to produce lasting cures for chronic diseases. By 1816,  Hahnemann had noticed that ''"…the non-venereal chronic diseases, after being time and again removed homoeopathically … always returned in a more or less varied form and with new symptoms."''<ref>[http://homeoint.org/books/hahchrdi/hahchr00.htm ''The Chronic Diseases, their Peculiar Nature and their Homœopathic Cure''], Samuel Hahnemann, page 5, 1928, Presented By Médi-T</ref>

To explain this, Hahnemann introduced his miasmatic hypothesis. Hahnemann's miasm theory was first published in 1828 in his book, ''The Chronic Diseases, their Nature and Homoeopathic Treatment''.<ref>The Chronic Diseases, their Nature and Homoeopathic Treatment, [[Samuel Hahnemann]], [[Dresden]] and [[Leipsic]], Arnold, Vols. 1, 2, 3, 1828; vol. 4, 1830</ref> 

Hahnemann hypothesized that the miasm of [[psora]] underpinned most chronic diseases. The word "miasm" is related to an old medical concept known as the "[[miasma theory of disease]]", where the term "miasma" represents "pestiferous exhalations". Hahnemann described this in Note 2 to §11 of the [[The Organon of the Healing Art|Organon]]: 
''"…a child with small-pox or measles communicates to a near, untouched healthy child in an invisible manner (dynamically) the [[small-pox]] or [[measles]], … in the same way as the magnet communicated to the near needle the magnetic property."''<ref name="organon-11"/> 

According to Hahnemann, miasmatic infection causes local symptoms, usually in the skin. If these are suppressed by external medication, the hidden cause goes deeper, and manifests itself later as organ pathologies. In §80 of the ''[[The Organon of the Healing Art|Organon]]'' he asserted [[psora]] to be the cause of such diseases as [[epilepsy]], [[kyphosis]], [[cancer]], [[jaundice]], [[deafness]], and [[cataract]].<ref>[http://www.homeopathyhome.com/reference/organon/30.html#80 ''Organon of Medicine §80''], [[Samuel Hahnemann]], §80</ref>

According to Hahnemann, the body can become susceptible to "morbific noxious agents" that cause disease. Homeopaths try to prevent disease, starting with the first symptoms, which can be displayed long before an acute disease appears.<ref>Organon § 31 </ref> However, Hahnemann recognized that sometimes a large group of people are beset by the same acute disease simultaneously, perhaps because of wars, floods, and famines and other causes, and an epidemic ensues.<ref>Organon § 73</ref>  Hahneman advocated administering one or even a few remedies to a population to prevent a threatened epidemic.<ref>Organon § 33</ref>  According to Hahnemann, when an epidemic begins the homeopath can produce an appropriate remedy for each individual patient from a small collection of remedies.<ref>Organon § 100-104</ref><ref>[http://www.homeopathy.healthspace.eu/regular/homeopathy.php#Homeopathy-vaccination Homeopathy and vaccination.] HealthSpace Health elements.</ref>

However, the miasm theory was not widely accepted. Even in his own time, many followers of Hahnemann, including the American homeopathy pioneer [[Constantine Hering]], made almost no reference to Hahnemann’s concept of chronic diseases and the miasm hypothesis. Today, some homeopathic practitioners find Hahnemann’s theory difficult to reconcile with current knowledge of [[immunology]], [[genetics]], [[microbiology]] and [[pathology]], as it seems to ignore the importance of genetic, [[congenital]], [[metabolic]], [[nutritional]], and [[degenerative]] factors in [[sickness]].<ref>[http://www.homeopathy.ca/articles/interview-2001-2.html ''Homeopathy is a Natural Science in its Purest Sense: Interview with André Saine, N.D., F.C.A.H., Part 2''], Ralf and Karin Vigoureux,  September 13, 2001, originally published in German in the Zeitschrift für Klassische Homöopathie 2004; 48 (3): 117-127, The Canadian Academy of Homeopathy official website</ref>  The miasm theory also fails to differentiate between the multitude of [[infectious diseases]]. However, most insist that the key elements of Hahnemann's miasm theory are valid.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} For instance, most of them believe that the fundamental cause of disease is internal and constitutional (i.e. the susceptibility to becoming ill), and that it is contrary to good health to suppress symptoms, especially skin eruptions and discharges. They also accept Hahnemann's concept of latent [[psora]], the early signs of an organism’s imbalance, which indicate that treatment is needed to prevent the development of more advanced disease.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

== Classical versus non-classical homeopathy ==
{{refimprovesect|date=July 2007}}

Hahnemann's formulation of homeopathy is often referred to as ''classical homeopathy''. Classical homeopaths take a detailed patient history, often lasting more than one hour, base their prescription also on incidental or constitutional symptoms, and administer one remedy at a time at infrequent intervals (typically, not more than once a month).<ref name=Jones>[http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/138/5/393 ''A Critical Overview of Homeopathy''], 
Wayne B. Jonas, Ted J. Kaptchuk, Klaus Linde, Ann Intern Med., COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE SERIES, 2003;138:393-399.</ref>

By contrast, clinical or non-classical homeopathy treatments can involve more than one remedy at a time.<ref name=Jones/> For example, some multi-remedy homeopathic formulations are marketed for specific medical conditions. Some formulations use a 'shotgun' approach of the most commonly indicated single remedies in mixture form. Other formulations are proprietary mixtures marketed for specific diagnostic criteria.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

==Scientific critiques of homeopathic treatment==
Although some patients report benefits from homeopathic preparations,<ref>[http://www.homeopathy-soh.org/whats-new/documents/Positivehomeopathy.PDF An Overview of Positive Homeopathy Research and Surveys] (PDF), The European Network of Homeopathy Researchers (April 2005). The Society of Homeopaths.</ref> the large majority of scientists attribute this to the [[placebo effect]], the [[regression fallacy]] and/or the [[Forer effect]].{{clarifyme}} Ideally, drugs are tested in large, multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled [[double-blind]] [[clinical trials]], to test whether the drug has an effect that is significantly better than a placebo or an alternative treatment. Many clinical trials that partially meet these criteria have investigated homeopathy, and some have indicated efficacy above placebo.<ref>Wayne B. Jonas, Ted J. Kaptchuk, and Klaus Linde, [http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/138/5/393.pdf "A Critical Overview of Homeopathy"] (PDF), ''Ann. Intern. Med.'' 2003;138:393-399.</ref> However, many of the trials are open to technical criticism or involve samples that are too small to allow firm conclusions to be drawn.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Jonas WB, Anderson RL, Crawford CC, Lyons JS | title=A systematic review of the quality of homeopathic clinical trials | journal=BMC Complement Altern Med | year=2001 | pages=12 | volume=1 | id=PMID 11801202}}</ref>

Some advocates of homeopathy claim that orthodox [[double-blind]] trials are inherently insufficient for deriving evidence for the technique. For example, a spokeswoman from the UK [http://www.homeopathy-soh.org/ Society of Homeopaths] has said: "''It has been established beyond doubt and accepted by many researchers, that the placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial is not a fitting research tool with which to test homeopathy''"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4183916.stm|title=Homoeopathy's benefit questioned|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> since homeopathy is positioned as a [[holistic]] treatment, incorporating psychological/spiritual concerns as well as an active ingredient. In fact, these alleged attributes of homeopathy in no way invalidate the use of standard controls.  Such tests have debunked other supposedly "holistic" approaches, as in the case of the experiment conducted by [[Emily Rosa]] debunking [[Therapeutic Touch]]. If homeopathy does what it claims, a placebo-controlled, randomized test with double-blinds should detect such alleged benefits.  Some critics<ref>[http://www.skepdic.com/homeo.html The Skeptic's dictionary ''Homeopathy'']</ref> have noted that homeopathy ''includes'' falsifiable claims, even if that is only part of the homeopathic process, or simply that such claimed immunity from orthodox scientific scrutiny is reminiscent of [[Pseudoscience#Identifying pseudoscience|pseudoscience]].

===Early critiques of high dilutions===
[[John Forbes (physician)|Sir John Forbes]] (1787–1861), physician to [[Queen Victoria]] (1841–61), said the extremely small doses of homeopathy were regularly derided as useless, laughably ridiculous and "an outrage to human reason."<ref>Sir John Forbes, ''Homeopathy, Allopathy and Young Physic'', London, 1846</ref> Although such homeopathic cures were accepted as valid by regular physicians at the time, they were ascribed entirely to the body's innate healing powers. And Professor Sir [[James Young Simpson]] said of the highly diluted drugs: "no poison, however strong or powerful, the billionth or decillionth of which would in the least degree affect a man or harm a fly."<ref>James Y Simpson, ''Homoeopathy, Its Tenets and Tendencies, Theoretical, Theological and Therapeutical'', Edinburgh: Sutherland & Knox, 1853, 11</ref> Nineteenth century American physician and author [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] was a vocal critic of homeopathy and published an essay in 1842 entitled ''Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions''.

===Evidence-based medicine===
There is widespread consensus in the medical community that [[evidence-based medicine]] is the best standard for assessing efficacy and safety of health-care practices, for it is "the expression of the [[scientific method]] in clinical medicine."<ref>[http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/321/7258/442 "Declaration of Helsinki should be strengthened" ''BMJ'' 2000;321:442-445 ( 12 August )]</ref> Therefore, systematic reviews with strict protocols are essential to establish the substantion of various therapies. While committed to this principle, much of modern medicine is subject to ongoing efforts to comply with evidence-based standards.

Systematic reviews conducted by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found no evidence that homeopathy is beneficial for [[asthma]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab000353.html|title=''Cochrane Collaboration-asthma''}}</ref> [[dementia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003803.html|title=''Cochrane Collaboration-dementia''}}</ref> and [[induction (birth)|induction of labor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003399.html|title=''Cochrane Collaboration-induction of labor''}}</ref> They also found no evidence that homeopathic treatment can prevent [[influenza]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001957.html|title=''Cochrane Collaboration-influenza''}}</ref> but reported that it appears to shorten the duration of the disease. Systematic reviews conducted by other researchers found no evidence that homeopathy is beneficial for [[osteoarthritis]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/alternat/homearth.html|title=osteoarthritis article|publisher=Bandolier Journal}}</ref> [[Migraine#Treatment|migraine prophylaxis]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/alternat/AT015.html|title=migraine prophylaxis article|publisher=Bandolier Journal}}</ref> [[Delayed onset muscle soreness|delayed-onset muscle soreness]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/alternat/AT011|title=delayed-onset muscle soreness article|publisher=Bandolier Journal}}</ref> or symptoms of [[menopause]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band56/b56-3.html|title=symptoms of menopause article|publisher=Bandolier Journal}}</ref>

====Medical organizations' attitudes towards homeopathy====
The [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], part of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Institutes of Health]], states that:
* Results of individual, controlled clinical trials have been contradictory, with some saying it was no better than a placebo, with other trials having results "the researchers believed were greater than one would expect from a placebo."<ref name=NCAAMQ8>[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy/#q8 NCCAM statement on homeopathy, Question 8.]</ref> However, this implies a placebo was not actually used.
* "Systematic reviews have not found homeopathy to be a definitively proven treatment for any medical condition."<ref name=NCAAMQ8>[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy/#q8 NCCAM statement on homeopathy, Question 8.]</ref> 
*A number of its key concepts defy chemistry, physics, and other sciences.<ref name=NCAAMQ9>[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy/#q9 NCCAM statement on homeopathy, Question 9.]</ref>
*It is uncertain how a remedy with so little, "perhaps not even one molecule" of its active ingredient, could have any biological effect.<ref name=NCAAMQ9>[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy/#q9 NCCAM statement on homeopathy, Question 9.]</ref>
*Effects might be due to the placebo effect or similar non-specific effects.<ref name=NCAAMQ9>[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy/#q9 NCCAM statement on homeopathy, Question 9.]</ref>
*It is still largely untested whether it actually works for some of the diseases it's claimed to work for, and if it did work, how it would.
*NCAAM says that "there is a point of view" that it works, but is unexplained how, and that a lack of explanation is "not unique to homeopathy." It also says that some feel, as long as it seems "helpful and safe", no scientific explanation is necessary.<ref name=NCAAMQ9>[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy/#q9 NCCAM statement on homeopathy, Question 9.]</ref>
*It continues to fund research into homeopathy.<ref name=NCAAMQ10>[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy/#q10 NCCAM statement on homeopathy, Question 10.]</ref>

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[National Health Service]]'s "Health Encyclopedia" entry on homeopathy includes the following:
* Around 200 randomised controlled trials evaluating homeopathy have been conducted, and there are also several reviews of these trials. Despite the available research, ''no clinical evidence has shown that homeopathy works''. Many studies suggest that any effectiveness that homeopathy may have is due to the [[placebo effect]], where the act of receiving treatment is more effective than the treatment itself.<ref>[http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=197&sectionId=22124 NHS Health Encyclopedia entry on Homeopathy: Results]</ref>
* Medical doctors and scientists do not generally accept homeopathy because its claims have not been verified to the standards of modern medicine and the [[scientific method]]. Scientists argue that homeopathy cannot work because the remedies used are so highly diluted that in many there can be none of the active substance remaining.<ref>[http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=197&sectionId=22123 NHS Health Encyclopedia entry on Homeopathy: Dosage.]</ref>

In 1997, the following statement was adopted as policy of the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) after a report on a number of alternative therapies including homeopathy:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/13638.html|title=alternative theories including homeopathy|publisher=American Medical Association}}</ref>
* There is little evidence to confirm the safety or efficacy of most [[alternative medicine|alternative therapies]]. Much of the information currently known about these therapies makes it clear that many have not been shown to be efficacious. Well-designed, stringently controlled research should be done to evaluate the efficacy of alternative therapies.</blockquote>''
 
In 2005, [[the Lancet]] published an editorial entitled "The End of Homeopathy" which, citing repeated clinical trials, flatly declared homeopathic therapies to be ineffective, and urged doctors not to encourage patients to pursue such treatment. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4183916.stm Homeopathy's benefit questioned], BBC News, 26 Aug 2005.</ref>

== Safety of homeopathic treatment ==
The United States [[Food & Drug Administration]] considers that there is no real concern over the safety of most homeopathic products "because they have little or no pharmacologically active ingredients". There have been few reports of illness associated with the use of homeopathic products, but the medical literature contains a few case reports of poisoning by heavy metals such as arsenic<ref>{{cite journal | author=Chakraborti D, Mukherjee SC, Saha KC, Chowdhury UK, Rahman MM, Sengupta MK | title=Arsenic toxicity from homeopathic treatment | journal=J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | year=2003 | pages=963-7 | volume=41 | issue=7 | id=PMID 14705842}}</ref> and mercury<ref>{{cite journal | author=Montoya-Cabrera MA, Rubio-Rodriguez S, Velazquez-Gonzalez E, Avila Montoya S | title=Mercury poisoning caused by a homeopathic drug | journal=Gac Med Mex | year=1991 | pages=267-70 | volume=127 | issue=3 | id=PMID 1839288}} Article in Spanish.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Audicana M, Bernedo N, Gonzalez I, Munoz D, Fernandez E, Gastaminza G | title=An unusual case of baboon syndrome due to mercury present in a homeopathic medicine | journal=Contact Dermatitis | year=2001 | pages=185 | volume=45 | issue=3 | id=PMID 11553159}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Wiesmuller GA, Weishoff-Houben M, Brolsch O, Dott W, Schulze-Robbecke R | title=Environmental agents as cause of health disorders in children presented at an outpatient unit of environmental medicine | journal=Int J Hyg Environ Health | year=2002 | pages=329-35 | volume=205 | issue=5 | id=PMID 12173530}}</ref> found in homeopathic remedies. However, in cases that they reviewed, the FDA concluded the homeopathic product was not the cause of the adverse reactions. In one case, arsenic was implicated, although FDA analysis revealed that the concentration of arsenic was too low to cause concern. Perhaps the main concern about the safety of homeopathy arises not from the products themselves, but from the possible withholding of more efficacious treatment, or from misdiagnosis of dangerous conditions by a non-medically qualified homeopath.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/123/12301.htm Science and Technology - Sixth Report ''Science and Technology Committee Publications'']</ref>

===Delayed treatment===

Because homeopathic preparations are available either over-the-counter in some countries or from unlicensed practitioners in others, patients may be attempting to treat a seriously illness that requires immediate medical attention.  Because these preparations and remedies are named after the symptoms that are being treated, patients are misled into treating the symptoms rather than the underlying disease.  Moreover, the symptom could be relieved by the placebo response, but the underlying medical issue remains untreated.  With many disease, trauma or other medical states, delay in treatment will lead to severe health-care issues, including death.<ref name="Jonas">{{cite journal|author=Jonas, WB, Kaptchuk, TJ, & Linde, K|title=A critical overview of homeopathy|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=138|issue=5|pages=393-399|id=PMID 12614092}}</ref><ref name="Creighton">{{cite web|author=Faziola, L|date=2007|title=Dangers.  In:  Homeopathy Tutorial at Creighton University School of Medicine|url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/dangers.htm|publisher=[[Creighton University]] School of Medicine|accessdate=2007-07-14}}</ref>

For example, a 2006 survey by the UK charitable trust [[Sense About Science]] revealed homeopathic practices that were advising travelers against taking conventional anti-malarial drugs, instead providing them with a homeopathic dilution of [[quinine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/programmes/newsnight/5178122.stm|title=''Malaria advice 'risks lives' ''|author=Jones, M|publisher=BBC News|date=2006|accessdate=2007-07-14}}</ref>  Scientists and the [[Health Protection Agency]] have said the homeopaths' advice was reprehensible and likely to endanger lives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/story/0,,1820103,00.html|title=Homeopaths 'endangering lives' by offering malaria remedies|author=Jha, A|date=2006-07-14|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2007-07-14}}</ref>

===Wasted resources===

{{POV}}
Because of the expense of homeopathic treatments, and because most scientists and medical practitioners consider them placebos, the cost of the treatments plus consulting fees for the homeopathic practitioner is considered wasted money.  In locations where healthcare costs are high or where reimbursements for healthcare costs are tightly regulated, money spent on these treatments could be better utilized for conventional medicine.  However, in cases where the patient has a [[psychosomatic]] condition, the placebo effect of the homeopathic treatment may be beneficial to the psychological health of the patient.<ref name="Creighton"/>

===Nocebo effect===

In clinical drug investigations, placebos should produce no apparent benefit to the patient, so that a valid comparison can be made between the drug and the placebo.  Occasionally, a [[nocebo]] effect is observed with the placebo, in that it produces an apparent toxicity to the patient.  In the case of homeopathic remedies, there has not been any systematic study of adverse reactions to these drugs.  All homeopathic remedies should produce the same range of side effects as any other placebo.<ref name="Creighton"/>

===Vaccinations===
Hahnemann did not approve of vaccination and stated, <cite>"But to use a human morbific matter (a [[Psorin]] taken from the itch in man) as a remedy for the same itch or for evils arisen therefrom, stay away from it! Nothing can result from this but trouble and aggravation of the disease."</cite><ref name="organon-56">[http://www.homeopathyhome.com/reference/organon/19.html#56 Organon Of Medicine § 56], 6th. edition</ref> American homeopath Herbert Alfred Roberts pointed out that: <cite>"giving the identical instead of the similar means the difference between isopathy and homoeopathy."</cite><ref>H.A. Roberts: The Principles and Art of Cure by Homoeopathy, chapter 1</ref> However, Hahnemann believed that the success of the smallpox vaccine, made from the related but less severe disease [[cowpox]], was confirmation of the 'law of similars'.<ref name="organon-56"/>

Modern medicine strongly differs from the homeopathic beliefs regarding vaccines.  A vaccine is usually a preparation made from an attenuated [[bacterium]] or [[virus]] that cannot cause disease, while still providing enough information to the [[immune system]] to induce a response to a future encounter with the same virus or bacteria.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding Vaccines: what they are and how they work.  NIH Publication No. 03-4219|publisher=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|date=2003|url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/vaccine/pdf/undvacc.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-07-14}}</ref> By preparing the immune system of a healthy organism to meet a future attack by the pathogen, vaccination hopes to prevent disease, in contrast to homeopathy's hope, which is to prevent or cure it with dilutions. Another important difference is that vaccine contains measurable amounts of [[antigen]], usually [[proteins]] or [[carbohydrates]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Vliegenthart JF|title=Carbohydrate based vaccines|journal=FEBS Letters|date=2006|volume=580|issue=12|pages=2945-50|id=PMID 16630616}}</ref> from the disease-causing organism, whereas homeopathic remedies have been diluted to such an extent they are unlikely to contain any detectable active ingredients, because homeopathy rejects [[germ theory]].  Without antigen present in the vaccine, an immune response is not activated by the body, and it will not be protected from future encounters with the bacterial or viral pathogens.
