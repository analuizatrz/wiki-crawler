'''Canada''' ({{IPA-en|ˈkænədə}}) is a [[country]] occupying most of northern [[North America]], extending from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west and northward into the [[Arctic Ocean]].

The land occupied by Canada was inhabited for millennia by various [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples]]. Beginning in the late 15th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored and later settled the Atlantic coast. France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763 after the [[Seven Years' War]]. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[dominion]] of four provinces.<ref>{{cite web| title = Territorial evolution| work = Atlas of Canada | publisher = Natural Resources Canada | url =http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/anniversary_maps/terr_evol | format = html/pdf | accessdate = 2007-10-09| quote = In 1867, the colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are united in a federal state, the Dominion of Canada.... }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Canada: History| work = Country Profiles | publisher = Commonwealth Secretariat | url =http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/145152/history/ | format = html/pdf | accessdate = 2007-10-09| quote = The British North America Act of 1867 brought together four British colonies&nbsp;... in one federal Dominion under the name of Canada.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Hillmer| first = Norman | authorlink =| coauthors = W.

A [[federation]] comprising [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]], Canada is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]], with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]]. It is a [[Official bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] and [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] country, with both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Canadian French|French]] as official languages at the federal level. [[Developed country|Technologically advanced and industrialized]], Canada maintains a diversified economy that is heavily reliant upon its abundant natural resources and upon trade—particularly with the United States, with which Canada has had a [[Canada–United States relations|long and complex relationship]]. It is a member of the [[G8]], [[NATO]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and [[Francophonie|La Francophonie]].

[[Image:Cartier.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Jacques Cartier]]]]
The name ''Canada'' comes from a [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|St. Lawrence Iroquoian]] word, ''kanata'', meaning ''village'' or ''settlement''. In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day [[Quebec City]] region used the word to direct French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] towards the village of [[Stadacona]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Bruce G.| last=Trigger| coauthors=Pendergast, James F.| year=1978| chapter=Saint-Lawrence Iroquoians| title=Handbook of North American Indians Volume 15| location=Washington| publisher=Smithsonian Institution |pages=357–361 |id=OCLC 58762737}}</ref> Cartier later used the word ''Canada'' to refer not only to that particular village, but also the entire area subject to [[Donnacona]] (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this region as ''Canada''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12356/12356-h/12356-h.htm| title=Relation originale de Jacques Cartier| publisher=Tross (1863 edition)| author=Jacques Cartier| year=1545| accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>

From the early 17th century onwards, that part of [[New France]] that lay along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the northern shores of the [[Great Lakes]] was named ''Canada'', an area that was later split into two British colonies, [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]], until their re-unification as the [[Province of Canada]] in 1841. Upon [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, the name ''Canada'' was adopted as the legal name for the new country,<ref name="Martin">{{cite journal| last=Martin| first=Robert| title=1993 Eugene Forsey Memorial Lecture: A Lament for British North America| journal=The Machray Review| publisher=Prayer Book Society of Canada| year=1993| url=http://www.prayerbook.ca/library/machray/issue5/machray5d.htm| accessdate=2008-11-05| quote=Strictly speaking, the official name of the new country was, simply, "Canada", but usage sanctioned "Dominion of Canada.}}</ref> and ''[[Dominion]]'' was conferred as the country's title;<ref>{{cite book| first=J.

Thereafter, as Canada asserted its political autonomy from Britain, the federal government increasingly used simply ''Canada'' on state documents and treaties, a change that was reflected in the renaming of the national holiday from [[Dominion Day]] to [[Canada Day]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite web| title=Canada Day| publisher=Department of Canadian Heritage| accessdate=2008-11-06| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/jfa-ha/canada_e.cfm| quote=On October 27, 1982, July 1st which was known as "Dominion Day" became "Canada Day".}}</ref>

[[First Nations|First Nation]] and [[Inuit]] traditions maintain that indigenous people have resided on their lands since the [[Creation myth#North America|beginning of time]], while archaeological studies support a human presence in the northern [[Yukon]] from 26,500 years ago, and in southern [[Ontario]] from 9,500 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Cinq-Mars| first=J.| year=2001| title=On the significance of modified mammoth bones from eastern Beringia| journal=The World of Elephants - International Congress, Rome| url=http://www.cq.rm.cnr.it/elephants2001/pdf/424_428.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author=Wright, J.V| publisher=Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation| url=http://www.civilization.ca/archeo/hnpc/npvol04e.html| title=A History of the Native People of Canada: Early and Middle Archaic Complexes| date=27 September 2001| accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> [[European colonization of the Americas|Europeans first arrived]] when the [[Viking]]s settled briefly at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] around AD 1000; following the failure of that colony, there was no further attempt at North American exploration until 1497, when [[John Cabot]] explored Canada's Atlantic coast for [[England]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| title=John Cabot| encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9018457/John-Cabot}}</ref> followed by [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534 for [[France]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=World book Encyclopedia| title=Cartier, Jacques| accessdate=2007-09-01| publisher=World Book, Inc.| isbn=071660101X}}</ref> 

French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at [[Port Royal, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]] in 1605 and [[Quebec City]] in 1608. These would become respectively the capitals of [[Acadia]] and Canada. Among [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] of New France, ''Canadiens'' extensively settled the [[Saint Lawrence River]] valley, Acadians settled the present-day [[Maritimes]], while [[Coureur des bois|French fur traders]] and [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Catholic missionaries]] explored the Great Lakes, [[Hudson Bay]] and the [[Mississippi River#Watershed|Mississippi watershed]] to [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. The [[French and Iroquois Wars]] broke out over control of the [[fur trade]].

The English established fishing outposts in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] around 1610 and colonized the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to the south. A series of four [[French and Indian Wars|Intercolonial Wars]] erupted between 1689 and 1763. Mainland [[Nova Scotia]] came under British rule with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713); the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] ceded Canada and most of New France to [[British Empire|Britain]] following the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].

[[Image:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' on the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Plains of Abraham]] at [[Quebec City|Quebec]] in 1759, part of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].]]

The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Royal Proclamation (1763)]] carved the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] out of New France and annexed [[Cape Breton Island]] to Nova Scotia. It also restricted the language and religious rights of [[French Canadian]]s. In 1769, St. John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]) became a separate colony. To avert conflict in Quebec, the [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 expanded Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and [[Ohio River|Ohio Valley]] and re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law in Quebec; it angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, helping to fuel the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web | author= |publisher= |title= Wars on Our Soil, earliest times to 1885 |accessdate=2006-08-21 |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cwm/gallery1/revolution2_e.html}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] recognized American independence and ceded territories south of the Great Lakes to the United States.

To accommodate English-speaking Loyalists in [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Quebec]], the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]] divided the province into French-speaking [[Lower Canada]] and English-speaking [[Upper Canada]], granting each their own elected Legislative Assembly.

Canada (Upper and Lower) was the main front in the [[War of 1812]] between the United States and the British Empire. The defence of Canada contributed to a sense of unity among British North Americans. Large-scale immigration to Canada began in 1815 from Britain and [[Ireland]]. The [[logging|timber industry]] surpassed the fur trade in importance in the early nineteenth century.

The desire for [[responsible government]] resulted in the aborted [[Rebellions of 1837]]. [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|The Durham Report]] subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into British culture.<ref name="ce_durhamreport">{{cite web |author=David Mills |publisher= Historica Foundation of Canada |url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002473 |title=Durham Report |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> The [[Act of Union 1840]] merged [[The Canadas]] into a [[Province of Canada|United Province of Canada]].

The governor would also be obliged to ratify laws concerning the internal affairs of the colony once these laws had been passed to the Legislative Assembly.}}</ref>

The signing of the [[Oregon Treaty]] by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the [[Oregon boundary dispute]], extending the border westward along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] and paving the way for British colonies on [[Colony of Vancouver Island|Vancouver Island (1849)]] and in [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia (1858)]]. Canada launched a series of western exploratory expeditions to claim [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[Arctic]] region. The Canadian population grew rapidly because of high birth rates; British immigration was offset by emigration to the United States, especially by French Canadians moving to [[New England]].

[[Image:Canada provinces evolution.gif|thumb|right|An animated map, exhibiting [[Territorial evolution of Canada|the growth and change of Canada's provinces and territories since Confederation]]]]

Following several constitutional conferences, the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] brought about Confederation creating "one Dominion under the name of [[Name of Canada#Adoption of Dominion|Canada]]" on July 1, 1867, with four provinces: [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[New Brunswick]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Farthing |first= John |title= Freedom Wears a Crown |location= Toronto |publisher=Kingswood House |year=1957 |id = ASIN B0007JC4G2}}</ref> Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the [[North-Western Territory]] to form the [[Northwest Territories]], where [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis']] grievances ignited the [[Red River Rebellion]] and the creation of the province of [[Manitoba]] in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had [[United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia|united in 1866]]) and the colony of [[Prince Edward Island]] joined Confederation in 1871 and 1873, respectively.

[[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[John A. Macdonald|John A. Macdonald's]] [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] government established a [[national policy]] of [[tariff]]s to protect nascent Canadian manufacturing industries. To open the West, the government sponsored construction of three trans-continental railways (most notably the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]), opened the prairies to settlement with the [[Dominion Lands Act]], and established the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|North-West Mounted Police]] to assert its authority over this territory. In 1898, after the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the Northwest Territories, the Canadian government created the [[Yukon]] territory. Under [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Wilfrid Laurier]], continental European immigrants settled the prairies, and [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] became provinces in 1905.
[[Image:Canadian tank and soldiers Vimy 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian soldiers won the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in 1917.]]

Canada automatically entered [[World War I]] in 1914 with Britain's declaration of war, sending volunteers to the Western Front who later became part of the [[Canadian Corps]]. The Corps played a substantial role in the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] and other [[Canada's Hundred Days|major battles]] of the war. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] erupted when [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|conservative]] Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] brought in compulsory military service over the objection of French-speaking Quebecers. In 1919, Canada joined the [[League of Nations]] independently of Britain; in 1931 the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] affirmed Canada's independence.

The [[Great Depression]] brought economic hardship to all of Canada.

This growth, combined with the policies of successive [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] governments, led to the emergence of a new [[Canadian identity]], marked by the adoption of the current [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf Flag]] in 1965, the implementation of [[official bilingualism]] in 1969, and [[Multiculturalism#Origins in Canada|official multiculturalism]] in 1971. [[Social democracy|Socially democratic]] programmes were also founded, such as [[Medicare (Canada)|universal health care]], the [[Canada Pension Plan]], and [[Student loans in Canada|Canada Student Loans]], though provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.

==Government and politics==
{{main|Government of Canada|Politics of Canada|Monarchy of Canada}}
[[Image:Canada Parliament2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Parliament Hill]], [[Ottawa]]]]
Canada has a [[parliamentary government]] with  strong democratic traditions. [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] is made up of [[the Crown]], an elected [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] and an appointed [[Senate of Canada|Senate]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution Act, 1867; IV|publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html#legislative|quote=There shall be One Parliament for Canada, consisting of the Queen, an Upper House styled the Senate, and the House of Commons.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Parliament of Canada: About the Governor General of Canada|publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/pages/govgeneral.aspx?Language=E&Menu=GG|quote=Parliament is the legislative branch of Government, composed of the Sovereign (represented by the Governor General), the Senate and the House of Commons.}}

Each [[Member of Parliament]] in the House of Commons is elected by simple [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] in an [[Canadian electoral district|electoral district]] or riding. General elections  must be called by the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] within five years of the previous election, or may be triggered by the government losing a [[confidence vote]] in the House. Members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, are chosen by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], and serve until age 75. Four parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2008 elections:  the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] (governing party), the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] (Official Opposition), the [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP) and the ''[[Bloc Québécois]]''. The list of [[List of political parties in Canada#Historical parties that have won seats in Parliament|historical parties]] with elected representation is substantial.

[[Canadian federalism|Canada's federalist structure]] divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]].  [[Unicameralism|Unicameral]]  [[Legislative Assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories|provincial legislatures]]  operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the  House of Commons. Canada's three [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territories]] also have legislatures, but with fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces, and with some structural differences (for example, the [[Legislative Assembly of Nunavut]] has no parties and operates on consensus).

Canada's [[judiciary]] plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down laws that violate the Constitution. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is the highest court and final arbiter and is led by the Right Honourable Madam Chief Justice [[Beverley McLachlin]], P.C. since 2000. Its nine members are appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] on the advice of the Prime Minister and Minister of Justice. All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed after consultation with non-governmental legal bodies. The federal cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts at the provincial and territorial levels. Judicial posts at the lower provincial and territorial levels are filled by their respective governments.

[[Common law]] prevails everywhere except in Quebec, where [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] predominates. [[Criminal law in Canada|Criminal law]] is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada. Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is a provincial responsibility, but in rural areas of all provinces except Ontario and Quebec, policing is contracted to the federal [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].

[[Canada–United States relations|Canada and the United States]] share the world's longest undefended [[border]], co-operate on military campaigns and exercises, and are each other's largest trading partners. Canada has nevertheless maintained an independent foreign policy, most notably maintaining full relations with [[Cuba]] and declining to participate in the [[Iraq War]]. Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[Francophonie|La Francophonie]] (French-Speaking Countries). Canada is noted for having a strong and positive relationship with the [[Netherlands]] which Canada helped liberate during [[World War II]], and the Dutch government traditionally gives tulips, a symbol of the Netherlands, to Canada each year in remembrance of Canada's contribution to its liberation.

Strong attachment to the [[British Empire]] and Commonwealth in [[English Canada]] led to major participation in British military efforts in the [[Second Boer War]], the First World War, and the Second World War.

[[Central Canada]] consists of [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]. [[Atlantic Canada]] consists of the three [[Maritimes|Maritime provinces]] ([[New Brunswick]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]]), along with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. [[Eastern Canada]] refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together. Three territories ([[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut]]) make up [[Northern Canada]]. Provinces have [[Canadian federalism|more autonomy]] than territories. Each has its own [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial or territorial symbols]]<ref>{{cite web|author= |title= A Look at Canada |work= |publisher= Minister of Public Worksand Government Services Canada |year= 2007|accessdate=2008-11-05|url= http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/look/index.asp|isbn= 0-662-39464-X}}</ref>. 

The provinces are responsible for most of Canada's social programs (such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]) and together collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the [[Canada Health Act]]; the provinces can opt out of these but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.

In eastern Canada, most people live in large urban centres on the flat [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]]. The [[Saint Lawrence River]] widens into the world's largest [[estuary]] before flowing into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. The gulf is bounded by [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to the north and the [[Maritimes]] to the south. The Maritimes protrude eastward along the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian Mountain]] range from northern [[New England]] and the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] of Quebec. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are divided by the [[Bay of Fundy]], which experiences the world's largest tidal variations. Ontario and [[Hudson Bay]] dominate central Canada. West of Ontario, the broad, flat [[Canadian Prairies]] spread toward the [[Rocky Mountains]], which separate them from British Columbia.

In northwestern Canada, the [[Mackenzie River]] flows from the [[Great Slave Lake]] to the [[Arctic Ocean]]. A tributary of a tributary of the Mackenzie is the [[South Nahanni River]], which is home to [[Virginia Falls (Northwest Territories)|Virginia Falls]], a waterfall about twice as high as [[Niagara Falls]].

[[Northern Canada|Northern Canadian]] vegetation tapers from [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] forests to [[tundra]] and finally to Arctic barrens in the far north. The northern Canadian mainland is ringed with a vast [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|archipelago]] containing some of the [[List of islands by area|world's largest islands]].

Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary depending on the location. Winters can be harsh in many regions of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces which experience a [[continental climate]], where daily average temperatures are near −15&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] (5&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) but can drop below −40&nbsp;°C (−40&nbsp;°F) with severe wind chills.<ref name="twn_regina">{{cite web |author=The Weather Network |authorlink=The Weather Network |publisher=The Weather Network |url=http://www.theweathernetwork.ca/weather/stats/pages/C02072.htm?CASK0261 |title=Statistics, Regina SK |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground almost six months of the year (more in the north).

==Language==
{{main|Spoken languages of Canada|Official bilingualism in Canada|Canadian English|Canadian French}}
[[Image:Ville de Québec01.jpg|thumb|right|The population of [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]] is mainly [[French Canadian|French-speaking]].]]

Canada's two official languages are [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. [[Official bilingualism in Canada]] is law, defined in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]], and ''Official Language Regulations''; it is applied by the [[Commissioner of Official Languages]]. English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. The public has the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French, and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Legislation on Official Languages|publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|date=2003-09-01|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/legislation.asp?Lang=English}}</ref>

English and French are the [[first language|mother tongues]] of 59.7% and 23.2% of the population respectively,<ref name="statscan_language">{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo11a.htm |title=Population by mother tongue, by province and territory|date=2005-01-27|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> and the languages most spoken at home by 68.3% and 22.3% of the population respectively.<ref name="home_language_2001">{{cite web| url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&PID=55535&APATH=3&GID=431515&METH=1&PTYPE=55440&THEME=41&FOCUS=0&AID=0&PLACENAME=0&PROVINCE=0&SEARCH=0&GC=0&GK=0&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&FL=0&RL=0&FREE=0|title= First Official Language Spoken (7) and Sex (3) for Population, for Canada, Provinces, Territories and Census Metropolitan Areas 1 , 2001 Census&nbsp;– 20% Sample Data| work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population| accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> 98.5% of Canadians speak English or French (67.5% speak English only, 13.3% speak French only, and 17.7% speak both).<ref name="statscan_language2">{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo15a.htm |title=Population by knowledge of official language, by province and territory|date=2005-01-27|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> English and French Official Language Communities, defined by First Official Language Spoken, constitute 73.0% and 23.6% of the population respectively.<ref>{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&PID=55673&APATH=3&GID=517770&METH=1&PTYPE=55496&THEME=41&FOCUS=0&AID=0&PLACENAME=0&PROVINCE=0&SEARCH=0&GC=99&GK=NA&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&FL=0&RL=0&FREE=0|title=Population by knowledge of official language, by province and territory|date=2005-01-27|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref>

Although 85% of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in [[Franco-Ontarian|Ontario]], [[Franco-Albertan|Alberta]] and southern [[Franco-Manitoban|Manitoba]], with an [[Acadians|Acadian]] population in the northern and southeastern parts of New Brunswick constituting 35% of that province's population, as well as concentrations in southwestern Nova Scotia, on [[Cape Breton Island]], and through central and western [[Prince Edward Island]]. Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec. The [[Charter of the French Language]] in Quebec makes French the official language in Quebec, and New Brunswick is the only province to have a statement of official bilingualism in its constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Heritage|publisher=Canadian Heritage|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/lo-ol/pubs/mythes/english/abc.html}}</ref> Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures, and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status but is not fully co-official. Several aboriginal languages have official status in Northwest Territories. [[Inuktitut]] is the majority language in Nunavut, and one of three official languages in the territory.

Non-official languages are important in Canada, with over five million people listing one as a first language.<ref name="statscan_language" /> Some significant non-official first languages include [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (853,745 first-language speakers), [[Italian language|Italian]] (469,485), [[German language|German]] (438,080), and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (271,220).<ref> name="statscan_language" </ref>
