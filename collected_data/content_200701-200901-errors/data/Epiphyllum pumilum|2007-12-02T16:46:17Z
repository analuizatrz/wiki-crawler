'''''Epiphyllum pumilum''''' is a [[cactus]] [[species]] native to [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]]. The species is commonly grown as an ornamental for its beautiful, fragrant flowers in the summer.

==Ethymology==
This specific epithet refers to the relatively small flowers of this species. History [[F. Eichlam]] found this cacti in Guatemala and sent a living specimen to the U. S. which flowered in Washington on October 3, 1912. It had previously been collected at several occasions but passed as ''[[Epiphyllum pittieri|E. pittieri]]''. Unaware of its variable nature, Britton and Rose described the same species again in the same paper, under the name ''E. caudatum''. This time from a specimen collected in Oaxaca, Mexico collected by   [[E. W. Nelson]] in 1894. Later the same year, Vaupel transferred the two taxa to ''Phyllocactus'', an invalid name used in Europe by that time. 

==Origin and habitat ==
Mexico (Vera Cruz, Tabasco, Oaxaca, Chiapas) to the lowlands of Guatemala. 

==Systematics==
This species is closely related to ''[[Epiphyllum oxypetalum]]'' and differs mainly in its smaller flowers. 

==Cultivation==
Easily cultivated and fast growing. Needs a compost containing plenty of humus and plenty of moisture in summer. Will not tolerate low winter temperatures, around 12°C (53,5°F) will be more suitable. Best grown in semi-shade. Usually flowers in summer or in the early autumn.
