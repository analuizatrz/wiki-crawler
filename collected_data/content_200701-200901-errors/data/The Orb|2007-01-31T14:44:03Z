'''The Orb''' are an [[England|English]] [[electronic music]] group known for popularising [[chill out music]] in the 1990s and spawning the genre of [[ambient house]].  Founded in 1988 by [[Alex Paterson]] and [[The KLF|KLF]] member [[Jimmy Cauty]], The Orb began as [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[dub music|dub]] [[disc jockey|DJ]]s in [[London]].<ref name="irish-boyd">{{cite news|work=[[The Irish Times]] |last=Boyd |first=Brian |date=[[1998-10-23]] |page=12 |title=Unidentified Flying Orb}}</ref>  Their early performances were inspired by ambient producers, most notably [[Brian Eno]], and German artists such as [[Kraftwerk]].  Because of their "trippy" sound, they developed a cult following among [[clubber]]s "coming down" from drug-induced highs.<ref name="guardian-chills">{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Hodgkinson |first=Will |date=[[2003-01-31]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,885369,00.html |title=Chills and thrills}}</ref>  Despite many personnel changes, Alex Paterson has maintained The Orb's science fiction themes and visually-intensive live performances.<ref name="independent-earth">{{cite news|last=Prendergast |first=Mark |work=[[The Independent]] |date=[[1995-03-17]] |page=34 |title=Earth Calling Orb, Come In}}</ref>  Their frequent use of unlicensed [[Sampling (music)|samples]] has been a source of contention and legal disputes with other record labels and artists.

The Orb achieved most of their commercial success in the early and mid-1990s.  They produced four [[UK Singles Chart|UK top ten singles]], including "[[Blue Room (The Orb)|Blue Room]]", "[[Little Fluffy Clouds]]", ''[[Pomme Fritz]]'', and "[[Toxygene]]", which peaked at #4.  Albums by The Orb have appeared on the [[UK Albums Chart]], including ''[[U.F.Orb]]'', which reached number one in the U.K. in 1992.  Also contributing to their popularity is the high number of tracks they have remixed for high-profile artists such as [[Depeche Mode]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], and [[Mika Nakashima]] as well as appearances on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and at [[Woodstock '94]].<ref name="amg-bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:r69gs35ba3rg~T1 |title=The Orb Biography |accessdate=2006-10-09 |last = Bush |first = John |publisher = [[All Music Guide]]}}</ref>  Their releases of the early 2000s met with limited critical support before shifting to a minimalist sound, spearheaded by Orb member [[Thomas Fehlmann]].<ref name="amg-okie">{{cite-web|last=Kellman |first=Andy|title= Okie Dokie It's the Orb on Kompakt Review |publisher= [[All Music Guide]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:76bsa9lgr23s |accessdate=2006-10-10}}</ref>

[[Image:KissEPBio.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Notes from the reverse of The Orb's first release, the ''[[Kiss EP]]'', proclaiming "Cross-over potential: nil".]]

In the early 1980s, [[Alex Paterson]] began his music career as a roadie for the [[post-punk]] [[rock music|rock]] band [[Killing Joke]], for whom his childhood friend [[Martin Glover|Martin "Youth" Glover]] played bass.<ref name="scotsman">{{cite news|work=[[The Scotsman]] |last=Smith |first=Aidan |date=[[2001-02-16]] |title=A master of the ballistic |page=10}}</ref>  After touring for several years with the band, Paterson joined [[EG Records]]' [[A&R]] department in the late '80s.  While there, he met [[The KLF|KLF]] member [[Jimmy Cauty]]<ref name="century">{{cite book|last=Prendergast |first=Mark |title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Moby-The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing PLC]] |year=2003 |id= ISBN 1-58234-323-3 |pages = pp. 407-412}}</ref> and the duo began working together under the name ''The Orb''.  Cauty, too, had a Killing Joke connection<!--''is this how they knew each other? Unknown-->, having been a member of [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]] with Glover.  Paterson and Cauty's first release was a 1988 [[acid house]] anthem track, "Tripping on Sunshine" released on the German record compilation ''[[Eternity Project One]]''.<ref name="rough">{{cite book|last=Shapiro |first=Peter |title =The Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass| authorlink=Peter Shapiro |year=1999 |id=ISBN 1-85828-433-3 |publisher= [[Rough Guides]] |pages=pp. 327-329}}</ref>  The following year, The Orb released the ''[[Kiss EP]]'', a four-track [[EP]] based on samples from [[New York City]]'s [[KISS FM]].<ref name="rough"/>  It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label [[WAU/Mr. Modo Records]], which Paterson and Glover created out of a desire to maintain financial independence from larger record labels.<ref name="century"/>  After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as "really shit drum sounds", the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by "taking the bloody drums away".<ref name="keyboard">{{cite news|last=Doerschuck |first=Robert |work = [[Keyboard Magazine]] |month=June |year=1995 |title=Inside the Ambient Techno Ultraworld}}</ref>  Paterson and Cauty began DJ-ing in London and landed a deal for The Orb to play the [[Chill out music|chill out]] room at London nightclub [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]].  Resident DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]] brought in the duo specifically as ambient DJs for his "The Land of Oz" event at Heaven.<ref name="irish-boyd"/>  Though initially The Orb's Monday night performances had only several "hard-core" followers, their "Chill Out Room" act grew popular over the course of their six month stay at Heaven to the point that the small room was often packed with around 100&nbsp;people.<ref name="ocean">{{cite book|last = Toop|first = David|authorlink = David Toop|title=Ocean of Sound|publisher=Serpent's Tail|pages=pp. 59-62|year=2001|id = ISBN 1-85242-743-4}}</ref>  The Orb's performances became especially popular among weary DJs and clubbers who sought solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  The Orb would build up melodies using [[multitrack recording]]s linked to multiple [[record deck]]s and a [[mixing console|mixer]].  They incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop|BBC sound effects]] into their act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as "[[Sue√±o Latino]]".<ref name="ocean"/>  Though they used a variety of samples, they avoided heavy rhythm and drums so as not to disrupt their intended ambient atmosphere.  Most often, they played [[dub reggae]] and other [[chill out music]] which they described as "Ambient house for the E generation",<ref name="rough"/> a phrase printed on the back of the "A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain..." 12" single.<ref name="metropolis">{{cite web|last = Crispy |first = Don |url= http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/590/clubs.asp |title = Alex Paterson |publisher = ''[[Metropolis (Japanese magazine)|Metropolis]]'' |accessdate = 2007-01-14 |year = }}</ref>

Throughout 1989, The Orb, along with Glover, developed the musical genre of [[ambient house]] through the use of a diverse array of [[sampling (music)|samples]] and recordings.  The culmination of their musical work came towards the end of the year when The Orb recorded a session for [[John Peel]] on [[BBC Radio 1]].  The track, then known as "Loving You", was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from [[science fiction]] radio plays, nature sounds, and [[Minnie Riperton]]'s "Lovin' You".<ref name="amg-peel">{{cite web|work=[[All Music Guide]] |last=Thompson |first=Dave |accessdate=2006-11-06 |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:rh90s34ba39g |title=Peel Sessions Review}}</ref>  For its release as a single on record label [[Big Life]], The Orb changed the title to "[[A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From the Centre of the Ultraworld]]".  Upon the single's release, Riperton's management forced Big Life to remove the unlicensed Riperton sample, ensuring that only the initial first-week release of the single contained the original vocals of Minnie Riperton; subsequent pressings used vocals from a sound-alike.<ref name="irish-boyd"/>  Despite its running time of 22 minutes, the sample-laden single reached #78 on the [[UK singles chart]].  Impressed by their remix work, [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] asked The Orb to remix his top 20 single "[[Lily Was Here]]".  The Orb obliged and was soon offered several more remix jobs from artists including [[Erasure]] and [[System 7 (band)|System 7]].  

In 1990, Paterson and Cauty held several recording sessions at Cauty's studio, [[Trancentral]].  Out of these sessions came The KLF album ''[[Chill Out (album)|Chill Out]]'', on which Paterson appeared in an uncredited role.<ref name="generation">{{cite book|last = Reynolds |first = Simon |year = 1999 |id = ISBN 0-415-92373-5 |publisher = Routledge |title = Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture |pages=p. 191}}</ref>  The ''[[The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Dictionary]]'' suggests ''Chill Out'' is the first ambient house album.<ref name="grove">{{GroveOnline|Ambient house|Fulford-Jones, Will|4 October|2006}}</ref>  When offered an album deal by Big Life, The Orb found themselves at a crossroads.  Cauty preferred that albums by The Orb were released on his [[KLF Communications]] label, whereas Paterson wanted to avoid becoming an offshoot of The KLF.<ref name="times-waves">{{cite news |title=Don't make negative waves |last=Toop |first=David |authorlink=David Toop |date=[[1994-06-03]] |work=[[The Times]]}}</ref>  Due to these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name ''The Orb''.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  As a result of the break-up, Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the recordings in progress and released the album as ''[[Space (album)|Space]]'' on [[KLF Communications]].<ref name="klfcomm">{{cite press release | title =KLF Communications Info Sheet Nine | publisher = [[KLF Communications]]| date = 1990| url =http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=509 | accessdate =2006-10-09}}</ref>  As a result of the break-up, Paterson began work with Glover and started production of the track "[[Little Fluffy Clouds]]".  "Little Fluffy Clouds" featured samples from [[Steve Reich]]'s ''[[Electric Counterpoint]]'' as well as vocal clips from an interview with [[Rickie Lee Jones]] in which she recalls picturesque images of her childhood.<ref name="slant">{{cite web|last = Cinquemani |first = Sal |url= http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=238 |title = Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld Review |publisher = ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' |accessdate = 2006-10-09 |year = 2002}}</ref>  While Reich was "genuinely flattered"<ref name="wire-96">{{cite news|title=Steve Reich |work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] |date=1996-11-01}}</ref> by The Orb's use of his work and instructed his record company not to sue,<ref name="reich-bn">{{cite web|title=Classical Composer Steve Reich Gets Remixed and Loves It|url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/features/interview.asp?z=y&NID=113694 |publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]] |author=Martin Johnson |accessdate=2006-10-11}}</ref> Jones pursued the issue in the legal system.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  Big Life chose to [[settlement (law)|settle]] out of court for an undisclosed sum of money for use of her voice on The Orb's recording.  "Little Fluffy Clouds" reached #87 on the UK singles chart and was a dancefloor success.  However, due to Glover's other production obligations, he did not become a permanent member of The Orb.

In 1991, Paterson invited studio engineer [[Kris Weston|Kris "Thrash" Weston]] to join him in live performances as The Orb.  After several successful performances, [[Steve Hillage]], who Patterson had met while DJ-ing in London, joined as a contributing guitarist.  Along with producer [[Thomas Fehlmann]] and audio engineer Andy Falconer, The Orb completed several additional tracks for their first album, ''[[The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld]]''.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  At least six studios and twenty outside musicians were used over the course of three weeks of recording.<ref name="century"/>  Weston's technical abilities and Hillages's guitar work allowed The Orb to craft panoramic sounds portraying aspects of space travel, especially the launch of ''[[Apollo 11]]''.<ref name="century"/>  ''Adventures'' sold well in the UK and received praise for its balance of ambient music, house music, and sampling.<ref name="amg-adventures">{{cite web|publisher = [[All Music Guide]] |last = Bush |first = John |title = The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld Review |url = http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:4h9sa93gb23k |accessdate = 2006-10-09}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Adventures'' is considered ground-breaking for the genres of ambient and dance music as well as changing the way musicians view sampling.<ref name="sunday-adventures">{{cite news|title=Crucial Cuts |work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] |last=Sandall |first=Robert |date=[[2001-10-21]] |page=22 }}</ref>  Several months after the UK release, ''Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld'' was edited down to a single disc version for a United States release, much to the chagrin of Paterson.<ref name="shih">{{cite web|title=Interview |last=Shih |first=Howard |work=Perfect Sound Forever |url=http://www.furious.com/Perfect/orb.html|accessdate=2006-10-11}}</ref>  To accompany the US release, The Orb kicked off their first United States tour with an appearance at [[Phoenix, Arizona]]'s Silver Dollar Club.<ref name="phoenix">{{cite news|work=[[Phoenix New Times]] |date=[[1997-04-30]] |title=Eye of the Orb |last=Holthouse |first=David}}</ref>

[[Image:Live93.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The Orb often used bizarre imagery, such as for their live album ''[[Live 93]]'', the cover of which parodied Pink Floyd's ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]'' album cover.]]

In late 1991 and early 1992, The Orb (still consisting of Paterson and Weston) wrote their next single, "[[Blue Room (single)|Blue Room]]".  Assisting with the recording was bassist [[Jah Wobble]], keyboardist [[Miquette Giraudy]], and guitarist Hillage.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  Despite its playing time of almost 40&nbsp;minutes, "Blue Room" entered at #12 and peaked at #8 on the UK singles chart, making it the longest track to reach the UK singles chart.  The Orb promoted this single with a "legendary avant-garde"<ref name="stylus">{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/brian-eno-and-the-ambient-series.htm |title=Brian Eno and the Ambient Series |last=Weiner |first=Matthew |date=[[2004-09-27]]}}</ref> performance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' where Patterson and Weston played a game of [[chess]] in space suits while footage of dolphins and an edited version of "Blue Room" ran in the background.<ref name="guardian-breakdown">{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]] |last=Sullivan |first=Caroline |date=[[1993-04-09]] |title=Breakdown}}</ref><ref name="irish-boyd"/>  In July of 1992, ''[[U.F.Orb]]'' was released featuring "Blue Room" and, in the US release, The Orb's next single, "[[Assassin (single)|Assassin]]".  Weston integrated his technical and creative expertise with Paterson's [[Brian Eno|Eno]]-influenced ambience on ''U.F.Orb'', creating "drum and bass rhythms" with "velvet keyboards" and "rippling synth lines".<ref name="century"/>  ''U.F.Orb'' reached #1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] to the shock of critics, who were surprised that fans had embraced what journalists considered to be [[progressive rock]].<ref name="guardian-breakdown"/>  Heavily influenced by The Orb and ''U.F.Orb'' in particular, many [[trip-hop]] groups sprang up emulating The Orb's "chill-out blueprint".<ref name="rough"/>  Despite The Orb's success, Paterson and Weston preferred to stay away from publicity and instead let their music be the focus of attention.<ref name="independent-pomme">{{cite news|last=Gallivan |first=Joseph |date=[[1994-06-10]] |work=[[The Independent]] |title=POP}}</ref>

Over the next year and a half, Paterson and Weston continued to produce new material, but releases stalled when Paterson began to feel that Big Life was trying to "dictate the direction his band should take".<ref name="times-waves"/>  This led to intense disagreements with Big Life and The Orb soon left the label and signed a deal with [[Island Records]].<ref name="citypaper">{{cite web|title=Q and A: Alex Paterson |last=O'Neal |first=Sean |date=[[2001-04-19]] |url=http://www.citypaper.net/articles/041901/music.qa.shtml |work=Philadelphia City Paper}}</ref>  Their first release on Island Records was the live album ''[[Live 93]]'', which gathered highlights from The Orb's recent performances in Europe and Asia.  It featured The Orb's live performance crew of Paterson, Weston, producers Nick Burton and [[Simon Phillips (producer)|Simon Phillips]], as well as audio engineer [[Andy Hughes]], who had stepped in previously when Weston had decided to stop touring.<ref name="keyboard"/>  The Orb's first studio production on Island Records was ''[[Pomme Fritz]]'', a chaotic EP which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described as an "aural feast" despite its "lack of cohesion" and direction.<ref name="rs-pomme">{{cite web|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |date=[[1994-10-20]] |title=The Orb: Pomme Fritz |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theorb/albums/album/173711/review/5946554/pomme_fritz}}</ref>  Though ''Pomme Fritz'' reached as high as #6 on the UK charts, UK critics panned it as "doodling" and noted its absence of focus.<ref name="century"/>  Even Island Records "hated it" and "didn't understand it at all", according to Paterson.<ref name="citypaper"/>  Kris Weston's role was much diminished on ''Pomme Fritz'' and is credited only as an engineer.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  Soon after production finished on ''Pomme Fritz'', Paterson, Weston, and The Orb contributor Thomas Fehlmann joined with [[Robert Fripp]] to form [[FFWD]] as a side project.  FFWD released a single self-titled album on Paterson's [[Inter-Modo]] label.  Fehlmann later described the project as "an Orb track which became so long that it became a whole album!".<ref name="century"/>  Due to this, the project lacked direction and disbanded after a single release.  Soon after the release of ''FFWD'' in August 1994, Weston suddenly quit The Orb to pursue his own projects.  Paterson claimed that Weston's desparture was due to Weston's desire to have an expanded creative role in The Orb, in addition his engineering work.<ref name="keyboard"/>  However, in an interview with ''[[i-D]]'', Weston attributed the split to Paterson, saying that Paterson "didn't do his 50 per cent of the work. He couldn't play anything."<ref name="guardian-simpson">{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]] |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=[[2001-01-19]] |page=6 |title=The Friday Interview}}</ref>  Though The Orb was left only as Paterson, Fehlmann, and Hughes, Paterson reaffirmed the status of The Orb saying, "The Orb is The Orb, and nothing can change that".<ref name="independent-earth"/>

Following Weston's departure from The Orb, Thomas Fehlmann joined as a full-time studio member, though he did not always participate in The Orb's live performances.  Paterson, Hughes, and Fehlmann finished producing the 1995 album ''[[Orbus Terrarum]]'', which Paterson and Weston had been working on up until Weston's desparture.  Unlike previous albums by The Orb, ''Orbus Terrarum'' featured more "earthbound" and "organic" sounds instead of the trippy science fiction themed music they had previously written.<ref name="keyboard"/><ref name="independent-terra">{{cite news|last=Gill |first=Andy |title=Oh, the Pity and Terra of It All |work=[[The Independent]] |date=[[1995-03-31]] |page=31}}</ref>  ''Orbus Terrarum'' suffered, as Paterson described it, "a good kicking" at the hands of the British press,<ref name="future-98">{{cite news|work=Future N Music |title=Alex Paterson Interview |date=1998-10}}</ref> who described it as "generic ambient music" <ref name="times-orbus">{{cite news|work=[[The Times]] |last=Sinclair |first=David |title=Pop on Friday|date=[[1995-03-24]] |page=1}}</ref> and stated that it was a low point for Paterson's creativity.<ref name="guardian-simpson"/>  ''Orbus Terrarum'' further alienated many of the group's fans as they had with ''Pomme Fritz'',<ref name="rs-orblivion">{{cite web|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |title=The Orb: Orblivion |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theorb/albums/album/145147/review/5940398/orblivion |date=[[1997-03-19]]}}</ref>, causing the album to only reach #20 on the UK charts.<ref name="everyhit">{{cite web|work=Everyhit.com |title=The Orb |url=http://www.everyhit.com |accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref>  American critics, however, gave it great acclaim, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' who made it their album of the month, citing the album's symphonic flow coupled with The Orb's "uniquely British wit".<ref name="rs-orbus">{{cite web|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |date=[[1998-02-02]] |title=The Orb: Orbus Terrarum |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theorb/albums/album/98991/review/5945472/orbus_terrarum}}</ref>  Following ''Orbus Terrarum'' was the 1996 [[Strange Fruit Records]] release of a compilation of four Orb tracks recorded with John Peel in 1992 and 1995.  The first track was a reworked version of ''U.F.Orb'''s "O.O.B.E", which Paterson cites as his favorite ambient work of The Orb.<ref name="independent-top10">{{cite news|work=[[The Independent]] |last=Paterson |first=Alex |page=16 |date=[[2004-05-07]] |title=The Ten Best Ambient Works}}</ref>  Soon thereafter, ''[[Auntie Aubrey's Excursions Beyond the Call of Duty]]'', a compilation album of The Orb's previous remix work, was released on [[Deviant Records]].  After a long world tour, The Orb settled down to produce their next album, ''[[Orblivion]]''.  With Andy Hughes and Steve Hillage, The Orb returned to their spacy sounds typical of ''U.F.Orb''.  Though ''Orblivion'' was recorded in May 1996, it was not released until almost a year later, due to Island Records' desire to promote it as a follow up to [[U2]]'s [[techno music|techno]]-[[rock music|rock]] album ''[[Pop (album)|Pop]]''.<ref name="shih"/>  ''Orblivion'' sold very well in Europe as well as the United States, where it reached the [[Billboard Top 200]].  The first ''Orblivion'' single, "[[Toxygene]]", was the highest charting single by The Orb, reaching #4 in the UK on [[8 February]] [[1997]].  Despite high sales, ''Orblivion'' received a lukewarm reception from UK critics.<ref name="remixmag-orblivion">{{cite web|work=[[Remix Magazine]] |last=Silva |first=Joe |date=[[2001-02-01]] |title=Living in Orblivion |url=http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_living_orblivion/}}</ref> Similarly to the case of ''Orbus Terrarum'', ''Orblivion'' received better praise from American critics, including ''Rolling Stone'' who called it a "scintillating contrast of chaos and euphony".<ref name="rs-orblivion"/>  To support the album, The Orb embarked on the ''Organic Tour'' with [[Orbital]], [[Meat Beat Manifesto]], [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]], [[Zion Train]], and [[The Chemical Brothers]].  The ''[[The Village Voice]]'' described The Orb as "on its way down" and the stresses of touring sat heavily on Paterson, but The Orb decided not to "pack it in" and instead continued touring and producing.<ref name="option-97">{{cite news|title=Minimal Impact |last=Berkowitz |first=Kenny |work=Option |year=1997 |month=Nov/Dec}}</ref>  After releasing the second ''Orblivion'' single, "[[Asylum (single)|Asylum]]", Island Records released a 1998 [[greatest hits]] compilation by The Orb entitled ''[[U.F.Off]]'', which featured a CD of The Orb's singles with a "limited edition" second CD of remixes.  

Paterson and Fehlmann, along with usual collaborators Hughes, Burton, and Phillips, wrote and produced ''[[Cydonia (album)|Cydonia]]'' for a planned 1999 release.<ref name="amg-bio"/>  Featured on the album were appearances from Robert Fripp, [[John Roome]], and Fil Le Gonidec, who had previously only worked with The Orb live.

The Orb found success on Kompakt, however, Badorb.com, collapsed soon after releasing the compilation ''Bless You''.  Badorb.com had released fourteen records over the course of fourteen months from artists including [[Guy Pratt|Conduit]], [[Ayumi Hamasaki]], and [[Takayuki Shiraishi]], as well as the three-track ''[[Daleth of Elphame EP]]'' by The Orb.  Paterson credited the label's lack of success due to the "snobbery of vinyl" and that the label should have instead sold [[MP3]]s or other downloadable content.<ref name="guardian-interview"/>  In between producing original material, Paterson compiled a [[DJ mix|mix]] for the ''[[Back to Mine]]'' series, for which he was credited as The Orb.

As with many artists whose early work is considered most important, The Orb began to suffer from "commercial neglect and critical irrelevancy".<ref name="popmatters-bikes">{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]] |title=Bicycles & Tricycles Review |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/o/orb-bicycles.shtml |last=O'Neil |first=Tim |date=[[2004-07-29]]}}</ref>  Though their musical style had changed since the 1990s, The Orb continued their use of hypnotic repetition and odd synthetic sounds with ''[[Bicycles & Tricycles]]''.

After departing from Island Records, The Orb released ''Bicycles & Tricycles'' in 2004 on [[Cooking Vinyl]] in the United Kingdom and [[Sanctuary Records]] in the United States.  To promote the album, The Orb began a UK tour with dub reggae artist [[Mad Professor]], who had remixed The Orb in the past.

Paterson and Fehlmann are currently on tour playing to smaller venues as ''Le Petit Orb''.

==Themes and influences==
===Inspiration===
Throughout The Orb's existence, they have drawn from a multitude of influences.<ref name="ps-aubrey"/>  The Orb's central figure, Alex Paterson, had early musical tastes and influences which included [[King Tubby]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Kraftwerk]], and [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]].<ref name="ra-interview">{{cite web|title=Dr Alex Paterson - music as medicine| url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature_view.asp?id=444 |last = Jarvis |first=Matt |coauthor=Helen Hayden |publisher=[[Resident Advisor]] |date=[[2004-03-30]]}}</ref>  Among these, Paterson cites Kraftwerk as one of the most important, claiming they created the foundation from which all modern dance music has been built.<ref name="guardian-chills"/>  While in [[Brixton]] with Martin Glover as a teenager, Paterson was also exposed to a large amount of reggae music, such as [[The Mighty Diamonds]], [[The Abyssinians]], and [[Bob Marley]].<ref name="guardian-chills"/>  The reggae influence on Paterson and The Orb can readily be heard in tracks such as the single "Perpetual Dawn" and ''U.F.Orb'''s "Towers of Dub".  The earliest ambient influences of The Orb came in 1979 during Paterson's roadie days with Killing Joke.  While with Killing Joke in [[Neuss]], Paterson listened to Brian Eno's ''[[Music for Films]]'' while on [[LSD]] and watched "the [[Ruhr]] steel works explode in the distance", noting that "[t]he scene seemed to be taking place in the music as well".<ref name="century"/>  That same night, Paterson was also inspired while listening to [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]]'s ''[[Grosses Wasser]]'' and found that the steel works' "huge metal arms were crushing molten rocks in time to the music", which was something he'd "never seen, or heard, anything like it before".<ref name="guardian-chills"/>  Along with Cluster and Kraftwerk, Paterson was also influenced by other German experimental music from [[Can (band)|Can]] and composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].<ref name="keyboard"/>  Among all of his ambient influences, Paterson cites Eno's [[The Pearl (album)|The Pearl]] and "An Ending" from ''[[Music For Films, Volume 2]]'' as his favorite ambient works.<ref name="independent-top10"/> In fact, ''[[Modulations]]'' calls Paterson's music a "maximal" version of Eno's "minimal" ambient;<ref name="modulations">{{cite book|last= |first= |editor=[[Peter Shapiro|Shapiro, Peter]] (ed.) |title=[[Modulations|Modulations - A History of Electronic Music: Throbbing Words on Sound]] |publisher=Caipirinha Productions |year=2000 |id= ISBN 1-891024-06-X |pages = pp. 160-162}}</ref> however, according to Paterson, Eno resents Paterson's use of his music as an influence.<ref name="metropolis" />

Though The Orb has often been described as "The Pink Floyd of the Nineties",<ref name=guardian-spencer>{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=[[1994-06-05]] |last=Spencer |first=Neil |title=Neil Spencer meets their inspirational founder, Alex Paterson}}</ref> Paterson often states that his music is not influenced by Pink Floyd nor does he even like the music of Pink Floyd.<ref name="higherfrequency"/>  Paterson says that he has always been influenced by experimental electronic music more so than progressive rock of the 1970s.<ref name="guardian-chills"/>  Frequent Orb contributor Guy Pratt, however, did bring a Pink Floyd influence to the tracks he performed on, as he had been Pink Floyd's touring bassist for ten years.<ref name="citypaper"/>  The Orb's work has also been compared to the music of [[Gong (band)|Gong]], though Paterson has attested that he never heard an album by Gong before meeting Gong member Steve Hillage in 1990.<ref name="times-hippie">{{cite news|work=[[The Times]] |last=Sandall |first=Robert |date=[[1992-07-12]] |title=Hippie dippie draw}}</ref>  Critics have described The Orb as [[hippie]] revivalists;<ref name="birmingham-adventures">{{cite news|work=[[Birmingham Post]] |last=Cowen |first=Andrew |date=[[2001-02-10]] |title=CD Reviews |page=4}}</ref> however, Paterson has strongly denied this, stating that he "used to be one of those punks who hated hippies".<ref name="times-hippie"/>  

During production of ''Cydonia'' and ''Bicycles & Tricycles'', Paterson's biggest influences were [[drum and bass]] and [[trip hop]] music.<ref name="birmingham-guru">{{cite news|title=Ambient gurus refuse to lie down |work=[[Birmingham Post]] |date=[[1998-10-21]] |page=15 |last=Cowen |first=Andrew}}</ref>  This can readily be seen in the tracks "Ghostdancing", "Thursday's Keeper", and "Aftermath".  The Orb's more recent influences consist largely of German techno producers, who themselves have drawn from The Orb's earlier work for inspiration.<ref name="amg-okie"/>  Paterson cites mainly material published on the Kompakt label and suggests that it is among the best modern ambient music.<ref name="independent-top10"/>

===Drug use===
As chill out DJs in the late 1980s, The Orb often played to the needs of "the chemical generation", making music "to come down from drugs to".<ref name="guardian-chills"/>  Paterson described The Orb's original intent as "basically about taking lots of drugs and going clubbing."<ref name="keyboard"/>  Similarly, one of The Orb's early taglines was "Ambient house for the E generation".<ref name="rough"/>  Often during interviews, Alex Paterson will smoke several [[spliff]]s.<ref name="ocean"/>  This includes a 2003 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', where interviewer Will Hodgkinson noted the assorted "[[hashish|hash]]-smoking paraphernalia" around Paterson's [[Battersea]] apartment.<ref name="guardian-chills"/>  Drug references often turn up in tracks as well.  For example, "72" from ''Orblivion'' features a clip from [[Hair (musical)|Hair]] proclaiming "the youth of America on [[LSD]]!".  A particularly notable case was on "Little Fluffy Clouds", where critics and fans sometimes attribute the odd nasal tonality of Rickie Lee Jones' voice to drug use, though Jones later claimed that it was the result of a heavy cold.<ref name="cdtimes">{{cite web|work=CD Times |url=http://www.cdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=81 |title=The Orb - Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld |date=[[2003-10-15]] |last=McCusker |first=Eamonn}}</ref>  A more obvious case was the single "Aftermath"; it featured MC Soom-T rapping about, among other things, [[marijuana]] and its use.

===Imagery===
[[Image:OrbColors.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Orb's performances are noted for the use of psychedelic and science fiction images.]]
Imagery has always been an important part of The Orb's persona.<ref name="toop-live">{{cite news|title=Live and on the record |work=[[The Times]] |date=[[1992-10-28]] |last=Toop |first=David |authorlink = David Toop}}</ref>  This is most prominent during performances, where The Orb often projects surreal images against onstage screens.  Common images that are projected include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and ubiquitous alien references.<ref name="rollingstone-live97">{{cite news|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |title=Review of the Hammerstein Ballroom, NY live show |date=[[1997-05-09]] |url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theorb/articles/story/5925017/the_orb}}</ref>  They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs.<ref name="birmingham-guru"/>  This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins.  Paterson, however, cites [[Godfrey Reggio]]'s and [[Philip Glass]]'s film [[Koyaanisqatsi]], too, as a greater influence with regards to imagery.<ref name="option-97"/>  Because of their use of imagery, The Orb's shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also experimented with in-show imagery and films.<ref name="rollingstone-live97"/>

The Orb has also been noted for their original album art, which features much of the same imagery as their live act.  Noted graphic design group [[The Designers Republic]] created the cover art for the The Orb's earlier work, including ''Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld'', ''U.F.Orb'', and the singles from those two albums.<ref name="backside">{{cite web|title=The Orb Discography |url=http://www.backsideoftheorb.com|accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref>  For their next album, The Orb poked fun at their Pink Floyd comparisons with the cover of ''Live 93'' featuring a floating stuffed sheep over the [[Battersea Power Station]], which had appeared on the cover of Pink Floyd's ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]''.<ref name="JAM">{{cite news|work=JAM (Florida Music Magazine) |date=[[1995-04-26]] |title=Alex Paterson Interview}}</ref>  The artwork found in Badorb.com releases was similar to The Orb's odd artwork of the mid-1990s, as it was stylistically similar and contained little writing.<ref name="citypaper"/>  Alex Paterson cryptically described ''Cydonia''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s cover, which featured a seal balancing a pyramid on its nose, as "a Masonic Disney" symbol and compared the seal and pyramid to the seal and pyramid found on the reverse of the [[United States one-dollar bill]].<ref name="citypaper"/>  Paterson has also dabbled in the creation of cover art himself, designing the cover of ''Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt''.<ref name="discogs-okie">{{cite web|title=Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/547681 |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=2006-11-08}}</ref>

===Science fiction and space===
Some of the more prominent motifs in The Orb's work are outer space and science fiction themes, including alien visitations, [[space flight]], and [[mind control]].  These have included The Orb's use of samples from serious sources such as [[NASA]] transmissions to comedic clips from films like [[Woody Allen]]'s [[Sleeper (film)|Sleeper]].  ''U.F.Orb'' especially expressed a fascination with alien life with its bizarre sound samples and in the album's title itself.<ref name="phoenix"/>  The title of its most popular single, "Blue Room", is itself a reference to the supposed Blue Room of [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], which was heavily investigated as a possible UFO evidence holding room.<ref name="times-hippie"/>  ''Cydonia'', too, is named for a space-related subject, namely after [[Cydonia (Mars)|the area on Mars of the same name]] which was photographed by the [[Viking 1]] and [[Viking 2]] orbiters.<ref name="remixmag-orblivion"/>  Due to Paterson's focus on science fiction and astronomical phenomena, ''[[The Guardian]]'' described Paterson as "pop [music]'s primary spokesperson on aliens".<ref name="guardian-simpson"/>

In The Orb's early DJ events for Land of Oz, Paterson and Cauty performed with three record decks, a cassette player, and a CD player all of which were mixed through an [[Akai]] 12-track [[mixing console|mixer]].<ref name="shih"/>  They used their equipment to harmonize vocal, keyboard, and sound effect samples into an "endless sound continuum" for an audience of worn out clubbers.<ref name="century"/>  Even after The Orb began producing their own original material, they kept the same sample-heavy model for live acts, spontaneously integrating obscure samples into existing material.  During promotional tours for ''Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld'' and ''U.F.Orb'', The Orb performed using a [[Digital audio tape|DAT]] machine and experimented with other media sources such as [[dubplate]]s.  The DAT machines held individual chords, rhythms, and baselines for each composition which The Orb could then easily improvise with and manipulate through the use of sound effect racks.<ref name="keyboard"/>  Often, The Orb would have a live musician accompanying them, such as Steve Hillage on guitar or Jah Wobble playing bass.  Their shows in the early 1990s would often be three hours of semi-improvised, continuous music featuring a wealth of triggered samples, voices, and pre-recorded rhythm tracks.<ref name="times-anything">{{cite news|work=[[The Times]] |last=Gray |first=Louise |date=[[1993-11-18]] |title=Where anything goes}}</ref>  Often The Orb's original tracks would be modified and remixed live to the point that they were barely identifiable.<ref name="times-anything"/>  

[[Image:OrbDisney.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Alex Paterson|Paterson]] and [[Thomas Fehlmann|Fehlmann]] at a 2006 performance at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]].]]

The Orb began performing regularly at the [[Brixton Academy]] in the early 1990s, where they used the high ceilings and large amount of space for their "well-suited amorphous sound".<ref name="guardian-performance97">{{cite news|last=Cartwright |first=Garth |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=[[1997-04-02]] |title=Pop the Orb: Brixton Academy Review}}</ref>  For several years, The Orb used Brixton Academy as their "home" concert venue, frequently performing their newest and more experimental pieces there.<ref name="guardian-performance97"/>  Andy Hughes took Weston's place at live performances after the 1993 tour, though Weston did reappear for The Orb's concert at the rainy [[Woodstock '94]].<ref name="amg-bio"/>  The Orb played for late night raves on the first two nights of Woodstock '94 in addition to artists including [[Aphex Twin]], [[Orbital]], and [[Deee-Lite]].  The next year, The Orb's touring group consisted of Paterson, Hughes, Nick Burton on percussion, and Simon Phillips on bass.  This ensembled of live performers and electronic music created a "cacophony" of "gigantic, swarming sounds".<ref name="times-something">{{cite news|last=Gray |first=Louise |work=[[The Times]] |page=1 |date=[[1995-04-11]] |title=Something in the Air}}</ref>  Though The Orb often has a substantial amount of activity during live performances, Paterson prefers to present The Orb as "a non-centralised figure of amusement on stage".<ref name="independent-earth"/>  Due to this, Paterson expressed a desire to play at smaller venues rather than large clubs in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  He stated that this was because of artistic and personal factors, rather than being unable to fill larger venues.<ref name="nme-concert"/>  Out of this came ''Le Petit Orb'', a low-frills type of concert featuring only Fehlmann and Paterson.

The Orb used the [[ADAT]] format for performances from 1993 to 2001 and utilized large 48-track decks, which Paterson described as basically being a "studio onstage".<ref name="remix">{{cite web|work=[[Remix Magazine]] |last=Micallef |first=Ken |date=[[2004-09-01]] |title=The Orb |url=http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_orb/}}</ref>  They hooked synthesizers, such as the [[ARP 2600]], through [[MIDI]] interfaces to recreate specific sounds that appeared on their albums.<ref name="keyboard"/>  The Orb's methods of studio music creation changed as well.  For more recent albums such as ''Cydonia'', The Orb used equipment such as [[Korg]]'s [[Electribe]] products, which Paterson described as employing more of a "bedroom techno" approach.<ref name="remixmag-orblivion"/>  Despite their use of laptops during performances and in-studio computers, Paterson says that he still cherishes vinyl and does not find purchasing CDs or downloading music to be nearly as satisfying.<ref name="guardian-interview"/>  He admits that while he taped radio shows and copied tapes as a youth, Paterson is "horrified" by the number of people of who download music illegally.<ref name="guardian-interview"/>

The Orb often blurred the distinction between sampling and remixing with their unusual treatment of sampled sounds.  ''Pomme Fritz'', though it was released as a piece of original work, consists largely of manipulated samples.  Conversely, The Orb's remixes typically use only small sections of the original track, most notably in the case of their single "Toxygene".  "Toxygene" was originally commissioned as a remix of [[Jean Michel Jarre]]'s "Oxygene 8" from ''[[Oxygene 7-13]]''.<ref name="spheres">{{cite news|work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] |title=Music of the Spheres |last=Smith |first=Andrew |date=[[1997-02-16]] |page=13}}</ref>  However, The Orb "obliterated it" and reassembled only a few fragments for their remix, much to the chagrin of Jarre, who reportedly "threw a fit and refused to release it".<ref name="spheres"/>  The Orb released the track themselves under the name "Toxygene", which further irritated Jarre, to whom Paterson retorted "The French are always five years behind us, anyway."<ref name="spheres"/>  Besides Jarre, other artists have gotten "agitated" with The Orb sampling their work, though Paterson jokingly suggests that "[t]hey don't know the half of it."<ref name="citypaper"/>  Paterson says that he finds a "beauty" and a "cleverness" with slipping unlicensed samples into compositions without anyone recognizing it.<ref name="keyboard"/>  Even though fans often try to guess the origins of many of The Orb's samples, Paterson states that they are rarely correct and that they would "die" if they discovered, for example, where the drums on "Little Fluffy Clouds" originated from.<ref name="remixmag-orblivion"/>  He has said that his record labels have told him, "Don't tell anyone where you got your samples until we get them cleared!".<ref name="remixmag-orblivion"/>

The Orb has always used a wide variety of audio clips from sources ranging from [[McCarthy era]] speeches to prank phone calls by [[Victor Lewis-Smith]] to [[David Thewlis]]' apocalypse-driven rant from the film ''[[Naked (film)|Naked]]''.<ref name="rollingstone-live97"/>  Paterson obtains many of these samples from recording TV and radio for hours at a time and picking out his favorite clips.<ref name="keyboard"/>  He and other members of The Orb often record nature sounds for use on albums, most notably on ''FFWD'' and ''Orbus Terrarum''.  Though The Orb has been lauded for their "Monty Python-esque levity" in their use of audio samples,<ref name="rs-orblivion"/> ''[[NME]]'' suggested that Paterson seemingly "sabotage[s] his majestic soundscapes" with his frequent use of "irritatingly zany" sounds.<ref name="nme-aubrey">{{cite web|year=2002 |last=Thomas |first=Olly |title=Orb : Auntie Aubrey's Excursions Beyond The Call Of Duty Part 2 |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/orb/6159 |work=[[New Musical Express]]}}</ref>

The Orb has been a prolific remixing team, having completed over 80 commissioned remixes since 1989.<ref name="backside"/>  Even during periods of label conflict and contractual limbo, The Orb found steady work remixing for artists including [[Depeche Mode]], [[Lisa Stansfield]], and [[Front 242]].  Though The Orb's remixes from the early and mid 1990s feature a large number of samples and "zany" samples, ''[[Progressive-Sounds]]'' describe them as "ahead of their time" and ''[[NME]]'' notes them as "not entirely incompatible with contemporary chilling."<ref name="ps-aubrey"/><ref name="nme-aubrey"/>  However, some pieces, such as their [[Bee Gees]] cover collaboration with [[Robbie Williams]], received criticism for being "beyond a joke".<ref name="nme-aubrey"/>  The Orb's remix of [[Nine Inch Nails]]' "[[The Perfect Drug]]", too, was described by ''[[Amazon.com]]'' editor Jeff Bateman as "silly", stating that The Orb made it sound like [[Trent Reznor]] was "drowning in his bathtub".<ref name="amazon-nin">{{cite web|work=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=2006-10-23 |last=Bateman |first=Jeff |title=The Perfect Drug Editorial Review |url=http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Drug-Nine-Inch-Nails/dp/B000001Y7W}}</ref>  Though Paterson maintains that much of The Orb's remix work is done to support other musical projects, he admits some of The Orb's past remix work for major artists was performed so that they could "pay the bills".<ref name="birmingham-guru"/>  Many of these old and formerly rare tracks have been re-released on the ''Auntie Aubrey's Excursions Beyond the Call of Duty'' pair of compilations.
