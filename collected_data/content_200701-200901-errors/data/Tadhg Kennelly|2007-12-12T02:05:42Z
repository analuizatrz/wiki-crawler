'''Tadhg Kennelly''' (born [[1 July]] [[1981]]) is a former [[Gaelic football]] player from [[Listowel]], [[County Kerry]], who is now a backline [[Australian rules football]] player for the [[Sydney Swans]], in the [[Australian Football League|AFL]].  He is the son of [[Tim Kennelly]], a former All-Ireland winner with [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]. Although often mispronounced as "Tie" in Australia, Kennelly's first name is in fact pronounced "Tie-g". It is often described as the Irish language translation of the the English language name Timothy but in fact the two names are probably not related. 

After his debut in 2001 (following elevation from the [[AFL Draft|rookie list]]), he now is a permanent fixture in the Sydney line-up as a dashing rebound defender, wearing the no. 17 guernsey. He was second (behind [[Leo Barry]]) for [[rebound (sports)|rebound]]s (77) from the defensive [[50-metre arc]] in 2004. Tadhg has become a high-profile member of the Swans outfit, well-known for his exciting play, his nationality and his "Talking With Tadhg" articles on the Swans' website.

Kennelly became the first [[Irishman]] to win an [[Australian Football League|AFL]] premiership medal in 2005, after playing all 26 games for the [[Sydney Swans]] that year. The hype surrounding Kennelly's appearance in the [[AFL Grand Final]] was so much that [[Network Ten]] sent out its usual game-day [[boundary rider (sport)|boundary rider]], [[Andrew Maher]], over to [[County Kerry]] to visit Tadhg's family for the week and watch the Grand Final with them. 

In December 2005, Kennelly's father [[Tim Kennelly|Tim]] died suddenly at age 51.[http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/kennellys_champion_irish_dad_dies_after_being_there_for_tadghsswansfairytale/2005/12/07/1133829661245.html] Kennelly has always expressed a desire to return home to Ireland and leave the [[Australian Football League|AFL]], he has indicated a desire to emulate the success of his father and win an [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] medal with his native [[County Kerry]]. It is believed his father's death may have some bearing on that decision.

On the last day of August, 2006, Tadhg Kennelly ended months of speculation by announcing he would be staying on with the Swans for a further 3 years. Kennelly says this will be his last AFL contract and will be returning to Ireland to live at the end of the three year contract. 

There has been a recent movement amongst Sydney Swans fans to persuade Tadhg to change his mind and see out his football career in Sydney. One in particular, Colm MacGowan of Melbourne, had created a group on Facebook titled "Keep Kennelly at the Swans".
