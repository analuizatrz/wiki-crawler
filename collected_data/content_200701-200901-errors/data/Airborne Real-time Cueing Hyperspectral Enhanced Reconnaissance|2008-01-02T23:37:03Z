*[[global positioning system]] (GPS) integrated with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS)

===Hyperspectral imager===
The passive [[hyperspectral]] [[imaging spectroscopy]] [[remote sensor]] observes a target in multi-[[Spectrum|spectral]] bands. The HSI camera separates the image [[spectra]] into 52 "bins" from 500 [[Nanometre|nanometers]]&nbsp;(nm) [[wavelength]] at the blue end of the [[visible spectrum]] to 1100&nbsp;nm in the [[infrared]], giving the camera a [[spectral resolution]] of 11.5&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://tests.cap.af.mil/ops/archer_training/archer_hsi_tech/glossary.cfm | title = HSI Technology - Glossary | accessdate = 2007-10-29 | format = | work = Hyperspectral Imaging Technology for the Non-Scientist| publisher = [[Civil Air Patrol]]}}</ref> Although ARCHER records data in all 52 bands, the computational  algorithms only use the first 40 bands, from 500 nm to 960 nm because the bands above 960 nm are too [[Signal-to-noise ratio|noisy]] to be useful.<ref name=test>{{cite web | url = https://tests.cap.af.mil/ops/archer_training/archer_hsi_tech/Hyperspectral%20&%20High%20Resolution%20Imagery.cfm | title = HSI Technology - HSI and HRI Imagery | accessdate = 2007-10-31 | publisher = [[Civil Air Patrol]]| work = }}</ref> For comparison, the normal human eye will respond to wavelengths from approximately [[1 E-7 m|400 to 700&nbsp;nm]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.howstuffworks.com/light2.htm | title = "How Light Works" | accessdate = 2007-10-29 | author = Freudenrich, Craig | work =  How Stuff Works}}</ref> and is [[trichromatic]], meaning the eye's [[cone cells]] only sense light in three spectral bands.

As the ARCHER aircraft flies over a search area, reflected [[sunlight]] is collected by the HSI camera lens. The collected light passes through a set of lenses that focus the light to form an image of the ground. The imaging system uses a pushbroom approach to image acquisition. With the pushbroom approach, the focusing slit reduces the image height to the equivalent of one pixel. This thin, wide beam is projection onto a diffraction grating, which is a very finely etched reflecting surface that disperses light into its spectra. 

The dispersed light is spread across a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) similar to the image receptor in a typical digital camera, except that this CCD is also sensitive to the near infrared wavelengths up to 1100 nm. The CCD collects the spectral intensities of the dispersed light and converts them to electrical signals. The CCD output consists of electrical signals for 52 spectral bands for each of 504 image pixels. The on-board computer records the CCD output signal at a frame rate of sixty times each second. At an aircraft altitude of 2,500 ft AGL and a speed of 100 knots, a 60 Hz frame rate equates to a ground image resolution of approximately one square meter per pixel. Thus, every frame captured from the CCD contains the spectral data for a ground swath that is approximately one meter long and 500 meters wide.<ref name=test/>

[[Image:ARCHER Hypers6.jpg|thumb|A [[false color]] image from the ARCHER cockpit display combining the HSI and HRI data.]]
===High-resolution imager===
A high-resolution imaging (HRI) black-and-white, or panchromatic, camera is mounted adjacent to the HSI camera to enable both cameras to capture the same reflected light. The HRI camera uses a pushbroom approach just like the HSI camera with a similar lens and slit arrangement to limit the incoming light to a thin, wide beam. However, the HRI camera does not have a diffraction grating to disperse the incoming reflected light. Instead, the light is directed to a wider CCD to capture more image data. Because it captures a single line of the ground image per frame, it is called a line scan camera. The HRI CCD is 6,144 pixels wide and one pixel high. It operates at a frame rate of 720 Hz. At ARCHER search speed and altitude (100 knots over the ground at 2,500 ft AGL) each pixel in the black-and-white image represents a 3 inch by 3 inch area of the ground. This high resolution adds the capability to identify some objects.<ref name=test/>

===Processing===
A monitor in the cockpit displays detailed images in real time, and the system also logs the image and [[Global Positioning System]] data at a rate of 30 [[Gigabyte]]s (GB) per hour for later analysis.<ref name=Friess/> The on-board data processing system performs numerous real-time processing functions including [[data acquisition]] and recording, raw data correction, target detection, cueing and chipping, precision image [[Georeference|geo-registration]], and display and dissemination of image products and target cue information.<ref name=Stevenson2005>{{cite journal

ARCHER has three methods for locating targets: 
*''signature matching'' where reflected light is matched to spectral signatures
*''anomaly detection'' using a statistical model of the [[pixel]]s in the image to determine the probability that a pixel does not match the profile,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://level2.cap.gov/index.cfm?nodeID=5175 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5RjISKtdb|title=CAP's Advanced Technologies Group: Hyperspectral Imaging |archivedate= 2007-09-08 |author= |date=  |publisher= Civil Air Patrol, National Headquarters |quote=…signature matching (matching reflected light to spectral signatures), anomaly detection (calculates a statistical model of all the pixels in the image to see if there is a probability that a pixel does not fit).}}</ref>and 
*''change detection'' which executes a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the current image against ground conditions that were obtained in a previous mission over the same area. 

In change detection, scene changes are identified, and new, moved or departed targets are highlighted for evaluation.<ref name=AFNORTH/> In spectral signature matching, the system can be programmed with the parameters of a missing aircraft, such as paint colors, to alert the operators of possible wreckage.<ref name=Fiorino/> It can also be used to look for specific materials, such as petroleum products or other chemicals released into the environment,<ref name=MoDNR/> or even ordinary items like commonly available blue [[polyethylene]] [[tarpaulin]]s. In an impact assessment role, information on the location of blue tarps used to temporarily repair buildings damaged in a storm can help direct disaster relief efforts; in a counterdrug role, a blue tarp located in a remote area could be associated with illegal activity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spacecomputer.com/tools/online_tools.html |title=SCC's Real-time HSI Data Analysis and Visualization Tools|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5RjISKtdl |archivedate=2007-09-09  |publisher=Space Computer Corporation |quote=Tarp in a remote wooded area—useful for counter-drug applications.}}</ref>
