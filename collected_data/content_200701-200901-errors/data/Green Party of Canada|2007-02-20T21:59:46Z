The '''Green Party of Canada''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] federal [[political party]] founded in [[1983 in Canada|1983]].<ref>[http://www.greenparty.ca/history.html History of the Green Party of Canada,] ''www.greenparty.ca''</ref> As of August 27, 2006, the party has over 10,000 registered members<ref>GPC Leader Elizabeth May on [[CTV Newsnet]] ([http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/HTMLTemplate?tf=/ctv/mar/video/new_player.html&cf=ctv/mar/ctv.cfg&hub=QPeriod&video_link_high=mms://ctvbroadcast.ctv.ca/video/2006/08/26/ctvvideologger2_500kbps_2006_08_26_1156647321.wmv&video_link_low=mms://ctvbroadcast.ctv.ca/video/2006/08/26/ctvvideologger2_218kbps_2006_08_26_1156645910.wmv&clip_start=00:11:40.26&clip_end=00:01:50.47&clip_caption=CTV%20News:%20Graham%20Richardson%20on%20May's%20victory&clip_id=ctvnews.20060826.00159000-00159706-clip6&subhub=video&no_ads=&sortdate=20060825&slug=green_party_speeches_060825&archive=CTVNews#ctvnews.20060826.00159000-00159677-clip1 video clip]), August 27, 2006</ref> — making the Greens the largest federal party in Canada without representation in [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]]. The Greens, as their name indicates, advocate [[green politics]] and are the largest party in Canada to focus primarily on green politics, though other parties have included environmental stances in their platforms.

The party's support has ranged between 4.5% and 12% since the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] and has not polled below 7% in any opinion poll in 2007. In the 2006 election, the Green Party of Canada received 4.5% of the total vote but did not win any seats. In the [[London North Centre]] by-election in November 2006, Elizabeth May won 26% of the vote placing second, ahead of the Conservative and NDP candidates.

[[Elizabeth May]] is the current leader of the party. She was elected on the first ballot by 65% of voting party members on [[August 26]], [[2006]]. After leading the party through the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004]] and [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006]] general federal elections, former leader [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]] chose not to stand for re-election. On [[November 21]], 2006, May appointed outgoing [[Green Party of British Columbia]] leader [[Adriane Carr]] and [[Quebec]] television host [[Claude Genest]] as [[Deputy Leader]]s of the Party.<ref>[http://www.greenparty.ca/mediarelease196.html Elizabeth May Announces Prominent Greens Adriane Carr and Claude William Genest as Deputy Leaders of federal Green Party] Green Party of Canada press release, November 21, 2006.</ref> [[David Chernushenko]], who ran against [[Elizabeth May]] for the party leadership, is currently the Senior Deputy to the Leader.

== Electoral status ==
The Green Party has run a [[full slate]] in the last two elections, fielding candidates in all 308 of the nation's [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]]. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], the Green Party received about 4.5% of the popular vote, only slightly more than in 2004, despite having received public funding (over $1 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] per year) for the first time and receiving more media coverage. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], the Green Party received 4.3% of the popular vote. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 election]], it fielded candidates in 111 of 301 ridings.

No Green Party candidate has yet been elected to the federal or provincial level of government in Canada. Members of the party have achieved municipal offices, though most were elected as individuals and not on Green Party slates or labels in local (at least officially) non-partisan municipal elections. 

However, some people have been elected with a Green Party affiliation identified directly on the ballot. The first two were Art Vanden Berg, elected as a City Councillor in Victoria, British Columbia, on 20 November 1999, and Roslyn Cassells, elected to the Vancouver Parks Board on the same day.<ref>City of Vancouver, [http://vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/election99/results/all.htm#parks Election Summary Report] November 20,1999</ref> [[Andrea Reimer]] was elected as a trustee on the Vancouver School Board in 2002, and [[Sonya Chandler]] was elected to the [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria, BC]], council as a Green. 

Current Greens in office include Councillor [[Jane Sterk]] in [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt, BC]], Mayor [[Ken Melamed]] of [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]] and newly elected Councillor [[Rick Goldring]] in [[Burlington, Ontario]]. Former Councillor [[Elio Di Iorio]] was narrowly defeated in his 2006 reelection bid in [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]] and former Councillor [[Rob Strang]] did not run for reelection in [[Orangeville, Ontario]]. The late [[Richard Thomas (Ontario politician)|Richard Thomas]] served as reeve of [[Armour, Ontario|Armour Township, Ontario]] from 2003 until his death in 2006. There are about 16 other Greens elected to local governments in BC.

On [[October 18]], [[2006]], MP [[Garth Turner]] was suspended from the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] caucus, and subsequently noted to the press that he was considering reaffiliating himself with the Greens, a decision which would have made him the party's first-ever MP. He later decided to remain as an independent member, although he campaigned on behalf of Green Party leader Elizabeth May in the [[London North Centre]] by-election that was held on [[November 27]], [[2006]].

In that by-election, May received 25.9% of the vote, coming in second place behind Liberal [[Glen Pearson]]. This is the highest percentage of the vote a Green candidate has ever received in a Federal election.

== Federal leader, funding and factions ==
Long-time environmental activist and lawyer Elizabeth May won the leadership of the federal Green party at a convention in Ottawa on [[August 26]], [[2006]]. She won with 2,145 votes, or 65.3 per cent of the valid ballots cast and the second-place finisher [[David Chernushenko]], an environmental consultant, collected 1,096 votes or 33.3 per cent of the total.

Previous leader [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]] was first elected to the office with over 80% of the vote and the support of the leaders of all of the provincial level Green parties. He was re-elected on the first ballot by 56% of the membership in a leadership challenge vote in August 2004. [[Tom Manley]] placed second with over 30% of the vote. A few months after the 2004 convention, Tom Manley was appointed Deputy Leader. (On September 23, 2005, Manley left the party to join the [[Liberal Party of Canada]].)

The party secured enough votes in the 2004 election to qualify for the new federal funding, available to parties that received over 2% of the vote. The Green Party received $1.75 per vote it won in the 2004 election for each year leading up to the 2006 election. There was some internal controversy over the distribution and allocation of these funds between central administration and local [[Riding association]]'s and a membership vote was held to resolve the issue. A group of former party activists (two of whom were on the party's federal council), as well as some former NDP members, began a new party, "the Peace and Ecology Party", which they say will have no leader, and adopt a more activist stance, essentially replicating the way the party was organized from 1988-96. This group has not attracted much of a following. Most dissidents have chosen to work within the old party.

=== Exclusion from debates ===
In the 2004 election, the consortium of Canadian television networks did not invite Jim Harris to the televised [[leaders debate]]s. The primary reason given for this was the party's lack of representation in the House of Commons. The same standard had been used in previous debates &mdash; for instance, in 1993, the newly-formed [[Bloc Québécois]] and [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] were included even though neither had won any seats in the 1988 election, as, since then, they each gained at least one seat in the House. Nonetheless, the Greens had a national slate of candidates, versus the Bloc's regional slate, and scored highly on public opinion polls. This led to unsuccessful legal actions by the party, a petition by its supporters to have it included, and statements by non-supporters such as [[Ed Broadbent]] who believed it should be included.

The Green Party was also not included in the leaders' debates for the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 election]].<ref>"[http://www.ccnmatthews.com/news/releases/show.jsp?action=showRelease&searchText=false&showText=all&actionFor=570003 Leaders' Debate: Green Party has earned its spot,]" Green Party of Canada press release, November 30, 2005.</ref> The same reason was given<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/ombudsman/page/green_party_debate.pdf CBC ombudsman's review], 2006</ref>, although some also believed the party's lack of visibility and meaningful input into Canadian federal budgets and bills was a factor. Harris was often criticized very harshly within the party for concentrating on internal infighting at exactly the times such input would be required. 

On [[December 14]], [[2006]], Elizabeth May and Adrianne Carr announced an e-mail petition campaign aimed at the networks that have excluded the Green Party from the televised leaders debates in the past. The website demanddemocraticdebates.ca was created to give Canadians an opportunity to send a message directly to the TV executives who control the debate content.<ref>"[http://www.greenparty.ca/mediarelease207.html demanddemocraticdebates.ca]" Green Party of Canada press release, [[December 14]], [[2006]].</ref>

== History ==
{{main|History of the Green Party of Canada}}
Until 2003 the Party had little capacity to organize itself between elections, and as late as 2000 the party had no persistent infrastructure, and was based out of the same office as the [[Green Party of Ontario]]. It received substantial loans from [[Wayne Crookes]], a BC businessman who had previously also made large donations to the [[Green Party of British Columbia]]. Crookes' influence is one of the main dividing factors factions cite in their complaints about Harris and his allies, who were perceived often as doing his will.

== Internet innovation ==
The Green Party was the first Canadian political party on the Internet, with almost full party contacts across Canada for provincial and federal through e-mail and [[FidoNet]] back in the late 1980s. 

While the organizing and election planning was centralized, policy development was to be decentralized. In February 2004, the [[Green Party of Canada Living Platform]] was initiated by the Party's former Head of Platform and Research, [[Michael Pilling]], to open the party's [[participatory democracy]] to the public to help validate its policies against broad public input. It also made it easy for candidates to share their answers to public interest group questionnaires, find the best answers to policy questions, and for even rural and remote users, and Canadians abroad, to contribute to Party policy intelligence. Its innovative [[Rank a Plank]] system let net users "rank planks" in the 2004 platform, and this gathered some 60,000 online votes (on which planks were key) by election day.

These innovations were wholly abandoned on [[February 9]], [[2005]], just after a harshly worded memo from Crookes in which he claimed that "dysfunctional" elements of the party were "driving out the talented". Living Platform went down for days and returned with every single web address changed. It never recovered, though it is still visible.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

== Policy direction ==
The direction of the 2004 platform, while retaining similar ecological themes as before, was perceived as shifting from a centre-left to a centrist stance or even centre-right position. An emphasis on a [[green tax shift]] which favoured partially reducing income and corporate taxes (while increasing taxes on polluters and energy consumers) created questions as to whether the Green Party was still [[left-wing politics|on the left]] of the political spectrum, or was taking a more [[eco-capitalist]] approach by reducing [[progressive taxation]] in favour of [[regressive taxation]]. Green Party policy writers have challenged this interpretation by claiming that any unintended regressive tax consequences would be fully offset by changes in tax rates and categories as well as an "eco-tax" refund for those who pay no tax. These adjustments are currently published 2006 policy and part of the Green Tax Shift concept.

As early as 2000, the party had published platform comparisons indicating the reasons why supporters of any of the five other Canadian federal political parties should consider voting Green. The Greens have always had right-wing, leftist and centrist factions that have been ascendant at different times in the party's history. Many Greens also claim that this traditional left-right political spectrum analysis does not accurately capture the pragmatic ecological orientation of an evolving Green Party.

The ecumenical approach (expressing affinities with all Canadian political tendencies and making cases to voters on all parts of the left-right spectrum) has been advocated by those who believe their success can be measured by the degree to which other parties adopt Green Party policies. It is however difficult to discern the degree to which this process has contributed to phenomena like the Liberal Party of Canada adopting several key items of the Green program, such as accelerated [[Capital Cost Allowance]] deductions restricted to [[sustainable technology]] only, and the adoption of the [[ecological and social indicator]]s and [[green procurement]] rules Greens have long advocated. The relative degree of influence in developing these policies of Greens, non-partisan environmental groups and the party's own Green wing is difficult to discern.

Still, the party was somewhat embarrassed in 2004 to find [[Greenpeace]] and the [[Sierra Club of Canada]] ranking its environmental platform slightly below that of the NDP (a fact the NDP made much of in some closely-contested ridings in an attempt to encourage Greens and other environmentalists to [[strategic voting|vote for them strategically]]). The 2005/06 Green Party platform once again received the highest environmental marks of any federal party.

== Policies ==
The GPC had originally adopted a form of the [[Ten Key Values of the US Green Party|Ten Key Values]] originally authored by the [[United States Green Party]].

The August 2002 Convention adopted the [[Six Principles]] of the [[Global Greens Charter|Charter]] of the [[Global Greens]], as stated by the Global Greens Conference held in Canberra, Australia in 2001. These principles are the only ones included in the GPC constitution.

== Membership exclusions ==
In 1998, the party adopted a rule that forbids membership in any other federal political party. This was intended to prevent the party from being taken over. This change to the constitution was discussed at a duly constituted GPC General Meeting and was passed by a very large majority. This rule does not apply to staffers or advisors.

In the past, some Green Party members have been comfortable openly working with members of other political parties. For instance, GPC members [[Peter Bevan-Baker]] and [[Mike Nickerson]] worked with Liberal MP [[Joe Jordan (politician)|Joe Jordan]] to develop the [[Canada Well-Being Measurement Act]] which calls upon the government to implement [[Genuine Progress Indicator]]s (GPI). Key parts of this Act passed in the [[37th Canadian Parliament]] in 2003, but the Act disappeared from sight in the 2004 platform. 

A small number of Greens who advocate the more cooperative approach to legislation object to the new rule not to hold cross-memberships, a tool they occasionally employed.

Although the party did not win a seat in the 2004 election, 4.31% of the vote was a significant improvement. Starting in 2004, Canadian political parties who receive 2% of the vote in the last election are eligible for a subsidy ($1.75 per vote in 2004) from the federal government. The 2004 election results earned the Greens around $1 million CAD per year. 

Based on the 2006 vote, the Greens will receive $1.2 million CAD in federal funding each year until the next federal election.

==Leadership election==
{{cleanup-section|February 2007}}
A [[leadership convention|leadership vote]] was held at the party's August 2006 convention. On April 24, 2006, Jim Harris announced his intention not to stand for re-election as party leader.<ref>"[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060424.wxgreen24/BNStory/National/home Harris to give up on Green leadership,]" [[Globe and Mail]], April 24, 2006.</ref> 

Three candidates officially entered the leadership race before the close of nominations on May 31, 2006.

[[David Chernushenko]], 
On March 30, 2006, who ran in both the 2004 and 2006 elections in [[Ottawa Centre]] and received the highest vote count of any Green Party candidate in 2006 with 6,765 votes, declared his intention to run. Mr. Chernushenko's candidacy was confirmed by the party on May 16, 2006.

On May 9, 2006, [[Elizabeth May]], who only weeks earlier had resigned from her position as Executive Director of the [[Sierra Club of Canada]] after leading the organization for 13 years, became the second person to enter the race. Environmentalist [[David Suzuki]] had been encouraging May to enter the leadership contest.<ref>Dennis Buekert, "[http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&pubid=968163964505&cid=1145051410318&col=968705899037&call_page=TS_News&call_pageid=968332188492&call_pagepath=News/News Veteran environmentalist ponders Green Party leadership run,]" [[Toronto Star]], April 14, 2006.</ref> Ms. May's candidacy was confirmed by the party on May 29, 2006.

In late May 2006, [[Jim Fannon]], a three-time Green Party of Canada candidate and current Chief Financial Officer for the [[Green Party of Ontario]]'s St. Catharines Constituency Association announced his intention to run. Mr. Fannon's candidacy was confirmed by the party on May 31, 2006.

May won the leadership with 65% of the vote on the first ballot.

== Affiliations ==
The GPC is a member of the [[Federation of Green Parties of the Americas]] and recognized by the [[Global Greens]] as representing Canadian Greens federally.

==Peace and Ecology Party of Canada==
The Peace and Ecology Party of Canada (in French, ''Parti d'écologie et paix du Canada'') was a left-wing political party founded in 2005 by members of the Green Party of Canada who disagreed with what they considered to be the right-wing direction taken under the leadership of [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]], and by disaffected members of the [[New Democratic Party]] who have left their party for similar reasons. The party no longer maintains its website, but does have a number of "groups" on Yahoo!Groups and Yahoo!Groups Canada devoted to various issues such as labour, the environment, and bioregionalism. The largest "group" is [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pepcurious/ pepcurious], which is intended for people interested in knowing more about the party. All of these groups have had little or no activity. The party was not registered with [[Elections Canada]], did not run candidates in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], and may in fact be defunct.
