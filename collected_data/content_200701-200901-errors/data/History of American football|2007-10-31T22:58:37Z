[[Image:Unknown Early American Football Team.jpg|thumb|right|An early American football team, from the turn of the twentieth century]]
The '''history of American football''', the most popular spectator sport in the [[United States]],<ref name=popular>{{cite web | url = http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/Documents/NFL_all_about_SB_1-07.pdf | title = NFL:America's Choice | date = 2007 | publisher = National Football League | accessdate = 2007-08-15 | format = [[PDF]]}}</ref> can be traced to early versions of [[rugby football]]. Both games have their origin in [[football|varieties of football]] played in the [[United Kingdom]] in the mid-[[nineteenth century]], in which a [[football (ball)|ball]] is kicked at a [[Goal (sport)|goal]] or carried over a line. American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby, most notably the rule changes instituted by [[Walter Camp]], considered the "Father of American Football". Among these important changes were the introduction of the [[line of scrimmage]] and of [[Down (football)|down-and-distance]] rules.<ref name=PFRA2/><ref name=histfoot/><ref name=NFL1869/>

In the late [[19th century|nineteenth]] and early [[20th century|twentieth centuries]], gameplay developments by college coaches such as [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]], [[Knute Rockne]], and [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Glenn "Pop" Warner]] helped take advantage of the newly introduced [[forward pass]]. The popularity of [[College football|collegiate football]] grew as it became the dominant version of the sport for the first half of the twentieth century.  [[Bowl game]]s, a college football tradition, attracted a national audience for collegiate teams. Bolstered by fierce [[List of NCAA college football rivalry games|rivalries]], college football still holds widespread appeal in the United States.

The origin of professional football can be traced back to 1892, with [[William Heffelfinger|William "Pudge" Heffelfinger's]] $500 contract to play in a game for the Allegheny Athletic Association against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. In 1920 the American Professional Football Association was formed. This league changed its name to the [[National Football League]] (NFL) two years later, and eventually became the [[Major North American professional sports leagues|major league]] of American football. Primarily a sport of Midwestern, industrial towns in the United States, professional football eventually became a national phenomenon. Football's increasing popularity is usually traced to the [[1958 NFL Championship Game]], a contest that has been dubbed the "Greatest Game Ever Played". A rival league to the NFL, the [[American Football League]] (AFL), formed in 1960; the pressure it put on the senior league led to a merger between the two leagues and the creation of the [[Super Bowl]], which has become the most watched television event in the United States on an annual basis.<ref name=popular/>  

== Early years ==
=== First collegiate games ===
Games that resemble [[football]] were played informally in the United States as far back as the seventeenth century. The games remained largely unorganized until the nineteenth century, when [[intramural sports|intramural]] games of football began to be played on college campuses throughout the United States. Each school played its own variety of football. [[Princeton University|Princeton]] students played a game called "ballown" as early as 1492. A [[Harvard University|Harvard]] tradition known as "Bloody Monday" began in 1567, which consisted of a mass ballgame between the freshman and sophomore classes. [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] played its own version called "[[Old division football]]", the rules of which were first published in 1871, though the game dates to at least the 1600's. All of these games, and others, shared certain commonalities. They were largely "mob" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple and violence and injury were common.<ref name=PFRA1>{{cite web | title = No Christian End! | work = The Journey to Camp: The Origins of American Football to 1769 | publisher = Professional Football Researchers Association | url = http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=c-to1870 | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref><ref name=ODF>{{cite web | last = Meacham | first = Scott | title = Old Division Football, The Indigenous Mob Soccer Of Dartmouth College (pdf) | publisher = dartmo.com | date = 2020 | url = http://www.dartmo.com/football/Football_Meacham.pdf | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref>  The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. [[Yale University|Yale]], under pressure from the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard followed suit in 1823.<ref name=PFRA1/>

=== "Boston game" ===

While the game was being banned in colleges, it was growing in popularity in various [[New England]] [[University-preparatory school|prep school]]s. In 1855, manufactured inflatable balls were introduced. These were much more regular in shape than the handmade balls of earlier times, making kicking and carrying easier. Two competing versions had evolved during this time; the "kicking game" which resembled [[soccer]] and the "running" or "carrying game" which resembled [[rugby union|rugby]]. A hybrid of the two, known as the "[[Boston Game|Boston game]]", was played by a group known as the [[Oneida Football Club]]. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal [[football club]] in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the "Boston game" on [[Boston Common]]. They played mostly among themselves, though they organized a team of non-members to play a game in November 1863, which the Oneidas won easily. The game caught the attention of the press, and the "Boston game" continued to spread throughout the 1860s.<ref name=PFRA1/><ref>{{cite web | last = Allaway | first = Roger | title = Were the Oneidas playing soccer or not? | work = The USA Soccer History Archives | publisher = Dave Litterer | date = 2001 | url = http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/oneidas.html | accessdate = 2007-05-15}}</ref>

The game began to return to college campuses by the late 1860s. Yale, Princeton, [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], and [[Brown University|Brown]] all began playing the "kicking" game during this time. In 1867, Princeton using rules based on those of the English [[The Football Association|Football Association]].<ref name=PFRA1/>  The "running game", resembling rugby, was taken up by the [[Montreal Football Club]] in [[Canada]] in 1868.<ref name=histfoot>{{cite web | title = The History of Football | work = The History of Sports | publisher = Saperecom | date = 2007 | url = http://www.historyoffootball.net/ | accessdate = 2007-05-15}}</ref>

== Intercollegiate football ==
{{main|College football}}

=== Rutgers v. Princeton (1869) ===

On [[November 6]], [[1869]], [[Rutgers University]] faced [[Princeton University]] in a game that is often regarded as the first game of [[College football|intercollegiate football]].<ref name=histfoot/><ref name=NFL1869> {{cite web | title = NFL History 1869&ndash;1910 | work = NFL.com | publisher = NFL Enterprises LLC | date = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1869-1910 | accessdate = 2007-05-15}}</ref><ref name=PFRA1/><ref>{{cite web | title = 1800s | work = Rutgers Through The Years | publisher = Rutgers University | url = http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref>  The game was played at a Rutgers field under Rutgers rules. Two teams of 25 players attempted to score by kicking the ball into the opposing team's goal. Throwing or carrying the ball was not allowed. The first team to reach six goals was declared the winner. Rutgers crossed the line first and went on to win by a score of six to four. A rematch was played at Princeton a week later under Princeton rules (one notable difference was the awarding of a "free kick" to any player that caught the ball on the fly). Princeton won that game by a score of eight to zero. [[Columbia University|Columbia]] joined the series in 1870, and by 1872 several schools were fielding intercollegiate teams, including Yale and [[Stevens Institute of Technology]].<ref name=PFRA1/>

===Rules standardization (1873&ndash;1880)===

On [[October 19]], [[1873]], representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in [[New York City]] to codify the first set of intercollegiate football rules. Prior to this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on soccer than on rugby, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.<ref name=PFRA1/>

Harvard, which played the "Boston game", a version of football that allowed carrying, refused to attend this rules conference and continued to play under its own code. Harvard's voluntary absence from the meeting made it hard for them to schedule games against other American universities, so it agreed to play [[McGill University]], from [[Montr√©al]], in a two-game series. The McGill team traveled to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] to meet Harvard in a game played under "Boston" rules, followed by a game of rugby. On [[May 14]], [[1874]], the "Boston"-style game, was won easily by Harvard. The next day, the two teams played rugby to a scoreless tie, quite a feat considering that the Harvard team was unfamiliar with the game.<ref name=PFRA1/>

[[Image:1882RutgersFootballTeam.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Rutgers College]] football team of 1882, wearing uniforms typical of the period.]]
Harvard quickly took a liking to the rugby game, and its use of the [[touchdown]] which, until that time, was not used in American football. In late 1874, the Harvard team traveled to Montr√©al to play McGill in rugby, and won by three touchdowns. A year later, on [[June 4]], [[1875]], Harvard faced [[Tufts University]] in the first game between two American colleges played under rules similar to the McGill/Harvard contest.<ref>Gardner (1996)</ref>  The first edition of [[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|The Game]]&mdash;the annual contest between Harvard and Yale&mdash;was played on [[November 13]], [[1875]], under a modified set of rugby rules known as "The Concessionary Rules". Yale lost 4 to 0, but found that it too preferred the rugby style game. Spectators from Princeton carried the game back home, where it also became popular.<ref name=PFRA1/>

On [[November 23]], [[1876]], representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit House in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] to standardize a new code of rules based on the rugby game first introduced to Harvard by McGill University in 1874. The rules were based largely on the Rugby Union Code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring. Three of the schools&mdash;Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton&mdash;formed the [[Intercollegiate Football Association]], as a result of the meeting. Yale did not join the group until 1879, due to an early disagreement about the number of players per team.<ref name=PFRA2> {{cite web | title = Camp and His Followers: American Football 1876&ndash;1889 | work = THE JOURNEY TO CAMP: The Origins of American Football to 1889 | publisher = Professional Football Researchers Association | url = http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=d-to1889 | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref>

====Walter Camp: Father of American football====
[[Image:Walter Camp - Project Gutenberg eText 18048.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Camp]], the "Father of American Football", pictured here in 1878 as the captain of the Yale Football team]]
[[Walter Camp]] is widely considered to be the most important figure in the development of American football.<ref name=PFRA2/><ref name=histfoot/><ref name=NFL1869/>  As a youth, he excelled in sports like [[track and field|track]], [[baseball]], and soccer, and after enrolling at Yale in 1876, he earned varsity honors in every sport the school offered.<ref name=PFRA2/>

Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. He proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the [[line of scrimmage]] and the [[Snap (football)|snap]] from [[center (American football)|center]] to [[quarterback]], was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.<ref name=PFRA2/>

Camp's new scrimmage rules revolutionized the game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play to slow the game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each [[Down (football)|down]]. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined with the establishment of the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby or soccer into the distinct sport of American football.<ref name=PFRA2/>

Camp was central to several more significant rule changes that came to define American football. In 1881, the field was reduced in size to its modern dimensions of 120 by 53 1/3 yards (109.7 by 48.8 meters). Several times in 1883, Camp tinkered with the scoring rules, finally arriving at four points for a touchdown, two points for [[Extra point|kicks after touchdowns]], two points for safeties, and five for [[Field goal (football)|field goals]]. In 1887, gametime was set at two halves of 45 minutes each. Also in 1887, two paid officials&mdash;a [[Official (American football)#Referee|referee]] and an [[Official (American football)#Umpire|umpire]]&mdash;were mandated for each game. A year later, the rules were changed to allow tackling below the waist, and in 1889, the officials were given whistles and stopwatches.<ref name=PFRA2/>

After leaving Yale in 1882, Camp was employed by the New Haven Clock Company until his death in 1925. Though no longer a player, he remained a fixture at annual rules meetings for most of his life, and he personally selected an annual [[All-America|All-American team]] every year from 1898 through 1924. The [[Walter Camp Foundation]] continues to select All-American teams in his honor.<ref name=camp>{{cite web | title = Walter Camp: 1859 &ndash; 1925 | work = Walter Camp History Page | publisher = The Walter Camp Foundation | url = http://www.waltercamp.org/history5.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref>

===Expansion (1880&ndash;1904)===

College football expanded greatly during the last two decades of the nineteenth century. In 1880, only eight universities fielded intercollegiate teams,<ref>{{cite web | title = 1880 season | work = Dolphin Historical Football Ratings | publisher = Dolphin Sim | date = 2005 | url =  http://www.dolphinsim.com/ratings/cf_hist/final1880.html | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> but by 1900, the number had expanded to 43.<ref>{{cite web | title = 1900 season | work = Dolphin Historical Football Ratings | publisher = Dolphin Sim | date = 2005 | url =  http://www.dolphinsim.com/ratings/cf_hist/final1900.html |accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>  Several major [[List of NCAA college football rivalry games|rivalries]] date from this time period, including [[Iron Bowl|Alabama-Auburn]], [[Army-Navy Game|Army-Navy]], and [[Michigan-Ohio State rivalry|Michigan-Ohio State]].

[[Image:Fielding Yost-1902.jpg|thumb|left|University of Michigan football game, 1902]]<!--against who? (Awadewit)-->
In 1879, the [[Michigan Wolverines football|University of Michigan]] became the first team west of Pennsylvania to establish a college football team. Other Midwestern schools soon followed suit, including the [[University of Chicago]], [[Northwestern University]], and the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota]]. The nation's first college football league, the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives (also known as the Western Conference), a precursor to the [[Big Ten Conference]], was founded in 1895.<ref>{{cite web | title = Big Ten History | work = Big Ten Conference - Official Athletic Site - Traditions | date = 2007 | url = http://bigten.cstv.com/trads/big10-trads.html | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> 

Led by legendary coach [[Fielding Yost]], Michigan became the first "western" national power. From 1901 to 1905, Michigan had a 56-game undefeated streak that included a 1902 trip to play in the first [[bowl game|college football post-season game]], the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]]. During this streak, Michigan scored 2,831 points while allowing only 40.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 16</ref>  Another legendary coach, [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]] of the University of Chicago, spent most of his career in the Western Conference. He coached first at the [[Springfield College|Springfield International YMCA Training School]], then Chicago, and later at the [[University of the Pacific]] for a record total of 57 years. As of 2007, he still ranked seventh on the list of winningest football coaches of all time, with 314 wins.<ref>{{cite web | last = Nance | first = Roscoe | title = Legendary Grambling coach Eddie Robinson dies | work = USA TODAY | date = April 4, 2007 | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2007-04-04-eddie-robinson-obit_N.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-19}} &mdash; A chart near the bottom of the article lists the top 10 winningest coaches of all time.</ref>

===Violence and controversy (1905)===

From its earliest days as a mob game, football was a violent sport.<ref name=PFRA1/>  The 1894 Harvard-Yale game, known as the "Hampden Park Blood Bath", resulted in crippling injuries for four players; the contest was suspended until 1897. The annual Army-Navy game was suspended from 1894&ndash;1898 for similar reasons.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 16‚Äì18</ref>  One of the major problems was the popularity of mass-formations like the [[flying wedge]], in which a large number of offensive players charged as a unit against a similarly arranged defense. The resultant collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.<ref> Bennett (1976), pp 20 </ref> 

The situation came to a head in 1905 when there were 19 fatalities nationwide.  [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] threatened to shut the game down if drastic changes were not made. One rule change introduced in 1905, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass. Though it was underutilized for years, this proved to be the last&mdash;and one of the most important&mdash;rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 18</ref> On [[December 28]], [[1905]], 62 schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes to make the game safer. As a result of this meeting, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), was formed.<ref name=NCAA> {{cite web | title = The History of the NCAA | work = NCAA.org | publisher = National Collegiate Athletic Association | url = http://www.ncaa.org/about/history.html | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>

===Modernization and innovation (1906&ndash;1930)===
[[Image:1915 OU Texas game.png|thumb|Photos of the 1915 Oklahoma/Texas game from the Oklahoma yearbook.]]
After the 1905&ndash;1906 reforms, which made mass formation plays illegal and forward passes legal, several coaches emerged who took advantage of these sweeping changes. Amos Alonzo Stagg introduced such innovations as the [[huddle]], the tackling dummy, and the pre-snap shift.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 17 </ref>  Other coaches, such as [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]] and [[Knute Rockne]], introduced new strategies that still remain part of the game.

Besides these coaching innovations, several rules changes during the first third of the twentieth century had a profound impact on the game, mostly in opening up the passing game. In 1914, the first roughing-the-passer penalty was implemented. In 1918, the rules on eligible receivers were loosened to allow eligible players to catch the ball anywhere on the field&mdash;previously strict rules were in place only allowing passes to certain areas of the field.<ref> Vancil (2000) pp 22</ref>  Scoring rules also changed during this time: field goals were lowered to three points in 1909<ref name=NFL1869/> and touchdowns raised to six points in 1912.<ref name=NFL1911> {{cite web | title = NFL History 1911&ndash;1920 | work = NFL.com | publisher = NFL Enterprises LLC | date = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1911-1920 | accessdate = 2007-05-15}}</ref>

Star players that emerged in the early twentieth century include [[Jim Thorpe]], [[Red Grange]], and [[Bronko Nagurski]]; these three made the transition to the fledgling NFL and helped turn it into a successful league. Sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]] helped popularize the sport with his poetic descriptions of games and colorful nicknames for the game's biggest players, including Grange, who he dubbed "The Galloping Ghost," Notre Dame's "[[Four Horsemen (football)|Four Horsemen]]" backfield, and [[Fordham University|Fordham University's]] linemen, known as the "[[Seven Blocks of Granite]]".<ref>Vancil (2000) pp 24 </ref>

====Pop Warner====
Glenn "Pop" Warner coached at several schools throughout his career, including the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]], [[Cornell University]], [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|University of Pittsburgh]], [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]], and the [[Temple Owls football|Temple University]].<ref name=coaches> Bennett (1976), pp 20‚Äì21</ref> One of his most famous stints was at the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]], where he coached [[Jim Thorpe]], who went on to become the first president of the [[National Football League]], an [[1912 Summer Olympics|Olympic Gold Medalist]], and is widely considered one of the best overall athletes in history.<ref> {{cite web | title =  ESPN.com: Top N. American athletes of the century | publisher = ESPN.com | date = 2001 | url = http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/athletes.html | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref><ref> Vancil (2000), pp 20 </ref> Warner wrote one of the first important books of football strategy, ''Football for Coaches and Players'', published in 1927.<ref>{{cite web | title = WorldCat entry for Football for Coaches and Players | publisher = WorldCat.org | url = http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/1741453 | accessdate = 2007-08-23}}</ref>  Though the [[Shift (football)|shift]] was invented by Stagg, Warner's [[single wing]] and double wing [[Formation (American football)|formations]] greatly improved upon it; for almost 40 years, these were among the most important formations in football. As part of his single and double wing formations, Warner was one of the first coaches to effectively utilize the forward pass. Among his other innovations are modern blocking schemes, the [[three-point stance]], and the [[reverse (American football)|reverse]] play.<ref name=coaches/>

====Knute Rockne====
[[Image:NotreDameFightingIrish.png|thumb|right|As both a player and a coach, [[Knute Rockne]] brought Notre Dame's football program national recognition.]]
Knute Rockne rose to prominence in 1913 as an [[end (American football)|end]] for the University of Notre Dame, then a largely unknown midwestern [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] school. When Army scheduled Notre Dame as a warm-up game, they thought little of the small school. Rockne and quarterback [[Gus Dorais]] made innovative use of the forward pass, still at that point a relatively unused weapon, to defeat Army 35&ndash;13 and helped establish the school as a national power. Rockne returned to coach the team in 1918, and devised the powerful [[Notre Dame Box]] offense, based on Warner's single wing. He is credited with opening up the game and being the first major coach to emphasize offense over defense. In 1927, his complex shifts led directly to a rule change whereby all offensive players had to stop for a full second before the ball could be snapped. Rather than simply a regional team, Rockne's "Fighting Irish" became famous for [[Barnstorm (athletics)|barnstorming]] and played any team at any location. It was during Rockne's tenure that the annual [[Jeweled Shillelagh|Notre Dame-University of Southern California rivalry]] began. He led his team to an impressive 105&ndash;12&ndash;5 record before his premature death in a plane crash in 1931. So famous was he at that point that his funeral was broadcast nationally on radio.<ref name=coaches/><ref> Vancil (2000), pp 19‚Äì22</ref>

===From a regional to a national sport (1930&ndash;1958)===

In the early 1930s, the college game continued to grow, particularly in the [[Southern United States|south]], bolstered by fierce rivalries such as the "[[Third Saturday in October]]"&mdash;a rivalry between [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] and [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]]. While prior to the mid-1920s most national powers came from the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]] or the [[Midwestern United States|midwest]], the trend changed when [[Wallace Wade|Wallace Wade's]] 1925 Alabama team won the 1926 Rose Bowl ''en route'' to its first national title. Because the South lacked any professional major league sports presence, college football quickly became its most popular spectator sport.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 24‚Äì29 </ref>

[[Image:Logo of the SEC.png|thumb|left|The [[Southeastern Conference]] was founded in 1932]]
Several major modern college football conferences rose to prominence during this time period. The [[Southwest Athletic Conference]] had been founded in 1915. Consisting mostly of schools from Texas, the conference saw back-to-back national champions with [[TCU Horned Frogs football|Texas Christian University]] (TCU) in 1938 and [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] in 1939.<ref name=1930s>McCambridge (1999), pp 124</ref><ref> {{cite web | title = A Look Back at the Southwest Conference | work = 2006‚Äì2007 Texas Almanac | publisher = The Dallas Morning News | date = 2007 | url = http://www.texasalmanac.com/history/highlights/swc/ | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}</ref>  The [[Pacific Coast Conference]] (PCC), a precursor to the [[Pacific Ten Conference]] (Pac-10), had its own back-to-back champion in the [[USC Trojan football|University of Southern California]] which was awarded the title in 1931 and 1932.<ref name=1930s/>  The [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) formed in 1932 and consisted mostly of schools in the [[Deep South]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Ours | first = Robert M. | title = Southeastern Conference | work = College Football Encyclopedia | publisher = Augusta Computer Services | date = 2007 | url = http://www.footballencyclopedia.com/sechome.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}</ref>  As in previous decades, the Big Ten continued to dominate in the 1930s and 1940s, with Minnesota winning 5 titles between 1934 and 1941, and Michigan (1933 and 1948) and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] (1942) also winning titles.<ref name=1930s/><ref name=1940s> McCambridge (1999), pp 148</ref>

As it grew beyond its regional affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new [[bowl game]]s were created: the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], [[Sugar Bowl]], the [[Sun Bowl]] in 1935, and the [[Cotton Bowl (game)|Cotton Bowl]] in 1937. In lieu of an actual national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant regions of the country that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the [[Associated Press]] began its [[AP Poll|weekly poll]] of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, the final version of the AP poll was used to determined who 
was crowned the [[Mythical National Championship|National Champion]] of college football.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 30</ref>

The 1930s saw growth in the passing game. Though some coaches, such as General [[Robert Neyland]] at Tennessee, continued to eschew its use, several rules changes to the game had a profound effect on teams' ability to throw the ball. In 1934, the rules committee removed two major penalties&mdash;a loss of five yards for a second incomplete pass in any series of downs and a loss of possession for an incomplete pass in the end zone&mdash;and shrunk the circumference of the ball, making it easier to grip and throw. Players who became famous for taking advantage of the easier passing game included Alabama receiver [[Don Hutson]] and TCU passer [[Sammy Baugh|"Slingin" Sammy Baugh]].<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 28‚Äì30</ref>

[[Image:Cappelletti Heisman Trophy.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Heisman Trophy]]]]
In 1935, New York City's [[Downtown Athletic Club]] awarded the first [[Heisman Trophy]] to Chicago halfback [[Jay Berwanger]], who was also the first ever [[NFL Draft]] pick in 1936. The trophy was designed by sculptor [[Frank Eliscu]] and modeled after [[New York University|NYU]] player [[Ed Smith (football player)|Ed Smith]]. The trophy recognizes the nation's best college football player and has become one of the most coveted awards in all of American sports.<ref> {{cite web | title = A Brief History of the Heisman Trophy | work = Heisman Trophy | publisher = heisman.com | url = http://www.heisman.com/history/heisman-trophy.html | date = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], college football players enlisted in the [[Military of the United States|armed forces]]. As most of these players had eligibility left on their college careers, some of them returned to college at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], bringing Army back-to-back national titles in 1944 and 1945 under coach [[Earl Blaik|Red Blaik]].  [[Doc Blanchard]] (known as "Mr. Inside") and [[Glenn Davis]] (known as "Mr. Outside") both won the [[Heisman Trophy]], in 1945 and 1946 respectively. On the coaching staff of those 1944&ndash;1946 Army teams was future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] coach [[Vince Lombardi]].<ref name=1940s/><ref> Vancil (2000), pp 39</ref>

The 1950s saw the rise of yet more [[Dynasty (sports)|dynasties]] and power programs.  [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], under coach [[Bud Wilkinson]], won three national titles (1950, 1955, 1956) and all ten [[Big Eight Conference]] championships in the decade while building a record 47 game winning streak that still stands today.  [[Woody Hayes]] led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and dominated the Big Ten conference, winning three [[Big Ten Conference football champions|Big Ten titles]]&mdash;more than any other school. Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw a revival of the running game in the 1950s. Passing numbers dropped from an average of 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged just shy of 50 running plays per game. Nine out of ten Heisman trophy winners in the 1950s were runners. Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substantial decline in success; the 1950s were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title.  [[Paul Hornung]], Notre Dame quarterback, did however win the Heisman in 1956, becoming the only player from a losing team ever to do so.<ref> Vancil (2000), pp 41‚Äì45</ref><ref name=1950s> McCambridge (1999) pp 172</ref>

===Modern college football (1958&ndash;present)===
Following the enormous television success of the [[National Football League|National Football League's]] [[1958 NFL Championship Game|1958 championship game]], college football no longer enjoyed the same popularity as the NFL, at least on a national level. While both games benefited from the advent of television, since the late 1950s, the NFL has become a nationally popular sport while college football has maintained strong regional ties.<ref> McCambridge (1999), pp 171</ref><ref>Bennett (1976) pp 56</ref><ref name=greatest>{{cite web | last = Barnidge | first = Tom | title = 1958 Colts remember the 'Greatest Game' | publisher = nfl.com | date = 2000 | url = http://www.nfl.com/insider/story/6032205 | accessdate = 2007-03-21}} reprinted from Official [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] Game Program.</ref>

[[Image:College Football CSU AF.jpg|thumb|left|A college football game between Colorado State University and the Air Force Academy]]
As professional football became a national television phenomenon, college football did as well. In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, but by and large the sport still retained a mostly regional following.<!--repeats information in previous paragraphs - pare down (Awadewit)-->  In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the [[Sherman Anti-Trust Act]]; the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled against the NCAA and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals.  [[ABC Sports]] began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.<ref> Vancil (2000) pp 46‚Äì48</ref>

New formations and play sets continued to be developed.<!--could you briefly characterize them? (Awadewit)-->  [[Emory Bellard]], an assistant coach under [[Darrell Royal]] at the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]], developed a three-back [[option offense|option]] style offense known as the [[wishbone formation|wishbone]].   The wishbone is a run-heavy offense that depends on the quarterback making last second decisions on when and to whom to hand or pitch the ball to. Royal went on to teach the offense to other coaches, including [[Bear Bryant]] at Alabama, [[Chuck Fairbanks]] at Oklahoma and [[Pepper Rodgers]] at [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]]; who all adapted and developed it to their own tastes.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 56</ref>  The strategic opposite of the wishbone is the [[spread offense]], developed by professional and college coaches throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Though some schools play a run-based version of the spread, its most common use is as a passing offense designed to "spread" the field both horizontally and vertically.<ref name=formations> Bennett (1976), Appendix pp 209‚Äì217</ref>

{{main|Bowl game}}
In 1940, there were only five bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar, Sun, and Cotton). By 1950, three more had joined that number and in 1970, there were still only eight. The number grew to eleven in 1976. At<!--or "because of"? (Awadewit)--> the birth of [[cable television]] and cable sports networks like [[ESPN]], there were fifteen bowls in 1980. With more national venues and increased available revenue, the bowls saw an explosive growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In the twenty years from 1960 to 1980, seven bowl games were added to the schedule. From 1980 to 2006, an additional 17 bowl games were added to the schedule.<ref name=bowls1/><ref name=hickok1>{{cite web | title = College Bowl Games | work = Hickok Sports | date = 2006 | url = http://www.hickoksports.com/history/collbowl.shtml | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref>  Some have criticized this growth, claiming that the increased number of games has diluted the significance of playing in a bowl game. Yet others have countered that the increased number of games has increased exposure and revenue for a greater number of schools, and see it as a positive development.<!--is there a view that predominates? (Awadewit)--><ref> {{cite web | last = Celezic | first = Mike | title = Too many bowl games?

With the growth of bowl games, it became difficult to determine a national champion in a fair and equitable manner. As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a tie-in), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the [[Bowl Coalition]], which attempted to arrange an annual #1 versus #2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years, however several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences&mdash;the Pac-10 and Big Ten&mdash;meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition was replaced by the [[Bowl Alliance]], which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national champion to three<!--I don't follow (Awadewit)-->&mdash;the [[Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta]], Sugar, and Orange Bowls&mdash;and the participating conferences to five&mdash;the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], SEC, Southwest, Big Eight, and [[Big East Conference|Big East]]. It was agreed that the #1 and #2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the Big Ten, Pac-10, or the Rose Bowl, and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.<ref name=BCS>{{cite web | title = BCS Chronology | publisher = FOX Sports on MSN | date = 2006 | url = http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref><ref name=hickok1/>

====Bowl Championship Series====
[[Image:Foxbcslogo.jpg|thumb|right|Logo of the [[Bowl Championship Series]]]]
{{main|Bowl Championship Series}}
In 1998, a new system was put into place, the Bowl Championship Series. For the first time, it included all major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-10, and SEC) and all four major bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta). The champions of these six conferences, along with two "at-large" selections, were invited to play in the four bowl games. Each year, one of the four bowl games served as a national championship game. Also, a complex system of human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule calculations was instituted to rank schools. Based on this ranking system, the #1 and #2 teams met each year in the national championship game. Traditional tie-ins were maintained for schools and bowls not part of the national championship. For example, in years when not a part of the national championship, the Rose Bowl still hosted the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions.<ref name=BCS/>

The system continued to change, as the formula for ranking teams was tweaked from year to year. At-large teams could be chosen from any of the [[Division I]] conferences, though only one selection&mdash;[[Utah Utes football|Utah]] in 2005&mdash;came from a non-BCS affiliated conference. Starting with the 2006 season, a fifth game&mdash;simply called the [[BCS National Championship Game]]&mdash;was added to the schedule, to be played at the site of one of the four BCS bowl games on a rotating basis, one week after the regular bowl game. This opened up the BCS to two additional at-large teams. Also, rules were changed to add the champions of five additional conferences ([[Conference USA]], the [[Mid-American Conference]], the [[Mountain West Conference]], the [[Sun Belt Conference]] and the [[Western Athletic Conference]]), provided that said champion ranked in the top twelve in the final BCS rankings.<ref name=BCS/>

==Professional football==
{{see also|National Football League}}
===Early players, teams, and leagues (1892&ndash;1919)===
In the early twentieth century, football began to catch on among the general population of the United States and was the subject of intense competition and rivalry, albeit of a localized nature. Although payments to players were considered unsporting and dishonorable at the time, a [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] area club, the Allegheny Athletic Association, surreptitiously hired former Yale All-American guard [[William Heffelfinger|William "Pudge" Heffelfinger]]. On [[November 12]], [[1892]], Heffelfinger became the first known professional football player. He was paid $500 to play in a game against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. Heffelfinger picked up a Pittsburgh fumble and ran 35 yards for a touchdown, winning the game 4&ndash;0 for Allegheny. Although observers held suspicions, the payment remained a secret for years.<ref name=birth> {{cite web | title = History: The Birth of Pro Football | publisher = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/birth.jsp | accessdate = 2007-06-05}}</ref><ref> {{cite web | title = Heffelfinger, "Pudge" (William W.) | work = Sports Biographies | publisher = HickokSports.com | date = 2004 |url = http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/heffelfingerpudge.shtml | accessdate = 2007-06-05}}</ref><ref name=histfoot/><ref name=NFL1869/>

On [[September 3]], [[1895]] the first wholly professional game was played, in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]], [[Pennsylvania]], between the Latrobe [[YMCA]] and the Jeannette Athletic Club. Latrobe won the contest 12‚Äì0.<ref name=histfoot/><ref name=NFL1869/> In 1897, the Latrobe Athletic Association paid all of its players for the whole season, becoming the first fully professional football team. In 1899, the Morgan Athletic Club, on the [[South side of Chicago]], was founded. This team later became the [[Arizona Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]], and now is known as the [[Arizona Cardinals]], making them the oldest continuously operating professional football team.<ref name=NFL1869/>

The first known professional football league, known as the National Football League (not the same as the modern league) began play in 1902 with teams from the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid Atlantic]] region. Several [[baseball]] clubs formed football teams to play in the league, including the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. A five-team tournament, known as the World Series of Football was organized by the league. The league and the World Series only lasted two seasons.<ref name=NFL1869/>

The game moved west into [[Ohio]] which became the center of professional football during the early decades of the twentieth century. Small towns such as [[Massillon, Ohio|Massillon]], [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Portsmouth, Ohio|Portsmouth]], and [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] all supported professional teams. In 1915, the [[Canton Bulldogs]] signed former Olympian and Carlisle Indian School standout Jim Thorpe to a contract. Thorpe became the face of professional football for the next several years and was present at the founding of the National Football League five years later.<ref name=NFL1869/><ref>Bennett (1976), pp 22</ref>

===Early years of the NFL (1920&ndash;1945)===
====Formation====
[[Image:Jim Thorpe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jim Thorpe]], the first NFL president, shown here in his Carlisle Indian School uniform]]
In 1920, the first professional league, the [[National Football League|American Professional Football Association]], was founded, in a meeting at a [[Hupmobile]] car dealership in Canton, Ohio. Jim Thorpe was elected the league's first president. After several more meetings, the league's membership was formalized. The original teams were:<ref name=NFL1911/><ref name=hicknfl> {{cite web | last = Hickock | first = Ralph | title = NFL Franchise Chronology | publisher = HickokSports.com | date = 2004 | url = http://www.hickoksports.com/history/nflfranchises.shtml | accessdate = 2007-06-05}}</ref>

* [[Rochester Jeffersons]]
* [[Rock Island Independents]]

In its early years the league was little more than a formal agreement between teams to play each other and to declare a champion at season's end. Teams were still permitted to play non-league members. The 1920 season saw several teams drop out and fail to play through their schedule. Only four teams: Akron, Buffalo, Canton, and Decatur, finished the schedule. Akron claimed the first league champion, with the only undefeated record among the remaining teams.<ref name=NFL1911/><ref>Bennett (1976), pp 22‚Äì23</ref>

====Expansion====
In 1921, several more teams joined the league, increasing the membership to 22 teams. Among the new additions were the [[Green Bay Packers]], which is the only team in the NFL to retain the same name and home city. Also in 1921, [[A.E. Staley]], the owner of the Decatur Staleys, sold the team to player-coach [[George Halas]], who went on to become one of the most important figures in the first half century of the NFL. In 1922, Halas moved the team to Chicago and renamed it the [[Chicago Bears]].<ref name=NFL1921> {{cite web | title = NFL History 1921&ndash;1930 | work = NFL.com | publisher = NFL Enterprises LLC | date = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1921-1930 | accessdate = 2007-06-05}}</ref><ref>Bennett (1976), pp 23‚Äì24</ref>

By the mid-1920s, NFL membership had grown to 25 teams, and a rival league known as the [[American Football League#Earlier AFLs|American Football League]] was formed. The rival AFL folded after a single season, but it symbolized a growing interest in the professional game. Several college stars joined the NFL, most notably [[Red Grange]] from the [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|University of Illinois]], who was taken on a famous barnstorming tour in 1925 by the Chicago Bears.<ref>Bennett (1976), pp 25‚Äì26</ref><ref name=NFL1921/>

====1932 NFL playoff game====
{{main|NFL Playoff Game, 1932}}

At the end of the [[1932 NFL season|1932 season]], the [[Chicago Bears]] and the [[Detroit Lions|Portsmouth Spartans]] were tied with the best regular-season records. To determine the champion, the league voted to hold its first [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|playoff game]]. Because of cold weather, the game was held indoors at [[Chicago Stadium]], which forced some temporary rule changes. Chicago won, 9&ndash;0. The playoff proved so popular that the league reorganized into two divisions for the [[1933 NFL season|1933 season]], with the winners advancing to a scheduled championship game. A number of new rule changes were also instituted: the goal posts were moved forward to the goal line, every play started from between the [[hash marks]], and forward passes could originate from anywhere behind the [[line of scrimmage]] (instead of the previous five yards behind).<ref>{{cite web | title =History 1931-1940 | work = NFL.com | publisher = NFL Enterprises LLC | date = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/date/1931-1940 | accessdate = 2007-10-12}}</ref><ref name=hick32> {{cite web | last = Hickock | first = Ralph | title = The 1932 NFL Championship Game | publisher = HickokSports.com | date = 2004 | url = http://www.hickoksports.com/history/histbit1.shtml | accessdate = 2007-06-05}}</ref><ref>Bennett (1976), pp 32‚Äì33</ref>  In 1936, the NFL instituted the first ever [[NFL draft|draft]] of college players.

====War years====
In 1941, the NFL named its first Commissioner, [[Elmer Layden]]. The new office replaced that of President. Layden held the job for five years, before being replaced by [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] co-owner [[Bert Bell]] in 1946.<ref name=NFL1941> {{cite web | title = NFL History 1941&ndash;1950 | work = NFL.com | publisher = NFL Enterprises LLC | date = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1941-1950 | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref> 

During [[World War II]], a player shortage led to a shrinking of the league as several teams folded and others merged. Among the short-lived merged teams were the [[Steagles]] (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia) in 1943, the [[Card-Pitt|Carpets]] (Chicago Cardinals and Pittsburgh) in 1944, and a team formed from the merger of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[Boston Yanks]] in 1945.<ref name=hicknfl/><ref name=NFL1941/>

=== Stability and growth of the NFL (1946&ndash;1957) ===
1946 was an important year in the history of professional football. Bert Bell became commissioner of the NFL, providing a stable source of leadership for the next 13 years.<ref name=NFL1941/><ref>{{cite web | title = Bert Bell 1946‚Äì1959 | work = Sports e-cyclopedia | publisher = Tank Productions | date = 2002 | url = http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/comish/bbell.html | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref>  Before he became commissioner, league membership was fluid; between 1920 and 1945, 53 teams had gone defunct.<!--and after? what were the precise effects of his term?

During the 1950s, additional teams entered the league. In 1950, the AAFC folded, and three teams from that league were absorbed into the NFL: the [[Cleveland Browns]] (who had won the AAFC Championship every year of the league's existence), the [[San Francisco 49ers]], and the Baltimore Colts (not the same as the modern franchise, this version folded after one year). The remaining players were chosen by the now 13 NFL teams in a [[dispersal draft]].

=== NFL supremacy (1958&ndash;present)===
====The Greatest Game Ever Played====
{{main|1958 NFL Championship Game}}

At the conclusion of the [[1958 NFL season]], the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] and the [[New York Giants]] met at [[Yankee Stadium]] to determine the league champion. Tied after 60 minutes of play, it became the first NFL game to go into [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] [[Overtime (sport)|overtime]]. The final score was [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] 23, [[New York Giants]] 17. The game has since become widely known as "the Greatest Game Ever Played". It was carried live on the [[NBC]] television network, and the national exposure it provided the league has been cited as a watershed moment in professional football history, helping propel the NFL to become one of the most popular sports leagues in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | last = Barnidge | first = Tom | url =http://www.nfl.com/insider/story/6032205 | title = 1958 Colts remember the 'Greatest Game'| publisher = nfl.com, reprinted from Official [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] Game Program | accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref><ref name=NFL1951/><ref>Peretz (1999), pp 58-59</ref> Journalist Tex Maule said of the contest, "This, for the first time, was a truly epic game which inflamed the imagination of a national audience."<ref>MacCambridge (1999), pp 171</ref>

====American Football League and merger====
In 1959, longtime NFL commissioner Bert Bell died of a heart attack while attending an Eagles/Steelers game at [[Franklin Field]]. That same year, [[Dallas, Texas]] businessman [[Lamar Hunt]] led the formation of the rival [[American Football League]], the fourth such league to bear that name. Unlike the earlier rival leagues, and bolstered by television exposure, the AFL posed a significant threat to NFL dominance of the professional football world. With the exception of Los Angeles and New York, the AFL avoided placing teams in markets where they directly competed with established NFL franchises. In 1960, the AFL began play with eight teams, and new NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] took office.<ref name=NFL1951/>

[[Image:AmericanFootballLeague.png|thumb|left|The [[American Football League]], 1960&ndash;1970]]
The AFL became a viable alternative to the NFL as it made a concerted effort to poach established talent from the NFL and worked hard to secure top college players. Led by [[Oakland Raiders]] owner and AFL commissioner [[Al Davis]], the AFL established a "war chest" to entice top talent with higher pay than they got from the NFL. Former Green Bay Packers quarterback [[Babe Parilli]] became a star for the [[New England Patriots|Boston Patriots]] during the early years of the AFL, and University of Alabama passer [[Joe Namath]] rejected the NFL to play for the [[New York Jets]]. Namath became the face of the league as it reached its height of popularity in the mid-1960s. Davis's methods worked, and in 1966, the junior league forced a partial merger with the NFL. The two leagues agreed to have a common [[NFL draft|draft]] and play in a common season-ending championship game, known as the AFL-NFL World Championship. Two years later, the game's name was changed to the [[Super Bowl]].<ref name=NFL1961> {{cite web | title = NFL History 1961&ndash;1970 | work = NFL.com | publisher = NFL Enterprises LLC | date = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1961-1970 | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}</ref><ref name=AFL>{{cite web | title = Remember the AFL | publisher = American Football League Hall of Fame | date = 2003 | url =http://www.remembertheafl.com/AFL.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = History of the Super Bowl | publisher = SuperNFL.com | url = http://www.supernfl.com/SuperBowl/SuperBowlHistory.html | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}</ref>

The NFL won the first two Super Bowls handily, and it looked as though the younger AFL was outclassed. Following the 1968 season, [[Super Bowl III]] proved to be the turning point in the AFL's fortunes. The heavily favored Baltimore Colts lost to the New York Jets and Joe Namath, cementing the AFL's place as equal in stature to the NFL. In 1970, the two leagues [[AFL-NFL merger|merged]] to form a new 26-team league.<ref name=NFL1961/>

====Modern NFL====

One of the things that has marked the modern NFL as different from other [[Major North American professional sports leagues|major professional sports leagues]] is the apparent parity among its 32 teams.<ref name=parity>{{cite web | last=Roddenberry | first = Sam | title = The Joys of parity | work = The Harvard Independent | date = 2001 | url = http://www.harvardindependent.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleID=7657 | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}</ref>  While from time to time, [[Dynasty (sports)|dominant teams]] have arisen, such as the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] of the 1970s,<ref name=NFL1971/> or the [[New England Patriots]] of the 2000s,<ref name=NFL2001>{{cite web | title = NFL History 2001&ndash; | work = NFL.com | publisher = NFL Enterprises LLC | date = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/2001- | accessdate = 2007-09-06}}</ref> the league has been cited as one of the few where every team has a realistic chance of winning the championship from year to year.<ref name=parity/>  The league's complex labor agreement with its [[NFLPA|player's union]], which mandates a hard [[salary cap]] and revenue sharing among its clubs, prevents the richest teams from stockpiling the best players and gives even teams in smaller cities such as [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] and [[New Orleans]] the opportunity to compete for the Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite web | last = Landsburg | first = Steven E. | title = The NFL's Parity Perplex | work = Slate.com | publisher = Washington Post.

Since taking over as commissioner prior to the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]], [[Roger Goodell]] has made [[National Football League player conduct controversy|player conduct]] a priority of his office. Since taking office, several high profile players have experienced trouble with the law, from [[Pacman Jones|Adam "Pacman" Jones]] to [[Michael Vick]].

====Other professional leagues====

Several other professional football leagues have been formed since the AFL-NFL merger, though none have had the success of the AFL. In 1974, the [[World Football League]] formed, and despite attracting such stars as [[Larry Czonka]] away from the NFL with lucrative contracts, the league was financially insolvent and folded after only two seasons. In 1982, the [[United States Football League]] formed as a spring league, and enjoyed moderate success during its first two seasons behind such stars as [[Jim Kelly]] and [[Herschel Walker]]. It moved its schedule to the fall in 1985, and tried to compete with the NFL directly, but it was unable to do so and folded, despite winning an anti-trust suit against the older league. In 2001, the [[XFL]] was formed as a joint venture between the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] and the NBC television network. It folded after one season, and XFL stars such as [[Tommy Maddox]] and [[Rod Smart|Rod "He Hate Me" Smart]] enjoyed limited success in the NFL.<ref name=NFL1971> {{cite web | title = NFL History 1971‚Äì1980 | work = NFL.com | publisher = NFL Enterprises LLC | date = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1971&ndash;1980 | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = History of the USFL | publisher = Our Sports Central | url = http://www.oursportscentral.com/usfl/history.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Boehlert | first = Eric | title = XFL makes history! | work = Salon Arts and Entertainment | publisher = Salon.com | date = 2001 | url = http://archive.salon.com/ent/tv/feature/2001/03/19/xfl_history/index.html | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}</ref>

The NFL founded a developmental league known as the [[World League of American Football]] with teams based in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The WLAF ran for two years, from 1991 to 1992. The league went on a two-year hiatus before reorganizing as [[NFL Europe]] in 1995, with teams only in European cities. The name of the league was changed to NFL Europa in 2006. After the 2007 season, the NFL announced that it was closing down the league to focus its international marketing efforts in other ways, such as playing NFL regular season games in cities outside of the U.S.<ref>{{cite web | title = NFL Europe homepage | url = http://www.nfleurope.com/ | date = 2007 | publisher = World League Licensing LLC | accessdate = 2007-07-02}}</ref>

Two football leagues are scheduled to begin play in the near future. The [[All American Football League]], scheduled to begin play in March or April 2008, will be based in communities with large college football followings but no NFL team.<ref name=AAFL>{{cite web | last = Klosterman | first = Chuck | title = AAFL planning spring fling in 2008 | work = ESPN Page 2 | publisher = ESPN Internet Ventures | date = 2007-05-05 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=klosterman/070605&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab3pos2 | accessdate = 2007-08-20}}</ref>  The [[United Football League (planned)|United Football League]], scheduled to open in August 2008, will be a fall league in direct competition with the NFL.

==Amateur football outside the United States ==

{{seealso|List of leagues of American football}}
 
American football has been played outside the US since the [[1920s]] and accelerated in popularity after [[World War II]], especially in countries with large numbers of U.S. military personnel, who often formed a substantial proportion of the players and spectators.
 
In [[1998]], the [[International Federation of American Football]], was formed to coordinate international amateur competition. At present, 45 associations from [[The Americas]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]] are organized within the IFAF, which claims to represent 23 million amateur athletes.<ref>[http://www.ifaf.info/ International Federation of American Football, 2004, "IFAF"] Access date: October 12, 2007.</ref> The IFAF, which is based in [[Paris]], [[France]], organizes the quadrennial [[American Football World Cup]].

Until 2007, Japan dominated amateur football outside of the USA.<ref>(2007). "[http://www.american-football-japan.com/index.htm American Football in Japan]". ''american-football-japan.com''. Retrieved on [[October 12]] [[2007]].</ref> The Japanese national team won the first two world cups &mdash; hosted by [[Italy]] in [[1999 IFAF World Cup|1999]] and [[Germany]] in [[2003 IFAF World Cup|2003]] &mdash; defeating [[Mexico]] in the play-off on both occasions. Japan had never lost a game until it went down at home, 23-20, to the [[United States national American football team|US Amateur Team]] in the final of the [[2007 IFAF World Cup|2007 World Cup]].

===Mexico===
American football has been played in Mexico since the early 1920s, and is a strong minority sport at Mexican colleges and universities, mainly in [[Mexico City]]. Over successive decades, more universities and colleges joined the championship, and four categories, called ''fuerzas'', were created. The First ''Fuerza'' became the [[Mexican College Football|National League]] in 1970. In 1978, this was reorganized under the name ''Organizaci√≥n Nacional Estudiantil de F√∫tbol Americano'' (ONEFA).

===Japan===
The [[Japan American Football Association]] was founded in [[1934]] with three collegiate teams: [[Rikkyo University|Rikkyo]], [[Meiji University|Meiji]] and [[Waseda University|Waseda]].<ref>[http://www.american-football-japan.com/footballjapan-history-eng.htm american-football-japan.com, 2006, "History". Access date: October 12, 2007.]</ref> By 1937, an allstar game involving teams representing eastern and western Japan, attracted over 25,000 spectators.

In Japan, high school teams also began to appear. In the 1970s, the movement of players between Japan and the U.S. increased dramatically, along with greater exposure on Japanese television.

===Europe===
The first amateur clubs in Europe were formed in [[West Germany]] in the 1970s. The [[German Football League]]'s first [[German Bowl]] was played in 1979, with Frankfurt winning. In Europe the use of experienced players from the USA or Canada, who had to wear a large "A" on their helmets, brought quick success, but hampered the development of local talent. No more than two or three "A" players were allowed on the field, and in countries like [[Finland]], teams also had to provide a local quarterback. This helped the [[Finnish American Football Association]] win the European championships in the 1980s, over [[Great Britain]] and Germany, where US players often ran the offense in club games, but were not available for the national teams. However they could play for clubs that competed for the [[Euro Bowl]]. The [[European Federation of American Football]] was formed in 1996.

==Youth and high school football==
[[Image:Bishop Stadium (MHS).JPG|thumb|High school football stadium in [[Manhattan, Kansas]].]]

American football is a popular participatory sport among youth. One of the earliest youth football organizations was founded in Philadelphia, in 1929, as the Junior Football Conference. Organizer [[Joe Tomlin]] started the league to provide activities and guidance for teenage boys who were vandalizing the factory he owned.  The original four-team league expanded to sixteen teams in 1933 when Pop Warner, who had just been hired as the new coach of the Temple University football team, agreed to give a lecture to the boys in the league.  In his honor, the league was renamed the [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner Conference]]. <ref name=amatimeline> {{cite web | title = Amateur Football History Timeline | work = History of the Sport | publisher = USA Football Inc. | date = 2007 | url = http://www.usafootball.com/about-us/history-of-the-sport/amateur/index.php | accessdate = 2007-09-17}}</ref><ref name=popwarnerhist> {{cite web | title = Pop Warner History | publisher = popwarner.com | date = 2007 | url = http://www.popwarner.com/history/pop.asp | accessdate = 2007-09-17}}</ref>  

Today, Pop Warner Little Scholars&mdash;as the program is now known&mdash;enrolls over 300,000 young boys and girls ages 5&ndash;16 in over 5000 football and [[cheerleading]] squads, and has affiliate programs in [[Mexico]] and [[Japan]].<ref name=popwarnerhist/> Other organizations, such as the [[Police Athletic League]],<ref> {{cite web | title = National PAL's Partners | publisher = National Association of Police Athletic/Activities Leagues, Inc. | date = 2006 | url = http://www.nationalpal.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1&Itemid=26 | accessdate = 2007-09-17}}</ref> [[Upward]],<ref>{{cite web | title = Upward Programs, General Information, and Resources | publisher = Upward Unlimited | date = 20076 | url = http://www.upward.org/programs.aspx?id0=2416&id=2030 | accessdate = 2007-09-17}} </ref> and the National Football League's NFL Youth Football Program<ref>{{cite web | title = NFL Youth Football | publisher = NFL Enterprises LP | date = 2004 | url = http://www.nflyouthfootball.com/ | accessdate = 2007-09-17}}</ref> also manage various youth football leagues.

Football is a popular sport for [[high school]]s in the United States. The [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS) was founded in 1920 as an umbrella organization for [[U.S. state|state]]-level organizations that manage high school sports, including [[high school football]].  The NFHS publishes the rules followed by most local high school football associations.<ref name=amatimeline/><ref> {{cite web | title = About Us | work = National Federation of State High School Associations | publisher = National Federation of State High School Associations | date = 2004 | url = http://www.nfhs.org/web/2006/08/about_us.aspx | accessdate = 2007-08-19}} </ref> More than 13,000 high schools participate in football, and in some places high school teams play in stadiums that rival college-level facilities. In [[Denton, Texas]], for example, a 12,000 seat, $21,000,000 stadium hosts two local high school footbal teams.<ref> {{cite web | last = Wieberg | first = Steve | title = Millions of dollars pour into high school football | work = USA Today | date = 2004-10-06 | publisher = Gannett Co.

==Similar codes of football==
Other codes of football share a common history with American football.  [[Canadian football]] is a form of the game that evolved parallel to American football. While both games share a common history, there are some [[Comparison of Canadian and American football|important differences between the two]].<ref>{{cite web | title = A Brief History of Football Canada | url = http://www.footballcanada.com/history.asp | date = 2007 | publisher = Football Canada | accessdate = 2007-07-02}}</ref>  A more modern sport that derives from American football is [[Arena football]], designed to be played indoors inside of [[hockey]] or [[basketball]] arenas. The game was invented in 1981 by [[Jim Foster]] and the [[Arena Football League]] was founded in 1987 as the first major professional league to play the sport. Several other indoor football leagues have since been founded and continue to play today.<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Arena Football | publisher = HickokSports.com | date = 2006 | url = http://www.hickoksports.com/history/arenafootball.shtml | accessdate = 2007-07-02}}</ref>

American football's parent sport of rugby continued to evolve. Today, two distinct codes of rugby, known as [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]] are played. Since the [[Comparison of rugby league and rugby union|two codes split]] in 1895, the [[history of rugby league]] and the [[history of rugby union]] have evolved separately.<ref>{{cite web | last = Fagan | first = Sean | title = The Rugby Divide of 1895 | publisher = RL1895.com | url = http://www.rl1895.com/rugby-divide.htm | date = 2004 | accessdate = 2007-07-02}}</ref>
