The '''Swedish Armed Forces''' ({{lang-sv|Försvarsmakten}}), is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Government agency]] responsible for the peacetime operation of the [[armed force]]s of [[Sweden]]. The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy [[peacekeeping|peace support forces]] abroad, while maintaining the long-term ability to defend the country in the event of war. The Armed Forces is branched into [[Swedish Army|Army]], [[Swedish Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Swedish Navy|Royal Navy]]. As a Government agency, it reports to the [[Swedish Ministry of Defence]]. The head of armed forces is the [[Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces|Supreme Commander]] (''Överbefälhavaren'', ''ÖB''), beside the [[Monarch of Sweden|Sovereign]] the most senior officer in the country.

Sweden's military is built on [[conscription]], and until the end of the [[Cold War]] nearly all males reaching the age of military service were conscripted. In recent years, the number of conscripted males has been reduced dramatically, while the number of female [[volunteer]]s has increased slightly. Recruitment has generally shifted towards finding the most motivated recruits, rather than solely on the otherwise most fit for service, although there are exceptions. All soldiers serving abroad are by law required to be volunteers. In 1975 the total number of conscripts was 45,000. By 2003 it was down to 15,000. After the Defence Proposition 2004, the number of troops in training will decrease even more to between 5,000 and 10,000 each year, which emphasizes the need to recruit only the soldiers later prepared to volunteer for international service. There are also more admirals and generals in the defence force than ships and artillery pieces respectively.

As of 2006, wartime placement has been resumed, after being scrapped in 2003. At present Sweden can mobilise 59,500 men and women. This force includes 4,500 officers, 18,000 conscripts and 37,000 [[Swedish Home Guard|Homeguards]] (a voluntary [[militia]] service). But mobilisation is assumed to take one year (although no mobilisation readiness exists), and the formations assumed are of battalion level. In a couple of months, 2,700 officers and 7,000 conscripts are available, with the state militias being available within hours<ref name="hv0702no1Facts">{{cite journal|last=Ivarsson|first=Ulf|title=Pendeln måste slå tillbaka|pages=5|journal=Hemvärnet|date=February 2007|issue=1}}</ref>

Currently, one of the most important tasks for the Swedish Armed Forces is to form a Swedish-led [[European Union battle groups|EU Battle Group]] to which [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]] and [[Ireland]] will also contribute. The [[Nordic Battle Group]] (NBG) is to have a 10-day deployment readiness during the first half of [[2008]].

== Possible enemies ==
Usually, the adversary in tactical [[military exercise]]s and scenarios is thought to use equipment from the former [[Warsaw Pact]], although a specific country is never mentioned for political reasons.  Swedish equipment, training, and procedures are [[NATO]] interoperable, and most scenarios include some form of cooperation with one or more of the NATO members. Recent political decisions have strongly emphasized the will to participate in international operations, to the point where this has become the main short-term goal of training and equipment acquisition.

Historically, a common name for the enemy has been "Stormakt Röd" (Great power Red).<ref name="stormaktrod">For use of the term "Stormakt röd" in regular media, see for example  [http://www.ltz.se/artikel_standard.php?id=38319&avdelning_1=103&avdelning_2=0 this editorial].</ref>

Sweden aims to have the option of remaining [[neutral country|neutral]] in case of proximate war, and is therefore not a formal member of NATO or any other military alliance.

== Current deployments ==
Currently, Sweden has deployed military forces in the sea outside [[Lebanon]], in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kosovo]]. [[observation|Observer]]s from Sweden have been sent to a large number of countries, including [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[North Korea]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]] and [[Sri Lanka]].

== Training ==
Officers are trained in the different combat schools and also at the [[Swedish Armed Forces Military Academy]] which has establishments at [[Karlbergs Slott|Karlbergs Castle]] in [[Stockholm]], and in [[Halmstad]]. [[Conscription|Conscript]]s are trained at the different units of the three branches, the purpose of which primarily being training installations and without significant wartime importance.

== Commissioned Ranks ==
Swedish [[military rank]]s, essentially corresponds phonetically to those used by the armed forces of the [[English language|English]] speaking world. Swedish ranks correspond even more closely to those in [[German language|German]] usage due to linguistic similarities. See [[comparative military ranks]].

There are two different systems of rank for [[Officer (armed forces)|professional officers]], depending on whether one is commissioned according to the system used in the Army, or the one in the Navy. The Air Force and the Navy's Amphibious Corps use the same system as the Army.

The military introduced the rank of Brigadier General in 2001. The rank and the responsibilities associated with it existed before 2001, but all officers were commissioned as "Colonel First Class", or ''Överste av första graden'', i. e. not a General. The same goes for ''Flottiljamiral'' which used to be ''Kommendör av första graden'', or "Captain First Class". The background for this anomaly was a [[Politics of Sweden|political will]] to limit the number of Generals in the armed forces. The last [[Swedish]] [[Field Marshal]] to be appointed was [[Johan August Sandels]] in [[1824]]. Now adays the title can only be awarded during a war.
