== History ==

[[Image:Michael Dell, square crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael Dell]], the founder, chairman and CEO of Dell.]]
[[Michael Dell]], while still a student at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1984, founded the company as ''PC's Limited'' with just $1000. From Michael Dell's off-campus dorm room at [[Dobie Center]] [http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/corporate/speeches/msd/2003_05_17_msd_commencement.pdf], the startup aimed to sell [[IBM]]-compatible computers built from stock components. Michael Dell started trading in the belief that by selling personal computer systems directly to customers, PC's Limited could better understand customers' needs and provide the most effective computing solutions to meet those needs. Michael Dell dropped out of  school in order to focus full-time on his fledgling computer-[[business]]. 

In 1985 the company produced (in China) the first computer of its own design (the "Turbo PC"), which contained an [[Intel 8088]]-compatible processor running at a speed of 8&nbsp;MHz. It advertised the systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers, and custom-assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. This offered buyers prices lower than those of retail brands, but with greater convenience than assembling the components themselves. Although not the first company to use this [[business model|model]], PC's Limited became one of the first to succeed with it. The company [[gross profit|grossed]] more than $6 million in its first year.

In 1987, PC's Limited set up its first on-site-service programs in order to compensate for the lack of local retailers prepared to act as service centers. Also in 1987, the company set up its first operations in the [[United Kingdom]]; eleven more international operations followed within the next four years. In June 1988, Dell's market capitalization grew by $30 million to $80 million from its [[initial public offering]] of 3.5 million shares at $8.50 a share. The company changed its name to "Dell Computer [[Corporation]]" in 1988.

In 1990, Dell Computer Corporation tried selling its products indirectly through warehouse-clubs and computer-superstores, but met with little success, and the company re-focused on its more successful direct-to-consumer sales model. In 1992, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's [[Fortune Global 500|500]] largest companies. 

In 1996 Dell began selling computers via its web site. 

In 1999, Dell overtook [[Compaq]] to become the largest seller of [[personal computers]] in the [[United States|United States of America]] with $25 billion in revenue reported in January 2000. To recognize the company's expansion beyond computers, the stockholders approved changing the company name to "Dell Inc." at the annual company meeting in 2003. 

In March 2004 Dell attempted to expand by tapping into the multimedia and home-entertainment markets with the introduction of [[television]]s, handhelds, and [[digital audio player]]s. Dell has also produced Dell-brand printers for home and small-office use. Michael Dell stepped aside as [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) on [[July 16]], 2004, but retained his position as [[Chairman of the Board]]. [[Kevin Rollins]], who had held a number of executive posts at Dell, became the new CEO.

On [[December 22]], [[2004]], the company announced that it would build a new assembly-plant near [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]]; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million in incentives and tax breaks.

In January 2005 the share of sales coming from international markets increased, as revealed in the company's press releases for the first two quarters of its fiscal 2005 year. 

In February 2005, Dell appeared in first place in a ranking of the "Most Admired Companies" published by [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]].

In November 2005, ''BusinessWeek'' magazine published an article titled "It's Bad to Worse at Dell" about shortfalls in projected earnings and sales, with a worse-than-predicted third-quarter financial performance — a bad omen for a company that had routinely underestimated its earnings. Dell acknowledged that faulty capacitors on the [[motherboards]] of the Optiplex GX270 and GX280 had already cost the company $300 million. The CEO, Kevin Rollins, attributed the bad performance partially to Dell's focus on low-end PCs.

On [[23 March]] [[2006]], Dell purchased the computer hardware manufacturer [[Alienware]].  The plan envisioned Alienware continuing to operate independently under its existing management.  Alienware expected to benefit from Dell's efficient manufacturing system.<ref>{{cite news | first=Louise | last=Lee | title= Dell Goes High-end and Hip | date= [[March 23]], [[2006]] | publisher=BusinessWeek | url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2006/tc20060323_034268.htm }}</ref>

On [[January 31]], 2007, [[Kevin Rollins]], CEO of the company since 2004, resigned abruptly as both CEO and as a director, and Michael Dell returned to the CEO role. Investors and many shareholders had called for Rollins' resignation because of poor company performance.  At the same time, the company announced that, for the fourth time in five quarters, earnings would fail to reach consensus analyst-estimates.

As of [[February]] 2007, Dell is the subject of formal investigations by the US [[Security and Exchange Commission|SEC]] [http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9002535&source=rss_news50 ] and the US Attorney General for the Southern District of [[New York]] [http://www.theage.com.au/news/Technology/Michael-Dell-founder-and-chairman-reprises-CEO-role-at-Dell/2007/02/01/1169919438424.html], has not formally filed financial reports for either the third or fourth fiscal quarter of 2006, and is the subject of several class action lawsuits [http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=us/1-0&fp=45d1b31890fdae4c&ei=c9nRRf2MMYWKpALp5YA9&url=http%3A//thechronicleherald.ca/Business/556836.html&cid=0]  [http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8N1MLNO0.html] related to its recent financial performance.  The company's lack of formal financial disclosure would normally subject the company to delisting from the [[NASDAQ]] [http://www.crn.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=193004297], but the firm has granted Dell a waiver, allowing the stock to be traded as normal [http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/dailyarchives.jhtml?articleId=196903036].  

=== Dell and AMD ===

On [[August 17]], 2006, a Dell [http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2006/2006_08_17_rr_000?c=us&l=en&s=corp press-release] stated that starting in September 2006, Dell Dimension desktop computers would have [[AMD]] processors and that later in the year Dell would release a two-socket, multi-processor server using [[AMD]] [[Opteron]] processors, moving away from using Dell's traditional [[Intel]] processors. 

[[CNET|CNet]]'s News.com on [[August 17]], [[2006]] [http://news.com.com/Dented+Dell+picks+up+AMD+chips+amid+SEC+probe/2100-1014_3-6106905.html?tag=nl cited] Dell's CEO [[Kevin Rollins]] as attributing the move to AMD processors to cost-advantage and to AMD technology. AMD's senior VP in commercial business, Marty Seyer, stated: "Dell's wider embrace of AMD processor-based offerings is a win for Dell, for the industry and most importantly for Dell customers."

On [[October 23]], 2006, Dell announced two new AMD-based servers — the PowerEdge 6950 and the [[PowerEdge]] SC1435 — marking its entry into the AMD-based server market.

On [[November 1]], 2006 Dell's [http://news.com.com/Dell+puts+AMD-powered+notebooks+on+sale/2100-1006_3-6131558.html?tag=nefd.top website] began offering notebooks with AMD processors (the Inspiron 1501  with a 15.4" display) with the choice of a single-core MK-36 processor, dual-core Turion X2 chips or Mobile Sempron.

=== Dell and Linux ===

On [[February 26]], 2007, Dell announced that it has commenced a program that will result in the sale and distribution of a range of computers with pre-installed Linux distributions instead of Microsoft Windows. Dell has indicated that Novell's [[SuSe]] Linux will be first cab off the rank. [http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/9951/53/ cited] However, Dell on  [[February 27]], 2007, said the note was about certifying the hardware for being ready to work with Novell SUSE Linux and there are no plans that the computers would be pre-installed with Linux and sold in the near future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=linux_and_unix&articleId=9011907&taxonomyId=122&intsrc=kc_top|title=Dell to Linux users: Not so fast"|author=Computerworld|year=February 27, 2007}}</ref>

=== The Return of Michael Dell ===

As mentioned above, Michael Dell returned to the company as CEO on January 31, 2007.  It is important to note that, as chairman of the board, Mr. Dell had significant input into the company's operations during Rollins' years as CEO.  That said, once Dell returned, there were immediate changes to the company's operations, beginning with the exodus of many senior vice presidents and new blood brought in from outside the company.

Departures announced include:
* Kevin Rollins, [[CEO]] [http://www.crn.com/sections/dell/dell.jhtml?articleId=197002299]
* James Schneider, [[CFO]] [http://www.crn.com/sections/dell/dell.jhtml?articleId=197002299]

* Glenn E. Neland, senior vice president, procurement [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/17/business/17dell.html?em&ex=1171947600&en=89394cd8cc59606c&ei=5087%0A]

Additions announced include:
* Michael Dell, [[CEO]] (from chairman of board)
* Don Carty, [[CFO]] (from board member)
* Michael R. Cannon, former CEO of [[Solectron]], as president, global operations [http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/theticker/index.html]
* Ron Garriques, who formerly headed [[Motorola]]'s mobile phone unit, as president, consumer product design [http://yahoo.reuters.com/news/articlehybrid.aspx?storyID=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20070216:MTFH52950_2007-02-16_22-32-53_N16262098&type=comktNews&rpc=44]
* Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, large business consulting & integration [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/17/business/17dell.html?em&ex=1171947600&en=89394cd8cc59606c&ei=5087%0A]

Mr. Dell has announced a number of initiatives and plans (part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative) to improve the company's financial performance.  Among them:
* Elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees
* Reduce managers reporting directly to Mr. Dell from 20 to 12
* in a noted departure from previous years, "build, partner, and buy" to increase services capabilities
* reduction of "bureaucracy"
Dell's focus seems to be on reduced costs rather than innovation, in-line with the company's history of delivering units at the lowest cost possible via its direct sales model.  In an interview granted to [[Business Week]], Mr. Dell stated "[t]his is a company which can execute quite a bit better on things it already knows how to do."

== Technical information ==
=== Products ===
[[Image:DellWorkstation.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Dell-based home user workstation.]] 
==== Scope and brands ====

The corporation markets specific brand names to different [[market segment|consumer segments]]. It typically sells the OptiPlex, Latitude, and Precision names to medium-sized and large [[business]] customers, where the company's advertising emphasizes long [[technology lifecycle|life-cycles]], reliability and serviceability. The Dimension, Inspiron, and XPS brands have an orientation towards consumers, students, and [[small office/home office|small home office]] environments, emphasizing value, performance and expandability. In 2005 Dell re-introduced the [[Dell XPS]] brand to target the lucrative [[computer games|gaming]] market. XPS desktop systems use silver rather than the black cases found on newer Dell PCs. Dell has also diversified its product line to include peripheral products such as [[Keydrive|USB keydrives]], [[Liquid crystal display television|LCD televisions]], and printers.

Dell uses several brand-names for its product ranges, including: 

*[[Dell OptiPlex|OptiPlex]] for office [[desktop computer]] systems
*[[Dell Dimension|Dimension]] for consumer [[Desktop computer]] systems
* Dell N-Series - Desktop and notebook computers shipped with Linux or FreeDOS installed
*[[Dell Latitude|Latitude]] for commercially-focused [[laptop|notebook]]s
*[[Dell Inspiron|Inspiron]] for consumer [[laptop|notebook]]s
*[[Dell Precision|Precision]] for [[Computer workstation|workstation]] systems and high-performance [[laptop|notebook]]s
*[[Dell PowerEdge|PowerEdge]] for larger corporate [[Server (computing)|server]]s
*[[Dell PowerVault|PowerVault]] for direct-attach and some network-attached [[Computer storage|storage]] ([[Network-attached storage|NAS]])
*[[Dell PowerConnect]] for network switches.
*[[Dell EMC]] for [[Computer storage|storage]] area networks
*[[Dell XPS|XPS]] for enthusiast/high-performance systems
*[[Dell Axim|Axim]] for [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s utilizing [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Mobile]]
*[[Dell Digital Jukebox]] (DJ) [[MP3 Player]]s (discontinued,  [[August 18]] 2006)
*[[Dell monitors]] [[LCD]]/[[Plasma display|plasma TVs]] and [[Video projector|projectors]] for [[High definition television|HDTV]] and [[Computer display|monitor]]
*[[Dell On Call]] - extended support services (mainly for the removal of [[spyware]] and of [[computer virus|viruses]])
*[[Dell Solution Center]] - extended support services similar to Dell On Call for EMEA customers.
* Dell Gold Technical Support - a service contract (for a fee) that provides an industry-certified technician with a lower call-volume than in normal queues. Covers hardware-support, software, viruses and spyware.  Provides three levels of support:
** Core (the system itself)
** Best Effort (trying to help a customer with an email problem or software error)
** Seamless Support (conferencing a customer in via an ISP to verify settings).

Dell [[as of 2007|currently]] ships [[Microsoft]] [[Windows Vista]] as the default [[operating system]] for most of its new computers.
<ref>
http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/solutions/en/winvista?c=us&cs=&l=en&s=dhs
</ref> 
But it also offers [[Red Hat Linux|Red Hat]] and [[SUSE]] [[Linux]] for servers; as well as "bare-bones" computers without pre-installed software ([[Dell n Series|N series]] by default and [[Dell XPS|XPS]] as well as [[Dell Inspiron|Inspiron]] notebooks upon request) at significantly lower prices. Due to Dell's licensing-contract with Microsoft, Dell cannot offer those systems on their website and customers have to request them explicitly. Dell has to ship such systems with a [[FreeDOS]] disk included in the box and must issue a so-called "Windows refund" or a merchandise credit after sale of the system at the "regular" retail price.

When Dell customers elect to use Microsoft Windows as the operating system of a newly specified Dell system, Dell bundles a large quantity of software with it.

Dell has expressed willingness to offer [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s new [[Intel]] version of the [[Mac OS X]] operating system to its customers, but [[as of 2006|to this point]] Apple has stated that the OS will only run on [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] machines, and will not agree to licensing Mac OS X to Dell.<ref>http://www.pcworld.com/article/121421-1/article.html</ref>

==== Manufacturing ====
Dell has a general policy of manufacturing its products close to their customers, but with many exceptions.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Some claim that the assembly of most of their less-expensive desktop computers takes place in China.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Others say that assembly for desktop computers for the North American market takes place at Dell plants in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], [[Austin, Texas]], and [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]; with servers built in Austin, Texas. Dell, Inc. assembles computers for [[Europe]] in [[Limerick]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The company plans to open a new assembly plant at [[Chennai]] in [[India]].

Dell's assembly plants in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], and in [[China]] assemble 95% of Dell notebooks; the remaining percentage comes from Dell European Manufacturing Facilities 1, 2, and 3 in Limerick.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Dell plans to consolidate manufacturing to Malaysia and China in 2007 and has also decided to enlarge its plant in Malaysia.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} For additional quality, Dell routes these computers through 'fulfillment centers' in the United States.

==== Service Tags ====

Dell Inc associates a '''Service Tag''', a unique number, with most of its products.

Given numerous different made-to-order PCs, the company needs a way to identify systems in its database in order to provide support for them.

The service tag number, represented in [[Base 36]], has a length of five or seven characters.

As a general rule, European service tags will end with the letter J, Chinese/Japanese tags with the letter X, Indian/Middle-Eastern tags with the letter S and all others with the number 1 - though this rule does not always apply, particularly in the cases of printers, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, and televisions.

Service tags appear in the following locations:
* PCs, servers, and storage devices: On a white barcoded label on the rear of the chassis of the system.
* Notebook Computers: On a long, thin barcoded label on the underside of the notebook. 
* PDAs: Underneath the battery on the PDA itself.
* Printers: On the rear of the printer on a barcoded label.
* LCD and plasma televisions: On the rear of the set.

Dell Inc does not tag its monitors. Monitors bought as part of a system get support via the tag of the system itself. Monitors bought separately get support via the Dell Order Number or the monitor's [[serial number]].

== Dellconnect==
The ''DellConnect'' program includes a remote-access tool that gives Dell Support technicians the ability to remotely access computers for troubleshooting purposes. Utilizing this tool, support technicians can analyze the configuration of one's system, view and edit its files and registry, view and comment on one's screen, or take control of one's system for troubleshooting purposes.

The tool has a server component (downloaded from [http://remote.dellfix.com remote.dellfix.com]) and client software (installed on the systems of the Dell technicians). Dell staff use it to remotely access systems and to help resolve the issues of customers

== Commercial aspects ==
=== Business model ===

Dell sells all its products both to end-use consumers and to corporate customers, using a direct-sales model via the [[Internet]] and the [[telephone]] network.  Dell maintains a negative [[cash conversion cycle]] through use of this model: in other words, Dell Inc. receives payment for the products before it has to pay for the materials. Dell also practices [[Just In Time|just-in-time]] (JIT) inventory management, profiting from its attendant benefits. Dell’s JIT approach utilizes the “pull” system by building computers only after customers place orders and by requesting materials from suppliers as needed. In this way Dell mirrors [[Toyota]] by following Toyota Way Principle #3 ("Use 'pull' systems to avoid overproduction"). Since the original dominance of telephone ordering, the Internet has significantly enhanced Dell’s business model, making it easier for customers and potential customers to contact Dell directly. Other computer manufacturers, including [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]], have attempted to adapt this same business model, but due to timing and/or retail-channel pressures they have not achieved the same results as Dell.

=== Organization ===

A [[Board of Directors]] of nine people runs the company. [[Michael Dell]], the founder of the company, serves on the board. Other board members include [[Donald J. Carty|Don Carty]], [[William Gary]], [[Judy Lewent]], [[Klaus Luft]], [[Alex Mandl]], [[Michael A. Miles]], and [[Sam Nunn]]. [[Shareholder]]s elect the nine board members at [[meeting]]s, and those board members who do not get a majority of votes must submit a [[resignation]] to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation. The board of directors usually sets up five committees which have oversight over specific matters. These committees include the ''Audit Committee'', which handles accounting issues, including auditing and reporting; the ''Compensation Committee'', which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the ''Finance Committee'', which handles [[financial]] matters such as proposing mergers and acquisitions; the ''Governance and Nominating Committee'', which handles various corporate matters including nomination of the board; and the ''Antitrust Compliance Committee'', which attempts to prevent company practices from violating [[antitrust]] laws.

The corporate structure and management of Dell extends beyond the board of directors. The ''Dell Global Executive Management Committee'' sets the strategic direction for how the corporation keeps customers at the forefront, from designing and manufacturing computer systems to offering products that meet customers' requirements to providing the sufficient service and support. Dell has regional senior vice presidents for countries other than the United States, including Paul Bell for [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] and Stephen J. Felice for [[Asia]]/[[Japan]]. Other officers include Martin Garvin (senior vice president for worldwide procurement) and [[Susan Sheskey|Susan E. Sheskey]] (vice president and [[chief information officer]]).

==== Support ====

Dell Inc routes technical support queries according to component-type and to the level of support purchased with a unit. Currently Dell offers four levels of customer [http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/services/en/ess_comparisonchart?c=us&cs=555&l=en&s=biz support]and encourages customers to educate themselves on the differences between these service types.

Dell Inc brands its [[As of 2006|current]] service agreements at four levels: 
# Basic
# Silver
# Gold
# Platinum Plus.

A primary criticism of Dell's customer-support states that, because of the variety in service types available, the Dell system sometimes transfers customer calls several times between queues before they reach the appropriate department.

Though the service-agreements between Dell and its customers on the higher-level support agreements (Silver, Gold, and Platinum Plus) do not specifically state the guarantee of American-agent technical support, Dell has opened up several new [http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2004/2004_10_29_rr_000?c=us&l=en&s=corp call-centers] in the United States and Canada to begin handling enterprise-class technical support requests. 

According to the Better Business Bureau however, complaints about Dell more than [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060223_710372.htm?chan=search doubled]in 2005, to 1,533.

In the Americas, Dell has [http://www1.ca.dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/ca/corporate/pressoffice/en/2005/2005_12_09_ott_000?c=ca&l=en&s=corp customer-contact centers] in Ottawa, Ontario; Central Texas; Middle Tennessee; Chesapeake; Roseburg, Ore; Twin Falls, Idaho; Oklahoma City, Okla; San Salvador, El Salvador; as well as Glace Bay, Nova Scotia and Panama City, Panama.

In the Asia-Pacific region, Dell provides customer support from Pasay City, Philippines; Penang, Malaysia; and Xiamen and Dalian, China. Dell plans to open a [http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2006/2006_08_31_mnl_000?c=us&l=en&s=corp second Philippine site] in Quezon City in early 2007.

In India, Dell has customer support centers in the northern cities of Gurgaon and Mohali; and in the southern cities of Hyderabad and Bangalore[http://ipcommunications.tmcnet.com/news/2006/10/06/212847.htm].

=== Marketing ===

[[Image:LOGODELL.gif|thumb|170px|right|Nameplate used on the bezels of many Dell computers, monitors, and printers]]

Dell [[advertisement]]s have appeared in several types of media including [[television]], the [[Internet]], [[magazines]], [[Mail-order catalog|catalogs]] and [[newspapers]]. Some of Dell Inc's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, offering free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and offering free shipping in order to encourage more sales and to stave off competitors. In 2006, Dell [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060223_710372.htm?chan=search cut its prices] in an effort to maintain its 19.2% market share. However, this also cut profit-margins by more than half, from 8.7 to 4.3 percent. To maintain its low prices, Dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the [[Internet]] and through the telephone network, and to move its customer-care division to [[India]] and [[El Salvador]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor [[Ben Curtis (actor)|Ben Curtis]] playing the part of "Steven," a lightly mischievous blond-haired kid who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "''Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!''" Dell fired Curtis shortly after his arrest for [[marijuana]] possession in 2003 on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]]; however, Dell denies that the firing resulted from his arrest, stating that the "Steven" ads had run for three years and characterizing them as "stale". The Dell ads featuring Curtis had stopped playing before his arrest, thus lending credence to Dell's statement. <ref>http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/delldude.asp</ref>

[[Image:Chermside dell kiosk.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Dell Direct Store, Brisbane, Australia]]
A subsequent advertising campaign featured [[intern]]s at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).

In the early 2000s, Dell opened [[kiosk]] locations in [[shopping mall]]s across the United States in order to give personal service to customers who preferred this channel to using the Internet or telephones. Despite the added expense, prices at the kiosks equalled or even undercut prices available on Dell's other retail channels. During 2005, Dell opened [[kiosk]] locations in [[shopping malls]] across [http://www.dell.com.au/delldirectstore Australia], and in 2006 opened [[kiosk]] locations in [[shopping malls]] across [http://www.dell.ca/delldirectstore Canada], following the approach used in the United States. 

A Dell advertising campaign for the XPS line of gaming computers featured in print in the September 2006 issue of [[Wired Magazine]].  It used as a [[tagline]] the common term in [[Internet]] and [[gamer]] slang: "[[FTW]]", meaning "For The Win".  However, Dell Inc. soon dropped the campaign.

==== Dell Stores ====

On [[July 26]], [[2006]], Dell Inc. opened a full store in Northpark Mall in [[Dallas, Texas]]. It planned to operate the 3,000-square-foot Dallas outlet  seven days a week and to display about 36 models, including PCs and televisions. But customers cannot walk out of this store with products. Instead, they order online or by telephone from the store and await delivery.  Dell Inc plans to use the Dallas store to house about three times as many products as it displays in more than 160 kiosks in malls and airports in the [[United States of America]]. In addition to showcasing products, the store also supports onsite warranties or non warranty service ("Dell on Call").  Services offered include repairing computer video-cards and removing spyware from harddrives.

=== Competition === 

Dell's major competitors include [[Apple Computer|Apple]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Lenovo]], [[Sony]], and [[Toshiba]]. Dell and its subsidiary, [[Alienware]], compete in the enthusiast market against [[Falcon Northwest]], [[Voodoo PC]] (a division of [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]), and other manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2006, Dell had between 18% and 19% share of the worldwide personal-computer [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/07/19/pc_market_called_healthy_despite_weak_demand_in_europe market], compared to Hewlett-Packard with roughly 15%. By leveraging its business-model, Dell attempts to undercut competitors and offer customers a more attractive choice of personal computers and other equipment. 

Dell [[as of 2006|recently]] lost its once-substantial lead in the PC business to [[Hewlett-Packard]].  Both [[Gartner]] and [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] estimated that in the third quarter of 2006, HP shipped [http://www.forbes.com/2006/10/19/dell-computer-earnings-markets-equity-cx_mk_1019markets07.html?partner=yahootix more units] world-wide than did Dell.  Dell's 3.6% growth paled in comparison to HP's 15% growth during the same period.  The problem worsened in the fourth quarter, when Gartner [http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070117006106&newsLang=en estimated] that Dell PC shipments declined 8.9% (versus HP's 23.9% growth).  As a result, at the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market share stood at 13.9% (versus HP's 17.4%).

== Criticism ==

In October 2005, Dell filed a lawsuit in a Paris court to sue [[Minorca|Menorca]]-based independent website designer Paul Dell [http://www.dellimages.com "Dellimages".] for engaging in “parasitism and unfair competition”. This related to his company website [http://www.dellwebsites.com "DellWebsites".]

Critics of Dell have seen Dell Inc. as "hounding" Paul Dell without justification, considering that the title of his enterprise merely reflects his [[family name]].

</ref> 
Friends and fellow web-designers have since started a 'Help Paul Dell' campaign.

The case continues.
 
In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service, including [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2006/tc20060612_046085.htm transfers] of more than 45% of calls and long wait-times.  [http://www.direct2dell.com Dell's blog] detailed the [http://www.direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/07/13/433.aspx response]: "We’re spending more than a $100 million — and a lot of blood, sweat and tears of talented people — to fix this."  Later in the year, the company increased its [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/09/18/8386121/index.htm spending] on  customer service to $150 million. 

On [[August 14]], [[2006]], Dell and [[Sony]] [http://www.thestreet.com/newsanalysis/techhardware/10312018.html recalled] over 4.2 million notebook batteries after the discovery of flaws that could cause the [[Sony]]-manufactured batteries to overheat and catch fire. Subsequent announcements by almost every major laptop manufacturer in the world (including Apple, Lenovo, Toshiba, Hitachi and Fujitsu) led to a recall of nearly 9.6 million Sony-manufactured batteries and led Sony executives to [http://www.cio-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=12000CANL8TC apologize] on [[October 24]], [[2006]] for the inconvenience.

=== North Carolina Controversy ===
In [[2005]] Dell began the construction of a facility in [[Winston-Salem,_North_Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]]. <ref>http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Oct_25/ai_n15732802</ref> This was met with many claims that Dell had used unfair practices to obtain tax revenue. <ref>http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/23/dell_nc_suit</ref> Dell fought a lawsuit which was later dismissed. <ref>http://www.newsobserver.com/104/story/438280.html</ref>

===2007 Investor Lawsuit===
On [[January 31]] some shareholders filed a [http://www.betanews.com/article/Inside_the_Dell_Shareholder_Lawsuit_Did_Dell_and_Intel_Conspire/1170465943 lawsuit] accusing Dell and Intel of conspiring, and accusing Dell executives, including Michael Dell, of options-[[backdating]] and of propped [[financial report]]s.

===2007 Call Center Overtime Lawsuit===
On [[February 8]] seven past and former workers at a call center in [[Roseburg,_OR|Roseburg]], [[Oregon]] sued the computer maker, saying the company worked its sales reps "off the clock," failed to provide proper rest breaks and improperly recorded their lunch periods.  <ref>http://atwork.blogs.oregonlive.com/uploads/487501-dellsuit.pdf</ref>  Class action status is being sought in this case.
