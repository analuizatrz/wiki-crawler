[[Image:US Naval Jack.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Image:FIAV 000010.svg|23x15px]] Union Jack. Used as naval jack, 1960&ndash;2002.]]

The '''[[flag]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]''' consists of 13 equal horizontal stripes of [[red]] (top and bottom) alternating with [[white]], with a [[blue]] rectangle in the [[Flag terminology|canton]] bearing 50 small, white, [[Star (symbol)|five-pointed star]]s arranged in nine offset horizontal rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternating with rows of five stars.  The 50 stars on the flag represent the [[U.S. state|50 U.S. states]] and the 13 stripes represent the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] that rebelled against the [[British monarchy|British crown]] and became the first states in the Union.<ref>States are represented collectively; there is no meaning to particular stars nor stripes.</ref> Nicknames for the flag include "'''the Stars and Stripes'''", "'''Old Glory'''",<ref>Coined by Captain [[William Driver]], a nineteenth century shipmaster.</ref> and "'''the Star-Spangled Banner'''" (also the name of the country's [[The Star-Spangled Banner|official national anthem]]).

Because of its symbolism, the starred blue canton is called the "union".  This part of the national flag can stand alone as a [[maritime flag]] called the '''Union Jack'''<ref>No relation to the [[Union Flag|Union Flag of the United Kingdom]] to which this term more commonly refers.</ref> which served as the [[Jack of the United States|U.S. jack]] on warships from 1777 until 2002.  It continues to be used as a jack by various federally-owned vessels, including those of the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], [[Military Sealift Command]], and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].

Though its design is similar to the flag of the [[Honourable East India Company|British East India Company]], no substantive connection has been established.

== Symbolism ==
The United States flag is one of the nation's widely recognized and used symbols. Within the U.S. it is frequently displayed, not only on public buildings, but on private residences, as well as iconically in forms such as decals for car windows, and clothing ornaments such as badges and lapel pins.  Throughout the world it is used in public discourse to refer to the U.S., both as a nation state, government, and set of policies, but also as an ideology and set of ideals.

Many understand the flag to represent the freedoms and rights guaranteed in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and its [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and perhaps most of all to be a symbol of individual and personal liberty as set forth in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].  Through the [[Pledge of Allegiance]] and other political uses the flag has also come to be associated with U.S. [[nationalism]], [[patriotism]], and even [[militarism]].  The flag is a complex and contentious symbol, around which emotions run high.

In terms of the symbolism of the design itself, a book about the flag published by the Congress in 1977 states:
"The star is a symbol of the heavens and the divine goal to which man has aspired from time immemorial; the stripe is symbolic of the rays of light emanating from the sun."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.usflag.org/colors.html| title=What do the colors of the Flag mean?| work=USFlag.org: A website dedicated to the Flag of the United States of America| accessdate=June 14| accessyear=2005}}</ref>
[[George Washington]] is credited for saying:
"We take the stars from Heaven, the red from our [[Kingdom of Great Britain|mother country]], separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her, and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing Liberty."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www1.va.gov/opa/feature/celebrate/Flag.asp| title=The United States Flag - Public and Intergovernmental Affairs| work=United States Department of Veterans Affairs| accessdate=December 7| accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Many people also take the red and white to stand for the blood of those who gave their lives for freedom, and the presumed purity of the freedom ideal, respectively.

===Specification===
[[Image:Flag of the United States specification.svg|400px|right|Diagram of the flag's design]]

The design of the flag is specified by sections 1<ref>[http://assembler.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode04/usc_sec_04_00000001----000-notes.html Title 4 Chapter 1 Section 1 Notes] from [http://assembler.law.cornell.edu/uscode/ Cornell Law School U.S. Code Collection].</ref> and 2<ref>[http://assembler.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode04/usc_sec_04_00000002----000-.html Title 4 Chapter 1 Section 2] from [http://assembler.law.cornell.edu/uscode/ Cornell Law School U.S. Code Collection].</ref> of Title 4, [[United States Code]] ([[4 U.S.C.]] §§ 1, 2 (2004)).  The specification gives the following values:

* Hoist (width) of the flag: A = 1.0
* Fly (length) of the flag: B = 1.9 <!--please do not round this up to 2.0 and see below-->
* Hoist (width) of the Union: C = 0.5385 (A x 7/13, spanning seven stripes)
* Fly (length) of the Union: D = 0.76 (B × 2/5, two fifths of the flag length)
* E = F = 0.0538 (C/10, One tenth the width of the Union)
* G = H = 0.0633 (D/12, One twelfth the length of the Union)
* Diameter of star: K = 0.0616
* Width of stripe: L = 0.0769 (A/13, One thirteenth of the flag width)

=== Flag ratios ===

Note that the flag ratio (B in the diagram) is not absolutely fixed.  Although the diagram in Executive Order 10834 gives a ratio of 1.9, earlier in the order is a list of flag sizes authorized for executive agencies. This list permits eleven specific flag sizes (specified by height and width) for such agencies: 20.00 × 38.00; 10.00 × 19.00; 8.95 × 17.00; 7.00 × 11.00; 5.00 × 9.50; 4.33 × 5.50; 3.50 × 6.65; 3.00 × 4.00; 3.00 × 5.70; 2.37 × 4.50; and 1.32 × 2.50. Eight of these sizes conform to the 1.9 ratio, within a small rounding error (less than 0.01). However, three of the authorized sizes vary significantly: 1.57 (for 7.00 × 11.00), 1.27 (for 4.33 × 5.50) and 1.33 (for 3.00 × 4.00).

=== Colors ===

According to [[Flags of the World]], the colors are specified by the [[General Services Administration]] "Federal Specification, Flag, National, United States of America and Flag, Union Jack," DDD-F-416E, dated [[November 27]], [[1981]]. It gives the colors by reference to "Standard Color Cards of America" maintained by [[The Color Association of the United States]], Inc., as:

According to the book "Our Flag," published by the House of Representatives, "The colors red, white, and blue did not have meanings for The Stars and Stripes when it was adopted in 1777." It goes on to say, on page 41 (page 47 of the PDF version)<ref>{{cite book| author=United States Government| title=Our Flag| publisher=United States Government Printing Office| location=Washington DC| year=1861| format=PDF| id=S. Doc 105-013| url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_documents&docid=f:sd013.105.pdf}}</ref> that the colors of the [[Great Seal of the United States]], when it was adopted in 1782, were defined thus: "White signifies Purity and Innocence; Red, Hardiness and Valor; Blue signifies Vigilance, Perseverance and Justice."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/06/20010607-1.html| title=A Proclamation by the President: Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2001| work=The White House| accessdate=December 7| accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Design of the union===
When [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]] were being considered for statehood, more than 1,500 designs were spontaneously submitted to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] by Americans. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three, and probably more, of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag. These designs are in the [[Eisenhower Presidential Center|Eisenhower Presidential Archives]] in [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], [[Kansas]]. Only a small fraction of them have ever been published.

One legend states the union of the current 50-star flag was designed by [[Robert G. Heft]] in 1958 while living with his grandparents in [[Ohio]]. He was 18 years old at the time and did the flag design as a class project.  His mother was a seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally received a B- for the project.  After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered.  Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the union in 1959.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.usflag.org/flagdesigner.html| title=Robert G. Heft: Designer of America's Current National Flag| work=USFlag.org: A website dedicated to the Flag of the United States of America| accessdate=December 7| accessyear=2006}}</ref>

At the time, credit was given by the [[Executive Department]] to the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|U.S. Army Bureau of Heraldry]] for the design.

=== Decoration ===

Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with [[Gold (color)|golden]] [[fringe]] surrounding the perimeter of the flag itself as long as it does not deface the flag proper.  Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in [[parade]]s or on indoor posts, often utilize fringe to enhance the beauty of the flag.  The first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the [[United States Army|Army]] used it officially in 1895.  No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] addresses the use of fringe (and the number of stars)"...is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy...".(as quoted from footnote in previous volumns of Title 4 USC Law books and is a source for claims that such a flag is a military ensign not civilian).   The [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]], which has official custody of the flag designs, and makes any such change ordered, also confirms that there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/FAQ/FringeOnAmFlg.htm| title=Fringe on the American Flag| accessdate=June 27| accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Flag etiquette==
{{main|United States Flag Code}}
The [[United States Flag Code]] outlines certain guidelines for the use, display, and disposal of the flag.  For example, the flag should never be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the [[ensign]] responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. (This tradition comes from the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]], where countries were asked to dip their flag to [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]: the American team captain [[Martin Sheridan]] refused, famously proclaiming that "this flag dips to no earthly king."<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/06/24/olympics_history_feature.shtml London Olympics 1908 & 1948]</ref>).  The flag should never be allowed to touch the ground and, if flown at night, must be illuminated.  If the edges become tattered through wear, the flag should be repaired or replaced. {{Fact|date=November 2007}}

Although the Flag Code is U.S. Federal law, there is no penalty for failure to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforced—indeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with the [[First Amendment]] right to [[freedom of speech]].  Passage of the proposed [[Flag Desecration Amendment]] would overrule legal precedent that has been established in this area.

===Folding the flag===
[[Image:fold-us-flag-animated.gif|thumb|frame|right|Folding the U.S. flag]]
Though not part of the official Flag Code, according to military custom flags should be folded into a triangular shape when not in use.  (The [[Philippines]], a [[Overseas expansion of the United States|former American territory]], also has this custom for folding its flag.)  To properly fold the flag:

#Begin by holding it waist-high with another person so that its surface is parallel to the ground.
#Fold the lower half of the stripe section lengthwise over the field of stars, holding the bottom and top edges securely.
#Fold the flag again lengthwise with the blue field on the outside.
#Make a rectangular fold then a triangular fold by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open top edge of the flag. Starting the fold from the left side over to the right
#Turn the outer end point inward, parallel to the open edge, to form a second triangle.
#The triangular folding is continued until the entire length of the flag is folded in this manner (usually thirteen triangular folds, as shown at right). On the final fold, any remnant that does not neatly fold into a triangle (or in the case of exactly even folds, the last triangle) is tucked into the previous fold.
#When the flag is completely folded, only a triangular blue field of stars should be visible.

== Display ==
The flag is customarily flown year-round at most public buildings, and it is not unusual to find private houses flying full-size flags.
Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like [[Memorial Day]], [[Veterans Day]], [[Presidents' Day (United States)|Presidents' Day]], [[Flag Day in the United States|Flag Day]], and on [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]]. On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U.S. war veterans.   

===Places of continuous display===
[[Image:Apollo 14 Shepard.jpg|right|thumb|Astronaut [[Alan Shepard]] raises the United States Flag on the surface of the [[moon]] during the [[Apollo 14]] mission.]]

By presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, American flags are displayed continuously at certain locations.

* Replicas of the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]] (15 stars, 15 stripes) are flown at two sites in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]: [[Fort McHenry|Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine]] (Presidential Proclamation No. 2795, [[July 2]], [[1948]]) and [[Flag House Square]] (Public Law 83-319, approved [[March 26]], [[1954]]).
* [[USMC War Memorial|United States Marine Corps War Memorial]] ([[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]), [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]] (Presidential Proclamation No. 3418, [[June 12]], [[1961]]).
* [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], [[Massachusetts]] Town Green (Public Law 89-335, approved [[November 8]], [[1965]]).
* The [[White House]], [[Washington, DC]] (Presidential Proclamation No. 4000, [[September 4]], [[1970]]).
* Fifty U.S. Flags are displayed continuously at the [[Washington Monument]], Washington, DC. (Presidential Proclamation No. 4064, [[July 6]], [[1971]], effective [[July 4]], [[1971]]).
* By order of [[Richard Nixon]] at [[United States Customs Service]] Ports of Entry that are continuously open (Presidential Proclamation No. 4131, [[May 5]], [[1972]]).
* By Congressional decree, a Civil War era flag (for the year 1863) flies above Pennsylvania Hall (Old Dorm) at [[Gettysburg College]].  This building, occupied by both sides at various points of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], served as a lookout and battlefield hospital.
* Grounds of the National Memorial Arch in [[Valley Forge National Historical Park|Valley Forge NHP]], [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania|Valley Forge]], [[Pennsylvania]] (Public Law 94-53, approved [[July 4]], [[1975]]).
* Mount Slover limestone quarry ([[Colton Liberty Flag]]), in [[Colton, California|Colton]], [[California]] (Act of Congress). First raised [[July 4]], [[1917]].<ref>[http://www.calportland.com/coltons-libertyflag.htm]</ref>
* Washington Camp Ground, part of the former [[Middlebrook encampment]], [[Bridgewater, New Jersey|Bridgewater]], [[New Jersey]], Thirteen Star Flag, by Act of Congress.
* By custom, at the [[Maryland]] home, birthplace, and grave of [[Francis Scott Key]]; at the [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Massachusetts]] war memorial; at the [[Taos Plaza|plaza]] in [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], [[New Mexico]] (since 1861); at the [[United States Capitol]] (since 1918); and at [[Mount Moriah Cemetery (South Dakota)|Mount Moriah Cemetery]] in [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[South Dakota]].
* In addition, the American flag is on continual display on the surface of the Earth's [[The Moon|Moon]], having been placed there by the astronauts of [[Apollo 11]], [[Apollo 12]], [[Apollo 14]], [[Apollo 15]], [[Apollo 16]], and [[Apollo 17]]. It is possible that Apollo 11's flag was knocked down by the exhaust force of liftoff for return to lunar orbit.

===Particular days of display===
The flag should especially be displayed at full staff on the following days:

*[[January 1]]  -  [[New Year's Day]]
*[[January 20]]  -  Inauguration Day
*[[February 12]]  -  [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s Birthday
*Third Monday in February  -  [[President's Day]], originally [[George Washington|Washington]]'s birthday
*Third Saturday in May  -  Armed Forces Day
*Last Monday in May - [[Memorial Day]] (half-staff until noon)
*[[June 14]]  -  Flag Day
*[[July 4]]  -  Independence Day
*First Monday in September  -  [[Labor Day]]
*[[September 17]]  -  [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] Day
*Second Monday in October  -  [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] Day
*[[October 27]]  -  Navy Day
*[[November 11]]  -  Veterans Day
*Fourth Thursday in November - [[Thanksgiving Day]]
*and such other days as may be proclaimed by the [[President of the United States]]; the birthdays of States (date of admission); and on State holidays.

===Displaying the flag at half staff===
The US Flag is displayed at half staff as a sign of respect or mourning.  Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president of the United States; state-wide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] issued the first proclamation on [[March 1]], [[1954]] standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.

To properly fly the US flag at half staff, the protocol is to first hoist it briskly to full staff, then reverently (slowly) lower it to half-staff.  Similarly, when the flag is to be lowered from half staff, it should be first hoisted briskly to full staff, then lowered reverently to the base of the flagpole.

Federal guidelines state the flag should be flown at half staff at the following dates/times:
*May 15 - [[Peace Officers Memorial Day]]
*Last Monday in May - [[Memorial Day]] (until noon)
*July 27 - Korean War Veterans Day
*[[9/11|September 11]] - [[Patriot Day]]<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050909-12.html]</ref>
*December 7 - Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day
*For 30 days - Death of a US President or former President
*For 10 days - Death of a US Vice President, Supreme Court Chief Justice/retired Chief Justice, or Speaker of the House of Representatives.
*From death until the day of interment - US Supreme Court Associate Justice, member of the Cabinet, former Vice President, President pro-tempore of the Senate, or the majority and minority leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives.  Also for federal facilities within a state or territory, for the governor.
*On the day after the death - US Senators, Members of Congress, territorial delegates or the resident commissioner of the commonwealth of Puerto Rico

== History ==
{{Mergefrom|Timeline of the Flag of the United States|date=March 2007}}
The flag has been changed 26 times since the new, 13-state union adopted it. The 48-star version went unchanged for 47 years, the longest time the flag went unmodified until [[July 4]], [[2007]], when the current 50-star flag broke the record.

=== First flag ===
[[Image:Grand Union Flag.svg|210x111px|thumb|right|[[Image:FIAV historical.svg|23x15px]] Grand Union Flag ("Continental Colors").]]
[[Image:Flag of the British East India Company (1707).svg|210x111px|right|thumb|Flag of the British East India Company, 1707&ndash;1801]]
At the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, [[July 4]], [[1776]], the United States had no official national flag. The [[Grand Union Flag]] has historically been referred to as the "First National Flag"; although it has never had any official status it was used throughout the [[American Revolutionary War]] by [[George Washington]] and formed the basis for the design of the first official US flag.

This flag is properly considered the ''de facto'' first [[Ensign of the United States|naval ensign of the United States]].  It was first raised aboard Continental Navy Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]]' flagship ''Alfred'' on the [[Delaware River]] on [[December 3]], [[1775]],<ref name=leepson>Leepson, Marc. (2005). ''Flag: An American Biography.'' New York: St. Martin's Press.  p. 16.</ref> possibly (according to his claim) by the ship's senior lieutenant [[John Paul Jones]].

The origins of the design are unclear.  It closely resembles the [[British East India Company]] (BEIC) flag of the same era, and an argument dating to Sir [[Charles Fawcett]] in 1937 holds that the BEIC flag indeed inspired the design.<ref>{{FOTW|id=gb-eic2|title=The STRIPED FLAG of the EAST INDIA COMPANY, and its CONNEXION with the AMERICAN "STARS and STRIPES"}}</ref>  However, the BEIC flag could have from 9 to 13 stripes, and was not allowed to be flown outside the Indian Ocean.<ref>{{FOTW|id=gb-eic|title=East India Company (United Kingdom)}}</ref>  Both flags could have been easily constructed by adding white stripes to a British [[Red Ensign]], a common flag throughout Britain and its colonies.
[[Image:COA George Washington.svg|94x111px|left|thumb|[[Coat of arms of George Washington]].]]
Another theory holds that the red-and-white stripe—and later, stars-and-stripes—motif of the flag may have been based {{Fact|date=February 2007}} on the Washington family [[coat of arms|coat-of-arms]], which consisted of a shield "''argent'', two ''bars gules'', above, three ''mullets gules''" (a white shield with two red bars below three red stars). 

More likely it was based on a flag of the [[Sons of Liberty]], one of which consisted of 13 red and white alternating horizontal stripes.

=== The Flag Resolution of 1777 ===
[[Image:US flag 13 stars – Betsy Ross.svg|210x111px|right|thumb|[[Image:FIAV historical.svg|23x15px]] 13-star "Betsy Ross" flag<br/>(original had all stars pointed outward, not upward)]]
On [[June 14]], [[1777]], the [[Continental Congress#The Second Continental Congress|Second Continental Congress]] passed the Flag Resolution which stated: "Resolved, That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation."  [[Flag Day in the United States|Flag Day]] is now observed on June 14 of each year. A false tradition holds that the new flag was first hoisted in June of 1777 by the [[Continental Army]] at the [[Middlebrook encampment]].<ref>Guenter (1990)</ref>

The Flag Resolution did not specify any particular arrangement for the stars. The pictured flag shows the thirteen stars arranged in a circle, the so-called [[Betsy Ross flag]]. Although the Betsy Ross legend is not taken seriously by many historians, the design itself is the oldest version of any US flag to appear on any physical relic{{Fact|date=October 2007}}: it is historically referenced in contemporary battlefield paintings by John Trumbull and Charles Willson Peale, which depict the circular star arrangement. Popular designs at the time were varied and most were individually crafted rather than mass-produced. Given the scant archaeological and written evidence, it is unknown which design was the most popular at that time.

The origin of the stars and stripes design is uncertain. A popular story credits [[Betsy Ross]] for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch by George Washington who personally commissioned her for the job.  However, no evidence for this theory exists beyond Ross' descendants' much later recollections of what she told her family.  Another woman, Rebecca Young, has also been credited as having made the first flag by later generations of her family. Rebecca Young's daughter was Mary Pickersgill, who made the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]]. Another popular theory is that the flag was designed by [[Francis Hopkinson]]. Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a bill to Congress for his work. He asked for a "Quarter Cask of the Public Wine" as payment initially. The payment was not made, however, because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress, and he was not the only person to have contributed to the design. It should be noted that no one else contested his claim at the time.

==== Later flag acts ====

[[Image:US flag 48 stars.svg|210x111px|thumb|right|[[Image:FIAV historical.svg|23x15px]] 48-star flag, is the second longest in use (1912&ndash;1959).]]
[[Image:Amflagurban.jpg|210x111px|right|thumb|An [[urban area|Urban]] [[Military camouflage|camouflaged]] American [[flag patch]], as used by the [[Military of the United States|U.S. Military]].]]
{{see also|Flag Acts (U.S.)}}
In 1795, the number of stars and stripes was increased from 13 to 15 (to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky as states of the union). For a time the flag was not changed when subsequent states were admitted, probably because it was thought that this would cause too much clutter.  It was the 15-star, 15-stripe flag that inspired [[Francis Scott Key]] to write "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]," now the [[national anthem]].  

On [[April 4]], [[1818]], a plan was passed by Congress at the suggestion of U.S. Naval Captain Samuel C. Reid<ref>{{cite book| author=United States Government| title=Our Flag| publisher=United States Government Printing Office| location=Washington DC| year=1861| format=PDF| id=S. Doc 105-013| url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_documents&docid=f:sd013.105.pdf}}</ref> in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would remain at thirteen to honor the [[Thirteen Colonies|original colonies]].  The act specified that new flag designs should become official on the first [[July 4]] ([[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]]) following admission of one or more new states. The most recent change, from 49 stars to 50, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after [[Hawaii]] gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of [[Alaska]] in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star flag.

As of [[July 4]], [[2007]], the 50-star flag has become the longest rendition in use.

=== First salute ===
[[The Netherlands]] was the first country to salute the Grand Union flag, when [[Salute#Heavy Arms: Gun Salutes|gun salutes]] by American ships were returned by officials on Dutch islands in the [[West Indies]] in late 1776: on [[St. Croix]] in October, and on [[Sint Eustatius|St. Eustatius]] in November. (Though later, the better documented St. Eustatius incident involving the [[USS Andrew Doria (1775)|USS ''Andrew Doria'']] is traditionally regarded as the "first salute".) [[France]] was the first country to salute the Stars and Stripes, when a fleet off the French mainland returned a gun salute by Captain [[John Paul Jones]] commanding the [[USS Ranger (1777)|USS ''Ranger'']] on [[February 14]], [[1778]].

=== Historical progression of designs ===
In the following table depicting the 27 various designs of the United States flag, the star patterns for the flags are merely the ''usual'' patterns, often associated with the [[United States Navy]].  Canton designs, prior to the proclamation of the 48-star flag by President [[William Howard Taft]] on [[29 October]] [[1912]], had no official arrangement of the stars.  Furthermore, the exact ''colors'' of the flag were not standardized until 1934<ref>(For alternate versions of the flag of the United States, see the [http://www.fotw.net/flags/us-ststr.html Stars of the U.S. Flag page] at the [[Flags of the World]] website.)

== Future of the flag ==
[[Image:US flag 51 stars.svg|thumb|right|[[Image:FIAV proposal.svg|23x15px]] Proposed design for a [[United States 51-star flag|51-star flag]] in the event of an additional state]]
{{seealso|51st state}}

The [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] has plans for flags with up to 56 stars, using a similar staggered star arrangement should additional states accede. Moreover, there are continuing political movements supporting statehood in [[Puerto Rico]] and [[District of Columbia voting rights|the District of Columbia]].

==Non-standard flags==
[[Image:Guilford Court House flag.JPG|thumb|left |[[Guilford_Courthouse_flag|Guilford Court House Flag]] ]]
A number of non-standard flags appeared in the early years of American independence. One example is the design approximated here, of a flag traditionally believed to have been carried by the American troops at the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]] in 1781. This is disputed by some other historians who think it dates to the nineteenth century. The original flag is at the North Carolina Historical Museum.

== Similar flags ==
{{seealso|Flags of the United States#Flags with similar designs}}
The [[flag of Liberia]] bears a close resemblance, showing the ex–American-slave origin of the country. The Liberian flag has similar red and white stripes, though only 11 of them, as well as a blue square for the union, but with only a single large white star.

The [[flag of Malaysia]] also has a striking resemblance, with red and white stripes (14 total), and a blue canton, but displaying instead of stars a [[star and crescent]] emblem.

Though more dissimilar in appearance, the [[flag of Cuba]] was also inspired by the flag of the United States.Its origins date from 1849, when Cuban liberation movements emerged among Cuban exiles in the U.S.<ref>{{FOTW|id=cu|title=Cuba}}</ref>

Another flag similar to the flag of the United States is the [[flag of Puerto Rico]]. There are specific shades of red and blue for the construction of the flag, however there might be slight variations depending on the flag-flyer's [[Politics of Puerto Rico|political beliefs]]. The pro-[[independence]] groups use [[Azure (color)|sky blue]], while the pro-[[U.S. state|statehood]] groups use a darker shade of blue more similar to that of the U.S. flag.
