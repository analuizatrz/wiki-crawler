'''John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough''' ([[6 June]] [[1650]] &ndash; [[27 June]] [[1722]])<ref> All dates in the article are [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] (unless otherwise stated). The [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] calendar as used in England differed by eleven days after 1700. Thus, the [[Battle of Blenheim]] is 13 August N.S or 2 August O.S.</ref> was an [[England|English]] soldier and statesman whose career spanned the reigns of five monarchs throughout the late 17th and early 18th centuries. His rise to prominence began as a lowly page in the royal court of [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] England, but his natural courage on the field of battle soon ensured quick promotion and recognition from his master and mentor [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]]. When James became king in 1685, Churchill played a major role in crushing the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]]'s rebellion; but just three years later, Churchill abandoned his Catholic king for the Protestant [[William III of England|William of Orange]].

Honoured at William's coronation, Churchill, now the Earl of Marlborough, served with distinction in [[Ireland]] and [[Flanders]] during the [[War of the Grand Alliance]]. However, throughout the reign of [[William and Mary]], their relationship with Marlborough and his influential wife [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah]], remained cool. After damaging allegations of collusion with the exiled court of King James, Marlborough was dismissed from all civil and military offices and temporarily imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. Only after the death of Mary, and the threat of another major European war, did Marlborough return to favour with William. 

Marlborough's influence at court reached its zenith with the accession of Sarah's close friend [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Promoted to [[Captain-General]] of British forces, and later to a dukedom, Marlborough found international fame in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] where, on the fields of [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]], [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Battle of Oudenarde|Oudenarde]], his place in history as one of Europe's great generals was assured. However, when his wife fell from royal grace as Queen Anne's favourite, the [[Tory|Tories]], determined on peace with France, pressed for his downfall.  Marlborough was dismissed from all civil and military offices on charges of [[embezzlement]], but the Duke eventually regained favour with the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] in 1714. Although returned to his former offices, the Duke's health soon deteriorated and, after a series of [[stroke]]s, he eventually succumbed to his illness in his bed at [[Cumberland Lodge|Windsor Lodge]] on [[27 June]] [[1722]].

==Early life (1650–78)==
====Ashe House====
At the end of the [[English Civil War]], Lady Eleanor Drake was joined at her [[Devon]] home, Ashe House, by her third daughter Elizabeth, and Elizabeth's husband, [[Winston Churchill (1620-1688)|Winston Churchill]]. Unlike his mother-in-law, who had supported the [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] cause, Winston had had the misfortune of fighting on the losing side of the war for which he, like so many other cavaliers, was forced to pay recompense; in his case £4,446.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.59</ref> This crippling fine had impoverished the ex-Royalist cavalry captain whose motto ''Fiel Pero Desdichado'' (Faithful but Unfortunate) is still today used by his descendants. 
[[Image:The 1st Duke of Marlborough's genealogy.PNG|thumb|400px|The Duke of Marlborough's genealogy. With no surviving male heir, Henrietta became the [[Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough|2nd Duchess of Marlborough]]. On her death in 1733, [[Anne Churchill|Anne]]'s son Charles became the [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough|3rd Duke of Marlborough]].]]
Elizabeth gave birth to 12 children, only five of whom survived infancy. The eldest daughter, [[Arabella Churchill (royal mistress)|Arabella]] was born in February 1649; the eldest son, John, was born the following year on [[26 May]], [[1650]]. Growing up in these impoverished conditions, with family tensions soured by conflicting allegiances, may have had a lasting impression on the young Churchill. His father's namesake, and John Churchill's biographer, [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]], asserted – "[The conditions at Ashe] might well have aroused in his mind two prevailing impressions: First a hatred of poverty. . . and secondly, the need of hiding thoughts and feelings from those to whom their expression would be repugnant."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.3</ref>

After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1660 his father's fortunes took a turn for the better, although he remained far from prosperous.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.60</ref> As a mark of Royal favour Winston had received rewards for losses incurred fighting [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] during the civil war, including the appointment as [[Commissioner for Irish Land Claims]] in [[Dublin]] in 1662. While in Ireland, John attended the [[The King's Hospital|Free School]], but a year later his studies were transferred to [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in [[London]], after his father was recalled to take up the position of Junior Clerk Comptroller of the [[Royal Household|King's Household]] at [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]]. Charles' own penury, however, meant the old cavaliers received scant financial reward, but what the prodigal king could offer – which would cost him nothing – were positions at court for their progeny. So it was that in 1665, Winston Churchill's eldest daughter, Arabella, became Maid of Honour to [[Anne Hyde]], the Duchess of York, joined some months later by her brother John, as page to her husband, James.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.5. Arabella later became one of the Duke of York's mistresses.</ref>

====Early military experience====
[[James II of England|James, Duke of York's]] passion for all things naval and military rubbed off on young Churchill. Often accompanying the Duke inspecting the troops in the royal parks, it was not long before the boy had set his heart on becoming a soldier himself. On [[14 September]] [[1667]], soon after his 17th birthday, he obtained a commission as [[ensign]] in the King's Own Company in the 1st Guards, later to become the [[Grenadier Guards]].<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.6</ref> His career was further advanced when in 1668, Churchill sailed for the North African outpost of [[Tangier]], recently acquired as part of the [[dowry]] of Charles' Portuguese wife, [[Catherine of Braganza]]. In a rude contrast to life at court, Churchill stayed here for three years, gaining first-class tactical training and field experience skirmishing with the [[Moors]].<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.5. Although details of this period are sketchy, it is surmised that in 1670 he also served aboard ship in the naval blockade of the [[Barbary]] pirate-den of [[Algiers]].</ref>

Back in London by February 1671, Churchill's handsome features and manner – described by [[Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] as "irresistible to either man or woman" – had soon attracted the ravenous attentions of one of the King's most noteworthy mistresses, [[Barbara Villiers]], Duchess of Cleveland.<ref>Hibbert ''The Marlboroughs'', p.7. Churchill was 20, she was 29 when they became lovers.</ref> But his liaisons with the insatiable temptress were indeed dangerous. One account has it that upon His Majesty's appearance, Churchill leapt out of his lover's bed and hid in the cupboard, but the King, himself wily in such matters, soon discovered young Churchill who promptly fell to his knees – "You are a rascal," said the King, "but I forgive you because you do it to get your bread."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'' p.8. The story may be apocryphal (another version has Churchill jumping out of the window), but it is widely accepted that Churchill was the father of Cleveland's third daughter.</ref> 
[[Image:De Velde, Battle Of Solebay.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Battle of Solebay]] by [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]]. Churchill here learned the uncertainties and hazards of naval warfare.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.40</ref>]]

A year later Churchill went to sea again. Whilst fighting the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] navy at the [[Battle of Solebay]] off the [[Suffolk]] coast in June 1672, valorous conduct aboard the Duke of York's flagship, the ''[[Royal Prince]]'', earned Churchill promotion (above the resentful heads of more senior officers) to a captaincy in the [[Lord High Admiral's Regiment]].<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'' p.9. Chandler names the ship simply as The Prince</ref> The following year Churchill gained a further commendation at the [[Siege of Maastricht]] when the young captain distinguished himself as part of the 30-man [[forlorn hope]], successfully capturing and defending part of the fortress. During this incident Churchill is credited with saving the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]]'s life, receiving a slight wound in the process but gaining further praise from a grateful House of Stuart, as well as recognition from the [[House of Bourbon]]. King [[Louis XIV]] in person commended the deed, from which time forward bore Churchill an enviable reputation for physical courage, as well as earning the high regard of the common soldier.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.7</ref> 

Although King Charles' anti-French Parliament had forced England to withdraw from the [[Franco-Dutch War]] in 1674, some English regiments remained in French service. In April Churchill was appointed the colonelcy of one such regiment, thereafter serving with, and learning from, the great [[Marshal Turenne]]. Churchill was present at the hard-fought battles of [[Battle of Sinzheim|Sinzheim]] and [[Battle of Entzheim|Entzheim]], for which he earned further praise – he may also have been present at [[Battle of Sasbach|Sasbach]] in June 1675, where Turenne was killed.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.8</ref> On his return to [[St James' Palace]], Churchill's attention was drawn towards other matters, and to a fresh face at court.

====From martial to marital matters====
[[Image:Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Sarah Churchill]], Duchess of Marlborough, c.1700 by [[Sir Godfrey Kneller]].<ref>Gregg: ''Queen Anne''</ref>]]

"I beg you will let me see you as often as you can," pleaded Churchill in a letter to [[Sarah Jennings]], "which I am sure you ought to do if you care for my love. . ."<ref name=hibbert13>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.13</ref> Sarah Jennings' social origins were in many ways similar to Churchill's – minor gentry blighted by debt-induced poverty. After her father died when she was eight, Sarah, together with her mother and sisters, moved to London – a city still recovering from the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of two years previous. As Royalist supporters, the Jennings' loyalty to the crown, like the Churchill's, was repaid with court employment – by 1673, Sarah had become a Maid of Honour to the Duchess of York, [[Mary of Modena]], second wife to James, Duke of York.<ref>Field: ''The Favourite: Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough'', p.8</ref>

Sarah was about fifteen when Churchill returned from the Continent in 1675, and he appears to have been almost immediately captivated by her charms and not inconsiderable good looks.<ref name=hibbert13/> But Churchill's amorous, almost abject, missives of devotion were, it seems, received with suspicion and accusations of incredulity – his first lover, Barbara Villiers, was just moving her household to [[Paris]], feeding doubts that he may well have been looking at Sarah as a replacement mistress rather than a fiancée.<ref>Field: ''The Favourite: Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough'', p.23</ref> "You say I pretend passion for you," protested Churchill. . . "I cannot imagine what you mean by it."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.14</ref> However, his persistent courtship over the coming months eventually won over the beautiful, if relatively poor, Maid of Honour. Although Sir Winston wished his son to marry the wealthy [[Catherine Sedley]] (if only to ease his own burden of debt), Colonel Churchill married Sarah sometime in the winter of 1677–78, possibly in the apartments of the Duchess of York.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.15</ref>

==Mid-life crises (1678–1700)==
Churchill (now [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]] and [[Master of the Robes]] to Prince George), together with Sarah, shared life between his parent's home in [[Dorset]] (much to his wife's chagrin) and, when in London, his bachelor lodgings in [[Jermyn Street]]. It was not long though before Churchill was awarded his first important diplomatic mission to the Continent. Accompanied by his friend and rising politician, [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Sidney Godolphin]], Churchill was assigned to negotiate a treaty in [[The Hague]] with the Dutch and Spanish in preparation for war – this time against France.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.18. Godolphin was the Tory MP for [[Helston]].</ref> The young diplomat's essay in international statecraft proved personally successful, bringing him into contact with [[William I of England|William, Prince of Orange]], who was highly impressed by the shrewdness and courtesy of Churchill's negotiating skills.<ref name=barnett43>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.43</ref> The assignment had helped Churchill develop a breadth of experience that other mere soldiers were never to achieve,<ref name=barnett43/> but because of the duplicitous dealings of Charles's secret negotiations with King Louis (Charles had no intention of waging war against France), the mission ultimately proved abortive.<ref name=chandler10>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.10</ref> 

On his return to England, Churchill was appointed temporary rank of [[Brigadier-General]] of Foot, but hopes of promised action on the Continent proved illusory as the warring factions sued for peace and signed the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]].<ref name=chandler10/> However, in the coming years, troubles nearer to home would further test Churchill's statesmanship, generalship and most controversially, his loyalty.

====Plot====
[[Image:The Marlborough Family.jpeg|thumb|250px|A later painting of ''The Marlborough family'' by [[Johann Baptist Closterman]]. On the Duke's left are Elizabeth, Mary, [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|the Duchess]], [[Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough|Henrietta]], [[Anne Churchill|Anne]] and John.]]
The iniquities of the [[Popish Plot]] ([[Titus Oates]]' fabricated conspiracy aimed at [[Exclusion Bill|excluding]] the Catholic Duke of York from the English accession), meant temporary banishment for James – an exile that would last nearly three years. Churchill was obliged to attend his master – who in due course was permitted to move to [[Scotland]] – but it was not until 1682, after Charles' complete victory over the exclusionists, that the Duke of York was allowed to return to London and Churchill's career could again prosper.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.24. During his time in Scotland, Churchill was dispatched on various important diplomatic missions. His personal successes led to talk of him becoming British minister at The Hague.</ref> 

Made Baron Churchill of [[Eyemouth]] in the [[peerage of Scotland]] in December 1682, and with the additional appointment as colonel of the [[Royal Dragoons|King's Own Royal Regiment of Dragoons]] the following year, the Churchills' combined income ensured a life of some style and comfort; as well as maintaining their residence in London (staffed with seven servants), they were also able to purchase Holywell House in [[St Albans]] where their growing family could enjoy the benefits of country life.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.27</ref> 

The Churchills were however, soon drawn back to court. With her marriage to [[Prince George of Denmark]], the 18-year-old [[Anne of Great Britain|Princess Anne]] offered Sarah – of whom she had been passionately fond since childhood – an appointment to her household. Their relationship continued to blossom, so much so that years later Sarah wrote – "To see [me] was a constant joy; and to part with [me] for never so short a time, a constant uneasiness. . . This worked even to the jealousy of a lover."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.28</ref> For his part, Churchill treated the princess with respectful affection and grew genuinely attached to her, assuming – in his reverence to royalty – the chivalrous role of a knightly champion.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.135. As a trusted envoy, Churchill was assigned to bring Prince George back to England.</ref>

====Revolution====
With the death of King Charles in 1685, his brother, James, Duke of York became King James II, much to the consternation of the bastard son of Charles and [[Lucy Walter]], [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth]]. Urged on by malcontents and various [[British Whig Party|Whig]] conspirators (exiled for their part in the failed [[Rye House plot]]), Monmouth prepared to take what he considered rightfully his – the Protestant crown of England. 
[[Image:Monmouth's Execution.gif|thumb|left|[[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Monmouth]]'s execution on [[Tower Hill]], [[15 July]] [[1685]]. Other rebels, including [[Daniel Defoe]], were more fortunate and managed to escape.]]

Newly-promoted [[Major-General]] Churchill was to be robbed of overall command of His Majesty's forces chosen to face Monmouth; the honour instead passed to the limited, but highly loyal, [[Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham]]. "I see plainly that the trouble is mine," complained Churchill to [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], "and that the honour will be another's."<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p46</ref> Monmouth's ill-timed, ill-equipped and ill-advised peasant [[Monmouth Rebellion|rebellion]] eventually floundered on the [[West Country]] field of [[Battle of Sedgemoor|Sedgemoor]] on [[6 July]] [[1685]] (O.S); but although his role was subordinate to Feversham, Churchill's administrative organisation, tactical skill and courage in battle in his first independent command was pivotal in the victory – the man who saved Monmouth's life at Maastricht had now brought about his demise at Sedgemoor. 

As prophesised, Feversham received the lion's share of the reward. Churchill was not entirely forgotten – in August he was awarded the lucrative colonelcy of the Third Troop of [[Life Guards]] – but the witch-hunt that followed the rebellion, driven by the bloodthirsty zeal of [[Judge Jeffreys]], sickened his sense of propriety.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.22. Churchill played no part in the aftermath of slaughter.</ref> Indeed, it may be possible that the Sedgemoor campaign, and its subsequent persecutions, set in train a process of disillusion that culminated in his abandonment of his king, and long-time patron and friend, just three short years later.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.21</ref>
[[Image:John Churchill in his thirties.jpg|thumb|John Churchill in his thirties, attributed to [[John Riley]]. The Star of the [[Order of the Garter]] was added after 1707.]]

Churchill remained at court, but was anxious not to be seen as sympathetic towards the King's growing religious ardour.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.36</ref>  James' Catholicising of English institutions – including the army – engendered first suspicion, and ultimately [[sedition]] in his mainly Protestant subjects. Some in the King's service, such as the [[William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]] and the [[John Drummond, 1st Earl of Melfort|Earl of Melfort]] betrayed their Protestant upbringing in order to gain favour at court, but Churchill remained true to his conscience, "I have been bred a Protestant, and intend to live and die in that communion."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.37. Had he abandoned his faith he would also have alienated Princess Anne.</ref> The '[[Glorious Revolution]]' of [[1688]] was to put this declaration to the test. 

Although the invitation by various [[Whigs]], [[Tories]] and Protestant<!--Anglican?--> churchmen for William, Prince of Orange to invade England was not signed by Churchill, he declared his intention through William's principal English contact in The Hague – "If you think there is anything else that I ought to do, you have but to command me."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.40</ref> Churchill, like many others, was looking for an opportune time to desert James.

William landed at [[Torbay]] on [[5 November]] [[1688]] (O.S). From there, he moved his forces to [[Exeter]]. James' forces – once again commanded by Lord Feversham – moved to [[Salisbury]], but few of its officers were eager to fight – even James' daughter Princess Anne wrote to William to wish him "good success in this so just an undertaking."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.41</ref>

Churchill, promoted to [[Lieutenant-General]], was still at his king's side but un-characteristic displays of disloyalty, showing "the greatest transports of joy imaginable" at the desertion of [[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon|Lord Cornbury]], led to entreaties from Feversham for his arrest. Churchill himself had openly encouraged defection to the Orangist cause, but James continued to prevaricate.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.24</ref> Soon it was too late to act. After the meeting of the council of war on the morning of [[23 November]], Churchill, accompanied by some 400 officers and men, slipped from the royal camp and rode towards William in [[Axminster]]. Before his desertion, Churchill left behind him a letter of apology and self-justification: "I am activated by a higher principle. . . I will always with hazard of my life and fortune (so much as Your Majesty's due) endeavour to preserve your royal person and lawful rights, with all the tender concerns and dutiful respect that becomes, sir, Your Majesty's most dutiful and most obliged subject and servant, Churchill." Churchill, who was a staunch [[Anglican]], found that the cause of religion was worth a technical act of [[treason|betrayal]].<ref>Barnet: ''Marlborough'', p.22</ref> James, who in the words of one French contemporary, had "given up three kingdoms for a Mass", fled to France, taking with him his heir, [[James Francis Edward Stuart |James, Prince of Wales]] (later known as "The Old Pretender").  With barely a shot fired, William had secured the throne, reigning as joint sovereign with James' eldest daughter, [[Mary II of England|Mary]].

====War of the Grand Alliance====
In April 1689, as part of William's coronation honours, Churchill was created Earl of Marlborough. His elevation in the peerage led to accusatory rumours from James' supporters that Marlborough had disgracefully betrayed his erstwhile King for personal gain; William himself entertained reservations about the man who had deserted James.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.46</ref> Marlborough's apologists though (including his most notable descendant Winston Churchill) have been at pains to attribute patriotic, religious and moral motives to his action, but, in the words of historian David Chandler, it must be plainly asserted that Marlborough was also motivated by ambition and self-interest – it is difficult to absolve Marlborough of ruthlessness, ingratitude, intrigue and treachery against a man to whom he owed virtually everything in his life and career to date.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.25</ref>
 
Less than six months after James' departure for the Continent, England declared war on France as part of a powerful coalition aimed at curtailing the ambitions of King Louis XIV; but although the [[War of the Grand Alliance]] lasted nine years (1688-97), Marlborough saw only three years' service in the field, and then mostly in subordinate commands. However, at [[Battle of Walcourt|Walcourt]] on [[25 August]] [[1689]] Marlborough won praise from the Dutch commander, [[Prince Georg Friedrich of Waldeck|Prince Waldeck]], – ". . . despite his youth he displayed greater military capacity than do most generals after a long series of wars. . . He is assuredly one of the most gallant men I know."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.48</ref> 
[[Image:Princess Anne c.1690.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Anne of Great Britain|Princess Anne]] c.1690 by [[Michael Dahl]].]]
When he returned to England, Marlborough was presented with further opportunities. As commander-in-chief of the forces in England he became highly knowledgeable of all the intricacies and illogicalities of the English military system, and played a major role in its reorganisation and recruitment; but since Walcourt, Marlborough's popularity at court had waned.<ref name=chandler35>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.35</ref> William and Mary distrusted both Lord and Lady Marlborough's influence as confidents and supporters of the Princess; so much so that a resentful Mary asked her sister to choose between herself and the King on the one hand, and the Marlboroughs on the other – unhesitantly, Anne chose the latter.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.137: Anne wished to have her own [[Civil List]] income granted by Parliament, rather than a grant from the [[Privy Purse]], which meant reliance on William. In this, and other matters, Anne was supported by Sarah.</ref> For the moment though, the clash of tempers were over-shadowed by more pressing events in [[Williamite War in Ireland|Ireland]], where James had landed in March 1689 in his attempt to regain his throne. When William left for Ireland in June 1690, Marlborough was appointed a member of the Council of Nine to advise Queen Mary in the King's absence, but she made scant effort to disguise her distaste at his appointment – "I can neither trust or esteem him," she wrote to William.<ref name=chandler35/> 

William's decisive victory at the [[Battle of the Boyne|Boyne]] on [[11 July]] [[1690]] had forced James to abandon his army and flee back to France. After obtaining permission from William, Marlborough himself left for Ireland, capturing the ports of [[Cork Harbour|Cork]] and [[Kinsale]] in October, but he was to be disappointed in his hopes of an independent command. Although William recognised Marlborough's qualities as a soldier, he was still not disposed to fully trust anyone who had defected from King James, and loath to advance a career of a man whom he described to [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] as 'very assuming'.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.50</ref>
 
====Dismissal and disgrace====
The refusal of a dukedom and the [[Order of the Garter]], as well as failing to be appointed [[Master-General of the Ordnance]], rankled with the ambitious earl; nor had Marlborough concealed his bitter disappointment behind his usual bland discretion.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.22</ref> Using his influence in Parliament and the army, Marlborough aroused dissatisfaction concerning William's preferences for foreign commanders, an exercise designed to force the King's hand.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.46: William's Dutch friend, [[Godert de Ginkell, 1st Earl of Athlone|Godert de Ginkell]], remained in command of his forces in Ireland while Waldeck, who had been severely beaten by the [[François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|duc de Luxembourg]] at [[Battle of Fleurus|Fleurus]] in July 1690, continued in charge of the Allied army on the Continent.</ref> William, aware of this, in turn began to speak openly of his distrust of Marlborough; the [[Frederick I of Prussia|Elector of Brandenburg]]'s envoy to London overheard the King remark that he had been treated – "so infamously by Marlborough that, had he not been king, he would have felt it necessary to challenge him to a [[duel]]."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.57</ref>

Since January 1691, Marlborough had been in contact with James at [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]]. The Duke was anxious to obtain the exiled King's [[pardon]] for deserting him in 1688 – a pardon essential for the success of his future career in the not altogether unlikely event of James' restoration.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.54</ref> William was well aware of these contacts (as well as others such as Godolphin and Shrewsbury), but their double-dealing was seen more in the nature of an insurance policy, rather than as an explicit commitment – a necessary element in a situation of unexampled complexity.<ref>Churchill: ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples: Age of Revolution'', p.11</ref> However, by the time William and Marlborough had returned from an uneventful campaign in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in October 1691, their relationship had further deteriorated. 
[[Image:Godolphin.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]], [[Lord Treasurer]], Chief Minister and fellow Tory friend of Marlborough.]]
On [[20 January]] [[1692]], the [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham|Earl of Nottingham]], [[Secretary of State]], ordered Marlborough to dispose of all his posts and offices, both civil and military, and consider himself dismissed from the army and banned from court.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.137: Queen Mary also demanded Anne should dismiss Sarah, which she refused to do.</ref> No reasons were given but Marlborough's chief associates were outraged; the [[Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury|Duke of Shrewsbury]] voiced his disapproval and Godolphin threatened to retire from government; [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Admiral Russell]], now commander-in-chief of the Navy personally accused the King of ingratitude to the man who had "set the crown upon his head."<ref>Churchill: ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples: Age of Revolution'', p.12: John Childs in his ''British Army of William III'', p.63, states that the most serious misdemeanour in the eyes of William was his "role in alienating the British army officer corps from the Dutch and German generals."</ref>

====High treason====
The nadir of Marlborough's fortunes had not yet been reached. The spring of 1692 brought renewed threats of a French invasion and new accusations of [[Jacobite]] treachery. Acting on the testimony of Robert Young, the Queen had arrested all the signatories to a letter purporting the restoration of James II and the seizure of King William. Marlborough, as one of these signatories was sent to the [[Tower of London]] on [[14 May]] where he languished for five weeks; his anguish compounded by the news of the death of his younger son Charles. Young's letters were eventually discredited as forgeries and Marlborough released, but he continued his correspondence with James, leading to the celebrated incident of the "[[Camaret Bay]] letter" of 1694.<ref name=chandler47>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.47</ref>

For several months the Allies had been planning an [[Attack on Brest|attack against Brest]], the French port in the [[Bay of Biscay]]. The French had received intelligence alerting them to the imminent assault, enabling [[Marshal Vauban]] to strengthen its defences and reinforce the garrison. Inevitably, the attack on [[18 June]], led by the English General [[Thomas Tollemache]], ended in disaster; most of his men were killed or captured – Tollemache himself died of his wounds shortly afterwards.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.67</ref> 

Despite lacking evidence of the letter Marlborough's detractors claim that it was he who had alerted the enemy.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.47: [[Thomas Macaulay]] (who lost no opportunity in denigrating Marlborough) in his ''History of England'', suggests that Marlborough betrayed the Allied plans to rid himself of a talented rival, – "If Tollemache were defeated and disgraced, William would scarcely have a choice [to reinstate Marlborough in the army]."</ref> But although it is practically certain that Marlborough sent a message across the channel in early May describing the impending attack on [[Brest, France|Brest]], it is equally certain that the French had long learned of the expedition from another source – possibly Godolphin or the [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Earl of Danby]].<ref name=chandler47/> Sir Winston Churchill goes as far to say that the letter was a forgery, however David Chandler states – "the whole episode is so obscure and inconclusive that it is still not possible to make a definite ruling. In sum, perhaps we should award Marlborough the benefit of the doubt."<ref name=chandler48>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.48</ref>

====Reconciliation====
Mary's death on [[7 January]] [[1695]], eventually led to a formal, but cool, reconciliation between William and Anne, now heir to the throne. Marlborough hoped that the rapprochement would lead to his own return to office, but although he and Lady Marlborough were allowed to return to court, the earl received no offer of employment.<ref name=chandler48/>

In 1696 Marlborough, together with Godolphin, Russell and Shrewsbury, was yet again implicated in a treasonous plot with King James, this time instigated by the Jacobite militant [[John Fenwick|Sir John Fenwick]]. The conspiracy was eventually dismissed as a fabrication and Fenwick executed – the King himself had remained incredulous of the accusations – but it was not until 1698, a year after the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] brought an end to the War of the Grand Alliance, that the corner was finally turned in William's and Marlborough's relationship.<ref name=chandler48/> On the recommendation of [[Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] (whose wife was also a close friend of Lady Marlborough), William eventually offered Marlborough the post of governor to the [[William, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]], Anne's eldest son. He was also restored to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], together with his military rank.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.80. Marlborough's son John, was appointed [[Master of the Horse]] at a salary of £500 a year.</ref> However, striving to reconcile his close Tory connections with that of the dutiful royal servant was difficult, leading Marlborough to bemoan – "The King's coldness to me still continues."<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.49</ref>

==Later life (1700–22)==
====A new Grand Alliance====
With the death of the infirm and childless [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II]] of Spain on [[1 November]] [[1700]], the succession of the Spanish throne, and subsequent control over her empire (including the [[Spanish Netherlands]]), once again embroiled Europe in war – the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. On his deathbed, Charles had bequeathed his domains to [[King Louis XIV]]'s grandson, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip, Duc d'Anjou]]. This threatened to unite the Spanish and French kingdoms under the [[House of Bourbon]] – something unacceptable to England, the Dutch Republic and the Austrian Emperor, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], who had himself a claim to the Spanish throne.

With William's health deteriorating (the King himself estimating he had but a short time to live), and with the Earl's undoubted influence over his successor Princess Anne, William decided that Marlborough should take centre stage in European affairs. Representing William in [[The Hague]] as Ambassador-Extraordinary, and as commander of English forces, Marlborough was tasked to negotiate a new coalition to oppose France and Spain. On [[7 September]] [[1701]], the Treaty of the Second Grand Alliance was duly signed by England, the Emperor and the Dutch Republic to thwart the ambitions of Louis XIV and stem Bourbon power.<ref>Gregg: ''Queen Anne'', p.126: Marlborough was also to settle the number of soldiers and sailors each coalition partner was to contribute and to supervise the organisation and supply of these troops. In these matters he was ably assisted by [[Adam Cardonnel]] and [[William Cadogan]].</ref> William however, was not to see England's declaration of war. On [[19 March]] [[1702]], the King, already in a poor state of health, died from injuries sustained in a riding accident, leaving his sister-in-law, Anne, to be immediately proclaimed as his successor. But although the King's death occasioned instant disarray amongst the coalition, [[Count Wratislaw]] was able to report – "The greatest consolation in this confusion is that Marlborough is fully informed of the whole position and by reason of his credit with the Queen can do everything."<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.24</ref>

[[Image:Marlborough-duke-first.jpg|thumb|170px|John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough by [[Sir Godfrey Kneller]]. Pictured here in his garter robes.]]
This 'credit with the Queen' also proved personally profitable to her long-standing friends. Anxious to reward Marlborough for his diplomatic and martial skills in Ireland and on the continent, Marlborough became the [[Master-General of the Ordnance]] – an office he had long desired – made a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] and [[Captain-General]] of her armies at home and abroad. With Lady Marlborough's advancements as [[Groom of the Stole]], [[Mistress of the Robes]] and [[Keeper of the Privy Purse]], the Marlboroughs, now at the height of their powers with the Queen, enjoyed a joint annual income of over £60,000, and unrivalled influence at court.<ref>Gregg: ''Queen Anne'', p.153: £4m in today's money.</ref>  

====War of the Spanish Succession====
On [[15 May]] [[1702]] England formally declared war on France. Marlborough was given command of the British, Dutch and hired German forces, but the command had its limitations: as Captain-General he had the power to give orders to Dutch generals only when Dutch troops were in action with his own; at all other times he had to rely on the consent of accompanying Dutch field deputies or political representatives of the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] – his ability to direct Allied strategy would rely on his tact and powers of persuasion.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.31</ref> But despite being frustrated by his Dutch allies' initial lassitude to bring the French to battle, the war began well for Marlborough who managed to out-manoeuvre the French commander, [[Louis François, duc de Boufflers|Marshal Boufflers]].<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.104. The Dutch generals and deputies were naturally concerned by the threat of an invasion from a powerful enemy.</ref> In 1702 he had captured [[Venlo]], [[Roermond]], [[Stevensweert]] and [[Liège (city)|Liege]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] for which, in December, a grateful Queen publicly proclaimed Marlborough a [[Duke of Marlborough|duke]].<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.107. The Queen also granted him £5,000 annually for life, but Parliament refused. Sarah, indignant at this ingratitude, suggested he refuse the title.</ref> 

On [[9 February]] [[1703]], soon after the Marlboroughs' elevation, their daughter Elizabeth married Scroop Egerton, [[Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater|Earl of Bridgewater]]; this was followed in the summer by an engagement between Mary and John Montagu, heir to the Earl of, and later [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu|Duke of, Montagu]], (they later married on [[20 March]] [[1705]]). Their two older daughters were already married: [[Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough|Henrietta]] to Godolphin's son [[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin|Francis]] in April 1698, and [[Anne Churchill|Anne]] to the hot-headed and intemperate Charles Spencer, [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Earl of Sunderland]] in 1700.<ref>Gregg: ''Queen Anne'', p.118. Marlborough himself was not keen on the marriage but Sarah, enchanted by his Whig ideology and intellectual prowess, was decidedly more enthusiastic.</ref> However, Marlborough's hopes of founding a great dynasty of his own reposed in his eldest and only surviving son, John, who, since his father's elevation, had bore the courtesy title of Marquess of Blandford. But while studying at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in early 1703, the 17 year-old was stricken with a severe strain of smallpox. His parents rushed to be by his side, but on Saturday morning, [[20 February]] the boy died, plunging the duke into 'the greatest sorrow in the world'; he later lamented to [[Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury|Lord Ailesbury]] – "I have lost what is so dear to me."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs,'' p.115</ref> 

Bearing his grief, and leaving Sarah to hers, the Duke returned to The Hague at the beginning of March. By now Boufflers had been replaced by [[François de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Marshal Villeroi]] as commander in the Spanish Netherlands,<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.116. Boufflers redeemed himself with a crushing victory over the Dutch at the [[Battle of Eckeren]].</ref> but although Marlborough was able to take [[Bonn]], [[Huy]], and [[Limbourg]] in 1703, continuing Dutch hesitancy prevented him from bringing the French in Flanders to a decisive battle.<ref>Gregg: ''Queen Anne'', p.172. A commemorative medal of these gains was cast with Queen Anne on one side and Marlborough on the other together with the inscription – 'Victory without slaughter.'</ref> Domestically the Duke also encountered resistance. Both he and Godolphin were hampered by, and often at variance with, their [[High Tories|High Tory]] colleagues who, rather than advocating a European policy, favoured the full employment of the [[Royal Navy]] in pursuit of trade advantages and colonial expansion overseas. For their part, the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], although enthusiastic for the European strategy, had dropped all pretence at supporting the conduct of the war, accounting Marlborough and Godolphin guilty of failing to provide gains commensurate with the funds generously granted them in Parliament.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.119</ref> The moderate Tory ministry of Marlborough and Godolphin found itself caught between the political extremes. However Marlborough, whose diplomatic tact had held together a very discordant Grand Alliance, was now a general of international repute, and the limited success of 1703, was soon eclipsed by the Blenheim campaign of 1704.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.121</ref>
[[Image:Duke-of-Marlborough-signing-Despatch-Blenheim-Bavaria-1704.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Marlborough writing the Blenheim despatch to Sarah, by [[Robert Alexander Hillingford]]. "I have no time to say more but to beg you will give my duty to the Queen, and let her know her army has had a glorious victory."<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.121</ref>]]

Pressed by the French and Bavarians to the west and [[Francis II Rákóczi#The Rákóczi Uprising|Hungarian rebels]] to the east, [[Austria]] faced the real possibility of being forced out of the war. Concerns over [[Vienna]] and the need to ensure the continuing involvement of Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] in the Grand Alliance, had convinced Marlborough of the necessity of sending aid to the [[Danube]]; but the scheme of seizing the initiative from the enemy was extremely bold. From the start the Duke resolved to mislead the Dutch who would never willingly permit any major weakening of the Allied forces in the Spanish Netherlands. To this end, Marlborough moved his English troops to the [[Moselle River|Moselle]], (a plan approved of by The Hague), but once there, he resolved to slip the Dutch leash and march south to link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714'', p.286</ref>

A combination of strategic deception and brilliant administration enabled Marlborough to achieve his purpose.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.128</ref> After covering approximately 250 miles in five weeks, Marlborough – together with [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] – delivered a crushing defeat of the Franco-Bavarian forces at the [[Battle of Blenheim]]. The whole campaign, which historian John Lynn describes as one of the greatest examples of marching and fighting before [[Napoleon]], had been a model of planning, logistics and tactical skill, the successful outcome of which had altered the course of the conflict – Bavaria and [[Cologne]] were knocked out of the war, and Louis' hopes of an early victory were destroyed.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714'', p.294</ref> The campaign continued with the capture of [[Landau]] on the [[Rhine]], followed by [[Trier]] and [[Trarbach]] on the Moselle. With these successes, Marlborough now stood as the foremost soldier of the age; even the Tories, who had declared that should he fail they would "break him up like hounds on a hare", could not entirely restrain their patriotic admiration.<ref>Churchill: ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples: Age of Revolution'', p.44</ref>
[[Image:Blenheim.jpg|thumb|300px| [[Sir John Vanbrugh]]'s [[Blenheim Palace]]. Begun in 1705, but plagued by financial troubles, this ‘pile of stones’, as the Duchess resentfully called it, was finally completed in 1722.]]
The Queen lavished upon her favourite the royal manor of [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]] and the promise of a fine [[Blenheim Palace|palace]] commemorative of his great victory, but since her accession, her relationship with Sarah had become progressively distant.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'' p.192.</ref> The Duke and Duchess had risen to greatness not least because of their intimacy with Anne, but Sarah had tired of petty ceremony and formality of court life and increasingly found her mistress's company wearisome. For her part, Anne, now Queen of England and no longer the timid adolescent so easily dominated by her more beautiful friend, had grown tired of Sarah's tactless political hectoring and increasingly haughty manner.<ref>Hibbert, ''The Marlboroughs'' p.207. Anne was a Tory; Sarah was a committed Whig who considered most Tories little better than Jacobites.</ref> 

After the success of Blenheim, the campaign of 1705 brought little reason for satisfaction on the continent. Endless delays and evasions from his allies had once again frustrated Marlborough's attempts at any major offensive.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.157</ref> "I find so little zeal for the common cause that it is enough to break a better heart than mine," he confided to [[Anthonie Heinsius]].<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.154</ref> Although Marlborough had been able to [[Battle of Elixheim|penetrate]] the Lines of [[Brabant]] in July, Allied indecision had prevented the Duke from pressing his advantage.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'' p.164. Marlborough, for once making no attempt to hide his feelings, complained to the States-General, resulting in [[General Slangenberg]]'s dismissal.</ref> But if 1705 had proved frustrating, 1706 was to provide ample compensation. 
[[Image:King's Horse at Ramillies, 1706.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The King's Horse at the [[Battle of Ramillies]], 1706. Marlborough can be seen on his white horse in the background.]]
On [[23 May]] [[1706]], near the village of [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] in the Spanish Netherlands, Marlborough inflicted "the most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs" on French forces, this time commanded by Marshal Villeroi. Town after town fell, but although the campaign was not decisive, it was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English general.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714'', p.308</ref> When Marlborough eventually closed down the Ramillies campaign, he had completed the conquest of almost all the Spanish Netherlands. Good news also arrived from the Italian front – Prince Eugène had routed the French army at [[Battle of Turin|Turin]].

====Falling out of favour====
While Marlborough fought in Flanders, a series of personal and party rivalries instigated a general reversal of fortune. The Whigs, who were the main prop of the war, had been laying siege to Marlborough's close friend and ally, Lord Godolphin. As a price for supporting the government in the next parliamentary session, the Whigs demanded a share of public office with the appointment of a leading member of their '[[Whig Junto|Junto]]', the [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Earl of Sunderland]], to the post of  [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department]].<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.186. Sunderland was Marlborough's son-in-law; he had married his daughter Anne.</ref> The Queen, who loathed the Whigs, bitterly opposed the move; but Godolphin, increasingly dependent on Whig support, had little room for manoeuvre. With Sarah's tactless, unsubtle backing, Godolphin relentlessly pressed the Queen to submit to Whig demands. In despair, Anne finally relented and Sunderland received the seals of office, but the special relationship between Godolphin, Sarah, and the Queen had taken a severe blow and she began to turn increasingly to a new favourite, [[Abigail Masham]]. Anne also became ever more reliant on the advice of Godolphin's and Marlborough's fellow moderate Tory [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]], who, convinced that the ''[[duumvirate]]'s'' policy of appeasing the Whig Junto was unnecessary, had set himself up as alternative source of advice to a sympathetic Queen.<ref>Barnet: ''Marlborough'', p.195. Abigail was Sarah's cousin and had been recommended by her for a minor court position.</ref> 

The Allies' ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' was followed in 1707 with a resurgence in French arms in all fronts of the war, and a return to political squabbling and indecision within the Grand Alliance. Marlborough's diplomatic skill was able to prevent [[Charles XII]], King of Sweden, from entering the war against the Empire, but Prince Eugène's retreat from [[Toulon]], and major setbacks in Spain and in Germany had ended any lingering hopes of a war-winning blow that year.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.199</ref>

Marlborough returned to England and a political storm. The High Tories were critical of Marlborough's failure to win the war in 1707 and demanded the transfer of 20,000 troops from the Low Countries to the Spanish theatre. For their part the Whigs, infuriated by the Queen's appointment of Tory bishops, threatened to withdraw support from the government. To the Duke and Godolphin this necessitated further wooing of the Junto in order to win back their support (the Junto were full of zeal for the war and, like Marlborough, considered Spain a military sideshow).<ref>Barnet: ''Marlborough'', p.197</ref> Yet the more they urged the Queen to make concessions to the Whigs, the more they pushed her into Harley's hands; at every stage of this process, the wider the breach became between the Queen and her Captain-General.<ref>Churchill: ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples: Age of Revolution'', p.59</ref>

In 1708 Marlborough was able to regain the strategic initiative for the Allies. Despite his ill-health, and the initial loss of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]] to French forces, the Duke's victory over [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme|Vendôme]] at the [[Battle of Oudenarde]] on [[11 July]], had demoralised the French army in Flanders; his eye for ground, his sense of timing and his keen knowledge of the enemy were again amply demonstrated.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.222. One French commentator said the battle – "reduced us. . . to a timid and difficult defensive. . . we were effectively under the orders of M. de Marlborough."</ref> Marlborough professed himself satisfied with the campaign, but he had become increasingly fatigued by the worsening atmosphere at court; on hearing the news of the Duke's victory the Queen initially exclaimed – "Oh Lord, when will all this bloodshed cease!"<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.212</ref>  Sarah also vexed the Duke. Relentlessly bombarding him with letters of complaint, he had at one point wearily replied – "I have neither spirits nor time to answer your three last letters."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.232</ref>
[[Image:Marlborough Gains.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Marlborough's main battles and sieges in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. In the decade he held command, 1702–11, Marlborough fought five great battles and besieged and captured over thirty enemy fortresses.]]

On [[22 October]] Marlborough captured [[Lille]], the strongest fortress in Europe (Boufflers yielded the city's citadel on [[10 December]]); he also re-took Bruges and Ghent, but the Duke and Godolphin found themselves ever more uncomfortably placed between the Whig demands for office, and a Queen strongly disinclined to reconciliation. By November, the Whig Junto had gained ascendancy in British politics, reducing the Tories to an ineffective minority; but the more the Queen resisted the Whigs, the more Godolphin and Marlborough were attacked by them for not succeeding in persuading her to give way, and in turn, attacked by the Tories for endeavouring to do so.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.214</ref>

After the Oudenarde campaign, and one of the worst winters in modern history, France was on the brink of collapse.<ref>Gregg. ''Queen Anne'', p.279</ref> However, formal peace talks broke down in April 1709 after uncompromising and exacting Whig demands were rejected by King Louis. But despite his opposition to Whig obduracy, Marlborough no longer had the support of the Queen he had once enjoyed, and, with the Whigs holding the reins of British policy, he played only a subordinate role throughout the negotiations. To compound his troubles news arrived in August of fresh trouble between the Queen and his wife; Anne had informed Sarah that finally she had had enough of her bullying, writing – "It is impossible for you to recover my former kindness. . ."<ref name=barnett235>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.235</ref>  

After outwitting [[Marshal Villars]] to take the town of [[Tournai]] on [[3 September]], the two opposing generals finally met at the tiny village of [[Battle of Malplaquet|Malplaquet]] on [[11 September]].<ref name=barnett235/> Although the battle was a technical victory for the Allies, the cost in human life was high. The Allied casualty figures were approximately double that of the French, leading Marlborough to admit – "The French have defended themselves better in this action than in any battle I've seen."<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.266</ref> Marlborough proceeded to take [[Mons]] on [[20 October]], but on his return to England his enemies used the Malplaquet casualty figures to sully his repute. Harley, now master of the Tory party, did all he could to persuade his colleagues that the Whigs – and by their apparent concord with Whig policy, Marlborough and Godolphin – were bent on leading the country to ruin, even hinting that the Duke was prolonging the war to line his own pockets.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.229</ref>  

In March 1710 fresh peace talks re-opened between Louis and the Allies, but despite French concessions the Whig government remained unwilling to compromise. However, support for the pro-war policy of the Whigs was ebbing away and, by a series of successive steps, the whole character of the government was altered. Godolphin was forced from office and, after the general election in October, a new Tory ministry installed. Although Marlborough remained a national hero and a figure of immense European prestige, it took urgent entreaties from both Prince Eugène and Godolphin to prevent the Duke from proffering his resignation.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.281</ref>

====Endgame====
In January 1711, Marlborough – 'much thinner and greatly altered' – returned to England; the crowds cheered but the Queen's new ministers, Harley and [[Henry St John]] were less welcoming; if he wished to continue to serve, he was to be nothing more than their obedient military servant.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.256</ref>
The Queen, who had recently expressed her intention of dismissing his wife, remained cold.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.267. The loss of his wife's offices would also be a severe blow to his own prestige.</ref> The Duke saw Anne in a last attempt to save his wife from dismissal, but she was not to be swayed by his supplicatory pleading, and demanded Sarah give up her Gold Key, the symbol of her office, within two days, warning – "I will talk of no other business till I have the key."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.268</ref>

Notwithstanding all this turmoil – and his declining health – Marlborough returned to The Hague in March to prepare for what was to be his last campaign, and one of his greatest. Once again Marlborough and Villars formed against each other in line of battle, this time along the [[Avesnes]]-[[le Comte]]-[[Arras]] sector of the lines of ''Non Plus Ultra'' (''see map'').<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714'', p.79. The ''Non Plus Ultra'' lines were the last and most imposing entrenched fortifications designed to halt enemy raids and hinder the movements of enemy armies. The ''Non Plus Ultra'' lines ran from the coast at [[Montreuil]] to the [[River Sambre]].</ref> Expecting another onslaught on the scale of Malplaquet, the Allied generals surmised that their commander, distressed from domestic turmoil, was leading them to an appalling slaughter.<ref>Churchill: ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples: Age of Revolution'', p.73</ref> But by an exercise of brilliant psychological deception,<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.259</ref> and a secretive night march covering 40&nbsp;miles in 18&nbsp;hours, the Allies penetrated the allegedly impregnable lines without losing a single man; Marlborough was now in position to besiege the fortress of [[Bouchain]].<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714'', p.343</ref> Villars, deceived and outmanoeuvred, was helpless to intervene, compelling the fortress's unconditional surrender on [[12 September]]. Historian David Chandler writes – "The pure military artistry with which he repeatedly deceived Villars during the first part of the campaign has few equals in the annals of military history. . . the subsequent siege of Bouchain with all its technical complexities, was an equally fine demonstration of martial superiority."<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.299</ref>

For Marlborough though, time had ran out. Throughout 1711 secret peace negotiations (to which Marlborough was not privy), had proceeded between London and [[Versailles]]. On [[17 December]] [[1711]], the Queen was able to announce, that – "notwithstanding those who delight in the arts of war" – a sneer towards Marlborough – "both time and place are appointed for opening the treaty of a general peace." The Duke of Marlborough's services as Captain-General would no longer be required.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.278</ref>

====Dismissal====
The British representative, St John, had gained highly favourable terms but Marlborough, who was a close associate of George of Hanover, the heir to the throne, and still enjoyed the support of the King of Prussia and the Princes of the Grand Alliance, was wholeheartedly against a separate peace treaty between Britain and France. Harley and St John now determined once and for all to mastermind Marlborough's fall.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.302</ref>

On [[1 January]] [[1712]], the Commissioners of Public Accounts laid a report before the Commons accusing the Duke (and others), of turning public funds to his own profit. Marlborough was confronted with two irregularities: first, an assertion that over nine years he had illegally received more than £63,000 from the bread and transport contractors in the Netherlands; second, that the 2.5% he had received from the pay of foreign troops, totalling £280,000, was public money and 'ought to be accounted for'.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.302. The Tory ''Examiner'', for which the poet [[Matthew Prior]] and author [[Jonathon Swift]] wrote, also accused the Duke of diverting money from the medical services to line his own pockets.</ref> On [[11 January]], the Queen saw fit to dismiss Marlborough from all employments so – "that the matter might have impartial examination."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.286</ref> Marlborough however, was able to refute the charges of [[embezzlement]]. Concerning the first allegation he could claim ancient precedent: contractors had always paid a yearly sum as a perquisite to the commander-in-chief in the [[Low Countries]]. For the second charge he could produce a warrant signed by the Queen in 1702 authorising him to make the deduction – which had always been customary in the Grand Alliance since the days of King William – and that all the money received was used for providing him with the means of creating an intelligence network;<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p.302. Marlborough employed an extensive network of spies, informers and reporters who kept him supplied with intelligence.</ref> a [[Secret Service]] that had penetrated the court of King Louis.

Able speeches in the [[British House of Commons|House]] were made on the Duke's behalf, but the Tories (whose propaganda campaign of discrediting the Duke had included the talents of the great [[satire|satirist]] [[Jonathan Swift]]) were in the majority. When the vote was taken it was carried by 270 against 165.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.285</ref> The Queen ordered the [[Attorney-General]] to prepare a prosecution against Marlborough, but St John, acknowledging the flimsiness of the government's case, was compelled to halt the [[impeachment]] proceedings – Marlborough's successor, the [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde]], had himself already been authorized to take the same 2.5% commission on the pay of foreign troops.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.267</ref>

====Return to favour====
[[Image:John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650-1722).jpg|thumb|170px|John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough by [[Enoch Seeman]]. This late portrait shows Marlborough during his retirement possibly 1716/17 after his [[stroke]].]]
Marlborough, later to be joined by Sarah, left faction-torn England for the Continent. Reasons for his exile remain speculative, but wherever they travelled they were welcomed and fêted by the people and courts of Europe, where he was not only respected as a great general, but also as a [[Mindelheim|Prince of the Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.290. Marlborough lost the principality of [[Mindelheim]] at the [[Treaty of Rastadt]], but retained the title which was passed on to future Dukes of Marlborough.</ref> Marlborough bore the exile better than his wife who complained – "Tis much better to be dead than to live out of England;" but further tragedy struck the aging Duke when news arrived of the death of his beloved daughter Elizabeth, Countess of Bridgwater, from [[smallpox]].<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.295. It is said on hearing the news, his head dropped with such force on the marble mantelpiece that he fell unconscious to the floor.</ref>

On their return to [[Dover]] on [[2 August]] [[1714]] (21 months after departure), they learnt that Queen Anne had died only the day before. They left immediately for London, escorted by a 'train of coaches and a troop of militia with drums and trumpets'. With equal warmth the [[Elector of Hanover]], now [[King George I]], received Marlborough with the welcoming words – "My Lord Duke, I hope your troubles are now all over."<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.298</ref>

Reappointed as Master-General of Ordnance as well as Captain-General, Marlborough became once more a person of great influence and respect at court. Together with the Hanoverian minister [[Count Bernsdorf]], the Hanoverian diplomatist [[Baron von Bothmar]], and [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]], Marlborough returned to the heart of government; but the Duke's health was fading fast. His central position was increasingly taken over by [[Robert Walpole]] and [[James Stanhope]], so much so that during the [[Jacobitism|1715 Jacobite rising]], he was only nominally in command, leaving it to the younger men to deal decisively with the crisis.<ref>Hibbert: ''The Marlboroughs'', p.300</ref>

On [[28 May]], [[1716]], shortly after the death of his favourite daughter Anne, Countess of Sunderland, the Duke suffered a paralytic [[stroke]] at Holywell House. This was followed by another stroke in November, this time at a house on the Blenheim estate. The Duke recovered somewhat, but while his speech had become impaired, his mind remained clear, recovering enough to ride out to watch the builders at work on Blenheim Palace and its landscaped grounds.

In 1719 the Duke and Duchess were able to move into the east wing of the unfinished palace, but Marlborough had only three years to enjoy it. While living at the [[Cumberland Lodge|Great Lodge]] in [[Windsor Great Park]], he suffered another stroke in June 1722, not long after his 72nd birthday. His two surviving daughters, Henrietta Godolphin and Mary Montagu, called on their dying father; but to Sarah, who had always felt the children an intrusion between herself and her husband, this was an unwelcome visitation. Only when the Duchess had made her third request for her daughters to leave the room did they go reluctantly and in ill-grace.<ref>Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.273</ref> In the night hours the Duke began to slip away, and on the morning of [[27 June]] [[1722]], John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, died.

==Assessment==
Marlborough is considered by military historians to be one of the great commanders in history.  According to Chandler, he was "the greatest soldier produced by the British Isles in modern history."<ref> Chandler, Introduction to ''Marlborough as Military Commander''.</ref> The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] once remarked that "I can conceive nothing greater than Marlborough at the head of an English army."<ref>Longford, Elizabeth. ''Wellington: Pillar of State''. Harper and Row, 1972. p.412</ref>  His descendant, [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]] in his biography of Marlborough, declared:
{{cquote|He commanded the armies of Europe against France for ten campaigns. He fought four great battles and many important actions. . . He never fought a battle that he did not win, nor besieged a fortress that he did not take. . . He quitted war invincible: and no sooner was his guiding hand withdrawn than disaster overtook the armies he had led. Successive generations have not ceased to name him with Hannibal and Caesar. . . Every taunt, however bitter; every tale, however petty; every charge, however shameful, for which the incidents of a long career could afford a pretext, has been leveled against him." <ref>Churchill. ''Marlborough: His Life and Times''</ref>}}
