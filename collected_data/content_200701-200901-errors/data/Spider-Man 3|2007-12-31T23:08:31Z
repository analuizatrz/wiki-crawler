'''''Spider-Man 3''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[United States|American]] [[superhero film]] written and directed by [[Sam Raimi]], with a [[screenplay]] by [[Ivan Raimi]] and Alvin Sargent. It is the third film in the [[Spider-Man film series|''Spider-Man'' film franchise]] based on the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Spider-Man]]. The film stars [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[James Franco]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], and [[Topher Grace]].

The film begins with [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] basking in his success as Spider-Man, while [[Mary Jane Watson]] begins her Broadway career. [[Harry Osborn]] still seeks vengeance for his father's death, and an escaped convict, [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Flint Marko]], falls into a [[particle accelerator]] and is transformed into a shape-shifting sand manipulator. An [[Symbiote (comics)|alien symbiote]] crashes to Earth and bonds with Peter, influencing his behavior for the worse. When the symbiote is abandoned, it finds refuge in [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Eddie Brock Jr.]], a rival photographer, causing Peter to face his greatest challenge.   

''Spider-Man 3'' was commercially released in multiple countries on [[May 1]], [[2007]], and released in the United States in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters on [[May 4]], [[2007]]. Although the film received generally mixed reviews from critics, in contrast to the previous two films' highly positive reviews, it broke most of the opening weekend records, both in the United States and in foreign markets, including records held in IMAX theaters.

==Plot==
<!--PER WIKIPEDIA'S GUIDELINES AND POLICIES REGARDING PLOTS, PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANYMORE INFORMATION TO THIS PLOT. THANK YOU. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE SEE THE TALK PAGE. SPOILER TAGS ARE REDUNDANT IN THIS SECTION!-->
Peter Parker has begun to feel secure in his life and plans to propose to Mary Jane. One night in a park, while Peter and Mary Jane are on a date, a small [[meteorite]] crashes nearby, and an alien [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] oozes out, attaching itself to Peter's [[moped]]. Meanwhile, escaped convict [[Flint Marko]] falls into a [[particle accelerator]], which fuses his body with the surrounding sand. The result allows him to shape shift at will. Peter's best friend, [[Harry Osborn]], who seeks vengeance for his father's death, which he believes Peter caused, attacks him. The battle leaves Harry with short-term [[amnesia]], making him forget his vendetta. 

Later, during a festival honoring Spider-Man for saving [[Gwen Stacy]]’s life, Marko attempts to rob an [[armored car]], and overpowers Spider-Man. Captain Stacy later informs Peter and [[Aunt May]] that Marko is the one who killed [[Benjamin Parker|Ben Parker]], and a vengeful Peter waits for Marko to strike again. The symbiote bonds with his costume while he is asleep; Peter discovers that not only has his costume changed, but his powers have been enhanced as well. The black suit also alters Peter's personality, making him more violent, exemplified by a near lethal attack on Marko during a battle underground.

The shift in Peter's personality alienates Mary Jane, whose stage career is floundering, and she finds solace with Harry. Harry recovers from his amnesia, and, urged on by an apparition of his dead father, forces MJ to break up with Peter. After Mary Jane leaves Peter, stating she is in love with another man, Harry meets him at a restaurant and claims to be the other man. Later, Peter finds him at the Osborn mansion. With the help of the black suit, Peter is victorious in a brutal fight, which leaves Harry's face disfigured. Influenced by the suit, Peter exposes and humiliates [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Eddie Brock Jr.]], a rival freelance photographer, who has sold fake pictures to the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' supposedly showing Spider-Man to be a criminal. 

In an effort to make MJ jealous, Peter brings Gwen to the nightclub where Mary Jane works. Peter gets into a fight with the club's bouncers and accidentally knocks MJ to the floor. Peter realizes the symbiote-suit is changing him for the worse. He runs out of the nightclub and goes to a church [[bell tower]] to be rid of it. Initially he is unable  to pull <!--Note:Brock is never called Venom in the film. Please see discussion on talk page about including his name, and the others' names.!--> the suit off, but the [[sound]] of the church bell weaken the symbiote, enabling Peter to break free. Eddie Brock is at the same church praying for Peter’s death when the symbiote falls from the tower and takes over his body. The newly-empowered Eddie finds Marko and suggests that they join forces to destroy Spider-Man.

The pair use Mary Jane as bait to force Spider-Man to confront them. Peter approaches Harry for help, but is turned down. However, Harry learns the truth about his father's death from his butler Bernard, and arrives in time to rescue Peter, teaming up against Brock and Marko. As the fight progresses, Brock attempts to impale Peter with the glider, but Harry sacrifices himself and is fatally wounded. Peter recalls how the church bell's toll weakened the symbiote, and frees Eddie from it by clanging several pipes together. Peter throws a pumpkin bomb at the symbiote just as Eddie attempts to rebond with it, killing him and destroying the symbiote.

After the battle, Marko tells Peter that he had no intention of killing Ben Parker, and that it was an accident born out of a desperate attempt to save his daughter's life. Peter forgives Flint, who dissipates and floats away. Peter and Harry forgive each other, before Harry dies with Mary Jane and Peter at his side. After Harry's funeral, Peter and Mary Jane begin to mend their relationship.

==Production==
===Development===
In March 2004, with ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' being released the coming June, [[Marvel Studios]] had begun developing ''Spider-Man 3'' for a release in 2007.<ref>{{cite news | author=Nicole Laporte | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117901100.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Spidey spins web for a third time | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2004-03-02]] | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref> By the release of ''Spider-Man 2'', a release date for ''Spider-Man 3'' had been set for [[May 2]], [[2007]] before production on the sequel had begun.<ref>{{cite news | author=Gabriel Snyder | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117907347.html?categoryid=10&cs=1 | title=Spidey swings to new heights | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2004-07-05]] |  accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref> The date was later changed to [[May 4]] [[2007]].

| style="text-align: left;" | "The most important thing Peter right now has to learn is that this whole concept of him as the avenger or him as the hero, he wears this red and blue outfit, with each criminal he brings to justice he's trying to pay down this debt of guilt he feels about the death of Uncle Ben. He considers himself a hero and a sinless person versus these villains that he nabs. We felt it would be a great thing for him to learn a little less black and white view of life and that he's not above these people."

===Filming===
Camera crews spent ten days from [[November 5]] [[2005]] to [[November 18]] [[2005]], to film sequences that would involve intense [[visual effects]] so [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] could begin work on the shots early in the project. The same steps had been taken for ''Spider-Man 2'' to begin producing visual effects early for sequences involving the villain [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref name="photo">{{cite news | author=Grant Curtis | url=http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/spiderman3/blog/archives/2006/07/welcome_back.php | title=Grant Curtis - Welcome back | publisher=Spider-Man 3 Movie Blog | date=[[2006-07-28]] | accessdate=2006-08-19 }}</ref>
