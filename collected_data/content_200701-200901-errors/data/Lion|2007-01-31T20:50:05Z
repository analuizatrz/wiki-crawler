The '''lion''' (''Panthera leo'') is a [[mammal]] of the family [[Felidae]] and one of four "[[big cat]]s" in the [[genus]] ''[[Panthera]]''. The lion is the second largest feline species, after the [[tiger]]. The male lion, easily recognized by his [[mane]], weighs between 150-250 kg (330-550 lb). Females range 120-150 kg (260-330 lb).<ref>{{cite web | title=BBC - Science & Nature - Wildfacts - Lion | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/14.shtml | accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref> In the wild, lions live for around 10&ndash;14 years, while in captivity they can live over 20 years. Though they were once found throughout much of Africa, Asia and Europe, lions presently exist in the wild only in [[Africa]] and [[India]].

==Population and distribution==
[[Image:Map Guj Nat Parks Sanctuary.png|thumb|right|The Gir Forest in the State of Gujarat, India is the last natural habitat of the 300 odd wild Asiatic Lions. Plans are afoot to re-introduce some to Palpur-Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in the neighboring State of Madhya Pradesh in India.]]
[[Image:Lion_distribution.svg|thumb|left|Distribution map of lions in Africa]]

In historic times the habitat of lions spanned the southern parts of [[Eurasia]], ranging from [[Portugal]] to [[India]], and most of [[Africa]] except the central [[rain forest]]-zone and the [[Sahara]] desert. Around the beginning of the current [[era]] they died out from [[Western Europe]] and they had become extinct in Greece by [[AD]] [[100]]. In the [[Caucasus]], their last European outpost, lions were found until the [[10th century]]. Between the late [[19th century]] and early [[20th century]] they also became extinct from [[North Africa]] and [[Middle East]]. Now, most of the population lives in eastern and southern [[Africa]], and their numbers are rapidly decreasing, estimated as between 16,000 and 30,000 living in the wild, down from an estimated 100,000 in the early 1990s. The population is even more in jeopardy, because the remaining populations are often geographically isolated from each other, which causes [[inbreeding]]. [http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/vanishinglions/]

The [[Asiatic Lion]] (''Panthera leo persica''), which in historical times ranged from [[Turkey]] to [[India]] through [[Iran|Iran (Persia)]] and from [[Caucasus]] to [[Yemen]], was eradicated from [[Palestine]] by the [[Middle Ages]] and from most of the rest of Asia after the arrival of readily available firearms in the 18th century. In Iran the last lion was shot in 1942. The subspecies now survives only in and around the [[Gir Forest]] of northwestern [[India]]. About 300 lions live in a 1412 km² (558 [[square mile]]s) sanctuary in the state of [[Gujarat]], which covers most of the forest. Their numbers remain stable.

Until the late [[pleistocene]] lions were also found in the [[Americas]] and in northern [[Eurasia]]. The most famous of these prehistoric subspecies were the [[Cave Lion]] (''Panthera leo spelaea'') and the [[American Lion]] (''Panthera leo atrox''), (not to be confused with the [[Cougar]] which is also known as the Mountain Lion).
[[Image:Lions_Etosha_NP_Fight_for_Prey.jpg|thumb|right|Lions in [[Etosha National Park]] fight for prey]]

== Diet and hunting ==
Lions usually hunt at night or dawn. Their prey consists mainly of large mammals, such as [[antelope]]s, [[gazelle]]s, [[warthogs]], [[wildebeest]], [[African buffalo|buffalo]]s and [[zebra]]s, but smaller animals like hares and birds are also taken occasionally. Their diet consists of only about 20 different species. Carrion is readily taken and often recovered from other predators like [[hyena]]s and [[wild dog]]s. In some areas lions specialise on rather atypical prey-species; this is the case at the [[Savuti]] river, where they constantly prey on young [[elephant]]s, and at the [[Linyanti River|Linyanti]], where they hunt [[hippo]]s (both rivers are in [[Chobe National Park]], [[Botswana]]). It is reported that the lions, driven by extreme hunger, started taking down baby elephants, then moved on to adolescents and occasionally fully grown adults [http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20547955-38195,00.html]. 
[[Image:Lioness-in-the-Serengeti.JPG|thumb|right|Lioness in the [[Serengeti National Park]], [[Tanzania]]]]
Young lions first try hunting at three months old, but are often not successful hunters until they are two years old.

Lions can reach speeds of about 60 km/h (37 mph), but they don't have the endurance to be long-distance runners, so they have to come quite close to their prey before starting the attack. They sneak up to the victim until they reach a distance of about 30 m (98 feet) or less. Usually several lions work together and encircle the herd from different points. The attack is short and powerful and the lion tries to catch the victim with a fast rush and some final leaps. The prey is usually killed by a bite into the [[nape]] or throat.
‎[[Image:Natgeo-lion2.jpg|thumb|right|Lions drinking in the [[Jubba River]], [[Somalia]]]]
Because lions hunt in open spaces, where they are easily seen by their prey, teamwork increases the likelihood of a successful hunt. Teamwork also enables them to defend their prey more easily against other large predators like [[hyena]]s, which can be attracted by vultures over kilometers in open savannas.
The males attached to prides do not usually participate in hunting, except in the case of large animals such as buffalo. 

An adult female lion needs about 5 kg (11 lbs) meat per day, a male [[circa|ca.]] 7 kg (15 lbs).

==Social behavior==
[[Image:Lions lying.jpg|thumb|right|Male lions spend most of their life resting.]]
[[Image:Pride_of_lions.JPG|thumb|right|Pride of lions on the move, Massai Mara, Kenya.]]
Lions are [[predator|predatory]] [[carnivore]]s who manifest two types of social organization. Some are ''residents,'' living in groups, called ''prides.'' The pride consists of related females, their cubs of both sexes, and a group of one to four males known as a ''coalition'' who mate with the adult females. Others are ''nomads,'' ranging widely, either singly or in pairs.

Being smaller and lighter than males, lionesses are more agile and faster and do the pride's hunting, while the stronger males patrol the territory and protect the pride, for which they take the "lion's share" of the females' prey. When resting, lions seem to enjoy good fellowship with lots of touching, head rubbing, licking and purring. But when it comes to food, each lion looks out for itself. Squabbling and fighting are common, with adult males usually eating first, followed by the females and then the cubs.

Both males and females will defend the pride against intruders. Some individual lions consistently lead the defense against intruders, while others lag behind.  (Heinsohn and Packer 1995).  These “laggards” are not punished by leaders.  Possibly laggards provide other services to the group so that leaders forgive them (Morrell 1995).   An alternative hypothesis is that there is some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders (Jahn 1995). 

Typically, males will not tolerate outside males, and females will not tolerate outside females. Males are expelled from the pride or leave on their own when they reach maturity.

Lions spend a lot of their time resting. They are inactive for about 20 hours per day.

==Reproduction and sexuality==   
[[Image:African Lion Panthera leo krugeri Male and Female 2200px.jpg|thumb|right|Male and female African Lion (''Panthera leo krugeri'')]]
Lions do not have a specific time of year where they mate and the females are [[Estrous cycle#Frequency|polyestrous]].
During a mating bout, which could last several days, the couple frequently copulate twenty to forty times a day  and are likely to forgo hunting. At times the female may couple with other males in the pride, giving rise to the possibility of different cubs in the same litter having different fathers. In captivity, lions reproduce very well.

The gestation lasts between one hundred and one hundred twenty days, and the female gives birth to a litter of one to four cubs. The females in a pride will synchronize their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young, who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. Cubs are weaned after six to seven months. In the wild, competition for food is fierce, and as many as 80% of the cubs will die before the age of two.

When a new male (or a coalition) takes over a pride and ousts the previous master(s), the conquerors often kill any remaining cubs. This is explained by the fact that the females would not become fertile and receptive until the cubs grow up or die. The male lions reach maturity at about 3 years of age and are capable of taking over another pride at 4-5 years old. They begin to age (and thus weaken) at around 8. This leaves a short window for their own offspring to be born and mature &mdash; the fathers have to procreate as soon as they take over the pride. Sometimes a female may defend her and the ousted male's children from the new master, but such actions are rarely successful, as he usually kills all the previous top male's cubs that are less than two years old.<ref>[http://www.honoluluzoo.org/lion.htm Honolulu Zoo lion information page]</ref>

Observers have reported that both males and females may interact [[Animal sexuality|homosexually]].<ref>Bruce Bagemihl, ''Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity,'' St. Martin's Press, 1999; pp.302-305. In his discussion of lion same-sex relations, Bagemihl is making use of published work by: J.B. Cooper, "An Exploratory Study on African Lions" in ''Comparative Psychology Monographs'' 17:1-48; R.L. Eaton, "The Biology and Social Behavior of Reproduction in the Lion" in Eaton, ed. ''The World's Cats,'' vol.II; pp.3-58; Seattle, 1974; G.B.

A study found that about 8% of mountings have been observed to occur be with other males, while female pairings are held to be fairly common in captivity but have not been observed in the wild.

==Physical characteristics==
[[Image:Comparative_view_of_the_human_and_lion_frame,_Benjamin_Waterhouse_Hawkins,_1860.jpg|thumb|right|Comparative view of the human and lion frames, c1860.]]
The male lion, easily recognized by his [[mane]], can weigh between 150-225 kg (330-500 lb), but usually most males average around 186 kg (410 lb) and females range from 120-150 kg (260-330 lb)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/14.shtml|title=BBC Wildfacts – Lion}}</ref>, and average around 125 kg (275 lb). Head and body length is 170 to 250 cm (5'7" to 8'2") in males and 140 to 175 cm (4'7" to 5'9") in females, shoulder height is about 123 cm (4') in males and 100 cm (3'3") in females. The tail length is 70 to 100 cm (2'3" to 3'3"). <ref>Ronald M. Nowak: ''Walker's Mammals of the World''. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999 ISBN 0-8018-5789-9</ref>
In the wild, lions live for around 10&ndash;14 years, while in captivity they can live over 20 years. 

The coloration varies from light buff to yellowish, reddish or dark ochraceous brown. The underparts are generally brighter and the hairy tuft at the tip of the tail is black. The colour of the manes varies from blond to black.

===Manes===
[[Image:wiki_lion.jpg|thumb|250px|Thermographic image of a lion in wintertime.]]
In the past scientists believed that the "distinct" subspecific status of some subspecies  could be justified by their external [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], like the size of their mane. This morphology was used to identify them, like the [[Barbary lion]] and [[Cape Lion|Cape lion]]. However, now it is known that various [[extrinsic]] factors influence the colour and size of a lion’s mane, like the [[ambient temperature]].<ref>West P.M., Packer C. 2002. Sexual selection, temperature, and the lion’s mane. Science, 297, 1339–1343. </ref> The cooler ambient temperature in e.g. European and North American zoos can result in heavy mane. Therefore, the heavy mane is an inappropriate marker for identifying subspecies.<ref>Barnett, R., N. Yamaguchi, I. Barnes & A. Cooper. 2006. Lost populations and preserving genetic diversity in the lion ''Panthera leo'': Implications for its ''ex situ'' conservation. Conservation Genetics. [http://abc.zoo.ox.ac.uk/Papers/consgen06_lion.pdf Online full-text pdf]</ref><ref>Yamaguchi, N. & Haddane, B. (2002). The North African Barbary lion and the Atlas Lion Project. International Zoo News 49: 465-481.</ref>

Maneless lions have been reported in Senegal and [[Tsavo-National Park]]. As well as having an inherited component, the presence, absence and degree of mane is also associated with sexual maturity and testosterone production.  Castrated lions have minimal manes. The original male white lion from Timbavati was also maneless. Manelessness is also found in inbred lion populations; inbreeding also results in poor fertility.  A heavy mane may provide an indicator of a lion's genetic and physical health.  It may also afford him some protection in fights.  In some animal species, females show a preference for males with better outward displays of fertility and vigour.  It is possible that lionesses more actively solicit mating with heavily maned lions in prides led by a coalition of 2 or 3 males, though there seem to be no published studies.

== Evolution ==

The oldest fossil record of cat, which strongly resembles a lion, is known from Laetoli in [[Tanzania]] and is perhaps 3.5 million years old. Some scientists identify the material as ''Panthera leo''. However, these records are not well substantiated, and all that can be said is, that they pertain to a ''Panthera''-like felid. The oldest confirmed records of ''Panthera leo'' in Africa are about 2 Ma younger<ref> Lars Werdelin:  ''Plio-Pleistocene Carnivora of eastern Africa: species richness and turnover patterns'', Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, Volume 144, Issue 2, Page 121 - June 2005 [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1096-3642.2005.00165.x online]</ref>.
700,000 years ago ''Panthera leo'' appeared in Europe for the first time with the subspecies ''[[Panthera leo fossilis]]'' at [[Isernia]] in Italy. From this lion derived the later [[Cave lion]]  (''Panthera leo spelea''), which appears about 300,000 years ago. During the upper [[Pleistocene]] the lion spread to North- and South-America, and developed here into ''Panthera leo atrox'', the [[American lion]].<ref>A. Turner: ''The big cats and their fossil relatives''. Columbia University Press, 1997.ISBN 0-231-10229-1</ref>

Lions were common in northern [[Eurasia]] and America during the upper pleistocene, but died out there at the end of the last [[glaciation]], about 10.000 years ago.

The major differences between lion subspecies are location, mane appearance, size and distribution. However some of the forms listed below are debatable. Genetic evidence suggests that all modern lions derived from one common ancestor only circa 55,000 years ago. Mitochondrial variation in recent african lions is modest, what suggests that all sub-Saharan lions could be considered a single subspecies, possibly divided in two main-clades. One to the west of the [[Great Rift Valley]] and the other to the east. For example lions from [[Tsavo]] (East-Kenia) differ genetically hardly from lions in [[Transvaal]] (South africa), but differ considerable from those in the [[Aberdare Range]] in Western Kenia.<ref>Ross Barnett et al.: ''The origin, current diversity and future conservation of the modern lion (Panthera leo)''.

'''1.''' The Marozi, a spotted lion, is sometimes believed to be a distinct subspecies (''Panthera leo maculatus''), but may be an adult lion that has retained its juvenile spotted pattern.  If it was a subspecies in its own right, rather than a small number of aberrantly colored individuals, it has been extinct since 1931.  A less likely identity is a natural leopard/lion [[Panthera hybrid|hybrid]] commonly known as a [[leopon]].

==Variations==  
[[image:White_Lion.jpg|thumb|right|150px|White lion male (subspecies ''Panthera leo krugeri'')]]
A number of natural variations have been observed in the lion populations. Some of these have been encouraged by captive breeding.

===White lions===
{{main|White lion}}
Although rare, white lions are occasionally encountered in Timbavati, [[South Africa]]. Their unusual color is due to a [[recessive gene]]. A white lion has a disadvantage when it comes to hunting: it can be given away by its color, unlike the regular lion which blends in with its surroundings.  White lions are born almost pure white without the normal [[camouflage|camouflagin]]g spots seen in lion cubs. Their colour gradually darkens to cream or ivory colour (known as blonde).

===Cross-breeding lions with other big cat species===
{{further|[[panthera hybrid]], [[liger]] and [[tigon]]}}
[[Image:bertramliger.jpg|thumb|right|A [[liger]] is the offspring of a male lion and female tiger]]
Lions have also been known to [[breeding|breed]] with [[tiger]]s (most often Amur and Bengal) to create hybrids called [[liger]]s and [[tigon]]s. They have also been crossed with leopards to produce [[leopon]]s and jaguars to produce [[jaglion]]s.  The [[marozi]] is reputedly a spotted lion or a naturally occurring leopon, while the [[Congolese spotted lion]] is a complex lion/jaguar/leopard hybrid called a [[lijagulep]]. Such hybrids were once commonly bred in zoos, but this is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conserving species and subspecies.  Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in China.

The [[liger]] is a cross between a male lion and a [[tiger|tigress]]. Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the corresponding growth-inhibiting gene from the female lion is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers are often fertile. Male have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but if they grow one the mane will be modest, around 50% again of a pure lion mane.

The less common [[tigon]] is a cross between the lioness and the male tiger. Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene, tigons are often relatively small, only weighing up to 150 [[kilograms]] (350 lb), which is about 20% smaller than lions. Like ligers, they have physical and behavioural traits from both parental species and males are sterile.

==Attacks on humans==
{{verify}}
While lions usually don´t attack humans, some (usually male) lions seem to seek out human prey. Some of the more publicized cases include the [[Tsavo maneaters]] and the [[Mfuwe]] man-eater. In both cases the hunters who killed the lions wrote books detailing the lions' "careers" as man-eaters. In [[folklore]], man-eating lions are sometimes considered [[demon]]s.

The Mfuwe and Tsavo incidents did bear some similarities. The lions in both the incidents were all larger than normal, lacked manes and seemed to suffer from [[tooth decay]]. Some have speculated that they might belong to an unclassified species of lion, or that they may have been sick and could not have easily caught prey.

There have also been recorded attacks on humans by lions in captivity; tigers in captivity are statistically much more likely to attack humans. Wild lions are also much less likely to attack humans than wild tigers are.

Other contemporary research shows that lion-human conflict may be on the rise. Gnoske and Peterhans suggests that we should be surprised not that lions attack and kill humans but that such few incidents occur.  The stereotype of injury and age being the main causes of man-eating behavior are largely debunked by the two men. (See: 
The science of ‘Man-eating’* among lions (Panthera leo) with a reconstruction of the natural history of the “Man-eaters of Tsavo”  Julian C. Kerbis Peterhans1 and Thomas Patrick Gnoske  [http://www.man-eater.info/gpage6.html]) 

Also, Professor Craig Packer of the University of Minnesota and Tanzanian scientist Dennis Ikanda authored an important paper in "Nature" in 2006 that showed man-eating behavior in rural areas of Tanzania had increased greatly from 1990 through 2005. More than 500 villagers were attacked and many eaten in this time period -- a number far exceeding the more famed "Tsavo" incidents of a century and more earlier. The problem, near Selous National Park in Rufijji Province and in Lindi Province near the Mozambican border. While some of these problems are no doubt caused by the expansion of villagers into bush country, the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the problem because conservation policies contribute directly to human deaths.  Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the center of substantial villages. 

Author Robert R. Frump also wrote in 2006 that Mozambican refugees crossing Kruger National Park at night in South Africa regularly are attacked and eaten by the lions there.  Park officials conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night.  Mozambicans had for nearly a century before the border was sealed regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm. (See www.man-eater.info) 

Generally, westerners do not understand the toll that animal-human conflict takes on human lives and crops in Africa.  Packer estimates more than 200 Tanzanians are killed each year by lions, crocodiles, elephants, hippos and snakes, and that the numbers could be double that amount. Lions are thought to kill about 70 humans per year at least in Tanzania, Packer and Ikanda note.  Packer and Ikanda are among the few conservations who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters not just because of ethical concerns about human life but for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservations.

A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004. It is believe to have killed and eaten at least 35 people in a series of incidents covering several villages in the Rufiji Delta coastal region. Dr Rolf Baldus, the GTZ wildlife programme coordinator is reported to have commented that it was likely that the lion preyed on humans because it had a large abscess underneath a molar which was cracked in several places. He further commented that "This lion probably experienced a lot of pain, particularly when it was chewing." GTZ is the German development cooperation agency and has been working with the Tanzanian government on wildlife conservation for nearly two decades. Like in other cases this lion was large, lacked a mane, and had a tooth problem. (See these links [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3756180.stm] and [http://www.ippmedia.com/ipp/guardian/2006/08/28/73305.html] for additional information)

The "All-Africa" record of man-eating generally is considered to be not Tsavo, but the lesser known incidents in the late 1930s through the late 1940s in what was then Tanganyika (now Tanzania.)  George Rushby, game warden and professional hunter, eventually dispatched the pride, which over 3 generations, is thought to have killed and eaten 1,500 to 2,000 in what is now Njombe district.  

Tsavo and Patterson body counts vary from a pretty firm 28 up to 140.  While some authors disparage the actual number, it should be kept in mind that Patterson kept firm records of skilled-labor killed by the lions, not indigenous Africans.  The toll could easily have been much higher.
