'''VKhUTEMAS''' ({{lang-ru|ВХУТЕМАС, Высшие художественно-технические мастерские}} [[acronym]] for Higher Art and Technical Studios) was the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in [[Moscow]]. The workshops had artistic and industrial faculties, the art faculty taught courses in graphics, sculpture and architecture; the industrial faculty taught courses in printing, textiles, ceramics, woodworking, and metalworking.<ref>T. V. Kotovich, ''Encyclopedia of the Russian Avantgarde'', Minsk: Ekonompress, 2003, page 83.</ref> In 1926 its name was modified: "Institute" instead of "Studios" (ВХУТЕИН, Высший художественно-технический институт), or Vkutein. It was dissolved in [[1930]].

VKhUTEMAS was closely parallel to the [[Germany|German]] [[Bauhaus]] in its intent, organization and scope.  Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a Basic Course in aesthetic principles, courses in color theory, industrial design, and architecture.  Both schools flourished in a relatively liberal period, and were closed under pressure from increasingly totalitarian regimes. [[Hannes Meyer]], the second Bauhaus director, tried to organise an exchange between the two schools.

Though the title of professor was not given,<ref>Martin H. Hammer, Christina Lodder, ''Constructing Modernity: The Art and Career of Naum Gabo'', Yale University Press, 2000, page 73, ISBN 0300076886</ref> those who taught at the school were significant figures in Soviet philosophy, art and architecture of the period, most of them associated with [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]]: [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Varvara Stepanova]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Vladimir Andreevic]], [[Aleksandr Larionov]], [[Vladimir Favorsky]], [[Konstantin Melnikov]], [[Vasily Kandinsky]], [[Naum Gabo]], [[El Lissitzky]], [[Nikolai Ladovsky]],  [[Moisei Ginzburg]], [[Meer Akselrod]] and [[Gustav Klutsis]].
