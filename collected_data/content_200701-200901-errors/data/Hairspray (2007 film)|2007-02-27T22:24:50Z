'''''Hairspray''''' is a film adaptation of the [[musical theatre|Broadway musical]] of the [[Hairspray (musical)|same name]]. The Broadway musical was made after the [[Hairspray (film)|1988 film]]; thus the 2007 film is not technically a direct remake of the 1988 film but rather is an adaptation of the Broadway musical, which, in turn, was an adaptation of the 1988 film. The cast includes [[John Travolta]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Nicole Blonsky]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Amanda Bynes]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Zac Efron]], and [[James Marsden]]. The 2007 film is produced by Zadan/Meron Productions in the [[United States]] and will be distributed by [[New Line Cinema]].

==Plot synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
Set in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in the [[1960s]], a "pleasantly plump" high school overweight adolescent, Tracy Turnblad ([[Nicole Blonsky]]) goes from being an outsider to celebrity trendsetter. It is the story of a girl, Tracy, whose dream is to dance on the ''Corny Collins Show'', a local TV dance program based on the real-life ''[[Buddy Dean Show]]'' in Baltimore. She gets a chance on the show and becomes a celebrity overnight, and launches a campaign to racially integrate the ''Corny Collins Show''. Gladly, she has the help from her mother Edna ([[John Travolta]]), father Wilbur ([[Christopher Walken]]), local [[African-American]] DJ Motormouth Maybelle ([[Queen Latifah]]), and Motormouth's kids Seaweed ([[Elijah Kelley]]) and Lil' Inez ([[Taylor Parks]]), but she also has to deal with the constant "raggings-on" of rival dancer Amber Von Tussle ([[Brittany Snow]]) and her mother Velma ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]) who will stop at nothing to see that Tracy fails in her efforts. However, after referring to Tracy, in front of Corny Collins ([[James Marsden]]) as a "Trash-Can," Amber is given demerit points and loses her on-air crush, Link Larkin ([[Zac Efron]]), to Tracy.

==Production==
An open casting call was announced to cast unknowns in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[New York City]], and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. Parks was chosen for the role of Lil' Inez, and Blonsky and Kelley were chosen to play Tracy and Seaweed.

Filming took place in [[Toronto]], and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] from [[September 5]] to [[December 8]], [[2006]]<ref name="canada">{{cite web | title=Canada.com | work=Summer of stars | url=http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=9f391590-9a3f-4f6e-90da-e8328b66219c&k=14936 | accessdate=June 25 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>, with the rest of the production and location settings being done in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] (the film's setting) in-between and after the Canadian scenes. The majority of the filming was done in Canada rather than Baltimore because of lower costs in Canada and because Canada was better equipped with the soundstages needed to film a musical. They will also do some of the post-production, including some of the musical numbers, in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. [[Lord Landsdowne P.S]] was a location where the movie was flimed

Scenes in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], were shot between [[November 22]] to [[December 2]] at the old Queen Victoria School. The school is scheduled to be demolished after film production is completed.
On the movie's official blog it stated that the movie will go into theatres on July 20, 2007.

==Trivia== 
<!-- Please do not add more into this section. -->
 [[Image:John_Waters_Hairspray.jpgâ€Ž|thumb|[[John Waters]]]]	 
*The movie's logo and colors were very similar to the 1988 film's logo and the Broadway show's logo colors when it was unveiled by New Line in the summer of 2006, but the studio has since modified it with a new logo as a way to distinguish the new film from both the original film and the musical.
	 
*[[John Waters]], the director of the original ''Hairspray'' film (in which he played a deranged psychologist that tried to "cure" Penny Pingleton), will be making a cameo in the 2007 version as the "flasher who lives next door".
 	 
*[[Ricki Lake]], who played Tracy Turnblad in the 1988 version, will also make a cameo as a William Morris talent agent who appears at the Miss Teenage Hairspray 1962 pageant. 
	 
*[[Jerry Stiller]] played Wilbur Turnblad (Tracy's father and Edna's husband) in the 1988 film but will be playing Mr. Pinky in the 2007 film.
 	 
*On the official "Hairspray Blog", it lists the names of the new Council Members. Coincidentally, some of the names include Jessie, Becky, Joey and Vicki; all which are the names of characters on [[Full House]].

*USA TODAY falsely reported that Original Broadway Tracy Turnblad, [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]] would make a cameo. However that information is incorrect.

*PlayAlong toys will be releasing a line of fashion dolls of characters from the movie. The good thing about them is that they will be "singing dolls". They will sing clips of the character's main song from the film. They will be released around the time of the movie retailed at about $14.99 - $24.99.
