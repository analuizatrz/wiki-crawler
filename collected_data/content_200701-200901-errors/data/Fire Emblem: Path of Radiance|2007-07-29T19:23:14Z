{{nihongo|'''''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'''''|ファイアーエムブレム 蒼炎の軌跡|Faiā Emuburemu: Sōen no Kiseki}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[tactical role-playing game]] developed by [[Intelligent Systems|Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd.]] and published by [[Nintendo Co., Ltd.]] for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] [[video game console]]. The game was released on [[April 20]], [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] in [[Japan]], [[October 17]], [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] in [[North America]], [[November 15]], [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] in [[Europe]] and [[December 1]], [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] in [[Australia]]. It is the ninth ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series title, the third ''Fire Emblem'' series title to be released in [[North America]], and the first ''Fire Emblem'' series title to be rendered in a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]], [[cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]] manner. It is also the first ''Fire Emblem'' game to be released for a home console in [[North America]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]].

A sequel to ''Path of Radiance'', ''[[Fire Emblem: Akatsuki no Megami]]'', was released in Japan for the [[Wii]] on February 22, 2007.

==Plot==

''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'' is set on a fictional continent called [[Tellius]]. The storyline is all-new, and is completely unrelated to any of the previous ''Fire Emblem'' titles in the series. The protagonist, [[Ike (Fire Emblem)|Ike]], the son of [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance#Major non-playable characters|Greil]], begins the game as the newest member of his father's mercenary company, the Greil Mercenaries. The company operates within the borders of Crimea, a nation of humans (referred to as "beorc") that shares its southern border with Gallia, a nation of beast laguz, or humanoids capable of transforming into animals. A few chapters into the game, a neighboring beorc nation, Daein, invades Crimea. Soon after, Ike comes across an unconscious woman in a forest that turns out to be the Crimean princess, [[Elincia Ridell Crimea]]. Faced with the ruthless Daein assault, Greil leads the mercenaries out of Crimea and towards Gallia, but is mortally wounded by a Daein general known only as the Black Knight. These events mark the beginning of a long journey that will take Ike, Elincia, and the mercenaries across the continent and back in an effort to defeat Daein and restore Crimea's royalty to the throne.

Over the course of the game, Ike and his companions must overcome long-held racial tensions between the beorc and laguz in order to form an alliance against their true enemy, [[Ashnard]], king of Daein. In particular, Ike manages to reestablish relations between the beorc nation of Begnion and the few remaining members of the heron laguz clan, which was annihilated in an act of [[genocide]] known as the [[Tellius#Serenes Massacre|Serenes Massacre]]. With this accomplishment, Ike is given command of a patchwork army that he leads into Daein and finally back to Crimea, where he confronts the Black Knight and ultimately King Ashnard himself. 

===The Fire Emblem===
In the fictional world of Tellius, the Fire Emblem takes the form of a simple bronze medallion also known as Lehran's Medallion. It holds the soul of an evil god whose energies disrupt the level of chaotic energy in a person. For example, when Greil touched the medallion, it caused him to go mad and kill everyone in sight, including his wife. It was only when she took the medallion from his hand in her final moments that Greil regained his sanity. Only a person with a high level of balance is capable of holding the medallion without losing his or her mind. Ike's mother, Elena, and his younger sister, Mist, are two such people.

The medallion once belonged to the Heron clans that dwelt in the Serenes Forest within Begnion. They were charged with protecting the medallion so that the evil god would not be released. However, the Serenes Massacre forced Lillia, a member of the Heron royal family, to flee with the medallion, only to be captured by Ashnard or his subordinates. Lillia was ordered to free the dark god, but she instead befriended Elena and gave the medallion to her. Mist eventually inherited it from her mother.

In the final chapter of "Difficult" difficulty (and "Maniac" in the Japanese version) [[Ashnard]] uses the medallion after his initial defeat and gains godlike power, but is somehow able to remain sane.

==Gameplay mechanics==
In comparison with previous ''Fire Emblem'' games, there are some changes to the [[Fire Emblem#Gameplay|game basics]].

===New race (Laguz)===
''Path of Radiance'' introduces the laguz changelings, humanoid creatures that can transform into powerful animals when their transformation gauge fills up. There are three species of laguz &mdash; beasts, birds, and dragons. These species are further divided into three classes each, although not all of them are playable. Beast laguz (of [[Tellius#Gallia|Gallia]]) are divided into cats, tigers, and lions; birds into ravens (of [[Tellius#Kilvas|Kilvas]]), hawks (of [[Tellius#Phoenicis|Phoenicis]]), and herons (of [[Tellius#Serenes Massacre|Serenes]]); and dragons (of [[Tellius#Goldoa|Goldoa]]) are divided into red, white, and black dragons. Unlike beorcs &mdash; the name for normal humans &mdash; laguz do not use manmade weapons and are thus unable to attack when not in animal form. When in animal form, laguz use the natural weapons of their species &mdash; claws for beasts, beaks for birds, and breath attacks for dragons. The natural weapons of a laguz will never break with use (unlike normal beorc weaponry). Each laguz species has an elemental weakness &mdash; fire for beasts, wind for birds, and thunder for dragons. Birds can fly in either form, but also have the weakness to bows associated with flying units.

===Class changing===
This installment of the ''Fire Emblem'' series, like the previous two released in the West, allows the player to change a unit's class once he or she reaches a certain level. However, unlike in the GBA games (which used specially designated items for promotion) a unit automatically promotes upon reaching level twenty-one. Players can also use the Master Seal item to immediately promote any unit at any point between levels ten to twenty.

===Skill system===
Skills, which have appeared in some ''Fire Emblem'' games, have different mechanics in this game. Each character has a capacity gauge that allows for mastery of skills. By using a skill scroll, the character learns the corresponding skill and a certain amount of slots are taken up in the capacity gauge, usually determined by how useful the skill is. The space of the capacity gauge varies between classes and characters. Any unit can learn any skill, with three exceptions. 
*The skill is preassigned to a unit and there is no scroll item capable of teaching it to others. 
*The skill is an occult skill. Occult skills are gained by using an occult scroll on any laguz or promoted beorc unit. The skill gained is specific to the unit's class &mdash; most notably, [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance#Ike|Ike's]] "Aether" and [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance#Volke|Volke's]] "Lethality".
*The skill is reserved for characters of a certain movement type. For example, the skill "Smite" increases the potency of the "Shove" command, which can only be used by non-mounted characters.

===Battle preparation===
''Path of Radiance'' is the first ''Fire Emblem'' game to feature a "Base screen" along with the "Battle Preparations" screen. Before the Base screen appears, [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance#Soren|Soren]] provides information on the previous battle, including the weapons and the distribution of bonus experience and skills. Furthermore, players can engage in [[Fire Emblem#Relationships|support conversations]] and the new "Info" conversations, chapter-specific conversations rated on a scale of one to three stars. One star denotes conversations that provide story background; two stars mark conversations that provide hints on how to proceed in the coming battle, and three stars indicate that the conversation may yield a special ability or new playable character.

[[Image:Base FE.jpg|thumb|200px|Screenshot of the base screen, using the Bonus Experience to level up [[List of Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance characters#Nephenee|Nephenee]].]]

===Experience===
Bonus Experience was introduced in the game. At the end of every chapter, Bonus Experience is awarded based on certain factors such as number of enemies remaining and turns taken to complete the chapter. It can be distributed to units at the Base Screen. This function can be helpful to strengthen units who are too weak to battle, or units that the player wishes to level up quickly. 

Another unique feature to ''Path of Radiance'' is Fixed mode, which changes how units gain stats when they level up. Random mode &mdash; the method used in all other titles in the series, as well as in the first playthrough of Path of Radiance &mdash; gives units a set percentage chance to increase a given stat upon level up. This chance is termed a "growth rate." Due to the "chance nature" of this system, a unit that levels up may gain many stat increases or none at all. In Fixed mode, units instead earn experience towards a stat increase as they earn standard experience. This "stat experience" is kept per stat, and if enough has been accumulated, that stat will increase the next time the unit gains a level and "stat experience" will return to zero; otherwise, it will carry over to the next level. Units earn stat experience based on their individual growth rates, which can be modified by what items a unit has equipped and the class of the enemy that it is attacking. Since Fixed mode has no random element, its results are predictable.

===Weapon forging===
The weapon forging system, introduced in this game, allows players to create improved versions of some of the weapons available in shops. Players can forge one weapon during every visit to the Base screen. To forge a weapon, the player first chooses a base weapon to modify. Choices of base weapon are initially limited, but more options become available as the player progresses through the game. The player can then increase or decrease several statistics of the weapon, such as strength and weight. The further away from the statistics of the base weapon, the higher the cost; making no changes to the base statistics results in the same price as the base weapon. After statistics are adjusted, the player can choose a new color for the weapon and give it a unique name. These features have no effect on price.

===Changes from Japanese version===
Releases outside of Japan omit the extremely hard "Maniac" mode, replacing it with "Easy" mode that is of lower difficulty than "Normal mode". Swordmasters, Berserkers and Snipers received an innate 15% critical boost, similar to those present in ''[[Fire Emblem (video game)|Fire Emblem]]'' and ''[[Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones]]''.<ref name="Localisation changes">{{cite news|title='Localisation changes 2'|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/elaice/local3a.html|accessdate=2007-07-25|date=2007-07-25|work=Serenes Forest}}</ref>

==Graphics engine==
''Path of Radiance'' is the first ''Fire Emblem'' title to feature three-dimensional graphics on the battlefield, replacing two-dimensional sprite animations and landscapes with fully rendered 3-D models. It is also the first game in the series to make use of [[full motion video]] to present cinematic sequences at key points in the game. The FMV sequences were animated by [[Production I.G.]].

In the Japanese version, there was voiced narration for all the overworld map scenes and the ending cinema.
However, the narration was mostly left out in the English version, leaving only the ending cinema narration.

==Musical score==
The ''Fire Emblem'' series' veteran music composer [[Yuka Tsujiyoko]] was actively involved in providing the musical score. ''Path of Radiance'' is the first ''Fire Emblem'' game to feature a theme song with vocals, "Life Returns," which is sung in the fictional language of the heron tribe.

==Reviews==
The game received mostly positive reviews after its release. Game Rankings, a website that provides video games with percentile scores based on the score average collected from a variety of review sources rated the game with an 86%, giving it a higher average ranking than [[Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones]].<ref name="Fire Emblem media rankings">{{cite news|title='Gamerankings'|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/920189.asp|accessdate=2007-07-25|date|work=[http://www.gamerankings.com/ Game Rankings]}}</ref>

The game was praised for its deep story, great battle scenes, excellent cinema cut-scenes, and orchestrated music. However, it was criticized for outdated in-game graphics and extended periods of dialogue (which is a common criticism for RPGs). 

The following is a sample of the positive review scores that ''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'' received upon its release in North America:

*[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]: 8.0, 8.5, 8.0 out of 10
*[[Nintendo Power]]: 9.5/10
