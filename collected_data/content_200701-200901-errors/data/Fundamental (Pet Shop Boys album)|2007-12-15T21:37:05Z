'''''Fundamental''''' is the sixteenth [[album]], the ninth of entirely new music, by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[musical ensemble|band]] [[Pet Shop Boys]]. It was released in [[May 2006]] in the United Kingdom, [[European Union|Europe]], [[Japan]], and [[Canada]], and was released in late [[June 2006]] in the [[United States]]. The album entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number five on [[28 May]] [[2006]] (see [[2006 in British music]]).

The album was produced by the Pet Shop Boys and [[Trevor Horn]] and it features eleven new Pet Shop Boys compositions, and "Numb," written by [[Diane Warren]] (Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe originally planned to have "Numb" be one of two new tracks on ''[[Pop Art: Pet Shop Boys - The Hits|PopArt]]'', but opted instead for "Miracles" and "Flamboyant").

The [[liner notes]] shows that the album is dedicated to two executed [[Iran]]ian teenagers, [[Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni]], who were hanged on July 19, 2005.  Some reports have suggested the two may have been executed for engaging in homosexual behavior, though others indicate they were hanged for raping a 13 year-old boy.

==Overview==
===Subject matter===
The album has been noted for being more political than any other of the duo's albums to date; even the title, in one sense, is a reference to religious [[fundamentalism]] &mdash; portrayed here in a light, critical manner, which singer [[Neil Tennant]] attributes to the relatively relaxed [[status of religious freedom in the United Kingdom]].<ref name="skrufff">{{cite web | author = Skrufff, Jonty | year = [[June 1]], [[2006]] | url = http://www.trustthedj.com/SKRUFFF/news_article.php?news_id=5452 | title = Pet Shop Boys interview | format = | work = News | publisher = ''Trust the DJ'' | accessdate = 2006-06-02 | accessyear = }}</ref>

Specific contemporary issues discussed in the lyrics include tensions and fears in the United States caused by the [[War on Terrorism]], addressed in songs such as "Psychological" and "Luna Park".<ref name="literally">{{cite web | author = | year = November 2005 | url = http://www.petshopboys.net/html/literallys/literally_29/Page1.html | title = Interview - Recording | format = | work = | publisher = ''Literally'' (Pet Shop Boys fanclub magazine) | accessdate = 2006-05-23 | accessyear = }}</ref> ("Luna Park" being the name of various [[amusement park]]s around the world; see [[Luna Park (disambiguation)|Luna Park]] for a list of such places). Other songs refer to the politics of the band's home country; "[[Indefinite leave to remain]]" refers to an immigration status in the United Kingdom, while "Integral" criticizes the [[British national identity card]] plans. (A statement from a band spokesman cites the issue as the reason that Tennant ceased his well-publicized support of [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].) The lyrics are fully masked and converted to the homage to [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]]'s legendary dystopian book "[[We (novel)|We]]", in which the inhabitants of the future One State try to build The Integral in order to solve the cosmic equation and resolve all the problems in their One State. "[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]", meanwhile, touches upon both countries by satirizing Blair's [[Tony Blair#Special relationship with the United States of America|alliance]] with [[George W. Bush]]. (See also [[special relationship]].)<ref name="eveningstandard">{{cite web | author = Teodorczuk, Tom | year = [[March 1]], [[2006]] | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/music/articles/21844071?source=Evening%20Standard | title = Pet Shop Boys' Labour snub | format = | work = | publisher = ''[[Evening Standard]]'' | accessdate = 2006-05-23 | accessyear = }}</ref>

Other subject matters are dealt with as well. "Casanova in Hell" is about the 18th century historical figure [[Giacomo Casanova]], and how he immortalized himself by writing [[memoir]]s about his history of [[Seduction|sexual seduction]] of numerous women. Tennant refers to, specifically, the book ''Casanova's Homecoming'' by [[Arthur Schnitzler]] as his inspiration for the song.<ref name="literally" /> (It was sung by [[Rufus Wainwright]] at its very first live performance, at a private concert recorded for [[BBC Radio 2]] at the [[Mermaid Theatre]] on [[May 8]], [[2006]].)<ref name="officialmay">{{cite web | author = | year = [[May 9]], [[2006]] | url = http://www.petshopboys.co.uk/news/archiveNewsBody.asp?SY=2006&SM=5 | title = PSB and BBC Concert Orchestra concert | format = | work = | publisher = Pet Shop Boys official website news | accessdate = 2006-05-28 | accessyear = }}</ref> "The Sodom and Gomorrah Show" references two of the biblical cities of sin, [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], in saying that to learn to 'go where angels fear to tread' (ie. to sin) is to learn to live freely.

===Music===
The album is Pet Shop Boys' first collaboration with [[Trevor Horn]] since the 1988 single "Left to My Own Devices". Its sound bears the producer's heavily [[orchestra]]l style (also present on that song), most frequently associated with the 1982 [[ABC (band)|ABC]] album ''[[The Lexicon of Love]]'' as well as the 1984 [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] single "[[Two Tribes]]" and subsequent album ''[[Welcome to the Pleasuredome]]''. Horn was also musical director for the Radio 2 concert, which featured the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]].<ref name="officialmay" />

The album's personnel included many of Horn's frequent musical collaborators, including [[Anne Dudley]], [[Tessa Niles]], [[Jamie Muhoberac]], [[Phil Palmer]], [[Steve Lipson]], [[Lalo Creme]], [[Tim Pierce]], [[Earl Harvin]], [[Frank Ricotti]], [[Luis Jardim]], [[Lucinda Barry]].<ref name="yesography">{{cite web | author = Potts, Henry | year = [[June 2]], [[2006]] | url = http://www.relayer35.com/Yescography/Fundamental.htm | title = ''Fundamental'' | format = | work = | publisher = Yescography | accessdate = 2006-09-06 | accessyear = }}</ref>

===''Fundamentalism''===
"In Private", here presented as a duet with [[Elton John]], was originally a [[Dusty Springfield]] song written and produced by the Pet Shop Boys. First released as a single in 1989, it was later included on the 1991 album ''[[Reputation (album)|Reputation]]''.

===''Fundamental'' (original track listing)===
On [[December 22]] [[2005]], the official Pet Shop Boys website announced an early track listing for the album and gave a release date of [[April 17]] [[2006]] with new single "Minimal" arriving a few weeks beforehand. This was quickly followed up on [[December 23]], when pop music fansite [[Popjustice]] gave the first review of the album [http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=146&Itemid=138]. The original proposed tracklisting was:

On [[February 13]] [[2006]], it was announced that the release date of ''Fundamental'' had been pushed back to May 22, because [[EMI]] needed "more set-up time". At the same time "I'm with Stupid" was announced to be the revised lead single. This was followed on [[April 4]] [[2006]], with news that there would be a limited edition of the new album that would include a bonus CD called ''Fundamentalism''.
