The '''I-35W Bridge''' is a deck-arch [[truss bridge]] that spans the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. It was built in [[1967]] by the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]].

The bridge is notable for not having any piers in the water.  Instead, the main support piers are located on the banks of the river, and are built of tubular-shaped concrete pillars.  This allows for a wide, clear span across the river, making river navigation easier.  Although not very decorative, the bridge is one of the widest bridges in the Twin Cities area and provides an important link for [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|Interstate 35W]] traffic.
