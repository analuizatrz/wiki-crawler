'''Coconut water''' is the liquid [[endosperm]] inside [[young coconut]]s. As the coconut matures this liquid largely becomes absorbed into the flesh found in mature coconuts. Coconut water has long been a popular drink in the [[tropics]], especially in Tropical [[Asia]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], where it is available fresh or bottled. It is naturally fat-free and low in [[food energy]] (16.7 [[Calorie|calories]] or 70 [[kilo-|kilo]][[Joule]]s per 100 [[grams]]). Due to its sterility, [[pH]], [[Dietary mineral|mineral]], and [[sugar]] content, coconut water had been successfully used as liquid in [[intravenous therapy]] in emergency situations {{Fact|date=September 2007}}.

Coconuts for drinking are packaged and sold in many places.  These are typically Thai coconuts whose outer green husk has been removed, and the remainder wrapped in plastic.  Coconut water can also be found in regular cans or [[tetra Pak|tetra paks]] (and often has coconut pulp or [[Young coconut|coconut jelly]] added) and is also marketed as a [[sports drink]] because of its high [[potassium]] and mineral content which helps the body recover from rigorous [[Physical exercise|exercise]].

Fresh coconuts for drinking should be young and green, and are generally still attached to the tree. While there are various preferences for the taste of coconut water, generally a green coconut with some age spots tastes good. Coconuts from various parts of the world also differ in taste.  For example, [[India|Indian]] coconuts tend to be salty and [[Brazil|Brazilian]] coconuts have a sweeter water and flesh.

Once the young coconut has been safely removed from the tree, cutting an end down with a knife so it is flat, and then sectioning out a center hole works well to access the juice. In young coconuts the juice may actually be under some pressure, and will spray slightly when the inner husk is first penetrated.  Despite high heat and sandy soil, coconuts can have a significant amount of liquid inside.  If a green coconut has fallen to the ground, check that insects or rats have not eaten or rotted the coconut, as evidenced by an obvious hole or a less obvious but significant dark brown rotted area, which makes the water inside taste bitter.
