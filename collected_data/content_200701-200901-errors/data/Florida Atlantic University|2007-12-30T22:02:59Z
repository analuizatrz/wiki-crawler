'''Florida Atlantic University''', also referred to as '''FAU''' or '''Florida Atlantic''', is a [[public university|public]], [[coeducation]]al [[research]] [[university]] with its main campus in [[Boca Raton]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. The university has six satellite campuses located in the Florida cities of [[Dania Beach, Florida|Dania Beach]], [[Davie, Florida|Davie]], [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]], [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]], and in [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]] at the [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]].<ref name="FAU Campuses"/> Florida Atlantic serves a seven-[[county]] region that has a populace of more than three million people and spans more than 100&nbsp;[[mile]]s (160&nbsp;km) of Florida's eastern coastline.<ref name="Release">{{cite press release | title =Early Detection of Developmental Disorders in Babies to be a Focus of New Infant Development Laboratory | publisher = Florida Atlantic University: University Communications and Marketing  | date = [[2005-09-22]] | url =http://wise.fau.edu/communications/pressarchive/2005-09/16.php | accessdate = 2006-08-22}}</ref>

The university opened its doors in 1964 as the first public university in [[South Florida| southeast Florida]] and the first university in the nation to offer only upper-division and graduate level courses.

==History==
===Establishment===
[[Image:FAU Alumni Plaza.jpg|right|thumb|The Alumni Plaza on the Boca Raton Campus of Floria Atlantic]]
On [[July 15]], [[1961]], to meet the burgeoning educational demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in the City of Boca Raton. Florida Atlantic University was built on a 1940s&ndash;era army airbase in Boca Raton. During World War II, the airfield served as the [[Army Air Corps]]' sole radar training facility. The base was built on the existing [[Boca Raton Airport]] and on 5,860&nbsp;acres (23.7&nbsp;km²) of adjacent land.<ref name="Morikami"/> A majority of the land was acquired from [[Japanese-American]] farmers from the failing [[Yamato Colony, Florida|Yamato Colony]]. The land was seized through [[eminent domain]], leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse in the early days of World War II.<ref name="Morikami">{{cite web | last = | first = | title =  The Yamato Colony: Japanese Pioneers in Florida | work = | publisher = The [[Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens]] | url = http://www.morikami.org/index.php?src=gendocs&link=YamatoColony | accessdate =2006-11-04}}</ref> 

The Boca Raton airbase was used for radar training, anti-submarine patrols along the coast, and as a stop-over point for planes being ferried to Africa and Europe via South America.  It had a troop strength of 16,000&nbsp;men, with approximately 1,200&nbsp;civilian workers. The airfield was composed of four runways, each stretching 5,200&nbsp;feet (1.58&nbsp;km) long, set in a triangle shape, with one runway bisecting the triangle. These runways are still visible on the Boca Campus today and are mainly used for parking. Over the course of the war, the airfield would grow to encompass more than 800&nbsp;buildings serving approximately 100,000&nbsp;airmen, including those who were aboard the [[Enola Gay]] when it dropped a [[nuclear weapon]] on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]].<ref name="B Historical Society">{{cite web | title =  A Journey Through Boca Raton: Timeline 1895&ndash;1999 | publisher = Boca Raton Historical Society | url = http://www.bocahistory.org/boca_history/br_history_timeline.asp | accessdate =2006-10-21}}</ref><ref name="Brogan Add">{{cite web | url = http://wise.fau.edu/inauguration/address.htm | title = In Celebration of Excellence: The Inaugural Address of Tai Houser | publisher = Florida Atlantic University | accessdate = 2006-08-22}}</ref> As the war drew to a close Boca Raton Army Airfield saw a steady decline in use. By the end of 1945, about only 100&nbsp;planes were stationed at the airbase.<ref name="Boca Airport 1">{{cite web | last = | first = | title =  The History of the Boca Raton Airport | work = | publisher = Boca Raton Airport Authority | url = http://www.bocaairport.com/history.shtml | accessdate =2006-10-21}}</ref><ref name="FAU Curl">{{cite book | last = Curl | first = Donald W | title = Florida Atlantic University | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | date = 2000 | location = Charleston, SC | pages = 12&ndash;13,15 | id =ISBN 978-0-7385-0614-2}}</ref> By early 1947, the military decided to transfer future radar training operations to Kessler Air Force Base in [[Mississippi]]. This decision was finalized when on [[September 17]], [[1947]], the [[Fort Lauderdale Hurricane]] struck South Florida. According to historian Donald Curl, "the 1947 storm caused extensive damage to the hurriedly-built frame structures of the base and was responsible for widespread flooding."<ref name="FAU Curl"/> These conditions led the [[us air force|Air Force]] to abandon the site earlier than originally planned.<ref name="FAU Curl"/> The departure of the air force in 1947 would leave Boca Raton Army Airfield essentially abandoned. Historian Roger Miller, who visited the airfield during this period, describes the airbase as having "a small operations office to check into and out of, a deteriorating and empty mess hall, and about twenty-odd other wooden buildings of World War II vintage."<ref name="FAU Miller">{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Roger H | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Florida Atlantic University: Its Beginnings And Early Years | publisher = Florida Atlantic University | date = 1989 | location = Boca Raton, FL | pages = 1&ndash;3 | url = | doi = | id =  }}</ref>

===Expansion and growth===
Florida Atlantic University opened on [[September 14]], [[1964]], with an initial student body of 867&nbsp;students in five colleges. The first degree awarded was an honorary doctorate given to [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] on [[October 25]], [[1964]].<ref name="History">{{cite web | url = http://www.fau.edu/explore/history.php| title = "Explore FAU History" | publisher = Florida Atlantic University | accessdate = 2007-09-20}}</ref> At the time of its opening, Florida Atlantic's faculty numbered 120 out of a total of 350&nbsp;employees. On-campus housing for students was first added in September 1965, when Algonquin Hall opened.<ref name="Legacy History">{{Citation | last =Burdick | first =Bob | title =All Grown Up: FAU Looks Back and Steps Forward | newspaper =Legacy: A Magazine for Alumni and Friends of Florida Atlantic University | pages = 14&ndash;15 | year =2007 | volume= 5 | issue=1 | year=2007 | date=September 2007}}</ref><ref name="Admissions Standards"/>

Florida Atlantic's history is one of continuing expansion as the university's service population has grown. The university originally served only upper-division and graduate level students, because Florida intended the institution "to complement the state's community college system, accepting students who had earned their associate degrees from those institutions."<ref name="Legacy History"/> Florida Atlantic began its expansion beyond a one-campus university in 1971, when it opened its Commercial Boulevard campus in [[Fort Lauderdale]]. Due to a rapidly expanding population in South Florida, in 1984 Florida Atlantic took another major step by opening its doors to undergraduate students. The following year, the university added its third campus, in downtown Fort Lauderdale on Las Olas Boulevard.

===Recent history===
[[Image:FAU Baldwin House.jpg|left|thumb|President Brogan's residence at Baldwin House on the Boca Raton Campus]]In 1989, the [[Florida Legislature]] recognized demands for higher education in South Florida by designating Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County. To fill this role, the university would establish a campus in [[Dania Beach]] in 1997 and another campus in the City of [[Davie, Florida|Davie]] in western [[Broward County]] in 1990. Florida Atlantic later purchased 50 acres (0.2&nbsp;km²) of land in  [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] in 1994 to establish a campus on the [[Treasure Coast]]. This would be the institution's fifth campus. The university continued its expansion in 1999 when it opened its [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]] Campus, named for the late [[John D. MacArthur]]. This campus currently houses the university's honors college.

Florida Atlantic has changed dramatically since its opening in 1964. As of 2007, there are approximately 26,000 students attending classes on seven campuses spread across 120&nbsp;miles (193&nbsp;km). The university consists of nine colleges and employs more than 3,600 faculty and staff. The university's endowment has also grown to $168 million, making it the fourth largest in the state.<ref name="Endowment">{{cite web | url = http://www.palmbeachpost.com/pbcsouth/content/local_news/epaper/2006/10/17/s1b_fauendow_1017.html?cxtype=rss&cxsvc=7&cxcat=17 | title = "Giving to FAU Fourth in State" | publisher = Palm Beach Post | accessdate = 2006-10-17}}</ref> Florida Atlantic is merging with the [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]] (HBOI) to become the HBOI at FAU.

The university offers two honors options: the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College and a University Scholars Program. The Wilkes Honors College is located on the John D. MacArthur campus in Jupiter, Florida. It offers a [[liberal arts college|liberal art education]] in the platform of a public university, yet is comparable to a private liberal arts college.<ref name="HC FAQ">{{cite web | title =General FAQ | publisher =Florida Atlantic University: Wilkes Honors College | url =http://www.fau.edu/divdept/honcol/about_general_faq.htm | accessdate =2007-10-10}}</ref> The Boca Raton campus houses the University Scholars Program, which offers special honors seminars, forums, courses, and advanced course substitution for freshman.

Florida Atlantic University's admission requirements have been traditionally considered low.<ref name="Trad Low">{{cite news | last =Travis | first =Scott | title =Region trails in college graduation rates | publisher =''South Florida Sun-Sentinel'' | date =[[2007-02-13]] | accessdate =2007-10-12}}</ref><ref name="Grades">{{cite news | last =Travis | first =Scott | title =FAU hopes tougher admissions standards will increase graduation rate | publisher =''South Florida Sun-Sentinel'' | date =[[2007-09-18]] | url =http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/palmbeach/sfl-flpenroll0918pnsep18,0,3684149.story | accessdate =2007-10-12}}</ref> Recently, however, the institution has begun gradually increasing standards to improve its graduation and retention rates. Starting in the summer of 2004, Florida Atlantic began denying entry to students with low GPAs and [[SAT]] scores. Prospective students were directed to take remedial courses at a community college to better prepare them for success at the university. The higher admissions standards required a 3.2&nbsp;[[GPA]] and an SAT score of at least 1000 for admittance in 2007. This increase was not without controversy. Critics argued it would place an even greater reliance on the already burgeoning local community college system. These colleges had turned away over 22,000&nbsp;people in 2004 and would be forced to turn away even more prospective students in the future.<ref name="Admissions Standards"/> It was announced in 2007 that university officials were again looking to raise admissions standards to improve the institution's success rates. Florida Atlantic's six-year graduation rate places it second lowest in the state university system at just 36.5%. While this is partly due to the fact that the university serves a large percentage of part-time students, data also show problems among traditional undergraduate students. In 2000, about 16% of freshmen dropped out within six years, while 25% transferred to a community college. Critics are again questioning the increase in standards, arguing since Florida Atlantic is also trying to increase its freshmen enrollment, it should focus on becoming more appealing to prospective students.<ref name="Grades"/>

For the 2007&ndash;2008 academic year, the average high school GPA for an entering freshman was 3.2, with a 1041 score on the SAT.<ref name="Facts"/> The university's average GPA of 3.3 for the 2006&ndash;2007 academic year was the second lowest of the 11&nbsp;universities in the state system.<ref name="Grades"/> The average class size for undergraduates is 33&nbsp;students, and for graduate classes, 12&nbsp;students. The student to faculty ratio is 19:1, with 98% of faculty employed full-time.<ref name="Student Faculty">{{cite news | last =Travis | first =Scott | title =Florida universities grow in number of students, but not in faculty, data shows | publisher =''South Florida Sun-Sentinel'' | date =[[2007-06-13]] | accessdate =2007-07-13}}</ref> The top three undergraduate majors by enrollment are [[Education|elementary education]], [[accounting]], and [[management]], respectively.

Florida Atlantic's main campus in [[Boca Raton]] was established on the remnants of a World War II American [[United States Army Air Corps|Army airbase]] in 1964. Spanning 850&nbsp;[[acres]] (3.5&nbsp;km²) near the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the site is located between the cities of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] and Fort Lauderdale. The campus was designated a [[burrowing owl]] sanctuary in 1971 by the [[Audubon Society]]. The owls find the campus appealing because there are few predators, due to the university's proximity to the Boca Raton Airport, and because the campus was originally cleared of vegetation when operating as an airbase during World War II. The feisty bird, traditionally associated with wisdom and determination, serves as the university's mascot.<ref name="FAU Trad">{{cite web | title =FAU Traditions | publisher =Florida Atlantic University: Athletics Department | url =http://fausports.cstv.com/trads/fau-trads.html | accessdate =2007-07-15}}</ref>

Another traditional competition between Florida Atlantic and Florida International is the annual [[Shula Bowl]].

For the 2006&ndash;2007 academic year, Florida Atlantic had approximately 150&nbsp;registered student organizations. Among the student organizations are 40&nbsp;academic organizations, 19&nbsp;honor societies, 18&nbsp;spiritual/religious organizations, 16&nbsp;diversity-appreciation organizations, 5&nbsp;service organizations, 25&nbsp;personal interest organizations, 12&nbsp;sports clubs, and 7&nbsp;student government agencies. These clubs and organizations run the gamut from [[sailing]] to [[Ultimate Frisbee]], from varsity and club sports and a [[jazz]] group to a [[pottery]] [[guild]], from political organizations to chess and video game clubs.<ref name="Club and Org List">{{cite web | title =2006&ndash;2007 Registered Club List | publisher =Florida Atlantic University: Student Development & Activities | url =http://wise.fau.edu/sda/clubs/clubs_index.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =2007-07-14}}</ref> These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which $10.00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund. This generates approximately $5.8&nbsp;million that is then given to [[student government#United States|student government]] for allocation to student clubs and organizations.
