'''''Ninja Gaiden''''' is a video game released for the [[Xbox]] featuring the Dragon Ninja, [[Ryu Hayabusa]]. The game was a revival of the [[Ninja Gaiden]] series and was released to very high critical and commercial success with an average of 94% being awarded for the later released Ninja Gaiden Black.

==Development==
The "Next-Generation Ninja Gaiden Project" began in [[1999]]; it was originally intended to be a game for the [[Sega NAOMI]] [[arcade system board]]. The game's development cycle was plagued by several delays and changes of platform: first to the [[Sega Dreamcast]], then as a launch title for the [[Playstation 2]] [http://www.gamespot.com/news/2450994.html?q=ninja%20gaiden%202]. Finally, in [[2001]] Tecmo announced that [[Ninja Gaiden]] would be exclusive to the [[Xbox]] gaming console, and the game was finally released for the Xbox in early [[2004]].

Two "Hurricane Packs" were released as downloadable content via the [[Xbox Live]] service. The first made the game even harder and featured various changes to the location of items and enemies, with unlockable costumes available. The second was part of a ''Master Ninja Tournament'', where players competed in a special set of levels to gain the highest "Karma" scores. As a honorary mention, the user names of the highest scoring participants of this tournament were put on display in the ending credits of ''[[Ninja gaiden black#Ninja Gaiden Black|Ninja Gaiden Black]]'', a further upgraded version released in [[2005]].

==Plot==
[[Image:Ninjagaiden220.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Ryu Hayabusa]] fights Murai, one of the bosses.]]
The Xbox ''Ninja Gaiden'' contains no story elements from the NES trilogy apart from minor references and recurring characters that play very similar roles to those of the original trilogy. This essentially makes it a reboot of the Ninja Gaiden "universe", although the story could be placed either before or after the events of the original trilogy. However, game director [[Tomonobu Itagaki]] commented in an interview that "Since this is a brand-new game, I prefer not to be influenced by or base it on the original story". <ref name="plot">{{cite news

===Summary===
The story revolves around the Dark Dragon Blade, which was sealed away and protected by warriors of the Dragon Lineage. Their descendants formed the Hayabusa ninja clan, and Ryu Hayabusa was one of them. The blade is stolen, and Ryu must recover it.

{{spoiler}}

The Dragon Lineage was an ancient race that fought and sealed the evil deities. Later known as the Hayabusa clan of ninjas, they were charged with protecting two legendary weapons: the Dragon sword, a sword that has been passed down from generation to generation in the Dragon Lineage and entrusted to young Ryu Hayabusa while his father trained in the wilderness, and the evil Dark Dragon Blade, a sword made from the bones of an evil black dragon & the dragon's evil power sealed within so none may use it.

The Dark Dragon Blade was guarded in the Hayabusa village. The village was abruptly attacked by forces of the [[Vigoor empire]], a force led by a Greater Fiend named Doku; Ryu was away visiting the master of the Shadow clan, the [[nunchuku]] master Murai who is also his uncle, in his fortress. Doku slaughters all who stand in his way, defeating Ryu as well, and departs with the Dark Dragon Blade. During Ryu's convalescence, Murai's espionage network learns that Doku is responsible for the theft, but he had stolen it at the behest of the Vigoor emperor; they aid Ryu in infiltrating the secretive Vigoor empire to retrieve the cursed blade.

The only available transportation is a [[zeppelin]]; it is swarming with Vigoor [[special forces]], who know of Ryu's presence. The ensuing battle destroys the zeppelin, and Ryu lands near the capital. Atop one of the city's nightclubs, he meets Rachel, a beautiful and scantily-clad Fiend Hunter. She warns Ryu about the dangers of fighting Doku. She then uses her hookshot to swing back into the city to fight Fiends. Ryu then encounters a mysterious man with round shades and a top hat, who introduces himself as Gamov. He appears to know a lot about Rachel. Before Ryu can say anything to him, he leans over the ledge of the building, and mysteriously disappears. Investigating with the help of Murai's spy, Ayane, Ryu learns that he can enter the palace through a underground path accessible via an old monastery. There Ryu meets the fiend hunter Rachel again.

After defeating a large tentacled fiend known as Hydracubus and saving Rachel's life, Ryu leaves Rachel with Ayane and enters the monastery. He makes his way down into an underground graveyard, and from there finds another path that could lead to the palace of Zarkhan. However, an unfortunate incident occurs and the underground area floods with water, forcing Ryu back to the monastery. There he meets Alma. Alma used to be Rachel's sister, but they carry a bloodcurse which renders them susceptible to twisting by evil fiends; this twisting is how a Greater Fiend is created (as opposed to Lesser Fiends which are brute unthinking monsters, Greater Fiends are considerably more powerful and retain their intelligence). Alma was captured by Doku and so twisted. The reason Rachel is a fiend hunter is to liberate her sister through death and to encompass revenge on Doku.

The aftermath of the explosive battle damages the monastery, which causes the Vigoor army to deploy forces in the capital. Ryu traverses the city filled with soldiers and army vehicles to the military supply base on the outskirts. Once there he destroys the [[radio]] communications tower, escaping on a stolen train found on a turntable, which Ryu crashes into another train to cover his tracks and mislead the army.

At the crash site Ryu finds a new way to get into Zarkhan; through the underground [[aquaduct]]. It leads him to the Moat of Zarkhan, but not before he slays the Fiend Paz Zuu. Swimming through the moat, he finds his way back into the Hidden Underground and subsequently the Monastery. There he takes a now-operational elevator to the Zarkhan Stadium, where he battles Doku once more and this time comes out victorious. The body of the fallen Lord of Greater Fiends disappears in a manner similar to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s death.

The other exit of the Zarkhan Stadium leads to the Palace of Zarkhan, but the doors are locked. Ryu heads into the Caverns, the only other unexplored area, and picks up the third of three fragments of a stone tablet that belong in a pedestal next to the Twin Serpents statue. Making his way through the Caverns, he slays the Fiend Yotunfrau and the Dragon Smaugan, finding the exit back in Dworku through the Aquaduct. On his way back to the Twin Serpents Plaza, he finds that the Dark Dragon's curse has transformed the Vigoor special forces patrolling the city into Fiends.

Inserting the stone tablet activates a series of teleporters strategically placed throughout Tairon and the one at the Twin Serpents Plaza brings him back to the Hayabusa Village, where he acts on a hint given by the blacksmith Muramasa and picks up Kureha's necklace. The gem is actually the Dragon's Eye, a jewel formed from the eye of a dragon that unlocks the true power of the Dragon Sword once the two are united.

With the True Dragon Sword in hand, Ryu takes the teleporters to an open field near a pyramid, where the spirit of Doku has tied Rachel up and prepares to sacrifice her to further empower Alma. To save her, Ryu must defeat Alma, who has transformed into a scorpion-like being more powerful than before. Ryu defeats Alma once more and races to save Rachel, but Alma gets there before him and, having an abrupt return to her senses, takes the fatal blow for her twin, turning back to her true human form.

Ryu journeys through the pyramid and into a labyrinth where he catches glimpses of Spirit Doku. At the exit of the labyrinth, he confronts Spirit Doku and permanently puts an end to him. However, the Lord of Greater Fiends curses Ryu with his dying breath, turning Ryu into a Fiend.

With the curse doing its work, Ryu fights his way through the core of the palace. He enters a strange realm lorded over by Marbus, last of the three Greater Fiends. He sends a variety of Fiends at Ryu and even resurrects two Ancient Greater Fiends (in Very Hard and Master Ninja of NGB; In any NG difficulty and Ninja Dog to Hard of NGB, he only revives Hydracubus and Yotunfrau), but they are all no match for Ryu. Marbus finally takes on Ryu personally, but loses nevertheless.

Ryu proceeds to ascend a long stairway that breaks, depositing him in a field of flowers with a gigantic statue in the distance. However, the field disappears to reveal a hellish wasteland, the statue showing itself to be a golem-creature which is the Vigoor Emperor as empowered by the Dark Dragon blade. Ryu uses his own ninpo magic to fight it from the air, slaying it. The Vigoor Emperor rises from the lava once more as a creature made of skulls, but Ryu kills it again and for good, finally freeing himself of the Fiend curse.

With the cavern collapsing, Ryu seizes the Dark Dragon Blade at last, and is rescued by Rachel. The two return to solid land, only to be confronted by Murai, who reveals that he is the shadowy agent who has been tracking Ryu throughout the game and was responsible for betraying his mission to the Vigoor empire as well as instigating Ryu's massacre so as to strengthen it. He steals the Dark Dragon Blade from the weakened Ryu and announces his intention to rule with its immense power. Nevertheless, Ryu manages to defeat Murai a second time, and reclaims the cursed blade while Murai plummets to his death in the cavern. Ryu wordlessly destroys the Dark Dragon Blade with the True Dragon Sword, leaves Rachel without further comment and returns the gem to his scorched village.

==Crossover==
While it has been stated that the Xbox ''Ninja Gaiden'' universe is not the same as the one in the original ''Ninja Gaiden''<ref name="plot">{{cite news
|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/interviews/august03/itagaki/
|publisher=GameSpy

, certain references make homage to the preceding games. However, the Xbox Ninja Gaiden takes place in the same continuity with another [[Team Ninja]] developed game series, ''Dead or Alive'', and there are several notes to back this up.

===Dead or Alive===
*[[Ayane (DOA)|Ayane]] from the ''[[Dead or Alive (video game series)|Dead or Alive]]'' series makes appearances in the game by helping Ryu. This further ties the two game series together as Ryu appears in ''Dead or Alive'', and knows Ayane's half brother [[EIN (DOA)|Hayate]].

*Some of Ryu's combat maneuveurs, such as the Izuna Drop, are derived from his Dead or Alive appearances. 

*The [[buddhism]] and [[ninjutsu]] related [[kuji-in]] practice ''Rin-Pyo-Toh-Sha-Kai-Jin-Retsu-Zai-Zen'' appears in both DoA and Ninja Gaiden; in DoA as a victory phrase spoken by Ryu and in Ninja Gaiden as characters that make up the life-upgrade bar.

*Ninja Gaiden takes place two years before the first Dead Or Alive tournament (due to the fact Ayane is 16 years old in the first DOA tournament and 14 in Ninja Gaiden).

===Original Ninja Gaiden===
*Ryu's father [[Ken Hayabusa|Joe Hayabusa]] is mentioned but not seen. He plays a larger role in the first of the NES-games.

*A number of Ryu's special abilities and Ninpo-magic seen in the Xbox Ninja Gaiden are also in use in the NES-series, mostly as power ups.

*Some of the Fiends and other minor foes appear to be recreations of those seen in the NES-series. The mysterious Gamov wears an attire similar to that of the equally shadowy CIA-agents in the first Ninja Gaiden.

*The Guilotine Throw-technique is reminiscent from the Ninja Gaiden arcade game, as is the manner of departure Ryu uses in the final cutscene, seen originally in use at the end of every stage in the arcade game.

==Criticism==
Many gamers criticize Ninja Gaiden for its poor camera placement. Many rooms feature cameras that are placed for cinematic effect, and though they provide an exciting portrait of the action, they are often very awkward to play the game with. During some fights, the main character, Ryu, can exist off-screen for several seconds at a time, often even requiring the player to adjust the camera manually mid-fight. ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' <!-- and the Hurricane pack too? --> granted users slightly increased control over the camera, but many rooms remain difficult to fight in, and in some rooms control of the camera is disabled entirely. Many players and game critics found the game to possess a high difficulty level and learning curve, which extended to much of the downloaded content and ''Ninja Gaiden Black''<ref>See ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'' for a concise summary of fan reaction: [http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/08 "A Brief Index of Difficulty"]; see also Tycho's newpost [http://www.penny-arcade.com/2004/03/08 comment]: "Shit ''damn'' Ninja Gaiden is hard, it's so hard that your ''friends'' will die. It's also completely great - once you've gone a few levels, just start a new game real quick and take a look at the guys you thought were bad-asses before. Those guys are ''feather pillows'' compared to the beasts and murderers you rub up against later." Tycho later [http://www.penny-arcade.com/2004/12/27 commented]: "When you first start playing Ninja Gaiden you might be overwhelmed with its difficulty - that was certainly true in my case. In fact, it was difficult to the degree that it was utterly demoralizing and it ended up on the shelf underneath something else so I wouldn't constantly be reminded of my deficiencies."</ref> There are however multiple difficulty settings and with the release of Ninja Gaiden Black two more were added - Ninja Dog being the easiest, and Master Ninja being the hardest.

==Weapons==
Several weapons can be obtained in ''Ninja Gaiden''. Some are received in key scenes, some are simply scattered along the way or bought from a shopkeeper, and a select few are found only after progress in a certain special task. Weapons come in three classes, melee, projectile and magic. Each has varying strengths and weaknesses. Melee and magic are usually used to attack, with projectile being used to stun and distract.

===Melee Weapons===
Melee weapons are the main weapon class in ''Ninja Gaiden''; most of them can be upgraded throughout the game. The melee weapons have their own subsections:

====Sword====
Balanced weapons of choice for Ryu.
* '''Dragon Sword''' - Ryu begins with this weapon. It is perhaps the most versatile of all his weapons. This sword represents the "good" as opposed to the Dark Dragon Blade's "evil".
** ''True Dragon Sword'' - After a certain point in the game, the Dragon Sword is upgraded to the True Dragon Sword.
* '''Plasma Saber''' - The [[lightsaber]] in ''Ninja Gaiden''. Identical in moves and power to the Dragon Sword; it is actually just a different 'look' for the Dragon Sword, obtained after completion of the game. At the point where the Dragon Sword gets upgraded into the True Dragon Sword, it becomes the ''Plasma Saber Mk. II''. The Plasma Saber Mk. II exists in ''Black'', but not the normal Plasma Saber.
* '''Kitetsu''' - A long sword with the ability to absorb its victims' health and transfer it to the user. Originally, Ryu too would gradually lose his health with the Kitetsu in hand, and would require the use of Armlet of Tranquility to counter this effect. In ''Ninja Gaiden Black'', The Kitetsu still drains health only when attacking, but upgrading it to the highest level removes this effect, as the Armlet of Tranquility was removed in the story mode of ''Ninja Gaiden Black''.

====Chain weapon====
Short range weapons which utilize speed to create combo attacks.
* '''[[Nunchaku]]''' - Simple wooden nunchaku. Acquired early in the game, but serve little to no purpose once the Vigoorian Flail is acquired.
* '''Vigoorian Flail''' - Bears a likeness to a [[kusarigama]], but replaces the traditional iron weight with a second sickle. Essentially, it works the same as the Nunchaku, but features several additional attacks and is more powerful due to its bladed tips.

====War Hammer====
Gigantic hammer, slow but does lots of damage.
* '''[[War Hammer]]''' - Rachel's weapon of choice.

====Greatsword====
Huge swords, slower but capable of attacking multiple enemies with lots of damage.
* '''Dabilahro''' - A greatsword. Resembles a [[Final Fantasy weapons #Swords|Buster sword]] initially, but becomes serrated when leveled up.
* '''Dark Dragon Blade''' - A powerful sword that contains an essence of pure evil. Carved from the bones of a black dragon. It is sealed and under guard by the Hayabusa clan and a key plot element. In ''Black'', the Dark Dragon Blade does the most damage per hit, second only to the Unlabored Flawlessness in its critical state.
* '''Wooden Sword''' - A [[Bokken|wooden training sword]]. Can only strike and cannot decapitate, also lacks several moves of the Dragon Sword's.
** ''Unlabored Flawlessness'' - When fully "powered up," the wooden sword's visual appearance changes to resemble an [[Eku]]. The Unlabored Flawlessness has a unique ability to it; when the player is at low health, the characters imprinted on the back of the weapon light up, signifying an increase in the weapon's power. At five percent health or less, the Unlabored Flawlessness does the most damage out of any weapon in the game.

====Staff====
* '''Lunar''' - A [[Bo (weapon)|Bo staff]]/[[spear]]. Capable of fast combo attacks to multiple enemies. (Ninja Gaiden Hurricane Packs/Ninja Gaiden Black Only)

====Special====
* '''Spear Gun''' - Underwater weapon. Blocking is not possible with this weapon.

===Projectile Weapons===
* '''[[Shuriken]]''' - The weakest of Ryu's projectiles, Ryu has an infinite supply.
* '''Incendiary Shuriken''' - Despite the label, these are [[Kunai]] with a small explosive on one end.
* '''Windmill Shuriken''' - A giant shuriken with four folding blades, it will return to its owner when thrown.
* '''[[Smoke bomb|Smoke Bomb]]''' - Temporarily blinds all enemies in the area. (Ninja Gaiden Hurricane Packs/Ninja Gaiden Black Only)
* '''[[Bow (weapon)|Bow]]''' - A typical bow, this has the advantage of not producing any sound when fired. The arrow shot travels in an arc and must be aimed accordingly.
* '''Strongbow''' - A composite bow made in Vigoor in medieval times. This bow fires arrows in straight lines.
** ''Explosive Arrows'' - Arrows with an explosive tip.
** ''APFSDS Cores'' - Tungsten-coated arrows that are armor-piercing.

==''Ninja Gaiden Black''==
A second edition of the game, titled '''''Ninja Gaiden Black''''', was released approximately eighteen months later, in [[September]] [[2005]]. It is essentially a [[Director's Cut]] or [[Special Edition]] of the original Xbox release of ''Ninja Gaiden''. It features two new difficulty settings (Master Ninja & Ninja Dog), much of the content from both "Hurricane Packs" with the exception of the Intercept "parry", tweaked enemy placement in the extra difficulties, four new costumes, the original arcade version of ''[[Ninja gaiden#Arcade game|Ninja Gaiden]]'', a new mission mode with 50 short missions (including 5 from the previous "Hurricane Packs") involving scenarios not found in the core game itself, one longer and more challenging mission called "Eternal Legend" (unlocked after beating 40 of the missions), and several new in-game cutscenes. Some of the additions to the game are not readily apparent. Many are only available after being unlocked by progressing through the game at various difficulty levels.

According to interviews with [[Tomonobu Itagaki]], the Ninja Dog difficulty was added only grudgingly. Itagaki felt that the standard difficulty implemented in the game was reasonable for any casual player if they persevered through the difficult parts. However, due to a strong outcry in disagreement to the difficulty level, he instituted the Ninja Dog mode as a double-edged compromise: the mode can only be accessed through dying three successive times within the first stage, at which point the player is asked, "Do you wish to abandon the way of the ninja?". If he or she selects yes, they are given accessories that enhance their abilities (but are rather demeaning to wear, such as pink armbands), more notes for the player's aid (which adopt an excessively hand-holding nature), surplus powerups, and lower prices on the more essential supplies throughout the game's merchant points. Statistic-enhancing ribbons in a variety of colours can be attached to Ryu's arm for the remainder of the game.

Ninja Gaiden Black is, however, more difficult than the original release on the higher difficulties. Several bosses including Phantom Doku and the Dark Disciple attack faster and more furiously, like their Hurricane Pack counterparts, plus a variety of dangerous new foes have been added to make life even harder. Furthermore, players who have previously played the normal edition of Ninja Gaiden will find that the Flying Swallow move, previously a powerful and useful technique, has been noticeably toned down and is a mere shadow of its old self, with some new enemies having moves specifically to punish usage of it against them.

==Ninja Gaiden Sigma==
{{main|Ninja Gaiden Sigma}}

In September 2006, the Japanese magazine [[Famitsu]] revealed ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' for the [[PlayStation 3]] to be an upgraded remake of the original Xbox game with a lot more features than ''Black'' had. It will also use fewer pre-rendered cutscenes. If Sigma sells well on PS3, Tecmo may consider releasing more Ninja Gaiden games on the PS3.
