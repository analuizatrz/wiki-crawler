'''''Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest''''', also known as '''''AoC''''', is the official expansion pack for the [[real-time strategy]] game ''[[Empire Earth (video game)|Empire Earth]]''. ''Art of Conquest'' was developed by [[Mad Doc Software]], and was released in [[September 17]],[[2002]] in the [[United States]].<ref name="Release">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/empireearththeartofc/similar.html?mode=versions |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest Release Dates |accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=GameSpot }}</ref> The Gold Edition of ''Empire Earth'', which features both the original and the expansion, was released on [[May 6]],[[2003]].

''Art of Conquest'' adds several new features to the original ''Empire Earth'', including new units, civilization powers, and new hero units. ''Art of Conquest'' features three new campaigns: one about [[Ancient Rome]], one about [[World War II]], and another about [[Mars]] in the twenty-fourth century. The game was given radical reviews, but ended up averaging 66% on [[Game Rankings]].<ref name="GameRankings"/>
 
==Gameplay==
:''For further information see [[Empire Earth#Gameplay|Empire Earth Gameplay]].''
The gameplay in ''Art of Conquest'' is the same as the original ''Empire Earth'', but with a few changes. Mad Doc added three new campaigns, and two new hero units for battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/g/pc_games/empire_earth_art_of_conquest/overview.php |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest |author= |accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes }}</ref> [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] were also added as new civilizations,<ref name="IGN"/> and each civilization received new powers. Difficulty was added to scenarios to those which did not receive it in an upgrade of the original Empire Earth. As with many expansion packs, new units and buildings were implemented.<ref name="Armchair"/> Another  important change was the addition of a multiplayer server, which meant that it was possible to play the game online with up to 7 other players in a lobby system or a Direct LAN connection.

The new Space Age (Epoch XV), allows the building of spaceports and [[spaceships]] on maps that allow it.<ref name="GameSpot"/> Citizens are replaced by [[robot]]s in the Nano Age and [[infantry]] are replaced by robots in the Space Age called watchmen. Farms are now run by robots in the Nano Age and in the Space Age farms no longer need citizens to manage them since they are now self-sufficient. The Japanese civilization can create Cyber Ninjas, a special cloaked unit which can temporarily disable buildings.  Walls change from polarized titanium to force fields, and towers become more sophisticated.

In ''The Art of Conquest'', each civilization has its own power, or "civ power". Often, these powers are only available during certain epochs. A civ power gives each nation a specialty. For example the English have the ability of an improved line-of-sight.<ref name="IGN"/>

''Empire Earth'' supports multiplayer games over LAN connections and online. Multiplayer games are identical in form to single player games. There are many [[Cheating in online games#Exploits|exploits]] which are readily available for players to use. Forums have since been started as a place to report them in an attempt to minimize the use of them.<ref> [http://forums.vugames.com/category.jspa?categoryID=30 Forum Used for catching Glitches] Retrieved February 21, 2007. </ref>

==Campaigns==
:''For further information see [[Empire Earth#Campaigns|Empire Earth Campaigns]].''
Three new campaigns were added in The ''Art of Conquest'': a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] campaign about [[Marius]] and [[Julius Caesar]], a Pacific one involving the warfare in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during [[World War II]], and a futuristic [[Asia]]n campaign involving the colonization of Mars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/empire-earth-the-art-of-conquest/ |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest (PC)| |accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=Gamespy }}</ref>

The Roman campaign revolves around the struggles of [[Marius]] as well as the conquests of [[Julius Caesar]]. The campaign begins with a war with the local tribes of Italy and barbarian invaders, in which the player can conscript citizens. The next scenario is Marius's war with [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], which the player must liberate [[Rome]] to win. The last four scenarios are about Julius Caesar's years as a general. The first scenario is about Caesar's war in the east against Sulla. The second scenario is very long and details the conquest of [[Gaul]] and the invasion of [[Iron Age Britain|Britain]]. The third scenario is Caesar's war with his former ally and friend [[Pompey]], which starts with the famous crossing the [[Rubicon]] and ends at the battle of [[Farsala]]. The final scenario is the conquest of [[Egypt]].

The Pacific campaign starts with the [[Battle of Midway]] and completes with the sinking of Japanese aircraft carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|''Sōryū'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|''Hiryū'']]. The next scenario is the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] in 1943. It is followed by scenarios detailing the island-hopping campaign derived by [[Douglas MacArthur]] which include killing Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], a special mission in [[Burma]] and the [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]], and the reconquest of [[Leyte]]. The campaign is concluded with [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], completed by sending five marines to the southern tip of the Island ([[Iwo Jima|Mount Suribachi]]). (''See [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]].'')

The Asian campaign consists of two parts. The story is told from the perspective of the Kwan Do family, who claim to be descendants of the [[Qin Dynasty]]. Part One details the colonization of [[Mars]]. As soon as it is discovered that it is possible to colonize Mars, the major superpowers of Earth scramble to develop the technologies and resources needed to establish settlements on Mars. One of these powers is the newly-formed United Federation of Asian Republics (UFAR), essentially founded and controlled by the Kwan Do family, the rich owner of Kwan Do Electronics and Commnications called Hu Kwan Do. The UFAR government struggles to repress local rebellions and terrorism by The Eye of God, an extremist [[Christianity|Christian]] organisation who claim that earth is the only home to mankind. Meanwhile, the UFAR also struggles to develop a colonial programme competing against rival superpowers. UFAR eventually establishes a colony on Mars, with help from Japan, along with settlements built by the US/[[Canada|Canadian]] Conglomerate, the [[European Union]] of Nations, [[Novaya Russia]], and the Republic of Japan, partitioning Mars into five regions. 
Part Two is set 250 years after the first part during the Space Epoch. The Kwan Do dynasty had been overthrown from power. Harsh conditions on Mars and an increasingly negative perception of the [[Earth]] governments have finally forced the Martian colonists into rebellion. During the revolutions, a descendant of the Kwan Do family, called Khan Sun Do, unites the five territories, and with the acquisition of [[Space Battleship Yamato]], the Martians fight Earth for their independence in an inter-planetary war. The campaign ends with the last battle for Martian independence and the installation of Khan Sun Do as the first leader of Mars.

==Development and release==
''Art of Conquest'' was announced in May of 2002 by Sierra as an expansion pack for ''Empire Earth''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/empireearththeartofconquest/preview.html |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest Preview|accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=Strategy Informer }}</ref> The development of the game was turned over to [[Mad Doc Software]] instead of [[Stainless Steel Studios]], since Stainless Steel had left to work on ''[[Empires: Dawn of the Modern World]]''.<ref name="dev">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/empireearththeartofc/news.html?sid=2865776 |title=First look: Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest |author=Sam Parker |accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=GameSpot }}</ref> According to Steve Beinner, the brand manager of the ''Empire Earth'' series, Empire Earth's expansion pack was planned even before the original ''Empire Earth'' was released.<ref name="develop"/> Community feedback was used to incorporate different features and when the expansion pack should be released.<ref name="develop"/> The results from the community feedback were that "People were asking for additional scenarios and extra units. That's based upon surveys we did and distributors on a worldwide basis."<ref name="develop">{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/359/359707p1.html |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest |author=Steve Butts |accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=IGN }}</ref>

Work on ''Art of Conquest'' began in early 2002, with a planned release date in the fall of that year (the actual release date ended up being September 24 in the United States). The developers decided "The game won't be present at E3, because of the tight development schedule and the fact that Sierra didn't want the developers to be distracted by creating an E3 demo."<ref name="dev"/> Beta testing for ''Art of Conquest'' was released on August 5, 2002. [[GameSpot]] said, "The public beta consists of one multiplayer map that can be played through all 15 of the expansion pack's ages, so players will be able to try out all the new units, buildings, and special abilities."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/empireearththeartofc/news.html?sid=2876571&mode=recent |title=Art of Conquest beta now available |author=Sam Parker |accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=Gamespot}}</ref>

AoC was included in the release of the Empire Earth Gold Edition, which was a re-release of both ''Empire Earth'', ''Art of Conquest'', and instruction booklets.<ref name="GameSpotGold">{{cite web |url=http://gamespot.com/pc/strategy/empireearthgoldedition/news.html?sid=6091979|title=Empire Earth: Gold Edition Company Line |accessdate=2007-03-17|publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref>

===Critical Reception===
The overall reception of ''Art of Conquest'' was mediocre. [[Game Rankings]] averaged it at about 66%,<ref name="GameRankings">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/561395.asp?q=Empire%20Earth |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest - PC|accessdate=2007-03-01|publisher=GameRankings }}</ref> and [[Metacritic]] averaged it slightly lower, at 63 out of 100.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/empireearthart?q=Empire%20Earth |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest Expansion |accessdate=2007-03-01|publisher=MetaCritic }}</ref> IGN, who gave it a 7.8 out of 10, stated "While it's a solid game, there's just not enough here to compel me to reawaken the substantial addiction the first game generated. Whether or not it's worth it for you to pick this one up depends almost entirely on how much you enjoyed the original game. With so few significant changes it plays almost exactly the same. For those who couldn't get enough of Empire Earth, the expansion should be a perfect fit. Just don't expect the breadth and scope of the first game."<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/372/372262p2.html |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest |author=Steve Butts |accessdate=2007-03-01|publisher=IGN }}</ref> Armchair Empire gave the game a 6.8 out of 10, and commented "AoC doesn’t exactly bring any shame or disgrace to Empire Earth (EE), but it doesn’t do anything to make itself a must have for EE fans. That being said, most EE fans will like what AoC has to offer."<ref name="Armchair">{{cite web |url=http://www.armchairempire.com/Reviews/PC%20Games/empire-earth-art-conquest.htm |title=Empire Earth: Art of Conquest |author=Omni |accessdate=2007-03-01|publisher=Armchair Empire}}</ref> Finally, GameSpot gave it a 5.2 out of 10, and said "Ultimately, The Art of Conquest doesn't add enough to make much of a difference."<ref name="GameSpot">.{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/empireearththeartofc/review.html?sid=2881249 |title=Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest |author=Tom Chick|accessdate=2007-03-01|publisher=GameSpot }}</ref>

GameSpot also said space was considered to be poorly implemented, as spaceships were only available on certain maps and it used the same sort of gameplay as water (i.e. a dock-type building is built and spaceships travel much like naval ships).<ref name="GameSpot"/> The graphics were not considerably improved in this expansion pack, which some reviewers considered a detriment.<ref name="GameSpot"/>

One of the game's great disadvantages of the expansion pack was its cost of 30 USD. IGN said "I like Art of Conquest enough but it just falls short of being worth the $30 price tag."<ref name="IGN"/> Other critics quoted "This disappointing addition to Stainless Steel Studios' everything-and-the-kitchen-sink real-time strategy game doesn't do much to justify its steep $30 price tag."<ref name="GameSpot"/> and "It plays and handles just like Empire Earth and there’s a host of new additions, but with a game as big as EE, why even expand?"<ref name="Armchair"/>

===Audio===
No soundtrack CD was ever made with the music of ''Art of Conquest'', but the music in the game was given a 7 out of 10 by GameSpot.<ref name="GameSpot"/>. [[IGN]] also gave the sound a 7 out of 10, and described the sound by saying "The sound is convincing enough with realistic battle noises throughout the game's various ages. Each type of attack makes a particular sound and, after a while, you can develop a good sense of the scope of a given battle just by listening to it. It's sort of like knowing when to shift gears without needing to check the tachometer."<ref name="IGN"/> However, IGN was disappointed in unit acknowledgements, commenting "The unit acknowledgements, while quite personable, can get out of hand as large groups of units result in echoing or delayed acknowledgements. When the centurion is selected for instance, he says "vini, vidi, vici." ([''sic''], should be [[Veni, vidi, vici]].) But if you select a group of them, they all say this with a weird delay that sounds a bit like "vidividividividividi vici" and reminds me of nothing so much as that gay robot from Buck Rogers." and finished with "A few glitches detract from an otherwise sufficient soundtrack. Voices are decent and the music is good."<ref name="IGN"/>
