'''''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance''''' is an [[action role-playing game]], previously referred to as '''Marvel Legends''', the game is set within the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and features appearances from many of the superheroes, [[supervillain]]s and supporting [[character]]s that feature within the [[comic book]]s published by Marvel, with 140 character appearances in total. 

==Story==
The game starts with [[Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]] having recently formed a new [[Masters of Evil]]. The new evil alliance launches an attack on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]] U.N.N. Alpha and [[Nick Fury]] sends out a distress call to all available metahumans, or super heroes. [[Captain America]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] are seen responding to the call. After saving the helicarrier, Nick Fury is given permission to start a task force to fight this new threat and [[Iron Man]] gives them permission to use Stark Tower as their headquarters since the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier U.N.N. Alpha was badly damaged by the Masters of Evil.

The initial missions revolve around responding to attacks on strategic locations by the Masters of Evil: S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Omega Base and Atlantis.  Both locations have items stolen from them: the super soldier serum (The serum that gave Captain America his powers), the Mutant Amplifier (A device capable of amplfying a mutant's powers at the cost of burning out their DNA) and the Tome of Asarius (A book telling of various alternate dimensions).  The team tracks the latter theft to [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]'s palace, but find out he has long since left the evil group and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] has instead joined, using his shape-shifting abilities to pose as the Mandarin.  In the wake of this, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Jean Grey]] are kidnapped and the heroes mobilise to rescue them. Nightcrawler, however, has been forced to teleport to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s Realm and, after defeating [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]] (The heroes having been diverted there by an intercepted teleportation spell), Jean Grey also travels there to aid the heroes, but both X-Men are subsequently captured by [[Blackheart]], and one of them (depending on the choice of the player) must die.  The teams defeat Mephisto and Blackheart, but in the meantime the Masters of Evil attack Asgard.

After Asgard falls the heroes attempt to liberate it, rescuing the imprisoned gods and opening the bridge to Earth, but using the Twilight Sword traded from Mephisto, Doom and Loki manage to defeat [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] and abandon their other minions as Doom proceeds to steal Odin's power and Loki lays claim to the throne of Asgard.  Loki is defeated, but Doom easily bests the heroes. Only the intervention of Uatu the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] saves them; he transports them to the base of the [[Inhumans]] on the Moon and tells them how to defeat Doom: through use of two artifacts, the [[M'Kraan Crystal]] of the [[Shi'ar Empire]] and the Muonic Inducer, a device belonging to [[Galactus]]. After many trials by fire, both items are obtained, in spite of a rebellion amongst the Shi'ar and the antagonistic force of Galactus and the [[Skrull]], whose new homeworld Galactus is attempting to consume.

While the heroes are away, Dr. Doom conquers Earth and corrupts many heroes after defeating them as well as using Odin's powers to create evil clones of the playable heroes. With their new devices in tow, the heroes travel to Castle Doom, where they fight through corrupted heroes and rescue Odin. Upon confronting Doom himself, they use the artifacts to defeat him by stealing his power, at which point Odin appears and captures him. In the final cutscene, the group of heroes disbands with the knowledge that the danger is passed since Loki and Doom are both in Odin's captivity. Meanwhile, Galactus vows revenge on the heroes who stole from him and plans to destroy Earth.

===Subplot===
During the game a subplot takes place where [[Weasel (comics)|Weasel]] attempts to find proof that the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] is a double agent, and the player needs to obtain various pieces of information to aid his efforts. Ultimately the players call Nick Fury with information of Black Widow's apparent betrayal, it is revealed that Black Widow is innocent and her suspicious activities were part of an operation to try and retrieve plans that Dr. Doom had stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. However, a phone call made during the credits reveal that the Black Widow had been using Weasel to steal information from S.H.I.E.L.D. then setting up Weasel for the fall.

==Features==
Players can select teams of four from a range of more than twenty playable characters, allowing them to create their own superhero teams or recreate famous teams from within the comics, as well as have online and co-operative play, for up to 4 players. Players are able to fight in mid air, underwater and on the ground, with destructible and interactive environments. It spans several places on Earth, different dimensions, and the depths of space. The game has alternative endings, affected by the decisions the player(s) make throughout the game. These endings are based on whether or not the player chooses to complete optional missions.

In arcade mode, players will have to fight for the most kills in order to get the experience points at the end of the level. Characters may have up to four costumes, which can alter the stats of the character. The game also features trivia games, artwork and many more references to the Marvel Universe.

Throughout the game, the team of heroes will have the opportunity to locate "Simulator Discs". These discs are playable from any S.H.I.E.L.D. training simulator. These are special comic book missions, where you play as one of the heroes and revisit a moment in their past where they faced a classic arch rival. You can only use a certain pre-determined hero for each disc. The missions on the discs are different, but all have the same general guidelines. You must defeat a certain boss and complete the Simulator within 20 minutes. In some character's discs, you must also defend a certain character or object. Once you complete the mission and defeat the boss, you are scored based on how many enemies you killed and on how quickly you completed it. There are also what are called "Vs" discs, in which you may play as your whole team against a famous villain.

Xbox Live now offers downloadable extra content called "Hero pack" and "Villain pack". In the "Hero pack" you are able to play as Hawkeye, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and the Hulk. In the "Villain" pack, you can play as Venom, Dr. Doom, Sabretooth, and Magneto.

==Versions==
[[Image:Ultimate alliance gold.jpg|thumb|125px|right|The Gold Edition Cover.]]

The game is available through several gaming systems, with a graphical engine that looks different on its various platforms.

===Game Boy Advance===
"Marvel: Ultimate Alliance" has been altered for the Game Boy Advance port and has become a side-scrolling fighting game with minor RPG elements, such as the ability to alter your characters stats. The graphics are simplified for this system and the selection of characters has also been reduced. Some additional gameplay modes were added into this version of the game including a S.H.I.E.L.D. Simulator, Time Challenges, Scavenger Hunts, and a Survival mode. Teams for this port consist of three characters and a striker, a non-playable fourth character who can be summoned to perform a powerful attack directed toward on-screen enemies. 

Playable characters include [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], [[Captain America]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Ms. Marvel]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]], and [[Ghost Rider]]. The Special Strikers included in the game are [[Dr. Strange]], Ghost Rider, [[Iron Man]], [[Dark Phoenix]], [[Namor (comics)|Namor the Submariner]], and [[Vision (comics)|Vision]]. Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Iceman are the game's starter team but as the game progresses, characters become unlocked as more missions are completed.

===PC===
The PC version, like most PC games, is customizable, and many characters and their skins can be obtained from modding sites for play within the game. Also, the PC version's graphics vary depending on the customization of a user's settings, at maximum settings and shaders with premium hardware, the PC graphics will be similar to or better than the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|7th generation]] console versions. The PC version also features "intuitive mouse controls" <ref>[http://www.marvelultimatealliance.com/game_info.php Marvel: Ultimate Alliance official site]</ref> and works with a gamepad.

===Playstation Portable===
The [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version features simplified graphics, different characters, and extra features including the four exclusive playable Marvel characters [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]  and [[Ronin (comics)|Ronin]]. Other things unique to this version are 6 exclusive comic book missions including one which contained [[Andreas Strucker|Swordsman]], an exclusive prequel mission, and three exclusive single-player gameplay modes. For the PSP's online play, microphone support ''(voice chat)'' is available as well as online-recordable player statistics.

===Wii===
[[Image:Marvel 7th.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] attacking an enemy.]]
The [[Wii]] version has a few features unique to its version including specific motion-sensitive controls for normal moves, Motion-sensitive controlled Special attacks, unique for each character, and access to any special move at any time. For this version there is no online play, but there is a normal multiplayer mode in which up to four players may play at once. It also contains [[Moon Knight]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], which were included in all the Next Generation versions.

===Xbox 360 and PS3===
The Xbox 360 version and the Playstation 3 version look and run virtually identical, with no major differences from one another, notably: both versions have the inclusion of [[Moon Knight]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], who were not featured as playable characters on the other versions except the Nintendo Wii version.

Activision released 8 additional downloadable characters on the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace on April 26, 2007 in a set of packs: a hero and villain pack, both costing 500 [[Microsoft points]] a piece. However, if desired, the user may download both in a bundle pack, slightly reducing the overall cost of both separate for 800 Microsoft points. Within the hero pack, the four heroes represented are [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. The four included in the villain pack are [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], and [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Activision to Release New Marvel: Ultimate Alliance Heroes and Villains on Xbox Live Marketplace|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/marvelultimatealliance/news.html?sid=6167963&om_act=convert&om_clk=gsupdates&tag=updates;title;1|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance: Gold Edition'' was released for the Xbox 360 on May 22, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/objects/908/908243.html |title=Marvel: Ultimate Alliance Gold Edition |accessdate=2007-07-26 |format= |work=IGN }}</ref>. It has all eight downloadable heroes and villains that were originally available only on the Xbox 360 through download on Xbox Live.

''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance: Enhanced (Platinum Hits)'' is set for release for the Xbox 360 on September 25, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/data/932586.html |title=Marvel: Ultimate Alliance |accessdate=2007-09-16 |format= |work=GameFaqs }}</ref>. Current Feature set unknown.

===PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits===
On [[August 19]], [[2007]], a Special Edition Greatest Hits version was released for the [[PlayStation 2]], but all it had was the game  in it's original form and a "bonus" DVD containing a making-of featurette.

==Characters==
While ''Ultimate Alliance'' follows in the footsteps of Raven Software's ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' games, it has a broader scope of inclusion, adding playable heroes from [[Marvel Comics]]' other popular comics, including [[Spider-Man]], many different members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the entire [[Fantastic Four]]. In addition, each character has four different costumes, except for Moon Knight, who has three. Most of these extra costumes are different costumes characters have had in their comics appearances; for example, Spider-Man has his black symbiote costume and his red and gold [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Stark Armor (Iron Spider)|"Iron Spider"]] costume, as well as his classic red and blue costume. Some of the costumes are alternate versions of the same character or even entirely separate characters with similar powers or appearance: for example, many characters appear in their [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] versions, and both versions of the character [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] as well as the [[MC2]] character [[Spider-Girl]] are available via the costume change feature.  Some costume changes are also renditions of the character in other media.  For example, [[Blade (comics)|Blade's]] "Daywalker" costume is the take on the Blade character during his [[Blade: The Series|short lived live action series]].

Putting together teams of characters who have a shared history together, for example, may give team bonuses (ex. using [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Ms. Marvel]] on the same team would yield you the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], giving the player a boost in attack damage for all team members). Most teams are not taken from the comics but involve choosing characters with something in common. For instance, Thor, Storm, Human Torch and Iceman form Natural Forces, and any all-female team creates Femme Fatale. Using particular characters to interact with other NPCs can also yield additional dialogue, and villains will also react accordingly when met with their nemeses (for example, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] will talk directly to [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] or [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] upon seeing those characters in the first chapter). 

While many characters in the game by default are rendered with the appearance they have in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of comics, the world of the game is predominantly based upon that of the [[Earth 616|original Marvel Universe]], with many villains, character designs and references to events that exist only in that continuity (for example, [[Galactus]] is the original Marvel Universe's version, not Ultimate Marvel's hive-minded robotic version), and both designs of Shocker and Nick Fury are of their classic ones, rather than their Ultimate ones.

One major fact to note is that the version of Nick Fury used for Alliance is not the same as previously appeared in the X-Men Legends game, instead being the classic original Nick Fury. However, the [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]] model that was previously used is still available as an alternate costume for Fury, with both Nick Fury versions having two costumes each.

The [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] was going to be the final playable character, but as the rights to use the character are held by [[Sierra Entertainment]], this was not possible. However, the player meets Bruce Banner in the Omega Base & sees a defeated Hulk in a cinematic prior to the final mission.

[[Image:MarvelUltimateAllianceScreen.jpg|thumb|225px|right|[[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain America]].]]

Characters that appear as alternate costumes are listed under the original character.<br>
:''All playable characters have four different costumes, except [[Moon Knight]], who has three.''.<br>
:''In the case of [[Nick Fury]], Two of his four represent [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Ultimate Nick Fury]]''.
:''In the case of [[Silver Surfer]], all of his alternate costumes look the same.''
All characters in italics are costume changes for other characters that are of different personas altogether. Daredevil, Black Panther, Nick Fury, Silver Surfer, Dr Strange, Ghost Rider and Blade are not available at the beginning of the game; some of them have to be unlocked by completing/collecting specific items whereas the rest are unlocked as you meet the characters in the game.
