'''Straffan''' is a small village in [[County Kildare]], [[Republic of Ireland]], on the banks of the [[River Liffey]]. 

==Irish name==
Causing some confusion and a small element of controversy is the Irish language name of Straffan. Officially the Irish name of Straffan is ''Teach Srafáin'', which translates as the church of St. Srafan, a medieval saint. Traditionally the Irish name was ''An Srutháin''. In common usage until recently was ''Cluainíní'', meaning Little Meadows or Fields. Cluainíní is now regarded as the Irish name of Clownings, a townland with a Straffan address about 2 miles from the village. Cluainíní came into use as the Irish name for Straffan as the train station, Straffan Station, and post office were located at Clownings.

Adding to the confusion was the anomaly, which was corrected in the last five years, of the road signs on the three major roads leading into the village showing the three different names.

==Notable sites and buildings==
Today Straffan contains [[Catholic]] and [[Church of Ireland]] churches, a [[newsagent]], a [[butchers]]', two [[pub]]s, the Straffan Inn and Friel's, a [[gaelic football]] club, a [[soccer club]] and a primary school, Scoil Bhríde (present building constructed in [[1963]]). But foremost among the buildings of Straffan is [[The Kildare Hotel and Golf Club]] (K Club), a 5-star hotel with two championship golf courses, the Palmer Course, completed in 1990, and the Smurfit Course, completed 2003. It has held the [[Smurfit European Open]] every year since 1995 and held the [[Ryder Cup]] in 2006. Straffan is also the traditional starting point of the [[Liffey Descent]] [[canoe|kayak]] race, Ireland's largest canoeing event.

Among the sites of historical interest in Straffan are the old [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] barracks; Straffan House (now the [[The Kildare Hotel and Golf Club]]); [[Barberstown Castle]]; the old tower in the graveyard; and the Protestant church which is hundreds of years old.

==Straffan GFC==
[[Straffan GAA|Straffan]] GFC, one of the eight oldest [[gaelic football]] clubs in Ireland, was formed in 1885, and is the focal point of the community. Currently Straffan has two teams competing in the [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] Senior and Junior Football Leagues.
