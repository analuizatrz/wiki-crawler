'''Pasta''' is a type of [[food]] made from the [[flour]] of certain [[cereal|grains]] mixed with [[water]] and/or [[Egg (food)|eggs]], which is then kneaded and formed into various shapes, and boiled prior to consumption. Pasta can be found in numerous different forms; both fresh and dried and in many different shapes and varieties, probably the most famous of which is [[spaghetti]]. [[Macaroni]] is a term encompassing various pasta shapes, but is most commonly used to refer to small thin pasta tubes. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

[[Image:Moser Spaghetti essender Junge.jpg||thumb|left|200px|''Boy with [[Spaghetti]]'' by Julius Moser, c.1808]] Pasta can also denote dishes in which pasta products are the primary ingredient, served with sauce or seasonings. The word comes from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''pasta'' which shares its origins with "paste", meaning "dough", "pasta", or "pastry" as in "small cake". As recently as [[1918]] the English word "paste" was used instead of or alongside the Italian ''pasta''.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/87/0006.html The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book. Chapter VI. CEREALS. Fannie Farmer]. Original text from of the 1918 edition of [[Fannie Merritt Farmer]]'s [[Boston Cooking-School Cook Book]].</ref>

Dried Italian-style pasta is made from [[durum]] wheat [[semolina]], which gives it a light yellow colour and a slightly chewy texture when properly prepared. It is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: "with [a slight] bite"). Italian dried pastas are also rolled between copper rollers. 

Certain [[United States|American]] pastas are produced from a mixture of [[farina]] and semolina. Such pastas often have a different texture and flavor and are typically used in casseroles or other dishes.  Some pasta varieties, such as [[Pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. [[Gnocchi]] are often listed among pasta dishes, although they are quite different in ingredients (mainly milled [[potato]]es) and mode of preparation.

Pasta is made either by [[extrusion]], where the ingredients are forced through holes in a plate known as a [[die]], or by lamination, in which dough is kneaded, folded, rolled to thickness, then cut by slitters. Fresh pasta cooks quickly, but spoils relatively quickly due to its high water content. Dry pasta generally contains about 12.5% moisture, which makes it [[shelf stable]] for about three years.  

Packed refrigerated or frozen pasta can be found with relative ease in most pasta counsuming countries. More varieties tend to be available where [[expatriate]] Italian communities have taken root. Italian companies such as Arienti & Cattaneo [[Ima]], [[Ostoni]], and [[Zamboni]] manufacture machines for producing "fresh" packed pasta, which has a [[shelf life]] of around 7 weeks.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that consuming five servings of fortified grain foods &mdash;  a serving might be ½ cup of cooked pasta or a slice of bread, for example &mdash; could add another 220 micrograms or more of [[folate]] per day, to help people meet their recommended folate levels.

Some have attributed the innovation of dried pasta, in the form of long thin noodles we use today (spaghetti) to the Arabs who populated Southern Italy (i.e. Sicily) around the 12th Century. Prior to this, Italians are said to have eaten their pasta freshly made (''pasta fresca'') in a gnocchi like form.

Common pasta sauces in [[Northern Italy]] include [[pesto]] and [[ragù alla bolognese]]; in [[Central Italy]], simple [[tomato sauce]] and [[amatriciana]] and [[carbonara]], and in [[Southern Italy]], spicy tomato, garlic, and olive oil based sauces, often paired with fresh vegetables or seafood. Varieties include [[puttanesca]], ''spaghetti alla norma'' (tomatoes and eggplant), ''pasta con le sarde'' (fresh sardines, pine nuts, fennel and olive oil). 

[[Fettuccine Alfredo]], with cheese and butter, and spaghetti with tomato sauce with or without ground meat or meatballs are popular Italian-style dishes in the [[United States]].

== Pasta varieties ==
[[Image:Pasta_2006_3.jpg|thumb|left|Varieties of pasta]]

Pasta comes in many different shapes and sizes. There are simple string-shaped pasta like [[spaghetti]] and [[vermicelli]], ribbon-shaped ones like [[fettuccine]] and [[linguine]], short tubes like [[elbow macaroni]] and [[penne]], decorative fancy shapes like [[farfalle]] and [[rotelle]], large sheets like [[lasagna]], and hollow pasta stuffed with filling, like [[ravioli]], [[manicotti]], and [[tortellini]]. ''See [[List of pasta]] for more detailed descriptions of varieties of pasta.''

The basic ingredients are usually the same; the shape and characteristics of each variety's surface makes it better suited for certain kinds of sauce.
