Sir '''Leslie James Herron [[Order of the British Empire|K.B.E]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|C.M.G.]]''' ([[May 22]] [[1902]] - [[May 3]] [[1973]]) was a prominent [[Australia]]n barrister, judge, chief justice and lieutenant governor of [[New South Wales]].  Biographer Martha Rutledge describes him as being “interested, interesting and with a lively sense of humour”, but that he “conducted his court with consideration, dignity and mercy”.<ref>ADB</ref>

==Early years==
Herron was born on [[22 May]] [[1902]] in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], to Henry Herron and Emily Ethel (nee Downie).  Leslie was the second of six siblings.  He was educated at the [[Church of England]] Preparatory School, Mosman, at the [[Sydney Grammar School]] and at the [[University of Sydney]].  He obtained an LL.B in 1924 with second class honours.  Herron played first-grade [[rugby union]] in the position of “breakaway” for the Sydney club Western Suburbs Football Club between 1922 to 1925.

Herron was admitted to the New South Wales bar on [[28 August]] [[1925]] and practiced in common law on the “Northern Circuit” of New South Wales.  He married Andree Lorna on [[6 January]] [[1930]] at St James Anglican Church in the centre of Sydney on [[6 January]] [[1930]]. He took silk as a Kings Counsel (KC) in [[20 December]] [[1939]].

==Judicial career==

Herron was appointed as an acting judge of the [[District Court of New South Wales]] in February 1939.  The District Court is a middle ranking court in New South Wales and at the time was a civil court.  On [[10 February]] [[1941]], Herron was appointed as a judge of the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]], the state’s highest ranking court.

Herron served as a royal commissioner in the 1958 [[Royal Commission]] of Inquiry into statements made by the Auditor-General in his annual report for the year 30 June 1958 concerning the Minister for Housing, the Honourable Abram Landa.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-05-21 |url=http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/cguide/c2/com&inq7.htm#E10E82

From March 1962, Herron served as acting chief justice of the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] due to the illness of the then chief justice [[Doc Evatt]].  On Evatt’s resignation, Herron was permanently appointed as chief justice on [[25 October]] [[1962]].<ref>ADB</ref>   Herron was to serve as chief justice during a time of structural change in the Supreme Court.  In 1965, the New South Wales Government established the [[Court of Appeal of New South Wales|Court of Appeal]] to replace the Full Court of the Supreme Court. This new court was to be the first court of its kind in Australia.  The government however appointed a junior judge of the court, Justice Wallace, to be the first president of the new Court of Appeal.  This made Wallace the second most senior judge of the Supreme Court.  This appointment was resented by some of the other judges of the court and led to a schism in the bench, which was not fixed until Justice Sugerman replaced Wallace upon his retirement. It led to certain judges refusing to sit with other judges which created its own tensions.<ref>Slattery, paragraph 58</ref>

==Notable cases==

One of the legally significant cases Herron was involved with was R v Cuthbert.<ref>(1967) 86 WN (Pt. 1) (NSW) 272 </ref>  This case laid out the rationale upon which a society inflicts punishment upon offenders when they contravene the law and commit a criminal offence.  Herron said at 274:
'The function of the criminal law and the purposes of punishment cannot be found in any single explanation, for it depends both upon the nature and type of offence and the offender. But all purposes may be reduced under the single heading of the protection of society, the protection of the community from crime. The sentence should be such as, having regard to all proved circumstances, seems at the same time to accord with the general moral sense of the community and to be likely to be a sufficient deterrent both to the prisoner and others: per Jordan CJ, R. v. Geddes. <ref>(1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554</ref> Courts have not infrequently attempted further analysis of the several aspects of punishment (Reg v. Goodrich),<ref>(1952) 70 WN (NSW) 42</ref> where retribution, deterrence and reformation are said to be its threefold purposes. In reality they are but the means employed by the Court for the attainment of the single purpose of the protection of society'.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-05-21
