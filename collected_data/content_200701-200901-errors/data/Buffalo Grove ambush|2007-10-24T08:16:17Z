The '''Buffalo Grove ambush''' was an [[ambush]] that occurred on [[May 19]] [[1832]] as part of the [[Black Hawk War]]. A six-man detail carrying dispatches from United States Colonel James M. Strode at [[Galena, Illinois]] to General [[Henry Atkinson]] at [[Dixon's Ferry]] was ambushed by Native Americans during the attack. William Durley was killed and buried near the site of the ambush. Durley's remains were initially interred by the party that would become victims of the [[St. Vrain massacre]]. Two other men had bullet holes in their clothing, but were uninjured. In 1910 the Polo Historical Society moved Durley's remains to a plot beneath a memorial they erected west of [[Polo, Illinois]].

==Background==
As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the [[Governor]] of [[Indiana Territory]] and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement, the Sauk and Fox tribes vacated their lands in [[Illinois]] and moved west of the [[Mississippi]] in 1828. However, Sauk Chief [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]] and others disputed the treaty, claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted, nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands.<ref name=lewis/> Angered by the loss of his birthplace, between 1830&ndash;31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the [[Mississippi River]], but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the [[United Kingdom|British]], he again moved his so-called "British Band" of around 1000 warriors and non-combatants into Illinois.<ref name=lewis>Lewis, James.

The conflict became known as the [[Black Hawk War]].

==Prelude== 
When the [[Black Hawk War]] began in the spring of 1832, the settlers at Buffalo Grove were notified of [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]]'s victory at [[Battle of Stillman's Run|Stillman's Run]] and ordered to leave the grove.<ref name=leeogle>"[http://www.leeogle.org/pchs/Historical/BuffGrov.htm Buffalo Grove]," Polo Community High School, ''Lee/Ogle Regional Office of Education #47.

==Ambush==

The Buffalo Grove ambush occurred near [[Buffalo Grove, Ogle County, Illinois|Buffalo Grove]], [[Illinois]], a small, unincorporated settlement in present-day [[Ogle County, Illinois|Ogle County]].<ref name=footnote>Buffalo Grove is also the name of the geographic area surrounding the old town. See "Buffalo Grove," ''Lee/Ogle Regional Office of Education #47''.</ref> As the group neared the edge of the grove one of the party noted the increased chances for [[ambush]] and suggested that the party avoid the usual route by taking a more roundabout route. The suggestion was opposed and Durley reared his horse and entered the wooded area within the grove. He had traveled only a few "bounds" when he was cut down by gunfire from the previously suggested ambush.<ref name=hoffman>Hoffman, Charles Fenno.

==Aftermath==
The events of the Buffalo Grove ambush are closely interrelated with those of the [[St. Vrain massacre]]. A group of four men, including Aaron Hawley and John Fowler, both casualties of the St. Vrain massacre, was en route to Galena when they stumbled upon the body of Durley at Buffalo Grove. The group returned to Dixon's Ferry, reported their find and stayed there overnight.<ref name=stevens>Stevens, Frank E.

When Atkinson returned to Dixon on [[May 23]] it was with dispatches destined for [[Fort Armstrong]]. He ordered [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Agent]] [[Felix St. Vrain]] to join the group that had discovered Durley's body and travel with them to Galena.<ref name=stevens/> The group left Dixon and traveled north where they found, and interred the remains of Durley at Buffalo Grove.<ref name=stevens/><ref name=wisc>"[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/diary/002832.asp The Killing of Felix St. Vrain]," Historic Diaries: Black Hawk War, ''Wisconsin Historical Society''.
