==Career==
===Early career===
Punk's first venture into wrestling was a stint in a [[backyard wrestling]] federation called the "Lunatic Wrestling Federation" with his friends in the mid-late 1990s where he first started using the name CM Punk as part of the [[tag team]] the '''Chick Magnets''' along with CM Venom,<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="chickmagnets">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040222144349/http://www.chicagowrestling.com/AL/al-cmvenom-12-17-01.htm|title=CM Venom Interview|accessmonthday=26 September|accessyear=2006|author=Lagattolla, Al|date=2001-12-17|publisher=Chicago Wrestling}}</ref> when another performer skipped out on the card.<ref name="jon">{{cite web|url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/748/748635p1.html|title=CM Punk Interview|accessmonthday=19 March|accessyear=2007|author=Robinson, Jon|date=2006-12-01|publisher=IGN}}</ref> He would later change that CM stood for Chick Magnet and instead portrayed the initials as having no meaning by giving different answers when asked, including "[[Cookie Monster]]", "Crooked Moonsault", "[[C.

Punk's home promotion for his early career is usually considered to be [[Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South|Independent Wrestling Association: Mid-South]] (IWA:Mid-South). During Punk's time in IWA:Mid-South he had high profile feuds with his friend Colt Cabana and [[Chris Hero]] and rose to the top of the roster winning the IWA Mid-South Light-Heavyweight Championship twice and the [[IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship]] on five separate occasions. Notably his feud with Hero included a 56-minute [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|TLC match]],<ref name="punkshoot" /> a 93-minute [[two out of three falls match]]<ref name="wojick" /> and several 60-minute draws.<ref name="joepunk" /> Punk's matches with Cabana led him to getting a job in [[Ring of Honor]].<ref name="wojick" /> During his time in IWA:Mid-South he would also meet, wrestle against and become a friend of [[Eddie Guerrero]].<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="wojick" /> From February 2003 until May 2004 Punk refused to wrestle for IWA:Mid-South, which Punk claims was in protest to [[Ian Rotten]]'s treatment of Chris Hero<ref name="punkshoot" />; however, Hero has stated he believes there were other reasons and Rotten's treatment of him was just an excuse by Punk to stop working for the company,<ref name="heroshoot">{{cite video|people=[[Chris Hero]]|url=http://www.rfvideo.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=2708|title=Shoot with Chris Hero|medium=DVD|publisher=RF Video|year =2005|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> but eventually he returned and continued to wrestle as well as be a commentator for IWA:Mid-South until 2005 when he was signed to [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]. His last appearance in IWA:Mid-South was on [[July 2]], [[2005]] in which he went to a thirty minute time limit draw against [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]] which went into overtime resulting in Delirious pinning Punk with a [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)#Sunset flip|sunset flip]], during which his trunks were pulled down revealing his [[buttocks]] in a homage to [[Chris Candido]]. After the match was over he proceeded to give a farewell speech to the crowd.

===Ring of Honor and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===
[[Image:Punkcabana.jpg|thumb|171px|CM Punk with [[Scott Colton|Colt Cabana]] as the [[ROH World Tag Team Championship|ROH Tag Team Champions]], the first championship Punk won in [[Ring of Honor]]]]
Punk joined [[Ring of Honor]] initially as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], due to ROH employing a position with emphasis on wrestling and less on promos, but was quickly turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in a feud with [[Scott Levy|Raven]] that featured numerous variants of [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|no disqualification matches]]. At the same time Punk joined the wrestling promotion [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|NWA:Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], where he was paired with [[Brian Wohl|Julio Dinero]] as, ironically, members of [[Scott Levy|Raven]]'s TNA [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] '''[[Raven's Nest#The Gathering|The Gathering]]'''.

Punk started climbing the ranks of ROH with notable achievements including coming second at the  ''Second Anniversary'' show during the tournament to crown the first [[ROH Pure Championship|ROH Pure Champion]], losing to [[A.J. Styles]] in the finals, and winning the [[ROH World Tag Team Championship|ROH Tag Team Championship]] twice with Colt Cabana as the '''[[Second City Saints]]''', both times defeating [[Briscoe Brothers|The Briscoe Brothers]] to win the championship. Circa [[October]], [[2003]] Punk, along with [[Steve Corino]], was hired as the first head trainers of the [[Ring of Honor#ROH wrestling school|Ring of Honor wrestling school]],<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="slamcanoe">{{cite web| url = http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/06/06/1073740.html| title = CM Punk mulls over his future| accessdate = 17 April| accessyear = 2007| author = Hillhouse, Dave| date = 2005-06-06| publisher = SLAM!

Meanwhile in TNA on [[February 25]], [[2004]] Punk had a physical scuffle with [[Teddy Hart]] that was broken up by [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] outside of a restaurant shortly before a TNA show stemming from an ROH show in which Hart performed [[Teddy Hart#Ring of Honor|three unplanned spots]] putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury. Despite popular belief that this lead to his release from TNA, fueled by the fact Punk didn't appear on TNA after this incident, Punk has explained that this had no bearing on his TNA career and the reason he stopped appearing on TNA was that TNA officials believed that he and Dinero had not gotten over as [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], having turned on Raven becoming a tag team managed by their old rival [[James Mitchell (wrestler)|James Mitchell]], and so the [[Angle (professional wrestling)|angle]] had been put on hold.<ref name="tna">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040608011954/http://www.chicagowrestling.com/AL/punk52904.htm|title=CM Punk Talks|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006|author=Lagattolla, Al|date=2004-05-29|publisher=Chicago Wrestling}}</ref> Punk quit TNA in [[March]], [[2004]] during the [[Rob Feinstein]] controversy after having a dispute with the TNA offices over his ability to compete in ROH following a TNA order that their contracted wrestlers were to no longer wrestle in ROH.<ref name="slamcanoebio">{{cite web| url = http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/cmpunk.html| title = CM Punk| accessdate = 17 April| accessyear = 2007| author = Milner, John| publisher = SLAM! Sports}}</ref>

In ROH Punk faced off against [[ROH World Championship|ROH World Champion]] [[Samoa Joe]] for the championship in a famous three match series. The first match, on [[June 12]], [[2004]] at ''World Title Classic'' in [[Dayton, Ohio]], resulted in a 60 minute time-limit draw when neither Punk nor Joe could pin or cause the other to submit in the sixty minutes. The second match between Samoa Joe and CM Punk was planned to have occurred on [[December 4]], [[2004]] but because [[Steve Corino]] was pulled from a match with Samoa Joe by [[Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX|Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE]] the second match was hastily rescheduled on [[October 11]], [[2004]] for [[October 16]] in Punk's hometown of [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name="joepunk" /> At ''Joe vs. Punk II'' on [[October 16]] they wrestled to a second 60 minute draw. In addition to becoming Ring of Honor's best selling DVD at that point, the match received the first 5-star rating by [[Dave Meltzer]]'s ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'' for a match in North America since 1997.<ref name="joepunk" /> Joe ended the series by defeating Punk in the third and final match on [[December 4]], 2004 at ''All-Star Extravaganza II'' in which there was a no time limit stipulation.

[[Image:Punkrohchampion.jpg|thumb|left|175px|CM Punk holding the [[ROH World Championship]] at ''Death Before Dishonor III'' during his confrontation with [[Christopher Daniels]]]]
In June 2005, Punk accepted a deal with [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], after wrestling try-out matches on its ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night HEAT]]'' show. Even though he had accepted the deal, Punk went on to defeat [[Austin Aries]] to win the [[ROH World Championship]] on [[June 18]], [[2005]] at ''Death Before Dishonor III'' with the [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pepsi Plunge]].

Immediately after the match Punk proceeded to [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turn]] heel and started an angle where he threatened to bring the ROH World Championship to WWE with him. For weeks, Punk teased the ROH locker room and the ROH fans as well as mocking the championship he possessed, going so far as to sign his WWE contract on it. A notable part of this angle was [[Mick Foley]] making several ROH appearances, attempting to convince Punk to do the right thing and defend the title on his way out.

On [[August 12]], [[2005]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]] Punk lost the ROH World Championship to [[Jamie Noble|James Gibson]] in a four corner elimination match consisting of himself, Gibson, [[Samoa Joe]] and [[Christopher Daniels]], who re-debuted after a year and half long absence following the Rob Feinstein controversy a few minutes after Punk turned heel, when Gibson countered the Pepsi Plunge with a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Super|Super]] [[Powerbomb#Double underhook powerbomb|Tiger Bomb]]. His final match in Ring of Honor took place on [[August 13]], [[2005]] against Colt Cabana in a 2 out of 3 falls match, which he lost. In his last match, he was visibly crying, and was showered with streamers when he posed in the middle of the ring.

Punk reappeared at the ROH show ''Unscripted II'' on [[February 11]], [[2006]], due to a severe snowstorm which prevented several ROH wrestlers from attending. Punk asked for permission from WWE official Tommy Dreamer to appear so he could help out ROH. Dreamer approved and Punk appeared during the night to fill gaps where others were supposed to appear. In the main event, he teamed with [[Bryan Danielson]] to wrestle and ultimately defeat Jimmy Rave and Adam Pearce.

===World Wrestling Entertainment===
====Ohio Valley Wrestling====
Punk was assigned to [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]], a WWE developmental territory. On [[September 26]], 2005 in his OVW television debut, Punk suffered a ruptured eardrum and broken nose at the hands of [[Danny Inferno]], after he was hit by an [[Botch (professional wrestling)|overly]] [[Stiff (professional wrestling)|stiff]] [[Punch (strike)|right hand]]. Despite the injury, Punk finished the match and quickly recovered.<ref name="firstmatch">{{cite web|url=http://www.ovwrestling.com/news/results/sep2005/092405.htm|title=09/24/2005 - DAVIS ARENA|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006|author=Sherman, Dale|date=2005-09-24|publisher=Ohio Valley Wrestling}}</ref><ref name="lordsofpaininjury">{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2005_/articles/1126805425.php|title=Latest on released WWE wrestler, Ken Kennedy, CM Punk injury|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006|author=Cantor, Brian|date=2005-09-15|format=php|publisher=Lords of Pain}}</ref>

On [[November 9]], 2005, Punk became the [[OVW Television Championship|OVW Television Champion]] after defeating [[Ken Doane]].<ref name="tvtitlewin">{{cite web|url=http://www.ovwrestling.com/news/results/nov2005/111205.htm|title=11/12/2005 - DAVIS ARENA|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006|author=Sherman, Dale|date=2005-11-12|publisher=Ohio Valley Wrestling}}</ref> This led immediately to a feud between Punk and [[Brent Albright]], who had previously been feuding with Doane for the television championship and had lost his chance to wrestle Doane after Punk had hit him with a chair so he himself could wrestle Doane. This led to a series of matches, including one which ended in overtime with Albright having Punk submit to Albright's finisher, the [[Professional wrestling holds#Fujiwara armbar|Crowbar]], however Punk was able to keep the championship as he had not agreed to the extra time.<ref name="crowbartapout">{{cite web|url=http://www.ovwrestling.com/news/results/dec2005/121705.htm|title=12/17/2005 - DAVIS ARENA|accessdate=26 September| accessyear=2006|author=Sherman, Dale|date=2005-12-17|publisher=Ohio Valley Wrestling}}</ref> On [[January 4]], 2006, Punk lost the OVW Television Championship during a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|three way dance]] between himself, Albright and Doane. Doane was injured halfway through the match and could not continue and was replaced by [[Aaron Stevens (wrestler)|Aaron "The Idol" Stevens]]. Punk submitted to Albright's Crowbar and was eliminated but after interference by Punk, Stevens was able to get the [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)|pin]] on Albright to become the new OVW Television Champion.<ref name="threewaydance">{{cite web|url=http://ovwrestling.com/news/results/jan2006/0107/010706.htm|title=1/07/2006 - DAVIS ARENA|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006|author=Sherman, Dale|date=2006-01-07|publisher=Ohio Valley Wrestling}}</ref>
[[Image:Punkwinsovw.jpg|thumb|146px|CM Punk after winning the [[OVW Heavyweight Championship]], ending his long feud with [[Brent Albright]]]]
The feud continued after a short period in which Albright and Punk were a tag team, but they became opponents again after Albright wanted the respect of Punk who would never give it to him and instead proceeded to "punk out" (get the better of) Albright repeatedly. This continued for weeks with Punk always getting the better of Albright until a [[Turn (professional wrestling)|double turn]] occurred on [[February 1]], 2006 when Albright turned heel during a tag match allowing [[The Spirit Squad]] to beat Punk and, in doing so, turning Punk [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]].<ref name="faceturn">{{cite web| url=http://ovwrestling.com/news/results/feb2006/0204/020406.htm|title=2/04/2006 - DAVIS ARENA|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006|author=Sherman, Dale|date=2006-02-04|publisher=Ohio Valley Wrestling}}</ref>

During this time CM Punk had a minor appearance at [[WrestleMania 22]] on [[April 2]], [[2006]] as one of the [[gangster]]s who rode a 1930s era car to the ring before [[John Cena]]'s entrance.<ref name="wmgangster">{{cite web|url=http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/pictures/c/cmpunk/19.jpg|title = 19.jpg|accessdate=26 September|accessyear=2006|date=2006-04-02|publisher=Obsessed With Wrestling|quote=CM Punk as a gangster during [[John Cena]]'s entrance}}</ref>

==Gimmick==
Punk has adopted his real-life following of the [[straight edge]] movement as his professional wrestling [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], but the gimmick uses different elements of Punk's personality and the beliefs of the straight edge movement depending on his [[Professional wrestling slang#A|alignment]]. While portraying a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]], the gimmick tends to be that of Punk's normal personality,<ref name="punkshoot" /> largely indifferent to others who drink [[alcohol]], smoke [[tobacco]], partake in [[recreational drug use]] or have [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], but emphasizing the social discipline involved with [[abstinence]]. Conversely, his [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] personality tends to be that of a [[Hardline (subculture)|hardliner]], especially the elitist and superior attitudes possessed by hardliners - defined by Punk's common mantra during heel [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promos]] that, because he is straight edge, he is "better than you".<ref name="punkshoot" /> Regardless of alignment, Punk performs the straight edge symbol of crossing his arms in an X formation while having the letter X written on the back of his hands, usually drawn on his wrist tape.

An integral part of Punk's [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] is that of the numerous [[tattoo]]s that adorn his body, some of which have come to become symbols associated with Punk as well as mantras and declarations that have been integrated into his gimmick. The tattoos as a whole, due to their large quantity and variety, have also become an attribute identifiable to Punk. The most important of the individual tattoos in Punk's character, whether through association, symbol, or mantra, are: 
*A [[Pepsi-Cola|Pepsi]] logo on his left shoulder inspired the names of two of his signature moves. He got the tattoo as a joke, as many [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] members in his school were getting beer logos tattooed on their body, so Punk, a keen Pepsi drinker, chose to receive a Pepsi tattoo to emphasize his straight edge beliefs.<ref name="wojick" /> The tattoo is also a reference to former [[Minor Threat]] guitarist [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], who had a [[Coca-Cola]] tattoo and explained this by saying "I like Coca-Cola". When people inquire about Punk's Pepsi tattoo, he often replies "I like Pepsi" in a similar fashion.<ref name="punkshoot" /> The Pepsi logo has become a symbol of Punk himself, wearing the logo on his ring gear in the [[independent circuit]] as well as a slightly modified Pepsi logo being used as part of his [[Jumbotron|TitanTron]] entrance video.<ref name="tron">{{cite video|people=CM Punk|year=2006|title=Entrance video|url=http://www.wwe.com/content/media/video/tvshows/ecw/entrance_videos/0724cmpunkentvid|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> 
*The words "[[Straight Edge]]" are spelled out on his stomach. This tattoo is one of Punk's oldest tattoos<ref name="wwemag">{{cite journal|author=CM Punk|year=2006|month=October|title=The Illustrated Man|journal=WWE Magazine|pages=13}}</ref> and has been referred to by Punk as his identity.<ref name="cheesegrater">{{cite video | people = CM Punk | url = http://www.rohwrestling.com/shoponline.asp?point=moreinfo&catid=&id=1125&pRange=0&iCurrentPage=1 |title =  Best Of American Super Juniors Tournament|medium = DVD|publisher = Ring of Honor|date = 2 April |year = 2005 |accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>
*A [[sleeve tattoo]] on his left arm entitled "luck is for losers", a mantra used on some of the choices for Punk's first [[Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW]] [[T-shirt]],<ref name="shirt">{{cite web|url=http://punk-wrestling.com/coppermine/thumbnails.php?album=1|title=ECW T-Shirt Designs|accessmonthday=2 October|accessyear=2006|format=php|publisher=Punk-Wrestling}}</ref> that features twists on numerous symbols of [[good luck]].
*His knuckles spell out "DRUG FREE" when placed together, "DRUG" on the right knuckles and "FREE" on the left. This tattoo is often used in wrestling as a taunting gesture to the crowd and opponents.

Punk's character and gimmick have been parodied by the wrestling federation [[Chikara Pro Wrestling|CHIKARA]] with the character [[Necro Butcher|CP Munk]], the straight edge [[chipmunk]]. The character is simply a chipmunk [[mascot]] costume which includes references to Punk such as X marked wrist tape, a Pepsi logo on the costume's left shoulder, and a sped-up version of Punk's best-known independent circuit theme song ''[[Miseria Cantare - The Beginning]]'', as performed by the band [[AFI (band)|AFI]].<ref name="cpmunk2">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/24/15028|title=Tape review: Chikara, "Negative Balance," Aug. 13, w/Hero-Kingston, Claudio-Quack, Cannon-Reckless|accessmonthday=16 October|accessyear=2006|author=Vetter, Chris|date=2005-10-04|format=cgi|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|quote=CP Munk is a wrestler in a chipmunk costume, like a school mascot outfit.

==Personal life==
Punk was born, raised and lived in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] with a father with alcohol problems,<ref name="wwemag" /><ref name="jon" /> two younger sisters<ref name="joepunk" /> and a brother who grew up to also be a professional wrestler, using the [[ring name]] Mike Broox,<ref name="chickmagnets" /><ref name="cagematchde" /> however Punk and Mike had a falling out several years ago after Mike embezzled several thousand dollars from the Lunatic Wrestling Federation.<ref name="mikebrooks">{{cite web|url=http://members5.boardhost.com/wrestlingnews/msg/62.html|title=CM PUNK INTERVIEW - Part 2|accessmonthday=September 26|accessyear=2006|author=Lagattolla, Al|date=2001-05-28}}</ref> Punk first wished to pursue a career in professional wrestling after watching [[Roddy Piper]] crack a coconut over [[Jimmy Snuka]]'s head during an edition of the ''[[Piper's Pit]]''.<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="punkcabana" /> While viewing his alcoholic father and reading that alcoholism may have been hereditary Punk made an agreement with himself to abstain from drinking alcohol to prevent the situation from occurring.<ref name="punkshoot" /> During high school Punk discovered the [[punk rock]] music genre, most importantly [[Minor Threat]], and by extension found the [[punk subculture]] which in turn lead to the discovery of the [[straight edge]] culture, which Punk himself adopted.<ref name="punkshoot" /> After high school and beginning his wrestling career Punk moved out of the family house and lived for a time with fellow professional wrestler [[Cathy Corino|Allison Danger]].<ref name="punkshoot" /> Punk later moved into an apartment with [[Ace Steel]],<ref name="joepunk" /> however since then Punk has made reference to living alone in Chicago. Punk worked other jobs to support himself in his early career, the last of which was as a laboratory technician for [[Underwriters Laboratories]] until he was fired due to poor conduct and work ethic in October, 2002.<ref name="punkshoot" /> Punk has stated being fired was the happiest day of his life and promised himself to never work a [[day job]] again.<ref name="punkcabana" />

In relationships Punk has made reference to two ex-girlfriends in his early career<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="punkcabana" /> and later was romantically linked to professional wrestlers [[Shannon Spruill]]<ref name="daffneyrajahrecap">{{cite web|url=http://rajah.com/base/node/3899|title=Mick Foley Discusses WWE Return & Flair, Daffney Discusses TNA & Diva Search|accessmonthday=27 September|accessyear=2006|author=Cash, Chris|coauthors=Walk, Henry|date=2005-11-12|publisher=Rajah|quote=On the topic of CM Punk and their relationship, she said that the break-up was partially contributed to the two never being able to see each other (her in Louisville and him in Philly).}}</ref> and [[Tracy Brookshaw]],<ref name="joepunk" /> both of whom had managed him in ROH.

==Non-wrestling TV appearances==
CM Punk made an appearance on the [[February 16]], [[2004]] episode of [[Monster Garage]], "Box Truck Wrestling Car", performing a short match with [[Samoa Joe]].<ref name="ihsjt">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/24/14286|title=Interview Highlights: Samoa Joe talks about his decision to sign with TNA, his future|accessmonthday=8 November|accessyear=2006|date=2005-08-01|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref> On [[October 31]], [[2006]], CM Punk joined the [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] (TAPS) to shoot the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] special ''[[Ghost Hunters#Specials|Ghost Hunters Live]]'', which was a six-hour show broadcast live Halloween night from the [[Stanley Hotel]] in [[Estes Park]], [[Colorado]].
