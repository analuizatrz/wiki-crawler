'''''Die Hard''''' is a [[Hollywood]] action film released in [[1988 in film|1988]]. It was written by Jeb Stuart and [[Steven E. de Souza]], stars [[Bruce Willis]], [[Bonnie Bedelia]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Reginald VelJohnson]], and [[William Atherton]], and was directed by [[John McTiernan]]. A huge critical and commercial success, ''Die Hard'' propelled Willis' film career and established Rickman as a popular portrayer of villains in American film. 

The movie is based on a [[1979 in literature|1979]] novel by [[Roderick Thorp]] titled ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (1979 novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'', itself a sequel to the book ''[[The Detective]]'', which was previously made into a [[1968 in film|1968]] movie starring [[Frank Sinatra]]. 

==Plot==
On [[December 24]], [[1988]], [[John McClane]], a [[detective]] with the [[NYPD]], arrives in [[LA]] to attend a [[Christmas]] [[Party]] reunion with his estranged wife Holly. He is taken by [[limousine]] driver Argyle from [[Los Angeles International Airport]] to her workplace, the highrise Nakatomi Towers. Joining the party late, McClane finally finds Holly and they immediately get into an argument over her use of her maiden name Gennaro. Holly leaves McClane alone in a small room near the party.

A gang led by the German terrorist Hans Gruber invades and secures the building, under the pretense of wishing to secure the release of various [[terrorist]] operatives. The party-goers are subdued and it is revealed that the group is really comprised of thieves who plan to steal millions of dollars in [[bearer bond]]s from the building's security vault. When Holly's boss Takagi does not provide the vault combination, he is killed and Theo, the gang's technical mastermind, begins disabling the sequential vault locks. 

McClane manages to slip away during the round-up of the party-goers, albeit without his shoes. His attempt to summon help via the building's fire alarm brings him into confrontation with a gang member named Tony. He kills Tony, prompting his vengeful brother Karl to lead a hunt for the policeman through the building. McClane secures the attention of patrolling [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officer [[Al Powell]] by dropping the body of one of his pursuers onto the hood of the officer's car.

The LAPD and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] respond in force, but this merely accelerates Gruber's original timetable. McClane continues his fight from within, picking off gang-members one by one, with Powell as his only ally outside the building. After McClane captures Gruber's vital supply of explosive [[detonator]]s, Gruber finds himself in an unexpected face-to-face confrontation with the detective; the mastermind's attempt at pretending to be an escaped hostage is successful enough to lead to the recovery of the detonators and the injuring of McClane's bare feet. Back outside the building, an irresponsible TV reporter named Richard Thornburg accidentally alerts Gruber to the fact that Holly is McClane's wife. He takes her aside as a special hostage.

McClane realizes that Gruber's plan is to blow up the hostages on the roof of the building, covering the gang's escape. McClane gets the hostages back off the roof, but Gruber still sets off the explosion. McClane escapes the blast by jumping over the side of the building with a [[fire hose]] around his waist and shooting his way into an office a couple of stories down. Meanwhile, thanks to the FBI turning off the building's power, the vault's last lock opens, but when Theo goes to the building's carpark to prepare the gang's getaway [[ambulance]], Argyle rams the vehicle with his limousine and knocks Theo unconscious. 

McClane confronts Gruber one last time high up in the tower, with Holly being held at gunpoint. McClane tricks Gruber with a faked surrender, then shoots the man, who falls to his death. As McClane and his wife leave the building, the seemingly-indestructible Karl reappears one last time, and is gunned down by Powell, who had earlier confided to McClane that mistakenly shooting and killing a teenager had rendered him emotionally unable to draw his gun. Holly and John are approached by Thornburg, who is still relentlessly angling for a fresh scoop. Holly punches the reporter and the couple departs the scene in Argyle's battered limo.

==Production details==
The Nakatomi building is actually [[Twentieth Century Fox]] headquarters, and the company charged itself rent for use of the (unfinished) building as if the production were simply another tenant of the building, as well as damages for the destruction of the sidewalk guardrail destroyed by the LAPD armored personnel carrier.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} 

According to commentary from the movie's DVD release, Alan Rickman's surprise when Gruber is dropped from the building is genuine: the director chose to release Rickman a full second before he expected it in order to get genuine surprise, a move which angered Rickman. The text commentary track also reveals that the shooting script did not originally feature the meeting between McClane and Gruber pretending to be a hostage; it was only written in when it was discovered that Rickman could do an American accent.

Whenever Gruber fires his weapon, the scene cuts away. McTiernan did this to avoid showing Rickman's involuntary habit of flinching when the gun recoiled.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trivia for ''Die Hard''|accessdate=2007-07-04|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0095016/trivia}}</ref>

In the German [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]], the names and backgrounds of the German-born terrorists were changed into English forms (mostly into their British equivalents): Hans became Jack, Karl became Charlie, Heinrich turned into Henry.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} The new background depicts them as radical Irish activists having gone freelance and for profit rather than ideals.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} This was because German terrorism (especially by the [[Rote Armee Fraktion]]) was still considered a sensitive issue by the German government in the 1980s.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

''Die Hard'' was renamed ''Big Building Fight'' in Thailand.

==Reception==
When ''Die Hard'' was released, it was considered one of the best action films of its era. This is probably in part due to the fact that there are few ''artificial'' [[plot point]]s in the story. It is said to have reinvented the action genre and set the 90s for action/thriller movies such as ''[[Under Siege]],'' ''[[Passenger 57]]'' and ''[[Speed (film)|Speed]]''.  "''Die Hard'' on a _____" became a common way to describe the plot of many of the action films that came in its wake. For example, for the 1990s action flick, ''Speed,'' was called "Die Hard on a bus"<ref> http://www.foxhome.com/diehard/trinity/dh1/</ref> The movie was also responsible for creating the "action star" archetype that is a far more fallible and human hero, wearing few pieces of clothing, speaking few words (including "[[one-liners]]") and always having a rough look across their face.<ref>''The Movies of the Eighties'' (1990) by Ron Base and David Haslam.</ref> ''Die Hard'' grossed $80,707,729 at the U.S. Box Office.<ref name="yahoodiehard">[[Yahoo!]] Die Hard Movie Details</ref> 

It was highly acclaimed by critics<ref name="rottentomatoes_diehard">[[RottenTomatoes]] Aggregated Film Reviews</ref> and spawned three sequels ''[[Die Hard 2: Die Harder]] (1990), [[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), and ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'', which was released on [[June 27]] [[2007]] in the States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/ |title=Live Free or Die Hard (2007) |work=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>

''Die Hard'' was listed at #39 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[100 Years, 100 Thrills]] List of the most thrilling American movies of all time in 2001.

In 2003, Hans Gruber was listed at #46 on the AFI's 50 greatest villains list from their 100 Years, 100 Heroes and Villains special. Surprisingly, McClane was not listed among the heroes, which some fans speculate is due to his perception as more of an [[anti-hero]].

John McClane's infamous line (imitated by Hans Gruber in the film's final minutes), "Yippee Ki Yay, Motherfucker" was voted as #96 of "The 100 Greatest Movie Lines" by Premiere Magazine in 2007.  In Urdu the phrase translates to "eat this".

In the [[22 June]] [[2007]] issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', it was named the number one best action movie of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN1448232520070615 |title="Die Hard" tops magazine list of best action films |work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>
