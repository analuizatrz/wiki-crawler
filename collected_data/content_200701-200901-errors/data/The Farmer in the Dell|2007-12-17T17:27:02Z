'''The Farmer in the Dell''' is a children's song, or [[nursery rhyme]]. It tells the story of a [[farmer]] in a [[Dell_(landform)|dell]] who takes a wife, who takes a child, who takes a [[nurse]], etc, until finally a [[rat]] takes a [[cheese]], and the cheese "stands alone".

===Variations===
Like most children's songs, there are geographic variations, and in the [[United Kingdom]] this is known as ''The Farmer's In His Den''. The 'Hi-Ho, the derry-o' is variously replaced with 'Ee-i, tiddly-i' in [[London]], 'Ee-i, the addio' (for instance in [[Northern England]]), and 'Ee-i, ee-i' (for instance in the [[West Country]]). In the UK, the rat is replaced with a dog and in the final verse, all other players pat the dog or alternatively its bone.

==Circle game==
Ten children (or more) join hands and dance around the FARMER, who stands in the center of the circle as they sing. At the end of the first verse,the FARMER chooses his WIFE, who joins him inside the circle. At the end of the next verse, the WIFE takes a CHILD, and so on, until the last verse when everyone is in the circle except the CHEESE, who stands alone. Whoever ends up being the CHEESE becomes the FARMER for the next round.



==Trivia==
*On the [[HBO]] original television series ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'', the Robin Hood-like thief [[Omar Little]], who routinely robs Baltimore drug dealers at gunpoint, fearlessly whistles ''The Farmer in the Dell'' as he approaches, often punctuated with "The cheese stands alone."
*The book ''[[I Am the Cheese]]'' takes its name from the song.
*In the book "The Secret History" by Donna Tartt, the character Bunny sings The Famer in the Dale to taunt the other characters who have accidentally killed a farmer.
*The Cheese Stands Alone is the name of a card in the [[Unglued]] set of [[Wizards of the Coast]]'s [[Magic: The Gathering]] trading card game. It also appears as a goal in the [[Fluxx]] card game--to win when it is in play, one must have the 'Cheese' card as the only keeper in possession.
*There is a [[French language]] version called "Le fermier dans son pré". In the end "le fromage est battu" ("the cheese is beaten")
*There is a [[Swedish language]] version called "En bonde i vår by" (''A farmer in our village'').
*The song is featured as one of the songs in the Wee Sing video ''[[Grandpa's Magical Toys]]'' and there is a [[farmer]] in the special that symbolizes the song.
