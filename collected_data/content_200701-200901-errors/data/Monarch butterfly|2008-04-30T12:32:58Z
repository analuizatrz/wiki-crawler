The '''monarch''' (''Danaus plexippus'') is a [[milkweed butterfly]] ([[subfamily]] Danainae), in the family [[Nymphalidae]]. It is perhaps the best known of all [[North America]]n butterflies. Since the 19th century, it is also found in [[New Zealand]], and has been known in [[Australia]] since 1871. [http://www.amonline.net.au/factsheets/monarch.htm] [http://calamvalecreek.awardspace.com/regal.html] In Australia it is also known as the wanderer butterfly. [http://bugs.bio.usyd.edu.au/Entomology/internalAnatomy/imagePages/wandererCaterpillar.html] In Europe it is resident in the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Madeira]], and is found as a migrant in [[Russia]], [[Azores]], [[Sweden]] and [[Spain]]. Its wings feature an easily recognizable orange and black pattern, with a wingspan of 8.5&ndash;12.5 cm (3.34 in&ndash;4.92in). (The [[viceroy butterfly]] has a similar size, color, and pattern, but can be distinguished by an extra black stripe across the hindwing.)  Female monarchs have darker veins on their wings, and the males have a spot in the center of each hindwing [http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~pjbryant/biodiv/lepidopt/danaidae/monarchm.htm] from which [[pheromone]]s are released. Males are also slightly larger. 

==Taxonomy==
The common name “monarch” was [[coined]] in 1874 by [[Samuel Hubbard Scudder|Samuel H. Scudder]] because “it is one of the largest of our butterflies, and rules a vast domain”.<ref name =Crispin>{{cite book |last=Guppy |first=Crispin S. |coauthors=Jon H.

It was first placed in the genus ''[[Papilio]]''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=Carolus | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema Naturae | location=Stockholm | publisher=Holmiae (Laurentii Salvii) | date=1758 | pages=p.471 | url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/dms/load/img/?search=1&IDDOC=265138&pid=PPN362053006&page=471&zoomfactor=100&firstIDDOC=265101&lastIDDOC=265150&prevIDDOC=265137&nextIDDOC=265139&pageturn=475& | language=Latin | oclc=174638949 | accessdate=2008-02-04}}</ref> In 1780, Kluk used the monarch as the [[type species]] for a new genus; ''[[Danaus (genus)|Danaus]]''. Named after [[Danaus]] (Greek [[wikt:Δαναός|Δαναός]]), a mythical king of Egypt. The species name, ''plexippus'', refers to [[Plexippus]], one of the 50 sons of [[Aegyptus]], Danaus’ twin brother.<ref name =Crispin/>

This butterfly is closely related to one or two very similar [[species]] which were formerly considered to form the ''Danaus (Danaus)'' [[subgenus]] (see Smith ''et al.'' 2005). One is the [[Jamaican monarch]], ''Danaus cleophile'', of [[Jamaica]] and [[Hispaniola]].

The other is a  butterfly which is almost indistinguishable from the monarch as an adult (the pupae are somewhat more different) and occurs south of the [[Amazonas]] river. This [[taxon]], ''[[Danaus erippus]]'' ("[[Southern monarch]]"), is often considered a [[subspecies]] of the monarch butterfly proper. Analysis of [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]], [[mtDNA]] 12S [[rRNA]] and [[Cytochrome c oxidase|cytochrome ''c'' oxidase]] [[subunit]] I, and [[nuclear DNA]] 18S rRNA and [[Elongation factor|EF1]] subunit α [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data (Smith ''et al.'' 2005) indicates that it is better considered a distinct species.

However, as a species the southern monarch is only comparatively recently [[evolution|evolved]]. In all likelihood, its ancestors separated from the monarch's population some 2 [[mya (unit)|mya]], at the end of the [[Pliocene]], when [[sea level]]s were higher and the entire [[Amazonas]] lowland was a vast expanse of [[brackish]] swamp that offered hardly any butterfly habitat (Smith ''et al.'' 2005).

Following the review of Smith ''et al.'' (2005), two subspecies are nowadays recognized:
* ''Danaus plexippus plexippus''
*:The migratory subspecies known from most of the USA
* ''Danaus plexippus megalippe''
*:The non-migratory subspecies which is found from [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] southwards, throughout the [[Caribbean]] and [[Central America]] to the [[Amazon River]]. This has several local [[form (zoology)|form]]s:
** ''Danaus plexippus megalippe'' forma ''leucogyne''
** ''Danaus plexippus megalippe'' forma ''portoricensis''
** ''Danaus plexippus megalippe'' forma ''tobagi''

== Migration ==
Monarchs are especially noted for their lengthy annual migration. In North America they make massive southward migrations starting in August until the first frost. A northward migration takes place in the spring. (In Australia, they make limited migrations in cooler areas, [http://www.amonline.net.au/factsheets/monarch.htm] but the [[blue tiger butterfly]] is better known in Australia for its lengthy migration. [http://calamvalecreek.awardspace.com/regal.html]) Female monarchs deposit eggs for the next generation during these migrations. By the end of October, the population of the [[Rocky Mountains]] migrates to the [[sanctuary|sanctuaries]] in the area of [[Angangueo]], [[Ocampo, Michoacán|Ocampo]], [[Zitácuaro]] and [[El Rosario]] in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Michoacán]]. The western population [[wikt:overwinter|overwinters]] in various sites in central coastal [[California]], [[United States]], notably in [[Pacific Grove, California|Pacific Grove]] and [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]]. 

The length of these journeys exceeds the normal lifespan of most monarchs, which is less than two months for butterflies born in early summer. The last generation of the summer enters into a non-reproductive phase known as diapause and may live seven months or more. [http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~pjbryant/biodiv/lepidopt/danaidae/monarchm.htm] During diapause, butterflies fly to one of many overwintering sites. The generation that overwinters generally does not reproduce until it leaves the overwintering site sometime in February and March. It is thought that the overwinter population may reach as far north as [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]] during the spring migration. It is the second, third and fourth generations that return to their northern locations in the United States and [[Canada]] in the spring. How the species manages to return to the same overwintering spots over a gap of several generations is still a subject of research; the flight patterns appear to be inherited, based on a combination of [[circadian rhythm]] and the position of the sun in the sky.<ref>

Monarch butterflies are one of the few insects capable of making transatlantic crossings. They are becoming more common in [[Bermuda]] due to increased usage of [[milkweed]] as an ornamental plant in flower gardens. Monarch butterflies born in Bermuda remain year round due to the island's mild climate. 

A few monarchs turn up in the far southwest of [[Great Britain]] in years when the wind conditions are right, and have been sighted as far east as Long Bennington. Monarchs can also be found in [[New Zealand]].  On the islands of [[Hawaii]] no migrations have been noted.

== Reproduction ==
The mating period for the overwinter population occurs in the spring, just prior to migration from the overwintering sites. The courtship is fairly simple and less dependent on chemical pheromones in comparison with other species in its genus. [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Danaus_plexippus.html] Courtship is composed of two distinct stages, the aerial phase and the ground phase. During the aerial phase, the male pursues, nudges, and eventually takes down the female. Copulation occurs during the ground phase and involves the transfer of a spermatophore from the male to the female. Along with sperm, the spermatophore is thought to provide the female with energy resources that aid her in carrying out reproduction and remigration.  The overwinter population returns only as far north as they need to go to find the early milkweed growth; in the case of the eastern butterflies that is commonly southern Texas. The life cycle of a monarch includes a change of form called complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. The monarch goes through four radically different stages:

# The eggs are laid by the females during spring and summer breeding months.
# The eggs hatch, revealing worm-like larva, the [[caterpillar]]s.  The caterpillars consume their egg cases, then feed on [[milkweed]], and sequester substances called [[cardenolide]]s, a type of [[cardiac glycoside]]s. During the caterpillar stage, monarchs store energy in the form of [[fat]] and [[nutrient]]s to carry them through the non-feeding [[pupa]] stage.
# In the [[pupa]] or [[Pupa#Chrysalis|chrysalis]] stage, the caterpillar spins a silk pad on a twig, leaf, etc, and hangs from this pad by its last pair of prolegs. It hangs upside down in the shape of a 'J', and then molts, leaving itself encased in an articulated green [[exoskeleton]]. At this point, hormonal changes occur, leading to the development of a butterfly.  The chrysalis darkens (actually becomes transparent) a day before it emerges, and its orange and black wings can be seen.
# The mature butterfly emerges after about two pupal weeks and hangs from the split chrysalis for several hours until its wings are dry (often in the morning).  Meanwhile fluids are pumped into the crinkled wings until they become full and stiff.  Some of this orangy fluid drips from the wings. Finally (usually in the afternoon) the monarch spreads its wings, quivers them to be sure they are stiff, and then flies in a circle and away, to feed on a variety of flowers, including milkweed flowers, red clover, and goldenrod.  

Monarchs can live a life of twenty to eighty weeks in a garden having their host ''[[Asclepias]]'' plants and sufficient flowers for nectar.  This is especially true if the flower garden happens to be surrounded by native forest that seems to be lacking in flowers.

== Defense against predators ==
[[Image:Mexican milkweed.jpg‎|right|thumb|[[Mexican milkweed]], one of several species of milkweed used by the monarch]]
Monarchs are foul-tasting and poisonous due to the presence of [[cardenolide aglycones]] in their bodies, which the caterpillars ingest as they feed on milkweed. [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Danaus_plexippus.html] Both forms advertise their unpalatability with bright colors and areas of high contrast on the skin or wings. This phenomenon is known as [[aposematism]].

Monarchs share this defense with the even more unpleasant-tasting and similar-appearing [[viceroy butterfly]], in an example of [[Mimicry#M.C3.BCllerian|Müllerian]] [[mimic]]ry. (Viceroys were at one time believed to be [[Mimicry#Batesian|Batesian]] mimics of monarchs.)

Many people like to attract monarchs by growing a [[Butterfly gardening|butterfly garden]]. Others enjoy raising them for pleasure or for educational purposes. For migrating flocks, sanctuaries have been created at favorite wintering locations; Even [[tourism]] revenue is thus generated.

Many schools also enjoy growing, and attending to monarch butterflies, starting with the caterpillar form. When the butterflies reach adulthood they are then released into the wild.

==Threats==
Recent illegal deforestation of the monarch's overwintering grounds have led to a drastic reduction in the butterfly's population. Efforts to classify it as a protected species and to restore its habitat are under way. Mexican authorities expected a significant increase in the monarch population in the 2005-2006 season.

===Parasites===
Parasites include the [[Tachinidae|tachinid]] fly ''Lesperia archippivora''. Parasitized larvae complete their moult, suspend, but die before pupation. At that time one white [[maggot]] comes out of the larvae, suspended by a [[silk|silken]] thread. The maggot then forms a brown pupa on the ground.<ref name = Brewer>{{cite journal |last=Brewer |first=Jo |coauthors=Gerard M. Thomas |year=1966 |title=Causes of death encountered during rearing of Danaus plexippus (Danaidae) |journal=Journal of The Lepidopterist’s Society |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=235-238 |url=http://research.yale.edu/peabody/jls/pdfs/1960s/1966/1966-20(4)235-Brewer.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= 2008-04-13 | laysummary =http://research.yale.edu/peabody/jls/htms/1960s/1966-20(4)235-Brewer.htm }}</ref>

The bacteria ''[[Micrococcus]] flacidifex danai'' also infects the larvae and causes “black death”. As usual, just before pupation the larvae migrate to a horizontal surface. They die a few hours later, attached only by one pair of prolegs, thorax and abdomen hanging limp. The body turns black shortly after. The bacteria ''[[Pseudomonas]] aeriginosa'' has no invasive powers, but causes [[secondary infection]]s in weakened insects. It is a common cause of death in laboratory reared insects.<ref name = Brewer/>

The [[protozoa]]n ''[[Ophryocystis elektroscirrha]]'' is another parasite of the monarch. It infects the [[hypodermis|subcutaneous tissues]] and propagates by [[spore]]s formed during the pupal stage. The spores are found over all of the body of infected butterflies, with the greatest number on the abdomen. These spores are passed, from [[vertical transmission|female to caterpillar]], when spores rub off during egg-laying and are then ingested by caterpillars. Severely infected individuals are weak, unable to expand their wings, or unable to eclose, and have a shortened lifespan but probably occur a low frequencies in nature. This is not the case in laboratory or commercial rearing, where after a few generations all individuals can be infected.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Leong |first= K. L. H. |coauthors=M. A. Yoshimura, H.

===Predators===
In North America, eggs and first instar larvae of the monarch are eaten by larvae and adults of the [[Introduced species|introduced]] Asian lady beetle (''[[Harmonia axyridis]]'').<ref>{{cite journal |last=Koch  |first=R. L. |coauthors=W. D. Hutchison, R. C. Venette and G. E.

[[Image:albino monarch butterfly.jpg|right|thumb|White [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] of the monarch in Hawaii]]
On [[Oahu]], a white [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] of the monarch has emerged. This is because of the [[Introduced species|introduction]], in 1965 and 1966, of two [[bulbul]] species, ''[[Pycnonotus cafer]]'' and ''Pycnonotus jacosus''. They are now the most common insectivore birds, and probably the only ones preying on insects as big as the monarch. Monarchs in [[Hawaii]] are known to have low cardiac glycoside levels, but the birds may also be [[Physiological tolerance|tolerant]] for the chemical. The two species hunt the larvae and some pupae from the branches and underside of leaves in milkweed bushes. The bulbuls also eat resting and ovipositing adults, but rarely flying ones. Because of its colour the white morph has a higher survival rate than the orange one. This is either because of [[apostatic selection]] (i.e. the birds have learnt the orange monarchs can be eaten) or because of [[camouflage]]; the white morph matches the white pubescence of milkweed, or the patches of light shining through foliage.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Stimson |first=John |coauthors=Mark Berman |year=1990 |title= Predator induced colour polymorphism in Danaus plexippus L.
