[[Image:Sadler, Battle of Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Waterloo]] marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].]]
On 1 May 1707, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://personal.pitnet.net/primarysources/act.html |title=The Treaty (or Act) of Union, 1707 |publisher= |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref> usually referred to thereafter as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], was created by the [[political union]] of the [[Kingdom of England]] (which included the once independent [[Principality of Wales]]) and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. This event was the result of the [[Treaty of Union]] that was agreed on 22 July 1706,<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/images/historical/1707union.cfm Articles of Union with Scotland 1707] www.parliament.uk </ref> and then ratified by the Parliaments of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] each passing an [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] in 1707. Almost a century later, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], which had been brought under English control between 1541 and [[Treaty of Limerick|1691]], joined the Kingdom of Great Britain with the passing of the [[Act of Union 1800]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.actofunion.ac.uk/actofunion.htm#act | title=The Act of Union |publisher=Act of Union Virtual Library |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref> Although England and Scotland had been separate countries prior to 1707, they had been in [[personal union]] since 1603, when [[James VI of Scotland|James VI King of Scots]] had inherited the throne of the Kingdom of England, becoming King James I of England, and left [[Edinburgh]] for [[London]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Chronology of Scottish History|publisher=Geddes & Grosset|isbn=1-85534-380-0|last=Ross|first=David|date=2002|quote='''1603:''' James VI becomes [[James I of England]] in the [[Union of the Crowns]], and leaves [[Edinburgh]] for [[London]]|page=56}}</ref> 

[[Image:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|left|The [[British Empire]] in 1897. By 1920 it had become the [[list of largest empires|largest empire in history]]]]
In its first century, the United Kingdom played an important role in developing [[Western world|Western]] ideas of the [[Parliamentary System]] as well as making significant contributions to literature, the arts and science.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Niall |authorlink=Niall Ferguson |year=2003 |title=Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order |publisher=Basic Books |id=ISBN 0-465-02328-2}}</ref> The UK-led [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed the country and fuelled the [[British Empire]]. During this time, like other [[Great Powers]], the UK was involved in colonial exploitation, including the [[Atlantic slave trade]], though the passing of the 1807 [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] made the UK the first country to prohibit trade in slaves.

After the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the UK became the principal naval power of the 19th century. The United Kingdom remained an eminent power into the mid-20th century, and its empire expanded to its maximum size by 1921, gaining the [[League of Nations]] mandate over former German and Ottoman colonies after [[World War I]].

Long simmering tensions in Ireland led to the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|partition]] of the island in 1920, followed by independence for the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. Six of the nine [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] of the province of [[Ulster]] remained within the UK. In 1927, the formal name of the UK changed to its current name, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, by way of the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]].<ref name="CAIN">{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm |title=The Anglo-Irish Treaty, 6 December 1921 |publisher=CAIN |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref>

[[Image:Supermarinespitfire.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Britain]]. The United Kingdom was the only [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Europe]]an country to remain free from occupation during [[World War II]].]]
After World War I, the world's first large-scale international broadcasting network, the [[BBC]], was created. Britain was one of the major Allied powers in [[World War II]], and wartime leader [[Winston Churchill]] and his peacetime successor [[Clement Atlee]] helped plan the post-war world as part of the "Big Three". World War II left the United Kingdom financially damaged. Loans taken out during and after World War II from both Canada and the United States were economically costly but, along with post-war [[Marshall Plan|Marshall aid]], the UK began the road to recovery.

The immediate post-war years saw the establishment of the British [[Welfare State]], including one of the world's first and most comprehensive public [[National Health Service|health services]], while the demands of a recovering economy brought people from all over the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] to create a [[Immigration to the United Kingdom (1922-present day)|multiethnic Britain]]. Although the new post-war limits of Britain's [[political]] role were confirmed by the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, the international spread of the [[English language]] meant the continuing impact of its literature and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|culture]], while at the same time from the 1960s its [[popular culture]] found influence abroad. Following a period of global economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the 1980s saw the inflow of substantial [[North Sea Oil|oil revenues]] and economic growth. The premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] marked a significant change of direction from the post-war political and economic consensus; a path that was continued by the [[New Labour]] government of [[Tony Blair]] in 1997.

The United Kingdom was one of the 12 founding members of the [[European Union]] at its launch in 1992 with the signing of the [[Treaty on European Union]].  Prior to that, it had been a member of the EU's forerunner, the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), from 1973. The attitude of the present [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government towards further integration with this organisation is mixed,<ref name=Times>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-1948441,00.html |title=Modest progress but always on back foot |publisher=Times Online |date=2005-12-21 |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> with the [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|Offical Opposition]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], favouring a return of some powers and competencies to the state.<ref name=Conservatives>{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=europe.news.campaigns.display.page&obj_id=73417 |title=European Constitution: bad for Britain, bad for Europe |publisher=Conservative Party |accessdate=2006-05-23}}</ref>

The end of the 20th century saw a major change to the governance of the UK with the creation of a [[devolution|devolved]] [[Scottish parliament]] and [[Welsh Assembly]] following popular approval in pre-legislative [[Referendums in the United Kingdom|referenda]]. This produced the prospect of a legislative path to [[Scottish Independence|independence for Scotland]] when the [[Scottish National Party]] won the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 election]] and formed a [[minority government]] in Scotland, with a mandate to hold a referendum by 2011 on whether it should negotiate for Scottish independence.

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Politics of the United Kingdom|Monarchy of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM Queen Elizabeth II]]]]

The United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as head of state; the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch of the UK]] also serves as head of state of [[Commonwealth realm|fifteen other Commonwealth countries]], putting the UK in a [[personal union]] with those other states. The [[British crown|Crown]] has sovereignty over the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]]. Collectively, these three territories are known as the [[Crown dependencies]], lands owned by the [[British monarch]] but not part of the United Kingdom. They are not part of the [[European Union]]. However, the Parliament of the United Kingdom has the authority to legislate for the dependencies, and the British government manages their foreign affairs and defence.

The UK has fourteen [[British overseas territory|overseas territories]] around the world, the last remaining territories of the [[British Empire]]. The overseas territories are not considered part of the UK, but in most cases the local populations have British citizenship and the right of abode in the UK. This has been the case since 2002.

The UK has a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary government]] based on strong traditions: the [[Westminster system]] has been emulated around the world — a legacy of the [[British Empire]].

[[Constitution of the United Kingdom|The UK's constitution]] governs the legal framework of the country and consists mostly of written sources, including [[statute]]s, judge made [[case law]], and international treaties. As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and [[law]] considered to be "constitutional law," the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] can perform "constitutional reform" simply by passing [[Acts of Parliament]] and thus has the [[political power|power]] to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution. However, no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/sovereignty.cfm|title=Official UK Parliament web page on parliamentary sovereignty}}</ref> The United Kingdom is one of the three countries in the world today that does not have a codified [[constitution]] (the other two being [[New Zealand]] and [[Israel]]).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.llrx.com/features/uk2.htm#UK%20Legal%20System |title=A Guide To the UK Legal System |author=Sarah Carter |publisher=[[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>

The position of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], the UK's [[head of government]], belongs to the Member of Parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], usually the current leader of the largest political party in that chamber. The Prime Minister and Cabinet are formally appointed by the Monarch to form [[Her Majesty's Government]]. Though the Prime Minister chooses the Cabinet, and by convention HM The Queen respects the Prime Minister's choices. The [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] is traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister's party in both legislative houses, and mostly from the House of Commons, to which [[Responsible government|they are responsible]]. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, all of whom are sworn into [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council]], and become [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]]. ''The Rt Hon'' [[Gordon Brown]] [[MP]], leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], has been Prime Minister, [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Minister for the Civil Service]] since 27 June 2007.<ref name="npm">{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6245682.stm | title= Brown is UK's new prime minister | date=2007-06-27 | accessdate= 2008-01-23 | work= BBC News | publisher= [[BBC News|news.bbc.co.uk]] }}</ref>

[[Image:Westminster palace.jpg|thumb|The [[Houses of Parliament]]]]
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that meets in the [[Palace of Westminster]] is the ultimate legislative authority in the United Kingdom. A devolved parliament in [[Scottish parliament|Scotland]] and devolved assemblies in [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]], and [[National Assembly for Wales|Wales]] were established following public approval as expressed in [[Referendum|referenda]], but these are not sovereign bodies and could be abolished by the UK parliament. The UK parliament is made up of two houses: an elected [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and an appointed [[House of Lords]], and any Bill passed requires the [[Royal assent|assent]] of HM The Queen to become law. For elections to the House of Commons, the UK is currently divided into [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in the United Kingdom|646 constituencies]], with 529 in England, 18 in Northern Ireland, [[Scottish Westminster constituencies from 2005|59 in Scotland]] and 40 in Wales, though this number will rise to 650 at the [[Next United Kingdom general election|next General Election]]. Each constituency elects one Member of Parliament by [[plurality electoral system|simple plurality]]. General Elections are called by the Monarch when the Prime Minister so advises. Though there is no minimum term for a Parliament, a new election must be called within five years of the previous general election.

For elections to the [[European Parliament]], the UK has 78 MEPs, elected in 12 [[multi-member]] constituencies. Questions over sovereignty have been brought forward due to the UK's membership of the [[European Union]].<ref name=Times20050914>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1779849,00.htm |title=Europe Wins The Power To Jail British Citizens |publisher=The Times |date=2005-09-14}}</ref>

The UK's three [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom#Major political parties in the United Kingdom|major political parties]] are the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and the [[Liberal Democrats]], winning between them 616 out of the 646 seats available in the House of Commons at the [[2005 General Election]]. Most of the remaining seats were won by parties that only contest elections in one part of the UK such as the [[Scottish National Party]] (Scotland only), [[Plaid Cymru]] (Wales only), and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], [[Ulster Unionist Party]], and [[Sinn Féin]] (Northern Ireland only, though Sinn Féin also contests elections in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]). In accordance with party policy, no elected Sinn Féin Member of Parliament has ever attended the House of Commons to speak in the House on behalf of their constituents as Members of Parliament are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Monarch. However, the current five [[Sinn Féin]] MPs have since 2002 made use of the offices and other facilities available at Westminster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1771635.stm|title=news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1771635.stm<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

[[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] each has a [[Devolution|devolved]], [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature and its own [[Executive (government)|government or Executive]], led by a [[First Minister]]. England, despite being the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no devolved executive or legislature and is ruled and legislated for directly by the UK government and parliament. This situation has given rise to the so-called [[West Lothian question]] which concerns the fact that MPs from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales help decide the laws that apply to England alone.

The [[Scottish Parliament]] has wide ranging legislative powers over any matter that has not been specifically '[[reserved matters|reserved]]' to the UK parliament, including [[education in Scotland|education]], [[NHS Scotland|healthcare]], [[Scots law]] and [[local government in Scotland|local government]]. Following their victory at the [[Scottish Parliament election 2007|2007 elections]], the [[Scottish independence|pro-independence]] [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] formed a minority [[Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament|government]] with its leader, [[Alex Salmond]], becoming [[First Minister of Scotland]]. The pro-union parties responded to the electoral success of the SNP by creating a [[Scottish Constitutional Commission|Commission]] to examine the case for devolving additional powers while excluding [[Scottish independence]] as an option,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7311840.stm |title=Devolution review body launched |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-03-25}}</ref> though the then leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Wendy Alexander, indicated that Labour would support calls for independence to be placed before the people in a referendum in the hope that a vote to reject independence would settle the constitutional debate for a generation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Wendy-39Bring-it-on39.4049804.jp |title=Wendy: 'Bring it on' |publisher=[[Scotsman]] |date=2008-05-05}}</ref> Most opinion polls do show minority support for independence though support varies depending on the nature of the question.  However, a poll in April 2008 that used the proposed referendum wording found support for independence had reached 41% with just 40% supporting retention of the Union.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.2192965.0.0.php |title=41% of Scots back the break-up of the union |publisher=Sunday Herald |date=2008-04-13}}</ref>

The powers devolved to the [[National Assembly for Wales]] are more limited than those devolved to Scotland,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/wales_99/the_welsh_assembly/309033.stm |title=Structure and powers of the Assembly |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-04-09}}</ref> although following the passing of the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]], the Assembly can now legislate in some areas through [[Legislative Competency Order]]s which can be granted on a case by case basis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/jul/16/wales.devolution |title=What powers does the Welsh Assembly have? |publisher=Guardian |date=2007-07-16}}</ref> The current [[Welsh Assembly Government]] was formed several weeks after the [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|2007 elections]], following a brief period of minority administration, when [[Plaid Cymru]] joined [[Labour]] in a coalition [[Government of the 3rd National Assembly for Wales|government]] under the continuing leadership of First Minister [[Rhodri Morgan]].

The [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] has powers closer to those already devolved to Scotland. The [[Northern Ireland Executive]] is currently led by First Minister [[Peter Robinson]] ([[Democratic Unionist Party]]) and deputy First Minister [[Martin McGuinness]] ([[Sinn Féin]]).<ref>http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/your-government/devolved-government.htm Northern Ireland Executive</ref>

[[Image:ManchesterTownHall OwlofDoom.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Manchester Town Hall]] houses the [[Manchester City Council]].]]
The [[history of local government in the United Kingdom]] is marked by little change in the arrangements that preceded the Union until the 19th century after which there has been a constant evolution of role and function.<ref name=barlow>Barlow, I., ''Metropolitan Government'', (1991)</ref> Change did not occur in the different countries of the United Kingdom in a uniform manner and the devolution of power over local government to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland means that future changes are unlikely to be uniform either.

The organisation of [[local government in England]] is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to the local arrangements. Legislation concerning local government in [[England]] is decided by the UK parliament and the [[Government of the United Kingdom]], because England does not have a devolved parliament. The upper-tier [[subdivisions of England]] are the nine [[Regions of England|Government office regions]] or European Union government office regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gos.gov.uk/national/|publisher=gos.gov.uk|date=|accessdate=2008-07-31|title=Welcome to the national site of the Government Office Network}}</ref> A [[Greater London Authority referendum, 1998|London referendum]] in 1998 on the question of having a directly elected assembly and directly elected mayor produced a large majority in favour and it was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assemblies]]. However, a rejection by a [[Northern England devolution referendums, 2004|referendum in 2004]] of a proposed assembly in the [[North East England|North East]] region stopped this idea in its tracks.<ref>"The Government is now expected to tear up its twelve-year-old plan to create eight or nine regional assemblies in England to mirror devolution in Scotland and Wales."{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article503255.ece|title=Prescott's dream in tatters as North East rejects assembly|accessdate=2008-02-15|work=The Times}}</ref> Below the region level, [[London]] consists of 32 [[London borough]]s and the rest of England has either [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|county council]]s and district councils or [[unitary authorities]].

[[Local government in Northern Ireland]] is organised into 26 districts. The district councils do not carry out the same range of functions as would be the case in the rest of the United Kingdom with powers limited to services like collecting waste, controlling dogs, and maintaining parks and cemeteries.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4449092.stm NI local government set for shake-up]BBC News, November 18, 2005 </ref> However, on 13 March 2008, the Executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils to replace the present system.<ref>[http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/news/news-doe/news-doe-130308-foster-announces-the.htm ''Foster announces the future shape of local government'', NI Executive]</ref>

[[Local government in Scotland]] is divided on a basis of [[subdivisions of Scotland|32 council areas]] with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee]] are separate council areas as also is [[Highland Council]] which includes a third of Scotland's area but just over 200,000 people.  The power invested in local authorities is administered by elected councillors, of which there are currently 1,222 who are each paid a part-time salary. Elections are conducted by [[Single Transferable Vote]] in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors. Each council elects a [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] or [[Convenor]] to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area.

[[Local government in Wales]] consists of 22 unitary authorities, including the cities of [[Cardiff]], [[Swansea]] and [[Newport]], which are separate unitary authorities in their own right.<ref>[http://new.wales.gov.uk/topics/localgovernment/localauthorities/?lang=en Local Authorities] new.wales.gov.uk, accessed July 31, 2008</ref>

The UK has a "[[Special Relationship]]" with the [[United States]]. Apart from the US and [[Europe]], Britain's close allies include [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and other [[Anglosphere|English speaking countries]].

The [[British Army|Army]], [[Naval Service|Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force|Air Force]] are collectively known as the British Armed Forces (or Her Majesty's Armed Forces) and officially the Armed Forces of the Crown. The [[commander-in-chief]] is the monarch, HM [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and they are managed by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].

The United Kingdom is one of the [[List of countries with nuclear weapons|five recognised countries]] possessing nuclear weapons, utilising the [[Vanguard class submarine]]-based [[Trident missile|Trident II]] ballistic missile system.

The British Armed Forces are charged with protecting the United Kingdom and its [[British overseas territories|overseas territories]], promoting the United Kingdom's global security interests, and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in [[NATO]], including the [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]], as well as the [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]] and other worldwide coalition operations.

The [[United Kingdom Special Forces]], provide troops trained for quick, mobile, military responses in [[counter-terrorism]], land, maritime and [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]], often where secrecy or covert tactics are required.

There are reserve forces supporting the regular military. These include the [[Territorial Army]], the [[Royal Naval Reserve]], [[Royal Marines Reserve]] and the [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]]. This puts total active and reserve duty military personnel at approximately 429,500, deployed in over eighty countries.

Despite the United Kingdom's military capabilities, recent pragmatic defence policy has a stated assumption that "the most demanding operations" would be undertaken as part of a coalition.<ref>Office for National Statistics ''UK 2005: The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', p. 89 </ref> Setting aside the [[Operation Palliser|intervention in Sierra Leone]], operations in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Operation Telic|Iraq]] may all be taken as precedent. Indeed the last war in which the British military fought alone was the [[Falklands War]] of 1982, in which they were victorious.

== Law and criminal justice ==
{{main|Law of the United Kingdom}}

The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system due to it being created by the political union of previously independent countries with Article 19 of the [[Treaty of Union]] guaranteeing the continued existence of Scotland's separate legal system.  Today the UK has three distinct [[systems of law]]: [[English law]], [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland law]] and [[Scots law]]. Recent constitutional changes will see a new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] come into being in October 2009 that will take on the appeal functions of the Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]].<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf Constitutional reform: A Supreme Court for the United Kingdom]|252&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 258317 bytes -->}}, Department for Constitutional Affairs. Retrieved on [[2006-05-22]]</ref> The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], comprising the same members as the Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]], is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the UK overseas territories, and the British crown dependencies.

=== England, Wales and Northern Ireland ===
{{main|English law|Northern Ireland law}}
Both [[English law]], which applies in [[England and Wales]], and [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland law]] are based on [[common law|common-law]] principles. The essence of common-law is that law is made by [[judges]] sitting in [[court]]s, applying their common sense and knowledge of [[legal precedent]] (''[[stare decisis]]'') to the facts before them. The [[Courts of England and Wales]] are headed by the Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] (for civil cases) and the [[Crown Court]] (for criminal cases). The Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] (usually just referred to, as "The House of Lords") is presently the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil cases in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]] and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the hierarchy.

Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995 though, since that peak, there has been an overall fall of 48% in crime from 1995 to 2007/8.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7511192.stm |title=Police-recorded crime down by 9% |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-17}}</ref> Despite the fall in crime rates, the [[prison population of England and Wales]] has almost doubled over the same period, to over 80,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7235438.stm New record high prison population] BBC News, February 8, 2008 </ref> [[Her Majesty's Prison Service]], which reports  to the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], manages most of the [[prison]]s within England and Wales.

=== Scotland ===
{{main|Scots law}}
[[Scots law]], a hybrid system based on both common-law and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] principles, applies in [[Scotland]].  The chief courts are the [[Court of Session]], for civil cases, and the [[High Court of Justiciary]], for criminal cases. The Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] (usually just referred to as "The House of Lords") presently serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law but only if the Court of Session grants leave to appeal or the initial judgement was by a majority decision. [[Sheriff court]]s deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal [[trial]]s with a jury, known as Sheriff solemn Court, or with a Sheriff and no jury, known as (Sheriff summary Court). The [[Sheriff court]]s provide a local court service with 49 Sheriff courts organised across six [[Sheriffdom]]s.

The Scots legal system is unique in having three possible [[verdict]]s for a criminal trial: "[[guilt (law)|guilt]]y", "[[not guilty]]" and "''[[not proven]]''". Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an [[acquittal]] with no possibility of [[retrial]]. The [[Scottish Prison Service]] (SPS) manages the prisons in Scotland which contain between them over 7,500 prisoners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sps.gov.uk/default.aspx?documentid=7811a7f1-6c61-4667-a12c-f102bbf5b808 |title=Prisoner Population at Friday 13 June 2008 |publisher=Scottish Prison Service |date=2008-06-26}}</ref> The [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice]] is responsible for the Scottish Prison Service within the Scottish Government.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of the United Kingdom|Climate of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:uk topo en.jpg|thumb|UK's topography]]
The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately {{convert|245000|km2|sqmi|-1}} comprising of the island of Great Britain, the northeastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland) and smaller islands.  It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, coming within {{convert|35|km|mi|0}} of the northwest coast of France, from which it is separated by the [[English Channel]]. Great Britain lies between latitudes 49° and 59° N (the Shetland Islands reach to nearly 61° N), and longitudes 8° W to 2° E. The Royal Greenwich Observatory, near London, is the defining point of the [[Prime Meridian]]. When measured directly north-south, Great Britain is a little over {{convert|1100|km|mi|-2}} in length and is a fraction under {{convert|500|km|mi|-2}} at its widest, but the greatest distance between two points is {{convert|1350|km|mi|-1}} between [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]] (near [[Penzance]]) and [[John O'Groats]] in [[Caithness]] (near [[Thurso]]). Northern Ireland shares a {{convert|360|km|mi|0|adj=on}} land boundary with [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. 

The United Kingdom has a temperate [[climate]], with plentiful rainfall all year round. The temperature varies with the seasons but seldom drops below {{convert|-10|C|lk=on}} or rises above {{convert|35|C}}. The prevailing wind is from the southwest, bearing frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean. Eastern parts are most sheltered from this wind and are therefore the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]], bring mild winters, especially in the west, where winters are wet, especially over high ground. Summers are warmest in the south east of England, being closest to the European mainland, and coolest in the north. Snowfall can occur in winter and early spring, though it rarely settles to great depth away from high ground.

[[Geography of England|England]] accounts for just over half of the total area of the UK, covering {{convert|130410|km2|sqmi|-1}}. Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, and mountainous terrain north-west of the [[Tees-Exe line]]. Mountain chains are found in the north-west ([[Cumbrian Mountains]] of the Lake District), north (the upland moors of the [[Pennines]] and [[limestone]] hills of the [[Peak District]]) and south-west ([[Exmoor]] and [[Dartmoor]]).  Lower ranges include the [[limestone]] hills of the [[Isle of Purbeck]], [[Cotswolds]] and [[Lincolnshire Wolds]], and the [[chalk]] downs of the [[Southern England Chalk Formation]]. The main rivers and estuaries are the [[Thames]], [[Severn]] and the [[Humber|Humber Estuary]]. England's highest mountain is [[Scafell Pike]], which is in the [[Lake District]] {{convert|978|m|ft|0}}. England has a number of large towns and cities and, in terms of [[Larger Urban Zones in the European Union|Larger Urban Zones]], has six of the top 50 Zones in the European Union.

[[Image:BenNevis2005.jpg|thumb|[[Ben Nevis]], in the [[Grampian Mountains (Scotland)|Grampian Mountains]], is the highest point in the [[British Isles]]]]
[[Geography of Scotland|Scotland]] accounts for about a third of the total area of the UK, covering {{convert|78772|km2|sqmi|-1}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.org/about/fact-file/index.html |title=Scotland Facts |publisher=www.scotland.org |accessedate=2008-07-16}}</ref> The topography of Scotland is distinguished by the [[Highland Boundary Fault]]{{ndash}} a [[geologic fault|geological rock fracture]]{{ndash}} which traverses the Scottish mainland from [[Helensburgh]] to [[Stonehaven]]. The faultline separates two distinctively different regions; namely the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] to the north and west and the [[Scottish lowlands|lowlands]] to the south and east. The more rugged Highland region contains the majority of Scotland's mountainous terrain, including the highest peak, [[Ben Nevis]], at {{convert|1344|m|ft|0}}. Lowland areas, in the southern part of Scotland, are flatter and home to most of the population, especially the narrow waist of land between the [[Firth of Clyde]] and the [[Firth of Forth]] known as the [[Central Lowlands|Central Belt]]. [[Glasgow]] is the largest city in Scotland, although [[Edinburgh]] is the [[Capital city|capital]] and political centre of the country. Scotland also has nearly eight hundred [[List of islands of Scotland|islands]], mainly west and north of the mainland, notably the [[Hebrides]], [[Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland Islands]].

[[Geography of Wales|Wales]] accounts for less than a tenth of the total area of the UK, covering just {{convert|20758|km2|sqmi|-1}}. Wales is mostly mountainous though [[South Wales]] is less mountainous than North and Mid Wales. The main population and industrial areas are in [[South Wales]], consisting of the cities of [[Cardiff]], [[Swansea]] and [[Newport]] and surrounding [[South Wales Valleys]].  The highest mountains in Wales are in [[Snowdonia]], and include [[Snowdon]] (''Yr Wyddfa'' in Welsh), which, at 1,085&nbsp;m (3,560&nbsp;ft) is the highest peak in Wales. The 14 (or possibly 15) Welsh mountains over 3,000 feet (914&nbsp;m) high are known collectively as the [[Welsh 3000s]]. Wales borders England to the east and the sea in the other three directions: the [[Bristol Channel]] to the south, [[St George's Channel]] to the west, and the [[Irish Sea]] to the north. Wales has over 1,200&nbsp;km (750&nbsp;miles) of coastline. There are several [[island]]s off the Welsh mainland, the largest being [[Anglesey]] (''Ynys Môn'') in the northwest.

[[Geography of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] accounts for just {{convert|14160|km2|sqmi|-1}} and is mostly hilly. It includes [[Lough Neagh]], at {{convert|388|km2|sqmi|0}}, the largest body of water in the UK and [[Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/geog.htm |title=Geography of Northern Ireland |publisher=University of Ulster |accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref> The highest peak is [[Slieve Donard]] at {{convert|849|m|ft|0}} in the province's [[Mourne Mountains]].

=== Cities and conurbations ===
{{main|List of largest United Kingdom settlements by population|List of conurbations in the United Kingdom}}
The capitals of the individual countries of the UK are: [[Belfast]] (Northern Ireland), [[Cardiff]] (Wales), [[Edinburgh]] (Scotland) and  [[London]] (England), which is also the capital of the UK as a whole.

In 2006, the average [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) across the UK was 1.84 children per woman,<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?ID=951 UK fertility highest since 1980]National Statistics Online, accessed April 26, 2008</ref> below the replacement rate of 2.1 but higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63. Within the UK, England and Wales, at 1.86, were both close to the UK average, but Scotland was lower at only 1.67. The UK's TFR was considerably higher during the 1960s 'baby boom', peaking at 2.95 children per woman in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=369|title=www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=369<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

The present day population of the UK is descended from varied ethnic stocks though mainly: [[Cruithne (people)|pre-Celtic]], [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Roman citizenship|Roman]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]], and the [[Normans]]. Since 1945, international ties forged by the [[British Empire]] have contributed to substantial immigration, especially from [[Africa]], [[Caribbean]] and [[South Asia]]. Since [[EU]] citizens are free to live and work in other EU member states, the accession of new to the EU of new member states from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] in 2004 has resulted in rising immigration from these countries. As of 2008, the trend is reversing and many [[Poles]] are returning to [[Poland]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7374683.stm 'Why I left UK to return to Poland'], BBC News</ref> As of [[2001 British Census|2001]], 92.1% of the population identified themselves as White, leaving 7.9%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/nugget.asp?ID=764&Pos=4&ColRank=1&Rank=176 |title=Ethnicity: 7.9% from a non-White ethnic group |publisher=Office for National Statistics |date=2004-06-24 |accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref>

=== Languages ===
{{main|Languages of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Anglospeak.svg|thumb|Countries where [[English language|English]] has ''de facto'' or ''de jure'' official language status.]]

Though the UK does not ''[[de jure]]'' have an official language, the predominant [[spoken language]] is [[English language|English]], a [[West Germanic]] language descended from [[Old English]] featuring a large number of borrowings from [[Old Norse]], [[Norman language|Norman]] [[French language|French]] and [[Latin language|Latin]]. The English language has spread across the world (largely due to the British Empire) and has thus become [[International English|the business language of the world]]. Worldwide, it is [[English language learning and teaching|taught as a second language]] more than any other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cepr.org/pubs/new-dps/dplist.asp?dpno=2055 |title=English-Language Dominance, Literature and Welfare |author=Jacques Melitz |publisher=Centre for Economic Policy Research |date=1999 |accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref>

The other indigenous languages of the UK are [[Scots language|Scots]] (which is closely related to English) and four [[Celtic languages]]. The latter fall into two groups: two P-Celtic languages ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]]); and two Q-Celtic languages ([[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]). Celtic dialectal influences from [[Cumbric]] persisted in Northern England for centuries, most famously in a unique set of numbers used for counting sheep (see [[Yan Tan Tethera]]). In the 2001 Census over a fifth (21%) of the population of Wales said they could speak Welsh, <ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/nugget.asp?ID=447&Pos=6&ColRank=1&Rank=192]</ref> an increase from the 1991 Census (18%). <ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/fow/WelshLanguage.pdf]</ref> In addition, it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/multilingual/welsh.shtml Welsh today by Prof. Peter Wynn Thomas]bbc.co.uk</ref> Welsh and Scottish Gaelic are also spoken by small groups around the globe with some [[Scottish Gaelic in Canada|Gaelic]] still spoken in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], and Welsh in [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]].

Speakers of immigrant languages constitute up to 10% of the UK's population, [[French language|French]] is spoken by 2.3% of the country's population, 1.0% of Britons speak [[Polish language|Polish]] reflecting the recent mass migration to the UK. 0.9% of the UK's population speak [[German language|German]] and 0.8% [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The majority of other foreign languages spoken in the UK originate from [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. A large percentage of the immigrants to the UK come from [[Anglophone]] countries (such as [[Nigeria]], [[Jamaica]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[Philippines]]), which is why there is not a great deal of diversity between some of the country's ethnic minority communities.

Across the United Kingdom, it is generally compulsory for pupils to study a foreign language to some extent: up to the age of 14 in England, up to age 16 in Scotland. [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] are the two most commonly taught second languages in England and Scotland, though Welsh is the main second language taught in Wales. According to a survey in 2003, 89% of British people have a basic level of French language, and a further 23% have a basic knowledge of [[German language|German]]. Other languages becoming more popular include 7% [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and 0.5% [[Russian language|Russian]].

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom and the countries that preceded it have long traditions of [[Christianity]] and a link between [[Separation of church and state|church and state]] still remains in England. Research suggests that 38% of the population have a belief in a [[God]] with a further 40% believing in a 'spirit or life force'.<ref name=Eurobarometer>{{PDFlink|[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf Eurobarometer poll conducted in 2005]|1.64&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1722129 bytes -->}}. Page 9. European Commission. Retrieved on 7 December 2006</ref> People identify themselves with [[religion]] in the UK for both cultural and religious reasons and this is reflected by the disparity between the figures for those proclaiming a belief in a [[God]] and those identifying themselves with a particular religion. Christianity has the largest number of adherents followed by Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and Judaism.

The [[Church of England]], which split from [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]] in 1534 (see [[English Reformation]]) is, today, the '[[Established church|established]]' Church in England and the senior branch of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]]. The [[British monarch]] is required to be a member of the Church of England under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and is its [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]]. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is the senior bishop of the Church. The direct influence of the [[Church of England]] has been on the decline for years, but the church retains a [[Lords Spiritual|representation]] in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] and the right to draft legislative measures (usually related to religious administration), through the [[General Synod]], that can be passed into law, but not amended by Parliament.

The [[Church of Scotland]] (known informally as the [[Kirk]]), which broke with Rome in 1560 (see [[Calvinism]] and [[Scottish Reformation]]) is a [[Presbyterian]] church, recognised as the [[national church]] of Scotland, and not subject to state control. The British monarch is an ordinary member, and is required to swear an oath to "defend the security" of the Church at the coronation. The [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], which is now part of the Anglican Communion, dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690, when it split from the Church of Scotland, and is not a 'daughter church' of the Church of England. Further splits in the Church of Scotland, especially in the nineteenth century, led to the creation of various other Presbyterian churches in Scotland, including the [[Free Church of Scotland]].

In the 1920s, the [[Church in Wales]] was separated from the Church of England and became '[[Disestablishment|disestablished]]'. The Church in Wales remains in the [[Anglican Communion]]. [[Methodism]] and other independent churches are traditionally strong in Wales.

The Anglican [[Church of Ireland]] was disestablished in the nineteenth century. It covers the entire island of [[Ireland]] (both [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]). In Northern Ireland the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Catholic Church in Ireland]] is the largest single denomination, although [[Protestant]]s are in the majority overall. The [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]] is the largest Protestant denomination and is in terms of theology and history closely linked to the Church of Scotland

The [[Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain|Roman Catholic Church]] is the second largest denomination of Christianity in the UK. After the [[Protestant Reformation]], strict laws were passed against Catholics; these were removed by the [[Catholic Emancipation]] laws in 1829. There are separate Catholic hierarchies for [[Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland|Ireland]].

Other large Christian groups include the [[Methodists]] (founded by [[John Wesley]] in London) and the [[Baptists]]. There are also growing [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches, many of which have flourished with [[Immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration]] from around the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and beyond. Pentecostal churches are now third after the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in terms of church attendance.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article757934.ece 'Fringe' Church winning the believers] Timesonline, December 19, 2006</ref>

[[Indian religions|Religions of Indian origin]], such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] are followed in Britain. As of the 2001 census, there are about 560,000 Hindus and 340,000 Sikhs.

[[Image:London.bankofengland.arp.jpg|thumb|The [[Bank of England]]; the [[central bank]] of the United Kingdom.]]
The UK economy is made up (in descending order of size) of the economies of [[Economy of England|England]], [[Economy of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Economy of Wales|Wales]] and [[Economy of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. The British started the [[Industrial Revolution]], and, like most industrialising countries at the time, initially concentrated on heavy industries such as [[shipbuilding]], [[coal mining]], [[steel]] production, and [[textiles]]. The empire created an overseas market for British products, allowing the United Kingdom to dominate international trade in the 19th century. However, as other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. The British service sector, however, has grown substantially, and now makes up about 73% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web |date=2006-04-26 |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=9333 |title=Index of Services (experimental) |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref>

The service sector of the United Kingdom is dominated by [[financial services]], especially in banking and insurance. London is the world's largest financial centre with the [[London Stock Exchange]], the [[London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange]], and the [[Lloyd's of London]] insurance market all based in the [[City of London]]. It has the largest concentration of foreign bank branches in the world. In the past decade, a rival financial centre in London has grown in the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area, with [[HSBC]] and [[Barclays plc|Barclays Bank]] relocating their head offices there. Many multinational companies that are not primarily UK-based have chosen to site their European or rest-of-world headquarters in London: an example is the US financial services firm [[Citigroup]]. The Scottish capital, [[Edinburgh]], has one of the large financial centres of [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marklazarowicz.org.uk/parliament/speeches2003/4.30(WH).htm |title=Debate on Scottish financial services industry |first=Mark |last=Lazarowicz (Labour MP) |date=2003-04-30 |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>

[[Image:Oil platform.jpg|thumb|right|[[North Sea oil|North Sea oil and gas]] supply most of the UK's energy needs.]]

The UK has a small [[coal]] reserve along with significant [[natural gas]], and [[oil reserves]].

Government involvement throughout the economy is exercised by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (currently [[Alistair Darling]]) who heads [[HM Treasury]], but the [[Prime Minister]] (currently ''The Rt Hon'' [[Gordon Brown]] MP), is [[First Lord of the Treasury]]; the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the Second Lord of the Treasury. However since 1997, the [[Bank of England]], headed by the [[Governor of the Bank of England]], has control of interest rates and other monetary policy.

The currency of the UK is the [[pound sterling]], represented by the symbol '''[[Pound sign|£]]'''. The [[Bank of England]] is the [[central bank]], responsible for issuing currency. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover the issue. The UK chose not to join the [[euro]] at the currency's launch, and the British Prime Minister, ''The Rt Hon'' Gordon Brown MP, has ruled out membership for the foreseeable future, saying that the decision not to join had been right for Britain and for Europe.<ref>{{cite web |date=2007-07-24 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2127640.ece |title=Puritanism comes too naturally for 'Huck' Brown |publisher=Times Online |accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref> The government of former Prime Minister Tony Blair had pledged to hold a public referendum for deciding membership should "[[five economic tests]]" be met.

Each country of the United Kingdom has a separate education system, with power over education matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland being devolved. 

[[Education in Scotland]] is the responsibility of the [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning]], with day to day administration and funding of state schools being the responsibility of Local Authorities.  Qualifications at the secondary school and [[post-secondary education|post-secondary]] ([[further education]]) level are provided by the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] and delivered through various schools, colleges and other centres. Scotland first legislated for universal provision of education in 1696. The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4% though it has been rising slowly in recent years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6563167.stm |title=Increase in private school intake |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-17}}</ref> Scottish students who attend Scottish universities pay neither tuition fees nor graduate endowment charges as the fees were abolished in 2001 and the graduate endowment scheme was abolished in 2008.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7268101.stm MSPs vote to scrap endowment fee] BBC News, February 28, 2008</ref>

The [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] is responsible for [[education in Northern Ireland]] though responsibility at a local level is administered by 5 Education and Library Boards covering different geographical areas.

The [[National Assembly for Wales]] has responsibility for [[education in Wales]]. A significant number of students in Wales are educated either wholly or largely through the medium of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and lessons in the language are compulsory for all until the age of 16. There are plans to increase the provision of Welsh Medium schools as part of the policy of having a fully bi-lingual Wales.

[[Image:NorfolkAndNorwichUniversityHospital(KatyAppleton)Aug2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]] - a modern [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] hospital.]]
Each country of the United Kingdom has a separate public healthcare system, with power over the provision of health services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland being devolved. Though each provides healthcare that is generally free to patients, being funded from general taxation, considerable differences are now developing between the different systems.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems] [[BBC]] January 2, 2008</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7457357.stm  A four-way split on the NHS] BBC News, July 4, 2008</ref>  A much smaller private medical system also exists. The UK and devolved governments take on both the role of suppliers of public healthcare and assessors of the quality of its delivery.   Various regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the [[General Medical Council]], the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] and non-governmental-based (e.g. [[Royal College]]s). Across the UK, there is a large number of [[medical school]]s and [[dental school]]s, and a considerable establishment for training [[nurse]]s and professions allied to medicine.

Though the public health systems are commonly referred to as the NHS across the UK, in fact the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] just covers England. The NHS was set up by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] and came into effect on July 5, 1948. The [[Secretary of State for Health]] is answerable to the UK Parliament for the running of the [[Department of Health]] and for the work of the NHS (in England). The NHS is one of the largest cohesive organisations of any type in the world employing over 1.3 million people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6450303.stm |title=NHS workforce 'falls by 11,000' |publisher=BBC News, |date=2007-03-14}}</ref> Public sector healthcare delivery consists of primary ([[General Practice]]), secondary ([[district general hospital]]) and tertiary ([[teaching hospital]]) levels of service.  There is considerable interaction and cross-flow between the various levels. The [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]], or NICE, advises on whether drugs or treatments should be provided by the NHS.

[[Healthcare in Scotland]] is mainly provided by [[NHS Scotland]], Scotland's public healthcare system. The service was founded by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947 (later repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) that took effect on July 5, 1948 to coincide with the launch of the NHS in England and Wales. However, even  prior to 1948, half of Scotland's landmass was already covered by state funded healthcare, provided by the [[Highlands and Islands Medical Service]].<ref>[http://www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk/history/birth-of-nhs-scotland/highlands-and-islands-medical-service.html Highlands and Islands Medical Service (HIMS)] www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk, accessed July 28, 2008</ref> In 2006, NHS Scotland employed around 158,000 staff including more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. In addition, there were also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS in return for fees and allowances.<ref>[http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/introduction.aspx About the NHS in Scotland] NHS Scotland</ref> The [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing]] is responsible to the Scottish Parliament for the work of NHS Scotland.

[[Healthcare in Wales]] is mainly provided by [[NHS Wales]]. It was originally formed as part of the same NHS structure created by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] but powers over the NHS in Wales came under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969.<ref>[http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?pid=11595&orgid=452 Introduction to NHS Wales 1960's] www.wales.nhs.uk </ref> In turn, responsibility for NHS Wales was passed to the Welsh Assembly and Executive under devolution in 1999.

The Scottish [[transport]] network is the responsibility of the [[Scottish Government's Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department]] with [[Transport Scotland]] being the [[Executive agencies of the Scottish Government|Executive Agency]] that is accountable to the [[Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth]] for Scotland's trunk roads and rail networks.<ref>[http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/ Transport Scotland - Keeping Scotland moving] www.transportscotland.gov.uk, accessed July 1, 2008 </ref> Scotland's rail network has around 340 railway stations and 3,000 kilometres of track with over 62 million passenger journeys made each year.<ref>[http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/rail Transport Scotland - Rail] www.transportscotland.gov.uk, accessed July 10, 2008</ref>

Across the UK, there is a radial road network of {{convert|46904|km|mi|0}} of main roads with a motorway network of {{convert|3497|km|mi|0}}. There are a further {{convert|213750|km|mi|0}} of paved roads. The [[Network Rail|rail network]] of 16,116 km (10,072 miles) in Great Britain and 303&nbsp;route&nbsp;km (189 route&nbsp;mi) in [[Northern Ireland]] carries over 18,000 passenger trains and 1,000 freight trains daily. Urban rail networks are well developed in London and other cities. There was once over 48,000 route&nbsp;km (30,000 route&nbsp;mi) of rail network in the UK, however most of this was reduced over a time period from 1955 to 1975, much of it after a report by a government advisor [[Richard Beeching]] in the mid 1960s (known as the [[Beeching Axe]]). Plans are now being considered to built new high speed lines by 2025.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7467203.stm  Major new rail lines considered] BBC News, June 21, 2008 </ref>

Like many team sports, football is organised on a separate basis for each of the countries of the United Kingdom and each has its own Football Association, national team and [[league system]], though a few clubs play outside their country's respective systems for a variety of historical and logistical reasons.  [[Association football|Football]] was developed in the UK and is comfortably the most popular sport.

[[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] compete as separate countries in international competition and, as a consequence, the UK does not compete as a single team in football events at the [[Olympic Games]].

More clubs from England have won the European Cup than any other country (four compared to three from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands). Moreover, England ranks second in the all time list of European club trophies won with 35, one behind Italy's 36. The European Cup competition itself was brought about due to the success of another English club, [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], against top European sides<ref>http://galeb.etf.bg.ac.yu/~mirad/archive.html EuroCups Archive</ref> in the 1950s.  The 90,000 capacity [[Wembley Stadium]] is the principal sporting stadium of England.

The [[Scottish football league system]] is much smaller, with just two national leagues: the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL) and the [[Scottish Football League]] which has three divisions. There are, however, other regional leagues that are not connected to the national system, most notably the [[Highland Football League]]. One English club, [[Berwick Rangers F.C.|Berwick Rangers]], plays in the Scottish system. Scotland is home to world-renowned football clubs such as [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. Scottish teams that have been successful in European Competitions include [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] (European Cup in 1967), [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (European Cup Winners Cup 1972) and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] (European Cup Winners Cup and [[European Super Cup]] in 1983).

=== Other sports ===
[[Image:Wimbledon Grojean 2004 RJL.JPG|thumb|The [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] Championships, a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament, is held in [[Wimbledon, London]] every June/July.]]
[[Image:Royal & Ancient Clubhouse.jpg|thumb|[[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]], generally regarded as the world's "Home of Golf".]]
Both forms of rugby are national sports. [[Rugby league]] originates from and is generally played in the [[Northern England]], while [[rugby union]] is played throughout the UK. Though supposedly originating from the actions of [[William Webb Ellis]] at the School at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], it is now considered the national sport of Wales. In [[rugby league]] the UK has been represented by a single 'Great Britain' team but this will change for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup in which Scotland, England and Ireland will compete as separate nations.<ref>[http://www.rlwc08.com/ Official Website of Rugby League World Cup 2008]</ref>  This bring it into line with rugby union in which England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland (which consists of players from [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and Northern Ireland) already compete in international competition. However, every four years a [[British and Irish Lions]] team tours Australia, New Zealand or South Africa, composed of players selected from all the Home nations.

There is no UK-wide [[cricket]] team. The game was invented in [[England]] and the England Cricket Team, technically the England and Wales team, is the only national team in the UK with Test status. [[Sport in Ireland|Irish]] and [[Cricket in Scotland|Scottish]] players have played for [[England]] because neither Scotland nor Ireland have Test status and only play in One Day Internationals. As of 2006, teams representing [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]], [[England national cricket team|England (and Wales)]], and [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]] (including Northern Ireland) compete at the One-Day International level. England and Wales has a professional [[County Championship|league championship]] in which County teams compete.

[[Snooker]] is also one of Great Britain's sporting exports. A high-skill game similar to [[billiards]], the world championships are held annually in [[Sheffield]]. The sport continues to expand worldwide, with huge growth in China.

The game of [[tennis]] first originated from the City of [[Birmingham]] between 1859 and 1865. The [[Wimbledon Championships]] are international [[tennis]] events held in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] in south London every summer and are regarded as the most prestigious event of the global tennis calendar.

[[Thoroughbred racing]] is popular throughout the UK. It originated under [[Charles II of England]] as the "Sport of Kings" and is a royal pastime to this day. World-famous horse races include the [[Grand National]], the [[Epsom Derby]] and [[Royal Ascot]]. The town of [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] is considered the centre of English racing, largely due to the famous [[Newmarket Racecourse]].

The UK has proved successful in the international sporting arena in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. It is widely considered that the sport's most successful rower is [[Steven Redgrave]] who won five gold medals and one bronze medal at five consecutive [[Olympic Games]] as well as numerous wins at the [[World Rowing Championships]] and [[Henley Royal Regatta]].

Golf is one of the most popular participation sports played in the UK, with [[St Andrews]] in Scotland being the sport's home course.

[[Shinty|Shinty (or ''camanachd'')]] (A sport derived from the same root as the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[hurling]] and similar to [[bandy]]) is popular in the [[Scottish Highlands]], sometimes attracting crowds numbering thousands in the most sparsely populated region of the UK.

The UK is closely associated with [[motorsport]]. Many teams and drivers in [[Formula One]] (F1) are based in the UK and drivers from Britain have won more world titles than any other country. The country hosts legs of the F1 and [[World Rally Championship]] and has its own [[Touring Car Racing]] championship, the [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC).
The [[British Grand Prix]] takes place at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] each July.

[[Dancesport]] or competitive Ballroom dancing has its origins in the UK when popular dancing at the time was codified by British dance schools from the 1920s onwards. For example, the Slow Waltz is still known as the English Waltz which is now as distinct from its original roots as its name, the Viennese Waltz. The UK remains a major centre for the sport and Ballroom dancing in general with the Empress Ballroom at the [[Winter Gardens]] in [[Blackpool]] being a popular venue for major competitions.

== Culture ==
{{verify|section|date=July 2008}}
{{main|Culture of the United Kingdom}}
The [[culture of the United Kingdom]]&mdash;British culture&mdash; is informed by the [[History of the United Kingdom|UK's history]] as a [[Developed country|developed]] [[island country]], [[monarchy]], [[Imperialism|imperial power]] and, particularly, as a [[political union]] of four countries, which each have their own preserved and distinctive heritage, customs and symbolism. As a result of the [[British Empire]], British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies such as [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[India]], and the [[United States]].

=== Cinema ===
{{main|Cinema of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom has been influential in the development of cinema, with the [[Ealing Studios]] claiming to be the oldest studios in the world. Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry is characterised by an ongoing debate about its identity, and the influences of American and European cinema. Particularly between British and American film, many films are often co-produced or share actors with many British actors now featuring regularly in Hollywood films. The [[BFI Top 100 British films]] is a poll conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] which ranks what they consider to be the 100 greatest British films of all time.

=== Literature ===
{{main|British literature}}
[[Image:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Chandos portrait]], believed to depict [[William Shakespeare]].]]
[[Image:Robert burns.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Burns]]]]

'British literature' refers to [[literature]] associated with the United Kingdom, the [[Isle of Man]] and the Channel Islands as well as to literature from England, Wales and Scotland prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. 

The English playwright and poet [[William Shakespeare]] is widely regarded as the greatest dramatist of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109536 |title=Encyclopedia Britannica article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562101/Shakespeare.html |title=MSN Encarta Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://columbia.thefreedictionary.com/Shakespeare,+William |title=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref> Among the earliest English writers are [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] (12th century), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (14th century), and [[Thomas Malory]] (15th century). In the 18th century, [[Samuel Richardson]] is often credited with inventing the modern novel. In the 19th century, there followed further innovation by [[Jane Austen]], the [[Brontë|Brontë sisters]], the social campaigner [[Charles Dickens]], the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] [[Thomas Hardy]], the visionary poet [[William Blake]] and romantic poet [[William Wordsworth]]. Twentieth century writers include the science fiction novelist [[H. G. Wells]], the controversial [[D. H. Lawrence]], the [[Modernists|modernist]] [[Virginia Woolf]], the prophetic novelist [[George Orwell]] and the poet [[John Betjeman]]. Most recently, the children's fantasy [[Harry Potter]] series by [[J. K. Rowling]] has recalled the popularity of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

Scotland's contribution includes the detective writer [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], romantic literature by [[Sir Walter Scott]], the epic adventures of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and the celebrated poet [[Robert Burns]]. More recently, the modernist and nationalist [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] and [[Neil M. Gunn]] contributed to the [[Scottish Renaissance]]. A more grim outlook is found in [[Ian Rankin]]'s stories and the psychological horror-comedy of [[Iain Banks]]. Scotland's capital, [[Edinburgh]], is UNESCO's first worldwide city of literature.

In the early medieval period, Welsh writers composed the [[Mabinogion]]. In modern times, the poets [[R.S. Thomas]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] have brought Welsh culture to an international audience.

Authors from other nationalities, particularly from Ireland, or from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, have lived and worked in the UK. Significant examples through the centuries include [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]], and more recently British authors born abroad such as [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] and Sir [[Salman Rushdie]].

In theatre, Shakespeare's contemporaries [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]] added depth. More recently [[Alan Ayckbourn]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Michael Frayn]], [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] have combined elements of surrealism, realism and radicalism.

=== Media ===
{{main|Media in the United Kingdom}}
The prominence of the English language gives the UK media a widespread international dimension.

==== Broadcasting ====
{{main|Television in the United Kingdom}}

[[Image:BBC Television Centre.JPG|thumb|[[BBC Television Centre]]. The BBC is the largest and oldest broadcaster in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC website: ''About the BBC - What is the BBC'' |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/purpose/what.shtml |accessdate=2008-06-14}}</ref> ]]
[[Image:Channel 4 Building - Horseferry Road - London - 310504.jpg|thumb|The Channel 4 building.]]
There are five major nationwide television channels in the UK: [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Five (channel)|Five]] - currently transmitted by analogue terrestrial, free-to-air signals with the latter three channels funded by commercial advertising. In Wales, [[S4C]] the Welsh Fourth Channel replaces Channel 4, carrying Welsh language programmes at peak times. It also transmits Channel 4 programmes at other times.

The [[BBC]] is the UK's publicly funded [[radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world. It operates several [[BBC Television|television channels]] and [[BBC Radio|radio]] stations in both the UK and abroad. The BBC's international television news service, [[BBC World]], is broadcast throughout the world and the [[BBC World Service]] radio network is broadcast in thirty-three languages globally, as well as services in Welsh on [[BBC Radio Cymru]] and programmes in Scottish Gaelic in Scotland and Irish in Northern Ireland.

The domestic services of the BBC are funded by the [[television licence]], a legal requirement for any British household with a television receiver that is in use to receive broadcasts, regardless of whether or not the householders watch BBC channels. Households which are the principal residence of any person over 75 are exempt<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/information/agedover74s.jsp|title=TV licensing: aged over 74}}</ref> and the requirement does not extend to radio listeners. The BBC World Service Radio is funded by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] and the television stations are operated by [[BBC Worldwide]] on a commercial subscription basis over cable and satellite services. It is this commercial arm of the BBC that forms half of [[UKTV]] along with [[Virgin Media]].

The UK now has a large number of digital terrestrial channels including a further six from the BBC, five from ITV and three from Channel 4, and one from S4C which is solely in Welsh, among a variety of others.

The vast majority of digital [[cable television]] services are provided by [[Virgin Media]] with [[satellite television]] available from [[Freesat]] or [[BSkyB]] and [[free-to-air]] digital terrestrial television by [[Freeview (United Kingdom)|Freeview]]. The entire country [[Digital switchover in the United Kingdom|will switch to digital]] by 2012.

[[Radio in the United Kingdom|Radio in the UK]] is dominated by [[BBC Radio]], which operates ten national networks and over forty local radio stations. The most popular radio station, by number of listeners, is [[BBC Radio 2]], closely followed by [[BBC Radio 1]]. There are hundreds of mainly local commercial radio stations across the country offering a variety of music or talk formats.

Traditionally, [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British newspapers]] could be split into ''quality'', serious-minded newspaper (usually referred to as "[[broadsheets]]" due to their large size) and the more populist, ''[[tabloid]]'' varieties. For convenience of reading, many traditional broadsheets have switched to a more [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]]-sized format, traditionally used by [[tabloid]]s. [[The Sun (newspaper)|''The Sun'']] has the highest circulation of any daily newspaper in the UK, with approximately a quarter of the market; its sister paper, ''[[The News of The World]]'' similarly leads the Sunday newspaper market,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,1782,00.html |title=ABC Newspaper Circulation Figures |publisher=The Times |date=2006-05-12 |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> and traditionally focuses on celebrity-led stories. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', a [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] broadsheet paper, has overtaken ''[[The Times]]'' (tabloid size format) as the highest-selling of the "quality" newspapers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.org.uk/

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' is the main business paper, printed on distinctive salmon-pink broadsheet paper.

First printed in 1737, the ''[[The News Letter|Belfast News Letter]]'' is the oldest known English-language daily newspaper still in publication today. One of its fellow Northern Irish competitors, ''[[The Irish News]]'', has been twice ranked as the best regional newspaper in the United Kingdom, in 2006 and 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newspaperawards.co.uk/default.htm |title=The Newspaper Awards |accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>
Aside from newspapers, British magazines and journals have achieved worldwide circulation including ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.

Scotland has a distinct tradition of newspaper readership (see [[List of newspapers in Scotland]]). The tabloid [[Daily Record]] has the highest circulation of any daily newspaper outselling the Scottish Sun by 4-1 while its sister paper, the [[Sunday Mail]] similarly leads the Sunday newspaper market. The leading "quality" daily newspaper in Scotland is [[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]], though it is the [[Scotsman]]'s sister paper, the [[Scotland on Sunday]] that leads in the Sunday newspaper market.<ref>[http://www.business7.co.uk/business-news/breaking-business-news/2008/02/11/scottish-newspaper-readership-falls-97298-20316075/ Scottish newspaper readership falls] Business7, February 11, 2008</ref>

In the 1990s, [[Britpop]] bands and [[electronica]] music attained international success. More recent pop acts, including [[The Smiths]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Coldplay]], and the [[Spice Girls]], have ensured the continuation of the UK's massive contribution to popular music.

=== Philosophy ===

The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of "British Empiricism", a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid. The most famous philosophers of this tradition are [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]]. Britain is notable for a theory of moral philosophy, Utilitarianism, first used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and later by [[John Stuart Mill]], in his short work ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]''.

* The structure of [[DNA]], by [[Francis Crick]] and others
* The development of the [[World Wide Web#Origins|World Wide Web]], largely attributed to [[Tim Berners-Lee]]

Notable [[civil engineering]] projects, whose pioneers included [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], contributed to the world's first national railway transport system. Other advances pioneered in the UK include the [[marine chronometer]], [[television]], the [[jet engine]], the modern [[bicycle]], [[electric lighting]], the [[electric motor]], the [[screw propeller]], the [[internal combustion engine]], military [[radar]], the electronic [[computer]], [[vaccination]] and [[antibiotics]].

[[Image:Britannia-Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|The Statue of [[Britannia]] in [[Plymouth]]. Britannia is a [[national personification]] of the UK.]]
* The [[flag of the United Kingdom]] is the [[Union Flag]] commonly known as the "Union Jack". It was created by the superimposition of the flags of [[Flag of England|England]] ([[St George's Cross]]) and [[Flag of Scotland|Scotland]] ([[Saint Andrew's Cross]]), with the [[Saint Patrick's cross]], to represent Ireland, being added to this in 1801. [[Wales]] is not represented in the Union Flag as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom.  However, the possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7114248.stm Welsh dragon call for Union flag] BBC News, November 27, 2007 </ref>

* The [[national anthem]] of the United Kingdom is "[[God Save the King]]", with "King" replaced with "Queen" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is female. The anthem's name, however, remains "God Save the King". 

* [[Britannia]] is a [[National personification|personification]] of the United Kingdom, originating from the [[Roman occupation of Britannia|Roman occupation]] of southern and central Great Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html |title=Britannia on British Coins |publisher=Chard |accessdate=2006-06-25}}</ref> Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair, wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]] and white robes. She holds [[Poseidon]]'s three-pronged trident and a [[shield]], bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as riding the back of a lion. At and since the height of the British Empire, Britannia has often associated with maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song ''[[Rule Britannia]]''.

* The [[lion]] symbol is depicted behind Britannia on the [[British fifty pence coin|50 pence]] piece and one is shown crowned on the back of the [[10p|10 pence]] piece. It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the [[British Army]]. 

* The [[bulldog]] is sometimes used as a symbol of [[Great Britain]], and has been associated with [[Winston Churchill]]'s defiance of Nazi Germany.

=== National symbols within the United Kingdom ===
{{main|National symbols of Scotland}}
* A number of 'national anthems' are used for the individual countries of the UK with varying degrees of popular acceptance, the most popular being [[Flower of Scotland]], [[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]] in Wales, [[Londonderry Air]] in Northern Ireland and [[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]] in England.

* [[Lion]]s have been used as [[heraldic device]]s, including in the royal arms of the kingdoms of [[Coat of Arms of England|England]], [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in [[Wales]]. The lion is featured on the emblem of the [[England national football team]], giving rise to the popular football anthem ''[[Three Lions]]'', and the [[England national cricket team]]. The "three lions" on the English coat of arms were originally two leopards. An extra leopard was added by [[Richard the Lionheart]] and with the help of his name, they became known as three lions. They are now drawn to look more like lions. Leopards are traditionally depicted lying down whereas lions were drawn standing on all fours or up on their hind legs attacking, as in the Scottish [[Lion Rampant]]. 

* England (and sometimes Britain) has been personified as the character [[John Bull]], although this character is rarely used in modern times.

* The [[oak]] tree and the [[rose]] have long been a widely used proxy for the visual representation of English identity. The red rose is the emblem of the [[England national rugby union team]] and the [[Rugby Football Union]]. 

* The [[thistle]] is widely used as a Scottish symbol. 

* The [[daffodil]] and [[leek]] are used as Welsh symbols.
