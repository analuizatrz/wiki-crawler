A '''shoot 'em up''' is a [[computer and video game genres|computer and video game genre]] where the player controls a vehicle or character along no more than two axises of movement and fights large numbers of enemies with shooting attacks, usually of a highly stylized nature. They are the purest form of [[action game]] still in existence. These games were traditionally just called "shooters," but with the advent of new technology, new genres emerged like [[first person shooter]]s, [[rail shooter]]s and [[third person shooter]]s, and the "shoot 'em up" term came to indicate this narrower school of design. This is sometimes shortened to "shmup." Other terms exist to distinguish this genre, including "space shooter," "scrolling shooter," and "arcade shooter." In Japan, where the genre remains most vital, they are known simply as "shooting games."

Shoot 'em ups originated in the [[arcade game|arcades]] with [[Space Invaders]] usually being credited with the genre's birth. They peaked in popularity during the late 80s and early 90s, primarily as arcade and [[video game console|console]] titles. As the use of [[3D graphics]] became more common in video games, the simplicity and arcade sensibilities of the genre slowly relegated their popularity to that of a niche. Today the genre still retains a small, but loyal following, particularly among Japanese arcade goers, and there are still a number of companies devoted to their development.

While these games often appear very similar, and indeed the genre is steeped in rigid convention, there are many diverse schools of design, ranging from "manic" shoot 'em ups that test player's reflexes, to "methodical" shooters that challenge players on memorization and strategic approach. There are also many diverse themes in the genre, including whimsical "cute" shooters like [[Fantasy Zone]] and [[Parodius]], [[science-fiction]] themed games like [[R-Type]] and [[Gradius]], historically set games like [[1942 (arcade game)|1942]], and [[fantasy]]-based titles like [[ESP Galuda]] and [[Guwange]].

== History ==

The shooter genre is the oldest genre in gaming beginning with the very first computer game, ''[[Space War]]''. There were a number of early [[discrete logic]] games that featured various space and flight-themed shooting, but it wasn't until 1978's seminal [[Space Invaders]] that the genre took off. ''Space Invaders'' is notable for pitting the player against many on-screen enemies that came from the top of the screen. This convention still exists today, with nearly ever vertically oriented scrolling shooter having the player facing the top of the screen, with enemies coming from above.

[[Space Invaders]] was also a massive commercial success, even causing a coin shortage in Japan. It was quickly imitated by nearly every major arcade manufacturer at the time. Some of these imitations, like ''Space Stranger'' and ''Super Invader Attack'', were clones which added little, if anything, to the ''Space Invaders'' formula. Others, like Namco's ''[[Galaxian]]'' took the genre further with more complex enemy patterns, and richer graphics.

1980's ''[[Defender]]'' introduced a [[scrolling]] playfield to the shoot 'em up formula. It offered horizontally extended levels. Unlike most later games in the genre, this scrolling could go in either direction, and followed the player. This would be imitated by some later shoot 'em ups, notably ''[[Choplifter]]'' and ''[[Fantasy Zone]]''. The following year, [[Konami]] introduced [[Scramble]], a side scrolling shooter with forced scrolling. It was the first scrolling shooter to offer multiple, distinct levels, and laid the groundwork for ''[[Gradius]]''. Konami has since [[retconned]] ''Scramble'' into the ''Gradius'' series to acknowledge this influence.

Vertical scrolling shooters developed around the same time. While early titles like ''Galaxian'' offered scrolling star fields, they were merely superficial. [[Sega]]'s [[Borderline (game)|Borderline]](1981) was a vertical shooter with primitive scrolling. In March of the next year, [[Data East]] released ''Mission-X'' and ''Zoar'', the latter of which was licensed from Tago Electronics. Both games were very similar, with ''Zoar'' being the more developed of the two, with seperate attacks for airborne and surface-based enemies. This same year Orca released ''Funky Bee''which offered more a more straightforward approach. These games would be overshadowed at the end of the year, when [[Namco]] released [[Xevious]], a title often credited with being the first vertically scrolling shooter.

1985 was a big year for shoot 'em ups, thanks to two major games. ''[[Tiger Heli]]'' was the first shooter from the developer [[Toaplan]], who would become an important name in the genre over the decade to follow. ''Tiger Heli'' is perhaps most notable for introducing the "megabomb," a powerful limited use weapon, and one of the genres most popular conventions. This same year saw the release of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Gradius]]'', another major innovator. Gradius introduced selectable weapons, as well as "options," small offensive pods that follow and aid the player. These conventions, would be frequently imitated in later shooters.

== Fixed shooter ==

Fixed shooters represent the bulk of the earliest shoot 'em up games. They have the most simplistic premises and the most simplistic controls, especially in terms of aiming. They are characterized by a static environment and a static number of enemies per level, although this stipulation does not preclude each level having a different number or enemies or a different setting, as is the case with [[Midway Games|Midway]]'s ''[[Gorf]]''.

[[Image:Spaceinvaders.png|thumb|right|''[[Space Invaders]]''<br />Arcade - ©1978 [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]]]

A '''single screen shooter''', also known as its generic '''fixed shooter''' or '''gallery shooter''' typically only allows players their one or two-dimensional position on the screen. Single screen shooters are basically the oldest popular type of shooters, and represent the bulk of shoot 'em ups from 1977 through 1983. One of the most popular games of all time, ''[[Space Invaders]]'', falls into this sub-genre. Early single screen shooters allowed only one-dimensional movement, while later titles allowed two-dimensional movement, but without rotation. Enemies usually form in a gallery, and the game setup is most often in a vertical orientation. Unlike other types of shooters, the gameplay involves eliminating every enemy on the screen in order to complete the current round or level. Typically, the number of enemies remains constant through each level, only the speed and number of projectiles fired increase in each level.

Example single screen shooters include ''[[Space Invaders]]'', ''[[Galaxian]]'', ''[[Phoenix (arcade game)|Phoenix]]'' and ''[[Galaga]]''.

[[Image:GyrussArcade.png|thumb|right|''[[Gyruss]]''<br />Arcade - ©1983 [[Konami]]]]

'''Tube shooters''' comprises games where players move forward through a "tube", essentially a 2D scrolling shooter plane rolled into a cylinder or extended to a three dimensional volume. Movement is usually restricted to the ring formed by the edge of the curved plane. This is considered more of a niche variety of shooter, appearing mostly in the early 1980s. The reason for this is because, this type of shooter came at a time when [[arcade hardware]] had not progressed enough to allow full three-dimensional movement. This type of game is a pseudo-simulation of that. Recent games to use this type of gameplay are ''[[Tempest 2000]]'', its sequel ''[[Tempest 3000]]'' and freeware ''[[Torus Trooper]]'' from [[ABA Games]].

Example tube shooters include ''[[Tempest (arcade game)|Tempest]]'', ''[[Gyruss]]'' and ''[[Tube Panic]]''.

== Multi-directional shooter ==
[[Image:Robotron:_2084.png|thumb|right|''[[Robotron: 2084]]''<br />Arcade - ©1982 [[Williams Electronics]]]]

'''Multi-directional shooters''', also called '''arena shooters''', and sometimes [[top down shooter]], allow freedom of movement and orientation in a two-dimensional environment. Most multi-directional shooters can be further put into two classes based on their control system. Some allow the player to move up, down, left, right, or in some cases, diagonally only. Others use a more realistic, [[physics]]-based system of rotating and thrusting. Another alternative is [[mouse]] control.

The environments that these games take place in are sometimes fixed-size arenas (with or without borders), large maps, or infinfitely expanding in all directions.

'''Thrust-based''' games use simplified physics for motion of protagonists and enemies, most commonly in a zero gravity environment ("pure" physics where forces such as drag are negated).  The first game of this type was ''[[Spacewar!]]'', which  has the distinction of being one of the earliest video games ever made. This was followed up with a [[coin-op]] version called ''[[Computer Space]]'' in 1976. One of the most popular games of all time, ''[[Asteroids (game)|Asteroids]]'', was created by [[Atari]] in  [[1979]] and has a similar setup, although it is single player. Much of the challenge in these games comes from careful use of thrusting, as there are no brakes in the zero-gravity environments presented. To slow-down or stop, the player has to thrust in opposite directions.

Example games include ''[[Sinistar]]'', ''[[Blasteroids]]'' and ''[[Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warpship]]''.

Some multidirectional shooters use two [[joystick]]s as the input; one for movement, and the other for firing. This style was popularized by [[Eugene Jarvis]] in the several titles he created for [[Midway Games|Midway]]/[[Williams]] and is an effective means of allowing independent moving and firing. This unique input configuration often left console ports with only a crude approximation of the arcade controls, resulting in the use of four buttons as directional firing, or the use of both the first and second player controllers to achieve the desired effect. Some modern [[video game console]]s may be able to avoid this problem, as some have two analog joysticks on the controllers. 

Some titles in this genre are often considered ''danmaku'', due to the large quantity of enemies on screen at any given time.  The player has to avoid being surrounded by "carving" a hole out of the swath of enemies, while traversing the gameplay area. These games require extensive [[hand-eye coordination]], as the player has to look and shoot in different places while analyzing the attacks of over a hundred enemies simultaneously.  Today, the [[Xbox 360]], through its [[Xbox Live Arcade]] has brought resurgent popularity to the multi-directional shooter subgenre. ''[[Geometry Wars]]: Retro Evolved'' has become the top selling game on the service, with over 185,000 purchases and downloads as of [[July 21]] [[2006]].<ref>http://www.xboxic.com/news/1312</ref> Several Eugene Jarvis-created shooters are also available on the service, including enhanced versions of ''[[Smash TV]]'' and ''[[Robotron: 2084]]''.

Example multi-directional shooters include ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', ''[[Time Pilot]]'', ''[[Bosconian]]'', ''[[Smash TV]]'', ''[[Bangai-O]]'', ''[[Geometry Wars]]'', ''[[Sinistar]]'', ''[[Desert Strike]]'', ''[[Crimsonland]]'' and ''[[Zone 66]]''.

== Run and gun games ==
{{main|Run and gun}}
[[Image:Gunstar_heroes-lvl1.png|thumb|right|''[[Gunstar Heroes]]'', a famous [[run and gun]], ©1993 [[Treasure]]]]

'''Run and gun''' is a term commonly associated with two related types of games. '''Side-view run and gun games''' are a hybrid of the shoot 'em up and [[platform game|platform]] genres, and are commonly confused with shoot 'em ups. These games are simply very action-oriented platform games, with a focus on shooting. ''[[Contra]]'' and ''Gunstar Heroes'' are popular games of this type. These games are generally ''not'' accepted as shoot 'em ups, but the genre is still related

'''Overhead view run and gun game''' is a genre that has some overlap with shoot 'em ups. An overhead view run and gun may or may be a shoot 'em up, but isn't necessarily. These games are characterized by a [[humanoid]] character on the ground, viewed from above. Some classic shoot 'em ups, like [[Smash TV]] and [[Guwange]] could be termed run and guns. Others, like [[Valkyrie no Densetsu]] and [[Etoile Princess]] involve more freedom of movement, environmental interaction, platforming and other non-shooter elements, and would not be correctly termed [[shoot 'em ups]]. 

Example side-view run and guns include the ''[[Contra series]]'', the ''[[Metal Slug series]]'', ''[[Turrican]]'', ''[[Gunstar Heroes]]'', ''[[Stick Soldiers]]'' and ''[[Soldat]]''. Example overhead run and guns include ''[[Shock Troopers]]'', ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'', ''[[Heavy Barrel]]'', ''[[Out Zone]]'' and ''[[Ikari Warriors]]''.

== Scrolling shooters ==
{{main|Scrolling shooter}}

[[Image:Ikaruga_01.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Ikaruga]]''<br />Arcade - ©2001 [[Treasure Co. Ltd|Treasure]]]]

'''Vertical scrolling shooters''', or '''vert shooters''' for short, are largely similar to horizontal scrollers, but the direction of scroll tends to force a different viewpoint on the game: vertical scrollers are nearly always viewed from above. This means that it is less common to have solid obstacles in these games, as the player is usually above them. Perhaps because of this difference, vertical scrollers tend to be more intense, focusing on shooting and dodging copious amounts of projectiles.

The first vertical scrolling shooter was ''[[Xevious]]'', released in 1982. This game introduced many concepts that are standard in scrolling shooters today, such as an episodic level structure, and [[boss (video games)|boss]]es. It can be argued that very early games like ''[[Galaxian]]'' can be considered vertical scrollers, as they are set against a constantly scrolling starfield. However, they are generally classed as fixed shooters along with ''Space Invaders'', as the stars are purely for visual effect and add nothing to the gameplay.

When the "top-down" or "overhead" names are used, the line becomes blurrier. By this definition, ''Space Invaders'' would likely be the first game of the type – and indeed, many consider it the first true top-down shooter. As with their horizontal counterparts, some vertical shooters may allow a degree of free horizontal movement.

Example vertical shooters include ''[[1942 (arcade game)|1942]]'', ''[[Xevious]]'', ''[[Ikaruga]]'', ''[[Radiant Silvergun]]'', ''[[Raiden (arcade game)|Raiden]]'', ''[[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]]'', ''[[Aero Fighters]]'', ''[[Chromium B.S.U.]]'' and ''[[Tyrian (computer game)|Tyrian]]''.

''Vertical scrolling shooters'' come into two more varieties; '''Tate''' shoot 'em ups are those that are played on a vertically oriented monitor, and '''Yoko''' shoot 'em ups are those played on a standard horizontal monitor set-up. Tate shoot 'em ups usually begin as standard Jamma cabinets with Tate monitors. However, the screen orientation can be a potential issue when the game is ported to home consoles with regular TVs.

There are four known ways to adapt a tate shoot 'em up to home consoles:

* Black borders on the sides – the most common form of adaptation but sacrifices screen size
* Turning the TV on the side – a practice that may damage some TVs
* Zooming or stretching the game area
* Horizontal gameplay orientation – an optional mode in some games, such as ''Ikaruga''

[[Image:Gradius_04.png|thumb|right|''[[Gradius]]''<br />Arcade - ©1985 [[Konami]]]]

'''Horizontal scrolling shooters''', sometimes abbreviated jokingly as "horzies", are played on an eponymously oriented screen, but there are a few exceptions - such as ''[[Darius (arcade game)|Darius]]'', which uses more than one monitor to create an extensive playfield, and ''[[Stinger (arcade game)|Stinger]]'', which uses horizontal scrolling in a vertically oriented screen.  As well as battling enemies, much of the challenge in horizontal scrollers tends to come from navigating the environment, as invariably contact with the level results in either the immediate death of or damage to the player's character. Some games, such as ones in the [[Gradius series|''Gradius'' series]] always feature a maze-like level that is almost solely focused on avoiding collisions. Enemies are more likely to come from behind the player's ship in these types of games than their vertically scrolling counterparts are.

[[Image:Stinger (arcade game).png|thumb|left|''[[Stinger (arcade game)|Stinger]]''<br />Arcade - ©1983 [[Seibu Denshi]]]]

Typically, the scrolling in these games is continuous, such that the player is led through a level by the game. There is also sometimes a degree of vertical freedom, in which the player can move up or down on a playing area which is taller than the screen itself. (''[[Thunder Force IV]]'' and ''[[Dragon Breed]]'' are two games which take this to extremes).

Almost all horizontal scrolling shooters view the player's avatar from the side, and present the level in cross-section, such that the player appears to be flying 'through' something, such as a landscape or a mothership. The first horizontal scroller was arguably ''[[Defender (arcade game)|Defender]]'', released in [[1980]], although it shares few features with other horizontal scrollers. Horizontally scrolling shooters, along with their vertical counterparts, remain very popular today.

Example horizontal shooters include ''[[Darius (arcade game)|Darius]]'', ''[[Gradius]]'', ''[[Jets'n'Guns]]'',
''[[R-Type]]'', ''[[Scramble (arcade game)|Scramble]]'' and ''[[Thunderforce]]''.

[[Image:Salamander_02.png|thumb|right|''[[Salamander (arcade game)|Salamander / Life Force]]''<br />Arcade - ©1986 [[Konami]]]]

'''Multi-scrolling shooters''' are a combination of several different types of scrolling shooters. Typically, it involves the combination of vertical and horizontal levels, but examples exist that use other types. For example, ''[[Gradius III]]'' has two levels that  where the player must guide the ship through a tube-like tunnel, avoiding collisions.

Example multi-scrolling shoot 'em ups include ''[[Abadox]], [[Salamander (arcade game)|Salamander]]'', ''[[Axelay]]'', ''[[Vanguard (arcade game)|Vanguard]]'', and ''[[Silver Surfer (video game)|Silver Surfer]]''.

[[Image:Zaxxon_game.png|thumb|right|''[[Zaxxon]]''<br />Arcade - ©1982 [[Sega]]]]

Also known as a 3/4 view shooter or three-quarter perspective shooter, an '''[[Isometric projection|isometric]] shooter ''' uses vertical shooter's playing field that is modified for perspective. In a traditional scrolling shooter situation, the  upwards/forwards is diagonal and the player simulates moving by the gameworld scrolling around diagonally. Perspective limits the size of the playing field, so generally there is additional focus on avoiding obstacles than shooting enemy ships. Isometric shooters are not limited to scrolling shooters, but can be multi-directional/area shooters as well.

These shoot 'em ups have not been a popular choice to date, although there have been a handful of popular titles. This type of shooter, much like the ''tube shooter'', is more of an anachronism in today's games. These titles were remarkable in their times for their pseudo-3d graphics; when the hardware became sophisticated enough to fully render such graphics, these games had lost their appeal, in favor of the more traditional vertically and horizontally scrolling types. 

Example isometric shooters include ''[[Zaxxon]]'', ''[[Viewpoint (video game)|Viewpoint]]'' and ''[[Blazer (arcade game)|Blazer]]''.

== Rail shooter ==
{{main|Rail shooter}}
[[Image:SNES Star Fox.png|thumb|right|''[[Star Fox (video game)|Star Fox]]''<br />[[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] - ©1993 [[Nintendo]]]]

'''[[Rail shooter]]s''' are a related genre which some include as a form of shoot 'em up, and others do not. They share many of the same elements of shoot 'em ups. The main distinction between these games and classic shoot 'em ups is the use of a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] or [[psuedo-3D]] view, usually either behind the player's character or vehicle or first person. Gameplay progresses along a pre-determined path, or "rail," lending a forced progression similar to scrolling shoot 'em ups. Often the player has some limited freedom to move laterally along this path without deviating from it, as in ''[[Space Harrier]]'' or ''[[Star Fox]]'', but other times the player simply manipulates a [[crosshair]] on screen as in ''[[Star Wars (arcade game)| Star Wars]]'' or ''[[Panzer Dragoon]]''.

Example 3D shooters include ''[[After Burner]]'', ''[[Red Baron (arcade game)|Red Baron]]'', ''[[Space Harrier]]'', ''[[ThunderBlade]]'', ''[[Star Fox (series)|Star Fox]]'', ''[[Panzer Dragoon]]'' and ''[[Rez]]''.

== Schools of design ==

[[Image:PCByukari140.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]'' &ndash; [[2003]] [[Team Shanghai Alice]]]]
{{main|Bullet hell}}

'''Bullet hell''' games ([[Japan|Japanese]] : danmaku 弾幕, lit. "bullet curtain"; also less commonly "manic" or "curtain" shooters) is a more obscure sub-genre. While standard shooters generally have a comparably few amount of bullets and a larger hitbox for the player, ''danmaku'' are the exact opposite. Many projectiles fill the screen while the player has a very small margin at which they are hit. Shoot 'em ups of this style are usually 'Vertical shooter' types; however, other types are known to exist.

Example bullet hell games include ''[[Touhou Project]]'', ''[[Ikaruga]]'', ''[[Psyvariar 2]]'', ''[[Batsugun]]'', ''[[Giga Wing]]'', ''[[DoDonPachi]]'', ''[[Warning Forever]]'' and most of the [[ABA Games]] series.

The flipside of Bullet Hell shooters are '''methodical shooters'''. This style of design is based more on precise, slower, methodical movements. While they are still very difficult they are based less on navigating through clusters of bullets. They usually have larger hit boxes and lower bullet counts. They more often have environments that can be collided with, slower scrolling, and rely heavily on memorization.

Example methodical shooters include ''[[Darius (arcade game)|Darius]]'', ''[[Gradius]]'' and ''[[R-Type]]''.

'''Competitive shooters''' features two players playing simultaneously. Instead of working together, the two players are trying to outlast and thwart the other player. The field is usually split-screen with a vertical shooter type.

Example competitive shooters include ''[[Harmotion]]'', ''[[Twinkle Star Sprites]]'', ''[[Quarth]]'' and ''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''.

== Lexicon of shoot 'em up vernacular ==
Because shoot 'em up games currently have a small, and very dedicated following, there is a great deal of jargon particular to the genre. Some of the more common terms follow:

* '''1CC:''' One-credit completion. This refers to completing a game, or a "loop" with one one credit (or without using a "continue" feature).
* '''Bullet hell:''' A euphemism for the "manic" school of shoot 'em up design, characterized by an abundance of enemy fire, usually in highly stylized firing patterns.
* '''Charge shot:''' A powerful attack executed by holding the fire button while the attack charges, and then releasing the button to fire. 
* '''Cute 'em up:''' A [[portmanteau]] of "cute" and "shoot 'em up," used to refer to games in the genre with whimsical themes and bright colors.
* '''Hit box:''' The region of the player's ship or character used in collision detection. Only hazards that pass inside this hit box will damage the player.
* '''Hori:''' Short for horizontal. Unlike "yoko" this refers to the direction of scrolling, not the monitor orientation.
* '''Loop:''' Some shooters will repeat their levels after a certain point. A full set of levels is called a "loop." Some levels will repeat infinitely, and others will contain just two loops.
* '''Option:''' In shoot 'em ups, an "option" is a small offensive ship or pod that orbits or follows the primary ship, and supplements its firepower. 
* '''Megabomb:''' A large, very destructive weapon, usually a large bomb (hence the name), but may take other forms as well. These attacks are generally tightly rationed, usually to three uses per life.
* '''Shmup:''' A shorted version of "shoot 'em up." The term was coined by the British [[C64]] magazine, [[Zzap 64]] in 1985. The term is most commonly used in Europe, but it has gained popularity in recent years because of its lack of ambiguity.
* '''Tate:''' Derived from the Japanese word for "vertical," this refers specifically to vertical monitor alignment, as in the arcade versions of ''[[Galaxian]]'' or ''[[Pac-Man]]''. It is unrelated to the direction of scrolling.
* '''Vert:''' Short for vertical. This refers to the direction of scrolling, not the monitor orientation
* '''Wobble:''' In games that scroll primarily on one axis, but allow for limited scrolling to follow the player on another axis, the secondary scrolling is called "wobble." Popular examples include ''[[Raiden (arcade game)|Raiden]], and [[Twin Cobra]]
* '''Yoko:''' From the Japanese term for "horizontal" this refers to the horizontal monitor alignments, typical of home television sets.
