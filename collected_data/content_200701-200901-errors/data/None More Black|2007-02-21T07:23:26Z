'''None More Black''' was a [[New Jersey]]-based melodic [[punk rock|punk]] outfit on [[Fat Wreck Chords]], formed by lead singer / guitarist [[Jason Shevchuk]] after the demise of his previous band, [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Kid Dynamite]]. Jason left Kid Dynamite so that he could finish film school, and "to sort some things out." While at school, Jason had written some songs and would play them with his roommate Dan and a drum machine. By 2000, they had a second guitarist and a real drummer. That lineup soon fell apart, but by 2001 Jason and Dan had recruited Jason's brother Jeff, along with a new drummer.  But after recording a 7" for Sub Division Records, that lineup fell apart, this time leaving only Jeff and Jason. But finally in 2002 (after a few more lineup changes) a solid (or so it seemed) lineup was established, featuring Paul from Kill Your Idols on bass.  A demo was recorded, circulated, and the band went on to release their first full length on Fat Wreck Chords.  

The band's sound was unique although can be compared to label mates [[the Lawrence Arms]]. Their name originates from a line in [[mockumentary]] movie [[This Is Spinal Tap]]. Several of the band's song titles are references to jokes from the television show [[Seinfeld]].

The band released two full-lengths and two EP's. Their most recent album, titled "This is Satire", was released on May 2nd, 2006 by [[Fat Wreck Chords]].  

In January 2007 the band announced that they were going on a "hiatus" and that they would play shows every now and again.  There is no official explanation as to why the band has split.  Jason Shevchuk has already moved on and started a new project called On Guard.  Colin McGinniss and Paul Delaney decided to create a new hardcore/punk band called Ram and Ox.
