'''John Wilkes Booth''' ([[May 10]] [[1838]] – [[April 26]] [[1865]]) was an [[United States|American]] stage [[actor]] who, as part of a conspiracy plot,  assassinated [[Abraham Lincoln]], the 16th [[President of the United States]], at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on [[April 14]], [[1865]]. Lincoln died the next day from the single gunshot wound to the back of the head, becoming the first American president to be assassinated. 

Booth was a member of the prominent 19th century [[Booth family]] of actors from [[Maryland]]. He was also a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer and expressed vehement dissatisfaction with the South's defeat in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. He opposed Lincoln's proposal to extend [[Suffrage|voting rights]] to recently emancipated [[slavery in the United States|slaves]].

Booth and a group of co-conspirators led by him planned to kill Abraham Lincoln, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Henry Seward, Sr.|William Seward]], and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin Stanton]] in a desperate bid to help the tottering Confederacy's cause. Although [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] had surrendered four days earlier, Booth believed the war was not yet over since Confederate General [[Joseph Johnston]]'s army was still fighting the [[Union Army]] under General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. Of the conspirators, only Booth was successful in carrying out his part of the plot.

Following the shooting, Booth fled by horseback to southern Maryland and eventually to a farm in rural northern [[Virginia]], where he was tracked down and killed by Union soldiers twelve days later. Several of the other conspirators were tried and [[hanging|hanged]] shortly thereafter. In later years, some have suggested that Booth escaped his pursuers and subsequently died many years later under a [[pseudonym]].

==Background and early life==
His parents, the noted British [[Shakespeare in performance|Shakespearean]] actor [[Junius Brutus Booth]] and his actress wife [[Mary Ann Holmes]], immigrated to the United States from [[England]] in 1821, purchasing a farm known as "Tudor Hall" near [[Bel Air, Harford County, Maryland|Bel Air, Maryland]], where John Wilkes Booth was born in 1838.<ref name=CourtTV>{{cite web | last = Geringer | first = Joseph  | title = John Wilkes Booth: A Brutus of His Age | work = Crime Library  | publisher = [[Court TV]] | date =  | url = http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/booth/1.html | accessdate =  2007-10-17 }}</ref><ref>The Booth family's house, "Tudor Hall", was built in 1847 and still stands today; it was acquired by [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]] in 2006, to be eventually opened to the public as a historic site and museum.</ref> He was named after the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] revolutionary [[John Wilkes]], who the family claimed was a distant relative.<ref>Booth's uncle Algernon Sydney Booth was said to be the great-great-great-grandfather of [[Cherie Blair]] (née Booth), wife of former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]].{{spaces|2}}–{{spaces|2}}{{cite web|author=Phil Westwood|title=The Lincoln-Blair Affair|url=http://www.genealogytoday.com/uk/columns/westwood/021025.html}}However, Algernon Sydney Booth died at the age of 5 in 1803. Archer, S. ''Junius Brutus Booth: Theatrical Prometheus'' (1992): 282.</ref>

Booth was educated in the classic literature, particularly [[Shakespeare]]. He attended the Bel Air Academy, where his headmaster described him as "Not deficient in intelligence, but disinclined to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered him. Each day he rode back and forth from farm to school, taking more interest in what happened along the way than in reaching his classes on time".<ref>Stanley Kimmel, ''The Mad Booths of Maryland''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1940.</ref>

In 1850-1851, he attended Milton Boarding School for Boys located in [[Sparks, Maryland]].<ref>The Milton Boarding School building in Sparks, Md., which John Wilkes Booth once attended, still stands and is now the ''Milton Inn'' restaurant.</ref> As recounted by Booth's sister, [[Asia Booth]] Clarke, in her book entitled "''The Unlocked Book''," the future actor met an old Gypsy woman in the woods near the school who gave him a grim assessment of his life and said he would die young.<ref>Clarke, Asia Booth. ''The Unlocked Book'' (1938):56-57.</ref> In 1851, at age 13, Booth attended St. Timothy's Hall, a Protestant Episcopal military academy in [[Catonsville, Maryland]]. Following in the footsteps of their father (who had died in 1852), Booth and his brothers [[Edwin Booth|Edwin]] and [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.|Junius Brutus, Jr.]] would become well-known actors in mid-nineteenth century America.<ref>Booth is sometimes connected to historical assassin [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], for whom Booth's father was named. On November 25, 1864, Booth acted in a version of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', where he played [[Mark Antony]]. His brother Edwin played the larger role of Brutus.{{spaces|2}}–{{spaces|2}}

On [[January 23]], [[1853]] Booth was [[Baptism|baptized]] into the [[Episcopal Church of the United States|Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States]] and prepared for the Episcopal confirmation ceremony.<ref>"younger brother [Joseph] were placed at the finishing school at Catonsville, St. Timothy's Hall . . . They here received Baptism [January 23, 1853], and were prepared for the Confirmation according to the Episcopal Church. They entered the Hall as artillery cadets, and wore the steel-gray uniform of the class. Some of the best names of Maryland were on the roll of students at this Hall, names that have resounded through our country both in honor and contumely, names, too, that seem to have gone down in silence with the cause they espoused." <br>

==Theatrical career and Civil War==
[[Image:Booths Caesar.jpg|thumb|John Wilkes Booth, Edwin Booth and Junius Brutus Booth, Jr. in [[Shakespeare]]’s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' in 1864.]]
At the age of 17, Booth played the Earl of Richmond in Shakespeare's ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. In 1857, he joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. At his request he was billed as "J.B. Wilkes", a pseudonym meant to divert attention away from his famous [[actor|thespian]] family. In 1858 he was accepted as a member of the Richmond Theatre, Virginia, stock company, and became increasingly popular, called "the handsomest man in America" by reviewers. He stood {{convert|5|ft|8|in|m}} tall, had jet-black hair, and was lean and athletic. He was also an excellent swordsman. His performances were often characterized by his contemporaries as acrobatic and intensely physical.<ref name=townsend>George Alfred Townsend, ''The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth''. New York: Dick & Fitzgerald, 1865.(ISBN 978-0976480532).</ref> A fellow actress once recalled that he occasionally cut himself with his own sword. 

On [[December 2]], [[1859]], Booth attended the hanging of militant  [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], who was executed for leading a raid on the Federal [[Armory (military)|armory]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] (in present-day [[West Virginia]]).<ref name=townsend/> Booth bought a uniform from a member of the Richmond Grays militia unit, which was heading for [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], and he joined the Grays, who stood guard for Brown's trial. When Brown was hanged, Booth stood at the foot of the scaffold.<ref name=CourtTV />

Abraham Lincoln was elected president on [[November 6]], [[1860]], and the following month Booth wrote a long speech that decried Northern [[abolitionism]] and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of [[slavery]]. On [[April 12]], [[1861]], the Civil War erupted, and eventually 11 Southern states [[secession|seceded]] from the Union. Booth's family was from [[Maryland]], a [[Border states (Civil War)|border state]] which remained in the Union during the war despite a slaveholding portion of the population that favored the Confederacy. Because Maryland shared a border with [[Washington, D.C.]], Lincoln declared [[martial law]] in Maryland and ordered the imprisonment of pro-secession Maryland political leaders at [[Ft. McHenry]] to prevent the state's secession, a move that many, including Booth, viewed as [[unconstitutional]].<ref>Kauffman, M. ''American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies'' (2004):104-114.</ref>

Although Booth was pro-Confederate, his family, like many Marylanders, was divided, and to preserve harmony among his brothers, Booth promised his mother that he would not enlist in the [[Confederate Army]]. As a popular actor in the 1860s, he travelled extensively to perform in both North and South, and as far west as [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].<ref name=townsend/> Booth was outspoken in his love for the South, and equally outspoken in his hatred for Lincoln. In early 1862, Booth was arrested by a provost marshal in [[Saint Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] for making anti-government remarks.

Booth and Lincoln crossed paths on several occasions. Lincoln was an avid theater-goer and especially loved Shakespeare. On [[November 9]], [[1863]], Lincoln saw Booth in Charles Selby's ''The Marble Heart'' at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D. C.|Washington]]. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln sat in the same "presidential box" in which he would later be assassinated.<ref name=CourtTV />

Booth made a final appearance at Ford's on [[March 18]], [[1865]], when he played Duke Pescara in ''The Apostate'' in what was the last appearance of his career. However, Booth's family were long time friends with [[John T. Ford]], the theater's owner, and Booth was in and out of the theater so often during the war that he even had his mail sent there.<ref name=townsend/> This granted Booth complete access to Ford's Theatre, day and night.

==Plotting to kidnap Lincoln==
[[Image:Soldiers-Home-Lincoln-Cottage.jpg|thumb|Booth's plan was to kidnap Lincoln from the Old Soldiers Home]]
By 1864, the tide of the war had shifted in the North's favor. The North halted prisoner exchange in an attempt to diminish the size of the Confederate Army, and because the Confederates refused to exchange captured [[African-American]] soldiers. Booth began devising a plan to kidnap Lincoln from his summer residence at the [[President Lincoln and Soldiers' Home National Monument|Old Soldiers Home]] three miles (5 [[km]]) from the White House and smuggle him across the [[Potomac]] and into [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. He would be exchanged for the release of around 10,000 Southern soldiers held captive in Northern prisons. He successfully recruited his old friends Samuel Arnold and Michael O'Laughlin as accomplices.<ref>Benjamin P. Thomas, ''Abraham Lincoln, a Biography''. New York: Random House, 1952.</ref>

In the summer of 1864, Booth met with several well-known Confederate sympathizers at [[The Parker House]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. In October 1864, he made an unexplained trip to [[Montreal]]. At the time, Montreal was a well-known center of clandestine Confederate activities. He spent ten days in the city and stayed for a time at St. Lawrence Hall, a meeting place for the [[Confederate Secret Service]], and met at least one blockade runner there. It is possible that it was here that he also met Confederate Secret Service director [[James D. Bulloch]] as well as [[George Nicholas Sanders]], a one-time U.S. ambassador to Britain. Booth is believed to have been active in the "[[Knights of the Golden Circle]]", described as a "nest of 'Secesh' spies" (that is, pro-[[secessionist]]).<ref name=CourtTV /> 

There has been much scholarly attention devoted to why Booth was in Montreal at this time, and what he was doing there. No solid evidence has ever linked Booth's kidnapping or assassination plot to a conspiracy involving any elements of the Confederate government, although this possibility had been explored at some length in two books; Nathan Miller's ''Spying For America'' and William Tidwell's ''Come Retribution: the Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln''.   

Booth began to devote more and more of his energy and money to his plot to kidnap Lincoln after his re-election in early November 1864. He assembled a loose-knit band of Southern sympathizers, including [[David Herold]], [[George Atzerodt]], [[John Surratt]], and [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]] (also known as Lewis Payne). They began to meet routinely at the boarding-house of Surratt's mother, Mrs. [[Mary Surratt]].

On [[November 25]], [[1864]], he performed for the first and only time with his two brothers, [[Edwin Booth|Edwin]] and Junius, in a single engagement production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' at the [[Winter Garden Theater]] in [[New York]]. The proceeds went towards a statue of Shakespeare for [[Central Park]] which still stands today. The performance was interrupted by a failed attempt by clandestine Confederate agents to burn down several hotels, and by extension the city of New York, with [[Greek fire]]. One of the hotels was next door to the theater, but the fire was quickly extinguished. The following morning, Booth argued bitterly with his brother, Edwin, about Lincoln and the war. 

Three months later, Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on [[March 4]], [[1865]] as the invited guest of his secret fiancée, Lucy Hale. (Lucy's father, [[John P. Hale]], was Lincoln's minister to [[Spain]].) In the crowd below were Powell, Atzerodt, and Herold. There seems to have been no attempt to kidnap or assassinate Lincoln during the inauguration. Later, however, Booth remarked about "what a wonderful chance" he had to shoot Lincoln, if he had so chosen.<ref name=CourtTV />

On March 17, Booth learned at the last minute that Lincoln would be attending a performance of the play ''Still Waters Run Deep'' at a hospital near the Soldier's Home. Booth assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier's Home in the attempt to kidnap Lincoln en route to the hospital, but the president never showed up. Booth later learned that the President had changed his plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington, where Booth was staying at the time.<ref name=CourtTV />

==The assassination==

{{main|Abraham Lincoln assassination}}

On April 12, after hearing the news that [[Robert E. Lee]] had surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House]], Booth told [[Louis J. Weichmann]], a friend of John Surratt, and a boarder at Mary Surratt's house that he was done with the stage and that the only play he wanted to present henceforth was ''[[Venice Preserv'd]]''. Although Weichmann did not understand the reference, ''Venice Preserv'd'' is about an assassination plot.

The previous day, Booth was in the crowd outside the White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window. When Lincoln stated that he was in favor of granting [[suffrage]] to the former slaves, Booth declared that it would be the last speech Lincoln would ever make.<ref name=CourtTV /> "Our cause being almost lost", Booth wrote in his journal, "something decisive and great ''must'' be done."<ref name=Donald>David Herbert Donald, ''Lincoln''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995 (ISBN 0-684-80846-3).</ref> 

On the morning of [[Good Friday]], [[April 14]], [[1865]], Booth learned that the President and Mrs. Lincoln would be attending the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at Ford's Theatre. He immediately set about making plans for the assassination, which included a getaway horse waiting outside, and an escape route. Booth informed Powell, Herold and Atzerodt of his intention to kill Lincoln. He assigned Powell to assassinate Secretary of State Seward and Atzerodt to assassinate Vice-President Johnson. Herold would assist in their escape into Virginia.<ref name=townsend/>

[[Image:John Wilkes Booth wanted poster new.jpg|thumb|[[Wanted poster]] for Booth, Surratt, and Herold]]
By targeting Lincoln and his two immediate successors to the office, Booth seems to have intended to decapitate the Union government and throw it into a state of panic and confusion. Booth also planned to assassinate the Union commanding general, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]; however, Grant's wife had promised to visit family and so they were heading to [[New Jersey]]. Booth had hoped that the assassinations would create sufficient chaos within the Union that the Confederate government could reorganize and continue the war. 

As a famous and popular actor, Booth was a friend of the owner of Ford's Theatre, [[John T. Ford]], and had free access to all parts of the theater. Boring a spyhole into the presidential box earlier that day, the assassin could see if his intended victim had made it to the play. That evening, at around 10 p.m., as the play progressed, John Wilkes Booth slipped into Lincoln's box and shot him in the back of the head with a .44 caliber [[Derringer]]. Booth's escape was almost thwarted by Major [[Henry Rathbone]], who was present in the Presidential box with Mrs. [[Mary Todd Lincoln]].<ref name=townsend/>

Booth then jumped from the President's box and fell to the stage, injuring his leg when it snagged on a U.S. Treasury Guard flag used for decoration.<ref>One historian, Michael W. Kauffman, in his book ''American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies'' (ISBN 0-375-75974-3) written in 2004, contends that Booth actually broke his leg when his horse fell on him later in the escape, and that Booth's diary entry claiming it occurred jumping to the stage is a typical Booth dramatization.</ref> Witnesses said he shouted "''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]''" ([[Latin]] for "Thus always to tyrants", the Virginia state motto) from the stage, while others said he added, "The South is avenged."<ref name=Donald /><ref name=UMKC>{{cite web | last = Linder | first = Douglas  | title = Biographic Sketch of John Wilkes Booth | publisher = [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] | date = 2002  | url = http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lincolnconspiracy/booth.html#Death%20of | accessdate =  2007-10-16 }} </ref>

==Aftermath &mdash; pursuit and death==
In the ensuing pandemonium inside Ford's Theatre, Booth fled by a stage door to the alley, where he had a horse waiting, and galloped into southern Maryland, arriving before dawn on April 15 at the home of [[Samuel Mudd|Dr. Samuel Mudd]], who treated the injured leg.<ref>[[Samuel Mudd|Dr. Samuel Mudd]] was convicted of conspiracy by a military court and sentenced to [[life in prison]] at [[Dry Tortugas National Park|Fort Jefferson]] in the [[Dry Tortugas]] islands, west of Key West, Florida. He was [[pardon]]ed in 1869.</ref>  Booth and Herold remained in hiding as they continued to travel through southern Maryland before secretly crossing the Potomac into Virginia in April 21. 

[[Image:Booth escape route.png|thumb|left|300px|Booth's escape route]]
A detachment of 25 Union soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry Regiment, led by Lieutenant [[Edward P. Doherty]] and accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel [[Everton Conger]], pursued Booth through Southern Maryland and across the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Rappahannock River|Rappahannock]] rivers to Richard H. Garrett's farm, just south of [[Port Royal, Virginia|Port Royal]], [[Caroline County, Virginia|Caroline County]], [[Virginia]]. Booth and his companion, [[David E. Herold]], had been led to the farm by William S. Jett, formerly a private in the 9th Virginia Cavalry, whom they had met before crossing the Rappahannock.<ref name=NPS>{{cite web | title = John Wilkes Booth's Escape Route  | work = Ford's Theatre, National Historic Site  | publisher = [[National Park Service]] | date = [[December 22]], [[2004]] | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/foth/escapjwb.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}</ref>

Booth was surprised when he found little sympathy for his action, and wrote of his dismay in a journal entry on April 21, just before crossing the Potomac River into Virginia (''see map, left''), "[W]ith every man's hand against me, I am here in despair. And why; For doing what Brutus was honored for&nbsp;... And yet I for striking down a greater tyrant than they ever knew am looked upon as a common cutthroat".<ref>{{cite web | last = Linder | first = Douglas  | title = Last Diary Entry of John Wilkes Booth | publisher = [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] | date = 2002  | url = http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lincolnconspiracy/boothdiary.html| accessdate =  2007-10-16 }}</ref> 

Conger tracked down Jett and interrogated him, learning of Booth's location at the Garrett farm. Early in the morning of [[April 26]], [[1865]], the soldiers caught up with Booth there. Trapped in a [[tobacco]] barn, [[David Herold]] surrendered. Booth refused to surrender and the soldiers then set the barn ablaze.<ref name=UMKC />

[[Image:Garrett Farm.gif|thumb|The porch of the Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died in 1865]]
Sergeant [[Boston Corbett]] fired at Booth &mdash; whether orders to shoot were given is uncertain &mdash; fatally wounding him in the neck. Booth was dragged from the barn and died three hours later, at age 26, on the porch of the Garrett farmhouse. The bullet had severed his [[spinal cord]], [[paralysis|paralyzing]] him. In his last dying moments, he reportedly whispered "tell my mother I did it for my country," and asked for both his hands to be raised to his face so he could see them.  He looked at them and uttered his [[Wikiquote:Last words | final words]], "Useless, useless," and died as dawn was breaking.<ref name=NPS /><ref>James L.

Booth's body was taken to the [[ironclad]] [[USS Montauk (1862)|USS ''Montauk'']] at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] for identification and an [[autopsy]]. The body was then buried in a storage room at the Old Penitentiary at the Washington Arsenal. When the prison was razed in 1867, the body was moved to a warehouse on the Arsenal grounds. In [[1869]], the remains were once again identified before being released to the Booth family, where they were buried in the family plot at [[Greenmount Cemetery]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] after a [[Episcopal Church in the United States|Protestant Episcopal]] burial ceremony conducted by church minister Rev. James Fleming of Christ Protestant Episcopal Church.<ref>Kauffman, M. "Fort Lesley McNair and the Lincoln Conspirators."

=="Booth escaped" theories==
[[Image:Jwb farm.jpg|thumb|The [[Historical marker|Historic Site marker]] on [[U.S. Route 301 in Virginia|Route 301]], near Port Royal]]
Some individuals and writers have advanced theories that Booth escaped his pursuers and died years later under a [[pseudonym]]. An early popularizer of these "Booth Escape" theories was [[Finis L. Bates]] who claimed to have met Booth in [[Granbury, Texas]] in the 1870s and later to have taken possession of Booth's body after his suicide in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] in 1903. He toured the mummified body in carnival sideshows and wrote ''The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth'' (1907) in order to authenticate the mummy.

[[The Lincoln Conspiracy (book)|''The Lincoln Conspiracy'']] <ref>ISBN 1-56849-531-5.</ref> details the assassination, the Boyd plot, and Booth's escape to the swamps. ''The Curse of Cain: The Untold Story of John Wilkes Booth''.<ref>ISBN 1-58006-021-8.</ref> continues with the claim that Booth escaped, sought refuge in [[Japan]] and eventually returned to the United States where he died in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] in 1903. Another is that a man claiming to be Booth lived into the 1900s in [[Missouri]]. In the mid-1990s, an attempt was mounted to force the exhumation of Booth's presumed remains in order to conduct a photo-superimposition study.<ref>Kauffman, M. "Historians Oppose Opening of Booth Grave," ''Civil War Times'', May-June 1995.</ref> This was blocked by Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Joseph H. H. Kaplan, who cited, among other things, "the unreliability of petitioners' less-than-convincing escape/cover-up theory" as a major factor in his decision. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals upheld the ruling.<ref>{{cite web|author=Francis J.
