'''''Goldfinger''''' is the third [[film]] in the [[James Bond]] [[James Bond (films)|series]], and the third to star [[Sean Connery]] as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. The film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and was the first of four Bond films directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]. The film's plot centers around [[James Bond]] clashing with a gold-obsessed tycoon [[Auric Goldfinger]] who plans to  detonate a [[dirty bomb]] inside the [[U.S. Bullion Depository|gold depository]] at [[Fort Knox]], irradiating the gold reserves and thereby increasing the value of his private stocks.

The film is generally regarded as the first official Bond [[blockbuster]] as well as being the template for all future Bond films; it is usually credited with triggering what is known as the "James Bond craze".<ref name="making"/> The film made cinematic history when it recaptured its production costs in record-setting time, despite a budget equal to that of the two preceding films combined. ''Goldfinger'' was also the first Bond film to use a pop star to sing the theme song, which would follow for every Bond film since except ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.<ref name="making"/>

==Production==
''Goldfinger'' was the first Bond film with the budget to showcase unique technology that became a staple of the film series. ''Goldfinger'' had what was then considered a large budget of [[USD|$]]3 million dollars, and was the first James Bond film classified as a box-office [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]].<ref name="making">{{cite video | title=The Making of Goldfinger | medium=DVD | publisher=[[Metro Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] Home Entertainment Inc | date=1995 }}</ref> [[Richard Maibaum]], who had adapted two of [[Ian Fleming]]'s novels for the first two Bond films &ndash; ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' and ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia With Love]]'' &ndash; returned to adapt the [[Goldfinger (novel)|seventh James Bond novel]] for the screen, accompanied by [[Academy Award]]-winning [[screenwriter]] [[Paul Dehn]].<ref name="making"/>
[[Image:007Connery.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Sean Connery]] portrayed James Bond for the third time.]] 

[[Principal photography]] on ''Goldfinger'' commenced on [[January 20]] [[1964]] in Miami, Florida, at the Fontainebleau Hotel.<ref name="making"/> Sean Connery never traveled to the United States during filming; his entire performance was filmed in Europe &ndash; primarily at Pinewood Studios where portions of the Fontainebleau were recreated in [[April]] 1964.<ref name="making"/> Fleming visited the set of ''Goldfinger'', but he died a few months later in [[August]] 1964 shortly before it was released.<ref name="making"/>

Several scenes were filmed on location; for instance, the golf club scene was shot at Stoke Poges Golf Club in [[Buckinghamshire]] in [[May]] 1964.<ref name="making"/> The scene in which Tilly Masterson attempts to snipe Goldfinger was filmed near the [[Pilatus Aircraft]] Factory, Stans and [[Furka pass]].<ref name="making"/><ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.jlippert.net/schweiz/goldfinger/goldfinger.html | language=German | title=Auf den Spuren von James Bond: Goldfinger }}</ref> The evening car chase in which Bond uses some of the gadgetry of his Aston Martin was filmed at [[Black Park]], [[Buckinghamshire]].<ref name="making"/>

For security reasons, the filmmakers were not allowed to film inside [[Fort Knox]], though exterior photography was permitted. All sets for the interior of Fort Knox were designed and built from scratch at Pinewood Studios. A letter from the real-life controller of Fort Knox complimented Ken Adam and the production team on their imaginations.<ref name="making"/> Principal photography was completed in late [[August]] 1964.<ref name="making"/>

===Effects===
The opening credit sequence, as well as the posters for the advertising campaign, were designed by [[graphic artist]] Robert Brownjohn. Actress Margaret Nolan, who was featured in the film as Bond's masseuse at the Fontainebleau Hotel, modeled for many of the posters and was also used as the golden woman in the credit sequence.<ref name="phenom"/>

[[Production designer]] Ken Adam worked with special effects supervisor John Stears to overhaul the prototype of the [[Aston Martin DB5]] coupe for its use in the film.<ref name="making"/> Pneumatic mechanics were used to simulate machine guns hidden behind the front turn signals; smokescreen and oil dispensers were fitted behind the rear signal lights (though they had to be removed to emplace a large bulletproof shield in the rear of the vehicle); revolving number plates were fitted in the front and rear bumpers (a feature developed by the film's director); a tire-slashing apparatus that was meant to extend from a wheel depicted to have been a feature of the actual vehicle, was actually a separate rig filmed in a studio; the front passenger seat was turned into an ejector seat, operated by a compressed air mechanism that could be fired by a hidden button in the gearshift. All of these features were created and installed in the course of six weeks.<ref name="making"/>

Other features &ndash; including front and rear projecting overriders for ramming other vehicles, a weapons tray hidden beneath the driver's seat, a nail chamber fitted behind the rear signal lights to dispense clustered spikes, and a radio telephone concealed behind the driver's door paneling &ndash; were added to the DB5 but were not used in the film.<ref name="making"/>

==Plot==
In the pre-title sequence, Bond destroys a Mexican drug lord's base with plastic explosives, and defeats an assassin sent to kill him. The film's story begins in [[Miami Beach]], [[Florida]], U.S.A., with CIA agent Felix Leiter delivering to Bond a message from M to watch Auric Goldfinger. Bond foils Goldfinger's cheating at [[gin rummy]], by distracting his employee, [[Jill Masterson]], who is actually opposing Goldfinger. After foiling the scheme and forcing Goldfinger to lose, Bond and Jill consummate their new relationship in Bond's hotel suite. But when Bond fetches fresh champagne from the kitchen, he is struck unconscious by Goldfinger's Korean manservant Oddjob, while Jill is killed by epidermal suffocation with gold paint.

In London, Bond learns that his true mission is determining how Goldfinger transports gold internationally. He meets Goldfinger on a golf course where they play a high-stakes golf game. Goldfinger cheats, but Bond discovers him and switches Goldfinger's golf ball, forcing his loss. After settling the bet, Goldfinger warns Bond to stay out of his business by having Oddjob decapitate a statue with his steel-rimmed [[top hat]]. Bond implants a homing device in Goldfinger's automobile and follows him to [[Switzerland]]. Bond meets Jill's sister Tilly Masterson, who attempts to [[sniper|snipe]] Goldfinger. As she flees, Bond catches up to her and slashes two of her car's tires with a special apparatus on his Aston Martin DB5.

[[Image:007Goldfingerlaserclassic.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Goldfinger intends to kill Bond by having him cut in half by an industrial laser.]]
Bond reconnoiters Goldfinger's plant and overhears him talking to a Red Chinese agent about "Operation Grand Slam". Leaving, he encounters Tilly as she is about to make a second attempt on Goldfinger's life, but accidentally trips an alarm. During their escape, Oddjob breaks Tilly's neck with his hat. Bond attempts to leave the plant by car, but confuses a mirror image of his own vehicle as that of an enemy about to ram him, and is captured after crashing. Then, Goldfinger has him tied to a gold table underneath an industrial [[laser]], the beam of which is set to slowly slice the table in half. Bond lies to Goldfinger that another Double-O agent (who possesses the same information about Operation Grand Slam that he does) will replace him . Goldfinger realizes that he cannot take on the risk of a new, unknown agent, and will have less trouble if he convinces the Secret Service that Bond is doing well on the mission, meanwhile keeping Bond [[tranquilizer dart|tranquilized]].

Bond awakens aboard a private aircraft, piloted by Goldfinger's pilot Pussy Galore. She tells Bond that they are en route to Goldfinger's [[Kentucky]] stud farm, near [[Fort Knox]]. In flight, he activates a [[homing device]] in the heel of his left shoe; Leiter detects its signal and his allies begin tracking Bond. Upon landing, Bond is imprisoned in the stud farm, where Goldfinger meets U.S. mafiosi to obtain the material he needs for Operation Grand Slam. Bond escapes and spies on the meeting, learning that Goldfinger intends to kill the soldiers of [[Fort Knox]] with poison gas; when the discussion ends, a henchman gasses the mafiosi. Pussy Galore and other guards recapture Bond and return him to his cell. Bond and Goldfinger discuss the practical details of Operation Grand Slam; since the gold in Fort Knox would take a long time to steal, Goldfinger intends to irradiate the depository with an "[[cobalt bomb|atomic device]]" so as to render the U.S. gold supply useless for almost 60 years &ndash; and to multiply the value of his personal gold holdings.

As Operation Grand Slam begins, the women pilots of Galore's Flying Circus spray gas over Fort Knox from the air onto thousands of soldiers and civilians.<ref>Goldfinger had deceived Galore to believe that Delta-9 was an anesthetic, not a nerve gas. Bond tells her the truth about Delta-9.</ref> Earlier, however, Bond had seduced Pussy Galore, persuading her to contact the CIA, who had already substituted the poison with a harmless gas. Owing to this, the personnel of Fort Knox ingeniously act dead. Goldfinger's Chinese army destroys the depository's electrified gate with explosives, and then uses a laser as well as a stolen combination to open the vault door. Bond is then handcuffed to the atomic device and lowered into the vault. The personnel trap and destroy Goldfinger's forces who are surrounded when attempting to exit, but disguised as a US colonel, Goldfinger escapes. In the vault, Bond unlocks his handcuffs, kills Oddjob, and vainly tries to deactivate the atomic device, but an atomic specialist who accompanying Leiter does it successfully leaving seven seconds; the timer indicates "007".

With Fort Knox safe, Bond is scheduled to meet the President for a personal meeting. Bond's flight - a government [[Lockheed JetStar]] is hijacked by Goldfinger, who plans to escape to [[Cuba]]. Bond gets into a struggle with Goldfinger for the latter's revolver, which fires, shattering a window and depressurising the cabin. Bond manages to hang on, but Goldfinger is sucked through the small window by the pressure. The damage causes the plane to plunge downward. Before it crashes, however, Bond parachutes from it, rescuing Galore, and they safely land on a beach as the credits roll.

===Casting===
[[Gert Fr√∂be]] was chosen to portray the villain Auric Goldfinger because producers Saltzman and Broccoli had seen his performance as a psychopathic child molester in a German film.<ref name="making"/> Since Fr√∂be did not speak [[English language|English]], his performance was dubbed over with the voice of actor [[Michael Collins]].<ref name="making"/> [[Honor Blackman]] was selected for the female leading role of Pussy Galore partially due to her fame from her role on ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name="making"/> Concerned about censors, the film's producers thought about changing the name of the character Pussy Galore to "Kitty Galore".<ref name="phenom">{{cite video | title=The Goldfinger Phenomenon | medium=DVD | publisher=[[Metro Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] Home Entertainment Inc | date=1995 }}</ref> They kept the original name when British newspapers began to refer to Honor Blackman as "Pussy" in the lead up to production. Pussy's name is actually connected to her leadership of a circus group of cat-burglar, cat-women, Amazon lesbian acrobats (called "abrocats") in the novel, but that, among other things, did not survive to the screen adaptation.

Director Guy Hamilton had seen [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] silver medalist [[wrestler]] [[Harold Sakata]] on a wrestling program and immediately had Sakata in mind for the role of Oddjob.<ref name="making"/> [[Jack Lord]] initially was slated to reprise the Felix Leiter role, but replaced by [[Cec Linder]].

==Vehicles and gadgets==
{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}   
[[Image:Aston.db5.coupe.300pix.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Aston Martin DB5]]   
The [[Aston Martin DB5]] is Bond's first company car in the films, and is equipped with a number of Q Branch's modifications, including bulletproof front and rear wind screens, oil slick dispenser, smoke screen burner, front wing machine guns, rotating licence plates and a passenger ejector seat. Production Designer [[Ken Adam]] incorporated further exotic devices into the Aston Martin, including a mobile telephone, though the producers rejected this as too outlandish (despite that one was used on Bond's Bentley in the earlier film ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia With Love]]'').    
   
Goldfinger rides in a 1937 [[Rolls-Royce Phantom III]], famous in its own right from appearing in the film. Its licence number plate (AU 1) includes the letters "Au", the abbreviated chemical symbol for gold. The expiration sticker is for "AUG 64", another reference to gold (and the year of the film). The Tilly Masterson character drives the then-new [[Ford Mustang]] in a duel with the gadget-equipped Aston Martin.   
   
Bond is issued two homing devices by Q Branch. The first, the larger, is used by Bond to track the villain's Rolls-Royce automobile to his base. The second is the smaller and allows [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] to track Bond's whereabouts; it is hidden in the secret compartment in the heel of one shoe. 

The car-ferry airplane is an Aviation Traders [[Carvair]], an aircraft that was built for transporting automobiles and well-off passengers. Only 21 Carvairs were ever built and therefore it is relatively unknown. Modern viewers may not be surprised at this airplane, which may superficially appear from the nose-bulge to be the well-known 747. However the 747 was not conceived until 1965, and did not fly commercially until 1970. [http://home.clara.net/rod.beavon/7471.htm]   
[[Image:NASA JetStar.jpg|thumb|right|250px| A [[Lockheed JetStar]] similar in size and appearance to that used in the film]]   
   
Goldfinger's "private" jet. The first [[Lear Jet]] was still unsold when this film was released, and the [[Lockheed JetStar]] used in the movie as both Goldfinger's jet and the government's jet, was still very new, so the idea of a [[business jet]] or private jet was quite novel in 1964.   

Lasers did not exist in 1959 when the book was written, and they were a novelty in 1964 in the movie; this may be the first film appearance of the device (it is even referred to as an "industrial laser", which surely did not exist yet in 1964). The Bond set uses a scaled-up prop which visually suggests the original 1960 [[Theodore Maiman|Theodore H. Maiman]] ruby-crystal laser, complete with coiled external flashlamp (see [[laser]] for history), and the beam is red. However, in the movie the laser beam is continuous, which is never the case with the 1960 flashlamp design. Reportedly the film prop actually used a low-powered helium-neon continuous beam [[gas laser]], but the beam didn't show on the film, so it had to be added as an optical special effect. The effect on the table is simulated by a welder cutting through it from below with an [[oxyacetylene]] torch.   

Although not shown on screen, a reference is made in dialogue to the [[attache case]] Bond used in ''From Russia with Love''. While aboard Goldfinger's jet, Bond asks for it and is told it was damaged upon examination, a reference to the anti-tamper device referenced in the previous film.

==Reception==
''Goldfinger'' was originally released on [[September 17]], [[1964]], in the [[United Kingdom]], and on [[December 21]], [[1964]], in the [[United States]]. Its $3 million budget was earned back in two weeks, and it broke countless box office records in multiple countries around the world.<ref name="phenom"/> ''Goldfinger'' went on to be included in the [[Guiness Book of World Records]] as the fastest grossing film of all time.<ref name="phenom"/> The film grossed a total of $51,081,062 in the United States.<ref name="mojo">{{cite web | title=James Bond Movies | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=jamesbond.htm | work=Box Office Mojo | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | accessdate=2007-07-11 }}</ref> ''Goldfinger'' was temporarily banned in [[Israel]] due to [[Gert Fr√∂be]]'s connections with the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]]. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a [[Jewish]] family publicly thanked Fr√∂be for protecting them from persecution during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Gert Frobe - James Bond Actors | url=http://www.007james.com/actors/gert_frobe.php | publisher=007james.com | accessdate=2007-07-16 }}</ref>

At the [[1965 Academy Awards]], Norman Wanstall won the [[Academy Award for Sound Editing]] for his work on ''Goldfinger''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1184545093391 | title=Academy Awards Database - AMPAS | publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref> Composer [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Grammy Award for Best Score for a Motion Picture]].

[[Shaken, not stirred]]."), No. 53 for [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Songs|best song]] ("Goldfinger"), No. 49 for [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|best villain]] ([[Auric Goldfinger]]), and No. 71 for [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills|most thrilling film]].

''Goldfinger'' is the first James Bond film to be broadcast on [[United States|U.S.]] television &ndash; on [[September 17]] [[1972]], by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref name="abc"/> The film, however, was heavily edited by ABC: the [[gunbarrel sequence]] was cut out, scenes of violence and sexuality were trimmed down, and the scene in which Oddjob is electrocuted was almost entirely deleted.<ref name="abc">{{cite web | url=http://www.shatterhand007.com/ABCArticle/TheABCsoftheOO7Films.html | title=The ABCs of the James Bond Films | work=Dr. Shatterhand's Botanical Garden | publisher=RaftCove Productions | accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref> Nonetheless, it garnered the highest [[Nielsen Ratings]] of any film broadcast on television at that time: 49 percent of all viewers. It was recently announced that ''Goldfinger'' would be theatrically re-released in the UK on [[27 July]] [[2007]], distributed by Park Circus Films on new digital prints distributed to approximately 150 multiplex cinemas.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=Cinema Retro | url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/100-00-HEAVEN-DIGITAL-GOLDFINGER-REISSUE-IN-UK-THEATERS.html | title=00-HEAVEN: DIGITAL GOLDFINGER REISSUE IN UK THEATERS | accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher=Park Circus Films | accessdate=2007-07-13 | url=http://www.parkcircus.com/releases/goldfinger/index.html | title=Goldfinger }}</ref>

''Goldfinger'''s popularity led to the inception of a massive [[tie-in]] marketing campaign that spawned a diverse [[Product lining|product line]] including clothing, [[dress shoe]]s, [[action figure]]s, [[board game]]s, [[jigsaw puzzle]]s, [[lunch box]]es, [[trading card]]s, [[slot car]]s, and collectible [[Casting|die-cast]] toy reproductions of the Aston Martin DB5.<ref name="phenom"/> Parodies of James Bond appeared in the form of "secret agent" comics, television programs, and a spoof of Ian Fleming's [[Casino Royale (novel)|first bond novel]] ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' in [[1967]]. The rest of Fleming's Bond novels also gained popularity as a result of the success of ''Goldfinger''.<ref name="phenom"/>

The U.S. television program ''[[MythBusters]]'' aired an episode regarding the scenario of explosive depressurisation in a plane at high altitudes. Their investigation produced the finding that a sudden depressurisation as depicted in the film would not occur.<ref>{{cite episode | title=Explosive Decompression, Frog Giggin', Rear Axle | series=MythBusters | serieslink=MythBusters | airdate=January 18, 2004 | season=1 | number=10 }}</ref> ''Mythbusters'' also twice investigated if death could be caused by full body painting, as was depicted in the film. While this was proved to be possible &ndash; likely due to [[heat stroke]] and not epidermal suffocation as depicted in the film &ndash; it was found that such a death would be very slow, unlike in the film.<ref>{{cite episode | title=Larry‚Äôs Lawn Chair Balloon, Poppy Seed Drug Test, Goldfinger | series=MythBusters | serieslink=MythBusters | number=3 | airdate=March 7, 2003 }}</ref><ref>{{cite episode | title=Myths Revisited | series=MythBusters | serieslink=MythBusters | season=2 | number=14 | airdate=June 8, 2004 }}</ref>

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Goldfinger (soundtrack)}}
[[Shirley Bassey]] sang the theme song "[[Goldfinger (song)|Goldfinger]]", and she would go on to sing the theme songs for two other Bond films as well. The song was composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], with lyrics by [[Anthony Newley]] and [[Leslie Bricusse]]. Newley originally sang the song, but Bassey's recording was used in the film and was featured on the soundtrack. Newley's version was released in the 30th anniversary compilation album ''[[The Best of Bond...James Bond]]''. The theme was an international [[hit single]], achieving a spot in the [[Billboard Hot 100]] top five. The album went [[gold album|gold]], literally, selling over a million copies in the United States alone; it reached #21 in the UK charts.<ref name="phenom"/> The film score was composed by John Barry, and he included the "James Bond Theme", also known as "007".
