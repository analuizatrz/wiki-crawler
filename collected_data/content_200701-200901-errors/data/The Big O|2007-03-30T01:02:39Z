{{nihongo|'''''The Big O'''''|THE ビッグオー|Za Biggu Ō}} is an [[anime]] [[TV series]] produced by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise, Inc.]] It was directed by Kazuyoshi Katayama (animation director, ''[[Giant Robo#The OVA Series|Giant Robo]]''), with character and mecha designs by [[Keiichi Sato]] (original concept, ''[[Karas (anime)|Karas]]''), and script by [[Chiaki J. Konaka]] (''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]'', ''[[Armitage III]]'').

Forty years prior to the events of the series, a mysterious occurrence caused the residents of Paradigm City to lose their memories. The series follows Roger Smith, Paradigm City's top [[Negotiator]]. He provides this much needed service with the help of an [[android]] named R. Dorothy Wayneright and his [[butler]] Norman Burg. When the need arises, Roger calls upon The Big O, a giant [[relic]] from the city's history that may hold the key to its future. 

The series premiered on [[October 13]], [[1999]] on [[WOWOW|WOWOW satellite television.]] It finished its run on [[January 19]], [[2000]]. The [[English-language]] version premiered on the [[Cartoon Network|American Cartoon Network]] on [[April 2]], [[2001]]. Originally a thirteen-episode series, positive fan response internationally resulted in a second season co-produced by Cartoon Network, Sunrise, and [[Bandai Visual]]. Season two premiered on Japan's [[SUN-TV]] on January 2003, with the American [[premiere]] taking place seven months later.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of The Big O media}}
''The Big O'''s main theme is the nature of [[memory|memories]]. A memory is a record of a thing or an event stored in the brain of an organism. But in Paradigm City, the "City of [[Amnesia]]", memories are much more. Memories are a precious thing and "can appear when you least expect them."<ref>'''Roger Smith''' (voice-over): This place, Paradigm City, is a town of forgetfulness. One day forty years ago, every person here lost all memory of everything which had occurred before that day. But humans are adaptable creatures, they make do and go on with life. If they're smart enough to figure out how to operate machinery and get electricity, they can still have something of civilization even without a history. People ''can'' survive without knowing what did or didn't happen in the past. And each day they try their hardest to do just that. The only ones who regret the loss of these memories are the city's elderly. But memories, like nightmares, sometimes come when you least expect them. (Act:01)</ref> Memories embody the lost knowledge of its citizens. Memories can take the form of records from before the Event, or forgotten artifacts of times gone by.<ref>'''Schwarzwald''': Forty years ago, something happened, and we all lost our memory! We even forgot the untold power we once possessed! // '''Roger Smith''' (about a megadeus archetype): You call this power? // '''Schwarzwald''': A Megadeus was nothing special, Negotiator. I could possess power like that if I could only regain those Memories. (Act:04)</ref> Memories can manifest themselves as mere [[recollection]], [[hallucinations]] or a [[recurring dream]].<ref name = "Winter Night Phantom">'''Dan Dastun''' (over scenes from a black-and white movie): I don't remember when I first saw it, but I know that the dream is based on a scene from an old movie I watched when I was a kid. It's bone-chilling cold as snow falls softly onto a winter sea. The woman is shot. Presumably by the man she loves. // '''Roger Smith''': "''Vous etes si gentil''"? // '''Dastun''': Sounds like a language from some other country, probably where the movie was made. (Act:10, "[[Winter Night Phantom]]")</ref>

Season one is [[Episode|episodic]], each Act presents how different citizens of Paradigm deal with the resurgence of these Memories and how they manage to go on living without knowledge of what did or did not happen. The season ends by introducing elements that will come into play during season two: the existence of people outside of Paradigm City, the book "Metropolis" written by Gordon Rosewater, the [[Cataclysm]] that destroyed the world and the "Power of God wielded by the hand of man."

Season two takes a more [[Story arc|arc-based approach]]. Instead of self-contained stories like in season one, season two features a continuous storyline. This season makes [[List of The Big O characters#Alex Rosewater|Alex Rosewater]], [[CEO]] of the Paradigm Corporation, a direct [[antagonist]] to The Negotiator and introduces The Union, agents of a foreign power working within Paradigm.

==Characters and setting==
{{main article|Paradigm City}}
[[Image:Paradigm City.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Aerial shot]] of Paradigm City]]
Forty years before the series, [[disaster]] struck. The world was turned into a vast desert wasteland and the survivors were left without [[memories]]. In the aftermath, a new city was established: '''Paradigm City'''. The city shares its name with the Paradigm Corporation, the firm that runs the city. From the bread store down the block to the [[police force]] that protects the [[citizens]], everyone's on the company's payroll. In Paradigm City, the firm is "[[Cuius regio, eius religio|both God and State]]."<ref>'''Thug''': Negotiator... // '''Roger Smith''': My work here is done. // '''Thug''': This is about a ''new'' job. I hear my parent company is interested in hiring you. // '''Roger''': Your ''parent'' company? // '''Roger''' (voice-over): Whether you're a bread store or a real estate agency, or even the Military Police for that matter, it doesn't make a bit of difference. When you say "parent company", it always means the same place. In this city, the firm called Paradigm is considered both God and State. (Act:04)</ref> Paradigm City's most notable feature is the giant [[domes]] that house its richer citizens, while the poor are left to their luck outside the domes.

A number of clues as to the nature of the disaster appear through the series. First and foremost are the ''[[megadeuses]]'' [''sic''], giants from the previous era. There's a [[subway system]] from before the disaster, but it's never been used out of fear; below it, there are newer better-kept facilities.<ref>'''Roger Smith''' (voice-over): I've been using these underground tunnels in order to transport Big O. I understand there was once a transportation system at one time, called a "subway." It may only be thirty feet below the surface, but no one wants to set foot down here, not even bank robbers. Big Ear once told me that forty years ago, there were people who lived down here. Some wanted to, some had no choice. Even I haven't gone down any further than this. This is probably another world that no one in the city knows about. Except for one man. The further down I go, the newer the walls become. Items from a more recent era are buried deeper down. (Act:04)</ref> There's a small [[android]] community, but pets are extremely rare.<ref>'''R. Dorothy Wayneright''' (about a cat): He had been abandoned and left in the rain. // '''Roger Smith''': No, that can't be right. You weren't the one who put that collar on him, were you? Cats are rare creatures. In one sense, you could say they're worth more than you and I. I doubt someone would abandon one. (Act:08, "[[Missing Cat]]")</ref> There are [[German people|Germans]] and [[German language|German]]-speakers, but the [[French language]] is foreign, and largely unknown.<ref name = "Winter Night Phantom"/> 

Paradigm City has been linked to other fictional, and real, cities. Keiichi Sato used [[DC Comics]]' [[Gotham City]] as inspiration for the world of ''The Big O''.<ref name="hero"/> The [[class conflict]] of [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]'', and "The Mediator", are referenced.<ref name = "jump"/> While not technically a city, [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Caves of Steel]]'' serves as inspiration for Paradigm's android community and domes,<ref name ="vision"/> and its contour resembles [[Manhattan]].<ref>''The Big O Visual'': Official Companion to "The Big-O" TV series (ISBN 4-57-529579-5), p. 39.</ref>

===Characters===
{{main article|Characters of The Big O}}
[[Image:Roger Smith (Big O).JPG|left|thumb|125px|The Negotiator]]
'''Roger Smith''' is the series [[protagonist]]. He is the [[Negotiator]]. His job entails finding a resolution for the troubles of the City of Amnesia. He'd negotiate anything for anyone, but he is a professional and expects the parts to behave professionally. When memories betray the people and force them to reawaken monstrosities of the city's past, Roger's only option is to fight back with a monstrosity of his own, the black [[megadeus]] '''Big O'''. 

{{anime voices|Mitsuru Miyamoto|Steven Blum}}

[[Image:R. Dorothy (Big O).JPG|right|thumb|125px|The Android]]
'''R. Dorothy Wayneright''' is Roger's [[assistant]]. Introduced in Act:01 as Dorothy Soldano, daughter of rich scientist Miguel Soldano, she is later revealed to be an [[android]] constructed by him. Her actual "father" would be Timothy Wayneright, the man who commissioned her construction and father of the ''real'' Dorothy Wayneright. To show her gratitude, and as a form of payment for Roger's help, she decides to move in with him and help out Norman with the chores.

{{anime voices|Akiko Yajima|Lia Sargent}}

[[Image:Norman Burg (Big O).JPG|left|125px|thumb|The Butler]]
'''Norman Burg''' is Roger's [[butler]]. Forty years before the commencement of the story he, along with all of Paradigm, lost all memories, but he would not think twice before going once more unto the breach for his master. Resourceful and talented, he is also [[caretaker]] of the Big O. Norman's skills give him a purpose and a mission to accomplish for Roger.

''Voiced by'': [[Motomu Kiyokawa]] (Japanese), [[Milton James]] (English) in season one, [[Alan Oppenheimer]] (English) in season two

[[Image:Dan Dastun (Big O).JPG|right|thumb|125px|The Officer]]
'''Dan Dastun''' is the [[middle-aged]] Chief of the Military Police, introduced in Act:01. He is Roger's former commander, but they still maintain contact with each other. Dastun resents the opinion some have of his job, calling him a "[[lapdog]]" of the Paradigm Corporation, but is proud of what he does. No matter how big the threat, the Military Police are needed in Paradigm.

{{anime voices|Tesshou Genda|Peter Lurie}}

[[Image:Angel (Big O).JPG|left|thumb|125px|The Enigma]]
'''Angel''' is the beautiful woman Roger encounters throughout the series. Introduced in Act:03 as Casey Jenkins, investigator for Paradigm Power Management, then again in Act:04 as Patricia Lovejoy, secretary for the publisher of Paradigm Press. Angel's true identity is a mystery, her motives questionable and her allegiance to no one but herself.

==Development and design==
Development of the [[retro]]-styled series began in 1996. Keiichi Sato came up with the concept of ''The Big O'':<ref name="hero">{{cite web | url = http://www.japanhero.com/big_o_interview.htm | title = Birth of the Big O | accessdate = 2006-11-18 | last = Hayward | first = Keith | publisher = Japan Hero}}</ref> a giant city-smashing robot, piloted by a man in black, in a [[Gotham City|Gotham]]-like environment.{{Ref_label|A|α|none}} He later met up with Kazuyoshi Katayama, who had just finished directing ''[[Those Who Hunt Elves]]'', and started work on the layouts and character designs. But when things "were about to really start moving", production on Katayama's ''[[Sentimental Journey (anime)|Sentimental Journey]]'' began, putting plans on-hold. Sato was also heavily involved with his work on ''[[City Hunter]]''.

[[Image:The Big O (concept art).jpg|thumb|right|'''The Big O''' concept art]]
Sato admits it all started as "a gimmick for a toy." They tried including detachable hands, a cargo container and a vehicle with a ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''-style design.<ref name="hero"/> But the representatives at Bandai Hobby Division did not see the same [[toyetic|potential]]. From there on, the dealings would be with [[Bandai Visual]]. But [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] still needed some safeguards and requested more robots be designed to increase toy sales.

In 1999, with the designs complete, [[Chiaki J. Konaka]] was brought on as head writer. Konaka came up with the concept of a "town without memory", and worked on the [[characterization]] of R. Dorothy. Konaka and his writing staff scripted a 26-episodes series. The series premiered on [[October 13]], [[1999]] on [[WOWOW]]. When the production staff was informed the series would be shortened to thirteen episodes, the writers decided to end it with a [[cliffhanger]], hoping the next 13 episodes would be picked up.<ref name="konaka">{{cite web | url = http://www.konaka.com/alice6/big-o/ | title = ''The Big O'' (production notes) | accessdate = 2006-11-18 | author = Chiaki J. Konaka | language = Japanese }} A translation can be found at the [http://www.freewebs.com/seebach/#writers Season 3 FAQ]</ref> In 2001, ''The Big O'' premiered on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Toonami]] lineup.

'''Season Two'''

The series garnered positive fan response internationally, and the American fanbase asked for more.<ref name="konaka"/> This resulted in a second season co-produced by Cartoon Network, Sunrise, and Bandai Visual. Season two premiered on Japan's [[SUN-TV]] on January 2003, with the American premiere taking place seven months later in the '''[[adult swim]]''' lineup.<ref name = "comiccon">{{cite web | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-08-04/comic-con-adult-swim | title = Comic-con Adult Swim News | date = 2002-08-04 | accessdate = 2006-11-18 | publisher = Anime News Network}}</ref> All the scripts from season two were written by Konaka.

Along with the 13-episodes of season two, Cartoon Network had an [[Option (films)|option]] for 26 additional episodes.<ref name="moreBigO">{{cite web | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-06-09/more-big-o | title = More Big O | accessdate = 2006-12-03 | date = 2003-06-09 | publisher = Anime News Network}}</ref> But Jason DeMarco, executive producer for season two, does not think it can happen. The middling ratings and DVD sales in the United States and Japan have made it impossible, though Chiaki Konaka has gone on record as to having an idea for a third season.<ref name = "askAS">{{cite web | url = http://www.adultswim.com/williams/askas/kim.html | title = Ask Kim Manning -- And what is up with ''Big O'' Season 3?| accessdate = 2006-12-03 | publisher = '''adult swim'''}}</ref>

===Style===
[[Image:Shadowcasting (Big O).JPG|thumb|250px|The shadows of [[Venetian blinds]] cast upon the hero, a signature visual of ''film noir'']]
''The Big O'' shares much of its visual iconography with the ''films noir'' of the 1940's.{{Ref_label|Β|β|none}}<ref name="animeAU">{{cite web |url = http://www.anime.org.au/main/staticpages/index.php?page=20040918172616306 | accessdate = 2006-11-04 |title = The Big O | publisher = anime and manga for Australia }}</ref> The series makes use of ''noir''-standards such as [[chiaroscuro]] lighting, used by cinematographers to create tension, and [[low-angle shot]]s, giving the impression of larger-than-life characters.<ref>Silver, Alain (2004). ''Film Noir''. Tashen Books. ISBN 3-8228-2261-2</ref> The series protagonist, originally envisioned as a [[Private investigator|private eye]],<ref name = "AnimePlay"/> is canny and cynical,<ref name = "jump"/> a disillusioned cop-turned-[[negotiator]] whose job has more in common with detective-style work than straight-forward negotiating.<ref name = "academy"/>

''Films noir'' are often set in urban environments, like [[New York City]] or [[L.A.]] ''The Big O'''s gritty backdrop goes by the name of [[Paradigm]]. The [[dome]]d city achieves a sense of [[claustrophobia]],<ref name="onDVD1"/> or [[paranoia]], attained only by camera tricks in the classic ''noirs''.<ref name ="vision"/> [[Bar (establishment)|Bars]], lounges, and [[nightclubs]], [[factories]], and [[power plants]] are some of the locales associated with [[detective fiction]] present in this anime series.<ref name = "influences">{{cite web |url = http://www.animeland.com/index.php?rub=articles&id=198 | accessdate = 2006-12-16 |title = The Big O, un animé sous influence | last = Penedo | first = Nicolas |publisher = AnimeLand }} {{fr icon}}</ref>

[[Amnesia]] is a common [[plot device]] in ''film noir'', far more common than in real life.<ref name="holiday">{{cite web |url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9B05EEDF1630F931A35752C1A9659C8B63|accessdate = 2006-11-04 |title = "The Last Word in Alienation: I Just Don't Remember" | last = Rafferty | first = Terrence | date = [[2003-11-02]] |publisher = nytimes.com }}</ref> Because most of these stories focused on a character proving his innocence, authors up the ante by making him an amnesiac -- unable to even prove his innocence to himself. ''The Big O'' does one better: "one day 40 years ago, everyone here lost their memory of everything before that day." To explore the mystery, ''The Big O'' employs the ''noir'' tools-of-the-trade. The series features [[voice-over]] narration, the use of [[flashback]]s, and a convoluted storyline.{{Ref_label|Γ|γ|none}}

The jazzy soundtrack owes to the ''noir'' style, even if [[jazz]] was not always used in ''noir'' films.<ref name="jazznoir">{{cite web |url = http://www.sfjazz.org/news/2006/2006_may_17.html | accessdate = 2006-11-04 |title = Interview with Eddie Muller | date = 2006-05-17 | publisher = SFJAZZ }}</ref> The Negotiator driving around the smoke-filled streets of Paradigm while the slow jazz tune of "Roger's Theme" ({{audio|Roger's Theme (Big O).ogg|sample}}) plays in the background is the quintessential ''Big O'' moment. On his way, Roger Smith meets a number of [[hard-boiled]] [[archetype]]s: '''Big Ear''', the helpful informant; '''Jason Beck''', the thug with delusions of grandeur; Dan Dastun, the friend on the police force; and Angel, the ''[[femme fatale]]''. Other staples of [[pulp magazines|pulp fiction]] also show up: crooked cops, corrupt business men and deranged scientists.

===Influences===
{{Further|[[List of allusions in The Big O]]}}

One of ''The Big O'''s most commented upon influences is [[Batman]].<ref name = "AnimePlay"/><ref name="ANNpreview"/><ref name = "influences"/> [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]], the series' production studio, was a subcontractor for [[Warner Bros. Animation]]'s ''Batman: The Animated Series'',<ref>For detail on which episodes Sunrise worked on, see [http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/crewcredits/animation.php The World's Finest].</ref> and [[Toonami]] promos acknowledged the Dark Knight's influence on Roger Smith.<ref>For the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' promo [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOjTnNTB-zc "Like a Shadow"], Toonami used the tagline "Good guys wear black." ''The Big O'' promo was named [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4CugvCNi0g "Good Guys Still Wear Black"] as a reference to [[Batman]]. You can download them both at [http://www.toonamiarsenal.com/ Toonami Digital Arsenal].</ref>

[[Roger Smith (The Big O)|Roger Smith]] is a [[pastiche]] of the [[Bruce Wayne]] [[persona]] and the Dark Knight Batman. His character design is pure Wayne, complete with slicked-back hair and double-breasted business suit. Like Bruce, Roger prides himself in being a rich playboy to the extent that one of his household's rules is only women may be let into his mansion without his permission.<ref>'''Roger Smith''' (meeting Dorothy): I have a special house rule that only lovely young women can unconditionally enter this mansion. Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Roger Smith How may I be of service, Miss... // '''Roger''' (Dorothy turns to face him): What's going? You're Miss Wayneright? // '''R. Dorothy Wayneright''': How do you do? // '''Roger''': Norman must be senile. How else could he confuse an android for a woman? // '''Dorothy''': You couldn't tell the difference at first, either. // '''Roger''': It was dark! I couldn't see in that dump! (Act:01)</ref> Like Batman, Roger Smith carries a no-gun policy, albeit more flexible. Unlike the personal motives of the Batman, Roger enforces this rule for "it's all part of being a gentleman."<ref>'''Angel''' (hands Roger a gun): Try this! // '''Roger Smith''' (under heavy-fire): Goes against my principles... but I don't have a choice! // '''Angel''' (after Roger shoots the water pipes behind the soldiers): So no matter what, you won't shoot people? // '''Roger''': It's all part of being a gentleman. (Act:08, "[[Missing Cat]]")</ref> Among Roger's gadgetry is the Griffon, a large, black hi-tech [[sedan]] comparable to the [[Batmobile]], and a grappling cable that shoots out his wristwatch. In Act:15, Angel refers to The Big O as Roger's [[alter-ego]].

''The Big O'''s cast of [[supporting character]]s features: [[List of The Big O characters#Norman Burg|Norman]], Roger's faithful mechanically-inclined butler who fills the role of [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; [[List of the Big O characters#R.

Like Giant Robo, the ''[[megadeuses]]'' of Big O are metal behemoths. The designs are strange and "more macho than practical,"<ref name = "theEX"/> sporting big stovepipe arms and exposed rivets.

The first season received high marks all over. Anime on DVD recommends it as an essential series.<ref name = "essential"/> Chris Beveridge of the aforementioned site gave an A- to Vols. 1 and 2, and a B+ to Vols. 3 and 4.<ref name = "critics">{{cite web | url = http://animecritic.com/_metareview/viewtitle.php?aid=762 | title = ''The Big-O'' (Meta Review) | accessdate = 2006-11-11 | publisher = Meta Anime Review Project}}</ref> The review at the Anime Academy gave it a grade of 83, listing the series high points being "unique", the "interesting characters" and the "nice action."<ref name = "academy"/> Mike Toole of Anime Jump, who gave it a 4.5 (out of a possible 5) stars writes "''The Big O'' is a thoroughly excellent series."<ref name = "jump" /> Reviewers,<ref name = "jump"/><ref name="onDVD4">{{cite web |url = http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/160.php |accessdate = 2006-11-11 |title = Anime on DVD Reviews: ''The Big O'' Vol. #4 | last = Beveridge | first = Chris | date = 2001-12-18 | publisher = Anime on DVD }}</ref><ref name="essential"/> and fans alike,<ref name = "konaka"/><ref name = "comiccon"/> agree the season's downfall was the ending, or its lack thereof. The dangling plot threads frustrated the viewers and prompted Cartoon Network's involvement in the production of further episodes.<ref name = "comiccon"/>

The look and feel of the show received a big enhacement in the second season.<ref name="onDVDII1">{{cite web |url = http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/2560.php |accessdate = 2006-11-11 |title = Anime on DVD Reviews: ''The Big O'' II Vol. #1 | last = Beveridge | first = Chris | date = 2003-11-03 | publisher = Anime on DVD }}</ref> This time around, the animation is "near [[OVA]] quality"<ref name="ANN-II-DVD-1">{{cite web |url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/the-big-o-ii/dvd-1 |accessdate = 2006-11-11 |title = ''The Big O II'' DVD 1: Paradigm Lost | last = Divers | first = Allen | date = 2004-01-20 | publisher = [[Anime News Network]] }}</ref> and the artwork "far more lush and detailed."<ref name="verdict-II-1"/> Also enhanced are the troubles of the first season.

For some reviewers, the second season "doesn't quite match the first"<ref name = "IGN-DVD4">{{cite web | url = http://dvd.ign.com/articles/526/526444p1.html | title = ''The Big O II'' - Aggressive Negotiations Review | accessdate = 2006-11-11 | last = Patrizio | first = Andy | date = 2004-06-25 | publisher = IGN.com}}</ref> addressing to "something" missing in these episodes.<ref name = "TAR"/> Andy Patrizio of IGN.com points out changes in Roger Smith's character, who "lost some of his cool and his very funny side in the second season." Like a repeat of season one, this season's ending is considered its downfall.<ref name = "herorevII">{{cite web | url = http://www.japanhero.com/super%20robot%20reviews/big_O_II.htm | title = Super Robot Reviews: The Big O II: 2nd Season | accessdate = 2006-11-11 | publisher = Japan Hero}}</ref><ref name="onDVDII4"/> Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD wonders if this was head writer "Konaka's attempt to throw his hat into the ring for creating one of the most confusing and oblique endings of any series." Patrizio states "the creators watched ''[[The Truman Show]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]'' a few times too many." The reviewer at Japan Hero does not think the payoff was worth it, writing "the audience had been waiting on pins and needles for so long, and practically every episode upped the tension and suspense at least a little bit, if not a whole lot, and then we come to the big IT-moment, and... well, there it is. For me, it was honestly a little of a disappointment."
