The '''Xian MA60''' (新舟60, ''Xīnzhōu 60'', "'''M'''odern '''A'''rk 60") is a [[turboprop]]-powered [[airliner]] made by China's [[Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation]] under the [[AVIC I|China Aviation Industry Corporation I]] (AVIC I).  The MA60 is a stretched version of the Xi'an Y7-200A and a close copy of the [[An-26]] cargo plane.  The plane was first tested in [[1993 in aviation|1993]], and given its airworthiness  certificate in [[1998 in aviation|1998]] from the Civil Aviation Administration of China.  A year later, two MA60s were put into operation by [[Chang'an Airlines]].
