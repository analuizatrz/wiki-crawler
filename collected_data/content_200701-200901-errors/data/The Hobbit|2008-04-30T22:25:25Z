While ''The Hobbit'' stands as a novel in its own right, it is also the precursor to Tolkien's second, longer saga ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. ''The Hobbit'' has been reprinted and adapted many times since its first edition.

==Characters==

*[[Bilbo Baggins]], the titular protagonist, a respectable, comfort-loving, middle-aged [[hobbit]]
*[[Gandalf]], an [[Wiktionary:itinerant|itinerant]] [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] who introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]], later disappearing and reappearing at key points in the story
*[[Thorin Oakenshield]], [[Wiktionary:bombastic|bombastic]] head of the company of dwarves and heir to a dwarven kingdom under the [[Lonely Mountain]]
*[[Smaug]], a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarven kingdom of Thorin's grandfather
The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance, such as the twelve other dwarves of the company; [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elves]]; [[Man (Middle-earth)|men]] (humans); [[Troll (Middle-earth)|trolls]]; [[Orc (Middle-earth)|goblins]]; giant spiders; [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagles]]; [[Warg]]s (evil wolves); [[Elrond]] the sage; [[Gollum]], a mysterious creature inhabiting an underground lake; [[Beorn]], a man who can assume bear-form; and [[Bard the Bowman]], a heroic archer of [[Esgaroth|Lake-town]].

==Synopsis==
Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a party for Thorin's band of dwarves, who sing of reclaiming the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragon]] Smaug. When the music ends, Gandalf unveils a map showing a [[secret passage|secret door]] into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition's "burglar." The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, joins despite himself.

The group travel into the wild, where Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to [[Rivendell]]. While there, Elrond reveals more secrets from the map. Passing over the [[Misty Mountains]], they are caught by goblins and driven deep underground. Though Gandalf rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblin tunnels. Lost and disoriented, he stumbles across a [[one ring|ring]] and then encounters Gollum, who engages him in a game of [[riddles]] with deadly stakes. With the help of the ring (which confers [[invisibility]]), Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, raising his reputation. The goblins and Wargs give chase and the company are saved by eagles before resting in the house of the shape-shifter [[Beorn]]. 

The company enter the black forest of [[Mirkwood]] without Gandalf. In Mirkwood, Bilbo first saves the dwarves from [[Giant Spider]]s and then from the dungeons of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]]. Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the travelers are welcomed by the human inhabitants of Lake-town, who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug's demise. The expedition travel to the Mountain and finds the secret door; Bilbo scouts the dragon's lair, stealing a great cup and learning of a weakness in Smaug's armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town aided the intruder, sets out to destroy the town. A noble [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] who overheard Bilbo's report of Smaug's vulnerability reports it to Bard the Bowman, who slays the Dragon.

When the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the prized [[Arkenstone]] gem and steals it. The Wood-elves and Lake-men besiege the Mountain and request compensation for their aid, reparations for Lake-town's destruction, and settlement of old claims on the treasure. Thorin refuses and, having summoned his kin from the north, reinforces his position. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to head off a war, but Thorin is intransigent. He banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable.

Gandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men, and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. Thorin, mortally wounded, lives long enough to part from Bilbo as a friend. The treasure is divided fairly, but, having no need or desire for it, Bilbo refuses most of his contracted share. Nevertheless, he returns home with enough to make himself a very wealthy hobbit.

==Concept and creation==
===Writing===
In a [[1955]] letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien recollects that in the early 1930s, when he was Professor of Anglo-Saxon at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]], he began ''The Hobbit'' when he was marking School Certificate papers. He found one blank page. Suddenly inspired, he wrote the words, "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit." He did not go any further than that at the time, although in the following years he drew up [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#Thrór|Thrór's]] map, outlining the geography of the tale.<ref>{{ME-ref|Letters|#163}}</ref> By late 1932 he had finished the story and gave it to [[C. S. Lewis]] to read.<ref>{{ME-ref|Bio|p. 181}}</ref> It was eventually published when a family friend and student of Tolkien's named Elaine Griffiths was lent the typescript of the story.<ref name="Letter294">{{ME-ref|Letters|#294}}</ref> In [[1936]], when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staffmember of the publisher [[Allen & Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]], she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book<ref name="Letter294" /> or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien.<ref name="Biop184">{{ME-ref|Bio|p. 184}}</ref> In any event, Miss Dagnall, impressed by it, showed the book to [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], who then asked his 10-year-old son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] to review it. Rayner wrote such an enthusiastic review of the book that it was published by Allen & Unwin.<ref name="Biop184" />

=== Publication ===
[[Image:Hobbit cover.JPG|right|200px|thumb|200px|Dustcover of the first edition of ''The Hobbit''. This cover was taken from a design by Tolkien, as was the binding illustrated at the top of this article.]]
George Allen & Unwin, Ltd. of London published the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' on [[21 September]] [[1937]]. It was illustrated with many black-and-white drawings by Tolkien. The original printing numbered a mere 1,500 copies and sold out by December due to enthusiastic reviews.<ref name="hammond-anderson">{{cite book | last=Hammond | first=Wayne | coauthors=Douglas A.

Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography | publisher=[[Oak Knoll Press]] | location=New Castle, Delaware | year=1993 | isbn=0-938768-42-5 | pages=15,18,21,48,54}}</ref> [[Houghton Mifflin]] of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and [[New York, New York|New York]] prepared an American edition to be released early in [[1938]] in which four of the illustrations would be colour plates. Allen & Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937.<ref name="hammond-anderson"/> Despite the book's popularity, [[rationing|paper rationing]] brought on by [[World War II|wartime]] conditions and not ending until 1949 meant that the book was often unavailable in this period.<ref>Anderson, Douglas A., ed.''The Annotated Hobbit''. Revised Edition. Harper Collins. London, 2003. ISBN 0-00-713726-3. pp. 22</ref>

The first printing of the first English language edition can sell for between £6,000<ref>''The Hobbit sells for £6,000'', bbc.co.uk, 26/11/04[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/4045667.stm]</ref>  and £20,000 at auction,<ref>Walne, Toby.

Following the original publication of ''The Hobbit'' in 1937, new [[Edition (books)|editions]] in English were published in 1951, 1966, 1978 and 1995 and the novel has been [[English-language editions of The Hobbit | reprinted frequently by various publishers]].<ref>Anderson, Douglas A., ed.''The Annotated Hobbit''. Revised Edition. Harper Collins. London, 2003. ISBN 0-00-713726-3. pp. 384-386</ref> In addition, ''The Hobbit'' has been [[Translations of The Hobbit|translated into over forty languages]]. Some languages have seen multiple translations.<ref> Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' p. 23</ref>

====Revisions====
In December 1937, Tolkien's publisher Stanley Unwin asked for a sequel. The editors rejected Tolkien's drafts for the ''[[Silmarillion]]'', believing that the public wanted "more about hobbits."<ref name="carpenter-tolkien"/> Tolkien subsequently began work on what would become ''[[The Lord of the Rings]],''<ref name="carpenter-tolkien"/> a course that would not only change the context of the original story, but also lead to substantial changes to the character Gollum.

In the first edition of ''The Hobbit'', Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle-game, and he and Bilbo part amicably.<ref>Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' (1988)</ref> In order to reflect the new concept of the [[One Ring|ring]] and its powerful hold on Gollum, Tolkien rewrote the encounter with Gollum and sent a revised version to his publishers. He heard nothing further for years. When he was sent [[galley proof]]s of a new edition, he  was surprised to learn the new chapter had been incorporated as the result of a misunderstanding.<ref name="carpenter-tolkien">{{cite book | last=Carpenter | first=Humphrey | authorlink=Humphrey Carpenter | title=J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography | publisher=[[George Allen & Unwin]] | location=London | year=1977 | oclc=3046822}}</ref> In ''The Lord of the Rings'', the original version of the riddle-game is explained as a "lie" made up by Bilbo, and the revised versions of ''The Hobbit'' contain this "true" version of events.<ref name = "prologue">{{ME-ref|fotr|Prologue}}</ref> This became the second edition, published in 1951 in both the UK and America.<ref name="hammond-anderson"/>

After an unauthorized paperback edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' was published by [[Ace Books]] in 1965, Houghton Mifflin and [[Ballantine Books|Ballantine]] requested Tolkien provide a new authorized text of ''The Hobbit'' in order to re-assert US copyright control.<ref>Rateliff, John D ''The History of the Hobbit. Part 2: Return to Bag-End'' p765</ref> This text became the [[1966]] third edition.  Tolkien took the opportunity to further adjust the narrative to conform with ''The Lord of the Rings'' and to developments in his still unpublished ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'' as it stood at that time.<ref>Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' (1988), Flies and Spiders, note 23</ref>  These minor changes included, for example, that the phrase ''elves that are now called [[Gnome]]s'', which appeared in the first<ref name="Hobbit first edition">{{cite book | last=Tolkien | first= J. R. R. | title=The Hobbit | publisher=George Allen & Unwin | location=London | year=1937 | pages=63}}</ref> and second<ref name="Hobbit second edition">{{cite book | last=Tolkien | first=J. R. R. | title=The Hobbit | publisher=George Allen & Unwin | location=London | year=1951 | pages= 63}}</ref> editions on page 63, was changed to ''High Elves of the West, my kin'' in the third edition.<ref name="Hobbit third edition">{{cite book | last=Tolkien | first= J. R. R. | title=The Hobbit | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | location=Boston | year=1966 | pages=62 | ISBN=0-395-07122-4}}</ref>. Tolkien had used "gnome" in his earlier writing to refer to the second kindred of the [[High Elves]]&mdash;the [[Noldor]] (or "Deep Elves")&mdash;thinking "gnome," derived from the Greek ''gnosis'' (knowledge), was a good name for the wisest of the Elves. However, with its common denotation of a [[garden gnome]], Tolkien ultimately decided to abandon the usage.

In order to make a better tonal fit with its sequel, Tolkien began a new version in 1966, removing the narrative asides. The revision was abandoned at chapter three after Tolkien received criticism that it "just wasn't ''The Hobbit''."<ref>Rateliff, John D. ''The History of the Hobbit. Part 2: Return to Bag End.'' p781</ref>

In May and June 2007, [[HarperCollins]] and Houghton Mifflin published ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'' in the United Kingdom. The work examines, in two volumes, previously unpublished original drafts of ''The Hobbit'' with extensive commentary by John Rateliff.

==Style==
The basic form of the story is that of a [[quest]],<ref>W. H. Auden, "The Quest Hero," in Rose A. Zimbardo and Neil D. Isaaca, eds., ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism''. Houghton Mifflin Company. Boston, 2004. 31-51. ISBN 0-618-42251-x.</ref> told in [[episode]]s, a traditional narrative form far removed from the literary movements of the twentieth century.<ref name="Poveda"/>  The general tone is lighthearted, possibly following the model of "The Icelandic Journals" by Tolkien's literary idol [[William Morris]],<ref>Amison, Anne ''An unexpected Guest. influence of William Morris on J. R. R. Tolkien's works'', [[Mythlore]]2006</ref> and interspersed with songs. The dramatic or dangerous scenes are undercut with a sense of humour, such as the foolishness of the Trolls or the onomatopoeic singing of the Goblins.<ref name="randel" /> It displays a close correlation with the narrative models of [[children's literature]], including an [[Omniscient_narrator#Third_person.2C_omniscient.2Fdramatic|omniscient narrator]], characters that pre-adolescent children can identify with, an emphasis on the relationship between time and narrative progress, and a geography which separates notions of "safe" and "dangerous."<ref name="Poveda">Jaume Alberdo Poveda ''Narrative Models in Tolkien's Stories of Middle Earth'',Journal of English Studies, vol. 4, 2003-2004 </ref>  While Tolkien claimed later to dislike the aspect of the narrative voice addressing the reader directly,<ref name="Carpenter">{{ME-ref|Biography}}</ref> the narrative voice contributes significantly to the success of the novel, and the story is, therefore, often read aloud.<ref> ''The Hobbit Major Themes'', Cliff Notes, retrieved (30/01/08)[[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/The-Hobbit-Critical-Essays-Major-Themes.id-171,pageNum-68.html]]</ref>

The novel draws on Tolkien's knowledge of historical languages and early European texts (for example, the names of Gandalf and all but one of the thirteen dwarves were taken directly from the [[Old Norse]] poem "Voluspa" from the [[Elder Edda]])<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/lordoftheringstrilogy/lessons/two/handouts.jsp | title=Tolkien's Middle-earth: Lesson Plans, Unit Two | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref> and several of the authors illustrations make use of [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] [[rune]]s.

==Major themes==

The central character, Bilbo, is a modern [[anachronism]] exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world  because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds; for example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, whilst those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is the form of the riddle-game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to understand each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading to an understanding of the deeper unity between the ancient and modern is a constant recurring theme throughout ''The Hobbit''.<ref>Shippey, Tom: ''Tolkien: Author of the Century'', HarperCollins, 2000, p.41</ref>

''The Hobbit'' may be read as Tolkien's parable of the [[World War I|First World War]], where the hero is plucked from his rural home, and thrown into a far off war where traditional types of heroism are shown to be futile<ref>Carpenter, Humphrey: ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Review, The Times 2003 [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article1020455.ece ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Review, The Times 2003]</ref> and as such explores the theme of heroism. The theme of war portrayed in literature as an anti-[[pastoral]] is also seen in ''The Hobbit''; in "The Desolation of Smaug," both the area under the influence of Smaug before his demise and the setting for "[[The Battle of the Five Armies]]" later are described as barren, damaged landscapes.<ref>Croft, Janet Brennan ''The Great War and Tolkien's Memory, an examination of World War I themes in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings'' Mythlore,  Fall-Winter, 2002 </ref> 

The [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] concept of [[individuation]] is reflected through the theme of growing maturity and capability, with the author seen to be contrasting Bilbo's personal growth against the same stunted development in the dwarves.<ref name="Matthews" /> The theme of a character entering into  enclosed spaces (such as the various hills, caves, dungeons) has a [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] dimension, with the additional analogue of the "[[underworld]]" and the hero returning with a boon (such as the ring, or Elvish blades) which benefits his society is seen to fit the mythic [[archetype|archetypes]] regarding initiation and male coming of age as described by [[Joseph Campbell]].<ref name="randel">Helms, Randel McCraw: ''Myth, Magic and Meaning in Tolkien's World'', Granada, 1976. pp.45-55</ref>

Greed plays a central role in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from one or more of the characters' simple desire for food (be it trolls eating dwarves or dwarves eating Wood-elf fare) or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/notes/hob/TOP1.htm ''The Hobbit'' on Bookrags]</ref>

==Reception and legacy==

On first publication, ''The Hobbit'' was met with almost unanimously favourable reviews, from publications both in the UK and the USA, including ''[[The Times]]'' (written by [[C.S. Lewis]]), ''Catholic World'' and ''[[The New york Post]]''. <ref>Anderson, Douglas A., ed.''The Annotated Hobbit''. Revised Edition. Harper Collins. London, 2003. ISBN 0-00-713726-3.</ref>  It was nominated for the [[Carnegie Medal]],and awarded a prize from the [[New York Herald Tribune]] for best juvenile fiction of the year (1938). More recently, ''The Hobbit'' has been recognized as "Most Important 20th-Century Novel (for Older Readers)" in the ''Children's Books of the Century'' poll in ''Books for Keeps''.<ref>[http://www.tolkiensociety.org/faq01.html#awards Tolkien Society FAQ: Did Tolkien win any awards for his books?]</ref>

While ''The Hobbit'' has been [[#Adaptations|adapted]] and elaborated upon in many ways, its sequel ''The Lord of the Rings'' is often claimed to be its greatest legacy. The plots share basic elements, but Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The differences between the two stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find they are not.<ref name="Kocher">Kocher, Paul ''Master of Middle-earth, the Achievement of J.R.R. Tolkien'' Penguin, 1974, Chapter 2: The Hobbit.</ref> Some differences are in details; for example, goblins are more often referred to as Orcs in ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>Anderson, ''The Annotated Hobbit'' (1988)</ref> Many of the thematic differences arose because Tolkien wrote ''The Hobbit'' as a story for children, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' for the same audience who had subsequently grown up since its publication. Further, Tolkien's concept of Middle-earth was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.<ref>Tolkien, Christopher ''The History of Middle-earth'', Vol 1 "The Book of Lost Tales", p.7</ref>

=== Adaptations ===

==== Dramatisations ====
March 1953 saw the first authorized adaptation, a stage production by [[St. Margaret's School]], [[Edinburgh]].<ref>Anderson, Douglas, ''The Annotated Hobbit'', p.23</ref> ''The Hobbit'' has since been adapted for other media many times.

The [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''[[The Hobbit (1968 radio series)|The Hobbit]]'' [[radio drama]] was adapted by [[Michael Kilgarriff]], in eight parts (four total hours) from September to November 1968, starring [[Anthony Jackson (actor)|Anthony Jackson]] as narrator, [[Paul Daneman]] as Bilbo and [[Heron Carvic]] as Gandalf; it was released on [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]] in 1988 and CD in 1997.<ref name="Bramlett">Bramlett, Perry C.

In [[1968]] J.R.R. Tolkien authorised Pauline Gray's adaptation for the stage. This dramatisation takes liberties with the original plot missing out key sections and giving Thorin the role of dragon-slayer amongst other deviations.<ref>Ignatius, Jeff ''[http://www.rcreader.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=10185&Itemid=48|Don't Mess With the Hobbit]]', on River City Reader,

''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'', an [[animated]] version of the story produced by [[Rankin/Bass]], debuted as a [[television movie]] in the [[United States]] in 1977.  In [[1978]], Romeo Muller won a [[Peabody Award]] for his teleplay for ''The Hobbit'' in [[1978]]. The film was also nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], but lost to ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''. The adaptation has been called "excruciable"<ref>Anderson. Donald A. ''The Annotated Hobbit''</ref> and confusing for those not already familiar with the plot.<ref>Kask, TJ, ''NBC's The Hobbit'', [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]], December 1977</ref>

The American radio theatre company ''The Mind's Eye'' produced an audio adaptation of ''The Hobbit'' which was released on six one-hour audio cassettes in [[1979]].<ref name="Bramlett">Bramlett, Perry C. ''I Am in Fact a Hobbit: An Introduction to the Life and Works of J. R. R. Tolkien'', Mercer University Press, 2003 p.239</ref>

==== Board, war and roleplaying games====
''The Hobbit'' has been the subject of several [[board games]].

[[TSR, Inc.]] released two editions of a war-themed based on "The Battle of Five Armies," designed by Larry Smith in the 1970s using cardboard tokens and a map of the area around the Lonely Mountain as a game area. The game was criticized for a lack of clearness in the rules, and praised for evoking the onslaught of the Warg and goblin army.<ref>Easterbrook, Martin, ''Open Box Review'' [[White Dwarf (magazine)]] #3,Oct/Nov 1977 p 15</ref>

"The Lonely Mountain," produced in 1985 by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]],<ref name="white_dwarf_57"> ''Newsboard'', ''Fellowship Follows'', [[White Dwarf (magazine)]] #57, September, 1984 p45 </ref> was designed by Coleman Charlton and features groups of adventurers entering Smaug's Lair to capture his treasure before he awakens. The same year, the same publisher also released their version of ''The Battle of Five Armies'' <ref name="white_dwarf_57" /> developed by Richard H. Britton, Coleman Charlton, and John Crowell, again taking the theme of a wargame and using card counters and a paper map.

"The Hobbit Adventure Boardgame" was the last game from Iron Crown based directly on ''The Hobbit''. They continued to publish the [[MERP|Middle-earth Role Playing Game]], a game licensed on both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' properties, combining elements from both works.<ref>[http://www.invasivedesigns.com/otherhands/frames_what.html "What is MERP?"] on Other Hands</ref>

The multi-[[Origins Award|Origin Award]]-winning ''Middle-earth Strategic Gaming'' (formerly ''Middle-earth Play-by-Mail'') uses the ''Battle of Five Armies'' as an introductory scenario to the full game and includes characters and armies from the book.<ref>More information can be found at: [http://middleearthgames.com/modbofa.html the Middle-earth Games page for the game] (retrieved 25/02/08)</ref>

In 2005, [[Games Workshop]] released a ''Battle of Five Armies'' [[tabletop wargame]], designed by [[Rick Priestley]] using highly detailed 10 mm figures sculpted by Mark Harrison, based on Games Workshop's [[Warmaster]] rules and designed for the home player.<ref>Jones, Rich, [http://www.wargamesjournal.com/pdfmagazine/Issue_1.pdf ''Battle of the Five Armies Rules and miniatures for recreating battles in Middle Earth''], Wargames Journal 1, 2005 p.91</ref><ref>More information can be found at: [http://www.specialist-games.com/bofa/whatis.asp Games Workshop's Specialist Games site] </ref>

==== Video games ====

[[Image:Hobbit adventure packaging.jpg|right|200px|thumb|200px|Cover of the award winning computer game]] Several [[Video game|computer and video games]], both licensed and unlicensed, have been based on the story. One of the most successful was ''[[The Hobbit (video game)|The Hobbit]]'', an award-winning computer game developed in 1982 by [[Beam Software]] and published by [[Melbourne House]] with compatibility for most computers available at the time. By arrangement with publishers, a copy of the novel was included with each game sold with the promise that clues from the book had been programmed into the game, encouraging engagement with the text.<ref>Moore, Phil ''Using Computers in English: A Practical Guide'', 1986, Routledge, pp. 44 </ref> The game won the [[Golden Joystick]] Award for Strategy Game of the Year in 1983<ref>[[CRASH (magazine)]] #4, p. 43 [http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue04/Pages/Crash0400043.jpg]</ref> and was responsible for popularising the phrase, "Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold."<ref>Campbell, Stuart.
