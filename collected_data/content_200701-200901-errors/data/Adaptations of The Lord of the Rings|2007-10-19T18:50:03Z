'''''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''''', an epic [[high fantasy]] novel by the [[United Kingdom|British]] author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], set in his world of [[Middle-earth]] (a fictional past version of our [[Earth]]), has been adapted for various media multiple times.

==Film==
Three film adaptations of ''The Lord of the Rings'' have been made. The first was ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1978), by [[animator]] [[Ralph Bakshi]], the first part of what was originally intended to be a two-part adaptation of the story. The second, ''[[The Return of the King (1980 movie)|The Return of the King]]'' (1980), was a [[television special]] by [[Rankin-Bass]]. The third was director [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy, released in three installments as ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (2001), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' (2002), and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003).

===Early efforts===
The rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' were held by [[Walt Disney]] for ten years, but the Disney company was unable to put together a film production.{{ME-fact|date=October 2007}} [[The Beatles]] planned to do a live-action version with [[Paul McCartney]] as [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Ringo Starr]] as [[Sam Gamgee]], [[George Harrison]] as [[Gandalf]], and [[John Lennon]] as [[Gollum]] - but those plans came to nothing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/28/rings.beatles/|title= 	
Beatles plan for Rings film|accessdate=14 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref> It was even said that [[Stanley Kubrick]] had looked into the possibility of filming the story, but he abandoned the idea as too "immense" to be made into a movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonering.net/archives/main_news/6.22.00-6.28.00|title=If the Beatles had made a Lord of the Rings movie...|accessdate=14 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref> 

In the mid-1970s, film director [[John Boorman]] collaborated with current film rights holder and producer [[Saul Zaentz]] and corresponded with Tolkien about a live action picture, which was supposedly more to the author's liking than an animated film. Produced by [[United Artists]], it would have been one long film with an intermission.<ref name="outre">[[OUTRE: The World Of Ultramedia]], issue #26</ref> 

In the script, written by Boorman and his colleague [[Rospo Pallenberg]], many new elements were inserted or were modified. The first half is largely based on ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. Following the intermission, the writers “dropped things out” and “invented as they went along”.<ref name ="outre" /> Among other things, Frodo and the Lady [[Galadriel]] have sexual intercourse (her husband [[Celeborn]] is omitted), the [[Witch-king of Angmar|Lord of the Nazgûl]] rides a bleeding, skinless horse in lieu of a flying [[pterodactyl]]ic [[fell beast|creature]], [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] is put in a hole and beaten so he can retrieve the password to Moria from his ancestral memory, and [[Arwen]] is made into a spiritual guide for the Fellowship and her role as [[Aragorn]]'s love interest is wholly transferred to [[Éowyn]], who becomes the latter's queen.<ref name = "torc">{{cite web|url=http://forums.theonering.com/viewtopic.php?t=51271&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0|title="The One Ring" forum thread "John Boorman's LOTR Screenplay"|accessdate=9 January |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The project ultimately proved too expensive to finance at that time. Boorman ended up making the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] epic ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]''  instead, also with Pallenberg's help - where in a draft for that movie’s script they use similar concepts; a "duel of words" originally planned between Gandalf and Saruman becomes a duel between [[Merlin]] and [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana]], albeit rephrased. This duel as written does not appear in the final film.<ref name = "torc"/> A copy of the script is stored in the Tolkien papers collection of [[Marquette University]].<ref name="Screenplays">Croft, Janet B. {{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title="Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle"|accessdate=29 November |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In 1977, [[Rankin/Bass|Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc.]] produced the first real film adaptation of any of Tolkien's works with an [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated television version]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077687/|title=The Hobbit|accessdate=16 June|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Animated films===

[[Image:The Lord of the Rings (1978).jpg|thumb|Ralph Bakshi's ''The Lord of the Rings'']]
In 1978, shortly after the Rankin-Bass animated television film of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Saul Zaentz produced an [[animation|animated]] adaptation of ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' and part of ''The Two Towers''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0951763/|title=Saul Zaentz|accessdate=16 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings]]'', originally released by [[United Artists]], was directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]] and used an animation technique called [[rotoscoping]] in which footage of live actors was filmed and then traced over.<ref>Bakshi.com Gallery Images: [http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=5&pos=20 1] [http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=5&pos=10 2] [http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=5&pos=11 3]</ref> The film was part one of what was originally to be a two-part adaptation of Tolkien's story, Part I ending after the battle of Helm's Deep, but before Sam, Frodo and Gollum traverse the [[Dead Marshes]], and Part II picking up from where the first left off. Made for a minimal budget of US$8 million, the film made over US$30 million dollars at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077869/business|title=IMDB box office data|accessdate=9 January |accessyear=2006}}</ref> However, United Artists viewed the film as a flop, and refused to fund a Part II (covering the rest of the story). In 1980, Rankin/Bass produced an animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079802/|title=The Return of the King|accessdate=16 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref> based on their own concepts previously applied to their earlier animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]''.

===New Line Cinema films===
{{main|The Lord of the Rings film trilogy}}
[[Image:LOTRFOTRmovie.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Peter Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'']]
[[Miramax]] Films developed a full-fledged [[live action]] adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings,'' with [[Peter Jackson]] as director. Eventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, Jackson was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over.  In 1999, [[New Line Cinema]] assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilising the "[[Massive (software)|Massive]]" software program. ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on [[December 19]] [[2001]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' on [[December 18]] [[2002]] and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on [[December 17]] [[2003]]. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.

The films were met with both critical and commercial success. Jackson's adaptations garnered seventeen Oscars, four for ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', two for ''The Two Towers'', and eleven for ''The Return of the King''; these covered many of the award categories.

[[Image:LOTRROTKmovie.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Peter Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'']]
''The Return of the King'' in fact won all of the eleven awards for which it was nominated, including Best Picture.  With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history, surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28. Its 11 Oscars at the [[76th Academy Awards|2004 Academy Awards]] tied it for most awards won for one film with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' six years earlier and the 1959 version of ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]].''  It also broke the previous "sweep" record, beating ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' and ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' (which each took 9 out of 9). ''The Return of the King'' also made movie history as the highest grossing film opening on a Wednesday and was the second film after ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' to earn over US$1 billion worldwide. 

The ''Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy is widely and currently considered to be the most popular <ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20050125/ai_n11009603 ''Remaking ''King Kong'' an honor for Jackson''] by John Horn, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> and is verified to be the currently highest grossing motion picture trilogy worldwide of all time, evidenced by its earning close to $3-billion (US) <ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/trilogyww.htm Top Box Office Earning Trilogies Worldwide at Box Office Mojo.com], last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref>, besting other notable franchises such as the [[Original trilogy|original]] ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy (without adjustment for inflation) and the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. The film trilogy also set a record for the total number of [[Academy Awards]] won, tallying a total of seventeen [[Oscars]]. <ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com], last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref>  Critical acclaim has commonly hailed the trilogy as "the greatest films of our era," <ref>[http://www.filmhobbit.com/cgi-bin/movies/movies.cgi?action=showreview&review=rotk Film Hobbit's review of ''Return of the King''], last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> and "the trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal." <ref>[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan16dec16,2,3219427.htmlstory?coll=cl-mreview ''Return of the King'' review at CalendarLive.com] by [[Kenneth Turan]], last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref>

On the other hand, some readers of the book decried certain changes made in the adaptation, including changes in tone,<ref>Croft, Janet B. [http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/anticipationandflattening.htm The Mines of Moria: "Anticipation" and "Flattening" in Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring].

Originally for ''Literature Film Quarterly'', 2002. Last retrieved on 25 August 2006</ref> various changes made to characters such as [[Aragorn]], [[Arwen]], [[Denethor]] and [[Faramir]], as well as to the main protagonist [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] himself, and the deletion of the next to the last chapter of Tolkien's work, "[[The Scouring of the Shire]]".<ref>[http://www.oddlots.digitalspace.net/arthedain/ ''Filming Issues With ''The Two Towers'' Movie''] at OddLots.digitalspace.net, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref>, a part he himself felt thematically necessary.  

The trilogy's defenders assert that it is a worthy interpretation of the book, most changes stemming from the filmmakers putting the book into a modern context{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, rearranging the events into a chronologically linear narrative (as opposed to Tolkien separating the two main story threads into two separate parts for ''The Two Towers'' and most of ''The Return of the King''){{Fact|date=February 2007}}, and their perceived need for developing characters further or for sheer timing issues.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In any case, the films proved popular with general audiences (i.e. non-readers) and readers alike.

==Stage==
{{main|The Lord of the Rings (musical)}}
Several [[musical theatre]] adaptations have been made based on ''The Lord of the Rings''.  Full-length productions of each of ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' (2001), ''The Two Towers'' (2002), and ''The Return of the King'' (2003) were staged in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].

[[Image:Lotrmus.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A scene from the Toronto musical]] In 2006, a very large-scale three-and-a-half-hour musical was produced in [[Toronto]].  The expensive production lost money and closed six months later and, after some cutting and rewriting, began performances in London in May 2007.

==Audio==
===1955-1956 radio play===
In 1955 and 1956, the [[BBC]] broadcast ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]],'' a 12-part radio adaptation of the story. In ''The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien'' Tolkien disparages the radio dramatization of ''The Lord of the Rings,'' referring to the portrayal of Tom Bombadil as "dreadful" and complaining bitterly about several other aspects of the dramatisation.<ref>{{ME-ref|Letters|no. 175}}</ref>  No recording of the 1956 series is known to exist.

===WBAI radio adaptation===
In the early 1960s radio station WBAI-FM, New York, broadcast a short adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', with music.  This version, which had not been authorized by Tolkien, was later suppressed by his legal representatives.

===1979 radio play===
A 1979 dramatisation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' was broadcast in the USA and subsequently issued on tape and CD. No cast or credits appear on the audio packaging. Each of the actors was apparently recorded separately and then the various parts were edited together. Thus, unlike a BBC recording session where the actors are recorded together, none of the cast are actually interacting with each other; the performances suffer badly as a result.

===1981 radio play===
In 1981 the BBC broadcast ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]],'' a new, ambitious dramatisation in 26 half-hour installments. It stared [[Ian Holm]] as [[Frodo Baggins]], the protagonist; he would play [[Bilbo Baggins]], his character's cousin/uncle, in the live-action trilogy. <!---- This needs expansion! --->

===1990 unabridged reading===
In 1990 British actor [[Rob Inglis]] read/performed an unabridged version for [[Recorded Books]]. While not strictly an adaptation, Inglis created voices for all of the characters. And along with project producer [[Claudia Howard]], he created music for all of the songs, which he performed. The project took six weeks to record, plus preparation time. A year later he recorded an audio version of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.
