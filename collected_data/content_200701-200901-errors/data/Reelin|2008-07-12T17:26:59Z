'''Reelin''' is a [[protein]] found mainly in the [[brain]], but also in the spinal cord, blood and other body organs and tissues. Reelin is crucial for regulating the processes of [[Neural development#Neuronal Migration|neuronal migration]] and positioning in the developing brain.
Besides this important role in the early period, reelin continues to work in the adult brain. It modulates the [[synaptic plasticity]] by enhancing [[Long-term potentiation|LTP]] induction and maintenance.<!--

Reelin is implicated in pathogenesis of several brain diseases: significantly lowered expression of the protein have been found in [[schizophrenia]] and psychotic [[bipolar disorder]]. Total lack of reelin causes a form of [[lissencephaly]]; reelin also may play a role in [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[temporal lobe epilepsy]], and [[autism]]. 

Reelin's name comes from the abnormal reeling [[gait]] of ''[[reeler]]'' mice,<!--

--> which were found to have a deficiency of this brain [[protein]] and were [[Zygosity|homozygous]] for the RELN gene, which encodes reelin synthesis. 
The primary phenotype associated with loss of reelin function is inverted cortex, a neuroanatomical defect in which the six cortical layers are inverted.  [[Zygosity|Heterozygous]] mice for the reelin gene have very little obvious neuroanatomical defect but those that they have resemble the changes of the human [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] brain. 


== History ==
[[Image:Reeler_lamination.png|thumb|right|250px|Normal and [[Reeler]] mice brain slices.]]
Mutant mice provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of the development of the [[Central nervous system|CNS]]. These spontaneous mutations were first identified by scientists interested in motor behavior, and it proved relatively easy to screen [[littermate]]s for mice that showed difficulties moving around the cage. A number of such mice were found and given descriptive names such as reeler, weaver, lurcher, nervous, and staggerer.

The "[[reeler]]" mouse was first described in the [[1951]] edition of [[Journal of Genetics]] by [[Douglas Scott Falconer]].<ref name="falconer"/> Histopathological studies in the 1960's revealed that the reeler cerebellum is dramatically decreased in size and the normal laminar organization found in several brain regions is disrupted.<ref name="hamburgh">{{cite journal |author=Hamburgh M |title=Analysis of the postnatal developmental effects of "reeler", a neurological mutation in mice.

In [[1995]], the RELN gene and protein were discovered at chromosome 7q22 by Gabriella D'Arcangelo and colleagues<ref name="Darcan1">{{cite journal |author=D'Arcangelo G, Miao GG, Chen SC, Soares HD, Morgan JI, Curran T |title=A protein related to extracellular matrix proteins deleted in the mouse mutant reeler |journal=Nature |volume=374 |issue=6524 |pages=719–23 |year=1995 |month=April |pmid=7715726 |doi=10.1038/374719a0 |url=}}</ref>. Almost immediately,  Japanese scientists at [[Kochi Medical School]] had successfully created the first [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] for reelin, called CR-50.<ref name="cr50">{{cite journal |author=Ogawa M, Miyata T, Nakajima K, ''et al'' |title=The reeler gene-associated antigen on Cajal-Retzius neurons is a crucial molecule for laminar organization of cortical neurons |journal=Neuron |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=899–912 |year=1995 |month=May |pmid=7748558 |doi= |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0896-6273(95)90329-1}}</ref> They noted that CR-50 reacted specifically with [[Cajal-Retzius cell|Cajal-Retzius neurons]], whose functional role was unknown till then. 

The downstream pathway of Reelin was clarified using other mutant mice, including [[yotari]] and [[Scrambler mouse|scrambler]]. These mice have phenotypes similar to that of reeler but have no mutation in reelin. It was then demonstrated that the mouse ''disabled homologue 1'' ([[DAB1|Dab1]]) gene, which encodes a homolog of ''Drosophila disabled'', is the gene responsible for the phenotypes of these mutant mice, and Dab1 protein was absent (yotari) or only barely (scrambler) detectable in these mutants.<ref name="yotari_and_scrambler">{{cite journal |author=Sheldon M, Rice DS, D'Arcangelo G, ''et al'' |title=Scrambler and yotari disrupt the disabled gene and produce a reeler-like phenotype in mice |journal=Nature |volume=389 |issue=6652 |pages=730–3 |year=1997 |month=October |pmid=9338784 |doi=10.1038/39601 |url=}}</ref> Targeted disruption of Dab1 also caused a phenotype similar to that of reeler.

The Reelin receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and very-low-density lipoprotein receptor, were discovered serendipitously by Trommsdorff et al, who found that the double [[Gene knockout|knockout]] mice for apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and very-low-density lipoprotein receptor, which they generated for another experiment, showed defects in cortical layering similar to that in reeler.<ref name="receptors_discovery">{{cite journal |author=Trommsdorff M, Gotthardt M, Hiesberger T, ''et al'' |title=Reeler/Disabled-like disruption of neuronal migration in knockout mice lacking the VLDL receptor and ApoE receptor 2 |journal=Cell |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=689–701 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10380922 |doi= |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092-8674(00)80782-5}}</ref>

[[image:Schema of the Reelin protein vertical en.png|thumb|right|Schema of the Reelin protein]]
==Structure==

Reelin is a secreted [[extracellular matrix]] [[glycoprotein]] composed of 3461 amino acids with a relative molecular mass of 388 [[Atomic mass unit|kDa]].

Reelin molecule starts with a signaling peptide 27 amino acids in length, followed by a region bearing similarity to [[F-spondin]], marked as "SP" on the scheme, and by a region unique to reelin, marked as "H". Next come the 8 repeats of 300-350 amino acids. These are called ''reelin repeats'' and have an [[Epidermal growth factor|EGF]] motif at their center, dividing each repeat into two subrepeats, ''A'' and ''B''. Despite this interruption, the two subdomains make direct contact, resulting in a compact overall structure.<!--

--><ref name="reelinstructure2006japan">{{cite journal |author=Nogi T, Yasui N, Hattori M, Iwasaki K, Takagi J |title=Structure of a signaling-competent reelin fragment revealed by X-ray crystallography and electron tomography |journal=EMBO J. |volume=25 |issue=15 |pages=3675–83 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16858396 |pmc=1538547 |doi=10.1038/sj.emboj.7601240 |url=}}</ref>

The last comes a highly basic and short C-terminal region (CTR, marked "+") with a length of 32 amino acids. This region is extremely conservative, being 100% identical in all investigated mammals. It was thought that CTR is necessary for reelin secretion, because Orleans [[reeler]] mutation, which lacks a part of 8th repeat and the whole CTR, is unable to secrete the misshaped protein, leading to its concentration in cytoplasm. However, one recent study has shown that the CTR is not essential for secretion, which is most probably hindered then reelin is cut along one of the repeats.<!--

-->  

Reelin is cleaved ''in vivo'' at two sites located after domains 2 and 6 - approximately between repeats 2 and 3 and between repeats 6 and 7, resulting in the production of three fragments.<!--

== Function and mechanism of action ==
In the process of [[neural development]], Reelin acts on migrating neuronal precursors and controls correct cell positioning in the cortex and other brain structures. The proposed role is one of a dissociation signal for neuronal groups, allowing them to separate and go from tangential chain-migration to radial individual migration.<!--

--><ref name="roleofreelin1">{{cite journal |author=Hack I, Bancila M, Loulier K, Carroll P, Cremer H |title=Reelin is a detachment signal in tangential chain-migration during postnatal neurogenesis |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=939–45 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12244323 |doi=10.1038/nn923 |url=}}</ref><!--

--> Dissociation detaches migrating neurons from the [[glial cell]]s that are acting as their guides, converting them into individual cells that can strike out alone to find their final position.

In the adult brain, Reelin plays an important role by modulating cortical pyramidal neuron dendritic spine expression density, the branching of [[dendrite]]s, and the expression of [[long-term potentiation]]. 

===Mechanism of action===
Reelin acts on two receptors:
* [[VLDL receptor|VLDLR]] (very-low-density lipoprotein receptor) and the 
* [[ApoER2]] (apolipoprotein E receptor 2), 
which are members of the [[:Category:low density lipoprotein receptor gene family|Low density lipoprotein receptor gene family]].

The intracellular adaptor [[DAB1]] binds to the VLDLR and ApoER2 through an NPxY motif and is involved in transmission of Reelin signals through these lipoprotein receptors.

The proposal that the proto[[cadherin]] CNR1 behaves as a Reelin receptor<!--

--><ref name="centralfragment"/>

It has been shown that alpha-3-beta-1 [[integrin]] binds to the N-terminal region of reelin, a site distinct from the region of reelin shown to associate with other reelin receptors such as VLDLR/ApoER2.<!--
