The '''iMac''' is a desktop computer designed and built by [[Apple Inc.]]. It has been a large part of Apple's consumer desktop offerings since its introduction in 1998 and has evolved through three distinct forms. In its [[iMac G3|original form]], the G3, the iMac was egg-shaped with a [[CRT]] monitor and was mainly enclosed by colored, translucent plastic. The [[iMac G4|second major revision]], the G4, moved to a design in which there is a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an [[LCD]] monitor on a freely-moving arm attached to the top of the base. The third, and current, scheme for the iMac, used in the [[iMac G5]] and the [[Intel iMac]], places all the components immediately behind the monitor, creating a slim design which tilts only up and down on a simple metal base.  

The machine enjoys a relatively high profile in [[popular culture]] due to its distinctive aesthetics and Apple's successful [[marketing]]. The iMac and other [[Macintosh]] [[computer]]s can also be seen in various movies, commercials, and [[Television|TV]] shows (both live action and animated) due to their wide use in video editing/film production.  

The iMac has also received considerable critical acclaim, including praise from technology columnist [[Walt Mossberg]] as the “Gold Standard of desktop computing;” [[Forbes Magazine]] described the original candy-colored line of iMac computers as being an “industry-altering success”.<ref>{{cite web

==Popular culture==
The announcement of the iMac initially caused considerable buzz among commentators, Mac fans, and detractors in the press and on websites. Opinions were polarized over Apple’s drastic changes to the Macintosh hardware.<ref name="floppydel1">{{cite web

|title=Yet Another iMac Thread!
|date=[[7 May]] [[1998]]
|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> At the time, Apple was revamping its [[retail]] strategy to improve the Mac purchasing experience. Apple famously declared that “the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else’s.”<ref>http://www.computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/default/536E5950A3BB66BACC256F0100744663</ref> The distinctive aesthetics were easily spotted in public. The iMac was recognizable on television, in films and in print. This increased Apple’s brand awareness, and embedded the iMac into [[popular culture]]. When released, the iMac was one of the best selling computers in the U.S. and Japan for months, and Apple was unable to meet demand. 

Apple declared the ‘i’ in iMac to stand for ‘[[Internet]]’. Attention was given to the out-of-box experience: the user needed to go through only two steps to set up and connect to the Internet. “There's no step 3!” was the catch-phrase in a popular iMac commercial narrated by actor [[Jeff Goldblum]].<ref>{{cite video|url=http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/3_steps.html|title=iMac bondi 3 steps|people=[[Jeff Goldblum]]|publisher=[[Apple Computer|Apple]]|medium=Internet}}</ref> Another commercial, dubbed ”Simplicity Shootout”, pitted seven-year-old [[Johann Thomas]] and his [[border collie]] Brodie, with an iMac, against Adam Taggart, a [[Stanford University]]&nbsp;MBA student, with a [[Hewlett-Packard]] Pavilion 8250, in a race to set up their computers. Johann and Brodie finished in 8 minutes and 15 seconds,<ref>http://www.wap.org/journal/imac/default.html</ref> whereas Adam was still working on it by the end of the commercial. Apple later [[Lowercase i prefix|adopted the ‘i’ prefix]] across its consumer hardware and software lines, such as the [[iPod]], [[iBook]], [[iPhone]], [[iLife]], [[iPhoto]], [[iMovie]], [[iDVD]], [[iTunes]], [[iWeb]], [[iWork]], [[iSight]], and [[iSync]]. The prefix has caught on for non-Apple Inc products as well.

Apple’s use of translucent candy-coloured plastics inspired similar designs in other consumer electronics. For example, [[George Foreman Grill|grilling machines]], portable electronics, pencil sharpeners, video game consoles and peripherals (including the [[Nintendo 64]], which was released in special edition ‘Funtastic’ colors) featured the translucent plastic. Apple’s introduction of the [[iPod]], [[iBook]], and iMac G4, all featuring snowy white plastic, inspired similar designs in consumer electronic products. The colour rollout also featured two distinctive ads: ‘Life Savers’ colour scheme was based upon the [[Rolling Stones]] song ''[[She's a Rainbow]]'' and the white advert had [[Cream (band)|Cream]]’s ''[[White Room]]'', specifically its introduction, as its backing track.

==USB==
The [[iMac G3|original iMac]] was the first Macintosh computer to include a [[USB]] port. In fact, USB was the only peripheral interface built into the original iMac; Apple dropped legacy ports such as the [[Apple Desktop Bus]] and [[SCSI]] in favor of the newer interface. Although USB was invented by [[Intel]] and was also available on PCs at the time, the iMac’s popularity and sole dependence on USB helped popularize the interface among third party peripheral makers, as evidenced by the many early USB peripherals that were made of translucent coloured plastic to match the color schemes of the original iMac. Via the USB port, hardware makers could make products compatible with both PCs and Macs. This has allowed Macintosh users to use a large selection of inexpensive devices, such as [[USB hub|hubs]], [[Image scanner|scanners]], [[Data storage device|storage devices]] and mice. After the iMac, Apple continued to remove legacy peripheral interfaces and floppy drives from the rest of its product line.

The successful iMac allowed Apple to continue targeting the Power Macintosh line at the high-end of the market. This foreshadowed a similar strategy in the notebook market, when the iBook was released in 1999. Since then, the company has continued this strategy of differentiating the consumer versus professional product lines. Apple's focus on design has allowed each of its subsequent products to create a distinctive identity. Apple derided the beige colors pervading the PC industry. The company would later use [[Anodising|anodized]] [[aluminium]], and white, black and clear [[polycarbonate]] plastics.

==Legal action==
<!--expand?-->
Apple protected the iMac design with aggressive legal action against computer makers who made imitations, such as [[eMachines]]’ [[eOne]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.com.com/Apple+sues+eMachines+for+iMac+look-alike/2100-1040_3-230054.html
