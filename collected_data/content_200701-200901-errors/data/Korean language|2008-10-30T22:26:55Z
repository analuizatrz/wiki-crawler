'''Korean''' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:한국어|한국어]]/[[wikt:조선말|조선말]]}}, see [[#Names|below]]) is the official [[language]] of [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]]. It is also one of the two official languages in the [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]].  There are about 78 million Korean speakers,<ref name=Ethnologue14 /> with large groups in [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Japan]], the [[United States]], [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] ([[post-Soviet states]]), and more recently the [[Philippines]].  It was formerly written using [[Hanja]], borrowed [[Chinese character]]s pronounced in the Korean way.  In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by [[Sejong the Great]], nowadays called [[Hangul]].

The genealogical [[#Classification|classification]] of the Korean language is debated. Some linguists place it in the [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] language family, while others consider it to be a [[language isolate]]. It is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] in its morphology and [[Subject Object Verb|SOV]] in its [[syntax]].

==Names==
[[Image:Map of Korean language.png|thumb|300px|The map showing usage of Korean language in the world]]
The Korean names for the language are based on the [[Names of Korea|names for Korea]] used in North and South Korea.

In South Korea, the language is most often called ''Hangungmal''
<!-- -->
<!-- ATTENTION! -->
<!-- To our very passionate users who tend to change "Hangungmal" to "Hangugmal" / "Hangukmal", the correct one is indeed [[Media:"HanguNGmal]]", yes, with the "ng" and not just "g", which is due to consonant assimilation by the following consonant "m".  Please REFRAIN from changing it to "Hangugmal"! Additionally, Korean is not like Chinese or Japanese, where Xi'an is different from Xian / an'i is ''different from ani, so please do not put apostrophes between characters in their transliterations. Hyphens'' may be used for disambiguation, but should not be used for anything else. -->

({{lang|ko|[[wikt:한국말|한국말]]}}; {{lang|ko|韓國말}}), or more formally, ''Hangugeo'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:한국어|한국어]]}}; {{lang|ko|韓國語}}) or ''Gugeo'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:국어|국어]]}}; {{lang|ko|國語}}; literally "national language").  It is sometimes colloquially called ''urimal'' ("our language"; {{lang|ko|[[wikt:우리말|우리말]]}} in one word in South Korea, {{lang|ko|[[wikt:우리|우리]] [[wikt:말|말]]}} with a space in North Korea).

In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called ''Chosŏnmal'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:조선말|조선말]]}}; with [[hanja]]: {{lang|ko|朝鮮말}}), or more formally, ''Chosŏnŏ'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:조선어|조선어]]}};  {{lang|ko|朝鮮語}}).

On the other hand, Korean people in the [[Post-Soviet states|former USSR]], who refer to themselves as [[Koryo-saram]] (also ''Goryeoin'' [{{lang|ko|고려인}}; {{lang|ko|高麗人}}; literally, "[[Names of Korea#Historic Names|Goryeo]] person(s)"]) call the language ''[[Koryo-mar|Goryeomal]]'' ({{lang|ko|고려말}}; {{lang|ko|高麗말}}).

In [[mainland China]], following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term ''Cháoxiǎnyǔ'' ({{lang|zh|朝鲜语}} or short form: ''Cháoyǔ'' ({{lang|zh|朝语}})) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while ''Hánguóyǔ'' ({{lang|zh|韩国语}} or short form: ''Hányǔ'' ({{lang|zh|韩语}})) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.

Some older English sources also used the name "Corean" to refer to the language, country, and people.

==Classification==
The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a [[language isolate]]. 

On the other hand, since the publication of the article of [[Gustaf John Ramstedt|Ramstedt]] in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including [[grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Article (grammar)|articles]], fusional morphology, voice, and [[relative pronoun]]s (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely [[Sakha language|Sakha (Yakut)]]. Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other [[Turkic languages]] or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages.<ref>{{cite paper|title=The Typology of Adverbial Agreement|url=http://mercury.hau.ac.kr/kggc/Monthly/ReadingMaterial/Typology.doc|author=Vinokurova, Nadya|date=1999-04-08|accessdate=2007-01-15|format=Microsoft Word}}</ref>

It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to [[Japanese language|Japanese]], since the two languages have a similar grammatical structure, and share a number of possible phonological cognates, as noted by such researchers as [[Samuel E. Martin]] and [[Roy Andrew Miller]] in the late 1960s. [[Sergei Starostin]] (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word [[Swadesh list]], which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family.<ref>{{cite paper|title=Altaiskaya problema i proishozhdeniye yaponskogo yazika (The Altaic Problem and the Origins of the Japanese Language)|url=http://www.alib.ru/findp.php4?author=%D1%F2%E0%F0%EE%F1%F2%E8%ED&title=%C0%EB%F2%E0%E9%F1%EA%E0%FF+%EF%F0%EE%E1%EB%E5%EC%E0+%E8+%EF%F0%EE%E8%F1%F5%EE%E6%E4%E5%ED%E8%E5+%FF%EF%EE%ED%F1%EA%EE%E3%EE+%FF%E7%FB%EA%E0+|author=Sergei Starostin}}</ref>

Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the [[Buyeo languages]] of [[Goguryeo language|Goguryeo]] and [[Baekje]] (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje ''mir'', Japanese ''mi-'' "three".<ref name="Beckwith">{{cite book|title=Koguryo, The Language Of Japan's Continental Relatives: the language of Japan's continental|last=Beckwith|first=Christopher I.|date=2004|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|id=ISBN 9004139494}}</ref>

The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J. [[wikt:水|水]] ''mizu'' (Old J. ''midu'') : K. [[wikt:물|물]] ''mul'' (Middle K. ''mirh'') "water", ''mot'' "lake"; J. [[wikt:来る|来る]] ''ku-ru'' "come" (Old J. ''ku'', also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense 来た ''ki-ta'', negative 来ない ''ko-nai'' in Modern J.) : K. [[wikt:가다|가다]] ''ka-da'' ("go"); J. [[wikt:硬い|硬い]] ''kata-i'' "hard" (whence [[wikt:刀|刀]] ''kata-na'' "knife, sword") : K. ''kud-yn'' (hard); J. [[wikt:いる|いる]] ''i-ru'' "to be" (past tense いた ''i-ta'') : K. [[wikt:이다|이다]] ''i-da'' "to be"; J. ''na'', ''-en'' : K. ''anh'' "not", J. ''minna'' (Old J. ''mynna'') "all, everyone" : K. ''manh-'' "many" (predicate ''mana-da''),  etc. <ref>{{cite paper|title=Old Japanese Phonology and the Korean-Japanese Relationship|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0097-8507(196703)43%3A1%3C278%3AOJPATK%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Y|author=Roy Andrew Miller}}</ref>. The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential [[Altaic family]], esp. in the [[Tungusic languages]]. Cf. Nanay ''mue'' "water", ''giagda-'' "to walk", ''anaa, anna'' "not".

Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a ''[[sprachbund]]'' effect.  See [[East Asian languages#Morphology|East Asian languages]] for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian ''sprachbund'', and [[Japanese language classification]] for further details on the possible relationship.

It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of [[Samhan]] and [[Silla]] than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the [[Goryeo]] period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the [[Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea|Seven-Year War]] brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The [[Jeju dialect]] preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose ''arae a'' is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.

There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as [http://www.apis.seoul.kr/insperiation_01.php Homer B. Hulbert] (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the [[Dravidian languages]] through the similar syntax in both.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Korea's Geographical Significance|last=Hulbert|first=Homer|journal=Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York|volume=32|issue=4|date=1900|pages=322–327|doi=10.2307/197061}}</ref>

Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.

==Dialects==
{{main|Korean dialects}}
[[Image:Koreandialects.png|thumb|180px|Dialects of Korean]]
Korean has several [[dialect]]s (called ''mal'' [literally "speech"], ''saturi'', or ''bang-eon'' in Korean). The [[standard language]] (''pyojuneo'' or ''pyojunmal'') of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around [[Seoul]], and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around [[Pyongyang|P'yŏngyang]]. These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of [[Jeju-do|Jeju Island]] (see [[Jeju dialect]]). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of [[Seoul dialect]] use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the [[Gyeongsang dialect]] have a very pronounced intonation.

It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive [[dialect levelling]], or even [[convergent evolution]] or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean [[wikt:입|입]] {{IPA|/ip/}} "mouth" or Gyeongsang dialect {{IPA|/ʨʌŋ.gu.ʥi/}} vs. Standard Korean {{IPA|/puːʨʰu/}} "[[garlic chives]]." This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  See also the [[Buyeo languages]] [[hypothesis]].

There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the [[regions of Korea]], since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.  Here is a list of traditional dialect names and locations:

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol <{{IPA|&#x25CC;&#x348;}}> (a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle) is used to denote the tensed consonants {{IPA|/p͈/, /t͈/, /k͈/, /ʨ͈/, /s͈/}}. Its official use in the [[Extensions to the IPA]] is for [[Fortis and lenis|'strong']] articulation, but is used in the literature for [[faucalized voice]]. The Korean consonants also have elements of [[stiff voice]], but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted [[glottis]] and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.

===Phonology===
{{IPA|/s/}} becomes an [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] {{IPA|[ɕ]}} before {{IPA|[j]}} or {{IPA|[i]}} for most speakers (but see [[Differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea]]). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot (버섯) 'mushroom').<!-- it's actually much more complicated than this, isn't it?-->

{{IPA|/h/}} may become a [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] {{IPA|[ɸ]}} before {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[u]}}, a [[palatal consonant|palatal]] {{IPA|[ç]}} before {{IPA|[j]}} or {{IPA|[i]}}, a [[velar consonant|velar]] {{IPA|[x]}} before {{IPA|[ɯ]}}, a voiced {{IPA|[ɦ]}} between voiced sounds, and a {{IPA|[h]}} elsewhere.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

{{IPA|/p, t, ʨ, k/}} become voiced {{IPA|[b, d, ʥ, g]}} between voiced sounds.

{{IPA|/l/}} becomes alveolar flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels, and {{IPA|[l]}} or {{IPA|[ɭ]}} at the end of a syllable or next to another {{IPA|/l/}}.  Note that a written syllable-final 'ㄹ', when followed by a vowel or a glide (''i.e.'', when the next character starts with 'ㅇ'), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes {{IPA|[ɾ]}}.

Traditionally, {{IPA|/l/}} was disallowed at the beginning of a word.  It disappeared before {{IPA|[j]}}, and otherwise became {{IPA|/n/}}.  However, the inflow of western loanword changed the trend, and now word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or {{IPA|[l]}}.  The traditional prohibition of word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} became a morphological rule called "initial law" (두음법칙) in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary.  Such words retain their word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} in North Korea.

All [[obstruent]]s (plosives, affricates, fricatives) are [[Unreleased stop|unreleased]] {{IPA|[p̚, t̚, k̚]}} at the end of a word. 

Plosive stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} become nasal stops {{IPA|[m, n, ŋ]}} before nasal stops. 

[[Hangul]] spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. 

One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial {{IPA|[r]}}, and initial {{IPA|[n]}}. For example,
* "labour" - north: '''''r'''odong'' (로동), south: '''''n'''odong'' (노동)
* "history" - north: '''''ry'''ŏksa'' (력사), south: '''''y'''eoksa'' (역사)
* "female" - north: '''''ny'''ŏja'' (녀자), south: '''''y'''eoja'' (여자)

==Morphophonemics==
Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include 은/는, 이/가 and 을/를. Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include 으로/로, 에서/서, 이든지/든지 and 이야/야. However, 으로/로 is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.

==Grammar==
{{main|Korean grammar}}

=== Sentence structure ===
Korean is an [[agglutinative language]]. Modifiers precede the modified word.  The basic form of a Korean sentence is [[Subject Object Verb]], but the verb is the only required and immovable element. 

{|
|'''A''':||&nbsp;||가게-에|| &nbsp; ||갔어-요?
|-
| || ||''gage-e''|| ||''gasseo-yo''
|-
| || ||store + at,to || || went + [polite interrogative marker]
|}
:"Did [you] go to the store?" (with "you" implied by context)

{|
|'''B''': ||&nbsp;||네.
|-
| || ||''ne''
|-
| || ||yes
|}
:"Yes."

=== Parts of speech ===
==== Verb ====
Korean [[verb]]s ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:동사|동사]]}}, ''dongsa'', {{lang|ko|動詞}}) are also known in English as "action verbs" or "dynamic verbs" to distinguish them from [{{lang|ko|[[wikt:형용사|형용사]](形容詞)}}, ''hyeong-yongsa'', "adjectives"]), which are also known as "descriptive verbs" or "stative verbs". Examples of action/dynamic verbs include {{lang|ko|[[wikt:하다|하다]]}} (''hada'', "to do, to have") and {{lang|ko|[[wikt:가다|가다]]}} (''gada'', "to go") which constitute an action or movement as opposed to descriptive verbs such as {{lang|ko|[[wikt:이쁘다|이쁘다]]}} (''ippeuda'', "to be beautiful").  For a larger list of Korean verbs, see [[wikt:Category:Korean verbs]].

Unlike most European languages, Korean does not conjugate verbs using agreement with the subject, and nouns have no gender. Instead, verb conjugations depend upon the verb tense, aspect, mood, and the social relation between the speaker, the subjects, and the listeners.
The system of speech levels and honorifics loosely resembles the [[T-V distinction]] of most [[Indo-European languages]].  For example, different endings are used based on whether the subjects and listeners are friends, parents, or honoured persons.

==== Adjective ====
Words categorized as Korean [[adjective]]s ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:형용사|형용사]]}}, ''hyeong-yongsa'', {{lang|ko|形容詞}}) conjugate similarly to verbs, so some English texts call them "descriptive verbs" or "[[stative verb]]s", but they are distinctly separate from {{lang|ko|동사}} (''dongsa'').

English does not have an identical grammatical category, so the English translation of Korean adjectives may misleadingly suggest that they are verbs.  For example, {{lang|ko|[[wikt:붉다|붉다]]}} (''bukda'') translates literally as "to be red" and {{lang|ko|[[wikt:아쉽다|아쉽다]]}} (''aswipda'') often best translates as "to lack" or "to want for", but both are {{lang|ko|형용사}} (''hyeong-yongsa'', "adjectives").  For a larger list of Korean adjectives, see [[wikt:Category:Korean adjectives]].

==== Determiner ====
Korean [[Determiner (class)|determiners]] ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:관형사|관형사]]}}, ''gwanhyeongsa'', {{lang|ko|冠形詞}}) are also known in English as "determinatives", "adnominals", "pre-nouns", "attributives", and "unconjugated adjectives".  Examples include {{lang|ko|[[wikt:각|각]]}} (''gak'', "each").  For a larger list, see [[wikt:Category:Korean determiners]].

==== Noun ====
A large body of Korean [[noun|nouns]] ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:명사|명사]]}}, ''myeongsa'', {{lang|ko|名詞}}) stem from [[Hanja|Chinese characters]], e.g. {{lang|ko|[[wikt:산|산]]}} (山, ''san'', mountain), {{lang|ko|[[wikt:역|역]]}} (驛, ''yeok'', station), {{lang|ko|[[wikt:문화|문화]]}} (文化, ''munhwa'', culture), etc. Others are native to the Korean language, e.g. {{lang|ko|[[wikt:나라|나라]]}} (''nara'', country), {{lang|ko|[[wikt:날|날]]}} (''nal'', day). Many [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean words]] have a native Korean equivalent and vice versa, but not always. Nouns do not have [[grammatical gender]] and can be made [[plural]] by adding 들 to the end of the word, however in most instances the [[singular]] form is used even when in English it would be translated as plural. For example, while in English the sentence ''"there are three apples"'' would use the plural ''"apples"'' instead of the singular ''"apple"'', the Korean sentence 사과 세개 있습니다 (''sagwa segae isssumnida'') maintains the word 사과 (''sagwa'', "apple") in it's singular form. For a list of Korean nouns, see [[wikt:Category:Korean nouns]].

==== Pronoun ====
{{main|Korean pronouns}}
Korean [[pronoun|pronouns]] ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:대명사|대명사]]}}, ''daemyeongsa'', {{lang|ko|代名詞}}) are highly influenced by the honorifics in the language. Pronouns change forms depending on the social status of the person or persons spoken to ], e.g. the pronoun for "I" there is both the informal {{lang|ko|[[wikt:나|나]]}} (''na'') and the honorific/humbl {{lang|ko|[[wikt:저|저]]}} (''jeo''). In general second person singular pronouns are avoided, especially when using honorific forms. For a larger list or Korean pronouns, see [[wikt:Category:Korean pronouns]].

==== Adverb ====
Korean [[adverb]]s ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:부사|부사]]}}, ''busa'', {{lang|ko|副詞}}) include {{lang|ko|[[wikt:또|또]]}} (''tto'', "also") and {{lang|ko|[[wikt:가득|가득]]}} (''gadeuk'', "fully").  For a larger list, see [[wikt:Category:Korean adverbs]].

==== Particle ====
Korean [[Grammatical particle|particles]] ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:조사|조사]]}}, ''josa'', {{lang|ko|助詞}}) are also known in English as "[[Adposition|postpositions]]".  Examples include {{lang|ko|[[wikt:는|는]]}} (''neun'', topic marker) and {{lang|ko|[[wikt:를|를]]}} (''reul'', object marker).  For a larger list, see [[wikt:Category:Korean particles]].

==== Interjection ====
Korean [[interjection]]s ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:감탄사|감탄사]]}}, ''gamtansa'', {{lang|ko|感歎詞}}) are also known in English as "exclamations".  Examples include {{lang|ko|[[wikt:아니|아니]]}} (''ani'', "no").  For a larger list, see [[wikt:Category:Korean interjections]].

==== Number ====
{{main|Korean numerals}}
Korean [[number|numbers]] or numerals ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:수사|수사]]}}, ''susa'', {{lang|ko|數詞}}) consitute two regularly used sets: a native Korean set and a [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] set. The Sino-Korean system is nearly entirely based on the [[Chinese numerals]]. The distinction between the two numeral systems is very important. Everything that can be counted will use one of the two systems, but seldom both. Sino-Korean words are sometimes used to mark ordinal usage: yeol beon (열 번) means "ten times" while sip beon (십(十) 번(番)) means "number ten." The grouping of large numbers in Korean follow the Chinese tradition of myriads (10000) rather than thousands (1000) as is common in Europe and North America.

== Speech levels and honorifics ==
{{main|Korean honorifics}}

The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in '''[[honorific]]s''', while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in '''speech level'''.

===Honorifics===

When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.

===Speech levels===

There are no fewer than 7 verb [[paradigm]]s or '''speech levels''' in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike [[honorifics]] &mdash; which are used to show respect towards the referent &mdash; '''speech levels''' are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience. The names of the 7 levels are derived from the non-honorific [[imperative]] form of the verb [[wikt:하다|하다]] (''hada'', "do") in each level, plus the suffix 체 ('che', [[hanja]]: <span lang="KO">體</span>), which means "style."

The highest 6 levels are generally grouped together as ''jondaenmal'' (존댓말), while the lowest level (''haeche'', 해체) is called ''banmal'' (반말) in Korean.

==Vocabulary==
The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. Like Japanese and Vietnamese, more than 50% of the vocabulary (up to 60% by some estimates), especially words that denote abstract ideas, are [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean words]],<ref>Sohn, Ho-Min. ''The Korean Language'' (Section 1.5.3 "Korean vocabulary", p.12-13), Cambridge University Press, 2001. ISBN 0521369436</ref> either
* directly borrowed from [[Written Chinese]], or
* coined in Japan or Korea using [[Chinese characters]],
in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek. Korean has two [[Korean numerals|number systems]]: one native, and one borrowed from Chinese.

To a much lesser extent, words have also occasionally been borrowed from [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Sanskrit]], and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the [[Japanese dialects#Tsushima|Tsushima dialect]] of Japanese.

The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from [[English language|English]].<ref>Sohn, Ho-Min. ''The Korean Language'' (Section 1.5.3 "Korean vocabulary", p.12-13), Cambridge University Press, 2001. ISBN 0521369436</ref> Many words have also been borrowed from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[European languages|Western languages]] such as [[German language|German]] (''[[wikt:アルバイト|areubaiteu]]'' ‘part-time job’, ''allereugi'' ‘allergy’). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example ‘dozen’&nbsp;> {{lang|ja-Kana|ダース}} ''dāsu''&nbsp;> {{lang|ko-Hang|다스}} ''daseu''. Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current Hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as ‘German(y)’ (see [[Names for Germany#Japanese and Korean|Names for Germany]]), the first part of whose [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] {{IPA|[ˈd̥ɔɪ̯ʧʷ.la̠ntʰ]}} the Japanese approximated using the [[kanji]] {{lang|ja-Hant|獨逸}} <!-- kyūjitai, no 独 please --> ''doitsu'' that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation: {{lang|ko-Hant|[[wikt:獨|獨]]}}&nbsp;''dok'' + {{lang|ja-Hant|[[wikt:逸|逸]]}}&nbsp;''il'' = ''[[wikt:독일|Dogil]]''. In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented Hangulizations of the countries' endonyms or English names.

North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign (mostly Chinese) influences on the Korean language in the North. By contrast, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which tend to be absent in North Korean.

==Writing system==
{{Korean writing}}
{{main|Hangul}}
{{See also|Hangul consonant and vowel tables}}
In ancient times, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using [[Chinese character]]s, using [[hyangchal]] or [[idu]]. Such systems were not popular because hanja is not well suited to the Korean language. Its use limited some cases and the aristocracy prefers [[Classical Chinese]] for its writing.

Korean is now mainly written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet promulgated in 1446 by [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|Sejong the Great]]; [[Korean mixed script|hanja may be mixed in]] to write [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean words]]. South Korea still teaches 1800 hanja characters in its schools, while the North abolished the use of hanja decades ago.

Modern Korean is written with [[space (punctuation)|space]]s between [[word]]s, a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean [[punctuation]] marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows from left to right, top to bottom.

==Differences between North Korean and South Korean==
{{main|Korean language North-South differences}}
The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary.<ref>Kanno, Hiroomi (ed.) / Society for Korean Linguistics in Japan (1987). ''Chōsengo o manabō'' (『朝鮮語を学ぼう』), Sanshūsha, Tokyo. ISBN 4-384-01506-2</ref>

===Pronunciation===
In North Korea, [[palatalization]] of {{IPA|/si/}} is optional, and {{IPA|/ʨ/}} can be pronounced as {{IPA|[z]}} in between vowels.

Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below.  The pronunciations below are given in [[Revised Romanization of Korean|Revised Romanization]], [[McCune-Reischauer]] and Hangul, the last of which represents what the Hangul would be if one writes the word as pronounced.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Similar pronunciation is used in the North whenever the hanja "的" is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in ㄴ, ㅁ or ㅇ. (In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.)

===Spelling===
Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.

===Spelling and pronunciation===
Some words have different spellings and pronunciations in the North and the South, some of which were given in the "Phonology" section above:

| wonssu (wŏnssu)
| {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|원수}}

|}

In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:

===Others===
In the North, [[guillemet]]s {{lang|ko-Hang-KP|《}} and {{lang|ko-Hang-KP|》}} are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones, “ and ”, are standard, although {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|『 』}} and {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|「 」}} are sometimes used in popular novels.

==Study by non-native speakers==
The [[United States]]' [[Defense Language Institute]] classifies Korean alongside [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as a Category IV language, meaning that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Italian language|Italian]]) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has "sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements" and "can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Applied Language Learning|volume=16|issue=2|url=http://www.dliflc.edu/academics/academic_materials/all/ALLissues/all16two.pdf|last=Raugh|first=Harold E.|title=The Origins of the Transformation of the Defense Language Program|pages=1–12|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref> As a result, the study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by [[Korean American]] heritage language students; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Issues of Validity of SAT Subject Test Korea with Listening|last=Lee|first=Saekyun H.|coauthors=HyunJoo Han|pages=33–56|journal=Applied Language Learning|volume=17|issue=1|url=http://www.dliflc.edu/academics/academic_materials/all/ALLissues/ALL17.pdf}}</ref>

However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese, Mongolian and Turkic languages; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Language Education Policy in Japan|last=Fujita-Round|first=Sachiyo|coauthors=John C.
