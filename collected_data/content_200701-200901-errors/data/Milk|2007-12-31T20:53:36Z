'''Milk''' is an opaque white liquid produced by the [[mammary gland]]s of female [[mammal]]s (including [[monotreme]]s). Mammary glands are highly specialized [[sweat gland]]s. The female ability to produce milk is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. It provides the primary source of nutrition for [[infant|newborns]] before they are able to [[digestion|digest]] other types of food. The early [[lactation]] milk is known as [[colostrum]], and carries the mother's [[antibody|antibodies]] to the baby. It can reduce the risk of many diseases in the baby. Males of all mammal species retain the breasts that are part of the fundamental mammalian animal structure, hence their nipples. Lactation occurs in males in certain rare circumstances, both naturally and artificially, however, some pharmaceuticals precipitate lactation in males readily. The exact components of raw milk varies by species, but it contains significant amounts of [[saturated fat]], [[protein]] and [[calcium]] as well as [[vitamin C]].

==Types of consumption==
There are two distinct types of milk consumption: a natural source of nutrition for all infant mammals; and a food product for humans of all ages derived from other animals.

===Nutrition for infant mammals===
[[Image:Kid feeding on mothers milk.jpg|thumb|250px|A goat kid feeding on its mother's milk.]]
In almost all mammals, milk is fed to [[infant]]s through [[breastfeeding]], either directly or, for humans, by [[breastfeeding#expression|expressing]] the milk to be stored and consumed later. Some cultures, historically or presently, continue to use breast milk to feed their children until as old as seven years.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article388488.ece . . . or just go with the flow?]. [[The Times]], [[May 5]], [[2005]].</ref>

===Food product for humans===
In many cultures of the world, especially the Western world, humans continue to consume milk beyond infancy, using the milk of other animals (in particular, cows) as a food product. For millennia, cow's milk has been processed into dairy products such as [[cream]], [[butter]], [[yogurt]], [[ice cream]], and especially the more durable and easily transportable product, [[cheese]]. Industrial science has brought us [[casein]], [[whey protein]], [[lactose]], [[condensed milk]], [[powdered milk]], and many other food-additive and industrial products.

Humans are an exception in the natural world for consuming milk past infancy.  Even those humans who drink milk after eating solid foods are uncommon within the whole of humanity.  Most humans lose the ability to fully digest milk after childhood (that is, they become [[lactose intolerant]]).  The sugar [[lactose]] is found only in milk, [[forsythia]] flowers, and a few tropical shrubs. The enzyme needed to digest lactose, [[lactase]], reaches its highest levels in the small intestines after birth and then begins a slow decline unless milk is consumed regularly.  <ref name="On Food and Cooking">{{cite book

 }}</ref> On the other hand, those groups that do continue to tolerate milk often have exercised great creativity in using the milk of [[domestication|domesticated]] [[ruminants]], not only of [[cow]]s, but also [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[yak]]s, [[water buffalo]], [[horse]]s, and [[camel]]s.

The term ''milk'' is also used for whitish non-animal substitutes such as [[soy milk]], [[rice milk]], [[almond milk]], and [[coconut milk]]. Even the regurgitated substance [[Columbidae|pigeons]] feed their young is called [[crop milk]] though it bears little resemblance to mammalian milk.

==History==
[[Image:Holstein cows large.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Holstein (cattle)|Holstein]] cattle, the dominant breed in industrialized dairying today.]] 

Milking has its advent in the very evolution of [[placental mammal]]s. While the exact time of its appearance is not known, the immediate ancestors of modern mammals were much like [[monotreme]]s, including the [[platypus]]. Such animals today produce a milk-like substance from glands on the surface of their skin, but without the nipple, for their offspring to drink after hatching from their eggs. Likewise, [[marsupial]]s, the closest cousin to placental mammals, produce a milk-like substance from a teat-like organ in their pouches. The earliest immediate ancestor of placental mammals known seems to be [[eomaia]], a small creature superficially resembling rodents, that is thought to have lived 125 million years ago, during the [[Cretaceous]] era. It almost certainly produced what would be considered milk, in the same way as modern placental mammals.

Animal milk is first known to have been used as human food at the beginning of animal domestication. [[Cow]]'s milk was first used as human food in the [[Middle East]]. [[Goats]] and [[sheep]] were [[domesticated]] in the [[Middle East]] between 9000 and 8000 BC{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Goats and sheep are [[ruminant]]s: [[mammals]] adapted to survive on a diet of dry [[grass]], a food source otherwise useless to humans, and one that is easily stockpiled. The animals were probably first kept for [[meat]] and [[hides]]{{Fact|date=March 2007}}, but dairying proved to be a more efficient way of turning uncultivated [[grasslands]] into sustenance: the food value of an animal killed for [[meat]] can be matched by perhaps one year's worth of milk from the same animal, which will keep producing milk — in convenient daily portions — for years.<ref>McGee, 8-10</ref>

Around 7000 BC, [[cattle]] were being herded in parts of [[Turkey]]. There is evidence of milk consumption in the [[British Isles]] during the [[Neolithic period]]. The use of [[cheese]] and [[butter]] spread in [[Europe]], parts of [[Asia]] and parts of [[Africa]]. Domestic cows, which previously existed throughout much of [[Eurasia]], were then introduced to the colonies of Europe during the [[Age of exploration]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Other animals sources==

[[Image:Goat in melking stall 20050429-593.jpg|thumb|Goat's milk can be used for other applications such as cheese and other dairy products.]]
In addition to [[cows]], the following animals provide milk used by humans for dairy products:

* [[Sheep]] (the ewe)
* [[Goat]]s (the nanny)
* [[Buffalo]]
* [[Horse]]s (the mare)
* [[Donkey]]s
* [[Camel]]s (including the South American [[camelid]]s)
* [[Yak]]s
* [[Water buffalo]]
* [[Reindeer]]

Human milk is not produced or distributed industrially or commercially; however, milk banks exist that allow for the collection of donated human milk and its redistribution to infants who may benefit from human milk for various reasons (premature neonates, babies with allergies or [[Metabolic disorder|metabolic diseases]], etc.).

All other female mammals do produce milk, but are rarely or never used to produce dairy products for human consumption.

In the Western world today, [[cow]]'s milk is produced on an industrial scale. It is by far the most commonly consumed form of milk in the western world. Commercial [[dairy farming]] using [[automatic milking|automated milking]] equipment produces the vast majority of milk in [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Types of [[cattle]] such as the [[Holstein (cattle)|Holstein]] have been specially bred for increased milk production. According to McGee, 90% of the dairy cows in the [[United States]] and 85% in [[Great Britain]] are Holsteins (McGee 12). Other milk cows in the United States include [[Ayrshire cattle|Ayrshire]], [[Brown Swiss]], [[Guernsey cattle|Guernsey]], [[Jersey cattle|Jersey]], and [[Milking Shorthorn]]. The largest producers of dairy products and milk today are [[India]] followed by the [[United States]]<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/j7927e/j7927e09.htm FAO Food outlook: International dairy product prices are turning down: how far, how fast?

In India, [[Amul]], a cooperative owned jointly by 2.6 million small farmers was the engine behind the success of [[Operation Flood]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

==Price==
It was reported in 2007 that with increased world-wide prosperity and the competition of biofuel production for feedstocks, both the demand for and the price of milk had substantially increased world wide. Particularly notable was the rapid increase of consumption of milk in China and the rise of the price of milk in the United States above the government subsidized price.<ref>"A Thirst for Milk Bred by New Wealth Sends Prices Soaring" article by Wayne Arnold in the [[New York Times]] September 4, 2007</ref>

<br style="clear:left" />
==Physical and chemical structure==
Milk is an [[emulsion]] of [[butterfat]] [[globules]] within a water-based fluid. Each fat globule is surrounded by a membrane consisting of [[phospholipids]] and proteins; these [[emulsifier]]s keep the individual globules from joining together into noticeable grains of butterfat and also protect the globules from the fat-digesting activity of [[enzymes]] found in the fluid portion of the milk. In unhomogenized cow's milk, the fat globules average about four [[micrometre|micrometer]]s across. The [[fat-soluble]] vitamins [[vitamin A|A]], [[vitamin D|D]], [[vitamin E|E]], and [[vitamin K|K]] are found within the milkfat portion of the milk (McGee 18).

[[Image:MicelleSchematic.png|thumb|left|140px|Schematic of a [[micelle]].]]  The largest structures in the fluid portion of the milk are [[casein]] protein [[micelles]]: aggregates of several thousand protein molecules, bonded with the help of nanometer-scale particles of [[calcium phosphate]]. Each micelle is roughly spherical and about a tenth of a micrometer across. There are four different types of casein proteins, and collectively they make up around 80 percent of the protein in milk, by weight. Most of the casein proteins are bound into the micelles. There are several competing theories regarding the precise structure of the micelles, but they share one important feature: the outermost layer consists of strands of one type of protein, [[kappa-casein]], reaching out from the body of the micelle into the surrounding fluid. These Kappa-casein molecules all have a negative [[electrical charge]] and therefore repel each other, keeping the micelles separated under normal conditions and in a stable [[colloid]]al [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] in the water-based surrounding fluid<ref>[http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/chem.html#protein3 Dairy Chemistry and Physics, webpage of University of Guelph]</ref> (McGee 19&ndash;20).

Both the fat globules and the smaller casein micelles, which are just large enough to deflect light, contribute to the opaque white color of milk. The fat globules contain some yellow-orange carotene, enough in some breeds &mdash; [[Guernsey cattle|Guernsey]] and [[Jersey cattle|Jersey]] cows, for instance &mdash; to impart a golden or "creamy" hue to a glass of milk. The [[riboflavin]] in the whey portion of milk has a greenish color, which can sometimes be discerned in skim milk or whey products (McGee 17). Fat-free skim milk has only the casein micelles to scatter light, and they tend to scatter shorter-wavelength blue light more than they do red, giving skim milk a bluish tint.<ref>[http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/chem.html#optical Dairy Chemistry and Physics, webpage of University of Guelph]</ref>

[[Image:Lactose color.png|right|thumb|220px|A simplified representation of a [[lactose]] molecule being broken down into [[glucose]] and [[galactose]].]]

Milk contains dozens of other types of proteins besides the caseins.  They are more water-soluble than the caseins and do not form larger structures. Because these proteins remain suspended in the [[whey]] left behind when the caseins coagulate into curds, they are collectively known as ''whey proteins''. Whey proteins make up around twenty percent of the protein in milk, by weight. [[Lactoglobulin]] is the most common whey protein by a large margin (McGee 20&ndash;21). 

The [[carbohydrate]] [[lactose]] gives milk its sweet taste and contributes about 40% of whole cow milk's calories. Lactose is a composite of two [[Monosaccharide|simple sugars]], [[glucose]] and [[galactose]]. In nature, lactose is found only in milk and a small number of plants (McGee 17).  Other components found in raw cow milk are living [[white blood cell]]s.  Mammary-gland cells, various [[bacteria]], and a large number of active [[enzyme]]s are some other components in milk (McGee 16).

==Processing==
[[Image:Cow milking machine in action DSC04132.jpg|thumb|200px|A milking machine in action.]]
In most [[western world|Western]] countries, a centralised [[dairy]] facility processes milk and products obtained from milk ([[dairy products]]), such as [[cream]], [[butter]], and [[cheese]]. In the United States, these dairies are usually local companies, while in the [[southern hemisphere]] facilities may be run by very large nationwide or trans-national corporations (such as [[Fonterra]]).

=== Pasteurization ===
[[Pasteurization]] is used to kill harmful [[microorganisms]] by heating the milk for a short time and then cooling it for storage and transportation. Pasteurized milk is still perishable and must be stored cold by both suppliers and consumers. Dairies print [[Distressed inventory|expiration date]]s on each container, after which stores will remove any unsold milk from their shelves. In many countries it is illegal to sell milk that is not pasteurized.

Milk may also be further heated to extend its [[shelf life]] through ultra-high temperature treatment ([[UHT]]), which allows it to be stored unrefrigerated, or an even longer lasting [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] process.

=== Creaming and homogenization ===

Upon standing for 12 to 24 hours, fresh milk has a tendency to separate into a high-fat [[cream]] layer on top of a larger, low-fat milk layer. The cream is often sold as a separate product with its own uses; today the separation of the cream from the milk is usually accomplished rapidly in [[centrifuge|centrifugal]] cream separators. The fat globules rise to the top of a container of milk because fat is less dense than water. The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. In fact, the cream rises in cow milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins (McGee 19). These clusters rise faster than individual globules can. The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters so readily and are smaller to begin with; cream is very slow to separate from these milks (McGee 19).
[[Image:DonegalMilk.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Milk from [[Ireland]].]]
Milk is often [[homogenization|homogenized]], a treatment which prevents a cream layer from separating out of the milk. The milk is pumped at high pressures through very narrow tubes, breaking up the fat globules through [[turbulence]] and [[cavitation]].<ref>[http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/homogenization.html Homogenization of Milk and Milk Products, webpage of University of Guelph]</ref> A greater number of smaller particles possess more total [[surface area]] than a smaller number of larger ones, and the original fat globule membranes cannot completely cover them. Casein micelles are attracted to the newly-exposed fat surfaces; nearly one-third of the micelles in the milk end up participating in this new membrane structure. The casein weighs down the globules and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation. The exposed fat globules are briefly vulnerable to certain [[enzyme]]s present in milk, which could break down the fats and produce [[rancidity|rancid]] flavors. To prevent this, the enzymes are inactivated by pasteurizing the milk immediately before or during homogenization. Homogenized milk tastes blander but feels creamier in the mouth than unhomogenized; it is whiter and more resistant to developing off flavors (McGee 23). Creamline, or cream-top, milk is unhomogenized; it may or may not have been pasteurized.  Unlike pasteurization, homogenization confers no health or safety benefits to the milk, only the convenience of not needing to shake the bottle oneself. {{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Unhomogenized milk has made a small comeback in a few areas, such as the west coast of the United States where [[Straus Family Creameries]], based originally out of [[Sonoma]], sells one line of organic milk with the cream still on top in old-fashioned glass bottles. They still however pasteurize it to prevent harmful microorganisms.

== Nutrition and health ==

The composition of milk differs widely between species. Factors such as the type of protein; the proportion of protein, fat, and sugar; the levels of various vitamins and minerals; and the size of the [[butterfat]] [[globule]]s and the strength of the [[curd]] are among those than can vary.[http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/intro.html Introduction to Dairy Science and Technology, webpage of University of Guelph] For example:

* [[breast milk|Human milk]] contains, on average, 1.1% protein, 4.2% fat, 7.0% lactose (a sugar), and supplies 72 kcal of energy per 100 [[gram]]s.
* [[Cow]]'s milk contains, on average, 3.4% protein, 3.6% fat, and 4.6% lactose, and supplies 66 kcal of energy per 100 grams. See also [[Milk#Nutritional benefits|Nutritional benefits]] further on.

Aquatic mammals, such as [[pinniped|seals]] and [[whales]], produce milk that is very rich in fats and other solid nutrients when compared with land mammals' milk.

Processed milk began containing differing amounts of fat during the 1950s. A serving (1 cup or 250 ml) of 2%-fat milk contains 285 mg of [[calcium]], which represents 22% to 29% of the [[daily recommended intake]] (DRI) of calcium for an adult. Depending on the age, 8 [[gram]]s of [[protein]], and a number of other nutrients (either naturally or through fortification):

* [[Vitamin D|Vitamins D]] and [[vitamin K|K]] are essential for bone health.
* [[Iodine]] is a mineral essential for thyroid function.
* [[Vitamin B12]] and [[riboflavin]] are necessary for cardiovascular health and energy production, and B12 is difficult to get outside of animal products or else as supplemental pills.
* [[Biotin]] and [[pantothenic acid]] are [[B vitamins]] important for energy production.
* [[Vitamin A]] is critical for [[Immune system|immune function]].
* [[Potassium]] and [[magnesium]] are for cardiovascular health.
* [[Selenium]] is a cancer-preventive [[Micromineral|trace mineral]].
* [[Thiamine]] is a B-vitamin important for [[Cognition|cognitive function]], especially memory
* [[Conjugated linoleic acid]] is a beneficial [[fatty acid]] that inhibits several types of cancer in mice, it has been shown to kill human [[skin cancer]], [[colorectal cancer]] and [[breast cancer]] cells ''in vitro'' studies, and may help lower cholesterol and prevent atherosclerosis; only available in milk from [[Cattle feeding|grass-fed]] cows.

Studies show possible links between low-fat milk consumption and reduced risk of [[arterial hypertension]], [[coronary heart disease]], colorectal cancer and [[obesity]]. Overweight individuals who drink milk may benefit from decreased risk of [[insulin resistance]] and type 2 [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].<ref>[http://www.nationaldairycouncil.org/NationalDairyCouncil/Nutrition/Reducing/DairysRoleManagingBP.htm Dairy's Role in Managing Blood Pressure, web page of the US National Dairy Council]</ref>

Interestingly, a study has shown that for women desiring to have a child, those who consume full fat dairy products may actually slightly increase their fertility, while those consuming low fat dairy products may slightly reduce their fertility due to interference with ovulation. However, studies in this area are still inconsistent.<ref>[http://english.pravda.ru/news/science/01-03-2007/87904-ice_cream-0]</ref>

==== Controversy ====
A number of advocate groups (e.g. [[peta]]) have sprung up protesting that milk presents a health threat{{Fact|date=December 2007}}. However no study has concluded any causal health risk to normal individuals consuming moderate quantities milk. 

Common claims cited by anti-milk advocates:

* White blood cells -- Milk contains varying levels of [[white blood cells]] depending upon the health of the source animals, according to guidelines set up by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and statistics reported by the dairy industry.<ref>[http://www.veganoutreach.org/health/gotmilk-abridged.html Greger, Michael. Paratuberculosis and Crohn's Disease: Got Milk? Pro-vegan online publication, January 2001]</ref>{{Verify source|date=November 2007}}

No study has ever conclusively demonstrated that the levels of white blood cells found in normal milk actually pose any health risk to normal individuals. 

* Bovine Growth Hormone(rbst) -- Since November 1993, with FDA approval, [[Monsanto]] has been selling [[Bovine Somatotropin|recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST)]]--or rBGH--to dairy farmers. Additional bovine growth hormone is administered to cattle in order to increase their milk production, though the hormone also naturally fosters liver production of [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)]]. The deposit thereof in the milk of rBGH-affected cattle has been the source of concern; however, all milk contains IGF1 since all milking cows produce bovine growth hormone naturally. The IGF1 in milk from rBGH-affected cattle does not vary from the range normally found in a non-supplemented cow.<ref>http://www.idfa.org/reg/biotech/talking2.cfm</ref>  Elevated levels of IGF1 in human blood has been linked to increased rates of breast, colon, and prostate cancer by stimulating their growth,<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16773200 Kahan, Z et al., Elevated levels of circulating insulin-like growth factor-I, IGF-binding globulin-3 and testosterone predict hormone-dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women: a case-control study.

==== Lactose intolerance ====<!-- This section is linked from [[Milk]] -->
{{main|lactose intolerance}}

[[Lactose]], the [[disaccharide]] sugar component of all milk must be cleaved in the small intestine by the [[enzyme]] [[lactase]] in order for its constituents ([[galactose]] and [[glucose]]) to be absorbed. The production of this enzyme declines significantly after [[weaning]] in all mammals including humans{{Fact|date=December 2007}} (except for most northern westerners and a few other ethnic groups, lactase decline occurs after weaning, sometime between the ages of two and five). Once lactase levels have decreased sufficiently, consumption of small amounts of lactose can cause [[diarrhea]], [[Flatulence|intestinal gas]], [[cramps]] and [[bloating]], as the undigested lactose travels through the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and serves as nourishment for intestinal [[microflora]] who [[excrete]] gas. <ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_respiration</ref>

These compositions vary by breed, animal, and point in the lactation period.  [[Jersey cattle|Jersey]] cows produce milk of about 5.2% fat, [[Zebu]] cows produce milk of about 4.7% fat, [[Brown Swiss]] cows produce milk of about 4.0% fat, and [[Holstein (cattle)|Holstein-Friesian]] cows produce milk of about 3.6% fat.  The protein range for these four breeds is 3.3% to 3.9%, while the lactose range is 4.7% to 4.9%.  <ref>{{cite book | last = McGee | first = Harold | authorlink = Harold McGee | title = On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen, Completely Revised and Updated | publisher = Scribner |date=2004 | location = New York, NY | pages = 13 | isbn = 9780684800011}}</ref>

Milk fat percentages in all [[Beef cattle|dairy breeds]] vary according to digestible fibre, starch and oil intakes<ref>http://www.kt.iger.bbsrc.ac.uk/FACT%20sheet%20PDF%20files/kt21.pdf</ref>, and can therefore be manipulated by dairy farmers' diet formulation strategies. Mastitis infection can cause fat levels to decline.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=qJgdAEhQvnMC&pg=PA226&lpg=PA226&dq=mastitis+and+milk+fat+levels&source=web&ots=PrguNhnHdm&sig=W_MS2A7FWTBksmBYvZZk38dRh4A</ref>

==Varieties and brands== <!-- This section is linked from [[Starbucks]] -->
{{seealso|Milk bottle top}}
Cow's milk is generally available in several varieties. In some countries these are:

* ''Full cream'' (or "''whole''" in US and UK, "''homo milk''" in Canada & some US dairies, about 3.25% fat)
* ''Semi-skimmed'' ("''reduced fat''" or "''low fat''", about 1.5-1.8% fat)
* ''Skimmed'' (about 0.1% fat)

Milk in the U.S. and Canada is sold as:

* ''Whole'' varieties
* ''2%'' (reduced fat)
* ''1%'' (low fat)
* ''<0.5%'' (very low fat)
* ''Skim'' or ''Nonfat'' (nearly no fat)
* ''[[Buttermilk]] (1% fat, with added bacterial culture)

In Canada "whole" milk refers to creamline (unhomogenized) milk.  "Homogenized" milk refers to milk which is 3.25% butterfat. Generally all store-bought milk in Canada has been homogenized. Yet, the term is also used as a name to describe butterfat content for a specific variety of milk. Modern commercial dairy processing techniques involve first removing all of the butterfat, and then adding back the appropriate amount depending on which product is being produced on that particular line.

In Britain, it is possible to get [[Channel Island milk]], which is 5.5% fat.

In the [[United States of America|United States]], skim milk is also known as "''fat free''" milk, due to [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] regulations stating that any food with less than ½ gram of fat per serving can be labeled "fat free".

Full cream, or whole milk, has the full milk fat content (about 3-4% if [[Holstein Friesian|Friesian]]- or [[Holstein (cattle)|Holstein]]-breed are the source). For skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, all of the fat content is removed and then some (in the case of semi-skimmed milk) is returned.  The best-selling variety of milk is semi-skimmed; in some countries full-cream (whole) milk is generally seen as less healthy and skimmed milk is often thought to lack taste. Whole milk is recommended to provide sufficient fat for developing toddlers who have graduated from [[breast milk]] or [[infant formula]].

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], a blended mixture of half cream and half milk is often sold in small quantities and is called [[half and half|half-and-half]]. Half-and-half is used for creaming coffee and similar uses.  In Canada, ''low-fat cream'' is available, which has half the fat content of half-and-half.

Organic Milk (in the United States) or Bio-Milk & Biologique Milk (in Europe) is milk produced without the use of chemical herbicides or pesticides, and generally with more natural fertilizers and higher standards for the animals{{Fact|date=September 2007}}, and is now easy to find on the shelves in many areas. [[Demeter International|Demeter]] certified milk is produced with [[Biodynamic agriculture]] methods and is similar in standards to organic milk and biological milk, with a few special farm procedures added that are biodynamic-specific.

=== Additives and flavoring===

In countries where the cattle (and often the people) live indoors, commercially sold milk commonly has [[vitamin D]] added to it to make up for lack of exposure to [[Ultraviolet light|UVB]] radiation. 

Reduced fat milks often have added [[vitamin A]] to compensate for the loss of the vitamin during fat removal; in the [[United States]] this results in reduced fat milks having a higher vitamin A content than whole milk.<ref> [http://www.ams.usda.gov/howtobuy/dairy.htm "How to Buy Dairy Products"], ''Home and Garden Bulletin 255'', [[USDA]], February 1995. Retrieved 16 May 2007.</ref> 

To aid digestion in those with [[lactose intolerance]], milk is available in some areas with added bacterial cultures such as ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus]]'' ("[[acidophilus milk]]") and [[bifidobacteria]] ("[[a/B milk]]").<ref>[http://www.nationaldairycouncil.org/nationaldairycouncil/nutrition/products/product_yogurt.pdf "Yogurt and Other Cultured Dairy Products"], [[National Dairy Council]], 2000.</ref> Another milk with ''[[Lactococcus lactis]]'' bacteria cultures ("[[buttermilk|cultured buttermilk]]") is often used in cooking to replace the traditional use of naturally [[soured milk]], which has become rare due to the ubiquity of pasteurization which kills the naturally occurring lactococcus bacteria.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Irma Rombauer|Rombauer, Irma S.]] and [[Marion Rombauer Becker]] | title=[[Joy of Cooking]] (Revised Edition) | publisher=Bobbs Merrill | year=1975 | pages=533 | isbn=0-672-51831-7}}</ref>

Milk often has [[flavoring]] added to it for better taste or as a means of improving sales. [[Chocolate]] [[Flavoured milk|flavored milk]] has been sold for many years and has been followed more recently by such other flavors as strawberry and banana.

[[South Australia]] has the highest consumption of flavored milk per person in the world, where [[Farmers Union Iced Coffee]] outsells [[Coca-Cola]], a success shared only by [[Inca Kola]] in [[Peru]] and [[Irn-Bru]] in [[Scotland]].

[[Switzerland]] has a soft drink based on milk that tastes and looks much like SevenUp. This popular "milk-cola", named [[Rivella]], is in fact the national soft drink and even comes complete in low calorie & low sugar varieties. In spite of what might be expected, it does not taste like milk.

==Distribution==
Because milk spoils so easily, it should, ideally, be distributed as quickly as possible. In many countries milk used to be delivered to households daily, but economic pressure has made milk delivery much less popular, and in many areas daily delivery is no longer available. People buy it chilled at grocery or convenience stores or similar retail outlets. Prior to the widespread use of [[plastic]]s, milk was sold in wax-coated paper containers; prior to that milk was often distributed to consumers in [[glass]] bottles; and before glass bottles, in bulk that was ladled into the customer's container. 

[[Image:Glass milk bottles.jpg|thumb|150px|Glass milk bottles used for home delivery service]]
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], milk can be delivered daily by a [[milkman]] who travels his local [[milk round]] (route) using a battery-powered [[milk float]] during the early hours.  Milk is delivered in 1 [[pint glass]] bottles with [[aluminium foil]] tops.  Silver top denotes full cream unhomogenized; red top full cream homogenized; red/silver top semi-skimmed; blue/silver check top skimmed; and gold top channel island.  
  
Empty bottles are rinsed before being left outside for the milkman to collect and take back to the dairy for washing and reuse.  Currently many milkmen operate franchises as opposed to being employed by the dairy and payment is made at regular intervals, by leaving a check; by cash collection; or [[direct debit]].   

Although there was a steep decline in doorstep delivery sales throughout the 1990s, the service is still prominent, as dairies have diversified and the service is becoming more popular again.  The doorstep delivery of milk is seen as part of the UK's heritage, and is relied upon by people up and down the country.  

In [[New Zealand]], milk is no longer distributed in glass bottles.  In rural [[India]], milk is delivered daily by a local milkman carrying bulk quantities in a metal container, usually on a bicycle; and in other parts of metropolitan India, milk is usually bought or delivered in a plastic bags or cartons via-shops or supermarkets.

In the United States bottles were replaced with [[milk carton]]s, which are tall paper boxes with a square cross-section and a peaked top that can be folded outward upon opening to form a spout. Now milk is increasingly sold in plastic bottles. First the gallon and half-gallon sizes were sold in plastic jugs while the smaller sizes were sold in milk cartons. Recently milk has been sold in smaller resealable bottles made to fit in [[automobile]] [[cup holder]]s. 

The half-pint milk carton is the traditional unit as a component of school lunches. In the U.S., pictures of [[Child abduction|missing children]] were printed on the larger milk cartons as a public service until it was determined that this was disturbing to children.

[[Image:Brique lait dsc04430.jpg|thumb|right|A brick of [[France|French]] [[Ultra-high-temperature processing|UHT]] milk]]
Milk preserved by the [[Ultra-high-temperature processing|UHT]] process is sold in cartons often called a "brik" (tm Tetra Pak) that lack the peak of the traditional milk carton. Milk preserved in this fashion does not need to be refrigerated before opening and has a longer shelf life than milk in ordinary packaging. It is more typically sold unrefrigerated on the shelves in Europe than in America.

Glass milk containers are now rare. Most people purchase milk in bags, plastic jugs or waxed-paper cartons. [[Ultraviolet]] light from [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]] can destroy some of the proteins in milk{{Fact|date=March 2007}} so many companies that once distributed milk in [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or highly [[translucent]] containers are now using thicker materials that block the UV light. Many people feel that such "UV protected" milk tastes better{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

Milk comes in a variety of containers with local variants:
* [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]: Distributed in a variety of sizes, most commonly in [[Tetra Pak]] cartons for up to 1 litres, and plastic screw-top bottles beyond that with the following volumes; 1.1L, 2L, and 3L. 1 litre Bags are starting to appear in supermarkets, but have not yet proved popular. Most UHT-milk is packed in 1 or 2 litre paper containers with a sealed plastic spout.
* [[Brazil]]: Used to be sold in cooled 1 litre bags, just like in [[South Africa]]. Nowadays the most common form is 1 litre [[Tetra Pak]] cartons containing UHT skimmed, semi-skimmed or whole milk, although the plastic bags are still in use.
* [[Canada]]: 1.33 litre plastic bags (sold as 4 litres in 3 bags) are widely available in some areas (especially [[Ontario]] and [[Québec]]), although the 4 litre plastic jug has supplanted them in [[western Canada]]. Other common packaging sizes are 2 litre, 1 litre, 500 [[millilitre]], and 250 millilitre cartons, as well as 4 litre, 1 litre, 250 mL [[Tetra Pak]] cartons and 500 [[millilitre]] plastic jugs.
* [[China]]: Sweetened milk is a drink popular with students of all ages and is often sold in small plastic bags complete with straw.  Adults not wishing to drink at a banquet often drink milk served from cartons or [[milk tea]].
* Parts of [[Europe]]: Sizes of 500 millilitres, 1 litre (the most common), 2 litres and 3 litres are commonplace.
* [[Hong Kong]] - milk is sold in glass bottles (220 mL), cartons (236 mL and 1L), plastic jugs (2 litres) and [[Tetra Pak]] cartons (250 mL).
* [[India]]: Commonly sold in 500 mL plastic bags. It is still customary to serve the milk boiled, despite pasteurization. Milk is often buffalo milk. Flavored milk is sold in most convenience stores in waxed cardboard containers. Convenience stores also sell many varieties of milk (such as flavored and ultra-pasteurized) in different sizes, usually in [[Tetra Pak]] cartons.
* [[Israel]]: Non-UHT milk is most commonly sold in 1 litre waxed cardboard boxes and 1 litre plastic bags. It may also be found in 0.5L and 2L waxed cardboard boxes, 2L plastic jugs and 1L plastic bottles. UHT milk is available in 1 litre (and less commonly also in 0.25L) carton "bricks".
* [[Japan]]: Commonly sold in 1 litre waxed cardboard boxes. In most city centers there is also [[Delivery (commerce)|home delivery]] of milk in glass jugs. As seen in [[China]], sweetened and flavored milk drinks are very popular to see in [[vending machine]]s.
* [[South Africa]]: Commonly sold in 1 litre bags. The bag is then placed in a plastic jug and the corner cut off before the milk is poured.
*[[South Korea]]: sold in cartons (180mL, 200mL, 500mL 900mL, 1L, 1.8L, 2.3L), plastic jugs (100Ml and 1.8L), [[Tetra Pak]] cartons (180mL and 200mL) and plastic bags (100mL).
* [[Poland]]: UHT milk is mostly sold in Tetra Pak cartons (500mL, 1L, 2L), and non-UHT in 1L plastic bags or plastic bottles. Milk, UHT is commonly boiled, despite being pasteurized.
*[[Turkey]]: Commonly sold in 500 mL or 1L cartons or special plastic bottles. UHT milk is more popular. Milkmen also serve in smaller towns and villages.
* [[United Kingdom]]: Most stores still stock [[Imperial unit|Imperial]] sizes: 1 pint (568 mL), 2 pints (1.136 L), 4 pints (2.273 L), 6 pints (3.408 L) or a combination including both metric and imperial sizes. Glass milk bottles delivered to the doorstep by the milkman are typically pint-sized and are returned empty by the householder for repeated [[reuse]]. Milk is also sold at supermarkets in either [[Tetra Pak]] cartons or HDPE bottles.  Milk can still be legally sold by the Imperial pint in [[reuse|reusable]] bottles in the UK under EU regulations (a distinction only shared with beer and cider), whilst a growing number of manufacturers such as [[Northern Foods]] now sell milk in 1 and 2 litre bottles.
* [[United States]]: Commonly sold in [[gallon]], half-gallon and [[quart]] containers ([[U.S. customary units#Liquid volume|U.S. customary units]]) of rigid plastic or, occasionally for sizes less than a gallon, waxed cardboard, although bottles made of opaque [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] are starting to become more commonplace in all smaller sizes. The US single-serving size is usually the half-pint (about 240 ml). Occasionally dairies will deliver milk straight to customers in coolers filled with glass bottles (usually half-gallon). Some [[convenience store]] chains in the United States (such as [[Kwik Trip]] in the [[Midwest]]) sell milk in 1/2 gallon bags.
* [[Uruguay]]: Commonly sold in 1 litre bags. The bag is then placed in a plastic jug and the corner cut off before the milk is poured.

Practically everywhere, [[condensed milk]] and evaporated milk is distributed in metal cans, 250 and 125 ml paper containers and 100 and 200 mL squeeze tubes, and [[powdered milk]] (skim and whole) is distributed in boxes or bags.

==Spoilage and Fermented Milk Products==
When [[raw milk]] is left standing for a while, it turns "[[sour]]". This is the result of [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]], where [[lactic acid bacteria]] ferment the [[lactose]] inside the milk into [[lactic acid]].  Prolonged fermentation may render the milk unpleasant to consume.  This fermentation process is exploited by the introduction of bacterial cultures (e.g. ''[[Lactobacilli]] sp., [[Streptococcus]] sp., [[Leuconostoc]] sp.'', etc) to produce a variety of fermented milk products. The reduced pH from lactic acid accumulation denatures proteins and caused the milk to undergo a variety of different transformations in appearance and texture, ranging from an aggregate to smooth consistency.  Some of these products include [[sour cream]], [[yoghurt]], [[cheese]], [[buttermilk]], [[viili]], [[kefir]] and [[kumis]].  ''See [[Dairy product]]'' for more information.

[[Pasteurized|Pasteurization]] of cow's milk initially destroys any potential pathogens and increases the shelf-life <ref>http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2004/504_milk.html</ref><ref>[http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/65/12/2233.pdf]</ref>, but eventually results in spoilage that makes it unsuitable for consumption.  This causes it to assume an unpleasant odor, and the milk is deemed non-consumable due to unpleasant taste and an increased risk of [[food poisoning]]. In raw milk, the presence of [[lactic acid]]-producing bacteria, under suitable conditions, ferments the lactose present to lactic acid. The increasing [[acidity]] in turn prevents the growth of other organisms, or slows their growth significantly. During pasteurization however, these lactic acid bacteria are mostly destroyed.  

In order to prevent spoilage, milk can be kept [[refrigerator|refrigerated]] and stored between 1 and 4 [[Celsius|degrees Celsius]] in [[bulk tank]]s. Most milk is [[pasteurized]] by heating briefly and then [[refrigerator|refrigerated]] to allow transport from [[factory farming|factory farms]] to local markets. The spoilage of milk can be forestalled by using ultra-high temperature ([[UHT]]) treatment; milk so treated can be stored unrefrigerated for several months until opened. Sterilized milk, which is heated for a much longer period of time, will last even longer, but also loses more nutrients and assume a different taste{{Fact|date=November 2007}}. [[Condensed milk]], made by removing most of the water, can be stored in cans for many years, unrefrigerated, as can [[evaporated milk]]. The most durable form of milk is [[milk powder]], which is produced from milk by removing almost all [[water]]. The [[moisture content]] is usually less than 5% in both drum and spray dried [[milk powder]].

==Language and culture==
{{wikisourcepar|Littell's Living Age/Volume 144/Issue 1861/Chinese Prohibition of the Consumption of Cow's Milk|an account (1880) of a Chinese prohibition against drinking cow's milk.}}
The importance of milk in human culture is attested to by the numerous expressions embedded in our languages, for example "the milk of human kindness". In ancient [[Greek mythology]], the [[goddess]] [[Hera]] spilled her [[breast]] milk after refusing to feed [[Heracles]], resulting in the [[Milky Way]].

In [[Africa]]n and [[Asia]]n [[developing country|developing nations]], [[butter]] is traditionally made from fermented milk rather than cream. It can take several hours of churning to produce workable butter grains from fermented milk.<ref>Crawford ''et al'', part B, section III, ch. 1: [http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/t0251e/T0251E15.htm#ch1 Butter]. Retrieved 28 November 2005.</ref>

Holy books have also mentioned milk; the Bible contains references to the Land of Milk and Honey. In the [[Quran]], there is a request to wonder on milk as follows: 'And surely in the livestock there is a lesson for you, We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies from the midst of digested food and blood, pure milk palatable for the drinkers.'(16-The Honeybee, 66). The Ramadhan fast is traditionally broken with a glass of milk and dates.

The verb, "to milk" something is often used in the vernacular of many English-speaking countries as a synonym for extortion or, in less loaded terms, taking advantage of a situation where one has another person at a disadvantage,
