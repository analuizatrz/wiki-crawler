==History==
{{main article|History of Florida Atlantic University}}
On [[July 15]], [[1961]], the [[Florida Legislature]] passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in southeastern Florida.  A [[1940s]]-era [[Boca Raton Airport|Army airbase]] in Boca Raton, Florida, was selected as the site of the new university.  In [[1962]], the [[Florida Board of Control]] selected "Florida Atlantic University" as the name of the new institution.  Ground was broken on [[December 8]], [[1962]].  FAU opened on [[September 14]], [[1964]], six days behind schedule because of [[Hurricane Cleo]].  The first university in the nation to offer only upper-division and graduate work, FAU had an initial student body of 867.  U.S. [[Presidential system|President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] dedicated the university on October 25, 1964, and received the first honorary doctorate awarded by Florida Atlantic.  
[[Image:FAU Alumni Plaza.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Alumni Plaza]]

In [[1969]], the [[Florida Board of Regents|Board of Regents]] (successor to the Board of Control) approved an intercollegiate athletics program at FAU.  The university teams become known as the [[Burrowing owl|Owls]].  FAU expanded to [[Broward County, Florida]] in 1971, with the founding of the Commercial Boulevard campus in [[Fort Lauderdale]].  During that same year the university was also named a burrowing owl sanctuary.  By 1973, fall semester enrollment was 5,632.  By the fall semester of [[1983]], enrollment would reach 9,388.  For the first time in [[1984]], due to a rapidly growing population, Florida Atlantic opened its doors to [[freshmen]] and [[sophomores]].  In 1985, the Downtown Fort Lauderdale campus opened on Las Olas Boulevard.  

In [[1989]], the [[Florida Legislature]] designated Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County.  The university also reached $10 million in sponsored research activity for the first time.  Fall semester enrollment was 13,148.  In [[1993]], FAU was elected to the [[National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges]], the nation’s oldest higher education professional association.  The university's intercollegiate teams also joined the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] and moved to [[NCAA Division I]].  In [[1995]], Florida Atlantic purchased [[Barry University|Barry University’s]] [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] facility to establish a campus on the [[Treasure Coast]], in partnership with [[Indian River Community College]].  By 1997, sponsored research funding exceeded $24 million.  

In 1999, [[Howard Schnellenberger]], a legendary figure in [[college football]], was named Florida Atlantic’s first head [[american football|football]] coach.  The Barry and Florence Friedberg Lifelong Learning Center opened on the Boca Raton campus.  The [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]] campus also opened and was formally named for the late [[John D. MacArthur]]. [[Image:FAU Baldwin House.jpg|right|thumb|250px|President's Residence at Baldwin House]] Sponsored research funding exceeded $36 million.  By [[2003]], fall semester enrollment was 24,961.  FAU also has maintained the most diverse student body in the State University System, with [[minority]] enrollment of 34.6%.

In 2003, the State of Florida awarded FAU $10 million to establish the nation's only Center of Excellence in Biomedical and Marine Biotechnology, a research facility that searches the waters off Florida's coastline for drugs from natural sources that could be used to treat [[cancer]], [[heart disease]] and other serious illnesses.  The Lady Owls [[softball]] team won the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] championship for the seventh time and was listed among the all-time greatest teams in college softball history by the National Fastpitch Coaches Association.  In 2004, FAU admitted its first students to the [[University of Miami]]/Florida Atlantic University [[medical school]] partnership.

Today, FAU's $168 million endowment is larger than that of some larger state schools in Florida, including the [[University of Central Florida]] and [[Florida International University]]. FAU holds the fourth largest in the state. <ref name="Endowment">{{cite web | url = http://www.palmbeachpost.com/pbcsouth/content/local_news/epaper/2006/10/17/s1b_fauendow_1017.html?cxtype=rss&cxsvc=7&cxcat=17 | title = "Giving to FAU Fourth in State" | publisher = Palm Beach Post | accessdate = 2006-10-17}}</ref>. FAU ranks as one of the less expensive state colleges in Florida, with tuition fees of $3,327 in-state, $16,390 out-of-state, and Room/board of $8,280.[http://www.flbog.org/planning/2006-07Fees.pdf][http://iea.fau.edu/factbk/tuition06.htm] For comparison, the University of Florida has tuition fees of $3,370, University of Central Florida costs $3,432, and Florida State University costs $3,360 for in-state undergraduate tuition fees.[http://www.sfa.ufl.edu/apply/coa.html][http://finaid.ucf.edu/applying/app_costs.html][http://financialaid.fsu.edu/apply/cost_ungrad.html]

The Boca Raton campus remains the largest campus with 69% of FAU's students enrolled there.[http://www.fau.edu/academic/iea/inst/facts.htm] The Boca Raton campus and the Jupiter campus  are the only campuses that offer student housing. 

Since its founding, Florida Atlantic University has had [[List of Presidents of Florida Atlantic University|five presidents]]. President [[Frank T. Brogan]] became the fifth president in 2003 after resigning his position as the [[Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Florida]] under then [[Governor]] [[Jeb Bush]]. Brogan graduated from the [[University of Cincinnati]] and holds a master's degree from Florida Atlantic.

MacArthur campus of FAU in Jupiter, Florida. It offers a rigorous [[liberal arts]] education in the platform of a public institution; students work with a professor to develop and write an honors thesis. The Boca Raton campus houses the University Scholars Program, which offers special honors seminars, forums, courses, and advanced course substitution for freshman.

Florida Atlantic has gradually been increasing its admission standards since it opened its doors to freshman in 1984. Starting in the summer of 2004, FAU began denying entry to students with low GPA's and [[SAT]] scores. Prospective students were directed to take remedial courses at a [[community college]] to better prepate them for success at the university. The higher admissions standards included a 3.2 [[GPA]] and an SAT score of at least 1000 for admittance in 2007.<ref name="Admissions Standards"/> By 2007, the average high school GPA for an entering freshman was 3.3 and a 1052 on the SAT.<ref name="Facts"/> 

Today, the average class size for undergraduates is 32 people, and 11 people for graduate classes. Student to Faculty ratio is 19:1 with 98% of the faculty employed full-time. The top three undergraduate majors by enrollment are Elementary [[Education]], [[Management]], and [[Accounting]], respectively. The top three graduate majors by enrollment are [[Business Administration]], [[Nursing]], and [[Educational Leadership]]. The average age for first time in college students is 18, however, the average age for all undergraduates is 25. The average age for graduate students is 34.<ref name="Facts"/>

===Innovation Village===
{{see also|Florida Atlantic University Stadium}}

In an effort to create a traditional, first-choice college atmosphere, FAU worked with KUD International to develop an Innovation Village for its campus in Boca Raton. When completed in 2010, the Innovation Village will include new residence halls, workforce housing, restaurants, stores, parking garages, and a long-awaited 30,000-seat football stadium that will be home to the [[Florida Atlantic University Owls]] football team. It is envisioned that the Innovation Village will create a miniature "college town" within FAU [http://fausports.cstv.com/ot/ask-ad-responses.html]. The project will be completed in phases, with the housing and retail opening first in Fall 2008 and 2009 and the football stadium opening in Fall 2010.
