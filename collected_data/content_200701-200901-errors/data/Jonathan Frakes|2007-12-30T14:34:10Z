==Film and television career==
The 6 ft 4 inch (193 cm) Frakes moved to [[New York City]] and became a member of "The Impossible Ragtime Theater." In that company, Frakes did his first off-Broadway acting in  [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''The Hairy Ape''. His first Broadway appearance was in ''[[Shenandoah (musical)|Shenandoah]]''. At the same time, he landed a role in the [[NBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[The Doctors (1963 TV series)|The Doctors]]''. When his character was dismissed from the soap, Frakes moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] and played guest spots in many of the top television shows of the 1970s and [[1980s]], including ''[[The Waltons]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'',  ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'', and Steven Bochco's ''[[Hill Street Blues]]''. He played the part of [[Charles Lindbergh]] in a 1983 episode of ''[[Voyagers!]]'' titled "An Arrow Pointing East".  In [[1983]], he had a role in the short-lived [[NBC]] prime time [[soap opera]] ''[[Bare Essence]]'' (which also starred his future wife [[Genie Francis]]). He also had recurring roles in ''[[Falcon Crest]]'' and ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North & South]]'' before signing for the role of Riker on ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sylvia Lawler|publisher=The Morning Call|title=Making history: "North and South's" Jonathan Frakes is crafting his future{{ndash}} History yields a good part for Jonathan Frakes|location=Allentown, PA|date=[[May 5]], [[1986]]|pages=D.01|url=http://www.jf-fansite.de/interview08.htm}}</ref>

He has done [[animation]] [[voice acting]], most notably voicing the recurring role of [[David Xanatos]] in the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', and he provided the voice of his own head in a jar in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]." He hosted ''[[Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction]]'' and had a small, uncredited role in the 1994 movie ''[[Camp Nowhere]]''. He also reprised his role of Riker for a ''Next Generation'' cutaway on [[Peter's Got Woods|an episode of ''Family Guy'']] that also featured his co-stars [[Patrick Stewart]] and [[Michael Dorn]] as their respective roles of [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] and [[Worf]].

Frakes is one of only two ''Star Trek'' regulars to appear on four different ''Star Trek'' series (''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'').  (The only other regular to match or exceed that number is [[Majel Barrett-Roddenberry]] who appeared in all six television series.)  He has also directed episodes in three of them (''TNG'', ''DS9'' and ''VOY'') and was a popular and innovative director on the Star Trek set, often finding completely new ways to shoot the show's familiar sets.  His directing career has included the films ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]''.  Additionally, Frakes was an executive producer for the WB show ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]'', directed several episodes and guest-starred in three episodes.  His relationship with Star Trek is made light of in the episode "Secrets and Lies", in which the alien character Max ironically auditions for a guest role as an alien for ''Star Trek: Enterprise''.

Outside of acting, Frakes appeared on the [[Phish]] album ''[[Hoist (album)|Hoist]]'', playing [[trombone]] on the track titled "Riker's Mailbox." Frakes would occasionally perform on the trombone during his tenure as Commander Riker.
