'''Master Chief Petty Officer Spartan-117''', commonly called '''Master Chief''', and whose real name is known only as John, is the fictional protagonist in the [[Halo universe|''Halo'' universe]], created by [[Bungie Studios]]. He is the main character of the [[video game]] ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', and one of the two [[playable character]]s in its sequels, ''[[Halo 2]]'' and ''[[Halo 3]]''. Outside of video games, the Master Chief appears in the novels ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'', ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', and ''[[Halo: Uprising]]'', and has cameos in both ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'' and the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]''. He is voiced by [[Steve Downes]] in the [[video game]]s in which he appears.

The Master Chief is one of the most visible symbols of the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]]. Originally designed by Marcus Lehto, Rob McLees, and Shi Kai Wang, the character is towering but faceless; he is never seen without his armor or helmet. The character has been called an icon, and is one of a few recognizable game mascots, a relative newcomer who joins more established characters such as [[Mario]], [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], and [[Lara Croft]]; ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' named the Master Chief as the eighth greatest video game character ever.

==Character design==
[[Image:Masterchief sheik.png|thumb|right|upright|Shi Ki Wang's sketch which became the basis for the Master Chief]]
The task of developing the Master Chief for the character's first appearance in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' fell on Rob McLees and the project's Art Director, Marcus Lehto. Eventually, Shi Ki Wang was hired for conceptual art.<ref name=aoh20>{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |pages=20}}</ref> One of Wang's sketches was accepted and became the basis for the Master Chief. However, after Wang's version was converted to a 3-D model, it was decided the Master Chief looked too slender, "almost effeminate".<ref name=aoh20 /> The Master Chief was subsequently bulked up to the version currently found in the games.<ref name=aoh20 /> Similarly, the Chief's armor went through various changes, such as adding an antenna, which was removed later in development, and a green tint.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |title=One Million Years B.X. |author=Bungie|date=2006-02-10 |work=bungie.net|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060210224125/http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |archivedate=2006-02-10 }}</ref>

In an interview on creating believable video game characters, Bungie's [[Joseph Staten]] noted that, until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not considered how to immerse people in the world of ''Halo''. "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," he said, "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space marine in really cool green armor."<ref>{{cite web|author=Cifaldi, Frank|date=2005-05-26|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050526/cifaldi_01.shtml|title=E3 Report: Developing Better Characters, Better Stories|work=gamasutra.com|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>

Steve Downes, who voices the Master Chief, is a disc jockey and voice actor who had never played video games before ''Halo''.<ref name=interview1/> [[Martin O'Donnell]], Bungie's music director, had worked with Downes on a previous video game and recommended him for the part.<ref>{{cite web|author=KLind|date=2006-07-26|url=http://buttonbasher.wordpress.com/2006/07/27/interview-master-chief-steve-downes/|title=Interview with the Master Chief|work=buttonbasher.com|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> Downes has never appeared at Bungie or Microsoft events, and believes that the Master Chief is left masked because "[the character's identity] is really in the eye of the player".<ref name=interview2>Downes, Steven.

===Personality===
Steve Downes said that his voice acting was based entirely on Bungie's written character description provided, which specified a character similar to [[Clint Eastwood]] and of few words. In a [[podcast]] interview, the actor noted that, during the recording, he was given a fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief's personality.<ref name=interview1>Downes, Steven. [http://www.davidjamesdague.com/MC_Part1.mp3 Interview with "Xerxdeej"], ''tiedtheleader.com''. (2005-08-23).</ref> In the games, the Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him almost a [[silent protagonist]]. Even during cutscenes, the character generally speaks sparingly. Bungie Studios' Frank O'Connor has described the Chief as "so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they're the Chief. The player gets to inhabit those shoes [and] apply their own personality."<ref name=frank>{{cite web |url = http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/813/813227p2.html |title = IGN interview with Frankie O'connor |accessdate = 2007-09-02 |author = Kolan, Patrick |date = 2006-09-02 |format =|work = ign.com }}</ref>  Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described the Master Chief as "pretty much the consummate professional.

Entirely encased in heavy armor and standing seven feet tall, the Chief inspires awe and terror in friends and foes alike.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=15}}</ref> Despite his cold exterior, Master Chief cares about his fellow soldiers, especially the Spartans with whom he trained.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0|pages=18}}</ref>. During his training, the Master Chief was originally taught by [[Master Chief Petty Officer]] [[List of Halo characters|Franklin Mendez]] to sacrifice lives only when it was deemed necessary and to make sure that said sacrifices weren't meaningless using the terms "the difference between wasting lives and spending lives" <ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=63}}</ref>.

===Outward appearance===
In the video games, the Master Chief is never seen without his armor. In the last cutscene of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the Chief removes his helmet, but the camera pans and his face is never seen; Bungie Studios did this intentionally to allow the player to better become the Master Chief.<ref name=time/> The only physical description of the Master Chief comes from the novels. in ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', the Chief is described during a briefing as tall with short hair, serious eyes, and strong features.<ref name=tf80 /> His skin is "too white", testifying to the amount of time he spends in his armor.<ref name=tf80>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=80}}</ref> Inside his armor, the Master Chief stands about seven feet tall and weighs half a ton;<ref>{{cite book | year=2004 | editor=Bungie | title=''Halo 2'' Instruction Manual | pages=8 | publisher=Microsoft Game Studios|language=English}}</ref> without it, the Chief still stands 6&nbsp;feet, 6&nbsp;inches (1.98&nbsp;m) tall and weighs 287&nbsp;pounds (130&nbsp;kg).<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=205}}</ref>

===''Halo: The Fall of Reach''===
The Master Chief's backstory is never explained in the video games. However, the novel ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach|The Fall of Reach]]'', which serves as a prequel to the events of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', reveals much of the character's history. In the [[Halo universe]], this is the Master Chief's first chronological appearance; the book itself was released in [[2001]] as a companion to ''Halo''. The Master Chief, originally named John, was born in 2511 and spent the first part of his childhood on the human colony planet Eridanus 2, where he lived with his family. John was large for his six years of age, approximately a foot above his school peers. At this age he is described as a typical boy, having brown hair, freckles and a gap in between his two front teeth.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=24}}</ref> In 2517, John and seventy-four other children his age are covertly taken from their homes and replaced with [[United Nations Space Command#Flash clones|flash clones]] to hide the kidnapping. The original children are brought to planet [[Reach (Halo)|Reach]], one of the [[United Nations Space Command|UNSC]]'s headquarters, to train to become [[SPARTAN-II]] supersoldiers.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=35}}</ref> On Reach, the children begin intensive physical, mental and psychological training as part of the Spartan program by Chief Petty Officer [[Characters in the Halo series#Franklin Mendez|Franklin Mendez]], and are assigned new identification numbers instead of last names; John becomes known as John-117.

These procedures had substantial risks,<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=56}}</ref> and only John and thirty-two other Spartans survive.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=60}}</ref>

[[Image:Masterchief-and-company.png|thumb|right|Master Chief (left), [[Cortana]], and [[Characters in the Halo series#Jacob Keyes|Captain Keyes]] aboard the ''Pillar of Autumn''.]]
The Master Chief's first appearance in the games is as the [[protagonist]] in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. In ''Halo: The Flood'', the [[2003]] novelization of the video game, the Chief is likewise the main character. The Master Chief first appears being awoken from cryosleep during the opening cinematic of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. Upon coming out of [[slipspace]], the ''[[Pillar of Autumn]]'' is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]]. Master Chief escapes the ship via a lifeboat. Upon landing on the surface of the ring, his first task is finding survivors from the crash. During the midst of fighting the Covenant, Master Chief and [[Cortana]] discover that Halo was created by the [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunners]] as a last line of defense against an alien parasite called [[Flood (Halo)|The Flood]].<ref name=bigblow/> The Flood is accidentally unleashed by the Covenant and begin to spread across the ring.<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark''': Greetings.

However, Guilty Spark neglects to inform Master Chief that Halo would accomplish this by destroying all sentient life in a vast radius, essentially starving the Flood to death.<ref name=bigblow>'''Cortana''': You have no idea how this ring works, do you? Why the forerunners built it? Halo doesn't kill flood, it kills their food. Humans, covenant, whatever. We're all equally edible. The only way to stop the flood is to starve them to death. And that's exactly what Halo is designed to do; wipe the galaxy clean of all sentient life. You don't believe me? Ask him. / '''Master Chief''': Is this true? / '''343 Guilty Spark''': More or less. Technically, this installation's pulse has a maximum effective radius of twenty-five thousand light years. But, once the others follow suit, this galaxy will be quite devoid of life, or at least any life with sufficient biomass to sustain the flood. (pause) But you already knew that.

''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', the [[2003]] novel by [[Eric Nylund]], picks up the Master Chief's story soon after the events of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' and serves as a bridge between the events of ''Halo'' and ''Halo 2''.

The Chief retrieves his fellow soldiers, as well as [[Characters in the Halo series#Catherine Halsey|Dr. Catherine Halsey]], the creative genius behind the [[SPARTAN-II]] project.

===''Halo: Uprising'' and ''Halo 3''===
{{see also|Halo 3}}
[[Image:Halo3chief.jpg|thumb|right|The Master Chief as depicted in ''Halo 3'', during the first mission, "Sierra 117".]]
The Master Chief appears as a main character in Marvel's [[limited series]] ''[[Halo: Uprising]]'', breaking into a Covenant-held Forerunner structure before being captured by the Covenant.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bendis|first= Brian Michael|title=[[Halo: Uprising]], Book 1|year= 2007|publisher= [[Marvel Comics]]|location=New York |pages=20}}</ref> The comic, like ''First Strike'', serves as a bridge between two video games, ''Halo 2'' and ''Halo 3'', in which Master Chief is once again the main character.

Back on Earth following the events of ''Halo 2'' and ''Uprising'', the Master Chief helps repel hostile Covenant forces from [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]] and [[Voi]]. Together with the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] and fellow allies, the Chief spearheads the assault on a [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] artifact the Prophet of [[Hierarchs (Halo)#High Prophet of Truth|Truth]] is attempting to activate.

The allied [[Covenant Elite|Elite]]s and humans decide to activate the ''new'' Halo in order to finish the Flood outside the galaxy, and thus preserve the life there. The Forerunner [[Forerunner (Halo)#Monitors|Monitor]] [[343 Guilty Spark]] does not wish for the incomplete installation to be prematurely fired and risk its own destruction, and attempts to stop the firing. The Master Chief destroy the Monitor and activates the ring, and escapes along with [[Cortana]] and the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] on the UNSC frigate ''Forward Unto Dawn''. During the rush to the escape, a portion of the ''Dawn'' is severed by the collapsing slipspace portal, stranding [[Cortana]] and the Master Chief while the Arbiter returns to Earth. Cortana activates a distress beacon, knowing that it could be years before anyone finds them; thus, Master Chief goes into [[cryonics|cryogenic sleep]] to await their rescue. As the hatch closes, Cortana sadly confides to Chief that she will miss him, but his last words to her before entering suspended animation are "Wake me, when you need me."<ref>{{cite video game| title = [[Halo 3]]| developer = Bungie Studios| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2007| platform =[[Xbox 360]]| version = | level = Halo| language = English}}</ref>

==Appearances in other media==

==Impact and reception==

''[[BusinessWeek]]'' pointed to the Master Chief as one of several video game characters who has been branded beyond the respective video game, "helping them transcend the very medium in the process".<ref>{{cite web|author=Snow, Black|date=2007-08-03|url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/aug2007/id2007083_351181.htm|title=Game Icons We Love|work=businessweek.com|accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> The Master Chief has been used in marketing on a variety of products, from [[7-Eleven]] [[Slurpee|Slurpees]] to t-shirts, [[Xbox 360]] controllers, and [[Mountain Dew]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Brudvig, Erik|date=2007-07-31|url=http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/809/809612p1.html |title=Halo 3 Box Arrives at IGN Offices |accessdate=2007-08-22 |work=ign.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.xbox360rally.com/reserve-halo-3-at-7-11-today/ |title=Reserve Halo 3 at 7-11 TODAY! |accessdate=2007-08-22 |date=2007-08-06 |work=xbox360rally.com}}</ref> The Master Chief has been the subject of several [[action figure]]s related to marketing of the ''Halo'' series; the most recent were manufactured by McFarlane.<ref>{{cite web|author=Plunkett, Luke|date=2007-09-12|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/gallery/mcfarlane-halo-3-figures-298838.php|title=McFarlane Halo 3 figures|work=kotaku.com|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> These actions have been described as necessary to the game franchise.

Reaction to the Master Chief as a character is generally mixed. Reviewers alternatively view the character's silent nature as a strength, or as not fleshing out the character in terms of believability.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bear, Erik|date=2004-12-16|url=http://www.sfhomeworld.org/make_contact/article.asp?articleID=164|title=''Halo 2'' vs ''Half Life 2''|work=sfhomeworld.org|accessdate=2007-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Crecente, Brian|date=2007-09-24|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/feature/halo-3-review-300345.php|title=Feature: ''Halo 3'' Review|work=kotaku.com|accessdate=2007-09-28}}</ref> Other critics perceive the Chief as a [[stock character|stock]] action hero, with little added dimension.<ref name=free>{{cite web|author=Team Freemont|year=2004|url=http://www.teamfremont.com/reviews/Halo2.shtml|title=Team Freemont: Halo 2 review|work=teamfremont.com|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref>
