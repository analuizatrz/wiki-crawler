The '''M1917 Revolver''' (formally United States Revolver, Caliber .45, M1917) was a U.S. six-shot [[revolver]] of [[.45 ACP]] caliber. It was adopted by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1917 to supplement the standard [[M1911 Colt pistol|M1911]] .45 ACP [[semi-automatic pistol]] during WWI. Afterwards, it was primarily used by secondary and non-deployed troops.  There were two variationsof the M1917, one from Colt and one from S&W.

== Background ==
U.S. civilian arms companies of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] and [[Remington Arms|Remington]] as well as other companies were producing M1911 pistols under contract for the U.S. Army, but even with the additional production there existed a shortage of M1911s.  The interim solution was to ask the two major producers of revolvers to adapt their heavy-frame civilian revolvers to the standard [[.45 ACP]] pistol [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].

=== Colt M1917 revolver ===
Colt had until recently produced a revolver for the U.S. Army called the [[M1909]], a version of their heavy-frame, .45-caliber, [[New Service]] model in [[.45 Long Colt]] to supplement and replace a range of 1890s-era [[.38 Long Colt]] Colt and [[Smith & Wesson]] revolvers that had demonstrated inadequate [[stopping power]] during the [[Philippine-American War]].  The Colt M1917 Revolver was essentially the same as the M1909 with a cylinder bored to take the .45 ACP cartridge and the half-moon clips to hold the rimless autopistol rounds in position.  In the early Colt production revolvers, attempting to fire the .45 ACP without the half-moon clips was unreliable at best, as the cartridge could slip forward into the cylinder and away from the firing pin. The later production Colt M1917 revolvers had headspacing machined into the cylinder chambers, just as the Smith & Wesson M1917 revolvers had from the start. The later versions of the Colt production could be fired without the half-moon clips, but the empty cartridge cases had to be ejected with a device such as a cleaning rod or pencil, as the cylinder extractor and ejector would pass over the rims of the rimless cartridges.

=== Smith & Wesson M1917 revolver ===

[[Smith & Wesson]] recently (c. 1915-16) had produced a rugged service revolver on their heavy .44 caliber frame for the British Army in [[.455 Webley]] caliber, due to shortages in British production facilities of standard-issue [[Webley Revolver|Webley Mk VI]] [[Revolver#Top break|top-break]] revolvers.  The S&W conversion was similar to the Colt modification, except the cylinder was machined to [[headspace]] the cartridge.  In the Smith and Wesson, the .45 ACP could be fired with or without the half-moon clips.

== Later Use ==

After the First World War, M1917s became popular on the civilian market.  Some were military surplus.  Others were newly manufactured.  Smith and Wesson kept their version in production, for civilian sales, until they replaced it with their Model 1950 Target.

Many civilian shooters disliked using half-moon clips.  For this reason, in 1920, the Peters ammunition company introduced a rimmed variation of the .45 ACP cartridge under the name .45 Auto Rim.  It allowed both versions of the Model 1917 revolver to fire reliably without the clips.

The military service of the M1917 did not end with the First World War.  In the mid-1930s, Brazil ordered many thousands of M1917s for their military.    Now out of service and sold as surplus, Brazilian M1917s are sometimes seen in gun stores in the United States.  They can be identified by the large Brazilian crest stamped on their sideplates.

The M1917 also remained in US service through WWII and was still in use with some reserve units as late as the Vietnam War {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.
