{{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy VII'''''|ファイナルファンタジーVII|Fainaru Fantajī Sebun}} is a [[console role-playing game]] developed by [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] as the seventh installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. It was released in 1997 for Sony's [[PlayStation]] and in 1998 for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[personal computer]]s. The game is the first in the series to use [[3D computer graphics]], featuring fully [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] characters on [[pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds.

Set in a [[dystopia]]n world, ''Final Fantasy VII''{{'}}s story centers on the powerful [[megacorporation]] [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra]], which is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. Players follow a young mercenary named [[Cloud Strife]], who joins with several others to stop Shinra. Later in the story, the main antagonist, [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], develops a plan to summon a meteor with the intention of injuring the planet to a point where it would gather massive amounts of its life force in one spot. This would allow Sephiroth to collect all the life force and gain control of all living beings.

Development of ''Final Fantasy VII'' began in 1994 and the game was originally intended for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], but it was later moved to the [[Nintendo 64]]. As the system's cartridges lacked space, Square decided to release the game for Sony's PlayStation instead. The music was scored by ''Final Fantasy'' veteran [[Nobuo Uematsu]], while the series' long-time character designer, [[Yoshitaka Amano]], was replaced by [[Tetsuya Nomura]].

The game was a major critical and commercial success, and remains arguably one of the most popular titles in the series. As of December 2005, ''Final Fantasy VII'' has sold more than 9.8&nbsp;million copies worldwide, earning it the position of the best-selling ''Final Fantasy'' title and the [[List of best-selling video games#PlayStation|second-best-selling PlayStation game of all-time]]. The ongoing popularity of the title led Square Enix to produce a series of sequels and prequels under the collective title ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]''. 

==Gameplay==
Like previous installments of the ''Final Fantasy'' series, ''Final Fantasy VII'' consists of three basic gameplay modes: an [[overworld]] map, town and [[dungeon crawl|dungeon]] field maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down simplified version of the game's fictional world<ref name="travel">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=15, 44–46 | publisher=Sony computer entertainment|id=SCUS-94163}}</ref> which the player navigates to travel between the game's locations. It is the first ''Final Fantasy'' game to have character models with fully-rendered [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]], rather than flat two-dimensional [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. As with the preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, [[chocobo]] (ostrich-like birds), airship, or submarine.<ref name="travel"/> On field maps, the game's three-dimensional [[player character|playable characters]] are directed across realistically scaled environments, consisting of 2D pre-rendered backgrounds which represent locations such as towns or forests.<ref name="gamespotreview">{{cite web | author=Kasavin, Greg | date=1997-09-27 | title=Final Fantasy VII for PlayStation Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasy7/review.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, such as a building's interior or open grassland, in which the player commands the game's characters in battles against [[central processing unit|CPU]]-controlled enemies through a menu-driven interface.<ref>{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=20–25 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts |id=SCUS-94163}}</ref> While characters are [[super deformed]] on maps, the character models are more realistic and normal-scaled in combat.<ref name="Hist of FF7"/>

Initially, the player is restricted to explore the city of Midgar, but as the game progresses, the entire world becomes accessible to the player.<ref name="travel"/> Progression through the game's storyline is largely developed by way of scripted sequences, although pre-rendered cinematic [[cut scene]]s sometimes also advance the story.<ref name="Hist of FF7"/>

[[Image:FFVIIbattlexample.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A battle in ''Final Fantasy VII'']]

===Combat===
During its turn-based battle sequences, the game uses the same "[[Final Fantasy#Battle system|Active Time Battle]]" (ATB) system designed by [[Hiroyuki Itō]] and first featured in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Unlike previous games in the series, which allow 4-5 playable characters to participate in battle, ''Final Fantasy VII'' allows only three characters to be in the party at any time.<ref name="ignreview">{{cite web | first=Jay |last=Boor | date=1997-09-03 | title=Final Fantasy VII Review | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150494p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy VII''{{'}}s [[statistic (role-playing games)#Skills|skill system]] is built around the use of [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Materia|materia]], magical orbs that are placed in special slots on weapons and armor, allowing players to customize their characters' access to [[common elements of Final Fantasy#Magic|magic spells]], summons, and special abilities. Magic and summon materia also make the characters physically weaker. In addition to their individual attributes, materia can be used together in a fixed number of ways to enhance their effects or produce other abilities.<ref>{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=35 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | id=SCUS-94163}}</ref>

A modified form of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''{{'}}s "[[desperation attack|Desperation Attacks]]" appears in ''Final Fantasy VII'' as the "[[common elements of Final Fantasy#Battle systems and Limit Breaks|Limit Break]]". Every playable character has a bar that gradually fills up when they suffer damage in battle. When the bar is completely filled, the character is able to unleash his or her Limit Break, a special attack which generally inflicts significantly more damage on enemies than normal attacks, or otherwise aids the party in battle.<ref name="Hist of FF7">{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/870/870770p1.html|title=IGN Presents: The History of Final Fantasy VII|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Rus|last=McLaughlin|date=2008-04-30|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> Unlike materia, which any character could use, each character has their own unique Limit Breaks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/494/page_2.html|title=Guides: Final Fantasy VII &ndasg; Characters|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Finn|last=White|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> In addition, elaborately animated summon spells were incorporated in the game, and are also present in future games in the series.

===Setting===
{{main|Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)}}
The game's setting follows in the footsteps of ''Final Fantasy VI'' by presenting a world with considerably more advanced technology than the first five games in the series. Overall, the game's technology and society approximates that of near-future [[science fiction]].<ref>{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Editors of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine | title=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine August 2001; issue 47 | pages=16 | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> The world of ''Final Fantasy VII'', retroactively named "Gaia" but referred to in the game as "The Planet", is composed of three main land masses. The eastern continent features the city of Midgar, an industrial [[metropolis]] that serves as the headquarters of the [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra Electric Power Company]], a ruthless [[megacorporation]] operating as the ''[[de facto]]'' [[world government]]. Other locations on the continent are Junon, Shinra's major military base; Fort Condor, a fort with a huge condor covering up a Mako reactor on top of it; a chocobo ranch; and Kalm, a small town inspired by medieval Europe.

The western continent features most of the accessible areas, which include the Gold Saucer, an amusement park; Costa Del Sol, a seaside resort; Nibelheim, a town residing at the base of Mt. Nibel; Rocket Town, the location of Shinra's failed rocket launch; and a settlement called Cosmo Canyon. Wutai, a village inspired by pre-modern Japan and China, is located on a large island off the western continent. The tribe inhabiting Cosmo Canyon emphasize living in harmony with nature and dedicating causes to the planet's well-being.<ref name="cosmo">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=217 | language=Japanese|publisher=Square Enix|isbn=4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> Their settlement features an [[observatory]] and serves as a research facility for those who wish to participate in a philosophy known as the "Study of Planet Life", a lifestyle that encourages deference for nature and teaches that the planet has a life of its own.<ref name="cosmo"/> The northernmost continent is a heavily [[glacier|glaciated]] wasteland, and its few settlements include an excavation site; a ski resort; the mythical "City of the Ancients"; and the Northern Crater, where the game's [[climax (narrative)|climax]] takes place. There are also underwater locations accessible via submarine, such as a sunken plane transporter.

The game's character designer, [[Tetsuya Nomura]], has expressed that ''Final Fantasy VII'' was hindered by graphical limitations, and as such his designs were very plain in comparison to his real style. Cloud's original design of slicked back black hair with no spikes was intended to serve as a contrast to Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair. Nomura feared that such masculinity could prove to be unpopular with fans, and therefore he changed Cloud's design to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair. Tifa's outfit with her dark miniskirt was designed to contrast Aeris' long, pink dress. Vincent's character developed from horror researcher to detective, then to chemist, and finally to the figure of a former Turk with a tragic past. Nomura has indicated that Cid Highwind's fighting style resembles that of a [[Final Fantasy character classes#Dragoon|Dragon Knight]], a [[character class]] which was chosen because his last name is the same as that of two previous Dragon Knights featured in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, Ricard Highwind of ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' and Kain Highwind of ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''.<ref name="Hist of FF7"/>

Due to their popularity, several characters from ''Final Fantasy VII'' have made [[cameo appearance]]s in other Square Enix titles, most notably the [[fighting game]] ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'' and the popular ''Final Fantasy''-[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] crossover series ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]''. Sephiroth remains one of the most popular villains in video game history, unanimously voted #1 by the staff of gaming publication ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' in their "Top 10 Video Game Bosses" list in October 2005,<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Editors of EGM magazine | title=Electronic Gaming Monthly October, 2005 | pages=72–73 | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> and winning [[GameFAQs]]' best villain contest in spring of the same year.<ref>{{cite web | title=Spring 2005: Got Villains? | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/spr05 | publisher=[[GameFAQs]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>

===Story===
''Final Fantasy VII'' begins with Cloud joining AVALANCHE in a series of raids against the Mako reactors surrounding the city of Midgar.  Although the first mission is successful, AVALANCHE is trapped at another reactor during a subsequent raid. The reactor explodes, launching Cloud from the upper levels of Midgar into the slums below. He lands on a flower bed, where he is formally introduced to Aeris.<ref>'''Aeris:''' You okay? This is a church in the Sector 5 slums. [You] suddenly fell on top of me. You really gave me quite a scare. / '''Cloud:''' ...…I came crashing down? / '''Aeris:''' The roof and the flower bed must have broken your fall. You're lucky. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> Prompted by the arrival of Shinra's Turks operatives sent to capture Aeris, Cloud agrees to be Aeris's bodyguard and defends her from the Turks.<ref>'''Aeris:''' Say, Cloud. Have you ever been a bodyguard? You DO do everything, right? / '''Cloud:''' Yeah, that's right. / '''Aeris:''' Then, get me out of here. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> After meeting up with Tifa in Sector 7, they infiltrate the mansion of crime boss [[Characters of Final Fantasy VII#Don Corneo|Don Corneo]]. The party learns that Shinra has discovered the location of AVALANCHE's hideout and plans to collapse the upper plate of Sector 7 onto the slums below.<ref>'''Don Corneo:''' Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, and want to infiltrate their hideout. And they're really going to crush them… literally. By breaking the support holding up the plate above them. / '''Tifa:''' Break the support!? / '''Don Corneo:''' You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PING and everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the Sector 7 Slums… {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> Shinra destroys Sector 7, killing its population and three members of AVALANCHE.

The sole survivor. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> a race closely attuned with the planet, and previously thought extinct. President Shinra believes Aeris can lead him to the "Promised Land", a mythical land of fertility, where he expects to find Mako energy.<ref>'''President Shinra:''' She's the last surviving Ancient… Don't you know? They called themselves the Cetra, and lived thousands of years ago. Now they are just a forgotten page in history. / '''Red XIII:''' Cetra… That girl, is she a survivor of the Cetra? / '''President Shinra:''' Cetra, or the Ancients will show us the way to the 'Promised Land.' I'm expecting a lot out of her. / '''Red XIII:''' The Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend? / '''President Shinra:''' Even so, it's just too appealing to not to pursue. It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile. …If the land is fertile… / '''Barret:''' Then there's gotta be Mako! / '''President Shinra:''' Exactly.

The abundant Mako will just come out on its own. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref>

The remaining members of AVALANCHE infiltrate Shinra's headquarters to rescue Aeris. After freeing her and Red XIII, they escape when most of the personnel in the building—including President Shinra—are killed.  Cloud suspects that Sepiroth, a man presumed to be dead, was behind the attack, suspicions confirmed by an executive who claims to have witnessed Sephiroth murder the president and state that he would never allow Shinra to claim the Promised Land.<ref>'''Cloud:''' Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth? / '''Palmer:''' Yeah, I saw him!! I saw him with my own eyes! / '''Cloud:''' You really saw him? / '''Palmer:''' Uh! Would I lie to you at a time like this!? And I heard his voice too! Um, he was saying something about not letting us have the Promised Land. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> The party also learns that during Sephiroth's attack on Shinra, the headless body of a creature named "Jenova" disappeared from the building's research facility.<ref>'''Cloud:''' …Did it get away? Jenova…? / '''Red XIII:''' Jenova Specimen… Looks like it went to the upper floor using that elevator for the specimens. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> While the president's son, Rufus Shinra, assumes control of the company, AVALANCHE pursues Sephiroth across the planet, fearing his intentions for the Promised Land may be more destructive than Shinra's. The party is joined by Yuffie, Cait Sith, Vincent, and Cid. Each member of the group must come to terms with personal conflicts from their past. The full scope of Sephiroth's plan is eventually revealed: if the world is significantly damaged, the Lifestream within will gather in an attempt to heal the wound. Sephiroth intends to use a powerful spell called "Meteor" to fatally injure the planet, inciting a reaction in the Lifestream to safeguard the planet. Sephiroth would then merge with all of the planet's energy, allowing him to be reborn as a god and rule over the planet.<ref>'''Aeris:''' How do you intend to become one with the Planet? / '''Sephiroth:''' It's simple. Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the injury. The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the injury. …What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the very life of the Planet? Think how much energy would be gathered! Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me. All that boundless energy will be mine. By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a new life form, a new existence. Melding with the Planet… I will cease to exist as I am now. Only to be reborn as a 'God' to rule over every soul. / '''Aeris:''' An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet?

The Ultimate Destructive Magic… Meteor. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref>

[[Image:FFVIIsephirothkillsaeris.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sephiroth kills Aeris in a scene referred to as "the most shocking moment in video games".<ref>{{cite web | last= Gouskos|first=Carrie | title=Lucky Seven | url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/6155700/index.html| accessdate=2008-09-06|publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref>]]

At an ancient temple created by the Cetra, AVALANCHE attempts to undermine Sephiroth's plot by claiming the Black Materia needed to activate Meteor, but Sephiroth displays a mysterious power over Cloud, forcing him to relinquish it. Fearing Sephiroth may cast Meteor, Aeris sets off to stop him on her own. AVALANCHE follows her to the northern continent, where they enter an ancient Cetra city. After finding Aeris praying to the planet for aid, Sephiroth begins affecting Cloud's behavior, and attempts to force him to kill her. Cloud resists Sephiroth's command, but Sephiroth appears and kills Aeris.<ref name="development3"/> After laying her body to rest, the party resolves to defeat Sephiroth.

Cloud, however, begins to doubt his ability to control his own actions. Influenced by Sephiroth, Cloud becomes suspicious of his memories and insists he is not a real human, but instead a specimen created from Jenova's genetic material by [[Characters of Final Fantasy VII#Professor Hojo|Professor Hojo]]. Jenova was an interstellar creature who crash landed on the planet roughly 2,000 years prior to the the game's events. Jenova had intended to infect all living organisms on the planet with a virus inducing insanity and monstrous transformations;<ref name="jenova">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=210–215 | language=Japanese|publisher=Square Enix|isbn=4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> among its victims were most of the Cetra. Attempting to defend itself, the planet created giant monsters called "WEAPONs". The majority of humans fled rather than fight Jenova; however, a small group of Cetra survivors managed to defeat and confine Jenova.<ref>'''Ifalna:''' A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova, and confined it. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> Eventually, the remains of Jenova were unearthed by [[Characters of Final Fantasy VII#Professor Gast|Professor Gast]], a researcher for the Shinra Company. Mistaking the creature for a Cetra, Gast was given authorization to conduct an experiment to artificially produce a Cetra by combining cells from Jenova with the fetus of an unborn child.<ref name="jenova"/> Sephiroth learned that he was the product of this experiment while on a Shinra mission in Cloud and Tifa's hometown, Nibelheim. He concluded that he was a Cetra who had been produced solely from Jenova's genetic material. He burned down Nibelheim, intending to kill all descendants of those he believed had abandoned his ancestors in the defense of the planet. Cloud confronted Sephiroth during this massacre, after which Sephiroth vanished under unknown circumstances and was presumed dead until his reappearance in the Shinra building. When AVALANCHE travels to the Northern Crater to confront Sephiroth, he tells Cloud that he was not in Nibelheim, showing him images of a SOLDIER with dark hair who occupies Cloud's place in his memories.<ref>'''Cloud:''' Sephiroth! I know you're listening! I know what you want to say! That I wasn't in Nibelheim five years ago. That's it, isn't it? / '''Sephiroth:''' I see you finally understand. / '''Cloud:''' But, I want to ask you one thing. Why… why are you doing this? / '''Sephiroth:''' Ha, ha, ha…… I want to take you back to your real self. The one who gave me the Black Materia that day… Who would have ever thought a failed experiment would prove so useful? Hojo would die if he knew. / '''Cloud:''' Hojo!? What does he have to do with me!? / '''Sephiroth:''' Five years ago you were… …constructed by Hojo, piece by piece, right after Nibelheim was burnt. A puppet made up of vibrant Jenova cells, her knowledge, and the power of Mako. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> With Tifa unable to refute Sephiroth's claims, Cloud surrenders the Black Materia to Sepiroth, allowing him to cast Meteor. This in turn results in the WEAPONs' awakening. During the earthquake that follows, Cloud is separated from his companions and falls into the Lifestream.

As the meteor summoned by Sephiroth slowly approaches the planet, the Shinra Company focuses its efforts on protecting humanity from the WEAPONs.<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=58 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | isbn=4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> Meanwhile, the members of AVALANCHE obtain Cid's airship, the ''Highwind'', and begin searching for Cloud. They find him in a [[catatonia|catatonic]] state on a tropical resort where he washed up following the casting of Meteor. The WEAPONs' destructive activity causes the island to split open, depositing Cloud and Tifa into the Lifestream, where she reconstructs Cloud's memories and learns the truth about his past. It is revealed that Cloud never succeeded in joining SOLDIER, and that the dark-haired SOLDIER from his memories was actually Aeris's first boyfriend, [[Zack Fair]]. Zack, Tifa, and Cloud had fought Sepiroth during the latter's attack on Nibelheim. Although Tifa and Zack were defeated, Cloud and Sephiroth severely wounded one another. After decapitating Jenova, Sephiroth is thrown into the Lifestream by Cloud, taking the creature's head with him. Rather than dying, his body and consciousness were crystallized in Mako inside Jenova's crater.

Cloud and Zack were among the wounded survivors who were apprehended by Shinra as part of a [[cover-up]] of Sephiroth's massacre. Professor Hojo subjected these survivors to an experiment, performing the same enhancements given to SOLDIER members—a procedure which included Mako showers and the injection of Jenova cells. All but Zack entered a [[coma]]tose state, and nearly five years later, Zack broke free from his confinement and took Cloud with him. However, the alien cells inhabiting Cloud's body also allowed Sephiroth to modulate his behavior. Moreover, the cells' ability to duplicate information allowed Cloud's mind to construct a false persona built around Zack's behavior, leading him to believe that he had been the 1st Class SOLDIER in Nibelheim. Zack was killed outside Midgar by Shinra soldiers after saving Cloud's life; during Zack's final moments, he tells Cloud to live both of their lives. Afterward, Tifa discovered Cloud, who was wearing Zack's SOLDIER uniform, and offered him a job with AVALANCHE.<ref name="jenova"/>

After Cloud awakens, it is revealed that Aeris, in her final moments, was casting the spell "Holy" with the White Materia, the only means of opposing Meteor. Although she succeeded, Sephiroth had since prevented the spell from taking effect.

==Development==
Planning sessions for ''Final Fantasy VII'' began in 1994 after the release of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''. At the time, the game was planned to be another 2D project for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Editors of Level magazine | year=2008 |month=May |title=Yoshinori Kitase interview |journal=Level |issue=25 |publisher=Reset Media |language=Swedish |accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref> Series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] intended the story to take place in modern [[New York City]] in the year 1999. Several of the staff members were working in parallel on ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', and development for ''Final Fantasy VII'' was interrupted when the other project became important enough to require the help of [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and other designers. Some of the ideas originally considered for ''Final Fantasy VII'' ended up in ''Chrono Trigger'' instead. Other ideas, such as the New York setting and the sorceress character [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Edea|Edea]], were kept unused until the later projects ''[[Parasite Eve (video game)|Parasite Eve]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bjarneby |first=Tobias |year=2006 |month=April |title=De missanpassade |journal=Level |issue=1 |pages=38–46 | publisher=Reset Media |language=Swedish|accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref> The original script of ''Final Fantasy VII'', which was written by Sakaguchi, was completely different from the finished product. [[Tetsuya Nomura]] recalled how Sakaguchi "wanted to do something like a detective story". The first part of the story involved a character named "Hot Blooded Detective Joe" who was in pursuit of the main characters. The main characters managed to blow up the city of Midgar, which had already been developed for the story.<ref>{{cite web| title= FFVII Not Being Remade -- Nomura| publisher=[[IGN]]|author=IGN Staff|date=2007-06-04|accessdate=2008-04-15|url= http://ps3.ign.com/articles/793/793956p1.html}}</ref>

Development of ''Final Fantasy VII'' resumed in late 1995,<ref name="development3"/> and required the efforts of approximately 120 artists and programmers, using [[PowerAnimator]] and [[Softimage 3D|Softimage|3D]] software and a budget of more than [[United States dollar|US$]]30 million.<ref>{{cite web | last=Vestal|first=Andrew | title=The History of Final Fantasy | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec1_7_2.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> ''Final Fantasy VI''{{'}}s co-director and scenario writer, Kitase, returned to direct and co-write ''Final Fantasy VII'' and was concerned the franchise might be left behind if it did not catch up to the [[3D computer graphics]] used in other games at the time.<ref name="development5">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly | title=Electronic Gaming Monthly October 2005; issue 196 | pages=104|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> Production began after the making of a short, experimental [[tech demo]] called "''[[Final Fantasy VI#Interactive CG Game|Final Fantasy SGI]]''" for [[Silicon Graphics, Inc.]] Onyx workstations. The demo featured [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]]-based 3D renderings of characters from ''Final Fantasy VI'' in a [[real time (media)|real time]] battle.<ref name="development7">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy SGI Demo | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/affw/ffsgi.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]]|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> This experiment led the development team to integrate these design mechanics into ''Final Fantasy VII.'' However, as a result of the high quantity of memory storage required to implement the motion data, only the [[CD-ROM]] format would be able to suit the project's needs.<ref name="development3"/> [[Nintendo]], for which Square had developed all previous titles in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, had decided to continue to use [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridges]] for its upcoming [[Nintendo 64]] console. This eventually led to a dispute that resulted in Square ending its long, tumultuous, relationship with Nintendo, and Square announced on January 12, 1996 it would be developing ''Final Fantasy VII'' for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]] platform.<ref name="development6">{{cite web | last=Sutherland|first=Kenny| title=Elusions: Final Fantasy 64 | url=http://www.lostlevels.org/200510/ | publisher=Lost Levels | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>

The transition from [[2D computer graphics]] to 3D environments overlaid on [[pre-rendered]] backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation. While the extra storage capacity and computer graphics gave the team the means to implement more than 40 minutes of [[full motion video]] movies, this innovation brought with it the added difficulty of ensuring that the inferiority of the in-game graphics in comparison to the full motion video sequences was not too obvious. Kitase has described the process of making the in-game environments as detailed as possible to be "a daunting task".<ref name="development3">{{cite book | year=2003 | editor=Editors of Edge magazine | title=Edge May 2003; issue 123 | pages=108–113 | publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref> The series' long-time character designer, [[Yoshitaka Amano]], was busy opening art workshops and exhibitions in France and New York, which limited his involvement in the game. This issue was addressed by bringing Nomura on board as the project's main artist, while Amano aided in the design of the game's world map.<ref name="Hist of FF7"/> Previously a monster designer for ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'', Nomura's style was more reminiscent of [[manga]], and as such it was easier for the 3D designers to build the character models based on his artwork.

In early August 1996, a demonstration disc called "''Square's Preview Extra''" was released in Japan as a bonus pack-in with the PlayStation game ''[[Tobal No. 1]]''. The disc contained the earliest playable demo of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and previews of other upcoming games such as ''[[Bushido Blade (video game)|Bushido Blade]]'' and ''[[SaGa Frontier]]''. The demo allowed players to play through the first part of Midgar. However, there were some noticeable differences from the final version, namely that Aeris was not featured in the initial party and that the ability to use Summons had not yet been implemented.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Square's Preview Extra |developer=Square Co |publisher=SquareSoft |date=1996-08-06 |platform=PlayStation |language=Japanese}}</ref>

The game's release in North America was preceded by a massive three-month marketing campaign, which consisted of three 30-second television commercials on major networks, a holiday promotion with [[Pepsi]], and printed ads in publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'', ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'' and comic books published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC]].<ref>{{cite web | month=August | year=1997 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_August_27/ai_19701566 | title=PlayStation's Final Fantasy VII Marketing Blitz Continues | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[Business Wire]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> Several additions to gameplay and story were made for the game's North American release, such as easier exchange of materia, arrows highlighting exits on field screens,<ref name="gamespotreview"/> and an extra cut scene, prompting a re-release in Japan under the title "''Final Fantasy VII International''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff7/ff7inter.html|title=Final Fantasy VII - International Version|publisher=[[RPGamer]]|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> In 1998, ''Final Fantasy VII'' was [[porting|ported]] to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[personal computer|PCs]]. This re-release featured smoother graphics and fixed translation and spelling errors, as well as gameplay-related glitches.

==Audio==
{{main|Discography of Final Fantasy VII}}
The music for ''Final Fantasy VII'' was composed by [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. Instead of recorded music and sound effects for the game, Uematsu opted for [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDIs]], using the PlayStation's internal [[sound chip]].<ref name="Hist of FF7"/> ''Final Fantasy VII'' was the first game in the series to include a track with digitized vocals, "One-Winged Angel", which has been described as Uematsu's "most recognizable contribution" to the music of the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name="DitL_interview">{{cite web| title= A Day in the Life of Final Fantasy's Nobuo Uematsu| author=Mielke, James| url= http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3166165| publisher= [[1UP.com]]| date=2008-02-15| accessdate= 2008-08-05}}</ref> Uematsu has said that the soundtrack has a feel of "realism", which prevented him from using "exorbitant, crazy music",<ref name="famitsu_interview">{{cite web| title= Nobuo Uematsu Interview| url= http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q3-2000/070800b.html| publisher= [[RPGamer]]|date= 2000-07-08| accessdate= 2008-08-05}}</ref>

The game received extremely favorable reviews from critics.
