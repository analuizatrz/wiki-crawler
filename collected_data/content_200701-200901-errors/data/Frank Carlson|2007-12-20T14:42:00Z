'''Frank Carlson''' ([[January 23]], [[1893]]-[[May 30]], [[1987]]) was an American politician who served as thirtieth [[Governor of Kansas]] and United States Representative and Senator from Kansas. 

Born in [[1893]] near [[Concordia, Kansas]], he attended public schools and Kansas State University before serving in World War I as a private. After the war, he returned to Concordia to farm. He was elected as a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] to first the Kansas legislature then to the [[United States House of Representatives]] where he served from [[1935]] to [[1947]]. 

In [[1946]] he was elected governor of Kansas. As governor, he pushed [[mental health]] programs as well as a long-term highway project.  In 1949, Kansas senator [[Clyde M. Reed]] died, and Carlson appointed [[Harry Darby]] to fill the seat. Darby continued his service in the Senate until Carlson himself was elected to fill the seat in 1950.  Instead of waiting until January to be sworn in, he took his seat on [[November 28]], [[1950]] (it is very common for someone who is elected to a Senate seat that is at the time occupied by an unelected appointee to be sworn in early), leaving the office of governor to Frank Hagaman who served less than two months. 

In 1952, he campaigned to get fellow Kansan [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] into the [[White House]], and then brokered a deal through Ohio Senator [[Robert Taft]], known as "Mr. Republican" for his leadership of the party's right-wing, became majority leader. According to [[Billy Graham]]'s biography "Just As I Am," Carlson organized the first Presidential Prayer Breakfast, later known as the [[National Prayer Breakfast]] and sponsored behind-the-scenes by [[The Family (Christian political organization)]]. In 1955, Carlson coined the phrase "worldwide spiritual offensive" as a description of [[Cold War]] [[evangelism|evangelical]] aims. In 1950, Carlson traveled to [[Haiti]] on behalf of The Family and returned to urge Congress to support the regime of the dictator [[Papa Doc Duvalier]]. Carlson was re-elected twice, in [[1956]] and [[1962]], before returning to Concordia for retirement. 

Carlson died in [[1987]] in Concordia and was buried there in Pleasant Hill Cemetery. The federal court building in Topeka is named in his honor, [[US 81]] from Concordia to [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]] is named the "Frank Carlson Memorial Highway", the [[Frank Carlson Library]] in Concordia is named in his honor, and [[Wichita State University]] hosts the Frank Carlson Lecture Series.  Carlson is the only Governor of Kansas to have served in both the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate.
