'''Princess Alice of Battenberg''', later '''Princess Andrew of [[Greece]] and [[Denmark]]''' ([[25 February]] [[1885]] - [[5 December]] [[1969]]) was a great-granddaughter of the British [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] who married into the royal house of [[Greece]]. She was the mother of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], who became consort of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]]. She was also the elder sister of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]], Lady [[Louise Mountbatten]] ([[13 July]] [[1889]] - [[7 March]] [[1965]]), who became the second wife of [[Gustav VI Adolf of Sweden]] and [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven]].

==Early life==
Her Serene Highness Princess Victoria Alice Elizabeth Julia Marie of [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] was born in the Tapestry Room at [[Windsor Castle]] in [[Berkshire]] in the presence of her great-grandmother, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].<ref>Hugo Vickers, ''Alice, Princess Andrew of Greece'' (Hamish Hamilton, London, 2000) ISBN 0-241-13686-5 p. 2</ref> She was the eldest child of [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]] ([[24 May]] [[1854]] - [[11 September]] [[1921]]) and his wife [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]] ([[5 April]] [[1863]]-[[24 September]] [[1950]]). Her mother was the eldest daughter of [[Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse]], the second daughter of Queen Victoria and [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]]. Her father was eldest son of [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine]] through his [[morganatic marriage]] to [[Julia von Hauke|Countess Julia von Hauke]]. At the request of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], on [[14 July]] [[1917]], Prince Louis relinquished the title Prince of Battenberg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse and the style [[Serene Highness]], and Anglicized the family name to Mountbatten. The following day, the King created him [[Marquess of Milford Haven]] in the [[peerage]] of the United Kingdom.<ref>Princess Alice of Battenberg never used the Mountbatten surname nor did she assume the [[courtesy title]] as a daughter of a British marquess since she had married into the Royal House of Greece in 1903.</ref>

She was christened in [[Darmstadt]] on [[25 April]] [[1885]]. Her godparents were [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse|The Grand Duke of Hesse]], [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine]], [[Julia von Hauke|Julia, Princess of Battenberg]], [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna of Russia]], [[Princess Marie of Battenberg|Countess Marie of Erbach-Schönberg]], and [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom.<ref>Vickers, p. 19</ref>

Princess Alice spent her childhood between [[Darmstadt]], [[Jugenheim]], [[Malta]] (where her naval officer father was occasionally stationed) and [[London]].<ref name="dnb">Hugo Vickers, ''Alice, Princess (1885–1969)'', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004)</ref> She was diagnosed with congenital deafness, but learned to lip-read in [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]].<ref>Vickers, p. 26</ref> She studied [[French language|French]],<ref>Vickers, p. 57</ref> and later she learned [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref>Vickers, p. 71</ref>

==Marriage==
She met and fell in love with [[Prince Andrew of Greece|Prince Andrew (Andreas) of Greece and Denmark]], the fourth son of [[George I of Greece|King George I of the Hellenes]] and [[Olga Konstantinova of Russia|Queen Olga]], at [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]’s coronation in [[1902]]. They married on [[7 October]] [[1903]] at [[Darmstadt]]. The bride and groom were closely related to the ruling houses of [[Great Britain]], [[Prussia]]/[[Germany]], [[Russia]], [[Denmark]], [[Greece]], [[Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse and by Rhine]], Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenberg, and [[Württemberg]]; their wedding was one of the last great gatherings of the descendants of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Christian IX of Denmark]] before [[World War I]]. From then on, she was typically referred to as ''Princess Aliki'' (''Princess Alice'') in Greece, but she was properly known among English-speakers as ''Princess Andrew''.

Prince and Princess Andrew of Greece had five children:

* [[Princess Margarita of Greece and Denmark]] ([[18 April]] [[1905]] - [[24 April]] [[1981]]); m.  Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg ([[24 March]] [[1897]]- [[11 May]] [[1960]]), and had issue.

* [[Princess Theodora, Margravine of Baden|Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark]] ([[30 May]] [[1906]] - [[16 October]] [[1969]]); m. Berthold, Margrave of Baden ([[24 February]] [[1906]] - [[27 October]] [[1963]]), and had issue.

* [[Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark]] ([[22 June]] [[1911]] - [[16 November]] [[1937]]); m. Georg Donatus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine ([[8 November]] [[1906]] - [[16 November]] [[1937]]), and had issue.

* [[Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark]] ([[26 June]] [[1914]] - [[24 November]] [[2001]]); m. 1st Prince Christoph of Hesse ([[14 May]] [[1901]] - [[7 October]] [[1943]]), and had issue; m. 2nd Prince George William of Hanover ([[25 March]] [[1915]]- [[8 January]] [[2006]]).

* [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark]] (born [[10 June]] [[1921]]), naturalized a British citizen, adopted the surname Mountbatten, and allegedly relinquished his succession rights to the thrones of Greece and Denmark, the titles of Prince of Greece and Prince of Denmark, and the style Royal Highness, [[28 February]] [[1947]]; granted the style Royal Highness by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]], [[19 November]] [[1947]]; created Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich, [[20 November]] [[1947]]; granted the titular dignity of Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, [[22 February]] [[1957]]; m. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] and has issue.

==Married Life==
Whilst Prince Andrew continued his career in the military, she became involved in charity work, acting as a nurse, assisting at operations and setting up field hospitals during the [[Balkan Wars]]. In 1913 George V awarded her the Royal Red Cross. But in the midst [[World War I]] she and other members of the Greek royal family were forced into exile when her brother-in-law’s neutrality policy became unpopular. For the next few years most of the Greek royal family lived in Switzerland.

They briefly returned to Greece, taking up residence at Mon Repos in [[Corfu]],<ref>Inherited by Prince Andrew on his father’s assassination in 1913.</ref> on King Constantine’s restoration in 1920. But after the defeat of the [[Hellenic Army]] in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], a Revolutionary Committee under the leadership of [[Syntagmatarkhis]] ([[Colonel]]) [[Nikolaos Plastiras]] and Syntagmatarkhis [[Stylianos Gonatas]] seized power and forced King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I of the Hellenes]] into exile once again.<ref>Vickers, p. 162</ref> Alice's husband Prince Andrew, who had served as commander of the Second Army Corps during the war, was arrested.<ref name="dnb" /> After a show trial, Prince and Princess Andrew and their children fled Greece aboard a British cruiser, [[HMS Calypso (D61)|HMS Calypso]], under the protection of Commander Gerald Talbot.<ref>Vickers, p. 171</ref>

The family settled in a small house loaned to them by Princess George of Greece at [[Saint-Cloud]], on the outskirts of [[Paris]], where the princess helped in a charity shop for Greek refugees.<ref>Vickers, p. 176-178</ref> She became deeply religious, and on [[20 October]] [[1928]] entered the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church]]. That winter, she translated her husband’s defence of his actions during the Greco-Turkish War<ref>Prince Andrew of Greece, ''Toward Disaster'' (London, 1930)</ref> into English.<ref>Vickers, p. 198-199</ref> In 1930, after suffering a severe nervous breakdown, Princess Andrew was diagnosed a paranoid [[schizophrenic]] at Dr Ernst Simmel’s sanatorium at [[Tegel]], [[Berlin]].<ref>Vickers, p. 205</ref> She was forcibly removed from her family and placed in a sanatorium in [[Kreuzlingen]], [[Switzerland]].<ref>Vickers, p. 209</ref> Another patient there at the time was [[Vaslav Nijinsky]].<ref>Vickers, p. 213</ref> 

During Princess Andrew's long convalescence, she and Prince Andrew drifted apart, her daughters all married German noblemen between 1930 and 1931, and Prince Philip went to England to stay with his uncles, then-[[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]] and [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven]], and his grandmother, the Dowager [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and the Rhine|Marchioness of Milford-Haven]].

She remained at Kreuzlingen for two years, but after a brief stay at a clinic in [[Merano]], was released and began an itinerant existence in Central Europe. She maintained contact with her mother, but broke off ties to the rest of her family until the end of 1936.<ref>Vickers, p. 245-256</ref> In [[1937]] her daughter Cécile, son-in-law and two of her grandchildren were killed in an air accident at Ostend, she and Prince Andrew met for the first time in 6 years at the funeral ([[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]], [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Dickie Mountbatten]] and [[Hermann Göring|Goering]] also attended.<ref>Vickers, p. 273</ref> In 1939, she returned to [[Athens]], living in a two-bedroomed flat near the [[Benaki Museum]], alone to work with the poor.<ref>Vickers, p. 281, p. 291</ref>

==World War II==
During [[World War II]], most of the Greek royal family remained in exile in [[South Africa]].<ref>Vickers, p. 292</ref> However, Princess Andrew was in the difficult situation of having son-in-laws fighting on the German side and a son in the [[Royal Navy]]. She and her sister-in-law, [[Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia|Princess Nicholas of Greece]] (the mother of [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]]), lived in Athens for the duration of the war.<ref name="times">"Princess Andrew, Mother of the Duke of Edinburgh," ''The Times (London)'', Saturday [[6 December]] [[1969]], p. 8, col. E</ref> She moved into her brother-in-law [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|George]]'s three-storey house in the centre of Athens. She worked for the Red Cross organization, helped organize soup kitchens and flew to [[Sweden]], on the pretext of visiting her sister, to bring back medical supplies.<ref name="vickers">Vickers, p. 293-295</ref> After the fall of Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] in September [[1943]], the German Army occupied Athens, where the majority of Greek [[Jew]]s had sought refuge. During this period, Princess Andrew hid [[Rachel Cohen]] and two of her five children, who sought to evade the [[Gestapo]] and deportation to the death camps.<ref name="vickers2">Vickers, p. 298-299</ref>

As one of Alice’s sons-in-law, Christoph von Hessen, was a member of the [[NSDAP]] and the [[Waffen-SS]], and another, Berthold von Baden, had been invalided out of the German army in [[1940]] after an injury in [[France]], the occupiers presumably assumed Alice would be pro-German. Once, she was visited by a German general who asked her, "Is there anything I can do for you?" "You can get take your troops out of my country," she replied.<ref name="vickers" />

Prince Andrew died towards the end of [[World War II]], just as hopes of a post-war reunion of the couple were rising.<ref name="times" />

==Widowed life==
[[Image:Princess Alice of Battenberg coronation.PNG|thumb|200px|Princess Alice, leading her family from [[Westminster Abbey]] following the coronation of her daughter in law, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].]]

Princess Andrew returned to [[Great Britain]] in April [[1947]] to attend the wedding of her only son, then-Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, R.N. to HRH The Princess Elizabeth, the elder daughter and heir presumptive of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] that November. She had some of her remaining jewels used in Princess Elizabeth’s engagement ring.<ref>Vickers, p. 326</ref> She sat at the head of her family on the left side of [[Westminster Abbey]], opposite the King, [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. It was decided not to invite Princess Andrew's daughters to the wedding because of the depth of anti-German sentiment in Britain following World War II. In January [[1949]], the princess founded a nursing order of Greek Orthodox nuns, the Christian Sisterhood of Martha and Mary. She trained on the Greek island of [[Tinos]], and established a home for the order in a hamlet north of Athens. She attend the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953 wearing a version of her nun's habit: a conservative two-tone grey long dress and a flowing nun-like headdress. The order eventually failed through a lack of suitable applicants.

Increasingly deaf and in failing health though incessant smoking, Princess Andrew left Greece for the last time following the [[21 April]] [[1967]] Colonels' Coup. Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh invited Princess Andrew to reside permanently in [[Great Britain]] at [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref name="dnb" /> [[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II of the Hellenes]] and [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Queen Anne-Marie]] voluntarily went into exile that December after a failed royalist counter-coup. 

Despite suggestions of senility in later life, Princess Andrew remained lucid but physically frail.<ref>Vickers, p. 392</ref> She died at [[Buckingham Palace]] in December 1969. Initially her remains were placed in the Royal Crypt in [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle]]. Before she died she expressed her wish to be buried at the [[Church of Maria Magdalene|Convent of Saint Mary Magdalene]] in Gethsemane on the [[Mount of Olives]] (near to her aunt [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna]], a Russian Orthodox saint). When her daughter, [[Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark|Princess George of Hanover]], complained that it would be too far away for them to visit her grave, she jested, "Nonsense, there’s a perfectly good bus service!"<ref>Vickers, p. 396</ref> Her wish was finally realized on [[3 August]] [[1988]] when her remains were transferred to her final resting place in a crypt below the church.<ref name="dnb" /> 

On [[31 October]] [[1994]], Princess Andrew's two surviving children, the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess George of Hanover, went to [[Yad Vashem ]](the Holocaust Memorial) in Jerusalem to witness a ceremony honoring her as "[[Righteous among the Nations]]" for having hidden the Cohen family in her house in Athens during the Second World War.<ref>Vickers, p. 398</ref> Haimaki Cohen had aided King George I in 1912-1913. In return, King George offered him any service that he could perform, should Cohen ever need it. His son remembered this during the Nazi threat, and appealed to one of two remaining members of the Royal Family left in Greece, Princess Andrew (the other was Princess Nicholas). Alice honoured the promise and saved the Cohen family.<ref name="vickers2" />
