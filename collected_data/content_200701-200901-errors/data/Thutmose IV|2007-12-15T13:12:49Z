'''Thutmose IV''' (sometimes read as ''Thutmosis'' or ''Tuthmosis IV'' and meaning ''[[Thoth]] is Born'') was the 8th [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] of [[History of Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. His prenomen or royal name was Menkheperure.  

==Dates and length of reign==
Dating the beginning of the reign of Thutmose IV is difficult to do with certainty because he is several generations removed from the astronomical dates which are usually used to calculate Egyptian chronologies, and the debate over the proper interpretation of these observances has not been settled. Thutmose's grandfather [[Thutmose III]] almost certainly acceded the throne in either 1504 or 1479, based upon two lunar obervances during his reign.<ref name="Bryan 14">Bryan, Betsy. ''The Reign of Thutmose IV.'' p.14. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1991</ref> After ruling for nearly 54 years,<ref>Peter Der Manuelian. ''Studies in the Reign of Amenophis II.'' p.20.

''The Chronology of the Eighteenth Dynasty.'' p.119. Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 25, No. 2 (Apr., 1966)</ref> but has been assigned up to 35 years in some chronological reconstructions.<ref>Charles C. Van Siclen. "Amenhotep II", ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt.'' Ed. Donald Redford. Vol. 1, p.71. Oxford University Press, 2001.</ref> The currently preferred reconstruction, after analyzing all this evidence, usually comes to an accession date around 1401 BC<ref>Jürgen von Beckerath, Chronologie des Pharaonischen Ägypten.  Philipp von Zabern, Mainz, (1997) p.190</ref> or 1400 BC<ref>Shaw, Ian; and Nicholson, Paul.  ''The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt.'' p.290. The British Museum Press, 1995.</ref> for the beginning of Thutmose IV's reign.

The length of his reign is not as clear as one would wish. He is usually given about nine or ten years of reign.  Manetho credits him a reign of 9 Years and 8 Months.<ref name="Bryan 4">Bryan, Betsy. ''The Reign of Thutmose IV.'' p.4. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1991</ref> However, Manetho's other figures for the 18th dynasty are frequently assigned to the wrong kings or simply incorrect, so monumental evidence is also used to determine his reign length.<ref name="Bryan 5">Bryan, Betsy. ''The Reign of Thutmose IV.'' p.5. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1991</ref> Of all of Thutmose IV's dated monuments, three date to his first regnal year, one to his fourth, possibly one to his fifth, one to his sixth, two to his seventh, and one to his eighth. <ref name="Bryan 6">Bryan, Betsy. ''The Reign of Thutmose IV.'' p.6. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1991</ref> Two possible other dated objects, one dated to a Year 19 and another year 20, have been suggested as belong to him, but neither have been accepted as dating to his reign.<ref name="Bryan 6"/> The reading of the king in these dates are today accepted as referring to the prenomen of [[Thutmose III]]--Menkheperre--and not Menkhepe[ru]re Thutmose IV himself. Due to the absence of higher dates for Thutmose IV after his Year 8 Konosso stela<ref>BAR II, 823-829 </ref>, Manetho's figures here are usually accepted.<ref name="Bryan 4"/> There were once chronological reconstructions which gave him a reign as long as 34-35 years.<ref name="Bryan 4"/><ref>Wente, E.F.; and Van Siclen, C. "A Chronology of the New Kingdom." SAOC 39</ref> Today, however, most scholars ascribe give him a 10 year reign from 1401 to 1391 BC, within a small margin of error.

==Life==

From a full-sized reproduction on display at the [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]], [[San Jose]].]]
Thutmose IV was born to [[Amenhotep II]] and [[Tiaa, wife of Amenhotep II|Tiaa]] but was not actually the crown prince and Amenhotep II's chosen successor to the throne. Some scholars speculate that Thutmose ousted his older brother in order to usurp power and then commissioned the ''[[Dream Stele]]'' in order to justify his unexpected kingship. Thutmose's most celebrated accomplishment was the restoration of the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]] at [[Giza]] and subsequent commission of the ''Dream Stele''. According to Thutmose's account on the ''Dream Stele'', while the young prince was out on a hunting trip, he stopped to rest under the head of the Sphinx, which was buried up to the neck in sand. He soon fell asleep and had a dream in which the Sphinx told him that if he cleared away the sand and restored it he would become the next Pharaoh. After completing the restoration of the Sphinx, he placed a carved stone tablet, now known as the ''Dream Stele'', between the two paws of the Sphinx.The restoration of the Sphinx and the text of the ''Dream Stele'' would then be a piece of propaganda on Thutmose's part, meant to bestow legitimacy upon his unexpected kingship.<ref>Peter Clayton, ''Chronicle of the Pharaohs'', Thames & Hudson Ltd, 1994. pp.113-114</ref>. Little is known about his brief ten-year rule. He suppressed an uprising in [[Nubia]] in his 8th year around [[1393 BC]] and was referred to in a [[stela]] as the ''Conqueror of [[Ancient Syria|Syria]]''<ref>Clayton, op. cit., p.114</ref>, but little else has been pieced together about his military exploits. Thutmose IV's rule is significant  because he was the New Kingdom pharaoh who established peaceful relations with [[Mitanni]] and married a Mitannian princess to seal this new alliance. Thutmose IV's role in initiating contact with Egypt's former rival, Mitanni, is documented by [[Amarna letter]] EA 29 composed decades later by [[Tushratta]], a Mittanian king who ruled during the reign of [[Akhenaten]], Thutmose IV's grandson. Tushratta states to Akhenaten that: 

: ''When [Menkheperure], the father of Nimmureya (ie. [[Amenhotep III]]) wrote to Artatama, my grandfather, he asked for the daughter of my grandfather, the sister of my father. He wrote 5, 6 times, but he did not give her. When he wrote my grandfather 7 times, then only under such pressure, did he give her.'' (EA 29)<ref>[[William L. Moran]], The Amarna Letters, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. p.93</ref> 

Like most Thutmosids, he built on a large scale. Thutmose IV completed an [[obelisk]] first started by [[Thutmose III of Egypt|Thutmose III]], which, at 32 m (105 feet), was the tallest obelisk ever erected in Egypt, at the Temple of [[Karnak]].<ref>Clayton, op. cit., p.114</ref> It was transported to Rome by a later Roman Emperor and today stands at [[Saint Peter's Square]] in the Vatican.

==Burial==
Thutmose IV was buried in the [[Valley of the Kings]], in tomb [[KV43]], but his body was moved to the mummy cache in [[KV35]], where it was discovered by [[Victor Loret]] in 1898. An examination of his body shows that he was very ill and had been wasting away for the final months of his life prior to his death. He was succeded by his son, [[Amenhotep III]].
