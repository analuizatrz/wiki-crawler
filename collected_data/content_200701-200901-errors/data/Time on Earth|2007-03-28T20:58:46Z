'''''Time on Earth''''' is the fifth studio album by the pop-rock band [[Crowded House]]. Tracks have been produced by both [[Ethan Johns]] and [[Steve Lillywhite]] and the album is due to be released in 2007. ''Time on Earth'' marks the reunion of the band eleven years after they disbanded and features new drummer [[Matt Sherrod]] in place of the original drummer, the late [[Paul Hester]], who took his own life in 2005.

The album was originally intended to be frontman [[Neil Finn]]'s third solo release.  In the wake of Paul Hester's death, as well as preparations for the release of the live album ''[[Farewell To The World]]'', the band members were drawn together and their friendship was reinvigorated.  Neil Finn invited bassist [[Nick Seymour]] to participate in the recording of his new album and subsequent tour.  After recording a complete album with Ethan Johns in the producer's seat, studio musician [[Joey Waronker]] drumming and Seymour contributing substantially throughout the process, Finn decided Crowded House would reform and that ''Time on Earth'' would be the band's fifth studio album.

With new drummer Matt Sherrod and multi-instrumentalist [[Mark Hart]] now involved as members of the official lineup, the band returned to the studio to record four additional tracks with producer Steve Lillywhite.  Sherrod and Hart also contributed retroactively to some of the tracks recorded with Ethan Johns.  In its final form, the album will feature tracks mixed by Johns, Lillywhite and [[Tchad Blake]].  

In a video interview from Feb. 2007, Neil Finn described the new album: "It doesn't sound like any one particular Crowded House album, but it has elements of Crowded House... in as much as Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and best way to do that was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be."

On March 17, 2007 the band played a 2 1/2 hour set streamed live to the Internet from Peter Gabriel's studio in England. The following new songs were played and may be on the final album:
* "English Trees"
* "Pour Le Monde"
* "Transit Lounge"
* "She Called Up"
* "Heaven That I'm Making"
* "Nobody Wants to Talk About It"
* "Don't Stop Now"

Other tracks not yet performed publicly but rumored to be on the album include:
* "Stare Me Out"
* "People Are Like Suns"

A song titled "Time On Earth" has been performed by Neil Finn in the past.  It is not yet known whether this song has been recorded, or if it will be on the album as the [[title track]].

As he did for the first four Crowded House albums, Nick Seymour, also an artist, will create the [[cover art]] for ''Time on Earth''.
