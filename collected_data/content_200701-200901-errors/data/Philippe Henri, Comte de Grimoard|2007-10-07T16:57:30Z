'''Philippe Henri, comte de Grimoard''' ([[1753]]-[[1815]]), [[France|French]] soldier and military writer.

He entered the royal army at the age of sixteen, and in [[1775]] published his ''Essai théorique et practique sur les batailles''. Shortly afterwards [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] placed him in his own military cabinet and employed him especially in connection with schemes of army reform. By the start of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] he had become one of Louis's most valued counsellors, in political as well as military matters, and was marked out, though only a colonel, as the next Minister of War.

In [[1791]] Grimoard was entrusted with the preparation of the scheme of defence for France, which proved two years later of great assistance to the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. The events of 1792 put an end to his military career, and the remainder of his life was spent in writing military books.

The following works by him, besides his first essay, have retained some importance:
*''Histoire des dernières campagnes de Turenne'' (Paris, 1780)
*''Lettres et mémoires de [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]]'' (Paris, 1780)
