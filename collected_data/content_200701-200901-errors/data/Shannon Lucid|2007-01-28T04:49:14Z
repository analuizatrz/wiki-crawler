'''Shannon Matilda Wells Lucid''' (born [[January 14]], [[1943]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[astronaut]] who holds the record for the longest duration stay in space by a woman. She has flown in space five times including a prolonged mission aboard the Mir space station.

Lucid was born in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], to [[Baptist]] missionary parents Oscar and Myrtle Wells, but grew up in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. She attended the [[University of Oklahoma]] and obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[biochemistry]] from that school in [[1973]]. She was selected to the [[NASA]] astronaut corps in [[1978]]. Married to Michael F. Lucid of Indianapolis, Indiana. They have two daughters and one son, and five granddaughters.

Lucid's first space flight was in June [[1985]] on [[Space Shuttle Discovery]]'s mission [[STS-51-G]]. She also flew on shuttle missions [[STS-34]] in [[1989]], [[STS-43]] in [[1991]], and [[STS-58]] in [[1993]].

Lucid is best known for her fifth spaceflight, when she spent 188 days in space, from [[March 22]] to [[September 26]], [[1996]], including 179 days aboard ''[[Mir]]'', the Russian [[space station]]. Both to and from Mir, she travelled on [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]]. Her stay on Mir was not expected to last so long but her return was delayed twice, extending her stay by about six weeks. During the mission she performed numerous life science and physical science experiments. As a result of her time aboard Mir, she held the record for the most hours in orbit by a non-Russian, and still holds the record for most hours in orbit by any woman.

From [[2002]]-[[2003]], Lucid served as the Chief Scientist of NASA.

In [[2005]], Lucid was [[capsule communicator]] (capcom) for [[STS-114]].

In [[2006]], Lucid was the [[capsule communicator]] (capcom) for [[STS-116]].

Lucid was awarded the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]] in December 1996, the 10th astronaut to be given that honor.
