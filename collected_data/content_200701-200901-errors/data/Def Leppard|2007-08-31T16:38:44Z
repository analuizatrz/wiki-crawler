'''Def Leppard''' are an [[England|English]] [[hard rock]] band from [[Sheffield]] who formed in [[1977]] as part of the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]].<br>
On the strength of their albums, ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'' and ''[[Hysteria (album)|Hysteria]]'', Def Leppard became one of the top selling rock bands of the 1980s.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

==Music==
The music of Def Leppard is a mixture of [[hard rock]], [[Album-oriented rock|AOR]], and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] elements, and has been associated more with the [[glam metal]] (also known as pop metal) movement of the [[1980s]] than with the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal|NWOBHM]] of the late [[1970s]], in large part due to their mainstream success and production. However, Def Leppard have expressed dislike of the "pop metal" label<ref>http://heavymetalmusic.biz/2007/07/06/def-leppard-craves-respect-in-interview/</ref>

By the release of the ''[[Hysteria (album)|Hysteria]]'' album, the band had developed a distinctive sound featuring heavily [[digital signal processing|processed]] drums and effects-laden guitar sounds, overlaid with a multi-layered wall of husky, harmonised vocals. Def Leppard is one of only six rock bands with two original albums selling over 10 million copies each in the U.S. The others are [[The Beatles]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Eagles]] and [[Van Halen]]. 

==History==
===1977 - 1979===
[[Rick Savage]] (bass), [[Pete Willis]] (guitars) and [[Tony Kenning]] (drums), formed the band "Atomic Mass" in [[1977]] as students at [[Tapton School]] in [[Sheffield]] (see [[1977 in music]]). [[Joe Elliott]] auditioned for a spot as their guitarist following a chance meeting with Willis. However, during Elliott's audition, it was decided that he was better suited for the role of lead singer. 

Soon afterwards, they adopted the name '''"Deaf Leopard"''' (which Elliott had thought of in his school days). At the suggestion of Tony Kenning, the name "Deaf Leopard" was slightly modified to '''Def Leppard''' in order to avoid comparison to punk bands, and perhaps also as an indirect homage to [[Led Zeppelin]]'s similarly styled band name.

While perfecting their sound as a band in  spoon factory, the band added another guitarist [[Steve Clark]] in January 1978. Tony Kenning suddenly left the band in November 1978 prior to recording sessions for a three-song EP in late 1978. He was replaced for those sessions by [[Frank Noon]] on what was known the ''[[Def Leppard EP]]''.

Sales for the EP soared soon after the track "[[Rocks Off]]" was given extensive airtime by renowned BBC Radio DJ [[John Peel]], considered at the time to be a champion of [[punk rock]] and [[new wave music]]. 15-year-old [[Rick Allen (drummer)|Rick Allen]] joined the band as its full-time drummer towards the end of November 1978.

Throughout 1979, the band won a loyal following among British [[hard rock]]/[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans, and were even initially considered the leaders of the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] (eventually losing that spot to [[Iron Maiden]]). This emerging popularity resulted in a major label record deal with Phonogram/Vertigo (Mercury Records in the US).

===1980 – 1983===
Their debut album, ''[[On Through The Night]]'', was released on March 14, 1980. Although the album hit the Top 15 in the UK, many early fans were turned off by the perception that the band was trying too hard to appeal to American audiences, with songs like "Hello America" and touring more in the US (supporting [[Pat Travers]], [[AC/DC]] and [[Ted Nugent]]). While performing at the Reading Festival in August (alongside fellow NWOBHM pioneers [[Iron Maiden]]), audience members showed this displeasure by pelting the band with garbage during their set.

In retrospect, the hostility was unfair as the band was simply taking advantage of opportunities not given to most young British rock bands at the time. However, the damage was done and it would take years until Def Leppard won back their homeland.

The band then caught the attention of AC/DC producer [[Robert Lange|Robert John "Mutt" Lange]], who agreed to work on their second album, ''[[High 'n' Dry]]'', released on July 11, 1981. Lange's painfully meticulous approach in the studio greatly improved on Def Leppard's potential from ''On Through The Night''. 

Despite mediocre album sales, the "[[Bringin' on the Heartbreak]]" promo clip became one of the first "metal" videos played on [[MTV]] in 1982, and this brought increasing visibility (and momentum) to the band in the States.

[[Phil Collen]], former guitarist with the glam band [[Girl (band)|Girl]], replaced [[Pete Willis]] who was fired on July 11, 1982, due to excessive [[alcohol]] consumption on the job (Willis later resurfaced with the bands [[Gogmagog (band)|Gogmagog]] and [[Roadhouse (band)|Roadhouse]]). This personnel change took place during the recording of their third release, ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'', released on January 20, 1983, and also produced by Lange. 

The lead single "Photograph" turned Def Leppard into a household name, supplanting [[Michael Jackson]]'s [[Beat It]] as the most requested video clip on [[MTV]], becoming a staple of rock radio (dominating the US Album Rock Charts for six weeks), and hitting #12 on the pop charts.

Fueled by "Photograph" and subsequent singles "Rock of Ages" and "Foolin'", [[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]] went on to sell six million copies in 1983, and was held off the top of the US album charts only by [[Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson's]] ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]''. The album has since been certified [[Diamond album|Diamond]] by the [[RIAA]] in the US, and is considered a classic in both the mainstream rock and heavy metal genres.

Def Leppard's US tour in support of ''Pyromania'' began by opening for [[Billy Squier]] in March, and ended with an audience  of 55,000 at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, CA in September.

As a testament of the band's popularity at the time, a US Gallup poll in 1984 saw Def Leppard voted in as favourite rock band over peers such as [[the Rolling Stones]], [[AC/DC]] and [[Journey (band)|Journey]]. However, this popularity was not matched in their native England, a fact that greatly bothered them.

===1984 – 1989===
Following their breakthrough, the band moved to [[Dublin]] in February 1984 to begin writing the follow-up to ''Pyromania''.  Mutt Lange initially joined in on the songwriting sessions, but then suddenly declined to return as producer due to exhaustion. Instead, [[Jim Steinman]] (of [[Meat Loaf]]'s ''[[Bat out of Hell]]'' fame), was brought in, only to be let go within weeks.

On [[December 31]] [[1984]], drummer [[Rick Allen (drummer)|Rick Allen]] lost his left arm in a car crash on the [[A57 road|A57]] in the hills outside Sheffield when his speeding [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] left the road on a sharp bend and went through a drystone wall. Despite the severity of the accident, Rick was committed to continuing his role as Def Leppard's drummer. He practiced drumming with pillows, and realised that he could use his legs to do some of the drumming work previously done with his arms. He then worked with [[Simmons (electronic drum company)|Simmons]] to design a custom [[Electronic drum|electronic drum kit]]. 

The other members of the band fully stood behind Rick's determination and never sought a replacement. During his recovery, Mutt Lange eventually returned to the fold as producer, and Rick's triumphant comeback was sealed at the 1986 [[Donington Park|Donington]] [[Monsters of Rock]] festival, with an emotionally charged ovation after his introduction by [[Joe Elliott]]. 

Def Leppard's fourth album, ''[[Hysteria (album)|Hysteria]]'', was finally released on August 3, [[1987 in music|1987]]. 
The second single from the album, "Animal", reached #6 in the UK and finally turned the band into stars in their home country. ''Hysteria'' immediately topped the charts in its first week of release.

US album sales were relatively slow (compared to ''Pyromania'') until the fourth single, "Pour Some Sugar On Me". The song hit Number 2, and ''Hysteria'' finally reached the top of the US Album Charts in July 1988. In October, the power ballad "[[Love Bites (Def Leppard song)|Love Bites]]" would become Def Leppard's first (and only) Number One single on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], and in January 1989 the band scored another US Top 5 hit with "Armageddon It".

''Hysteria'' is one of only a handful of albums (and the third in rock history) that has charted seven singles or more on the US Hot 100: "Women" (#80), "Animal" (#19), "Hysteria" (#10), "[[Pour Some Sugar On Me]]" (#2), "[[Love Bites (Def Leppard song)|Love Bites]]" (#1), "Armageddon It" (#3) and "Rocket" (#12). It remained on the charts for three years and has sold 18 million copies worldwide.

Equally as successful was the accompanying ''Hysteria'' world tour which ran for 15 months and saw Def Leppard perform "In The Round". The concept proved wildly popular with fans, as evidenced in the videos for "[[Pour Some Sugar On Me]]" and "Armageddon It" (and was later used again for the ''[[Adrenalize]]'' tour).

In 1989 Def Leppard won Favourite Heavy Metal Artist as well as Favourite Heavy Metal Album (for "Hysteria") during the American Music Awards. It was the first time that a heavy metal category was added to the awards show. (The category has since been deleted in recent years)

By the end of the decade, although [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[Bon Jovi]] garnered more mainstream exposure, Def Leppard had sold more records than any other rock band in the US.

===1990 – 1999===
Following ''[[Hysteria (album)|Hysteria]]'''s mammoth success, the band quickly set out to work on their fifth album, hoping to avoid another lengthy gap. However, [[Steve Clark]]'s [[alcoholism]] issues worsened to the point where he was constantly in and out of [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. Recording sessions suffered from this distraction, and in mid-1990 Steve was granted a six-month leave of absence from the band. 

Clark never reached the end of his leave, dying from an accidental mix of prescription drugs and alcohol on [[January 8]] [[1991]] in his London home. The remaining band members decided to carry on and recorded of the album as a four-piece, with Phil mimicking Steve's style on his intended guitar parts. 

Def Leppard's fifth album ''[[Adrenalize]]'' was finally released on March 31 1992. The album simultaneously entered at Number One on both the UK and US album charts, staying there for 5 weeks on the latter. The first single, "Let's Get Rocked", was an instant smash hit and its video was later nominated for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|Best Video of the Year]] at the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

In April 1992, guitarist [[Vivian Campbell]] (formerly of [[Dio]] and [[Whitesnake]]) joined Def Leppard, making his official live debut with his band at the [[Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]]. ''[[Adrenalize]]'' yielded six hit singles and sold 7 million copies worldwide. Another successful world tour followed, but the band's fortunes began to be affected by the rise of [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock]].

A collection of b-sides and unreleased tracks recorded between 1984 and 1993, ''[[Retro Active]]'', was released in October [[1993]], preceded by the success of "Two Steps Behind" (from the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] film [[Last Action Hero]]). Another single, "Miss You In A Heartbeat", hit the Top 5 in [[Canada]], becoming one of their biggest hits there. Retro Active has sold 3 million copies worldwide to date.

Two years later, Def Leppard issued their first greatest hits collection, ''[[Vault: Def Leppard's Greatest Hits (1980-1995)]]'', which has sold 8 million copies worldwide. Alternate track listings of the album were issued for North America, the UK and Japan. 

The compilation included a new track, the ballad "When Love & Hate Collide", which became their biggest ever hit in the UK, hitting #2. It peaked at #58 in the U.S. On [[October 23]], [[1995]], the band entered the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] by performing three concerts in three continents in one day (Tangiers, Morocco, London, England, and Vancouver, Canada).

[[Slang (album)|Slang]], released in May 1996, marked a drastic musical departure for the band by featuring darker lyrics and a stripped-down alternative rock edge. The US audience reception for [[Slang (album)|Slang]] and its subsequent tour was a major dropoff from a decade earlier, but [[Q Magazine]] would nonetheless list [[Slang (album)|Slang]] as one of the Top Ten Albums of 1996.

[[VH1]] revived the band's fortunes in the US in 1998 by featuring them on one of the first episodes of ''[[Behind The Music]]''. Reruns of the episode yielded some of the series' highest ratings, and brought the band's music back into the public consciousness (following years of burial by the alternative rock climate). The episode was even parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

In an effort to capitalize on this new momentum, Def Leppard returned to its classic sound with the 1999 album ''[[Euphoria (Def Leppard album)|Euphoria]]''. The first single, "Promises", reunited the band with [[Mutt Lange]], and hit the US Mainstream Rock charts for 3 weeks. The album was certified for gold sales in the United States and Canada.

===2000 – Present===
On September 5, 2000, Def Leppard were inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame, on [[Hollywood]]'s [[Sunset Boulevard]] by their friend [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]].

In 2001 VH1 produced and aired ''[[Hysteria - The Def Leppard Story]]'', a biopic that included [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as [[Mutt Lange]] and [[Amber Valletta]] as Lorelei Shellist ([[Steve Clark]]'s girlfriend). The docudrama covered the band's history between 1977 through 1986, recounting the trials and triumphs of [[Rick Allen]] and [[Steve Clark]]. The July 18 broadcast still produced some of the channel's highest-ever ratings and is available on DVD.

A side project at the time consisted of [[Joe Elliott]] and [[Phil Collen]] teaming up with members of the [[Spiders From Mars]] ([[David Bowie]]'s former band), minus the late [[Mick Ronson]], naming themselves the [[Cybernauts]]. The group played several shows, covering Bowie's [[Ziggy Stardust]]-era songs.

Def Leppard's tenth album, simply titled "''X''", was released in July 2002. It saw the band's musical direction moving more towards pop and further away from the band's hard rock roots. In fact, some tracks were produced by the hit factory behind [[Britney Spears]] and the [[Backstreet Boys]].

Although greeted with generally positive reviews, ''X'' quickly disappeared from the charts, ultimately becoming the band's least successful release. However, the accompanying tour played to the band's strongest audiences since ''Adrenalize''.

An expanded and updated best-of collection, ''Best Of'', was released in October 2004 internationally. The North America-only version, ''Rock Of Ages - The Definitive Collection'', was released the following May. Def Leppard would participate at the [[Live 8]] show in Philadelphia, and toured in the summer with Bryan Adams. 2005 also saw the band leave their longtime management team, Q-Prime and sign with HK Management.

On May 23 2006, Def Leppard released an all-covers album titled ''[[Yeah! (album)|Yeah!]]''. The disc pays homage to classic rock songs of their childhood, originally recorded by [[David Bowie]], [[The Kinks]],  [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], and [[Badfinger]] among others. It debuted at #16 in the US, their tenth consecutive Top 20 album and has scanned 140,000+ to date.  It did very little business in the rest of the world though. 

The band, along with [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and [[Judas Priest]], were the inaugural inductees of "[[VH1 Rock Honors]]" on [[May 31]], [[2006]]. During the show, The [[All-American Rejects]] paid homage to the band with a cover of "Photograph". Soon afterwards, they embarked on a successful US tour with [[Journey (band)|Journey]]. That October, ''[[Hysteria (album)|Hysteria]]'' was re-released in a two-disc deluxe edition format, which combined the original album, remastered for the first time, with b-sides, remixes and bonus tracks from single releases.

Def Leppard began their latest tour, the 52-date "[[Downstage Thrust Tour]]," on June 29, set to take them across the US and Canada. The openers are [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]] (with the addition of [[REO Speedwagon]] or [[Kim Mitchell]] on some dates). The band's upcoming album is tentatively titled ''[[Songs From The Sparkle Lounge]]'' and is scheduled for release in 2008.
