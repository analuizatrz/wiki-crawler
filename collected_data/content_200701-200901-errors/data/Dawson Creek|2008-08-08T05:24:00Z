The '''City of Dawson Creek''' is a small city in northeastern [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. The municipality of {{km2 to mi2|20.66|precision=2|spell=UK}} had a population of 11,811 in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/data/dd/facsheet/cf262.pdf |title=Dawson Creek District Municipality |accessdate=2008-04-16 |date=2007-01-10 |work=Community Facts |publisher=BC Stats |format=pdf }}</ref> Dawson Creek derives its name from the creek of the same name that runs through the community. The creek was named after [[George Mercer Dawson]] by a member of his land survey team when they passed through the area in August 1879. Once a small farming community, Dawson Creek became a regional centre when the western terminus of the [[Northern Alberta Railways]] was extended there in 1932. The community grew rapidly in 1942 as the US Army used the rail terminus as a [[transshipment]] point during construction of the [[Alaska Highway]]. In the 1950s, the city was connected to the interior of British Columbia via a highway and railway through the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Since the 1960s, growth has slowed.

Dawson Creek is located in the dry and windy prairie land of the [[Peace River Country]]. As the seat of the [[Peace River Regional District, British Columbia|Peace River Regional District]] and a service centre for the rural areas south of the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]], the city has been called the "Capital of the Peace". It is also known as the "Mile 0 City", referring to its location at the southern end of the Alaska Highway. The community is home to a [[Heritage interpretation|heritage interpretation village]], an art gallery, and a museum. Annual events include a fall fair and a spring rodeo.

==History==
Dawson Creek is named after the watercourse of the same name, itself named after [[George Mercer Dawson]] who led a surveying team through the area in August 1879; a member of the team labelled the creek with Dawson's name.<ref>{{cite news |title=First Traveler Through Dawson, 1879 |url=http://www.calverley.ca/Part05-Dawson%20Creek/5-007.html |work=The News, Progress Edition |date= [[27 April]] [[1979]]|accessdate=2008-04-16}}</ref> The community that formed by the creek was one of many farming communities established by European-Canadian settlers moving west through the [[Peace River Country]]. When the Canadian government began issuing [[Homesteading|homestead]] grants to settlers in 1912, the pace of migration increased. With the opening of a few stores and hotels in 1919 and the incorporation of the Dawson Creek Co-operative Union on [[28 May]] [[1921]], Dawson Creek became a dominant business centre in the area.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dawson Creek: Past and Present, An Historical Sketch |last=Coutts |first=M. E. |year=1958 |publisher= Dawson Creek Historical Society |location= Edmonton, AB |pages= }}</ref> After much speculation by land owners and investors, the [[Northern Alberta Railways]] built its western terminus 3 km (2 mi) from Dawson Creek.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.calverley.ca/Part05-Dawson%20Creek/5-008.html |last=Calverley |first=Dorthea |title= The Choice of Terminal for the N.A.R.|accessdate=2008-04-16 |year= 1983 |work=Calverley Collection}}</ref> The golden spike was driven on [[29 December]] [[1930]], and the first passenger train arrived on [[15 January]] [[1931]]. The arrival of the railway and the construction of grain elevators attracted more settlers and business to the settlement. The need to provide services for the rapidly growing community led Dawson Creek to incorporate as a village in May 1936. A small wave of refugees from the [[Sudetenland]] settled in the area in 1939 as World War II was beginning.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.calverley.ca/Part08-Agriculture/8-20.html |last=Calverley |first=Dorthea |title= The Sudeten Settlement in the Peace River District|accessdate=2008-04-16 |work=Calverley Collection}}</ref> The community exceeded 500 people in 1941.<ref name = stats2171/> Upon entering the war, the United States decided to build a transportation corridor to connect the US mainland to Alaska. In 1942, thousands of US Army personnel, engineers, and contractors poured into the city – the terminal of rail transport – to construct the [[Alaska Highway]].

The highway was completed in less than a year; even after the workers involved in its construction departed, population and economic growth continued. By 1951, Dawson Creek had more than 3,500 residents.<ref name=stats2171>{{cite web |url= http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/data/pop/pop/mun/Mun2171.asp |title= British Columbia Municipal Census Populations, 1921-1971 |accessdate=2008-04-16 |publisher=BC Stats}}</ref> In 1952, the [[British Columbia Highway 97|John Hart Highway]] linked the town to the rest of the [[British Columbia Interior]] and [[Lower Mainland]] through the Rocky Mountains;<ref name=PFRA>{{cite web |url= http://www.agr.gc.ca/pfra/offices/dawson_e.htm|title= PFRA Dawson Creek District Office |accessdate=2008-04-17 |publisher=Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada}}</ref> a new southbound route, known locally as [[British Columbia Highway 2|Tupper Highway]], made the town a crossroads with neighbouring [[Alberta]].

In 1958, the extension of the [[Pacific Great Eastern Railway]] to the Peace from [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] was completed,<ref name=PFRA/> and the village was re-incorporated as a city. Between 1951 and 1961, the population of Dawson Creek more than tripled.

[[Image:Dawson Creek former logo.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The former Dawson Creek city logo, retired in 2002.]]

Growth slowed in the 1960s, with the population reaching its all-time high in 1966. In the 1970s, the provincial government moved its regional offices from [[Pouce Coupe, British Columbia|Pouce Coupe]] to the city, [[Northern Lights College]] opened a Dawson Creek campus, and the Dawson Creek Mall was constructed. Several modern [[grain elevator]]s were built, and the town's five wooden grain elevators, nicknamed "Elevator Row", were taken out of service. Only one of the historic elevators remains, converted to an art gallery. Since the 1970s, with the nearby town of [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]] attracting much of the area's industrial development and [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]] becoming a commercial hub, the town's population and economy have not significantly increased.

Since 1991, the city has undergone several boundary expansions. One expansion incorporated undeveloped land in the southeast for an industrial park and a [[Louisiana Pacific|Louisiana-Pacific Canada]] [[veneer (wood)|veneer]] factory.<ref>{{cite news |title=Northland Industrial Park gets the go-ahead |work=Peace River Block News |date=1982-02-17}}</ref> The city extended sewer and water lines to the location; however, the area was not developed and with the factory only half-built, L-P Canada abandoned its plans. A business making manufactured homes bought the factory and completed its development in 2005.<ref>{{cite news |first=Gary |last=Rusak |title=Greensmart Continues Preparations in Dawson Creek |url= http://www.calverley.ca/Part12-Enterprises/BN12-73.htm |work=Peace River Block News |date=2005-09-02 |accessdate=2008-04-16}}</ref> Another expansion incorporated the existing [[oriented strand board]] factory in the northwest corner of the city, while further incorporations have included undeveloped land to the south and north.

The 1941 census, the first to include Dawson Creek as a defined subdivision, counted 518 residents.<ref name=stats2171/> Its growth spurred by the construction of the Alaska Highway, the town recorded a sevenfold increase to 3,589 residents in the 1951 census. Within five years, the population doubled to 7,531.<ref name=stats2171/> New transport links with southern British Columbia and Alberta spurred continued growth into the next decade. The population peaked in 1966 at 12,392, then declined throughout the 1970s, rising again briefly during the construction of the nearby town of [[Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia|Tumbler Ridge]] in the early 1980s. Dawson Creek's population has remained relatively stable since then. In the ten-year span from 1998 to 2007, the population was lowest in 2003 (11,144) and highest in 2007 (11,811), per provincial estimates.<ref name=stats9607/>

According to the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Canadian census]], there were 10,994 people living in 4,650 households within the city<ref name=statscan06/> (the official provincial figure was 11,563 people, including an estimate of net census undercount<ref name=stats9607/>). Of the federally surveyed households, 33% were one-person households, slightly above the 28% average provincewide; households consisting of couples with children, at 26%, were very close to the provincial average; and households of couples without children, at 24%, were below the provincial average of 30%. Among its 3,000 census families, Dawson Creek had a smaller proportion of married couples than the province, 62% compared to 73%, but the same average number of persons per family, 2.9. With 92% of Dawson Creek residents being Canadian-born, and 93% speaking only English, the city has few visible minorities. Only 17% of residents aged 35–64 had a university certificate or diploma, compared to the provincewide rate of 29%. Among those aged 25–64, 20% did not have a high school certificate or equivalent, much higher than the 12% provincewide rate.<ref name=statscan06/>

In 2005, the 22-officer Dawson Creek [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] municipal detachment reported 2,561 [[Criminal Code of Canada]] offenses. This translated into a crime rate of 225 Criminal Code offenses per 1,000 people, down from the previous year's rate of 231, but still much higher than the provincial average of 125. In 2004, per 1,000 people, the city had higher crime rates compared to the provincial averages on all Criminal Code offenses except theft from motor vehicles (19.8 city, 20.2 province), heroin-related offenses (0 city, 0.13 province), and murder (0 city, 0.03 province). The city had slightly higher but comparable levels of offensive weapons charges, cannabis-related offenses, robbery, and motor vehicle thefts. Per 1,000 people, the city had much higher levels of shoplifting (13.8 city, 4.2 province), cocaine-related offenses (7.8 city, 1.4 province), commercial break-and-enters (11.2 city, 4.2 province), residential break-and-enters (13.9 city, 6.0 province), and non-sexual assaults (26.2 city, 9.9 province).<ref name=crimestats/>

==Geography and climate==
At the foot of Bear Mountain ridge, the city developed around the Dawson Creek watercourse which flows eastward into the [[Pouce Coupe River]]. The city is located on the Pouce Coupe Prairie in the southwestern part of the [[Peace River Country]], 72&nbsp;km (45&nbsp;mi) southeast of Fort St. John, and 134&nbsp;km (83&nbsp;mi) northwest of Grande Prairie. According to the [[Canada Land Inventory]], the city is on soil that has moderate limitations, due to an adverse climate, that restrict the range of crops or require moderate conservation practices.<ref>[http://www.alc.gov.bc.ca/alr/ag_cap_details.htm#class Agriculture Capability Detailed Description.] Provincial Agricultural Land Commission. URL accessed on 17 November 2005.</ref> The land is flat, but slopes upwards in the northeastern corner elevating a residential area over the rest of the city.

The city is in the British Columbia Peace Lowland ecosection of the [[Boreal Plains|Canadian Boreal Plains]] [[ecozone]] on the continental [[Interior Plains|Interior Platform]]. Located in the Cordillera Climatic Region, it has a subhumid low boreal ecoclimate. In the summer, the city is often dusty and arid. Heavy rain showers are sporadic, lasting only a few minutes. In the winter, the city can get bitterly cold and dry. It is subject to very strong winds year round.<ref>[http://www.peaceenergy.ca/windpower.html Wind Power.] Peace Energy Co-op. URL accessed on 20 November 2005.</ref> Unlike the rest of the province, the city and its region use [[Mountain Standard Time]] throughout the year, since the area already has long daylight hours in the summer and short daylight hours in the winter.

==Economy==
The economy of Dawson Creek is based around four major industries: agriculture, retail, tourism, and oil and gas.<ref name=BCmag>{{cite news |first=J.B. |last=MacKinnon |title=Dawson Creek: Mile Zero, where the buffalo roam |work=British Columbia Magazine |date=Fall 2005 |pages=17–19}}</ref> Agriculture has historically been the most important industry to Dawson Creek, as the city is the regional transshipment point for agricultural commodities. The city is surrounded by the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]], where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and grass crops, such as canola, hay, oats, alfalfa, wheat, and sweet clover.<ref>Harry Giles, Dawson Creek, [http://www.calverley.ca/Part05-Dawson%20Creek/5-002.html "The Cross Roads of the North"] The Vancouver Province, 1953.</ref> The service and retail sector caters to the city's inhabitants, smaller nearby towns, and rural communities. However, there is significant [[Leakage#Retail|retail leakage]] to [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]], the closest major Alberta city, where there is no [[Sales taxes in Canada|provincial tax]] on retail purchases, while British Columbia charges 7%.<ref>{{cite news |first=Terry |last=O'Neill |title=Exasperation in B.C. |work=Newsmagazine (Alberta Edition) |publisher= |date=2000-03-13 |vol=23 |issue=49 |page=23}}</ref> In 2006, the BC government rejected a proposal to lower the sales tax in the province's border communities to 4%.<ref>[http://www.thegoldenstar.net/portals-code/list.cgi?paper=100&cat=23&id=804101&more= "Government rejects lower PST rate for B.C.’s border communities"] ''The Golden Star'' (January 2006). Retrieved on [[10 January]] [[2007]].</ref> The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of large-format retail stores into the small city. Residents still cross the border for high-priced items but now also purchase medium- and low-priced items from foreign-owned large-format chain stores.

British Columbia's first wind farm is expected to be constructed several miles southwest of the city in 2008.<ref>Hemmera (November 2006).

==Transportation and infrastructure==
[[Image:Dawson Creek BC outline.PNG|thumb|right|The City of Dawson Creek in relation to the highways and the Dawson Creek watercourse.]]
Dawson Creek's road network was laid out in the mid-20th century as the town rapidly expanded. The city maintains 88&nbsp;km (55&nbsp;mi) of paved and 11&nbsp;km (7&nbsp;mi) of unpaved roads.<ref name=redbook>Reed Construction (2006), ''Municipal redbook: an authoritative reference guide to local government in British Columbia'', Burnaby, BC, 27. {{ISSN|0068-161X}}</ref> The primary roads generally follow a grid pattern around large blocks of land. Because the grid contains many internal intersections with stops signs, traffic is forced onto two [[arterial road]]s: 8 Street going north–south and Alaska Avenue going southeast–northwest. These two roads meet at a traffic circle where a metal statue marks the beginning of the Alaska Highway. Officially designated [[British Columbia Highway 97|British Columbia Highway 97]], it runs north from Dawson Creek to Fort St. John and the [[Yukon]] – where it becomes Highway 1 – before reaching Alaska. The other highways emanating from Dawson Creek are the John Hart Highway, also 97 (southwest to [[Chetwynd, British Columbia|Chetwynd]] and [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]]), [[British Columbia Highway 2|Highway 2]] (south to Grande Prairie and southern Alberta), and [[British Columbia Highway 49|Highway 49]] (east to [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]] and northern Alberta). A road with few intersections along the southern and western borders of the city, incorporating a stretch of Highway 2, is designated as a "dangerous goods route" for heavy trucks so that they can avoid traveling through the city. However, Highway 49 has no direct access to such a ring road, so many trucks bound to or from the east use the city arterials, slowing traffic and damaging roads.

Dawson Creek is a regional node for air, rail, and bus services. The [[Dawson Creek Airport]], which services commercial flights by [[Central Mountain Air]], was built in 1963; its 1,524&nbsp;m (5,000&nbsp;ft) runway was paved in 1966. There are larger airports in Fort St. John and Grande Prairie that maintain more comprehensive flight schedules. Passenger rail service was available in Dawson Creek between 1931 and 1974. Service began when the [[Northern Alberta Railways]] (NAR) built its northwest terminus in the town and was extended in 1958 to [[Vancouver]] with a rail line through the Rocky Mountains. Passenger rail service ended as commodity shipments of grains, oil and gas by-products, and forestry products became more important in the resource-based economy. [[Greyhound Lines]] maintains a bus station in Dawson Creek which connects the city to Vancouver, [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] (via Grande Prairie), and [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] (via [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]]).

The city draws its water supply from the [[Kiskatinaw River]], 18&nbsp;km (11&nbsp;mi) west of town. Before reaching the city, the water is pumped through a settling pond, two storage ponds, and a treatment plant where it is [[flocculate]]d, filtered, and [[Chlorination|chlorinated]]. The city also provides drinking water for Pouce Coupe and rural residents. Sewage is processed by a lagoon system east of town and released into the Pouce Coupe River.<ref name=watershed/> Dawson Creek is located in [[School District 59 Peace River South]] which maintains five elementary schools ([[Tremblay Elementary School|Tremblay]], [[Parkhill Elementary School|Parkhill]], [[Ecole Frank Ross Elementary School|Frank Ross]], [[Crescent Park Elementary School (Dawson Creek, British Columbia|Crescent Park]], and [[Canalta Elementary School|Canalta]] elementary schools), one middle school (Central Middle School), and one high school ([[South Peace Secondary School]]). Established in 1975, [[Northern Lights College]]'s main campus is located in Dawson Creek and offers diplomas for two-year programs and degrees from the [[University of Northern British Columbia]].

==Culture, recreation, and media==
[[Image:Dawson Creek Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Dawson Creek Art Gallery in NAR Park.]]
The culture of Dawson Creek is centred around its designation as Mile "0" of the Alaska Highway. The Mile "0" post, depicted in the city flag, is located in the historic downtown area, one block south of the Northern Alberta Railways Park. This four-[[acre]] (1.6&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]]), mostly paved park is the gathering point for travellers. The park includes the Dawson Creek Art Gallery, which exhibits work by local artists and craftsmen. The Station Museum, connected to the art gallery, displays artifacts and exhibits associated with the construction of the NAR railway and the Alaska Highway. Other parks in Dawson Creek include the Mile Zero Rotary Park and the Walter Wright Pioneer Village. Annual events in the city include the Dawson Creek Symphonette and Choir performance, the Dawson Creek Art Gallery auction, the Dawson Creek Spring Rodeo, and the Peace Country Blue Grass Festival.<ref>[http://www.tourismdawsoncreek.com/majorevents.php Major Events in Dawson Creek.] Tourism Dawson Creek.

City recreation facilities include two ice hockey arenas, a curling rink, an indoor swimming pool, an outdoor ice rink, and a speed skating oval. The South Peace Community Multiplex, a new facility under construction on the outskirts of the city, will replace the swimming pool.<ref>[http://www.southpeacemultiplex.com/ South Peace Multiplex.] City of Dawson Creek.

It will feature an indoor rodeo arena and a 4,000-seat convention centre/ice arena, complete with skyboxes. Nearby Bear Mountain, located south of the city, provides over 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) of snowshoeing and cross-country skiing trails, as well as areas for downhill skiing and about 500&nbsp;km (300&nbsp;mi) of trails for snowmobiles, mountain bikes, and all-terrain vehicles.

Dawson Creek is served by several regional newspapers. The ''Dawson Creek Daily News'' (formerly ''Peace River Block Daily News'') and Fort St. John's ''Alaska Highway News'', both part of the [[Canwest Global]] chain of local papers, are dailies available in the city. The ''Northeast News'' is a free weekly published in Fort St. John which has sub-offices in Dawson Creek and Fort Nelson. The only radio station broadcasting from Dawson Creek is [[CJDC (AM)|890 CJDC AM]], which first went on air in 1947.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.calverley.ca/Part05-Dawson%20Creek/5-017.html |title=The Birth of RadioO Station CJDC |accessdate=2008-04-16 |last=Calverley |first=Dorthea |coauthors=Gordon Cummings |work=Calverley Collection}}</ref> Originating in Chetwynd, [[CHET-FM|94.5 Peace FM (CHET)]] is rebroadcast in Dawson Creek.
