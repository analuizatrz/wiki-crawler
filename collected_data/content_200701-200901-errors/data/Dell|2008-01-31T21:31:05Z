'''Dell Inc.''' ({{nasdaq|DELL}} {{hkex|4331}}), an [[United States|American]] technology-company based in [[Round Rock, Texas]], develops, manufactures, sells and supports [[personal computer]]s, [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[data storage device | data-storage device]]s, [[network switch | network-switch]]es, [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), [[computer software |software]], [[television]]s, computer-[[peripheral]]s and other [[technology]]-related products. As of [[2006]], Dell employed more than 78,700 people worldwide. 

Dell grew through the 1980s and 1990s to become at one stage the largest seller of PCs and servers. It [[as of 2008 | currently]] holds the second spot in the hardware [[computer industry | computer-industry]] behind [[Hewlett-Packard]] after the latter's merger with [[Compaq]] in 2002.

In 2006, [[Fortune magazine]] ranked Dell as the 25th-largest company in the [[Fortune 500]] list, 8th on its annual [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/mostadmired/top20/ Top 20 list] of the most-admired companies in the United States. In 2007 Dell ranked 34th and 8th respectively on the equivalent lists for the year. A 2006 publication identified Dell as one of 38 high-performance companies in the [[S&P 500]] which had consistently out-performed the market over the previous 15 years.<ref>Mark L. Frigo, Belvard E. Needles and Marian Powers: "Strategy and Integrated Financial Ratio Performance Measures: Further Evidence of the Financial Performance Scorecard and High Performance Companies".

== History ==

[[Image:Michael Dell, square crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael Dell]], Founder of Dell.]]

=== Origins and evolution ===

{{proseline}}

While a student at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1984, [[Michael Dell]] founded the company as ''PC's Limited'' with capital of $1000<ref>{{cite book | last = Dell | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Dell | coauthors = Catherine Fredman | title = Direct from DELL | publisher = [[HarperCollins]] | date= 1999 | pages = pp. 13 | isbn = 0-88730-914-3 }}</ref>. Operating from Michael Dell's off-campus dorm room at [[Dobie Center]] [http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/corporate/speeches/msd/2003_05_17_msd_commencement.pdf], the [[startup company | startup]] aimed to sell [[IBM PC-compatible]] computers built from stock components. Michael Dell started trading in the belief that by selling personal computer-systems directly to customers, PC's Limited could better understand customers' needs and provide the most effective computing solutions to meet those needs. Michael Dell dropped out of school in order to focus full-time on his fledgling [[business]], after getting about $300,000 in expansion-capital from his family. 

In [[1985]], the company produced the first computer of its own design — the "Turbo PC" — which contained an [[Intel 8088]]-compatible processor running at a speed of 8&nbsp;MHz. PC's Limited advertised the systems in national computer-magazines for sale directly to consumers, and custom-assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. This offered buyers prices lower than those of retail brands, but with greater convenience than assembling the components themselves. Although not the first company to use this [[business model|model]], PC's Limited became one of the first to succeed with it. The company [[gross profit|grossed]] more than $73 million in its first year.

In 1989, PC's Limited set up its first on-site-service programs in order to compensate for the lack of local retailers prepared to act as service centers. Also in 1987, the company set up its first operations in the [[United Kingdom]]; eleven more international operations followed within the next four years. In June 1988, Dell's market capitalization grew by $30 million to $80 million from its [[initial public offering]] of 3.5 million shares at $8.50 a share. The company changed its name to "Dell Computer [[Corporation]]" in 1988.

In 1990, Dell Computer Corporation tried selling its products indirectly through warehouse-clubs and computer-superstores, but met with little success, and the company re-focused on its more successful direct-to-consumer sales model. In 1992, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's [[Fortune Global 500|500]] largest companies.

In 1996, Dell began selling computers via its web site. 

In 1999, Dell overtook [[Compaq]] to become the largest seller of [[personal computers]] in the [[United States|United States of America]] with $25 billion in revenue reported in January 2000. 

In 2002, Dell attempted to expand by tapping into the multimedia and home-entertainment markets with the introduction of [[television]]s, handhelds, and [[digital audio player]]s. Dell has also produced Dell-brand printers for home and small-office use. 

In 2003, at the annual company meeting, the stockholders approved changing the company name to "Dell Inc." to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers. 

In 2004, the company announced that it would build a new assembly-plant near [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]]; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million in incentives and tax breaks. In July, Michael Dell stepped aside as [[Chief Executive Officer]] while retaining his position as [[Chairman of the Board]]. Kevin B. Rollins, who had held a number of executive posts at Dell, was appointed the new CEO.

In 2005, the share of sales coming from international markets increased, as revealed in the company's press releases for the first two quarters of its fiscal 2005 year. In February 2005 Dell appeared in first place in a ranking of the "Most Admired Companies" published by [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]]. In November 2005 ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' magazine published an article titled "It's Bad to Worse at Dell" about shortfalls in projected earnings and sales, with a worse-than-predicted third-quarter financial performance — a bad omen for a company that had routinely underestimated its earnings. Dell acknowledged that faulty capacitors on the [[motherboards]] of the Optiplex GX270 and GX280 had already cost the company $300 million. The CEO, Kevin Rollins, attributed the bad performance partially to Dell's focus on low-end PCs.

In 2006, Dell purchased the computer hardware manufacturer [[Alienware]]. Dell Inc.'s plan anticipated Alienware continuing to operate independently under its existing management. Alienware expected to benefit from Dell's efficient manufacturing system.<ref>{{cite news | first=Louise | last=Lee | title= Dell Goes High-end and Hip | date= [[March 23]], [[2006]] | publisher=BusinessWeek | url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2006/tc20060323_034268.htm }}</ref>

On [[January 31]], 2007, Kevin B. Rollins, CEO of the company since 2004, resigned as both CEO and as a director, and Michael Dell resumed his former role as CEO. Investors and many shareholders had called for Rollins' resignation because of poor company performance. At the same time, the company announced that, for the fourth time in five quarters, earnings would fail to reach consensus analyst-estimates.

In February 2007, Dell became the subject of formal investigations by the US [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]]<ref>http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9002535&source=rss_news50</ref> and the US Attorney General for the Southern District of [[New York]].<ref>http://www.theage.com.au/news/Technology/Michael-Dell-founder-and-chairman-reprises-CEO-role-at-Dell/2007/02/01/1169919438424.html</ref> The company has not formally filed financial reports for either the third or fourth fiscal quarter of 2006, and several class-action lawsuits<ref>
http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8N1MLNO0.html
</ref> have arisen in the wake of its [[as of 2007|recent]] financial performance. Dell Inc's lack of formal financial disclosure would normally subject the company to de-listing from the [[NASDAQ]],<ref>
http://www.crn.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=193004297
</ref>
but the exchange has granted Dell a waiver, allowing the stock to trade normally.<ref>
http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/dailyarchives.jhtml?articleId=196903036
</ref> 

On [[1 March]], 2007, the company issued a preliminary quarterly earnings report which showed gross sales of $14.4 billion, down 5% year-over-year, and net income of $687 million (30 cents per share), down 33%. Net earnings would have declined even more if not for the effects of eliminated employee bonuses, which accounted for six cents per share. NASDAQ extended the company's deadline for filing financials to [[May 4]].<ref>

=== Dell and AMD ===

As part of the [[Alienware]] acquisition by Dell, some Alienware systems had AMD chips.  So on [[August 17]], 2006, a Dell [http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2006/2006_08_17_rr_000?c=us&l=en&s=corp press-release] stated that starting in September 2006, Dell Dimension desktop computers would have [[AMD]] processors and that later in the year Dell would release a two-socket, quad-processor server using [[AMD]] [[Opteron]] chips, moving away from using Dell's traditional [[Intel]] processors. 

[[CNET|CNet]]'s News.com on [[August 17]], [[2006]] [http://news.com.com/Dented+Dell+picks+up+AMD+chips+amid+SEC+probe/2100-1014_3-6106905.html?tag=nl cited] Dell's CEO Kevin Rollins as attributing the move to AMD processors to cost-advantage and to AMD technology. AMD's senior VP in commercial business, Marty Seyer, stated: "Dell's wider embrace of AMD processor-based offerings is a win for Dell, for the industry and most importantly for Dell customers."

On [[October 23]], 2006, Dell announced new AMD-based servers — the PowerEdge 6950 and the [[PowerEdge]] SC1435 — marking its entry into the AMD-based server-marketplace.

On [[November 1]], 2006, Dell's [http://news.com.com/Dell+puts+AMD-powered+notebooks+on+sale/2100-1006_3-6131558.html?tag=nefd.top website] began offering notebooks with AMD processors (the Inspiron 1501 with a 15.4-inch display) with the choice of a single-core MK-36 processor, dual-core Turion X2 chips or Mobile Sempron.

=== Dell and desktop Linux ===
==== First attempt in 2000 ====
In 1998, [[Ralph Nader]] asked Dell (and five other major [[Original equipment manufacturer| OEM]]s) to offer alternate operating systems to [[Microsoft Windows]], specifically including [[Linux]], for which "there is clearly a growing interest"<ref>

</ref>

The reason(s) for such a quick reversal remain the subject of debate. Court documents accused [[Microsoft]] of coercing OEMs to drop Linux:

<blockquote>
Microsoft executive Joachim Kempin described his plan of retaliation and coercion to shut down competition from Linux: "I am thinking of hitting the OEM harder than in the past with anti-Linux actions" and will "further try to restrict source code deliveries where possible and be less gracious when interpreting agreements — again without being obvious about it," continuing "this will be a delicate dance"''<ref>

</ref>
</blockquote>

While in a 2003 interview Michael Dell denied that Microsoft pressured Dell Inc. into doing an about-face with regard to desktop Linux, citing a lack of sales: "unfortunately the desktop Linux market didn't develop in volume. It's more of a server opportunity" but adding: "We continue to offer Linux on the desktop and there is nothing else to say."<ref>

</ref>
However, a 2004 report noted that Dell no longer offered preinstalled desktop Linux:

<blockquote>
So what does it mean "factory installed Linux"? If you want Dell to install Linux for you, first add on $119. But here is the annoying part. They won't send you a computer with Linux pre-installed. They sell you the computer and the boxes of software on the side, and then they make an appointment to send you someone who comes to your house or business and installs it there.''<ref>

==== Second attempt in 2007 ====

On [[February 26]] 2007 Dell announced that it had commenced a program to sell and distribute a range of computers with pre-installed [[Linux]] distributions as an alternative to [[Microsoft Windows]]. Dell indicated that [[Novell]]'s [[SUSE]] Linux would appear first.<ref>http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/9951/53/</ref>
However, Dell on [[February 27]], 2007 announced that its previous announcement related to certifying the hardware as ready to work with Novell SUSE Linux and that it (Dell) had no plans to sell systems pre-installed with Linux in the near future.<ref>

On [[June 27]], 2007, Dell announced on its Direct2Dell blog that it planned to offer more pre-loaded systems (the new Dell [[Inspiron]] desktops and laptops). After the [[Dell IdeaStorm| IdeaStorm]] site supported extending the bundles beyond the US market, Dell later announced more international marketing<ref>http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/06/27/19470.aspx</ref>. On [[August 7]], 2007, Dell officially announced that it would offer one notebook and one desktop in the UK, France and Germany with Ubuntu "pre-installed". Dell [[as of 2007|recently]] announced that it would offer [[Novell]]'s [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop]] on selected models in China, "factory-installed".<ref>http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/08/07/23816.aspx</ref> On the 30 November, Dell said that they have shifted 40,000 Ubuntu PCs. <ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2007/11/30/ubuntu_dell_sales/ |title=Dell moves 40,000 Ubuntu PCs |author=Ashlee Vance |publisher=Channel Register |date= 2007-11-30}} </ref> Later in [[24 January]] [[2008]], Dell in Germany, Spain, UK and France launch a second laptop, a XPS M1330 with [[Ubuntu 7.10]], for 849 euro or GBP 599 upwards. <ref> {{citeweb|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/24/dells-xps-m1330-with-ubuntu-pre-load-in-germany-only/ |title=Dell's XPS M1330 with Ubuntu pre-load in Germany, only |publisher=Engadget |date=2008-01-24}}

=== Michael Dell's return ===

On [[January 31]], [[2007]] Michael Dell returned to the company as CEO. As chairman of the board, Mr. Dell had significant input into the company's operations during Rollins' years as CEO. However with the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw immediate changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new blood brought in from outside the company.

Departures announced include:

* Kevin Rollins, [[CEO]]<ref name="crn_exec_depart">http://www.crn.com/sections/dell/dell.jhtml?articleId=197002299</ref>

Additions announced include:

* Michael Dell, [[CEO]] and co-Chairman of the Board (previously Chairman of the Board)
* Don Carty, [[CFO]] and co-Chairman of the Board (previously Board member)
* Michael R. Cannon, former CEO of [[Solectron]], as President, Global Operations<ref>http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/theticker/index.html</ref>
* Ron Garriques, who formerly headed [[Motorola]]'s mobile phone unit, as President, Global Consumer Group<ref>{{cite news | first=Philipp | last=Gollner | coauthors= Ritsuko Ando | title=Dell hires Motorola executive for consumer unit | date=[[2007-02-16]] | publisher=[[Reuters|Reuters.com]] | url =http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSWNAS126320070217?sp=true | work =SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) | pages = | accessdate = 2007-06-22 | language = }}</ref>

Mr. Dell announced a number of initiatives and plans (part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative) to improve the company's financial performance. These include:
* elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards
* reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Mr. Dell from 20 to 12
* in a noted departure from previous years, "build, partner, and buy" to increase services capabilities
* reduction of "[[bureaucracy]]"

Dell, Inc. appears{{Or|date=January 2008}} to have re-focussed on reduced costs rather than on [[innovation]], in line with the company's history of delivering units at the lowest cost possible via its direct-sales model. In an interview with ''[[Business Week]]'', Mr. Dell stated "this is a company which can execute quite a bit better on things it already knows how to do."<ref>

==== Manufacturing ====

Dell has a general policy of manufacturing its products close to its customers, implementing [[Just In Time (business)|Just-in-Time]] (JIT) manufacturing. Assembly of desktop computers for the North American market takes place at Dell plants in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]], [[Austin, Texas]], and [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}}; with servers built in Austin, Texas. 

Dell assembles computers for the [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] market in [[Limerick]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]], and employs about 4,500 people in that country. European Manufacturing Facility 1 (EMF1, opened in 1990) and EMF3 form part of the [[Raheen Industrial Estate]] near Limerick.

Dell's assembly-plants in [[China]] and [[Malaysia]] assemble 95% of Dell notebooks. Dell Inc has invested <!-- when ? --> an estimated 60 million US Dollars in a new manufacturing unit in [[Chennai]], India, to support the sales of its products in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Indian-made products will bear the "Made in India" mark on them. In 2007 the Chennai facility has the target of producing 400,000 desktop PCs, and in the later half of 2007 it will start producing notebook PCs and other products.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

== Technical support ==

<!--specific criticism removed, and some content moved to the criticism section below, where appropriate - do not re-add here. -->

===Levels ===
Dell routes technical support queries according to component-type and to the level of support purchased. Dell Inc brands its service agreements at four levels:<ref>
[http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/services/en/ess_comparisonchart?c=us&cs=555&l=en&s=biz Dell support levels]
</ref>

* Basic support provides business-hours telephone support and next business-day on-site support. 

* Silver support provides 24&times;7 telephone support and 4-hour on-site support after telephone-based troubleshooting. 

* Gold support provides additional benefits over and above Silver support, including: customer-declared severity; priority access to support; expedited escalation of support; 4-hour on-site support in parallel with telephone-support.

* Platinum Plus support provides additional benefits to Gold Support, including: performance benchmarking; real-time tracking; custom planning and reporting; a dedicated technical account-manager.

=== Service Tags ===

Dell associates a ''Service Tag'', a unique alpha-numeric identifier, with most of its products, which resembles a [[serial number]]. The Service Tag number, represented in [[base 36]], has a length of five or seven characters. Software can read the Service Tag in a computer's [[Desktop Management Interface|DMI]] table. Monitors bought as part of a computer system get support via the Service Tag of the computer. Monitors bought separately get support via the Dell Order Number or via the monitor's serial number.

=== DellConnect ===

The DellConnect program, a remote-access tool, gives technicians within Dell Support the ability to access customer computers from a remote location for troubleshooting purposes. By using this tool, support technicians can analyze the configuration of a computer system, view and edit its files and software environment, view and comment on the screen, or take control of the computer system (with the customer's approval) to carry out troubleshooting.

As of 2007 Dell Inc replaced its proprietary remote-access tool with the newer [http://www.dellconnect.com DellConnect 2.0] manufactured by [[Citrix Systems|Citrix]]. After going to the website, the customer simply runs this software, which can permit a support technician to view and work on their computer from a remote location; including the ability to reboot the computer remotely and continuing the same session, to share clipboards, and to redirect the customer to a specific website.

=== World-wide technical support ===

In the Americas, Dell has [http://www1.ca.dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/ca/corporate/pressoffice/en/2005/2005_12_09_ott_000?c=ca&l=en&s=corp Customer Contact Centers] in Edmonton, Alberta; Ottawa, Ontario; Central Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; Nashville, Tennessee; Chesapeake; Twin Falls, Idaho; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; San Salvador, El Salvador; as well as in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia; Panama City, Panama and Tampa, Florida.

In the Asia-Pacific region Dell provides customer support from Pasay City, Philippines; Penang, Malaysia; and Xiamen and Dalian, China. 

In India, Dell has customer support centers in the northern cities of Gurgaon and Mohali; and in the southern cities of Hyderabad and Bangalore.<ref>
http://ipcommunications.tmcnet.com/news/2006/10/06/212847.htm
</ref>

== Commercial aspects ==
=== Traditional business model ===

Traditionally, Dell has sold all its products — whether to [[end user|end-use]] consumers or to corporate customers — using a direct-sales model via the [[Internet]] and the [[telephone]]-network. Dell maintains a negative [[cash conversion cycle]] through use of this model: in other words, Dell Inc. receives payment for the products before it has to pay for the materials. Dell also practices [[Just In Time (business)|just-in-time]] (JIT) inventory-management, profiting from its attendant benefits. Dell’s JIT approach utilizes the “pull” system by building computers only after customers place orders and by requesting materials from suppliers as needed. In this way Dell mirrors [[Toyota]] by following [[The Toyota Way| Toyota Way]] Principle #3 ("Use 'pull' systems to avoid overproduction"). Since the days of the original dominance of telephone-ordering, the Internet has significantly enhanced Dell’s business-model, making it easier for customers and potential customers to contact Dell directly. This model also has enabled Dell to provide very customizable systems at an affordable rate, since Dell manufacturing builds specifically for each customer. Other computer-manufacturers, including [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]], have attempted to adapt{{Fact|date=July 2007}} this same business-model, but due to timing and/or retail-channel pressures{{Fact|date=July 2007}} they have not achieved the same results as Dell.

Dell has also sold at retail, as explained in ''Marketing''. 

=== Organization ===

A [[Board of Directors]] of nine people runs the company. [[Michael Dell]], the founder of the company, serves on the board. Other board members include [[Donald J. Carty|Don Carty]], [[William Gray]], [[Judy Lewent]], [[Klaus Luft]], [[Alex Mandl]], [[Michael A. Miles]], and [[Sam Nunn]]. [[Shareholder]]s elect the nine board members at [[meeting]]s, and those board members who do not get a majority of votes must submit a [[resignation]] to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation. The board of directors usually sets up five committees which have oversight over specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues, including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Finance Committee, which handles [[financial]] matters such as proposed mergers and acquisitions; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters (including nomination of the board); and the Antitrust Compliance Committee, which attempts to prevent company practices from violating [[antitrust]] laws.

The corporate structure and management of Dell extends beyond the board of directors. The Dell Global Executive Management Committee sets the strategic direction for how the corporation keeps customers at the forefront, from designing and manufacturing computer systems to offering products that meet customers' requirements to providing sufficient service and support. Dell has regional senior vice presidents for countries other than the United States, including David Marmonti for [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] and Stephen J. Felice for [[Asia]]/[[Japan]]. [[As of 2007]], other officers include Martin Garvin (senior vice president for worldwide procurement) and [[Susan Sheskey|Susan E. Sheskey]] (vice president and [[chief information officer]]).

=== Marketing ===

Dell [[advertisement]]s have appeared in several types of [[Mass media|media]] including [[television]], the [[Internet]], [[magazines]], [[Mail-order catalog|catalogs]] and [[newspapers]]. Some of Dell Inc's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, offering free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and offering free shipping in order to encourage more sales and to stave off competitors. In 2006, Dell [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060223_710372.htm?chan=search cut its prices] in an effort to maintain its 19.2% market share. However, this also cut profit-margins by more than half, from 8.7 to 4.3 percent. To maintain its low prices, Dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the [[Internet]] and through the telephone network, and to move its customer-care division to [[India]] and [[El Salvador]].<ref>
http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_03_20_ndi_000?c=us&l=en&s=corp
</ref>

A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor [[Ben Curtis (actor)|Ben Curtis]] playing the part of "Steven", a lightly mischievous blond-haired kid who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!" 

A subsequent advertising campaign featured [[intern]]s at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).

A Dell advertising campaign for the XPS line of gaming computers featured in print in the September 2006 issue of [[Wired Magazine]]. It used as a [[tagline]] the common term in [[Internet]] and [[gamer]] slang: "[[FTW]]", meaning "For The Win". However, Dell Inc. soon dropped the campaign.

In the [[first-person shooter]] game [[F.E.A.R. Extraction Point]], several computers visible on desks within the game have recognizable Dell XPS model characteristics, sometimes even including the Dell logo on the monitors.

In 2007 Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from [[BBDO]] to [[Mother (disambiguation)| Mother]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}} In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from the [[The Flaming Lips| Flaming Lips]] and [[Devo]] who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad "Work it Out".

==== Dell kiosks ====

[[Image:Chermside dell kiosk.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Dell Direct Store, Brisbane, Queensland]]

Starting in 1994, Dell opened [[kiosk]] locations in [[shopping mall]]s across the United States in order to give personal service to customers who preferred this method of shopping to using the Internet or the telephone-system. Despite the added expense, prices at the kiosks match or beat prices available through other retail channels. Starting in 2005, Dell expanded [[kiosk]] locations to include [[shopping malls]] across [http://www.dell.com.au/delldirectstore Australia], [http://www.dell.ca/delldirectstore Canada], [http://www1.ap.dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/ap/topics/main/en/direct_kiosk?c=sg&l=en&s=dhs Singapore] and [[Hong Kong]].

==== Dell stores in the U.S. ====

In [[2006]] Dell Inc. opened two full stores, each 3,000-square-foot in area, at [[NorthPark Center]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] and [[Palisades Center]] in [[West Nyack, New York]]. It operates the 3,000-square-foot retail outlets seven days a week to display about 36 models, including PCs and televisions. As at the kiosks, customers can only see demonstration-computers and place orders through agents. Dell then delivers purchased items just as if the customer had placed the order by phone or over the Internet. 

Dell Inc plans to use the Dallas and West Nyack stores to house about three times as many products as it displays in more than 160 kiosks in malls and airports.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} In addition to showcasing products, the stores also supports on-site warranties and non-warranty service ("Dell on Call"). Services offered include repairing computer video-cards and removing spyware from hard drives.

==== Retail in the U.S. ====
In the early 1990s, Dell products were also sold at [[Best Buy]], [[Costco]] and [[Sam's Club]] stores in the U.S. Dell stopped this practice in 1994, citing low profit margins on the business. In 2003, Dell products were briefly sold in [[Sears]] stores in the U.S. In 2007, Dell started shipping its products to major retailers in the U.S. once again, starting with [[Sam's Club]] and [[Wal-Mart]]. [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], the largest office supply retailer in the U.S., and [[Best Buy]], the largest electronics retailer in the U.S., became Dell's next retail partners later that same year.

==== Direct retail in eastern Europe ====
Since shoppers in some foreign markets are not comfortable with purchasing technological products through the phone or the Internet, Dell has looked into opening retail operations in some of these countries.  In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in [[Budapest]]. In October of the same year, Dell opened a retail store in [[Moscow]]. 

==== Retail in the UK ====

Since December 2007, Dell XPS PCs have been available for sale at [[HMV Group plc|HMV]]'s flagship [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero]] store. From January 2008, Dell products have been sold by the UK stores of [[DSG International (retailer)|DSGi]] (in particular, through [[Currys]] and [[PC World (retailer)|PC World]] stores.)

=== Environmental responsibility ===

Dell became the first company in the [[information technology industry]] to establish a product-[[recycling]] goal (in 2004) and completed the implementation of its global consumer recycling-program in 2006.<ref>
http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/1421.html
</ref>
On [[February 6]], 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its "Recycling Works" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.<ref name="National Recycling Coalition">
http://www.nrc-recycle.org/recyclingworkswinners.aspx - National Recycling Coalition
</ref>
On [[July 19]], 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009.<ref>
http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070719/tx_dell_recycling.html?.v=1
</ref>
The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.<ref name="Dell Inc."> http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_07_19_rr_001?c=us&l=en&s=corp Dell Inc.
</ref>

On [[June 5]], 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company on Earth for the long term. The company launched a [[zero-carbon]] initiative that includes:

# reducing Dell's [[carbon intensity]] by 15 percent by 2012
# requiring primary suppliers to report carbon emissions data during quarterly business reviews
# partnering with customers to build the "greenest PC on the planet"
# expanding the company's carbon-offsetting program, "Plant a Tree for Me".

The company introduced the term "[[The Re-Generation]]" during a [[round table]] in London commemorating 2007 [[World Environment Day]]. "The Re-Generation" refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to make a [[difference]] in improving the world's environment. Dell also talked about plans to take the lead in setting an environmental standard for the "[[technology industry]]" and maintaining that [[leadership]] in the future.

=== Competition ===

Dell's major competitors include [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Lenovo]], [[Sony]], [[Acer (company)|Acer]], [[Toshiba]] and [[Asus]]. Dell and its subsidiary, [[Alienware]], compete in the enthusiast market against [[Falcon Northwest]], [[Voodoo PC]] (a division of HP), and other manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2006 Dell had between 18% and 19% share of the worldwide personal computer [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/07/19/pc_market_called_healthy_despite_weak_demand_in_europe market], compared to HP with roughly 15%. By leveraging its business-model, Dell attempts to undercut competitors and offer customers a more attractive choice of personal computers and other equipment. 

Dell [[as of 2006|in late 2006]] lost its once substantial lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard. Both [[Gartner]] and [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] estimated that in the third quarter of 2006, HP shipped [http://www.forbes.com/2006/10/19/dell-computer-earnings-markets-equity-cx_mk_1019markets07.html?partner=yahootix more units] worldwide than did Dell. Dell's 3.6% growth paled in comparison to HP's 15% growth during the same period. The problem got worse in the fourth quarter, when Gartner [http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070117006106&newsLang=en estimated] that Dell PC shipments declined 8.9% (versus HP's 23.9% growth). As a result, at the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share stood at 13.9% (versus HP's 17.4%).

IDC has also reported that Dell lost more server market share than any of the top four competitors in that arena. IDC's Q4 2006 estimates show Dell's share of the server market at 8.1%, down from 9.5% in the previous year. This represents a 8.8% loss year-over-year, primarily to competitors [[EMC]] and [[IBM]].<ref>

== Lawsuits and other legal action ==

* In 2005, Dell began the construction of a facility in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]].<ref>http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Oct_25/ai_n15732802</ref> Many claims emerged that Dell had used unfair practices to obtain huge incentives.<ref> http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/23/dell_nc_suit </ref>
Dell Inc. fought a lawsuit which the court system later dismissed.<ref> http://www.newsobserver.com/104/story/438280.html </ref>

* In October 2005, Dell filed a lawsuit in a Paris court to sue [[Minorca|Menorca]]-based independent website-designer Paul Dell [http://www.dellimages.com "Dellimages"] for engaging in “parasitism and unfair competition”. This related to his company website [http://www.dellwebsites.com "DellWebsites"].

* On [[January 31]], [[2007]], some shareholders filed a [http://www.betanews.com/article/Inside_the_Dell_Shareholder_Lawsuit_Did_Dell_and_Intel_Conspire/1170465943 lawsuit] accusing Dell and Intel of conspiring, and accusing Dell executives (including Michael Dell) of options-[[backdating]] and of propped [[financial report]]s. Some of the specific allegations were that Dell was receiving kickbacks from Intel to maintain Intel exclusitivity and using the funds to prop up their sales figures; at the same time it was alleged that Dell was reducing the period and scope of its warranties and cutting corners on manufacturing and testing to funnel additional funds to sales; and that these allegedly false sales figures caused the stock price to inflate to around $40 per share. It was also alleged that once stock prices peaked, several Dell executives, including Michael Dell, sold massive amounts of their personal stock holdings to benefit from the artificially inflated stock price.

* On [[February 8]], [[2007]], seven current and former workers at a call-center in [[Roseburg, OR|Roseburg]], [[Oregon]] sued the computer-maker, saying the company worked its [[sales representative|sales rep]]s "off the clock", failed to provide proper rest-breaks and improperly recorded their lunch-periods.<ref>http://atwork.blogs.oregonlive.com/uploads/487501-dellsuit.pdf</ref> Moves have begun to turn the case into a [[class action]]. The Roseburg, Oregon facility was eventually closed down by Dell on August 2, 2007 without any warning to employees.<ref>http://www.oregonnews.com/article/20070803/NEWS/70803011</ref> The facility consisted of computer and electronics sales agents, whose jobs were absorbed by other call centers, and customer service representatives, whose jobs were outsourced to a facility in El Salvador.

*In March 2007 an article titled "Computer Giant Faces Consumer Lawsuit Consumers Allege They Didn't Get the Tech Support They Paid For" appeared on ABC News website [http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Technology/story?id=3179394&page=1]
"Part of the suit claims that though Dell gave the impression of an "award-winning service" available to consumers "24 hours a day, seven days a week," consumers faced "nightmarish obstacles" to get help and technical service for their computers. [[New York]] [[Attorney General]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] said that New York had received 700 complaints about Dell — more than the number of complaints for any other related subject."

* In [[May]] [[2007]], Andrew Cuomo filed a lawsuit against Dell for "false advertising and deceptive business practices, including offering misleading financing, and failing to honor rebates, warranties and service contracts." [http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9719804-7.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20] Dell spokesman Bob Pearson portrayed the lawsuit as based on only a small portion of Dell's customers and as in no way reflecting the way the company treats its customers. Dell's hardware-warranty contract says that customers must troubleshoot over the phone — including possibly opening the computer — before Dell will send a technical service provider to replace a part.

== SEC investigation ==

On [[August 17]] [[2007]], the company announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices<ref>

</ref>
it would restate and reduce earnings from [[2003]] through to the first quarter of [[2007]] by a total amount of between $50 million and $150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share.

The investigation, begun in [[November]] [[2006]], resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted.<ref>

== Criticism ==

In the 1990s Dell switched from using primarily [[ATX]] [[motherboard]]s and [[Computer power supply|PSU]] to using boards and power-supplies with mechanically-identical but differently-wired connectors. However, company practice in this respect changed in 2003.<ref>

Consumer complaints about the quality of customer-service mounted<!-- when ? -->, and in 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer-service. Issues included call transfers<ref>
