{{Politics of Canada}}
{{dablink|The Canadian Monarchy is a shared monarchy.  This article describes the Monarchy from the perspective of [[Canada]]. In the other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, the constitutional role of the Monarchy is similar, but the historical and cultural significance may differ. For information on the Monarchy in the other Realms, see [[Monarchy in Canada#See also|Other Realms]].}}

'''[[Canada]]''' is a '''[[constitutional monarchy]]''' and a [[Commonwealth Realm]], with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[Queen regnant|reigning monarch]], since [[February 6]], [[1952]]. As such she is Canada's [[head of state]] and officially called [[Queen of Canada]]. 

Most of the Queen's political powers in Canada are exercised by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], though she does hold several powers that are hers alone. The Governor General is sometimes referred to as Canada's [[de facto head of state|''de facto'' head of state]]. <ref>[http://www.gg.ca/governor_general/role_e.asp Governor General: Role]</ref>

In Canada, the Queen's official title in [[English language|English]] is: ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, [[Head of the Commonwealth]], [[Defender of the Faith]].''

In [[French language|French]], the Queen's title is: ''{{lang|fr|Elizabeth Deux, par la grâce de Dieu, Reine du Royaume-Uni, du Canada et de ses autres royaumes et territoires, Chef du Commonwealth, Défenseur de la Foi}}.''

The [[heir apparent]] is Elizabeth II's eldest son, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]], who has no official title in Canada, but is accorded his UK title, [[Prince of Wales]], as a [[courtesy title]]. The [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] is expected to proclaim him King of Canada upon his accession to the Throne upon the [[demise of the Crown]]. There are several other members of the [[Monarchy in Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]] besides those aforementioned, including the Queen's other children and cousins.

==Constitutional monarchy in Canada==

===International and domestic role===
One of the most complicated features of the Canadian Monarchy is that it is a shared monarchy.

Fifty-three states are members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Sixteen of these countries are specifically [[Commonwealth Realm]]s who recognize, individually, the same person as their Monarch and [[Head of State]]; Canada is one of these. Despite sharing the same person as their respective national monarch, each of the Commonwealth Realms &mdash; including Canada &mdash; is sovereign and independent of the others.
{{See also|Personal union}}

==== Development of shared monarchy ====
The [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] provided the [[dominion]]s the right to be considered equal to Britain, rather than subordinate; an agreement that had the result of, in theory, a shared Crown that operates independently in each Realm rather than a unitary British Crown under which all the dominions were secondary. The Monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it has often been called "British" since this time (in both legal and common language) for reasons historical, legal, and of convenience.

The [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927]] was the first indication of this shift in law, further elaborated in the [[Statute of Westminster, 1931]].

Under the Statute of Westminster, Canada has a common monarchy with Britain and the other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, and though laws governing the line of succession to the Canadian throne lie within the control of the Canadian Parliament, Canada cannot change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship by means of a constitutional amendment. This situation applies symmetrically in all the other Realms, including the UK. These concepts were reasserted by Justice Rouleau in a 2003 [[O'Donohue v. Canada|court ruling]] in which he wrote that "Union under the British Crown together with other Commonwealth countries [is a] constitutional principle." (Note: here "British Crown" is the traditional reference to the Crown shared amongst the Realms, not the Crown in Right of the UK.)

On all matters of the Canadian State, the Monarch is advised solely by Canadian federal and provincial [[Minister (government)|minister]]s. Effective with the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], no British or other Realm government can advise the Monarch on any matters pertinent to Canada.<ref>In 1997, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] intended to offer a [[Life Peer]]age to Canadian businessman [[Conrad Black]]. Citing the 1919 [[Nickle Resolution]], the Canadian government advised the Queen that they have objected to such honours for many years. If Blair had not backed down, the Queen would have been in the situation of having to grant an [[honour]] on the advice of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and to object to the same as Queen of Canada on the advice of then Prime Minister of Canada [[Jean Chrétien]]. The problem was resolved when Black renounced his Canadian citizenship. Canada raised no further objections and he was granted his peerage, becoming Lord Black of [[Docklands|Crossharbour]].</ref>
{{See|Queen's Privy Council for Canada}}

"Queen Elizabeth II" is the current monarch's conventional title for all her Commonwealth Realms, but is generally addressed as "Queen of Canada" when she is actually present in Canada or when she otherwise performs duties relevant to Canada abroad, on the advice of her Canadian ministers. Some examples are conferring [[Canadian honours]] while in the [[United Kingdom]] or participating in the [[Vimy Memorial|Canadian World War II Memorial]] Ceremonies in [[France]].

In addition to the Queen's role in each of her Realms, the Canadian Monarch is also the nominal [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. Though this title does not imply any political power over member nations, and does not automatically belong to the monarch, only the shared monarch of the Commonwealth Realms has ever held this [[Title of authority|title]].

====Finance====
Contrary to common misconception, Canadians do not pay any monies to the Queen, either for personal income or to support the Royal residences outside of Canada. Only when the Queen is in Canada, or acting abroad as Queen of Canada, does any Canadian government support her in the performance of her duties. This rule applies equally to other members of the [[Canadian Royal Family|Royal Family]].

Provincial and federal records of expenditures associated with the Crown are kept, but no official report on the cost of the monarchy to Canadians is compiled. However, every three years the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] issues a survey, based on various federal and provincial government budgets, expenditures and estimates, that outlines a yearly cost for the functioning of the Crown. The 2005 survey found that the institution cost Canadians roughly $49 million in 2004<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/Report.pdf ''$1.53 per Canadian: The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy, 2005'']</ref>. Previous surveys found that the overall cost of the Canadian Crown was $22 million in 1999 <ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costs.html ''The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: 74 Cents per Canadian'']</ref> and $34 million in 2002.<ref> [http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costofcrown.html ''The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: $1.10 per Canadian'']</ref><ref>[http://members.tripod.com/~constantian/expense2.html The Constantian Society. The [[Constantian Society]]'s detailed comparison of the costs of monarchies versus [[republic]]s.]</ref> (This does not take into account the inflation of the [[Canadian Dollar]] over these years).

Usually the Queen's Canadian governments pay only for the costs associated with the Governor General and Lieutenant-Governors in their exercising of the powers of the Crown on behalf of the Queen, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonial occasions, etc.

===Constitutional role===
[[Constitution of Canada|Canada's constitution]] is made up of a variety of statutes and conventions that are either British or Canadian in origin, which gives Canada a similar parliamentary system of government as the other Commonwealth Realms.

[[Image:EIIR-Canadian Parliament.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] reads the [[Throne Speech]] in a joint session of the [[Canadian Parliament]], 1977, accompanied by her husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].]]
All powers of State are constitutionally reposed in the Monarch, who is represented at the federal level by the [[Governor General of Canada]] and at the provincial level by [[Lieutenant-Governor]]s. The Governor General is appointed by the Monarch upon the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]]. The ten Lieutenant-Governors are appointed by the Governor General, in the name of the Monarch, upon the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada, in consultation with the relevant provincial premier, though the Monarch is informed of the Prime Minister's decision before the Governor General gives Assent.
:''Further information: [[Governor General of Canada#Governmental role|Governor General of Canada: Governmental role]]''

====Provinces====
{{Main|Monarchy in the Canadian provinces}}
Across the country the Canadian Crown is unitary. Under this system the [[Head of State|headship of state]] is not a part of either the federal or provincial jurisdictions; through the Governor General and Lieutenant Governors, the Queen reigns impartially over the country as a whole; meaning the [[sovereignty]] of the provinces is passed on not by the Governor General or the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]], but through the Crown itself.  This means that the Crown is "divided" into eleven legal jurisdictions; into eleven "crowns" - one federal and ten provincial.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/CMN_winter_spring_2003_Update-3.pdf Jackson, Michael; ''Canadian Monarchist News'': Golden Jubilee and Provincial Crown; Spring, 2003]</ref><ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/CMN_winter_spring_2003_Update-3.pdf Jackson, Michael; ''Canadian Monarchist News'': Golden Jubilee and Provincial Crown; Spring, 2003]</ref>

Because the Canadian Monarch does not reside in any of the provinces, a [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]] serves as the Queen's representative in the province, carrying out all the Monarch's constitutional and ceremonial duties of state on her behalf. The [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] appoints the Lieutenant Governors on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], and in consultation with the relevant provincial premier.

The [[Commissioner]]s of Canada's territories of [[Nunavut]], [[Yukon]], and [[Northwest Territories]] are appointed by the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]], at the recommendation of the federal [[Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)|Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]]. But as the territories are not sovereign entities, the commissioners are ''not'' representatives of the Sovereign. They receive instruction from the said Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

====Duties====
Most of the Queen's domestic duties are performed by the Governor General at the national level and the Lieutenant-Governors at the provincial level.

As in the UK, the Monarch's role, and thereby the vice-regal's role, is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments operate, and the powers that are constitutionally hers are exercised wholly upon the advice of the elected government.  Since the death of [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1714, the last monarch to head the British cabinet (when almost all of Canada was still French colonial territory), that the monarch "reigns" but does not "rule". In Canada, this has been true since the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] ended the reign of Canada's last absolute monarch, King [[Louis XV of France]].

In exceptional circumstances, however, the Monarch or vice-regal has acted against such advice based upon his or her [[reserve power]]s — as when Governor General [[Baron Byng|Julian Byng]] refused a request by Prime Minister [[W.L. Mackenzie King|William Mackenzie King]] for a dissolution of Parliament and call for new elections. Also, [[Monarchy in Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta]], [[John C. Bowen]], in 1937 refused to grant Royal Assent to three bills passed by [[William Aberhart]]'s [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] government on the [[William Aberhart#Political career|grounds that they were unconstitutional]],<ref>[http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pub/gdbook/Part1/page2.htm The Citizen's Guide to the Alberta Legislature Part I: The Foundation]</ref> and [[Monarchy in Saskatchewan|Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan]] [[Frank Lindsay Bastedo]] refused Royal Assent to a bill in [[1961]].<ref>[http://www.gr.gov.sk.ca/PDFs/Monarchy%20in%20Saskatchewan.pdf ''Monarchy in Saskatchewan'']</ref>
{{see|King-Byng Affair}}

There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent by the [[Queen regnant|Queen]]. These include: signing the appointment papers of Governors General, the confirmation of awards of Canadian honours by the Governor General, and approving any change in the title of the Queen as Queen of Canada.<ref>[http://www.empireclubfoundation.com/details.asp?SpeechID=562&FT=yes Speech by Governor General Roland Michener, Nov. 19, 1970]</ref> On occasion the Monarch must personally act directly in [[partisan (political)|partisan]] affairs. For example, this occurred when Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] advised Queen Elizabeth II to expand the number of [[Canadian Senate|Senate]] seats to assure passage of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|GST]]. The Queen followed his advice, and as such, Mulroney became [[accountability|accountable]] for that [[advice]].

It is also possible that if the Governor General decided to go against the Prime Minister's or the government's advice, the Prime Minister could appeal directly to the Monarch, or even recommend that the Monarch dismiss the Governor General.

====Succession====
Succession to the throne is by [[primogeniture|male-preference primogeniture]], and governed by the provisions of the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]], as well as the [[English Bill of Rights]]. These documents, though originally passed by the [[Parliament of England]], are now part of Canadian constitutional law, under control of the Canadian parliament only.

This legislation lays out the rules that the Monarch cannot be a [[Roman Catholic]], nor married to one, and must be in communion with the [[Church of England]] upon ascending the throne. This has led to a legal challenge (''see [[O'Donohue v. Canada, 2003|O'Donohue v. Her Majesty the Queen]]''). As Canada's laws governing succession are currently identical to those of the United Kingdom (by the Statute of Westminster) see [[Succession to the British Throne]] for more information.

===Legal role===
All laws in Canada are enacted with the sovereign's, or the vice-regal's signature, though there is some debate over whether the monarch is constitutionally allowed to personally grant Royal Assent to provincial bills.  Thus, all bills begin with the phrase "Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows."<ref>[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=2604319&file=4 Bill C43: ''An Act to provide for consultations with electors on their preferences for appointments to the Senate'']</ref>  The granting of a signature to a bill is known as [[Royal Assent]]; it and proclamation are required for all acts of Parliament and of the provincial legislatures, usually granted or withheld by the Governor General or Lieutenant-Governor, with the [[Great Seal of Canada]], or the appropriate provincial seal. The Vice-Regals may reserve a bill for the Monarch's pleasure, that is to say, allow the Monarch to make a personal decision on the bill. A Lieutenant-Governor of a province may similarly defer to the Governor General (who may in turn defer to the Monarch). The Monarch has the power to disallow a bill (within a time limit specified by the constitution). Recently activists opposed to [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Bill C-38]] lobbied Queen Elizabeth II to disallow the legislation after it was passed by parliament. However it received Royal Assent from The Right Honourable Beverley McLachlin, Deputy of the Governor General on [[July 20]], [[2005]]. Territorial legislatures, unlike their provincial counterparts, are subject to the oversight of the Government of Canada.
{{see|Royal Prerogative}}

[[Image:Canadian_Supreme_Court_justices_circa_1950.jpg|right|thumb|In the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is displayed the [[Coat of arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]]]]
The Sovereign is deemed the "fount of justice," and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects. The Sovereign does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead, judicial functions are performed in his or her name.  The common law holds that the Sovereign "can do no wrong"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences.  Civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the Monarch personally are not cognizable. The Sovereign, and by extension the Governor General, also exercises the "prerogative of mercy," and may pardon offences against the Crown. Pardons may be awarded before, during, or after a trial.

In Canada the legal personality of the [[State]] is referred to as "Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada", and likewise for the provinces and territories (i.e., "in Right of Ontario," etc.). For example, if a lawsuit is filed against the federal government, the respondent is formally described as Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. The monarch as an individual takes no more role in such an affair than in any other business of government. For example, a case in which a province sues the federal government would formally be called ''Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Prince Edward Island v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada''.

In addition, the Monarch also serves as a symbol of the legitimacy of Courts of Justice, and of their judicial authority. An image of the Queen or the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of Canada]] is always displayed in Canadian courtrooms, except in the province of [[British Columbia]] where the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of the United Kingdom]] are displayed as a symbol of its judiciary.<ref>[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/index.asp Courts of British Columbia]</ref> [[Itinerant]] judges will display an image of the Queen and the Canadian flag when holding a session away from established courtrooms. Such situations occur in parts of Canada where the stakeholders in a given court case are too isolated geographically to be able to travel for regular proceedings.
{{See|The Crown}}

===Cultural role===
[[Image:Victoriacrosscanadapostagestampimage.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Victoria Cross (Canada)|Victoria Cross]] is the highest decoration in the [[Canadian honours system]]. Its motto "For Valour" was adopted on the recommendation of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]]]

==== Representation of the State ====
At one time the Monarchy was considered a purely British institution, when most Canadians still continued to be both legally, and by personal view, British subjects. However, paralleling the changes in constitutional law, and the evolution of Canadian nationalism, the cultural role of the Monarchy in Canada altered.

The federal and provincial governments now recognize and promote the Queen's role as Monarch of Canada as separate to her position as Queen of the United Kingdom. <ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/senate//Monarchy/SenMonarchy_15-e.htm Canada: a Constitutional Monarchy]</ref><ref>[http://canada.gc.ca/howgoc/queen/quind_e.html Biography: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Queen of Canada]</ref><ref>[http://www.gr.gov.sk.ca/protocol/Practice/crown_in_canada.htm Saskatchewan Government Relations: The Crown in Canada]</ref>  Today the Sovereign is regarded as the personification of the State, and is the "personal symbol of allegiance, unity and authority for all Canadians."<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/ENGLISH.pdf The Crown in Canada]}}</ref>

Elizabeth II stated in 1973:
: "But it is as Queen of Canada that I am here, Queen of Canada and of all Canadians, not just of one or two ancestral strains. I want the Crown to be seen as a symbol of national sovereignty belonging to all. It is not only a link between Commonwealth nations, but between Canadian citizens of every national origin and ancestry."

The [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|oath of allegiance]] to Canada, sworn by new [[citizenship|citizens]], the [[Canadian Forces]], [[police]] officers, and [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentarians]], is an oath of allegiance to the monarch as sovereign of Canada, and to his/her heirs and successors according to law. The relationship between the Oath taker and the Monarch is a complex one with roots reaching back to historical periods when a monarch ruled and accepted an Oath of [[fealty]]. Modern Oaths are still [[reciprocal]], but now the Oath taker places their allegiance to the continuing State, its laws, etc., as embodied by the Monarch. As the legal personality of the [[State]], the Monarch has obligations to the Oath taker. The Monarch's acceptance of her responsibilities to her subjects is symbolized by the [[Coronation]] Oath, where he or she promises "to govern the Peoples of... Canada... according to their respective laws and customs."<ref>[http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/coronation/cor1953b.html The Form and Order of Service that is to be performed and the Ceremonies that are to be observed in the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster, on Tuesday, the second day of June, 1953]</ref>

From time to time members of the Royal Family will also represent Canada abroad. The first occasion of this was when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] dedicated the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial|Vimy Memorial]] in July, [[1936]], one of his few duties performed during his short reign.  In 1939, King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and Queen [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth]] visited the [[United States]] as King and Queen of Canada, accompanied by Prime Minister [[Mackenzie King]], as opposed to a British minister. As well, in 1959 the Queen undertook a [[state visit]] to the United States as Queen of Canada, hosting the return dinner for then-[[President of the United States|US President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] at the Canadian embassy in Washington.

The Queen, Prince Charles, and the Princess Royal have also participated in Canadian ceremonies for the anniversary of [[D-Day]] in France, most recently in 2004,<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit2005/timeline_e.cfm Canadian Heritage: Timeline: The Queen]</ref> as well as Canadian events in the UK, such as when The Queen dedicated the Canadian War Memorial in [[Green Park]], [[London]], in 1996; opened [[Canada House]]; or when a reception is held for Canadians at [[Buckingham Palace]].
{{rquote|right|''The Canadian Crown continues as a key element of our parliamentary democracy and an enduring symbol that represents all generations of Canadians and the best that is our country.''<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit2005/53_e.cfm Canadian Heritage: 2005 Royal Visit: The Queen and Canada: 53 Years of Growing Together]</ref>| [[Department of Canadian Heritage]], 2005}}

In Canada major [[public inquiries]] are called [[Royal Commission]]s, and are created by the [[Cabinet]] on behalf of the Monarch through a [[Royal Warrant]].

==== Title ====
One of the first post-war examples of Canada's status as an independent monarchy was the alteration of the Monarch's title, by the [[Royal Style and Titles Act]]. For the first time the official Canadian title mentioned Canada separately from the United Kingdom and the other Realms, to highlight the Monarch's role specifically as Queen of Canada, as well as the shared aspect of the Crown throughout the Realms: Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God ''of'' the United Kingdom, ''Canada'' and Her other Realms and Territories ''Queen'', Head of the Commonwealth, [[Defender of the Faith]].

When the [[Canadian House of Commons]] debated the Queen's title in 1953, Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent asserted on the nature of the separate and shared characteristics of the Crown:
::"Her Majesty is now Queen of Canada but she is the Queen of Canada because she is Queen of the United Kingdom … It is not a separate office" <ref>[http://www.crht.ca/LibraryShelf/QueenofCanada.html Canadian Royal Heritage Trust], [[Hansard]] [[February 3]], [[1953]], page 1566</ref>

This format was consistent with the form of the Queen's titles in the other Realms, as had been agreed upon by all the Realm governments in 1953. [[As of 2006]], only Canada and [[Grenada]] retain this form, all others, other than the UK, having dropped the reference to the United Kingdom.

Although the Queen's Canadian titles include "[[Defender of the Faith]] / ''{{lang|fr|Défenseur de la Foi}}''," neither the Queen, not any of the Governors has any religious role in Canada; there have been no [[established church]]es in Canada since before [[Canadian Confederation|confederation]]. This is one of the key differences from the Queen's role in the United Kingdom where she is [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].

In a speech to the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1953, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Louis St. Laurent]] stated on this topic:
: "… The rather more delicate question arose about the retention of the words defender of the faith. In England there is an established church. In our countries [the other monarchies of the Commonwealth] there are no established churches, but in our countries there are people who have faith in the direction of human affairs by an all-wise Providence; and we felt that it was a good thing that the civil authorities would proclaim that their organisation is such that it is a defence of the continued beliefs in a supreme power that orders the affairs of mere men, and that there could be no reasonable objection from anyone who believed in the Supreme Being in having the sovereign, the head of the civil authority, described as a believer in and a defender of the faith in a supreme ruler."
{{see|List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II}}

==== Symbols ====
[[Image:Royal Standard of Canada.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Queen's Personal Canadian Flag]]]]

Despite the removal or replacement of certain monarchical symbols as national symbols through the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the fact that the [[Monarchy in Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Canada's Royal Family]] is not resident in Canada itself, the Crown remains a visible part of the everyday lives of Canadians. What were formerly purely British symbols became symbols of the Monarch, or loyalty thereto.

The [[Union Jack|Royal Union Flag]] remains an official flag in Canada, though a distinctly [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]] was adopted in 1964 as the National Flag. ''[[God Save the Queen]]'' remains the [[royal anthem]] and forms part of the Canadian Royal Salute, which is performed by playing the Royal Anthem followed by the National Anthem, ''[[O Canada]]''. The [[Vice Regal Salute]] also includes the first six bars of ''God Save the Queen'', which then modulate into the first four and last four bars of ''O Canada''. The relevant Vice-Regal Salutes are played only for the Governor General and each Lieutenant-Governor as they represent Canada's Monarch.<ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces; pg. 404]</ref>

A [[The Loyal Toast|Loyal Toast]] is also performed at official functions whether or not the Sovereign is personally present; it consists of a [[Toast (honor)|toast]] to the health of Her Majesty the Queen, and is usually performed by the host or guest of honour at the ceremony, aside from the Queen herself.  In English the toast is: "Ladies and gentlemen, The Queen of Canada," and in French: "Mesdames et Messieurs, à la Reine du Canada."  In the mess of regiments where the Queen holds an honorary appointment, the toast is "Ladies and Gentlemen, The Queen of Canada, our Captain-General," and in French, "Mesdames et Messieurs, à la Reine du Canada, notre capitaine générale."  Where a band is present, ''God Save the Queen'' is to be played following the proposal of the toast.<ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces; pg. 449-450]</ref>

Images of St. Edward's, the Tudor, and King's Crown are also visible on police forces badges (see [[:Image:OPP Logo.jpg|Ontario Provincial Police badge]]), military badges (see [[:Image:Canadian Forces emblem.svg|Canadian Armed Forces Tri-service badge]]), some provincial, even personal [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] (see [[Coat of Arms of Quebec]]), on [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Canada's Royal Coat of Arms]], on various medals, and awards.

These latter cases reflect the monarch's place as the ceremonial head of the [[Canadian honours system]], termed the "[[fount of honour]]." As such, only she can approve the creation of an [[honour]], which she does as requested by government of Canada. Although, the Governor General administers most responsibilities relating to Canadian honours on the Queen's behalf. The most recent example of this is the Peace Officer Exemplary Service Medal which was approved by the Queen in December 2004,<ref>[http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=4336 Governor General announces the Peace Officer Exemplary Service Medal]</ref> and first presented by Governor General [[Michaëlle Jean]] in May 2006.<ref>[http://gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=4756 Her Excellency the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean Speech on the Occasion of the Inaugural Presentation of the Peace Officer Exemplary Service Medal]</ref>

The reigning monarch's image is traditionally printed on Canadian coins, some currency and postage stamps such as the [[Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamp (Canada)|Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamp]]. Portraits of the Monarch are often found in government buildings, military installations, many schools, as well as Canada's high commissions and embassies abroad.

In Canada, [[Victoria Day]] has become the holiday for celebrating Canada's monarchy. Traditionally the monarch's birthday — in the case of Queen Elizabeth II, [[April 21]] — is the day for honouring the reigning monarch. Since 1953, however, the official birthday of Canada's monarch has been [[Victoria Day]]. Originally the holiday was set by [[vice-regal]] proclamation on the first Monday before [[May 24]] of every year, but in 1957 the date of the national holiday was permanently fixed by statute.

Each year, since 1932, the Sovereign has delivered the [[Royal Christmas Message]] to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]; originally broadcast on the [[BBC]] [[BBC Empire Service|Empire Service]], in Canada it is today delivered on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] [[television]] and [[radio]].
{{see|National symbols of Canada |Canadian royal symbols}}

There are also hundreds of places named for Canadian monarchs and members of the Royal Family all across Canada.  No individual has been more honoured than Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] in the names of Canada's public buildings, streets, populated places and physical features.  The trend for naming places after the Sovereign began after the Queen granted [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|John Ross]] permission to name a small bay in the [[Northwest Passage]] after her.  Following this, explorers and mapmakers gave the name Victoria to a multitude of geographical features all over the Canadian map; her name appears more than 300 times.  Also, amongst the 280 postal divisions in Canada, more than half have at least one thoroughfare identified by the name Victoria.<ref>[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008358 ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'':Victoria]</ref>
{{see|List of places named after Queen Victoria}}

=====Artworks=====
Though images of sovereigns of Canada's territories have been present in the country since it was first settled by Europeans, only in the past century has Canada's royals been portrayed by Canadian artists.

Elizabeth II has been photographed by many of Canada's prominent photographers; the first formal picture being by Canadian [[Josef Karsh]], who took a portrait of Princess Elizabeth when she was 17. Just before she became Queen, Karsh also took a series of official pictures of the Princess in formal and informal poses. For her 1959 royal tour, the Queen asked to have a Canadian photographer take the pre-tour pictures, and Donald McKeague of Toronto was chosen. In 1967 Karsh was again commissioned to take a series of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh for the Centenary of [[Canadian Confederation]], resulting in a number of regal pictures taken at [[Buckingham Palace]]. Cavouk of Toronto took the next official photograph of the [[Queen of Canada]] in 1973.; his picture is sometimes called "the citizen Queen" because of its informality.  [[Rideau Hall]] photographer John Evans captured the Sovereign during her Silver Jubilee stay in Ottawa in 1977, showing her following her return from opening [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]], and wearing the [[Order of the Garter]] and the [[Order of Canada]] on a dress with gold fringes suggestive of an aboriginal princess. Karsh was once again entrusted with the task of photographing his Queen in 1984, creating a series that included a shot of Her Majesty with her [[Welsh Corgi|corgi]], Shadow. The most recent official Canadian picture of the Monarch was taken during her [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II#Canada|Golden Jubilee tour]] in October, 2002.

The Queen has also been the subject of many Canadian artists, including Hilton Hassell's painting of Princess Elizabeth square dancing at Rideau Hall, and [[Jean Paul Lemieux|Jean-Paul Lemieux]]'s ''affectionate memory images'' (1979), showing the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh with the Parliament Buildings in the background, combining the familiar and constitutional. ''The Queen on a Moose'' by Charles Pachter has become a Canadian cultural image. Jack Harmon, of [[British Columbia]], created the 1992 equestrian statue of Queen Elizabeth that stands on Parliament Hill in [[Ottawa]], and sculptor Susan Velder fashioned another equestrian statue of the Sovereign unveiled on the grounds of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building in June, 2003. Canadian coins carry the image of Her Majesty created by Dora de Pedery Hunt in 1989.<ref>[http://www.crht.ca/DiscoverMonarchyFiles/QueenElizabethII.html The Canadian Royal Heritage Trust: Queen Elizabeth II]</ref>

==== Royal presence ====
[[Image:1939 Toronto Oldcityhall royalvisit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old City Hall (Toronto)|Toronto City Hall]] during the 1939 Royal Visit.]]
For over 200 years members of the Royal Family have visited or lived in Canada. Though all of the Royal Family currently lives outside of the country, members are still regular visitors, enough so that on occasion [[royal visits to Canada]] are also referred to by monarchists as "Royal Homecomings." These events are often marked with a variety of ceremonies, the granting of honours and general celebrations, even though these events are not always official holidays.

The Queen regularly undertakes tours of Canada to celebrate Canadian culture, milestone anniversaries, military remembrances, and the like. Other Royals will perform the same tasks in the Queen's place, from time to time, usually on a less grand scale or for events of a lesser importance. These tours are at the invitation of, organized, and paid for by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]], provincial government, or a combination of both; hence, they are called "official tours" or "official visits."

==History==
{{main|History of monarchy in Canada}}
[[Image:Francis1-1.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Francis I of France]]; established colonies in [[Acadia]] and Canada, 1534]]

The first French and British colonizers of Canada interpreted the hereditary nature of some indigenous North American chieftainships as a form of monarchy, often referring to these leaders as kings and their lands as kingdoms.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/4Chiefs.html The Four Indian Kings]</ref> There is also evidence that the aboriginals had an understanding of monarchy, most notably in the legend of the [[Kingdom of Saguenay]], and tales of "wealthy kingdoms in the north" told by [[Iroquois|Iroquoians]] to [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534.<ref>[http://www.carsten-rex.de/History/history.html Canada: History]</ref><ref>[http://www.macleans.ca/switchboard/article.jsp?content=20031027_68038_68038 Ferguson, Will; ''The Lost Kingdom''; ''Macleans'', October 27, 2003]</ref>

Canada has been the territory of a monarchy or a monarchy in its own right, since the establishment of [[New France]]. Territory of the [[List of French monarchs|French Crown]] was merged with the North American colonies under the [[British monarchy|British Crown]] with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. In 1867, Canada became a self-governing [[Dominion]] under the British Crown (originally intended to be named the [[Canada's name#Adoption of Dominion|Kingdom of Canada]]), and, from that date to the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982, Canada developed into a kingdom in its own right. Thus, kings and queens reigning over Canada have included the [[List of French monarchs|monarchs of France]] (from [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1534 to [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in 1763), [[List of British monarchs|those of the UK]] (from [[Anne of Great Britain]] in 1713 to [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] in 1952), to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Canada today.

Canada's growth into a sovereign constitutional monarchy, with a Crown separate to that of the United Kingdom, was demonstrated in the abdication of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] in 1936; when Canada had to pass its own ''Succession to the Throne Act'', that effected changes to the rules of succession in Canada so that they matched those within the other Realms of the British Empire.<ref>[http://www.canlii.org/on/cas/onsc/2003/2003onsc11019.html O'Donohue v. Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada]</ref> A few years later Canada's new status was again demonstrated when [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] traveled from Canada into the United States as King and Queen of Canada, being accompanied by Prime Minister [[Mackenzie King]] as the sole Minister in Attendance, and not a British minister.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/05/0532/053201/053201130206_e.html The Royal Tour of 1939]</ref>

Various members of the Royal Family have often served as the vice-regal representative of the British, and later Canadian monarch. These included [[John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Lord Lorne]], who was appointed as Governor General of Canada in 1878, HRH [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Prince Arthur]], Duke of Connaught, appointed in 1911, and [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone]], who arrived in Canada as the vice-regal in 1940.

The present Queen has been present in Canada more than any other monarch before her, having toured the country more than 22 times, being present for events such as the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]], the commemoration of the Charlotte and Quebec conferences, Canada's centennial, the [[Expo 67|Montreal Expo]], her Proclamation of the Constitution Act 1982, her Silver and Golden Jubilees, and to mark the anniversaries of the entry of many provinces and territories into confederation.
{{see|Royal visits to Canada}}

Through the 1960s and 1970s, the rise of [[Quebec nationalism]] and changes in Canadian identity created an atmosphere where the purpose and role of the Canadian Monarchy [[Debate on the Canadian monarchy|came into question]]. Some references to the Monarch and the Monarchy were slowly removed from the public eye, and moves were made by the government to constitutionally alter the monarchy's place and role in Canada. The premiers of the provinces reacted strongly against these proposals.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/Sum04PDFRepublicanism.pdf#search='quebec%20monarchy' Dr. Stephen Phillips; Republicanism in Canada in the reign of Elizabeth II: the dog that didn't bark]</ref>

The ''[[Constitution Act of 1982]]'' entrenched the monarchy in Canada. Any change to the position of the monarch or the monarch's representatives in Canada now requires the consent of the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]], the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]], and the legislative assemblies of all the provinces.

In 1999, it was revealed that the federal government was again toying with the idea of changing Canada to a republic. When this information was leaked to the media and public, there was strong negative reaction, and even denial by the Prime Minister. A survey of the provincial premiers at the time showed only one in favour of such a move.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/loyalty.htm Premiers Nix Monarchy Abolition: "NOT A GOVERNMENT PROJECT AT THIS POINT"]</ref>

==The Crown and the First Nations==
[[Image:HM-tablet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Her Majesty the Queen of Canada presents a tablet of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] granite with the ciphers of both herself and her great-great-[[Grandparent|grandmother]] Queen Victoria, at the [[First Nations University of Canada]], [[May 17]], [[2005]].]]

As with the [[Māori]] and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in [[New Zealand]], Canada's [[First Nations]] view their treaties as being agreements directly between them and the Crown, not with the ever-changing government of Canada. The ''[[Royal Proclamation of 1763]]'' made clear that the First Nations were autonomous political units and affirmed their title to lands. It remains an important document, mentioned in the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', outlining the Canadian Crown's responsibility to protect First Nations' territories and maintain the bilateral "nation-to-nation" relationship.<ref>[http://www.ualberta.ca/~nativest/pim/waitangi.htm A Historical Analysis of Early Nation to Nation Relations in Canada and New Zealand:The Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Treaty of Niagra and The Treaty of Waitangi]</ref><ref>[http://www.treaty6.ca/princ.html Fundamental Treaty Principals]</ref>

An early example of the Crown's protection of First Nations people was during the [[American Revolution]]. As a consequence of the [[Mohawk Nation]]'s alliance with the British, through being a part of the [[Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy]], the Mohawk peoples were forced from their lands in the [[Mohawk Valley]], in present day [[New York State]], by the revolutionaries. As compensation, the British Crown promised land in Canada to those displaced by the war. In 1784 some Mohawks settled in what is now the [[Bay of Quinte]] and the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River valley]] where North America's only two Royal chapels, [[Christ Church Royal Chapel|Christ Church Royal Chapel of the Mohawks]] and [[Mohawk Chapel|Her Majesty's Chapel of the Mohawks]] in [[Brantford]], were built to symbolize the connection between the Mohawk peoples and the Crown.

Treaty No. 7 was signed by the [[Blackfoot]], [[Kainai Nation|Blood]], [[Northern Peigan|Peigan]], [[Tsuu T'ina Nation|Sarcee]] and Stony Indian tribes in 1877, ceding the praries of Southern [[Alberta]] to what was then the British Crown. In 1977, Prince Charles visited Alberta to attend celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the treaty signing.    During a subsequent visit by his mother in 1994, a modern demonstration of the relationship between the First Nations and the Crown was seen when the [[Dene]] community of the [[Northwest Territories]] presented a list of grievances over stalled land claim negotiations to Queen Elizabeth II, rather than to [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]], while the two were attending an Aboriginal Cultural Festival in [[Yellowknife, Northwest Territories]]. After speaking with the Chief, the Queen handed the list to the Prime Minister for the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] to address.

There have also been more symbolic gestures to demonstrate the "nation-to-nation" relationship.  For intance, to commemorate a diplomatic visit to [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] by the "[[Four Mohawk Kings]]", or the three Mohawk and one Mahicanin Chiefs of the Iroquoian Confederacy, in 1710, the [[Four Mohawk Kings|portraits of the "Four Indian Kings"]] were painted by Jan Verelst. After they hung in [[Kensington Palace]] for almost 270 years, Queen Elizabeth II donated them to the Canadian Collection at the [[Library and Archives Canada|National Archives of Canada]], unveiling them in Ottawa in 1977.  Further, a set of silver chaices was given to the [[Christ Church Royal Chapel|Christ Church Royal Chapel of the Mohawks]] by Queen Anne in 1712, to embody the relationship between the Crown and Mohawk people.<ref>[http://www.tyendinaga.net/history/ Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory]</ref>  One was lost during the American Revolution, however, in 1984, as a bicentennial gift, Queen Elizabeth II gave a new silver chalice as a replacement.  Also, in 1976, during a visit to the Eastern Arctic in northern Canada, the [[Inuit]] gave Prince Charles a distinctive title, calling him ''Attaniout Ikeneego'', meaning "The Son of the Big Boss."<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/kids-zone-answers.htm Are You an "Ace" at Kings and Queens?: A children's quiz on monarchy in Canada]</ref> Ten years later, [[Cree]] and [[Ojibwa]]y students in Winnipeg named Prince Charles "Leading Star."<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/redbox/royalinvolvement.doc Royal Involvement With Canadian Life]</ref>

In May 2005, the Queen, during a visit to the [[First Nations University of Canada]] in [[Saskatchewan]], presented a piece of [[Balmoral]] granite engraved with the ciphers of [[Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and herself. The gesture behind the gift was outlined in the Queen's words:

:"This stone was taken from the grounds of [[Balmoral Castle]] in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] of [[Scotland]] — a place dear to my great-great-grandmother, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. It symbolises the foundation of the rights of First Nations peoples reflected in treaties signed with the Crown during her reign.
:"Bearing the cipher of Queen Victoria as well as my own, this stone is presented to the First Nations University of Canada in the hope that it will serve as a reminder of the special relationship between the Sovereign and all First Nations peoples." <ref>[http://edmonton.cbc.ca/regional/servlet/View?filename=ed-first-nations-queen20050511 CBC: First Nations say they're left out of royal visit]</ref>

Nevertheless, First Nations groups complained that their role during the Queen's visit was a purely symbolic one, and were disappointed that neither the provincial nor federal governments granted them a private audience with the Queen to express concerns about treaty violations.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20050511%2FNATIVES11%2FTPNational%2FCanada&ord=1169237438207&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true Monchuk, Judy; ''The Globe and Mail'': Natives decry 'token' presence for Queen's visit; May 11, 2005]</ref>

==The Crown and the Canadian Forces==
[[Image:Wessex-dop2b.jpg|thumb|left|225px|HRH [[Sophie, The Countess of Wessex]], speaks with soldiers of [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]] as their [[Colonel-in-Chief]], June, 2005]]
The Crown retains a prominent place within the [[Canadian Forces]]. The [[Constitution Act, 1867]] states that the [[Commander-in-Chief of Canadian Forces|Command-in-Chief of the Canadian Armed Forces]] is vested in the Queen. However, the 1905 ''Militia Act'' changed references to the Office of the Governor-General to become the Office of the Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of the Militia; the title and its duties being held and performed by the Governor General on behalf of the Sovereign. The [[Letters Patent]] of 1947 further reinforce this position. <ref>[http://www.gg.ca/gg/rr/cc/hist_e.asp Governor General of Canada: Commander in Chief of the Canadian Forces]</ref> The Queen is also the Honorary Commissioner of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].<ref>[http://www.regiments.org/biography/royals/1926eliz.htm Land Forces: H.M. Elizabeth II Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]</ref>

In 1968, Defence Minister [[Paul Hellyer]], under the Government of [[Pierre Trudeau]], unified the [[Canadian Army]], [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] into the [[Canadian Armed Forces]], over the protests of many senior generals, admirals and air marshals. The "Royal" title was not bestowed upon the new unified service, though many of the former Army units retain the title and vessels are still titled "HMCS". Also, crowns are included in the vast majority of Canadian military insignia.  Since usage of the "Royal" designation was executed by Royal Proclamations which have never been revoked, the Canadian Government and the Canadian Forces will be required to resume usage of the expression "Royal" if the expressions "Canadian Navy" and "Canadian Air Force" are again used in any official capacity.

Still, dspite the unification, the Sovereign's position and role in the military is reflected by Canadian [[navy|naval vessels]] bearing the prefix [[Her Majesty's Canadian Ship]] (HMCS) (subsequently His Majesty's Canadian Ship during the reign of a king), and all members of the armed forces must swear allegiance to the Queen and her heirs and successors.  Members of the Royal Family are also [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of many Canadian regiments, including: le Régiment de la Chaudière; the [[48th Highlanders of Canada]]; le [[Royal 22e Régiment]]; the [[Governor General's Foot Guards]]; [[the Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa]]; [[the Royal Newfoundland Regiment]]; and the [[Calgary Highlanders]], amongst many others.
:''Further information: [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage#Military|List of Canadian Organizations with royal patronage — Military]]''

Members of the Canadian Royal Family have presided over many military ceremonies both abroad and at home, including [[Trooping the Colour]]s, inspections of the troops, and anniversaries of key battles; whenever the Sovereign or a member of her family is in Ottawa, they lay a wreath at the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]]. As well, two other examples of Elizabeth II acting as [[Queen]] of Canada abroad were associated with the Canadian military; one in 1996 when she dedicated the Canadian War Memorial in [[Green Park]], [[London]], and the other in 2004 when she attended the Canadian 60th anniversary of [[D-Day]] ceremonies in [[Normandy]], [[France]].  One of the few official duties King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] carried out during his short reign as King of Canada was to dedicate the [[Vimy Memorial]] in France, on July 26, [[1936]].<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/royalvisit/prince-quiz-answers.htm Department of Canadian Heritage: Getting to know the Prince of Wales]</ref>

==Canadian Royal Family==
[[Image:Roy-fam-canada.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The Canadian Royal Family gathers in [[Lac-Brome, Quebec]], 1976 (left to right: the [[Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] (now [[Princess Royal]]), [[Mark Phillips]], [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]] (now [[Earl of Wessex]]), the Queen, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] (now [[Duke of York]]) and the [[Prince of Wales]])]]
{{dablink|The Canadian Royal Family is a shared royal family.  This article describes the Royal Family from the perspective of [[Canada]]. In some other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, the concept, function and position of the royal family is similar, but the historical and cultural significance may differ. For information on the Royal Family in the other Realms, see [[Monarchy in Canada#See also|Other Realms]].}}

The '''Canadian Royal Family''' is a group of people closely related to the Canadian Monarch; it is a non-resident royal family, those who comprise the group live in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Canadian federal government maintains an official list of Royal Family members.<ref name="Copps">[http://www.torontosun.com/News/Columnists/Copps_Sheila/2006/04/26/1550711.html Copps, Sheila; ''Toronto Sun: PM should ignore flag bureaucrats'']; [[April 26]], [[2006]]</ref> Those on the list carry the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] [[Majesty|His or Her Majesty (HM)]], [[His Royal Highness|His or Her Royal Highness (HRH)]], or sometimes [[The Right Honourable]].

Members of the Royal Family in the direct line of succession owe allegiance to the Sovereign in right of Canada. As such, according to the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]], they are subjects of the Canadian Sovereign, although not strictly Canadian citizens, and thus, though they do not have an automatic right of abode in Canada, they are entitled to Canadian consular assistance and to the protection of the Queen's [[Canadian forces|Armed Forces of Canada]] when they are outside of the [[Commonwealth Realms]], and in need of protection or assistance.<ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces; pg 281]</ref><ref>Noonan, Peter C., ''The Crown and Constitutional Law in Canada'', Sripnoon Publications, Calgary, 1998</ref>

The current Canadian Royal Family are members of the [[House of Windsor]]. Though the [[The Crown#Other Commonwealth Realms|Canadian Crown]] is recognized as legally separate from the [[The Crown#United Kingdom|UK Crown]], the two countries (along with the fourteen other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s) are in a [[personal union]] relationship, meaning they share the same Monarchy. Thus, all the members of the Canadian Royal Family also comprise the [[British Royal Family]].

Canada could potentially break from the symmetrical relationship with the other Realms, giving it a different Royal Family to that of the other countries. However, this would contravene the important convention laid out in the preamble to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] (a part of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian Constitution]]).

In a speech given at the opening of the [[Nunavut]] legislature in October 2002, the Queen stated: "I am proud to be the first member of the Canadian Royal Family to be greeted in Canada's newest territory."<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4178.asp Text of The Queen's address to the Legislative Assembly in Nunavut, Canada, 4 October 2002]</ref>

Apart from Canada, the Queen and other members of the Royal Family regularly perform public duties in the other fifteen nations of the Commonwealth in which the Queen is Head of State (see, for example, [[List of Commonwealth visits made by Queen Elizabeth II]]).  As the Crown within these countries is a legally separate entity from the Canadian Crown, it is funded in these countries individually, through the ordinary legislative budgeting process.

[[Camilla, The Duchess of Cornwall]], wife of the Prince of Wales, is of Canadian descent, being the great-great-granddaughter of Sophia Mary MacNab and [[William Keppel, 7th Earl of Albemarle|William Coutts Keppel]] of [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Sophia was the descendant of immigrants to [[Quebec]] in the 17th century and the daughter of Sir [[Allan MacNab]], Premier of the [[Province of Canada]]. The couple's son (and Camilla's great-grandfather), George Keppel, married [[Alice Keppel|Alice Edmonstone]], who would later become the mistress of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] (great-great-grandfather of Prince Charles). This same lineage makes Camilla a distant relation of Canadian singer [[Celine Dion]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref>{{lang|fr|[http://www.perche-quebec.com/files/loiseauHTML/menu/frame_accueil_en.htm Leurs histoires commencent dans le Perche…]}} ([[French language|French]])</ref>

The official website of the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] "Canadian Monarchy" section provides a [http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/fr-rf/_00_e.cfm list] of Royal Family members.

The list has not been updated to take account of the deaths of [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]] (2004) and [[Angus Ogilvy]] (2004); or the marriage of the Prince of Wales to Camilla Parker-Bowles (2005) nor does it include the grandchildren of the Queen.

After the divorce of the Prince of Wales from [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], in 1996, the Princess's name was removed from the official list of Royal Family honourees.<ref name="Copps" />

===Titles===
In Canada, only the Sovereign has a title established through law.  Other members of the Royal Family are accorded a [[courtesy title]], usually the title they have been granted in the United Kingdom.

===Awards to the Royal Family===
The reigning monarch of Canada is the Sovereign of the [[Order of Canada]], Sovereign of the [[Order of Military Merit (Canada)|Order of Military Merit]], Sovereign of the [[Order of Merit of the Police Forces]], Sovereign of the [[Royal Victorian Order]], and Sovereign of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Order of St. John]].

Aside from awards which are personal gifts of the Sovereign, other members of the Royal Family are commonly awarded [[Canadian honours system|Canadian honours]], either substantively or on an honorary basis: hence, Her Majesty the [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Mother]], for example, was an honorary recipient of the [[Order of Canada]]. The [[Canadian Forces Decoration]] awarded to her, however, was not honorary. Her Canadian honours were excluded from mention at her funeral in the UK, but were recognized at the commemoration service held in Ottawa.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/celebrations.htm Queen Mother appointed to Order of Canada]</ref><ref>[http://pch.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&DocIDCd=2N0018 Commemoration Service for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,C.C.]</ref>

Both Prince Charles and the Earl of Wessex have been awarded the [[Saskatchewan Order of Merit]].<ref>[http://www.gov.sk.ca/newsrel/releases/2005/05/11-417.html Prince Edward awarded Saskatchewan Order of Merit]</ref>

==Organizations with royal association==
===Organizations under Royal Charter===
[[image:hudsonsbayco.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Hudson's Bay Company]], building in [[Montreal]]]]
In the [[Commonwealth Realms]] a [[Royal Charter]] is a [[charter]] granted by the [[Monarch]] on the advice of the Privy Council (or Executive Council), which creates or gives special status to an incorporated body. This is an exercise of the Royal Prerogative, and, in Canada, there are hundreds of organizations under Royal Charters. Such organisations include charities, businesses, colleges, universities, and cities.

Today, it is mostly charities and professional institutions who receive Royal Charters.

Application for a charter is a petition to the Queen in Council. To receive a Royal Charter, the organization must have corporate members who have at least first degree level in a relevant field, consist of 5,000 members or more, be financially sound, and it must be in the public interest to regulate the institution under a charter. However, meeting these benchmarks does not guarantee the issue of a Royal Charter.

==== Companies ====
Canada's oldest company, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], was founded under a Royal Charter issued by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1670.  By that charter, to this day the Company is required to give two [[Elk (Cervus canadensis)|elk]] skins and two black [[beaver]] pelts to the Sovereign or his or her heirs and successors when they visit the area originally called [[Rupert's Land]].<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/royal-quiz-answers.htm Department of Canadian Heritage: Test your royal skills]</ref>

==== Cities ====
Cities under Royal Charter are not subject to municipal Acts of parliament applied generally to other municipalities, and instead are governed by legislation applicable to each city individually. The Royal Charter codifies the laws applied to the particular city, and lays out the powers and responsibilities not given to other municipalities in the province concerned.

Canada has four Royal Charter cities: [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], (the oldest, having received its charter in 1786 from [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]), [[Vancouver]], [[Winnipeg]], and [[Montreal]]. <ref>[http://www.canadascities.ca/caoreport_062000_1.htm#3 ''Canada's Cities: Unleash our Potential'']</ref>

==== Universities and colleges ====
[[Image:UCC-duke.jpg|thumb|200px|The Queen's consort [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] speaks with UCC First Football team members at the [[Upper Canada College]]'s 150th anniversary celebrations, 1979]]

A number of Canadian universities and colleges were founded under Royal Charter.

From [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]:
* 1802: King's College in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]] — now [[University of King's College]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]
From [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]:
* 1821: [[McGill University]]
* 1827: King's College — superseded by the [[University of Toronto]]
* 1829: [[Upper Canada College]]
From [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]:
* 1841: [[Queen's University]]
* 1852: [[Université Laval]]

===Canadian Organizations with Royal Patronage===
Until [[Industrial Revolution|modern industrial]] times, all development of the [[Science]]s and the [[Art]]s were under the direct control of the [[Monarch]].

This initial control was exercised by the foundation of the [[college]]s that today form the basis of modern [[Universities]]. The endowments to provide for these colleges were once provided by [[the Crown]] to further education in both ecclesiastical and [[secularism|secular]] matters.

As time progressed, the educated members of these organisations formed into groups to lecture, demonstrate and [[debate]] their various subjects. These groups either sought Royal Patronage or were created as [[memorial]]s for the predecessors of the reigning monarch. Other colleges and foundations have been endowed by the owners of the great [[Estate (law)|landed estates]] and, in later times, by industrialists and finally modern [[corporation|corporate bodies]]. However, even in present times, relatively new organisations still seek Royal Patronage.

To receive Royal Patronage, an organisation must prove to be long lasting, and to be of the highest standard in their field. These organisations (for example, the [[Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning]], the Royal Canadian Humane Association, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, and the Royal Niagara Military Institute) receive, and have received patronage from various monarchs and their families.  
{{see|List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage}}

==Awards and charities==
A number of awards in Canada are issued in the name of previous or present members of the Royal Family. These include:

* The ''[[Queen Elizabeth II Scholarship]]'' for Ontario high school graduates
* The ''[http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/services/awards.html#prince Prince of Wales Prize]'', awarded by [[Heritage Canada]] to a municipality that has shown exemplary commitment to heritage preservation

Charities and volunteer organizations have also been founded as gifts to, or in honour of some of Canada's monarchs, or members of the Royal Family.  These include:
* The [[Victorian Order of Nurses]] was a gift to Queen Victoria for her [[Diamond Jubilee#Diamond Jubilee for Queen Victoria|Diamond Jubilee]] in 1897
* The Canadian Cancer Fund was set up in honour of King George V's [[Silver Jubilee#Silver Jubilees in the United Kingdom|Silver Jubilee]] in 1935
* The Queen Elizabeth II Fund to Aid in Research on the Diseases of Children
* The Queen Elizabeth II Trust Fund to assist young Canadians in better understanding each other's language and culture was established during Queen Elizabeth's Silber Jubilee in 1977

To date, there has been little national debate about ending the Monarchy in Canada, in contrast to some other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s where the issue has gained a relatively higher profile.  Many Canadians continue to be unaware that the Queen serves as their Head of State; a 2002 [[EKOS Research Associates|EKOS]] poll found that only five percent of Canadians could correctly identify Elizabeth II as Canada's Head of State (the majority believing it to be the Prime Minister).<ref>[http://www.ekos.com/admin/articles/31may2001.pdf Eskos poll]</ref>

Where debate does exist, it tends to be a largely academic one, and several books have been authored that explore the subject from a [[political science]] perspective. Neither of Canada's two main political parties, the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] or the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], are officially in favour of abolishing the Monarchy; though the latter makes support for constitutional monarchy a founding principle in its Policy Declaration.<ref>[http://www.conservative-own.ca/documents/policy031905.pdf#search='conservative%20party%20of%20canada%20objectives%20monarchy' Conservative Party of Canada Policy Declaration]</ref> The [[New Democratic Party]] has officially stated it is willing to "explore" the issue, but in practice the party is not actively pro-republic and largely supports the status quo. Unlike other Commonwealth Realms, Canada has never had a head of government who has been openly republican.  Some politicians, having pledged allegiance to the Queen, have occasionally publicly voiced their opinion on the matter, following former-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Manley (politician)|John Manley]]'s 2002 statement that he was in favour of abolishing the monarchy - later stating that it was his personal opinion.

Canada has two special-interest groups representing both sides of the debate, who frequently argue the issue in the media: [[Monarchist League of Canada]] and the [[Citizens for a Canadian Republic]].
