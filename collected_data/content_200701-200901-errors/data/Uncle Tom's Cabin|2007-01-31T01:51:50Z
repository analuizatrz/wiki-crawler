'''''Uncle Tom's Cabin[http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=203]; or, Life Among the Lowly''''' is a [[novel]] by [[United States|American]] author [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] which treats [[African Americans]] as a central theme.  The novel is believed to have had a profound effect on the [[Northeastern United States|North]]'s view of African-Americans.

Stowe was a [[Connecticut]]-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active [[abolitionist]]. She first published this book on [[March 20]], [[1852]].  The story focuses on the tale of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave, the central character around whose life the other characters&mdash;both fellow slaves and slave owners&mdash;revolve. The novel depicts the harsh reality of [[slavery]] while also showing that [[Christianity|Christian]] love and faith can overcome even something as evil as enslavement of fellow human beings.

''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was the best-selling novel of the 19th century (and the second best-selling book of the century after the Bible)<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-uncletomscabin/intro.html Introduction to Uncle Tom's Cabin Study Guide], accessed May 16, 2006.</ref> and is credited with helping to fuel the [[abolitionist]] cause in the 1850s. In the first year after it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold.

The book's impact was so great that when [[Abraham Lincoln]] met Stowe at the start of the [[American Civil War]], Lincoln is often quoted as having declared, "So this is the little lady who made this big war."<ref>Charles Edward Stowe, ''Harriet Beecher Stowe: The Story of Her Life'' (1911) p. 203.</ref>

The book also created and spread several common stereotypes about [[blacks]], many of which endure to this day. These include the affectionate, dark-skinned [[mammy archetype|mammy]]; the [[Pickaninny]] stereotype of black children; and the [[Uncle Tom]], or dutiful, long-suffering servant faithful to his white master or mistress. In recent years, the negative associations with ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' have to a large degree overshadowed the historical impact of the book. 

[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[General]] and [[politician]] [[James Baird Weaver]] said that the book convinced him to become active in the [[abolitionist]] movement.

Uncle Tom's Cabin is available to read on the internet at Project Gutenberg [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=203] It can also be downloaded as an audio book from Librivox. [http://librivox.org/uncle-toms-cabin-by-harriet-beecher-stowe/]

==Origins==
Stowe wrote the novel as a happily noted response to the 1850 passage of the second [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], which punished those who aided runaway blacks and diminished the rights of fugitives as well as freed blacks.

Some historians believe that Stowe was inspired by the autobiography of [[Josiah Henson]], an African-American who lived and worked on a 3,700 acre tobacco plantation in [[Maryland]] owned by Isaac Riley.<ref>[http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-01/2006-01-13-voa58.cfm?CFID=18191928&CFTOKEN=51628745 "Historic Uncle Tom's Cabin Saved"] by Susan Logue, VOA News, January 12, 2006. Accessed May 16, 2006.</ref> Henson was one of the first escaped slaves in the United States to write a memoir and Harriet Beecher Stowe evidently acknowledged that Henson's writings inspired ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''. When Stowe's book became famous, Henson republished his memoirs as ''The Memoirs of Uncle Tom'' and traveled extensively in America and Europe.<ref>[http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-01/2006-01-13-voa58.cfm?CFID=18191928&CFTOKEN=51628745 "Historic Uncle Tom's Cabin Saved"] by Susan Logue, VOA News, January 12, 2006. Accessed May 16, 2006.</ref>

''American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses'', a volume co-authored by [[Theodore Dwight Weld]] and the [[Grimké sisters]], is also identified as a source of some of the material.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/65/we/Weld-The.html The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001-05]</ref>

Prior to the Civil War, Harriet Beecher Stowe and her husband; with the help of some neighbors, made their home in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state. In Cincinnati the [[Underground Railroad]] had local abolitionist sympathizers and was active in efforts to help runaway slaves on their escape route from the South. Stowe amassed a large quantity of research from oral and written sources, which she incorporated as story material for the novel. She only made brief visits to Kentucky towns and was never on a slave farm.

== Publication ==

''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was first published as a 40-week serial, ''Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly'' published in the ''[[National Era]]'', an [[abolitionist]] periodical, starting in the [[5 June]] [[1851]] issue.  It was published in book form on [[March 20]], [[1852]].

In the first year after the book was published, 300,000 copies of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' were sold. The book eventually became the bestselling novel in the world during the 19th century (and the second best-selling book after the Bible), with the book being translated into every major language.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-uncletomscabin/intro.html Introduction to Uncle Tom's Cabin Study Guide], accessed May 16, 2006.</ref> A number of the early editions carried an introduction by [[James Sherman (minister)|Rev James Sherman]], a Congregational minister in [[London]] noted for his abolitionist views.

Because the [[copyright]] laws of the time did not place any limits on stage dramatizations of fictional works, stage dramatizations, soon known as "Tom shows", began to appear during the period while Stowe's original work was still being published serially.

== World Reaction ==

According to Stowe's son, when Lincoln met her in 1862 he commented, "So this is the little lady who started this big war."<ref>Charles Edward Stowe, ''Harriet Beecher Stowe: The Story of Her Life'' (1911) p. 203.</ref> Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made.<ref>''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', introduction by Amanda Claybaugh, Barnes and Noble Classics, New York, 2003, page xvii.</ref> Since then, many writers have credited this novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of blacks and the [[Fugitive Slave Law]].<ref>''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', introduction by Amanda Claybaugh, Barnes and Noble Classics, New York, 2003, page xvii.</ref>

However, ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' excited greater interest in England than in America itself. The first London edition appeared in May, 1852, and sold over one million copies, far more than in the U.S. Much of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, "The evil passions which 'Uncle Tom' gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance [of slavery], but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America--we are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system--our Tories hate her democrats--our [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] hate her [[parvenu]]s--our Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy." <ref>Nassau Senior, quoted in Ephraim Douglass Adams, ''Great Britain and the American Civil War'' (1958) p: 33. </ref>  [[Charles Francis Adams]], the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that, "Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed."<ref> Charles Francis Adams, ''Trans-Atlantic Historical Solidarity: Lectures Delivered before the University of Oxford in Easter and Trinity Terms, 1913.'' 1913. p. 79</ref>

''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' is credited with aiding anti-segregation efforts around the world. For example, [[Alamayahu Tana]] translated the novel into [[Amharic language|Amharic]] around 1930, in support of [[Ethiopia]]n efforts to end the lives of all blacks in that nation.<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''Economic History of Ethiopia'' (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University Press, 1968), p. 122.</ref>

This book is also the first American novel translated into Chinese, by translator [[Lin Shu]].

==Plot summary==
[[Image:legree.png|Simon Legree and Uncle Tom|right|frame|Simon Legree assaulting Uncle Tom.]]
{{spoiler}}

===Tom owned by George Shelby===

The book opens with a [[Kentucky]] farmer named [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Arthur Shelby|Arthur Shelby]] who is about to lose his farm because of massive debts. Even though he and his wife ([[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Emily Shelby|Emily Shelby]]) believed that they had a benevolent relationship with their slaves, Shelby decided to raise the needed funds by selling two of them &mdash; [[Uncle Tom]], a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby’s maid [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Eliza|Eliza]] &mdash; to a slave trader. Emily Shelby hated the idea of doing this because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#George Shelby|George Shelby]], hated to see Tom go because he considered that loveable old man to be his good friend.

===Eliza and Harry escape===

When Eliza overhears Mr. and Mrs. Shelby discussing the fact that Mr. Shelby has sold Tom and Harry to the slavetrader Haley, Eliza determines to run away in order to save her son.  She is pushed to this decision not by any physical cruelty on the part of her master or mistress, but by the maternal fear of losing her only surviving child (she has already lost two children by miscarriage).  She departs in the night, leaving a note of apology to her mistress.

===Tom is “Sold down the river”===

While all of this is happening, Uncle Tom is sold and taken down the Mississippi River. On the boat, Tom meets and befriends a young white girl named [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Eva|Eva]]. When Eva falls into the river, Tom saves her. In gratitude, Eva's father, [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Augustine St. Clare|Augustine St. Clare]], buys Tom from Haley and takes him with the family to their home in [[New Orleans]]. Tom and Eva come to relate to one another in a very special way, sharing a deep Christian faith between them.

===George, Eliza and Harry escape===

As Eliza and her husband George Harris, who ran away previously, attempt to reach Canada, they are cornered by Loker and his men, causing George to shoot Loker. Worried that Loker may die, Eliza convinces George and the Quakers to bring the slave hunter to a nearby Quaker settlement for medical treatment.

===Tom owned by Augustine St. Clare===

Back in New Orleans, St. Clare debates slavery with his cousin Ophelia who, while opposing slavery, is deeply prejudiced against black people. St. Clare, however, is not biased against blacks. In an attempt to show Ophelia that her views on blacks are wrong, St. Clare purchases [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Topsy|Topsy]], a young black slave. St. Clare then asks Ophelia to educate Topsy.

After Tom has lived with the St. Clares for two years, Eva grows very ill. Before she dies she experiences a vision of heaven, which she shares with the people around her. As a result of her death and vision, the other characters resolve to change their lives, with Ophelia promising to love her slaves more, Topsy saying she will better herself, and St. Clare pledging to free Uncle Tom.

===Tom sold to Simon Legree===

Before St. Clare can follow through on his pledge, he is fatally stabbed while intervening in a fight. His wife reneges on her late husband's vow and sells Tom at auction to a vicious [[plantation]] owner named [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Simon Legree|Simon Legree]]. Legree (who is not a native southerner but a transplanted [[Yankee]]) takes Tom to rural [[Louisiana]] where Tom meets Legree's other slaves, including Emmeline (whom Legree purchased at the same time). Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom refuses Legree's order to whip his fellow slave. Tom receives a brutal beating, and Legree resolves to crush Tom's faith in [[God]].  But Tom refuses to stop [[reading (activity)|reading]] his [[Bible]] and trying to comfort the other slaves as best he can. While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another of Legree's slaves. Cassy was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold to different owners; unable to endure the pain of seeing another child sold and possibly mistreated, she killed her third child.

At this point Tom Loker returns to the story. Loker has changed as the result of being healed by and living with the Quakers. In addition, George, Eliza, and Harry obtained their freedom after they crossed over into Canada. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is stretched to the limit because of the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions &mdash; one of [[Jesus]] and one of Eva &mdash; which renews his resolve to remain faithful to [[Christ]], even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, the cruel master orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men make commitments to become Christians. George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives with money in hand to buy Tom’s freedom, but is too late.

===Final Section===

On their boat ride to freedom, Cassy and Emmeline meet George Harris’ sister and accompany her to Canada. Once there Cassy discovers that Eliza is her long-lost daughter who was sold as a child. Now that their family is together again, they travel to [[France]] and eventually [[Liberia]], the African nation created for former American slaves. There Cassy's long-lost son will also meet them. George Shelby returns to the Kentucky farm and frees all his slaves. George tells them to remember Tom’s sacrifice and his belief in the true meaning of Christianity.

==Major characters==
===Uncle Tom===

Uncle Tom, the title character, was initially seen as a noble long-suffering Christian. In more recent years his name has become an epithet directed towards certain [[African-Americans]] because he was derided as being a submissive slave. Uncle Tom has come to represent slaves who are utterly subservient to their masters.

===Eliza===
A light-skinned black slave.

===Eva===
Eva, whose real name is Evangeline St. Clare, is the daughter of Augustine St. Clare. Eva enters the narrative when [[Uncle Tom]] is traveling via [[steamship]] to [[New Orleans]] to be sold, and he rescues the 5 or 6 year-old girl from drowning. Eva begs her father to buy Tom, and he becomes the head coachman at the St. Clare [[plantation]]. 

Eva constantly talks about love and forgiveness, even convincing the dour girl Topsy that she is worth loving. Some consider Eva to be a prototype of the later evangelions

Eventually Eva falls ill. Before dying, she gives a lock of her hair to each of her servants, telling them that they must become [[Christianity|Christians]] so that they may see each other in [[Heaven]]. On her deathbed, she convinces her father to free Tom, but because of circumstances the promise never materializes.

===Simon Legree===
A [[villain]]ous and cruel slave owner—a Northerner by birth—whose name has become synonymous with greed.  It is Tom's Christianity which arouses him.

===Topsy===
A "ragamuffin" young slave girl.

==Other characters==
===Arthur Shelby===
Tom's master in Kentucky. Shelby is characterized as a "kind" slaveowner and a stereotypical Southern gentleman.

===Emily Shelby===
Mr. Shelby's wife is a deeply religious woman who strives to be a kind and moral influence upon her slaves. She is appalled when her husband negotiates to sell some slave with a slave trader, especially since she promised Harry's mother, Eliza, that this would not happen.

===George Shelby===


===Augustine St. Clare===
Tom's second owner in Louisiana.  He is the father of Eva.  Upon his death, Tom and the other slaves (except Topsy, who belongs to Miss Ophelia) are put on the auctioneering block by his hypocritical and self-centered wife.

==Criticism and Stereotypes==
* The "happy darky": A lazy, submissive slave, not to be viewed as a threat but of little use.	 
* The affectionate, dark-skinned female. 
* The [[Pickaninny]] stereotype of black children.
* The [[Uncle Tom]], or African American who is eager to please white people.



==Anti-Tom literature==
In response to ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', writers in the [[Southern United States]] began producing numerous books to galvanize opposition to Stowe's novel. 

The two most famous anti-Tom books are ''[[The Sword and the Distaff]]'' by [[William Gilmore Simms]] and ''[[The Planter's Northern Bride]]'' by [[Caroline Lee Hentz]]; the latter author had been a close personal friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published a few months after Stowe's novel and it contains several sections and discussions that clearly dispute Stowe's book and her view of blacks. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely-read at the time, but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen through the eyes of a northern woman &mdash; the daughter of an abolitionist, no less &mdash; who marries a southern slave owner. 

In the decade between the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin and the start of the [[American Civil War]], between twenty and thirty anti-Tom books were published. Among these novels are two books titled ''Uncle Tom's Cabin As It Is'' (one by W.L. Smith and the other by C.H. Wiley) and a book by [[John Pendleton Kennedy]].

Today this anti-Tom literature is generally seen as lacking any credible form of artistic expression.

=="Tom shows"==
[[Image:Stetson's Uncle Tom's Cabin - Eliza.jpg|thumb|1886 poster for "Stetson's ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''"]]

Given the lax copyright laws of the time, stage plays based on ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''&mdash;"Tom shows"&mdash;began to appear while the story itself was still being serialized. These plays varied tremendously in their politics&mdash;some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery. Eric Lott estimates that at least three million people saw these plays, ten times the book's first-year sales. Some of these shows were essentially [[minstrel shows]] loosely based on the novel and their grossly exaggerated caricatures of black people further perpetuated some of the stereotypes that Stowe used.

Stowe herself never authorized dramatization of her work, because of [[puritan]]ical distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]]'s version, and, according to [[Francis Underwood]], was "delighted" by [[Caroline Howard]]'s portrayal of Topsy). Asa Hutchinson of the [[Hutchinson Family Singers]], whose antislavery politics closely matched those of Stowe tried and failed to get her permission to stage an official version; her refusal left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures. 

All "Tom shows" appear to have incorporated elements of [[melodrama]] and of [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. The first serious attempt at anything like a faithful stage adaptation was a one-hour play by C.W. Taylor at Purdy's National Theater ([[New York City]]); it ran for about ten performances in August&ndash;September 1852 sharing a bill with a blackface burlesque featuring   [[T.D. Rice]]. Rice, famous in the 1830s for his comic and clearly [[racism|racist]] blackface character [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]], later became the most celebrated actor to play the title role of Tom; when Rice opened in H.E. Stevens play of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in January 1854 at New York's Bowery Theatre, the ''[[Spirit of the Times]]<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' reviewer described him as "decidedly the best personator of negro character who has appeared in any drama."

The best-known "Tom Shows" were those of [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]] and [[H.J. Conway]]. Aiken's original ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' focused almost entirely on Little Eva (played by child star [[Cordelia Howard]]); a sequel, ''The Death of Uncle Tom, or the Religion of the Lonely'' told Tom's own story. The two were ultimately combined in an unprecedented evening-long six-act play. According to Lott, it is generally faithful to Stowe's novel, although it plays down the black trickster characters of Sam and Andy and variously adds or expands the roles of some farcical white characters instead. It also focuses heavily on George Harris; the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that his defiant speech received "great cheers" from an audience of Bowery [[b'hoy and g'hal|b'hoys and g'hals]]. Even this most sympathetic of "Tom shows" clearly borrowed heavily from minstrelsy: not only were the slave roles all played by white actors in blackface, but [[Stephen Foster]]'s "[[Old Folks at Home]]" was played in the scene where Tom is sold down the river. After a long and successful run beginning [[November 15]], 1852 in [[Troy, New York]], the play opened in New York City [[July 18]], 1853, where its success was even greater.

Conway's production opened in [[Boston]] the same day Aiken's opened in Troy; [[P.T. Barnum]] brought it to his American Museum in New York [[November 7]], 1853. Its politics were much more moderate. Sam and Andy become, in Lott's words, "buffoons". Criticism of slavery was placed largely in the mouth of a newly introduced [[Yankee]] character, a reporter named Penetrate Partyside. St. Clare's role was expanded, and turned into more of a pro-slavery advocate, articulating the politics of a [[John C. Calhoun]]. Legree rigs the auction that gets him ownership of Tom (as against Stowe's and Aiken's portrayal of oppression as the ''normal'' mode of slavery, not an abuse of the system by a cheater). Beyond this, Conway gave his play a happy ending, with Tom and various other slaves freed.

Showmen felt that Stowe's novel had a flaw in that there was no clearly defined comic character, so there was no role for a comedian, and consequently little relief from the tragedy. Eventually it was found that the minor character of Marks the Lawyer could be played as a broad charicature for laughs, dresing him in foppish clothes, often equipped with an incoungruously dainty umberella. Some productions even had him make an entrance mounted astride a large pig!

Among the pro-slavery "Tom shows" was ''Uncle Tom's Cabin as It Is: The Southern Uncle Tom'', produced in 1852 at the [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] Museum. Lott mentions numerous "offshoots, parodies, thefts, and rebuttals" including a full-scale play by [[Christy's Minstrels]] and a parody by Conway himself called ''Uncle Pat's Cabin'', and records that the story in its many variants "dominated northern popular culture… for several years".

According to Eric Lott, even those "Tom shows" which stayed relatively close to Stowe's novel played down the [[feminism|feminist]] aspects of the book and Stowe's criticisms of capitalism, and turned her anti-slavery politics into anti-Southern sectionalism. Francis Underwood, a contemporary, wrote that Aiken's play had also lost the "lightness and gayety" of Stowe's book. Nonetheless, Lott argues, they increased sympathy for the slaves among the Northern white working class (which had been somewhat alienated from the abolitionist movement by its perceived elitist backing).

The influence of the "Tom shows" could also be found in a number of other plays through the 1850s: most obviously, C.W. Taylor's dramatization of Stowe's ''Dred'', but also J.T. Trowbridge's abolitionist play ''Neighbor Jackwood'', Dion Bouicault's ''The Octaroon'', and a play called ''The Insurrection'', based on [[John Brown (abolitionist)#Raid on Harpers Ferry|John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]].

==Cinematic versions==
[[Image:Babbuncletomscabin.jpg|right|thumb|A movie poster from [[Kroger Babb]]'s 1965 production of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''.]]''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' has been made into several film versions.

*The earliest was in 1903, directed by [[Siegmund Lubin]] and starring Lubin as [[Simon Legree]]. Another version, also released in 1903, was a 13-minute short directed by [[Edwin S. Porter]].
*In 1910, a version was directed by [[Barry O'Neil]] and starring [[Frank Hall Crane]] as [[Uncle Tom]], [[Anna Rosemond]] as [[Eliza (character)|Eliza]], [[Marie Eline]] as [[Little Eva (character)|Little Eva]] and [[Grace Eline]] as Topsy.
*Another version in 1910 was directed by [[J. Stuart Blackton]] and adapted by [[Eugene Mullin]]. It starred [[Florence Turner]], [[Mary Fuller]], [[Edwin R. Phillips]], [[Flora Finch]], [[Genevieve Tobin]] and [[Carlyle Blackwell Sr.]]
*A 1913 release was directed by [[Otis Turner]] and adapted by [[Allan Dwan]]. It starred [[Edward Alexander]], [[Margarita Fischer]], [[Harry A. Pollard]], [[Iva Shepard]] and [[Gertrude Short]].
*Another 1913 release was directed by [[Sidney Olcott]] and starred [[Anna Q. Nilsson]].
*A 1914 version was directed by [[William Robert Daly]]. It was adapted [[Edward McWade]] from the play adaptation by [[George L. Aiken]]. It starred [[Sam Lucas]], [[Teresa Michelena]], Marie Eline (again), [[Royce D. Applegate|Roy Applegate]] and [[Boots Wall]].
*A 1918 version was directed  and adapted by [[J. Searle Dawley]]. It starred [[Marguerite Clark]] (as both Little Eva '''''and''''' Topsy), [[Sam Hardy]], [[Florence Carpenter]], [[Frank Losee]] and [[Walter P. Lewis]].
*A 1927 version was directed by [[Harry A. Pollard]] and adapted by Pollard, [[Harvey F. Thew]] and [[A.P. Younger]], with titles by [[Walter Anthony]]. It starred [[James B. Lowe]], [[Virginia Grey]], [[George Siegmann]], Margarita Fischer (again), [[Mona Ray]] and [[Madame Sul-Te-Wan]].
The subject matter of the [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] novel was judged too sensitive for further film interpretation for several years. A [[German language]] version, directed by [[Géza von Radványi]], appeared in 1965 and was presented in the United States by [[exploitation film]] presenter [[Kroger Babb]], but there was no other film version until a [[television]] broadcast in 1987. That version was directed by [[Stan Lathan]] and adapted by [[John Gay (screenwriter)|John Gay]]. It starred [[Avery Brooks]], [[Phylicia Rashad]], [[Edward Woodward]], [[Jenny Lewis]] and [[Endyia Kinney]].

Characters from the novel were used in a 1919 [[Mack Sennett]] comedy directed by [[Edward F. Cline]] and [[Ray Hunt]], with [[Ben Turpin]] as Uncle Tom and [[Marie Prevost]] as Eliza.

The [[Walt Disney]] cartoon "[[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]" (1933) features the classic Disney character roster playing a theatrical version of the novel.

A highlight of the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951) is a ballet, "Small House of Uncle Thomas", in traditional Siamese style which has been organized by Tuptim, on the subversive theme of Eliza's escape.

In ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002), [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]'s characters attend an imagined wartime adaptation of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' with a [[deus ex machina]] ending. An actor portraying Abraham Lincoln is suspended in mid-air as he speaks consolingly to the [[blackface]] actors portraying Stowe's characters. The [[Nativism|nativist]] audience members respond by shouting racist epithets, throwing objects at "Lincoln," and rioting to calls of "Down with the Union!"

In the [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon "[[Southern Fried Rabbit]]" (1953) Bugs disguises himself as Uncle Tom singing "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]" in order to cross the [[Mason-Dixon line]].

Stowe also offered a solution to a moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Were the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.

Argues Stowe used biological essentialism to explain the character of African Americans and as a basis for her critique of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.

Fulltext online at JSTOR. Stowe sought to redefine masculinity as a necessary step toward the abolition of slavery. Many abolitionists had begun to resist the vision of aggressive and dominant men that the conquest and colonization of the early 19th century had fostered. In order to change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self-image or their standing in society, some abolitionists drew on principles of women's suffrage and Christianity as well as passivism, and praised men for cooperation, compassion, and civic spirit. Others within the abolitionist movement argued for conventional, aggressive masculine action. All the men in Stowe's novel are representations of either one kind of man or the other.
