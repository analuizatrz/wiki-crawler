The '''Sikh diaspora''' is a relatively recent<!--I suggest rephrasing, as "recent" means little--> term used to describe the phenomenon of [[Sikh]] migration from the traditional Sikh heartland of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]].  The starting point of the diaspora is commonly accepted to have begun after the fall of the [[Sikh Empire]] in 1849 and the Empire's subsequent annexation into the [[British Raj]].  The most famous personification of the Sikh diaspora was the first, [[Duleep Singh|Maharajah Duleep Singh]], the last 'King' of the Sikhs who was coerced into a lifetime exile by the [[British Raj]].  Since [[Duleep Singh]]'s exile, the rate of Sikh migration from the Punjab has remained high; however the destination for Sikh migrants has changed during the ensuing 150 years.  The development of the Sikh diaspora concept has given diaspora Sikhs a conscious political and cultural identity, which forms a reference point for their 'Sikhism'.  This phenomena has seen a corresponding development in scientific research literature that explores Sikh diaspora issues.    

==The Sikhs==

Numbering approximately 23 million worldwide, the Sikhs are adherents to the fifth largest organized religion in the world, Sikhism.  The Sikhs make up 0.39%<ref>CIA Factbook [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html]</ref> of the world population of which approximately 83% live in India. Of the Indian Sikh community 14.6 million, i.e. 76% of all Indian Sikhs, live in the northern Indian State of [[Punjab (India)]], where they form a majority 59.9% of the population. Substantial communities of Sikhs, i.e. greater than 200,000, live in the Indian States/Union territories of [[Haryana]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Delhi]], [[Himachal Pradesh]],[[Maharashtra]], [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir]]<ref>Break down of Indian Sikh population by Indian States/Union territories [http://www.censusindia.net/religiondata/Summary%20Sikhs.pdf]</ref>.

==Historical migration patterns==

The Sikhs as a political entity, distinct from other Indian traditions, can be said to of have begun with the martyrdom of the fifth Sikh Guru, [[Arjan Dev|Guru Arjan Dev Ji]] in 1606, Sikh distinction was further enhanced by the establishment of the Sikh 'Pure' brotherhood or [[Khalsa]] (ਖਲਸਾ), by [[Gobind Singh|Guru Gobind Singh Ji]] in 1699<ref>BBC History of Sikhiam - The Khalsa [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/history/history_1.shtml]</ref>.  This gives the Sikhs, as an organized political grouping, a relatively recent history of around 400 years.  Migrations of Sikhs during the era of the Gurus were limited to the boundaries of modern day [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], and in particular restricted to the Sikh tribal heartland of the [[Punjab Region]].  The development of the [[Sikh Confederacy]] and the development of the [[Sikh Empire]] (1716-1849), led to Sikhs migrating to conquered parts of their empire such as [[Ladakh]] and [[Peshawar]].  However these migrations were limited, transitory and unsustained, depending on the [[Sikh Empire|Empire's]] fluctuating boundaries.  During the time of the [[Sikh Empire]], there was a net cultural immigration, with [[Napoleonic]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] influences vying for the 'ear' of the then Sikh Maharajah [[Ranjit Singh]]<ref>Maharaja Ranjit Singh: Lord of the Five Rivers (French Sources of Indian History Series) by Jean-Marie Lafont. Pub. by Oxford University Press (2002). Pp. 23-29. ISBN 0195661117</ref>.  With respect to the Sikh diaspora, the most important political aspect of this period was the historical establishment of a Sikh homeland; the idea of a powerful Sikh state was a reality.

==Annexation of the Punjab==
[[Image:Dalip singh winterhalter.jpg|thumb|right|Maharajah [[Duleep Singh]], the first and most famous member of the Sikh diaspora]]
Sikh migration from the Punjab began in earnest in the second half of the 19th century when the [[British Raj]] had successfully completed its annexation of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]].  The pivotal action in the British annexation was the lifetime exile of the then eleven year old Marahrajah, [[Duleep Singh]], thus making Singh the first (although unwilling) member of the Sikh diaspora. 

Although a largely secular figure who did little for the Sikh body politic, Axel (2001)<ref>''A review of The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation of the Sikh "Diaspora"'' by Brian Keith Axel .  Pub. by Duke University Press (2001).
</ref>argues that Duleep Singh's exile has had a major impact on the Sikh diaspora psyche.  Axel(2001)<ref>''A review of The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation of the Sikh "Diaspora"'' by Brian Keith Axel .  Pub. by Duke University Press (2001). Pp. 48-65</ref> says that [[Duleep Singh]] is the archetypal 'tragic hero' figure in Sikh culture, "a King without a Kingdom, a Sikh separated from his people"; the contrast between [[Duleep Singh]] and his strong ruler father, [[Ranjit Singh]], makes [[Duleep]]'s exile even more 'galling' for the Sikhs and results in a strong sense of communal injustice, which is a later trait in the diaspora's development.

Having annexed the [[Sikh Kingdom]], the [[British Raj]] preferentially recruited Sikhs in the [[Indian Civil Service]] and, in particular, the [[British Indian Army]], which led to migration of Sikhs to different parts of [[India|British India]] and the [[British Empire]]<ref>Diffusion of Sikhism and recent migration patterns of Sikhs in India by A. K. Dutt1 and S. Devgun. Pub. GeoJournal Volume 1, Number 5 / September,1977.Pp 81-89. Available online [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p726g4t656018333/]</ref>.    Semiskilled artisans were also transported from the Punjab to British [[East Africa]] to help in the building of railways. After World War II, Sikhs emigrated from both India and Pakistan, most going to the [[Sikhism in United Kingdom|UK]] but many also headed for [[North America]]. Some of the Sikhs who had settled in eastern Africa were expelled by Ugandan dictator [[Idi Amin]] in 1972<ref>Sikhism. Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 12 Sept. 2007 [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-253167]</ref>.  Sikhs are primarily an agrarian community and with the pressures of having only a limited amount of land, high birth rates and the desire to make a better living, the male offspring of Sikh farmers were encouraged to migrate to foreign countries.  Subsequently the main 'push' factor for Sikh migration has been economic with significant Sikh communities now being found in [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Malaysia]], [[East Africa]], [[Australasia]] and [[Thailand]].

==Agitation for a homeland==

Axel (2001)<ref>''A review of The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation of the Sikh "Diaspora"'' by Brian Keith Axel .  Pub. by Duke University Press (2001).</ref> argues that the Sikh diaspora community, having established themselves in foreign countries begin to fetishize the past and nurture idealized designs for their 'lost' Sikh empire.  This come into fruition to a certain degree with the establishment of [[Punjab (India)|Indian Punjab]] in 1966 as a Sikh majority state.  However Tatla(1998)<ref>The Sikh Diaspora Search for Statehood by Darshan Singh Tatla(1998). Pp. 16-33. Pub. by University of Washington Press. 10-295-97715-9</ref> argues that the marginalization and sense of grievance that Indian Sikhs were facing due to [[Indira Ghandi]]'s heavy handed tactics, were amplified in the Sikh diaspora.  Subsequently, the Sikh diaspora, especially in Canada<ref>The Sikh Diaspora in Vancouver: Three Generations Amid Tradition, Modernity, and Multiculturalism by Kamala Elizabeth Nayar. Pub. by University of Toronto Press (April 8, 2004) Pp.34-57.  ISBN-10: 0802086314</ref> and the UK become willing suppliers of logistical and financial support when the organic agitation for a separate Sikh nation, [[Khalistan]], began in the late 1970s.  The actions taken by the Indian government to counter the Sikh separatist movement, via 1984's [[Operation Bluestar]], had a seismic effect on the Sikh diaspora.  Axel (2001) <ref>''A review of The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation of the Sikh "Diaspora"'' by Brian Keith Axel .  Pp.68 - 72. Pub. by Duke University Press (2001).</ref> argues that the desecration of the Sikh's holiest shrine, [[Golden Temple|Harimander Sahib]], and the following [[anti-Sikh riots]] in which thousands of Sikhs were massacred; led to a resurgence in Sikh religiosity and a strengthening of ties with their Sikh brethren in [[Punjab]].  Diaspora Sikhs felt betrayed by India, and the events of 1984 defined their Sikhism and underlined a distinct commonality shared with other diaspora Sikhs.  Mark Tully<ref>BBC Archives: After Blue Star [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/171_afterbluestar/]</ref> describes 1984s [[Operation Bluestar]] as the Sikh's '[[9/11]]', this was certainly the case for diaspora Sikhs, who in the main could only watch on in horror as the events of 1984 played out on TV.

In 1971 Dr Jagit Singh Chohan, an ex-minister in a short-lived government of [[Akali]] dissidents, saw an alignment of like-minded Sikhs.  Chohan placed a half-page advertisement in The New York Times of 12 October 1971, making several claims about Punjab as a Sikh homeland.  However Chohan won little sympathy from ordinary Sikhs<ref name="Sikh Religion">

Tatla summarises the change in Sikh diaspora community leaders post 1984 a being a "painful transition from a self-confident community with haughty discourse, to the self-defensive strategies of a vulnerable minority"<ref name ="Sikh Religion"/>.  Organisations such as the International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), the Babbar Khalsa and the Council of Khalistan emerged within the diaspora, and these agencies rallied against "Hindu imperialism" and lobbied to join the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization [[UNPO]] aligning the Sikh cause with other ethnic groups seeking freedom, citing cases of Jews, Palestinians, Kurds, Armenians, Kashmiris, Nagas and Tamils.

Whilst the rate of Sikh migration from the [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] has remained high, traditional patterns of Sikh migration, that favored English speaking countries, particularly the [[United Kingdom]] has changed in the past decade due to factors such as stricter immigration procedures.  Moliner(2006)<ref>Sikh Migration Patterns - 'Workshop on Indian Migration' at Laboratoire d’Anthropologie Urbaine/CNRS (14/15th of November 2006) Abstract 'Sikhs in France' by  Christine MOLINER (PhD Student, Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) [http://www.ivry.cnrs.fr/lau/IMG/rtf/Abstracts.rtf]</ref> states that as a consequence of the 'fact' that Sikh migration to the UK had "become virtually impossible since the late 1970s", Sikh migration patterns altered to continental Europe.  [[Italy]] has now emerged as a fast-growing area for Sikh migration<ref>Sikh Storia e immigrazione - The Sikhs: History and Immigration by R. Cipriani(2006). Pub. in International Sociology.2006; 21: 474-476 Available on [http://iss.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/21/3/474]</ref>, with [[Reggio Emilia]] and the [[Vicenza]] province being areas of significant Sikh population clusters <ref>Now, Sikhs do a Canada in Italy [http://www.nriinternet.com/EUROPE/ITALY/2004/111604Gurdwara.htm]</ref>.  The Italian Sikhs are generally involved in the areas of [[agriculture]], agro-processing, machine tools and [[horticulture]]<ref>Report of 'NRI' News in ITALY [http://www.nriinternet.com/EUROPE/ITALY/2007/0701_Visa_office_in_Chandigarh.htm]</ref>.

Axel (2001)<ref>''A review of The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation of the Sikh "Diaspora"'' by Brian Keith Axel .  Pub. by Duke University Press (2001).</ref> argues that the history of the Sikh diaspora, its psyche of grievance and the violence inflicted on it, means that the notion of the Sikh diaspora as a community today inevitably converges on the notion of Khalistan.  In addition to this, Axel points out the 'nightmare' scenario facing the Sikh diaspora; the Indian state 'demands' the 'Unity-in-Diversity' model of 'rashtriya ekta' (national integration) which Axel contends is signified by "the denial of difference through surrender, assimilation and integration".  Since the formation of the Khalsa, the Sikhs have defined themselves though their 'separateness' and have differentiated themselves philosophically and physically from other Indian religious communities, thus the process of 'rashtriya ekta' is a threat to Sikhi itself.  Any 'weakening' or 'dilution' Sikhi in the Punjab, is doubly painful for the Sikh diaspora for it means a corresponding weakness in Khalistan, which, both real and imaginary, epitomizes the Sikh diasporic place today.
