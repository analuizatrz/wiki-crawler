'''''Heartbreaker''''' is the seventh and final album by [[England|English]] [[rock (music)|rock]] group [[Free (band)|Free]], that provided them with one of their most successful singles, "Wishing Well". It was recorded in late 1972 after [[bassist]] [[Andy Fraser]] had left the band and while [[guitarist]] [[Paul Kossoff]] was ailing from an addiction to [[Mandrax]] (contemporary photographs show him looking gaunt and emaciated), and features a different line up to previous albums: [[Tetsu Yamauchi]] was brought in to replace Fraser, while [[John Bundrick|John "Rabbit" Bundrick]] became the band's keyboard player to compensate for the increasingly unreliable Kossoff (singer [[Paul Rodgers]] played keyboards on the previous album ''[[Free at Last (Free album)|Free at Last]]'', but was nowhere near as proficient a player as Bundrick). Both Yamauchi and Bundrick had played with Kossoff and [[drummer]] [[Simon Kirke]] on the album [[Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu & Rabbit (album)|Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu & Rabbit]] during that period in late 1971 where the band had broken up. Also, several other musicians were used on the album. This, plus the fact that the album was co-produced by [[Andy Johns]] as well as Free, resulted in the most professional and well-produced album for some time, and also one that is considerably mellower and more mature than many previous efforts. Indeed, there are almost no points of comparison between this and their debut album ''[[Tons of Sobs]]'' in 1968.

==Line up==
*Paul Rodgers - vocals
*Paul Kossoff - guitar
*John "Rabbit" Bundrick - keyboards
*Tetsu Yamauchi - bass
*Simon Kirke - drums
*"Snuffy" Walden - guitar on "Easy on My Soul"
*[[Rebop Kwaku Baah]] - congas on "Wishing Well"

NOTE: The album lists Kossoff as an additional musician (due to excessive drug problems the band had hired a session musician); since this is technically not correct, the listing above has been amended slightly.

==Recording==
One immediate effect of Fraser's departure was the loss of the Fraser/Rodgers songwriting partnership that had hitherto provided the bulk of the band's catalogue. Hence many of the songs were written solely by Rodgers, although some are credited to the entire band as a symbolic gesture (including the single "Wishing Well"). Bundrick wrote two of the album's eight tracks.

Yamauchi had only a very minor influence in the band; the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] bassist was unfamiliar with the English language and in any case was unwilling to jeopardise playing in a relatively well-known and well-regarded British band. Bundrick, on the other hand, was more volatile and frequently clashed with Rodgers just as Fraser had done: they even once had a [[Assault|fist-fight]] in a [[London]] [[restaurant]]. 

Meanwhile, Kossoff was extremely resentful of [[session musician]]s brought in periodically to replace him when the other band members' patience began to break. This exacerbated even further his problems, but on those occasions where recording went well he produced some notable work; he is in fact far more prominent on this album than on the previous one. 

[[Island Records]] boss [[Chris Blackwell]] disliked the band's initial mix of the album and drafted regular engineer Andy Johns to solve the problem; in January 1973 the album was ready for release.
==Reception==
The album was, by Free's standards, a huge success.  It became their third top-ten album in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (reaching #9), and reached #47 in [[North America|America]], which was also a considerable success for the band. Also, the single release "Wishing Well" became their third-most successful single, reaching #7. It is widely regarded as one of their definitive songs.  The song was later [[cover version|cover]]ed by Southern rock band [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]] on their album ''[[Strikes (album)|Strikes]]'' ([[1979 in music|1979]]).

Despite the success of the album and impending tour of America, it finally became apparent that the band had passed the point of no return. Kossoff being credited as an additional musician came as a shock to the entire band. Kossoff spiralled to his lowest ebb and was unable to go to America; he was replaced with [[Wendell Richardson]] from [[Osibisa]]. He proved to be a poor choice, and eventually the band finally gave up. Rodgers and Kirke formed [[Bad Company]] with [[Mick Ralphs]] (formerly of [[Mott the Hoople]]) and [[Boz Burrell]] (formerly of [[King Crimson]]); Yamauchi joined [[the Faces]]; Bundrick became a session musician and eventually became a regular [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] player with [[the Who]]; Kossoff tried to form his own band [[Back Street Crawler]]. After two unsuccessful albums, the guitarist died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on board an [[fixed-wing aircraft|aeroplane]] on the [[19 March]] [[1976]], at the age of 25.
