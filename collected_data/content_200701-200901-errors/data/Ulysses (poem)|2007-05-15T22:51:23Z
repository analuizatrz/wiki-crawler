'''Ulysses''' is a [[poem]] by [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], written in 1833 but not published until 1842. It is narrated by an aged Ulysses (the Latin form of [[Odysseus]]) who has become dissatisfied with his life as king of [[Ithaca]]. Ulysses had spent years fighting the Trojans (as described in the [[Iliad]]) and trying to return home (which is the subject of [[The Odyssey]]); but now that his journey is complete he feels restless and yearns to get back out into the world.  

:''Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole''<br>
:''Unequal laws unto a savage race,''<br>
:''That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.''<br>

He declares his intent to leave the throne to his son [[Telemachus]] ("He works his work, I mine") and gather up all of his old sailors for one final voyage:

:''                                ... my purpose holds''<br>
:''To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths''<br>
:''Of all the western stars, until I die.''<br>
:''It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;''<br>
:''It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,''<br>
:''And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.''<br>
:''Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'''<br>
:''We are not now that strength which in old days''<br>
:''Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,--''<br>
:''One equal temper of heroic hearts,''<br>
:''Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will''<br>
:''To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.''<br>

==The Verse==

''Ulysses'' is written in 70 lines of [[blank verse]]. Its strongly-accented [[iambic pentameter]] uses simple, strong words, as befits a king on rocky Ithaca, but the many [[enjambment|enjambed]] lines<ref>Kurshan</ref> give a flow to the monologue that accords with the restlessness of the man of action. In particular, the last twenty syllables are as happy a matching of sound and sense as English poetry affords.<ref>Reese, p.368</ref>

==Viewpoints==

Tennyson is questioning what becomes of the hero after the quest.  Even a man as clever as Ulysses could not outwit the Fates and, like everyone else, he grew old.  Although many readers have accepted the last lines of the poem as inspirational, it is not clear that Tennyson intended them as such.  

Ulysses intends to die contending as his story is one of eternal becoming and not one of being.  Ulysses 'knew himself' (cogno auton) in the sense of the ancient Greeks and knew his fate was to forever sail with his men after his reunion with Penelope.  Tennyson in essence creates new mythology by giving us the story of the old age of Ulysses.  And why not?  Why not set out again to that part of life which marks most of one's life for what it once was?  Plutarch writes 'I am not telling you histories but lives'.  Sadly modern man has forgotten how to live - he only exists.  But the ancients knew that man's character was born in his life and Ulysses can do nothing but to return to what he is - himself.  He will sail to the West until he dies...

The figure of Ulysses was not particularly praised in the [[Victorian era]]. While he was a hero, Tennyson's Ulysses is prideful.  As with the [[Byronic hero]], Ulysses allows his personal pride to endanger lives.  It has been theorized (by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] among others) that Tennyson's conception of Ulysses is based more on Dante's depiction of him in [[the Divine Comedy]] (Canto XXVI of the Inferno) than on the character presented by [[Homer]].

Another, far more straightforward, way to look at the poem is that the poet meant exactly what he said without irony or attempt at contradiction.  The passion and conviction of his language signify that Tennyson, as was typical in the Victorian age, deeply admired courage and persistence and wrote the poem as a metaphor for never surrendering the questing spirit of youth, never giving up, never ceasing to fight for one's dreams,  even though one has grown grey over the years. Had the poet not intended this, the last lines and much of the body would not be as forceful and intentionally inspiring as they are.
