'''Platelets''', or '''[[thrombocytes]]''', are small cytoplasmic bodies derived from [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s. They circulate in the [[blood]] of [[mammal]]s and are involved in [[hemostasis]] leading to the formation of [[thrombus|blood clot]]s. Like red blood cells, platelets have no nucleus. 

If the number of platelets is too low, excessive [[hemorrhage|bleeding]] can occur; however, if the number of platelets is too high, blood clots can form ([[thrombosis]]) which block blood vessels, and may cause a stroke and/or a heart attack.  An abnormality or disease of the platelets is called a '''thrombocytopathy'''<ref>{{cite book

==Kinetics==
*Platelets are produced in blood cell formation (thrombopoiesis) in bone marrow, by budding off from [[megakaryocytes]].  
*The physiological range for platelets is 150-400 x 10<sup>9</sup> per litre.  
*Around 1 x 10<sup>11</sup> platelets are produced each day by an average adult.
*The lifespan of circulating platelets is 7-10 days.
*This process is regulated by [[thrombopoietin]], a hormone usually produced by the [[liver]] and [[kidney]]. 
*Each megakaryocyte produces between 5,000 and 10,000 platelets.
*Old platelets are destroyed by the [[spleen]] and by [[Kupffer cell]]s in the [[liver]].

==Thrombus formation==
The function of platelets is the maintenance of [[hemostasis|haemostasis]].  Primarily, this is achieved by the formation of thrombi, when damage to the [[endothelium]] of [[blood vessel]]s occurs.  Conversely, thrombus formation must be inhibited at times when there is no damage to the endothelium.

=== Activation ===
The inner surface of blood vessels is lined with a thin layer of [[endothelial]] cells, that in normal hemostasis, acts to inhibit platelet activation with the production of endothelial-ADPase, [[noradrenaline]], and [[prostacyclin|PGI<sub>2</sub>]].  Endothelial-ADPase clears away ADP, a platelet activator, from platelet surface receptors.

Endothelial cells produce a protein called [[von Willebrand's factor]], a cell adhesion ligand, which helps endothelial cells adhere to [[collagen]] in the [[basement membrane]].  Under physiological conditions, collagen does not pass into the bloodstream;  however vWF is secreted constitutively into the plasma by the endothelial cells that produce it, or otherwise is stored within the endothelial cell or in platelets.

When endothelial damage occurs, platelets come into contact with exposed collagen and vWF, and the inhibitors the endothelium normally secretes are reduced.

The inner surface of blood vessels is lined with a thin layer of [[endothelial]] cells. Under this is a layer of [[collagen]]. When the endothelial layer is injured, the collagen is exposed.

When the platelets contact collagen, they are [[#Activators|activated]]. They are also activated by [[thrombin]] (primarily through [[Protease-activated receptor|PAR]]-1), [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] receptors ([[P2Y1]] and [[P2Y12]]) expressed on platelets. They can also be activated by a negatively charged surface, such as glass. 

Platelet activation further results in the [[scramblase]]-mediated transport of negatively charged phospholipids to the platelet surface. These phospholipids provide a catalytic surface (with the charge provided by [[phosphatidylserine]] and [[phosphatidylethanolamine]]) for the [[tenase]] and [[prothrombinase]] complexes.

=== Shape Change ===
Activated platelets change in shape to become more spherical, and pseudopods form on their surface.

=== Granule Secretion ===
Platelets contain [[Platelet_alpha-granule|alpha]] and [[dense granule|dense]] granules.  Activated platelets excrete the contents of these granules into their [[canalicular system|canalicular systems]] and into surrounding blood. There are two types of granules:

* [[dense granule]]s (containing [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] or [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[calcium]] and [[serotonin]]) 
* [[α-granule]]s (containing [[platelet factor 4]], [[PDGF]], [[fibronectin]], B-thromboglobulin, [[von Willebrand factor|vWF]], [[fibrinogen]], and [[coagulation factor]]s [[factor V|V]] and [[factor XIII|XIII]]).

=== Thromboxane A2 Synthesisis ===
Platelet activation initiates the arachidonic acid pathway to produce [[Thromboxane|TXA<sub>2</sub>]].  TXA<sub>2</sub> is involved in activating other platelets.

=== Adhesion and aggregation === <!--Platelet aggregation redirects here-->
Platelets aggregate, or clump together, using [[fibrinogen]] of vWF as a connecting agent.

The most abundant platelet aggregation receptor is [[glycoprotein]] (GP) IIb/IIIa; this is a calcium-dependent receptor for fibrinogen, [[fibronectin]], vitronectin, thrombospondin and [[von Willebrand factor]] (vWF). Other receptors include GPIb-V-IX complex (vWF) and GPVI ([[collagen]]).

Activated platelets will adhere, via [[glycoprotein]] (GP) Ia, to the collagen that is exposed by endothelial damage

Aggregation and adhesion act together to form the platelet plug. The high concentration of [[myosin]] and [[actin]] filaments in platelets are stimulated to contract during aggregation, further reinforcing the plug.

Platelet aggregation is stimulated by [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], [[thromboxane]] and [[α2 receptor]]-activation, but inhibited by other inflammatory products like [[PGI2]] and [[PGD2]].
Platelet aggregation is enhanced by exogenous administration of anabolic steroids.In a double blind study in young males, testosterone cypionate increased human platelet TXA<sub>2</sub> receptor density and the aggregation responses[ 3]. This is consistent with clinical observations that  young adults (both athletes and non-athletes) who abuse steroids, there is increased incidence of premature myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and thrombotic stroke [4].

===Cytokine signalling===
Besides being the chief cellular effector of [[hemostasis]], platelets are rapidly deployed to sites of injury or infection and potentially modulate inflammatory processes by interacting with [[leukocytes]] and by secreting [[cytokines]], [[chemokines]] and other inflammatory mediators<ref>{{cite journal | author=Weyrich A.S.

==Role in disease==
===High and low counts===
A normal platelet count in a healthy person is between 150,000 and 400,000 per mm³ (microlitre) of blood (150&ndash;400 x 10<sup>9</sup>/[[litre|L]]).<ref>{{Cite web

|title=Platelet count aka thrombocyte count

|author=[[Lab Tests Online UK]]
|accessdate=2008-05-22

95% of healthy people will have platelet counts in this range. Some will have statistically abnormal platelet counts while having no abnormality, although if the platelet count is either very low or very high, the likelihood of an abnormality being present is higher.

Both [[thrombocytopenia]] (or thrombopenia) and [[thrombocytosis]] may present with coagulation problems. Generally, low platelet counts increase bleeding risks (although there are exceptions, e.g. immune [[heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]]) and [[thrombocytosis]] (high counts) may lead to thrombosis (although this is mainly when the elevated count is due to myeloproliferative disorder).

Low platelet counts are generally not corrected by transfusion unless the patient is bleeding or the count has fallen below 5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L; it is contraindicated in [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (TTP) as it fuels the coagulopathy. In patients having surgery, a level below 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) is associated with abnormal surgical bleeding, and regional anaesthetic procedures such as [[epidural]]s are avoided for levels below 80-100.

Normal platelet counts are not a guarantee of adequate function. In some states the platelets, while being adequate in number, are ''dysfunctional''. For instance, [[aspirin]] irreversibly disrupts platelet function by inhibiting [[cyclooxygenase]]-1 (COX1), and hence normal hemostasis; Platelets have no DNA and are unable to produce new cyclooxygenase. Normal platelet function will not return until the aspirin has ceased and enough of the affected platelets have been replaced by new ones, which can take over a week. [[Ibuprofen]], another [[NSAID]], does not have such a long duration effect, with platelet function returning in 24 hours <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/142/7/I-54|title=Platelet Function after Taking Ibuprofen for 1 Week|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>, and taking ibuprofen before aspirin will prevent the irreversible effects of aspirin<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atvb.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/3/4/383|title=Ibuprofen protects platelet cyclooxygenase from irreversible inhibition by aspirin|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>. [[Uremia]] (a consequence of [[renal failure]]) leads to platelet dysfunction that may be ameliorated by the administration of [[desmopressin]].

==Discovery==
Brewer<ref name=Brewer>Brewer DB. Max Schultze (1865), G. Bizzozero (1882) and the discovery of the platelet. ''Br J Haematol'' 2006;133:251-8. PMID 16643426.</ref> traced the history of the discovery of the platelet. Although red blood cells had been known since [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek|van Leeuwenhoek]], it was the German anatomist [[Max Johann Sigismund Schultze|Max Schultze]] (1825-1874) who first offered a description of the platelet in his newly founded journal ''Archiv für mikroscopische Anatomie''<ref name=Schultze>Schultze M. Ein heizbarer Objecttisch und seine Verwendung bei Untersuchungen des Blutes. ''Arch Mikrosc Anat'' 1865;1:1-42.</ref>. He describes "spherules" much smaller than red blood cells that are occasionally clumped and may participate in collections of [[fibrin|fibrous material]]. He recommends further study of the findings.

[[Giulio Bizzozero]] (1846-1901), building on Schultze's findings, used "living circulation" to study blood cells of amphibians microscopically ''[[in vivo]]''. One of his findings was the fact that platelets clump at the site of blood vessel injury, which precedes the formation of a [[thrombus|blood clot]]. This observation confirmed the role of platelets in [[coagulation]]<ref name=Bizzozero>Bizzozero J. Über einen neuen Forrnbestandteil des Blutes und dessen Rolle bei der Thrombose und Blutgerinnung. ''Arch Pathol Anat Phys Klin Med'' 1882;90:261-332.</ref>.

==In transfusion medicine==
Platelets are either isolated from collected units of [[whole blood]] and pooled to make a therapeutic dose or collected by [[Apheresis]], sometimes concurrently with [[plasma]] or [[red blood cells]].  The industry standard is for platelets to be tested for [[bacteria]] before transfusion to avoid septic reactions, which can be fatal.

Pooled whole blood platelets, sometimes called "random" platelets, are made by taking a unit of whole blood that has not been cooled and placing it into a large centrifuge in what is referred to as a "soft spin."  This splits the blood into three layers: the plasma, a "buffy coat" layer which includes the platelets, and the red blood cells.  These are expressed into different bags for storage.  From four to six of these are typically pooled into a single bag for a therapeutic dose, though individual components can also be used.

Apheresis platelets are collected using a mechanical device which draws blood from the donor and centrifuges the collected blood to separate out the platelets and other components to be collected.  The remaining blood is returned to the donor.  The advantage to this method is that a single donation provides at least one therapeutic dose, as opposed to the multiple donations for whole blood platelets.  This means that a recipient is not exposed to as many different donors and has less risk of transfusion transmitted disease and other complications.  Sometimes a person such as a [[cancer]] patient who requires routine transfusions of platelets will receive repeated donations from a specific donor to further minimize the risk.

Platelets are not crossmatched unless they contain a significant amount of RBCs, which results in a reddish-orange color to the product.  This is usually associated with whole blood platelets, as apheresis methods are more efficient than "soft spin" centrifugation at isolating the specific components of blood.  An effort is usually made to issue type specific platelets, but this is not as critical as it is with [[red blood cells]].

Platelets collected by either method have a very short shelf life, typically five or seven days depending on the system used.  This results in frequent problems with short supply, as testing the donations often uses up a full day of this time.  Since there are no effective preservative solutions for platelets, they lose potency quickly and are best when fresh.

Platelets, either apheresis or random donor platelets, can be processed through a volume reduction process.  In this process, the platelets are spun in a [[centrifuge]] and the excess [[plasma]] is removed, leaving 10 to 100 ml of platelet concentrate.  Volume reduced platelets are normally only transfused to [[neonatal]] and pediatric patients when a large volume of plasma could overload the child's small circulatory system.  The lower volume of plasma also reduces the chances of an adverse transfusion reaction to plasma proteins.<ref name="pmid16537051">{{cite journal |author=Schoenfeld H, Spies C, Jakob C |title=Volume-reduced platelet concentrates |journal=Curr.
