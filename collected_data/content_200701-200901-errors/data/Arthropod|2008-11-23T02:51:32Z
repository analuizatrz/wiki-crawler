'''Arthropods''' are [[animal]]s belonging to the [[Scientific classification|Phylum]] '''Arthropoda''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:ἄρθρον|ἄρθρον]] ''arthron'', "[[joint]]", and [[wikt:ποδός|ποδός]] ''podos'' "[[foot]]", which together mean "jointed feet"), and include the [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s, [[crustacea]]ns, and others. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and [[cuticle]]s, which are mainly made of α-[[chitin]]; the  cuticles of crustaceans are also [[biomineralization| biomineralized]] with [[calcium carbonate]]. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by [[molt]]ing. The arthropod [[body plan]] consists of repeated [[Segment (biology)|segment]]s, each with a pair of [[appendage]]s. It is so versatile that they have been compared to [[Swiss Army knives]], and it has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all [[Guild (ecology)|ecological guild]]s in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living species, and are one of only two groups very successful in dry environments&nbsp;– the other is [[amniote]]s. They range in size from microscopic [[plankton]] up to forms a few metres long.

Arthropods have  [[body cavity|body cavities]] (coelomates); their main internal cavity is a [[hemocoel]], which accommodates their internal [[Organ (anatomy)| organ]]s and through which their [[blood]] circulates&nbsp;– they have [[Circulatory_system#Open_circulatory_system | open circulatory system]]s. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their [[nervous system]] is "ladder-like", with paired [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Dorsal_and_ventral | ventral]] [[nerve cord]]s running through all segments and forming paired [[ganglia]] in each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their [[brain]]s are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the [[esophagus]]. The  [[respiratory system| respiratory]] and [[excretion| excretory]] systems of arthropods  vary, depending as much on their environment as on the [[subphylum]] to which they belong. 

Vision relies on various combinations of [[compound]] eyes and pigment-pit [[ocelli]]: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which light is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information, but the main eyes of [[spider]]s are ocelli that can form images and, in a few cases, can swivel to track prey. Arthropods also have a wide range of chemical and mechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many [[seta]]e (bristles) that project through their cuticles. Methods of reproduction and development of arthropods are diverse&nbsp;– all terrestrial species use [[internal fertilization]], but this is often by indirect transfer of the sperm via an appendage or the ground, rather by direct injection. Aquatic species use either internal or [[external fertilization]]. Almost all arthropods lay eggs, except for [[scorpion]]s, who give birth to live young after the eggs have hatched inside the mother. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs and [[caterpillar]]s that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total [[metamorphosis]] to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from zero to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.

The versatility of the arthropod modular body plan has made it difficult for [[zoologist]]s and [[paleontologist]]s to classify them and work out their evolutionary ancestry, which dates back to the [[Cambrian]] period. From the late 1950s to late 1970s, it was thought that arthropods were [[polyphyletic]], that is, there was no single arthropod ancestor. Now they are generally regarded as [[monophyletic]]. Traditionally  the  closest evolutionary relatives of arthropods were considered to be [[annelid]] worms, as both groups have segmented bodies. It is now generally accepted that arthropods belong to the [[superphylum]] [[Ecdysozoa]] ("animals that molt"), while annelids belong to another superphylum, [[Lophotrochozoa]]. The relationships between various arthropod groups are still actively debated.

Although arthropods contribute to human food supply both directly as food and more importantly as [[polination| pollinator]]s of crops, they also spread some of the most severe diseases and do considerable damage to [[livestock]] and crops.

===Diversity===
Estimating the total number of living species is extremely difficult because it often depends on a series of assumptions in order to scale up from counts at specific locations to estimates for the whole world. A study in 1992 estimated that there were 500,000 species in Costa Rica alone, of which 365,000 were arthropods.<ref name="Thompson1994CoevolutionaryProcess" /> 
Another estimate indicates that arthropods have over a million described species, and account for over 80% of all known living species.<ref>{{citation |author=Anna Thanukos |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/arthropodstory |title=The Arthropod Story |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] | accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref> They are important members of marine, freshwater, land and air [[ecosystem]]s, and are one of only two major animal groups that have adapted to life in dry environments – the other is [[amniote]]s, whose living members are [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518">{{citation

They contain an inner zone ([[procuticle]]), which is made of protein and chitin and is responsible for the strength of the exoskeleton. The outer zone ([[epicuticle]]) lies on the surface of the procuticle. It is non-chitinous and is a complex of [[proteins]] and [[lipids]]. It provides the moisture proofing and protection to the procuticle. The exoskeleton takes the form of plates called ''[[sclerite]]s'' on the segments, plus rings on the appendages that divide them into segments separated by joints. This is in fact what gives arthropods their name — jointed feet — and separates them from their relatives, the [[Onychophora]] and [[Tardigrada]], also called [[Lobopoda]] (and which is sometimes included in a group called [[Panarthropoda]] that also includes arthropods). The exoskeletons of arthropods strengthen them against attack by predators and are impermeable to water. In order to grow, an arthropod must shed its old exoskeleton and secrete a new one. This process, [[ecdysis]], is expensive in terms of energy, and during the molting period, an arthropod is vulnerable.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} -->

The cuticle can have [[seta]]e (bristles) growing from special cells in the epidermis. Setae are as varied in form and function as appendages. For example, they are often used as sensors to detect air or water currents, or contact with objects; aquatic arthropods use [[feather]]-like setae to increase the surface area of swimming appendages and to [[filter feeding| filter]] food particles out of water; aquatic insects, which are air-breathers, use thick [[felt]]-like coats of setae to trap air, extending the time they can spend under water; heavy, rigid setae serve  as defensive spines.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518" />

Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, some still use [[hydraulic]] pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors<ref>{{citation

===Molting===
The exoskeleton cannot stretch and thus restricts growth. Arthropods therefore replace their exoskeletons by [[molt]]ing, or  shedding the old exoskeleton after growing a new one which is not yet hardened. Molting cycles run nearly continuously until an arthropod reaches full size.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524">{{citation 
| author=Ruppert, E.E., Fox, R.S., and Barnes, R.D. | title=Invertebrate Zoology

}}</ref>

In the initial phase of molting , the animal stops feeding and its epidermis releases [[molting fluid]], a mixture of [[enzyme]]s that digests the [[endocuticle]] and thus detaches the old cuticle. This phase begins when the [[epidermis]] has secreted a new [[epicuticle]] to protect it from the enzymes, and the epidermis secretes the new exocuticle while the old cuticle is detaching. When this stage is complete, the animal makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air,  and this makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest. It commonly takes several minutes for the animal to struggle out of the old cuticle. At this point the new one is wrinkled and so soft that the animal cannot support itself and finds it very difficult to move, and the new endocuticle has not yet formed. The animal continues to pump itself up to stretch the new cuticle as much as possible, then hardens the new exocuticle and eliminates the excess air or water. By the end of this phase the new endocuticle has formed. Many arthropods then eat the discarded cuticle to reclaim its materials. <ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524" />

Because arthropods are unprotected and nearly immobilized until the new cuticle has hardened, they are in danger both of being trapped in the old cuticle and of being attacked by predators. Molting may be responsible for 80 to 90% of all arthropod deaths.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524" />

===Internal organs===
{{Annotated image/Basic arthropod internal structure}}
Arthropod bodies are also segmented internally, and the nervous, muscular, circulatory and excretory systems have repeated components.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518" /> Arthopods come from a lineage of animals that have a [[coelom]], a membrane-lined cavity between the gut and the body wall that accommodates the internal organs. The strong, segmented limbs of  arthropods  eliminate the need for one of the coelom's main ancestral functions, as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]] which muscles compress in order to change the animal's shape and thus enable it to move. Hence the coelom of the arthropod is reduced to small areas around the reproductive and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a [[hemocoel]], a cavity that runs most of the length of the body and through which [[blood]] flows.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528">{{citation 
| author=Ruppert, E.E., Fox, R.S., and Barnes, R.D. | title=Invertebrate Zoology

}}</ref>

Arthropods have open [[circulatory system]]s, although most have a few short, open-ended [[artery| arteries]]. In chelicerates and crustaceans, the blood carries [[oxygen]] to the tissues, while [[hexapod]]s use a separate system of [[Invertebrate trachea| trachea]]e. Many crustaceans, but few chelicerates and [[tracheata| tracheate]]s, use [[respiratory pigment]]s to assist oxygen transport. The most common respiratory pigment in arthropods is [[copper]]-based [[hemocyanin]]; this is used by many crustaceans and a few [[centipede]]s. A few crustaceans and insects use iron-based [[hemoglobin]], the respiratory pigment used by [[vertebrate]]s. As with other invertebrates and unlike among vertebrates, the respiratory pigments of those arthropods that have them are generally dissolved in the blood and rarely enclosed in [[Blood cell| corpuscles]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528" />

The heart is typically a muscular tube that runs just under the back and for most of the length of the hemocoel. It contracts in ripples that run from rear to front, pushing blood forwards. Elastic ligaments, or small muscles, connect the heart to the body wall and expand sections that are not being squeezed by the heart muscle. Along the heart run a series of paired [[Ostium| ostia]], non-return valves that allow blood to enter the heart but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528" />

Arthropods have a wide variety of respiratory systems. Small species often do not have any, since their high ratio of surface area to volume enables simple diffusion through the body surface to supply enough oxygen. Crustacea usually have gills that are modified appendages. Many arachnids have [[book lung]]s. Tracheae, systems of branching tunnels that run from the openings in the body walls, deliver oxygen directly to individual cells in many insects, myriapods and [[arachnid]]s.<ref>{{citation

Living arthropods have paired main nerve cords running along their bodies below the gut, and in each segment the cords form a pair of [[ganglia]] from which [[sensory nerve| sensory]] and [[motor nerve| motor]] nerves run to other parts of the segment. Although the pairs of ganglia in each segment often appear physically fused, they are connected by [[commissure]]s (relatively large bundles of nerves), which give arthropod nervous systems a characteristic "ladder-like" appearance. The brain is in the head, encircling and mainly ''above'' the [[esophagus]]. It consists of the fused ganglia of the acron and one or two of the foremost segments that form the head - a total of three pairs of ganglia in most arthropods, but only two in chelicerates, which do not have antennae or the ganglion connected to them. The ganglia of other head segments are often close to the brain and function as part of it. In insects these other head ganglia combine into a pair of subesophageal ganglia, under and behind the esophagus. Spiders take this process a step further, as ''all'' the segmental ganglia are incorporated into the subesophageal ganglia, which occupy most of the space in the cephalothorax (front "super-segment").<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P531To532">{{citation

There are two different types of arthropod excretory systems. In aquatic arthropods, the end-product of biochemical reactions that [[metabolism| metabolise]] [[nitrogen]] is [[ammonia]], which is so toxic that it needs to be diluted as much as possible with water. The ammonia is then eliminated via any permeable membrane, mainly through the gills. All crustaceans use this system, and its high consumption of water may be responsible for the relative lack of success of crustaceans  as land animals.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530">{{citation

| publisher=Brooks / Cole | edition=7 | isbn=0030259827 | date=2004 | pages=529-530 
}}</ref>  Various groups of terrestrial arthropods have independently developed a different system: the end-product of nitrogen metabolism is [[uric acid]], which can be excreted as dry material; [[Malphigian tubules]] filter the uric acid and other nitrogenous waste out of the blood in the hemocoel, and dump these materials into the hindgut, from which they are expelled as [[feces]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530" /> Most aquatic arthropods and some terrestrial ones also have organs called [[nephridia]] ("little [[kidney]]s"), which extract other wastes for excretion as [[urine]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530" />

===Senses===
{{main|Arthropod eye}}
The stiff [[cuticle]]s of arthropods would block out information about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly [[seta]]e, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of [[taste]] and [[smell]], often by means of setae. Pressure sensors often take the form of [[membrane]]s that function as [[eardrum]]s, but are connected directly to nerves rather than to [[auditory ossicle]]s. The [[Antenna (biology)| antenna]]e of most [[hexapod]]s include sensor packages that monitor [[humidity]], moisture and temperature. <ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537">{{citation

Most arthropods have sophisticated visual systems that include one or more usually both of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-cup [[ocelli]] ("little eyes"). In most cases ocelli are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming, using the shadow cast by the walls of the cup. However the main eyes of [[spider]]s are pigment-cup ocelli that are capable of forming images,<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537" /> and those of [[jumping spider]]s can rotate to track prey.<ref>{{citation

Compound eyes consist of fifteen to several thousand independent [[ommatidia]], columns that are usually  [[hexagon]]al in [[cross-section]]. Each ommatidium is an independent sensor, with its own light-sensitive cells and often with its own [[lens]] and [[cornea]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537">{{citation

Most arthropods lack balance and [[acceleration]] sensors, and rely on their eyes to  tell them which way is up. The self-righting behavior of [[cockroach]]es is triggered when pressure sensors on the underside of the feet report no pressure. However many [[malacostracan]] [[crustacean]]s have [[statocyst]]s, which provide the same sort of information as the balance and motion sensors of the vertebrate [[inner ear]].<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537" />

The [[proprioceptor]]s of arthropods, sensors which report the force exerted by muscles and the degree of bending in the body and joints, are well understood. However, little is known about what other internal sensors Arthropods may have.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537" />

==Reproduction and development==
[[Image:scorpionwithyoung.JPG|150px|right|thumb|''Compsobuthus werneri'' female with young (white)]]
A few arthropods, such as [[barnacle]]s, are [[hermaphroditic]], that is, each can have the organs of both [[sex]]es. However, individuals of most species remain of one sex all their lives.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P537To539" /> A few species of [[insect]]s and [[crustacea]]ns can reproduce by [[parthenogenesis]], for example,  without mating, especially if conditions favor a "population explosion". However most arthropods rely on [[sexual reproduction]], and parthenogenetic species often revert to sexual reproduction when conditions become less favorable.<ref name="Olive2001ReproductionInvertebratesInEncOfLifeSci">{{citation

All known terrestrial arthropods use internal fertilization, as unprotected sperm and ova would not survive long in these environments. In a few cases the sperm transfer is direct from the male's [[penis]] to the female's [[oviduct]], but it is more often indirect. Some crustaceans and spiders use modified appendages to transfer the sperm to the female. On the other hand, many male terrestrial arthropods produce [[spermatophore]]s, water-proof packets of sperm, which the females take into their bodies. A few such species rely on females to find spermatophores that have already been deposited on the ground, but in most cases males only deposit spermatophores when complex [[courtship]] rituals look likely be successful.<ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004P537To539">{{citation

From the late 1950s to the late 1970s, [[Sidnie Manton]] and others argued that arthropods are [[polyphyletic]], in other words, they do not share a common ancestor ''that was itself an arthropod''. Instead, they proposed that three separate groups of "arthropods" evolved separately from common worm-like ancestors: the [[chelicerate]]s, including [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s; the [[crustacean]]s; and the [[uniramia]], consisting of [[onychophoran]]s, [[myriapod]]s and [[hexapod]]s. These arguments usually bypassed [[trilobite]]s, as the evolutionary relationships of this class  were unclear. Proponents of polyphyly argued the following:  that the similarities between these groups are the results of [[convergent evolution]], as natural consequences of having rigid, segmented [[exoskeleton]]s; that the three groups use different chemical means of hardening the cuticle; that there were significant differences in the construction of their [[compound eyes]]; that  it is hard to see how such different configurations of segments and appendages in the head could have evolved from the same ancestor; and that crustaceans have [[biramous]] limbs with separate gill and leg branches, while the other two groups have [[uniramous]] limbs in which the single branch serves as a leg.<ref>{{citation

A contrary view was presented in 2003, when Jan Bergström and Xian-Guang Hou argued that, if arthropods were a "sister-group" to any of the anomalacarids, they must have lost and then re-evolved features that were well-developed in the anomalacarids. The earliest known arthropods ate mud in order to extract food particles from it, and possessed variable numbers of segments with unspecialized appendages that functioned as both gills and legs. Anomalocarids were, by the standards of the time, huge and sophisticated predators with specialized mouths and grasping appendages, fixed numbers of segments some of which were specialized, tail fins, and gills that were very different from those of arthropods. This reasoning implies that ''[[Parapeytoia]]'', which has legs and a backward-pointing mouth like that of the earliest arthropods, is a more credible closest relative of arthropods than is ''[[Anomalocaris]]''.<ref>{{citation

Higher up the "family tree", the [[Annelida]] have traditionally been considered the closest relatives of the Panarthropoda, since both groups have segmented bodies, and the combination of these groups was labelled [[Articulata]]. There had been competing proposals that arthropods were closely related to other groups such as [[nematode]]s, [[priapulid]]s and [[tardigrade]]s, but these remained minority views because it was difficult to specify in detail the relationships between these groups.

In the 1990s,  [[molecular phylogenetics]] analyses that compared sequences of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] produced a coherent scheme showing arthropods as members of a [[superphylum]] labelled [[Ecdysozoa]] ("animals that molt"), which contained nematodes, priapulids and tardigrades but excluded annelids. This was backed up by studies of the  anatomy and development of these animals, which showed that many of the features that supported the Articulata hypothesis showed significant differences between annelids and the earliest Panarthropods in their details, and some were hardly present all in arthropods. This hypothesis groups annelids with [[mollusc]]s and [[brachiopod]]s in another superphylum, [[Lophotrochozoa]].

If the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is correct, then segmentation of arthropods and annelids either has evolved [[Convergent evolution|convergently]] or has been inherited from a much older ancestor, and has been subsequently lost in several other lineages, such as the non-arthropod members of the Ecdysozoa.<ref>{{citation

[[Euarthropod]]s are typically [[scientific classification|classified]] into five [[subphylum|subphyla]], of which one is extinct:<ref>{{ITIS|ID=82696|taxon=Arthropoda|date=August 15|year=2006}}</ref>
# '''[[Trilobite]]s''' are a group of formerly numerous marine animals that disappeared in the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]], though they were in decline prior to this killing blow, having been reduced to one order in the [[Late Devonian extinction]].
# '''[[Chelicerata|Chelicerates]]''' include [[spider]]s, [[mite]]s, [[scorpion]]s and related organisms. They are characterised by the presence of [[chelicerae]], appendages just above / in front of the mouth. Chelicerae appear in scorpions as tiny claws that they use in feeding, but those of spiders have developed as fangs that inject venom.
# '''[[Myriapoda|Myriapods]]''' comprise [[millipede]]s and [[centipede]]s and their relatives and have many body segments, each bearing one or two pairs of legs. They are sometimes grouped with the hexapods.
# '''[[Hexapoda|Hexapods]]''' comprise [[insect]]s and three small orders of insect-like animals with six thoracic legs. They are sometimes grouped with the myriapods, in a group called [[Uniramia]], though genetic evidence tends to support a closer relationship between hexapods and crustaceans.
# '''[[Crustacean]]s''' are primarily aquatic (a notable exception being [[woodlouse|woodlice]]) and are characterised by having [[Arthropod leg#Biramous and uniramous|biramous]] appendages. They include [[lobster]]s, [[crab]]s, [[barnacle]]s, [[crayfish]], [[shrimp]] and many others.

Aside from these major groups, there are also a number of fossil forms, mostly from the Early [[Cambrian]], which are difficult to place, either from lack of obvious affinity to any of the main groups or from clear affinity to several of them. ''[[Marrella]]'' was the first one to be recognized as significantly different from the well-known groups.<ref name="Whittington1971Marrella" />

The [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] of the major extant arthropod groups has been an area of considerable interest and dispute. The validity of many of the arthropod groups suggested by earlier authors is being questioned by recent studies; these include [[Mandibulata]], [[Uniramia]] and [[Atelocerata]]. The most recent studies tend to suggest a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] Crustacea with different hexapod groups nested within it. The remaining clade of Myriapoda and Chelicerata is referred to as Paradoxopoda or [[Myriochelata]].<ref name="Hassanin"/><ref>{{citation |quotes=no |title=The position of crustaceans within Arthropoda — Evidence from nine molecular loci and morphology |author=Giribet, G., S.
