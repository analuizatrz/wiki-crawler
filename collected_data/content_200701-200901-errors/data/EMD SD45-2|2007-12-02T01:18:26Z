An '''EMD SD45-2''' is a 6-axle diesel [[locomotive]] built by [[General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] beginning in [[1972]].  Power was provided by an [[EMD 645E3]] 20-[[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] engine which generated 3600 [[horsepower]] (2.7&nbsp;MW). Part of the [[EMD Dash 2]] line, the SD45-2 was an upgraded [[EMD SD45|SD45]].The main spotting difference between an SD45 and a SD45-2 was the long hood configuration and the rear radiator assembly. On the SD45 the long hood is flared whereas on the SD45-2 it is vertical and the rear cooling fans and more spread out over the top of the rear of the long hood. This unit shared the same common frame with the [[EMD SD40-2]] and [[EMD SD38-2]].

A few [[B unit|cabless]] SD45-2Bs also existed; these were rebuilds of wrecked units by ATSF. In most cases, as in the example shown, the [[dynamic brake]]s were moved to the opposite end of the hood from the [[radiator]]s; they were originally near the center of the hood.
