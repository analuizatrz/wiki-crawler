It is directed by Edgar Wright and produced by [[Nira Park]].

==Plot==
<!-- Move information that isn't so important to the Cast section to describe characters, ala the Star Wars/Lord of the Rings articles.-->
{{spoiler}}
Nicholas Angel is one of London's finest policemen. He’s so good, he makes everyone else look bad, and as a result, his superiors send him to a place where his talents won’t be quite so embarrassing - the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford, where there hasn't been a recorded murder for twenty years. Once there, he meets the well-meaning but overeager police officer Danny Butterman, the son of amiable Inspector Frank Butterman. Danny is a huge action movie fan and believes his new big-city partner might just be a real-life "[[Bad Boys (film)|bad boy]]," and his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he so longs for. Among the inhabitants of the tight-knit community that Angel meets during his first days in the village is Simon Skinner, the charming but sinister manager of the local [[Somerfield (UK retailer)|Somerfield]] supermarket. Soon, Angel manages to clear up some of the town's various misdemeanours that would usually go unnoticed, such as underage drinkers and a farmer who has been storing a huge supply of found weapons in his barn. Apart from those and other minor offences, such as trying (and failing) to capture an escaped [[swan]], no other significant crimes seem forthcoming on Angel's beat.  Faced with the reality of his situation and urged on by Danny, Angel and his new partner go out for drinks at the pub, and the two bond over action movies. 

However, as a series of grisly "accidents" rocks the village, committed by a tall cloaked and hooded individual. Angel is convinced that Sandford is not what it seems, but clashes with the other officers, in particular the two detectives on the force, who believe he's nothing more than an uptight city cop with an overactive imagination. Frank Butterman warns Nick not to become too obsessed with a case that could be a loose end, and explains that doing so caused Nick's predecessor, Sergeant Popwell (another cop transferred in from the Metropolitan police) to have a nervous breakdown. However, Nick refuses to drop the investigation, and when he witnesses the local florist murdered by the cloaked figure he chases him through the flower gardens, only to be outrun by the surprisingly athletic killer.

At first, Angel deduces that all of the victims were murdered for their involvement in a lucrative property deal regarding the florist's land. However, after he is assaulted in his hotel room by the cloaked murderer, who he discovers is the inbred trolley boy who works at Skinner's supermarket, and having followed directions from Skinner from the killer's walkie-talkie to the village castle, it soon becomes apparent that Frank Butterman and the Neighborhood Watch Alliance, intent on keeping Sandford's title of Village of the Year, have been murdering anyone who lessens the character of the village, claiming that it is for the "greater good". Butterman claims that losing the title years ago drove his wife to suicide, and orders the NWA to kill Angel. Angel flees, and in the process comes across the bodies of Sergeant Popwell, as well as the underage drinkers, the "living statue", other "problem" people whom Angel had encountered earlier, and Angel's bearded predecessor as Sergeant. Eventually Angel gets cornered by the NWA and is stabbed by Danny, who apparently knew about the scheme the whole time. After Danny drives Angel out of town he lets him out of the boot (revealing that he wasn't actually harmed - Danny had put a notepad in Angel's chest pocket) and tells him to take his car and leave. Danny also reveals that he didn't know about the bodies and that he thought the NWA was simply "a tap on the wrists" to wrongdoers, showing how Butterman has kept the real motives of the NWA a secret from his son.

Angel realizes he has to stop the insane NWA members, and drives back to the town, taking the load of weapons from the evidence lockup, and riding into the village on horseback. There, he meets with Danny, and the two roam the town, dispatching or disarming the members of the NWA in a series of frantic gun fights.  Partway through they are held up by Inspector Butterman and the rest of the Sandford Police Force, intent on arresting Angel; however, Angel and Danny are able to convince them of the truth about what is going on, despite Butterman's denials, and the rest of the force joins up with Danny and Angel to bring down Butterman and the NWA.  Eventually Danny and Angel separate from the rest, leaving the force to deal with the rest of the NWA in the supermarket while Danny and Angel get into a car chase with Skinner and Butterman.  They finally catch up with the two when they crash into a large model village. There, Angel defeats Skinner and arrests Butterman, who tries to drive away but crashes into a tree, as he is being attacked by the escapee-swan seen earlier in the film.

Later, as the crews are cleaning up the mess in the now-destroyed model village, Angel's old supervisors arrive from London. They ask Angel to return to the London force, having discovered that their crime statistics have risen since he has been gone, but Angel refuses, saying that he likes it in Sandford and he has a lot of paperwork to do.  Back at the station, the officer's celebrations (and paperwork) are interrupted by the only surviving member of the NWA who wasn't arrested, Tom Weaver, who tries to shoot Angel but instead hits Danny, who dives in the the way of the shot. Angel kicks a metal waste bin on Weaver's head, knocking him backwards into the evidence lock up where he accidentally sets off a confiscated sea mine, blowing up the station. A year later, Angel arrives at the cemetary, in front of a gravestone marked "Butterman". Angel asks if the flowers are okay, and Danny, having survived being shot, says the flowers are fine; they are actually at the gravesite of Danny's mother. Angel has been promoted to Inspector and Danny to Sergeant, and the film ends as they go back to working the beat together in Sandford.

Director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg spent eighteen months writing the script.<ref>{{cite web | author = Joe Utichi | title = Countryside Commandoes | publisher = Rotten Tomatoes | date = [[2007-02-13]] | url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/click/movie-1164807/reviews.php?rid=1598617 | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}</ref> During the latter half of 2005, [[Working Title Films|Working Title]] approached several towns in [[South West England]] looking for an appropriate filming location. Simon Pegg commented "We're both from the [[West Country]] so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in [[Frome]]".<ref name="culture">{{cite episode | title = Week Four 2007 | episodelink =  | series = The Culture Show | serieslink = The Culture Show | station = [[BBC 2]] | airdate = 2007-02-10}}</ref> 

[[Stow-on-the-Wold]] was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon [[Wells]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/search/display.var.874709.0.thank_god_we_did_screen_film_event.php|title=Thank God we did screen film event|date=[[2006-08-11]]|publisher=Cotswold Journal}}</ref> Edgar Wright's hometown. Wright has commented "and Wells is very picturesque [...] I love it but I also want to trash it".<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales] | episodelink =  | series = The Comedy Map of Britain | serieslink =  | credits =  | network = [[BBC 2]] | station = | city =  | airdate = 2007-02-03}}</ref>

Wright has said that it takes elements from his final amateur film "Dead Right" a film he described as both "''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' set in Somerset" and "a ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' film in Somerset".<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales] | episodelink =  | series = The Comedy Map of Britain | serieslink =  | credits =  | network = [[BBC 2]] | station = | city =  | airdate = 2007-02-03}}</ref>
He uses some of the same locations in both films including the [[Somerfield (UK retailer)|Somerfield]] supermarket, where he used to work as a shelf-stacker.<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales] | episodelink =  | series = The Comedy Map of Britain | serieslink =  | credits =  | network = [[BBC 2]] | station = | city =  | airdate = 2007-02-03}}</ref>

The film parodies clichés used in other action movies. On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies, Pegg has said "Men can't do that thing which is the greatest achievement of humankind which is to make another human so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into peoples heads [...] It's our turn to grab the gun by the hilt and fire it into your face."<ref name="culture">{{cite episode | title = Week Four 2007 | episodelink =  | series = The Culture Show | serieslink = The Culture Show | station = [[BBC 2]] | airdate = 2007-02-10}}</ref>. The Films Music was scored by David Arnold (well known for his recent Casino Royale music).

Filming commenced on [[March 19]], [[2006]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.workingtitlefilms.com/newsArticle.php?newsID=115 | title=Filming under way on Hot Fuzz | publisher=Working Title Films | date=[[2006-03-20]]}}</ref>, and lasted for 11 weeks.<ref name="channel4">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/apps26/film/reviews/film.jsp?section=indepth&id=159113&page=3|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}</ref> Throughout the filming process Pegg, Frost and Wright recorded a regular [[video blog]] which is available on the ''Hot Fuzz'' section of the Working Title website. Advanced screenings of the film took place on the [[14 February]] [[2007]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and was fully released on  [[16 February]] [[2007]]. The film is also due to have a limited release in the [[USA]] on [[20 April]] [[2007]]. The film carries a 15 certificate in the UK and is rated R in the US for violent content including some graphic images, and language.

==Box office and critical reception==
The film generated £7.1 million in its first weekend of release in UK cinema.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6379441.stm|title=Hot Fuzz heats up UK box office|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2007-02-20]]}}</ref>

Critically, the movie recieved generally positive reviews from critics, although slightly less than the critically-acclaimed ''Shaun of the Dead''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/shaun_of_the_dead/|title=Shaun of the Dead|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> It currently has a 75% fresh rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/hot_fuzz/|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> and 8.3 on [[IMDB]]. Olly Richards of ''Empire'' said of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost "After almost a decade together they’re clearly so comfortable in each other’s presence that they feel no need to fight for the punchline, making them terrific company for two hours".<ref>{{cite news | author = Olly Richards | title = Hot Fuzz | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | url = http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=10243 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> Derek Elley of ''Variety'' praised Broadbent and Dalton, "[who] are especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect."<ref>{{cite news | author = Derek Elley | title = Hot Fuzz | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2007-02-20]] | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932857.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>. Also. [[Mark Kermode]] said that 'I had my five laughs in the first 12 minutes' when reviewing the film on his BBC Radio Five Live Show

However, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' only gave ''Hot Fuzz'' 2/5, stating that "many of the jokes miss their target" as the film becomes more action-based.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/entertainment/movies/tm_headline=hot-fuzz%26method=full%26objectid=18621717%26siteid=89520-name_page.html|title=Hot Fuzz|work=[[Daily Mirror]]}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' also shared ''The Mirror'''s view, saying that "It's the lack of any serious intent that means too much of it is desperately unamusing, and unamusingly desperate".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/reviews.html?in_article_id=436569&in_page_id=1924|title=It aims.

==Cultural references==
{{spoiler}}
*Multiple nods to ''Shaun of the Dead'' are made, including the fence-based short cut ("What's the matter Danny? Never taken a short cut before?"), Cornetto requests, a pub slot machine jingle heard in the 'Winchester' and the fact that Nick Frost's character shoots someone in the leg with an air rifle. Nick Frost's character also hits the inbred trolley boy over the head with a jar in the same manner as he hits a zombie over the head with an ashtray in ''SOTD''. At one point in the film, Simon Pegg mentions the 'Blue Wrath of the MET police' a possible reference to 'The Blue Wrath' the name of the theme tune to SOTD. Most blatantly, the Spanish DVD release - with the somewhat absurd title of ''Zombies Party'' - is briefly seen in a supermarket bargain bin, with a price sticker covering Pegg's face.
*The plot bears certain similarities with that of the 1999 film ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', in which an over-eager big-city police officer is sent to a rural town as a way of keeping him 'out of the way', and eventually uncovers a series of related murders and a conspiracy involving the town elders.  It is unknown whether this similarity is intentional.
*Angel's plant, the Japanese Peace Lily and its symbolic value mimic those of Leon's potted plant in the [[Luc Besson]] film [[Leon]].
*The fictional town of Sandford is the name used by Centrex for their genuine police promotion exercises
*The Neighbourhood Watch Association, or NWA, is a reference to the [[N.W.A.|gangsta rap group of the same name]], which was also referenced in a deleted scene from ''Shaun of the Dead'' as Shaun and Ed's pub quiz team, the QWA (Quizzas With Attitude). Simon Pegg and Nick Frost actually used this name for their own pub quiz team.
*There are a number of references to ''[[Point Break]]'', most obviously, Danny Butterman's shooting of his gun in the air mimicking the clip of the film shown prior. More subtlety, in the final scene Angel says "the little hand says it's time to rock 'n' roll", a line spoken by Bodhi ([[Patrick Swayze]]) when the ex-presidents first rob a bank.
*When Angel enters the hotel and the woman says "You've always been here", this is a reference to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.
*The two Sergeant Turners played by [[Bill Bailey]] are seen reading books by [[Iain Banks]] and [[Iain M. Banks]]. This is a subtle reference to the fact that both authors are the same person, and is an early clue that Bailey is playing two characters.
*The scene where Angel and Danny are in the car discussing pedestrians as they walk past is a reference to the SOTD scene where Ed describes the Winchester's patrons.
*The scene in which Angel chases the purple tracksuited shoplifter down the high street is in reference to [[Trainspotting]].
*The scene in which Danny and Angel are walking down the street with a notepad is a reference to Episode 1.1 of Spaced where Tim and Daisy are doing the same thing.
*The manner of Sandford reporter Tim Messenger's death (by an object falling on him from a church roof) and the scene's encompassing Latin chant music are references to Father Brennan's death in ''[[The Omen]]''
*When Angel is woken at Dannys house by the phone ringing, ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' is playing on the TV and is up to the line 'This shit just got real'. Later after the Trolly Boy is sent to kill him, Sgt Angel rings Frank Butterman and says 'This shit just got real'. Another reference to Bad Boys II can be seen after the final fight when the helicopter passes over Danny and Angel in slow motion.
*[[Simon Pegg]] is a self confessed [[Star Wars]] fanatic and Hot Fuzz has several references to Star Wars, including a scene in which Jim Broadbent's police chief says "Sgt. Patterson once thought as you did" towards the end of the film, echoing [[Darth Vader]]'s line to Luke in reference to Obi-Wan thinking there was still good in him. Patterson also refers to children as [[Younglings]], the term for young [[Jedi]] apprentices in the [[Star Wars]] prequels. 
*When Butterman opens the boot of his car to release Angel the shot from the interior of the boot as it opens is a nod to an identical shot repeatedly employed by [[Quentin Tarantino]] in ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'', ''[[Jackie Brown]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' and ''[[Kill Bill]]''.
*The scene where Danny lets Angel out of the boot of the car has almost identical lighting to [[Goodfellas]] in addition to the idea of a body in the boot.
*The scene where Butterman hands the keys to his Volkswagen to Angel echoes the final scene in ''[[Chinatown]]'', complete with the line, "Forget it, Angel. It's Sandford".
*The scene where Angel uses the trolley boy's radio after knocking him out references ''[[Die Hard]]''.
*The scene where Angel is returning to Sandford in Butterman's car and puts on a pair of sunglasses is a reference to the opening scene of ''[[Mad Max]]''.
*Angel's collecting of guns from the evidence room a direct reference to Colonel John Matrix 'tooling-up' in the film ''[[Commando (film)|Commando]]''.<ref name="commando">{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/hotfuzz/|title=Hot Fuzz Feature|publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''}}</ref>
* The flock of pigeons which flies behind and around Angel in the market square references director [[John Woo]]'s trademark flocks of doves.
* The scene where Angel rides into town and asks the [[hoodies]] if they "Want to do something useful" is a reference to [[The Dark Knight Returns]].
*When Angel comes back to Sandford for the shootout and hands a shotgun to Danny, he says "Now thats what I'm talking about", this is a reference to [[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]] in which Will Smith's character says the same thing when Kay hands him his gun.
*The vicar's guns emerging from his sleeve in the third act appears to homage [[Equilibrium_(2002_film)|Equilibrium]].
*The pub landlord's incapacitation by bear trap is a direct homage to [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Straw Dogs]]''. One of the actors in the Sandford Theatre Company is also mentioned as having played "an extra in Straw Dogs". 
*In the supermarket Angel goes off to find [[Big Boss]], which is a reference to the Metal Gear series of videogames.
*The scene in which the car driven by Inspector Butterman smashes the door off Angel's car is a reference to the 1971 movie Get Carter.
*The final fight between Angel and Skinner is a homage to [[Superman 2]] when General Zod believes Superman to be weak and without his powers, only to have Superman grab Zod's fist and crush his hand, before throwing him backwards, just as Angel does to Skinner.
*During the final fight between Skinner and Angel, is a homage towards [[28 Days Later]], when Skinner trys to push Angels eyes in with his thumbs, in the same way Jim did against Major West.
*In the last fight scene between Angel and Skinner this is a reference to [[Lethal Weapon]]
*The fight in the model village is a direct homage to [[The Matrix Revolutions]] where Neo and Agent Smith fight in a rain drenched street, just as Angel and Skinner do. The punches thrown almost mimic Agent Smiths final demise.

==Trivia==
*Near the end of the film, Nicholas Angel actually refers to Danny as "Ed" [[Nick Frost]] played "Ed" in [[Shaun of the Dead]].
*Nicholas Angel's badge number is 777, the number often referred to as the "Mark of the Angel" and the opposite of 666.
*Danny asks Nicholas "D'you want anything from the shop?", to which he replies "Cornetto". This is a reference to Shaun of the Dead, when the exact same question and answer occurs, but with the roles reversed.
*At one point you can see the camera man in the glasses of Angel's forensic's girlfriend.
*[[Julia Deakin]] (Marsha from [[Spaced]]) makes a cameo appearance as Mary, the pub landlady
*Towards the beginning of the film, the locations used include the real Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track, with the familiar recruits residential tower blocks in the backdrop (use link to see aerial view of southern part of college and grounds).
*Near the end of the film when Danny and Angel are fighting the two owners of the pub, the blackboard beside the bar says 'two shooters for the price of one'.
*The Music Supervisor in Hot Fuzz is named Nick Angel, it is believed this is where the name of Pegg's character came from. Nick Angel was also the Music Supervisor in Shaun of the Dead.
*After being filmed in Wells, Somerset, it was necessary to edit the scenery. To make Sandford appear to be a small town, it was necessary to digitally remove Wells Cathedral from the skyline wherever it appeared.
*There's a scene where Danny and Angel discuss [[Lethal Weapon]], [[Stuart Wilson]] who plays Dr. Robin Hatcher plays the villain, Jack Travis, in Lethal Weapon 3.
*When Danny is looking at the DVDs in the bargain bin in the Somerfields supermarket, a copy of [[Shaun of the Dead]] (renamed Zombie Party but with the same cover art) can be seen.
*The stage production of Romeo and Juliet is clearly based on [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s modernised film version of the play apparent from the scenery, costumes, use of a gun and the closing music. 
*At one point, one of the understudies for the production of Romeo and Juliet is described as 'an extra in Straw Dogs'. [[Straw Dogs]], although a serious film, also focuses on a man's struggle to settle into a rural village.
*DS Andy Wainwright is played by [[Paddy Considine]] who plays the lead character in [[Dead Man's Shoes]]. This film's plot revolves around a man arriving in a rural town with a view to cleaning it up (although he goes about it in a considerably different manner)
*Many of the NWA members have surnames that are also ways of killing people (e.g. Skinner, Reaper, Shooter, Roper). It is unknown whether this is intentional.
