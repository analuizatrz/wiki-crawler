The '''Conn Smythe Trophy''' is awarded annually to the player judged most valuable to his team during the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Stanley Cup]] playoffs. The Conn Smythe Trophy has been awarded 42 times to 36 players since the [[1964-65 NHL season]]. Each year, at the conclusion of the final game of the Stanley Cup finals, members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association vote to elect the player deserving of the trophy.<ref name="nhl.com"/> The trophy is handed out prior to the presentation of the Stanley Cup by the [[NHL commissioner]].

==History==
The Conn Smythe Trophy was introduced in [[1964-65 NHL season|1964]] by the [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens Limited]] to honor [[Conn Smythe]], member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] as a builder, and the former owner, general manager, and coach of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].<ref name="nhl.com"/> The trophy's design is similar to the [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], the arena in which the Maple Leafs played their home games from 1931 to 1999.<ref name="hhof">{{cite web |title =Conn Smythe Trophy History|url =http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashconnsmythe.htm|publisher =[[Hockey Hall of Fame]]|accessdate =2007-08-17}}</ref>

The first winner of the award was [[Centre (ice hockey)|centre]] [[Jean Béliveau]] of the [[Montreal Canadiens]] for his performance in the [[1964-65 NHL season|1965]] Stanley Cup playoffs. The first player to win it twice was [[Bobby Orr]] in [[1971-72 NHL season|1972]]. [[Goaltender]] [[Bernie Parent]] and centres [[Wayne Gretzky]] and [[Mario Lemieux]] also won it twice, and [[Patrick Roy]] is the only player who has won it three times. Roy is also the only player to win the trophy for more than one team. The trophy has been won nine times by [[Montreal Canadiens]] players and four times by players from the [[Detroit Red Wings]], [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]], and [[New York Islanders]].

The trophy has been awarded to members of a losing team five times, the most recent being [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]] of the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in [[2002-03 NHL season|2003]], when his team lost to the [[New Jersey Devils]] in a seven-game series. The only non-goaltender to win the award in a losing cause is [[Philadelphia Flyers|Philadelphia]]'s [[Reggie Leach]], who won it in [[1975-76 NHL season|1976]] when the Canadiens swept his Flyers.

With two exceptions, the winners of the Conn Smythe Trophy have all been Canadian. The two non-Canadian winners are American [[Brian Leetch]], who won it in [[1993-94 NHL season|1994]], and Swede [[Nicklas Lidström|Nicklas Lidstrom]], who won it [[2001-02 NHL season|2002]].

Only three players have won the Conn Smythe Trophy and the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] for [[most valuable player]] during the regular season in the same year: [[Bobby Orr]] in [[1969-70 NHL season|1970]] and [[1971-72 NHL season|1972]], [[Guy Lafleur]] in [[1976-77 NHL season|1977]] and [[Wayne Gretzky]] in [[1984-85 NHL season|1985]].<ref name="nhl.com"/><ref name="hartnhl.com">{{cite web |title =Hart Memorial Trophy|url =http://www.nhl.com/trophies/hart.html|publisher =[[National Hockey League]]|accessdate =2007-08-17}}</ref>
