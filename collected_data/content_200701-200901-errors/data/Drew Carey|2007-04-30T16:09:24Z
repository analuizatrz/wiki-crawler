{{Main|The Drew Carey Show}}
After Carey gained sitcom writing experience, Carey and Helford then began to develop the storyline and co-produce ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''. The show first premiered on September 13, 1995 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] which featured Carey and [[Kathy Kinney]] in their previous characters. Carey played the assistant director of personnel at a department store in Cleveland, Ohio while Kinney played the obnoxious secretary (named Mimi) of Carey's boss. In his autobiography, he revealed his frustration with having to deal with [[censorship|censors]] and being unable to increase the usage of dirty humor which is prevalent in his stand-up comedy.<ref name="auto"/> Carey initially earned $60,000 per episode in the first seasons, then renegotiated for $250,000, and near the end of the show, he was earning $750,000 per episode.<ref name="IMDB News">{{cite web | title=IMDB News | work=News for Drew Carey | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004804/news | accessdate=December 9 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The show had high ratings for its first few seasons, and then declining ratings eventually resulted in the cancellation of the show. {{Fact|date=April 2007}} The program had a total of 233 episodes and lasted from 1995 to 2004 for nine complete seasons. Drew was the only character to appear in every episode.

A former [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] reservist, he adopted his [[crew cut]] hair style during his time in the service. Carey has had [[refractive surgery]] to correct his vision and therefore did not really require glasses (any glasses he wore in public were merely props to help the audience recognize him), however, whilst this was true for several years, on the May 17, 2006 episode of the ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]'' show he revealed that when he turned 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals.

==Writing==
[[Image: Drew Carey Book.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Cover of ''Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined'']]
Carey has a history of writing throughout his career including developing his stand-up comedy routines in his early stand-up career, and then moving on to assist in writing sitcoms. In 1997, Carey published his [[autobiography]], ''[[Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined]]'' where he shared memories of his early childhood and of his father's death when he was eight. He also revealed that he was once [[child sexual abuse|molested]], had suffered bouts of [[depression (mood)|depression]], and had made two attempts at suicide by swallowing a large amount of sleeping pills.<ref name=auto /> He also wrote of his [[Fraternities and sororities|college fraternity]] years while attending Kent State University, and of his professional career up to that time. The book featured large amounts of profanity and, as the title suggests, includes multiple dirty jokes (there was one at the start of each chapter) and references to beer. The book was featured on the New York Times bestseller list for three months.<ref name="ABC.com">{{cite web | title=ABC.com | work=Personnel Files-Drew Carey | url=http://abc.go.com/primetime/drewcarey/bios/drew_carey.html | accessdate=December 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Other==
At a time of high visibility on television during the 1990s, his resemblance to the ''[[Dilbert]]'' comic strip character did not go unnoticed. In one issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'', there was a cameo appearance by Dilbert saying Drew Carey was his favorite actor in part because of his obvious handsomeness.

==Personal life==
He's a fan of [[Apple Macintosh]] computers; there was an appearance of the PowerMac G4 cube on ''The Drew Carey Show''
===Political involvement===
Carey is also known for his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] leanings<ref name="Chicago Tribune">{{cite web | title=ChicagoTribune.com | work=Conservatives raise profile in liberal bastion Hollywood | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/chi-0410040266oct04,1,2145278.story?coll=chi-newsspecials-hed | accessdate=December 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and has expressed support for the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].<ref name="Advocates for Self-Government">{{cite web | title=Advocates for Self-Government | work=Drew Carey - Libertarian | url=http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/drew-carey.html | accessdate=December 8 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''The Drew Carey Show'' often presented a libertarian critique of [[political correctness]], [[regulation|government regulations]], [[racism]], [[sexism]], and [[homophobia]], with [[Plot (narrative)|storylines]] involving Carey's [[transvestism|cross-dressing]] brother, dating a [[bisexuality|bisexual]] woman (played by [[Illeana Douglas]]) for two episodes, ongoing criticism of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]'s exclusionary policy against [[Homosexuality|gay]] men, and support for [[same-sex marriage]].

Drew has spoken about his various political beliefs in several interviews and in 1998, he led a "smoke-in" in defiance of a no smoking
ordinance.<ref name="CNN.com">{{cite web | title=CNN.com | work=Drew Carey leads "smoke-in" to protest ban | url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9804/01/drew.carey/ | accessdate=December 8 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In a guest appearance on ''[[Blue Collar TV]]'', he said (presumably [[tongue-in-cheek]]) "That's why I'm a Republican" during one of the skits.

Since the show ended its nine-year run on ABC in 2004, however, Carey has clarified that he is more of a [[Conservatism|conservative]] with [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] leanings, and that he presented himself as a libertarian to avoid what some critics of the [[List of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry]] have characterized as a general [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] [[bias]] against conservatives.  On the [[August 18]], 2006 ''[[Penn Radio]]'' show with [[Penn Jillette]], Carey did however say he was indeed libertarian.

This joke perhaps illustrates his political views: "I don't believe there should be laws against drugs. I don't think the government has the right to limit the ways I can hurt myself!"

===Sports involvement===
Carey is known for being a devoted [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]] and [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] fan. When he promoted ''The Drew Carey Show'' in 1995, at the same time the Indians were making a miraculous run at the [[World Series]], he poked fun at the rest of baseball by saying, "Finally, it's ''your'' team that sucks!"<ref name="Everything2 2">{{cite web | title=Everything2.com | work=Cleveland Indians | url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Cleveland%20Indians | accessdate=December 8 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He also showed his support for the team by throwing the first pitch at an [[August 12]], 2006 Indians game against the [[Kansas City Royals|Royals]]. He was rewarded by the Cleveland Indians for being "the greatest Indians fan alive" with a personal [[bobblehead doll]] made in his likeness given to fans.<ref name="MLB">{{cite web | title=MLB.com/Cleveland Indians | work=August 12 vs. Kansas City | url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/cle/schedule/cle_schedule_promotions_popup.jsp?puid=2006_08_12_kcamlb_clemlb_2 | accessdate=December 5 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Carey responded to his bobblehead likeness by saying "Bobblehead Day, for me, is as big as getting a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame."<ref name="MLB.com">{{cite web | title=MLB.com | work=Indians 2006 Photo Gallery | url=http://www.mlb.com/cle/photogallery/year_2006/month_08/day_13/cf1608249.html | accessdate=December 5 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In 2001, Carey was the first TV star (as opposed to wrestler or athlete) to ever enter [[World Wrestling Federation's]]'s 30-man "[[Royal Rumble (2001)|Royal Rumble]]"  match which he entered to promote an improv comedy [[pay-per-view]] at the time. He appeared in a few backstage segments before his brief participation in the match; he eliminated himself by offering money to [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]] and then fleeing the ring.<ref name="WWF">{{cite web | title=gerweck.net | work=WWF PPV Results-Royal Rumble | url=http://www.gerweck.net/royalrumble01.htm | accessdate=December 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>
