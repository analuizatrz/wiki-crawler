'''Malaria''' is a vector-borne [[infectious disease]] that is widespread in [[Tropics|tropical]] and subtropical regions. It infects between 300 and 500 million people every year and causes between one and three million deaths annually, mostly among young children in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Malaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty, but is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to [[economic development]].

Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases and an enormous public-health problem. The disease is caused by [[protista|protozoan]] [[parasite]]s of the genus '''''[[Plasmodium]]'''''. The most serious forms of the disease are caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'', but other related species (''[[Plasmodium ovale]]'', ''[[Plasmodium malariae]]'', and sometimes ''[[Plasmodium knowlesi]]'') can also infect humans. This group of human-pathogenic ''Plasmodium'' species are usually referred to as ''malaria parasites''.

Malaria parasites are transmitted by female ''[[Anopheles]]'' [[mosquito]]es. The parasites multiply within [[red blood cell]]s, causing symptoms that include symptoms of [[anemia]] (light headedness, shortness of breath, tachycardia etc.), as well as other general symptoms such as [[fever]], [[chills]], [[influenza|flu-like illness]], and in severe cases, [[coma]] and death. Malaria transmission can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites with [[mosquito net]]s and [[insect repellent]]s, or by mosquito control by spraying [[insecticide]]s inside houses and draining standing water where mosquitoes lay their eggs.

Unfortunately, no [[vaccine]] is currently available for malaria. Instead preventative drugs must be taken continuously to reduce the risk of infection. These [[Prophylaxis|prophylactic]] drug treatments are simply too expensive for most people living in endemic areas. Malaria infections are treated through the use of [[antimalarial drug]]s, such as [[chloroquine]] or [[pyrimethamine]], although [[drug resistance]] is increasingly common.

Scientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880, when a French army doctor working in [[Algeria]] named [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]] observed parasites inside the [[red blood cell]]s of people suffering from malaria. He therefore proposed that malaria was caused by this [[protozoa]]n, the first time protozoa were identified as causing disease.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1907/laveran-bio.html Biography of Alphonse Laveran] Nobel foundation. Accessed 25 Oct 2006</ref> For this and later discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]]. The protozoan was called ''Plasmodium'' by the Italian scientists [[Ettore Marchiafava]] and [[Angelo Celli]].<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2478.html Ettore Marchiafava] at http://www.whonamedit.com/ Accessed 6 Nov 2006</ref> A year later, [[Carlos Finlay]], a Cuban doctor treating patients with [[yellow fever]] in [[Havana]], first suggested that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to humans.  However, it was Britain's [[Ronald Ross|Sir Ronald Ross]] working in [[India]] who finally proved in 1898 that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes. He did this by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds and isolating malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1902/ross-bio.html Biography of Ronald Ross] Nobel foundation. Accessed 25 Oct 2006</ref> For this work Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly-established [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]] and directed malaria-control efforts in [[Egypt]], [[Panama]], [[Greece]] and [[Mauritius]].<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/ross.htm Ross and the Discovery that Mosquitoes Transmit Malaria Parasites] CDC Malaria website. Accessed 25 Oct 2006</ref> The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by [[Walter Reed]] in 1900, and its recommendations implemented by [[William C. Gorgas]] in [[Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal|the health measures undertaken]] during construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against this disease.

The first effective treatment for malaria was the bark of [[Cinchona|cinchona tree]], which contains [[quinine]]. This tree grows on the slopes of the [[Andes]], mainly in [[Peru]]. This natural product was used by the inhabitants of [[Peru]] to control malaria, and the [[Jesuit]]s introduced this practice to Europe during the 1640s where it was rapidly accepted.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kaufman T, Rúveda E | title = The quest for quinine: those who won the battles and those who won the war. | journal = Angew Chem Int Ed Engl | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 854-85 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15669029}}</ref> However, it was not until [[1820]] that the active ingredient quinine was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by the French chemists [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier]] and [[Joseph Caventou]].

In the early twentieth century, before [[antibiotics]], patients with [[syphilis]] were intentionally [[infected]] with malaria to create a [[fever]]. By accurately controlling the fever with [[quinine]], the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. Although some patients died from malaria, this was preferable than the almost-certain death from syphilis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Raju T | title = Hot brains: manipulating body heat to save the brain. | url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/117/2/e320 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = e320-1 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16452338}}</ref>

Although the blood stage and mosquito stages of the malaria life cycle were established in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was not until the 1980s that the latent liver form of the parasite was observed.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Krotoski W, Collins W, Bray R, Garnham P, Cogswell F, Gwadz R, Killick-Kendrick R, Wolf R, Sinden R, Koontz L, Stanfill P | title = Demonstration of hypnozoites in sporozoite-transmitted Plasmodium vivax infection. | journal = Am J Trop Med Hyg | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 1291-3 | year = 1982 | id = PMID 6816080}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Meis J, Verhave J, Jap P, Sinden R, Meuwissen J | title = Malaria parasites--discovery of the early liver form. | journal = Nature | volume = 302 | issue = 5907 | pages = 424-6 | year =1983 | id = PMID 6339945}}</ref> The discovery of this latent form of the parasite finally explained why people could appear to be cured of malaria but still relapse years after the parasite had disappeared from their bloodstreams.

Malaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty, but is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to [[economic development]]. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. A comparison of average per capita GDP in 1995, adjusted to give parity of purchasing power, between malarious and non-malarious countries demonstrates a fivefold difference (US$1,526 versus US$8,268).  Moreover, in countries where malaria is common, average per capita GDP has risen (between 1965 and 1990) only 0.4% per year, compared to 2.4% per year in other countries.<ref name="sachs2002">{{cite journal | author=Sachs J, Malaney P | title=The economic and social burden of malaria | journal=Nature | year=2002 | volume=415 | pages=680-5  | id=PMID 11832956}}</ref> In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12 billion every year.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of malaria include [[fever]], [[shivering]], [[arthralgia]] (joint pain), [[vomiting]], [[anemia]] caused by [[hemolysis]], [[hemoglobinuria]], and [[convulsion]]s. There may be the feeling of tingling in the skin, particularly with malaria caused by ''P. falciparum''. The classical symptom of malaria is cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by rigor and then fever and sweating lasting four to six hours, occurring every two days in ''P. falciparum'', ''P. vivax'' and ''P. ovale'' infections, while every three for ''P. malariae''.<ref name=RBMarmenia>[http://www.malaria.am/eng/pathogenesis.php Malaria life cycle & pathogenesis].

Chronic malaria is seen in both ''P. vivax'' and ''P. ovale'', but not in ''P. falciparum''. Here, the disease can relapse months or years after exposure, due to the presence of latent parasites in the liver. Describing a case of malaria as cured by observing the disappearance of parasites from the bloodstream can therefore be deceptive. The longest incubation period reported for a ''P. vivax'' infection is 30 years.<ref name=Trampuz/> Approximately one in five of ''P. vivax'' malaria cases in [[temperate]] areas involve overwintering by hypnozoites (i.e., relapses begin the year after the mosquito bite).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Adak T, Sharma V, Orlov V | title = Studies on the Plasmodium vivax relapse pattern in Delhi, India. | journal = Am J Trop Med Hyg | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 175-9 | year = 1998 | id = PMID 9684649}}</ref>

==Causes==
[[Image:Malaria.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A ''Plasmodium'' sporozoite traverses the cytoplasm of a mosquito midgut epithelial cell in this false-color [[electron micrograph]].]]

== Malaria parasites ==

Malaria is caused by [[protozoa]]n [[parasite]]s of the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]'' (phylum [[Apicomplexa]]). In humans malaria is caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum|P. falciparum]]'', ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P. malariae]]'', ''[[Plasmodium ovale|P. ovale]]'', and ''[[Plasmodium vivax|P. vivax]]''. However, ''P. falciparum'' is the most important cause of disease and responsible for about 80% of infections and 90% of deaths.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mendis K, Sina B, Marchesini P, Carter R | title = The neglected burden of Plasmodium vivax malaria. | url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/reprint/64/1_suppl/97.pdf | journal = Am J Trop Med Hyg | volume = 64 | issue = 1-2 Suppl | pages = 97-106 | year = | id = PMID 11425182}}</ref> Parasitic ''Plasmodium'' species also infect birds, reptiles, monkeys, chimpanzees and rodents.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Escalante A, Ayala F | title = Phylogeny of the malarial genus Plasmodium, derived from rRNA gene sequences. | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/91/24/11373 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 91 | issue = 24 | pages = 11373-7 | year = 1994 | id = PMID 7972067}}</ref> There have been documented human infections with several [[Wiktionary:simian|simian]] species of malaria, namely ''[[Plasmodium knowlesi|P. knowlesi]]'', ''[[Plasmodium inui|P. inui]]'', ''[[Plasmodium cynomolgi|P. cynomolgi]]''<ref>{{cite book | last=Garnham | first=PCC | date=1966 | title=Malaria parasites and other haemosporidia | publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|Location=Oxford }}</ref>, ''[[Plasmodium simiovale|P. simiovale]]'', ''[[P. brazilianum]]'', ''[[P. schwetzi]]'' and ''[[P. simium]]''; however these are mostly of limited public health importance.

== Mosquito vectors and the ''Plasmodium'' life cycle ==

The parasite's primary (definitive) hosts and transmission [[vector (biology)|vector]]s are female [[mosquito]]es of the ''[[Anopheles]]'' genus. Young mosquitoes first ingest the malaria parasite by feeding on an infected human carrier and the infected ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes carry ''Plasmodium'' [[sporozoite]]s in their [[salivary gland]]s. A mosquito becomes infected when it takes a blood meal from an infected human. Once ingested, the parasite [[gametocytes]] taken up in the blood will further differentiate into male or female [[gametes]] and then fuse in the mosquito gut. This produces an [[ookinete]] that penetrates the gut lining and produces an [[oocyst]] in the gut wall. When the oocyst ruptures, it releases [[sporozoites]] that migrate through the mosquito's body to the salivary glands, where they are then ready to infect a new human host.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Talman A, Domarle O, McKenzie F, Ariey F, Robert V | title = Gametocytogenesis: the puberty of Plasmodium falciparum. | journal = Malar J | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 24 | year = | id = PMID 15253774}}</ref> The sporozoites are injected into the skin, alongside saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.

Only female mosquitoes feed on blood, thus males do not transmit the disease. The females of the ''[[Anopheles]]'' genus of mosquito prefer to feed at night.  They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and will continue throughout the night until taking a meal. Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by [[blood transfusion]]s, although this is rare.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Marcucci C, Madjdpour C, Spahn D | title = Allogeneic blood transfusions: benefit, risks and clinical indications in countries with a low or high human development index. | journal = Br Med Bull | volume = 70 | issue = | pages = 15-28 | year = | id = PMID 15339855}}</ref>

== Pathogenesis ==
[[Image:MalariacycleBig.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The life cycle of malaria parasites in the human body. The various stages in this process are discussed in the text.]]

Malaria in humans develops via two phases: an exoerythrocytic (hepatic) and an erythrocytic phase. When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, [[sporozoite]]s in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the [[liver]]. Within 30 minutes of being introduced into the human host, they infect [[hepatocyte]]s, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 6&ndash;15 days. During this so-called dormant time in the liver the sporozoites are often referred to as hypnozoites.  In the liver they differentiate to yield thousands of [[merozoite]]s which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect [[red blood cell]]s, thus beginning the erythrocytic stage of its life cycle.<ref>[http://www.sma.org/pdfs/objecttypes/smj/91C48D32-BCD4-FF25-565C69314AF7EB48/1196.pdf Bledsoe, G. H. (December 2005) "Malaria primer for clinicians in the United States"  ''Southern Medical Journal'' 98(12): pp. 1197-204, (PMID: 16440920)];</ref> The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell.<ref name="sturm2006">{{cite journal | author=Sturm A, 
Amino R, van de Sand C, Regen T, Retzlaff S, Rennenberg A, Krueger A, Pollok JM, Menard R, Heussler VT | title=Manipulation of host hepatocytes by the malaria parasite for delivery into liver sinusoids | journal=Science | year=2006 | volume=313 | pages=1287-1490  | id=PMID 16888102}}</ref>
   
Within the red blood cells the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their hosts to invade fresh red blood cells. Several of such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.

Some ''P. vivax'' and ''P. ovale'' sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (6&ndash;12 months is typical) to as long as three years. After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in these two species of malaria.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cogswell F | title = The hypnozoite and relapse in primate malaria. | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=358221&blobtype=pdf | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 26-35 | year = 1992 | id = PMID 1735093}}</ref>

The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body's [[immune system]] because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance.  However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the [[spleen]]. To avoid this fate, the ''P. falciparum'' parasite displays adhesive [[protein]]s on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.<ref name=Chen>{{cite journal | author = Chen Q, Schlichtherle M, Wahlgren M | title = Molecular aspects of severe malaria. | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=10885986 | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 439-50 | year = 2000 | id = PMID 10885986}}</ref>  This "stickiness"  is the main factor giving rise to [[hemorrhage|hemorrhagic]] complications of malaria. [[High endothelial venules]] (the smallest branches of the circulatory system) can be blocked by the attachment of masses of these infected red blood cells. The blockage of these vessels causes symptoms such as in placental and cerebral malaria. In cerebral malaria the sequestrated red blood cells can breach the [[blood-brain barrier|blood brain barrier]] possibly leading to coma.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Adams S, Brown H, Turner G | title = Breaking down the blood-brain barrier: signaling a path to cerebral malaria? | journal = Trends Parasitol | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 360-6 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 12377286}}</ref>

Although the red blood cell surface adhesive proteins (called PfEMP1, for ''Plasmodium falciparum'' erythrocyte membrane protein 1) are exposed to the immune system they do not serve as good immune targets because of their extreme diversity; there are at least 60 variations of the protein within a single parasite and perhaps limitless versions within parasite populations.<ref name=Chen/>  Like a thief changing disguises or a spy with multiple passports, the parasite switches between a broad repertoire of PfEMP1 surface proteins, thus staying one step ahead of the pursuing immune system.  

Some merozoites turn into male and female [[gametocyte]]s. If a mosquito pierces the skin of an infected person, it potentially picks up gametocytes within the blood. Fertilization and sexual recombination of the parasite occurs in the mosquito's gut, thereby defining the mosquito as the [[definitive host]] of the disease. New sporozoites develop and travel to the mosquito's salivary gland, completing the cycle. Pregnant women are especially attractive to the mosquitoes,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lindsay S, Ansell J, Selman C, Cox V, Hamilton K, Walraven G | title = Effect of pregnancy on exposure to malaria mosquitoes. | journal = Lancet | volume = 355 | issue = 9219 | pages = 1972 | year = 2000 | id = PMID 10859048}}</ref> and malaria in pregnant women is an important cause of [[stillbirth]]s, infant mortality and low birth weight.<ref>{{cite journal | author = van Geertruyden J, Thomas F, Erhart A, D'Alessandro U | title = The contribution of malaria in pregnancy to perinatal mortality. | url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/full/71/2_suppl/35 | journal = Am J Trop Med Hyg | volume = 71 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 35-40 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15331817}}</ref>

==Evolutionary pressure of malaria on human genes==
{{further|[[Evolution]], [[Natural selection]]}}
Malaria is thought to have been the greatest [[selection|selective pressure]] on the [[human genome]] in recent history.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kwiatkowski, DP | title=How Malaria Has Affected the Human Genome and What Human Genetics Can Teach Us about Malaria | journal=Am J Hum Genet | year=2005 | volume=77 | pages=171-92 |id=PMID 16001361}}</ref> This is due to the high levels of [[mortality]] and [[morbidity]] caused by malaria, especially the ''[[Plasmodium falciparum|P. falciparum]]'' species.

===Sickle-cell anemia===
The best-studied influence of the malaria [[parasite]] upon the human genome is the blood disease, [[sickle-cell anaemia]]. In sickle-cell anaemia, there is a mutation in the HBB gene which codes for a [[haemoglobin]] subunit. The normal [[allele]] is HbA, but the sickle-cell allele, HbS, has a [[mutation]] from [[Glutamic Acid]] to [[Valine]] at [[amino acid]] 6. This change from a [[hydrophilic]] to a [[hydrophobic]] residue encourages binding between [[haemoglobin]] molecules, with [[polymerization]] of haemoglobin deforming [[red blood cells]] into a [[sickle]] shape.

Individuals [[homozygous]] for HbS have full sickle-cell anaemia and rarely live beyond [[adolescence]]. However, this allele has sustained [[gene frequencies]] in populations where malaria is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] of around 10%. This is because individuals [[heterozygous]] for the mutated allele (HbA/HbS), known as Sickle-cell trait, have a low level of [[anaemia]] but also have a greatly reduced chance of malaria infection. The existence of four [[haplotypes]] of HbS suggests that this mutation has emerged independently at least four times in malaria-endemic areas, further demonstrating its evolutionary advantage in such affected regions.

There are also other mutations of the HBB [[gene]] which appear to confer similar resistance to malaria infection. These are HbE and HbC which are common in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Western Africa]] respectively.

===Thalassaemias===
Another well documented set of mutations found in the human genome associated with malaria are those involved in causing blood disorders known as [[thalassaemias]]. Studies in [[Sardinia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]] have found that the [[gene frequency]] of [[Thalassemia#Beta (β) thalassemias|β-thalassaemias]] is related to the level of malarial endemicity in a given population. A study on more than 500 children in [[Liberia]] found that those with β-thalassaemia had a 50% decreased chance of getting clinical malaria. Similar studies have found links between gene frequency and malaria endemicity in the α+ form of α-thalassaemia.

===Duffy antigens===
The [[Duffy antigen]]s are [[antigens]] expressed on red blood cells and other cells in the body acting as a [[chemokine]] receptor. The expression of Duffy antigens on blood cells is encoded by Fy genes (Fya, Fyb, Fyc etc.). ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' malaria uses the Duffy antigen to enter blood cells. However, it is possible to express no Duffy antigen on red blood cells (Fy-/Fy-). This [[genotype]] confers complete resistance to ''P. vivax'' infection. The genotype has not been found in Chinese populations, has rarely been found in white populations, but is found in 68% of black people. This is thought to be due to very high exposure to ''P. vivax'' in [[Africa]] in the past.

===G6PD===
[[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (G6PD) is an [[enzyme]] which normally protects from the effects of [[oxidative stress]] in red blood cells. However, a genetic deficiency in this enzyme results in increased protection against severe malaria.

===HLA===
[[Human_leukocyte_antigen|HLA-B53]] is associated with low risk of severe malaria. This [[Major_histocompatibility_complex|MHC class I]] molecule presents [[liver]] stage and [[sporozoite]] [[antigens]] to [[T-Cells]].

== Diagnosis ==
{{further|[[Blood film]]}}
[[Image:Plasmodium_falciparum_02.jpg|thumb|280px|Blood smear from a ''P. falciparum'' [[Malaria culture|culture]] (K1 strain). Several red blood cells have ring stages inside them. Close to the center there is a schizont and on the left a trophozoite.]]

The preferred and most reliable diagnosis of malaria is microscopic examination of [[blood film]]s because each of the four major parasite species has distinguishing characteristics.  Two sorts of blood film are traditionally used.  Thin films are similar to usual blood films and allow species identification because the parasite's appearance is best preserved in this preparation.  Thick films allow the microscopist to screen a larger volume of blood and are about eleven times more sensitive than the thin film, so picking up low levels of infection is easier on the thick film, but the appearance of the parasite is much more distorted and therefore distinguishing between the different species can be much more difficult.<ref name="warhurst1996">{{cite journal | author=Warhurst DC, Williams JE | title=Laboratory diagnosis of malaria | journal=J Clin Pathol | year=1996 | volume=49 | pages=533–38 |id=PMID 8813948}}</ref>

From the thick film, an experienced microscopist can detect parasite levels (or [[parasitemia]]) down to as low as 0.0000001% of red blood cells.   Microscopic diagnosis can be difficult because the early trophozoites ("ring form") of all four species look identical and it is never possible to diagnose species on the basis of a single ring form; species identification is always based on several trophozoites.  Please refer to the articles on each parasite for their microscopic appearances: ''[[Plasmodium falciparum|P. falciparum]], [[Plasmodium vivax|P. vivax]], [[Plasmodium ovale|P. ovale]], [[Plasmodium malariae|P. malariae]]''.  

In areas where microscopy is not available, there are [[antigen]] detection tests that require only a drop of blood.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Pattanasin S, Proux S, Chompasuk D, Luwiradaj K, Jacquier P, Looareesuwan S, Nosten F | title=Evaluation of a new Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase assay (OptiMAL-IT®) for the detection of malaria | journal=Transact Royal Soc Trop Med | year=2003 | volume=97 | pages=672–4  | id=PMID 16117960}}</ref>  OptiMAL-IT® will reliably detect ''falciparum'' down to 0.01% [[parasitemia]] and non-''falciparum'' down to 0.1%.  ''Para''check-Pf® will detect parasitemias down to 0.002% but will not distinguish between ''falciparum'' and non-''falciparum'' malaria.  Parasite nucleic acids are detected using [[polymerase chain reaction]]. This technique is more accurate than microscopy. However, it is expensive, and requires a specialized laboratory.  Moreover, levels of parasitemia are not necessarily correlative with the progression of disease, particularly when the parasite is able to adhere to blood vessel walls.  Therefore more sensitive, low-tech diagnosis tools need to be developed in order to detect low levels of parasitaemia in the field.

Molecular methods are available in some clinical laboratories and rapid real-time assays (for example, [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|QT-NASBA]] based on the polymerase chain reaction)<ref>{{cite journal | title=Detection and identification of human Plasmodium species with real-time quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification | author=Mens PF, Schoone GJ, Kager PA, Schallig HDFH. | journal=Malaria Journal | year=2006 | volume=5 | issue=80 | doi=10.1186/1475-2875-5-80 }}</ref> are being developed with the hope of being able to deploy them in endemic areas.

Severe malaria is commonly misdiagnosed in [[Africa]], leading to a failure to treat other life-threatening illnesses. In malaria-endemic areas, [[parasitemia]] does not ensure a diagnosis of severe malaria because parasitemia can be incidental to other concurrent disease. Recent investigations suggest that malarial [[retinopathy]] is better (collective sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90%) than any other clinical or laboratory feature in distinguishing malarial from non-malarial [[coma]].<ref> Beare NA et al. ''Am J Trop Med Hyg.'' 2006 Nov;75(5):790-797.</ref>

== Treatment ==

Active malaria infection with ''P. falciparum'' is a [[medical emergency]] requiring [[Hospital|hospitalization]]. Infection with ''P. vivax'', ''P. ovale'' or ''P. malariae'' can often be treated as outpatients. Treatment of malaria involves supportive measures as well as specific antimalarial drugs. When properly treated, someone with malaria can be completely cured.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/faq.htm#treatment If I get malaria, will I have it for the rest of my life?] CDC publication, Accessed 14 Nov 2006</ref>

===Antimalarial drugs===

{{further|[[Antimalarial drug]]s}}
There are several families of drugs used to treat malaria. As it was very cheap and effective, [[chloroquine]] was the antimalarial drug of choice for many years in most parts of the world. However, resistance of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' to chloroquine has spread recently from Asia to Africa, making the drug ineffective against the most dangerous Plasmodium strain in many affected regions of the world. In those areas where chloroquine is still effective it remains the first choice.  Unfortunately, chloroquine-resistance is associated with reduced sensitivity to other drugs such as [[quinine]] and [[amodiaquine]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Tinto H, Rwagacondo C, Karema C, ''et al.'' | title=In-vitro susceptibility of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' to monodesethylamodiaquine, dihydroartemsinin and quinine in an area of high chloroquine resistance in Rwanda | journal=Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg | volume=100 | issue=6 | pages=509&ndash;14 | doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.09.018 }}</ref>

There are several other substances which are used for treatment and, partially, for prevention (prophylaxis). Many drugs can be used for both purposes; larger doses are used to treat cases of malaria. Their deployment depends mainly on the frequency of resistant parasites in the area where the drug is used. One drug [[As of 2007|currently]] being investigated for possible use as an anti-malarial, especially for treatment of drug-resistant strains, is the [[beta blocker]] [[propranolol]]. Propranolol has been shown to block ''Plasmodium'''s ability to gain access to the red blood cell "password system" and thus join with and engulf the cell, infecting it. A December 2006 study by [[Northwestern University]] researchers suggested that propranolol may reduce the dosages required for existing drugs to be effective against ''P. falciparum'' by 5- to 10-fold, suggesting a role in combination therapies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murphy S, Harrison T, Hamm H, Lomasney J, Mohandas N, Haldar K |title=Erythrocyte G protein as a novel target for malarial chemotherapy |journal=PLoS Med |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=e528 |year=2006 | month=Dec | id=PMID 17194200 | url=http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030528}}</ref>

The development of drugs was facilitated when ''Plasmodium falciparum'' was successfully [[Malaria culture|cultured]].<ref name="Trager1976">{{cite journal | author= Trager W, Jensen JB.| title=Human malaria parasites in continuous culture | journal=Science| year=1976| volume=193(4254)| pages=673-5  | id=PMID 781840}}</ref> This allowed in vitro testing of new drug candidates.

Extracts of the plant ''[[Artemisia annua]]'', containing the compound [[artemisinin]] or semi-synthetic derivatives (a substance unrelated to quinine), offer over 90% efficacy rates, but their supply is not meeting demand.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Senior K | title = Shortfall in front-line antimalarial drug likely in 2005. | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 75 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15702504}}</ref> Since 2001 the [[World Health Organization]] has recommended using [[artemisinin]]-based combination therapy (ACT) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in areas experiencing resistance to older medications. The most recent [[WHO]] [http://www.who.int/malaria/docs/TreatmentGuidelines2006.pdf treatment guidelines for malaria] recommend four different ACTs. While numerous countries, including most African nations, have adopted the change in their official malaria treatment policies, cost remains a major barrier to ACT implementation. Because ACTs cost up to twenty times as much as older medications, they remain unaffordable in many malaria-endemic countries. The molecular target of artemisinin is controversial, although recent studies suggest that [[SERCA]], a calcium pump in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] may be associated with artemisinin resistance.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eckstein-Ludwig U, Webb R, Van Goethem I, East J, Lee A, Kimura M, O'Neill P, Bray P, Ward S, Krishna S | title = Artemisinins target the SERCA of Plasmodium falciparum. | journal = Nature | volume = 424 | issue = 6951 | pages = 957-61 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12931192}}</ref> Malaria parasites can develop resistance to artemisinin and resistance can be produced by mutation of SERCA.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Uhlemann A, Cameron A, Eckstein-Ludwig U, Fischbarg J, Iserovich P, Zuniga F, East M, Lee A, Brady L, Haynes R, Krishna S | title = A single amino acid residue may determine the sensitivity of SER`CAs to artemisinins. | journal = Nat Struct Mol Biol | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 628-9 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15937493}}</ref> However, other studies suggest the mitochondria is the major target for artemisinin and its analogs.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Li W, Mo W, Shen D, Sun L, Wang J, Lu S, Gitschier J, Zhou B | title = Yeast model uncovers dual roles of mitochondria in action of artemisinin. | journal = PLoS Genet | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = e36 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 16170412}}</ref>

Although effective anti-malarial drugs are on the market, the disease remains a threat to people living in endemic areas who have no proper and prompt access to effective drugs. Access to pharmacies and health facilities, as well as drug costs, are major obstacles. [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] estimates that the cost of treating a malaria-infected person in an endemic country is between [[United States dollar|US$]]0.25 and $2.40.<ref name="msf">Medecins Sans Frontieres, "[http://www.msf.org/content/page.cfm?articleid=44247857-6A39-4D9C-8FA7E54299FF1D4D What is the Cost and Who Will Pay?]"</ref>

==Prevention and disease control==
{{further|[[Mosquito control]]}}
[[image:Anopheles albimanus mosquito.jpg|400px|thumb|''[[Anopheles]] albimanus'' mosquito feeding on a human arm. This mosquito is a vector of malaria and mosquito control is a very effective way of reducing the incidence of malaria.]]

Methods used to prevent the spread of disease, or to protect individuals in areas where malaria is endemic, include prophylactic drugs, mosquito eradication, and the prevention of mosquito bites.  There is currently no [[vaccination|vaccine]] that will prevent malaria, but this is an active field of research.  

Many researchers argue that prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the capital costs required are out of reach of many of the world's poorest people.  Economic adviser [[Jeffrey Sachs]] estimates that malaria can be controlled for US$3 billion in aid per year.  It has been argued that, in order to meet the [[Millennium Development Goals]], money should be redirected from [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] treatment to malaria prevention, which for the same amount of money would provide greater benefit to African economies.<ref name="hull2006">[http://www.wgbh.org:81/cgi-bin/nph-algs.cgi/000000A/http/www.wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=2682027&episode_id=2682029 Hull, Kevin. (2006) "Malaria: Fever Wars". PBS Documentary]</ref>

Efforts to eradicate malaria by eliminating mosquitoes have been successful in some areas.  Malaria was once common in the [[United States]] and southern [[Europe]], but the draining of wetland breeding grounds and better sanitation, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from affluent regions.  In 2002, there were 1,059 cases of malaria reported in the US, including eight deaths.  In five of those cases, the disease was contracted in the United States.  Malaria was eliminated from the northern parts of the USA in the early twentieth century, and the use of the [[pesticide]] [[DDT]] eliminated it from the South by 1951.  In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a major public health effort to eradicate malaria worldwide by selectively targeting mosquitoes in areas where malaria was rampant.<ref>{{cite news | author=Gladwell, Malcolm.|date=[[2001-07-02]] | title=The Mosquito Killer | url=http://www.gladwell.com/2001/2001_07_02_a_ddt.htm | publisher=The New Yorker}}</ref> However, these efforts have so far failed to eradicate malaria in many parts of the developing world - the problem is most prevalent in Africa. 

Brazil, Eritrea, India, and Vietnam have, unlike many other developing nations, successfully reduced the malaria burden. Common success factors included conducive country conditions, a targeted technical approach using a package of effective tools, data-driven decision-making, active leadership at all levels of government, involvement of communities, decentralized implementation and control of finances, skilled technical and managerial capacity at national and sub-national levels, hands-on technical and programmatic support from partner agencies, and sufficient and flexible financing.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Barat L | title = Four malaria success stories: how malaria burden was successfully reduced in Brazil, Eritrea, India, and Vietnam. | journal = Am J Trop Med Hyg | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 12-6 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16407339}}</ref>

===Prophylactic drugs===
{{Main|Malaria prophylaxis}}

Several drugs, most of which are also used for treatment of malaria, can be taken preventively.  Generally, these drugs are taken daily or weekly, at a lower dose than would be used for treatment of a person who had actually contracted the disease. Use of prophylactic drugs is seldom practical for full-time residents of malaria-endemic areas, and their use is usually restricted to short-term visitors and travelers to malarial regions. This is due to the cost of purchasing the drugs, negative [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]]s from long-term use, and because some effective anti-malarial drugs are difficult to obtain outside of wealthy nations.

[[Quinine]] was used starting in the [[seventeenth century]] as a prophylactic against malaria.  The development of more effective alternatives such as [[quinacrine]], [[chloroquine]], and [[primaquine]] in the twentieth century reduced the reliance on quinine.  Today, quinine is still used to treat [[chloroquine]] resistant ''Plasmodium falciparum'', as well as severe and cerebral stages of malaria, but is not generally used for prophylaxis. 

Modern drugs used preventively include [[mefloquine]] ('''Lariam®'''), [[doxycycline]] (available generically), and the combination of [[atovaquone]] and [[proguanil]] hydrochloride ('''Malarone®'''). The choice of which drug to use depends on which drugs the parasites in the area are [[drug resistance|resistant]] to, as well as side-effects and other considerations. The prophylactic effect does not begin immediately upon starting taking the drugs, so people temporarily visiting malaria-endemic areas usually begin taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and must continue taking them for 4 weeks after leaving (with the exception of atovaquone proguanil that only needs be started 2 days prior and continued for 7 days afterwards).

===Indoor residual spraying===
[[DDT]] was developed as the first of the modern [[insecticide]]s early in [[World War II]].  While it was initially used to combat malaria, its use spread to [[agriculture]] where it was used to eliminate insect pests.  In time, pest-control, rather than disease-control, came to dominate DDT use, particularly in the developed world.  During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, and ultimately led to bans in many countries in the 1970s.  By this time, its large-scale use had already led to the [[evolution]] of resistant mosquitoes in many regions.

However, given the continuing toll to malaria, particularly in developing countries, there is considerable controversy regarding the restrictions placed on the use of DDT.  Some advocates claim that bans are responsible for tens of millions of deaths in tropical countries where previously DDT was effective in controlling malaria.  Furthermore, most of the problems associated with DDT use stem specifically from its industrial-scale application in agriculture, rather than its use in [[public health]].

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) currently advises the use of DDT to combat malaria in endemic areas.<ref>{{cite web | title=WHO frequently asked questions on DDT use for disease vector control | url=http://www.who.int/malaria/docs/FAQonDDT.pdf | format=PDF|publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]]}}</ref>  For instance, DDT-spraying the interior walls of living spaces, where mosquitoes land, is an effective control.  The WHO also recommends a series of alternative insecticides to both combat malaria in areas where mosquitoes are DDT-resistant, and to slow the evolution of resistance.  This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the [[Stockholm Convention]] on [[persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs), which prohibits the agricultural use of DDT for large-scale field spraying.<ref>[http://www.who.int/malaria/docs/10thingsonDDT.pdf 10 Things You Need to Know about DDT Use under The Stockholm Convention]</ref>  However, because of its legacy, many developed countries discourage DDT use even in small quantities.<ref>[http://www.pops.int/ The Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants]</ref>

===Mosquito nets and bedclothes===
Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people, and thus greatly reduce the infection and transmission of malaria.  The nets are not a perfect barrier, so they are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to search for a way past the net.  Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets,<ref name="hull2006">[http://www.wgbh.org:81/cgi-bin/nph-algs.cgi/000000A/http/www.wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=2682027&episode_id=2682029 Hull, Kevin. (2006) "Malaria: Fever Wars". PBS Documentary]</ref> and offers greater than 70% protection compared with no net.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Bacteraemia among severely malnourished children infected and uninfected with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 in Kampala, Uganda | author=Bachou H, Tylleskar T, Kaddu-Mulindwa DH, Tumwine JK. | journal=BMC Infect Dis | year=2006 | volume=6 | pages=160 | doi=10.1186/1471-2334-6-160 }}</ref>  Since the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes feed at night, the preferred method is to hang a large "bed net" above the center of a bed such that it drapes down and covers the bed completely.  

The distribution of mosquito nets impregnated with insecticide (often [[permethrin]] or deltamethrin) has been shown to be an extremely effective method of malaria prevention, and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods of prevention.  These nets can often be obtained for around US$2.50 - $3.50 (2-3 euros) from the [[United Nations]], the World Health Organization, and others.  

For maximum effectiveness, the nets should be re-impregnated with insecticide every six months.  This process poses a significant logistical problem in rural areas.  New technologies like Olyset or DawaPlus allow for production of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Mosquito Nets (LLINs), which release insecticide for approximately 5 years,<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2004-11/2004-11-23-voa30.cfm?CFID=15461499&CFTOKEN=28007413 New Mosquito Nets Could Help Fight Malaria in Africa]</ref> and cost about US$5.50.  ITN's have the advantage of protecting people sleeping under the net and simultaneously killing mosquitoes that contact the net.  This has the effect of killing the most dangerous mosquitoes.  Some protection is also provided to others, including people sleeping in the same room but not under the net.

Unfortunately, the cost of treating malaria is high relative to income, and the illness results in lost wages.  Consequently, the financial burden means that the cost of a mosquito net is often unaffordable to people in developing countries, especially for those most at risk.  Only 1 out of 20 people in Africa own a bed net.<ref name="hull2006">{{cite news | author=Hull, Kevin | title=Malaria: Fever Wars | url=http://www.wgbh.org:81/cgi-bin/nph-algs.cgi/000000A/http/www.wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=2682027&episode_id=2682029 | date=2006 | publisher=PBS Documentary}}</ref>

A study among Afghan refugees in Pakistan found that treating top-sheets and chaddars (head coverings) with permethrin has similar effectiveness to using a treated net, but is much cheaper.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rowland M, Durrani N, Hewitt S, Mohammed N, Bouma M, Carneiro I, Rozendaal J, Schapira A | title = Permethrin-treated chaddars and top-sheets: appropriate technology for protection against malaria in Afghanistan and other complex emergencies. | journal = Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg | volume = 93 | issue = 5 | pages = 465-72 | year = | id = PMID 10696399}}</ref>

A new approach, announced in ''Science'' on [[June 10]], 2005, uses spores of the [[fungus]] ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'', sprayed on walls and bed nets, to kill mosquitoes.  While some mosquitoes have developed resistance to chemicals, they have not been found to develop a resistance to fungal infections.<ref name="bbcfungus">"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4074212.stm Fungus 'may help malaria fight']", ''BBC News'', [[2005-06-09]]</ref>

===Vaccination===
[[Vaccination|Vaccines]] for malaria are under development, with no completely effective vaccine yet available.  

The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-[[Attenuation|attenuated]] [[sporozoite]]s, providing protection to about 60% of the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites.<ref name="Nussenzweig1967">{{cite journal |author=Nussenzweig R, Vanderberg J, Most H, Orton C |title=Protective immunity produced by the injection of x-irradiated sporozoites of plasmodium berghei |journal=Nature |volume=216 |issue=5111 |pages=160-2 |year=1967 |id=PMID 6057225}}</ref>  Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies within humans.  It was determined that an individual can be protected from a ''P. falciparum'' infection if she receives over 1000 bites from infected, irradiated mosquitoes.<ref name="Hoffman2002">{{cite journal |author=Hoffman S, Goh L, Luke T, Schneider I, Le T, Doolan D, Sacci J, de la Vega P, Dowler M, Paul C, Gordon D, Stoute J, Church L, Sedegah M, Heppner D, Ballou W, Richie T |title=Protection of humans against malaria by immunization with radiation-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=185 |issue=8 |pages=1155-64 |year=2002 |id=PMID 11930326}}</ref>

Though promising, it is generally accepted that it is hardly practical to provide at-risk individuals with this vaccination strategy.  Instead, much work has been performed to try and understand the [[immune system|immunological]] processes that provide protection after immunization with irradiated sporozoites.  After the mouse vaccination study in 1967,<ref name="Nussenzweig1967"/> it was hypothesized that the injected sporozoites themselves were being recognized by the immune system, which was in turn creating [[antibody|antibodies]] against the parasite.  It was determined that the immune system was creating antibodies against the [[circumsporozoite]] protein (CSP) which coated the sporozoite.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zavala F, Cochrane A, Nardin E, Nussenzweig R, Nussenzweig V |title=Circumsporozoite proteins of malaria parasites contain a single immunodominant region with two or more identical epitopes |journal=J Exp Med |volume=157 |issue=6 |pages=1947-57 |year=1983 |id=PMID 6189951}}</ref>  Moreover, antibodies against CSP prevented the sporozoite from invading hepatocytes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hollingdale M, Nardin E, Tharavanij S, Schwartz A, Nussenzweig R |title=Inhibition of entry of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax sporozoites into cultured cells; an in vitro assay of protective antibodies |journal=J Immunol |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=909-13 |year=1984 |id=PMID 6317752}}</ref> CSP was therefore chosen as the most promising protein on which to develop a vaccine against the malaria sporozoite.  It is for these historical reasons that vaccines based on CSP are the most numerous of all malaria vaccines.

Presently, there is a huge variety of vaccine candidates on the table.  Pre-erythrocytic vaccines (vaccines that target the parasite before it reaches the blood), in particular vaccines based on CSP, make up the largest group of research for the malaria vaccine.  Other vaccine candidates include: those that seek to induce immunity to the blood stages of the infection; those that seek to avoid more severe pathologies of malaria by preventing adherence of the parasite to blood [[venules]] and [[placenta]]; and [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]]-blocking vaccines that would stop the development of the parasite in the mosquito right after the mosquito has taken a bloodmeal from an infected person.<ref name="Matuschewski2006">{{cite journal |author=Matuschewski K |title=Vaccine development against malaria |journal=Curr Opin Immunol |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=449-57 |year=2006 |id=PMID 16765576}}</ref> It is hoped that the sequencing of the ''P. falciparum'' [[genome]] will provide targets for new drugs or vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gardner M, Hall N, Fung E, White O, Berriman M, Hyman R, Carlton J, Pain A, Nelson K, Bowman S, Paulsen I, James K, Eisen J, Rutherford K, Salzberg S, Craig A, Kyes S, Chan M, Nene V, Shallom S, Suh B, Peterson J, Angiuoli S, Pertea M, Allen J, Selengut J, Haft D, Mather M, Vaidya A, Martin D, Fairlamb A, Fraunholz M, Roos D, Ralph S, McFadden G, Cummings L, Subramanian G, Mungall C, Venter J, Carucci D, Hoffman S, Newbold C, Davis R, Fraser C, Barrell B | title = Genome sequence of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. | journal = Nature | volume = 419 | issue = 6906 | pages = 498-511 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 12368864}}</ref>

The RTS,S/AS02A vaccine is the candidate furthest along in vaccine trials.  It is being developed by a partnership between the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (a grantee of the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]]) and the [[pharmaceutical company]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]].  In the vaccine, a portion of CSP has been fused to the [[immunogenicity|immunogenic]] "S [[antigen]]" of the [[hepatitis B]] virus; this [[recombinant]] protein is injected alongside the potent AS02A [[adjuvant]].<ref name="Matuschewski2006"/> In October 2004, the RTS,S/AS02A researchers announced results of a [[clinical trial|Phase IIb trial]], indicating the vaccine reduced infection risk by approximately 30% and severity of infection by over 50%.  The study looked at over 2,000 [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alonso P, Sacarlal J, Aponte J, Leach A, Macete E, Milman J, Mandomando I, Spiessens B, Guinovart C, Espasa M, Bassat Q, Aide P, Ofori-Anyinam O, Navia M, Corachan S, Ceuppens M, Dubois M, Demoitié M, Dubovsky F, Menéndez C, Tornieporth N, Ballou W, Thompson R, Cohen J |title=Efficacy of the RTS,S/AS02A vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum infection and disease in young African children: randomised controlled trial |journal=Lancet |volume=364 |issue=9443 |pages=1411-20 |year= |id=PMID 15488216}}</ref> Further research will delay this vaccine from commercial release until around 2011.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200701090730.html Africa: Malaria - Vaccine Expected in 2011.] ''[http://www.accra-mail.com Accra Mail.]'' 9 January 2007. Accessed 15 January 2007.</ref>

===Other methods===
[[Sterile insect technique]] is emerging as a potential mosquito control method.  Progress towards transgenic, or [[genetically modified organism|genetically modified]], insects suggest that wild mosquito populations could be made malaria-resistant. Researchers at [[Imperial College London]] created the world's first transgenic malaria mosquito,<ref>Imperial College, London, "[http://www.ic.ac.uk/templates/text_3.asp?P=1911 Scientists create first transgenic malaria mosquito]", [[2000-06-22]].</ref> with the first plasmodium-resistant species announced by a team at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Ohio]] in 2002.<ref name="ito2002"> {{cite journal | author=Ito J, Ghosh A, Moreira LA, Wimmer EA, Jacobs-Lorena M | title=Transgenic anopheline mosquitoes impaired in transmission of a malaria parasite | journal=Nature | year=2002 | volume=417 | pages=387-8  | id=PMID 12024215}}</ref>

Before DDT, malaria was successfully eradicated or controlled also in several tropical areas by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larva stages, for example by filling or applying oil to places with standing water. These methods have seen little application in Africa for more than half a century.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Killeen G, Fillinger U, Kiche I, Gouagna L, Knols B | title = Eradication of Anopheles gambiae from Brazil: lessons for malaria control in Africa? | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = 618-27 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 12383612}}</ref>
