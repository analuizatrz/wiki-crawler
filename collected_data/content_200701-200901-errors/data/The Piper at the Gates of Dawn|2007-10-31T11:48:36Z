'''''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn''''' is [[Pink Floyd]]'s debut album and the only one made under [[Syd Barrett]]'s leadership, although he made some contributions to the follow-up, ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]''. It has been regarded as one of the most influential LPs ever made{{Fact|date=August 2007}}, being a tremendous influence on the [[psychedelic rock]] scene of the time, and much of what followed. The album has whimsical lyrics about [[space]], [[scarecrow]]s, [[gnome]]s, [[bicycle]]s and [[fairytale]]s, along with [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] [[instrumental rock|instrumental]] passages. The album celebrated its 40th anniversary on the [[5 August]] [[2007]]. 

==Background==
In January 1967, prior to recording ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'', the band had produced at [[Sound Techniques (studio)|Sound Techniques Studio]] in [[London]] a single entitled ''[[Arnold Layne]]''. The single was later released in March of that year and reached #20 in the British charts. Also in January the band had recorded a 16-minute version of ''Interstellar Overdrive'' and an improvised jam called ''[[Nick's Boogie]]'', for [[Peter Whitehead (filmmaker)|Peter Whitehead]]'s documentary film ''[[Tonite Let's All Make Love in London]]''. (The latter track wasn't released until 1991 on the CD reissue of the film's soundtrack). The band's live show consisted mainly of instrumental numbers and blues covers, however they had started to introduce songs which were written primarily by lead [[Guitarist]] and [[Lead Vocalist]], [[Syd Barrett]]. Many of these songs written by Barrett appeared at the [[Games For May]] concert several months before the release of the album.

==Recording history==
Recording of the album began on the [[21 February]] [[1967]] in studio three of [[Abbey Road Studios]] at the same time [[The Beatles]] were recording ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and [[The Pretty Things]] were recording ''[[S.F. Sorrow]]''. The album was produced by [[Norman Smith]], an [[EMI]] staff member who had previously engineered all of The Beatles recordings up to 1965's ''[[Rubber Soul]]''. Smith would go on to produce Pink Floyd's follow up album, ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]''. "[[Interstellar Overdrive]]" and "[[Matilda Mother]]" were two of the first tracks recorded, as the latter was viewed as a potential single. "Interstellar Overdrive"s kinetic and spacey production, came from the insistence of the normally conservative Norman Smith, whose work on the record is often criticised because it is seen that he tried to make the album more pop orientated{{Fact|date=October 2007}}. A second take of "Interstellar Overdrive" was used for a [[France|French]] [[EP]] released that July. In [[April]], the band recorded both "Percy the Rat Catcher" (this would later be called "[[Lucifer Sam]]"), and a currently unreleased track called "She Was a Millionaire". At some point during the album's creation, [[Nick Mason]] recalled that they were "ushered" into studio 2 where The Beatles were recording "[[Lovely Rita]]". Several conflicting views surround how efficiently the [[recording]] of the album actually went. In his book ''[[Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd]]'', Nick Mason recalled that the sessions went smoothly and that the whole process was extremely efficient. Norman Smith however, condemned both the album's recording and the band members' musical abilities. Smith would later state that the sessions were "sheer hell". However, both "[[The Gnome]]" and "[[The Scarecrow (Pink Floyd song)|The Scarecrow]]" were recorded in one take. Indeed a large proportion of the album is credited solely to Barrett, with tracks such as "[[Bike (song)|Bike]]" having been written in late 1966 before the album was even started. "Bike" was originally entitled "The Bike Song", and it was recorded on [[21 May]] [[1967]]. The last recording session took place on [[5 July]] [[1967]], with the track "[[Pow R. Toc H.]]" being one of last songs added to the album.

==Album cover and title==
Vic Singh photographed and designed the album cover, unlike subsequent Pink Floyd albums. The album remains one of the few to actually feature the band members on the front cover. The album's title comes from the title of the seventh chapter of [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s ''[[Wind in the Willows|The Wind in the Willows]]'', where Water Rat and Mole, while searching for a lost animal, have a spiritual experience. "'This is the place of my song-dream, the place the music played to me,' whispered the Rat, as if in a trance. 'Here, in this holy place, here if anywhere, surely we shall find Him!'". The ''Piper'' referred to is the Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. The title was later referenced by [[Stevie Wonder]] in the song "Power Flower" from the 1979 album ''[[Journey through the Secret Life of Plants]]'' ("Fire and air, earth water I prepare/I am the piper at the gates of dawning").

==Release history==
The original UK [[gramophone record|LP]] (with a [[monaural]] mix) was released on [[August 5]], [[1967]], and one month later it was released in [[Stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] mix. It reached #6 on the UK charts. 

The original U.S. album appeared on the [[Tower Records (record label)|Tower Records]] division of [[Capitol Records]] in October 1967. This version (Tower ST-5093) was officially entitled simply ''Pink Floyd'' though the original album title did appear on the back cover as on the UK issue. The U.S. album featured an abbreviated track listing and reached #131 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts. A UK single, "[[See Emily Play]]", was substituted for "Astronomy Domine", "[[Flaming (Pink Floyd song)|Flaming]]" and "Bike". The Tower Records vinyl issue also faded out "Interstellar Overdrive" and broke up the segue into "The Gnome" due to the fact that the songs were re-sequenced. Later U.S. issues on CD had the same title and track list as the UK version.

The Canadian LP (Capitol ST-6242) had the same title and track listing as the UK version.

In 1973, the album, along with ''A Saucerful of Secrets'', was released as a double disk set on EMI/Capitol's [[Harvest Records]] label entitled, ''[[A Nice Pair]]''. (Note - in the U.S. version of that compilation, the original 4 minute studio version of "[[Astronomy Domine]]" was replaced with the 8 minute live version found on ''"[[Ummagumma]]"''). The U.S. edition of "A Nice Pair" also failed to properly restore the segue between "Interstellar Overdrive" and "The Gnome."

The stereo mix of the album was first released on [[compact disc|CD]] in 1987, and re-released as a digitally re-mastered CD in 1994 and then in June 1995 in the U.S. Three years later, EMI released a re-mastered, limited-run mono mix version in a hefty [[digipak]] with [[Three-dimensional space|3-D]] box art for continental Europe and the world outside America. This was however not the same mix as the now ultra-rare mono LP. This mono CD included a slightly edited version of "Flaming" rather than the full length mono LP mix. The "Flaming" mono edit previously appeared on a rare U.S. single. A six track bonus CD ''[[1967: The First Three Singles]]'' was given away alongside the 1997 30th anniversary edition of the album. 

===Two/Three CD fortieth anniversary edition===
A two-disc 40th anniversary edition was released on September 4th, 2007, and a three-disc set was released on [[September 11]], [[2007]]. The packaging, designed by Storm Thorgerson, resembles a cloth-covered book, along with a twelve page reproduction Syd Barrett notebook. Discs one and two contain the full 'Piper' album, represented in both stereo and mono versions. Both have been newly remastered by [[James Guthrie (record producer)|James Guthrie]].

==Reception==
At the time of release, the album was received positively{{Fact|date=July 2007}}, and in subsequent years the record is recognised as one of the seminal psychedelic rock albums of the 1960s. In 1967, both [[Record Mirror]] and [[NME]] gave the album four stars out of five. Record Mirror commented that "the psychedelic image of the group really comes to life on this LP, which is a fine showcase for both their talent and the recording technique. Plenty of mindblowing sound"{{Fact|date=July 2007}}. [[Cash Box]] called it a "striking collection of driving, up to date rock ventures"{{Fact|date=July 2007}}. [[Paul McCartney]] and Pink Floyd's past producer [[Joe Boyd]], both rated the album highly{{Fact|date=July 2007}}. Some{{Who|date=July 2007}}, most notably [[Pete Townshend]]{{Fact|date=July 2007}}, voiced the opinion of the underground fans, by suggesting that the album did not reflect the band's live performances. In recent years the album has gained even more recognition. In 1999 ''Rolling Stone Magazine'' gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it - "the golden achievement of Syd Barrett". [[Q Magazine]] described the album as "indispensable", and included it in their best psychedelic albums of all time{{Fact|date=July 2007}}. It was also ranked 40th in ''[[Mojo]]'' magazines, The 50 Most Out There Albums of all Time. In 2000 [[Q magazine|''Q'' magazine]] placed ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'' at number 55 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. {{RS500|347}}[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6599401/347_the_piper_at_the_gates_of_dawn]

==Live performances==
Although there was never an official tour of the album, the band visited both [[Ireland]] and [[Scandinavia]], and in November the band embarked on their first tour of [[United States|America]]. It was unsuccessful due mainly to the mental breakdown of the band's frontman Syd Barrett. For the American tour, many of the numbers were dropped (such as "Flaming" and "The Gnome"), but tracks such as "Astronomy Domine" and "Interstellar Overdrive" remained. "Astronomy Domine" and "Interstellar" were central to the band's setlist during this period, and they remained as encores until around 1970. "Astronomy" was later included on the live ''Ummagumma'' disk, and it was adopted by the post-Waters Pink Floyd during the [[1994]] ''[[The Division Bell]]'' tour, and a version was included on the [[1995]] [[live album]], ''[[P*U*L*S*E]]''. Tracks 8-11 on the UK album edition were played the least during live performances. The success of "See Emily Play" and "Arnold Layne", meant that the band were forced to perform some of their singles for a limited period in 1967, but they were eventually dropped after Barrett left the band. "Flaming" and "Pow R. Toc H." were also played regularly by the post-Barrett Pink Floyd in [[1968]], even though these songs were in complete contrast to the band's other works at this time. Some of the songs from ''Piper'' would be reworked and rearranged for ''[[The Man and the Journey]]'' live show in [[1969]] ("The Pink Jungle" was taken from "Pow R. Toc H." and part of "Interstellar Overdrive" was used for  "The Labyrinths of Auximines"). From around [[September]] 1967, the band played several new compositions. These included; "Reaction in G", "[[Scream Thy Last Scream]]" and "[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]". The latter track written by Waters (which would later be included on ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]''), became a mainstay of the bands setlist until around [[1973]].

==Singles==

==Quotes==
"We were given Norman Smith by EMI, no arguments. So Joe
Boyd, our original producer, got written out of the thing. Norman was
more interested in making us sound like a classical rock band. It was a
bit like the George Martin thing, a useful influence to have. But I
think Joe would have given Syd his head, let him run in a freer way. We
spent three months recording it, which was quite a long time in
those days. Bands used to have to finish albums in a week, with session
players brought in to play the difficult bits. But because The
Beatles were taking their time recording Sgt Pepper in the studio next
door, EMI thought this was the way people now made records" - Nick Mason
