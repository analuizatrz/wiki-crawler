A '''planet''', as [[2006 definition of planet|defined]] by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), is a celestial body [[orbit]]ing a [[star]] or [[Stellar evolution#Stellar remnants|stellar remnant]] that is massive enough to be rounded by its own [[gravity]], not massive enough to cause [[thermonuclear fusion]], and has [[cleared the neighbourhood|cleared its neighbouring region]] of [[planetesimals]].<ref name=IAU>{{ cite web | title = IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes | url = http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-30 }}</ref><ref name=WSGESP>{{ cite web |year = 2001 | title = Working Group on Extrasolar Planets (WGESP) of the International Astronomical Union | work = IAU | url = http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html | accessdate = 2006-05-25 }}</ref>

The term ''planet'' is an ancient one having ties to history, science, myth, and religion. The planets were originally seen as a divine presence; as emissaries of the gods. Even today, many people continue to believe the [[astrology|movement of the planets affects their lives]], although such a causation is [[Astrology and astronomy#Historical divergence|rejected by the scientific community]]. As scientific knowledge advanced, the human perception of the planets changed over time, incorporating a number of disparate objects. Even now there is no uncontested definition of what a planet is. In 2006, the IAU officially adopted a resolution [[2006 definition of planet|defining planets]] within the [[Solar System]]. This definition has been both praised and criticized, and remains disputed by some scientists. 

The planets were initially thought to orbit the Earth in circular motions; after  the development of the telescope, the planets were determined to orbit the Sun, and their orbits were found to be elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes and shared such features as ice-caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the [[space age]], close observation by probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics and even hydrology. Since 1992, and the discovery of hundreds of [[extrasolar planets]], scientists are beginning to observe similar features across the galaxy. 

Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]) and also at least three [[dwarf planets]] ([[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Pluto]], and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]). Many of these planets are orbited by one or more [[natural satellite|moons]], which can be larger than small planets. There have also been more than two hundred planets discovered [[extrasolar planet|orbiting other stars]].<ref name="Encyclopaedia">{{cite web |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |last=Schneider |first=Jean |date=[[October 30]], [[2006]] |accessdate=2006-10-31}}</ref> Planets are generally divided into two main types: large, low-density [[gas giant]]s and smaller, rocky [[terrestrial planet|terrestrials]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:Olympians.jpg|thumb|left|220 px|The gods of [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Olympus]], after whom the Solar System's planets are named]]

In ancient times, astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky in relation to the other stars. The lights were first called "πλανήται" (''planētai''),<ref>See [[romanization of Greek]] for the transcription scheme.</ref> meaning "wanderers", by the ancient Greeks, and it is from this that the word "planet" was derived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/planet|title=Definition of planet|publisher=Merriam-Webster OnLine|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordsources.info/words-mod-planets.html|title=Words For Our Modern Age: Especially words derived from Latin and Greek sources|publisher=Wordsources.info|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref>
The Greeks gave the planets names: the farthest was called ''Phainon'', the shiner, while below it was ''Phaethon'', the bright one. The red planet was known as ''Pyroeis'', "fiery", while the brightest was known as ''Phosphoros'', the light bringer, and the fleeting final planet was called ''Stilbon'', the gleamer. However, the Greeks also made each planet sacred to one of their pantheon of gods, the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]]: Phainon was sacred to [[Cronus|Kronos]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who fathered the Olympians, while Phaethon was sacred to [[Zeus]], his son who deposed him as king. [[Ares]], son of Zeus and god of war, was given dominion over Pyroeis, while [[Aphrodite]], goddess of love, ruled over bright Phosphoros, and [[Hermes]] ruled over Stilbon.<ref name=astronomy>{{cite book|title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy|author=James Evans|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|pages=296-7}}</ref> 

The Greek practice of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets was  almost certainly borrowed from the [[Babylonians]], a contemporary civilisation in what is now [[Iraq]], from whom they had begun to absorb astronomical learning, including constellations and the zodiac, by 600 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Chronological History of Babylonian Astronomy|author=Gary D. Thompson|url=http://members.optusnet.com.au/~gtosiris/page9k.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref> The Babylonians named Phosphoros after their goddess of love, Ishtar, Pyroeis after their god of war, Nergal, and Phaethon after their chief god, Marduk.<ref name= nergal>{{cite web|first=Kelley L.|last=Ross|year=2005|title=The Days of the Week|url=http://www.friesian.com/week.htm|publisher=The Friesian School|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref> There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately.<ref name=astronomy /> There does, however, appear to have been some confusion in translation. For instance, the Babylonian [[Nergal]] was a god of war, and the Greeks, seeing this aspect of Nergal's persona, identified him with [[Ares]], their god of war. However, Nergal, unlike Ares, was also a god of the dead and a god of pestilence.<ref name= nergal />
[[Image:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|Early printed rendition of a geocentric cosmological model.]]
Today, most people in the western world know the planets by names derived from the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian pantheon]] of gods; however, because of the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and, later, the [[Catholic Church]], they are known by their Roman (or Latin) names, rather than the Greek. The Romans, who, like the Greeks, were [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-Europeans]], shared with them a [[Roman mythology|common pantheon]] under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic culture had given [[Greek mythology|their gods]]. During the later period of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon, to the point where they became virtually indistinguishable.<ref>{{cite book|title=Greek Mythography in the Roman World|author=Alan Cameron|year=2005|publisher=OUP}}</ref> When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, they gave the planets their own gods' names.
To the Greeks and Romans, there were five known planets; each presumed to be [[Geocentric model|circling the Earth]] according to the complex laws laid out by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century. They were, in increasing order from Earth (according to Ptolemy): [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] ([[Hermes]]), [[Venus]] ([[Aphrodite]]), [[Mars]] ([[Ares]]), [[Jupiter]] ([[Zeus]]), and [[Saturn]] ([[Cronus|Kronos]]). Although strictly the term "planetai" referred only to those five objects, the term was often expanded to include the Sun and the Moon.<ref>{{cite web

 | accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> When subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was retained: [[Uranus]] ([[Ouranos]]) and [[Neptune]] ([[Poseidon]]). The Greeks still use their original names for the planets.

Some [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], following a belief imported from [[Mesopotamia]] into [[Hellenistic Egypt]],<ref>{{cite web

The order of shifts began with Jupiter and worked inwards; as a result, a list of which god had charge of the first hour in each day became Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, i.e. the usual weekday name order.<ref name="weekdays">{{cite journal

In English the other days were renamed after [[Tyr|Tiw]], (Tuesday) [[Woden|Wóden]] (Wednesday), [[Thor|Thunor]] (Thursday), and [[Frige|Fríge]] (Friday), [[Anglo-Saxon gods]] considered similar or equivalent to Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus respectively.

Since Earth was only generally accepted as a planet in the 17th century, there is no tradition of naming it after a god. Many of the [[Romance languages]] (including French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese), which are descended from Latin, retain the old Roman name of ''Terra'' or some variation thereof. However, the non-Romance languages  use their own respective native words. Again, the Greeks retain their original name, ''Γή'' (''Ge'' or ''Yi''); the [[Germanic languages]], including English, use a variation of an ancient Germanic word ''ertho'', "ground,"<ref>{{cite web|title=Etymonline: Earth|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=earth&searchmode=none|accessdate=2007-10-02}}</ref> as can be seen in the English ''Earth'', the German ''Erde,'' the Dutch ''Aarde'', and the Scandinavian ''Jorde.'' The same is true for the Sun and the Moon, though they are no longer considered planets.

Some non-European cultures use their own planetary naming systems. India uses a naming system based on the [[Navagraha]], which incorporates the seven traditional planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) and the ascending and descending [[lunar node]]s [[Rahu]] and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]. China, and the countries of eastern Asia subject to Chinese cultural influence, such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]], use a naming system based on the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five Chinese elements]].<ref name="weekdays"/>

[[Image:geoz wb en.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Heliocentrism (lower panel) in comparison to the geocentric model (upper panel)]]

As scientific knowledge progressed, understanding of the term "planet" changed from something that moved across the sky (in relation to the [[fixed star|starfield]]), to a body that orbited the Earth (or that were believed to do so at the time). When the [[heliocentric model]] gained sway in the 16th century, it became accepted that a planet was actually something that directly orbited the [[Sun]]. Thus the Earth was itself a planet,<ref>{{cite web | last =Van Helden | first =Al | year=1995 | url =http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/theories/copernican_system.html | title =Copernican System | publisher =The Galileo Project | accessdate = 2007-04-08 }}</ref> while the Sun and [[Moon]] were not.<!-- Since they do not directly "orbit the Sun" --> At the end of the 17th century, when the first satellites of Saturn were discovered, the terms "planet" and "satellite" were at first used interchangeably, although "satellite" would gradually become more prevalent in the following century.<ref>{{cite journal PIG

There may just be earlier publications within the ''[[Journal des sçavans]].---></ref> Until the mid-19th century, any newly discovered object orbiting the Sun was listed with the planets by the scientific community, and the number of "planets" swelled rapidly towards the end of that period.

During the 1800s, astronomers began to realize most recent discoveries were unlike the traditional planets. They shared the same [[asteroid belt|region of space]], between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], and had a far smaller mass. Bodies such as [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], which had been classed as planets for almost half a century, became classified with the new designation "[[asteroid]]." From this point, a "planet" came to be understood, in the absence of any formal definition, as any "large" body that orbited the Sun. There was no apparent need to create a set limit, as  there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets, and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of [[Neptune]] in 1846.<ref>{{cite web | last =Hilton | first =James L. | date =[[September 17]], [[2001]] | url =http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/AsteroidHistory/minorplanets.html | title =When Did the Asteroids Become Minor Planets? | publisher =U.S. Naval Observatory | accessdate = 2007-04-08 }}</ref>

However, in the 20th century, [[Pluto]] was discovered. After initial observations led to the belief it was larger than Earth, the recently-created [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] accepted the object as a planet. Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller, but, as it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population, it kept its status for some seventy years.<ref>{{cite web

In the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a flood of discoveries of similar objects in the [[Kuiper belt|same region]] of the Solar System. Like Ceres and the asteroids before it, Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands. A growing number of astronomers argued for it to be declassified as a planet, since many similar objects approaching its size were found. The discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a more massive object widely publicised as the [[tenth planet]], brought things to a head. The IAU set about creating the [[definition of planet]], and eventually produced one in 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had [[clearing the neighbourhood|cleared their orbit]] ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] & [[Neptune]]), and a new class of [[dwarf planet]]s was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris).<ref>{{cite paper

==Definition and disputes==
{{main|Definition of planet}}
With the discovery during the latter half of the [[20th century|twentieth century]] of more objects within the [[Solar System]] and [[Extrasolar planets|large objects]] around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There was particular disagreement over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a [[Asteroid belt|belt]], or if it was large enough to generate energy by the [[thermonuclear fusion]] of [[deuterium]].

In 2003, The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) Working Group on Extrasolar Planets made a position statement on the definition of a planet that incorporated a working definition:<ref name=WSGESP>{{cite web

#Free-floating objects in young [[star cluster]]s with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate).

This matter was finally addressed during the 2006 meeting of the IAU's General Assembly. After much debate and one failed proposal, the assembly voted to pass a resolution that [[2006 definition of planet|defined planets within the Solar System]] as:<ref name=IAU>{{cite web

Under this definition, the Solar System is considered to have eight planets. Bodies which fulfill the first two conditions but not the third (such as Pluto and Eris) are classified as [[dwarf planet]]s, providing they are not also [[natural satellite]]s of other planets. Originally an IAU committee had proposed a definition that would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not include (c) as a criterion. After much discussion, it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets.

This definition is based in modern theories of planetary formation, in which planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other smaller objects. As described by astronomer [[Steven Soter]]:

{{quotation|''"The end product of secondary disk accretion is a small number of relatively large bodies (planets) in either non-intersecting or resonant orbits, which prevent collisions between them.

Beyond the scientific community, Pluto has held a strong cultural significance for many in the general public considering its planetary status during most of the 20th century, in a similar way to Ceres and its kin in the 1800s. More recently, the discovery of Eris was widely reported in the [[mass media|media]] as the "[[tenth planet]]".

==Formation==
{{main|Planetary formation}}
It is not known with certainty how planets are formed. The prevailing theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a [[nebula]] into a thin disk of gas and dust. A [[protostar]] forms at the core, surrounded by a rotating [[protoplanetary disk]]. Through [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]]&mdash;a process of sticky collision&mdash;dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies. Local concentrations of mass known as [[planetesimal]]s form, and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction. These concentrations become ever more dense until they collapse inward under gravity to form [[protoplanet]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

Meanwhile, protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become [[natural satellite]]s of planets through a process of gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to become either [[dwarf planet]]s or [[small solar system bodies]].

The energetic impacts of the smaller planetesimals (as well as [[radioactive decay]]) will heat up the growing planet, causing it to at least partially melt. The interior of the planet begins to differentiate by mass, developing a denser core. Smaller terrestrial planets lose most of their atmospheres because of this accretion, but the lost gases can be replaced by outgassing from the mantle and from the subsequent impact of [[comet]]s.<ref>{{cite web

{{main|Solar System}}
According to the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s current definitions<!--"According to the IAU" alone sounds really awkward--> there are eight planets in the Solar System. The largest is Jupiter, at 318 Earth masses. The smallest is Mercury, at 0.055 Earth masses. In increasing distance from the [[Sun]], the planets are:
#[[Image:Mercury symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|☿}}]] '''[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'''
#[[Image:Venus symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|♀}}]] '''[[Venus]]'''
#[[Image:Earth symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|⊕}}]] '''[[Earth]]'''
#[[Image:Mars symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|♂}}]] '''[[Mars]]'''
#[[Image:Jupiter symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|♃}}]] '''[[Jupiter]]'''

#[[Image:Neptune symbol.svg|14px|{{unicode|♆}}]] '''[[Neptune]]'''
                                                                                               
The larger bodies of the Solar System can be divided into categories based on their composition:
* '''[[Terrestrial planet|Terrestrial]]s''': Planets (and possibly dwarf planets) that are similar to Earth &mdash; with bodies largely composed of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. 
* '''[[Gas giant]]s''': Planets with a composition largely made up of [[gas]]eous material and are significantly more massive than terrestrials: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. [[Ice giant]]s are a sub-class of gas giants, distinguished from gas giants by their depletion in hydrogen and helium, and a significant composition of rock and ice: Uranus and Neptune.

===Dwarf planets===
{{main|Dwarf planet}}

Before the [[2006 redefinition of planet|August 2006 decision]], several objects were proposed by astronomers, including at one stage by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]], as planets. However in 2006 several of these objects were reclassified as [[dwarf planet]]s, objects distinct from planets. Currently three dwarf planets in the [[Solar System]] are recognized by the IAU: [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Pluto]] and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]. Several other objects in both the [[asteroid belt]] and the [[Kuiper belt]] are under consideration, with as many as 50 that could eventually qualify. There may be as many as 200 that could be discovered once the Kuiper Belt has been fully explored. Dwarf planets share many of the same [[characteristics]] as planets, although notable differences remain&mdash;namely that they are not [[clearing the neighbourhood|dominant in their orbits]]. Their attributes are:

By definition, all dwarf planets are members of larger [[populations]]. Ceres is the largest body in the [[asteroid belt]], while Pluto is a member of the [[Kuiper belt]] and Eris is a member of the [[scattered disc]]. According to [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] there may soon be over forty [[trans-Neptunian objects]] that qualify as dwarf planets under the IAU's recent definition.<ref>{{cite news

===Extrasolar planets===

The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star  occurred on October 6, 1995, when Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced the detection of an exoplanet around [[51 Pegasi]]. Of the 267 [[extrasolar planet]]s discovered by November 2007, most have masses which are comparable to or larger than Jupiter's.<ref name="Encyclopedia">{{cite web |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |last=Schneider |first=Jean |date=[[December 11]], [[2006]] |accessdate=2006-12-11}}</ref> Exceptions include a number of planets discovered orbiting burned-out star remnants called [[pulsar]]s, such as [[PSR B1257 plus 12|PSR B1257+12]],<ref>{{cite news

It is far from clear if the newly discovered large planets would resemble the gas giants in the Solar System or if they are of an entirely different type as yet unknown, like ammonia giants or carbon planets. In particular, some of the newly-discovered planets, known as [[hot Jupiter]]s, orbit extremely close to their parent stars, in nearly circular orbits. They therefore receive much more [[solar radiation|stellar radiation]] than the gas giants in the Solar System, which makes it questionable whether they are the same type of planet at all. There is also a class of hot Jupiters that orbit so close to their star that their atmospheres are slowly blown away in a comet-like tail: the [[Chthonian planet]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

More detailed observation of extrasolar planets will require a new generation of instruments, including [[space telescope]]s. Currently the [[CoRoT]] spacecraft is searching for stellar luminosity variations due to [[Astronomical transit|transiting planets]]. Several projects have also been proposed to create an array of [[space telescope]]s to search for extrasolar planets with masses comparable to the Earth. These include the proposed NASA's [[Kepler Mission]], [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]], and [[Space Interferometry Mission]] programs, the [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]], and the CNES' [[PEGASE]].<ref>{{cite web

Although each planet has unique physical characteristics, a number of broad commonalities do exist between them. Some of these characteristics, such as rings or natural satellites, have only as yet been observed in planets in the Solar System, whilst others are also common to extrasolar planets. 

===Dynamic characteristics===
{{seealso|Kepler's laws of planetary motion}}
====Orbit====
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt Orbits Pluto Ecliptic.svg|thumb|250 px|left|The orbit of the planet Neptune compared to that of [[Pluto]]. Note the elongation of Pluto's orbit in relation to Neptune's ([[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]), as well as its large angle to the ecliptic ([[inclination]])]]
All planets revolve around stars. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit in sync with the Sun's rotation. It is not yet known whether all extrasolar planets follow this pattern. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its [[sidereal period]] or ''[[year]]''.<ref name="young">{{cite book

Because no planet's orbit is perfectly circular, the distance of each varies over the course of its year. Its closest distance to its is called its [[periastron]] ([[perihelion]] in the Solar System), while its farthest distance from the star is called its [[apastron]] ([[aphelion]] in the Solar System). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as the pull of its star's gravity strengthens; as it reaches apastron, its speed decreases.<ref>{{cite book

Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of [[orbital elements|elements]]:

*The ''[[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]'' of an orbit describes how elongated a planet's orbit is. Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits, while planets with a high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits. The planets in our Solar System have very low eccentricities, and thus nearly circular orbits.<ref name="young"/> Comets and Kuiper belt objects (as well as several extrasolar planets) have very high eccentricities, and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eccentricity evolution of giant planet orbits due to circumstellar disk torques|author=Althea V.

[[Image:Semimajoraxis.png|thumb|200 px|an illustration of the semi-major axis]]
*The ''[[semi-major axis]]'' is the distance from a planet to the half-way point along the longest diameter of its elliptical orbit (see image). This distance is not necessarily the same as its apasteron, as no planet's orbit has its star at its exact centre.<ref name="young"/>
*In our Solar System, the ''[[inclination]]'' of a planet tells how far above or below the plane of Earth's orbit (called the [[ecliptic]]) a planet's orbit lies. The eight planets of our Solar System all lie very close to the ecliptic; comets and [[Kuiper belt object]]s like [[Pluto]] are at far more extreme angles to it.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Correlation between Inclination and Color in the Classical Kuiper Belt|author=Chadwick A. Trujillo  and Michael E. Brown|work=California Institute of Technology, Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences|year=2007|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v566n2/15859/15859.html|
accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref> The points at which a planet crosses above and below the ecliptic are called its [[ascending node|ascending]] and [[descending node]]s.<ref name="young"/> Other orbital elements used to describe the orientation of a planet's orbit within our Solar System include the ''[[argument of periapsis]]'' and ''[[longitude of the ascending node]]''.<ref name="young"/>

====Rotation====
The planets also rotate around invisible axes through their centres. A planet's [[rotation period]] is known as its [[day]]. All planets in the Solar System rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, except for Venus, which [[Retrograde and direct motion|rotates clockwise]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Rotation of Venus: Period Estimated from Radar Measurements|author=R. M. Goldstein and R. L. Carpenter|work=JPL|year=1963|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/139/3558/910|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>  (Uranus is generally said to be rotating clockwise as well<ref>{{cite web|title=Rotational properties of Uranus and Neptune|author=MJS Belton, RJ Terrile|work=Kitt Peak National Observatory|year=1984|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984urnp.nasa..327B|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref> though because of its extreme axial tilt, it can be said to be rotating either clockwise or anti-clockwise, depending on whether one states it to be inclined 82° from the ecliptic in one direction, or 98° in the opposite direction).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Outer Worlds; Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Beyond|pages=195-206|year=2006|author=Michael P. Borgia|publisher=Springer New York}}</ref> There is great variation in the length of day between the planets, with Venus taking 243 Earth days to rotate, and the gas giants only a few hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Planet tables|url=http://www.astronomynotes.com/tables/tablesb.htm|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref> The rotational periods of extrasolar planets are not known; however their close proximity to their stars means that hot Jupiters are [[tidal lock|tidelocked]]; their orbits are in sync with their rotations. This means they only ever show one face to their stars, with one side in perpetual day, the other in perpetual night.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnetically-Driven Planetary Radio Emissions and Application to Extrasolar Planets|author=Philippe Zarka, Rudolf A. Treumann  et al.|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l4w8431457216474/|year=2001|accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>

====Axial tilt====
Planets also have varying degrees of [[axial tilt]]; they lie at an angle to the [[reference plane|plane]] of the [[inclination|their stars' equators]]. This causes the amount of light received by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore possesses [[season]]s; changes to the climate over the course of its year. The point at which each hemisphere is farthest or nearest from its star is known as its [[solstice]]. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices.<ref name=Weather>{{cite web

 | accessdate=2007-09-09 }}</ref> Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are  not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to possess negligible to no axial tilt, as a result of their proximity to their stars.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obliquity Tides on Hot Jupiters|author=Joshua N.

====Orbital clearance====
The defining dynamic characteristic of a planet is that it has [[Cleared the neighborhood|cleared its neighborhood]]. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s official [[2006 definition of planet|definiton of a planet]] in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as [[Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] from full-fledged planethood, making them instead [[dwarf planet]]s.<ref name=IAU /> Although to date this criterion only applies to our Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Total Number of Giant Planets in Debris Disks with Central Clearings|author=Peter Faber & Alice C. Quillen|work=Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Rochester|year=2007|url=http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0706/0706.1684v1.pdf|accessdate=2007-09-15}}</ref>

===Physical characteristics===

====Mass====
A planet's defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the [[electromagnetic]] forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape,  but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dwarf Planets|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets/|author=Mike Brown|work=CalTech|year=2006|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>

Mass is also the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from [[star]]s. The upper mass limit for planethood, beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for [[nuclear fusion]], is roughly 13 times Jupiter's mass. No objects of such mass exist in our Solar System; however a number of extrasolar planets lie at that threshold. The [[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia]] lists the largest planets discovered to date as [[HD 38529 c]], at 12.7 Jupiter masses, [[AB Pic b]], at 13.5 Jupiter masses, [[HD 162020 b]] at 13.75 Jupiter masses, and [[HD 13189 b]], at 14 Jupiter masses. A number of objects of higher mass are also listed, but since they lie above the fusion threshold, they would be better described as [[brown dwarfs]].<ref name=threshold>{{cite web| url=? |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog|work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia|year=2007|accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref> 

The smallest known planet, excluding dwarf planets and satellites, is [[PSR B1257+12]] a, one of the first extrasolar planets discovered, which was found in 1992 in orbit around a [[pulsar]]. Its mass is roughly half that of the planet Mercury.<ref name=threshold />

====Internal differentiation====
Every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a [[Planetary differentiation|differentiated]] interior consisting of a dense [[planetary core]] surrounded by a [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] which either is or was a [[fluid]]. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard [[Crust (geology)|crusts]],<ref name=terrestrial>{{cite web|title=Planetary Interiors|work=Department of Physics, University of Oregon|url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec16.html|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref>  but in the gas giants the mantle simply dissolves into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets possess cores of magnetic elements such as [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and mantles of [[silicates]]. [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are believed to possess cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of [[metallic hydrogen]].<ref>{{cite book

====Atmospheres====
All of the planets have [[atmosphere]]s as their large masses mean gravity is strong enough to keep gaseous particles close to the surface. The larger gas giants are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases [[Hydrogen]] and [[Helium]] close by, although these gases mostly float into [[space]] around the smaller planets.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheppard|first=Scott S.|coauthors=Jewitt, David; Kleyna, Jan|title=An Ultradeep Survey for Irregular Satellites of Uranus: Limits to Completeness|journal=The Astronomical Journal| volume=129|pages=518-525| url=http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/0410/0410059v1.pdf|format=PDF|year=2006| doi=10.1086/426329}}</ref> Earth's atmosphere is greatly different to the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired there have introduced massive amounts of free [[oxygen]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Earth's Atmosphere: Composition and Structure|author=Anne E.

===Secondary characteristics===
Planets in our Solar System possess orbital resonances in their own right. Many have [[natural satellite]]s, often called "moons."  Mercury and Venus have no moons, the Earth has one, and Mars has two, but the [[gas giant]]s all have numerous moons in complex planetary systems. Many gas giant moons have similar features to the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets, and some have been studied for signs of life.<ref name=Grasset2000>{{cite journal | author = Grasset, O., Sotin C., Deschamps F., | title = On the internal structure and dynamic of Titan|year = 2000 | journal = Planetary and Space Science | volume = 48| pages = 617–636|doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(00)00039-8}}</ref><ref name=Fortes2000>{{cite journal | journal = Icarus | volume= 146 | issue = 2 | pages = 444–452 | year=  2000 | doi = 10.1006/icar.2000.6400 | title =  Exobiological implications of a possible ammonia-water ocean inside Titan | author = Fortes, A.D.}}</ref><ref>Jones, N.; [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1647 ''Bacterial explanation for Europa's rosy glow''], NewScientist.com ([[11 December]] [[2001]])</ref> 

The four largest planets in the Solar System are also orbited by [[planetary rings]] of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny '[[moonlet]]s' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely known, they are believed to be the result of natural satellites which fell below their parent planet's [[Roche limit]] and were torn apart by [[tidal forces]].<ref>{{cite journal

No secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets. However the [[sub-brown dwarf]] [[Cha 110913-773444]], which has been described as a [[rogue planet]], is believed to be orbited by a tiny [[protoplanetary disc]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A planet with planets?
