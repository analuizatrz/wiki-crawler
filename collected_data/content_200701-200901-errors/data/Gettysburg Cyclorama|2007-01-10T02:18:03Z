The '''Gettysburg National Military Park Cyclorama Center''' is the home of the "[[Battle of Gettysburg]]" [[Cyclorama]], a 360 degree circular oil-on-canvas painting that depicts "[[Pickett's Charge]]," the climactic Confederate attack on the Union center on [[July 3]], [[1863]]. Completed and exhibited in [[1884]], it is one of the last surviving cycloramas in the United States.

The culmination of the battle was captured on canvas by the French artist Paul Philippoteaux, a professional cyclorama painter and artist. Philippoteaux was not present at Gettysburg, but came to the United States in [[1879]] when he was hired by a group of entrepreneurs to paint this monumental work. Philippoteaux came to Gettysburg in [[1882]] armed with a sketchbook, pencils, pens, and a simple guide book to help him locate the site of the climactic charge. The artist spent several weeks on the battlefield, observing details of the terrain and making hundreds of sketches. Philippoteaux was also lucky enough to interview a number of veterans of the battle, who helped with suggestions on how to depict the chaos of battle.  Philippoteaux included himself in the painting,  wearing the uniform of a Union colonel. 

The phenomenal work took over a year and one-half to complete. The "Cyclorama of the Battle of Gettysburg" opened to the public in [[Chicago]] in [[1883]], complete with a three-dimensional earthen foreground littered with the relics of battle, stone walls, shattered trees, and broken fences.

The Gettysburg Cyclorama closed in November [[2005]] to under go a projected nine million dollar rehabilitation project that began in [[2003]]. Conservation specialists will repair unstable sections of the canvas and restore original details lost in the numerous repair and preservation attempts. Eventually it will be hung in its own unique viewing auditorium with a restored skyline and foreground, in the new National Park Service Visitor Center and Museum at [[Gettysburg]], scheduled to open in late [[2007]].
