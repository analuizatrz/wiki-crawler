== Production ==
In March of 2004, with ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' being released the coming June, [[Marvel Studios]] had begun developing ''Spider-Man 3'' for a release date of 2007.<ref>{{cite news | author=Nicole Laporte | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117901100.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Spidey spins web for a third time | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2004-03-02]] | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>  By the release of ''Spider-Man 2'', a release date for ''Spider-Man 3'' had been set for [[May 2]], [[2007]] before production on the sequel had begun.<ref>{{cite news | author=Gabriel Snyder | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117907347.html?categoryid=10&cs=1 | title=Spidey swings to new heights | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2004-07-05]] |  accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref> The date was later changed to [[May 4]]. In January 2005, Sony Pictures Entertainment completed a seven-figure deal with screenwriter [[Alvin Sargent]], who had penned ''Spider-Man 2'', to work on ''Spider-Man 3'' with an option to write a fourth film.<ref>{{cite news | author=Nicole Laporte | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117916239.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Sargent to spin more Spidey tales | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2005-01-12]] | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>  For the sequel, Sargent brought back Harry Osborn as a more formidable adversary for Spider-Man.  While Harry Osborn had been depicted as taking up his father's Green Goblin mantle in most non-film stories, or the [[Harry Osborn#Ultimate Harry Osborn|Ultimate Hobgoblin]] in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] comics continuity, Raimi had said at [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2006 that Harry would be neither, but instead "somewhere between".<ref>{{cite news | author=Larry Carroll | url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1537122/07252006/story.jhtml | title='Spider-Man 3' Cast Confirms Love Triangle, Death, Soul-Sucking Costume | publisher=[[MTV]] | date=[[2006-07-26]] | accessdate=2006-08-27 }}</ref>  Raimi ultimately titled Harry Osborn the New Goblin, with the character being equipped with a glider called the Sky Stick.<ref name="premiere">{{cite news | author=Tom Roston | url=http://www.premiere.com/features/3346/the-secrets-of-spider-man-3.html | title=The Secrets of Spider-Man 3 | publisher=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] | pages=62,65, 118 | date=January/February 2007 | accessdate=2006-12-14 }}</ref>  Actor [[James Franco]], who portrays Harry in the film, described the character's villainy as realistic: "It's not just that he turns dark just because it's fun.

''Spider-Man 3'' also introduces the film version of [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], in whom Tobey Maguire originally expressed personal interest as a future adversary for Spider-Man during press for ''Spider-Man 2''.<ref>{{cite news | author=Chris Hewitt | title=Spidey's back | publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=August 2004 | accessdate=2006-11-10 }}</ref> [[Thomas Haden Church]] was approached for the role because of his award-winning performance in ''[[Sideways]]''.<ref name="enter">{{cite news | author=Edward Douglas | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=4599 | title= Exclusive: Enter Sandman! | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=[[2006-08-01]] | accessdate=2006-08-25 }}</ref> After being cast, Church worked out for 16 months to improve his physique for the role.<ref>{{cite news | author=Scott Huver | url=http://www.hollywood.com/movies/feature/id/3538354 | title=Weaving the Web of 'Spider-Man 3', Part Two: Thomas Hayden Church, Topher Grace and Bryce Dallas Howard | publisher=Hollywood.com | accessdate=2006-08-24 }}</ref> In an August 2006 interview, Church had described the film's Sandman as a villain with more depth than the character had in comics, adding that Sandman's issues brought the character into conflict with Spider-Man.<ref name="enter" />

Eddie Brock, Junior, the human part of Venom, would serve as a mirror to Peter Parker. Both characters had similar employment and romantic interests, though Brock differed from Parker in having a "terrible childhood".<ref name="igncon" />

Reportedly, the film's budget is $250 million, which would make it the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film]] ever made in nominal [[U.S. dollar]]s, breaking ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'s'' budget record of $207 million.
