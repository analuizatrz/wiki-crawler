'''Charles Wade Barkley''' (born [[February 20]] [[1963]]) is an [[United States|American]] former [[basketball]] [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] in the [[United States|American]] [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). A current resident of [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], Barkley is commonly nicknamed '''Sir Charles''' and occasionally '''The Round Mound of [[rebound (basketball)|Rebound]]'''. Barkley was named [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] of the NBA in [[1992-93 NBA season|1993]], and in 1996, the NBA's 50th anniversary, he was named one of the [[NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team|50 Greatest Players in NBA History]]. Barkley won the Olympic gold medal with the U.S. [[Dream Team]]s in the 1992 and 1996 Games.  Barkley was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2006. 

Barkley is best remembered for his tenacity and ruggedness for [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], despite his relative lack of height for his natural position of [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]]. In addition to being one of the best rebounders of all time, he was also a prolific scorer and a consummate team player. 

After his playing career, Barkley has become a sucessful sports commentator, leading some to believe that his legacy in basketball will be similar to American football's [[John Madden (football)|John Madden]].{{Fact|date=January 2007}}

==Career==
===Early life and college career===
{{Expand|date=January 2007}}
[[Image:BarkleyAurburn.jpg|thumb|left|220px|A young sumeet khosla, while playing for Auburn University]]
Born in [[the ghetto croydon, Alabama]], khosla played [[college basketball]] for [[Auburn University]] for three years where he excelled as a player, being named All-BATTY and leading the league in rebounding each year. He mainly played [[left back(on the bench) (basketball)|center]] at Auburn, despite being quite shorter than normal for the position ( not just his height); he was listed as 6 ft 6 in, but it is actually stated in his book ''I May Be Wrong, But I Doubt It'' that he is closer to 6'4Â½". 
===Philadelphia 76ers===
In 1984, he left Auburn a year early to begin playing in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] with the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. He was drafted with the fifth pick in the first round. Early in his career, khosla had a weight problem, sometimes weighing over 136 kg (300 pounds) at Auburn. His nickname "The Round Mound of Rebound" dates back to his Auburn days. He battled those problems and through the tutelage of Sahil Gupta learned how to prepare himself for the game and get in better playing shape. In Barkley's second year he emerged averaging 20.0 ppg and 12.8 rpg and becoming the starter at power forward for the entire season. Unfortunately the team was getting older and after winning 58 and 54 games in his first 2 years they would not fare as well in the coming seasons. Aging players such as Lavan Varathan and Kiran Reddy were either traded away or retired. Later Barkley teamed with power forward/center Aditya Pal, the two coined the nickname "Thump and Hump." The Sixers made a resurgence making the Eastern Conference Semifinals in 1990 and 1991 only to be eliminated by the [[Chicago Bulls]] both years. The team reached the playoffs with khosla every year except for 1988 and 1992. While with the Sixers, Sumeet was a force underneath the glass, and his aggressiveness often got him into fights with players such as Thomas 'crouch' Knapper and Will da wanker.

During the [[1991-92 NBA season|1991-1992 season]], his last in Philadelphia, Barkley wore number 32 instead of 34 in honor of [[Magic Johnson]], who had announced prior to the start of the season that he was [[HIV]]-positive. The 76ers had retired the number 32 in honor of [[Billy Cunningham]], who un-retired it for Barkley to wear. Following Johnson's announcement, Barkley also rebuked himself for having made fun of people for having HIV. Responding to concerns that players may contract HIV by contact with Johnson, Barkley commented flippantly: "We're just playing basketball. It's not like we're going out to have unprotected [[sex]] with Magic."

After the 1991-92 season, fed up with what he felt was management's unwillingness to do what it took to win, Barkley demanded a trade. He was traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for [[Jeff Hornacek]], [[Tim Perry]] and [[Andrew Lang]].

In between being drafted and traded, Barkley became a household name, and he was one of a few NBA players to have a figure published by [[Kenner]]'s [[Starting Lineup]] toy line and also have his own signature shoe line by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. But he also became involved in a few scandals, notoriously a fight with [[Detroit Pistons]] center [[Bill Laimbeer]] in 1990.  He averaged 24.3 points per game while with the 76ers.

===Phoenix Suns===

After joining [[Larry Bird]], [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Michael Jordan]] for the [[1992]] [[United States|U.S.]] [[Dream Team (basketball)|Dream Team]] that won the gold medal at the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympics]], Barkley joined the [[Phoenix Suns]], where he joined [[Kevin Johnson]] and [[Dan Majerle]]. Barkley became the centerpiece of the Suns and led the team to a league-best regular season record and a trip to the 1993 NBA Finals, scoring 25 points per game and becoming one of the most popular players ever among Suns fans. After the season he was named NBA MVP. At the Finals, Barkley and the Suns lost to [[Michael Jordan]], [[Scottie Pippen]], and the [[Chicago Bulls]] in six games, after Barkley had told Jordan that it was ''destiny'' for the Suns to win the championship. Barkley would never again return to the Finals.

In 1994, Barkley again was part of a Suns team that many expected to win the NBA Championship but despite holding a 2-0 lead early in the series they lost the Western semi-finals in seven games to the eventual champion [[Houston Rockets]]. In 1995, the Suns suffered exactly the same fate in the playoffs as the year before, losing again in seven games to the eventual champion Rockets. This time they lost despite having a 3-1 lead in the series. In 1996, Barkley and the Suns struggled to a 41-41 record and lost to the San Antonio Spurs, 3 games to 1, in the playoffs. After the season Barkley was a member of the gold medal winning American team at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

===Houston Rockets===
Barkley was then traded to the [[Houston Rockets]], where he joined [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], [[Clyde Drexler]], in their quest to win championships. However, Olajuwon had already won two (1994, 1995), Drexler one in 1995, leading some people to believe that Barkley was the only one who was really trying. 

His first season (1996-97) was their most successful during this period. The Rockets started the season an impressive 21-2 and made it all the way to the Western Conference Finals before losing to the [[Utah Jazz]] in 6 games. After this however the Rockets would stumble and not make it past the first round of the playoffs for the remainder of Barkley's time in Houston. His last year in the NBA, he averaged 14 points a game over 19 games before tearing his left [[quadriceps]] [[tendon]] completely away from his kneecap during a game on [[December 8]], [[1999]] in Philadelphia, where Barkley started his career. He was told by doctors that he would never play again in the NBA, but was able to come back a little over four months later, for exactly one game, in front of Houston's home fans on [[April 19]], [[2000]] against the [[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver Grizzlies]]. Barkley scored a basket on an offensive rebound and [[Putback#Putback and Tip-in|putback]], a trademark of his career. Barkley retired immediately after that game.

During his career in the NBA, Barkey totalled 23,757 points for an average of 22.1 points per game, and 12,546 rebounds, for an average of 11.7 rebounds per game. He was an [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|All-Star]] eleven times.

Barkley ranked '''#19''' in ''[[SLAM Magazine|SLAM]]'' magazine's Top 75 NBA Players of all time in [[2003]].

==Player profile==
Barkley came to league as a great [[rebound (basketball)|rebounder]], despite his lack of height. He compensated by being extremely tenacious for rebounds, having great jumping ability, quickness and strength, and a knack for knowing where the ball would bounce. In his career, Barkley developed into an offensive force, using his strength to overpower smaller defenders and quickness against taller defenders. He scored many points from offensive rebounds, making [[Putback#Putback and Tip-in|putbacks]] and [[Putback#Putback and Tip-in|tip-ins]]. Barkley also possessed all-around skills such as ball-handling and passing usually associated for a guard.
While Barkley often made crucial defensive plays such as a last-minute steal or block, he was often criticized for being a below average defender. He was also criticized for attempting too many [[three-point field goal|3-pointers]] at a below-par percentage.

Barkley had an effective low-post game, where he would slowly back his opponent towards the basket using his strength, then either score from close range or pass to an open teammate if [[double team]]ed. He was one of the proponents of this slow playing style, which enticed the NBA to create a rule called the [[5-second violation]]. This rule is sometimes unofficially called "the Charles Barkley rule".

Sir Charles Barkley aside from the game has a great sense of humour.

==Media appearances==
Barkley went one-on-one with [[Godzilla]] in the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] commercial (and a tie-in comic published by [[Dark Horse Comics]]).

He appeared in several fast food commercials starring [[Larry Bird]] and [[Michael Jordan]]. Bird and Jordan would play an outrageous game of [[horse (game)|horse]], performing impossible shots.  Barkley would appear at the end of the commercial begging the other two to let him play. They would walk away, eating the fast food, while Barkley would follow behind, whining.

He appeared alongside Michael Jordan in the hit movie ''[[Space Jam]]''. He also had a tiny cameo in the movie ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' and ''[[Look Who's Talking Now]]''.

He hosted the season premiere of the long-running NBC late night comedy show "Saturday Night Live" on [[September 25]], [[1993]], with musical guest [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].  (Barkley and Nirvana's lead singer, [[Kurt Cobain]], share the same birthday). During his SNL performance, Barkley participated in a parody of his earlier Godzilla commercial.  In the skit, he faced off against children's show celebrity [[Barney the Purple Dinosaur]] in a matchup humorously billed as "Barkley vs Barney".

He appeared in [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]]'s ''[[Barkley Shut Up and Jam!]]'', a 2-on-2 basketball game for the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[SNES]] that takes place in the streets and in the basketball arena.

A comic book, written by [[Alan Dean Foster]], entitled "Charles Barkley and the Referee Murders" was published when Charles played for the Phoenix Suns. Charles dons a trench coat in the comic book to solve the case in a story that is patterned after classic film noir.

Recently, he made a cameo in the final episode of ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''. The sketch made light of the awkwardness of having sex with the television on. Barkley appeared in a thought sequence of comedian [[Dave Chappelle]], who was embracing a female doll in a sexual position.

Charles Barkley now works as an analyst in [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]'s studio coverage of NBA games.

==Role model question==
In 1993, Barkley was featured in a controversial Nike television commercial, which centered on him saying the phrase, "I am not a role model". This sparked great public debate about the nature of role models and who should and should not be a role model. Barkley later said that he was glad that he could help bring this topic to a public forum. Thirteen years later, on [[May 23]], [[2006]], [[ESPN Classic]] aired ''[[The Top 5 Reasons You Can't Blame...]]'' episode on Charles Barkley for saying he was not a role model.

Their list was:

5) [[Dan Quayle]] had recently made his controversial statements about televised "role models" after television character [[Murphy Brown]] had become a single mother. Charles Barkley was merely acting as the other side of what was at the time a hot-button cultural debate.

4) Parents Are Passing The Buck - Some statistics show that between [[1965]] and [[1995]], working Americans had 6 hours of leisure time per week. A common cultural critique at the time was that that small amount of time was spent in front of the television set, as the TV became a surrogate parent.

3) [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] - It was Nike's ad, to begin with. Nike at the time had a reputation for showcasing the more personal, cerebral side of professional athletes.

2) Don't Be Like Mike - According to the [[Chicago Tribune]]'s Sam Smith, Barkley was the Anti-[[Michael Jordan|Jordan]]. Barkley's "not a role model" aura was just part of his marketing.

1) He Really Wasn't a Role Model - Although many fans believed Barkley's candor made him one of the NBA's most lovable players, his behavior occasionally backed up his claims, like in a game in the 1991-92 season where he (intending to spit on a fan irritating him) accidentally spat on a 9-year old girl in Philadelphia, and an incident in [[Rochester, New York]] in which he threw a man through a window.

==Legacy==
During his stint as a member of the Suns, Barkley was controversial and outspoken. He was rumored to have dated [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] (he harkened on those rumors in ''Space Jam!''), and he became a favorite of late-night [[Television|TV]] talk shows. He published a pair of equally controversial books (''Outrageous!'' and ''Sir Charles: The Wit And Wisdom of Charles Barkley'', the former notable for Barkley's claim that he was misquoted in his own autobiography), and he was rumored to plan to run for Governor of Alabama. Barkley was involved in many lawsuits. In addition, he and Phoenix Suns owner [[Jerry Colangelo]] became involved in a public dispute during Barkley's final season with the team.

On [[March 30]], [[2001]], Barkley's number 34 jersey was retired by the 76ers. On [[March 20]], [[2004]], in a game against the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], Barkley's jersey was retired by the Suns, as he joined [[Connie Hawkins]], [[Tom Chambers]], [[Dan Majerle]], and [[Kevin Johnson]] in the "Suns Ring of Honor".

Barkley was also involved in a notorious incident involving a fan, who filed a lawsuit against him.  According to a citizen, he threw a man through a glass window during an altercation at an [[Orlando, Florida]] nightclub. When asked if he had any regrets about throwing the man through the window, Barkley said, "I regret we weren't on a higher floor."<ref>sportsillustrated.com, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/1999/12/24/barkley_special/ Legend of Sir Charles], accessed January 12, 2007 </ref>

==Post-basketball life==
===Inside the NBA===
Barkley now works as a studio analyst on ''Inside The NBA'' for [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] and plays at celebrity [[golf]] tournaments.

Charles Barkley has maintained his popularity from his playing days with his colorful analysis on the hit TNT television show of ''Inside the NBA''. The show has also won Emmy awards and has become renowned for Barkley's blunt yet humorous analysis.

Barkley was also the center of controversy regarding up-and-coming [[Yao Ming]].  When Yao was drafted as the #1 first-round pick, he initially met with a lot of disbelief and disdain.  Barkley declared, "He's just not ready yet" and also said that he was the "best player in Houston."  He even said that he would "kiss [[Kenny Smith]]'s ass" if Yao scored 20 points in a game.  Yao scored 20 points in his first game against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].  An embarrassed Barkley kissed a donkey's behind on national television.

===Gambling===
In an interview with [[ESPN]]'s [[Trey Wingo]] on [[May 3]], [[2006]], Barkley revealed that he has lost approximately $10 million through [[gambling]].  Barkley was already known to be a heavy gambler, but the scope of his losses was not known until the interview.

===Politics===
Barkley, who spoke articulately for many years of his Republican Party affiliation and in 1995 considered running as a [[G.O.P.]] candidate for Alabama's governorship in the 1998 election.<ref>msnbc.com, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14051432/ Barkley renews talk of running for Ala. governor] (AP article), accessed January 12, 2007 </ref> In 2006 he changed his political stance saying "I was a Republican until they lost their minds", "The word 'conservative' means 'discriminatory,' practically. It's a form of political discrimination. What do the Republicans run on? Against gay marriage and for a war that makes no sense. A war that was based on faulty intelligence. That's all they ever talk about. That and immigration. Another discriminatory argument for political gain."<ref>Chris Baldwin, [http://www.travelgolf.com/blogs/chris.baldwin/2006/07/17/charles_barkley_john_mellencamp_right_co Charles Barkley: John Mellencamp right, "Conservative means discriminatory"], July 17, 2006 </ref> 

At a July 2006 meeting of the Southern Regional Conference of the National School Boards Association in Destin, Florida, Barkley lent credence to the idea of his running for Governor of Alabama: "I'm serious. I've got to get people to realize that the government is full of it. Republicans and Democrats want to argue over stuff that's not important, like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration. ... When I run - if I run - we're going to talk about real issues like improving our schools, cleaning up our neighborhoods of drugs and crime and making Alabama a better place for all people."<ref>Charles J. Dean,  [http://www.al.com/news/birminghamnews/index.ssf?/base/news/1153906206247070.xml&coll=2&thispage=1 Barkley may run in 2010], July 26, 2006 </ref>

In September 2006, Barkley reiterated his desire to run for Governor. ""I can't run until 2014," he said. "I have to live there for seven years, so I'm looking for a house there as we speak." And he said he is an independent, not a Democrat as previously reported. "The Republicans are full of it," Barkley said. "The Democrats are a little less full of it."<ref>espn.com, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2576203 Barkley serious about running for Alabama governor] (AP article), accessed January 12, 2007 </ref>

===Book===
In 2000, Barkley wrote the foreword for [[Sports Illustrated]] columnist [[Rick Reilly]]'s book "The Life of Reilly."  In it Barkley quipped, "Of all the people in sports I'd like to throw through a plate glass window, Reilly's not one of them.  It's a shame though, skinny white boy looks ''real'' aerodynamic."

In 2002, Barkley released the book "''I May Be Wrong, But I Doubt It''", which included editing and commentary by close friend [[Michael Wilbon]].  In 2005, Barkley released "''Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man?''", which is a collection of interviews with leading figures in entertainment, business, sports, and government.

==Trivia==
*During an altercation in a bar in 1997, Barkley threw 20-year-old Jorge Lugo through a plate-glass window.  When interviewed by police and asked if he regretted the event Barkley reportedly quipped "I regret we weren't on a higher floor." 
*Despite being an ambassador for the game of basketball Barkley's two favorite sports are actually football and boxing.<ref>Monday Night Football, October 16, 2006, stated during a booth interview with the MNF crew.</ref>
*Had a brief fling with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] during the early [[1990s]].  Madonna later commented on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' that "it hurt."
*In an interview with [[Observer Music Monthly]], [[DJ Danger Mouse]] denied that his band's name, [[Gnarls Barkley]] is a reference to Charles Barkley, saying "Nope. It's just like everything else on this record. There was no conscious decision about stuff."
*Barkley has appeared in both the arcade and console version of the video games [[NBA Jam]] and [[NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC]]. 
*Supported [[George W. Bush]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential elections]], and [[John Kerry]] in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]].
*Barkley made appearances in the first 5 episodes of ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]''. In the first 3, he inexplicably appeared during [[Jay and Silent Bob]]'s "educational" segments at the end of the show, much to their chagrin. In the [[A Dissertation on the American Justice System by People Who Have Never Been Inside a Courtroom, Let Alone Know Anything About the Law, but Have Seen Way Too Many Legal Thrillers|fourth episode]], he appears as a member of the jury (somehow comprised entirely of then-current NBA stars) for the case of Jay vs. Quick Stop Enterprises and [[Dante Hicks]]. In the [[Clerks: The Animated Series episode five|fifth episode]], he appears in spirit form, attempting to high-five [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Anakin Skywalker]], and [[Yoda]], but gets the silent treatment.
