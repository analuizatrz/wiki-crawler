"'''Being Boring'''" is a single by the British pop group the [[Pet Shop Boys]]. As the second single from the 1990 album ''[[Behaviour (album)|Behaviour]]'', after "So Hard" which was released before the album, "Being Boring" was not particular successful upon release, reaching only number twenty in the [[UK singles chart]] and being the first single released by the group not to get into the top ten since "[[Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)]]" four years previously. Despite this, "Being Boring" has been a regularly-played song at concerts since its release. 

The song is concerned with the idea of growing up and how people's perceptions and values change as they grow older.

The video, the first by fashion-photographer [[Bruce Weber]], totally in black and white, shows a house party and begins with a nude swimmer and a message: "I came from Newcastle in the North of England. We used to have lots of parties where everyone got dressed up and on one party invitation was the quote 'she was never bored because she was never boring'. The song is about growing up - the ideals that you have when you're young and how they turn out".

The [[Zelda Fitzgerald]] quotation in question is actually "she refused to be bored chiefly because she wasnâ€™t boring".

Australian singer [[Merril Bainbridge]] [[cover version|covered]] the song as the tenth track from her debut album ''[[The Garden (Merril Bainbridge album)|The Garden]]'' released in [[1995]].
