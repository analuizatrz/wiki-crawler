The '''T206 Honus Wagner baseball card''' is a rare [[baseball card]] that is the most valuable baseball card in history. The card was designed and issued by the [[American Tobacco Company]] (ATC) from 1909 to 1911. The Wagner card was part of the [[T206]] series of cards for 524 baseball players in the [[American League|American]] and [[National League]]s, 76 of whom would later be inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Wong | first=Stephen | title=Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections | publisher= [[HarperCollins]]| location=New York, New York | year = 2005|isbn=0-06-083851-5 | pages=p66 }}</ref>

==Background==
The American Tobacco Company was formed as a result of an 1889 merger between industrialist [[James Buchanan Duke]]'s W. Duke & Sons & Company and four other major cigarette manufacturers — [[Allen & Ginter]], [[Goodwin & Company]], F. S. Kinney Company and William S. Kimball & Company. The company became monopolistic in the tobacco industry, and as a result, ATC did not have to conduct advertising or promotions for their products. Since baseball cards were primarily used as a sales promotion, the complete removal of these cards from ATC's tobacco packs almost drove baseball cards to obsolescence.<ref>{{cite book | last=O'Keeffe | first=Michael |coauthors=Teri Thompson| title=The Card: Collectors, Con Men, and the True Story of History's Most Desired Baseball Card | publisher= [[HarperCollins]]| location=New York, New York | year = 2007|isbn=0-06-112392-7 | pages=p32 }}</ref> During the presidency of [[trust-busting|trust-buster]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the ATC was subjected to legal action from the government, in hopes of shutting down the monopoly in the industry. 

The ATC was back in competition with other tobacco companies, and they reinserted baseball cards into cigarette packs. In 1909, the company introduced the T206 series, also known as the "white border set", of baseball cards of 524 players into their cigarette packs.<ref>O'Keeffe and Thompson (2007), p29.</ref> The cards were printed at seven factories in New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia.<ref name="p33">O'Keeffe and Thompson (2007), p33.</ref> Two years later, the ATC was broken up into several major companies as part of the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling in ''United States v. The American Tobacco Company'' [[Case citation|221 U.S. 106]] ([[1911]]).<ref>{{cite web

==Physical attributes and production==
The typical card in the T206 series had a width of 1 7/16 inches (3.65 cm) and a height of 2 5/8 inches (6.67 cm).<ref name="p33"/> Some cards were awkwardly shaped or irregularly sized, which prompted a belief that many of the cards in the series had been altered at one point or another. In his work ''Inside T206: A Collector Guide to the Classic Baseball Card Set'', Scot A. Reader wrote that "[i]t is not at all uncommon to find T206 examples that have been altered at some point during their near-century of existence."<ref>Reader (2006), p13.</ref> These discrepancies were taken advantage of by "card doctors" who trimmed corners and dirty edges to convalesce the appearance of the card. The front of the Wagner's card, and all other T206 series cards, contained a [[lithography|lithograph]] of the player.<ref>Reader (2006), p11.</ref> The lithographs were created through a multi-stage printing process. In the process, a number of colors were placed on top of each to create a lithograph with the appropriate design. 


The backs of the cards featured the monochromatic colors of the 16 tobacco brands the cards were printed for.<ref>Reader (2006), p12.</ref> The Wagner cards, in particular, which advertised the Piedmont and Sweet Caporal brands of cigarettes, were produced at Factory 25 in Virginia, as indicated by the factory stamp imprinted on the back of the cards.<ref>{{cite book | last=Reader | first=Scot A. | title=Inside T206: A Collector's Guide to the Classic Baseball Card Set | publisher= | location= | year = 2006 |isbn= |edition = 3rd edition| url=http://www.oldcardboard.com/t/t206/InsideT206-3-edition.pdf | pages=p45 }}</ref>

==Wagner's involvement==
Starting from January 1909, the ATC sought authorization from baseball players for insertion in the T206 series.<ref>Reader (2006), p9.</ref> Wagner was at the top of his game in 1909, and he was even considered to be the game's greatest player. He had appeared on advertisements for an number of other products such as chewing gum, gunpowder and soft drinks. Unsurprisingly, the ATC asked for Wagner's permission to have his picture on a baseball card. According to an [[October 12]], [[1912]] issue of ''[[The Sporting News]]'', Wagner did not give his consent to appear on the baseball card. In response to the authorization request letter sent by John Gruber, a Pittsburgh sportswriter hired by the ATC to seek Wagner's permission, Wagner wrote that he "did not care to have
his picture in a package of cigarettes." He threatened to seek legal action against ATC if they went ahead and created his baseball card.<ref>{{cite news |first= Davis |last= Ralph S.|title=Wagner A Wonder: One Player In Game Who Is Not Money Mad |url=http://www.explorepahistory.com/~expa/cms/pbfiles/Project1/Scheme40/ExplorePAHistory-a0b9s7-a_514.pdf |publisher=[[The Sporting News]] |date=1912-10-12 |accessdate=2007-10-19 }}</ref>

Wagner's strong negative reaction to the ATC's request has been the subject of much speculation. The most common myth is that he rejected the deal because he did not want young baseball fans to purchase the tobacco packs for his baseball card. Wagner held high respect for many of his fans, most particularly his young fans. His granddaughter, Blair, remarked that "[h]e loved children. He wanted to teach kids good sportsmanship. When it came time for that card to come out, it wasn't that he wasn't paid. He didn't want kids to have to buy tobacco to get his card."<ref>O'Keeffe and Thompson (2007), p39.</ref> However, Wagner [[chewing tobacco|chewed tobacco]], and he had previously appeared in advertisements for many tobacco products, including a cigar baseball trading card in 1899 and a newspaper ad for Murad cigarettes during the [[1909 World Series]].<ref>O'Keeffe and Thompson (2007), p37.</ref> 

Another explanation surmised is that Wagner did not consent because he felt he was not receiving just compensation from the ATC for his baseball card.<ref>O'Keeffe and Thompson (2007), p36.</ref> Wagner had a history of being a tough negotiator. He had announced his retirement from baseball in December 1907, but returned shortly before the start of the 1908 baseball season after receiving a [[United States dollar|US$]] 10,000 contract — double his salary from the 1907 season.<ref>O'Keeffe and Thompson (2007), pp37-38.</ref> This theory has its flaws, though, because Wagner sent Gruber a check for $US 10 to compensate him for the fee ATC would have paid him if Wagner had given permission to create his baseball card. Michael O'Keeffe and Teri Thompson, authors of ''The Card: Collectors, Con Men, and the True Story of History's Most Desired Baseball Card'', asked why Wagner would compensate Gruber for 10 dollars, a substantial amount of money at the time, if he refused authorization for monetary reasons.<ref>O'Keeffe and Thompson (2007), p38.</ref>

The ATC had already produced a number of T206 Honus Wagner baseball cards — the exact number is unknown, but is speculated to be between 50 and 200<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com/2100-1017-242804.html|title=eBay invokes new rules for baseball card auction|accessdate=2007-10-19|date=2000-07-05|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|publisher=[[CNET]]}}</ref> — but they stopped production of the card after Wagner denied authorization.
