Hubbard was a highly controversial public figure during his lifetime.

==Early life==

L. Ron Hubbard was born in 1911 in [[Tilden, Nebraska]].

His father Harry Ross Hubbard was born Henry August Wilson in [[Fayette, Iowa]], but was [[orphan]]ed as an infant and adopted by the Hubbards, a farming family of [[Fredericksburg, Iowa]]. He joined the [[United States Navy]] in [[1904]], leaving the service in [[1908]], then re-enlisted in [[1917]] when the United States [[World War I|declared war on Germany]]. He served in the Navy until 1946, reaching the rank of [[Lieutenant-Commander]] in [[1934]].<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 70 -->

His mother Ledora May Hubbard (née Waterbury) was a [[feminist]] who had trained to become a [[high school]] teacher and married Harry in 1909. Her father, Lafayette O. Waterbury (born [[1864]]), was a [[veterinarian]] turned coal merchant. Her mother, Ida Corinne DeWolfe, was the daughter of affluent banker John DeWolfe. May's paternal grandfather, Abram Waterbury, was from the [[Catskill Mountains]], and later headed West, employed as a [[veterinarian]].<ref name=bio77>[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio00.html Biography issued 7 April 1977 by Liz Gablehouse, Church of Scientology][http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio01.html pg.1],[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio02.html pg.2],[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio03.html pg.3],[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio04.html pg.4],[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio05.html pg.5],[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio06.html pg.6],[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio07.html pg.7]</ref><ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 8-9 -->

The Hubbards moved first to [[Kalispell, Montana]] and then to [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], the state capital. Church biographies have stated that during this period Hubbard became the protegé of "Old Tom, a [[Blackfoot]] Indian medicine man ... [who] passe[d] on much of the tribal lore to his young friend" and that at the age of four, he was "honored with the status of blood brother of the Blackfeet in a ceremony that is still recalled by tribal elders."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.scientology.org/html/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/chronicle/index.html | title = L.

The white Blackfeet historian Hugh Dempsey has commented that the act of [[blood brother]]hood was "never done among the Blackfeet", and Blackfeet Nation officials have disavowed attempts to "re-establish" Hubbard as a "blood brother" of the Blackfeet.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/la90/la90-1e.html | title = Staking a Claim to Blood Brotherhood | accessdate = 2007-05-12 | author = Joel Sappell | coauthors = Robert W.

Harry Ross Hubbard's naval career led to the family moving several more times, first to [[San Diego]], then to [[Oakland, California]] followed by [[Puget Sound]] in the state of [[Washington]] and finally to [[Washington, D.C.]]. During this period L. Ron Hubbard joined the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] at the age of 13. Church biographies routinely state that he was "the nation's youngest Eagle Scout."<ref name="chronicle01">{{cite web | url = http://www.scientology.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/chronicle/pg001.html | title = L.

According to his first son, [[Ronald DeWolf|L. Ron Hubbard Jr.]], when Hubbard Sr. was sixteen and living in D.C. he obtained a copy of the [[Book of the Law]], by [[Alistair Crowley]], which introduced him to the world of [[Occultism]], [[black magic]], and [[Satanism]], a tradition which  Hubbard Jr. claims greatly influenced his life at home and the teachings of Scientology.<ref>{{cite journal

Between [[1927]] and [[1929]], Hubbard traveled twice to the [[Far East]] to visit his parents during his father's posting to the [[United States Navy]] base on [[Guam]]. Church biographies published from the [[1950s]] to the [[1970s]] stated that with "the financial support of his wealthy grandfather" Hubbard journeyed throughout [[Asia]], "studying with holy men" in northern [[China]],  [[India]] and [[Tibet]].<ref name="certainty">"L.

[[Image:China text hubbard.gif|thumb|One of Hubbard's controversial journal entries during his visit to China in 1928]]

Hubbard sometimes displayed attitudes that were at odds with the picture his followers try to present of him.  For instance, during his visit to China at the age of seventeen, he made diary entries such as: "As a [[Chinaman]] can not live up to a thing, he always drags it down."<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 41 --> and "They smell of all the baths they didnt {{sic}} take.

Ron Hubbard, Journal entries in 1928</ref>  Similarly, Hubbard described the Lama temples as "miserably cold and very shabby . . . The people worshiping have voices like bull-frogs and beat a drum and play a brass horn to accompany their singing (?)"<ref name="Bare-faced"/><!--p. 42--> and called them "very odd and heathenish".<ref name="MBTR"/>  He also wrote about [[colored]] people: "Unlike the yellow and brown people, the white does not usually believe he can get attention from matter or objects. The yellow and brown believe for the most part ... that rocks, trees, walls, etc., can give them attention"<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron, ''Scientology: Fundamentals of Thought''. Copenhagen: New Era Publications, 1997. ISBN 1900944979, p. 24</ref> and "...so we see the African tribesman, with his complete contempt for the truth, and his emphasis on brutality and savagery..."<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron, ''Scientology: Fundamentals of Thought''. Copenhagen: New Era Publications, 1997. ISBN 1900944979, p. 77</ref>

While such attitudes might not be especially surprising for a teenager born in [[1911]], they are vastly at odds with the stories he would later tell and his followers would repeat: "Among other wonders, Ron told of watching monks meditate for weeks on end, contemplating higher truths ... he took advantage of this unique opportunity to study Far Eastern culture. ... he befriended and learned ... a thoroughly insightful Beijing magician who represented the last of the line of Chinese magicians from the court of [[Kublai Khan]].  ... Old Mayo was also well versed in China’s ancient wisdom that had been handed down from generation to generation. Ron passed many evenings in the company of such wise men, eagerly absorbing their words ... he closely examined the surrounding culture. In addition to the local Tartar tribes, he spent time with nomadic bandits originally from [[Mongolia]] ... [t]hese sojourns in Asia and the Pacific islands had a profound effect, giving Ron a subjective understanding of [[Eastern philosophy]] ... the world itself was his classroom, and he studied in it voraciously, recording what he saw and learned in his ever-present diaries, which he carefully preserved for future reference."<ref name="WiS98">{{cite book | author = Compiled by staff of the Church of Scientology International | year = 1998 | title = What is Scientology? | edition=1998 | publisher = Bridge Publications, Inc. | location = Los Angeles, California | id = ISBN 1-57318-122-6}}</ref><!--p.30-32--><ref>{{cite web| url=http://lron.hubbard.org/pg003.html |title=1923-1929: On the road to discovery |work=L.

While in Guam<ref name="aapsa" /> Hubbard was befriended by Commander [[Joseph Cressman Thompson|Joseph "Snake" Thompson]] (1876-1943), who {{interp|had}} recently returned from Vienna and studies with Sigmund Freud and was stationed as a member of the Naval Medical Corps.<ref name="aapsa">[http://www.aapsa.org/forum/forum43_1.html#4312 The American Academy of Psychoanalysis], ''The Psychoanalytic Roots of Scientology'' by Silas L.

Hubbard married [[Margaret Grubb|Margaret "Polly" Grubb]] in 1933, with whom he fathered two children, [[Ronald DeWolf|L. Ron, Jr.]] (1934 &ndash; 1991) and Katherine May (born in [[1936]]). They lived in [[Los Angeles, California]] and, during the late [[1930s]], in [[Bremerton, Washington]]. L. Ron, Jr. said in a [[1983]] interview, "according to him and my mother" he was the result of a failed abortion and recalls at six years old seeing his father performing an abortion on his mother with a coat hanger. In the same interview, he said "Scientology is a power-and-money-and-intelligence-gathering game" and described his father as "only interested in money, sex, booze, and drugs."<ref>[http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/penthouse-LRonHubbardJr-interview-1983.htm Inside The Church of Scientology]</ref> DeWolf retracted most of his statements in a later sworn affidavit of July 1, 1987 (Ronald E.

In March [[1952]] L. Ron Hubbard married [[Mary Sue Hubbard]] (born Mary Sue Whipp) with whom he would remain until his death in [[1986]].

==Education==
After studies at Swavely Preparatory School in Manassas, Virginia, and graduating from Woodward School for Boys in 1930, Hubbard enrolled at the [[George Washington University]], where he majored in [[civil engineering]]. 
There he became associate editor of the University newspaper ''"The University Hatchet"''<ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/universityhatchet02.html "The University Hatchet"] of George Washington University, Vol. 28 , No. 33, May 24, 1932, lists L. Ron Hubbard as "Assistant Editor"</ref><ref>[http://www.gwhatchet.com/ "The Hatchet"]</ref> and was a member of many of the University's clubs and societies including the Twentieth Marine Corps Reserve and the George Washington College Company.<ref name=bio77>Biography issued 7 April 1977 by Liz Gablehouse</ref>
His grades varied widely, and university records show that he attended for only two years, was on academic probation for his second year, and left the University in 1932 without a degree. The Church of Scientology's official account of Hubbard's university career does not mention its premature conclusion.<ref name="chronicle1930-1933">"[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/chronicle/pg003.html L. Ron Hubbard: A Chronicle 1930-1933]", Church of Scientology International. Accessed 4 March 2007</ref><ref name=bio77 /> In June 1932 Hubbard says he headed the so called ''Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition''. The two-and-a-half-month, 5,000-mile voyage aboard the 200-foot, four-masted schooner "Doris Hamlin" with over fifty college students had the purpose of collecting floral and reptile specimens for the University of Michigan.<ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/universityhatchet01.html "The University Hatchet," May 24, 1932], "L.

Critics have questioned many of the claims that Hubbard and the Church of Scientology later made about his university years. According to the Church's official account, "Here he studies engineering and atomic and molecular physics and embarks upon a personal search for answers to the human dilemma. His first experiment concerning the structure and function of the mind is carried out while at the university."<ref name="chronicle1930-1933" /> One of his classes was indeed a second-year physics course entitled "Modern Physical Phenomena; Molecular and Atomic Physics", for which he received a grade of "F."<ref>{{cite paper | title = Official Transcript of the Record of Lafayette Ronald Hubbard | publisher = George Washington University | date = [[April 24]], [[1941]] | url = http://www.lermanet.com/L_Ron_Hubbard/mr142.htm | accessdate = 2006-07-30 }}</ref> On the basis of this class, however, Hubbard claimed to be a "nuclear physicist"<ref>Hubbard, "P.E.

Hubbard claims to have been educated at the [[Ivy league]] university, [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. In the preface for his 1951 book ''[[Science of Survival]]'', he thanks "my instructors in atomic and molecular phenomena, mathematics and the humanities at George Washington University and at Princeton". However, he was never a member of Princeton University's student body; instead, he participated in a four-month course in military government at the Naval Training School, located at Princeton during the [[Second World War]].<ref name="Bare-faced" />

The novel is centered around a character named Horace Hackett, who is a hyper-productive, multi-genre [[hack writer]] desperately trying to finish his latest [[potboiler]] to an ever-approaching deadline while (unknown to him) his friend Mike de Wolf is trapped inside the potboiler's action. Two of Horace's author friends, in Hubbard's novel, are named Winchester Remington Colt and Rene Lafayette after Hubbard's own pseudonyms.

{{main|L. Ron Hubbard's naval service}}

From the summer of 1941 to late 1945, during [[World War II]], Hubbard served in the United States Navy. Based on the representations of his experience overseas and as a writer,<ref>[http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/warhero/1941/410604.gif Recommendation] of interviewing officer that Hubbard be commissioned a Lt. Jg.</ref> he was able to skip the initial officer rank of [[Ensign (rank)#United States|Ensign]] and was commissioned a [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade]].  His service ended with an honorable discharge after one promotion and four decorations, but it was also marked by negative reports from his superiors<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 98-99 --><ref name="Blue Sky" /><!--p. 74--><ref name="MBTR" /> and a number of incidents of trouble.  In May 1943, while commanding the [[USS PC-815|USS ''PC-815'']] on her [[shakedown cruise]] to San Diego, Hubbard attacked what he believed to be two enemy submarines, ten miles off the coast of Oregon in a busy shipping lane.  The battle took two days and involved at least four other US vessels summoned for resupply and reinforcements,<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 102-105 --> but after reviewing instrument data, battle reports and interviews with the various captains, Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher]], Commander Northwest Sea Frontier concluded "An analysis of all reports convinces me that there was no submarine in the area. ... The Commanding Officers of all ships except the ''PC-815'' state they had no evidence of a submarine and do not think a submarine was in the area."<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 105 -->  In June 1943, Hubbard again got in trouble by anchoring the ''PC-815'' in Mexican territorial waters and conducting gunnery practice on the [[Coronado Islands]], owned by Mexico.  An official complaint from Mexico led to a Board of Investigation, which determined that Hubbard had disregarded orders, admonished him and transferred him to other duties where he was not given command authority.<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 106-107 --> 

Hubbard returned to writing fiction briefly for a few years, his best-remembered work from this period being the ''[[Ole Doc Methuselah]]'' series for Campbell's ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine. It was in the pages of this magazine that the first article on Dianetics appeared; while some fiction works appeared after that (including "Masters of Sleep," which promotes Dianetics and features as a villain "a mad psychiatrist, Doctor Dyhard, who persists in rejecting Dianetics after all his abler colleagues have accepted it {{interp|and}} believes in prefrontal lobotomies for everyone")<ref>{{cite journal | last = Frenschkowski | first = Marco | year = 1999 | month = July | title = L.

Hubbard did not make a major return to non-Dianetics fiction until the 1980s.

In 1948 Hubbard was working as a "Special Officer" for the Metropolitan Detective Agency, licensed by the Los Angeles Police Department. According to Scientology, he performed the duties of an armed security guard:<ref>[http://humanitarian.lronhubbard.org/human/respect5.htm Hubbard in Los Angeles], lronhubbard.org</ref> "The guarding of particular properties, e.g., banks and warehouses, and the patrolling of a general neighborhood on behalf of local merchants. In the latter, the Special Officer’s duties were virtually the same as the regular officer, although he had no powers of arrest beyond the "citizen’s arrest."<ref>[http://humanitarian.lronhubbard.org/human/respect4.htm Hubbard in Los Angeles], lronhubbard.org</ref>

While convalescing after the war, Hubbard met [[Jack Parsons]], an aeronautics professor at [[Caltech]] and an associate of the British [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]]. Hubbard and Parsons were allegedly engaged in the practice of ritual [[magick]] in 1946, including an extended set of sex magic rituals called the [[Babalon Working]], intended to summon a goddess or "moonchild." The Church insists Hubbard was a US government intelligence agent on a mission to end Parsons' supposed magical activities and to "rescue" a girl Parsons was "using" for supposedly magical purposes. In a 1952 lecture series, Hubbard recommended a book of Crowley's and referred to him as "Mad Old Boy"<ref>Philadephia Doctorate Lectures, '''Lecture #40 titled "Games/Goals"''', 12 December 1952: About "Limitations on self and others"</ref><ref>'''Lecture #45 titled "Development of Scientology: Characteristics of a Living Science"''', 13 December 1952: About "Life Science"</ref> and as "my very good friend".<ref>L.

==Dianetics==
{{main|Dianetics}}
Beginning in late 1949, Hubbard sought to publicize [[Dianetics]], the [[self-help|self-improvement]] technique. Unable to elicit interest from mainstream publishers or medical professionals,<ref>http://www.ronthephilosopher.org/phlspher/page14.htm</ref> Hubbard turned to the legendary 
science fiction editor [[John W. Campbell]], who had for years published Hubbard's science fiction. The first article on Dianetics was published in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''.  The science fiction community was divided about the merits of Hubbard's claims. Campbell's star author [[Isaac Asimov]] criticized Dianetics' unscientific aspects, and veteran author [[Jack Williamson]] described Dianetics as "a lunatic revision of [[Freudian]] psychology" that "had the look of a wonderfully rewarding scam."<ref name="Bare-faced"/><!--p.152-153--> But Campbell and novelist [[A. E. van Vogt]] enthusiastically embraced Dianetics: Campbell became Hubbard's treasurer, and van Vogt—convinced his wife's health had been transformed for the better by [[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]—interrupted his writing career to run the first Los Angeles Dianetics center.<ref name="Bare-faced"/><!--p.166-->

In April 1950, Hubbard and several others established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] to coordinate work related for the forthcoming publication of a book on Dianetics. The book, entitled ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'', was published in May 1950 by [[Hermitage House]], whose head was also on the Board of Directors of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation.<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!--p. 107-9 --> With ''Dianetics,'' Hubbard introduced the concept of "[[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]," a two-person question-and-answer therapy that focused on painful memories. According to Hubbard, dianetic auditing could eliminate emotional problems, cure physical illnesses, and increase intelligence. In his introduction to ''Dianetics'', Hubbard declared that "the creation of dianetics is a milestone for man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his inventions of the wheel and arch."

''Dianetics'' sold 150,000 copies within a year of publication.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!-- p. 113 --> Upon becoming more widely available, Dianetics became an object of critical scrutiny by the press and the medical establishment. In September 1950, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a cautionary statement on the topic by the [[American Psychological Association]] that read in part, "the association calls attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by empirical evidence," and went on to recommend against use of "the techniques peculiar to Dianetics" until such time it had been validated by scientific testing. ''[[Consumer Reports]],'' in an August 1951 assessment of Dianetics,<ref>[http://www.xenutv.com/print/consumer-review-0851.htm Dianetics Review]</ref> dryly noted "one looks in vain in ''Dianetics'' for the modesty usually associated with announcement of a medical or scientific discovery," and stated that the book had become "the basis for a new cult." The article observed "in a study of L. Ron Hubbard's text, one is impressed from the very beginning by a tendency to generalization and authoritative declarations unsupported by evidence or facts." ''Consumer Reports'' warned its readers against the "possibility of serious harm resulting from the abuse of intimacies and confidences associated with the relationship between auditor and patient," an especially serious risk, they concluded, "in a cult without professional traditions."

The Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation was incorporated in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]. Branch offices were opened in five other US cities before the end of 1950 (though most folded within a year). Hubbard soon abandoned the Foundation, denouncing a number of his former associates as [[communism|communists]] to the FBI.<ref name="Bare-faced"/><!--p.170-->

==Scientology==
[[image:Notesonthelectures.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Hubbard's book, "Notes on the Lectures".]]
{{main|Scientology}}
In mid-1952, Hubbard expanded Dianetics into an "applied religious philosophy" which he called [[Scientology]]. That year, Hubbard also married his third wife, [[Mary Sue Whipp]], to whom he remained married for the rest of his life. With Mary Sue, Hubbard fathered four more children— Diana, [[Quentin Hubbard|Quentin]], Suzette and Arthur —over the next six years.

[[Quentin Hubbard]], born in 1954, was groomed to one day replace him as head of the Scientology organization.<ref name="Blue Sky">pp. 213-214</ref> Quentin was uninterested in his father's plans and had preferred to become a pilot. He was also deeply depressed, allegedly because he was homosexual and Hubbard was [[homophobic]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Secret Lives: L.

On February 10, 1953 Hubbard was awarded a [[honoris causa|honorary]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] by [[Sequoia University]], California, "in recognition of his outstanding work and contributions in the fields of Dianetics and Scientology."<ref>Notarized affidavit of the President of Sequoia University, J.W.

The school offered degrees in osteopathic medicine, religious studies, hydrotherapy and physical sciences</ref> after it was investigated by California authorities on the grounds of being a mail-order "[[degree mill]]."<ref>) John B. Bear and Mariah P. Bear, ''Bears' Guide to Earning College Degrees Nontraditionally'', p.331. Ten Speed Press, 2003.</ref>) In December of that year, Hubbard declared Scientology a religion and the first [[Church of Scientology]] was founded in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. He moved to [[England]] at about the same time, and during the remainder of the 1950s he supervised the growing organization from an office in [[London]]. In 1959, he bought [[Saint Hill Manor]] near the [[Sussex, England|Sussex]] town of [[East Grinstead]], a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] manor house owned by the [[Maharajah]] of [[Jaipur]]. This became the world headquarters of Scientology. Hubbard claimed to have conducted years of intensive research into the nature of human existence; to describe his findings, he developed an elaborate vocabulary with many newly coined terms.<ref name="glossary">[http://www.scientology.org/gloss.htm The Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary]</ref> He codified a set of [[Scientology 0-8: The Book of Basics|Scientology axioms]] and an "applied religious philosophy" that promised to improve the condition of the human [[spirit]], which he called the "[[Thetan]]."<ref>[http://www.scientology.org/wis/WISENG/34/34-scax.htm Scientology Axioms]</ref> The bulk of Scientology focuses on the "rehabilitation" of the thetan.

Hubbard's followers believed his "technology" gave them access to their past lives, the traumas of which led to failures in the present unless they were audited. By this time, Hubbard had introduced a biofeedback device to the auditing process, which he called a "Hubbard Electropsychometer" or "[[E-meter]]." It was invented in the 1940s by a [[chiropractor]] and Dianetics enthusiast named [[Volney Mathison]]. This machine is used by Scientologists in auditing to evaluate "mental masses" surrounding the thetan. These "masses" are claimed to impede the thetan from realizing its full potential.

Hubbard claimed a good deal of physical disease was [[psychosomatic]], and one who, like himself, had attained the enlightened state of "clear" and become an "[[Operating Thetan]]" would be relatively disease free. According to biographers, Hubbard went to great lengths to suppress his recourse to modern medicine, attributing symptoms to attacks by malicious forces, both spiritual and earthly. Hubbard insisted humanity was imperiled by such forces, which were the result of negative memories (or "engrams") stored in the unconscious or "reactive" mind, some carried by the immortal thetans for billions of years. Thus, Hubbard claimed, the only possibility for spiritual salvation was a concerted effort to "clear the planet," that is, to bring the benefits of Scientology to all people everywhere, and attack all forces, social and spiritual, hostile to the interests of the movement.

Church members were expected to pay fixed donation rates for courses, auditing, books and E-meters, all of which proved very lucrative for the Church, which paid emoluments directly to Hubbard and his family.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!--p. 142--> In a case fought by the Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.C. over its tax-exempt status (revoked in 1958 because of these emoluments) the findings of fact in the case included that Hubbard had personally received over $108,000 from the Church and affiliates over a four-year period, over and above the percentage of [[gross income]] (usually 10%) he received from Church-affiliated organizations.<ref name="Foster Report">''Enquiry into the Practice and Effects of Scientology'', Report by Sir John Foster, K.B.E., Q.C., M.P., Published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London December 1971. Cited at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/fosthome.html .</ref><!--para 118--> However, Hubbard denied such emoluments many times in writing, proclaiming he never received any money from the Church.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!--p. 204-->

L. Ron Hubbard's philosophy, Scientology, and the Church of Scientology that he founded are controversial. Some documents written by Hubbard himself suggest he regarded Scientology as a business, not a religion. In one letter dated [[April 10]] [[1953]], he says calling Scientology a religion solves "a problem of practical business," and status as a religion achieves something "more equitable...with what we've got to sell." In a 1962 official policy letter, he said "Scientology 1970 is being planned on a religious organization basis throughout the world. This will not upset in any way the usual activities of any organization. It is entirely a matter for accountants and solicitors."<ref>Hubbard Communications Office Policy Letter, HCOPL, 29 October 1962, as cited in {{cite journal | last = Beit-Hallahmi | first = Benjamin | authorlink = Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi | year = 2003 | month = September | title = Scientology: Religion or racket? | journal = Marburg Journal of Religion | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | url = http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/beit.html | accessdate = 2007-01-07}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ezlink.com/~perry/CoS/Theology/barwell2.htm Is Scientology a religion?

According to ''The Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', ed. Brian Ash, Harmony Books, 1977:

:"... [Hubbard] began making statements to the effect that any writer who really wished to make money should stop writing and develop [a] religion, or devise a new psychiatric method. [[Harlan Ellison]]'s version (''Time Out'', UK, No 332) is that Hubbard is reputed to have told [[John W. Campbell|{{interpolation|John W.}} Campbell]], "I'm going to invent a religion that's going to make me a fortune. I'm tired of writing for a penny a word." [[Sam Moskowitz]], a chronicler of science fiction, has reported that he himself heard Hubbard make a similar statement, but there is no first-hand evidence."

==Legal difficulties and life on the high seas==
[[Scientology controversy|Scientology became a focus of controversy]] across the English-speaking world during the mid-1960s, with the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], the [[Australia]]n state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]] all holding public inquiries into Scientology's activities.<ref>[http://whyaretheydead.net/Cowen/audit/ofpapers.html Official Papers on Scientology]</ref>

Hubbard left this unwanted attention behind in 1966, when he moved to [[Rhodesia]], following [[Ian Smith]]'s [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]]. Attempting to ingratiate himself with the white minority government, he offered to invest large sums in Rhodesia's economy, then hit by UN sanctions, but was asked to leave the country.

In 1967, L. Ron Hubbard further distanced himself from the controversy attached to Scientology by resigning as executive director of the church and appointing himself "[[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]]" of a small fleet of Scientologist-crewed ships that spent the next eight years cruising the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Here, Hubbard formed the religious order known as the "Sea Organization" or "[[Sea Org]]," with titles and uniforms. The Sea Org subsequently became the management group within Hubbard's Scientology empire. 

He was attended by "Commodore's Messengers," teenaged girls dressed in white [[hot pants]] who waited on him hand and foot, bathing and dressing him and even catching the ash from his cigarettes.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!-- p.245 --> He had frequent screaming tantrums and instituted brutal punishments such as incarceration in the ship's filthy chain-locker for days or weeks at a time and "overboarding," in which errant crew members were blindfolded, bound and thrown overboard, dropping up to 40 ft. into the cold sea,<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!-- p.180-1 --> hoping not to hit the side of the ship with its sharp [[barnacles]] on the way down.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!-- p.187 --><ref>Wakefield, Margery.

A letter<ref name="expanded92">In ''L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?'' Corydon, expanded 1992 paperback edition, page 59</ref> Hubbard wrote to his third wife, Mary Sue, when he was in Las Palmas around 1967: "I’m drinking lots of rum and popping pinks and greys...". The author of an unauthorized Hubbard biography also says that "John McMasters told me that on the flagship ''Apollo'' in the late sixties he witnessed Hubbard's drug supply. 'It was the largest drug chest I had ever seen. He had everything!'". This was confirmed by Gerald Armstrong through Virginia Downsborough who said in 1967 he returned to Las Palmas totally debilitated from drugs.<ref>in "Bare-Faced Messiah" copyright (c) 1987 by Russell Miller, p. 266</ref> <blockquote>''We found him a hotel in Las Palmas and the next day I went back to see if he was all right, because he did not seem to be too well.  When I went in to his room, there were drugs of all kinds everywhere.  He seemed to be taking about sixty thousand different pills.  I was appalled, particularly after listening to all his tirades against drugs and the medical profession.  There was something very wrong with him...  My main concern was to try and get him off all the pills he was on and persuade him that there was still plenty for him to do.''</blockquote>  He was existing almost totally on a diet of drugs.

In 1977, Scientology offices on both coasts of the United States were raided by [[FBI]] agents seeking evidence of [[Operation Snow White]], a church-run espionage network. Hubbard's wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard|Mary Sue]] and a dozen other senior Scientology officials were convicted in 1979 of conspiracy against the [[United States federal government]], while Hubbard himself was named by federal prosecutors as an "unindicted co-conspirator."<ref name="Burglaries and Lies">{{cite news|author=Robert W.

In 1978, as part of a case against three French Scientologists Hubbard was convicted for "making fraudulent promises" and given a suspended prison sentence and a 35,000₣ fine by a French court. Hubbard - who had not been defended in the trial at all and had not been in the country during the whole time - refused to appear for the appeal. The case was then appealed by one of the convicts - in 1980 - with all fraud charges being dropped and Scientology recognized as a religion. Another convict got the case retried in 1981 and the fraud charges canceled by judgment of  November 9, 1981. Hubbard himself did not take action until the case was moot and the fine was never enforced.<ref>Reuters wire service, printed in Sunday Star (Toronto), 2 March 1980, also in [http://misou.awardspace.us/iht.html International Herald Tribune, 3 March 1980]:"The Paris Court of Appeal has recognized the U.S.-based Church of Scientology as a religion and cleared a former leader of the movement's French branch of fraud. ...

Hubbard's refusal to talk to British immigration officials about this conviction is said to have later caused the British [[Home Office]] to re-affirm an earlier decision to bar him from the UK.<ref>{{cite news |title= Scientology leader is ordered: Stay away|work= [[Daily Mail]]|date= [[1984-07-29]]}}</ref> In 1989 however the then Home Office Minister of State, Tim Renton, confirmed in writing that from 1980 until the date of his death, Hubbard had been free to apply for entry to the United Kingdom under the ordinary immigration rules and that any ban had been lifted on 16 July 1980.<ref>Home Office, Letter of Tim Renton, 24 Feb 1989: "I can indeed confirm that the ban on Scientologists entering this country ... was removed on 16 July 1980."</ref><ref>The Sunday Times, 13 July 1980 "Ministers to lift ban on Scientology," by Michael Jones and John Whale</ref>

Hubbard has been interpreted as both a savior (Scientologists refer to him as "The Friend of Mankind") and a con-artist. These sharply contrasting views have been a source of hostility between Hubbard supporters and critics. A California court judgment in 1984 involving [[Gerry Armstrong|Gerald Armstrong]], who had been assigned the task of writing Hubbard's biography, highlights the extreme opposition of the two sides. The judgment quotes a 1970's police agency of the French Government and says in part:

{{quotation|"In addition to violating and abusing its own members' civil rights, the organization [Scientology] over the years with its "[[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]]" doctrine has harassed and abused those persons not in the Church whom it perceives as enemies. The organization clearly is schizophrenic and paranoid, and the bizarre combination seems to be a reflection of its founder LRH [L. Ron Hubbard]. The evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history, background, and achievements. The writings and documents in evidence additionally reflect his egoism, greed, avarice, lust for power, and vindictiveness and aggressiveness against persons perceived by him to be disloyal or hostile. At the same time it appears that he is charismatic and highly capable of motivating, organizing, controlling, manipulating, and inspiring his adherents."| -- Superior Court Judge Paul Breckinridge, ''Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong,'' [[June 20]], [[1984]].<ref>[http://www.planetkc.com/sloth/sci/breck.html Breckenridge Decision]</ref>}}

The accuracy of Hubbard's self-representations was also addressed in court in a 1984 judgment by Justice Latey, ruling<ref>Re: B & G (Minors) (Custody), Delivered in the High Court (Family Division), London, 23 July 1984; judgement transcript available on-line via [http://holysmoke.org/cos/latey.htm HolySmoke.org] and [http://www.xenu.net/archive/audit/latey.html Xenu.net]</ref> in the [[High Court of Justice|High court]] of London, stated in his judgment that Scientology is "dangerous, immoral, sinister and corrupt" and "has its real objective money and power for Mr. Hubbard."<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 342 -->  Justice Latey also addressed Hubbard's representation of himself:

{{quotation|... he has made these, among other false claims:
<br/>
That he was a much decorated war hero. He was not. 
<br/>
That he commanded a corvette squadron. He did not.
<br/>
That he was awarded the Purple Heart, a gallantry decoration for those wounded in action. He was not wounded and was not decorated.
<br/>
That he was crippled and blinded in the war and cured himself with Dianetic technique. He was not crippled and was not blinded.
<br/>
That he was sent by U.S. Naval Intelligence to break up a black magic ring in California. He was not. He was himself a member of that occult group and practiced ritual sexual magic in it.
<br/>
That he was a graduate of George Washington University and an atomic physicist. The facts are that he completed only one year of college and failed the one course on nuclear physics in which he enrolled.
<br/>
There is no dispute about any of this. The evidence is unchallenged.<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 339 -->|Justice Latey High court of London}}

Hubbard also tended to present himself as a man who was able to speak intelligently on a variety of subjects, including medicine. The 1965 [[Anderson Report]], an inquiry on Hubbard and Scientology held in Australia found:{{quotation|Hubbard is a man of restless energy, with tremendous enthusiasm in everything he undertakes. He is constantly experimenting and speculating, and equally constantly he confuses the two. He has acquired in a frenetic but superficial way a smattering of knowledge of many subjects. In very many instances, however, his knowledge is fragmentary and inaccurate and sometimes positively incorrect, yet it serves as the foundation for pretentious and completely misleading pronouncements on scientific matters of which he is ignorant. In other instances where he has not even "enough of learning to misquote," he gives full rein to his imagination to produce incomprehensible and absurd results.|[[Anderson Report]] [[1965]]}}

All that he writes and says is either accepted by his followers or, at the very least, it is not rejected. They are taught that they are entitled to question his pronouncements, but they are conditioned to the belief that whatever he says is right.<ref> [http://www.xenu.net/archive/audit/ar06.html] 1965 Anderson Report biography of Hubbard</ref> </blockquote> A later finding in the report addresses his claims of medical knowledge and ability by saying:<blockquote>Hubbard's claims to have found the only known cure for atomic radiation effects is not only unsubstantiated, but, in view of its obvious military value, hardly likely to have been left uninvestigated by military authorities if it was of any value whatever.<ref>[http://www.xenu.net/archive/audit/lee.html#evaluation] 1965 Anderson Report evaluation of Hubbard as a physician </ref></blockquote>

"Fair Game" was introduced by Hubbard, and incites Scientologists to use criminal behavior, deception and exploitation of the legal system to resist "[[Suppressive Person]]s", i.e. people or groups that "actively seeks to suppress or damage Scientology or a Scientologist by Suppressive Acts." He defined it "Fair Game" as:

:''ENEMY — SP Order. Fair game. May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed''.<ref>HCO POLICY LETTER OF 18 OCTOBER 1967, Issue IV [http://www.suppressiveperson.org/hate/pubs/pl-1967-10-18-penalties-lower-conditions.html]</ref>

Use of the term "Fair Game" was canceled in 1968, with Hubbard stating that "The practice of declaring people FAIR GAME will cease. FAIR GAME may not appear on any Ethics Order. It causes bad public relations. This P/L does not cancel any policy on the treatment or handling of an SP."<ref>Hubbard, HCOPL 21 October 1968, Cancellation of Fair Game</ref> The practice was continued, as Hubbard noted that his statement did not cancel the "fair game treatment" of Suppressive People as can be seen in the case of [[Paulette Cooper]]. 

Hubbard claimed in a 1976 affidavit that Fair Game was never intended to authorise harassment, stating that: "There was never any attempt or intent on my part by the writing of these policies (or any others for that fact), to authorise illegal or harassment type acts against anyone.
As soon as it became apparent to me that the concept of 'Fair Game' as described above was being misinterpreted by the uninformed, to mean the granting of a licence to Scientologists for acts in violation of the law and/or other standards of decency, these policies were cancelled."<ref>Hubbard, affidavit of 22 March 1976, quoted in David V Barrett, The New Believers: A Survey of Sects, Cults and Alternative Religions, p. 464 (Octopus Publishing Group, 2003)</ref>
He returned to the United States in the mid-1970s and lived for a while in [[Florida]].<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!-- p.209-13 -->

==Later life==
During the 1980s, Hubbard returned to science fiction, publishing 
''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'' and ''[[Mission Earth (novel)|Mission Earth]]'', the latter being an enormous book, published as a ten volume series. He also wrote an unpublished [[screenplay]] called ''Revolt in the Stars'', which dramatizes Scientology's [[OT III]] teachings.<ref>[Bare-Faced-Messiah, "Making Movies" http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/atack/bs6-1.htm]</ref>Hubbard's later [[science fiction]] sold well and received mixed reviews, but some press reports describe how sales of Hubbard's books were  inflated by Scientologists purchasing large numbers of copies in order to manipulate the bestseller charts.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062890,1,737186,full.story?coll=la-news-comment&ctrack=5&cset=true |title = Costly Strategy Continues to Turn Out Bestsellers |accessdate = 2007-07-30 |last = Welkos |first = Robert W. |coauthors = Sappell, Joel |date = [[1990-06-28]] |work = The Scientology Story |publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref>McIntyre, Mike ([[April 15]], [[1990]]).

There may well have been much more.}}</ref>

One year before the death of L. Ron Hubbard, the Sunday Times Magazine (28 October, 1984) published an  article<ref>http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/england/sundaytimes-magazine-scientology.htm</ref> on [[Scientology]], including a photo (by Nik Wheeler) of a totally exhausted Ron Hubbard.<ref>[http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/england/old-ugly-l-ron-hubbard-small.jpg] - Sunday Times Article photo</ref> Hubbard died at his ranch on [[24 January]] [[1986]], aged 74, reportedly from a [[stroke]].  Scientology attorneys arrived to claim his body, which they sought to have [[cremation|cremated]] immediately per his will. They were blocked by the [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]] [[medical examiner]], who ordered a drug toxicology test of a blood sample from Hubbard's corpse. The examination revealed a trace amount of the drug [[hydroxyzine]] (brand name Vistaril).<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Toxicology_Report_Hubbard.gif] Image of Hubbard's toxicology report</ref><ref>Supplementary Coroner Report, 30 Jan 1986</ref><ref>Letter of Sheriff-Coroner E. Williams,  4 Nov 1987</ref>Vistaril is commonly prescribed as a sedative for symptomatic treatment of anxiety or [[neurosis]] or as an adjunct in non-related diseases in which anxiety is apparent. It is also useful in treating allergic [[itch|pruritus]] such as chronic [[urticaria]] and [[Atopy|atopic]] and contact [[Dermatosis|dermatoses]].<ref>http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_vistaril.pdf; VISTARIL® (hydroxyzine pamoate) Capsules and Oral Suspension; Pfizer; accessed 2007-04-11</ref> After the blood was taken, Hubbard's remains were cremated. 

The Church of Scientology announced Hubbard had deliberately [[Scientology_and_sex#MEST_and_meat|discarded his body]] to do "higher level spiritual research," unencumbered by mortal confines, and was now living "on a planet a galaxy away."<ref>"The Making of L. Ron Hubbard," ''Los Angeles Times'', June 24, 1990, pg. A40</ref> In May 1987, [[David Miscavige]], one of Hubbard's former personal assistants, assumed the position of Chairman of the [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC), a corporation that owns the trademarked names and symbols of Dianetics and Scientology. Although Religious Technology Center is a separate corporation from the Church of Scientology International, Miscavige is the [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] leader of the religion. [[Heber Jentzsch]] is the President of Church of Scientology International.<ref>[http://www.scientology.org/scnnews/jentzsch.htm Heber C. Jentzsch]</ref>

==Writing career==
{{main|L. Ron Hubbard bibliography|Scientology bibliography}}

His fame increased greatly after the introduction of Dianetics and Scientology, and he has continued to be a popular subject since the time of his death. L. Ron Hubbard has been depicted in novels, motion pictures, television cartoons, video games and other cultural forms.  Hubbard turns up in a fellow pulp author's fiction as early as [[Anthony Boucher]]'s 1942 murder mystery ''Rocket to the Morgue'' which features cameos by members and friends of the "Mañana Literary Society of Southern California," in which Hubbard makes a dual appearance as D. Vance Wimpole and Rene Lafayette (one of his pen names).<ref>{{cite book | last = Pendle | first = George | authorlink = George Pendle | title = Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons | year = 2005 | publisher = [[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt]] | isbn = 978-0-15-100997-8 | pages = pg.253 | chapter = }}</ref> In [[Keith Giffen]]'s [[Justice League]] International, a robot appeared named [[L-Ron]]. In later issues, L-Ron's full programming code, "L-Ron H*bb*rd" was revealed. <ref name="DC">[http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=469 Justice League Broken Frontier] JLA members</ref> L-Ron is still a minor character in the [[DC Universe]].

Hubbard was an unusually prolific author and lecturer. Because the majority of Hubbard's writings of the 1950s through to the 1970s were aimed exclusively at Scientologists, the Church of Scientology founded its own companies to publish his works - [[Bridge Publications]] for the US and Canadian market and [[New Era Publications]], based in [[Denmark]], for the rest of the world. New volumes of his transcribed lectures continue to be produced; that series alone will ultimately total a projected 110 large volumes. Hubbard also wrote a number of works of fiction during the 1930s and 1980s, which are published by the Scientology-owned [[Galaxy Press]]. All three of these publishing companies are subordinate to [[Author Services Inc.]], another Scientology corporation.

Hubbard was awarded the 1994 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Literature for "his crackling Good Book, ''Dianetics,'' which is highly profitable to mankind — or to a portion thereof."<ref>http://improbable.com/ig-pastwinners.html#ig1994</ref> In 2006, [[Guinness World Records]] declared Hubbard the world's most published and most translated author, having published 1,084 fiction and non-fiction works that have been translated into 71 languages.<ref>http://www.voxmagazine.com/stories/2006/12/07/guinness-gracious/ Guinness Gracious; Vox - Columbia Missourian; Sean Ludwig;
