The '''cougar''' (''Puma concolor''), also '''puma''', '''mountain lion''', or '''panther''', depending on region, is a [[mammal]] of the [[Felidae]] family, native to the [[Americas]]. This large, solitary cat has the greatest [[range (biology)|range]] of any wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere,<ref name="diet"/> extending from [[Yukon]] in [[Canada]] to the southern [[Andes]] of [[South America]]. An adaptable, [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] species, the cougar is found in every major [[New World]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] type. It is the second heaviest cat in the western hemisphere after the [[jaguar]], and the fourth heaviest in the world, along with the leopard, after the [[tiger]], [[lion]], and [[jaguar]], although it is most closely related to smaller felines.

A capable stalk-and-ambush [[predator]], the cougar pursues a wide variety of prey. Primary food sources include [[ungulate]]s such as [[deer]], [[elk]], and [[bighorn sheep]], as well as domestic cattle, horses, and sheep, particularly in the northern part of its range, but it also hunts species as small as [[insect]]s and [[rodents]]. It prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but it can live in open areas. The cougar is [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and persists at low population densities. Individual territory sizes depend on terrain, vegetation, and abundance of prey. While it is a large predator, it is not always the [[Apex predator|dominant species]] in its range, as when it competes for prey with other predators such as the [[jaguar]], [[gray wolf]], [[American Black Bear|black bear]], and the [[grizzly bear]]. It is a reclusive cat and usually avoids people. [[List of fatal cougar attacks in North America by decade|Attacks on humans]] remain rare, despite a recent increase in frequency.<ref name="Med"/>

Due to persecution following the [[European colonization of the Americas]], and continuing human development of cougar habitat, populations have dropped in many parts of its historical range. In particular, the cougar was [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in eastern [[North America]], except an isolated [[Florida panther|sub-population in Florida]]; the animal may be recolonizing parts of its former eastern territory. With its vast range, the cougar has dozens of names and various references in the mythology of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and in contemporary culture.

==Naming and etymology==
The cougar has numerous names in English, of which ''puma'' and ''mountain lion'' are popular. Other names include ''catamount'', ''panther'', and ''mountain screamer''.  Lexicographers regard ''painter'' as a primarily upper-Southern U.S. regional variant on "panther",<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/61/P0016100.html Bartleby.com transcription of ''American Heritage Dictionary'']</ref> but a [[folk etymology]], fancying a resemblance between the typically dark tip of its tail and a paintbrush dipped in dark paint, has some currency.<!--{{Fact}} begin-->{{fix

The cougar holds the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness]] record for the animal with the highest number of names, presumably due to its wide distribution across North and South America. It has over 40 names in English alone.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Guinness Book of World Records | year = 2004 | pages = p.49}}</ref>

"Cougar" is borrowed from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''çuçuarana'', via [[French language|French]]; the term was originally derived from the [[Tupi language]]. A current form in Brazil is ''suçuarana''. "Puma" comes, via [[Spanish language|Spanish]], from the [[Quechua language]] of Peru.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cougar ''Cougar''], [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=puma ''Puma''] and

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The Cougar is the largest of the small cats. It is placed in the subfamily [[Felinae]], although its bulk characteristics are similar to those of the [[big cat]]s in the subfamily [[Pantherinae]].<ref name=MSW3/> The [[family (biology)|family]] [[Felidae]] is believed to have originated in [[Asia]] approximately 11 million years ago. Taxonomic research on felids remains partial and much of what is known about their evolutionary history is based on [[mitochondrial DNA]] analysis,<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=DNA Offers New Insight Concerning Cat Evolution |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/06/science/06cats.html?ex=1294203600&en=4b75c4da1cdc2167&ei=5090 |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date= 2006-01-06 |accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref> as cats are poorly represented in the [[fossil record]],<ref name="Johnson2006"/> and there are significant [[confidence intervals]] with suggested dates.
[[Image:Cougar pounce.jpg|right|200px|left|thumb|Although large, the cougar is closely related to small felines.]]
In the latest [[genomic]] study of Felidae, the common ancestor of today's ''[[Leopardus]]'', ''[[Lynx]]'', ''[[Puma (genus)|Puma]]'', ''[[Prionailurus]]'', and ''[[Felis]]'' lineages migrated across the [[Bering land bridge]] into the Americas approximately 8 to 8.5 million years ([[annum|Ma]]) ago. The lineages subsequently diverged in that order.<ref name="Johnson2006">{{cite journal |author=Johnson, W.E., Eizirik, E., Pecon-Slattery, J., Murphy, W.J., Antunes, A., Teeling, E. & O'Brien, S.J. |date=2006-01-06 |number=5757 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5757/73 |title=The Late Miocene radiation of modern Felidae: A genetic assessment |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=311 |issue=5757 |pages=73–77 |doi=10.1126/science.1122277 |accessdate=2007-06-04 |pmid=16400146}}</ref> North American felids then invaded South America 3 Ma ago as part of the [[Great American Interchange]], following formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. The cougar was originally thought to belong in ''Felis'', the genus which includes the [[domestic cat]], but it is now placed in ''Puma'' along with the [[jaguarundi]], a cat just a little more than a tenth its weight.

Studies have not indicated that the cougar and jaguarundi are most closely related to the modern [[cheetah]] of Africa and western Asia,<ref name="Johnson2006"/><ref name="Culver">{{cite journal |author=Culver, M. |coauthors=Johnson, W.E., Pecon-Slattery, J., O'Brein, S.J. |year=2000 |title=Genomic Ancestry of the American Puma |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=186–97 |url=http://www.coryi.org/Florida_panther/Miscellaneous_Panther_Material/Genomic%20ancestry%20of%20the%20American%20puma.pdf |format = PDF | doi = 10.1093/jhered/91.3.186 |pmid=10833043}}</ref> but the relationship is unresolved. It has been suggested that the cheetah lineage diverged from the ''Puma'' lineage in the Americas (see [[American cheetah]]) and migrated back to Asia and Africa,<ref name="Johnson2006"/><ref name="Culver"/> while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the Old World itself.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ross |last=Barnett |coauthors=Ian Barnes, Matthew J. Phillips, Larry D. Martin, C. Richard Harington, Jennifer A. Leonard, and Alan Cooper |date=2005-08-09 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982205008365 |title=Evolution of the extinct Sabretooths and the American cheetah-like cat |journal=Current Biology |volume=15 |issue=15 |pages=R589–R590 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.07.052 |accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref> The outline of [[Felinae|small feline]] migration to the Americas is thus unclear.

Recent studies have demonstrated a high level of genetic similarity among the North American cougar populations, suggesting that they are all fairly recent descendants of a small ancestral group. Culver ''et al.'' suggest that the original North American population of ''Puma concolor'' was [[local extinction|extirpated]] during the [[Pleistocene extinctions]] some 10,000 years ago, when other large mammals such as ''[[Smilodon]]'' also disappeared. North America was then repopulated by a group of South American cougars.<ref name="Culver"/>

===Subspecies===
Until the late 1990s, as many as 32 [[subspecies]] were recorded; however, a recent [[Genetics|genetic]] study of mitochondrial DNA<ref name="Culver"/> found that many of these are too similar to be recognized as distinct at a molecular level. Following the research, the canonical ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' (3rd edition) recognizes six subspecies, five of which are solely found in [[Latin America]]:<ref name=MSW3>{{MSW3 Wozencraft |pages=544–45}}</ref>

==Biology and behavior==
===Physical characteristics===
[[Image:Cougar sitting.jpg|thumb|right|Although cougars resemble the [[domestic cat]], they are about the same size as an adult human.]]

Cougars are slender and agile cats. Adults stand about 60 to 76 cm (2.0 to 2.5 ft) tall at the shoulders. The length of adult males is around 2.4&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft) long nose to tail, with overall ranges between 1.5 and 2.75&nbsp;meters (5 and 9&nbsp;ft) nose to tail suggested for the species in general.<ref name="Texas">{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/species/mlion/ |title=Mountain Lion (''Puma concolor'') |accessdate=2007-03-30 |publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife}}</ref><ref name="NY">{{cite web |url=http://www.dec.state.ny.us/website/dfwmr/wildlife/endspec/eacofs.html |title=Eastern Cougar Fact Sheet |accessdate=2007-03-30 |publisher=New York State Department of Environmental Conservation}}</ref> Males have an average weight of about 53 to 72&nbsp;kilograms (115 to 160&nbsp;pounds).

The head of the cat is round and the ears erect. Its powerful forequarters, neck, and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey. It has five retractable claws on its forepaws (one a [[dewclaw]]) and four on its hind paws. The larger front feet and claws are adaptations to clutching prey.<ref name="WhosWho">{{cite web |url=http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?pid=1&id=87&cid=8 |title=Cougar |work=Hinterland Who's Who |accessdate=2007-05-22 |publisher=[[Canadian Wildlife Service]] and [[Canadian Wildlife Federation]]}}</ref>

Cougars can be almost as large as jaguars, but are less muscled and powerful; where their ranges overlap, the cougar tends to be smaller than average. The cougar is on average as heavy as the leopard. Despite its size, it is not typically classified among the "[[big cats]]," as it cannot roar, lacking the specialized [[larynx]] and [[hyoid]] apparatus of ''Panthera''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Weissengruber |first=GE |coauthors=G Forstenpointner, G Peters, A Kübber-Heiss, and WT Fitch |title=Hyoid apparatus and pharynx in the lion (Panthera leo), jaguar (Panthera onca), tiger (Panthera tigris), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and domestic cat (Felis silvestris f. catus) |work=Journal of Anatomy |publisher=Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland |pages=195–209 |volume=201 |issue=201 |year=2002 |month=September |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1570911 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00088.x |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref> Like domestic cats, cougars vocalize low-pitched hisses, growls, and purrs, as well as chirps and whistles.

[[Image:Puma concolor paw.jpg|left|thumb|paw <!--front or back?-->of a cougar]]
Cougar coloring is plain (hence the [[Latin]] ''concolor'') but can vary greatly between individuals and even between siblings. The coat is typically tawny, but ranges to silvery-grey or reddish, with lighter patches on the under body including the jaws, chin, and throat. Infants are spotted and born with blue eyes and rings on their tails;<ref name="CAP"/> juveniles are pale, and dark spots remain on their flanks.<ref name="NY"/> Despite anecdotes to the contrary, all-black coloring ([[melanism]]) has never been documented in cougars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news-tribune.net/features/cnhinsoutdoors_story_032111454.html |title=Black cougar more talk than fact |date=2006-02-01|accessdate=2007-05-20 |publisher=Tahlequah Daily Press|quote=[[Game Warden]]: Never in the history of the United States has there ever been, in captivity or in the wild, a documented black mountain lion}}</ref> The term "[[black panther]]" is used colloquially to refer to melanistic individuals of other species, particularly jaguars and leopards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.messybeast.com/genetics/mutant-pumas.html |title=Mutant Pumas}}</ref> 

Cougars have large paws and proportionally the largest hind legs in the cat family.<ref name="CAP"/> This physique allows it great leaping and short-sprint ability. An exceptional vertical leap of 5.4&nbsp;m (18&nbsp;ft) is reported for the cougar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-puma.html |title=Mountain Lion (Puma, Cougar) |accessdate=2007-04-02 |work=San Diego Zoo.org |publisher=[[San Diego Zoo|Zoological Society of San Diego]]}}</ref> Horizontal jumping capability is suggested anywhere from 6 to 12&nbsp;m (20 to 40&nbsp;ft).

It is adept at climbing, which allows it to evade [[Canidae|canine]] competitors.

===Hunting and diet===
[[Image:CMM MountainLion.jpg|thumb|right|Cougars are ambush predators, feeding mostly on deer and other mammals.]]

A successful [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] [[predator]], the cougar will eat any animal it can catch, from [[insect]]s to large [[ungulate]]s. Like all cats, it is an [[obligate carnivore]], feeding only on meat. Its most important prey species are various deer species, particularly in North America; [[mule deer]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[elk]], and even the large [[moose]] are taken by the cat. Other species such as Bighorn Sheep, [[Mustang (horse)|wild horses of Arizona]],domestic horses, and domestic livestock such as cattle and sheep are also primary food bases in many areas.<ref name="SW">{{cite web |url=http://wf2dnvr2.webfeat.org/|title=Influence of Predation by Mountain Lions on Numbers and Survivorship of a Feral Horse Population|author=John W.

Learned, individual prey recognition was observed, as some cougars rarely killed [[bighorn sheep]], while others relied heavily on the species.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=R. |coauthors=Jalkotzy, MG., Festa-Bianchet, M. |month=May | year=1993 |title=Cougar predation on bighorn sheep in southwestern Alberta during winter |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |volume=75 |issue=5 |pages=771–75 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=4321651 |accessdate=2007-04-08 |doi=10.1139/z97-098}}</ref> 

In the Central and South American cougar range, the ratio of deer in the diet declines. Small to mid-size mammals are preferred, including large rodents such as the [[capybara]]. Ungulates accounted for only 35% of prey items in one survey, approximately half that of North America. Competition with the larger jaguar has been suggested for the decline in the size of prey items.<ref name="diet"/> Other listed prey species of the cougar include [[mice]], [[porcupine]], and [[hare]]s. Birds and small reptiles are sometimes preyed upon in the south, but this is rarely recorded in North America.<ref name="diet"/>

Though capable of sprinting, the cougar is typically an [[ambush predator]]. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap onto the back of its prey and a suffocating neck bite. The cougar is capable of breaking the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground.<ref name="WhosWho"/> It has a flexible spine which aids its killing technique. 

Kills are generally estimated at around one large ungulate every two weeks. The period shrinks for females raising young, and may be as short as one kill every three days when cubs are nearly mature at around 15 months.<ref name="CAP"/> The cat drags a kill to a preferred spot, covers it with brush, and returns to feed over a period of days. It is generally reported that the cougar is a non-[[scavenger]] and will rarely consume prey it has not killed; but deer carcasses left exposed for study were scavenged by cougars in California, suggesting more opportunistic behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bauer |first=Jim W. |coauthors=Kenneth A.

===Reproduction and lifecycle===
Females reach sexual maturity between one-and-a-half and three years of age. They typically average one [[litter (animal)|litter]] every two to three years throughout their reproductive life;<ref name="Utah">{{cite web |url=http://www.wildlife.utah.gov/pdf/cmgtplan.pdf |title=Utah Cougar Management Plan (Draft) |accessdate=2007-05-02 |author=Cougar Discussion Group |date=1999-01-27 |year= |month= |format=PDF |work= |publisher=Utah Division of Wildlife Resources}}</ref> the period can be as short as one year.<ref name="CAP"/> Females are in [[estrus]] for approximately 8 days of a 23-day cycle; the [[gestation period]] is approximately 91 days.<ref name="CAP"/> Females are sometimes reported as [[monogamous]],<ref name="CanGeo"/> but this is uncertain and [[polygyny]] may be more common.<ref name="UWSP">{{cite web |author=Matthew Hamilton |coauthors= Peter Hundt, Ryan Piorkowski |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/wildlife/carnivore/Mountain%20Lion%20Natural%20History_files/Mountain%20Lion%20Natural%20History_copy(1).htm |title=Mountain Lions |accessdate=2007-05-10 |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point]]}}</ref> Copulation is brief but frequent.

[[Image:Mountain lion kittens.jpg|thumb|left|Cougar kittens]]
Only females are involved in parenting. Female cougars are fiercely protective of their kittens, and have been seen to successfully fight off animals as large as grizzly bears in their defense. Litter size is between one and six kittens, typically two or three. Caves and other alcoves that offer protection are used as litter dens. Born blind, kittens are completely dependent on their mother at first, and begin to be weaned at around three months of age. As they grow, they begin to go out on forays with their mother, first visiting kill sites, and after six months beginning to hunt small prey on their own.<ref name="Utah"/> Kitten survival rates are just over one per litter.<ref name="CAP"/>

Sub-adults leave their mother to attempt to establish their own territory at around two years of age and sometimes earlier; males tend to leave sooner. One study has shown high morbidity amongst cougars that travel farthest from the maternal range, often due to conflicts with other cougars ("intraspecific" conflict).<ref name="Utah"/> Research in [[New Mexico]] has shown that "males dispersed significantly farther than females, were more likely to traverse large expanses of non-cougar habitat, and were probably most responsible for nuclear gene flow between habitat patches."<ref name="Dispersal">{{cite journal |last=Sweanor |first=Linda |coauthors=Kenneth A.

Life expectancy in the wild is reported at between 8 to 13 years, and probably averages 8 to 10; a female of at least 18 years was reported killed by hunters on [[Vancouver Island]].<ref name="CAP"/> Cougars may live as long as 20 years in captivity. Causes of death in the wild include disability and disease, competition with other cougars, starvation, accidents, and, where allowed, human hunting.

===Social structure and home range===
Like almost all cats, the cougar is a solitary animal. Only mothers and kittens live in groups, with adults meeting only to mate. It is secretive and [[crepuscular]], being most active around dawn and dusk.

Estimates of territory sizes vary greatly.
''[[Canadian Geographic]]'' reports large male territories of 150 to 1000 [[square kilometer]]s (58 to 386&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) with female ranges half the size.<ref name="CanGeo"/> Other research suggests a much smaller lower limit of 25&nbsp;km² (10&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) but an even greater upper limit of 1300&nbsp;km² (500&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) for males.<ref name="Utah"/> In the United States, very large ranges have been reported in [[Texas]] and the [[Black Hills]] of the northern [[Great Plains]], in excess of 775&nbsp;km² (300&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).<ref name="Dordt">{{cite web |url=http://homepages.dordt.edu/~mahaffy/mtlion/mtlionshort_behaviour.html |title=Behavior of cougar in Iowa and the Midwest |accessdate=2007-05-11 |last=Mahaffy |first=James |year=2004 |month=December |publisher=[[Dordt College]]}}</ref> Male ranges may include or overlap with those of females but, at least where studied, not with those of other males, which serves to reduce conflict between cougars. Ranges of females may overlap slightly with each other. Scrape marks, [[urine]], and [[feces]] are used to mark territory and attract mates. Males may scrape together a small pile of leaves and grasses and then urinate on it as a way of marking territory.<ref name="Sierra"/>

Home range sizes and overall cougar abundance depend on terrain, vegetation, and prey abundance.<ref name="Utah"/> One female adjacent to the [[San Andres Mountains]], for instance, was found with a large range of 215&nbsp;km² (83&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), necessitated by poor prey abundance.<ref name="Dispersal"/> Research has shown cougar abundances from 0.5 animals to as much as 7 (in one study in South America) per 100&nbsp;km² (38&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).<ref name="CAP"/>

Because males disperse further than females and compete more directly for mates and territory, they are most likely to be involved in conflict. Where a sub-adult fails to leave his maternal range, for example, he may be killed by his father.<ref name="Dordt"/> When males encounter each other, they hiss and spit, and may engage in violent conflict if neither backs down.<ref name="UWSP"/> Hunting or relocation of the cougar may increase aggressive encounters by disrupting territories and bringing young, transient animals into conflict with established individuals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sinapu.org/PDF/Front%20Range%20lion%20study.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mountain Lion (Puma concolor) study on Boulder Open Space |accessdate=2007-05-11 |date=2007-03-22 |work=Letter to the Parks and Open Space Advisory Committee, Boulder, Colorado |publisher=Sinapu}}</ref>

==Ecology==
===Distribution and habitat===
The cougar has the largest range of any wild land animal in the Americas. Its range spans 110 degrees of [[latitude]], from northern [[Yukon]] in Canada to the southern [[Andes]]. It is one of only three cat species, along with the [[bobcat]] and [[Canadian lynx]], native to Canada.<ref name="WhosWho"/> Its wide distribution stems from its adaptability to virtually every habitat type: it is found in all forest types as well as in lowland and mountainous deserts. Studies show that the Cougar prefers regions with dense underbrush, but can live with little vegetation in open areas.<ref name="iucn"/> Its preferred habitats include precipitous canyons, escarpments, rim rocks, and dense brush.<ref name="Sierra"/>

The cougar was [[extirpated]] across much of its eastern North American range with the exception of Florida in the two centuries after European colonization and faced grave threats in the remainder. Currently, it ranges across most western American states, the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]], and the Canadian [[Yukon Territory]]. There have been widely-debated reports of possible recolonization of eastern North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/0305/0305_selections.html |title=Bookshelf |last=Marschall |first=Laurence A. |date= |year=2005 |month=March |work=Natural Selections |publisher=[[Natural History Magazine]] |accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> DNA evidence has suggested its presence in eastern North America,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/News/Local/2007/05/24/4205568.html |first=Joe |last=Belanger |title=DNA evidence of cougars found in southern Ontario |date=2007-05-24 |publisher=[[London Free Press]] |accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> while a consolidated map of cougar sightings shows numerous reports, from the mid-western [[Great Plains]] through to [[Eastern Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cougarnet.org/bigpicture.html |title=The "Big" Picture |accessdate=2007-05-20 |author=[http://www.cougarnet.org/network.html Board of Directors] | year=2004| publisher=The Cougar Network}} ''The Cougar Network methodology is recognized by the [http://www.fws.gov/northeast/ECougar/ U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service].''</ref> The only unequivocally known eastern population is the [[Florida panther]], which is critically endangered. There have also been sightings up in central Maine in a village called Elliotsville.

South of the [[Rio Grande]], the [[World Conservation Union|International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) lists the cat in every [[Central America|Central]] and [[South American]] country except [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]].<ref name="iucn"/> While specific state and provincial statistics are often available in North America, much less is known about the cat in its southern range.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.nwf.org/cats/pdfs/cougarfacts.pdf | format = PDF | title = Cougar facts | accessdate = 2007-05-20 | publisher=[[National Wildlife Federation]]}}</ref>

The cougar's total breeding population is estimated at less than 50,000 by the IUCN, with a declining trend.<ref name="iucn"/> U.S. state-level statistics are often more optimistic, suggesting cougar populations have rebounded. In Oregon, a healthy population of 5,000 was reported in 2006, exceeding a target of 3,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfw.state.or.us/wildlife/cougar/ |title=Cougar Management Plan |accessdate=2007-05-20 |year=2006 |work=Wildlife Division: Wildlife Management Plans |publisher=Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife}}</ref> California has actively sought to protect the cat and a similar number of cougars has been suggested, between 4,000 and 6,000.<ref name="California">{{cite web |url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/news/issues/lion.html |title=Mountain Lions in California |accessdate=2007-05-20 |year=2004 |publisher=California Department of Fish and Game}}</ref>

===Ecological role===
Aside from humans, no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild. The cat is not, however, the [[apex predator]] throughout much of its range. In its northern range, the cougar interacts with other powerful predators such as the [[brown bear]] and gray wolf. In the south, the cougar must compete with the larger [[jaguar]]. In Florida it encounters the [[American Alligator|American alligator]].

[[Image:Cougar track.jpg|thumb|left|Front paw print of a cougar. An adult paw print is approximately 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;[[inches]]) long.<ref name="GovBC"/>]]

The [[Yellowstone National Park]] ecosystem provides a fruitful microcosm to study inter-predator interaction in North America. Of the three large predators, the massive brown bear appears dominant, often although not always able to drive both the gray wolf pack and the cougar off their kills. One study found that brown or [[American Black Bear|black bear]]s visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and [[Glacier National Park]]s, usurping 10% of carcasses.<ref>{{cite paper |author=COSEWIC. Canadian Wildlife Service |title=Assessment and Update Status Report on the Grizzly Bear (Ursus arctos) |publisher=[[Environment Canada]] |year=2002 |url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/CW69-14-166-2002E.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-04-08 }}</ref>

The gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey, especially in winter. While individually more powerful than the gray wolf, a solitary cougar may be dominated by the pack structure of the canines. Wolves can steal kills and occasionally kill the cat. One report describes a large pack of fourteen wolves killing a female cougar and her kittens. Conversely, lone wolves are at a disadvantage, and have been reported killed by cougars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A2158-2003May17&notFound=true |title=In Yellowstone, it's Carnivore Competition |last=Gugliotta |first=Guy |date=2003-05-19 |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref> Wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities, and disrupting the feline's behavior.

In the southern portion of its range, the cougar and jaguar share overlapping territory.<ref name="HAMDIG">{{cite web |url=http://www.ecology.info/ecology-jaguar-puma.htm |first=Paul |last=Hamdig |title=Sympatric Jaguar and Puma |publisher=Ecology Online Sweden |accessdate=August 30 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> The jaguar tends to take larger prey and the cougar smaller where they overlap, reducing the cougar's size.<ref name="diet"/> Of the two felines, the cougar appears best able to exploit a broader prey niche and smaller prey.<ref name="foodhabits">{{cite journal |author=Rodrigo Nuanaez, Brian Miller, and Fred Lindzey |year=2000 |title=Food habits of jaguars and pumas in Jalisco, Mexico |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=252 |issue=3 |pages=373 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=58851 |accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref>

As with any predator at or near the top of its [[food chain]], the cougar impacts the population of prey species. Predation by cougars has been linked to changes in the species mix of deer in a region. For example, a study in British Columbia observed that the population of mule deer, a favored cougar prey, was declining while the population of the less frequently preyed-upon white-tailed deer was increasing.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Hugh S. |coauthors=Robert B.

==Hybrids==
[[Image:Pumapard-1904.jpg|thumb|Pumapard, taken in 1904]]
{{Main|Pumapard}}
A pumapard is a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] animal resulting from a union between a cougar and a [[leopard]]. Three sets of these hybrids were bred in the late 1890s and early 1900s by [[Carl Hagenbeck]] at his animal park in [[Hamburg]], Germany. Most did not reach adulthood. One of these was purchased in 1898 by [[Berlin]] Zoo. A similar hybrid in Berlin Zoo purchased from Hagenbeck was a cross between a male leopard and a female puma. Hamburg Zoo's specimen was the reverse pairing, the one in the black and white photo, fathered by a puma bred to an Indian leopardess. 
Whether born to a female puma mated to a male leopard, or to a male puma mated to a female leopard, pumapards inherit a form of dwarfism. Those reported grew to only half the size of the parents. They have a puma-like long body (proportional to the limbs, but nevertheless shorter than either parent), but short legs. The coat is variously described as sandy, tawny or greyish with brown, chestnut or "faded" rosettes.<ref name="Geo">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/pride_lands/Liger_Tigon.html|title=Geocites - Liger & Tigon Info|accessdate=9 June|accessyear=2008}}</ref>

==Conservation status==
The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) currently lists the cougar as a "[[near threatened]]" species. It has shifted the cougar's status from "least concern," while leaving open the possibility that it may be raised to "[[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]" when greater data on the cat's distribution becomes available.<ref name="iucn"/> The cougar is regulated under Appendix&nbsp;I of the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.shtml |title=Appendices I, II and III |accessdate=2007-05-24 |publisher=[[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]]}}</ref> rendering illegal international trade in specimens or parts.

[[Image:Cougar snow.jpg|thumb|left|Cougar conservation depends on preservation of their habitat.]]
East of the [[Mississippi]], the only unequivocally known cougar population is the [[Florida panther]]. The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] recognizes both an Eastern cougar and the Florida panther, affording protection under the [[Endangered Species Act]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/i/a/saa48.html |title=Eastern Cougar |accessdate=2007-05-20 | work=Endangered and Threatened Species of the Southeastern United States (The Red Book)| year=1991 |publisher=[[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/i/a/saa05.html |title=Florida Panther |accessdate=2007-06-07 | work=Endangered and Threatened Species of the Southeastern United States (The Red Book)| year=1993 |publisher=[[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]}}</ref> Certain taxonomic authorities have collapsed both designations into the [[North American Cougar]], with Eastern or Florida subspecies not recognized,<ref name="MSW3"/> while a subspecies designation remains recognized by some conservation scientists.<ref name=improving/> The most recent documented count for the Florida sub-population is 87 individuals, reported by recovery agencies in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://myfwc.com/panther/news/pdf/FWC2002-2003PantherGeneticRestorationAnnualReport.pdf |format=PDF |title=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 2002–2003 Panther Genetic Restoration Annual Report |accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref>

The cougar is also protected across much of the rest of their range. As of 1996, cougar hunting was prohibited in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Suriname]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Uruguay]]. (Costa Rica and Panama are not listed as current range countries by the IUCN.) The cat had no reported legal protection in [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Guyana]].<ref name="CAP"/> Regulated cougar hunting is still common in the United States and Canada, although they are protected from all hunting in the Yukon.; it is permitted in every U.S. state from the Rocky Mountains to the [[Pacific Ocean]], with the exception of [[California]]. Cougars are generally hunted with packs of dogs, until the animal is 'treed'. When the hunter arrives on the scene, he shoots the cat from the tree at close range. The Cougar cannot be legally killed in California except under very specific circumstances, such as when an individual is declared a public safety threat.<ref name="California"/> However statistics from the Department of Fish and Game indicate that cougar killings in California have been on the rise since 1970s with an average of over 112 cats killed per year from 2000 to 2006 compared to 6 per year in the 1970s.

Conservation threats to the species include persecution as a pest animal, degradation and fragmentation of their habitat, and depletion of their prey base. [[Wildlife corridor|Habitat corridors]] and sufficient range areas are critical to the sustainability of cougar populations. Research simulations have shown that the animal faces a low extinction risk in areas of 2200&nbsp;km² (850&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) or more. As few as one to four new animals entering a population per decade markedly increases persistence, foregrounding the importance of habitat corridors.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Beier |first=Paul |year=1993 |month=March |title=Determining Minimum Habitat Areas and Habitat Corridors for Cougars |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=94–108 |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0888-8892%28199303%297%3A1%3C94%3ADMHAAH%3E2.0.CO%3B2-I&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage |accessdate=2007-05-20 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1993.07010094.x}}</ref>

==Relationships with humans==
===In mythology and culture===
[[Image:MochePuma.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Moche]] puma, [[Larco Museum]] collection]]
The grace and power of the cougar have been widely admired in the cultures of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. The Inca city of [[Cusco]] is reported to have been designed in the shape of a cougar, and the animal also gave their name to both Inca regions and people. The [[Moche]] people represented the puma often in their ceramics.<ref>Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum. ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera]].'' New York: [[Thames and Hudson]], 1997.</ref> The sky and thunder god of the Inca, [[Viracocha]], has been associated with the animal.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kulmar |last=Tarmo |url=http://folklore.ee/folklore/vol12/inca.htm |coauthors=Kait Realo (translator) |title=On the role of Creation and Origin Myths in the Development of Inca State and Religion |accessdate=2007-05-22 |work=Electronic Journal of Folklore|publisher=Estonian Folklore Institute}}</ref>

In North America, mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared in the stories of the [[Hotcâk language]] ("Ho-Chunk" or "Winnebago") of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Illinois]]<ref>{{cite web |first=Jasper |last=Blowsnake |url=http://www.hotcakencyclopedia.com/ho.FourStepsOfCougar.html |title=The Four Steps of the Cougar |accessdate=2007-05-22 |work=Electronic Journal of Folklore |editor=Richard L. Dieterle |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Hotcâk (Winnebago) Mythology}}</ref> and the [[Cheyenne]], amongst others. To the [[Apache]] and [[Walapai]] of [[Arizona]], the wail of the Cougar was harbinger of death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ws/nwrc/is/living/cougar.pdf |title=Living with Wildlife: Cougars |accessdate=2007-05-22 |format=PDF |publisher=[[USDA Wildlife Services]]}}</ref>

The cougar continues to be a symbol of strength and stealth. From [[Eurocopter Cougar|combat helicopters]], motor vehicles (see [[Mercury Cougar|Ford/Mercury Cougar]] and [[Ford Puma]]) to [[Puma AG|athletic shoes]], both "Cougar" and "Puma" are widely used as [[Brand|brand names]]. Various sports teams have also adopted the names, including the [[Argentina national rugby union team]] as well as US universities, [[Brigham Young University]], The [[University of Houston]], [[Washington State University]], and The [[University of Vermont]]. Many places, such as [[Cougar Mountain]], are also named after their association with cougars.<!--we don't need a massive list here, please-->

===Livestock predation===
Cougars can cause severe economic hardship on those whose livelihoods depend on livestock. During the early years of ranching, cougars were considered on par with wolves in destructiveness. According to figures in Texas in 1990 for example, 86 calves, 253 Mohair goats, 302 Mohair kids, 445 sheep and 562 lambs were confirmed to have been killed by cougars that year. In Nevada in 1992, cougars were confirmed to have killed 9 calves, 1 horse, 4 colts, 5 goats, 318 sheep and 400 lambs. In both cases, sheep were the most frequently attacked. Some instances of [[surplus killing]] have resulting in the deaths of 20 sheep in one attack.<ref name="Livestock">{{cite web | url=http://www.aws.vcn.com/mountain_lion_fact_sheet.html | title = Mountain Lion Fact Sheet | publisher = Abundant Wildlife Society of North America | accessdate = 2008-07-10}}</ref> Cougars frequently kill calves, sheep and goats by biting the top of the neck or head, differing greatly from the throat bite used by coyotes and indiscriminate mutilation by feral dogs. The size of the tooth puncture marks also helps distinguish kills made by cougars from those made by smaller predators.<ref name="Predation">{{cite web | url=http://texnat.tamu.edu/ranchref/predator//cougars/t-cougar.htm | title = Cougar Predation - Description  | publisher = Procedures for Evaluating Predation on Livestock and Wildlife | accessdate = 2008-08-03}}</ref>

===Attacks on humans===
{{seealso|List of fatal cougar attacks in North America by decade}}
[[Image:MountainLionAttackProtocol.jpg|thumb|right|Mountain Lion warning sign]]

Due to the growth of [[urban area]]s, cougar ranges increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by [[humans]]. Attacks on humans are rare, as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize humans as prey.<ref name="Med">{{cite journal |last=McKee |first=Denise |year=2003 |title=Cougar Attacks on Humans: A Case Report |journal=Wilderness and Environmental Medicine |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=169–73 |publisher=Wilderness Medical Society |url=http://www.wemjournal.org/wmsonline/?request=get-document&issn=1080-6032&volume=014&issue=03&page=0169 |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref> Attacks on people, livestock, and pets may occur when the cat [[Habituation|habituates]] to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation.  Attacks are most frequent during late spring and summer, when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territory.<ref name="GovBC"/>

Between 1890 and 1990, in North America there were 53 reported and confirmed attacks on humans, resulting in 48 nonfatal injuries and 10 deaths of humans (the total is greater than 53 because some attacks had more than one victim).<ref name="Beier">{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Beier |url=http://users.frii.com/mytymyk/lions/beier.htm |title=Cougar attacks on humans in United States and Canada |work=Wildlife Society Bulletin |year=1991 |accessdate=2007-05-20 |publisher=Northern Arizon University}}</ref>  By 2004, the count had climbed to 88 attacks and 20 deaths.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/mtn_lion_attacks.shtml |title=Confirmed mountain lion attacks in the United States and Canada 1890 — Present |accessdate=2007-05-20 |publisher=Arizona Game and Fish}}</ref>

Within North America, the distribution of attacks is not uniform.  The heavily populated state of [[California]] has seen a dozen attacks since 1986 (after just three from 1890 to 1985), including three fatalities.<ref name="California"/>  Lightly populated [[New Mexico]] reported an attack in 2008, the first there since 1974.<ref>[http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/publications/press_releases/documents/2008/062308pinosaltoslion.html Search continues for mountain lion that killed Pinos Altos man], New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, press release June 23, 2008];  [http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/publications/press_releases/documents/2008/062508pinosaltoslion.html Wounded mountain lion captured, killed near Pinos Altos], New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, press release June 25, 2008];  [http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/publications/press_releases/documents/2008/070108pinosaltoslion2.html Second mountain lion captured near Pinos Altos], New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, press release July 1, 2008]</ref>

As with many predators, a cougar may attack if cornered, if a fleeing human stimulates their instinct to chase, or if a person "[[wikt:play dead|plays dead]]". Exaggerating the threat to the animal through intense eye contact, loud but calm shouting, and any other action to appear larger and more menacing, may make the animal retreat. Fighting back with sticks and rocks, or even bare hands, is often effective in persuading an attacking cougar to disengage.<ref name="Med"/><ref name="GovBC">{{cite web |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/cougsf.htm |title=Safety Guide to Cougars |work=Environmental Stewardship Division |year=1991 |accessdate=2007-05-28 |publisher=[[Government of British Columbia]], Ministry of Environment}}</ref>

When cougars do attack, they usually employ their characteristic neck bite, attempting to position their teeth between the [[vertebrae]] and into the [[spinal cord]]. Neck, head, and spinal injuries are common and sometimes fatal.<ref name="Med"/> Children are at greatest risk of attack, and least likely to survive an encounter. Detailed research into attacks prior to 1991 showed that 64% of all victims{{ndash}} and almost all fatalities{{ndash}} were children. The same study showed the highest proportion of attacks to have occurred in [[British Columbia]], particularly on [[Vancouver Island]] where cougar populations are especially dense.<ref name="Beier"/>
