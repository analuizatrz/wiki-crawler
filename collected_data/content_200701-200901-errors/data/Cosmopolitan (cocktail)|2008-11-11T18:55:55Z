A '''cosmopolitan''' is a [[cocktail]] made with [[vodka]], [[Cointreau]] or [[Triple Sec]], [[Cranberry|cranberry juice]], and fresh-squeezed [[lime (fruit)|lime]] juice or sweetened lime juice. Informally, it is referred to as a '''Cosmo'''. 

==History==

According to the [[International Bartenders Association]] the original recipe is based on [[vodka]] citron, lemon-[[flavored vodka]].<ref name="IBA" /> The cosmopolitan is a relative of cranberry coolers like the [[Cape Codder (cocktail)|Cape Codder]]<ref name="Grimes">

This origins of the cosmopolitan are somewhat disputed. It is likely that the drink was created independently by different bartenders since the 1970s<ref name="Harrington" />. It is generally recognized that John Caine brought the drink to San Francisco around 1987<ref name="Kilduff" /> from the [[Midwest]]<ref name="Kilduff" /><ref name="CityPages" />. The same year in Manhattan, the internationally recognized version of the cocktail was created by Toby Cecchini<ref name="Cook" />, based on a poorly described version of Cheryl Cook's creation<ref name="Cook" />.

A commonly cited story concerning the origins of this drink links [[South Beach, Florida]] bartender Cheryl Cook with the original creation<ref name="Grimes" /><ref name="Harrington" /><ref name="FoodMaven">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefoodmaven.com/diary/archives/00000024.html |title=The Frustrated Bartender |accessdate=2006-12-31 |last=Schwartz |first=Arthur |date=1999-06-30 |work=The Food Maven Diary }}</ref>.

{{cquote|What overwhelmed me was the number of people who ordered Martinis just to be seen with a Martini glass in their hand.

Her original recipes called for "Absolut Citron, a splash of [[Triple Sec]], a drop of Roses lime and just enough cranberry to make it oh so pretty in pink, "<ref name="Cook" />.

=== Toby Cecchini ===
Another important person involved in the creation of the drink was Toby Cecchini<ref name="Cook" /><ref>Cecchini, Toby. "Cosmopolitan: A Bartender's Life". New York: Broadway, 2003.</ref> of [[Manhattan]]. While working at The Odeon in 1987/1988, Cecchini worked from a poorly described version of Cook's original drink, and developed a slightly different version using [[Cointreau]] and fresh-squeezed lime juice. Cecchini's version has become an internationally standardized method for preparing the drink.<ref name="IBA">

==Popularity==
[[Image:My first Cosmo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|]]
The cosmopolitan gained popularity fairly quickly, traveling from Provincetown, through New York, Cleveland, and Cincinnati, and on to San Francisco (Caine<ref name="Kilduff"/>) or possibly from Miami to San Francisco, and on to New York (Cook<ref name="Cook" />).

The cosmopolitan gained popularity in the 1990s. It was further popularized among young women by its frequent mention on the television program ''[[Sex and the City]]'', where [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]'s character, [[Carrie Bradshaw]], commonly ordered the drink when out with her girlfriends. In the episode "Sex and the Country", Carrie goes to a [[drive-through]] diner and jokingly orders, "A cheese burger, large fries and a cosmopolitan please". The film adaptation made a reference to its popularity.

It is not only in television that the cosmo has influenced popular culture. [[Demeter Fragrance Library]] has created a cologne intended to smell like the cosmopolitan cocktail.

==Preparation and serving==
The cosmopolitan is usually served in a large [[cocktail glass]], also called a ''martini glass''. For this reason, the drink is sometimes mistakenly categorized as a type of [[martini (cocktail)|martini]].

Mix 2 parts lemon vodka to one part triple sec combined with one part cranberry and the juice of half a lime. Cointreau or other high-quality triple sec provides a cleaner taste than cheaper triple sec, and is generally substituted in the cosmopolitan. Grand Marnier produces a very sweet and cloying version and should be avoided.  The cranberry mainly adds colour and should not excessively dilute the drink.

A wedge of lemon or lime, or a twist of orange or lemon peel, are commonly used to [[Cocktail garnish|garnish]].  Traditionally a coin sized piece of orange should be "flamed" across the top of the drink.  This coats the drink with a slick of citrus oil, but also produces a flame.

==Variations==
* One variation is to squeeze a lime wedge into the chilled [[cocktail glass]] instead of including it with the [[ingredient]]s to be [[Cocktail shaker|shaken]].
* The original non-[[IBA Official Cocktail|IBA]] versions used [[Rose's lime juice|Rose's lime cordial]] instead of fresh lime juice, and [[Triple Sec]] instead of [[Cointreau]], and uses different proportions<ref name="IBA" />
* [[Sour mix]] may be substituted for either type of lime juice.
* A blue cosmopolitan may be made by using white cranberry juice instead of standard red juice, and blue [[curaçao liqueur|curaçao]] in place of the triple sec.
* A Cosmocello substitutes [[limoncello]] for the lime juice.
