The film, considered a [[cult classic]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.filmsite.org/cultfilmsew.html| title=ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY's 
The Top 50 Cult Movies
| accessdate=2008-02-11| publisher=Greatest Films at filmsite.org}}</ref>, is an adaption of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[musical theatre|musical stage production]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]''. [[Richard O'Brien]], author of the stage show<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/rockyhorror-rev.htm| title=The Rocky Horror Show| accessdate=2008-02-11| publisher=The British Theatre Guide}}</ref>, was assisted by [[Jim Sharman]] in writing the screenplay.  The movie introduces [[Tim Curry]] and features [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Barry Bostwick]] along with cast members from the original [[Kings Road]] production of the play. 

==Plot==
The story, narrated by a [[criminologist]] ([[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]]), is that of a newly engaged young couple, Brad Majors ([[Barry Bostwick]]) and Janet Weiss ([[Susan Sarandon]]), who find themselves lost and with a flat tire on a cold and rainy night. Seeking a phone with which to call for help, the two knock on the door of a nearby castle, which they find is inhabited by strange and outlandish people who are holding an Annual Transylvanian Convention. They watch, still wet from the rain, as the Transylvanians dance the [[Time Warp]], the film's signature song.

They are soon swept into the world of Dr. Frank N. Furter ([[Tim Curry]]), a bizarre and self-proclaimed "sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania" and his servants, brother and sister Riff-Raff ([[Richard O'Brien]]) and Magenta ([[Patricia Quinn]]), as well as a [[groupie]] Columbia ([[Nell Campbell]]) and an ensemble of convention attendees. It is Frank's intention to unveil the "secret to life itself". He takes the whole group up to his lab to "see what's on the slab".
[[Image:Rocky Horror 2.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Tim Curry as Frank N. Furter]] 
In a scene inspired by the classic Frankenstein movies, "Rocky Horror" ([[Peter Hinwood]]) is brought to life. The ensuing celebration is interrupted by Eddie ([[Meat Loaf]]), an ex-delivery boy, who rides out of a deep freeze on a motorcycle and performs a rock and roll number. Eddie enchants everyone and, in a jealous response, Frank corners and slaughters him with an ice axe.

Brad and Janet are shown to separate bedrooms, where each is visited and seduced in turn by Frank. Janet, upset and emotional, wanders off to look for Brad. She discovers Rocky, cowering in his birth tank, hiding from Riff Raff who has been tormenting him. She seduces the creature whilst Magenta and Columbia watch on their monitor. After discovering his creature is missing, Frank, Brad and Riff-Raff return to the lab, where Frank learns that an intruder has entered the building. Dr. Everett Scott ([[Jonathan Adams]]), Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie. Furter suspects Dr. Scott of working for the government investigating [[UFO]]s.

Rocky and the guests are served dinner, which they soon realize has been prepared from Eddie's remains. Janet runs screaming into Rocky's arms, and is chased through the halls of the castle by Frank and the rest following behind. Janet, Brad, Dr. Scott, Rocky, and Columbia all meet in Frank's lab, where Frank captures them with the Medusa Transducer, a machine which transforms them into living statues, and then forces them to perform in a [[cabaret]]-style floor show. The performance is interrupted by the appearance of Riff-Raff and Magenta, who stage a coup d'etat and announce their plan to return to the planet Transsexual. After explaining to Frank that he is not going back with them, they use a laser to kill him, and in the process also kill Columbia and Rocky. They release the remaining earthlings — Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott — warning them to get off the property; after they do so, the entire castle takes off into space to return to the planet of Transsexual, in the galaxy of Transylvania.

==Cast==
* [[Tim Curry]] as '''Dr. Frank N. Furter''' ([[baritone]]), a [[scientist]]. Frank is a flamboyant, often devious and (perceived to be) evil, [[hedonist]] [[Transvestism|transvestite]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] scientist.
* [[Susan Sarandon]] as '''Janet Weiss''' ([[soprano]]), a [[heroine]]. She is well-meaning, sweet and somewhat naive. She was recently engaged to Brad, and finds herself tempted into bad ways.

* [[Patricia Quinn]] as '''Magenta''' ([[contralto]]), a [[Domestic worker|domestic]]. Magenta is the twin sister of Riff-Raff, and works as Frank's domestic worker. Patricia Quinn's lips are used for the opening number and movie poster.

* [[Jonathan Adams]] as '''Dr. Everett Von Scott''' ([[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]), a rival scientist. He was Brad and Janet's high school science teacher. He has come to the castle in search of his nephew Eddie, who has been murdered by Frank.

==Production==
The original American productions of the stage musical were both produced by [[Lou Adler]] who is best known for his [[Cheech and Chong]] [[feature film]]s. Adler brought the production to the US in 1974 and later became executive producer of the film version.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004761/Lou-Adler.html| title=Lou Adler Biography| accessdate=2008-02-11| publisher=Musician Biographies}}</ref>

Many of the original cast and crew-members from the stage production returned to work on the film. Director [[Jim Sharman]], production designer [[Brian Thomson]], and costume designer [[Sue Blane]] collaborated on the original London production with many of the cast that
made it into the film version. Tim Curry reprised his role from the London and Los Angeles stage productions. After the film, Curry also did a short run on Broadway as Dr. Frank N. Furter. Creator Richard O'Brien (Riff Raff) also returned for the film from the British stage team, as did Little Nell (Columbia) and Patricia Quinn (Magenta)<ref>{{Cite web | url=wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/dbase/2005/rocky.doc | title=The Rocky Horror Picture Show | accessdate=2008-02-11| publisher=wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au}}</ref>. Jonathan Adams, the narrator from the original cast, also returned for the film, instead playing Dr. Scott. <ref name="Samuels_MidMov">{{cite book |title = Midnight Movies | last=Samuels | first=Stuart | publisher = Collier Books |year = 1983 | pages = 127, 132 | isbn=0-02-081450-X}}</ref> The film was shot at [[Bray Studios]] and [[Oakley Court]], a country house in [[Berkshire, England]], UK from 21 October 1974 to 19 December 1974. Filming of Rocky's birth occurred on 30 October 1974, the 81st anniversary of the birth of [[Charles Atlas]].<ref>{{cite book |title = The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book | last=Henkin | first=Bill | publisher = Dutton Adult |year = 1979 | pages = 16 | isbn=978-0801564369}}</ref>

''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' is slightly different from its original theatrical production. In the film, many of the original aspects from the stage show changed, as did characters and dialogue. All of the title character's lines were cut, making Rocky a mute who only sings during musical numbers. Eddie pops out of Coca-Cola machine on stage but rides out of a deep freeze in the film. Scenes were added for continuity and characters only mentioned in the musical were now in the opening scene. 

Several ideas from the original conception of the film were dropped before production. During the opening theme, the film was supposed to include clips from all the movies mentioned in the song "Science Fiction Double Feature".<ref name="script">{{web cite | url =http://www.godamongdirectors.com/scripts/rhps.shtml| author = O'Brien, Richard, Sharman, Jim | title = The Rocky Horror Picture Show (original shooting script)| work = www.godamongdirectors.com| accessdate=2007-07-01 |date = 2005-01-01 }} </ref> Producers discovered quickly that obtaining the rights to all the various film clips would be very costly, and cut the idea. Another idea was to parallel ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) by having the first 20 minutes of the film in black-and-white and [[Academy ratio]] until the doors burst open showing the Transylvanians in [[widescreen]] and then to full color at Frank's entrance.<ref name="script"/> This effect would have been prohibitively expensive, so the idea was discarded. The film was, however, shot in the narrower [[Aspect ratio (image)|1.66:1 aspect ratio]].

===Locations, sets and props===
[[Image:OakleyCourt.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Oakley Court refurbished and now a luxury hotel.]]
The film's plot, setting, and style echoes that of the [[Hammer Horror]] films, which had their own instantly recognisable style (just as [[Universal Studios]]' Horror films did), re-using sets and props through many of their films. Production designer Brian Thomson and director Jim Sharman chose locations, sets, and even props for the Rocky Horror Picture Show that were, in many cases, used in Hammer productions. The classic "Creation" scene in Rocky Horror is so reminiscent of "Frankenstein" movies because it uses the tank and dummy from a Hammer production of ''[[The Revenge of Frankenstein]]'' starring [[Peter Cushing]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/trivia | title = Trivia for The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref>

The castle is known as the Hammer House for the number of films that it appeared in. A great deal of location shooting took place here. At the time, the manor was in very dilapidated condition. Filming took place during autumn, which made conditions harsh. Today, the castle, [[Oakley Court]], has been completely refurbished and is now a luxury hotel.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.oakleycourt.co.uk/ | title = Welcome to Oakley Court |accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref>

===Costumes===
One of the more unusual aspects of the film were the costumes. Costume designer [[Sue Blane]] based all her designs on what little she knew of 1950's America. A previous production she had designed called "The Maids" also starred Tim Curry in a victorian [[corset]]. This same corset was used in the london stage production and then used again in the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedimaginations.com/interviews.html|title="Don't Blane Sue-she just made the costumes!"|accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref> Blane compared the relatively small ($400) costume budget of the stage show to the $1600 costume budget in 1974 for the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockymusic.org/showdoc/SueBlane-1979Interview.php|last=Morrisroe|first=Patricia|title=The costume designer for Rocky Horror shows her stuff.|accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref>

Nearly all the costume designs from the original stage production were used in the film, with a few exceptions. Some new designs appeared and a few old ones were discarded. In the London stage production, Tim Curry began the role of Frank-N-Furter as a blond, and although it was short lived, the original design sketches by Blane do reflect that. Magenta gained a new maid costume to give the character more purpose and Columbia gained a sequined evening coat.

The introduction of new characters such as the Transylvanians presented Sue Blane with a challenge to costume a number of extras who reappear throughout the film. The outcome of their costuming did not satisfy Blane who stated that she wished she had more time for those particular costumes.

In the stage productions, actors generally did their own make-up, but for this film producers chose Pierre La Roche to redesign the make-up for each character (he had previously designed make-up for [[David Bowie]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0478929/| title=Pierre La Roche | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> Production stills were taken by 1970's rock photographer, [[Mick Rock]] who has published many calendars and photo books from his Rocky Horror work.

As part of the audience participation fans recreate the costumes to wear to screenings. Like other movie fans, participants at Rocky Horror wear their costumes while attending contest at conventions as well as on the weekends at local showings of the movie. Fans go to great lengths to be as faithful to the designs as possible. The quality of these costumes range from the unrecognisable to faithful screen replicas.

==Release==
The film has enjoyed an unusually long run, both in the US and Internationally. The movie is considered to be the longest running release in film history.<ref>{{Cite press release | url = http://www.rockyhorror.com/news/pr_25thannivdvd.php | title = Fox Celebrates 25 Years of Absolute Pleasure, Pop Culture Phenomenon and Midnight Classic | publisher = RHPS Official Fan Site | date = 2000-08-24 | accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> It has never been pulled by Twentieth Century Fox from its original 1975 release, and continues to play in cinemas more than thirty years later. Some cinemas showing the movie have run it for decades at a time.

The film was released on [[VHS]] during the [[home video]] boom of the 1980s, except for in the U.S., which had to wait for the 15th anniversary in 1990. In 1993, a [[LaserDisc|Laserdisc]] edition was released, and in 1995 a Special Edition Laserdisc was released. On the 25th anniversary in 2000, a DVD was released with all the special features from the Laserdisc, as well as new features and [[DVD-ROM]] games. Before the mainstream use of home video, a [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] version of selected scenes of the film was available.<ref>Piro, Sal and Hess, Michael (1991) ''The Official Rocky Horror Picture Show Audience Par-tic-i-pation Guide.'' Livonia, MI: Stabur Press. 77.</ref>

There are two versions of ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'', the US and British releases. The British version contains the original ending with the full version of the musical number "Super Heroes". The US version omits the number, as the studio thought it was too depressing. Both versions are on the 25th Anniversary DVD.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/alternateversions| title=Alternate versions for The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)

==Reception==
{{main|The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following}}
The film opened in the US at the UA Theatre in Westwood, California on 26 September 1975. It did well at that location but not elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book |title = The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book | author= Henkin, Bill | publisher = Dutton Adult |year = 1979 | pages = 25 | ISBN=978-0801564369}}</ref> The [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following|cult following]] did not begin until the movie began its midnight run at the Waverly Theatre in New York on 1 April 1976.<ref>{{cite book |title = The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book | author= Henkin, Bill | publisher = Dutton Adult |year = 1979 | pages = 26 | ISBN=978-0801564369}}</ref> The film is still shown with audience members acting out the entire movie in front of the screen. The [http://www.clintonsttheater.com/ Clinton Street Theater] in [[Portland, Oregon]] has also shown the movie weekly since its debut there in April, 1978.

Overall, critics were negative with their reviews of the movie. The overly sexual nature of this British rock comedy was not well received by the mainstream US media of 1975, although there were positive reviews. The music was praised, as was Tim Curry's performance. However, before the success of the midnight screenings, the film was withdrawn from its eight opening cities due to very small audiences, and its planned New York opening (on Halloween night) was cancelled.<ref name="Samuels_MidMov_133">{{cite book |title = Midnight Movies | last=Samuels | first=Stuart | publisher = Collier Books |year = 1983 | pages = 133 | ISBN=0-02-081450-X}}</ref> Fox re-released it around college campuses on a double-bill with another rock music film parody, [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'', but again it drew small audiences.<ref name="Samuels_MidMov_133" /> With ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972) and ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' (1936) making money in midnight showings nationwide, ''RHPS'' was eventually screened at midnight, starting in New York City on April Fools' Day of 1976.<ref name="Samuels_MidMov_134">{{cite book |title = Midnight Movies | last=Samuels | first=Stuart | publisher = Collier Books |year = 1983 | pages = 134 | ISBN=0-02-081450-X}}</ref> By that Halloween, people were attending in costume and talking back to the screen. By mid-1978, ''RHPS'' was playing in over fifty locations on Fridays and Saturdays at midnight, newsletters were published by local performance groups, and fans gathered for ''Rocky Horror'' conventions.<ref name="Samuels_MidMov_136">{{cite book |title = Midnight Movies | last=Samuels | first=Stuart | publisher = Collier Books |year = 1983 | pages = 136 | ISBN=0-02-081450-X}}</ref> By the end of 1979, there were twice-weekly showings at over 230 theaters.<ref name="Samuels_MidMov_137">{{cite book |title = Midnight Movies | last=Samuels | first=Stuart | publisher = Collier Books |year = 1983 | pages = 137 | ISBN=0-02-081450-X}}</ref>

''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' has taken in $139,876,417 (USA) (sub-total) in box office receipts since its release.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/business| title=Box office / business for The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) | accessdate=2007-08-02| publisher=www.imdb.com}}</ref> The length of its run in cinemas (weekly for over 30 years), combined with its considerable total box office gross, is unparalleled by any other film.<ref>{{web cite | url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/records/limited_releases.php | title=The Numbers - Top 50 Movies Never to Go Into Wide Release | publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]] | date=2007-06-13 | accessdata=2007-06-13}}</ref> The original budget for the movie was $1,200,000 (estimated).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/business| title=Box office / business for The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) | accessdate=2007-08-02| publisher=www.imdb.com}}</ref> The audience participation made the film become a worldwide phenomenon. As the cult-audience grew, ''Rocky Horror'' fandom became the subject of news stories. Dori Hartley, a fan from the original New York shadow cast, went on to appear in "Paradise Garage", a Tim Curry [[music video]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/dori-hartley | title = Dori Hartley | work =[[Answers.com]] | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-06-13}}</ref>

After the release, the original advertising campaign for screen and television was pulled by Twentieth Century Fox executives in the very early stage. The studio objected to the use of the red lipsticked lips uttering the words Twentieth Century Fox. The American [[television network]] [[Fox Broadcasting]] aired the film's much-publicized US television premiere on 25 October 1993. The film's popularity breathed new life to the stage production, which had had a 45-performance run on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] early in 1975 at the [[Belasco Theatre]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3732 | title=The Rocky Horror Show | publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]] | accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref> [[Rocky Horror Sequels and other Media|''Rocky Horror'' sequels and other media]] have found their way into production, including merchandise ranging from prefabricated costumes, [[game]]s, and [[soundtrack]] releases.

==Sequels, scripts and remake==
The original stage production has been revived on Broadway and was nominated for four Tony Awards in 2001, including Best Revival of a Musical. Interest for other movies by both hardcore fans as well as the more mainstream audience has been around for some time. In 1981, [[Twentieth Century Fox]] released "''[[Shock Treatment]]''", the follow up film by the same artistic group and with many of the original British cast. It was never in general release, but premiered straight to the midnight circuit. This stand-alone feature was not a direct sequel to the original film. It told the continuing story of Brad and Janet against characters portrayed by the same actors from the first film with the notable exceptions of Tim Curry, Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon. The original script was titled "''Rocky Horror Shows His Heels''" and began as a direct sequel until the idea was changed due to unavailability of some of the original cast. So the story was changed as well as the title, becoming first  "''The Brad and Janet Show''" and finally "''Shock Treatment''".

Another script was written by the original author, Richard O'Brien, some years later, intended as a direct sequel. Entitled "[[Revenge of the Old Queen]]" it was never made and O'Brien himself has been quoted as saying it never will.

[[MTV Films]] and [[Sky Movies]] are planning to remake ''The Rocky Horror Picture show''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117989391.html?categoryid=13&cs=1| title=MTV readies 'Rocky Horror' redux| accessdate=2008-02-11| publisher=Variety}}</ref>. The network is planning a 2-hour-long remake to be based on the original screenplay, and featuring songs not included in the original. The film is anticipated to be released sometime during [[Halloween]] [[2009 in film|2009]]. When interviewed, shock rocker [[Marilyn Manson]] claimed he had been approached by 20th Century Fox to play Frank N. Furter, in an updated version of the ''Rocky Horror Picture Show'', tentatively titled ''Rocky Horror''{{Fact|date=November 2008}}. 

The creator of the original, [[Richard O'Brien]], will not be involved; he has said that while he has no view on whether it should be remade, it does not have his blessing.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7559471.stm| title=Rocky remake leaves O'Brien cold | accessdate=2008-02-11| publisher=BBC NEWS}}</ref>
