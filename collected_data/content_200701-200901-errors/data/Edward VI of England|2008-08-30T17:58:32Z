'''Edward VI''' ([[12 October]] [[1537]] &ndash; [[6 July]] [[1553]]) became [[List of English monarchs|King of England]] and [[King of Ireland|Ireland]], on [[28 January]] [[1547]], and was crowned on 20 February, at nine years of age.<ref>Henry VIII had replaced the style "Lord of Ireland" with "King of Ireland" in 1541; Edward also maintained the [[English claim to the French throne]] but did not rule [[France]]. See {{Harvnb|Scarisbrick|1971|pp=548–49}}, and {{Harvnb|Lydon|1998|p=119}}.</ref> Edward, the son of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Jane Seymour]], was the third monarch of the [[Tudor dynasty]] and England's first ruler to be born a [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. Edward's entire reign was mediated through a [[Regent|Regency Council]], as he never reached maturity. The council was first led by his uncle, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (1547–1549), and then by [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]] (1549–1553).

Edward's reign was marked by economic problems, military withdrawal from [[Scotland]] and [[Boulogne]], and social unrest. It also saw the transformation of the Anglican Church. Henry VIII had severed the link between the [[Church of England]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]] and during Edward's reign Protestantism was fully [[established church|established]] for the first time in England, with [[Thomas Cranmer]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], introducing the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. 

When Edward fell terminally ill in 1553, he and his council drafted a "[[Device for the Succession|Device]]", to avert a Catholic succession. This made [[Lady Jane Grey]], Edward's  Protestant cousin, the first [[Succession to the British throne|in line to the throne]] by excluding his two half sisters, the Catholic [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and Protestant [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. Edward's death at the age of 15 triggered a disputed succession. Jane was queen for only nine days, before Mary was recognised. As queen, Mary proceeded to undo many of Edward's Protestant reforms, but [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement| Elizabeth's religious settlement]] of 1559 was to secure his Protestant legacy.

==Early life==

[[Image:Edward VI by Holbein.jpg|thumb| Prince Edward in 1539, by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]. He holds a golden rattle that resembles a sceptre; and the Latin inscription urges him to equal or surpass his father.<ref>{{Harvnb|Foister|2006|p=100}}</ref>]]

===Birth===

Prince Edward was born on 12 October 1537 at [[Hampton Court Palace]], to the west of [[London]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=4}}</ref> He was the son of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] by his third wife, [[Jane Seymour]]. Throughout the realm, the people greeted the birth of a male heir, "whom we hungered for so long",<ref>[[Hugh Latimer]], bishop of Worcester, quoted by {{Harvnb|Erickson|1978|p=181}}</ref> with joy and relief. ''[[Te Deum]]s'' were sung in churches, bonfires lit, and "their<!--[''sic'']--> was shott at the Tower that night above two thousand gonnes".<ref name=Lbapt>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=5–6}}</ref> Jane, who appeared to recover quickly from a prolonged labour, sent out pre-signed letters announcing the birth of "a Prince, conceived in most lawful matrimony between my Lord the King's Majesty and us".<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|2004|p=607}}</ref> Edward was [[Infant baptism|christened]] on 15 October, with Princess Mary as godmother and Princess Elizabeth carrying the [[chrism]], or baptismal cloth;<ref name=Lbapt>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=5–6}}</ref> and the [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter King of Arms]] proclaimed him as [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Earl of Chester]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Erickson| 1978|p=182}}</ref> Jane Seymour, however, suddenly fell ill on 23 October from presumed postnatal complications, and she died the following night.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=6–7}}; {{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=19}}. Claims that Edward was born by [[caesarian section]] came from uninformed or hostile sources and are now doubted. Jane was reported as recovering quickly at first. Some commentators have assumed her death was caused by [[puerperal fever]], which cannot be ruled out, though the suddenness of her delayed illness and death do not correspond with the symptoms. Edward's biographer Jennifer Loach, followed by Chris Skidmore, believes she may have retained parts of the [[placenta]] in her womb, resulting in a haemorrhage.</ref> Henry VIII wrote to [[Francis I of France]] that "Divine Providence ... hath mingled my joy with bitterness of the death of her who brought me this happiness".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=20}}</ref>

===Upbringing and education=== 

Edward was a healthy baby who sucked strongly from the first. Henry was delighted with him; in May 1538, the king was observed "dallying with him in his arms ... and so holding him in a window to the sight and great comfort of the people".<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=8}}</ref> That September, the Lord Chancellor, [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Thomas, Lord Audley]], reported Edward's rapid growth and vigour;<ref>"[He] shotyth owt in length, and wexith ferme and stiff, and can steadfastly stond, and would avaunce hym self to move and go, if they wold suffir hym". Thomas Audley, quoted in {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=8}}</ref> and other accounts describe him as a tall and merry child. The tradition that Edward VI was a sickly boy has been challenged by some historians.<ref> {{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=372}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=161}}</ref> At the age of four, he fell ill with a life-threatening "quartan fever",<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=27.}} A fever recurring about every four days, today usually associated with [[malaria]].</ref> but, despite occasional illnesses and poor eyesight, he enjoyed generally good health until the last six months of his life.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=33, 177, 223–34, 260.}} Edward was also ill in 1550 and "of the measles and the smallpox" in 1552. Skidmore suggests that the latter dangerously weakened his immune system.</ref>

Edward was at first placed in the care of [[Margaret Bryan|Margaret, Lady Bryan]], "lady mistress" of the prince's household, and until the age of six he was brought up, as he put it later in his ''Chronicle'', "among the women".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=22}}; {{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|pp=37–38}}</ref> A formal royal household was established around him, at first under Sir William Sidney, and later under Sir Richard Page, the stepfather of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]]'s wife, [[Anne Stanhope]]. Henry demanded the utmost security and standards of cleanliness in his son's household, stressing that Edward was "this whole realm's most precious jewel".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=23}}; {{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|pp=38–39}}</ref> Visitors described the prince, who had his own troupe of [[minstrel]]s and was lavishly provided with toys and comforts, as a contented child.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=9–11}}</ref> 

From the age of six, Edward began his formal education under [[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]] and [[John Cheke]], concentrating, as he recalled himself, on "learning of tongues, of the scripture, of philosophy, and all liberal sciences";<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=11–12}}; {{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=42.}} For example, he read biblical texts, [[Distichs of Cato|Cato]], [[Aesop's Fables]], and [[Joan Lluís Vives|Vives]]'s ''Satellitium Vivis'', which had been written for his sister Mary.</ref> he later also received tuition from Elizabeth's tutor, [[Roger Ascham]], among others, and in French from [[Jean Belmain]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=13.}} He also learned Spanish and Italian.</ref> In addition, he is known to have studied [[geometry]] and learned to play musical instruments, including the [[lute]] and the [[virginals]]. He collected globes and maps and, according to coinage historian C. E. Challis, developed a grasp of monetary affairs that suggests a high intelligence. Little is known of Edward's religious education, which is assumed to have been moderately Protestant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=40}}</ref> His religious establishment was probably chosen by [[Thomas Cranmer| Archbishop Thomas Cranmer]], a leading reformer; and both Cox and Cheke were "reformed" Catholics or [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmians]] and later became [[Marian exiles]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=41}}</ref> By 1549, Edward had written a [[treatise]] on the pope as [[Antichrist]] and was making informed notes on theological controversies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=13–16}}</ref> Many aspects of Edward's religion were still essentially Catholic at this stage, including celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and reverence for images and relics of the saints.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=38}}</ref>

[[Image:Hans Holbein d. J. 045.jpg|thumb|[[Portrait miniature]] of Edward by an unknown artist, c. 1543–46<ref>This miniature , formerly attributed to [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], is now thought likely to be by a follower of [[William Scrots]]. One of several versions derived from the same pattern, the background inscription gives Edward's age as six, but this has been doubted after x-rays of the underpainting. See {{Harvnb|Strong|1969|pp=92–93}}, and {{Harvnb|Rowlands|1985|pp=235–36}}.</ref>]]

Both Edward's sisters were attentive to their brother and often visited him—on one occasion, Elizabeth gave him a shirt "of her own working".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=26}}</ref> Edward "took special content" in Mary's company, though he disapproved of her taste for foreign dances; "I love you most", he wrote to her in 1546.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=38–37}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=16}}</ref> In 1543, Henry invited his three children to spend Christmas with him, signalling his reconciliation with his daughters, whom he had previously illegitimized and disinherited. The following spring, he restored them to their place in the succession with a [[Third Succession Act]], which also provided for a regency council during Edward's minority.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mackie|1952|pp=413–14}}; {{Harvnb|Guy|1988|p=196.}} Henry made the recognition of his daughters conditional on approved marriages, among other things. He reserved the choosing of the regency council for his will.</ref> This unaccustomed family harmony may have owed much to the influence of Henry's new wife [[Catherine Parr]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|2004|p=720}}</ref> of whom Edward soon became fond. He called her his "most dear mother" and in September 1546 wrote to her: "I received so many benefits from you that my mind can hardly grasp them".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=34}}</ref> 

Other children were brought to play with Edward, including the granddaughter of Edward's chamberlain Sir William Sidney, who in adulthood recalled the prince as "a marvellous sweet child, of very mild and generous condition".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=28–29}}</ref> Edward shared his formal education with sons of nobles, "appointed to attend upon him" in what was a form of miniature court.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=31}}</ref> Among these, Barnaby Fitzpatrick, the son of an Irish peer, became a close and lasting friend.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=44}}</ref> Edward was more devoted to his schoolwork than his classmates and seems to have outshone them, motivated to do his "duty" and compete with his sister Elizabeth's academic prowess, though Cox felt it necessary to beat him on at least one occasion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=36–38}}; {{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=43}}</ref> His surroundings and possessions were regally splendid: his rooms were hung with costly Flemish [[tapestries]], and his clothes, books, and cutlery were encrusted with precious jewels and gold.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=35–36}}</ref> Like his father, Edward was fascinated by military arts, and many of his portraits show him wearing a gold dagger with a jewelled hilt, in imitation of Henry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=36}}; {{Harvnb|Strong|1969|p=92}}. Such portraits were modelled on [[Hans Holbein the Younger| Holbein]]'s depiction of [[Henry VIII]] for a wall-painting at [[Palace of Whitehall| Whitehall]] in 1537, in which Henry confronts the viewer wearing a dagger. See [[:Image:Remigius van Leemput 001.jpg| Remigius van Leemput's 1667 copy]] of the mural, which was destroyed in a fire in 1698.</ref> Edward's ''Chronicle'' enthusiastically details English military campaigns against Scotland and France, and adventures such as [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|John Dudley]]'s near capture at [[Musselburgh]] in 1547.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=53–54}}</ref>

===Rough wooing===

On 1 July 1543, Henry VIII had signed the [[Treaty of Greenwich]] with the Scots, sealing the peace with Edward's [[betrothal]] to the seven-month-old [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary, Queen of Scots]]. The Scots were in a weak bargaining position after their defeat at [[Battle of Solway Moss|Solway Moss]] the previous November, and Henry, seeking to unite the two realms, stipulated that Mary be handed over to him to be brought up in England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=30}}</ref> When the Scots repudiated the treaty in December 1543 and renewed their alliance with France, Henry was enraged. In April 1544, he ordered Edward's uncle, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset| Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford]], to invade Scotland and "put all to fire and sword, burn Edinburgh town, so razed and defaced when you have sacked and gotten what ye can of it, as there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon [them] for their falsehood and disloyalty".<ref>{{Harvnb|Wormald|2001|p=58}}</ref> Seymour responded with the most savage campaign ever launched by the English against the Scots.<ref>"His detailed reports to his master are a hideous record of fire and bloodshed, chronicled in the most factual and laconic manner." {{Harvnb|Wormald|2001|p=59}}</ref> The war, which continued into Edward's reign, has become known as "[[The Rough Wooing]]".

==Accession==

Henry VIII died on [[28 January]] [[1547]], when Edward was only nine. Those close to the throne, led by Edward Seymour and [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|William Paget]], agreed to delay the announcement of the king's death until arrangements had been made for a smooth succession. Seymour and [[Sir Anthony Browne (d.1548)|Sir Anthony Browne]], the [[Master of the Horse]], rode to collect Edward from [[Hertford]] and brought him to [[Enfield]], where Princess Elizabeth was living. There he and Elizabeth were told of the death of their father and heard a reading of the will.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|pp=51–52}}; {{Harvnb|Loades|2004|p=28}}</ref> The Lord Chancellor, [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Thomas Wriothesley]], announced Henry's death to parliament on 31 January, and general proclamations of Edward's succession were ordered.<ref name =Lsu>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=29}}</ref> The new king was taken to the [[Tower of London]], where he was welcomed with "great shot of ordnance in all places there about, as well out of the Tower as out of the ships".<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=52}}</ref> The following day, the nobles of the realm made their obedience to Edward at the Tower, and Seymour was announced as Protector.<ref name =Lsu>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=29}}</ref> Henry VIII was buried at Windsor on 16 February, in the same tomb as Jane Seymour, as he had wished. 

Edward VI was crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]] four days later on Sunday 20 February, the first coronation in England for almost forty years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=30–38}}</ref> The ceremonies were reduced from their usual proportions because of the "tedious length of the same which should weary and be hurtsome peradventure to the King's majesty, being yet of tender age", and also because the Reformation had rendered some of them inappropriate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|pp=65–66}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=35–37}}</ref> On the eve of the coronation, Edward progressed on horseback from the Tower to the [[Palace of Westminster]] through thronging crowds and [[pageants]], many based on the pageants for a previous boy king, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=33}}</ref> He laughed at a Spanish [[tightrope walking|tightrope walker]] who "tumbled and played many pretty toys" outside [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=59}}</ref> At the coronation service, Cranmer affirmed the [[Acts of Supremacy|royal supremacy]] and called Edward a second [[Josiah]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=61}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=62}}</ref> urging him to continue the reformation of the [[Church of England]], "the tyranny of the Bishops of Rome banished from your subjects, and images removed".<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=67}}</ref> After the service, Edward presided at a banquet in [[Westminster Hall]], where, he recalled in his ''Chronicle'', he dined with his crown on his head.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|pp=65–69}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=29–38}}</ref>

==Somerset's Protectorate==

===Council of Regency===

[[Image:Edward Seymour.jpg|thumb|Edward VI's uncle, Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, ruled England in the name of his nephew as Lord Protector from 1547 to 1549.]]

Henry VIII's [[will (law)|will]] named sixteen [[executor]]s, who were to act as Edward's council until he reached the age of 18. These executors were supplemented by twelve men "of counsail" who would assist the executors when called on.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=17–18}}; {{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=56}}</ref> The final shape of Henry VIII's will has been the subject of controversy. Some historians suggest that those close to the king manipulated either him or the will itself to ensure a shareout of power to their benefit, both material and religious. In this reading, the composition of the [[Privy Chamber]] shifted towards the end of 1546 in favour of the reforming [[political faction|faction]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|2002|pp=130–145}}</ref> In addition, two leading conservative Privy Councillors were removed from the centre of power. [[Stephen Gardiner]] was refused access to Henry during his last months. [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]], found himself accused of [[treason]]; the day before the king's death his vast estates were seized, making them available for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward's reign in the [[Tower of London]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|2002|pp=130–145}}; {{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=330–31}}</ref> Other historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion was based on non-religious matters, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on the council, and that the radicalism of men such as [[Anthony Denny|Sir Anthony Denny]], who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, is debatable. Whatever the case, Henry's death was followed by a lavish hand-out of lands and honours to the new power group.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=19–25}}</ref> The will contained an "unfulfilled gifts" clause, added at the last minute, which allowed Henry's executors to freely distribute lands and honours to members of the council and the court,<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|2002|p=142}}; {{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=332.}} [[David Starkey]] describes this distribution of benefits as typical of "the shameless back-scratching of the alliance"; [[Geoffrey Elton|G. R. Elton]] calls the changes to the will "convenient".</ref> particularly to [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford]], who became the [[Lord Protector|Lord Protector of the Realm]], Governor of the King's Person, and the [[Duke of Somerset]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=19–25}}</ref> 

In fact, Henry VIII's will did not provide for the appointment of a Protector. It entrusted the government of the realm during his son's minority to a Regency Council that would rule collectively, by majority decision, with "like and equal charge".<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|2002|pp=138–39}}; {{Harvnb|Alford|2002|p=69.}} The existence of a council of executors alongside the Privy Council was rationalised in March when the two became one, incorporating the executors and most of their appointed assistants and adding [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], who had protested at his exclusion from power.</ref> Nevertheless, a few days after Henry's death, on 4 February, the executors chose to invest almost regal power in Edward Seymour.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=7}}; {{Harvnb|Alford|2002|p=65}}</ref> Thirteen out of the sixteen (the others being absent) agreed to his appointment as Protector, which they justified as their joint decision "by virtue of the authority" of Henry's will.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|2002|pp=138–39}}; {{Harvnb|Alford|2002|p=67}}</ref> Seymour may have done a deal with some of the executors, who almost all received hand-outs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=26–27}}; {{Harvnb|Elton|1962|p=203}}</ref> He is known to have done so with [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|William Paget]], private secretary to Henry VIII,<ref>In 1549, Paget was to remind Seymour: "Remember what you promised me in the gallery at Westminster before the breath was out of the body of the king that dead is. Remember what you promised immediately after, devising with me concerning the place which you now occupy ... and that was to follow mine advice in all your proceedings more than any other man's". Quoted in {{Harvnb|Guy|1988|p=211}}</ref> and to have secured the support of [[Sir Anthony Browne (d.1548)|Sir Anthony Browne]] of the Privy Chamber.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alford|2002|pp=67–68}}</ref>

Seymour's appointment was in keeping with historical precedent, <ref>{{Harvnb|Alford|2002|pp=49–50, 91–92}}; {{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=333.}} Uncles of the king had been made Protector in 1422 and 1483 during the minorities of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] and [[Edward V of England|Edward VI]] (though not also Governor of the King's Person, as Seymour's brother [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas]], who coveted the role for himself, pointed out).</ref> and his eligibility for the role was reinforced by his military successes in Scotland and France. In March 1547, he secured [[letters patent]] from King Edward granting him the almost monarchical right to appoint members to the Privy Council himself and to consult them only when he wished.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alford|2002|p=70}} ; {{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|pp=73–75.}} In 1549, William Paget described him as king in all but name.</ref> In the words of historian [[Geoffrey Elton|G. R Elton]], "from that moment his autocratic system was complete".<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=334, 338}}</ref> He proceeded to rule largely by [[proclamation]], calling on the Privy Council to do little more than rubber-stamp his decisions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alford|2002|p=66}}</ref>

Somerset's takeover of power went smoothly. The [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial ambassador]], Van der Delft, reported that he "governs everything absolutely", with Paget operating as his secretary, though he predicted trouble from [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|John Dudley]], who had recently been raised to [[Earl of Warwick]] in the share-out of honours.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|pp=69, 76–77}}; {{Harvnb|Skidmore| 2007|pp=64–63}}</ref> In fact, in the early weeks of his Protectorate, Somerset was challenged only by the Chancellor, [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Thomas Wriothesley]], whom the [[Earl of Southampton|Earldom of Southampton]] had evidently failed to buy off, and by his own brother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=333}}</ref> Wriothesley, a religious conservative, objected to Somerset’s moves to assume monarchical power over the council. He then found himself abruptly  removed from the chancellorship on charges of selling off some of his offices to delegates.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|2004|pp=33–34}}; {{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=333}}</ref> His removal forestalled the forming of factions within the council.

===Thomas Seymour===

Somerset faced less manageable opposition from his younger brother [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley| Thomas Seymour]], who has been described as a "worm in the bud".<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|2004|p=34}}</ref> As King Edward's uncle, Thomas Seymour demanded the governorship of the king’s person and a greater share of power.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=333, 346.}} Some historians believe that [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|John Dudley]], who was to challenge Somerset in 1549, encouraged Thomas Seymour to make these demands.</ref> Somerset tried to appease his brother with a [[baron|barony]] and appointment to the [[Admiralty|Lord Admiralship]] and a seat on the Privy Council—but Thomas was bent on scheming for power. He began smuggling pocket money to King Edward, telling him that Somerset held the purse strings too tight, making him a "beggarly king".<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|204|p=36}}</ref> He also urged him to throw off the Protector within two years; but Edward, schooled to defer to the council, failed to co-operate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|2004|pp=36–37}}</ref> In April, using Edward’s support to circumvent Somerset’s opposition, Thomas Seymour secretly married Henry VIII's widow [[Catherine Parr]], whose Protestant household included the 11-year-old [[Lady Jane Grey]] and the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Erickson|1978|p=234}}</ref> 

In summer 1548, a pregnant Catherine Parr discovered Thomas Seymour embracing Princess Elizabeth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Somerset|1997|p=23}}</ref> Princess Elizabeth was removed from Catherine Parr's household and transferred to Sir Anthony Denny's. That September, Catherine Parr died in childbirth, and Thomas Seymour promptly resumed his attentions to Elizabeth by letter, planning to marry her. Elizabeth was receptive, but, like Edward, unready to agree to anything unless permitted by the council.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|2004|pp=37–38}}</ref> In January 1549, the council, led by John Dudley, who had just engineered the recall of Wriothesley, had Thomas Seymour arrested on various charges, including [[embezzlement]] at the Bristol [[mint]]. King Edward, whom Seymour was accused of planning to marry to [[Lady Jane Grey]], himself testified about the pocket money.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|2004|pp=40–41}}; {{Harvnb|Alford|2002|pp=96–97}}</ref> Lack of clear evidence for treason ruled out a trial, so Seymour was condemned instead by an [[Bill of Attainder|Act of Attainder]] and beheaded on 20 March 1549.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alford|2002|pp=91–97}}</ref> The execution the Protector's brother had at last given his enemies a chance to damage him. From this time, Somerset was increasingly under threat.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=346–47}}</ref> It was the latest of a series of disasters that had marked the Protector's rule.

===War===

Somerset’s only undoubted skill was as a soldier, which he had proved on expeditions to Scotland and in the defence of [[Boulogne]] in 1546. From the first, his main interest as Protector was the war against Scotland. After a crushing victory at the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]] in September 1547, he set up a network of garrisons in Scotland, stretching as far north as [[Dundee]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mackie|1952|p=484}}</ref> His initial successes, however, were followed by a loss of direction, as his aim of uniting the realms through conquest became increasingly unrealistic. The Scots allied with France, who sent reinforcements for the defence of Edinburgh in 1548,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mackie|1952|p=485}}</ref> while [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], was removed to France, where she was betrothed to the [[dauphin]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wormald|2001|p=62}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=52–53.}} The dauphin was the future [[Francis II of France]], son of [[Henry II of France]].</ref> The cost of maintaining the Protector's massive armies and his permanent garrisons in Scotland also placed an unsustainable burden on the royal finances. A French attack on Boulogne in August 1549, at last forced Somerset to begin a withdrawal from Scotland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=340–41}}</ref>

===Rebellion===

During 1548, England was subject to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out in England, fuelled by various religious and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]], arose mainly from the imposition of church services in English, and the second, led by a tradesman called [[Kett's Rebellion|Robert Kett]], mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=70–83}}</ref> A complex aspect of the rebellions was that the protestors believed they were acting legitimately against [[enclosure|enclosing]] landlords with the Protector's support, the landlords being the lawbreakers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=347–350}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=66–67, 86.}} For example, in Hereford, a man was recorded as saying that "by the king's proclamation all enclosures were to be broken up".</ref> 

The same justification for outbreaks of unrest was voiced throughout the country, not only in Norfolk and the west. The origin of the popular view of Somerset as sympathetic to the rebel cause lies partly in his series of sometimes liberal, often contradictory, proclamations,<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=60–61, 66–68, 89}}; {{Harvnb|Elton|1962|p=207.}} Some proclamations expressed sympathy for the victims of enclosure and announced action; some condemned the destruction of enclosures and associated riots; another announced pardons for those who had destroyed enclosures by mistake ("of folly and of mistaking") after misunderstanfing the meaning of proclamations, so long as they were sorry.</ref> and partly in the uncoordinated activities of the commissions he sent out in 1548 and 1549 to investigate grievances about loss of tillage, encroachment of large sheep flocks on [[common land]], and similar issues.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=61–66.}}</ref> Local groups often assumed that the findings of these commissions entitled them to act against offending landlords themselves. King Edward wrote in his ''Chronicle'' that the 1549 risings began "because certain commissions were sent down to pluck down enclosures".<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=85}}</ref> 

Whatever the popular view of Somerset, the disastrous events of 1549 were taken as evidence of a colossal failure of government, and the Council laid the responsibility at the Protector's door.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=350}}</ref> In July 1549, Paget wrote to Somerset: "Every man of the council have misliked your proceedings ... would to God, that, at the first stir you had followed the matter hotly, and caused justice to be ministered in solemn fashion to the terror of others ...".<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=87}}</ref> By that Autumn, plans were afoot to remove Somerset as Protector.

===Fall of Somerset===
[[Image:Edward VI Scrots c1550.jpg|thumb|Edward VI, by [[William Scrots]], c. 1550]]

The sequence of events by which Somerset was removed from power have often been described as a ''[[coup d'état]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=350}}</ref>By 1 October, Somerset had been alerted that his rule faced a serious threat. He issued a proclamation calling for assistance, took possession of the king's person, and withdrew to the fortified [[Windsor Castle]] for safety. Meanwhile, a united council published details of his government mismanagement. They made clear that the Protector's power came from them, not from Henry VIII's will. On 11 October, the council had Somerset arrested and brought the king to [[Richmond Palace|Richmond]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=350}}</ref> Edward summarised the charges against Somerset in his ''Chronicle'': "ambition, vainglory, entering into rash wars in mine youth, negligent looking on Newhaven, enriching himself of my treasure, following his own opinion, and doing all by his own authority, etc."<ref>Quoted in {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=91}}. By "Newhaven" is meant Ambleteuse, near Boulogne.</ref> In February 1500, [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|John Dudley, Earl of Warwick]], emerged as the leader of the council and, in effect, as Somerset's successor. Although Somerset was released from the Tower and restored to the council, he was executed for felony in January 1552 after scheming to overthrow Dudley's regime.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guy|1988|pp=212–15}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=101–102}}</ref> Edward noted his uncle's death in his ''Chronicle'': "the duke of Somerset had his head cut  off upon Tower Hill between eight and nine o'clock in the morning".<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=102}}</ref>

Historians contrast the efficiency of Somerset's takeover of power, in which they detect the organising skills of allies such as Paget, with the subsequent ineptitude of his rule. By autumn 1549, his costly wars had lost momentum, the crown faced financial ruin, and riots and rebellions had broken out around the country. Until recent decades, Somerset's reputation with historians was high, in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back the common people against a rapacious landowning class.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=333''n''}}; {{Harvnb|Alford|2002|p=65}}. [[A. F. Pollard]] took this line in the early 20th century, echoed later by Edward VI's 1960s biographer W. K. Jordan, among others. The revisionary approach was initiated by M. L. Bush and Dale Hoak in the 1970s.</ref> More recently, however, he has often been portrayed as an arrogant ruler, devoid of the political and administrative skills necessary for governing the Tudor state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=334–350}}</ref>

==Northumberland's regime==

[[Image:John Dudley.jpg|thumb|John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, led the Council of Regency after the downfall of Somerset]]

In contrast, Somerset's successor [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|John Dudley, Earl of Warwick]], made [[duke of Northumberland]] in 1550, was once regarded merely as a grasping schemer who cynically elevated and enriched himself at the expense of the crown.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoak|1980|pp=31–32}}</ref> Since the 1970s, the administrative and economic achievements of his regime have been recognised, and he has been credited with restoring the authority of the royal council and returning the government to an even keel after the disasters of Somerset's protectorate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alford|2002|p=25}}; {{Harvnb|Hoak|1980|pp=42, 51}}</ref> Nonetheless, that he shared Somerset's ambition, greed, and corruption is undisputed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=114}}</ref>

The Earl of Warwick's rival for leadership of the new regime was [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton]], whose conservative supporters had allied with Dudley's followers to create a unanimous council which they, and observers such as the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]]'s ambassador, expected to reverse Somerset's policy of religious reform. As Somerset was informed, "the papistes" were "never more lustyer than now".<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=92}}</ref> Southampton's faction intended to appoint the Catholic Princess Mary as regent for King Edward.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=351}}; {{Harvnb|Hoak|1980|p=47}}</ref> Warwick, on the other hand pinned his hopes on the king's strong Protestantism, and, claiming that Edward was old enough to rule in person, moved himself and his people closer to the king, taking control of the Privy Chamber. Paget, taking a barony, joined Warwick when he realised that a conservative policy would not bring the Emperor onto the English side over Boulogne.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=351}}</ref> Southampton prepared a case for executing Somerset, aiming to discredit Warwick with Somerset's statements that he had done everything with Warwick's cooperation. As a counter-move, Warwick convinced parliament to free Somerset, which it did on 14 January 1550. Warwick then had Southampton and his followers purged from the council after winning the support of council members in return for titles, and was made lord president of the council and great master of the king's household.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guy|1988|p=213}}; {{Harvnb|Hoak|1980|pp=38–39}}. Hoak explains that the office of lord president gave its holder the right to create and dismiss councillors, as well as to call and dissolve council meetings.</ref> Although not called a Protector, he was now the head of the government.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=350–352}}</ref>

In accordance with his use of the king's personal authority as the source of his own, Warwick encouraged the king to come to council meetings, which enabled him to cite the king's authority for his decisions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=354}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=100}}. Biographer Jennifer Loach contends that Edward did not attend the Privy Council itself but a special committee.</ref>  Although Edward was precocious and able to understand much government business, his contributions during Warwick's presidency probably amounted to no more than assent to decisions already made. In the view of historian Dale Hoak, "Edward VI's speeches and papers really present the somewhat pathetic figure of an articulate puppet far removed from the realities of government".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoak|1980|p=43}}</ref> His greatest influence was in matters of religion, where the council followed the strongly Protestant policy that Edward favoured.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=354, 371}}</ref>  The new Duke of Northumberland's mode of operation was very different from  Somerset's. Careful to make sure he always commanded a majority of councillors, he encouraged a working council and used it to legitimate his authority. Lacking Somerset's blood relationship with the king, he added members to the council from his own faction in order to control it. He also added members of his own family to the royal household.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=94.}}</ref> After a time, he insisted it was "some derogation to his Majesty's honour and royal authority" for the council to countersign his letters and so gained control of Edward's name.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guy|1988|p=215}}</ref> He saw that to achieve personal dominance, he needed total procedural control of the council.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoak|1980|pp=36–37}}</ref> In the words of historian [[John Guy]], "Like Somerset, he became quasi-king; the difference was that he managed the bureaucracy on the pretence that Edward had assumed full sovereignty, whereas Somerset had asserted the right to near-sovereignty as Protector".<ref>{{Harvnb|Guy|1988|p=215}}</ref>

Warwick's war policies were more pragmatic than Somerset's, and they have earned him criticism for weakness. In 1550, he signed a peace treaty with France that agreed to withdrawal from Boulogne, recalled all English garrisons from Scotland, and cancelled Edward's betrothal to Mary, Queen of Scots, in favour of one with [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]'s daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Guy|1988|pp=218–19}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=108}}. Edward sent Elisabeth a "fair diamond" from Catherine Parr's collection.</ref> In practice, he realised that England could no longer support the cost of wars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=113}}</ref> At home, he took measures to police local unrest. In order to forestall future rebellions, he kept permanent representatives of the crown in the localities, including [[lord lieutenant|lords lieutenant]], who commanded military forces and reported back to central government.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=355}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=105}}</ref> 

Warwick also tackled the disastrous state of the kingdom's finances, drawing on the talents of [[Thomas Smith (diplomat)|Thomas Smith]], [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], and [[William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester| William Paulet]], and on the financial advice of men such as [[Walter Mildmay]] and [[Thomas Gresham]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=355}}</ref> However, his regime did not see sense until after it had succumbed to the temptations of a quick profit by further [[debasement|debasing]] the coinage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=110}}; {{Harvnb|Hoak|1980|p=41}}</ref> The disaster that resulted handed the initiative to the experts, and the [[debasement]] was reversed. By 1552, confidence in the coinage was restored, prices fell, and trade improved. Though a full economic recovery was not achieved until Elizabeth's reign, its origins lay in the Duke of Northumberland's policies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=356}}</ref> The regime also cracked down on the widespread embezzlement of government finances and carried out a thorough review of revenue collection practices which has been called "one of the more remarkable achievements of Tudor administration".<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=357–58}}</ref>
 
===Reform===

On the day after the Duke of Somerset's execution, a new session of Parliament began. It passed the [[Act of Uniformity 1552]], under which a second ''Book of Common Prayer'' was required for church services. Unauthorised worship was punishable by up to life imprisonment.

The rise of the Earl of Warwick (later Duke of Northumberland) was accompanied by the fall of Catholicism in England. Use of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' in all Church services was more strictly enforced and all official editions of the [[Bible]] were accompanied by anti-Catholic annotations. The [[Ordinal of 1550]] replaced the divine ordination of priests with a government-run appointment system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mackie|1952|p=517}}</ref> Religious [[dissenter]]s, moreover, were often persecuted and [[execution by burning|burnt at the stake]]. In 1550 and 1551, the most powerful Roman Catholic Bishops, [[Edmund Bonner]] (the [[Bishop of London]]), [[Stephen Gardiner]] (the [[Bishop of Winchester]]) and [[Nicholas Heath]] (the [[Bishop of Worcester]]) included, were deposed and their places taken by Protestant reformers such as [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]].

[[Image:Thomas-Cranmer-ez.jpg|thumb|Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, was a very important influence on Edward's Protestant views]] 
Another powerful influence on Edward VI was [[Thomas Cranmer]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Both Cranmer and the Duke of Somerset were committed to creating a [[English Reformation|Protestant England]]. Various Catholic rites were replaced with Protestant ones. One of the most notable was Cranmer's ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', which was published solely in English in 1549 to replace the four old liturgical books in Latin. The political aim of the work was to unite moderate religious factions into a single Protestant fold by downplaying the role of the Mass and the status of saints. Its use was enforced by an [[Act of Uniformity 1549]] but it served only to antagonise both Protestants and Catholics.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=498}}</ref> Zealous reformers such as [[John Knox]] were appointed as court chaplains. The Duke of Somerset, however, did not encourage persecution; rather, he refrained from it, as he feared the wrath of Europe's powerful Catholic monarchs, especially [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].

===Device to alter the succession===

During his father's reign Edward had effectively been pampered and kept in seclusion. Edward desperately wanted his own freedom, and indulged in the early years of his reign with other children of his age. He became extremely fond of sports such as tennis. During the winter of 1552&ndash;53, Edward VI  became ill, and by May it was obvious that his condition, which included chronic coughing and swollen legs and head, was serious.<ref name =Ldeath>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=159–61}}</ref>  Edward was enough the master of his own destiny to have concerns about the succession addressed. Having been brought up a Protestant, he had no desire to be succeeded by his older half-sister and devout Catholic, [[Mary I of England|Mary]].

At the same time, the Duke of Northumberland was eager to retain his own power and contrived to alter the succession. He did not find the next two individuals in the line of succession, Mary and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], conducive to his aims. The third individual in the line of succession under Henry VIII's will was [[Lady Frances Brandon]] (the daughter of Henry's younger sister [[Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)|Mary]] by [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk]]); she, too, was not to Northumberland's liking. Northumberland feared that Frances' husband, [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], would claim the Crown as his own. The Duke of Northumberland then attempted to rule through the Duchess of Suffolk's daughter, the [[Lady Jane Grey]]. Jane was married off to the Duke of Northumberland's younger son, [[Guilford Dudley]]. The marriage between Lady Jane Grey and Guilford Dudley had been arranged for several months previous to Edward's sickness, and the Act to make Jane Grey heir to the throne and disclaim Mary and Elizabeth was written in Edward's own hand, showing that Edward at least consented to it. However, at the time that Guilford Dudley married Lady Jane Grey, it was not certain that she would be the mother of the next king, and she had not been named as heir to the throne. There is also debate over whether or not Edward was even thought to be dying at the time that the marriage was arranged.

[[Image:Streathamladyjayne.jpg|thumb|The Devices altered the succession to put  Lady Jane Grey next in line to succeed Edward]]
On [[11 June]] [[1553]], the first draft of the will was written in Edward's own hand and the councillors of the privy council were forced to sign.

The first draft of the will excluded Mary, Elizabeth, the Duchess of Suffolk and the Lady Jane Grey from the line of succession. The Crown was to be left to the Lady Jane's heirs-male, as it was not apparent that Edward would die so soon. Once it was discovered that Edward was indeed dying, the Device had to be altered. Because Lady Jane had no male heirs at this time, having been married only a month or so before, the draft was changed to leave the Crown to Jane ''and'' her heirs-male. Mary and Elizabeth were excluded because they were officially illegitimate; the Duchess of Suffolk agreed to renounce her own claims. As Edward VI lay dying, the Duke of Northumberland (according to legend) symbolically stole the crown from him and gave it to his daughter-in-law, the Lady Jane.

In recent decades, revisionist historians such as Dale Hoak have speculated that Northumberland alone did not engineer the plot to subvert the succession and put Lady Jane Grey on the throne.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoak|1980|pp=29–51}}</ref> suggests that "some others" shared Northumberland's responsibility for the scheme. In his confession, Northumberland suggested that there were others involved but he would not name them.

==Edward's death== 

Edward died at the age of 15 at [[Greenwich Palace]] on [[6 July]] [[1553]], after contracting a feverish cold in February that gradually worsened. The cause of his death is unclear; rumours of poisoning abounded at the time, and the Venetian ambassador reported that he had died of [[tuberculosis|consumption]], a diagnosis that has been accepted by many historians. Biographer Jennifer Loach suggests that his symptoms were typical of acute [[bronchopneumonia]], leading to a "suppurating pulmonary infection", [[sepsis|septicaemia]], and [[renal failure|kidney failure]].<ref name =Ldeath>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=159–61}}</ref>  His last words were said to have been: "Oh my Lord God, defend this realm from [[papistry]] and maintain Thy true religion."  

He was buried in [[Henry VII Lady Chapel]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] by [[Thomas Cranmer]] with Protestant rites on [[9 August]] [[1553]], while Mary had Mass said for his soul in the Tower. 

[[Image:Mary I in 1544.jpg|thumb|Edward's half sister, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], daughter of Catherine of Aragon.]]

===Succession crisis===

Edward's death was kept secret for several days so that preparations could be made for Jane's accession. High civic authorities privately swore their allegiance to the new [[queen regnant|Queen]], who was not publicly proclaimed until [[10 July]] [[1553]]. However, the people were much more supportive of Mary, the rightful heir under the [[Third Succession Act|Act of Succession]]. Mary, Edward's [[Catholic]] half sister, rode triumphantly into [[London]] on [[July 19]] and Jane was forced to give up the Crown. Jane's proclamation was revoked as an act done under coercion; her succession was deemed unlawful. 

The Duke of Northumberland was executed, but the Lady Jane and her father were originally spared. In 1554, when Mary faced [[Wyatt's Rebellion]], the Duke of Suffolk once again attempted to put his daughter on the throne. For this crime, Jane, her husband and the Duke of Suffolk were all executed.
