'''Mobile''' ({{IPA2|moʊˈbiːl}}) [http://www.bartleby.com/61/wavs/93/M0359300.wav (pronunciation)]  is the third most populous city in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Alabama]]<ref name="citypop">{{cite web|title=''USA: Alabama''|work=CityPopulation.de|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/USA-Alabama.html|accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref>  and is the [[county seat]] of [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile County]]. The population of the city was 192,830 according to the 2006 estimate.<ref name=popest/>  It is the principal city of the Mobile [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Area]] (MSA), which has a July 1, 2006 census estimated population of 404,157.  Mobile is a part of the Mobile-[[Daphne, Alabama|Daphne]]-[[Fairhope, Alabama|Fairhope]] [[Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA) which has a population 588,246 as of the 2006 census estimates.

The city's name is derived from the presence of the Mobile ([[Chief Tuskaloosa|Mauvila]] or [[Chief Tuskaloosa|Maubila]]) [[Native Americans in the US|Indians]] in the area at the time of founding. <ref name="mgs">{{cite web|title=''Local History Information and Links''|work=Mobile Genealogical Society|url=http://www.siteone.com/clubs/mgs/history.htm|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref> Mobile is the only saltwater port in [[Alabama]]. Located along the northwest shore of [[Mobile Bay]], the city began as the first capital of colonial [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] in [[1702]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Mobile, Alabama}}

===18th century===
The settlement of Mobile, then known as ''Fort Louis de la Mobile'', was first established in [[1702]], at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff on the [[Mobile River]], as the first capital of the [[French colonial empires|French colony]] of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. This period also saw the arrival of the first [[African]] [[slaves]] aboard a French supply ship from [[Saint-Domingue]]<ref>Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 21. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN: 0817310657</ref>.  Following [[yellow fever]] outbreaks and a series of floods, the town was relocated downriver to its present location at the confluence of the [[Mobile River]] and [[Mobile Bay]] in [[1711]].  A new earth and palisade ''Fort Louis'' was constructed at the new site at that time.<ref>Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 17-27. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN: 0817310657</ref>

</ref>
The capital of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] was moved to [[Biloxi]] in [[1720]],<ref name=MoMfort/> leaving Mobile relegated to the role of trading post.  In [[1723]] the construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began<ref name=MoMfort/>, and was renamed as [[Fort Conde|Fort Condé]] in honor of the [[Princes of Condé]], members of the [[House of Bourbon]].  In a similar fashion Dauphin Street and nearby [[Dauphin Island]] were named in honor of the [[Dauphin of France]], the eldest son of the king, and Conti Street was named in honor of the [[Princes of Conti]], also members of the [[House of Bourbon]].

[[Image:West Florida Map 1767.jpg|thumb|left|The expanded West Florida territory in 1767.]]
In 1763, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed, ending the [[French and Indian War]]/[[Seven Years' War]]. The treaty [[ceded]] Mobile and the surrounding territory to [[Great Britain]], who made it into the expanded [[West Florida]] colony.  Under British rule the colony flourished. The British renamed the city [[Fort Charlotte (Mobile)|Fort Charlotte]], after the English queen, and re-energized the port. Major exports included timber, naval stores, indigo, hides, rice, pecans and cattle.

[[Image:Southern Hotel Water Street.jpg|thumb|Southern Hotel (1837) on Water Street.]]
[[Image:Old Markethouse.jpg|thumb|City Hall (1856) on Royal Street.]]

[[Battle of Fort Charlotte|The Spanish captured]] the port town in [[1780]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]] at the invitation of the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen "United Colonies"]] due to the fact that [[West Florida]] remained loyal to the [[British Crown]].<ref>Delaney, Caldwell. ''The Story of Mobile'', page 45. Mobile, Alabama: Gill Press, 1953. ISBN: 0940882140</ref>  The fort was renamed as [[Fort Conde|Fortaleza Carlota]], and the Spanish held Mobile as a part of Spanish [[West Florida]] until [[1813]], when the weakly defended port city was seized by the U.S. General [[James Wilkinson]] during the [[War of 1812]].

===19th century===
From the [[1830s]] onward Mobile expanded into a city of commerce. The [[King Cotton|cotton trade]] and the activity of the port brought Mobile recognition throughout the world.  Despite the fact that the importation of slaves was outlawed in [[1808]], the last known slaveship to arrive in the United States with a cargo of slaves, the ''Clotilda'', was abandoned by its captain near Mobile in [[1860]].  It was owned by a northern U.S. businessman, Timothy Meaher, who was attempting to supply the inland [[plantations]].  Between [[1830]] and [[1860]], 10% of the free population of Mobile owned slaves.  Also 3% of the free population consisted of ''free people of color'', mostly [[Creoles]].<ref>Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 79-80. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN: 0817310657</ref>  During the [[American Civil War]], Mobile was a [[Confederate_States_of_America|Confederate]] city.  The first [[submarine]] to successfully sink an enemy ship, the [[Hunley|H. L. Hunley]], was built in Mobile.   One of the most famous [[naval engagement]]s of the [[American Civil War|war]] was the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]] in [[1864]], resulting in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] taking possession of [[Mobile Bay]] on [[5 August]] [[1864]].  On [[12 April]] [[1865]], the city surrendered to the [[Union army]] to avoid destruction.<ref>Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 113. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN: 0817310657</ref>  Ironically, on [[25 May]] [[1865]], the city suffered loss when some three hundred people died as a result of an explosion at a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[ammunition depot]] on Beauregard Street.  The explosion left a 30 foot deep hole at the depot's location, sunk ships docked on the [[Mobile River]], and the resulting fires destroyed the northern portion of the city.<ref>Delaney, Caldwell. ''The Story of Mobile'', pages 144,146. Mobile, Alabama: Gill Press, 1953. ISBN: 0940882140 </ref>  The cotton trade remained an important part of Mobile's economy after the war, but its importance would continue to diminish into the [[20th century]] as the economy became more diversified.

===20th century===
[[Image:LOC2.jpg|thumb|left|The Mobile waterfront in 1906.]]
The city slowly revived and became a shipbuilding port churning out vessels for the military in the [[20th century]]. [[World War II]] led to a massive military effort causing a considerable increase in Mobile's population, largely due to the huge influx of workers coming into Mobile to work in the shipyards and at [[Brookley Field]].  Between [[1940]] and [[1943]] 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries.  Mobile was one of eighteen U.S. cities producing [[Liberty ships]] at its [[Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company]] to support the war effort and [[Britain]], by producing ships faster than the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] could sink them.  [[Chickasaw Shipyard Village Historic District|Gulf Shipbuilding]] focused on building [[freighter]]s, [[Fletcher class destroyer]]s, and [[minesweeper]]s.<ref>Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 213-217. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN: 0817310657</ref>
The [[1950s]] and [[1960s]] brought about post war changes in Mobile's economy. Mobile's downtown was the recipient of [[urban renewal]] and saw the [[demolition]] of some of the city's oldest buildings.  Instead of shipbuilding, the paper and chemical industries began to take over as the primary economic force and most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. The [[1970s]] saw a large part of downtown boarded up and unused.  The [[1990s]] saw a revival of business in the downtown area that continues today.

===Historic districts===
[[Image:Oakleigh Period House Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Oakleigh]] House (1833) in the  Oakleigh Garden Historic District.]]
A fire in October of [[1827]] destroyed most of the old city from the [[Mobile River]] to Saint Emanuel Street and from Saint Francis to Government Street.<ref>Thomason, Michael.. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 67. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN: 0817310657</ref>  The city experienced another fire in [[1839]] that burned part of city between Conti and Government Street from Royal to Saint Emanuel Street and also both sides of Dauphin to Franklin Street. Nothing from the Mobile's [[colonial]] past survives.  The earliest surviving structures today date to the 1830's, of which there are still many examples. The colonial era buildings were primarily wooden construction, their replacements were primarily brick and stone.<ref>Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 67. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN: 0817310657</ref>  Mobile has good [[antebellum]] examples of [[Greek Revival]], [[Gothic Revival]], [[Italianate]], and [[Buildings_and_architecture_of_New_Orleans#Creole_Cottage|Creole Cottage]]. Common later  styles include the various [[Victorian Architecture|Victorian]] types, [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]], [[Colonial Revival]], [[Tudor Revival]], [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]], and many others.  Mobile currently has nine historic districts:<ref name="altair1"|>{{cite web|title="Historic Districts Maps from the Mobile Historical Development Commission"|work="Alabama Historical Commission"|url=http://www.mobilehd.org/historic_maps.php|accessdate=2007-09-21}}</ref>

Mobile's&nbsp;geographical location on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] provides a mild [[subtropical]] [[climate]], with an average annual temperature of 67.5°F. January through December temperatures range from 40°F min. and 91°F max.
