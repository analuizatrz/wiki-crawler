'''Jacobus Franciscus "Jim" Thorpe''' ([[Sac and Fox Nation]]: '''Wa-Tho-Huk''') ([[May 28]] [[1887]] &ndash; [[March 28]] [[1953]]) is considered one of the most versatile athletes in modern [[sports]]. He won [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals in the [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]], starred in college and professional [[American football|football]], played [[Major League Baseball]] and also had a career in [[basketball]]. He subsequently lost his Olympic titles when it was found he had played two seasons of minor league baseball prior to competing in the games (thus violating the [[amateurism|amateur status]] rules). In 1983, thirty years after his death, his medals were restored. 

==Early life==
Information about Thorpe's birth, full name, and ethnic background vary widely. What is known is that he was born in [[Indian Territory]], but no [[birth certificate]] has been found. He is believed to have been born on [[May 28]] [[1887]] near the town of [[Prague, Oklahoma]]. '''Jacobus Francis Thorpe''' is the name on his christening ([[baptism]]al) certificate. 

His parents were of mixed descent. His father, Hiram Thorpe, had an [[Ireland|Irish]] father and a [[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox]] Indian mother, while his mother, Charlotte Vieux, had a [[France|French]] father and a Native American mother, a descendant of the great Sac Warrior, [[Black Hawk (chief)|Chief Black Hawk]]. Thorpe was raised as a Sac and Fox, and his native name was '''Wa-Tho-Huk''', meaning ''Bright Path''. As was the custom for Sac and Fox, Thorpe was named for something occurring around the time of his birth, in this case the sunlight brightening the path to the cabin where he was born. Some accounts suggest that Hiram Thorpe had five different wives and produced a total of 19 children, of which no fewer than eleven were with Vieux.

Together with his twin brother, Charlie, Thorpe went to school in [[Stroud, Oklahoma]] at the Sac and Fox Indian Agency School. Charlie died of [[pneumonia]] when they were eight years old. Charlie helped Jim through school. Thorpe did not handle his brother's death very well, and ran away from school on several occasions. Hiram Thorpe then sent Jim to what is now known as [[Haskell Indian Nations University]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], so that his son would not run away again. When his mother died two years later, Thorpe fell into a [[clinical depression|depression]]. After several arguments with his father, he ran away from home to work on a horse ranch.

In 1904, Thorpe returned to his father, and decided to join [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]] where he was coached by [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Glenn Scobey "Pop" Warner]], one of the most influential coaches in early American football history. Later that year, Hiram Thorpe died. Thorpe once again dropped out of school. He resumed farm work for a few years and then returned to Carlisle, where his athletic career commenced.

==A rising star==
[[Image:Jim Thorpe.jpg|thumb|left|Jim Thorpe in [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] uniform, about 1909]]
Legend has it that Thorpe began his athletic career at Carlisle in 1907 when he walked past the track and beat the school's [[high jump]]ers with an impromptu 5 ft 9 in jump, still wearing plain clothes. Whether this is true or not, Thorpe's earliest recorded [[track and field]] results are indeed from 1907. But track and field were certainly not the only events in which Thorpe engaged at Carlisle&mdash;he also participated in football, baseball, [[Lacrosse (sport)|lacrosse]] and even [[ballroom dancing]].

He gained nationwide attention for the first time in 1911. As a [[running back]], defensive back, place-kicker, and punter for his school's football team; Thorpe scored all of his team's points—four field goals and a touchdown—in an 18-13 upset of [[Harvard]]. His team finished the season 11-1. The following year, he led Carlisle to the national collegiate championship, scoring 25 [[touchdown]]s and 198 points (over 12 games). Carlisle's 1912 record includes an impressive 27-6 victory over [[United States Military Academy|Army]]. In that game, Thorpe scored a 92-yard touchdown that was annulled because of a penalty incurred by a teammate. Thorpe then scored a 97-yard touchdown on the next play. Thorpe won [[All-America]]n honors in both 1911 and 1912.

During that game, future President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] injured his knee while trying to tackle Thorpe. Eisenhower recalled of Thorpe in a 1961 speech, "Here and there, there are some people who are supremely endowed. My memory goes back to Jim Thorpe. He never practiced in his life, and he could do anything better than any other football player I ever saw."[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/07/09/jim.thorpe/][http://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/sports.htm]

Football was—and would remain—Thorpe's favorite sport, and he competed only sporadically in track and field. Nevertheless, track and field would become the sport in which Thorpe would gain the most fame.

==An Olympic hero==
For the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], two new multi-event disciplines were on the program, the [[pentathlon]] and the [[decathlon]]. A pentathlon based on the ancient Greek event had been organized at the [[1906 Summer Olympics]], but the 1912 edition would consist of the [[long jump]], the [[javelin throw]], 200-meter dash, the [[discus throw]] and the 1500-meter run. 

The decathlon was an entirely new event in athletics, although it had been competed in American track meets since the 1880s and a version had been featured on the program of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 St. Louis Olympics]]. However, the events of the new decathlon were slightly different from the U.S. version. Both events seemed a fit for Thorpe, who was so versatile that he alone had formed Carlisle's team on several track meets. Therefore, Thorpe entered the [[U.S. Olympic trials]] for both the pentathlon and the decathlon.

He easily won the awards, winning three events, and was named to the pentathlon team, which also included future [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] president [[Avery Brundage]]. There were only a few candidates for the decathlon team, and the trials were cancelled. Thorpe would contest his first—and, as it turned out, only—decathlon in the Olympics.

Thorpe's competition schedule for the Olympics was crowded. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he also entered the long jump and high jump competitions. The first event scheduled was the pentathlon. Thorpe was the class of the field, winning four events. He placed only third in the javelin, an event he had not contested before 1912. Although the competition was primarily decided on place points, points were also calculated for the marks achieved in the events. Thorpe scored 4041.530 points, 400 points more than runner-up [[Ferdinand Bie]] of [[Norway]]. 

The same day he won the pentathlon gold, Thorpe qualified for the high-jump final. In that final, he placed fourth, and took seventh place in the long jump. Thorpe's final event was the decathlon, where tough competition from local favorite [[Hugo Wieslander]] was expected. But Wieslander was no match for Thorpe either, finishing some 700 points behind. Thorpe placed in the top four of all ten events. 

As was the custom of the day, the medals were presented to the athletes during the closing ceremonies of the Games. Along with the two gold medals, Thorpe also received two challenge prizes, which were donated by King [[Gustav V of Sweden]] for the decathlon and Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] for the pentathlon. Legend has it that, when awarding Thorpe his prize, King Gustav said, "You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world," to which Thorpe replied, "Thanks, King."

Thorpe's successes had not gone unnoticed at home, and he was honored with a [[ticker-tape parade]] on [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]]. He later remembered: "I heard people yelling my name, and I couldn't realize how one fellow could have so many friends."

Apart from his track and field appearance, Thorpe also played in one of two exhibition baseball matches held at the 1912 Olympics, which featured two teams made up of U.S. track and field athletes. It was not Thorpe's first try at baseball, as would soon become known to the rest of the world.

==Declared a professional==
In 1913, strict rules regarding amateurism were in force for athletes participating in the Olympics. Athletes who received money prizes for competitions, were sports teachers or who had previously competed against professionals were not considered amateurs, and were not allowed to compete in the Olympics.

In late January 1913, U.S. newspapers published stories announcing that Thorpe had played professional baseball. It is not entirely certain which newspaper first brought the story; the earliest article found is from the ''[[Providence Times]]'', but the ''[[Worcester Telegram]]'' is usually mentioned as the first. Thorpe had indeed played professional baseball in the [[Eastern Carolina League]] for [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina]] in 1909 and 1910, and had received a small amount of money for playing. 

Although the public did not seem to care much about Thorpe's past, the [[Amateur Athletic Union]], and especially its secretary [[James E. Sullivan]], took the case very seriously. Thorpe wrote a letter to Sullivan, in which he admitted playing professional baseball:

<blockquote>...I hope I will be partly excused by the fact that I was simply an Indian schoolboy and did not know all about such things. In fact, I did not know that I was doing wrong, because I was doing what I knew several other college men had done, except that they did not use their own names...</blockquote>

His letter did not help, and the AAU decided to retroactively withdraw Thorpe's amateur status, and requested the IOC to do the same. Later that year, the IOC unanimously decided to strip Jim Thorpe of his Olympic titles, medals and awards, and declared him a professional. 

While Thorpe had indeed played for money, his disqualification was in fact not according to the regulations. In the rulebook for the 1912 Olympics, it was stated that any protests had to be made within 30 days from the closing ceremonies of the Games. The first newspaper reports only appeared in January 1913, about six months after the Stockholm Games had concluded. However, AAU and IOC officials were apparently ignorant of this rule, or chose to ignore it. There is also some evidence that Thorpe's amateur status had already been questioned long before the Olympics, but that this had been (deliberately) ignored by the AAU until they were confronted with it in 1913.

The only positive side to this affair for Thorpe was that, as soon as the news got out that he had been declared a professional, offers came in from Major League Baseball teams to join them.

Declared a rare free agent in the era of the reserve clause Jim Thorpe had his pick of teams to play for. He turned down a starting position with the St. Louis Browns to be a bench warmer with the New York Giants. One of the immediate benefits of joining the Giants came that October when the New York  Giants joined the Chicago White Sox for a world tour. Barnstorming across the united States  and then around the world, Thorpe was the unquestioned star of the world tour. Everywhere the teams went Thorpe brought them publicity and increased the tour's box office everywhere. Among the highlights  were a meeting with the Pope, the last khedive of Egypt, and playing before 20,000 in London with King George V in attendance. While in Rome Thorpe was filmed wrestling with another baseball player on the floor of the Coliseum. Unfotunately every square inch of the film has been lost to time. One of the ironies of Thorpe's life is that no footage exists of him in his athletic prime.{{citation requested}}   
 
Perhaps most impressive of all Thorpe's accomplishments was the time of his 100 meter run, which was ruled at 10 seconds flat.  This time has never been verified.  In fact, Red Smith reported in 1953 that Thorpe finished third in the 100 meters during the decathlon.  If he did indeed run a 10.0 it would have been retroactively placed as a world record when Thorpe was reinstated and his accomplishments were put back in the record book.

==Baseball, football, and basketball==
[[Image:Jim_Thorpe_football.png|thumbnail|Thorpe played football for Canton from 1915 through 1920. He also played 52 NFL games.]]

He signed with the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] in 1913 and played sporadically there as an outfielder for three seasons. After missing the 1916 season completely, he came back to play again for the Giants in 1917, but was sold to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] early in the season. Late in the season, he was sold back to the Giants. Again, he played sporadically for the Giants in 1918 and was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] on [[May 21]], [[1919]] for [[Pat Ragan]]. In his lackluster career, he amassed 91 [[runs scored]], 82 [[runs batted in]] and a .252 [[batting average]] over 289 games. He continued to play baseball with teams in [[minor league baseball|minor league]]s until 1922.

But Thorpe had not abandoned football either. Back in 1915, Thorpe had signed with the [[Canton Bulldogs]]. They paid him $250 a game, a tremendous wage at the time. The independent team was successful, and won titles in 1916, 1917 and 1919. In 1920, the Bulldogs were one of the fourteen teams to form the [[American Professional Football Association]], which would become the [[National Football League]] two years later. Thorpe was named the APFA's first president, but continued to play for Canton, coaching the team as well. Between 1921 and 1923, Thorpe played for the [[La Rue, Ohio]] ([[Marion County, Ohio]]) [[Oorang Indians]], an all Native American team. Although the team went 3 and 6 in their first year, and 1 and 10 in their second year, Thorpe played well. In 1923 Thorpe kicked what would be a record 99 yard punt. However, at this point in the history of the [[NFL]] such records weren't kept. That is why [[Steve O'Neal]] owns the record with his 98 yard punt.

Thorpe never played on a championship team, although he played for six different teams between 1920 and 1928. He retired from pro football aged 41, having played 52 NFL games.

Thorpe continued to be active in sports. Recently, evidence has come to light that he began a career in [[basketball]]. "Jim Thorpe and His World-Famous Indians" barnstormed for two years (1927-1928) in parts of New York, Pennsylvania, and [[Marion, Ohio]]. This period of his life is not well-documented, and until 2005 even Thorpe's biographers were unaware of Thorpe's basketball career.[http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/310_thorpe.html]

==Later life and death==
In 1913, Thorpe married Iva Miller, whom he had met at Carlisle. They had four children: Jim Jr. (who died at age 2), Gale, Charlotte and Grace. Thorpe was a [[alcoholism|heavy drinker]] at times, which was probably the main reason the couple divorced in 1924. 

Thorpe remarried in 1926 to Freeda Kirkpatrick, and had four sons with her: Carl, William, Richard, and John. After the end of his athletic career, Thorpe struggled to support his family. He found it difficult to work outside sports, and never could hang on to a job for a very long time. The [[Great Depression]] didn't make things easier, and Thorpe went from job to job. Among other jobs, he featured as an [[extra (drama)|extra]] in several movies, usually playing an Indian chief in [[Western movie]]s. But he also worked as a construction worker, a [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] and briefly joined the [[Merchant Marine]] in 1945. Four years earlier, his second wife had divorced him, as she was fed up with Thorpe regularly being away from home for weeks.

By the 1950s, Thorpe had no money left, and when he was hospitalized for lip [[cancer]] in 1950, he was admitted as a charity case. 

Three years later, Thorpe suffered his third [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while eating dinner with his third wife, Patricia Askew, in his trailer home in [[Lomita, California]]. [[Artificial respiration]] briefly revived Thorpe, but he lost consciousness shortly afterwards, and died on [[March 28]] [[1953]], at age 65.

==Legacy==
<!--[[Image:Jim_thorpe_all-american_video_cover.jpg|thumb|Jim Thorpe: All-American, starring Burt Lancaster]]-->

When Thorpe's third wife, Patricia, heard that the small Pennsylvania town of [[Mauch Chunk]] was desperately seeking to attract business, she struck a deal with the town. Mauch Chunk bought Thorpe's remains, erected a monument to him, and renamed the town in his honor (see [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania]]). Thorpe's monument, featuring the quote from Gustav V, can still be found there.

Thorpe also received great acclaim from the press. In 1950, an [[Associated Press]] poll among sportswriters voted Thorpe the greatest athlete of the first half of the 20th century, while another poll elected him as the best football player over the same period. By the end of the century, memories of Thorpe had faded a little, but he still was listed near the top of many "athlete of the century" lists.

In 1951, while Thorpe was still alive, a feature film about his life was released. ''Jim Thorpe: All-American'' starred [[Burt Lancaster]] and was directed by [[Michael Curtiz]] (the director of [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]). Thorpe did not earn any money for the movie, as he had already sold the film rights to [[MGM]] in 1931 (for $1500). The movie was titled ''Man of Bronze'' when released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

In 1963, Jim Thorpe received the [[NFL]]'s highest honor, induction into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].  He is often said to be the first player inducted, although the first person inducted was [[Chicago Bears]] founder, owner, coach and player [[George Halas]].  In addition, Thorpe is also memorialized in the Pro Football Hall of Fame rotunda with the larger-than-life Jim Thorpe Statue.

In 1986, the [[Jim Thorpe Award]] was established, awarded to the best [[defensive back]] in [[college football]].

In [[1999]], despite 81 years having passed since his last game and 46 years since his death, he was ranked number 88 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.  He was the only player on the list who had played professional football prior to the founding of the NFL.

==Reinstated==
[[Image:Jim_Thorpe_stamp.png|thumbnail|right|The [[United States Postal Service|USPS]] recognized Thorpe's achievements with a postage stamp.]]

Over the years, several attempts have been made to reinstate Thorpe's Olympic titles, most started by one of Thorpe's seven surviving children. Most persistent were Robert Wheeler and Florence Ridlon. They succeeded in having the AAU and [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) overturn their decisions and restore Thorpe's amateur status prior to 1913. 

In 1982, they set up the [[Jim Thorpe Foundation]], and managed to get support from the [[Congress of the United States|US Congress]]. Armed with this support, and evidence from 1912 showing Thorpe's disqualification had occurred outside of the 30-day limit, they finally got attention from the IOC, which had not made any attempts to reinstate Thorpe.

In October 1982, the IOC Executive Committee approved Thorpe's reinstatement. In an unusual ruling, however, they declared that Thorpe was now co-champion with Bie and Wieslander, even though both athletes had always said they considered Thorpe to be the only champion. In a ceremony on [[January 18]], [[1983]], two of Thorpe's children, Gale and Bill, were presented with commemorative medals. (The original medals had both ended up in museums, but were stolen and are still missing.)
