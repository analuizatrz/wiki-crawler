'''Delhi''' ({{lang-hi|दिल्ली}}; {{lang-pa|ਦਿੱਲੀ}}; {{lang-gu| દિલ્લી}}; {{IPA2|d̪ɪlːiː}}; sometimes referred to as ''Dilli'') is the [[List of most populous cities in India|second largest]] metropolis of [[India]], and the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|fifth largest city in the world by population]], with a population greater than 18 million,<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Projected_Population/Projected_population.aspx#2008 Census of India - Projected Population<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and  a federally-administered [[States and territories of India|union territory]] officially known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT). 

Located on the banks of river [[Yamuna]] in [[northern India]], archaeological evidence suggest that Delhi has been [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|continuously inhabited]] since at least 6th century BC.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=gSupaU3vVacC&pg=PA249&lpg=PA249&dq=delhi+continuously+inhabited&source=web&ots=Cq2KBU2l5_&sig=7u8ayI-C9NSfqv-_PAjQEX5SNIo&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA250,M1</ref> After the rise of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], Delhi emerged as a major political, cultural and commercial city along the [[trade route]]s between northwest India and the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]s.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=UJc2u33fCKQC&pg=PA16&dq=delhi+sultanate+political+center+city+delhi&lr=&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U3zNMesuCjnsH7iAlLe5mKHpddn8w#PPA17,M1</ref><ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=lu5jGGQ8fJkC&pg=PA21&dq=delhi+continuously+inhabited&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U1Z52ojRmD1-ZS2QeQlb8UlGZeBhA</ref> It is the site of many ancient and medieval monuments, archaeological sites and remains. In 1639, Mughal emperor [[Shahjahan]] built a new [[Shahjahanabad|walled city]] in Delhi which served as the capital of the [[Mughal Empire]] from 1649 to 1857.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=oa1PAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA621&dq=delhi+capital+1911&client=firefox-a#PPA621,M1</ref><ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=ONFPAAAAMAAJ&q=shahjanabad+built&dq=shahjanabad+built&client=firefox-a&pgis=1</ref>

After the [[British East India Company]] gained control of much of India during the 18th and 19th centuries, Calcutta became the capital both under [[Company rule in India|Company rule]] and under the [[British Raj]], until [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] announced in 1911 that it was to move back to Delhi. A new capital city, [[New Delhi]], was built during the 1920s.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=3Fm3XlYuSzAC&pg=RA1-PA88&dq=delhi+capital+india+calcutta+george&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U29Ev4lebQwD-U-w7jrrAKN0L5p8g</ref> When India gained [[History of the Republic of India|independence from British rule]] in 1947, New Delhi was declared its capital and [[seat of government]]. As such, New Delhi houses important offices of the federal government, including the [[Parliament of India]].

Owing to the immigration of people from across the country, Delhi has grown to be a [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] city. Its rapid development and [[Urbanization|urbanisation]], coupled with the relatively high average income of its population, has transformed the city.<ref name="dayal">{{cite journal |last=Dayal |first=Ravi |year=2002 |month=July |title=A Kayastha’s View |journal=Seminar (web edition) |issue=515 |url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2002/515/515%20ravi%20dayal.htm |accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref> Today, Delhi is a major cultural, political, and commercial center of India.

==Etymology==

The etymology of "Delhi" is uncertain. The most common view is that it is an [[eponym]] of ''Dhillu'' or ''Dilu'', a [[king]] of the [[Mauryan dynasty]]<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=roNH68bxCX4C&pg=PA2&dq=raja+dilu+delhi+BC&lr=&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U01e-S_590M3cIxfi7Y1OFIk-cK9g</ref> who built the city in 50 BC and named it after himself.<ref name=ecosurv1>{{cite web

MCD is one of the largest municipal corporations in the world providing civic amenities to an estimated 13.78&nbsp;million people.<ref name="MCD"> {{cite web |url=http://www.mcdonline.gov.in/|title=About Us|publisher=Municipal Corporation of Delhi|accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref> The capital of India, New Delhi, falls under the administration of NDMC. The chairperson of the NDMC is appointed by the Government of India in consultation with the [[Chief Minister of Delhi]].

Delhi has four major satellite cities which lie outside the National Capital Territory of Delhi. These are [[Gurgaon]] and [[Faridabad]] (in Haryana), and [[New Okhla Industrial Development Authority|NOIDA]] and [[Ghaziabad]] (in Uttar Pradesh). Delhi is divided into nine districts. Each district (division) is headed by a Deputy Commissioner and has three subdivisions. A Subdivision Magistrate heads each subdivision. All Deputy Commissioners report to the Divisional Commissioner. The District Administration of Delhi is the enforcing department for all kinds of State and Central Government policies and exercises supervisory powers over numerous other functionaries of the Government.

The [[Delhi High Court]] has jurisdiction over Delhi. Delhi also has [[lower court]]s; the [[Small Causes Court]] for civil cases, and the [[Sessions Court]] for criminal cases. The [[Delhi Police]], headed by the [[Police Commissioner of Delhi|Police Commissioner]], is one of the largest metropolitan police forces in the world.<ref name=largepolice>{{cite web

==Government and politics==

[[Image:NorthBlock.jpg|thumb|right|The [[North Block]], built in 1931 during the [[British Raj]], houses key government offices]]
As a special [[union territory]], in the same manner as that of Pondicherry, the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, Council of Ministers and Chief Minister. The legislative assembly seats are filled by direct election from territorial constituencies in the NCT. However, the Union Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi. While services like transport and others are taken care of by the Delhi Govt., services such as the police are directly under the control of the Central Government. The legislative assembly was re-established in 1993 for the first time since 1956, with direct federal rule in the span. In addition, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) handles civic administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj act. New Delhi, an urban area in Delhi, is the seat of both the State Government of Delhi and the Government of India. The [[Parliament of India]], the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]] (Presidential Palace) and the [[Supreme Court of India]] are located in New Delhi. There are 70 assembly constituencies and seven [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi.<ref name=assmbconst>{{cite web

Delhi was a traditional stronghold of the [[Indian National Congress]], also known as the Congress Party. In the 1990s the [[BJP|Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) under the leadership of [[Madan Lal Khurana]] came into power. However in 1998, Congress regained power. [[Sheila Dixit]] of Congress is the incumbent Chief Minister. The Congress retained power in the Legislative Assembly in the 2003 election as well by a large margin. However, in 2007, the BJP scored a crushing victory over the ruling Congress in the MCD election. Both parties have advocated full-fledged statehood for Delhi, but the process to establish this has been slow. The next election are slated to take place soon and this has heated up the politics of the city.

Several industrial units in Delhi rely on their own electrical generators to meet their electric demand and for back up during Delhi's frequent and disruptive power cuts. A few years ago, the power sector in Delhi was handed over to private companies. The distribution of electricity is carried out by companies run by [[Tata Power]] and [[Reliance Energy]].

[[Auto rickshaws]] are one of the popular means of public transportation in Delhi, as they charge a lower fare than taxis. Most run on [[Compressed Natural Gas]] (CNG) and are yellow and green in colour. Although they are equipped with electronic meters, which are supposed to show the fare, these are rarely used and bargaining is the norm. [[Taxicab|Taxi]]s are not an integral part of Delhi public transport, though they are easily available. Private operators operate most taxis, and most neighborhoods have a taxi stand from which taxis can be ordered or picked up. In addition, [[radio taxis]], which can be ordered by calling a central number, have become increasingly popular. These are usually air-conditioned and charge a flat rate of Rs. 15 per [[kilometer]]. 

[[Railways]] served only 1% of the local traffic until 2003.<ref name=ecosurv12/> However Delhi is a major junction in the [[:Image:India railway schematic map.svg|rail map of India]] and is the headquarters of the [[Northern Railway (India)|Northern Railway]].
