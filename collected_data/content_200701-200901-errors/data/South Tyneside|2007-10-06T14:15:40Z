'''South Tyneside''' is a [[metropolitan borough]] in [[Tyne and Wear]] in [[North East England|North East]] [[England]].

It is bordered by four other boroughs - [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[Gateshead]] to the west, [[Sunderland]] in the south, and [[North Tyneside]] to the north.  The border county of [[Northumberland]] lies further north.  The borough was formed on [[April 1]], [[1974]] by the merger of the [[county borough]] of [[South Shields]] along with the [[municipal borough]] of [[Jarrow]] and the [[urban district]]s of [[Boldon]] and [[Hebburn]] from [[County Durham]].

South Tyneside is relatively small in terms of geographical area (64.43 km²/ 24.98 miles²) and population (152 785, June 2003). The [[North Sea]] lies east and to the north the [[River Tyne]].  There is 23.64 km²/ 9.12 miles² of [[Green Belt]] at its southern boundary.

The main administrative centre and largest town is [[South Shields]]. Other riverside towns are [[Jarrow]] and [[Hebburn]], while the villages of [[Cleadon]], [[Whitburn, South Tyneside|Whitburn]] and [[The Boldons]] border the South Tyneside green belt which borders [[Wearside]] to the south at Sunderland.

South Tyneside is represented by two Members of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] with two [[constituencies]] at South Shields and Jarrow (which also serves Hebburn and the Urban Fringe villages).

==History==
Celtic traditions, Roman settlers, Angles, Saxons and Jutes, Viking invasions, Irish immigrants, Tyneside migrants, Arab seafarers and more recently the settling of people from the Indian sub-continent reflect the present-day culture of South Tyneside.

In South Shields (Latin 'Arbeia', Anglo-Saxon 'Caer Urfa'), excavations and a reconstructed fort are found at Arbeia (AD 160).  This fort served as a garrison and an outpost of the Roman Empire, and is part of Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site.  The hospitality strip at Ocean Road is famed throughout the region for its Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Chinese cuisine.  Mill Dam, with former Customs House (now a theatre, cinema and arts complex), cobbled lanes and Mission to Seafarers centre, stands tribute to the long and proud history of shipping in the town and the river Tyne.

Bede's World in Jarrow (Anglo Saxon 'Gyrwe') is dedicated to the life of the Venerable Bede, the 'Father of English History'.  The nominated World Heritage Site is straddled by two rivers - the Tyne and the Don.  There is a medieval monastery (St. Paul's Church, AD 681), an Anglo-Saxon farm with rare breed animals and buildings constructed in original materials from that period, and the Georgian Jarrow Hall.  The [[Jarrow Crusade]] of 1936 was a key event in the town's history and the original banner carried by the marchers to London can be viewed at Jarrow Town Hall.

The local identification of [[South Shields]] people with Arabs, which is widespread in the region, may have originated from the placename Arbeia (which is apparently a Latinized version of an Aramaic term meaning "place of the Arabs"), but there has also been a fairly sizeable Arab community in South Shields since the 1890s.

==Economy==

Shipbuilding and repairing, coal mining and exports, and the chemical industries declined from the latter half of the 20th Century, resulting in mass unemployment.  In more recent years, however, this trend has reversed and South Tyneside attracts new industries, most notably in the service sector.  There is still a considerable manufacturing base of ship-repair and offshore services, engineering, electronics, clothing, furniture, paper products, timber and small precision engineering.

At one time, Tyneside built 25% of the world's ships.  [[South Tyneside College]] specialises in maritime training and attracts students from around the world.

Tourism is also an important and growing industry.

==Places of interest==

South Shields town centre offers high street shopping with a regular market and museum & art gallery.  Arbeia Roman Fort Museum offers a reconstructed Roman fort at the Lawe Top.  The seafront offers the traditional British seaside experience - fairground, parks, boating lake and miniature steam railway, amusements and arcades, hotels, bed and breakfasts, caravan and camping sites, restaurants, amphitheatre, outdoor live entertainment, promenades, Groyne lighthouse and the mile-long South Pier.  On the coast road to Whitburn, Marsden Rock, a monstrous limestone stack colonised by sea birds, is a longstanding tourist attraction.  Less famous is the nearby Souter Lighthouse, the first in the world to be generated by electricity, and the secluded Jackie's Beach is a welcome change from the busier beaches of Marsden.  Much of the coastal scenery in this area was until two decades ago dominated by the spoil heaps and pithead winding gear of the collieries, but those are now gone and the area's natural beauty has been restored.

The Customs House Arts Centre,situated in the Mill Dam conservation area hosts theatre,cinema, art gallery and restaurant and is open 363 days a year.

[[Bede's World]], the [[Tyne Pedestrian Tunnel]], the refurbished Viking Shopping Centre, and [[J Barbour]] factory outlet at Jarrow are also of interest.

Westoe, Harton, Cleadon, East Boldon, Monkton and Whitburn are typical suburban villages offering traditional pubs, building styles and small shopping boutiques.  There is a cricket ground at Whitburn village.

Hebburn riverside is surprisingly green and open with views to the busy shipyards across-river at Wallsend.

[[South Shields Sailing Club]], Temple Park Leisure Centre, Gypsies Green and Monkton Stadium, [[Hebburn Swimming Pool]], national and local cycle routes, open areas and parks are the main outdoor recreational areas.  The [[Great North Run]] is the world's biggest half marathon which takes place every September/October, starting in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and finishing on [[The Leas]] in [[South Shields]].

In summer there is a festival with opening street parade, street and stage entertainment and an open-top tour bus connecting various places of interest.

==Environment==

The physical environment varies greatly in a small area: from industrial areas like Port of Tyne to business parks at Monkton and Boldon; traditional 'back to back' terraces to suburban housing; the River Tyne to the harbour, river entrance and open sea at Littlehaven; Marsden Quarry to the Great North Forest.

EcoCentre at Hebburn is a building constructed from recycled materials, self-reliant in power generation by means of its own wind turbine and is efficient in waste management.

The weather is variable and typical of a [[Maritime Climate]].

==Transport==

The [[A1 road|A1 (M)]], [[A19 road|A19]] and other trunk roads link South Tyneside to the national road network.  The [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] is a light rail system connecting the area with the rest of the Tyneside conurbation, Sunderland, and Newcastle's main line Central Station and International Airport.  The [[Tyne Tunnel|Tyne Road and Pedestrian Tunnels]] traverse the river at Jarrow and Howdon.  A passenger only cross-river [[Shields Ferry|ferry]] also serves the towns of North and South Shields.  The Port of Tyne situated at Tyne Dock is a growing terminal handling large volumes of freight, including exports from the [[NMUK|Nissan]] car plant at Washington.

==Language==

'Sandancer' is the local name given to people born and brought up in South Shields. So 'Sandancer' (Sand dancer) is a term often referred to as a native of South Shields. Sanddancer is not an accent, the accent in [[South Shields]] (like all Tyneside and surrounding areas) is [[Geordie]], mainly because a the majority proportion of the people from South Shields are descendants from Tyneside with some from southern Co Durham.

The term Sandancer is a reference to the longstanding Arab connections of the town, and a popular mid-twentieth century comic Music Hall turn by [[Wilson, Keppel and Betty]] (who had no known South Shields connections), which imitated depictions of dancing in Egyptian tomb art.

==People==

Well known South Tynesiders include author Dame [[Catherine Cookson]], former three times Prime Minister of New Zealand Sir [[William Fox (New Zealand)|William Fox]], actress Dame [[Flora Robson]], Hollywood director [[Ridley Scott]], entrepreneur J. Barbour and athlete [[Steve Cram]].  Author [[Lewis Carroll]] was inspired to write '[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]' and '[[Through the Looking Glass]]' by local residents he met when staying in Whitburn.  South Tynesiders are noted for their hospitality, community spirit and sense of humour.

==Twinned cities==

South Tyneside is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with [[Épinay-sur-Seine]], [[France]]; [[Noisy-le-Sec]], France; and [[Wuppertal]], [[Germany]]
