'''Cy-Fair College''' is one of five colleges in the [[North Harris Montgomery Community College District]] in northwest Houston, Cypress, Texas. It opened on August 25, 2003 to serve the Cy-Fair community. This $95 million, 200-acre campus was built with local bond money and as of the day of its opening, Cy-Fair College is the only new comprehensive college or university developed in the United States. 

According to Cy-Fair College “Facts and Figures:”

"This comprehensive community college provides a full range of university transfer, adult literacy, workforce development and life-long learning for the community. Its unique design enhances learning in a digital world and provides the support for students to be successful at any stage of their life." (13)

Cy-Fair College opened its doors with two innovative partnerships, one a joint-use library with Harris County and the other a partnership with the Emergency Services District #9 and the Cy-Fair Volunteer Fire Department.

'''Harris County Public Library – Cy-Fair College Branch'''
The county and the college collaborated to create a joint-use library to enhance services to the public and the college and to save tax dollars. This 78,000 sq. ft. blended library has resulted in extended hours, community meeting rooms, 200+ computers, a children’s library, teen room, both tutoring and counseling for students and the public. Not only do the librarians teach research to college students, but also teach English as a Second Language classes, develop community programming using the vast academic resources of a college, teach computer workshops, and sponsor book clubs. The county funds the salary of one counselor so career counseling and resume help can be offered to the public free of charge.

'''Emergency Services Training Center and Neighborhood Fire Station'''
According to Cy-Facts and Figures:

<blockquote>In partnership with the Emergency Services District #9 and the Cy-Fair Volunteer Fire Department, a $4 million Emergency Services Training Center was built on college land. Students in Fire Science and Emergency Medical services programs 
. . . have opportunities to develop hands-on skills in this working fire station that includes a simulated emergency room and a state-of-the-art burn facility. The programming that is possible through this facility and the training partnership that it supports will allow the NW Harris County area to meet its need to train firefighters, emergency medical technicians and paramedics.(13)
</blockquote> 
'''Workforce Needs'''

The growth of the area prompted Cy-Fair College to provide the area with programs which would support the rapidly changing workplace and world. The support of the business community was a key factor in the success of the petition to create the college and the workforce development programs reflect these needs including emergency services, health careers and nursing, technology and manufacturing.

'''Three years later: Fall 2006'''
On Sept. 12, 2006, Cy-Fair College President Dr. Diane Troyer writes to her employees, “Enrollment tops projections once again!
Well, it’s official!  Cy-Fair College did enroll over 11,000 students this fall which represents an 8.3% increase in students served. Our number of contact hours increased by 9.4% which is important because the state bases its funding formula for community colleges on contact hours. This places Cy-Fair College as the largest college in NHMCCD.” (email)
