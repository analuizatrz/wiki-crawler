'''55 Cancri e''' is an [[extrasolar planet]] with a [[mass]] similar to that of [[Neptune]] orbiting the [[Sun]]-like [[star]] [[55 Cancri|55 Cancri A]]. It takes less than three [[day]]s to complete an [[orbit]] and is the innermost known planet in its [[planetary system]]. 55 Cancri e was discovered in 2004.

==Discovery==
Like the majority of known extrasolar planets, 55 Cancri e was discovered by detecting variations in its star's [[radial velocity]]. This was achieved by making sensitive measurements of the [[Doppler shift]] of the [[spectrum]] of 55 Cancri A. At the time of its discovery, three other planets were known orbiting the star. After accounting for these planets, a signal at around 2.8 days remained, which could be explained by a planet of at least 14.2 [[Earth]] masses in a very close orbit.<ref name="mcarthur">{{cite journal|url=http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0408585|author=McArthur, B. et al.|title=Detection of a NEPTUNE-mass planet in the ρ<sup>1</sup> Cnc system using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=614|year=2004|pages=L81 &ndash; L84}}</ref> The same measurements were used to confirm the existence of the uncertain planet [[55 Cancri c]].

55 Cancri e was one of the first extrasolar planets with a mass comparable to that of Neptune to be discovered. It was announced at the same time as another "hot Neptune" orbiting the [[red dwarf]] star [[Gliese 436]] named [[Gliese 436 b]].

===Planet challenged===
In 2005 the existence of planet e was questioned by [[Jack Wisdom]] in a reanalysis of the data.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/users/wisdom/planet.ps|format=[[PostScript]]|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] Letters (submitted)|author=Wisdom, J.|title=Evidence of a Neptune-Sized Planet in the ρ<sup>1</sup> Cancri System|year=2005}}</ref> According to him, instead of the 2.8-day planet there is a planet with a mass similar to that of Neptune in a 261-day orbit around 55 Cancri A. In 2007, [[Debra Fisher]] and colleagues at [[San Francisco State University]] published a new analysis<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&articleID=16EEA019-E7F2-99DF-313BF41351A7B653&ref=rdf]</ref> indicating that ''both'' planets existed; the planet in the 260-day orbit was accordingly designated [[55 Cancri f]].

==Orbit and mass==
55 Cancri e is located in a very close orbit around the star which takes less than three days to complete and falls into the category of "hot Neptunes". The planet's orbit is fairly [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentric]], a result of interactions with the nearby [[Jupiter]]-mass planet [[55 Cancri b]] which prevent [[tide|tidal forces]] from circularising the orbit.

A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect 55 Cancri e is that only a minimum mass can be obtained, in this case around 14.2 times that of Earth, or 80% of the mass of Neptune. [[Astrometry|Astrometric]] observations made with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] suggest that the outer planet [[55 Cancri d]] is inclined at 53° with respect to the plane of the sky.<ref name="mcarthur" /> If these measurements are confirmed and the system is assumed to be [[coplanarity|coplanar]], the [[true mass]] of the planet would therefore be about 25% greater than this lower limit, at around 1 Neptune mass.

==Characteristics==
Since the planet has only been detected indirectly through its [[gravity|gravitational]] influence on 55 Cancri A, properties such as its [[radius]], composition and [[temperature]] are unknown. It is also unknown whether it is a small [[gas giant]] like Neptune or a large [[terrestrial planet]]. Large terrestrial planets may be formed from material compacted by the inward [[planetary migration|migration]] of the system's gas giants.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?2005A%26A...441..791F&db_key=AST&nosetcookie=1|author=Fogg, M., Nelson, R.|title=Oligarchic and giant impact growth of terrestrial planets in the presence of gas giant planet migration|journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]|volume=441|issue=2|pages=791 &ndash; 806|year=2005}}</ref> Alternatively 55 Cancri e may be the [[planetary core|core]] of a gas giant pushed inwards before it had time to accumulate a significant gaseous envelope.<ref name="mcarthur" />

It is considered unlikely that the planet is the evaporated remnant of a gas giant (a [[chthonian planet]]). The existence of transiting [[Jupiter|Jovian]] planets in short period orbits indicates that gas giants can survive for long timescales in the inner regions of a planetary system.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.citebase.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:arXiv.org:astro-ph/0404264|author=Bouchy, F. et al.|title=Two new "very hot Jupiters" among the OGLE transiting candidates|journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]|volume=421|year=2004|pages=L13 &ndash; L16}}</ref>
