The '''Yellowstone Fire of 1988''' was the largest [[wildfire]] in the recorded history of [[Yellowstone National Park]]. The fires were a result of a lack of understanding of [[fire ecology]] and the role it plays in maintaining healthy ecosystems as well as a severe drought that was the worst the park had ever experienced. Though initially small and believed to be easy to contain, increasing winds and drought allowed the fires to quickly spread out of control in a matter of a few days. Prior to the late 1960's, all fire was almost universally believed to be detrimental for parks and forests, and management policies were directed towards [[Wildland fire suppression|suppressing]] all fires as quickly as possible. In the decades before the Yellowstone fire of 1988, land management agencies had been highly successful in reducing the acreage lost annually to fire. This success came at a price, for the absence of fire had the negative side effect of increasing the amount of dead and down timber which in turn increased the risks of large and harder to control fires. 

Tens of thousands of firefighters fought the fire and were assisted by dozens of [[helicopter]]s and aircraft which were used to perform water and [[fire retardant]] drops. At the peak of the effort, over 9,000 firefighters were assigned to the park. With fires raging throughout the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]] and other areas in the [[United States]], the relatively low staffing levels of the [[National Park Service]] and other land management agencies was inadequate to meet the demands of the situation. Over 4,000 [[Military of the United States|U.S. Military]] personnel, with helicopters and other equipment, assisted in fire suppression efforts. No firefighters died while fighting the fires in Yellowstone, though two related deaths outside the park were recorded. The losses to structures were minimized by concentrating fire fighting efforts near major visitor areas. Much of the park remained open to the public during the fire. The fire fighting effort cost [[United States Dollar|$]]120 million and property damage was $3 million.

The fires burned for several months and by the time the winter snows finally extinguished the flames, 793,880&nbsp;[[Acre|acres]] (321,271&nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]]) or roughly 36 percent of the park had been impacted.<ref name="Young">{{cite web |last=Young|first=Linda |url = http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_26c.html |title = Flames of Controversy: Interpreting the Yellowstone Fires of 1988 | work = Wildland Fire Education and Outreach Case Studies |format = |publisher = National Interagency Fire Command| accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref> The fires were considered a disaster by many, especially in the years shortly after they had ended, but [[forester]]s and [[ecology|ecologists]] have shown that fire is a natural part of the ecosystem. Media reports of mismanagement and of the fire completely destroying most of the park were oftentimes based on sensationalism and due to the difficulty the National Park Service had in fully assessing the day to day situation and accurately disseminating precise details to the media. 

The fires burned in a mosaic pattern; leaping from one area to another and leaving expanses of forestland completely untouched. Though a number of large [[firestorm]]s swept through some regions, burning everything in their paths, more than half of the burned areas experienced ground fires which did little damage to mature trees. However, tens of millions of trees and countless plants were killed by the wildfires and some regions were left looking blackened and dead. Almost 20 years after the fires, many of the hardest hit regions still have numerous snags and an immature forest which clearly delineate where the fires had burned. Not long after the fires ended, plant and trees species quickly reestablished themselves. Natural plant regeneration has been fully successful, with most of the forestland and other areas that burned now thriving in a healthier ecosystem. Few large mammals were killed by the fires though there has been a reduction in the number of [[moose]] which has yet to rebound. Aside from temporary declines in air quality during the fires, no adverse long term health effects have been recorded in the ecosystem. The knowledge gained from the fire has been invaluable in updating fire management policies and for reaching a better understanding of the role of fire in the environment.

== Early perspectives on wildfires ==
Some researchers as well as timber companies and private citizens who had lived in forestlands understood that fire was often beneficial to the environment. [[Native American]]s would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as [[bison]] and [[elk]].<ref name="indians">{{cite web|last=MacCleery|first=Doug| title =The Role of American Indians in Shaping The North American Landscape| work =| publisher =Forest History Society| url =http://www.foresthistory.org/Research/usfscoll/people/Native%20Americans/AmIndian.html| accessdate = 2007-07-28}}</ref> Fire was known to be a natural part of the ecosystem in the eastern United States where wildfires remained relatively small and rarely posed great risk to life and property. As [[caucasian|white]] settlements moved further west, attitudes regarding fire quickly reversed. Range fires on the [[Great Plains]] moved rapidly and were a threat to livestock and agriculture as well as people. As settlements became established in the northern plains and [[Rocky Mountains]] regions, the first large scale forest fires were encountered. A number of catastrophic fire events over the years greatly influenced fire management policies and directives.

The worst loss of life in United States history due to a wildfire occurred in 1871 when the [[Peshtigo Fire]] swept through [[Wisconsin]], killing more than 1,500 people.<ref name="Peshtigo">{{cite web| title =Firestorms of 1871| work =Disasters| publisher =Boise State University| url =http://www.boisestate.edu/history/ncasner/hy210/peshtigo.htm| accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref> The [[Great Fire of 1889]] in [[California]] and especially the [[Great Fire of 1910]] in [[Montana]] and [[Idaho]], which destroyed a number of communities and killed 86 people, contributed to the philosophy that fire was a dangerous entity that needed to be dealt with.<ref name="Aplet">{{cite journal| last =Aplet| first =Gregory H.| title =Evolution of Wilderness Fire Policy| journal =International Journal of Wilderness| volume =12| issue =1| pages =9-13| date =April 2006| url =http://www.wilderness.net/library/documents/IJWApr06_Aplet.pdf| accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref> The Great Fire of 1910 had burned 3&nbsp;million acres (1,214,056&nbsp;ha) and prompted various land management agencies in the United States to develop fire management plans to organize and establish parameters for combating fires. [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]] land agencies including the National Park Service generally followed the policies established by the [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] regarding fire management, as that agency oversees the majority of the nation's forestlands.

Prior to the middle of the 20th Century, most forest managers believed that fires should be suppressed at all times.<ref name="NRDC">{{cite web| title =Wildfires in Western Forests| work =| publisher = Natural Resources Defense Council| date =May 2003| url =http://www.nrdc.org/land/forests/pfires.asp| format =| accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref> By  1935, the [[U.S. Forest Service]]'s fire management policy stipulated that all wildfires were to be suppressed by 10 A.M. the morning after they were first spotted.<ref name="policy">{{cite web| title =Evolution of Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy| work =Review and Update of the 1995 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy January 2001| publisher = National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service| date =January 2001| url =http://www.nifc.gov/fire_policy/docs/chp1.pdf| format =pdf| accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref> In an effort to fight forest fires in an organized manner, fire fighting crews were established throughout public lands, and generally staffed by young men during fire seasons. By 1940, firefighters known as [[smokejumper]]s would parachute out of airplanes to extinguish flames in remote locations. Over 8,000 [[fire lookout tower]]s were built in the United States by the beginning of [[World War II]], and though many have been torn down due to increased use of airplanes for fire spotting, three are still used each year in Yellowstone.<ref name="lookouts">{{cite web| title =Fire Lookouts of Sequoia National Forest| work =| publisher = U.S. Forest Service| date =May 14, 2006| url =http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/sequoia/lookouts/lookouts.html| format =| accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref><ref name="lookouts2">{{cite web| title =Fire Lookouts| work =| publisher = National Park Service| date =June 11, 2007| url =http://www.nps.gov/yell/parkmgmt/lookouts.htm| format =| accessdate = 2007-07-28}}</ref> Firefighting efforts were highly successful, with acreage burned by wildfires reduced from an annual average of 30&nbsp;million acres (12 million&nbsp;ha) during the 1930's, to between 2 and 5&nbsp;million acres (810,000 and 2 million&nbsp;ha) by the 1960's.<ref name="NRDC"/> The need for lumber during World War II was high and fires that destroyed timberland were deemed unacceptable. In 1944, the U.S. Forest Service developed an ad campaign to help educate the public that all fires were detrimental. Using a cartoon [[American Black Bear|black bear]] named [[Smokey Bear]], this iconic firefighting bear can still be seen on posters with the catch phrase, "Only you can prevent forest fires".<ref name="Smokey">{{cite web| title =The Story of Smokey Bear| work =| publisher = U.S. Forest Service| date =July 13, 2005| url =http://www.fs.fed.us/r1/centennial/smokey.shtml| format =| accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref><ref name="Young"/> Early posters of Smoky Bear mislead the public into believing that western wildfires were predominately human caused. In Yellowstone, human caused fires average between 6 to 10 annually while another 35 wildfires are ignited by lightning.<ref name="lookouts2"/>

===Changing attitudes about the role of fire===
As early as 1924, environmentalist [[Aldo Leopold]] argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems, and were necessary for natural [[plant propagation]] of numerous tree and plant species. For the next 40 years, more foresters and ecologists concurred about the beneficial nature of wildfire to ecosystems. In 1963, a group of ecologists consulted by the [[National Park Service]] recommended that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the environmental balance in parks. The passing of the [[Wilderness Act]] in 1964, helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems.<ref name="Aplet"/> By 1968, the National Park Service adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes regarding the positive role of natural fire. The service determined that fires that started naturally (by lightning), would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property. The service also decreed that under prescribed conditions, [[controlled burn]]s would be deliberately set to restore balance to ecosystems.<ref name="policy"/> Increased knowledge of [[fire ecology]] came a little too late to save many forestlands, as decades of fire suppression had allowed an accumulation of dead and down trees. By the mid 1980's, the [[lodgepole pine]] forest which dominated most of the forested areas of Yellowstone National Park had seen few large fires to eliminate dead growth. 

Known as ''prescribed natural fire'', the park service implemented this change in fire management policy by 1972, allowing natural fires in Yellowstone to burn under controlled situations. Park employees also greatly reduced the quantity of dead and down timber that was within close proximity to structures and tourists areas under the directives of what later became the Hazard Fuels Reduction Plan. This was done to ensure fires would have less opportunity to threaten lives and destroy the many historical structures and visitor facilities found throughout the park. As of 2007, the baseline distance for hazard fuels reduction was 400&nbsp;feet from structures and other prioritized locations.<ref name="hazard">{{cite web| title =Yellowstone National Park Structure Protection and Firefighter Safety Hazard Fuels Management Guidelines| work =Yellowstone National Park Fire Management Plan| publisher = National Park Service| date =2005| url =http://www.nps.gov/yell/parkmgmt/upload/hazard.pdf|format=pdf| accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref> Between 1972 and 1987, a total of 235 natural fires burned a relatively small 33,759&nbsp;acres (13,661&nbsp;ha) in the park under the directives of the prescribed natural fire policy. Of these, only 15 of the fires had spread to more than 100&nbsp;acres (40&nbsp;ha). The five years prior to 1988 were also a lot wetter than normal and this may have reduced the acreage of the fires during that period.<ref name="wildfire">{{cite web| title =Wildland Fire in Yellowstone| work =Wildland Fire| publisher = National Park Service| date =June 11, 2007| url =http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/wildlandfire.htm| accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref>

== Recipe for disaster ==
Yellowstone's forest are dominated by the [[lodgepole pine]] which is an tree that is eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100 years during the normal process of forest progression.<ref name="lodgepole">{{cite web| last=Lotan| first=James E.|title =Lodgepole Pine| work =Pinus contorta| publisher =U.S. Forest Service|date=| url =http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_1/pinus/contorta.htm| accessdate = 2007-07-28}}</ref> In Yellowstone, a very short growing season due to high altitude allows the lodgepole pine to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as [[Engelmann spruce]] and [[subalpine fir]] become established.<ref name="lodgepole"/> The lodgepole pines found throughout the [[Yellowstone Plateau]] highcountry grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings. Though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur, they are not found in large stands as in other forests in the Rocky Mountains. By the 1980's much of the lodgepole pine forests in Yellowstone were between 200 and 250 years old and approaching the end of their lifecycle.<ref name="Franke2">{{cite web| last=Franke|first=Mary Ann|title =The Summer of 1988| work =Yellowstone in the Afterglow| publisher =National Park Service| format= pdf|date =2000| url =http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/chapter2.pdf| accessdate = 2007-07-17}}</ref>

The [[mountain pine beetle]] had killed a number of trees in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which increased the fuel load and likely contributed to the fires.<ref name="Lynch">{{cite journal| last =Lynch| first =Heather| coauthors =Roy A.

The winter season of 1987-1988 was drier than usual, with the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem receiving only 31% of the normal snowpack.<ref name="Franke2"/> However, April and May 1988 were very wet and the abundant moisture greatly aided grass and [[understory|undergrowth]] development. By June, the rainfall stopped and little was recorded in the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for the next four months. By July, the worst drought in the history of Yellowstone National Park began. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer soon turned to dry tinder. [[Relative humidity]] levels fell further desiccating the forest. Fuel moisture content in dead and fallen timber was recorded as low as 5%. By mid-August, humidity levels were averaging below 20% and were recorded as low as 6% on one occasion.<ref name="Franke2"/> To compound the lack of rainfall, the majority of Yellowstone's soils are [[Rhyolite|rhyolitic]] volcanic rocks and soils which have poor moisture retention.<ref name="Franke1"/> 

Accumulated fuel, old forests, dead and dying trees, abundant grasses and other understory plants, and unabated and exceptionally dry conditions spelled trouble for Yellowstone. However, foresters and fire ecologists predicted a normal fire season for the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and anticipated normal rainfall for July.<ref name="Franke2"/> Past history provided little evidence to suggest that 1988 would be any different than the previous 100 plus years the park had existed. But, as major fires started to break out throughout the Rocky Mountain region, the media began to take notice. Twenty small fires started in Yellowstone by July and of those, eleven went out on their own. The remainder were closely monitored in accordance with the prescribed natural fire policies. By July 15th fires throughout the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem had burned 8,500&nbsp;acres (3,440&nbsp;ha) and though this was not out of the ordinary, media focus on fires raging throughout the American west influenced the decision by the park officials to initiate fire suppression efforts on July 15th. Within a week after suppression efforts commenced, the fires had spread to include almost 100,000&nbsp;acres (40,470&nbsp;ha) just on the parkland alone.<ref name="wildfire"/>

== Major fires ==
[[Image:Ground fire at Grant Village 2.jpg|thumb|right|Ground fires in Grant Village quickly climbed trees into the canopy and became crown fires]]
Fifty different fires started in Yellowstone and the surrounding National Forests between June and August, and of these, 7 fires were responsible for 95% of the total acreage that burned. By the end of July, even though the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel, the fires continued to expand. Smaller fires burned into each other, propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain. On August 20, the single worst day of the fires and later dubbed "Black Saturday", more than 150,000&nbsp;acres (60,702&nbsp;ha) were consumed during one of numerous [[firestorm]]s. Ash from the firestorms throughout the park drifted as far away as [[Billings, Montana]], 60&nbsp;miles (96&nbsp;km) to the northeast.<ref name="Franke2"/> The wind driven flames jumped roads and all firelines, and burning embers started new fires a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) or more ahead of the main fires. Ground fires raced up tree limbs to the forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over 200&nbsp;feet (60&nbsp;m) high. On that single day, more Yellowstone acreage burned than had in all the other fires combined since the establishment of the park.<ref name="Lewis"/>  Throughout the summer fires were known to make huge advances of 5 to 10&nbsp;miles (8-16&nbsp;km) a day, and there were even occasions when more than 2&nbsp;miles (3.2&nbsp;km) in one hour were recorded.<ref name="disaster">{{cite web| last=|first=|coauthors=|title =Yellowstone and the Politics of Disaster| work =A Test of Adversity and Strength: Wildland Fire in the National Park System| publisher =National Park Service| format=pdf|date =| url =http://www.nps.gov/fire/download/fir_wil_history_ch7.pdf| accessdate = 2007-07-30}}</ref> 

One large group of fires was known as the Snake River Complex. These fires were in the southern section of the park, in the headwaters region of the [[Yellowstone River|Yellowstone]] and [[Snake River]]s. The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone fire which was started by lightning on June 23. The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect for this fire so fire suppression was not initially commenced. The fire smoldered with little movement for several weeks, then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20.<ref name="Rothermel">{{cite web| last=Rothermel|first=Richard|coauthors= Roberta Hartford and Carolyn Chase|title =Fire Growth Maps for the 1988 Greater Yellowstone Area Fires| work =| publisher =U.S. Forest Service| format=|date =January 1994| url =http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr304.html| accessdate = 2007-07-30}}</ref> The Red fire started near Lewis Lake on July 1 and like the Shoshone fire, advanced little for several weeks and then also moved northeast by July 19 and combined with the Shoshone fire in August. As these two fires advanced towards the Grant Village area, evacuations were ordered so fire fighting crews could concentrate on structure protection. In the midst of a large lodgepole pine forest, the Grant Village complex was the first major tourist area impacted that season. A number of small structures and the some of the campground complex was destroyed. After the Red and Shoshone fires combined, they were referred to as the Shoshone fire, since it was much larger. The Mink fire started in [[Bridger-Teton National Forest]] from lightning on July 11, and burned north following the Yellowstone River valley, after firefighters forced the fire away from private lands. The Mink fire eventually burned sections inside the park after July 23, but was deemed to be a low risk since it was in a very remote section of the park.<ref name="Rothermel"/>[[Image:Fire above Snake River.jpg|thumb|right|The Huck fire approaches the Snake River]] The third large fire was the Huck fire, which started after a tree fell on a power line during the powerful winds on August 20th. The fire burned primarily in the [[John D.

Combined, they burned more than 140,000&nbsp;acres (56,660&nbsp;ha) before they were extinguished by wet weather in the fall. One of the most impressive events of this fire complex occurred on August 23 when firestorms swept across the Lewis River Canyon, propelled by winds of 60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;kph) and gusting to 80&nbsp;mph (128&nbsp;kph).<ref name="Lewis">{{cite web| last=|first=|title =Lodgepole Pine Forests & Fire| work =Grant Village Area Natural Highlights| publisher =National Park Service| format= |date =July 11, 2006| url =http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/ngrant.htm| accessdate = 2007-07-28}}</ref> 

The Mist fire started on July 9 in the eastern section of the park in the [[Absaroka Mountains]]. Two days later, the Clover fire started in the same region and both fires combined and were renamed as the Clover Mist fire on July 20. Situated in rugged terrain, this fire was very difficult to fight and on August 20, the fire made rapid advances towards the small town of [[Cooke City-Silver Gate, Montana|Cooke City, Montana]] and continued to threaten the town for several more weeks.<ref name="Rothermel"/> The Clover Mist fire eventually consumed more than 140,000&nbsp;acres (56,660&nbsp;ha).<ref name="Schullery"/> The Storm Creek fire started on June 14 well north of the park and for almost two months seemed to pose little threat to Yellowstone. Then, on August 20th, the fire moved rapidly to the south also threatening the town of Cooke City, this time from the north. An effort to bulldoze a wide fire break and set backfires to try and starve the fires of combustibles almost became a disaster when an unexpected change in wind direction brought the fires to within a hundred yards of parts of the town, forcing evacuations on September 6th. The other major fire located in the northern section of the park was the Hellroaring fire. Started in [[Gallatin National Forest]] on August 15 from embers from an unattended campfire, the fire initially moved north, but then turned around a few days later and moved south, threatening the area near Tower Junction.<ref name="Rothermel"/>
[[Image:Firestorm Mirror Plateu.jpg|right|thumb|Firestorm on the Mirror plateau]]
In the northwest, the Fan fire started on June 25 and was originally considered a threat to the town of [[Gardiner, Montana]], just outside the park's north entrance. Firefighting efforts on this fire were the most successful of all that were undertaken in 1988. Though the fire wasn't contained for a couple of months, by mid August it was no longer considered a threat to lives and property.<ref name="Rothermel"/>

The largest fire in the park was the North Fork fire, both in terms of damage to structures and acreage burned. The fire started on July 22 when a man cutting timber dropped his cigarette in [[Caribou-Targhee National Forest]] just outside the park's western border.<ref name="cdc">{{cite web| last=Reh|first=Christopher|coauthors=Scott Deitchman|title =Health Hazard Evaluation Report No. 88-320| work =HETA 88-320-2176| publisher =National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health| format=pdf |date =February 1992| url =http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/reports/pdfs/1988-0320-2176.pdf| accessdate = 2007-07-29}}</ref> The North Fork fire was the only major fire that was fought from the beginning since it started after the prescribed fire policy was stopped on July 15th.<ref name="disaster"/> The fire spread towards the northeast and by the end of the first week of August was threatening Madison Junction and nearby campground facilities. The fire then raced towards [[Norris Geyser Basin|Norris]] Junction on August 20th. Firefighters there used water and [[Fire fighting foam|foam]] to keep the structures including a historic museum from being consumed by the blaze. The fire then raced along the Yellowstone Plateau towards facilities at [[Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone|Canyon]] on August 25th, where land management agencies and the U.S. military put forth enormous efforts to protect structures. The eastern flank of the fire calmed down for several days, then down sloping winds off the Yellowstone Plateau forced flames along the west side of the fire towards the town of [[West Yellowstone, Montana]].<ref name="Rothermel"/> There, private citizens assisted assigned personnel in soaking hundreds of acres of forestland to protect both the town and an electrical power substation. The fire burned a substantial section of forest along the [[Madison River]] valley.
[[Image:Crown fire Old Faithful.jpg|right|thumb|Fires near the Old Faithful complex on September 7, 1988]]
On July 7th, a dry front pushed flames along the southern section of the North Fork fire towards the large visitor complex adjacent to the [[Old Faithful Geyser]] basin. All non emergency personnel were evacuated and firefighters concentrated on structure protection, especially those of historical significance such as the [[Old Faithful Inn]].<ref name="Rothermel"/> The fires spread to forested sections near to, but generally away from major structures, and damage was minimized. The night of the 9th and the morning of the 10th of September, the North Fork fire jumped a fireline along its northeastern flank and approached [[Fort Yellowstone|Mammoth Hot Springs]] where a large concentration of historical structures as well as the Park Headquarters is located. Then rain as well as snow fell in Yellowstone and the fires all started to abate rapidly. By the time the North Fork fire finally died down, it was responsible for 60% of the burned area within the part; more than 400,000&nbsp;acres (162,000&nbsp;ha).<ref name="Schullery"/>

== Manpower and equipment ==
A total of 25,000 personnel were involved in the fire fighting effort, at a cost of 120 million dollars. Though no civilian lives were lost, two people outside the park in association with the fire fighting efforts were killed. Firefighters created 655&nbsp;miles (1,054&nbsp;km) of fireline by hand and 137&nbsp;miles (220&nbsp;km) with mechanized equipment, mostly bulldozers. 

Almost 120 helicopters and aircraft were used to combat the inferno. Aircraft logged over 18,000 hours of flight time and dropped 1.4&nbsp;million [[gallon|gallons]] (5.3&nbsp;million [[litre|liters]]) of [[fire retardant]] as well as 10&nbsp;million gallons (38&nbsp;million liters) of water on the fires.<ref name="cdc"/>

More than 100 [[fire engine]]s were assigned to the fire.<ref name="Young"/> Structural fire engines were most common in building complexes where a number are stationed permanently just as in any urban setting. Others were specialized [[wildland fire engine]]s which are generally smaller and have more capability for movement over rough terrain.

== Impact on the park ==
===Vegetation and wildlife affected===
Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals&mdash; surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished.<ref name="wildfire"/>

===Air and water impacts===
[[Image:Fires yellowstone.jpg|thumb|right|Smoke plumes from the 1988 fires as seen from space]]
The smoke and airborne particulates from the fires posed a threat to local communities on several occasions. Smoke and particulates were especially high in [[Gardiner, Montana]] where monitoring stations maintained by the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences and the park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate concentrations were exceeded. This was also the case near fires and on 7 occasions at Mammoth, Montana, the location of the park headquarters. However, in no other surrounding communities were particulates found to be above acceptable levels.<ref name="Franke2"/> Smoke and haze made driving difficult and even dangerous in extreme situations. A number of fire fighters were treated at clinics for smoke and dust inhalation and a few for inadvertently inhaling fumes from a sulfur ignition near one of the geothermal areas.<ref name="Franke2"/>

In the aftermath of the fires, erosion was of a particular concern, especially as the park received heavy rainfall the following year.

===Damage to buildings and other equipment===

The park service ensured that life and property took priority in their efforts to suppress the fires. Of the more than 1,000 structures located in the park, only 67 were destroyed. There were 400 structures located in the Old Faithful complex and only 19 of these were destroyed and 12 of those were concessionaire housing units and relatively inexpensive to replace.<ref name="Franke3">{{cite web| last=Franke|first=Mary Ann|title =Damage to Park Facilities| work =Yellowstone in the Afterglow| publisher =National Park Service| format= pdf|date =2000| url =http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/chapter3.pdf| accessdate = 2007-07-17}}</ref> Major tourist locations in the park such as the one at Old Faithful were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment, especially if fires were expected to present an immediate danger. Fire fighters used a variety of methods to establish safe zones in and near to these complexes, yet every single complex was evacuated by non critical personnel at least once during the fires.<ref name="Franke2"/>

Surprisingly, of the 38 backcountry patrol cabins used by park rangers and park staff, the only one lost to the fires was the one located at Sportsman Lake, and it was rebuilt the following summer. However, fires did a lot of damage to numerous campgrounds, backcountry bridges used by hikers as well as 10&nbsp;miles (16&nbsp;km) of power lines and 300 utility poles. Some of the boardwalks used to keep tourists elevated above geothermal areas were also destroyed but were quickly replaced.<ref name="Franke3"/>

== Media controversies ==

Being the world's first national park and well known around world, the fires were big media sensation and news crews converged on Yellowstone by late July 1988. Due to difficulty of fully assessing the fires, federal officials sometimes had limited information to provide the media. The National Park Service was besieged by 3,000 media requests during the fires and the two park public information officers, even though assisted by a staff of over 40 employees, were not always able to grant all requests. 15 more park personnel were assigned the role of information officer and were detailed to act as liaisons with the media at major areas where fire fighting manpower was concentrated. By the time the fires were well under control in mid November, the park was still receiving 40 to 70 media requests daily.<ref name="Franke2"/> Media coverage of the fires brought the National Park Service more national attention than it had ever received and the fires have been called one of the most important events in the history of that agency.<ref name="Young"/>

Lack of understanding by the media regarding wildfire management often led to sensationalistic reporting and inaccuracies.<ref name="education">{{cite web| last=|first=|title =Background Information| work =Fire and Aviation Management| publisher =National Park Service| date =| url =http://www.nps.gov/fire/educational/edu_tea_les_reporting.cfm| accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref> Some news agencies gave the impression that the majority of the park was destroyed.<ref name="Smith">{{cite web| last=Smith|first=Conrad|title =Media Coverage of the 1988 Yellowstone Fires| work =Wildland Fire| publisher =National Interagency Fire Center| date =| url =http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_25c.html| accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref> In one instance, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] news incorrectly identified the Director of the National Park Service as Stanley Mott when his actual first name is William, and in another, the [[New York Times]] incorrectly stated that the Park Service policy was for natural fires to burn themselves out, whereby the U.S. Forest Service always ensured that fires are completely suppressed.<ref name="Smith"/> Sources quoted by the [[Washington Post]], [[USA Today]] and the [[Chicago Tribune]] later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts.<ref name="Smith"/> On the same day, the Washington Post likened the smoke and the presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead to [[Danang, Vietnam]] in 1968, giving the impression of catastrophe.<ref name="Petersen">{{cite news| last =Petersen| first =Cass| coauthors =T.R.

The fires were very active in late July and after the situation appeared to be under control by mid August, the public affairs division of the National Park Service reported that the situation had improved in Yellowstone. When a new firestorm threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September, the media misrepresented this new, seemingly out of control situation, as evidence of ineptitude of park service management and policies.<ref name="Smith"/>

== The knowledge gained ==
Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the U.S., based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires.

In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire. [[Controlled burn]]s are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, since 1980, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas.<ref name="hazard"/> Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger.
