'''Jupiter''' ({{IPA2|ˈdʒupɪtər}}) is the fifth [[planet]] from the [[Sun]] and the [[Solar system by size|largest]] planet within the [[solar system]]. It is two and a half times as massive as all of the other planets combined, and is classified as a [[gas giant]] planet. Jupiter shares the gas giant classification with three other planets in the Solar System, namely [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]. Together, these four planets are sometimes referred to as the '''[[Jovian planet]]s''' (''Jovian'' being the adjectival form of Jupiter, derived from the Latin [[genitive]] of the noun).

When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an [[apparent magnitude]] of -2.8, making it the third brightest object in the night sky. The planet was known to [[Astronomer|astronomers]] of ancient times. The Romans named it after ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]'', the principal [[God (male deity)|God]] of [[Roman mythology]] (the name being a reduction of 'Deus Pater', 'God father' <ref>Dr Seth Lehrer, Stanford University, The Teaching Company 'History of the English Language</ref>), during the era of [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]].

The planet Jupiter is primarily composed of [[hydrogen]], with a smaller portion of [[helium]] and a rocky core. Due to its rapid rotation the planet possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator, giving it an [[oblate]] appearance. The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the [[Great Red Spot]], a giant storm that has been existent since at least the seventeenth century. Surrounding the planet is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful [[magnetosphere]]. There are also at least 63 moons, including the four large moons that were first discovered by [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1610.

Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft; most notably during the early [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] and [[Voyager program|Voyager]] fly-by missions, and later by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo orbiter]]. Future targets for exploration include the possible ice-covered liquid ocean on the Jovian moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].

==Overview==
Jupiter is usually the fourth brightest object in the night sky (after the Sun, the [[Moon]] and [[Venus]]);<ref name="worldbook">{{cite web | author=Peter J. Gierasch, Philip D. Nicholson | year = 2004 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/jupiter_worldbook.html | title = Jupiter | publisher = World Book @ NASA | accessdate = 2006-08-10 }}</ref> however at times [[Mars]] appears brighter than Jupiter.

[[Image:Jupiter-Earth-Spot_comparison.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Approximate size comparison of Earth and Jupiter, including the [[Great Red Spot]]]]
Jupiter is 2.5 times more [[mass]]ive than all the other planets combined; so massive that its [[Center of mass#Barycenter|barycenter]] with the Sun actually lies above the Sun's surface (1.068 [[solar radius|solar radii]] from the Sun's center). Although this planet dwarfs the Earth (with a diameter 11 times as great) it is considerably less dense. A volume equal to 1,300 Earths only contains 318 times as much mass.<ref name="worldbook" />

Along with the Sun, the [[gravity|gravitational]] influence of Jupiter has helped shape the Solar System. The orbits of most of the system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] than the Sun's [[celestial equator|equatorial plane]] ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is the only planet which is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the majority of [[List of periodic comets|short-period comets]] belong to Jupiter's family (a result due to both Jupiter's mass and its relative speed), the [[Kirkwood gap]]s in the [[asteroid belt]] are mostly due to Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] of the inner solar system's history.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kerr | first = Richard A. | title=Did Jupiter and Saturn Team Up to Pummel the Inner Solar System? | journal=Science | year=2004 | volume=306 | issue=5702 | pages=1676 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1676a?etoc }}</ref> Jupiter has been called the solar system's vacuum cleaner,<ref>{{cite news | title=Stardust's Comet Clues Reveal Early Solar System | publisher=National Geographic News | date=December 15, 2006 | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061215-comet-stardust.html | accessdate=2007-01-08 }}</ref> due to its immense [[gravity well]].

[[Extrasolar planet]]s have been discovered with much greater masses. There is no clear-cut definition of what distinguishes a large planet such as Jupiter from a [[brown dwarf]] star, although the latter possesses rather specific [[spectral line]]s. Currently, if an object of solar [[metallicity]] is 13 Jupiter masses or above, large enough to burn [[deuterium]], it is considered a brown dwarf; below that mass (and orbiting a star or stellar remnant), it is a planet.<ref>{{cite web | title=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets: Definition of a "Planet" | work=IAU position statement |date=February 28, 2003 | url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html | accessdate=2006-09-09}}</ref> Jupiter is thought to have about as large a diameter as a planet of its composition can; adding extra mass would cause the planet to shrink due to increased gravitational compression.

Although Jupiter would need to be about seventy-five times as massive to become a [[star]], the smallest [[red dwarf]] is only about 30% larger in radius than Jupiter.<ref>{{cite journal | author = A. Burrows, W. B. Hubbard, D. Saumon, J. I.

In spite of this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun. This additional heat radiation is generated by the [[Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism]] through [[adiabatic]] contraction. This process results in the planet shrinking by about 3 cm each year.<ref>{{cite book | editor=F. Bagenal, T. E. Dowling, W. B. McKinnon | author=T. Guillot, D. J. Stevenson, W. B. Hubbard, D.

However, because of its lower mass and weaker gravitational pull, [[Saturn]] would expand more rapidly than Jupiter with increasing heat; therefore, Saturn must have formerly been even larger than Jupiter.{{Fact|date=January 2007}}
[[Image: Jupiter.Aurora.HST.UV.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Aurora borealis]] on Jupiter.]]

Jupiter's [[rotation]] is the solar system's fastest, completing a rotation on its [[Coordinate axis|axis]] in slightly less than ten hours; this creates an [[equatorial bulge]] easily seen through an Earth-based amateur [[telescope]]. The planet is also perpetually covered with a layer of clouds, composed of [[ammonia]] crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulphide. Its best known feature is the [[Great Red Spot]], a [[storm]] larger than Earth which was likely first observed by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] and [[Robert Hooke]] four centuries ago. Indeed, mathematical models suggest that the storm is stable and may be a permanent feature of the planet.<ref>{{cite journal

==Historical observations==
The planet Jupiter has been known since ancient times and is visible to the naked eye in the night sky. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]  named the planet after the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (also called Jove). The [[astronomical symbol]] for the planet is a stylized representation of the god's lightning bolt. (&#9795; is found at [[Unicode]] position U+2643.)

The [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea]]n, [[Japan]]ese, and [[Vietnam]]ese refer to the planet as the ''wood star'', 木星,<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.crystalinks.com/jupiter.html
|title=JUPITER
|accessdate=2006-03-09}}</ref> based on the Chinese [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]]. In [[Jyotisha|Vedic Astrology]], Hindu astrologers refer to Jupiter as [[Brihaspati]], or "[[Guru]]" which means the "Big One". In [[Hindi]], Thursday is referred to as ''[[Guruvaar]]'' (day of Jupiter). In the [[English language]] Thursday is rendered as Thor's day, with [[Thor]] being identified with the Roman god Jupiter.

In [[1610]], [[Galileo Galilei]] discovered the four largest [[natural satellite|moons]] of Jupiter, [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] (now known as the [[Galilean moon]]s) using a telescope, the first observation of moons other than Earth's. This was also the first discovery of a [[celestial mechanics|celestial motion]] not apparently centered on the Earth. It was a major point in favor of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]]' [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of the motions of the planets; Galileo's outspoken support of the Copernican theory placed him under the threat of the [[Inquisition]].<ref>{{cite web | last =  S. Westfall | first = Richard | url = http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/galilei_gal.html | title = Galilei, Galileo | publisher = The Galileo Project | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}</ref>

In [[1892]], [[E. E. Barnard]] observed a fifth satellite of Jupiter with the 36-inch refractor at [[Lick Observatory]] in California. The discovery, a testament to his extraordinary eyesight, made him quickly famous. The moon was later named [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]].<ref>{{cite web | first = Joe | last = Tenn | date = March 10, 2006 | url = http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/Barnard/ | title = Edward Emerson Barnard | publisher = Sonoma State University | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}</ref>

==Physical characteristics==

===Composition===
Jupiter's upper atmosphere is composed of about 93% [[hydrogen]] and 7% [[helium]] by number of [[atom]]s, or approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with the remaining 1% of the mass accounted for by other substances. The interior contains denser materials such that the distribution is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium and 5% other elements, by mass. The atmosphere contains trace amounts of [[methane]], [[water vapor]], [[ammonia]], and "rock". There are also traces of [[carbon]], [[ethane]], [[hydrogen sulphide]], [[neon]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphine]], and [[sulphur]]. The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains [[crystal]]s of frozen ammonia.<ref name=voyager>{{cite journal

This atmospheric composition for hydrogen and helium is very close to the composition of the [[solar nebula]]. Galileo probe results show that neon in Jupiter's upper atmosphere is unexpectedly only about a tenth as abundant as in the sun (20 parts per million by mass, vs. 200 parts per million for the Sun) [http://www.britannica.com/eb/table?tocId=9390280]. This depletion may be due to the fact that the ice which carried heavier elements into Jupiter during formation was still too warm to hold all of its nebular neon (this requires temperatures below 17 Kelvins). Abundances of heavier inert gases in Jupiter's atmosphere are about 2 to 3 times solar abundance.  

On the basic of spectroscopy, [[Saturn]] is thought to have a quite similar composition to Jupiter, but [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] have relatively much less hydrogen and helium.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} However, very good abundance numbers for heavier elements are lacking for the other outer planets, due to lack of data from atmospheric entry probes from these.

===Shape, structure, and rotation===
Jupiter is an [[oblate]] spheroid, meaning that the [[diameter]] across its [[equator]] is longer than the diameter measured between its [[geographic pole|poles]]. On Jupiter, the equatorial diameter is 9275 km longer than the diameter measured through the poles. This is caused by Jupiter's rapid [[rotation]] which causes the equator to bulge outward.<ref name="lang03" />

There is still some uncertainty regarding the interior structure of Jupiter. One model shows a homogeneous model with no solid surface; the density may simply increase gradually toward the core. Alternatively Jupiter may possess a dense, [[Rock (geology)|rock]]y [[planetary core|core]] with a mass of up to twelve times the Earth's total mass.<ref>{{cite journal | author=T. Guillot, D. Gautier, W. B. Hubbard | title=New Constraints on the Composition of Jupiter from Galileo Measurements and Interior Models | journal=Icarus | year=1997 | volume=130 | pages=534-539 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997astro.ph..7210G }}</ref> The core region is surrounded by dense [[metallic hydrogen]], with further layers of [[phase (matter)|liquid]] hydrogen and [[gas]]eous hydrogen.

Because Jupiter is not a solid body, its upper atmosphere undergoes [[differential rotation]], an effect first noticed by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Giovanni Cassini]] ([[1690]]). The rotation of Jupiter's [[polar region|polar]] atmosphere is ~5 minutes longer than that of the [[equator]]ial atmosphere; three "systems" are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10º N to 10º S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by [[radio astronomy|radio astronomers]], and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's [[magnetosphere]]; its period is Jupiter's "official" rotation.<ref>Ian Ridpath, ''Norton's Star Atlas'', 19th ed. (Harlow: Addison Wesley Longman Ltd., 1998), p. 107.</ref>

===Cloud layers===
[[Image:PIA02863 - Jupiter surface motion animation.gif|left|thumb|250 px|This looping animation shows the movement of Jupiter's counter-rotating cloud bands. In this image, the planet's exterior is mapped onto a cylindrical projection.]]
Jupiter is wrapped by bands of clouds of different [[latitude]]s, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued ''zones'' and darker ''belts''. The interactions of these conflicting [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] patterns cause storms and [[turbulence]]. [[Wind speed]]s of 600 km/h are not uncommon.{{Fact|date=January 2007}}

The outer atmosphere of Jupiter consists of two decks of clouds; a thick, lower deck and a thin, clearer region. The coloration of the bands is caused by the altitude at which clouds become visible. The darker coloration of the belts is likely caused by upwellings of colorful compounds that mix with the warmer, lower deck of clouds. The zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.<ref name="worldbook" />

The only spacecraft to have descended into Jupiter's atmosphere and take scientific measurements is the ''[[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]]'' probe (see [[#Galileo mission|Galileo mission]]). It sent an atmospheric probe into Jupiter upon arrival in [[1995]], then itself entered Jupiter's atmosphere and burned up in [[2003]].

===The Great Red Spot===
{{main|Great Red Spot}} 
[[Image:Redspot.jpg|thumbnail|250px|The Great Red Spot as seen from Voyager 1 in 1979.]]
The '''Great Red Spot''' is a persistent [[anticyclone|anticyclonic]] [[storm]] on the [[planet]] [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]], 22° south of the equator, which has lasted at least 340 years. The storm is large enough to be visible through Earth-based [[telescope]]s. It was probably first observed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, who described it around 1665.<ref name="kyrala26">{{cite journal | last = Kyrala | first = A. | title=An explanation of the persistence of the Great Red SPOT of Jupiter | journal=Moon and the Planets | year=1982 | volume=26 | pages=105-107 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982M&P....26..105K }}</ref>

This dramatic view of Jupiter's Great Red Spot and its surroundings was obtained by [[Voyager 1]] on [[February 25]], [[1979]], when the spacecraft was 9.2 million km (5.7 million miles) from Jupiter. Cloud details as small as 160 km (100 miles) across can be seen here. The colorful, wavy cloud pattern to the left of the Red Spot is a region of extraordinarily complex and variable wave motion. To give a sense of Jupiter's scale, the white oval storm directly below the Great Red Spot is approximately the same diameter as Earth.

The [[oval]] object [[rotation|rotates]] [[counterclockwise]], with a [[periodicity|period]] of about 6 days.<ref>[http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/jupiter/redspot.html The Great Red Spot] csep10.phys.utk.edu. Retrieved [[2007-01-17]].</ref> The Great Red Spot's [[dimension]]s are 24&ndash;40,000 km × 12&ndash;14,000 km.

[[Image:Jupiter from Voyager 1.jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[False-color]] detail of Jupiter's atmosphere, imaged by ''[[Voyager 1]]'', showing the [[Great Red Spot]] and a passing white oval.]]
Storms such as this are not uncommon within the [[turbulent]] [[celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] of [[gas giant]]s. Jupiter also has white ovals and brown ovals, which are lesser unnamed storms. White ovals tend to consist of relatively [[heat|cool]] clouds within the upper atmosphere. Brown ovals are warmer and located within the "normal cloud layer". Such storms can last hours or [[century|centuries]].

Before the Voyager missions, astronomers were uncertain of the nature of Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Many believed it to be either a solid or a liquid feature on the planet's surface as this appears consistent with the observable turbulence patterns.<ref>[http://spacephysics.ucr.edu/index.php?content=v25/v4.html Grand Tour of the Outer Planets - Jupiter] spacephysics.ucr.edu. Retrieved [[2007-01-17]].</ref> However, even before Voyager proved that the feature was a storm, there was strong evidence that the spot cannot be associated with any deeper feature on the planet's surface, as it has been proven that the Spot rotates differentially with respect to the rest of the atmosphere, sometimes faster and sometimes more slowly, so that during its recorded history it has traveled several times around the planet with regard to any possible fixed rotational marker below it.

Recent examination of Jupiter's surface by a NASA research team using the Hubble telescope has shown that several smaller storms located near to the Giant Red Spot have, in the last twelve months, amalgamated, increased in intensity and changed colour from white to red.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/10/061013122425.htm Jupiter's Little Red Spot Growing Stronger] www.sciencedaily.com, [[2006-10-14]].

Further investigations using spectroscopy have been delayed due to the movement of Jupiter behind the Sun and it is yet to be verified if the phenomena is caused by increased wind speed, comparable to the 400 mph speeds in the larger anomaly, drawing similar materials from deeper in the atmosphere and exposing them to sunlight.

===Planetary rings===
[[Image:PIA01627 Ringe.jpg|thumb|right|The rings of Jupiter.]]
{{main|Rings of Jupiter}}
Jupiter has a faint [[planetary ring]] system composed of three main components: an inner [[torus]] of particles known as the [[halo]], a relatively bright main ring, and an outer "gossamer" ring.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Showalter | first =  M.A. | coauthors = J.A.

===Magnetosphere===
{{main|Jupiter's magnetosphere}}
Jupiter's broad magnetic field is 14 times as strong as the Earth's, ranging from 4.2 [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] at the equator to 10&ndash;14 gauss at the poles, making it the strongest in the solar system (with the exception of [[sunspot]]s.)<ref name="worldbook" /> This field is believed to be generated by [[eddy current]]s within the metallic hydrogen core. The field traps a sheet of [[plasma]] particles from the [[solar wind]], generating a highly energetic magnetosphere around the planet that extends outward to a radius of 150&ndash;200 times the radius of Jupiter. Electrons from this plasma sheet ionize the torus of [[sulfur dioxide]] generated by the [[tectonics|tectonic]] activity on the moon Io. Hydrogen particles from Jupiter's atmosphere are also trapped in the magnetosphere. Electrons within the magnetosphere generate a strong radio signature that produces bursts in the range of 0.6&ndash;30 [[hertz|GHz]].<ref>{{cite news | title=NASA's Hubble Space Telescope Finds "Blue Straggler" Stars in the Core of a Globular Cluster | publisher=The Astrophysics Spectator | date=November 24, 2004 | url=http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/planets/JupiterMagnetosphere.html | accessdate=2006-05-24 }}</ref>

==Exploration of Jupiter==
Since 1973 a number of automated spacecraft have visited Jupiter. Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in [[energy]], which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or [[delta-v]]. Reaching Jupiter
from Earth requires a delta-v of 9.2&nbsp;km/s,<ref name="delta-v">{{cite web | last = Wong | first = Al |date= [[May 28]], [[1998]] | url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/faqnav.html | title = Galileo FAQ - Navigation | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 2006-11-28 }}</ref> which is comparable to the 9.7&nbsp;km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hirata | first = Chris | url = http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html | title = Delta-V in the Solar System | publisher = California Institute of Technology | accessdate = 2006-11-28 }}</ref> Fortunately, [[Gravitational slingshot|gravity assists]] through planetary [[flyby]]s can be used to reduce the energy required to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration.<ref name="delta-v" />

Beginning in 1973, several spacecraft have performed planetary fly-by maneuvers that brought them within observation range of Jupiter. ''Pioneer 10'' obtained the first ever close up images of Jupiter and the [[Galilean moon]]s, studied its atmosphere, detected its magnetic field, observed its radiation belts and found that Jupiter is mainly liquid.<ref name="cosmology 101">{{cite web | last = Lasher | first = Lawrence |date= [[August 1]], [[2006]] | url = http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PNhome.html | title = Pioneer Project Home Page | publisher = NASA Space Projects Division | accessdate = 2006-11-28 }}</ref>
Six years later the ''Voyager'' missions vastly improved the understanding of the [[Galilean moon]]s and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also took the first close up images of the planet's atmosphere.<ref name="voyager">{{cite web |date= [[January 14]], [[2003]] | url = http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/jupiter.html | title = Jupiter | publisher = NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory | accessdate = 2006-11-28 }}</ref>

The next mission to encounter Jupiter, the ''Ulysses'' solar probe, performed a fly-by maneuver in order to attain a polar orbit around the Sun. During this pass the probe conducted studies on Jupiter's magnetosphere. However, since there are no cameras onboard the probe, no images were taken. A second fly-by six years later was at a much greater distance.<ref name="ulysses">{{cite web | author = K. Chan, E. S. Paredes,

In 2000, the ''Cassini'' probe, ''en route'' to [[Saturn]], flew by Jupiter and provided some of the highest-resolution images ever made of the planet. On [[December 19]], [[2000]], the ''Cassini'' spacecraft, captured a very low resolution image of the moon [[Himalia (moon)|Himalia]], but it was too distant to show any surface details.<ref>{{cite journal | author=C.

The ''[[New Horizons]]'' probe, en route to [[Pluto]], will flyby Jupiter for a gravity assist. Closest approach will be [[February 28]], [[2007]]. While at Jupiter, New Horizon's instruments will refine the orbits of Jupiter's inner moons, particularly [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]].

===Shoemaker-Levy comet===
{{main|Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9}}

During the period [[July 16]] to [[July 22]], [[1994]], over twenty fragments from the [[comet]] Shoemaker-Levy 9 hit Jupiter's southern hemisphere, providing the first direct observation of a collision between two solar system objects. Although not a probe from Earth, the impact did provide data on the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web | last = Baalke | first = Ron | url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/ | title = Comet Shoemaker-Levy Collision with Jupiter | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 2007-01-02 }}</ref> It is thought that due to Jupiter's large mass and location near the inner solar system it receives the most frequent comet impacts of the solar system's planets.{{Fact|date=January 2007}}

===Galileo mission===
[[Image:PIA04866_modest.jpg|thumb|left|Jupiter as seen by the space probe [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]]. This is the most detailed global color portrait of Jupiter ever assembled.]]
So far the only spacecraft to orbit Jupiter is the ''[[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]]'' orbiter, which went into orbit around Jupiter on [[December 7]], [[1995]]. It orbited the planet for over seven years, conducting multiple flybys of all of the Galilean moons and [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]]. The spacecraft also witnessed the impact of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] as it approached Jupiter in 1994, giving a unique vantage point for the event. However, while the information gained about the Jovian system from ''Galileo'' was extensive, its originally-designed capacity was limited by the failed deployment of its high-gain radio transmitting antenna.<ref name="galileo">{{cite web | last = McConnell | first = Shannon |date= [[April 14]], [[2003]] | url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ | title = Galileo: Journey to Jupiter | publisher = NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory | accessdate = 2006-11-28 }}</ref>

An atmospheric probe was released from the spacecraft in July, 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on [[December 7]]. It parachuted through 150&nbsp;km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6 minutes, before being crushed by the pressure to which it was subjected by that time (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153 <sup>o</sup>C). [http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/galileo_probe/htmls/probe_events.html] It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The ''Galileo'' orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on [[September 21]], [[2003]] at a speed of over 50&nbsp;km/s, in order to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and possibly contaminating [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].<ref name="galileo" />

===Future probes===
NASA is planning a mission to study Jupiter in detail from a [[polar orbit]]. Named ''[[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]]'', the spacecraft is planned to launch by 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://newfrontiers.nasa.gov/missions_juno.html | title = New Frontiers - Missions - Juno | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 2007-01-02 }}</ref>

Because of the possibility of a liquid ocean on Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], there has been great interest to study the icy moons in detail. A mission proposed by NASA was dedicated to study them. The [[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter|JIMO]] (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter) was expected to be launched sometime after 2012. However, the mission was deemed too ambitious and its funding was cancelled.<ref>{{cite news | title=White House scales back space plans | publisher=MSNBC | date=February 7, 2005 | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6928404/ | accessdate=2007-01-02 }}</ref>

==Natural satellites==
{{main|Jupiter's natural satellites}}

[[Image:Jupiter.moons2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Jupiter's 4 Galilean moons, in a composite image comparing their sizes and the size of Jupiter ([[Great Red Spot]] visible). From the top they are: [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Io (moon)|Io]].]]
Jupiter has at least 63 moons. For a complete listing of these moons, please see [[Jupiter's natural satellites]]. For a timeline of their discovery dates, see [[Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their natural satellites]].

The four large moons, known as the "[[Galilean moons]]", are [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]].

===Galilean moons===
The orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system, form a pattern known as a [[Laplace resonance]]; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the [[gravity|gravitational]] effects of the three moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes, since each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors at the same point in every orbit it makes.

[[image:JupiterandIo.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A picture of Jupiter and its moon Io taken by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]]. The black spot is Io's shadow.]]

The [[tidal force]] from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.<ref>{{cite journal | author= S. Musotto, F. Varadi, W. B. Moore, G. Schubert | title=Numerical simulations of the orbits of the Galilean satellites | journal=Icarus | year=2002 | volume=159 | pages=500-504 | url=http://geodyn.ess.ucla.edu/~musotto/GalSat.pdf | format=PDF }}</ref> This constant tug of war causes regular flexing of the three moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching the moons more strongly during the portion of their orbits that are closest to it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes when they're farther away. This flexing causes tidal heating of the three moons' cores. This is seen most dramatically in Io's extraordinary volcanic activity, and to a somewhat less dramatic extent in the geologically young surface of Europa indicating recent resurfacing.

===Classification of Jupiter's moons===

[[Image:Europa-moon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Europa (moon)|Europa]], one of Jupiter's many [[natural satellite|moons]].]]
Before the discoveries of the Voyager missions, Jupiter's moons were arranged neatly into four groups of four. Since then, the large number of new small outer moons has complicated this picture. There are now thought to be six main groups, although some are more distinct than others. A basic division is between the eight inner regular moons with nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator, which are believed to have formed with Jupiter, and an unknown number of small irregular moons, with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are believed to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. It is thought that the groups of outer moons may each have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.<ref>{{cite book|author=D. C. Jewitt, S. Sheppard, C.

==Life on Jupiter==
It is considered highly unlikely that there is any Earth-like [[extraterrestrial life|life]] on Jupiter, as there is little water in the atmosphere and any possible solid surface deep within Jupiter would be under extraordinary pressures. However, in [[1976]], before the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] missions, [[Carl Sagan]] hypothesized (with [[Edwin Ernest Salpeter]]) that [[ammonia]]-based life could evolve in Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Sagan and Salpeter based this hypothesis on the ecology of terrestrial seas which have simple [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[plankton]] at the top level, [[fish]] at lower levels feeding on these creatures, and marine [[predator]]s which hunt the fish. The Jovian equivalents Sagan and Salpeter hypothesized were "sinkers", "floaters", and "hunters". The "sinkers" would be plankton-like organisms which fall through the atmosphere, existing just long enough that they can reproduce in the time they are kept afloat by convection.  The "floaters" would be giant bags of gas functioning along the lines of hot air balloons, using their own metabolism (feeding off sunlight and free molecules) to keep their gas warm. The "hunters" would be almost [[squid]]-like creatures, using jets of gas to propel themselves into "floaters" and consume them.<!---What about the "sinkers"?---><ref>{{cite web

==Trojan asteroids==
[[Image:Asteroid Belt.jpg|right|thumb|This diagram shows the Trojan Asteroids in Jupiter's orbit, as well as the main [[asteroid belt]].]]
In addition to its moons, Jupiter's gravitational field controls numerous [[asteroid]]s which have settled into the regions of the [[Lagrangian point]]s preceding and following Jupiter in its orbit around the sun. These are known as the [[Trojan asteroid]]s, and are divided into [[List of Trojan asteroids (Greek camp)|Greek]] and [[List of Trojan asteroids (Trojan camp)|Trojan]] "camps" to commemorate the ''[[Iliad]]''. The first of these, [[588 Achilles]], was discovered by [[Max Wolf]] in [[1906]]; since then hundreds more have been discovered. The largest is [[624 Hektor]].
