"'''The Bus Uncle'''" is a [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] [[video clip]] of a quarrel between two men aboard a [[Buses in Hong Kong|bus]] in [[Hong Kong]] on [[April 27]] [[2006]]. While the older man (Chan), who came to be nicknamed the Bus Uncle, scolded the man seated behind him (Ho), a nearby passenger used his [[camera phone]] to record the entire incident to provide evidence for the police in the event of a fight. The resulting six-minute video<ref name="original-youtube">{{cite web

  | date=[[2006-05-30]] }}</ref> It began when a young bespectacled male passenger tapped the shoulder of a middle-aged man in front of him, asking the man to lower his voice while on his mobile phone. The man in front turned around and reacted strongly<ref name="AP" /> with a rant<ref name="CNNrp" /> about being unnecessarily provoked under stress:

{{cquote2 | Chan: Hey, don't call me "boss". For the sake of fairness, we don't know each other. Why did you have to do that? (faster tone) Why did you have to do that? Look, everyone in society suffers from stress. Now that you have done something very unfair, should I have a word with you?<ref name="original-youtube"/>}}

The younger man, who seldom talked back, expressed a desire to end the discussion. However, the middle-aged man insisted that the matter was not settled and requested an apology from him:

{{cquote2|''(Catchphrases in bold)''<br/>Ho: The matter has been settled. It's as simple as that.<br/>Chan: It's not settled.<br/>Ho: It's settled.<br/>Chan: (raises voice) It's not settled!<br/>Ho: It's settled.<br/>Chan: (yelling very loudly) '''It's not settled!!!''' We both have to settle this right now! To put it simply, when you talked on the phone, did I interrupt you? Why did you interrupt me?<br/>Ho: You were talking too loudly.<br/>Chan: Look, when you were talking on the phone, did I say you were talking too loudly and disturbing other people? We're both talking on our phones. When people talk on the phone, there will be noise, but you, your voice... our voices are the same. Yes, and did I interrupt you for that? (Pause) What do you say?<br/>(Silence)<br/>Chan: (yelling) You're really asking for a fight! Fuck your mother! Are you asking for a fight? '''I am stressed, you are stressed,''' why did you provoke me?<br/>Ho: (very softly) I didn't mean to...<br/>Chan: What do you mean "You didn't mean to."? Apologise now!<ref name="original-youtube"/>}}

The younger man apologised, reluctantly shook hands, and also warned the older man regarding the use of [[mother insult]]s.<ref name="WSJ" /> This last warning resulted in more profanities from the older man:<ref name="AP" />

{{cquote2|Chan: If it's been settled, why did you warn me? I'm heavily stressed. I wanted to shake hands. You settle… you said that the matter is settled and now you warn me? What's the point, pal? This is pointless for both of us, is that right? Now that we've shaken hands…<br/>Ho: Let me tell you, this matter is between the two of us. Don't drag others into it.<br/>Chan: If you have to drag people into it, you do so. If you enjoy fucking, you fuck; if I enjoy fucking, I fuck. Fucking other people is harmless. Fuck, fuck and fuck! Should I punch you twice instead? Right? When it's been settled, it's settled. Don't warn me. Why did you warn me? I'm not half scared even if you do! I'm extremely stressed, don't you know that? Now, do you understand? You shouldn't warn me! It's settled, you get the point? If you warn me, it means the matter isn't settled! We should forget about this, having shaken hands. OK?<br/>Ho: All right, I don't want to talk to you any more.<ref name="original-youtube"/>}}

The video ends with the older man receiving a phone call.<ref name="cry" />

===Title===
The "Bus Uncle" title for the video was coined by members of an Internet forum in reference to the older man in the video. In [[Hong Kong culture]], it is common to refer to an older man as "Uncle" (阿叔), hence the [[English language|English]] translation "The Bus Uncle". The name is also a reference to [[Football (soccer)|football]] commentator [[Lam Sheung Yee]] (林尚義), who is nicknamed "Uncle" and whose voice resembles that of the older man. Lam's name appears as part of the title of the original video.<ref name="original-youtube"/> Contrary to reports in Western media,<ref name="WP">{{cite news

==People involved==
===Bus Uncle===
As the video became well-known, reporters looked for the "Bus Uncle" near the end of the 68X bus route. Eventually, they found the 51-year-old<ref name="cry" /> restaurant worker who resides in [[Yuen Long]], Roger Chan Yuet Tung ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 陳乙東).<ref name ="beaten">{{cite news

===Young man===
The young man scolded in the video is Elvis Ho Yui Hei ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 何銳熙), a 23-year-old<ref name="cry" /> property agent of his family's property management company. On [[May 23]] [[2006]], Ho (previously misidentified as "Alvin" or "Elvin"<ref>{{cite web

In a later interview with the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', Ho said he often takes long bus rides home and frequently asked passengers to lower their voices so he could nap. Despite being threatened, Ho said he forgave "Bus Uncle" and sympathised with whatever stress the older man was suffering.<ref name=SCMP1/> His patience throughout the ordeal was inspired by [[tai chi chuan]], a Chinese martial art characterised by slow movements, specialised breathing techniques and emotional internalisation.<ref name="WSJ" />

===Cameraman===
The person who recorded the video clip was identified as Jon Fong Wing Hang ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 方穎恆), a 21-year-old accountant and part-time psychology student.<ref name="WP" /> After he called a radio station on [[May 25]] [[2006]], Fong, who recorded the incident with a [[Sony Ericsson]] [[Sony Ericsson W800|W800e]] mobile phone, claimed there was a second video yet to be posted online in which Ho fought back by making fun of "Bus Uncle" with a friend on the phone. Fong stated that the reason for the recording was to provide evidence to the police in case "Bus Uncle" became physically violent.<ref>{{cite news

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Bus Uncle D.JPG|thumb|Elvis Ho expels Roger Chan and the press, rejecting the press-arranged meeting and demanding all reporters to hand over their [[business cards]].]]
Chan stated that when Ho tapped him on the shoulder, he was under stress from an argument with his girlfriend and was calling the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]] suicide-prevention hotline for support. However, Ho claimed that Chan was just chatting with friends.<ref>{{cite news|title=巴士阿叔痛哭　「我想自殺」 (Bus Uncle sobs, "I want to commit suicide!")|work=[[Next Magazine]]|url = http://next.atnext.com/template/next/sec_main.cfm?iss_id=847&sec_id=1000853|id=Issue No. 847|date=[[2006-05-31]]|accessdate=2007-04-20|language=[[Traditional Chinese]]}}</ref> ''[[Sing Tao Daily]]'' reported that Chan visited Ho's office on [[May 31]], [[2006]] in [[Mong Kok]] to apologise for the dispute and to initiate a business proposal for the duo to hold a "Bus Uncle Rave Party".

<!-- Temporary comment out
On [[June 7]], [[2006]], Chan, who had been hired by a restaurant as a Public Relations officer in the Steak Expert restaurant chain, was physically assaulted on the job in front of horrified diners by three unidentified masked men who then fled the scene.<ref name ="beaten"/> He sustained severe injuries to his eyes and face and was admitted to the emergency department for treatment. The restaurant owner, Mr. Lee, then faced pressure from his wife and daughter to fire Chan due to magazine coverage of Chan's exploits in a [[Shenzhen]] karaoke [[hostess bar]]. Lee's initial refusal led to his wife's suicide attempt through drug overdose on [[June 11]] in order to force the issue. Having learnt of the incident, Chan resigned, saying he did not want Lee's family to be unhappy.<ref>{{cite news|title=「扒后」林珍奇仰藥逼炒巴士阿叔 (The "Steak Queen" attempts suicide through drug overdose to force the dismissal of the Bus Uncle)|work=[[Wen Wei Po]]|url=http://www.wenweipo.com/news.phtml?news_id=HK0606120009&loc=LU&cat=583BS&no_combo=1|accessdate=2007-04-21| language = [[Traditional Chinese]]}}</ref>

In the advertisement, a passenger sitting behind Lam Sheung Yee (played by Lam Man Chung) questions whether Lam Sheung Yee feels pressured for his responsibilities in the upcoming World Cup, which would be his last TV appearance before retirement. Turning around, Lam replies that there is no pressure and emphasises the issue (i.e. the viewers' demand for World Cup coverage) has been resolved.

===Closer look at life in Hong Kong===
Although many found the video humorous and entertaining, others warned that it hinted at a more alarming and sinister prognosis of life in stress-filled Hong Kong, particularly inside buses, nicknamed "flying cars of death"<ref name="WSJ" /> and other overcrowded areas. The fact that Chan was runner-up "Person of the Year" announced by [[Radio Television Hong Kong]] indicated that it might have struck a chord with the general population.<ref name="Person of the Year">{{cite news

[[To Kit]], a well-known columnist and broadcaster, commented about the incident on Commercial Radio. He described Chan's behavior as "noise raping" and said that the incident was a manifestation of underlying social tension as well as the mindset of a common "Hongkonger." He criticised Ho's speechlessness as being too weak, likewise a stereotype of present-day Hong Kong youth. In addition, he noted that the incident implied that harmony in the neighbourhood was somehow upset.<ref>{{cite episode

Lee Sing, director of the Hong Kong Mood Disorders Centre at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], warned that Hong Kong's high-stress working environments are spawning a city-full of "Bus Uncles." Lee estimated that one of every 50 grumpy Hong Kongers suffers from [[intermittent explosive disorder]],<ref name="CNNrp" /> turning one into a "ticking time bomb" of rage and violence.<ref name="explode">{{cite news

Journalism professor and internet expert Anthony Fung Ying-him also attributed the popularity of the low-resolution video of a "trivial event" to the emotional climate of the city.<ref name="explode" /> While other viral videos are favoured by specific demographics, this one spread widely due to its universal<ref name="alongfor" /> expression of "the true feelings of ordinary people."<ref name="CNNrp" />

On the other hand, Ho Kwok Leung, an applied social science lecturer at the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]], held that attention surrounding the video reflected the boring lives of Hong Kong people. With few interesting topics to discuss, they savour the pleasure of spreading information to a vast audience and the creation of [[Internet meme]]s. Furthermore, the banning of the use of some video catchphrases in certain schools made the incident more appealing. This lifestyle, according to Leung, is fertile ground for the cultivation of a "video clip culture".<ref>{{cite news

===Civic awareness concerns===
[[Image:Bus No Phone.jpg|thumb|right|Bus passengers are advised to lower their voices while talking on their mobile phones in Hong Kong.]]
[[Ah Nong]] (阿濃), a popular literary figure and artist in Hong Kong, believed that the incident highlighted the apathy of the common Hong Kong people. He emphasised that during the heated exchange between Chan and Ho, not a single bystander came to Ho's aid. He recalled an incident a few years back where he confronted a man smoking on the lower deck of a bus and was scolded for the rest of the journey. He said it was useless to complain to the bus driver who would not bother to waste his time, let alone the other passengers. Ah Nong argued that in such a society, a person can be accused of wrongdoing despite good intentions.<ref>{{cite news

Apple Tse Ho Yi, minister of the Hong Kong Christian Service, carried out a survey of 506 students over the age of 12 about the Bus Uncle incident and civic awareness in general. Of the respondents who claim they regularly encountered people speaking loudly on the phone on buses, only 47 percent said they would intervene by talking to the phone user or alerting the driver. Reasons for inaction include fear, apathy and inability to solve the problem. On civic awareness, the majority of the respondents did not consider chatting loudly on the phone to be wrong. Tse concluded that the current generation of Hong Kong young people have poor civic awareness, and it is natural that disputes often occur due to inconsideration.<ref name="survey">{{cite news

Ng Fung Sheung, a social science lecturer of the [[City University of Hong Kong]], explained that Hong Kong people tend to chat loudly in public places. She attributed this phenomenon to the television screens found in many vehicles and trains, which broadcast programmes at high volumes. She suggested that the government should provide better civic education for the public to make them more considerate of others. When it comes to schools which banned the usage of catch phrases like "I'm stressed!" Ng stated that teachers must be able to distinguish whether the students really face pressure or are simply following the trend, and provide guidance if necessary.<ref name = "Problem"/>

===Criticism of Hong Kong media ethics===
[[Image:HK Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong newspapers have been criticised for their sensationalist techniques.]]
Some denied that any social insight could be gleaned from the video clip, arguing that the frenzy was artificially created by sensationalist newspapers in order to boost circulation and profits. Clement So York-kee, Director of the [[Journalism school|School of Journalism]] at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], warned that methods to uncover the incident between Chan and Ho "did not seem to … [involve the] traditional practice of news reporting."<ref name=alongfor>{{cite news

In late May 2006, a group of journalists and photographers initiated and followed Chan's second meeting with Ho. After Ho's refusal, they brought Bus Uncle to a dinner and karaoke session.<ref name="MM" /> Although the session was widely reported, many believed it was artificially created news and unworthy of front-page attention.<ref>{{cite news

''[[Ta Kung Pao]]'' stated that the Bus Uncle incident tested the professionalism of the Hong Kong mass media, its editorial noting that Chan sought remuneration for interviews and made many extraordinary claims about himself which were published without verification. The editorial concluded by advising journalists not to fabricate news, but instead to emphasise the verifiability of stories and consider carefully whether an incident is newsworthy.<ref>{{cite news

Others held that the frenzy was not the product of a media conspiracy, but rather a reflection of the public's curiosity and Hong Kong's competitive consumer-driven media market.<ref name=alongfor/> The situation also allowed [[camera phone]] marketers to highlight the potential comedic value and draw attention away from privacy concerns.<ref name="MM">{{cite news
