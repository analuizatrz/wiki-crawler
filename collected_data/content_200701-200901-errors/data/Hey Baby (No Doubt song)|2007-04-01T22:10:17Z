The [[music video]] featured the band touring on their bus, and then later entertaining at a club. There are also intercuts with [[Gwen Stefani]] and the guys dancing goofily against a blue background, Gwen and drummer [[Adrian Young]] shouting "hey baby!" while the words are "spat" out of them, and finally the band traveling through a galaxy of floating words, mostly "hey baby", "rock steady", and "no doubt". The video won the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]] in 2002.<ref> In one scene, which was censored in some edits, the band's drummer Adrian Young went on a trapeze in the nude for a bet.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2223890.stm "Eminem scoops MTV video awards"].
