'''''The Battle of Gettysburg''''', also known as the '''Gettysburg Cyclorama''', is a [[cyclorama]] painting by the French artist [[Paul Philippoteaux]] depicting "[[Pickett's Charge]]," the climactic [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] attack on the [[Union Army|Union]] forces during the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] on [[July 3]], [[1863]]. Completed and first exhibited in 1883, it is one of the last surviving cycloramas in the United States.

The painting was done in four versions. Until November 2005, the second of these versions, originally exhibited in [[Boston]], was on display at the [[Gettysburg National Military Park]]. It was removed for restoration work, which is scheduled to be complete by late 2007. The first version, exhibited in [[Chicago]], was lost for some time. It was rediscovered in 1965 and purchased by a group of North Carolina investors in 2007 for an undisclosed amount. The third version (exhibited in [[Philadelphia]]) was known to have been destroyed, and location of the fourth version (exhibited in [[Brooklyn]]) is unknown.

==Description==

[[Image:Cyclorama.jpg|thumb|Large section of the '''Gettysburg Cyclorama''' depicting Pickett's Charge up Cemetery Ridge.]]
The painting is the work of French artist Paul Dominique Philippoteaux. It depicts "Pickett's Charge", the failed infantry assault that was the climax of the Battle of Gettysburg. The painting is a ''cyclorama'', a type of 360° cylindrical painting. The intended effect is to immerse the viewer in the scene being depicted, often with the addition of foreground models and life-sized replicas to enhance the illusion. Among the sites documented in the painting are [[Cemetery Ridge]], the Angle, and the "[[High-water mark of the Confederacy]]".<ref name=NPS>{{cite web | last = Heiser | first = John | title = The Gettysburg Cyclorama | work = [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] | publisher = National Park Service | date = 2005 | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/gett/gettcyclo.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-03}}</ref> The completed original painting was 22 feet high and 279 feet in circumference.<ref name=nando/> The version that hangs in Gettysburg, a recreation of the original, is 27 feet high and 359 feet in circumference,<ref name=NPS/> although that version has lost some of its size due to the ravages of time.

Philippoteaux was born in [[Paris]] in 1846, a son of the celebrated French artist Henri Emmanuel Felix Philippoteaux. He became interested in cycloramas and in collaboration with his father created ''The Defence of the Fort d'Issy'' in 1871. Other successful works included ''Taking of Plevna'' (Turko-Russian War), the ''Passage of the Balkans'', ''The Belgian Revolution of 1830'', ''Attack in the Park'', ''The Battle of Kars'', ''The Battle of Tel-el-Kebir'', and the ''Derniere Sortie''.<ref name=Thomas> {{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Dean S. | title = The Gettysburg Cyclorama: A Portrayal of the High Tide of the Confederacy | publisher = Thomas Publications | date = 1989| location = Gettysburg, Pennsylvania | pages = 17-19 | isbn = 0-939631-14-8 }}</ref> He was commissioned by a group of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] investors in 1879 to create the work. He spent several weeks in April 1882 at the site of the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] to sketch and photograph the scene, and extensively researched the battle and its events over several months. Local photographer William H. Tipton created a series of panoramic photographs shot from a wooden tower erected along present-day Hancock Avenue. The photos, pasted together, formed the basis of the composition. Philippoteaux also interviewed several survivors of the battle, including Union generals [[Winfield S. Hancock]], [[Abner Doubleday]], [[Oliver O. Howard]], and [[Alexander S. Webb]], and based his work partly on their recollections.<ref name=Thomas/>

Philippoteaux enlisted a team of five assistants, including his father until his death, to create the final work.<ref name=Thomas/> It took over a year and a half to complete.<ref name=NPS/> The finished painting was nearly 100 yards long and weighed six tons.<ref name=nando>{{cite web | last = Jarvis | first = Craig | title = Triangle trio buys massive painting | work = [[The News & Observer]] (Raleigh, NC) | publisher = The News and Observer Publishing Company | date = May 2, 2007 | url = http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/569912.html | accessdate = 2007-05-03}}</ref> When completed for display, the full work included not just the painting, but numerous artifacts and sculptures, including stone walls, trees, and fences.<ref name=NPS/> The effect of the painting has been likened to the nineteenth century equivalent of an [[IMAX]] theater.<ref name=nando/>

==Exhibition and reception==

The work opened to the public in Chicago on [[October 22]], [[1883]], to critical acclaim.<ref name=Thomas/> General [[John Gibbon]], one of the commanders of the Union forces who repelled Pickett's Charge, was among the veterans of the battle who gave it favorable reviews.<ref name=NPS/> So realistic was the painting that many veterans of the war were reported to have wept upon seeing it.<ref name=rest/> 

The Chicago exhibition was so successful that businessman Charles L. Willoughby commissioned a second version, which opened in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on [[December 22]], [[1884]]. From its opening until 1892, approximately 200,000 people viewed the painting.<ref name=Thomas/> The Boston version was housed in a specially designed building on [[Tremont Street]], and was the site of popular public lectures on the battle.<ref name=NPS/> Two additional copies of the cyclorama were made: the third was exhibited in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, beginning in February 1886 and a fourth in Brooklyn, New York, in October 1886.<ref name=Thomas/>

In 1891, the Boston cyclorama was exchanged temporarily with the cyclorama ''Crucifixion of Christ''<ref>Also one of Philippoteaux's works, ''Crucifixion'' is displayed at [[Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, Quebec]].</ref> in Philadelphia. When it returned in 1892, it was stored in a 50-foot crate behind the exhibition hall, where it was subjected to damage from weather, vandals removing boards from the crate, and two fires. It was eventually purchased in its deteriorated state by Albert J. Hahne of [[Newark, New Jersey]], in 1910. Hahne displayed sections of the cyclorama in his department store in Newark beginning in 1911, and sections were also shown in government buildings in [[New York City]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] In the Baltimore exhibition, [[George E. Pickett]]'s widow, "Sallie" Pickett, lectured on her husband's experiences and found herself very moved by the experience.<ref name=Thomas/>

On [[September 3]], [[1912]], ground was broken for a new cyclorama building on Baltimore Street in Gettysburg, on Cemetery Hill (on the site of the present day [[Holiday Inn]]), near the entrance to the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery | Soldiers' National Cemetery]]. It opened to the public in 1913, in time for the 50th anniversary of the battle, once again displayed as a full circular painting, rather than in sections. The unheated, leaky brick building took a further toll on the condition of the painting. The cyclorama was purchased by the [[National Park Service]] in 1942, and moved to a site on Ziegler's Grove near the new Visitor's Center in 1961, after a second round of restoration.<ref name=Thomas/> The exhibition remained open to the public until 2005, when it was closed for a third restoration.<ref name=NPS/> Part of this restoration includes the demolition of the old Cyclorama building and the construction of a new facility to house the painting, a source of some controversy among history and architecture buffs, who oppose the destruction of the [[modernism|modernist]] structure designed by architect [[Richard Neutra]].<ref>{{cite web | title = The Latest: Recent Past Preservation Network Sues National Park Service to Prevent Demolition of Historic Building at Gettysburg | work = CYCLORAMA: Richard Neutra's 1961 Lincoln Memorial at Gettysburg | publisher = Mission66.com | url=http://www.mission66.com/cyclorama/ | accessdate = 2007-05-08}}</ref>

The original Chicago work went on a tour of eight cities before returning to Chicago in 1933. It was abandoned in a warehouse until it was discovered by [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], art collector Joseph Wallace King in 1965. The painting has remained rolled up since 1933, though it was donated by King to [[Wake Forest University]] upon his death in 1996. The university sold the painting in 2007 to an anonymous group of [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], investors. The painting has been appraised at a value of US$5.5 million, but the value of the sale remains unknown.<ref name=nando2> {{cite web | last = Jarvis | first = Craig | title = What price art? | work = [[The News & Observer]] (Raleigh, NC) | publisher = The News and Observer Publishing Company | date = May 6, 2007 | url = http://www.newsobserver.com/308/story/571199.html | accessdate = 2007-05-08}}</ref> The group intends to resell the painting to a new buyer who will commit to restoring the work and building a suitable structure to house it.<ref name=nando/>
