'''USS ''Illinois'' (BB-65)''' was to be the fifth {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}} constructed for the [[United States Navy]]; she was the fourth ship to be [[ship naming and launching|named]] in honor of [[Illinois|the 21st state]]. Among the {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}}s, ''Illinois'' is notable for being one of the two uncompleted battleships, and for being the only member of the class not considered for a rebuild of any kind.

Hull BB-65 was originally to be the first ship of the {{sclass|Montana|battleship}}s, but changes during the [[Second World War]] resulted in her being reordered as an {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}} midway through the war. This allowed her to gain eight knots in speed, the ability to transit the locks of the [[Panama Canal]], and to increase the number of anti-aircraft guns. The cost was the loss of her additional armor and a reduction in the heavier armaments that were to have been added to BB-65 during her time on the drawing board as USS ''Montana''. 

Like her sister ship {{USS|Kentucky|BB-66}}, ''Illinois'' was still under construction at the end of World War II. Her construction was canceled in August 1945, but her hull remained until 1958 when it was broken up. Because ''Illinois'' was only 22% complete at the time she was not considered for any significant rebuild programs, while several proposals were floated to complete her sister ship ''Kentucky'' as a guided missile battleship.

BB-65 began life in mid-1930s as the USS ''Montana'', the lead ship of her class of dreadnought battleships. She would have fielded three more 16-in guns than those mounted aboard the ''Iowa''-class, a more powerful secondary battery of [[5"/54 caliber Mark 45 gun|5”/54 caliber DP mounts]],<ref name="navwep2">{{cite web

The increase in ''Montana’s'' firepower and armor came at the expense of her speed and her [[Panamax]] capabilities, but the latter issue was to be resolved through the construction of a third, much wider set of locks at the [[Panama Canal]],  which would have enabled ''Montana'' to transit between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans without the need to move around the tip of South America.<ref name="friedman">{{Citation | last = Friedman | first = Norman | publication-date =1985 | title =U.S. Battleships: An Illustrated Design History | publication-place =Annapolis, Maryland | publisher =United States Naval Institute | isbn =0-87921-715-1}}</ref>  As USS ''Montana,'' BB-65 would have the only battleship class [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] by the U.S. to have come close to equaling the [[Empire of Japan]]'s {{sclass|Yamato|battleship}}s on the basis of armor, armament, and tonnage.<ref name="gs1">{{cite web

By 1942 the United States Navy shifted its building focus from battleships to [[aircraft carrier]]s after the successes of carrier combat in both the [[Battle of Coral Sea]] and to a greater extent the [[Battle of Midway]]. As a result the construction of the U.S. fleet of {{sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier}}s had been given the highest priority for completion in the U.S. [[shipyard]]s.<ref name="magazine"/> The ''Essex''-class carriers were proving vital to the war effort by allowing the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to gain and maintain [[air supremacy]] in the [[Pacific Theatre of World War II]], and were rapidly becoming the principle striking arm of the United States in the ongoing effort to defeat the Empire of Japan.<ref name="discovery">{{cite episode | title = The 10 Greatest Fighting Ships in Military History | network = The Discovery Channel}}Web page: [http://military.discovery.com/convergence/topten/warships/slideshow/slideshow_10.html Top Ten Fighting Ships] Retrieved [[23 April]] [[2007]].</ref> It was for this reason that the United States accepted certain shortcomings in the armor for their {{sclass|North Carolina|battleship}}s, [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota''-class battleships]], and {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}}s in favor of their additional speed, which enabled these battleship classes to steam at a comparable speed with the ''Essex''-class and provide the carriers with the maximum amount of anti-aircraft protection.<ref name="discovery"/>

==Development==
When BB-65 was redesignated an {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}}, she was assigned the name ''Illinois'' and reconfigured to adhere to the "[[fast battleship]]" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]].<ref name="The Battleships II">{{cite book  | last =Johnston, Ian & McAuley, Rob  | title =The Battleships | publisher =Channel 4 Books (an imprint of Pan Macmillian, LTD) | date =2002 | location =London | pages =pages 108–123 | url = http://www.panmacmillan.com/ | id =ISBN 0752261886}}</ref><ref> This was not the first time that changes to the ''Iowa'' class had been proposed: at the time the battleships were cleared for construction some policymakers were not sold on the U.S. need for more battleships, and proposed turning the ''Iowa''-class ships into aircraft carriers by retaining the hull design, but switching their decks to carry and handle aircraft (This had already been done on the battlecruisers {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}). The proposal was countered by [[Admiral]] [[Ernest King]], the Chief of Naval Operations. {{cite web | title =BB-61 Iowa-class Aviation Conversion | url =http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/bb-61-av.htm | accessdate =2007-05-19}}</ref> She would now be the fifth of the six authorized ships of the {{sclass|Iowa|battleship|4}} of battleships.<ref name="Illinois">{{cite web

==Scrapping==

While the ship herself was never completed, the ship's bell was cast, and it currently resides at [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]; it reads ''USS Illinois 1946''. Although the University of Illinois records are unclear as to whether the bell was donated to the University in general or the Naval [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (NROTC) at the University specifically, the bell has found a new home with the [[Fighting Illini]] football team, and is traditionally rung by NROTC members in a cumulative manner when the football team scores a touchdown or goal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oc.uiuc.edu/OnOurWatch/infocus/102007.html |title=Illinois On Our Watch |accessdate=2007-11-14 |author=Chancellor Richard Herman |publisher=Public Affairs for the Office of the Chancellor and the University of Illinois Alumni Association }}</ref>
