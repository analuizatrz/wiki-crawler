==Overview==
Since 1926, the magnificent [http://www.5thavenue.org/ 5th Avenue Theatre], located in [[Seattle]], [[Washington]], in the [[United States]], has captivated audiences with music, drama and laughter. In the early days, people eagerly lined up for first-class vaudeville shows, featuring top entertainers. The theatre later transformed itself into a popular movie palace. The 5th fell on hard times in the late 70’s—but fortunately, was saved from a wrecking ball by a visionary group of businesses and community leaders. Following a spectacular $2.6-million renovation, the theatre re-opened in 1980, more beautiful than ever.

==Quick facts==

* It has 2,115 seats

* The 5th brings approximately 150 live [[musical theater]] performances to the stage each year 

* Annually, it attracts over 200,000 patrons from the [[Pacific Northwest]], across the U.S., and around the world
 
* It's the largest theatre employer in the [[Puget Sound]] region, annually employing up to 600 actors, musicians, directors, choreographers, designers, technicians, stage hands, box office staff, and administrators 

* During each performance, 30 to 50 people are working behind the scenes 

* The 5th Avenue's education and outreach programs serve over 55,000 students, professional performers, and audiences each year

==History==

After 11 months of construction, The 5th celebrated its grand opening on September 24, 1926 and lived up to its promise as a magnificent showplace. Under the guidance of architect ''Robert C. Reamer'' and ''Gustav F. Liljestrom'', of the ''S. & G. Gump Company of San Francisco'', a firm famous for its hotel and theatre interiors. The ornate interior was modeled after three of Imperial China’s architectural achievements: the [[Forbidden City]], the Temple of Heavenly Peace, and [[the Summer Palace]]. The theatre was also considered a technical marvel at the time, thanks to its state-of-the-art sound, lighting and ventilation systems. 

The attention to detail is incredible, from the intricate organ grilles graced by Ho-ho birds to the coffered ceilings and the balcony walls covered with orange blossoms, chrysanthemums and lotus flowers.

One of the most stunning features is the auditorium’s center dome, a replica of the one from the ''palace’s throne room'' (only twice the size). The “Pearl of Perfection” chandelier is held in the teeth of a great coiling dragon, which has five toes—each toe representing an evil spirit that must be vanquished. The elaborate proscenium arch that frames the stage features a myriad of Chinese design motifs, including bas-reliefs of the ''Forbidden City'' and the ''Summer Palace''. The theatre’s constant residents are a pair of Fu Dogs, which have traditionally stood guard in front of China’s imperial palaces.

Following the grand opening, The 5th served as a venue for [[vaudeville]], then operated as a movie palace until the 1970s. Facing severe financial difficulties, The 5th was forced to close its doors in 1978 along with neighboring theatres the ''Metropolitan'' and the ''Orpheum''. Possibilities for the site included a Chinese restaurant, a triplex movie theatre, an office building, and a shopping center.

== Restoration ==

43 business leaders banded together in 1979 and underwrote a $2.6 million loan to save this cultural treasure.

Several changes were made during the painstaking renovation: the orchestra pit and auditorium seating were rebuilt, the dressing rooms moved, and the technical systems updated. However, the furniture, fixtures and signage are original. Even the paint was carefully restored to its original luster. 

June 16, 1980 marked the theatre’s rebirth and a new chapter in Seattle’s arts community. Now a historic landmark, The 5th continues to thrive with the assistance of many generous donors and volunteers

== Post-1980 history ==

Following the renovation, '''The 5th Avenue''' has become one of Seattle's most established theatres. In 1989, The 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company was established as a resident non-profit theatre company. Since 1980, The 5th Avenue Theatre has produced or presented more than 3,000 performances of nearly 100 productions, attended by over 5.5 million people. Today, The 5th Avenue Theatre proudly produces top-quality musical revivals, premieres of bound-for-Broadway shows, and present touring Broadway musicals. They also host a variety of special events, and offer a number of education and outreach programs to school-age children and adults
