The '''effects of [[Hurricane Isabel]] in New Jersey''' were overall moderate, limited to fallen trees, two deaths, and $50 million in damage (2003&nbsp;USD, $55&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD). Hurricane Isabel formed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[September 6]] in the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165&nbsp;mph (265&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 11]]. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 18]]. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western [[Pennsylvania]] the next day. Several days before Isabel made landfall, there existed uncertainty in where the hurricane would strike. At least one computer model predicted a landfall on [[New Jersey]], and as a result services across the state thoroughly prepared for the hurricane.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven & Hugh Cobb|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003isabel.shtml?}}</ref>

Isabel passed 215&nbsp;miles (350&nbsp;km) southwest of the state, though its large wind core produced tropical storm force winds across much of the state. The winds downed hundreds of trees and power lines, leaving hundreds of thousands without power. A falling tree killed one person. Hurricane Isabel produced rough waves and a moderate storm surge along the coastline. One person was killed from the rough waves, and at least 50 locations along the [[Jersey shore]] reported beach erosion from the hurricane.

44 hours before Hurricane Isabel made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]], the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm watch]] for the coastline from [[Little Egg Harbor|Little Egg Inlet]] southward into the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]]. A day later, the watch was extended northward to [[Sandy Hook, New Jersey|Sandy Hook]]. When Isabel was 26 hours from making landfall, the watches were changed to tropical storm warnings, and 10 hours before it struck land the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for the remainder of the New Jersey coastline.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven & Hugh Cobb|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003isabel.shtml?}}</ref> The National Hurricane Center also briefly issued a hurricane watch for the New Jersey coastline.<ref name="assessment">{{cite web|author=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|year=2004|title=Hurricane Isabel Service Assessment|accessdate=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/assessments/pdfs/isabel.pdf}}</ref> While over the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] as a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5 hurricane]], forecasters predicted Isabel would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 170&nbsp;miles (275&nbsp;km) south of Cape May as a 115&nbsp;mph (185 km/h) major hurricane.<ref name="lawrence32">{{cite web|author=Lawrence|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Discussion Thirty-Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al132003.discus.032.shtml?}}</ref> By four days before the hurricane struck land, at least one [[Global climate model|computer model]] predicted Isabel would strike New Jersey.<ref name="avila33">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Discussion Thirty-Three|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al132003.discus.033.shtml?}}</ref>

==Impact==
[[Image:Hurricane Isabel- Waves.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Waves and Beach erosion during [[Hurricane Isabel]]]]
Isabel produced a [[storm surge]] along the [[New Jersey]] coastline of up to 6.5&nbsp;feet (2&nbsp;m) in [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]]. Higher amounts occurred along the [[Delaware River]], peaking in the state at 10.6&nbsp;feet (3.2&nbsp;m) in [[Burlington, New Jersey|Burlington]]. At its closest approach, Isabel passed within about 215&nbsp;miles (350&nbsp;km) of the state, and as a result the outer [[rainband]]s produced light rainfall. [[Wildwood, New Jersey|Wildwood]] along the southeast coast reported 1.3&nbsp;inches (33&nbsp;mm) of rain,<ref name="tcr"/> while [[Lincoln Park, New Jersey|Lincoln Park]] in the northern portion of the state recorded 2.07&nbsp;inches (52&nbsp;mm) of precipitation.<ref name="njnws">{{cite web|author=Gorse & Frugis|year=2003|title=Post Tropical Storm Report on Hurricane Isabel|publisher=Mount Holly, New Jersey National Weather Service|accessdate=2006-11-15|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/phi/storms/09192003.txt}}</ref> The large wind field of the hurricane produced moderate winds across the state. A [[Bar (landform)|shoal]] in the [[Delaware Bay]] experienced sustained winds of 54&nbsp;mph (87&nbsp;km/h) with gusts to 71&nbsp;mph (114&nbsp;km/h). Cape May reported tropical storm force winds with gusts to 61&nbsp;mph (98&nbsp;km/h), while [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] in the northern portion of the state experienced gusts to 44&nbsp;mph (71&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="tcr"/>

Hurricane Isabel produced slightly above normal tides and rough surf along the Jersey shore, killing one surfer off of [[Wildwood Crest, New Jersey|Wildwood Crest]].<ref name="njncdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for New Jersey|accessdate=2006-11-15|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~512161}}</ref> The combination of gusty winds and the heavy surf produced moderate beach erosion along much of the coastline, primarily to beaches facing southeastward. In the [[Delaware Bay]] and [[Delaware River|River]] area, no significant erosion was reported, though coastal flooding from the hurricane washed out a road and destroyed the deck of a house in [[Baypoint, New Jersey|Baypoint]]. In [[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May County]] waves eroded the beaches by up to 4&nbsp;feet (1.2&nbsp;m) in [[Ocean City, New Jersey|Ocean City]] and [[Avalon, New Jersey|Avalon]], with several cities experiencing a loss of dunes and [[geotube]]s in [[Strathmere, New Jersey|Whale Beach]] being exposed. Waves from Isabel in [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]] resulted in light damage, minor coastal flooding, and slight beach erosion. The beaches of southern [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]] experienced a loss of 3 to 4&nbsp;feet (0.9 to 1.2&nbsp;m) of sand, while locations further to the north experienced only minor erosion. Most coastal areas of [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]] reported eroded beaches by up to 4&nbsp;feet (1.2&nbsp;m), with [[Union Beach, New Jersey|Union Beach]] losing about 5000&nbsp;sq. feet (465&nbsp;sq. m) of sand.<ref name="beachy">{{cite web|author=New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection|year=2003|title=Coastal Storm Survey|accessdate=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nj.gov/dep/shoreprotection/StormSurvey09-19-03.pdf}}</ref>

Moderate wind gusts throughout the state downed hundreds of trees, tree limbs, and power lines. Over 382,000 people were without power, one of the worst power outages on record for area utilities.<Ref name="njncdc"/> Downed trees and power lines closed major streets and schools in [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]].<ref name="njncdc2">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for New Jersey (2)|accessdate=2006-11-16|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~512163}}</ref> One downed tree greatly damaged a house in [[Middletown, New Jersey|Middletown]],<ref name="scotsman">{{cite web|author=Ben Mcconville|year=2003|title=Isabel's trail of destruction leaves 16 dead|publisher=Scotsman.com|accessdate=2006-11-16|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=980&id=1040932003}}</ref> and in [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]] several trees fell onto and damaged cars. A downed tree in [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]] injured a woman when she was struck,<ref name="njncdc2"/> and a woman in [[Independence Township, New Jersey|Independence Township]] was killed when a fallen tree landed on the vehicle she was driving.<ref name="njncdc"/> Strong winds from Isabel blew out the windows in an office building in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford]], causing injuries to two women when they were struck.<ref name="njncdc"/> Throughout the state, damage totaled to about $50&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $55&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).<ref name="tcr"/>
