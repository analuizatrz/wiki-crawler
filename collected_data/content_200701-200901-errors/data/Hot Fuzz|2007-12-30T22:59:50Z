'''''Hot Fuzz''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] police [[action film|action]] [[comedy film]] written by [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Edgar Wright]] and starring Simon Pegg and [[Nick Frost]]. They worked together previously on the [[2004 in film|2004]] motion picture ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' (the first film in the [[Blood and Ice Cream]] trilogy), and the television series ''[[Spaced]]''. It was directed by Edgar Wright and produced by [[Nira Park]]. Wright revealed that he wanted to write and direct a cop film because "there isn't really any tradition of cop films in the UK... We felt that every other country in the world had its own tradition of great cop action films and we had none."<ref name="NYP">{{cite web|title=New York Post|work="Hot Fuzz" Q&A: Flushing Birthday Cakes with Edgar Wright and Nick Frost |last=Christianson|first=Emily|url=http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/movies/news/n12889.htm|accessdate=August 7|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

The film debuted on [[February 14]], [[2007]] in the UK and [[20 April]] in the US. ''Hot Fuzz'' received multiple positive reviews, earning a 90% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and 81/100 from [[Metacritic]]. The total international box office gross reached $78,761,971 before its DVD premiere. Shortly after the film's release, two different soundtracks were released in the UK and US.

Nicholas Angel, an extremely dedicated and over-achieving [[police officer]] in [[London]]'s [[Metropolitan Police Service]], performs his duties so well that he makes everyone else look bad. As a result his superiors send him to a place where his talents won't be quite so embarrassing: the sleepy and seemingly crime-free [[village]] of Sandford in rural [[Gloucestershire]]. 

Once there, he is partnered with well-meaning but overeager and naïve police constable Danny Butterman, the son of local police inspector Frank Butterman. A committed action film fan, Danny is in awe of his new big city partner, who just might provide him with his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he longs for. Angel, meanwhile, struggles to adjust to the quiet and uneventful pace of the village, and despite clearing up several otherwise unnoticed [[crime]]s and [[misdemeanour]]s in short order, soon finds his most pressing concern being a [[swan]] that has escaped from its owner. Angel and Danny eventually bond over action films and drinks at the local pub.

[[Image:Fuzzswan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Angel and Butterman chase an escaped swan]]
Soon after Angel's arrival, a series of grisly murders disguised as accidents rock the village, all committed by an individual in a black hood and cloak. Increasingly convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and that the victims of the 'accidents' were murdered, Angel begins to clash with the other officers on the force. However, Angel refuses to drop the [[investigation]] and initially suspects Simon Skinner, the charming but sinister manager of the local [[Somerfield (UK retailer)|Somerfield]] supermarket, of murdering the victims due to their involvement in a lucrative property deal. His confrontation with Skinner only reveals Skinner's apparent innocence and further damages Angel's credibility with his colleagues. 

After being ambushed in his hotel room by the cloaked murderer, who is unmasked as the trolley boy of the Somerfield supermarket acting under the instruction of Skinner, Angel is led to a nearby castle where he discovers the truth; Inspector Butterman, Skinner and the [[Neighbourhood Watch]] Alliance (NWA), intent on keeping Sandford's title of "Village of the Year", have been murdering anyone who might damage the village's image. Inspector Butterman reveals that his wife committed suicide after the village lost the title many years ago, motivating him to use extreme methods to ensure Sandford wins the yearly contest. Angel discovers the bodies of various "problem" people whom the NWA disposed of, before being cornered and "stabbed" by Danny, apparently a member of the NWA. 

Having tricked the NWA into believing that Angel is dead, Danny instead drives him to the village limits and releases him, insisting that he knew nothing about their true activities. Danny urges Angel to flee, reasoning that no one would believe the truth about Sandford. However, whilst at a [[motorway]] service station, Angel sees the films that he and Danny bonded over on a nearby sales rack and is inspired to stop the NWA. He drives back to town and arms himself with weapons confiscated earlier in the film. After Angel meets with Danny in the village, the two begin to dispatch the members of the NWA in an increasingly destructive and frantic series of gun fights. 

Initially confronted by their colleagues in the Sandford Police Service (who are quickly persuaded of the truth), Angel and Danny take the battle to the supermarket. Skinner and Inspector Butterman flee, and are pursued by Angel and Danny to a nearby model village. There both Skinner and Inspector Butterman are apprehended. 

Although Angel's previous supervisors arrive from London begging Angel to return, as their crime rate has risen drastically, Angel elects to remain in Sandford. Back at the police station, the Sandford Police celebrate their triumph, but they are ambushed by the last remaining member of the NWA. He attempts to shoot Angel but Danny jumps in front of the gun and takes the bullets himself. In the resulting chaos a confiscated [[naval mine]] is triggered and the station is destroyed.

One year later, Angel lays flowers on a grave marked 'Butterman'; it is revealed that Danny has survived, and that the grave is his mother's. Angel has been promoted to Inspector and Danny to Sergeant, and the film ends as they go back on the beat together in Sandford.

While writing the script, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg intended to include Nick Frost as the partner for Pegg's character. Frost revealed that he would only do the film if he could name his character, and he chose "Danny Butterman".<ref name="CinemaReview2">{{cite web | title=CinemaReview | work=Hot Fuzz-Production Notes p.2 | url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=4056 | accessdate=August 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref> Cast requirements included fifty people for speaking and non-speaking parts, and there were several casting calls for citizens of [[Wells]] to fill the roles,  as the city was where the majority of the filming took place.<ref name="CinemaReview2"/>

(In the [[30 August]], 2007 edition of film critic [[Roger Ebert]]'s "Answer Man" column, John Weckmueller of Milwaukee wrote that he had "just listened to the commentary on the new DVD of Edgar Wright's ''Hot Fuzz''.

During the latter half of 2005, [[Working Title Films|Working Title]] approached several towns in [[South West England]] looking for an appropriate filming location. Simon Pegg commented "We're both from the [[West Country]] so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in [[Frome]]".<ref name="culture">{{cite episode | title = Week Four 2007 | series = ''The Culture Show'' | serieslink = The Culture Show|station=[[BBC 2]]|airdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> [[Stow-on-the-Wold]] was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon [[Wells]],<ref name="CotswoldJournal">{{cite web| title=Cotswald Journal | work=Thank God we did screen film event!| url=http://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/search/display.var.874709.0.thank_god_we_did_screen_film_event.php|date=[[August 11]], [[2006]]|accessdate=August 6|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Edgar Wright's hometown.

===Homage===
Wright has said that ''Hot Fuzz'' takes elements from his final amateur film, ''Dead Right'', which he described as both "''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' set in Somerset" and "a ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' film in Somerset".<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode|title=[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales]|series=The Comedy Map of Britain|network=[[BBC 2]]|station=|city=|airdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> He uses some of the same locations in both films including the Somerfield supermarket, where he used to work as a shelf-stacker.<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode|title=[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales]|series=The Comedy Map of Britain|network=[[BBC 2]]|airdate=2007-02-03}}</ref>

Various scenes in ''Hot Fuzz'' feature a variety of action film DVDs and scenes from ''[[Point Break]]'' and ''[[Bad Boys II]]''. Director Edgar Wright revealed that he had to get permission from the actor in each video clip to use the clips and for the use of the DVD covers had to pay for the rights from the respective studios.<ref name="MWEb">{{cite web|title=Movie Web|work=INTERVIEW: Edgar Wright Tackles Hot Fuzz|last=Chupnick|first=Steven|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/57/19157.php|date=[[April 17]], [[2007]]|accessdate=August 7|accessyear=2007}}</ref> The film parodies clichés used in other action movies. On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies, Pegg has said "Men can't do that thing, which is the greatest achievement of humankind, which is to make another human, so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into peoples heads [...] It's our turn to grab the gun by the hilt and fire it into your face".<ref name="culture">{{cite episode|title = Week Four 2007|series=The Culture Show | serieslink = The Culture Show | station = [[BBC 2]]|airdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> Despite this, Pegg maintains that the film is not a spoof in that, "They lack the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material. Because we're looking up to it."<ref name="EWBrit">{{cite news | author = Clark Collis | title = Brits and Giggles | publisher = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date = [[2007-04-13]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20034733,00.html | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref>

===Effects===
Ten artists were used to develop the visual effects for the film.<ref name="VFX">{{cite web| title=VFXWorld|work=Hot Fuzz: A Cop Spoof CG Investigation|last=Bielik|first=Alain|url=http://vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=1e242f07&atype=articles&id=3253|date=[[April 20]], [[2007]]|accessdate=August 8|accessyear=2007}}</ref> To illustrate the destruction of the mansion as a result of the gas explosion, gas mortars were placed in front of the building to create large-scale fireballs. The wave of fire engulfs the camera, and to achieve that effect, gas mortars were used again but were fired upwards into a black ceiling piece that sloped up towards the camera.<ref name="VFX"/> When the sequence was shot at a high speed the flames appeared to surge across the ground. For one of the final scenes of the film, the Sandford police station is destroyed from an explosion. Part of the explosion was created by using a set model that showed its windows being blown out, while the building remained intact. The actual destruction of the building was depicted by exploding a miniature model of the station.<ref name="HotFuzzDVD"/>

Similar to the work in ''Shaun of the Dead'', blood and gore was prevalent throughout the film and [[visual effects]] supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: "In many ways, the more extreme you make it, the more people know it is stylized and enjoy the humor inherent in how ridiculous it is. It's rather like the (eventually) limbless [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight]] in ''[[Monty Python's Holy Grail]]''."<ref name="VFX"/> The most time-consuming sequence involving gore was for when the reporter's head is crushed by a section of a cathedral. A dummy was used against a [[bluescreen|green screen]] and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Over seventy gunfight shots were digitally added throughout the film and Briscoe also stated: "The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like our hero characters really do have it all going off, all around them...It was a great demonstration of what a difference how individual, seemingly very trivial enhancements can make a difference when combined across a sequence."<ref name="VFX"/>

===Preparation and filming===
To prepare for their roles in the film, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost had to follow certain requirements. Pegg's contract stated that he had to adopt a strict diet and use three personal trainers to prepare him for the physically demanding scenes in the film. Frost was asked by Wright and Pegg to watch around twenty action films to warm him up for his role as a police officer, but he decided to only watch ''Bad Boys II''.<ref name="CinemaReview3">{{cite web | title=CinemaReview | work=Hot Fuzz-Production Notes p.3 | url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=4056 | accessdate=August 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref>

==DVD==
The [[DVD]] was released on [[11 June]], [[2007]] in the UK and [[8 June]], [[2007]] in Ireland. Over one million DVDs were sold in the UK in the first four weeks of its release.<ref name="Cinematical">{{cite web|title=Cinematical|work=Comic-Con: Hot Fuzz on DVD Today, Play the Shootout Game Now!|last=Kelly|first=Kevin|url=http://www.cinematical.com/2007/07/31/comic-con-hot-fuzz-on-dvd-today-play-the-shootout-game-now/|date=[[July 31]], [[2007]]|accessdate=August 7|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Disc one of the two-disc set contains the feature film with four commentaries, outtakes, trailers, and TV spots, 'The Man Who Would Be Fuzz', 'Hot Funk' (not a music video but a brief poorly censored version of the film), Fuzz-o-meter, storyboards, and 'Flick Book: The Other Side'. Disc two contains twenty-two deleted scenes with optional commentary, a making of documentary, thirteen video blogs, featurettes, plot holes and comparisons, special effects feature, galleries, and some hidden [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter eggs]]. The DVD also features Wright's last amateur film ''Dead Right'' which he described as "Hot Fuzz without the budget". A making of ''Dead Right'' is also included on the second disc. Due to the above release date, the movie arrives on region 2 DVD earlier than the theatrical release date in [[Germany]] on [[June 14]], [[2007]].<ref name="Kino.de">{{cite web | title=Kino.de| work=Hot Fuzz - Zwei abgewichste Profis|url=http://www.kino.de/kinofilm/hot-fuzz-zwei-abgewichste-profis/103220.html|language=German|accessdate=August 6 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

The US DVD and [[HD DVD]] release of ''Hot Fuzz'' came out on [[July 31]], [[2007]]. According to the official site, the HD DVD edition has more special features than the standard DVD release. The three-disc Collector's Edition was released on [[November 27]], [[2007]].

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Hot Fuzz (soundtrack)}}
The soundtrack album, ''Hot Fuzz: Music from the Motion Picture'', was released on [[February 19]], [[2007]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and on [[April 17]], [[2007]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The UK release contains twenty-two tracks, and the US/Canada release has fourteen.

The film's score is by British composer [[David Arnold]], who has scored the [[James Bond (films)|James Bond film series]] since 1997. The soundtrack album's "Hot Fuzz Suite" is a compilation of excerpts from Arnold's score.<ref name="All Music Guide">{{cite web|title=All Music Guide|work=Hot Fuzz [Cherry Tree] Review|last=Phares|first=Heather|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Abi6cmqp39f6o|accessdate=August 10|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Other music from the film is a mix of 1960s and 1970s [[British rock]] ([[The Kinks]], [[T.Rex (band)|T.Rex]], [[The Move]], [[Sweet (band)|The Sweet]], [[The Troggs]], [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], [[Cozy Powell]]), [[New Wave (music)|New Wave]] ([[Adam Ant]], [[XTC]]) and [[Independent music|indie]] UK and American rock ([[The Fratellis]], [[Eels (band)|Eels]]).<ref name="All Music Guide"/><ref name="Soundtrack Collector">{{cite web|title=Soundtrack Collector|work=Soundtrack details: Hot Fuzz|url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=78929|accessdate=August 10|accessyear=2007}}</ref> The soundtrack album features dialogue extracts by [[Simon Pegg]], [[Nick Frost]] and other cast members, mostly embedded in the music tracks.<ref name="SoundtrackNet">{{cite web|last=Ruiz|first=Rafael|title=SoundtrackNet|work=Hot Fuzz soundtrack|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=4447|accessdate=August 10|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

At times the music is [[Diegesis|diagetic]] in nature, for example when [[Timothy Dalton]]'s character Simon Skinner drives by the fatal collision scene of Martin Blower and Eve Draper, the [[Dire Straits]] song, "[[Romeo and Juliet (song)|Romeo and Juliet]]" is heard on Skinner's car radio. In another scene, involving the burning death of George Merchant, Skinner drives by with his car radio playing "[[Fire (Arthur Brown song)|Fire]]" by [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]].

The Dire Straits' "Romeo and Juliet" does not appear on the soundtrack album, but in his DVD commentary, director Edgar Wright notes the irony of having to pay Dire Straits to use the song after he had poked fun at the band in his previous film, ''Shaun of the Dead''.<ref name="HotFuzzDVD"/>

The song selection also includes some police-themed titles, including [[Supergrass]]' "[[Caught by the Fuzz]]" as well as "Here Come the Fuzz", which was especially composed for the film by [[Blues Explosion|Jon Spencer's Blues Explosion]].<ref name="HotFuzzDVD"/><ref name="All Music Guide"/>

American film director [[Robert Rodriguez]] contributed to the film's score, and is acknowledged in the UK album's liner notes. The liner notes also credit Nick Angel (the person whom the character is named after) and director [[Edgar Wright]] as executive producers, while British [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] and [[breakbeat]] DJ [[Osymyso]] is credited as soundtrack producer.<ref name = "Hot Fuzz liner notes">{{Citation  | last = Wright  | first = Edgar  | author-link = Edgar Wright  | title = Hot Fuzz: Music from the Motion Picture (liner notes)   | publisher = Universal Island Records  | year = 2007  | location = United Kingdom  | id = 172 475-6}}</ref> Osymyso had worked with Pegg and Wright on their previous film, ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.
