'''Jimmy Nail''' (born [[March 16]], [[1954]]) is an [[England|English]] [[actor]] and [[singer]]. He is famous for his idiosyncratic looks, hit singles and a strong [[Geordie]] accent.

==Biography==
===Personal life===
Nail was born '''James Michael Aloysius Bradford''' in [[Benton, Newcastle upon Tyne]], the son of Laura ([[married and maiden names|née]] Johnson) and James Bradford. He was brother to two sisters: Shelagh (who died in June 1967) and [[Val McLane]], who starred with him in the second series of ''[[Auf Wiedersehen Pet]]'' playing Norma Patterson. Jimmy currently lives in [[Florida]] with his wife Miriam and two sons.

===Career===
Nail rose to fame playing Leonard Jeffrey 'Oz' Osborne in ''[[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]]'' in [[1983]], despite having minimal acting experience (he had appeared as an extra in the movie ''[[Get Carter]]''). Nail has also starred in a number of films and had a long musical career, having been a singer before he was picked out at an audition to play Oz.

After the first two series of ''Auf Wiedersehen, Pet'', Nail found himself typecast and had no more major breaks until the detective series, ''[[Spender]]'', which he co-wrote.  This was followed by ''[[Crocodile Shoes]]'', which also featured Nail as a musician. On the strength of his musical performances in the series, he released a number of albums. [[Mark Knopfler]] plays guitar on some tracks, a compliment that was repaid with an important plot reference to Oz's being a fan of [[Dire Straits]] in the third (revived) series of ''Auf Wiedersehen, Pet'' ([[2002]]).

===The Jimmy Nail case===
In 2004, Jimmy Nail successfully sued the ''[[News of the World]]'' for defamation (''Nail v News Group Newspapers Limited'', 20 December 2004) and subsequently received damages in the sum of £30,000. The original sum was determined in March 2004 under the ‘offer to amend’ system contrary to the Defamation Act 1996. However, Nail appealed the ruling on the grounds that the judge was incorrect in assessing the level of damages awarded.

The complaint concerned the ''News of the World''’s centre spread headlined as “Jimmy’s Secret Bondage Orgies”. The article suggested that Mr Nail ‘queued’ for an orgy with a woman known as “Randy Mandy”. The article went on to say that Nail had sex with the woman using fat from a chip pan as lubricant. Further, he was said to have seduced a wife of a fellow rock star whilst in a stable relationship, and that he once ate a can of dog meat in times of hardship.

Other non-sex related comments were that he exploited the death of a colleague for financial purposes, and that he became a property developer through criminal means.
