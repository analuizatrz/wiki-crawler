{{Cannon}}

A '''cannon''' is a type of [[artillery]], usually large and tubular in shape, that uses [[gunpowder]] or other explosive-based [[propellant]]s to launch a [[projectile]] over a distance. Cannon vary in [[caliber|size]], [[Range of a projectile|range]], [[mobility]], [[rate of fire]], and [[fire power]]; different types combine these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use.

The end of the [[Middle Ages]] saw the introduction of more standardized and effective cannon.

Some of the largest cannon ever constructed were of [[Asia]]n origin, such as the [[India]]n [[Jaivana cannon]]. Some European pieces were also large, but were abandoned in favor of larger numbers of lighter, more maneuverable ones; this eventually lead to the use of modern [[field artillery]]. While the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Great Turkish Bombard]] required two hundred men to [[Cannon operation|operate]], [[18th century]] English cannon required only a dozen men, including two gunners; by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], only five men were needed to operate a British cannon. Cannon have also been used for non-military purposes, including [[music]]. When used in music, cannon are used to replace, else supplement, percussion instruments. Cannon also make popular [[museum]] displays, though older ones must first be preserved, through a process involving [[Extractive metallurgy|electrolytic reduction treatment]], to forestall corrosion.

==Etymology and terminology==
[[Image:Jaivana.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The [[Jaivana cannon|Jaivana cannon]] is the largest wheel-mounted cannon in the world.]]
The term "cannon" is derived from several languages, including [[Italian language|Old Italian]], [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. The word is derived from the Old Italian word "cannone," meaning "large tube," which came from the Latin "canna," in turn originating from the Greek word "kanna," and ultimately deriving from the Akkadian term "qanu," meaning "tube" or "reed."<ref name="Definition and etymology of cannon">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Cannon|title=Definition and etymology of "cannon"|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]|accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cane|title=Etymology of "Cane"|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref><ref name="Definition and etymology of cane">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cane|title=Definition and etymology of "cane"|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]|accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> The word "cannon" has been used to refer to a gun since 1326, in Italy, and 1418, in England. "Bombardum," or "bombard," was the earliest-used word for "cannon," but came to refer only to the largest weapons after 1430.<ref name="Nitrates"/> "Cannon" serves both as the singular and plural of the noun, although the plural "cannons" is also correct.<ref name="Definition and etymology of cannon" />

Any large, [[smoothbore]], [[muzzle-loading]] [[gun]]&mdash;used before the advent of [[breech-loading]], [[rifled]] guns&mdash;firing explosive [[shell (projectile)|shells]] may be referred to as a cannon, though the term specifically refers to a gun designed to fire a {{convert|42|lb|abbr=on}} shot, as opposed to a [[demi-cannon]] ({{convert|32|lb|abbr=on}}), [[culverin]] ({{convert|18|lb|abbr=on}}), or [[demi-culverin]] ({{convert|9|lb|abbr=on}}).

The first documented battlefield use of gunpowder artillery took place on [[January 28]], [[1132]], when [[Song Dynasty|Song]] General [[Han Shizhong]] used [[Huochong]] to capture a city in [[Fujian]]. The first illustration of a cannon is dated to 1326.<ref>{{cite book|title=Weapons: An International Encyclopedia from 5000 B.C. to 2000 A.D.|publisher=Diagram Group|year=1990|page=111}}</ref> In his 1341 poem, ''The Iron Cannon Affair'', one of the first accounts of the use of gunpowder artillery in China, [[Xian Zhang]] wrote that a cannonball fired from an eruptor could "pierce the heart or belly when it strikes a man or horse, and can even transfix several persons at once."<ref>{{cite book|last=Norris|first=John|year=2003|title=Early Gunpowder Artillery: 1300-1600|publisher=Marlborough: The Crowood Press}}</ref>

[[Joseph Needham]] suggests that the proto-[[Shell (projectile)|shells]] described in the ''[[Huolongjing]]'' may be among the first of their kind.<ref name="Science and Civilisation in China" /> The Chinese mounted more than 3,000 bronze and iron casted cannon on the [[Great Wall of China]], to help defend against the [[Mongol]]s. The weapon was taken up by the Mongol conquerors later, and was also [[Korean cannon|used in Korea]]. Chinese soldiers fighting under the Mongols appear to have used hand cannon in battles in [[Manchuria]] in 1288, a date deduced from archaeological finds at the sites of these battles.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacey|first=Arnold|title=Technology in World Civilization|page=47|year=1990|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=0262660725}}</ref>

In the 1593 [[Siege of Pyongyang (1593)|Siege of Pyongyang]], 40,000 [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] troops deployed a variety of cannon to bombard an equally large Japanese army; the Japanese were defeated in one day. During the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Seven Year War]] in Korea, both the Chinese-Korean coalition and the Japanese army used artillery  widely, in land and naval battles.

Fashioned primarily for siege warfare, the Great Turkish Bombards were cast in bronze and were made in two parts: the barrel that held the projectile, and the chamber that held the charge. The two parts were screwed together using levers to facilitate the work.

===Medieval Europe===
{{main|Cannon in the Middle Ages}}
The first mention of the composition of gunpowder in express terms in Europe appeared in 1216, in [[Roger Bacon]]'s "''De nullitate magiæ''" at Oxford.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=1771|location=London|chapter=Gunpowder|quote = <!-- original uses Long s --> frier Bacon, our countryman, mentions the compoſition in expreſs terms, in his treatiſe ''De nullitate magiæ'', publiſhed at Oxford, in the year 1216.}}; Note the [[Long s]]</ref> Later in 1248, his "''Opus Maior''" describes a recipe and recognized military use:

In order to produce this artificial lightning and thunder it is necessary to take saltpeter, sulfur, and Luru Vopo Vir Can Utriet."}}
Bacon noted that firecrackers were "used in certain parts of the world." His mixture resembles the assumed composition of Chinese slow-burning powder,&mdash;such as those used in fire arrows, and rockets&mdash;but is not a good propellant, as the saltpeter content is too low.<ref name="Gunpowder">{{cite web|url=http://www.hyw.com/Books/History/gunpowde.htm|title=Gunpowder|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref>

The first use of gunpowder in Europe was the [[Moors|Moorish]] cannon, first used by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] in [[Spain]], at the siege of [[Seville]] in 1248, and the siege of [[Niebla, Huelva|Niebla]] in 1262.<ref name="Arab Rockets"/> By 1250, "coal and sulfur" had been recognized as the best weapon for [[naval warfare|ship-to-ship combat]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediumaevum.com/75years/mirror/sec2.html#XXXIX|title=King's Mirror, Chapter XXXVII: The duties, activities and amusements of the Royal Guardsmen|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> while hand guns were probably in use on land. Italian ''scopettieri'' ("gun bearers") were mentioned in conjunction with [[crossbowmen]], in 1281. In Spain, the "first artillery-masters on the Peninsula" were enlisted, at around the same time.<ref>{{cite book|title=Arms and Armour in Spain|last=Hoffmeyer|first=Ada Bruhn de|isbn=0435-029x|page=217}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediumaevum.com/75years/mirror/sec2.html#XXXIX|title=King's Mirror, Chapter XXXVII: The duties, activities and amusements of the Royal Guardsmen|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref>

The first metal cannon was the ''[[pot-de-fer]]''. Loaded with an arrow-like [[Quarrel|bolt]] that was probably wrapped in leather to allow greater thrusting power, it was set off through a touchhole with a heated wire. Such weapons were used by the French, and possibly the English, during the [[Hundred Years War]], when cannon saw its first real use on the European battlefield.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xenophongroup.com/montjoie/gp_wpns.htm|title=Gunpowder Weapons of the Late Fifteenth Century|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> Even then, cannon were still a relatively rare weapon.

[[Image:Kanon_in_het_Kremlin.jpg|thumb|left|175px|1586 [[Tsar Cannon]], the largest [[howitzer]] ever made, by [[Andrey Chokhov]].]]
By the 1500s, cannon were made in a great variety of lengths and bore diameters, but the general rule was that the longer the barrel, the longer the range. By mid-century, European monarchs began to classify cannon to reduce the confusion. [[Henry II]] of France opted for six sizes of cannon,<ref>The six sizes are, in order from largest to smallest: the cannon, great culverin, bastard culverin, "legitimate" culverin, falcon, and falconet.</ref> but others settled for more; the Spanish used twelve sizes, and the English sixteen.<ref>They are, from largest to smallest: the cannon royal, cannon, cannon serpentine, bastard cannon, demicannon, pedrero, culverin, basilisk, demiculverin, bastard culverin, saker, minion, falcon, falconet, serpentine, and rabinet.</ref><ref name="tunis">{{cite book|last=Tunis|first=Edwin|title=Weapons: A Pictorial History|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|location=[[Baltimore, Maryland]]|year=1999|isbn=0-8018-6229-9}}</ref> Better powder had been developed by this time as well. Instead of the finely-ground powder used by the first bombards, powder was replaced by a "corned" variety of coarse grains. This powder, being irregularly distributed, had pockets of air between grains, allowing fire to travel through, and ignite the entire charge quickly and uniformly.<ref name="tunis"/>

The end of the Middle Ages saw the construction of larger, more powerful cannon, as well their spread throughout the world. The [[Tsar Cannon]], [[foundry|founded]] by Russian founding master [[Andrey Chokhov]] in 1586, was the largest [[howitzer]] ever made. The cannon, which still survives today, was intended to fire [[grapeshot]], and to defend [[the Kremlin]], but was never used. In fact, with such a large cannon, it may have been intended as a showpiece of military might and engineering, rather than for battle.

Innovations continued, notably the German invention of the [[mortar]], which was a thick-walled, short-barreled gun that blasted shot upward at a steep angle, for it to come down again onto its target. Mortars were useful for sieges, as they could fire over walls, and other defenses. This cannon found more use with the Dutch, who learned to shoot bombs filled with powder from them. However, setting the bomb fuse in the mortar was a problem. "Single firing" was the first technique used to set the fuse, where the bomb was placed with the fuse down against the propelling charge. Unfortunately, this practice often resulted in the fuse being blown into the bomb, causing it to blow up in front of the mortar. Because of this danger, "double firing" was developed, where the fuse was turned up and the gunner lighted the fuse and the touchhole simultaneously. This, however, required much skill and timing, and was especially dangerous when the gun failed to fire, leaving a lighted bomb in the barrel. Not until 1650 was it accidentally discovered that double-lighting was a superfluous process: the heat of firing was enough to light the fuse.<ref name="tunis"/>

[[Siege engines]], such as [[siege tower]]s and [[trebuchet]]s, became vulnerable and obsolete with the development of large cannon, and the resulting changes in fortification. However, wooden "battery-towers" took on a similar role as siege towers in the [[gunpowder]] age, such as that used at [[siege of Kazan]] in 1552, which could hold ten large-caliber cannon, in addition to 50 lighter cannon.<ref name="Kazan">{{cite book|last=Nossov|first=Konstantine|page=53-55|title=Russian Fortresses, 1480–1682|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|year=2006|isbn=1-84176-916-9}}</ref>

[[Image:Fortbourtange.jpg|thumb|175px|Fort Bourtange, a [[star fort]], was built with angles and sloped walls specifically to defend against cannon.]]
Wheeled gun carriages became more common by the end of the 15th century, and, as a result, field artillery began to emerge.<ref name="Sadler"/> In ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] observed that "small pieces of cannon... do more damage than heavy artillery. The best remedy against the latter is making a resolute attack upon it as soon as possible..."<ref name="The Art of War (Machiavelli)">{{cite book|first=Niccolò|last=Machiavelli|title=The Art of War}}</ref> As was the case at [[Battle of Flodden Field|Flodden]] in 1513, the English [[field gun]]s outpaced the Scottish siege artillery, firing twice, or even thrice, as many rounds.<ref name="Sadler">{{cite book|title=Flodden 1513: Scotland's greatest defeat (Campaign 168)|last=Sadler|first=John|isbn=9781841769592|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|year=2006}}</ref>

Most notable in this period, however, is the effect of cannon on conventional fortifications. Machiavelli wrote, "There is no wall, whatever its thickness that artillery will not destroy in only a few days."<ref name="The Art of War (Machiavelli)"/> Although [[castle]]s were not immediately made obsolete by cannon, their importance declined.<ref name="Castles81">Wilkinson, p 81</ref> Instead of majestic [[tower]]s and [[merlon]]s, the walls of new fortresses were thicker, angulated, and sloped, while towers became lower and stouter; these new defenses became known as "[[star fort]]s, after their characteristic shape.<ref name="Castles81"/>

Forts featuring [[Artillery battery|cannon batteries]] were built during the [[Renaissance]], such as the ''[[trace italienne]]'' of [[Italy]], and the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]]s' [[Device Forts]] in England.<ref name="Castles81"/> To guard against artillery and gunfire, increasing use was made of earthen, brick and stone [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastworks]] and [[redoubt]]s, such as the geometric [[star fort]]s of the 17th century French [[Marquis de Vauban]]. These soon replaced castles in Europe, and, eventually, castles in the Americas were also superseded by bastions and forts.<ref name="SpanishMain">{{cite book|last=Chartrand|first=René|title=Spanish Main: 1492-1800|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]}}</ref>

===18th and 19th century===
{{main|Naval artillery in the Age of Sail|Field artillery in the American Civil War}}
[[Image:Antoine Morel-Fatio pl10.jpg|thumb|30-pounder long gun at the ready.|175px]]
The lower tier of 17th century English [[Ship of the Line|ships of the line]] were usually equipped with demi-cannon, a [[navy|naval]] [[gun]] which fired a 32-pound solid shot. A full cannon at this time fired a 42-pound shot, but these were discontinued by the 18th century as they were seen as too unwieldy. By the end of the century, principles long adopted in Europe specified the characteristics of cannon of the British ship design and the types and sizes of acceptable defects. The U.S. Navy tested guns by measurement, proof by powder (two or three firings), and using compressed water for leak detection.<ref name="NavyBarbaryI">Knox, ''Naval Documents related to the United Stats Wars with the Barbary Powers'', Volume I</ref>

The [[carronade]] was adopted by the Royal Navy in 1779, and the lower muzzle velocity of the [[round shot]] was intended to create many more of the deadly wooden [[wikt:splinter|splinters]] when hitting the structure of an enemy vessel. It was much shorter and a third to a quarter of the weight of an equivalent [[long gun]]: for example, a 32 pounder carronade weighed less than a [[ton]], but a 32 pounder long gun weighed over 3&nbsp;tons. The guns were thus easier to handle and also required less than half the gunpowder of long guns mounted on naval garrison carriages, allowing fewer men to crew them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavycarronade.htm |title= The Historical Maritime Society |accessdate=2008-02-16 |format= |work=}}</ref> Carronades were manufactured in the usual naval gun [[caliber]]s<!--12, 18, 24, 32 and 42&nbsp;[[pound (weight)#Imperial_pound|pounders]], but 6&nbsp;pdr and 68&nbsp;pdr versions are known-->, but they were not counted in a [[ship of the line]]'s rated number of guns. As a result, the classification of Royal Navy vessels in this period can mislead, since they would often be carrying more pieces of ordnance than were listed.

[[Image:ChancellorsvilleBattlefieldModern.jpg|left|thumb|A cannon from the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]].|175px]]

The Turkish cannon of the siege of Constantinople, after being on permanent display for four centuries, were used to battle a British fleet in 1807. The artillery hit a British ship with two 700&nbsp;pound cannonballs, killing 60 sailors. In 1867, Sultan Abdul Aziz gifted [[Queen Victoria]] the 17&nbsp;ton "Dardanelles Gun"&mdash;one of the cannon used at the siege of Constantinople.<ref name="Trivia Library"/>

But in contrast to these antiquated weapons, later western guns during the 19th century became massive, destructive, more accurate, and covered a very long range - such as the American {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} wrought-iron muzzle-loading [[howitzer]] used during the [[American Civil War]] with an effective range of over 1.1&nbsp;miles (1.83&nbsp;km). In the 1810s and 1820s, greater emphasis was placed on the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside. The carronade, although initially very successful and widely adopted, disappeared from the Royal Navy from the 1850s after the development of steel, jacketed cannon by [[William George Armstrong]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Nevertheless, carronades were used in the American Civil War in the 1860s.
[[Image:Utah Battery San Juan Bridge.jpeg|thumb|right|175px|U.S. troops fire during the 1899 [[Battle of Manila (1899)|Battle of Manila]], [[Philippine-American War]].]]
The practice of [[rifling]], involving casting spiralling lines inside the barrel, was first applied to artillery in the 1860s, giving new cannon [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic]] stability and improving their accuracy. The cynical attitude towards recruited infantry in the face of ever more powerful field artillery is the source of the term "[[cannon fodder]]," first used by [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] in 1814;<ref>{{fr icon}} [[:wikisource:fr:De Buonaparte et des Bourbons|"De Buonaparte et des Bourbons"]] — full text in the French [[Wikisource]].</ref> although the concept of regarding soldiers as nothing more than "food for powder" dates back at least to [[Shakespeare]]'s time.<ref>[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]''</ref>

The superior cannon technology of Westerners in later years would bring them tremendous advantages in warfare. For example, in the [[Opium War]] in China during the 19th century, the British battleships bombarded the coastal areas and fortifications safe from the reach of the Chinese cannon. Similarly, the shortest war on the record, the [[Anglo-Zanzibar War]] of 1896, was brought to a swift conclusion by shelling from British battleships.<ref>Guinness Book of World Records, 2002 edition, p 112</ref>

===Modern times===

A modern cannon is a dual-purpose weapon. It can operate as a direct fire, low trajectory, high velocity weapon, firing directly at its target like a modern main battle [[tank]]. It can also operate as a lower velocity, high trajectory, [[indirect fire]] weapon or howitzer. Since [[World War I]], the term has been used to refer to a gun of around 20&nbsp;mm to 125&nbsp;mm caliber, sometimes with an automatic loading [[Firearm action|action]] capable of firing explosive [[ammunition]], an [[autocannon]]. Lower [[muzzle velocity]] modern artillery is used almost exclusively in the [[indirect fire]] mode, while higher-velocity cannon from 20&nbsp;mm up to 125&nbsp;mm caliber are used in a [[direct fire]] mode. Nevertheless, tanks can fire high trajectory missions and artillery cannon can fire direct fire missions if the battlefield situation calls for it. Both tank and artillery gunners are trained for these non-typical missions.

Significant innovations have been made regarding the cannon's place in modern warfare. "[[Supergun]]s" have been developed since the early 20th century, and the 20&nbsp;cm (200&nbsp;mm) caliber "[[Paris Gun]]" of [[World War I]] had the greatest range of a gun, achieving 122&nbsp;km.<ref>Guinness Book of World Records, 2002 edition, p 113</ref> At the same time, the guns used aboard the [[Iowa class battleship|Iowa class]] [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|USS ''Wisconsin'']] and [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] were capable of firing projectiles a distance of {{convert|39|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref>Guinness Book of World Records, 2002 edition, p 184</ref> Testing has also been carried out on [[Nuclear artillery|nuclear cannon]] in the 1950s, as in the [[United States]]' [[Operation Upshot-Knothole]]. Today, [[United States]] 152&nbsp;mm artillery fires [[MGM-51 Shillelagh|Shillelagh missiles]], which are guided to their targets by [[infra-red]] beams, while the [[Super High Altitude Research Project]] artillery can fire shells {{convert|75.75|mi|km|abbr=on}} above the earth's surface.<ref name="Trivia Library"/>

==== Autocannon ====
[[Image:GAU-8 in A-10.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The [[GAU-8/A Avenger]] [[autocannon]], mounted in an [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]].]] 
An [[autocannon]] is a cannon with a larger [[caliber]] than a [[machine gun]], but smaller than that of a [[field gun]]. {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} has been the ''[[de facto]]'' minimum bore for autocannon since World War II, and, since they are the lowest caliber pieces, for all types of cannon as well. Autocannon have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster rate of fire than artillery, approaching&mdash;and, in the case of [[Gatling guns]], surpassing&mdash;that of a [[machine gun]].<ref name="Autocannon Rate of Fire"/>

Most nations use these modern rapid-fire cannon on their lighter vehicles, replacing a more powerful [[tank gun]]. A typical autocannon is the [[25 mm caliber|25&nbsp;mm]] "[[M242|Bushmaster]]" [[chain gun]], mounted on the [[LAV-25]] and [[M2 Bradley]] [[Infantry fighting vehicle|armored vehicles]].<ref name="Bushmaster"/>

Autocannon have largely replaced machine guns in aircraft, due to their greater firepower.<ref name="Aircraft Cannon"/> The first airborne cannon appeared in [[World War II]], and each airplane used only one or two, as cannon are heavier than machine guns. They were variously mounted, often in the wings, but also high on the forward fuselage, where they would fire through the [[propeller]], or even through the propeller hub. Due both to the low number of cannon per aircraft, and the lower rate of fire of cannon, machine guns continued to be used widely early in the war, as there was a greater probability of hitting enemy aircraft.<ref name="Aircraft Cannon"/> However, as cannon were more effective against more heavily armored bomber aircraft, they were eventually integrated into newer fighters, which usually carried between two and four autocannon. The [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404]], [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm cannon]], [[MG FF cannon|MG FF]], and their numerous variants became among the most widely used autocannon in the war. Nearly all modern aircraft are armed with an autocannon, and most are derived from their counterparts from the Second World War.<ref name="Aircraft Cannon"/> The largest, heaviest, and most powerful airborne cannon used by the [[United States military]] is the [[GAU-8/A Avenger]] Gatling-type rotary cannon;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.442fw.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123055695|title=GAU-8/A|publisher=442nd Fighter Wing|accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> it is surpassed only by the specialized artillery pieces carried on the [[AC-130]] gunship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.123exp-warfare.com/t/03804237449/|title=Information on the GAU-8/A|publisher=The Language of Weaponry|accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>

Although capable of generating a high volume of fire, autocannon are limited by the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25&nbsp;mm Bushmaster and the British 30&nbsp;mm [[RARDEN]] are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, in order to extend the amount of time they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels&mdash;[[gatling guns]]&mdash;can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-30|GSh-6-30K]], which has a rate of fire of over 6,000 rounds per minute.<ref name="Autocannon Rate of Fire">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Anthony G.|page=241|title=Rapid Fire|publisher=Shrewsbury: Airlife Publishing Ltd.|year=2000|isbn=1-84037-435-7}}</ref> Such extremely high rates of fire are effectively employed by aircraft in air-to-ground and air-to-air combat, where the target dwell time is short, and weapons are typically operated in brief bursts.

==Operation==
{{main|Cannon operation}}
[[Image:Cannoniere_1652.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The parts of a cannon described, John Roberts, ''The Compleat Cannoniere'', London 1652.]]
Cannon operation during the 18th century is described by the 1771 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, while the left gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine and keep ready to fire the cannon at the officer's command. Three soldiers stood on each side of the cannon, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left was charged with providing 50 bullets.<ref name="EB1771">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=1771|location=London|chapter=Gunnery}}</ref>

Prior to loading, the cannon would be well cleaned with a wet sponge to extinguish any smoldering material from the last shot (because fresh powder was about to be poured in, and any lingering ignition sources would set it off prematurely). The powder was added, followed by a wad of paper or hay, and the ball was thrown in. After ramming the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above the horizontal line was called random-shot. The officer of artillery had to ensure the cannon was diligently served. Water was available to dip the sponges in and cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.<ref name="EB1771"/>
[[Image:CannonWithSmoke.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Cannon in a Civil War [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]: The large amounts of gunpowder often affected visibility significantly. Gunners hope for a strong wind that will allow them to continue to see their target.]]

It was said that a 24-pounder could fire 90 to 100 shots a day in summer, or 60 to 75 in winter. A 16- or 12-pounder would fire a little more, because they were easier served. The Britannica mentions "some occasions where 200 shots have been fired from these pieces in the space of nine hours, and 138 in the space of five."<ref name="EB1771"/>

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a British gun team consisted of 5 numbered gunners. The gun's "No. 1" was the gun commander, a sergeant, who aimed the gun. The No. 2 was the "spongeman," who cleaned the bore with the sponge dampened with water between shots, the intention being to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced. No. 3, the loader, inserted the bag of powder, and then the projectile. The No. 2 then used a rammer, or the sponge reversed, to drive it in. At the same time, the No. 4&mdash;the "ventsman"&mdash;pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the No. 4 pricked the bagged charge through the vent hole, and filled the vent with powder. At the No. 1's command, the No. 5 would fire the piece with his slowmatch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Richard|title=Redcoat: the British Soldier in the age of Horse and Musket|pages=496|year=2002|publisher=[[W.

==In music==
The cannon has been used as a [[percussion]] instrument in certain pieces of music, one of the best known examples being [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]''.<ref name=1812overture /> The overture is properly played using an artillery section together with the orchestra, resulting in noise levels requiring musicians to wear [[ear protection]].<ref name=july4 /> It is supposed to simulate the [[Battle of Borodino]], specifically, emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s retreat from Russia in 1812, and the rounds of cannon fire during the battle.<ref name=1812overture>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicwithease.com/tchaikovsky-1812-overture.html|title=1812 Overture, Op. 49 - Tchaikovsky|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref><ref name=july4 /> When the piece was first played, the cannon were fired by an electric current triggered by the conductor.<ref>{{cite web |author=Lee, Ernest Markham |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x60NAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA21&dq=1812+overture&lr=#PPA21,M1 |title=Tchaikovsky - Google Book Search |accessdate=2008-02-22 |format=e-book |work=}}</ref> However, the piece was not recorded with actual cannon fire until [[Mercury Records]] and [[conductor]] [[Antal Dorati]]'s [[1958]] recording of the [[Minnesota Orchestra]].<ref>{{cite web |author= Flynn, Tony |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2007/Oct07/Dorati_flynn.htm |title=Antal Dorati - Recording Legend - October 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-22 |format= |work=}}</ref> Cannon fire is also frequently used annually in presentations of the ''1812'' on the American  [[Fourth of July|Independence Day]], a tradition started by [[Arthur Fiedler]] of the [[Boston Pops]] in [[1974]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/tchaikov/1812.html |title=Classical Net - Tchaikovsky - 1812 Overture |accessdate=2008-02-22 |format= |work=}}</ref><ref name=july4>{{cite web |url=http://www.postgazette.com/ae/20030704overtureae3.asp |title=How a rousing Russian tune took over our July 4th |accessdate=2008-02-22 |format= |work=}}</ref>

The [[hard rock]] band [[AC/DC]] also used cannon in their song ''[[For Those About to Rock (We Salute You) (song)|For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)]]''.<ref name=acdcsong>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:w9fexze5ld6e |title=For Those About to Rock We Salute You [song] |accessdate=2008-02-26 |published=All Music Guide}}</ref> The [[For Those About to Rock|album of the same name]] also featured a cannon on its cover.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:06rsa9igb23h~T1 |title=For Those About to Rock We Salute You |accessdate=2008-02-26 |publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> In live shows, real cannon were used to perform the piece.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1183 |title=For Those About To Rock (We Salute You) by AC/DC Songfacts |accessdate=2008-02-22 |format= |work=}}</ref><ref name=acdcsong />

Due to their impracticalities, cannon are generally only used for grand, theatrical pieces, often with a military theme. In the case of the ''1812'', the cannon may be replaced with [[bass drum]], [[timpani]], or a synthesizer.<ref>{{cite web |author=Peters, Glen |url=http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/309550/the_fourth_of_july_and_the_1812_overture.html?page=3 |title=The Fourth of July and the 1812 Overture: A History - Associated Content |accessdate=2008-02-16 |format= |work=}}</ref><ref name=hampton1812 /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/5116/percussion.htm |title=Percussion |accessdate=2008-02-26}}</ref> Other [[firearm]]s may also be used instead of cannon, such as a [[shotgun]] firing [[blank]]s.<ref name=hampton1812>{{cite web |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2008/01/tchaikovskys-1812-overture-getting-fullblown-treatment |title=Tchaikovsky's '1812 Overture' getting full-blown treatment |accessdate=2008-02-26 |publisher=HamptonRoads.com |author=Carrie White |last=White |first=Carrie}}</ref>

==Restoration==
Cannon recovered from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water, and [[Extractive metallurgy|electrolytic reduction treatment]] is required to forestall the process of corrosion.<ref>{{cite web | last = Welss | first = Carmen | title = Rescue Project "Endeavour Cannon" | publisher = Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife | url = http://fnpw.com.au/enews4/cannon.htm | accessdate = 2007-11-14}}</ref> The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the [[electrolyte]] and is then treated in [[tannic acid]], which prevents further [[rust]]ing and gives the metal an aesthetically pleasing bluish-black color.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.preservation.gc.ca/gallery/cannon_e.asp |title=CCI: Preserving My Heritage - Before & After Gallery - Cannon |accessdate=2008-02-22 |format= |work=}}</ref><ref name="union"/> After this process, cannon set for display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a [[wax]] sealant. A coat of [[polyurethane]] may also be painted over the wax sealant to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outside displays.<ref name="union">{{cite web |url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/Report6/union.htm |title=Civil War Union Cannon Conservation, CRL Report 5 |accessdate=2008-02-22 |format= |work=}}</ref>
