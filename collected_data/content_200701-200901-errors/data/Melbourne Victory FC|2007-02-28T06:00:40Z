'''Melbourne Victory FC''' are an [[Australia]]n professional [[football (soccer)]] [[football team|team]] based in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. They participate in the [[A-League]], and are currently the only team from the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] playing in the competition.

The club is the [[A-League 2006-07|2006-07 A-League]] [[List of A-League champions|premiership]] and [[List of A-League champions|championship]] winner. It is the only club to achieve the championship/premiership double[http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/amazing-archies-victory-march/2007/02/18/1171733611976.html] and will be one of two Australian representatives to the [[AFC Champions League 2008|2008]] [[AFC Champions League]].

==History==
Melbourne Victory were founded in [[2004]] after the announcement of a revamped domestic league in Australia.  The new [[A-League]] replaced the [[National Soccer League]], which was disbanded in 2004. Eight licenses were handed out by [[Football Federation Australia]]. 

FFA approved the Melbourne Victory consortium to be Melbourne's representative in the league, with [[Belgravia Leisure Pty Ltd]] backing the club. The Chairman and CEO of Belgravia Leisure, [[Geoff Lord]], was installed as the inaugural Chairman of Melbourne Victory F.C. 

[[Gary Cole (footballer)|Gary Cole]] (an ex-[[Australia national football (soccer) team|Socceroo]]) was hired to become Football Operations manager, and was soon joined by [[Ernie Merrick]], hired as head coach from the [[Victorian Institute of Sport]] (VIS). [[Archie Thompson]], a Socceroo who had been playing in Europe with [[Lierse S.K.]], was Melbourne Victory's first player signing. The club soon signed three more internationals for their squad - Socceroo [[Kevin Muscat]], Austrian [[Richard Kitzbichler]] and Belgian [[Geoffrey Claeys]].

The remainder of the squad was quickly assembled, although room was left for signings before Melbourne played its first competitive match against [[Adelaide United]] in a [[World Club Championship]] qualifier.

On [[October 27]] [[2005]], [[South Korea]]n electronics giant [[Samsung Group|Samsung]] became the club's major sponsor in a two year deal, one of the largest in Australian domestic football history.

Melbourne Victory were the first team to complete the [[A-League]] double in the history of the competition; clinching the premiership against the [[New Zealand Knights]] 4-0 at Olympic Park, then beating [[Adelaide United]] 6-0 in the grand final at a sold out [[Telstra Dome]] to take the championship.

==Stadium==
[[Image:Aleaguefinal3.jpg|right|thumb|350px|2006-07 A-League Grand Final at Telstra Dome]]
{{see|Telstra Dome|Olympic Park Stadium|Melbourne Rectangular Stadium}}

Melbourne Victory were originally based at the aging [[Olympic Park, Melbourne|Olympic Park]] stadium, where they played all home matches during the [[A-League 2005-06|2005-06 A-League season]].  This stadium has seated areas only on each side, with standing-room terraces on the north and south ends.

On the back of a then-record regular season attendance of 39,730 at the all-seater [[Telstra Dome]] for the match against [[Sydney FC]] on [[September 2]] [[2006]], it was announced that seven home matches would be moved to "the Dome". Only one match - against the struggling [[New Zealand Knights]] - would remain at Olympic Park.

This move to such a large stadium was viewed with skepticism by many, but proved to be an outstanding success, with the average attendance rising to over 27,000 during the season.  A new regular season record attendance of was achieved on [[December 8]], [[2006]] when 50,333 people watched the [[Victory|Melbourne Victory]] play out a 0-0 draw with [[Sydney FC]].  

Although this record still stands for an A-League home-and-away match, it was surpassed as a domestic [[football (soccer)|football]] attendance record on [[February 18]] [[2007]] when 55,436 people saw [[Melbourne|Melbourne Victory]] beat [[Adelaide United]] 6-0 in the [[A-League 2006-07|2006-07 A-League Season]] Grand Final.

Prior to the current season the club had planned to move to a new stadium being planned to the east of the current Olympic Park complex.  The new [[Melbourne Rectangular Stadium]] was originally expected to seat approximately 20,000 spectators (expandable to 25,000) and was to be completed in time for the start of the 2008-09 campaign. 

With Victory's overall [[A-League 2006-07|2006-07 A-League season]] home attendance average above 30,000, the new stadium will not meet the Victory's requirements if the clubs support continues to grow.  On [[December 5]] [[2006]], the club announced a desire for the stadium to have 35,000 seats.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/SPORT/Victory-weighs-up-stadium-options/2007/01/31/1169919391732.html
|title=Victory weighs up stadium options|date=[[2007-01-31]]|publisher=[[The Age]]}}</ref>

If the new stadium's capacity is not to the club's liking, Melbourne Victory FC have promised their fans that games will remain at Telstra Dome until a rectangular stadium of appropriate capacity is built. If Victory do not play out of the new stadium, it will be left with the [[Melbourne Storm]] as the sole tenant. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/soccer/jumbo-sized-headache/2007/01/31/1169919403670.html

==Club song==
'''Victory the Brave lyrics'''
''To the tune of "Scotland the Brave"''

Oh Melbourne, hear the sound of drumming<br />
Must be the Victory coming<br />
Pumped up and full of running<br />
Victory the brave<br />
<br />
Blue, white and silver flying<br />
Strike like a flash of lightning<br />
Revved up and full of fighting<br />
Victory the brave<br />
<br />
And in the heat of battle<br />
Stand up and show no fear<br />
Proud and courageous<br />
Marching on to Victory<br />
<br />
Oh Melbourne, hear the sound of drumming<br />
Must be the Victory coming<br />
Pumped up and full of running<br />
Victory the brave<br />
<br />

==Kit==
Melbourne Victory FC's kit colours are navy blue, silver and white, which encompass the traditional state sporting colours of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The club badge and away kit display a chevron, known colloquially as the "Big V", a symbol that has long been an identifier of Victorian sporting teams.

==Supporters==
Melbourne Victory is the only A-League team based in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and have a dedicated fan base - the club have consistently set records for A-League attendances. With the move to Telstra Dome during the 2006/07 season, large crowds have been a constant feature of Victory home games.  On [[February 18]], [[2007]], a capacity crowd of 55,436 attended the Grand Final against [[Adelaide United]] at the Telstra Dome.  This is the largest attendance on record for a domestic football match in Australia, surpassing the previous record of 50,333 set at the same venue earlier in the season.

Melbourne Victory has a number of supporter groups, each group with its own style of support.   These groups include ''BWB'' (Blue and White Brigade), ''M7C'' (May 7 Crew), ''SDC'' (Southern Death Crew), ''Flat Cap Crew'', ''BWB Youth'', ''Frontline'',''VRS'' and a small number of members associated with Melbourne Victory's original supporters group, ''UNION''. The British style of support generally stand at the North End of Telstra Dome, however it is refered to as the 'South End' because of the tradition started by the SDC and affiliates at the south end terrace of Olympic Park. The South End of Telstra Dome hosts the more European style of support led by the ''BWB'', however they are branded the 'Northern Terrace' because of ties to the club's original stadium.

==Rivalries==
[[Image:Mvfc billboard.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A billboard made by the MVFC supporters before a derby with Adelaide.]]

[[Sydney FC]] are promoted as Melbourne Victory's main rivals, even as the most heated rivalry in the A-League.  Given the short history of the league, this is primarily due to other historical competitions and rivalries between the cities of [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]].

Melbourne and [[Adelaide United]] have also developed a significant rivalry. In fact, some have argued that the Melbourne-[[Adelaide]] (or [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]-[[South Australia]] State rivaly) is even greater than the Melbourne-Sydney rivalry.<ref>Baum, Greg: [http://www.theage.com.au/news/soccer/intense-state-rivalry-dates-back-to-colonial-past/2007/02/16/1171405443111.html "Intense state rivalry dates back to colonial past"], ''[[The Age]]'', [[17 February]] [[2007]], News 7</ref> Both sides' traveling fans turn out in good numbers when the two teams clash. An incident during the Round 8 clash of the [[A-League 2006-07|2006/07 season]] saw Melbourne captain [[Kevin Muscat]] knock then Adelaide United coach [[John Kosmina]] from his chair in the technical area, as he was retrieving the play ball that had rolled under Kosmina's chair.  The Adelaide coach jumped to his feet and grabbed Muscat by the throat as the two exchanged words on the sideline. Muscat was given a yellow card, while Kosmina was sent to the stand and later received a four-match ban from the technical area for his part in the altercation. The two sides went on to contest the [[A-League 2006-07| 2006/07]] Grand Final, with Melbourne romping home 6-0.

==2006-07 Season==

[[Image:AL GF 2007 Celebrations.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Melbourne Victory post-match celebrations after winning the [[A-League 2006-07|2006-07 A-League]] [[Grand Final]].]]
Melbourne Victory had a successful [[A-League 2006-07|2006-07 A-League competition]], winning both the [[A-League]] [[List of A-League champions|championship]]) and [[List of A-League champions|premiership]]. The club therefore has the honour of being the first 'Double' winners in A-League history.
