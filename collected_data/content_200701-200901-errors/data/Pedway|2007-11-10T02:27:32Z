A '''pedway''' is an elevated or underground [[pedestrian]] walkway, often connecting [[urban area|urban]] high-rises to each other, other buildings, or the street. They are used as a quick way to move from building to building, away from [[traffic]] and inclement weather.  Two of the largest  networks of underground walkways are located in [[Canada]]. [[RÉSO]] in [[Montreal]] and [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] in [[Toronto]] each consist of approximately 30 km of underground walkways in the heart of their respective city centres.
