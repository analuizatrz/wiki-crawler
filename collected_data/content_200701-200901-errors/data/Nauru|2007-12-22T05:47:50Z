'''Nauru''' ({{pronEng|næˈuːruː}}), officially the '''Republic of Nauru''', is an [[island nation]] in the [[Micronesia]]n [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]. The nearest neighbour is [[Banaba Island]] in the [[Kiribati|Republic of Kiribati]], 300 km due east. Nauru is the world's smallest island nation, covering just 21&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km²]] (8.1&nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]), the smallest independent [[republic]], and the only republican state in the world without an official [[capital]].<ref name="CIA">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nr.html CIA World Fact Book] URL accessed 2006-05-02.</ref> 

Initially inhabited by [[Micronesia]]n and [[Polynesia]]n peoples, Nauru was [[annex]]ed and designated a '[[colony]]' by [[German Empire|Germany]] in the late 19th century, and became a [[League of Nations|mandate territory]] administered by [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]] following [[World War I]]. The [[island]] was occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]], and after the war entered into trusteeship again. Nauru achieved independence in 1968.

Nauru is a [[phosphate rock]] [[island]], and its primary economic activity since 1907 has been the export of phosphate mined from the island.<ref name="UN">[http://www.un.int/nauru/overview.html Republic of Nauru Permanent Mission to the United Nations] URL Accessed 2006-05-10</ref></small> With the exhaustion of phosphate reserves, its environment severely degraded by mining, and the trust established to manage the island's wealth significantly reduced in value, the government of Nauru has resorted to unusual measures to obtain income. In the 1990s, Nauru briefly became a [[tax haven]] and [[money laundering]] center. Since 2001, it has accepted aid from the Australian government; in exchange for this aid, Nauru houses an offshore [[Nauru detention centre|detention centre]] that holds and processes [[right of asylum|asylum seekers]] trying to enter [[Australia]].  

== History ==
[[Image:Nauru Annexation Germany 1888.jpg|thumb|left|Nauru annexed in 1888 by Germany.]]
{{main|History of Nauru}}
Nauru was first settled by Micronesian and Polynesian peoples at least 3,000 years ago.<ref name="UNCCD">Nauru Department of Economic Development and Environment. 2003. [http://www.unccd.int/cop/reports/asia/national/2002/nauru-eng.pdf First National Report To the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)] URL Accessed 2006-05-03</ref> There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru, which are represented in the 12-pointed star in the nation's [[flag of Nauru|flag]]. The [[Nauruan people]] called their island "Naoero"; the word "Nauru" was later created from "Naoero" so that [[English language|English]] speakers could easily pronounce the name. Nauruans traced their descent on the [[matrilineal|female side]]. Naurans subsisted on [[coconut]] and [[Pandanus tectorius|pandanus fruit]], and caught juvenile [[Milkfish|''ibija'' fish]], [[Acclimatization|acclimated]] them to fresh water conditions and raised them in [[Buada Lagoon]], providing an additional reliable source of food.<ref>McDaniel, C. N. and Gowdy, J. M. 2000. ''Paradise for Sale''. University of California Press ISBN 0-520-22229-6 pp 13–28</ref>

British Captain [[John Fearn]], a whale hunter, became the first Westerner to visit the island in 1798, and named it Pleasant Island. From around the 1830s, Nauruans had contact with Europeans from whaling ships and traders who replenished their supplies at the island. Around this time, beachcombers and deserters began to live on the island. The islanders traded food for alcoholic [[Palm wine|toddy]] and firearms; the firearms were used during the 10-year [[Nauruan Tribal War|war]] which began in 1878 and resulted in a reduction of the population from 1400 to 900 persons. The island was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany's [[Marshall Islands]] Protectorate; they called the island Nawodo or Onawero. The arrival of the Germans ended the war; social changes brought about by the war established Kings as rulers of the island, the most widely known being King [[Auweyida]]. Christian missionaries from the [[Gilbert Islands]] also arrived at the island in 1888.<ref>Ellis, A. F. 1935. ''Ocean Island and Nauru - their story''. Angus and Robertson Limited. pp 29–39</ref>

Phosphate was discovered on the island in 1900 by prospector [[Albert Fuller Ellis|Albert Ellis]] and the Pacific Phosphate Company started to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany; they exported their first shipment in 1907.<ref>Ellis, A. F. 1935. ''Ocean Island and Nauru - their story''. Angus and Robertson Limited. pp 127–139</ref> Following the outbreak of World War I, the island was captured by Australian forces in 1914. After the war, the [[League of Nations]] gave the UK a trustee mandate over the territory, which it agreed to share with Australia and New Zealand in 1923.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1923/11.html Agreement between Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom] regarding Nauru]</ref> The three governments signed a Nauru Island Agreement in 1919, creating a board known as the [[British Phosphate Commission]] (BPC), which took over the rights to phosphate mining.

Arrangements were made by the BPC to repatriate Nauruans from Chuuk, and they were returned to Nauru by the BPC ship ''Trienza'' in January 1946.<ref>Garrett, J. 1996. ''Island Exiles''. ABC. ISBN 0-7333-0485-0. pp176–181 </ref> In 1947, a trusteeship was approved by the [[United Nations]], and Australia, NZ and the UK again became trustees of the island. Nauru became self-governing in January 1966, and following a two-year constitutional convention, became independent in 1968, led by founding president [[Hammer DeRoburt]]. In 1967, the people of Nauru purchased the assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners, and in June 1970, control passed to the locally owned [[Nauru Phosphate Corporation]]. Income from the exploitation of phosphate gave Nauruans one of the highest living standards in the Pacific.

In 1989, the country took legal action against Australia in the [[International Court of Justice]] over Australia's actions during its administration of Nauru, in particular, Australia's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining.<ref>Highet, K and Kahale, H. 1993. Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru. ''The American Journal of International Law'' 87:282–288</ref> The action led to an out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of Nauru. Diminishing phosphate reserves has led to economic decline in Nauru, which has brought increasing political instability since the mid-1980s. Nauru had 17 changes of administration between 1989 and 2003.<ref name="DFAT">Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Dowiyogo died in office in March 2003 and [[Ludwig Scotty]] was elected President. Scotty was re-elected to serve a full term in October 2004. 

In recent times, a significant proportion of the country's income has come in the form of aid from Australia. In 2001, the ''[[MV Tampa]]'', a [[Norway|Norwegian]] ship which had rescued 433 [http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=130456] refugees (from various countries including [[Afghanistan]]) from a stranded 20-metre (65&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) boat and was seeking to dock in Australia, was diverted to Nauru as part of the [[Pacific Solution]]. Nauru continues to operate the Nauru detention centre in exchange for Australian aid. In November 2005,  two refugees remained on Nauru from those first sent there in 2001,<ref name="TheAge">Gordon, M. November 5, 2005.

Nauru is a [[republic]] with a [[parliamentary system]] of government. The president is both the [[head of state]] and of [[head of government|government]]. An 18-member [[unicameral]] parliament is elected every three years. The parliament elects a president from its members, who appoints a cabinet of five to six members. Nauru does not have a formal structure for political parties; candidates typically stand as independents. 15 of the 18 members of the current parliament are independents, and alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties.<ref name="DFAT">Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Since 1992, local government has been the responsibility of the Nauru Island Council (NIC). The NIC has limited powers and functions as an advisor to the national government on local matters. The role of the NIC is to concentrate its efforts on local activities relevant to Nauruans. An elected member of the Nauru Island Council cannot simultaneously be a member of parliament.<ref>Ogden, M.R. [http://www2.hawaii.edu/~ogden/piir/pacific/nauru.html Republic of Nauru] URL Accessed 2006-05-02.</ref> [[Land tenure]] in Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, which is owned by individuals and family groups; government and corporate entities do not own land and must enter into a lease arrangement with the landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own lands.<ref name="UNCCD"><ref name="UNCCD">Nauru Department of Economic Development and Environment. 2003.

Nauru has a complex legal system. The Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice, is paramount on [[Constitution of Nauru|constitutional issues]]. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions, but Appellate Court rulings can be appealed to the [[High Court of Australia]];<ref>''Nauru (High Court Appeals)'' Act (Australia) 1976. [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ncaa1976254 Australian Legal Information Institute] URL Accessed 2006-08-07</ref> in practice, this rarely happens. Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. Finally, there also are two quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.<ref name="State Department">[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/16447.htm State Department Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs September 2005] URL Accessed 2006-05-11</ref></small>

Nauru has no armed forces; under an informal agreement, defence is the responsibility of Australia. There is a small police force under civilian control.<ref name="CIA">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nr.html CIA World Fact Book] URL Accessed 2006-05-02</ref></small>

{{main|Foreign relations of Nauru}}

Following independence in 1968, Nauru joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] as a Special Member, and became a full member in 2000.<ref name="UN">[http://www.un.int/nauru/overview.html Republic of Nauru Permanent Mission to the United Nations] URL Accessed 2006-05-10</ref></small> Nauru was admitted to the [[Asian Development Bank]] in 1991 and to the UN in 1999. It is a member of the [[Pacific Islands Forum]], the South Pacific Regional Environmental Program, the South Pacific Commission, and the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission. The US [[Atmospheric Radiation Measurement]] Program operates a climate-monitoring facility on the island.

Nauru and Australia have close diplomatic ties. In addition to informal defence arrangements, the September 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between the two countries provides Nauru with financial aid and technical assistance, including a Secretary of Finance to prepare Nauru's budget, and advisers on health and education. This aid is in return for Nauru's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed.<ref name="DFAT">Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. [http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/nauru/nauru_brief.html Republic of Nauru Country Brief - November 2005] URL accessed on 2006-05-02.</ref> Nauru uses the [[Australian dollar]] as its official currency.

Nauru has used its position as a member of the UN to gain financial support from both [[Taiwan]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] by changing its position on the [[political status of Taiwan]]. During 2002, Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on [[21 July]]. This move followed China's promise to provide more than [[United States dollar|US$]]60 million in aid. In response, Taiwan severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later. Nauru later re-established links with Taiwan on [[14 May]] [[2005]],<ref>AAP. May 14 2005. [http://taiwansecurity.org/AFP/2005/AFP-140505.htm Taiwan Re-establishes Diplomatic Ties with Nauru] URL Accessed 2006-05-05</ref> and diplomatic ties with China were officially severed on [[31 May]] [[2005]]; however, the PRC continues to maintain a diplomatic presence in the island nation.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Nauru}}
[[Image:View of Aiwo and Civic Center.jpg|thumb|right|Aiwo]]
Nauru is a small, oval-shaped island in the western Pacific Ocean, 42 km (26 mi.) south of the [[Equator]]. It is about one-tenth the size of [[Washington, DC]]. The island is surrounded by a coral reef, exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles. The reef is bound seaward by deep water, and inside by a sandy beach. The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a [[seaport]], although sixteen artificial [[Canals in Nauru|canals]] have been made in the reef to allow small boats to access the island. A 150&ndash;300 m (about 500&ndash;1000 ft.) wide fertile coastal strip lies landward from the beach. Coral cliffs surround the central plateau, which is known on the island as Topside. The highest point of the plateau is 65 m (213 ft) above sea level. The only fertile areas are the narrow coastal belt, where [[coconut palm]]s flourish. The land surrounding [[Buada Lagoon]] supports [[banana]]s, [[pineapple]]s; vegetable,  [[Pandanus tectorius|pandanus trees]] and indigenous hardwoods such as the [[Calophyllum inophyllum|tomano tree]] are cultivated. The population of the island is concentrated in this coastal belt and around Buada Lago. 

[[Image:Nauru satellite.jpg|left|230px|thumb|An aerial image of Nauru in 2002 from the U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program. Regenerated vegetation covers 63% of land that was mined.<ref name = "climate">Republic of Nauru. 1999. [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf Climate Change Response Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] URL Accessed 2006-05-03</ref>]]
Nauru was one of three great [[guano|phosphate rock]] islands in the Pacific Ocean (the others are Banaba (Ocean Island) in [[Kiribati]] and Makatea in [[French Polynesia]]); however, the phosphate reserves are nearly depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to 15 m (49 ft) high. A century of mining has stripped and devastated four-fifths of the land area. Mining has also had an impact on the surrounding [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] with 40% of marine life considered to have been killed by silt and phosphate run off.<ref name = "climate">Republic of Nauru. 1999. [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf Climate Change Response Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] URL accessed 2006-05-03.</ref>

There are limited natural fresh water resources on Nauru. Roof [[rainwater tank|storage tanks]] collect rainwater, but islanders are mostly dependent on a single, aging [[Desalination|desalination plant]]. Nauru's climate is hot and extremely humid year-round, because of the proximity of the land to the [[Equator]] and the ocean. The island is affected by [[monsoon]]al rains between November and February. Annual rainfall is highly variable and influenced by the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]], with several recorded droughts.<ref name="UNCCD">Nauru Department of Economic Development and Environment. 2003. [http://www.unccd.int/cop/reports/asia/national/2002/nauru-eng.pdf First National Report To the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)] URL Accessed 2006-05-03</ref> The temperature ranges between 26 and 35&nbsp;°C (79 and 95&nbsp;°F) during the day and between 25 and 28&nbsp;°C (77 and 82&nbsp;°F) at night. As an island nation, Nauru may be vulnerable to [[climate change|climate]] and [[Sea level rise|sea level change]], but to what degree is difficult to predict; at least 80% of the land area of Nauru is well elevated, but this area will be uninhabitable until the phosphate mining rehabilitation program is implemented.<ref name = "climate">Republic of Nauru. 1999. [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf Climate Change Response Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] URL Accessed 2006-05-03</ref>

There are only sixty recorded [[vascular plant]] species native to the island, none of which are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]]. Coconut farming, mining and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation.<ref name="UNCCD">Nauru Department of Economic Development and Environment. 2003. [http://www.unccd.int/cop/reports/asia/national/2002/nauru-eng.pdf First National Report To the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)] URL Accessed 2006-05-03</ref> There are no native land mammals; there are native birds, including the endemic [[Nauru Reed Warbler]], insects and land crabs. The [[Polynesian Rat]], cats, dogs, pigs and chickens have been introduced to the island.

== Economy ==
[[Image:Karst following phosphate mining on Nauru.jpg|thumb|right|[[Limestone]] pinnacles remain after phosphate mining.]]

{{main|Economy of Nauru}}
Nauru's economy depends almost entirely on declining phosphate deposits from [[guano]]; there are few other resources, and most necessities are imported.<ref name="Mining">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/332164.stm Big tasks for a small island] URL Accessed 2006-05-10</ref></small> Small-scale mining is still conducted by the NPC. The government places a percentage of the NPC's earnings in the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The Trust manages long-term investments, intended to support the citizens once the phosphate reserves have been exhausted. However, a history of bad investments, financial mismanagement, overspending and corruption has reduced the Trust's fixed and current assets. For example, [[Nauru House]] in [[Melbourne]] was sold in 2004 to finance debts and [[Air Nauru|Air Nauru's]] only [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-400]] was repossessed in December 2005 - though the aircraft was replaced in June of the next year with a [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-300]] model, and normal service was resumed by the company.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/17/1082140116981.html?from=storyrhs Receivers take over Nauru House].

Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy, because there are few facilities for tourists; the [[Menen Hotel]] and [[OD-N-Aiwo Hotel]] are the only hotels on the island.

In the 1990s, Nauru became a [[tax haven]] and offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee. The inter-governmental [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF)]] then identified Nauru as one of 15 "non-cooperative" countries in its fight against [[money laundering]]. Under pressure from FATF, Nauru introduced anti-avoidance legislation in 2003, following which foreign [[hot money]] flowed out of the country. In October 2005, this legislation—and its effective enforcement—led the FATF to lift the non-cooperative designation.<ref>FATF. October 13, 2005.

{{main|Culture of Nauru}}
[[Image:Linkbelt1999-Finalspiel.jpg|right|thumb|230px|The 1999 [[Australian rules football]] grand final, played at Linkbelt Oval]]
Nauruans descended from Polynesian and Micronesian seafarers who [[Nauruan indigenous religion|believed]] in a female deity, Eijebong, and a spirit land, an island called Buitani. Two of the 12 original tribal groups became extinct in the 20th century. [[Angam Day]], held on [[October 26]], celebrates the recovery of the Nauruan population after the two world wars, which together reduced the indigenous population to fewer than 1500. The displacement of the indigenous culture by colonial and contemporary, western influences is palpable. Few of the old customs have been preserved, but some forms of traditional music, arts and crafts, and fishing are still practised.

There is no daily news publication, but there are several weekly or fortnightly publications, including the ''Bulletin'', the ''Central Star News'' and ''The Nauru Chronicle''. There is a state-owned television station, Nauru Television (NTV) which broadcasts programmes from New Zealand, and there is a state-owned non-commercial radio station, Radio Nauru, which carries items from [[Radio Australia]] and the [[BBC]].<ref>BBC News.

[[Australian rules football]] is the most popular sport in Nauru; there is an [[Australian rules football in Nauru|elite national league]] with seven teams. All games are played at the island's only stadium, [[Linkbelt Oval]]. Other sports popular in Nauru include [[softball]], [[cricket]], [[golf]], [[sailing]], [[tennis]], and [[football (soccer)|soccer]]. Nauru participates in the [[Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth]] and [[Summer Olympic Games]], where it has been successful in [[weightlifting]]; [[Marcus Stephen]] has been a prominent medallist and was elected to parliament in 2003.  Nauru's two best tennis players, David Detudamo and his sister [[Angelita Detudamo]], are currently under athletic scholarships in the United States.  David plays for Cameron University in Oklahoma and Angelita plays for Collin County in Texas. 

A traditional activity is catching [[Noddy (tern)|noddy]] birds when they return from foraging at sea. At sunset, men stand on the beach ready to throw their [[lasso]] at the incoming birds. The Nauruan lasso is supple rope with a weight at the end. When a bird approaches, the lasso is thrown up, hits or drapes itself over the bird, and then falls to the ground. The captured noddies are cooked and eaten.<ref> [http://www.banaban.com/natalie.htm  Banaba/Ocean Island News]. URL Accessed 2006-05-11.</ref>
