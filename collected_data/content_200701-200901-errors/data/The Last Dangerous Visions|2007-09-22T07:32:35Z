'''''The Last Dangerous Visions''''' was planned to be a sequel to the [[science fiction]] [[short story]] [[anthology|anthologies]] ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' and ''[[Again, Dangerous Visions]]'', originally published in 1967 and 1972 respectively.  It is edited by [[Harlan Ellison]]. 

The projected third collection was started but controversially never finished.  It has become something of a legend in science fiction as the genre's most famous unpublished book. It was originally announced for publication in 1973, but other work demanded Ellison's attention and the anthology has not seen print to date. He has come under criticism for his treatment of some writers who submitted their stories to him, whom some estimate to number nearly 150 (and many of whom have died in the ensuing three decades since the anthology was first announced). 

Various difficulties delayed publication many times.  As recently as May of 2007, Ellison has said that he still wants to get the book out <ref>http://www.newsarama.com/general/Ellison/interview_p2.html</ref>.

[[United Kingdom|British]] author [[Christopher Priest (science fiction writer)|Christopher Priest]], whose story "An Infinite Summer" had been accepted for the collection, wrote a lengthy critique of Ellison's failure to complete the project, published as "The Last Deadloss Visions" in the UK and, in book form, as ''The Book on the Edge of Forever'' (an allusion to the Ellison-written ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode ''[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]'') by [[Fantagraphics Books]] in the US.  The essay was once available online, but Priest has since requested the essay be withdrawn from the [[Internet]].

==Alternative publication of stories intended for the book==

One story destined for ''Last Dangerous Visions'', "Himself in Anachron" by [[Cordwainer Smith]] (died 1966), did find publication in the [[1993]] collection of Smith's short fiction, ''The Rediscovery of Man''. In 1993 Ellison threatened to sue [[New England Science Fiction Association]] (NESFA) for publishing ''Himself in Anachron'', sold to Ellison for the book by his widow,<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/a76.html| journal=Ansible| title=ConFrancisco Continued| id=ISSN 0265-9816| volume=76| month=November| year=1993}}</ref> but later reached an amicable settlement.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Ansible| title=Infinitely Improbable| volume=77| url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/a77.html| month=December| year=1993| id=ISSN 0265-9816}}</ref> 

Other stories that have since been published are [[John Varley (author)|John Varley's]] "The Bellman", which was published in ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'' magazine in [[2003]] and has since been reprinted; and [[Joe Haldeman]]'s "Fantasy for Six Electrodes and One Adrenaline Drip", which Haldeman had believed lost until finding an old carbon copy of the manuscript and which was finally published in his [[2006]] collection ''A Separate War and Other Stories''. 

In [[1999]], DAW Books published an original anthology entitled "Prom Night," edited by Nancy Springer (and Martin H. Greenberg, uncredited), which contains [[Fred Saberhagen]]'s ''LDV'' story, "The Senior Prom." And in [[2004]], Haffner Press published a coffee-table retrospective of the works of [[Jack Williamson]], ''Seventy-Five: The Diamond Anniversary of a Science Fiction Pioneer,'' which contains his ''LDV'' story, "Previews of Hell." 

In 2005 Haffner Press published a large reprint collection of [[Edmond Hamilton]]'s two "Star Kings" novels and [[Leigh Brackett]]'s three stories starring Eric Stark, called ''Stark and the Star Kings''. The title story is the long-lost tale by both writers which should have been published in ''Last Dangerous Visions''.

At the time of writing, 24 stories from the anthology have now been published and are marked with ** below.
