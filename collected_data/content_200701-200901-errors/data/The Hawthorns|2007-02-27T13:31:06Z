'''The Hawthorns''' is the home of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]] in [[West Bromwich]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[England]]. 

==History==
Hosting [[Association Football]] since [[September 3]] [[1900]], the ground was (depending on one's definition) either the first [[The Football League|Football League]] ground to be built in the [[20th century]] or the last built in the [[19th century]], the club moving there after the expiry of their lease on the old ''Stoney Lane'' ground. Concrete terracing was introduced into the ground in 1920, an electric [[turnstile]] aggregator for automatically calculating attendences in 1949 and the electric [[floodlights]] in 1957. In a more hi-tech move huge widescreen TV screens were introduced at the start of the 2002/3 season.

The ground used to be divided by the [[Birmingham]]/ [[Smethwick]] border, but was moved completely into the latter by a minor rationalisation of local government borders in the [[1960s]] and is now entirely in Sandwell.

Today, it is a 28,003 all-seater stadium. Its name derives from the [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] (''Crataegus'') previously sold from a [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] on the site. Notably, at an altitude of 551 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]], it is the highest ground among those of all 92 [[FA Premier League]] and [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs.

In December 2003, the board of directors unveiled plans to increase the stadium's capacity to 40,000 all-seated. But those plans have yet to be materialised, as Albion slipped out of the Premiership in 2006, and are unlikely to go ahead unless Albion ever establish themselves as a Premiership club.

During the mid-late 1990s there were plans for [[Moseley Rugby Football Club]] to share the ground, but these never materialised.

==Stands==
===Halfords Lane Stand===
Constructed: [[1979]] - [[1981]]<br>
Capacity: 5,110 (seated)

Running along the west edge of the pitch, the Halfords Lane Stand provided [[Very Important Person (person)|VIP]] seating before the advent of the new East Stand. The stand houses the main TV cameras as well as the press and commentary area.

===Birmingham Road End===
Constructed: [[1994]] - [[1995]]<br>
Capacity: 6,000 (seated)

Better known to supporters as the ''Brummie Road'', the traditional ''[[Birmingham]] Road End'' runs behind the goal, adjacent to the [[A41 road|A41]]. Traditionally housing the core of the home support, its role has been somewhat stolen by the ''[[Smethwick]] End'' in recent years. Between this stand and the East Stand lies the Woodman corner, named after the Woodman pub which stood just behind it until its demolition in 2004. The Woodman corner is home to a large [[throstle]] mascot, which was originally perched above the old (terraced) Woodman corner, but was housed in the Halfords Lane stand for several seasons until the stadium redevelopments were completed.

===Smethwick End===
Constructed: 1994 - 1995<br>
Capacity: 5,816 (seated)

Running behind the goal at the southern edge of the pitch, the Smethwick End houses the away supporters though they are generally only allocated part of the stand, the remainder housing the most vocal of the home support.

===East Stand===
Constructed: [[2001]]<br>
Capacity: 10,000 (seated)

Replacing the old ''Rainbow Stand'', the East Stand now houses the club's administration offices, club shop, club ticket office and corporate entertainment suites.
