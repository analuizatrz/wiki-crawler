==Music Career==
In the late '90s, she had major dance hits with the songs "In A Dream," "When I'm Gone," and "Can't We Try" (a duet with [[Collage (singer)|Collage]] and remake of the [[Dan Hill]] and [[Vonda Shepard]] 1987 hit song). All of these tracks appeared on her 1998 debut album entitled ''[[What Are You Lookin' At?]]''. She released a second album, ''[[Instant Pleasure]]'', in 2000. "[[Instant Pleasure]]" included the single "What U Did 2 Me" which made #101 pop in 2001.  Her best charting success is in Canada, where she is still active performing shows at clubs.  Her debut single "I Fell in love" distributed by the then BMG Canada hit #1 on the [[Canadian Singles Chart]] while the follow-up mega hit "In a Dream" was at #6 and is still a dance club anthem and a favourite amongst freestyle music enthusiasts nationwide. 

==Chart Success==
In 1996, "I Fell In Love" peaked at #61 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in early 1997.  It hit the #1 spot on the [[Canadian Singles Chart]] singles chart during that year making it the most successful [[Freestyle music|Freestyle]]/[[Dance music|Dance]] music single of the decade in [[Canada]]. The single also peaked at #9 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart.

The song, "In A Dream," the follow-up to "I Fell In Love" peaked at #72 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in late 1997. It was #6 on the Hot 100 [[Canadian Singles Chart]] and solidified Rockell's position on the artist roster of the then [[BMG Music Canada]]. It also peaked at #13 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart.

"Can't We Try" with Collage peaked at #59 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in 1998. The single peaked at #11 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart.

Rockell's lead off single to her sophomore album ''[[Instant Pleasure]]'', "What U Did 2 Me" bubbled under the [[Billboard Hot 100]] at #101...however, it was her best selling (and arguably biggest hit) single and it garnered her a music video. It fared much better on [[Dance Radio Airplay]] and [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] charts.

She also released "The Dance" (a cover of the [[Garth Brooks]] hit) and "Tears," but neither of these singles charted on the Hot 100. Both singles performed well on the [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] and [[Dance Radio Airplay]] charts. The song, "The Dance" peaked at #27 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart and "Tears" peaked at #16 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart.

In 2005, she came back with "L.O.V.E.", a limited independent release that had a trance remix by Lenny "Linus" Douglas and freestyle remixes by Russ Castella and Randy Weber Taylor, the original writer/producer of "In a Dream". It became a modest [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart hit. It also received some Dance radio airplay.

Spring 2007 sees Rockell back in the studio recording a new single "Playing my love".
