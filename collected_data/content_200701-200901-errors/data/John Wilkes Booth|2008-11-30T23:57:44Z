'''John Wilkes Booth''' (May 10, 1838 – April 26, 1865) was an American stage actor who assassinated [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on April 14, 1865. Lincoln died the next morning from a single gunshot wound to the back of the head, becoming the first American president to be assassinated. 

Booth was a member of the prominent 19th century [[Booth family]] of actors from [[Maryland]] and by the 1860s was a popular, nationally-ranked actor.<ref name=memoir>{{cite book|author=Clarke, Asia Booth (Terry Alford, ed.)|title=John Wilkes Booth: A Sister's Memoir|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson, Miss.|year=1996|isbn=0-87805-883-4}}</ref>{{rp|ix}} He was also a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer and expressed vehement dissatisfaction with the South's defeat in the [[American Civil War]]. He opposed Lincoln's proposal to extend [[Suffrage|voting rights]] to recently emancipated [[slavery in the United States|slaves]].

Booth, and a group of co-conspirators whom he led, planned to kill Abraham Lincoln, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]], and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Henry Seward, Sr.|William Seward]]  in a desperate bid to help the tottering Confederacy's cause. Although [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] had surrendered four days earlier, Booth believed the war was not yet over since Confederate General [[Joseph Johnston]]'s army was still fighting the [[Union Army]] under General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. Of the conspirators, only Booth was successful in carrying out his part of the plot.

Following the shooting, Booth fled by horseback to southern Maryland and eventually to a farm in rural northern [[Virginia]], where he was tracked down and killed by Union soldiers twelve days later. Eight others were tried and convicted and four were [[hanging|hanged]] shortly thereafter. Over the years, various authors have suggested that Booth might have escaped his pursuers and subsequently died many years later under a pseudonym.

==Background and early life==
His parents, the noted British [[Shakespeare in performance|Shakespearean]] actor [[Junius Brutus Booth]] and his wife Mary Ann Holmes, immigrated to the United States from England in 1821. They purchased a farm near [[Bel Air, Harford County, Maryland|Bel Air]] in [[Harford County, Maryland]], where John Wilkes Booth was born on May 10, 1838. He was named after the English [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] politician [[John Wilkes]], who the family claimed was a distant relative.<ref name=memoir />{{rp|33}}<ref>Booth's uncle Algernon Sydney Booth was the great-great-great-grandfather of [[Cherie Blair]] (née Booth), wife of former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]].{{spaces|2}}–{{spaces|2}}{{cite web|author=Westwood, Phil|title=The Lincoln-Blair Affair|url=http://www.genealogytoday.com/uk/columns/westwood/021025.html |publisher=Genealogy Today}}{{spaces|2}}–{{spaces|2}}{{cite web|author=Coates, Bill |title=Tony Blair and John Wilkes Booth |url=http://www.maderatribune.com/life/lifeview.asp?c=193252 |publisher=Madera Tribune |date=August 22, 2006}}</ref><ref name=CourtTV>{{cite web |last=Geringer |first=Joseph |title=John Wilkes Booth: A Brutus of His Age |work=Crime Library |publisher=[[Court TV]] |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/booth/1.html |accessdate= 2007-10-17}}</ref> Booth's later boyhood home, "Tudor Hall", was subsequently built on the family's Harford County property in 1847 and still stands today.<ref>John Wilkes Booth's boyhood home, "Tudor Hall", is located on [[Maryland Route 22]] near Bel Air.

''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''. September 8, 2008, p. 4).</ref> 
[[Image:Tudor Hall.jpg|thumb|left|"Tudor Hall" in 1865]]
As a boy, John Wilkes Booth attended the Bel Air Academy, where the headmaster described him as "Not deficient in intelligence, but disinclined to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered him. Each day he rode back and forth from farm to school, taking more interest in what happened along the way than in reaching his classes on time".<ref>Kimmel, Stanley. ''The Mad Booths of Maryland''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1940, p. 70.</ref><ref>The Bel Air Academy, originally the Harford Academy founded in 1814, is the forerunner of today's [[Bel Air High School (Bel Air, Maryland)|Bel Air High School]].</ref> In 1850–1851, he attended the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]-run Milton Boarding School for Boys located in [[Sparks, Maryland]] and later St. Timothy's Hall, an [[Episcopal Church of the United States|Episcopal]] school in [[Catonsville, Maryland]], beginning when he was 13&nbsp;years old.<ref name=memoir />{{rp|39&ndash;40}}<ref>The Milton Boarding School building in Sparks, Md., which John Wilkes Booth once attended, still stands and is now the ''Milton Inn'' restaurant.</ref> The Booth family also maintained a  city residence on Exeter Street in Baltimore in the 1840s&ndash;1850s.<ref name=Sun1931>{{cite news|last=McCardell|first=Lee|title=The body in John Wilkes Booth's grave|publisher=''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''|date=December 27, 1931}}</ref> As recounted by Booth's sister, [[Asia Booth|Asia Booth Clarke]], in her memoirs written in 1874, no one church was preeminent in the Booth household. Booth's mother was Episcopalian and his father was described as a "free spirit", preferring a Sunday walk along the Baltimore waterfront with his children to attending church. On January 23, 1853, the 14-year old Booth was finally [[Baptism|baptized]] at St. Timothy's Episcopal Church.<ref name=memoir />{{rp|44&ndash;45}} 

While attending the Milton Boarding School, the youth met a [[Gypsy]] [[fortune-teller]] who read his palm and pronounced a grim destiny, telling Booth that he would have a grand but short life, doomed to die young, meeting "a bad end". According to his sister, Booth wrote down the palm-reader's prediction and showed it to his family, often discussing its portents in moments of melancholy in later years.<ref name=memoir />{{rp|43&ndash;44}} 
  
By the age of 16, Booth was interested in the theatre and in politics, becoming a delegate from Bel Air to a rally by the anti-immigrant [[Know Nothing|Know Nothing Party]] for [[Henry Winter Davis]], their candidate for Congress in the 1854 elections.<ref name=memoir />{{rp|75}} Booth also began practicing elocution daily in the woods around Tudor Hall and studying the works of [[Shakespeare]]. At age 17, he had his first stage role as the Earl of Richmond in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' at Baltimore's Charles Street Theatre on August 14, 1855.<ref name=memoir />{{rp|77}}

==Theatrical career==
Following in the footsteps of his father (who had died in 1852) and his brothers, [[Edwin Booth|Edwin]] and [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.|Junius Brutus, Jr.]], John Wilkes Booth began performing extensively on stage in the late 1850s.<ref>Booth is sometimes connected to historical assassin [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], for whom Booth's father was named. On November 25, 1864, Booth acted in a version of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', where he played [[Mark Antony]]. His brother Edwin played the larger role of Brutus.{{spaces|2}}–{{spaces|2}}

[[Image:Booths Caesar.jpg|thumb|John Wilkes Booth, Edwin Booth and Junius Brutus Booth, Jr. in [[Shakespeare]]’s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' in 1864]] 
In 1857, Booth joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. At his request he was billed as "J.B. Wilkes", a pseudonym meant to divert attention away from his famous thespian family. In 1858, he was accepted as a member of the Richmond Theatre, Virginia, stock company, and became increasingly popular with audiences. Called "the handsomest man in America" by some reviewers, other critics were mixed in their estimation of his acting.<ref name=memoir />{{rp|ix}} He stood {{convert|5|ft|8|in|m}} tall, had jet-black hair, and was lean and athletic. He was also an excellent swordsman. His performances were often characterized by his contemporaries as acrobatic and intensely physical.<ref name=townsend>Townsend, George Alfred. ''The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth''. New York: Dick & Fitzgerald, 1865. ISBN 978-0976480532.</ref> A fellow actress once recalled that he occasionally cut himself with his own sword. As the 1850s drew to a close, Booth was becoming wealthy as an actor, earning $20,000 a year.<ref name=memoir />{{rp|ix}}

On December 2, 1859, Booth attended the hanging of militant  [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], who was executed for leading a raid on the Federal [[Armory (military)|armory]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] (in present-day [[West Virginia]]).<ref name=townsend/> Booth bought a uniform from a member of the Richmond Grays militia unit, which was heading for [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], and he joined the Grays, who stood guard for Brown's trial. When Brown was hanged, Booth stood at the foot of the scaffold.<ref name=CourtTV />

==The Civil War years==
Abraham Lincoln was elected president on November 6, 1860, and the following month Booth wrote a long speech that decried Northern [[abolitionism]] and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of [[slavery]]. On April 12, 1861, the Civil War erupted, and eventually eleven Southern states [[secession|seceded]] from the Union. Booth's family was from [[Maryland]], a [[Border states (Civil War)|border state]] which remained in the Union during the war despite a slaveholding portion of the population that favored the Confederacy. Because the secession of Maryland would leave [[Washington, D.C.]] an indefensible [[enclave]] within the Confederacy, Lincoln declared [[martial law]] in Maryland and ordered the imprisonment of pro-secession Maryland political leaders at [[Ft. McHenry]] to prevent the state's secession, a move that many, including Booth, viewed as [[unconstitutional]].<ref>Kauffman, Michael W. ''American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies''. Random House, 2004. ISBN 037550785X. pp. 104–114.</ref>

Although Booth was pro-Confederate, his family, like many Marylanders, was divided, and to preserve harmony among his brothers, Booth promised his mother that he would not enlist in the [[Confederate Army]]. As a popular actor in the 1860s, he travelled extensively to perform in both North and South, and as far west as [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].<ref name=townsend/> He further enriched himself by investments in land and oil wells. According to his sister Asia, Booth confided to her that he also used his position to smuggle [[quinine]] to the South during his travels there, helping the Confederacy obtain the needed drug despite the Northern blockade.<ref name=memoir />{{rp|83}} 

Booth was outspoken in his love for the South, and equally outspoken in his hatred for Lincoln. As the Civil War went on, Booth increasingly quarreled with his brother Edwin, who declined to make any stage appearances in the South and refused to listen to John Wilkes' fiercely partisan denunciations of the North and President Lincoln.<ref name=memoir />{{rp|81&ndash;84}} In early 1862, Booth was arrested by a provost marshal in [[Saint Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] for making anti-government remarks. 

Booth and Lincoln crossed paths on several occasions. Lincoln was an avid theater-goer and especially loved Shakespeare. On November 9, 1863, Lincoln saw Booth in Charles Selby's ''The Marble Heart'' at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln sat in the same "presidential box" in which he would later be assassinated.<ref name=CourtTV />

Booth made a final appearance at Ford's on March 18, 1865, when he played Duke Pescara in ''The Apostate'', in what was the last appearance of his career.<ref name=memoir />{{rp|87}} However, Booth's family were long time friends with [[John T. Ford]], the theater's owner, and Booth was in and out of the theater so often during the war that he even had his mail sent there.<ref name=townsend/> This granted Booth complete access to Ford's Theatre, day and night.

==Plotting to kidnap Lincoln==
[[Image:Soldiers-Home-Lincoln-Cottage.jpg|thumb|Booth's plan was to kidnap Lincoln from the Old Soldiers Home]]
By 1864, the tide of the war had shifted in the North's favor. The North halted prisoner exchange in an attempt to diminish the size of the Confederate Army, and because the Confederates refused to exchange captured [[African-American]] soldiers. Booth began devising a plan to kidnap Lincoln from his summer residence at the [[President Lincoln and Soldiers' Home National Monument|Old Soldiers Home]] three miles (5 [[km]]) from the White House and smuggle him across the [[Potomac]] and into [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. He would be exchanged for the release of around 10,000&nbsp;Southern soldiers held captive in Northern prisons. He successfully recruited his old friends [[Samuel Arnold (Lincoln conspirator)|Samuel Arnold]] and [[Michael O'Laughlin]] as accomplices.<ref>Thomas, Benjamin P. ''Abraham Lincoln, a Biography''. New York: Random House, 1952.</ref>

In the summer of 1864, Booth met with several well-known Confederate sympathizers at [[The Parker House]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. In October 1864, he made an unexplained trip to [[Montreal]]. At the time, Montreal was a well-known center of clandestine Confederate activities. He spent ten days in the city and stayed for a time at St. Lawrence Hall, a meeting place for the [[Confederate Secret Service]], and met at least one blockade runner there. It is possible that it was here that he also met Confederate Secret Service director [[James D. Bulloch]], as well as [[George Nicholas Sanders]], a one-time U.S. ambassador to Britain. Booth is believed to have been active in the "[[Knights of the Golden Circle]]", described as a "nest of 'Secesh' spies" (that is, pro-[[secessionist]]).<ref name=CourtTV /> 

There has been much scholarly attention devoted to why Booth was in Montreal at this time, and what he was doing there. No solid evidence has ever linked Booth's kidnapping or assassination plots to a conspiracy involving any elements of the Confederate government, although this possibility had been explored at some length in two books; Nathan Miller's ''Spying For America'' and William Tidwell's ''Come Retribution: the Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln''.   

Booth began to devote more and more of his energy and money to his plot to kidnap Lincoln after his re-election in early November 1864. He assembled a loose-knit band of Southern sympathizers, including [[David Herold]], [[George Atzerodt]], [[John Surratt]], and [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]] (also known as Lewis Payne). They began to meet routinely at the boarding-house of Surratt's mother, Mrs. [[Mary Surratt]].

On November 25, 1864, he performed for the only time with his two brothers, [[Edwin Booth|Edwin]] and [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.|Junius]], in a single engagement production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' at the [[Winter Garden Theatre (1850)|Winter Garden Theatre]] in [[New York]].<ref name=memoir />{{rp|87}} The proceeds went towards a statue of Shakespeare for [[Central Park]] which still stands today. The performance was interrupted by a failed attempt by clandestine Confederate agents to burn down several hotels, and by extension the city of New York, with [[Greek fire]]. One of the hotels was next door to the theater, but the fire was quickly extinguished. The following morning, Booth argued bitterly with his brother, Edwin, about Lincoln and the war. 

Booth also railed against Lincoln in conversations with his sister [[Asia Booth|Asia]], saying, "That man's appearance, his pedigree, his coarse low jokes and anecdotes, his vulgar similes, and his policy are a disgrace to the seat he holds. He is made the tool of the North, to crush out slavery."<ref name=memoir />{{rp|88}} As the Confederacy's imminent defeat became more certain in 1865, Booth decried the end of slavery and Lincoln's election to a second term, "making himself a king", the disgruntled actor fumed, in "wild tirades", his sister recalled.<ref name=memoir />{{rp|89}} 

Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration, on March 4, 1865, as the invited guest of his secret fiancée, Lucy Hale. (Lucy's father, [[John P. Hale]], was Lincoln's minister to Spain.) In the crowd below were Powell, Atzerodt, and Herold. There seems to have been no attempt to kidnap or assassinate Lincoln during the inauguration. Later, however, Booth remarked about "what a wonderful chance" he had to shoot Lincoln, if he had so chosen.<ref name=CourtTV />

On March 17, Booth learned at the last minute that Lincoln would be attending a performance of the play ''Still Waters Run Deep'' at a hospital near the Soldier's Home. Booth assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier's Home in the attempt to kidnap Lincoln en route to the hospital, but the president never showed up. Booth later learned that the President had changed his plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington, where Booth was staying at the time.<ref name=CourtTV />

==The assassination==

On April 12, after hearing the news that [[Robert E. Lee]] had surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House]], Booth told [[Louis J. Weichmann]], a friend of John Surratt, and a boarder at Mary Surratt's house, that he was done with the stage and that the only play he wanted to present henceforth was ''[[Venice Preserv'd]]''. Weichmann did not understand the reference.  ''Venice Preserv'd'' is about an assassination plot.

The previous day, Booth was in the crowd outside the White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window. When Lincoln stated that he was in favor of granting [[suffrage]] to the former slaves, Booth declared that it would be the last speech Lincoln would ever make.<ref name=CourtTV /> "Our cause being almost lost", Booth wrote in his journal, "something decisive and great ''must'' be done."<ref name=Donald>Donald, David Herbert. ''Lincoln''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995. ISBN 0-684-80846-3.</ref> 

On the morning of [[Good Friday]], April 14, 1865, Booth learned that the President and Mrs. Lincoln would be attending the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at Ford's Theatre. He immediately set about making plans for the assassination, which included a getaway horse waiting outside, and an escape route. Booth informed Powell, Herold and Atzerodt of his intention to kill Lincoln. He assigned Powell to assassinate [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] and Atzerodt to assassinate [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]]. Herold would assist in their escape into Virginia.<ref name=townsend/>

[[Image:John Wilkes Booth wanted poster new.jpg|thumb|[[Wanted poster]] for Booth, Surratt, and Herold]]
By targeting Lincoln and his two immediate successors to the office, Booth seems to have intended to decapitate the Union government and throw it into a state of panic and confusion. Booth also planned to assassinate the Union commanding general, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]; however, Grant's wife had promised to visit family and so they were heading to [[New Jersey]]. Booth had hoped that the assassinations would create sufficient chaos within the Union that the Confederate government could reorganize and continue the war. 

As a famous and popular actor, Booth was a friend of the owner of Ford's Theatre, [[John T. Ford]], and had free access to all parts of the theater. Boring a spyhole into the presidential box earlier that day, the assassin could see if his intended victim had made it to the play. That evening, at around 10 p.m., as the play progressed, John Wilkes Booth slipped into Lincoln's box and shot him in the back of the head with a .44&nbsp;caliber [[Derringer]]. Booth's escape was almost thwarted by Major [[Henry Rathbone]], who was present in the Presidential box with Mrs. [[Mary Todd Lincoln]].<ref name=townsend/>

Booth then jumped from the President's box and fell to the stage, injuring his leg when it snagged on a [[U.S. Treasury]] Guard flag used for decoration.<ref>One historian, Michael W. Kauffman, in his book ''American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies'' (ISBN 0-375-75974-3) written in 2004, contends that Booth actually broke his leg when his horse fell on him later in the escape, and that Booth's diary entry claiming it occurred jumping to the stage is a typical Booth dramatization.</ref> Witnesses said he shouted "''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]''" ([[Latin]] for "Thus always to tyrants", attributed to [[Marcus Junius Brutus#Influence|Brutus at Caesar's assassination]] and the Virginia state motto) from the stage, while others said he added, "The South is avenged."<ref name=Donald /><ref name=UMKC>{{cite web |last=Linder |first=Douglas |title=Biographic Sketch of John Wilkes Booth |publisher=[[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] |year=2002 |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lincolnconspiracy/booth.html#Death%20of |accessdate= 2007-10-16}} </ref>

==Aftermath &mdash; pursuit and death==
[[Image:Booth escape route.png|thumb|300px|Booth's escape route]]
In the ensuing pandemonium inside Ford's Theatre, Booth fled by a stage door to the alley, where he had a horse waiting, and galloped into southern Maryland, arriving before dawn on April 15 at the home of [[Samuel Mudd|Dr. Samuel Mudd]], who treated the injured leg.<ref>Mudd was convicted of conspiracy by a military court and sentenced to [[life in prison]] at [[Dry Tortugas National Park|Fort Jefferson]] in the [[Dry Tortugas]] islands, west of Key West, Florida. He was [[pardon]]ed in 1869.</ref> Booth and Herold remained in hiding as they continued to travel through southern Maryland before secretly crossing the Potomac into Virginia in April 21. 

Booth was surprised when he found little sympathy for his action, and wrote of his dismay in a journal entry on April 21, just before crossing the Potomac River into Virginia (''see map''), "[W]ith every man's hand against me, I am here in despair. And why; For doing what Brutus was honored for&nbsp;... And yet I for striking down a greater tyrant than they ever knew am looked upon as a common cutthroat".<ref>{{cite web |last=Linder |first=Douglas |title=Last Diary Entry of John Wilkes Booth |publisher=[[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] |year=2002 |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lincolnconspiracy/boothdiary.html |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref> 

A detachment of 25&nbsp;Union soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry Regiment, led by Lieutenant [[Edward P. Doherty]], and accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel [[Everton Conger]], pursued Booth through Southern Maryland and across the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Rappahannock River|Rappahannock]] Rivers to Richard H. Garrett's farm, just south of [[Port Royal, Virginia|Port Royal]], [[Caroline County, Virginia]]. Booth and his companion, [[David E. Herold]], had been led to the farm by William S.

Conger tracked down Jett and interrogated him, learning of Booth's location at the Garrett farm. Early in the morning of April 26, 1865, the soldiers caught up with Booth there. Trapped in a [[tobacco barn]], David Herold surrendered. Booth refused to surrender and the soldiers then set the barn ablaze.<ref name=UMKC /> Sergeant [[Boston Corbett]] fired at Booth &mdash; whether orders to shoot were given is uncertain &mdash; fatally wounding him in the neck.

Shortly after Booth's death, his brother Edwin wrote to his sister Asia, "Think no more of him as your brother; he is dead to us now, as he soon must be to all the world, but imagine the boy you loved to be in that better part of his spirit, in another world."<ref name=memoir />{{rp|92}} John Wilkes Booth's body was taken aboard the [[ironclad]] [[USS Montauk (1862)|USS ''Montauk'']] and brought to the [[Washington Navy Yard]] for identification and an [[autopsy]].
