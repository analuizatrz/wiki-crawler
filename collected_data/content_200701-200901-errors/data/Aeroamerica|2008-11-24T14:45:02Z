Aeroamerica was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in August 1973.<ref name="Airways_Formation">''Airways ([Zoeller, M., Aeroamerica – Deregulation Hopeful]'', p. 45, HPC Publishing, St Leonards on Sea, November 2008</ref> On [[January 9]], [[1974]] the [[Civil Aeronautics Board|CAB]] certificated Aeroamerica as a commercial airline operator.<ref name="Airways_Formation"/> This was followed by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]'s transfer of Standard Airways's dormant [[Air Operator Certificate|AOC]].<ref name="Airways_Formation"/>  

Aeroamerica commenced commercial operations later that year with six second-hand [[Boeing 720]] [[jetliners]].<ref name="World_Airline_Directory_75"/><ref name="Airways_Formation"/> One of these was sourced from [[Aer Lingus]] while the remaining five were all ex-[[Braniff Airways|Braniff]] examples.<ref name="World_Airline_Directory_75"/><ref name="Airways_Formation"/> (Aeroamerica's first aircraft had actually been delivered the year before, the same month the company had been incorporated.<ref name="Airways_Formation"/>)

Aeroamerica's Boeing 720s were configured in a 149-seat, single-class seating arrangement.<ref name="Annual_Report_74">''Berlin Airport Company - Summary of 1974 Annual Report, February 1975 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1975</ref><ref name="Airways_Development">''Airways ([Zoeller, M., Aeroamerica – Deregulation Hopeful]'', p. 46, HPC Publishing, St Leonards on Sea, November 2008</ref> Although Aeroamerica applied similar colour schemes featuring the same basic shapes to most of its aircraft, the actual colour combination differed on each individual plane.<ref name="May_75">''Berlin Airport Company, May 1975 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1975</ref>

Following the decision of US supplemental carrier [[Modern Air Transport|Modern Air]]'s [[parent company]] GAC Corp. to exit the West Berlin [[charter flight|charter market]] in October [[1974]], Aeroamerica acquired that airline's West Berlin traffic rights.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%200773.html?search=Modern%20Air%20Transport%20Inc.

In late October 1974 the newly formed airline stationed its first Boeing 720 at West Berlin's Tegel Airport for crew familiarisation flights.<ref name="Annual_Report_74"/> By March 1975 a further two Boeing 720s arrived at the airline's new Berlin Tegel base to fulfill a five-year [[charter flight|charter contract]] Aeroamerica had concluded with '''Berliner Flug Ring''', at the time West Berlin's leading [[package tour]] operator, to undertake a series of short- to medium-haul [[Inclusive Tour|IT]] [[charter flight]]s to the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Canary Islands]] from the start of the 1975 summer season.<ref>''Berlin Airport Company, April 1975 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1975</ref><ref name="Airways_BerlinOps_Start"/> Aeroamerica had taken over this contract from Modern Air.<ref name="Annual_Report_74"/><ref name="Airways_BerlinOps_Start"/> The decision to supply whole-plane [[charter airline]] seats to West Berlin's foremost package [[tour operator]] enabled the airline to take advantage of the fact that all airlines other than those headquartered in the [[United States|US]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[France]] - the airlines of the three Western victorious powers of [[World War II]] - were banned from operating at West Berlin.

By [[1976]] the size of the airline's [[Berlin]]-based fleet had doubled to six aircraft. These included four Boeing 720s as well as a [[Boeing 707]]-120B and a [[BAC One-Eleven]] 400.<ref name="Airways_BerlinOps_1976">''Airways ([Zoeller, M., Aeroamerica – Deregulation Hopeful]'', pp. 45/6, HPC Publishing, St Leonards on Sea, November 2008</ref> The latter two aircraft had originally belonged to [[American Airlines]].<ref name="Airways_BerlinOps_1976"/> During the summer of 1976 the bulk of Aeroamerica's fleet was based at Berlin Tegel, making it West Berlin's leading [[charter airline]] at the time.<ref>''Berlin Airport Company, August 1976 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1976</ref><ref name="Airways_BerlinOps_1976"/>

From [[1977]] the airline's worldwide [[business]], including its presence in Berlin, gradually declined.<ref name="Airways_Development"/><ref>''Berlin Airport Company, May 1977 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1977</ref>

On [[July 1]], [[1977]] 96% of Aeroamerica's US-based [[trade union|unionise]]d flight attendants voted in favour of [[industrial action|strike action]].<ref name="Airways_Development"/> Management attempted to break the flight attendants' strike by hiring [[contract labour]] from other airlines as well as by temporarily reducing the number of flight attendants per aircraft.<ref name="Airways_Development"/> During that period the airline had also faced isolated incidents of [[labor unrest|labour unrest]] from a small but vocal minority among its local [[Germany|German]] flight attendants who opposed the [[United States|American]] management's strict non-[[trades union|union]] policy for its Berlin operation.<ref>''Berlin Airport Company, May 1977 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1977</ref> The strike eventually collapsed as the peak summer season drew to a close by the end of August.<ref name="Airways_Development"/>

A number of short-term [[wet lease|wet]]- and [[sublease]]s Aeroamerica had concluded with other airlines partially compensated for the loss of business at its Berlin base.<ref name="Airways_LostBusinessCompensation_1977/8">''Airways ([Zoeller, M., Aeroamerica – Deregulation Hopeful]'', pp. 46-48, HPC Publishing, St Leonards on Sea, November 2008</ref> Aeroamerica's wet-/sublease customers included [[Egyptair]], [[Kıbrıs Türk Hava Yolları|Kıbrıs Türk Hava Yolları (KTHY)]] - the [[Northern Cyprus]] [[flag carrier]], [[Laker Airways]], [[Libyan Arab Airlines]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]] and [[Saudi Arabian Airlines|Saudia]].<ref name="Airways_LostBusinessCompensation_1977/8"/> For instance, the 1977 Kıbrıs wet lease, which ran for several months, entailed the stationing of a fully crewed Boeing 720 at [[Ercan airport|Ercan]] to operate the [[Turkey|Turkish]] carrier's scheduled route to [[Istanbul]].<ref name="Airways_LostBusinessCompensation_1977/8"/><ref>{{cite news | title= World Airline Directory 1978 | work= [[Flight International]] | date= March 1978}}</ref>

Aeroamerica acquired additional second-hand Boeing 720s and 707s during [[1978]] to enable it to exploit new business opportunities as a result of US [[airline deregulation]].<ref name="Airways_Deregulation_cum_Reliability_1978/9">''Airways ([Zoeller, M., Aeroamerica – Deregulation Hopeful]'', p. 47, HPC Publishing, St Leonards on Sea, November 2008</ref> In August of that year Aeroamerica commenced its first-ever fully fledged scheduled air service between [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport|Seattle-Tacoma]] and [[Spokane]].<ref name="Airways_Deregulation_cum_Reliability_1978/9"/> The company's new scheduled passenger flights were an immediate success.<ref name="Airways_Deregulation_cum_Reliability_1978/9"/> The following year the firm prepared to launch additional scheduled services linking Seattle-Tacoma and [[Portland Oregon|Portland, Oregon]], with [[Honolulu]].<ref name="Airways_Deregulation_cum_Reliability_1978/9"/>

The increasingly far-flung nature of the airline's operations overstretched its small fleet. This was compounded by the fleet's advanced age. The combination of these two factors resulted in growing reliability problems.<ref name="Airways_Deregulation_cum_Reliability_1978/9"/>

In January [[1979]] Berliner Flug Ring, Aeroamerica's main overseas [[business partner]], announced that it would not be renewing the five-year contract it had signed with the airline in late 1974, citing reliability issues as the main reason for its decision.<ref name="Airways_Deregulation_cum_Reliability_1978/9"/>

Aeroamerica closed its Berlin base at the end of the 1979 summer season.<ref>''Berlin Airport Company, April 1979 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports'', Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1979</ref><ref name="World_Airline_Directory_80"/>

Following this, Aeroamerica adopted a new [[corporate strategy|strategy]] that sought to refocus the airline as a low-fare [[transatlantic]] scheduled operator, beginning with a weekly service linking [[Miami]] with Berlin via [[Brussels]] or [[Amsterdam]] from the start of the following year's summer season.<ref name="Airways_Deregulation_cum_Reliability_1978/9"/>

As a result of growing financial difficulties, Aeroamerica voluntarily surrendered its operating permit during an informal meeting with the FAA at the end of 1979.<ref name="Airways_FinancialDifficulties_1979/80">''Airways ([Zoeller, M., Aeroamerica – Deregulation Hopeful]'', p. 48, HPC Publishing, St Leonards on Sea, November 2008</ref> This action on the airline's part in turn resulted in [[legal action]] brought against it by an [[aircraft lessor]] and [[British Airways]] over unpaid bills concerning the former Berlin operation, as well as the seizure of one of the company's aircraft at Tegel Airport.<ref name="Airways_FinancialDifficulties_1979/80"/>

The CAB's subsequent decision to revoke the firm's exempt permit effectively grounded Aeroamerica, resulting in a filing under [[Chapter 11]] of the US [[bankruptcy code]] seeking protection from [[creditor]]s while reorganising the business under the [[bankruptcy court]]'s supervision.<ref>''Airways ([Zoeller, M., Aeroamerica – Deregulation Hopeful]'', pp. 48/9, HPC Publishing, St Leonards on Sea, November 2008</ref>

On [[June 30]], [[1980]] the FAA suspended Aeroamerica's AOC.<ref name="Airways_Grounding">''Airways ([Zoeller, M., Aeroamerica – Deregulation Hopeful]'', p. 49, HPC Publishing, St Leonards on Sea, November 2008</ref>

On [[August 19]], [[1980]] the FAA agreed to restore Aeroamerica's AOC following a joint representation by the airline and its official creditors' committee.<ref name="Airways_Grounding"/> However, Aeroamerica's operations continued to be plagued by financial and maintenance issues. <ref name="Airways_Grounding"/>

Aeroamerica finally ceased operations during 1982, when the FAA grounded it for a maintenance violation regarding the operation of a non-[[airworthiness|airworthy]] aircraft.<ref name="World_Airline_Directory_83"/><ref name="ITL"/><ref name="Airways_Grounding"/>
