{{Two other uses|the measurement concept|the magazine|Time (magazine)||}}

There are two distinct views on the meaning of the word '''''time'''''.

One view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the [[universe]], a [[dimension]] in which events occur in [[sequence]], and time itself is something that can be measured. This is the [[Philosophical realism|realist]]'s view, to which [[Sir Isaac Newton]] subscribed, and hence is sometimes referred to as [[Newtonian time]].<ref>Newton's Views on Space, Time, and Motion - Stanford University http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-stm/</ref>

A contrasting view is that time is part of the fundamental human intellectual structure (together with [[space]] and [[number]]) within which we sequence events, [[quantity|quantify]] the duration of events and the intervals between them, and compare the [[motion (physics)|motions]] of objects. In this second view, time does not refer to any kind of entity that "flows", that objects "move through", or that is a "container" for events, and even might be said to not exist. This view is in the tradition of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]<ref> Leibniz on Space, Time, and Indiscernibles - Against the Absolute Theory -- Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/leib-met.htm#H7</ref> and [[Immanuel Kant]],<ref>Critique of Pure Reason - Lecture notes of G. J. Mattey, UC Davis http://www-philosophy.ucdavis.edu/mattey/kant/TIMELEC.HTM</ref><ref>Kant's Transcendental Idealism - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H4</ref> in which time, rather than being an objective thing to be measured, is part of the measuring system used by humans.

In [[physics]], time and space are considered [[fundamental unit|fundamental quantities]] (i.e. they cannot be defined in terms of other quantities because other quantities – such as [[velocity]], [[force]], [[energy]], etc – are already defined in terms of them). Thus the only definition possible is an [[operational definition|operational]] one, in which time is defined by the process of [[measurement]] and by the [[unit]]s chosen.

Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples are the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, heartbeats, etc. Currently, the unit of time interval (the [[second]]) is defined as a certain number of [[hyperfine]] transitions in [[Cesium]] atoms (see below).

Time has long been a major subject of [[science]], [[philosophy]], and [[art]]. Its measurement has occupied scientists and [[technologist]]s, and was a prime motivation in [[astronomy]]. Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value ("[[Time value of money|time is money]]") as well as personal value, due to an [[awareness]] of the limited time in each day and in human lifespans.

== Measurement ==

The origins of our current measurement system go back to the [[Sumer]]ian civilization of approximately 2000 [[BC]]. 
This is known as the [[sexagesimal]] system based on the number 60. 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour – and possibly a calendar with 360 (60x6) days in a year (with a few more days added on).
Twelve also features prominently, with roughly 12 hours of day and 12 of night, and 12 months in a year.<!--- use of 60 could not have appeared until people started using minutes - which they would not have done with sundials ---> 

=== Measurement devices ===
[[Image:Sundial Taganrog.jpg|thumb|right|Horizontal [[sundial]] in [[Taganrog]] (1833)]]

A large variety of [[Measuring instrument|device]]s have been invented to measure time. The study of these devices is called [[horology]].

An [[Egypt]]ian device dating to c.1500 BCE, similar in shape to a bent [[T-square]], measured the passage of time from the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings. At [[noon]], the device was turned around so that it could cast its shadow in the evening direction.<ref>Barnett, Jo Ellen ''Time's Pendulum: The Quest to Capture Time - from Sundials to Atomic Clocks'' Plenum, 1998 ISBN 0-306-45787-3 p.28</ref>

A [[sundial]] uses a [[gnomon]] to cast a shadow on a set of markings which were calibrated to the [[hour]]. The position of the shadow marked the hour in [[local time]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] records that the first sundial in Rome was looted from [[Catania]], [[Sicily]] (264 BCE), which gave the incorrect time for a century, until the markings appropriate for the latitude of [[Rome]] were used (164 BCE).<ref>Jo Ellen Barnett, ''Time's Pendulum'' p.31</ref> Noontime was an event which could be marked by the time of the shortest shadow on a sundial. This was used in Rome to judge when a court of law was open; lawyers had to be at the court by that time.

The most accurate timekeeping devices of the ancient world were the [[waterclock]] or ''clepsydra'', first found in Egypt. A waterclock was found in the tomb of [[pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep I]] (1525–1504 BCE). Waterclocks were used in [[Alexandria]], and then worldwide, for example in Greece, from c. 400 BCE. They could be used to measure the hours even at night, but required manual timekeeping to replenish the flow of water. [[Plato]] is said to have invented a water-based alarm clock. It depended on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which would float in a columnar vat. The vat would hold an increasing supply of water supplied by a cistern. Eventually the vessel would float high enough to tip over. The lead balls would then cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken his students at the Academy (378 BCE).<ref>Jo Ellen Barnett, ''Time's Pendulum'' p.38</ref> The [[Greeks]] and [[Chaldeans]] regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. In particular, Arab engineers improved on the use of waterclocks up to the Middle Ages.<ref>Jo Ellen Barnett, ''Time's Pendulum'' p.37</ref>

The [[hourglass]] uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time. They were used in navigation. [[Ferdinand Magellan]] used 18 glasses on each ship for his circumnavigation of the globe (1522).<ref>Laurence Bergreen, ''Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe'', HarperCollins Publishers, 2003, hardcover 480 pages, ISBN 0-06-621173-5</ref> The English word [[clock]] actually comes from French, Latin, and German words that mean [[Bell (instrument)|bell]]. The passage of the hours at sea were marked by bells, and denoted the time (see [[ship's bells]]). The hours were marked by bells in the abbeys as well as at sea.

Incense sticks and candles were, and are, commonly used to measure time in temples and churches across the globe. Waterclocks, and later, mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages. [[Richard of Wallingford]] (1292–1336), abbot of St. Alban's abbey, famously built a [[Clock#Early mechanical clocks|mechanical clock]] as an astronomical [[orrery]] about 1330.<ref>North, J. (2004) ''God's Clockmaker: Richard of Wallingford and the Invention of Time''. Oxbow Books. ISBN 1-85285-451-0</ref><ref>Watson, E (1979) "The St Albans Clock of Richard of Wallingford". ''Antiquarian Horology'' 372-384.</ref>

[[Image:Swatch Irony angle below.jpg|thumb|left|A contemporary [[quartz watch]]]]The most common devices in day-to-day life are the [[clock]], for periods less than a day, and the [[calendar]], for periods longer than a day. Clocks can range from [[watch]]es, to more exotic varieties such as the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. They can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical power, and regulated by a variety of means such as a [[pendulum]]. There are also a variety of different [[calendar]]s, for example the [[Lunar calendar]] and the [[Solar calendar]], although the [[Gregorian calendar]] is the most commonly used.

[[Image:ChipScaleClock2 HR.jpg|thumb|A chip-scale atomic clock]]
A "chronometer" is a portable timekeeper that meets certain precision standards.  Initially, the term was used to refer to the [[marine chronometer]], a timepiece used to determine [[longitude]] by means of [[celestial navigation]].  More recently, the term has also been applied to the [[chronometer watch]], a [[wristwatch]] that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency [[COSC]].  Over 1,000,000 "Officially Certified Chronometer" certificates, mostly for mechanical wrist-chronometers (wristwatches) with sprung balance oscillators, are being delivered each year, after passing the COSC's most severe tests and being singly identified by an officially recorded individual [[serial number]]. According to COSC, a chronometer is a high-precision watch capable of displaying the seconds and housing a movement that has been tested over several days, in different positions, and at different temperatures, by an official, neutral body (COSC).  Each movement is individually tested for several consecutive days, in five positions and at three temperatures. Any watch with the denomination "chronometer" is provided with a certified movement.

The most accurate type of timekeeping device is currently the [[atomic clock]], which are accurate to seconds in many thousands of years, and are used to calibrate other clock and timekeeping instruments. 
Atomic clocks use the spin property of the [[caesium]] atom as its basis, and since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium. [[International System of Units|SI]] defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the <sup>133</sup>Cs atom.

Today, the [[GPS]] global positioning systems in coordination with the [[Network Time Protocol|NTP]] network time protocol can be used to synchronize timekeeping systems across the globe.

The [[SI base unit]] for time is the [[SI]] [[second]]. From the second, larger units such as the [[minute]], [[hour]] and [[day]] are defined, though they are "non-SI" units because they do not use the decimal system, and also because of the occasional need for a [[leap-second]]. They are, however, officially accepted for use ''with'' the International System. There are no fixed ratios between seconds and [[month]]s or [[year]]s as months and years have significant variations in length.<ref name="si_units">{{cite book | title = The International System of Units (SI), 7th Edition | url = http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | year = 1998 | author = Organisation Intergouvernementale de la Convention du Métre | accessdate = 2006-06-13}}</ref>

The official SI definition of the second is as follows:<ref name="si_units">{{cite book | title = The International System of Units (SI), 7th Edition | url = http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | year = 1998 | author = Organisation Intergouvernementale de la Convention du Métre | accessdate = 2006-06-13}}</ref><ref name="second">{{cite web | title = Base unit definitions: Second | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html | publisher = [[NIST]] | accessdate = 2006-06-13}}</ref>

{{quotation|The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the [[caesium]] 133 atom at a temperature of 0 Kelvin.}} 

Previous to 1967, the second was defined as:

{{quotation|the fraction 1/31,556,925.9747 of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours [[ephemeris time]].}}

The definition of time is extremely important in [[science]] and for our everyday life. All known properties of time follow directly from this definition. For example, this definition of time coupled with the current definition of [[space]] makes our space and time to be [[Minkowski space|Minkowski]] [[space-time]] and makes [[special relativity]] theory absolutely correct ([[true]]) by definition.

=== World time ===
The measurement of time is so critical to the functioning of modern societies that it is coordinated at an international level. The basis for scientific time is a continuous count of seconds based on [[atomic clock]]s around the world, known as the [[International Atomic Time|International Atomic Time (TAI)]]. This is the yardstick for other time scales, including [[Coordinated Universal Time|Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)]], which is the basis for civil time.

Earth is split up into a number of [[time zone]]s. Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as an offset from UTC or [[Greenwich Mean Time]]. In many locations these offsets vary twice yearly due to [[daylight saving time]] transitions.

=== Sidereal time ===
[[Sidereal time]] is the measurement of time relative to a distant star (instead of solar time that is relative to the sun). It is used in astronomy to predict when a star will be overhead. Due to the rotation of the earth around the sun a sidereal day is slightly less than a solar day.

=== Chronology ===
Another form of time measurement consists of studying the [[past]]. Events in the past can be ordered in a sequence (creating a [[chronology]]), and be put into chronological groups ([[periodization]]). One of the most important systems of periodization is [[geologic time]], which is a system of periodizing the events that shaped the [[Earth]] and its life. Chronology, periodization, and interpretation of the past are together known as the study of [[history]].

==Time in religion and mythology==
{{see|Father Time}}

Many ancient philosophers wrote lengthy essays on time. A famous analogy compared the time of life to the passing of sand through an hourglass (a common measuring device for time in the past). The sand at the top is associated with the future, and, one tiny grain at a time, the future flows through the present into the past (associated with the sandpile at the bottom of hourglass). The past: ever expanding, the future: ever decreasing, but the future grains become amassed into the past through the present. This was widely discussed in around the 3rd century CE. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The earliest recorded philosophy of time was expounded by [[Ptahhotep]], who lived c. 2650–2600 BCE said: ''"Do not lessen the time of following desire, for the wasting of time is an abomination to the spirit."''

In the [[Old Testament]] book [[Ecclesiastes]], thought to have been written by [[Solomon]] (970–928 BCE), time (as the Hebrew word עדן, זמן ''`iddan(time) zĕman(season)'' is often translated) was traditionally regarded as a medium for the passage of [[predestination|predestined]] events. (Another word, זמן ''zman'', was current as meaning ''time fit for an event'', and is used as the modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] equivalent to the English word "time".)

<blockquote>
There is an appointed time (''zman'') for everything. And there is a time (’êth) for every event under heaven–<br />
A time (''’êth'') to give birth, and a time to die; A time to plant, and a time to uproot what is planted.<br />
A time to kill, and a time to heal; A time to tear down, and a time to build up.<br />
A time to weep, and a time to laugh; A time to mourn, and a time to dance.<br />
A time to throw stones, and a time to gather stones; A time to embrace, and a time to shun embracing.<br />
A time to search, and a time to give up as lost; A time to keep, and a time to throw away.<br />
A time to tear apart, and a time to sew together; A time to be silent, and a time to speak.<br />
A time to love, and a time to hate; A time for war, and a time for peace.<br />

                                                     – [[Ecclesiastes]] 3:1–8
</blockquote>


Around 500 BC [[Heraclitus]], held that the passage of time and the future both lay beyond the possibility of human influence: ''"Everything flows and nothing abides; everything gives way and nothing stays fixed.'' ''You cannot step twice into the same river, for other waters and yet others, go flowing on.'' ''Time is a child, moving counters in a game; the royal power is a child's."''

=== Linear and cyclical time ===
{{seealso|Time Cycles|Wheel of time}}
In general, the [[Judaeo-Christian]] concept, based on the [[Bible]], is that time is linear, with a beginning, the act of [[Creation theology|creation]] by [[God]]. The [[Christian]] view assumes also an end, the eschaton, expected to happen when [[Christ]] returns to earth in the [[Second Coming]] to judge the living and the dead. This will be the consummation of the world and time. [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]]'s [[City of God]] was the first developed application of this concept to world history. The Christian view is that God is uncreated and eternal so that He and the supernatural world are outside time and exist in [[eternity]].

The [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], have a concept of a [[wheel of time]], that regards time as [[social cycle theory|cyclical]] and [[quantic]] consisting of repeating ages that happen to every being of the Universe between birth and extinction. In recent years this cyclical vision of time has been embraced by theorists of [[quantic space-time]] and [[systems theory]].  This view has also not been scientifically verified.

==Time in philosophy==
{{main|Philosophy of time}}
In Book 11 of [[St. Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine's]] [[Confessions]], he ruminates on the nature of time, asking, "What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not."  He settles on time being defined more by what it is not than what it is.<ref>St.,Augustine, ''Confessions'', Book 11.  http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/augustine/Pusey/book11  (Accessed 5/26/07).</ref>  [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] believed time and [[space]] form a [[container]] for [[event]]s, which is as [[real]] as the [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s it contains.

{{quotation|Absolute, true, and mathematical time, in and of itself and of its own nature, without reference to anything external, flows uniformly and by another name is called duration. Relative, apparent, and common time is any sensible and external measure (precise or imprecise) of duration by means of motion; such a measure – for example, an hour, a day, a month, a year – is commonly used instead of true time.|''Principia''<ref name="newton">{{cite book | last = Newton | first = Isaac | authorlink = Isaac Newton | title = The Principia, 3rd edition | year = 1726}} Translated by I. Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1999.</ref>}}

In contrast to Newton's belief in absolute space, and closely related to Kantian time, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] believed that time and space are a conceptual apparatus describing the interrelations between events.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} The differences between Leibniz's and Newton's interpretations came to a head in the famous [[The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence|Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence]]. Leibniz thought of time as a fundamental part of an [[Abstract structure|abstract]] conceptual framework, together with [[space]] and [[number]], within which we sequence events, [[quantity|quantify]] their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, ''time'' does not refer to any kind of entity that "flows," that objects "move through," or that is a "container" for events.

[[Immanuel Kant]], in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', described time as an ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' intuition that allows us (together with the other ''a priori'' intuition, [[space]]) to comprehend sense experience.<ref name="kant"> {{cite book | last = Kant | first = Immanuel | authorlink = Immanuel Kant | title = The Critique of Pure Reason, 2nd edition | year = 1787}} translated by J. M. D. Meiklejohn, eBooks@Adelaide, 2004 - http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/kant/immanuel/k16p/k16p15.html</ref> With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as [[Substance theory|substance]]s, but rather both are elements of a systematic mental [[framework]] necessarily structuring the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Spatial [[measurement]]s are used to [[quantity|quantify]] how far apart [[object (philosophy)|object]]s are, and temporal measurements are used to quantify how far apart [[Phenomenon|event]]s occur. Similarly, [[Schopenhauer]] stated in the preface to his ''On the Will in Nature'' that "Time is the condition of the ''possibility'' of succession." {{Fact|date=September 2007}}

In [[Existentialism]], time is considered fundamental to the question of [[being]],{{Fact|date=September 2007}} in particular by the philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]].{{Fact|date=September 2007}} See [[Ontology]]. 

[[Henri Bergson]] believed that time was neither a real homogeneous medium nor a mental construct, but possesses what he referred to as ''Duration''. Duration, in Bergson's view, was creativity and memory as an essential component of reality.<ref>Bergson, Henri (1907) ''Creative Evolution''. trans. by Arthur Mitchell. Mineola: Dover, 1998.</ref>

=== Time as "unreal" ===

In 5th century BC [[Greece]], [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]] the [[Sophist]], in a fragment preserved from his chief work ''On Truth'' held that: ''"Time is not a reality (hupostasis), but a concept (noêma) or a measure (metron)."''
[[Parmenides]] went further, maintaining that time, motion, and change were illusions, leading to the [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] of his follower [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Harry Foundalis|title=You are about to disappear|url=http://www.foundalis.com/phi/WhyTimeFlows.htm|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>
Time as illusion is also a common theme in [[Buddhist]] thought,<ref>{{cite web|title=Buddhism and the illusion of time|url=http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhism_and_the_illusion_of_time.htm|accessdate=2007-04-27|author=Tom Huston}}</ref> and some modern philosophers have carried on with this theme. [[J. M. E. McTaggart]]'s 1908 ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'', for example, argues that time is unreal (see also [[Philosophy of space and time#The flow of time|The flow of time]]).

However, these arguments often center around what it means for something to be "real". Modern physicists generally consider time to be as "real" as space, though others such as [[Julian Barbour]] in his [[The End of Time]] argue that quantum equations of the universe take their true form when expressed in the timeless [[configuration space]]realm containing every possible "Now" or momentary configuration of the universe, which he terms 'platonia'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time is an illusion?|url=http://physicsandphysicists.blogspot.com/2007/03/time-is-illusion.html|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>

==The nature of time in the physical sciences==
{{main|Time in physics}}
From the age of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] up until [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] profound reinterpretation of the physical concepts associated with time and space, time was considered to be "absolute" and to flow "equably" (to use the words of Newton) for all observers.<ref>Herman M. Schwartz, ''Introduction to Special Relativity'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1968, hardcover 442 pages, see ISBN 0882754785 (1977 edition), pp. 10-13</ref>  The science of classical mechanics is based on this Newtonian idea of time.

Einstein, in his [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]],<ref>A. Einstein, H. A. Lorentz, H. Weyl, H. Minkowski, ''The Principle of Relativity'', Dover Publications, Inc, 2000, softcover 216 pages, ISBN 0486600815, See pp. 37-65 for an English translation of Einstein's original 1905 paper.</ref> postulated the constancy and finiteness of the speed of light for all observers.  He showed that this postulate, together with a reasonable definition for what it means for two events to be simultaneous, requires that distances appear compressed and time intervals appear lengthened for events associated with objects in motion relative to an inertial observer.

[[Einstein]] showed that if time and space is measured using electromagnetic phenomena (like light bouncing between mirrors) then due to the constancy of the speed of light, time and space become mathematically entangled together in a certain way (called [[Minkowski space|Minkowski]] [[space]]) which in turn results in [[Lorentz transformation]] and in entanglement of all other important derivative physical quantities (like energy, momentum, mass, force, etc) in a certain 4-vectorial way (see [[special relativity]] for more details).

===Time in classical mechanics===
In [[classical mechanics]] Newton's concept of "relative, apparent, and common time" can be used in the formulation of a prescription for the synchronization of clocks.  Events seen by two different observers in motion relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works pretty well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people's experience.

===Time in modern physics===
In the late nineteenth century physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism.  Einstein resolved these problems by invoking a method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the maximum signal velocity.  This led directly to the result that time appears to elapse at different rates relative to different observers in motion relative to one another.

=== Spacetime ===
[[Image:8-cell-simple.gif|right|thumb|A [[tesseract]], a cube in 3 dimensions extended to a fourth, as a description of time; adhering to defined finite bounds, all possibilities for this configuration are conceptually representable.]]
{{main|Spacetime}}

Modern [[physics]] views the curvature of [[spacetime]] around an object as much a feature of that object as are its [[mass]] and [[volume]].

Time has historically been closely related with [[space]], the two together comprising [[spacetime]] in [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. According to these theories, the concept of time depends on the [[inertial frame of reference|spatial reference frame of the observer(s)]], and the human perception as well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks  are different for observers in relative motion. Even the temporal order of events can change, but the past and future are defined by the backward and forward [[light cone]]s, which never change. The ''past'' is the set of events that can send light signals to the observer, the future the events to which s/he can send light signals. All else is the ''present'' and within that set of events the very time-order differs for different observers.

=== Time dilation ===
{{main|Time dilation}}

Einstein said that "The only reason for time is so that everything does not happen at once".  In this regard, Einstein said that time was basically what a clock reads; the clock can be any action or change, like the movement of the sun. Einstein showed that people traveling at different speeds will measure different times for events and different distances between objects, though these differences are minute unless one is traveling at a speed close to that of light. Many [[subatomic particle]]s exist for only a fixed fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but some that travel close to the speed of light can be measured to travel further and survive longer than expected (a [[muon]] is one example). According to the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], in the high-speed particle's [[Inertial reference frame|frame of reference]], it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its [[mean lifetime]], and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to "slow down" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seems to shorten. Even in Newtonian terms time may be considered the fourth dimension of motion; but Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or "warped") by high-speed motion.

Einstein (''The Meaning of Relativity''): "Two [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|event]]s taking place at the points A and B of a system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB. Time is then defined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relatively to K, which register the same simultaneously." 

Einstein wrote in his book, ''Relativity'', that simultaneity is also relative, i.e., two events that appear simultaneous to an observer in a particular inertial reference frame need not be judged as simultaneous by a second observer in a different inertial frame of reference.

=== Arrow of time ===
{{main|Arrow of time}}
Time appears to have a direction – the past lies behind, fixed and incommutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet the majority of the laws of physics don't provide this '''arrow of time'''. The exceptions include the [[Second law of thermodynamics]], which states that [[entropy]] must increase over time (see [[Entropy (arrow of time)|Entropy]]); the [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] arrow of time, which points away from the [[Big Bang]], and the radiative arrow of time, caused by [[light]] only traveling forwards in time. In [[particle physics]], there is also the weak arrow of time, from [[CPT symmetry]], and also [[measurement]] in [[quantum mechanics]] (see [[Measurement in quantum mechanics]]).

=== Quantised time ===
{{seealso|Chronon|Planck time}}
Time quanta is a hypothetical concept.  In the modern quantum theory (the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics) and in [[general relativity]] time is not quantized.

'''Planck time''' (~ [[1 E-44 s|5.4 × 10<sup>−44</sup>]] seconds) is the unit of time in the system of [[natural units]] known as [[Planck units]].  Current established physical theories are believed to fail at this time scale, and many physicists expect that the Planck time might be the smallest unit of time that could ever be measured, even in principle. Tentative physical theories that describe this time scale exist;  see  for instance  [[loop quantum gravity]].

==Time and the Big Bang==
{{NPOV-section}} {{Original research|date=October 2007}}
[[Stephen Hawking]] in particular has addressed a connection between time and the [[Big Bang]]. He has sometimes stated that we may as well assume that time began with the Big Bang because trying to answer any question about what happened ''before'' the Big Bang is trying to answer a question that is meaningless ''as those events would have been part of a different time frame and different universe outside of the scope of the Big Bang theory''.<ref>http://www.hawking.org.uk/lectures/bot.html "The conclusion of this lecture is that the universe has not existed forever. Rather, the universe, and time itself, had a beginning in the Big Bang, about 15 billion years ago."</ref><ref>http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/po/news/2005-06/feb/27.shtml 
"To ask what happened before the beginning of the universe would become a meaningless question because there is nothing south of the South Pole."</ref> 
<ref>http://www.ghandchi.com/312-SpaceEng.htm</ref>
[[Aristotelian]] philosopher [[Mortimer J. Adler]]<ref>http://radicalacademy.com/adlertheology1.htm</ref><ref>http://radicalacademy.com/adlertheology2.htm</ref>, demonstrating a common misunderstanding of the scope of the Big Bang theory<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang</ref>, has criticized Hawking for apparently contradicting his own principles and terms for maintaining that anything not measurable by physicists is meaningless and thus non-existent; i.e. for stating that time didn't exist before the big bang.
Hawking, in [[A Brief History of Time]] and elsewhere, along with several other modern physicists, has stated his position more clearly and less controversially: that even if time did not begin with the Big Bang and there were another time frame before the Big Bang, no information from events then would be accessible to us, and nothing that happened then would have any effect upon the present time-frame.<ref>Public lecture on the beginning of time by Hawking http://www.hawking.org.uk/lectures/bot.html</ref><ref>"Since events before the Big Bang have no observational consequences, one may as well cut them out of the theory, and say that time began at the Big Bang. Events before the Big Bang, are simply not defined, because there's no way one could measure what happened at them. This kind of beginning to the universe, and of time itself, is very different to the beginnings that had been considered earlier." http://www.hawking.org.uk/lectures/lindex.html</ref>   

Scientists have come to some agreement on descriptions of events that happened 10<sup>−35</sup> seconds after the Big Bang, but generally agree that descriptions about what happened before one [[Planck time]] (5 × 10<sup>−44</sup> seconds) after the Big Bang will likely remain pure speculation.

the big bang theory edited by Daniel Greagsby contains one such way of the cause in its simplicity. "the big bang was caused by a paradox in time. if time expanded, then was reversed in a stae of the time code, a matter of a paradox would occur where the universe inplodes then restarts like the phoenix. in the matter of quantem matter of time however, one could work out that the state of time was edited and in such state caused the paradox known as the big bang.

==Speculative physics beyond the Big Bang==
[[Image:CMB Timeline300.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A graphical representation of the expansion of the universe with the inflationary epoch represented as the dramatic expansion of the [[metric tensor|metric]] seen on the left. Image from [[WMAP]] press release, 2006. ([[:Image:CMB Timeline300.jpg|Detail]])]]

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined in the future. Little is known about the earliest moments of the universe's history. The [[Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems]] require the existence of a singularity at the beginning of cosmic time. However, these theorems assume that [[general relativity]] is correct, but general relativity must break down before the universe reaches the [[Planck temperature]], and a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]] may avoid the singularity.<ref>{{cite book | author=Hawking, Stephen; and Ellis, G. F. R. | title = The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time | location= Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1973 |id = ISBN 0-521-09906-4}}</ref>

There may also be parts of the universe well beyond what can be observed in principle. If inflation occurred this is likely, for exponential expansion would push large regions of space beyond our observable horizon.

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:
* models including the [[Hartle-Hawking state|Hartle-Hawking boundary condition]] in which the whole of space-time is finite; the Big Bang does represent the limit of time, but without the need for a singularity.<ref>{{cite journal | author=[[James Hartle|J. Hartle]] and [[Stephen Hawking|S. W. Hawking]] | title=Wave function of the universe | journal=Phys. Rev. D | volume=28 | pages=2960 | year=1983}}</ref>
* [[brane cosmology]] models<ref>{{cite journal | author=Langlois, David | title=Brane cosmology: an introduction | year=2002 | id={{arxiv|archive=hep-th|id=0209261}} }}</ref> in which inflation is due to the movement of branes in [[string theory]]; the pre-big bang model; the [[ekpyrotic]] model, in which the Big Bang is the result of a collision between branes; and the [[cyclic model]], a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Linde | first=Andre | year=2002 | title=Inflationary Theory versus Ekpyrotic/Cyclic Scenario | id={{arxiv|archive=hep-th|id=0205259}} }}</ref><ref name="rebirth">{{cite news | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060508_mm_cyclic_universe.html | title=Recycled Universe: Theory Could Solve Cosmic Mystery | publisher=[[Space.com]] | date=[[8 May]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref><ref name="rebirth2">{{cite web | url=http://www.science.psu.edu/alert/Bojowald6-2007.htm | title=What Happened Before the Big Bang? | accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref>
* [[chaotic inflation]], in which inflation events start here and there in a random quantum-gravity foam, each leading to a ''bubble universe'' expanding from its own big bang.<ref>{{cite journal | author = A. Linde |title = Eternal chaotic inflation | journal = Mod. Phys. Lett. |volume = A1 | Page=81 |year =1986}}<br />{{cite journal | author = A. Linde |title = Eternally existing self-reproducing chaotic inflationary universe | journal = Phys. Lett. |volume = B175|Page=395&ndash;400 |year =1986}}</ref>

Proposals in the last two categories see the Big Bang as an event in a much larger and older universe, or [[multiverse]], and not the literal beginning.

==Philosophical and religious interpretations==
{{main|Philosophical and religious interpretations of the Big Bang theory}}
The Big Bang is a scientific theory, and as such stands or falls by its agreement with observations. But as a theory which addresses, or at least seems to address, the [[origin beliefs|origins]] of reality, it has always been entangled with theological and philosophical implications. In the 1920s and '30s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the [[steady state theory]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Kragh, Helge | title = Cosmology and Controversy | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1996 | isbn=069100546X}}</ref> This perception was enhanced by the fact that [[Georges Lemaître]], who put the theory forth, was a Roman [[Catholic]] [[priest]].

==Time travel in science fiction==
{{main|Time travel}}
{{seealso|Time travel in fiction}}
Time travel is the concept of moving backward or forward to different points in time, in a manner analogous to moving through [[space]]. Additionally, some interpretations of time travel take the form of travel between [[Multiverse (science)|parallel realities]] or [[universe]]s. A central problem with time travel is that of logic – say, violation of [[causality]] (when effect precedes the cause it is the consequence of) – which has given rise to a number of paradoxes (see [[grandfather paradox]]).

== Psychology ==
{{see also|Mental chronometry}}
Different people may judge identical lengths of time quite differently. Time can "fly"; that is, a long period of time can seem to go by very quickly. Likewise, time can seem to "drag," as in when one performs a boring task. The psychologist [[Jean Piaget]] called this form of time perception "lived time."

Time also appears to pass more quickly as one gets older. For example, one year is 20% of the life so far of a five-year-old child, but only 2% of the life so far for a 50 year old adult. Thus, with increasing age, each segment of time is a decreasing percentage of the person's total experience.

Altered states of consciousness are sometimes characterized by a different estimation of time. Some psychoactive substances – such as [[entheogen]]s – may also dramatically alter a person's temporal judgement. When viewed under the influence of such substances as [[LSD]], [[psychedelic mushrooms]] and [[peyote]], a clock may appear to be a strange reference point and a useless tool for measuring the passage of events as it does not correlate with the user's experience.  At higher doses, time may appear to slow down, stop, speed up, and even go backwards when under the influence of these agents. A typical thought might be "I can't believe it's only 8 o'clock, but then again, what does 8 o'clock mean?" As the boundaries for experiencing time are removed, so is its relevance. Many users claim this unbounded timelessness feels like a glimpse into spiritual infinity. To imagine that one exists somewhere "outside" of time is one of the hallmark experiences of a psychedelic voyage. [[cannabis (drug)|Marijuana]] a milder psychedelic,may also distort the perception of time to a lesser degree.

The practice of [[meditation]], central to all Buddhist traditions, takes as its goal the reflection of the mind back upon itself, thus altering the subjective experience of time; the so called, 'entering the now', or 'the moment'.

In explaining his [[theory of relativity]], [[Albert Einstein]] is often quoted as saying that although sitting next to a pretty girl for an hour feels like a minute, placing one's hand on a hot stove for a minute feels like an hour. This is similar to the [[Kappa effect]]. These are both intended to introduce the listener to the concept of the interval between two events being perceived differently by different observers.

==Culture==
Culture is another variable contributing to the perception of time. Anthropologist [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] reported after studying the Hopi cultures that: “… the Hopi language is seen to contain no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions or that refer directly to what we call “time”, or to past, present, or future…” <ref>Carroll, John B. (ed.)(1956). [Language Thought and Reality. Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf. MIT Press, Boston, Massachusetts. [a href="http://worldcat.org/isbn/0262730065" ISBN 0262730065 9780262730068]</ref> Whorf's assertion has been challenged and modified. Pinker debunks Whorf’s claims about time in the Hopi language, pointing out that the anthropologist Malotki (1983) has found that the Hopi do have a concept of time very similar to that of other cultures – and in fact have units of time, and a sophisticated calendar.<ref> http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Students/njp0001.html</ref>
== Use of time ==
{{see also|Time management|Time discipline}}
The use of time is an important issue in understanding [[human behaviour]], [[education]], and [[travel behaviour]]. [[Time use research]] is a developing field of study. The question concerns how time is allocated across a number of activities (such as time spent at home, at work, shopping, etc.). Time use changes with [[technology]], as the [[television]] or the [[Internet]] created new opportunities to use time in different ways. However, some aspects of time use are relatively stable over long periods of time, such as the amount of time spent traveling to work, which despite major changes in [[transport]], has been observed to be about 20-30 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over a long period of time. This has led to the disputed [[time budget hypothesis]].

'''Time management''' is the organization of tasks or events by first estimating how much time a task will take to be completed, when it must be completed, and then adjusting events that would interfere with its completion so that completion is reached in the appropriate amount of time. Calendars and day planners are common examples of time management tools.

[[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] and [[Norbert Elias]] have written on the use of time from a sociological perspective.
