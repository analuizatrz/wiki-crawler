Below is a list of major and minor characters in from [[Square Enix]]'s [[console role-playing game]] ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''. The characters were designed by [[Akihiko Yoshida]].

There are a total of six main [[playable characters]] in ''Final Fantasy XII''; [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Vaan|Vaan]], [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca|Ashe]], [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Basch fon Ronsernburg|Basch]], [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Balthier|Balthier]], [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Fran|Fran]] and [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Penelo|Penelo]]. There is also one playable minor character ([[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Reks|Reks]], the older brother of Vaan) and three [[non-player character|NPCs]] who become "Guests". These "Guest" characters join in the battles with the main characters in the story, though the duration of their joining is determined by the story's plotline. There are also "Allies" who fight on the player's side only a single battle - typically being for Mark Hunts - and in plotline battles.  

The plot revolves on the attempt to liberate the kingdom of Dalmasca from the Archadian Empire. The story is told through the eyes of Vaan, an orphan who wishes to be a sky pirate - high flying tomb raiders. His adventures brought him to a cadre of other characters that shape the course of the story.

{{nihongo|'''Vaan'''|ヴァン|Van}} is the hero and a 17-year-old orphaned [[Races of Final Fantasy#Humans|Hume]] street urchin who lost his parents in a plague when he was 12 years old and his only brother Reks two years before the start of the game, during the Archadian Invasion of Dalmasca. Reks's death is especially challenging for Vaan to cope with, being his only true remaining family. He makes a living as Migelo's assistant, running various errands for him, while at the same time pickpocketing from Archadian soldiers, claiming to take back what is Dalmasca's. He is a cheerful and energetic lad, and among his friends he is considered their leader. Vaan always dreams of someday becoming a sky pirate in command of his own airship. He often trains to meet this goal by killing dire rats in the sewers of Rabanastre on a daily basis, for which Dalan gave him the nickname "Vaan Ratsbane."

During the beginning of the game, he is still resentful of his brother's death at the supposed hands of Basch. However, this quickly changes as he and the party learn the truth, and he eventually decides to trust Basch.<ref>'''Vaan''': My brother trusted you. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref> From this point on he actually acts as defender of Basch to Ashe, who initially hated him as well. Vaan also has a hidden secret: he is frustrated with the mere fact he is incapable of helping Dalmasca. As he stated to Ashe in the Garif town of Jahara, Vaan would claim to be a "sky pirate - or some other stupid thing", simply so that he could ignore his own feelings of helplessness and confusion before the Empire. Mirroring Ashe's own frustration with her inability to defeat the Empire, Vaan's frustration turns itself into a desire to see the journey through; as he states to Ashe, he believes that if he just keeps following her, he can find his own answers. Vaan is unique in that, despite being the player character for most of the game, he is not the leader of the party - as he states to Basch and Penelo when the party reaches Archades, he's just going along with the party, following Ashe. 

Vaan eventually "gave up" his dream of being a sky pirate, since it was just a way to release his frustration; ironically, despite this, he becomes a sky pirate anyway. Balthier, who'd noticed during the game that Vaan thought more and more like a sky pirate with each passing moment, showed him how to fly the Strahl, and showed him life as a sky pirate. Vaan took the Strahl at the end of the game, though Fran and Balthier took it back; Vaan and Penelo, now full-fledged sky pirates on their own, gain their own small airship, currently unnamed. 

Vaan returns in the sequel, ''[[Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings]]'', this time as the hero of the story.

'''Ashelia''' or {{nihongo|'''Ashe B'nargin Dalmasca'''|アーシェ・バナルガン・ダルマスカ|Āshe Banarugan Darumasuka}} is the heroine and a 19-year-old Hume princess fighting to liberate her kingdom, Dalmasca, from the Archadian Empire. She was thought to have committed suicide, but took on the alias, {{nihongo|'''Amalia'''|アマリア|Amaria}}, to serve as the leader of the Resistance before joining the group. Though intent on getting revenge on Archadia for the horrors its militant forces had committed on her people, Ashe's own lineage and malice were manipulated by the Occuria.

{{nihongo|'''Balthier'''|バルフレア|Barufurea|'''Balflear''' in the original [[Japanese language]] version}} is a 22-year-old Hume sky pirate who pilots the ''Strahl'', a small [[airship (video game)|airship]], around the skies of Ivalice. He and his companion, Fran, prefer to remain outside of the war between the kingdoms of Ivalice. However, their attempt to steal a magicite (actually the Dusk Shard Nethicite) went bad; Vaan stole it first, and events forced them to join up in the Resistance over time. 

Born {{nihongo|'''Ffamran Mid Bunansa'''|ファムラン・ミド・ブナンザ|Famuran Mido Bunanza}}, he is the son of Dr. [[Cid (Final Fantasy)|Cid]], though he grew weary of his father's madness and obsession with Nethicite. Although Cid had made him an Imperial Judge, Ffamran eventually decided to cut his ties with his father and his role as a judge, becoming a sky pirate under a new name. With this new career change, Balthier amounted a sizable bounty on his head, attracting the attention of bounty hunters such as Ba'Gamnan. Unfortunately for Balthier, it took him a while to realize he'd been following his father in pursuing Nethicite while he served in the resistance.

Balthier claims to be the "leading man" of the story many times throughout the game, and insists that this status makes him invincible. <ref>'''Balthier''': And what did they say about the leading man? He never dies. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref> This was furthered by his near-death experience when the Sky Fortress ''Bahamut'' was destroyed near Rabanastre. Though presumed dead, he and Fran apparently retrieved the ''Strahl'' back from Vaan & Penelo, leaving a note for the new Queen Ashe, indicating he is still alive. Both he and Fran are to return in the game's sequel, [[Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings|''Revenant Wings'']]. His middle name, Mid, is a reference to [[List of Final Fantasy V characters#Mid Previa|Mid Previa]] from ''[[Final Fantasy V]]''.

===Basch fon Ronsenburg===

{{nihongo|'''Sir Basch fon Ronsenburg'''|バッシュ・フォン・ローゼンバーグ|Basshu fon Rōzenbāgu}} is a Captain in the Order of Knights of Dalmasca. He was born in the Republic of Landis, along with his [[twin]] brother Noah. After the Archadian Empire conquered their homeland, Basch fled to Dalmasca, becoming a prominent and beloved member of the Kingdom. When Archadia attacked Nalbina Fortress, Basch led the defense. He, along with Lord Rasler Heios Nabradia, valiantly defended the fortress against the invading armies of Archadia. However, the Archadian forces proved too much for them to handle. Basch was the one responsible for carrying Lord Rasler from the field of battle after he was mortally wounded by an arrow to the chest (despite Basch's efforts to stop the assailant). After the Archadian occupation, he and Captain Azelas led an assault on Nalbina Fortress in an attempt to save the king, only to be captured by Imperial forces. As part of Vayne's plot to frame Basch, Noah, now Gabranth, posed as his brother and slew the Dalmascan king and later Vaan's older brother, Reks, who witnessed the crime. As a result, Basch is regarded by the Dalmascans as a traitor, and was stated to have been executed by Marquis Ondore. But in reality, Basch was imprisoned alive in the Nalbina Dungeons by Vayne as a means of ensuring Ondore remains loyal to the Empire - if Ondore betrayed the Empire, all Vayne would have to do would be to announce Basch's continued survival to destroy the Marquis' credibility.

He was eventually freed by Vaan, Balthier, and Fran who were trying to escape Nalbina dungeons. Though all three were initially suspicious of him; Vaan in particular, the party did catch a look at Gabranth's face, lending credibility to Basch's story that he had been framed. After the escape, he vowed to protect Ashe and help the resistance, in spite of his past failures. He remained loyal as well, even through such events as Vossler's betrayal. 

It was Basch's devotion to honor despite everything else that most puzzled his twin, Gabranth, and was the source of the division between them. Eventually coming to respect Basch's viewpoint more than his own, Gabranth sought to redeem himself and remained true to his own devotion to Larsa Solidor, helping his brother and Ashe defeat Vayne on the ''Bahamut''.

After the battle, as Noah was dying, he asked his brother to protect Larsa in his place to ensure peace. Because common belief of Captain Ronsenberg being dead, Basch easily took over his brother's stead as "Judge Magister Gabranth" to be the protector of the new Emperor Larsa Solidor.

===Fran===
[[Image:Fran.jpg|120px|right|Fran]]
{| class="wikitable"
!English Cast!! Japanese Cast
|-
|[[Nicole Fantl]]
|[[Rika Fukami]]

{{nihongo|'''Fran'''|フラン|Furan}} is a member of the [[rabbit]]-like [[Races of Final Fantasy#Viera|Viera]] race and Balthier's partner aboard his airship. She is described as proficient with a variety of weapons. She's also a good pilot and navigator, as expected of every sky pirate's partner.

Fran's hometown is Eruyt Village, a small enclave of the viera in Golmore Jungle. Fran left Eruyt Village and cast aside the Green Word fifty years prior to the events occurring in the game, believing that as her kind began with the forest, they can not be bound to its end. She had no intention to return to the Wood ever again until she and the others needed to get to Mt. Bur-Omisace, which lay past Golmore; unfortunately, the paths are sealed by Jote, Fran's sister. Though normally the viera would let none pass, Vaan's brashness convinces Jote to reveal that Fran and Jote's younger sister, Mjrn, had left the woods to explore the Henne Mines, and was taken by the humes. They depart for the Mines, finding Mjrn possessed by Venat. Upon their return back to Eruyt, Fran admits that she sometimes regrets the choice she made years ago, as she is unable to hear the forest, and fears the Wood hates her for leaving. Jote assures her otherwise, <ref>'''Jote''': The Wood longs for you. For the child gone from under her boughs.{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref>. Fran is skeptical, thinking Jote was just trying to comfort her.<ref>'''Fran''': A pleasant lie, that. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref> She leaves with the party, claiming to have become like a hume<ref>'''Fran''': I am as them, now.{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref>, and at ease with her conscience. 

Fran, like all Viera, is exceptionally susceptible to the flows and vagaries of the Mist that permeates Ivalice; when Judge Ghis heated the Dawn Shard in his airship's engine, she could feel the Mist burning, and it threw her into a berserk rage, allowing her to easily split her iron shackles and, with her bare hands, knock down the guards imprisoning them with little trouble. Likewise, she could tell that the Mist was cooled in the Giruvegan, and of all the characters, seems to be the wisest - fitting, as she is much older than the rest of the cast.

===Penelo===

|[[Catherine Taber]]
|[[Yuna Mikuni]]

{{nihongo|'''Penelo'''|パンネロ|Pannero}} is a 16-year old Human orphan who works as a dancer in a Rabanastre bazaar. She learned martial arts from her now-deceased older brother, a soldier, and though small in stature, she is perfectly capable of handling herself in sticky situations.

She has known Vaan since childhood, and is like a sister to him. Her parents, having took Vaan in to care for him after his own parents died, encouraged Penelo to like Vaan; having placed the two together when young, Vaan and Penelo care about each other a lot. It is unclear if this relationship will go any further, but the ending of the game reveals that they are traveling together as sky pirates, with Vaan as pilot and Penelo as navigator.

While due to the nature of ''Final Fantasy XII''<nowiki>'</nowiki>''s'' combat system, no character is inherently good or bad at anything, there are small stat differences; these differences dictate that Penelo is the best magic user, alongside Ashe; but with higher vitality, but also consequently lower strength, in the party. This is also indicated in the sequel; Penelo returns in ''Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings'', wearing a new outfit and using a magical staff.

{{nihongo|'''Vayne Carudas Solidor'''|ヴェイン・カルダス・ソリドール|Vein Karudasu Soridōru}} is the 27-year-old Consul-Governor of Archadian-occupied Dalmasca, Commandant of the Archadian Empire's Western Armada and a member of House Solidor, whose members had led the Empire for four generations. This in effect makes him a "Prince", though as he states, the democratic nature of the Empire makes him no more eligible for the throne than anyone. He often laughs off those who attempt to give him the respect his title would command and makes genuine efforts to reach out to the conquered Dalmascans who make up his jurisdiction.

{{nihongo|'''Larsa Ferrinas Solidor'''|ラーサー・ファルナス・ソリドール|Rāsā Farunasu Soridōru}} (age 12) the fourth son to Emperor Gramis, and brother to Vayne. He was the favorite son of Lord Gramis, who tried tirelessly to ensure that Larsa remained pure and free from the scain of politics and war. Though young, Lord Larsa was a very idealistic young boy who believed problems could be solved without war. Larsa possessed a great deal of respect for House Solidor and the men of his family, especially his older brother who he adored. The Senate feared Vayne's growing power and the perceived threat to their own, so they sought to have Lord Larsa placed upon the throne, believing him to be young and easily manipulated from behind the scenes. However, little did the Senate know, Larsa was more than capable of taking up the sword of House Solidor. He traveled with Vaan and company, under the alias "Lamont", during their trip to the Lhusu Mines to rescue Penelo. However, his knowledge of Nethicite exposed him. Larsa helped Vaan and company escape from the ''Leviathan'' and later joined the party again at Jahara until they arrived at Mt. Bur-Omisace and he learned from Al-Cid Margrace of the Rozarrian Empire that his father had been murdered.

Larsa urged Ashe to use her influence on the Resistance to prevent an aggravation between the warring countries. Unlike his brother Vayne, Larsa was confident that a peaceful solution between these groups involved possible. After his brother was defeated, Larsa took his place in the Arcadian throne and settled into peace agreements.

Larsa joins the party as a guest throughout the game. Though young, he is skilled at swordplay.

|[[John Rafter Lee]]
|[[Chikao Ohtsuka]]

{{nihongo|'''Cidolfus Demen Bunansa'''|シドルファス・デム・ブナンザ|Shidorufasu Demu Bunanza}}, also referred to as '''Dr. Cid''', is a 58 year old Archadian scientist who is close friends with Vayne, despite age differences, and currently engaged in studying Nethicite, the one who created all of Archadia's airships. He is revealed to be [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Balthier|Balthier]]'s father, whose ambitions drove Balthier away from the father he used to know. 

This incident was the result of Cid going to Giruvegan to study more of the Nethicite, only to return as a maniacal shell of his former self. Dr. Cid became so obsessed with his research on Nethicite, that he eventually warped his mind, making him slightly mad. Doctor Cid seems to talk to himself quite a bit, but in reality, he is speaking to Venat. Under Venat's influence, Cid helped Vayne encourage the war in order to gain shards of the Sun-Cryst in order to help him create Manufacted, or artificial Nethicite. Cid is confronted by Balthier and company at the Draklor Laboratory in Archades, which resulted in a fight after the doctor tried to kill them with two guns powered by Nethicite. Cid survives the encounter and flees. Cid and Gabranth go to the Pharos, to use the Sun-Cryst. After Gabranth is defeated, Cid decided that he was not worthy to serve as Larsa's protector anymore and told him that he was no longer needed. Enraged, Gabranth tried to attack Cid, who teleported out of the way as Venat threw the judge against a wall. Cid fought his son and the rest of the party once again, this time with help from the Esper, Famfrit. Cid died after the battle, dissolving into energy absorbed by the Sun Cryst before it was destroyed and fully activated his final airship, the ''Bahamut''. This is also the first Final Fantasy game to feature a [[Cid (Final Fantasy)|Cid]] as a villain.

===Archadian Judges===
The '''Archadian Judges''' are a special order of knights under the Imperial Archadian Ministry of Law. With the spread of Archadian influence came a rise in crime and regional conflicts. To reduce the amount of time required by judicial process, a military court was established, this being the origin of the Order of Judges. They are the supreme enforcers of Archadian law in the world of Ivalice. Each wields extraordinary legal power in his or her own right over lower-ranked Archadian officers. 
The higher ranked {{nihongo|'''Judge Magisters'''|ジャッジマスター|Jajji Masutā|'''Judge Masters''' in the Japanese version}}, in addition to functioning as chief arbiters and enforcers of Archadian law, are also the elite guard of House Solidor which effectively makes them the commanders of the Imperial Army.

{{nihongo|'''Gabranth / Noah fon Ronsenburg'''|ガブラス/ノア・フォン・ローゼンバーグ|Gaburasu / Noa 
fon Rōzenbāgu}} is the Judge Magister of the 9th Bureau. The 9th Bureau, led by Gabranth, is primarily concerned with the gathering and dissemination of information. As a result, many of the bureau’s activities are shrouded in secrecy. Gabranth, and his power, are respected by the other Judge Magisters, and Emperor Gramis himself places great faith in this younger Judge. He is also Basch's twin brother, the man truly responsible for the deaths of Reks and King Raminas. Unlike Basch, he wholeheartedly supports Archadia. After the fall of Landis, Basch left for another country leaving Noah and their mother, who was suffering from an illness at the time, behind. But Noah couldn't leave their mother in her condition, and moved with her to her home country of Archadia. In an effort to distance himself from Landis, he took on his mother's surname, Gabranth. Noticed by Emperor Gramis, Gabranth joins the Archadian Judges with the Emperor's backing and rises to become a Judge Magister. Eventually his mother succumbs to her illness and dies, and Gabranth's feelings towards his brother finally change to hatred for what he sees as him abandoning his homeland and family. At the Emperor's behest, he acted as an informant on the dealings of Lord Vayne and became Larsa's protector. Despite these facts, Gabranth loathes himself for the framing of his brother and the horrible tasks Vayne and the Empire have commanded him to do, like killing Drace to prove his loyalty as Archadia's "Hound". He accompanies Bergan and Zargabaath to Mt. Bur-Omisace where Larsa agrees to return with him, to avoid any trouble. Towards the end of the game, after realizing why his brother remains with a positive outlook despite his life ruined, Gabranth decides to make up for his wrongs by protecting Larsa and helping the Resistance kill Vayne for the good of the Empire. He is fatally injured by Vayne in the process, before Larsa arrived to his defense, and dies in Basch's arms. Basch takes up his brother's mantle, at his request, in the aftermath of the game, serving as the next "Gabranth" and Larsa's protector.

{{nihongo|'''Ghis'''|ギース|Gīsu}} is the officiant of the 13th Bureau and commander of the Dreadnought ''Leviathan'', the flagship of the 8th Fleet of the Western Armada, led by Lord Vayne. In addition to official duties as Judge Magister, he also worked in secret, carrying out tasks assigned him by Vayne personally. Ghis was the one responsible for guarding and supervising the young Lord Larsa during his visit to Bhujerba and fought Vaan when he and the others freed Ashe from the ''Leviathan''. He was later ordered by Vayne to seek out the Dawn Shard, the last of the ancient relics left by King Raithwall. Ghis' ''Leviathan'', leading the 8th Fleet, travelled over the Jagd Yensa to Raithwall's tomb to retrieve the stone, once again capturing Vaan and company in the process. Onboard, Ghis revealed to Lady Ashe that Captain Azelas had made a deal with the Empire, that in return for the Dawn Shard the Kingdom of Dalmasca would be restored. To determine whether or not the Dawn Shard was truly defected nethicite or not Ghis had his science staff test it. Due to the ship's lack of proper testing facilities the science staff chose to use the ''Leviathan's'' drive as a test bed. Pleased with the test results, Ghis planned to use the stone to further his own ambitions. However, the immense power of the Dawn Shard overloaded the ship's drive and resulted in a cascade failure causing the ship to implode. Ghis died for his hubris on the ''Leviathan's'' bridge, taking it, and the rest of the 8th Fleet of the Archadian Imperial Army, with him.

{{nihongo|'''Bergan'''|ベルガ|Beruga}} is the Judge Magister of the Archadian Imperial Army and director of the 2nd Bureau. A warrior by training, he had a personal affinity for weapons and combat. His experience with warfare positioned him as the Empire’s preeminent Judge overseeing invasion and military envoys. The most autocratic of all the Judges in both word and deed, as well as the strongest due to his use of manufactured nethicite. A staunch supporter of Lord Vayne (also a believer in administration by force), he dedicated his life to ensuring that Vayne’s aspirations came to fruition. Bergan, along with Judges Zargabaath and Gabranth, travelled to Mt. Bur-Omisace to retrieve Larsa. The Imperial forces, commanded by Bergan, cut a bloody swath through the Kiltias during their merciless onslaught, sparing no one. Though Larsa agreed to return with them to avoid trouble, Bergan had other ideas. Bergan, in a fit of rage, attacked Al-Cid. When Vaan and company arrived at the Hall of the Light, to their dismay, they found Bergan hovering over His Grace Anastasis' lifeless body. Bergan, wielding two unique-looking swords, both heavy in appearance, demanded that Lady Ashe relinquish the Sword of Kings to him, ranting about how Ivalice hails her true Dynast-King, Vayne Solidor. He engaged Ashe and the others. Having set his very bones about with manufacted nethicite, his strength had been increased exponentially and he had been possessed by Venat as well in the process. However, Bergan was no match for the main party and was defeated. Due to the overexertion of the battle, the nethicite, already possessing too much power for Bergan's frail Hume body to handle, violently killed him.

{{nihongo|'''Drace'''|ドレイス|Doreisu}} is Larsa's guardian and surrogate mother, being the only female Judge Magister. Drace acted as advisor to Larsa and was charged with overseeing his education and up bringing. She was a staunch supporter of Lord Larsa and was confident that, as Emperor, he'd be much more than a mere puppet for the Senate to control. Knowing all to well that once the Senate realized Larsa's true capabilities that they would present a danger to him, she, along with her comrade Judge Gabranth, agreed to protect the young Lord from harm. Drace also harbored much ill will toward Lord Vayne, believing him to be ruthless beyond contempt, taking the lives of two of his own brothers. Drace had suspected foul play on Vayne's part when Emperor Gramis was poisoned and the Senate, who had been charged with the Emperor's assassination, were striped of all authority and Vayne was granted "temporary" powers of autocracy until order could be restored. She loudly voiced her opinion despite Judge Zargabaath's warning of caution. She attempted to place Vayne under arrest after he lamented on the fact that House Solidor had been reduced, with the murder of their father, to himself and his "dear brother" Larsa. However, she herself, was placed in check (at sword point) by Judge Bergan who noted that because it was the Archadian Ministry of Law that granted Vayne autocratic authority, she, as Judge Magister, betrayed the very law which she herself served by bearing her sword at Vayne. Out of spite, Drace attempted to assault Bergan, who, with inhuman strength, easily overpowered her. Convicted and found "guilty", Vayne ordered Gabranth to perform his duties as Judge Magister and execute Drace, despite Zargabaath's plea of mercy, as proof of his loyalty to his new "master". No longer caring to live, Drace tells a hesitant Gabranth to go ahead and do his duty, but not before telling Gabranth to live and protect the young Lord Larsa. Gabranth, regretfully, ends Drace's life with her own sword.

{{nihongo|'''Zargabaath'''|ザルガバース|Zarugabāsu}} is Captain of the ''Alexander'', flagship of the 12th Dalmascan Fleet of the Archadian Army. A strictly military man who was absolutely loyal to the Empire. He was ordered by Vayne himself to take the airship ''Alexander'' and retrieve the young Lord Larsa. Though loyal to the Empire, he was an honorable man whose conscience was sometimes at odds with his loyalties. He pleaded with Vayne when he sentenced Judge Drace to death and he later took little comfort in Judge Bergan's merciless onslaught upon the Kiltias at Mt. Bur-Omisace, lamenting on how "the Empire's debts grow legion". During the final confrontation between the Empire and the Resistance, Zargabaath, from the ''Alexander'', commanded the auxiliary forces of the Imperial Fleet in conjunction with Vayne and the ''Bahamut''. He thought very ill of the Resistance forces, arrogantly exclaiming to himself "is this their worst". However, the Resistance forces managed to hold their own and even gain the upperhand. After Vayne was defeated and the ''Bahamut'' fell the Imperial forces had essentially been defeated and at the behest of Larsa, who assumed command of the Imperial Fleet after his brother's death, the Imperial forces ceased fire. When the derelict ''Bahamut'' began its fall toward Rabanastre, Zargabaath honorably offered to perform a kamikaze attack with the ''Alexander'' to protect the city, but before he could enact his plan Balthier's actions onboard the plummeting sky fortress prevented it from being necessary. Zargabaath was the only one of the college of known Judge Magisters to survive the events of the game.

{{nihongo|'''Gramis Gana Solidor'''|グラミス・ガンナ・ソリドール|Guramisu Ganna Soridōru}} is father to Vayne and Larsa and fourth Emperor of Archadia.  However, even he is not immune to the scheming of the Senate who suggested that Larsa be his successor. Gramis was filled with regret for the deaths of his two oldest sons, whom he gave Vayne the order to kill. After refusing to dethrone the Senate as wished by Vayne, whom he feared would be a danger to their empire, he is eventually assassinated at Vayne's hand. With the Emperor murdered, the blame for it was focused on Chairman Gregoroth and other members of the Senate, resulting into their disbandment by the newly crowned Vayne.

Gregoroth was found to have poisoned the Emperor and commit suicide, though this is doubted even amongst the Judge Magisters. The Senate was disbanded soon after, affectively making Vayne the unprecedented ruler of Archadia.

Though he acts as an arrogant free agent, he was working for Gabranth whom he fears to an extent. Ba'Gamnan's weapon of choice is a lance/buzzsaw composite weapon; making him an extremely dangerous opponent in battle. Even though he's a bounty hunter most foul, his notoriety is due to his illegal methods, like kidnapping Penelo and later attacking the hunters from Clan Centurio to lure out Balthier. This later strategy involved the killing the hunters, to ensure no one would be the wiser. But rumors spread and Montblanc set up "Belito" Elite Mark Hunt to lure Ba'Gamnan and his crew out into the Nam-Yensa Sandsea with aid from fellow Clan hunter Monid, Vaan and company. Ba'Gamnan and group were eventually defeated, with their leader falling into the Sandsea. Ba'Gamnan survived the Yensa and makes his return to confront/join Vaan in ''Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings''.

Ondore is also Ashe's uncle, serving as the preacher to her wedding and Rasler's funeral soon after. Ondore was rumored to have connections with the Dalmascan Liberation Army, even though he appears to have yielded to an Archadian rule. It is due to the fact that Ondore, in his attempt to keep peace with the Archadian Empire, faked the death of Basch who was in actuality being kept prisoner. But this made Ondore nothing but a "puppet ruler" blackmailed by Vayne. Once the Archadian 8th Fleet was destroyed, Ondore withdrew from his position and began to gather all rebel forces and enlisted Rozarria's aid for a grand assault against the Archadian Empire.

Referred to by some as gods, but unknown to the major religions in Ivalice, the Occuria race played a vital role in the history of Ivalice such as the creation of the Espers and granting power to King Raithwall to conquer the countries of Ivalice, granting him the Dawn, Dusk, and Midlight shards. Due to this, they are directly responsible for the formation of the Galtean Alliance and the golden days of Ivalice that followed.

Defying Gerun and the other Occuria, Venat was labeled a "heretic" as a result. It taught Doctor Cid and Vayne the secrets of Nethecite to allow them to manufacture it themselves (compare with the myth of [[Prometheus]]). This influence led to Cid's madness and Vayne's quest for power as they sought out the Nethicite shards originally cut by Raithwall for study. In response, the Gerun and the other Occurians attempted to regain their power by manipulating Ashe with an apparition of Lord Rasler. Venat's ambitions were ultimately fulfilled when Ashe resisted the Occurians' plans and Reddas destroyed the Sun-Cryst. When Vayne was weak and dying aboard the ''Bahamut'' following his defeat, he thought he failed Venat. Venat told him their goals were fulfilled beyond his knowing and the "Age of Stones" was over, and infused him with its power so that the two might "walk the path" of death together.

===Clan Centurio===
[[Image:FF12Montblanc.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Montblanc, leader of Clan Centurio]]
A resident clan based in Rabanastre, {{nihongo|'''Clan Centurio'''|クラン「セントリオ」|Kuran "Sentorio"}} was founded by the young moogle Montblanc.  The clan's charge is to fell dangerous beasts called Marks that pose a threat to the populace of Ivalice, although its true hidden purpose is to cultivate hunters strong enough to defeat the most powerful monster to ever set foot on Ivalice, Yiazmat, the Wyrm God.  Yiazmat had killed Montblanc's master several years ago, and ever since he has searched for a way to exact his revenge.

Clans are special groups in the world of Ivalice, formed by small alliances of hunters, that are aimed at hunting the most dangerous monsters, or Marks, that are posted as threats to the lives of the individuals of Ivalice. This is not done just out of a sense of honor- there's also considerable money to be had. It can be thought of as specialized [[bounty hunting]]. This is the ordinary business of clans, but they also sometimes hunt special Marks called Elite Marks, more powerful beasts-with correspondingly larger bounties. 

Initially, there were only two major Clans in Ivalice; Clan Centurio is slowly progressing in the ranks, gaining popularity across Ivalice, and is the only real competitor with either of the larger two Clans. Clan Centurio is the only clan the player interacts with, and is the clan Vaan joins at the start of the game. Some of the notable members names could be found in ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'', albeit with different spelling.

Notable members:

====Montblanc====
{{nihongo|'''Montblanc'''|モンブラン|Monburan}} is the leader of Clan Centurio, who is responsible for supervising Vaan's clan hunt progress. Appeared in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' as a playable character. He also seems to have a wide affiliation with other guilds and organizations around Ivalice, such as his sister Gurdy, who runs the Chocobo stables of the world. It is his desire to not only see Clan Centurio as the most prestigious of all clans, but to avenge his master's death at the hands of Yiazmat. He is one of the six Moogle siblings, the others being Nono, Gurdy, Hurdy, Horne, and Sorbet.

====Monid====
{{nihongo|'''Monid'''|モーニ|Mōni}} is a Bangaa clan member of high rank. He is initially dismissive of Vaan, who he views as a weak hunter. Cantankerous at first, this clashes oddly with his habit of talking to a small Hume child in the clan hall. It is revealed that the child is the son of Monid's hunter friends, killed by the "Trickster" Mark, to whom their deaths he promises to avenge. Monid is also responsible for helping Montblanc set the hunter stalker bait by using the "Belito" Mark. After these two Mark hunts were pulled off successfully with Vaan's aid, Monid came to respect him as one of the best hunters in the clan.

====Krjn====
{{nihongo|'''Krjn'''|カロリーヌ|Karorīnu}} is a Viera who is also one of the founding members. Aided Vaan's clan hunt for the "Carrot" Mark. She is the sister of Ktjn, a Viera who can be aided in various ways in the city of Rabanastre. Her sister regards her as cold, and strong, though Krjn herself makes no note of this.

====Bansat====
{{nihongo|'''Bansat'''|バンサト|Bansato}} is a Seeq member who aided Vaan's clan hunt for the "Gil Snapper" Mark. A jolly fellow, he readily recognizes Vaan as "tougher than me!" when Vaan reaches a high enough Clan Rank.

====Ma'kenroh====
{{nihongo|'''Ma'kenroh''' |マッケンロー|Makkenrō}} is a Nu Mou who is also one of the founding members. He offers advice on hunts, but unlike other members, he does not participate in battle; other clan members mention this, stating that he uses other talents to aid Montblanc. He and Montblanc are old friends, explaining his presence in the Clan Hall. Incidentally, he is the only Nu Mou in all of Rabanastre.
