The '''Hayward Fault Zone''' is a [[geologic fault]] zone capable of generating significantly destructive [[earthquake]]s, running mainly along the western base of the hills on the east side of [[San Francisco Bay]].  It runs through densely-populated areas, including the cities of [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], [[El Cerrito, Contra Costa County, California|El Cerrito]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]], [[Hayward, California|Hayward]], [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

The Hayward Fault is parallel to its more famous (and much longer) westerly neighbor, the [[San Andreas Fault]], which lies offshore and through the San Francisco peninsula. To the east of the Hayward lies the [[Calaveras Fault]] and beyond that the [[Clayton-Marsh Creek-Greenville Fault]] and their northern and southern extensions via other faults. North of [[San Pablo Bay]], and somewhat offset from the Hayward Fault is the '''Rodgers Creek Fault''', considered by many to be an extension of the Hayward Fault Zone.

These four fault structures are the major known active  slip-strike [[Geologic fault|faults]] associated with the relative motion of the [[Pacific Plate]] to the [[North American Plate]] in California at the [[latitude]] of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. 

==Tectonics of the Hayward Fault Zone==
:''Main articles: [[Seafloor spreading]],  [[Subduction]], [[Plate tectonics]], [[Geologic fault]], [[Earthquake]]''
[[Image:PlateMovementEaNoPac.png|thumb|right|250px|Plate motions of the eastern North Pacific-North America region. The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] is in the middle of the diagonal green segment (showing slip&ndash;strike movement) near the center of the image. Red arrows indicate movement rates relative to the North American plate]]
The [[Pacific Plate]] is a major section of the earth's crust, gradually [[Seafloor spreading|expanding]] by the eruption of [[magma]] along the [[East Pacific Rise]] to the southeast.  It is also being subducted far to the northwest into the [[Aleutian Trench]] under the North American Plate well north of San Francisco.  In California, the plate is sliding northwestward along a [[transform boundary]], the [[San Andreas Fault]], toward the subduction zone. At the same time, the [[North American Plate]] is moving southwestward, but relatively southeast along the faultline.  The westward component of the North American Plate's motion results in some compressive force along the San Andreas and its associated faults, thus helping lift the Coast Ranges.  The Hayward Fault shares the same relative motions of the San Andreas. As with portions of other faults, a large extent of the Hayward Fault trace is formed from a narrow complex zone of deformation which can span hundreds of feet in width.

As the [[transform boundary]] defined by the San Andreas Fault is not perfectly straight, and the motion of the [[North American plate]] is not entirely parallel to the plate boundary, movement along the boundary creates stresses in the crust on either side of the boundary, resulting in additional faulting on both sides of the San Andreas Fault. The Hayward Fault is one of the larger faults created this way, along with the [[Calaveras Fault]] and the [[San Gregorio Fault]]. 

===Rodgers Creek Fault Zone===
The '''Rodgers Creek Fault Zone''', is considered by many experts to be an extension of the Hayward Fault Zone.  However, the connection between the two faults is still unclear as they are not aligned under San Pablo Bay.  In fact, the Rodgers Creek Fault is actually aligned with the Pinole Valley Fault, not the Hayward Fault.  Nonetheless, the current view is that the Hayward Fault and Rodgers Creek Fault are probably connected by a series of ''en echelon'' fault strands beneath San Pablo Bay.  It is considered possible that a major seismic event on either fault may involve movement on the other. The [[Association of Bay Area Governments]] has prepared ground shaking maps that include this possible scenario (these are shown below).

==Notable earthquakes==
The largest quake on the Hayward Fault in recorded history occurred in [[1868]], with an estimated [[Momement magnitude scale}magnitude]] of 7.0.  It occurred on the southern segment of the fault, receiving its name (some decades later) from the nascent town of [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] where it was determined the quake's epicenter was located.  However, the 1868 quake caused much damage throughout the then sparsely-settled Bay Area, including the city of San Francisco. [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9801E5DB1E3CE13BBC4A51DFB6678383679FDE][http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9401E3D71039E033A25757C1A96F9C94649ED7CF]  In fact, the 1868 quake became known as the "Great San Francisco Earthquake" until the larger tremor in 1906.

The last truly major earthquake in the region was the [[1906 San Francisco Earthquake]] which occurred on the San Andreas fault. Many seismologists believe that the 1906 earthquake reduced the stress on many faults in the Bay Area including the Hayward fault, creating an "earthquake shadow": a quiescent period following a major earthquake.  Since the 1906 San Andreas event there have been no moderately strong earthquakes on the Hayward fault as were seen before that earthquake. It also appears likely that this quiet period in the earthquake shadow is ending, as projected by the rate of plate motion and the stress state of other faults in the region.

The following table chronologically lists all of the historic earthquakes on the Hayward Fault Zone which have exceeded magnitude 5.5.

==Recent activity==
[[Image:AlumRockEarthquakeOct30-2007-event40204628_ciim.gif|thumb|250px|right|October 30, 2007 [[Moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] 5.6 Alum Rock ([[San Jose, California|San Jose]]) event ''perceived intensity map''. Determined by statistical analysis of self-reports via the internet from residents via [http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/ca/ ''Did you feel it?''] ]]
During 2007, a number of small earthquakes occurred on the northern segment of the Hayward Fault from Oakland to Berkeley.

On Oct 30th 2007 at around 8 PM local time, a magnitude 5.6 struck the adjacent [[Calaveras Fault]] near [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], close to where the Hayward Fault diverges from it. The effects of an earthquake of this size include the spilling of merchandise from store shelves but little structural damage. An earthquake of this size can be locally terrifying, however, and this particular event was [http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/ca/STORE/X40204628/ciim_display.html widely felt] through Northern California (as far north as [[Oregon]]) owing to the time of day, when most people were awake and sitting  quietly in their homes.

==Probability of future activity==
[[Image:Eq-prob.jpg|thumb|left|]]
Of all the region's large faults, the Hayward-Rodgers Creek fault system is considered most likely to create the next major destructive earthquake in the region. Less-destructive earthquakes have been occurring in the region at random 15 to 30 year intervals - typically causing spillage of merchandise and occasionally, structural failures in lower stories and chimneys. This type of event is considered ''normal'' in California's "Earthquake Country" by geologists and long term natives, although disquieting to recent immigrants to the region. A major event on either the Hayward or San Andreas could produce a minute or more of intense shaking, as was felt in the [[Kobe earthquake]]. The ground conditions in that region of [[Japan]] are quite similar to those in the East Bay and that earthquake destroyed what were considered to be modern and well engineered structures. This was seen especially in the failure of elevated urban road structures and buildings due to soil failure.

The estimated probability of a major earthquake on the Hayward within the next thirty years is estimated at nearly 30 percent, compared to about 20 percent for the San Andreas Fault, which can have larger earthquakes but further away from a significant portion of the urbanized parts of the Bay Area.

==Principal segments==
The complete fault zone, including the Rodgers Creek fault, is divided by seismologists into three segments - Rodgers Creek, Northern Hayward, and Southern Hayward. It is expected that these segments may fail singly or in adjacent pairs, creating earthquakes of varying magnitude. The [[Association of Bay Area Governments]] (ABAG) in concert with other government agencies has sponsored the analysis of local conditions and the preparation of maps indicative of the destructive potential of these earthquakes. The various ABAG maps shown below represent some of the more likely possible combinations.

While there are indications that a substantial earthquake on a nearby parallel fault can release stress and so also the near&ndash;term probability of an earthquake, the opposite appears to be true concerning sequential segments. A release on a major segment can substantially increase the likelihood of an earthquake on an adjacent fault segment, increasing the likelihood of two major regional earthquakes within a period of a few months.

==Fault effects==
[[Image:HaywardFaultCreep.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Fault creep has displaced this [[Fremont, California]], curb since its construction about 15 years previous. A major event here would cause a displacement of four to six feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) in less than a minute]]
===Fault creep===
:''Main article: [[Aseismic creep]]''
The surface of the fault is creeping at less than 0.5 cm (0.2 in) per year in the regions of concern. Extreme southern regions of the fault are creeping faster, perhaps sufficiently to prevent fault rupture there, but mostly the creep is insufficient to relieve the accumulating forces upon most of the fault and so will not prevent a large earthquake. The creep is sufficient to displace roads, curbs, and sidewalks and so visibly reveal the surface trace in many locations. Creep damage to asphalt road surfaces will usually appear as a series of [[echelon]] cracks. Creep effects may be seen also in older structures crossing the fault, some of which have been fitted with expansion joints to accommodate this slow motion.

===Earthquake shaking===
The magnitude of an earthquake, as measured by the [[moment magnitude scale]] (or for small events the more commonly known [[Richter magnitude scale]]) is roughly proportional to the length of the rupture, while the ground motion in a large region surrounding the fault is highly dependent upon the local soil conditions, somewhat upon the distance and relationship to the progression of the fault rupture and (as recently recognized in the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]) reflected energy from deep discontinuities in the earth's structure. The area affected by an earthquake is also dependent upon the density and uniformity of the soils surrounding the fault.

:''The terms used ABAG differs from the official descriptions of the [[Mercalli intensity scale]], being somewhat softened (perhaps due to the extensive local experience with earthquakes), with terms such as "Rather Strong" becoming "Light", and "Ruinous" and "Disastrous" becoming variations of "Violent".

====Bayside soil conditions====
[[Image:SFBALiqufactionMap.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Liquefaction susceptibility map - excerpt of USGS map. Maps indicating shake amplification have similar appearance.]]
:''Main articles: [[Bay mud]], [[Soil liquefaction]], [[earthquake liquefaction]]
The Hayward fault is considered to be particularly dangerous due to the poor soil conditions in the [[alluvial plain]] that drops from the East Bay Hills to the eastern shoreline of [[San Francisco Bay]]. At the lower elevations near the bay the soil is mostly water saturated mud and sand, placed in the early [[20th century]] as fill in marsh areas. This soil tends to  amplify the effects of an earthquake and so producing significantly greater ground motion. Additionally, the soil itself can fail, turning into a liquid mud from the agitation, a mud unable to support buildings erected upon once-firm soil. This region is also covered with dense low-rise urban development, most of which was built soon after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], and long before even moderately earthquake resistant construction practices had been developed in the late 1920s. 

Further improvement in the construction of resistant structures and the development of retrofitting method have only recently been developed, largely in response to the effects of the 1971 [[Sylmar earthquake|Sylmar]], 1989 [[Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta]], and 1994 [[Northridge earthquake|Northridge]]  events in California &ndash; none of which were hugely catastrophic, but each of which caused loss of life in  structures not thought to be vulnerable, and so increased public, engineering, and government awareness of the need for specific remediations and construction methods required for improved life safety. 

Although many structures have undergone [[seismic retrofit]]ting there are a large number of dangerous un-reinforced [[masonry]] (mostly brick) structures and chimneys, which can be extremely hazardous to occupants in a large earthquake, and a large number of buildings which are either not bolted to their foundations or which are elevated upon partial stories that are insufficiently resistant to shear forces. Foundation and partial story weaknesses are easily remediated in most cases, but this is only effective if the work is competently done, with proper attention to minor details such as nailing patterns and proper connections. Local surveys of recently completed work have exposed deficient workmanship in a number of cases involving household retrofits.

====Ancient and prehistoric massive landslides and modern instabilities====
:''Main article: [[Landslide]]''
There is evidence of numerous archaic and extensive landslides in the [[Berkeley Hills]], with one believed to be as recent as 10,000 years ago. Such areas may be stable only under present conditions. There is the possibility that a large earthquake could trigger very large earth flows, particularly if the soils are seasonally saturated with water, possibly rendering extensive areas unbuildable. (See the [[#Virtual tour|Virtual tour]] - Google Earth Flyover below.)

===Potentially impacted structures and features===
Many structures near the bay shore on either side would probably be severely affected by either a major Hayward Fault rupture or a nearby [[San Andreas Fault]] rupture. Severe effects were seen in both Oakland and northern San Francisco from the 1989 [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], even though this event was not extremely large and was centered a significant distance away in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Most of the severe effects of that event were due to poorly responding soil conditions and design deficiencies in large structures. Only a portion of the structural deficiencies in the larger area have been addressed, and the surface motion effects of a large event are likely to be far more severe than seen in the Loma Prieta event.

====Freeways and overcrossings====
Many modifications have been made to freeway structures to reduce life hazards during seismic events. Significant adverse conditions remain which can cause disruption with possible long-term effects upon critical traffic infrastructure despite these modifications.

'''Warren Freeway portion of Highway 13'''

In its northern extent, the Hayward Fault lies directly beneath the portion of [[California State Route 13|Highway 13]] (the ''Warren Freeway'') that is south of its intersection [[California State Route 24|Highway 24]] and north of its terminal connection with [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]] (the ''MacArthur Freeway''). In this [[rift]] valley there are a number of elevated street crossings in the [[Montclair, Oakland, California|Montclair District]] that cross the fault.

'''Highway 24'''

[[California State Route 24|State Highway 24]], connecting Oakland to Orinda, Lafayette, and Walnut Creek through the [[Caldecott Tunnel]], is composed of extensive earth fill at the location where the fault is crossed. An earthquake may cause minor landsliding on some slopes of the freeway, and the plastic movement of the fill would likely disrupt the pavement if the movement here of the fault is substantial, possibly presenting a hazard to motorists and shutting down the highway for a while. More extensive disruption and  greater hazard could be caused by the failure of elevated structures, both those over which the highway passes and overcrossings of the freeway, of which there are two nearby. As elsewhere in the area, such structures have undergone extensive retrofitting for safety.

'''Highways 80 and 880 and the Port of Oakland'''

[[Image:I-80 Eastshore Fwy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Eastshore Freeway]]]]
A severe earthquake is more likely to disable the offshore causeway portions of [[Interstate 80|Interstate Highway 80]] (the [[Eastshore Freeway]]), since it is built on fill placed in the 1930s atop mudflats whose upper layers were deposited in the 19th century as a result of extensive [[placer mining|hydraulic gold mining]] in the distant [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain foothills. This soft mud is expected to amplify earthquake shaking, and the fill on top of the mud may liquefy, and so possibly cause major disruption of the highway due to failure by sinking and by differential movement of large sections. (More modern construction employs linked and "floating" - in mud - lightweight [[concrete]] and plastic foam box structures to support a road.) Similar conditions underly the eastern approach roads the Bay Bridge. Better, but still locally poor soils underlie the portion of [[Interstate 880|Interstate Highway 880]] that extends to the South Bay region from the eastern terminus of the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]]. As the bulk of cargo containers from the [[Port of Oakland]] travel on these two roads, the disabling of both would cause severe disruption of west coast import and export goods, owing to the consequent overloading of other West Coast container handling ports. Such disruption would be minor compared to that which could be produced by a large southern California earthquake, as the bulk of west coast container traffic is through the ports of [[Port of Long Beach|Long Beach]] and [[Port of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]].

'''Highway 580'''

A major route for commuters travelling from Southern Alameda County and the East Bay hills to downtown Oakland and San Francisco, [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]] crosses the fault twice, and runs very close to the fault between the intersections with [[State Route 13 (California)|State Route 13]] (the Warren Freeway) and [[Interstate 238]].

====Eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge====
[[Image:EasternSFO OAKBrFromTI.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Eastern span and replacement construction]]
:''Main article:[[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]]''
The 1989 [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] caused a failure of a single section of the upper deck of the eastern span of the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]], which closed the bridge for 30 days. Engineers and much of the public have long recognized that a strong earthquake centered closer to the bridge on either the Hayward or San Andreas faults could cause a complete collapse of the eastern span. A replacement eastern span is currently under construction, with completion projected for late [[2013]] (originally [[2010]]).
{{clear}}

====Railroads====
Parallel to the Eastshore Freeway and inland only two blocks is a four&ndash;track railroad route used for general freight traffic, including that generated by the [[Port of Oakland]] ([[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] and [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]] railroads) and by [[Amtrak]] passenger traffic to the Pacific Northwest and eastward through [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]]. Along the north shore of [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]], substantial amounts of pressurized liquid gas, flammable liquids, caustic materials, and various toxics are stored temporarily in bulk railcars adjacent to high speed passenger and freight traffic mainlines, with great potential hazards should a derailment occur. Derailments have often occurred during major earthquakes, both directly by tipping and by roadbed failures; industrial accidents involving these materials have caused extensive health hazards in the mixed residential&ndash;industrial areas of Richmond.

====Bay Area Rapid Transit====
:''Main article: [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]]''
In addition to extensive modifications to over crossings and elevated structures, largely to prevent dismantling due to shaking or destruction by soil failure, several other unique system feature require special treatment.

'''Transbay tube'''

BART trains travel between San Francisco and Oakland through a tube structure. The tube is composed of welded plate steel segments. Each oval outer section carries two inner train tubes of circular cross section and a central rectangular access and rescue tunnel, with the void between elements filled with concrete. The segments were sunk into a ditch dredged through bay mud and covered with rock fill, and then pumped free of water upon completion, making the resulting tube somewhat buoyant, but held in place with a rock overfill. Subsequent seismic analysis indicated the possibility that the overfill could fail due to agitation, allowing the buoyant tube to float upward, misaligning the tracks and possibly over stressing the bolted connections. This potential problem has been addressed by vibratory compaction of the overfill covering the tube. Additional stabilization will include the driving of large pilings and the connection of additional restraints.

'''Slip joint'''

The transbay tube terminates at an under-bay [[slip joint]] near the Embarcadero Station in San Francisco. The designed slip margin has been reduced by half due to unforeseen settlement of the tube structure. The projected worst-case motion at this joint has been determined to be beyond that for which the joint is presently capable, which could cause severe structural problems and mud and water entry into the tube and adjacent subway systems. This is to be corrected at great expense &ndash; first estimated at $142 million but expected to cost far more <!-- as of November 2006 -->&ndash; probably the largest single cost item in the list of BART seismic retrofits.

'''Berkeley Hills Tunnel'''

In June of 2006 Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) management announced that they have elected not to modify the Berkeley Hills Tunnel, which actually penetrates the Hayward Fault, arguing that it would be cheaper (and less disruptive to current operations) to rebore a misaligned portion after the fact than to protect riders (either by extensive modifications of the tunnel or by replacing it with a higher bore) against the small likelihood that a train (or two) would crash into or be cut in two by a major slippage of the fault. Modified train scheduling to prevent multiple train exposure at faults has been determined by BART engineers to be impractical due to variations in train passage, but [[automation|automated]] event-related realtime train operational response is considered practical (see below).

'''Seismic sensor network'''

BART has installed and continues to enhance a network of seismic sensors (an [[earthquake warning system]]) to trigger a system halt in the event of a major event, this to include automated event progression analysis to determine the best action with regard to individual trains for maximum safety (a fault rip can take up to several tens of seconds to completely propagate from the epicenter to the affected locations). Such sensor networks and warning devices have a potential to reduce the hazards from falling objects and furnishings provided that the people notified are well trained in appropriate responses (similar to the [[Cold War|Cold War's]] "[[duck and cover]]" training of schoolchildren).

====Refineries====
[[Image:ShellMartinez-refi.jpg|right|thumb|200px|View of Shell Oil Refinery in Martinez, California.]]
Of primary concern with respect to the Hayward Fault is the huge [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] [[oil refinery]] in [[Richmond, California|Richmond]]. Although founded on better ground than most of the shoreline, this refinery has extensive crude oil and finished product docks and pipelines extending into the bay, which could produce catastrophic spills into the bay, with the potential to adversely affect hundreds of miles of sensitive wetlands. Dismantling of high pressure and temperature process units and the consequent fire danger to personnel and equipment could produce substantial economic consequences for the western states. Large liquid storage tanks are protected by berms that are designed to contain the contents should a tank fail under normal conditions. Similar process and product conditions exist at other refineries further inland near [[Martinez, California|Martinez]], but mostly these plants are exposed to earthquakes from other faults.
{{clear}}

====Fuel pipelines====
Gasoline is continuously shipped under pressure from Richmond and Martinez area refineries through [[Kinder Morgan Energy Partners]] pipelines which run under heavily populated East Bay urban areas to tank terminals near San Jose Airport in North San Jose. Aviation fuels are piped from these same refineries to the Oakland Airport. A number of spills have previously occurred due to landslides and such spill and related toxic and flammable material release may be prevalent in a major seismic event.  A November 9, 2004, construction accident on this pipeline system in Walnut Creek killed five people.<ref>{{cite news| first = Henry | last = Lee | title = $6 million settlement in 2004 pipeline blast: 3 injured workers, dead man's kin to share funds | publisher = San Francisco Chronicle |date = 2006-10-20 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/20/BAG6TLST121.DTL | accessdate = 2006-01-23}}</ref> As seen in other worldwide pipeline ruptures, even an instantaneous stop of pumping would take several minutes to significantly lower pipeline pressure after a break, and would likely result in the release of significant amounts of flammable liquid fuels.

====Bay Area water supplies====
[[East Bay Municipal Utility District]] (EBMUD) supplies water to 800,000 East Bay customers who live west of the [[Berkeley Hills]]. Prior to the adoption and implementation of a $200 million seismic improvement project all of the water for these customers went through one vulnerable tunnel that crosses the Hayward Fault near the [[Caldecott Tunnel]]. As part of this project, that tunnel – the Claremont Tunnel – was seismically retrofitted. Additionally, EBMUD created a second route to bring water to these west-of-the-hills customers through the Southern Loop Bypass near [[Castro Valley]]. The Southern Loop was completed in 2002, while the seismic retrofitting of the Claremont tunnel was completed in Feb., 2007.

<ref>[http://www.ktvu.com/news/11138463/detail.html Major East Bay Water Supply Line Retrofit Completed]</ref>

The [[Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct]], which supplies 270 to 315 million gallons of water per day to the City of San Francisco and other Bay Area communities, directly crosses the Hayward Fault in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]].

====Lake Temescal====
The fault continues north under the eastern margin of [[Temescal Regional Park|Lake Temescal]] and its dam, which is unlikely to fail since it has been completely reinforced by the extensive earth fill supporting Highway 24.

====University of California (Berkeley)====
[[Image:Berkeley Lab view.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Lawrence Berkeley Lab overlooking the Berkeley central campus.]]
Many of the structures at UCB academic campus have been self rated as having "poor" earthquake performance. Numerous chemical, radiological, and biohazardous materials are present (in relatively small quantities) on campus and on the associated [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], in the hills above the university.

'''Memorial Stadium'''<br>
[[Image:CalMemStadFaultCreep.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Memorial Stadium supporting columns diverging at the top due to [[Aseismic creep|fault creep]] (the bottoms are in a common footing). Click image for additional information and diagram]]
Further north the fault passes under the lengthwise midline of the football field of [[California Memorial Stadium]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Fault creep since 1923 has offset the walls at the north and south ends 13 inches (33 cm). There are no plans at this time to replace the stadium in its entirety at a more appropriate location, even though its "'''O'''" shape may possibly be split into two "'''C'''"s. A suitable site for a replacement is available immediately to the east in Wildcat Canyon, although this would require an east-west alignment rather than the traditional north-south orientation. While there is only a small probability of an earthquake on this fault while the stadium is occupied, the results could be deadly. 
[[Image:Berkeley stadium fault creep P1320489.jpg|thumb|left|100px|At the same section juncture shown at right the exterior is also offset]]
Seismic improvements are planned to coincide with extensive renovations to the [[American football|football]] players' facilities, spurred by the recent retention of [[Jeff Tedford|a popular coach]] as part of his contract negotiations. The detailed nature of the seismic renovations has not yet been made public, but a detailed walk-through of the stadium offers some clues as to possible solutions, found [http://www.geomatrix.com/1906/guidebook/01_HF%20FG7%20Stop%201_Memorial%20Stadium.pdf here] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]] document), probably involving rebuilding portions of the stadium upon floating mats (foundations that do not penetrate the surface, rather sitting upon level graded gravel) where they pass over and near the fault, with appropriate sliding connections for the safety of spectators.

====Electrical system disruption====
Affected areas are likely to be without electrical  power for an extensive period. This in turn can make fuel supplies for vehicles and emergency generators unavailable locally. Due to the extensive use of point of sale scanners and registers in supermarkets this could also impact the ability of stores to sell essential items such as groceries and to preserve frozen food items.

====Cities affected====
Some of the cities in the eastern bay shore and south bay region near this fault include [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[El Cerrito, Contra Costa County, California|El Cerrito]], [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], [[Kensington, California|Kensington]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]], [[San Lorenzo, California|San Lorenzo]], [[Castro Valley, California|Castro Valley]], [[Hayward, California|Hayward]], [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], [[Niles, California|Niles]] and portions of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

Similar dangerous soil conditions and insufficiently resistant buildings are also on the southern, western and northern boundaries of San Francisco and San Pablo bays and would also be severely affected by a major earthquake on the Hayward fault. As that portion includes the so-called [[Silicon Valley]], the potential economic disruption due to destruction of works in progress and the dismantling of microelectronics fabrication plants could have an economic effect extending worldwide. The current estimates of the probability of a major earthquake on any of the numerous regional faults range up to 70 percent within the thirty year period 2000-2029. A recent ''quiet period'' following many years of minor activity is considered to be particularly ominous by many, although geologists have not yet been able to predict earthquakes with any useful accuracy. They do warn that all residents of the region should be prepared for a large event and its subsequent effects (e. g., lack of water, firefighting, first aid, electricity, motor and heating fuels, etc.) and that much life-safety protective work remains to be done.

===Retrofits for survivability===
:''Main article: [[Seismic retrofit]]
[[Image:BandedRetroColumn.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Highway 24 [[Seismic retrofit|retrofit]] at College Avenue Rockridge BART parking.<br>Jacketed and grouted column on left, unmodified on right]]
It is primarily the likelihood of a severe earthquake on the Hayward or San Andreas faults that has spurred a substantial effort to [[Seismic retrofit|retrofit]] and sometimes replace large structures at risk, particularly the eastern and western spans of the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]], the [[San Francisco City Hall|San Francisco]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] city halls, and numerous elevated rail, road, and pedestrian structures and [[overpass]]es. Much work remains to be done in the region and progress is being hampered by budget constraints imposed by trickle down federal-state-regional deficits, design and construction delays due to state and local political bickering over design, and unexpectedly high [[steel]] and [[cement]] costs due to the extensive construction work being done in [[People's Republic of China|China]].

==Further information==
===Virtual tour===
[[Image:GoogleEarthHaywardFaultOakBerk.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Google Earth tour - screen snapshot over North Oakland district, Emeryville, and Berkeley]]
The [[Google Earth]] website, in cooperation with the [[United States Geological Survey]] has prepared a [http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/research/geology/hf_map/GE_helicopter.htm virtual helicopter tour] of the fault, with much additional information available through the tour. Potentially dangerous landslide areas are also marked, showing great areas beyond the fault that could be rendered uninhabitable by a major event.

===References in popular culture===
The [[Tom Wolfe]] novel ''[[A Man in Full]]'' features a fictional major earthquake on the Hayward Fault as a [[deus ex machina]] method (freeing a major character from prison) and plot development point.

The [[James Bond]] movie ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' (1985) involved a plot, referred as "Main Strike", by [[Max Zorin]] to detonate explosives along the Hayward Fault, San Andreas Fault and at the "geological lock" to flood the two faults with water from nearby lakes and cause both faults to move causing a "double earthquake" that would destroy Silicon Valley, all in order for Zorin to monopolize the microchip market.

===Special exhibit===
Fremont Earthquake Exhibit: ''The Hayward Fault Exposed''
[[Image:HaywardFaultExposed5911.JPG|left|250px|thumb|A docent leads a visitor to a viewing platform within the pit. Click image for more information]]
This [[geotourism]] exhibit (April through October 2006, now closed) featured a 12- to {{convert|15|ft|m|0|sing=on}} deep pit exposing the Hayward Fault, which could be viewed "face to face" from a shaded platform by descending a staircase. Significant features were noted and marked. Similar trench excavations are used in the determination of the frequency and magnitude of prehistoric earthquakes and to determine the location of latent faults as part of the science of [[Paleoseismology]]
*Extensive additional interpretive material concerning the geology and seismology of the Bay Area was presented for viewing, most of which is currently accessible online.[http://www.msnucleus.org/haywardfault/index.htm]
*Funding and organization for a permanent exhibit at this location is being actively sought, with planning in progress.[http://www.msnucleus.org/haywardfault/proposal07.pdf]
