==Early Congressional career==
After several years as physician, Paul became a [[delegate]] to the 1974 Texas Republican [[Political convention|convention]].

Paul said, "After that day, all money would be political money rather than money of real value. I was astounded."<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

===Campaigns===
[[Image:Ron Paul and Ronald Reagan in 1976.jpg|thumb|260px|Ron Paul led the Texas Delegation to nominate [[Ronald Reagan]] (left to right: Ron Paul, [[Jack Fields]] and Ronald Reagan).]]
Paul was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congress from the 22nd district of Texas in 1974, against incumbent Democrat [[Robert R. Casey]], in an election where Democratic candidates won heavily. When [[President]] [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Casey as head of the [[Federal Maritime Commission]], Paul won an [[April]] [[1976]] [[special election]] to fill the empty seat. Paul lost six months later in the [[general election]], to Democrat [[Robert Gammage|Robert A. Gammage]], by fewer than 300&nbsp;votes out of 180,000; he then defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch and won new terms in 1980 and 1982. Paul was the first Republican representative from the area.<ref name="campaigncom">{{cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF-s1voM_Y | title = The Ron Paul Story | publisher = YouTube | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> His successful campaign against Gammage took the local Democrats by surprise; they had expected to retain the seat easily, especially since the election came in the wake of the [[Watergate scandal]].<ref name="npr on70s">{{cite news | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15016924 | title = Paul Has Long Drawn Support from Unlikely Places | publisher = [[National Public Radio]] | date = [[2007-10-07]] | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | last = Goodwyn | first = Wade | work = The '08 Candidates' First Campaign}}</ref>

Gammage had underestimated Paul's support among local mothers: "I had real difficulty down in Brazoria County, where he practiced, because he'd delivered half the babies in the county. There were only two obstetricians in the county, and the other one was his partner."<ref name="npr on70s"/>

Paul continued to deliver babies on Mondays and Saturdays during his entire term as the 22nd district representative.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> Paul was also one of only four Republican Congressmen to endorse [[Ronald Reagan]] for president against [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976,<ref name="2008bio"/> when Paul led the Texas Reagan delegation at the national Republican convention.<ref name="campaigncom"/>

===House of Representatives===
Paul was the first member of Congress, in the 1970s, to propose [[term limit]]s legislation in the House,<ref name="wsj1997">{{cite news | url = http://www.seedship.com/politics/ronpaul1.html | title = The Libertarian Congressman Is Back | work = Wall Street Journal | date = 1997-01-13 | page = A18 | accessdate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> where he also declined to attend junkets or register for a Congressional pension while serving four terms.<ref name="campaign1996">{{cite web | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n6_v17/ai_18535311 | title = Paul vs. Laughlin — Ron Paul's campaign against Representative Greg Laughlin | last = Beiler | first = David | date = 1996-06 | publisher = Campaigns and Elections}}</ref> He proposed legislation to decrease Congressional pay by the rate of inflation.<ref name="wsj1997"/> In 1980, when a majority of Republicans favored [[President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]'s proposal to reinstate [[Selective Service|draft registration]], he pointed out the majority's views as inconsistent, stating they were more interested in registering their children than they were their guns.<ref name="wsj1997"/>

Paul served on the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Banking Committee]], speaking against the inflation he saw as due to the [[Federal Reserve]],<ref name="2008bio"/> and against the deregulation of banking rules that allowed for the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the 1980s.<ref name="nytimesmagazine"/> The U.S. Gold Commission created by Congress in 1982 was his idea, and his conclusions from the commission were published by the [[Cato Institute]] as a book, ''The Case for Gold''.<ref name="gold">{{cite web | work = J.

It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic."<ref name="insight1997"/>

==1988 presidential campaign==

Paul said he sought to do more during his presidential run than reach office—he was spreading his liberty-minded ideas, often talking to groups of school and university students, whether or not they were old enough to vote: "We're just as interested in the future generation as this election. These kids will vote eventually, and maybe, just maybe, they'll go home and talk to their parents."<ref name="1988nytimes"/> He traveled the country for a year speaking about issues such as [[free market]] economics and the rising government deficits.<ref name="economist1988"/> He said, "That's why we talk to a lot of young people.

==Later Congressional career==

===1996 campaign===
In 1996, Paul returned to Congress after a tougher battle than he had faced in the 1970s. He was hopeful of being more effective in Congress after the Republicans took over both houses of Congress in the [[United States House elections, 1994|1994 election]].<ref name="paulsneary"/> His primary opponent, [[Greg Laughlin]], had support from Republican leaders, including House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]].<ref name="campaign1996"/> Incumbent Laughlin had switched from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to the Republican side the year before, and the [[Republican National Committee]], hoping to encourage other Democrats to switch parties, threw its full support behind Laughlin. Despite these efforts by the national party, the [[NRA|National Rifle Association]], and other interest groups, challenger Paul won the primary. It became the third time he had been elected to Congress as a non-incumbent.<ref name="nytimesmagazine"/>

While Gingrich and other Republican leaders visited the district stumping for Laughlin, Paul ran newspaper ads quoting Gingrich's harsh criticisms of Laughlin's voting record 14&nbsp;months earlier, before Laughlin had switched parties.<ref name="campaign1996"/> Baseball pitcher (and constituent) [[Nolan Ryan]], a friend of Paul's, served as his honorary campaign chair and appeared in ads for him, and tax activist [[Steve Forbes]] also supported Paul's candidacy.<ref name="nytimesmagazine"/><ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> Paul continued to maintain his home in Lake Jackson, but ran for the coastal 14th Congressional district rather than the 22nd district he had previously represented, due to redistricting borders.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ao.nictusa.com/ao/no/900023.html | title = Federal Election Commission Advisory Opinion Number 1990-23 | accessdate = 2007-05-26 | last = Elliott | first = Lee Ann | date= 1990-11-05 | publisher= Federal Election Commission}}</ref>

His Democratic opponent in the fall election, trial lawyer Charles "Lefty" Morris, lost in a close margin, despite assistance from the [[AFL-CIO|American Federation of Labor]] and running numerous attacks citing Paul's past votes to repeal federal [[Prohibition (drugs)|drug laws]] in favor of state legislation. With the help of his national network of donors, Paul raised $1.2&nbsp;million to Morris's less than $0.5&nbsp;million. Ken Bryan, a Democratic consultant to some of Paul's opponents, has said, "He has one of the largest contributor bases in Congress, outside of the leadership." Most of Paul's contributions are given in small amounts by individuals.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> That year, he had the third-highest amount of individual contributions of any House member, behind Gingrich and [[Bob Dornan]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/118086.html | title = Paul for President?: The maverick libertarian Republican talks on war, immigration, and presidential ambition | accessdate = 2007-05-28 | last = Doherty | first = Brian | date = 2007-01-22 | work = Reason}}</ref>

===Newsletter article controversy===
During the 1996 campaign, Morris also attacked issues of the ''Ron Paul Survival Report'' (published by Paul since 1985) that included derogatory comments concerning race and other politicians.<ref>{{cite news | title = CAMPAIGN '96 U.S. HOUSE: Newsletter excerpts offer ammunition to Paul's opponent: GOP hopeful quoted on race, crime | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20070512114222/http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/aol-metropolitan/96/05/23/paul.html | first = Alan | last = Bernstein | work = Houston Chronicle | date = 1996-05-22 | accessdate = 2007-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = The Congressman Who Voted Against a Congressional Medal for Rosa Parks | journal = Journal of Blacks in Higher Education | date = Summer 1999 | volume = 24 | pages = 38-9 | url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=1077-3711(199922)24%3C38%3ATCWVAA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K}}</ref> The newsletter had accused President [[Bill Clinton]] of fathering [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate]] children and using [[cocaine]]; called [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Barbara Jordan]] a "fraud" and a "half-educated victimologist"; and argued for lowering the [[Defense of infancy|legal age for prosecuting youths as adults]], using race-based examples.<ref>{{cite news | author = Written by a ghostwriter but attributed to Paul, Ron | date = 1992 | title = Los Angeles Racial Terrorism | work = et al., Ron Paul Political Report (now Ron Paul Survival Report) | quote = Black males age&nbsp;13 [were] as big, strong, tough, scary and culpable as any adult" and could be "unbelievably fleet-footed" in committing crimes; 95% of [[Washington, D.C.]], black males were "semi-criminal or entirely criminal" and only 5% of blacks were "sensible"; "actual and potential terrorists ... identified by the color of their skin" were destroying America; "complex embezzling" was a "100&nbsp;percent white and Asian" crime; Israelis were a lobby "of the bad sort.}}</ref>

In 2001, Paul took "moral responsibility" for the comments printed in his newsletter under his name, explaining they were written by a [[ghostwriter]]<ref name="fmnnrace">{{cite news | url = http://www.freemarketnews.com/WorldNews.asp?nid=41822 | title = Ron Paul Race Smear Erased? | date = 2007-05-22 | work = Free Market News | publisher = Free Market News Network}}</ref> and did not represent his views.

===Campaigns as incumbent===
In 1998 Paul again won the primary and the election, outraising his opponent by a large margin, $2.1&nbsp;million to $0.7&nbsp;million. Opposing a Democratic rice farmer and former [[Matagorda County, Texas|Matagorda County]] judge, Loy Sneary, Paul won by 11%; he ran ads warning voters to be "leery of Sneary".<ref name="saynot"/> Paul accused Judge Sneary of voting to raise his pay by 5%, increasing his judge's travel budget by 400% in one year, and creating more government bureaucracy by starting a new government agency to handle a [[license plate]] fee he enacted. Sneary's aides said he had voted to raise all county employees' pay by 5% in a "cost of living" increase. Paul countered that he had never voted to raise Congressional pay.<ref name="paulsneary"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story.mpl/content/chronicle/metropolitan/98/08/15/notebook.2-0.html | title = Foes lock horns over Paul's radio ads | accessdate = 2007-05-26 | date = 1998-08-14 | work = Campaign Notebook | publisher = Houston Chronicle}}</ref> In 2000, Sneary ran against Paul again, with Paul winning 60% to 40% and raising $2.4&nbsp;million to Sneary's $1.1&nbsp;million.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

Between 2001 and 2003, an online grassroots petition to draft Ron Paul for the 2004 presidential election garnered several thousand signatures.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.petitiononline.com/Paul2004/petition.html | title = Ron Paul for President 2004 | last = Allan | first = Sterling D. | publisher = Petition Online}}</ref> On [[December 11]], [[2001]], Paul told the independent movement he was encouraged that the petition was spreading the message of Constitutionalism, but did not expect a White House win at that time.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20040806232944/www.paul2004.com/RonsResponse/index.html | title = Ron Paul's Response to "Ron Paul for President 2004" Petition | last = Allan | first = Sterling D. | publisher = DRAFT Ron Paul for United States President 2004 | date = [[2001-12-11]] | accessdate = 2007-10-18}}</ref> 

Paul was re-elected to Congress in 2002, in 2004 (running unopposed), and in 2006 to his 10th term (by 20%),<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006//pages/results/states/TX/index.html | title = State Races: Texas | accessdate = 2007-03-04 | work = Elections 2006 | publisher= Cable News Network}}</ref> outraising his opponent $1.2&nbsp;million to $0.6&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thevictoriaadvocate.com/330/story/72352.html | title = Shane Sklar won't run against Paul in 2008 | accessdate = 2007-06-14 | work = Elections 2008 | publisher = Victoria Advocate}}</ref> In the 2008 Congressional primary, he has been challenged by Chris Peden, a [[Friendswood, Texas|Friendswood]] city councilman.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA052207.EN.PAUL.94898f61.html | title = Paul gets primary challenger | accessdate = 2007-07-11 | work = San Antonio Express-News}}</ref> Eric Dondero, a former aide fired by Paul,<ref name="nytimesmagazine"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://reason.com/blog/show/120230.html | title = Blowback, Texas-Style | accessdate= 2007-07-11 | work= Reason}}</ref> had previously said he would challenge Paul in the primary, but has endorsed Peden instead.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.galvestondailynews.com/story.lasso?ewcd=1672327e8b852faa | title = Fundraising slow for congressional candidate | last = McDonald | first = Sara | date = [[2007-10-18]] | accessdate = 2007-10-18 | work = Galveston County Daily News}}</ref>

===Relationship with district===
Paul continued to work as an [[obstetrician]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]], [[Texas]], delivering many of his constituents' babies even while serving in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. In 2001, he was one of only eight doctors in the House (including dentists); even fewer of them continued to practice while in office. The Congressman is occasionally approached by younger area residents to thank him for attending their births.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

After [[2003 Texas redistricting|2003 redistricting]], Paul oversees a district larger than [[Massachusetts]],<ref name="washpost96">{{cite news | title = GOP House Candidate Responds to Charges | accessdate = 2007-09-11 | last = Pressley | first = Sue Ann | date = 1996-05-26 | work = Washington Post}}</ref> with 675&nbsp;miles (1100&nbsp;kilometers) of [[Gulf of Mexico]] coastline between [[Houston]] and [[Corpus Christi]], covering some 22&nbsp;counties. Even so, Paul opposes programs like [[National Flood Insurance Program|federally funded flood insurance]], legislation typically supported by coastal and rural representatives: it requires those outside flood zones to subsidize those within, but prohibits those within flood zones from choosing their own insurers. In an overwhelmingly rural region known for ranching and rice farms, Paul opposes farm subsidies because they are paid to large corporations rather than small farmers. Despite voting against bills heavily supported in Congress, like the farm bill, Paul's contrarian nature and devotion to lowering taxes continuously appeals to 14th district voters:<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> when Paul surveyed them, 54% of his constituency agreed with his goal of eliminating the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst97/tst072097.htm | title = Parents must have control of education | accessdate = 2007-09-13 | last = Paul | first = Ron | date = 1997-07-20 | work = Texas Straight Talk | publisher = House of Representatives}}</ref>

While Paul votes against most spending bills, he has diverted funds that have already been authorized by other bills into his own district.<ref name="wsj2003">{{cite web | url = http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB104725224693862700.html | title = A Far-Right Texan Inspires Antiwar Left | accessdate = 2007-06-15 | last = Murray | first = Shailagh | date = 2003-03-10 | work = Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Paul spends extra time in the district addressing constituents' concerns, to compensate for "violat[ing] almost every rule of political survival you can think of",<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> sometimes three to four days a week, often accompanied by grandchildren. He attends graduations, civic ceremonies, and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] honor ceremonies. In an expansive district, he often logs over 300&nbsp;miles (500&nbsp;kilometers) daily, visiting [[constituents]] or handling their concerns. He reaches out to 14th district voters on veterans' issues, such as procuring medals for war veterans who lost or never received their medals, and holding medal ceremonies for those whose medals are being presented. He has helped senior citizens of the district get free or low-cost prescription drugs through a little-known drug company program; his staff sends out birthday cards to constituents, as well as [[condolence]] cards on the deaths of family members.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

===Legislation===
Paul sponsors many more bills than the average representative, such as those that would abolish the [[income tax]]<ref name="endirs"/> or the [[Federal Reserve]]; many do not escape committee review. Nevertheless, he has been named one of the "50&nbsp;Most Effective Members of Congress" by ''Congressional Quarterly''.<ref name="ronpaulis">{{cite web | url = http://www.ronpaulforcongress.com/html/ronpaulis.html | title = Ron Paul Is… | accessdate = 2007-06-15 | publisher = Ron Paul for Congress}}</ref> He has sponsored successful legislation to prevent the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] from seizing a church in New York through [[eminent domain]], and a bill transferring ownership of the [[Lake Texana]] dam project from the federal government to [[Texas]].<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> By successfully amending other legislation, he has also barred International Criminal Court jurisdiction over the U.S. military (2002), American participation in any U.N. "global tax" (2005), and surveillance on peaceful First-Amendment activities by citizens (2006).<ref>{{cite news | title = Paul says Americans' freedoms under siege | url = http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1007/6277_Page2.html | last = Bresnahan | first = John | publisher = Politico | date = 2007-10-10 | accessdate = 2007-10-10}}</ref>

Paul has introduced bills that would apply a $5,000 tax credit per child towards spending on any type of children's education–related expenses, [[public education|public]], [[Private education#North America|private]], or [[Homeschooling|homeschool]]. He has introduced the [[Family Education Freedom Act]] in every Congressional session since 1997; the bill currently has six co-sponsors.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hslda.org/legislation/national/2001/HR368/default.asp | title = H.R. 368 — Family Education Freedom Act of 2001 | accessdate = 2007-09-13 | date = 2002-06-27 | publisher = Home School Legal Defense Association}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/110_HR_1056.html | title = H.R. 1056, The Family Education Freedom Act of 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-13 | publisher = Washington Watch}}</ref> He has also introduced companion legislation in the form of the [[Teacher Tax Cut Act]], which would provide all elementary and secondary school teachers with a $1,000 tax cut, and the Professional Educators Tax Relief Act, which would give all K–12 school librarians, counselors, and other personnel the same $1,000 tax credit.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2003/cr021103d.htm | title = Teacher Tax Cut Act | accessdate = 2007-09-14 | publisher = House of Representatives | work = Congressional Record}}</ref> He has also introduced the [[Education Improvement Tax Cut Act]], which would allow $5,000 deductions for any type of donations to scholarships or to benefit academics at any school.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.educationpolicy.org/newsletter/EEMar99.htm | title = Rep. Paul Introduces Education Package | accessdate = 2007-09-14 | date = 1999-03 | work= Education Exchange | publisher = Education Policy}}</ref>

In [[March 2001]], Paul introduced the "Constitutional War Powers Resolution of 2001", which would repeal the 1973 [[War Powers Resolution]] (WPR) and thus prohibit presidents from initiating a war without a formal [[Declaration of war by the United States|declaration of war by Congress]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22022 | title = Bill would restore Congress' war powers | accessdate = 2007-06-13 | first = Jon | last= Dougherty | date = 2001-03-13 | work = WorldNetDaily}}</ref> Later in 2001, Paul voted for the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force]], which authorized the president, pursuant to WPR, to respond to those responsible for the [[2001]] [[World Trade Center]] terror attack.<ref name="AUMF"/> In order to prevent Congress from yielding its Constitutional authority to declare war to the executive branch, which does not Constitutionally hold that power, Paul introduced legislation in October 2002 giving Congress the opportunity to declare war on [[Iraq]], rather than merely "authorizing" the president to deploy forces without a declaration of war. He said he would not vote for his own bill, but if his fellow members of Congress wished to go to war in Iraq, they should follow the Constitution and declare war. As one of six Republicans to vote against the Iraq War Resolution, Paul inspired the founding of a group called the National Peace Lobby Project to promote a resolution he and Oregon representative [[Peter DeFazio]] sponsored to repeal the war authorization in February 2003. His speech, 35&nbsp;"Questions That Won't Be Asked About Iraq",<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr091002.htm | title = Questions That Won't Be Asked About Iraq | accessdate = 2007-07-12 | first = Ron | last = Paul | date = 2002-09-10 | publisher= House of Representatives | work = Congressional Record}}</ref> was translated and published in German, French, Russian, Italian, and Swiss periodicals before the Iraq War began.<ref name="wsj2003"/>

Paul says his fellow members of Congress have increased government spending by 75% during [[George W. Bush]]'s administration.<ref name="endirs"/> After a 2005 bill was touted as "slashing" government waste, Paul wrote that it decreased spending by a fraction of one percent and that "Congress couldn't slash spending if the members' lives depended on it."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul287.html | title = Too Little Too Late | accessdate = 2007-06-13 | first = Ron | last = Paul | date = 2005-11-15 | publisher = Lew Rockwell}}</ref> Paul said that between 2001 and early 2004 he had voted against more than 700&nbsp;bills intended to expand government.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lewrockwell.com/yates/yates92.html | title = An Evening With Dr. Ron Paul | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | first = Steven | last = Yates, Ph.D. | date = 2004-04-07 | publisher = Lew Rockwell}}</ref>

Paul charged his fellow legislators with voting for the Patriot Act without reading it first; more than 300&nbsp;pages long, it was enacted into law less than 24&nbsp;hours after being introduced. In response to such Congressional actions, Paul introduced "Sunlight Rule" legislation, which would not allow votes on legislation to occur until ten days after its introduction, with the intent of giving lawmakers enough time to read bills before voting on them. The bill requires allotting 72&nbsp;hours for House members and staff to examine the contents of amendments.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2007/tst091607.htm | title = The Sunlight Rule | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | first = Ron | last = Paul | date = 2007-09-16 | publisher = House of Representatives | work = Texas Straight Talk}}</ref>

In 2005 and 2007, Paul introduced the Sanctity of Life Act, which would define human life as beginning from [[human fertilization|conception]], removing abortion from federal jurisdiction and effectively negating ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.1094.IH: | title = Sanctity of Life Act of 2007 | publisher = Thomas}}</ref><ref name="lifeliberty"/> Paul has also introduced a Constitutional amendment with similar intent. Such laws would permit states to declare abortion to be murder and to outlaw new fetal stem cell research and some contraception and fertility treatments.<ref>{{cite news | last = Sealover | first = E | date = 2007-07-16 | url = http://www.gazette.com/articles/abortion_24888___article.html/colorado_group.html | title = Ballot initiative would outlaw abortion | work = Colorado Springs Gazette}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Stevens | first = A | date = 2007-06-10 | url = http://www.connectsavannah.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A313 | title = 'Missing angels' or misogyny? | work = Women's eNews | publisher = Connect Savannah}}</ref> Also in 2005 and 2007, Paul introduced the [[We the People Act]], which would forbid all federal courts from hearing cases on [[abortion]], [[same-sex marriage]], sexual practices, and government display of religious symbols, texts, and images. The Act would make federal court decisions on those subjects nonbinding as precedent in state courts,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ronpaulaudio.com/rpaudio/RonPaulRandiRhodesAirAmericainterview081607.m3u | publisher = Ron Paul Audio | work = Air America | date = 2007-08-16 | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | last = Rhodes | first = Randi | title = Ron Paul interview battles Air America Randi Rhodes Show}}</ref> and would forbid federal courts from spending money to enforce their judgments.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.300: | title = We the People Act of 2007 | publisher = Thomas}}</ref>

On October 15, 2007 Ron Paul introduced the [[American Freedom Agenda Act of 2007]] which would "bar the use of evidence obtained through torture; require that federal intelligence gathering is conducted in accordance with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA); create a mechanism for challenging presidential signing statements; repeal the Military Commissions Act, which, among other things, denies habeas corpus to certain detainees; prohibit kidnapping, detentions, and torture abroad; protect journalists who publish information received from the executive branch; and ensure that secret evidence is not used to designate individuals or organizations with a presence in the U.S. as foreign terrorists."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2165/t/1027/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=17371&t= | publisher = American Freedom Campaign | date = 2007-10-15 | accessdate = 2007-10-15 | title = Tell your U.S. Representative to co-sponsor the American Freedom Agenda Act}}</ref>

===Actions in Congress===
Paul was on a bipartisan coalition of 17&nbsp;members of Congress that sued [[President]] [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] in 1999 over his conduct of the [[Kosovo]] war. They accused Clinton of failing to inform Congress of the action's status within 48&nbsp;hours as required by [[War Powers Resolution|WPR]], and of failing to obtain Congressional declaration of war as specifically required in the Constitution. Congress had voted 427–2 against a declaration of war with [[Yugoslavia]], and had voted to deny support for the air campaign in Kosovo. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that since Congress had voted for funding after Clinton had actively engaged troops in the war with Kosovo, legislators had sent a confusing message about whether they approved of the war. Paul said that the judge's decision attempted to circumvent the Constitution and to authorize the president to conduct a war without approval from Congress.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press99/pr060999.htm | title = Judge sides with Clinton | accessdate = 2007-06-12 | first = Ron | last = Paul | date = 1999-06-09 | publisher = House of Representatives}}</ref>

Several online donation drives have been formed with the aim of coordinating donations to the Ron Paul Campaign.

Another popular donation drive, with less expense to supporters, is the Ron Paul Money Bomb<ref>http://www.ronpaulmoneybomb.com/</ref>, a long term e-mailing list aiming to launch brief "money bombs" with a goal of 40,000 people donating $25 every week for a total of $1 million per week.

Ron Paul's official campaign site informs volunteers running donation drives of their need to comply with federal regulations and popular methods used by volunteers to raise money. <ref>http://www.ronpaul2008.com/get-involved/grass-roots-guidelines/</ref>

Paul opposes [[inflation]], viewing it as an underhanded form of "taxation" due to the fact that it takes value away from the money that individuals hold without having to directly tax them. He said in one presidential debate that "a dollar today is worth 4 cents compared to a dollar in 1913 when the Federal Reserve got in," holding the Fed's ability to "print" money without being backed by a commodity such as gold as the cause. He argues that [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]], such as backed by gold or silver, would prevent inflation but says he does not advocate going back to the gold standard, i.e. tying the U.S. dollar to gold.<ref> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Ron_Paul_political_positions</ref> Rather, he wishes to legalize gold and silver as [[legal tender]] so that gold-backed notes issued from the private markets can compete with fiat Federal Reserve notes; this, he believes, will help restrain inflation as well as limit government spending and the expansion of government (since government would be deprived of the income derived from inflation).<ref>Interview with Ron Paul on Fox Business Network 10/16/2007 [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXfDHXpP87o]</ref>
