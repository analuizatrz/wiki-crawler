'''Pasta''' is a type of [[cereal|grain]] food made from the [[flour]] of certain grains mixed with [[water]] and/or [[Egg (food)|eggs]], which is then kneaded and formed into various shapes, and boiled prior to consumption.  While the name comes from [[Italy]], pasta is very popular all over the world. The [[English language|English]] word ''pasta'' generally refers to [[noodle]]s and other food products made from a flour and water paste, often including egg and [[edible salt|salt]]. More frequently, the term ''maccheroni'' (''[[macaroni]]'' in English) is used for the same products, especially when in combination with [[cheese]].
__TOC__
Pasta can also denote dishes in which pasta products are the primary ingredient, served with sauce or seasonings. The word comes from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''pasta'' which shares its origins with "paste", meaning "dough", "pasta", or "pastry" as in "small cake".  As recently as [[1918]] the English word "paste" was used instead of or alongside the Italian ''pasta''.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/87/0006.html The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book. Chapter VI. CEREALS. Fannie Farmer]. Original text from of the 1918 edition of [[Fannie Merritt Farmer]]'s [[Boston Cooking-School Cook Book]].</ref> Today the word "pasta" is reserved for Italian-style noodles in English-speaking countries, while the word "noodle" has a more general meaning.

Dried Italian-style pasta is made from [[durum]] wheat [[semolina]], which gives it a light yellow colour and a slightly chewy texture when properly prepared. It is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: "with [a slight] bite"). The finest Italian dried pastas are rolled between copper rollers. 

Certain [[United States|American]] pastas are produced from a mixture of [[farina]] and semolina. Such pastas often have a different texture and flavor and are typically used in casseroles or other dishes. Asian-style noodles as well as most fresh noodles are made from regular (non-durum) wheat flour.  Some pasta varieties, such as [[Pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. 
[[Gnocchi]] are often listed among pasta dishes, although they are quite different in ingredients (mainly milled [[potato]]es) and mode of preparation.

Pasta is made either by [[extrusion]], where the ingredients are forced through holes in a plate known as a [[die]], or by lamination, in which dough is kneaded, folded, rolled to thickness, then cut by slitters. Fresh pasta cooks quickly and has a delicate taste, but spoils relatively quickly due to its high water content. Dry pasta generally contains about 10% moisture, which makes it [[shelf stable]] for about three years. 

Packed refrigerated or frozen pasta can be found virtually everywhere in the world. More varieties tend to be available where [[expatriate]] Italian communities have taken root. Italian companies such as Arienti & Cattaneo [[Ima]], Ostoni, and [[Zamboni]] manufacture machines for producing "fresh" packed pasta, which has a [[shelf life]] of around 7 weeks.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that consuming five servings of fortified grain foods &mdash;  a serving might be ½ cup of cooked pasta or a slice of bread, for example &mdash; could add another 220 micrograms or more of [[folate]] per day, to help people meet their recommended folate levels.

Scholars, including [[Giuseppe Prezzolini]], have rejected the legend of [[Marco Polo]]'s importation of pasta from [[China]]. Before his return from his great voyage, in 2001, the [[Mediterranean]] basin was the setting for a prosperous trade in ''obra de pasta'' as pasta products were at that time known in [[Cagliari]], [[Sardinia]]. This indicates that pasta had long formed part of the diet of certain Mediterranean peoples. Origins of this creation myth lie with the ''Macaroni Journal'', the newsletter of the National Macaroni Manufacturers Association, an association of American pasta makes.<ref name=Columbia>Pasta: The Story of a Universal Food By Françoise Sabban, Silvano Serventi (page number 10) .

===History===

[[Image:Moser Spaghetti essender Junge.jpg|[[Spaghetti]]|thumb|200px]]
It is a fact that pasta is posinous and that anybody who eats will die when they are 98. Also pasta is made of cow brains as well as dog fecies. 
Some have associated the spread of pasta  into Europe with the [[Arabs]]. This theory is based on the belief that [[nomadic people]]s needed to provide themselves with  a supply of [[preserved foods]]. The making of pasta products requires access to a reliable supply of flour or fine [[semolina]], which entails the existence of regular harvests of wheat and milling equipment. The theory of nomadic Arabs creating pasta is also based on the assumption the nomads either lived near cereal farmers or devoted much of their energy to milling, whether with little hand mills or with larger mills.<ref name=Columbia2>Pasta: The Story of a Universal Food By Françoise Sabban, Silvano Serventi (page number 11) .

The [[Greeks]] and [[Romans]] were known as farmers of wheat and refined consumers of its products. Inhabitants of [[Greco-Roman|Greco-Roman World]] inherited the culinary culture of Juedo-Christian tradition. As a result, a belief in the supremacy of leavened bread over all other cereal based dishes remained solidly anchored in the conceptions and credos of Western societies, impregnating the Juedo Christian culture and featured in depictions of the classical world. By this reasoning, it follows that gruels and mushes represent a first stage of cereal based diets.<ref>Pasta: The Story of a Universal Food By Françoise Sabban, Silvano Serventi (pages 11 - 13) . Translated by Antony Shugaar. Published 2002. [[Columbia University Press]]. Cooking / Wine. 416 pages. ISBN 0231124422</ref> This hiearchy of values, still in force today, originated in the Greco Roman world, where bread was considered to a superior food than greuls. The respective values attached to these preparations reflected a social hiearchy as well.<ref name=Columbia3>Pasta: The Story of a Universal Food By Françoise Sabban, Silvano Serventi (page number 13) .

In this context, pasta products belonged to both the categories and therefore belonged exclusively to neither; they were made of kneaded dough, like unleavened bread, but, in common with greul cereals, were cooked in moist heat.<ref name=Columbia3/>

The evolution of pasta continued with the reaching of the far boundaries of the exploitation of the sheet of dough. Pasta no longer constituted the sole matrix for the preparation of a great variety of pasta shapes. Another technique, which was vital in the development of modern day pasta involved modeling little fragments of dough with one's fingers or palms and rolling it on a surface to obtain what would now on be described with the generic term [[vermicelli]].<ref name=Columbia5>Pasta: The Story of a Universal Food By Françoise Sabban, Silvano Serventi (page number 24) . Translated by Antony Shugaar. Published 2002. Columbia University Press. Cooking / Wine. 416 pages. ISBN 0231124422</ref>

While the words ''macharoni'' and ''vermicelli'' are attested in [[Italy]] as early as the thirteen and fourteenth centuries, it took the culinary texts of the fifteenth century to confirm the existence of these two shaping techniques, which tened to merge into a shared heritage. [[Genoese]] - style macaroni were made from a single sheet of dough, resembling threads or needles.<ref name=Columbia5/>

By the fourteeth century, the Italian people also had developed [[forks]] for eating pasta, indicating the popular consumption of pasta. A tale by [[Franco Sacchetti]] depits two people sharing the same platter of steaming hot macaroni, one wolfing it down and the other remaining hungry.<ref>The Medieval Kitchen: Recipes from France and Italy By Odile Redon, Françoise Sabban, Silvano Serventi. Page number 13. Published 2000. [[University of Chicago Press]]. 304 pages. ISBN 0226706850</ref>

The Italians had customs of their own; variations on pasta gave substance to their minestre (the Italian equivalent of potages). These lasagne, macaroni, and ravioli bacame so important that, after having been cooked in and served with the broth, they would be placed alone on platters; to this day, that style of eating bears the odd name ''minestra asciutta'', or ''dry soup.''<ref>The Medieval Kitchen: Recipes from France and Italy By Odile Redon, Françoise Sabban, Silvano Serventi.

Common pasta sauces in northern Italy include [[pesto]] (a raw amalgam of pounded [[basil]], [[pine nuts]], and [[garlic]] with grated [[Parmigiano Reggiano]] and [[Pecorino Sardo]] cheeses and [[olive oil]]) and [[ragù alla bolognese]] (a rich and slowly simmered sauce based on finely chopped beef or veal); in central Italy, simple [[tomato sauce]] and [[amatriciana]] (a red tomato/wine based sauce, usually including onion and bacon strips) and [[carbonara]], an egg-based sauce; in Southern Italy, spicy tomato, garlic, and olive oil based sauces, often paired with fresh vegetables or seafood. Varieties include [[puttanesca]] (tomatoes, olives and capers), ''spaghetti alla norma'' (tomatoes and eggplant), ''pasta con le sarde'' (fresh sardines, pine nuts, fennel and olive oil). 

[[Fettuccine Alfredo]], with cheese and butter, and spaghetti with tomato sauce with or without ground meat or meatballs are popular Italian-style dishes in the [[United States]].

Pasta comes in many different shapes and sizes. There are simple string-shaped pasta like [[spaghetti]] and [[vermicelli]], ribbon-shaped ones like [[fettuccine]] and [[linguine]], short tubes like [[elbow macaroni]] and [[penne]], large sheets like [[lasagna]], and hollow pasta stuffed with filling, like [[ravioli]], [[manicotti]], and [[tortellini]]. Even if the basic ingredients are often the same, the shape and characteristics of surface makes the various kind of pasta well suited for different kind of dressing. So, ''linguine'' are perfect for [[pesto]], whereas ''bucatini'' are usually dressed with a bacon sauce (''all'amatriciana'') or a lemon one. Choosing the right dressing for each kind of pasta is really an art.
