The '''Ford Taurus''' is a [[mid-size]], [[front wheel drive]] [[automobile|car]] manufactured by the [[Ford Motor Company]] in [[North America]]. It was introduced in December 1985 as a 1986 model, replacing the [[Ford Fairmont|Fairmont]]-based, [[rear wheel drive]] [[Ford LTD]].  

The Taurus was a milestone design for both Ford and the entire American automotive industry, as well as a very influential vehicle in the marketplace, with Ford selling nearly 7.5 million examples during its 20 years of production &mdash; a longer bestselling run than the original [[Ford Model T]].<ref name="garr">{{cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/automobiles/16LINCOLN.html?ex=1310702400&en=6ba00b02aa09adef&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|last=Garrett|first=Jerry|date=[[2006-07-16]]|work=[[New York Times]]|title=Town Car’s Next Stop: Retirement|accessdate=2006-08-18}}</ref>

Most Tauruses were built either in [[Chicago, Illinois]] (until [[April 23]], [[2004]], at which time the plant was retooled to build the Five Hundred) or in Ford's Hapeville Plant in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

==Development==
[[Image:Taurusdesign2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Taurus clay model along with many of the original design sketches.]]
When Ford set out to develop the Taurus, they employed a new strategy of teamwork, that would prove to be revolutionary in the car development process. <ref name = "Taub" /> Originally, Ford, as well as [[General Motors]],  had its engineers, as well as the exterior and interior designers work separately without any input from each other. As a result, many American cars at the time had their interiors seem "mismatched". <ref name = "Taub" /> Taurus development started as early as 1981, using a similar development method that Ford used when developing the [[Ford Escort (North American)|Escort]], where they had engineers from all Ford branches of the world work together in a joint effort. <ref>{{cite web|last=Visnic|first=Bill|date=[[1996-3-1]]|publisher=Ward's Autoworld| url=http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_escort_fords_years/|title=Escort: Ford's 15 years on a learning curve| accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> Unlike the Escort, though, the Taurus was developed entirely by American engineers at Ford's headquarters. <ref name = "Taub" /> The new team of engineers was assembled by [[Jack Telnack]], and was dubbed "Team Taurus". <ref name = "Taub" />

The Taurus went through many revisions throughout its development. Original prototypes contained a full glass roof similar to that of the [[Subaru SVX]], though it was abandoned  because it was deemed to be "too radical". <ref name = "Taub" /> Customer input played an instrumental role in the Taurus' development, as many components including radios, steering wheels, seats, wheels, and entire suspension setups were selected by large numbers of average people though a series of surveys conducted by Ford <ref name = "Taub" />. This was not the only thing that played a part in the Taurus' development. Ford disassembled many competing cars such as [[Toyota Camry]]s, [[Honda Accord]]s, and even [[BMW E28|BMW 5 series]] automobiles in order to examine their parts and components. <ref name = "Taub" />

The premiere for the Taurus was a resounding one. In mid [[1985]], Ford gathered executives and the press for the unveiling of the Taurus and Sable. The event was held at the [[MGM Studios]] Soundstage 85, where [[Gone with the Wind]] was filmed. The studio was decorated in a space theme, with stars on the walls, flying saucer decorations, and refreshments served to the spectators in flying saucer shaped coolers. For the unveiling, spacey music started playing, as projected stars floated around the room in dance floor fashon. The outlines of the cars glowed green thought the curtain, and the curtain flew up to reveal the cars, as strobe lights flashed, highlighting the cars.<ref name = "Taub">{{cite book|title=Taurus: The Making of the Car That Saved Ford|first=Eric|last=Taub|year=1991|month=Nov|id=ISBN 0-525-93372-7|publisher=[[E. P. Dutton]]}}</ref>

Although Ford had announced that the Taurus was to be made into a production vehicle, many industry journalists, as well as executives at Ford and [[Chrysler Corporation]] believed that the Taurus was going to be a failure. <ref name = "Taub" /> Executves at Chrysler believed that the Taurus was going to fail dramatically, and customers would instead embrace their new [[Dodge Dynasty]] and [[Chrysler New Yorker]], which were more traditional automobiles. <ref name = "Taub" /> Executives at Ford knew that producing the Taurus was a gamble, as they ran the risk of the car being so advanced that it would turn off potential customers. As a result, Ford continued to produce the LTD, which the Taurus was designed to replace, in 1986. <ref name = "Taub" /> If the Taurus failed, Ford would not have been able to survive it, and would have had to file for [[chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]]. <ref name = "Taub" /> The Taurus ended up being a resounding success, selling over a million units in its first generation alone. <ref name = "Taub" />

The first generation Taurus was launched in 1986 to strong fanfare and sales, and is a very important figure in the history of the American automotive industry.

Ford had a range of rear wheel drive cars while [[Chrysler]] and [[General Motors]] was making most of their cars front wheel drive. With the introduction of the [[Ford Tempo|Tempo]] Ford had started its transition into making its line up contain front wheel drive vehicles as well. When Ford set to replace the slow selling LTD, they designed the Taurus to have a rounder, more "organic" shape (That was often described as '[[jelly bean]]' or 'flying potato' shaped<ref name="jellybean">{{cite web|last=Schneiderman|first=R.M.|date=[[2006-10-27]]|publisher=Forbes| url=http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2006/10/27/ford-taurus-demise-cx_rs_1027autofacescan01.html|title=Ford Taurus, R.I.P.| accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>) inspired by that of the [[Audi 5000]], as well as Ford's own Tempo. The aerodynamic design of the Taurus was not purely cosmetic, however. Its aerodynamic shape made the car more fuel efficient,  allowing Ford to meet the more stringent [[CAFE]] standards applied by the [[United States]] government. <ref name = "Taub" /> The design proved successful and helped to launch Ford into a new era of prosperity. The Taurus ultimately led to an American [[automobile]] [[design]] revolution that saw the end of the 'boxy' cars of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="Taub" />

The Taurus used flush aerodynamic composite [[headlights]]. The Taurus and Sable were the first domestically-produced, mainstream sedans to use the new lights. They also went beyond the 1984 [[Audi 5000]], with which they were often compared, to adopt a grille-less 'bottom breather' nose, first pioneered by the [[Citroën DS]] in the 1950s, and also used briefly on the Mustang. Some special performance models were fitted with additional ventilation openings.

The bodyshell was smooth and aerodynamic. The Sable twin had a wraparound "lightbar" with two headlights and a low-wattage stretch in between. The doors went into the roof, and the handles were recessed. The Taurus also had large glass areas with slim pillars, and were flushed into the body, not recessed. The interior was available with bucket seats — very rare for most U.S. midsize sedans — and the dashboard wrapped around the driver and fed into the door panels to create more of a "cockpit" feel.<ref name="bestselling">{{cite web|last=DiPetro|first=John|date=[[2003-04-18]]|publisher=Edmunds| url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46007|title=Inside Line: Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable| accessdate=2006-05-29}}</ref>

[[Image:'86-'91 Ford Taurus Wagon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|First generation Ford Taurus wagon]]
For 1986, the engines were a 90&nbsp;hp (67&nbsp;kW) 2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Ford HSC engine|HSC]]'' 4-cylinder found in the ''[[manual transmission|MT]]-5'' and ''L'' models or a new 140&nbsp;hp (104&nbsp;kW) 3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Vulcan engine|Vulcan]]'' [[V6]], optional on the ''L'' and standard on the ''GL'' and ''LX'' models. The MT-5 was equipped with a 5-speed [[manual transmission]], ''Vulcan'' models used a newly-designed 4-speed ''[[Ford AXOD transmission|AXOD]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]], while ''HSC''-equipped cars used the 3-speed ''[[Ford ATX transmission|ATX]]'' automatic.

The MT-5 and&nbsp;L models were basic, starting at [[USD|US$]]10,500, with the GL offering a few interior upgrades like rear headrests and a folding armrest, as well as the standard 3.0&nbsp;L V6. The LX was loaded with [[air conditioning]], [[power window]]s, power seats, electric door locks, a cassette stereo and [[cruise control]], although these features were also available as options on the other cars. The top-of-the-line LX [[station wagon]] sold for $14,300. By 1989, the top-of-the-line car offered automatic temperature control, keypad door locks, electronic instrument cluster, trip computer and power passenger seats.

Ford's 3.8&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|Essex]]'' [[V6]] was added to the lineup in 1988. Although the power output was rated at the same 140&nbsp;hp (104&nbsp;kW) as the 3.0&nbsp;L engine, this large V6 produced 215&nbsp;ft·lbf (291&nbsp;N·m) of [[torque]], a welcome addition, especially in the heavier wagons. However, the 3.8 suffered from a premature failure of head gaskets, which was a fault with Ford's supplier of gaskets, not necessarily with the engine itself. 

In 1990, the interior received a facelift, incorporating a new [[steering wheel]] design with an [[airbag]], a new [[gear shift]]er and a new [[dashboard]] with a new instrument panel. The 2.5&nbsp;L four was given [[Sequential fuel injection|SFI]], increasing power by 15&nbsp;hp (11.2&nbsp;kW) and torque by 10&nbsp;ft·lbf (13.6&nbsp;N·m), as did the 3.0&nbsp;L V6, although output remained the same for that engine. The 3.8&nbsp;L continued unchanged. All but the SHO were fitted with a 4-speed automatic for 1990 and a new electronic ''[[Ford AXOD-E transmission|AXOD-E]]'' transmission in 1991. LX cars were also fitted with [[anti-lock brake]]s as standard that year.

===First generation SHO===
[[Image:Taurus-SHO-2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A first generation Ford Taurus SHO with the "Plus" package]]
In 1989, the high performance SHO model was added. It is said that the reason why the SHO was created was because a lightweight two-seater sports car was under development by Ford to compete with the ''[[Pontiac Fiero]]'' and the ''[[Toyota MR2]]''.  Ford had sealed a deal with Yamaha for engines for this new car, but since the 'sporty car' market was falling, Ford scrapped the project, having already received a shipment of engines from Yamaha for the car, with many more in production.  To utilize these otherwise redundant engines, Ford instead decided to put them in the Taurus, creating the SHO.<ref name="SHONTELL">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordmuscle.com/archives/2005/08/SHOnTell/|title=SHO n Tell|work=Jon Mikelonis and Matt Wilder|accessdate=2006-07-28}}</ref> As a result, Ford initially advertised the SHO as a limited production vehicle.<ref>{{cite video

The SHO differed from the normal Taurus on the exterior by having a set of ground effects and a rear spoiler. The interior also differed by having sports seats and an 8000&nbsp;rpm [[tachometer]]. The SHO became the only Taurus to feature a [[manual transmission]] since the MT5 was discontinued in that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G1/index.html |title=Generation 1 Spotter's Guide |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher= Taurus Car Club of America |date= |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>

A 'special edition' of the SHO was offered in 1991 that had some different styling cues from the 'normal' SHO, such as a new hood, painted wheels and other cosmetic details. This was called the SHO Plus Package.<ref name="shotimes">{{cite web|url=http://www.shotimes.com/php-bin/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0&sid=20|title=The 1991 SHO "Plus" Option|work=SHOTIMES mailing list|accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>

The ''Taurus'' received its first significant cosmetic update in 1992 (a nearly-invisible front headlight/grille change happened in 1989), which modernized the interior and the front and rear fascias. The operation cost Ford $650 million at the time. With the older model facing slumping sales, this new model brought sales back up again, with 410,000 examples sold during 1992, a number unheard of even today.<ref name="det" /> While the design was basically the same, every body panel except for the roof was changed.

Wagon versions that retained the front bench seat and were equipped with the optional rear facing third seat had seating capacity for eight passengers. The ''Taurus'' was the best-selling car in the United States for every year of this cosmetic update.<ref name= "bestselling"/>

The 2.5L four-cylinder engine had been eliminated after 1991, making the 3.0L V6 standard in all non-SHO models (except the LX Wagon, which had the 3.8L standard) from 1992-on. The next year (1993), the cheaper L base model was gone, as were other unpopular optional features such as the "InstaClear" heated windshield and the front cornering lamps on GL and LX models. For both 3.0L and 3.8L V6 engines, the drive belt system became a single-belt setup for 1993 (previously, the alternator had used a separate belt). A passenger-side airbag became standard for 1994, including a redesigned drivers side airbag and steering wheel (though this newer look had been on the SHO since 1993), finally replacing the "block" air bag of 1990-1993. Also for 1994, all wheel options were now 15". Previously, 14" wheels were standard on GL models. For 1994 and 1995, the LX model received unique crystiline headlamps.<ref name = "Consumerguide">{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1995-ford-taurus.htm |title=1990-1995 Ford Taurus Review |work=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>

The wagon version was available with mostly the same options as the sedan versions. Wagons had a maximum of 81.1 cubic feet of cargo area with the 60/40 split rear seat folded down. They featured a 2-way liftgate (raise the entire liftgate or just the window), a roof rack with crossbar and tie-downs, an optional rear-facing third seat, a lockable under-floor compartment, and an optional fold-out picnic table. With both rear split seats in the upright position, standard cargo capacity was 45.7 cubic feet.

The last year of this updated Taurus generation was 1995. For the 1995 model year, a sportier ''SE'' model was added; similarly the Sable added the rare "LTS" trim level. It featured alloy wheels which were borrowed from the LX, had combination leather/cloth bucket seats separated by a console, unique "Crystalline" headlamp assemblies also borrowed from the LX, and a rear deck lid "lip" spoiler borrowed from the SHO. The SE trim had either the standard 3.0L Vulcan V6 or the optional 3.8L Essex V6. Other models gained standard air conditioning and rear window defroster, depending on the market, these may have already been standard equipment.

The second generation also came in a modified Police version.  A police Taurus was a GL trim with the 3.8L Essex V6 engine that was slightly different than the regular Essex engine. <ref name = "Engines">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Engine/index.html |title=Ford Taurus engines |work= |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date= |accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> The police version of this engine use high silicone alloy pistons which can be identified by two notches in the top of the piston. Output of the police version essex was 15bhp greater than the standard due to the addition of a dual exhaust muffler system, similar to that standard on the SHO; a Y-pipe was added after the resonator which allowed for the split to both sides of the rear of the vehicle. <ref name = "Wolfe">{{cite web |url=http://www.denniswolfe.com/Taurus/Police.htm |title=Tauruses serving the community |work=Denniswolfe.com/Taurus |publisher=Denniswolfe.com |date= |accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref>  Other changes included a larger fuel tank, stainless steel brake lines, standard 4-wheel disc with ABS, a modified front grill fascia that had a slit in it to allow for increased airflow to the radiator, and a calibrated 140 MPH speedometer. <ref name = "TCCA" />

===Second generation SHO===
[[Image:Ford Taurus SHO (second-gen).jpg|thumb|left|250px|A second generation SHO]]
The SHO model continued with the same powertrain as before: The Yamaha-developed 3.0L V6 and 5-speed manual transmission. The new second generation SHO gets its own distinctive front fascia with a unique front bumper cover that incorporated fog lights and a lower front spoiler, as well as side claddings.  The hood, fenders, headlights, and marker lights were borrowed from the Mercury Sable, but no middle light bar.<ref name="TCCA">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G2/index.html |title=Generation 2 Spotters Guide |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2006-12-18 |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>

The lack of an automatic transmission had hurt sales, which was a situation that Ford rectified in 1993.  A 3.2&nbsp;L version of the [[Ford SHO V6 engine]] was introduced for automatic-equipped SHO, which still had 220&nbsp;hp (164&nbsp;kW), but now boasted 215&nbsp;ft·lbf (292&nbsp;N·m), a 15&nbsp;ft·lbf (20.3&nbsp;N·m) increase over the 3.0&nbsp;L version.<ref name = "Consumerguide" />

In 1993, Ford did a minor redesign of the SHO interior, updating the center console. Other changes for 1993 included a trunklid spoiler, with integrated center high mount stop lamp.<ref name="TCCA" />

The second generation SHO entered popular culture due to the fact that a 1992 model is owned by comedian [[Conan O'Brien]], and that he often talks about it on [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]], his late night [[talk show]], when speaking about his personal life and interests.<ref name="Shoners">{{cite web|url= http://www.shotimes.com/php-bin/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0&sid=18|title=Famous SHO owners|work=SHOTIMES FAQ|accessdate=2006-07-28}}</ref> He devoted a special segment of the show to his SHO onetime, where in a fictional skit, he set off to sell the vehicle and use the money to buy a large estate in [[Europe]]. In the skit, he fails to sell the car, but then pretends to sell the car to [[Brad Pitt]].

This model never got past prototype form, and the Car and Driver staff as well as Ford admitted that the SHO wagon was created "just for fun", and was never meant to be a serious production vehicle. <ref name = "CAD" /> However, there have been successful amateur conversions.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.klimesgroup.com/showagon/second.htm|title=Thumper, the SHO wagon|work=|accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref>

[[Image:3rd-Ford-Taurus-wagon.jpg|thumb|left|Taurus wagon]]
The 1996 model year saw the first complete redesign for the Taurus. Ford hoped the radical redesign would lead to the same success it had had with the 1986 Taurus. The controversial oval theme, such as the oval rear windshield and the oval center radio/center console, was not well received by the press and the public, and is ultimately blamed as the reason the Taurus lost its bestseller status to the [[Toyota Camry]] in 1997.<ref name="mW">{{cite book|title=Car: A Drama of The American Workplace|first=Mary|last=Walton|year=1997|month=May|publisher=[[W. W. Norton]]|id=ISBN 0-393-04080-1}}</ref>

Another factor that was to blame for the sales decline of the Taurus was the substantial price increase from the previous model. The suggested retail price for the 1996 model increased US$2,500 over the 1995 model. The 1996 Taurus attempted to move upmarket and the result was a car with more standard and optional features. The 1996 model could be equipped with the powerful 200&nbsp;hp (149&nbsp;kW) 3.0&nbsp;L [[double overhead cam|DOHC]] ''[[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|Duratec 30]]'' [[V6]] as an option. Quality of this generation was of a lower standard than in previous generations, as the overall quality of the Ford line was falling at the time; the Taurus received a poor reliability rating from [[Consumer Reports]].<ref>Consumer Reports 1998 New Car Buyer's Guide</ref> Another notable quality issue is the fact that cars equipped with the manual air conditioning did not have any form of liquid drainage, meaning that mold could form in the air ducts and blow into the cabin, when the AC was turned on. This sparked a notorious battle between Ford and [[Jerry Schreiber]], an elderly man who claimed that the mold in the faulty AC system in his 1998 Taurus nearly killed him.<ref>[http://www.fordlemon.com  Ford Lemon], the website Schreiber launched about his battle against Ford.</ref> The battle continues to this day. 

Trim lines were now known as ''G'' at the bottom, with ''GL'' in the middle and ''LX'' as the most-luxurious.  The third generation also saw Ford USA's re-entry into RHD export markets. A specially luxurious trim level — the Taurus Ghia — was available in these markets. The ''[[#Third generation SHO|SHO]]'' continued with a new 3.4&nbsp;L [[V8]] engine. The Taurus was a [[flexible-fuel vehicle]] for 1997 and earned [[low-emission vehicle]] status in [[California]] but sales were faltering, nonetheless.

[[Image:1998-99 Ford Taurus sedan.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1999 Taurus SE sedan]]
In an effort to reverse the declining sales of the ''Taurus'', Ford tried to increase its appeal by making some cosmetic changes for the 1998 and 1999 model years.  These changes included redesigning the grille openings in the front, changing the design from two oval openings to a more SHO-like full width opening for the air dam (without the bar running through the center) and moving the Ford logo down into an enlarged opening between the lights, mounted onto a [[Jaguar (automobile)|Jaguar]]-esque 'motif bar'.  These years were also fitted with more attractive headlight lenses, featuring completely clear lenses and a multi-reflector surface in the rear of the housing, around the bulb; these were known as the 'disco ball' headlights.  The rear turn signal lenses were changed from amber to red, to match the rest of the lightbar assembly, presumably to present a more 'sleek' appearance. Ford also eliminated the two downmarket trim levels, ''G'' and ''GL'' and reinstated the upscale ''SE'' model from 1995, which featured a harder suspension and four-wheel disc brakes.<ref name="Consumerguide96">{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1996-to-1999-ford-taurus.htm |title=1996-1999 Ford Taurus Review |work=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>

Although all 1998 models had the option of the DOHC Duratec engine, it was only available on the ''SE'' for 1999. That same year, the front bucket seats, re-introduced with the ''SE'', became optional on the ''LX''. Ford claimed that the 1999 Duratec had less power than the 2000 Duratec in hopes to increase sales of the 2000 Taurus.<ref name = "Myths">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Other/Myths.html |title=TCCA encyclopedia: Myths |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2007-01-13 |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>

Part way into the 1999 model year, Ford made some minor cosmetic changes and cut features, mostly to cut costs. These changes were made due to the continuing decline of Taurus sales and Ford's focus on the truck and SUV market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G3/index.html |title=Taurus/Sable Spotter's Guide Generation 3 |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>

===Third generation SHO===
[[Image:SHO 2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|1997 SHO]]
For 1996, the SHO model was redesigned. Unlike its predecessors, this SHO was more refined and used less radical bodywork. It differed from the normal Taurus with different seats, wheels, bumpers, drivetrain, as well as a fin being put on the driver's side wiper blade, to keep it on the windshield at high speeds. Unlike the previous SHOs though, this model was designed for comfort instead of performance. <ref>{{cite book|title=1996 New cars, Ford Taurus SHO|publisher=[[Car and Driver]]|first=Barry|last=Winfield|edition=|id=|year=1995|month=October}}</ref>

A 235&nbsp;hp (175&nbsp;kW) [[Ford Yamaha V8 engine|3.4&nbsp;L DOHC V8]] was specified for the SHO model but the 5-speed manual transmission was deleted. The V8 in the SHO model (produced from 1996 to 1999) increased curb weight, and the lack of a manual transmission option meant the new SHO lacked the acceleration of the previous generation manual transmission cars, though its top speed of 144 mph (232 km/h) was higher and its cornering and braking were improved. These engines were assembled by Yamaha in Japan but more parts were made by Ford than in the earlier Yamaha-built V6.

Separation of the camshaft from its sprocket (components shared with at least one other Ford engine with significantly lower output) has been implicated in a growing number of catastrophic failures of this engine, at around the 50,000 mile (80,000 km) mark. The standard warranty on this model was 36,000 miles (58,000 km). This problem can be rectified by having the camshafts welded.<ref name="v8">{{cite web|url=http://www.v8sho.com/SHO/WhatWeKnow.htm|title=What We Know, What Ford Does Not Want You to Know, & Who Is To Blame|work=V8SHO.com|accessmonthday=January 26 |accessyear=2006}}</ref>. This SHO model sold in lower numbers than the previous SHO generations, with sales peaking at 9,000 units in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Other/SHOcount.html |title=SHO Numbers |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> As a result, Ford cut the SHO when redesigning the Taurus for its fourth generation.

[[Image:00-05 Ford Taurus wagon.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Taurus wagon]]The ''Taurus'' received another redesign in 2000, which minimized some of the oval design elements from the 1996 model, replacing them with more conventional styling.  The redesign also featured a taller roof over the rear-passenger space, to increase passenger headroom that had been sacrificed by the tapered 1996 design.  The taller and roomier trunk also served to make the vehicle more functional. The interior was completely changed for a much more conservative design.  Certain elements of the interior were retained from the 1996 model, such as the integrated control console, which combined the sound system and climate controls into one panel. The [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] was also softened to appeal to a broader, non-sporting audience. Electrically-adjustable pedals became an option on the 2000 Taurus. To reduce the price and increase profitability, many features such as four-wheel [[disc brake]]s were eliminated.<ref name="Consumerguide00">{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2000-to-2006-ford-taurus.htm |title=2000-2006 Ford Taurus Review |work=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> The SHO model was also dropped. 

The 2002 Taurus included extra equipment on every trim level, including a CD player and power driver's seat on the ''SE'', a power [[moonroof]] or leather interior on the ''SES'' and both of these luxury options on the ''SEL''. Side airbags and [[traction control]] were added as options on all models.  

[[Image:2004-2006 Ford Taurus Sedan.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Facelifted 4th-gen Taurus sedan]]
In 2003, Ford created a Centennial Version Taurus to celebrate Ford's 100th anniversary.  This special Taurus included many extras, such as lighter wood trim, special leather seats, headlights with black accents, special wheels, a special leather case for the owner's manual, a leather jacket that said "Ford:100 years", a similar watch, and a letter from [[William Clay Ford, Jr.]]  Production was limited to 3,000 units.<ref name = "Cent">{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Specials/Cent.html |title=Centennial Taurus |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2007-01-21 |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>

For 2004, the Taurus received minor cosmetic changes to the front and rear fascias, most noticeably the removal of a horizontal bar running through the Ford logo on the grille.  Inside were a new instrument cluster and steering wheel. 2005 to 2007 models remain unchanged from 2004.  In 2006 the Duratec engine was dropped from the lineup. <ref name = "Consumerguide00" />

<br clear=all>

==Initial discontinuation==
Taurus sales had slumped significantly in the years prior to its demise, losing significant market share to foreign sedans.<ref name="det" /> Production of the Taurus wagon was discontinued in January 2005; sedan retail sales halted after a short 2006 model year. The 2007 Taurus was sold exclusively to [[Fleet vehicles|fleets]] in the [[United States]], but was still offered to consumers in [[Canada]]. Production ended on [[October 27]], [[2006]], as Ford idled the Atlanta plant, as part of ''[[The Way Forward]]''. The last Ford Taurus rolled off the assembly line around 7:25am, destined for delivery to [[S. Truett Cathy]], owner of [[Chick-fil-A]].<ref name = "BlueOvalForums">[http://www.blueovalforums.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=7292&st=60 Atlanta Assembly's last days]</ref> Mr. Cathy's original restaurant was located across from the Ford Atlanta plant. There was no official event or function of any kind to mark the end of production.

Rather than investing in an older platform, Ford chose to concentrate on development of the larger 2005 [[Ford Five Hundred|Five Hundred]] and [[Ford Freestyle|Freestyle]] (a taller crossover sedan and wagon, based on a Volvo FWD/AWD platform) and the 2006 [[Ford Fusion (North America)|Fusion]] (a Mazda6-based sedan, similar in size to the original Taurus), both vehicles replaced the Taurus in the Ford lineup.

The discontinuation of the Taurus was controversial, mostly due to the fact that it was believed that the Taurus was just left to die by Ford, while others believe that the car could not keep pace in the growing sedan market, and that caused it to be discontinued.<ref name="DetNews">{{cite news|url=http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061023/AUTO01/610230304/1148|title=Storied Ford Taurus reaches end of line|work=[[Detroit News]]|date=[[2006-10-23]]}}</ref>  This is disputed though, because some believed that if Ford wanted to save the car, they could have easily done so.<ref>{{cite video

After Mulally took position as Ford's CEO, rumors were rampant that he was interested in reviving the Taurus.

The [[Ford Five Hundred]] sedan, as produced for the 2005-2007 model year, was scheduled for a significant styling facelift update and power upgrade for the 2008 model year.  That vehicle has been redesignated as the new Taurus in an effort to save it from sagging sales & consumer rejection.<ref>{{cite web |title=Five Hundred To Be Renamed Taurus| url=http://www.stangbangers.com/News_FordFiveHundred.htm|work=stangbangers.com|accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> Along with other execs at Ford, the company's new CEO [[Alan Mulally]] determined that Ford's strategy to redesignate new cars in the lineup  with new names beginning with the letter ''F'', as in [[Ford Focus (North America)|Ford Focus]], [[Ford Fusion]], and [[Ford Freestyle]], was not a good marketing move, as some of the renamed cars had highly recognizeable iconic names.  The new ''F'' names were not as well known to be associated with Ford in the US, and consumers were confused by the name changes.<ref name = "DETROIT" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17003763 |title=Five Hundred to be renamed "Taurus" |work=MSNBC.com |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-07}}</ref>  Mulally believed that the Taurus had an immediately strong brand equity, and that it would take years for consumers to have a similar recognition of the Five Hundred.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8N48NI80.htm |author=Krisher, Tom |title=Officals say Ford to revive Taurus name |work=BusinessWeek.com |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-07}}</ref>

Changes to the new Taurus from the existing Five Hundred include a newly styled front end, with the signature three-bar chrome grille from the Fusion, and the addition of the 263 hp 3.5&nbsp;L [[Ford Cyclone engine|Cyclone engine]] from the [[Ford Edge]], replacing the 203 hp 3.0&nbsp;L V6.

===Ford Taurus X===
{{main|Ford Taurus X}}
Along with the facelifted Five Hundred, Ford also created a facelifted Freestyle model, also in an attempt to improve  sagging sales. This model has been redesignated as the Taurus X. <ref name="taurusx">{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/products/press_article_display.cfm?article_id=25373&vehicle_id=1540 |title=Ford strengthens crossover leadership with introduction of new 2008 Taurus X |work=Media.Ford.com |date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-07}}</ref>  The Taurus X will also drop the CVT transmission and 3.0&nbsp;L V6 used in the Freestyle in favor of the 3.5&nbsp;L engine and six-speed [[GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission|6F]] automatic. Although this model is considered to be a part of the Taurus line up, it only shares the platform with the Taurus, and does not share any cosmetic parts with the Taurus sedan.

==Export models==
[[Image:Taurus Ghia1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A 1997 Australian-market Taurus Ghia]]
The third generation model was exported outside [[North America]] to [[Japan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], with [[right hand drive]].  However, this action proved unsuccessful. <ref name = "AU" />  In these markets, it wore [[Mercury Sable]] [[headlight]]s, a unique front bumper cover with inset parking and turn signal lamps, and a Taurus-style rear, due to those countries' regulations regarding [[automotive lighting]].<ref name = "TCCAA">[http://www.tauruscarclub.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=8082&hl= Ford Taurus Ghia]</ref> Some minor changes were made to the interior besides the change to right hand drive, they also featured a handbrake, which was never available on North American Tauruses, and the radio was reversed.<ref name = "TCCAA" /> Australians and New Zealanders tended to stay away from the cars, due to their high price; a well equipped, larger-engined [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Ford Fairmont]] cost around the same amount.<ref name = "AU" >{{cite web |url=http://glassguide.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/RT/A3099F03533DD3B2CA256D6E001DE35F_Our+Opinion?OpenDocument |title=Ford Taurus Ghia: our opinion |work=Glassguide.au |publisher=Glass Guide |date=|accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref>  While the Japanese market was offered the station wagon, Australian buyers could only opt for a high-spec sedan, with the ''Taurus Ghia'' badge. The third generation Taurus was also exported to [[Israel]] and [[South Korea]].  For the [[Hong Kong]] market, only the sedan variant was offered.  It was marketed as an upscale Ford sedan. However, as in other export markets, the Taurus was a failure in Hong Kong.  In [[Brazil]], the second-generation Taurus was introduced in 1994, available only as a sedan, with the 3.0L Vulcan engine and a 4-speed automatic transmission. It was intended to be an upscale alternative to the Belgian-built [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]]. The third-generation Taurus was available from 1997 to 1998, only in the LX trim level, using the Duratec engine. It enjoyed only minimal sales, mainly due to its controversial design. However, the Taurus is popular in the used car market in Brazil, due to its low price and high equipment level.

Other Latin American versions were 3.0 V6 GLX and 3.8 V6 GT.

==Awards==
[[Image:CaroftheyearTaurus.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ford Taurus on the cover of a 1986 issue of [[Motor Trend]], where it won "Car of the Year". {{ifdc|Image:CaroftheyearTaurus.jpg|log=2007 July 31}}]]
The Taurus won many awards in its production run, with the original Taurus winning many awards. For 1986, the Taurus was named Motor Trend's [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year]]. The Motor Trend journalists noted that the Taurus performed much better than the other cars that were up for the award, going as far as saying that the Taurus "Ran away from the competition" <ref>{{cite book|title=Car of the Year 1986, it is going to be a bull market for the Ford Taurus.|publisher=[[Motor Trend]]|first=John|last=Hanson|edition=|id=|year=1986|month=February}}</ref> The 1986 Taurus also made it onto [[Car and Driver]]'s ten best list, and the Taurus would stay there every year of its first generation. <ref name = "Taub" /> Team Taurus also won many awards, and would later prove to be an inspirational business development model. <ref name = "Taub" /> In fact, current Ford CEO [[Alan Mulally]] claims that Team Taurus was what inspired the development of the [[Boeing 777]]. <ref name = "Alan">{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17033668/ |title=CEO insisted in bringing "Taurus" back |work=[[MSNBC]] |date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref>

The 1992 Taurus also made it onto Car and Driver's Ten Best list for that year, although that was the last year the the Taurus would appear on that list. In its second generation, the Taurus was the best selling car in America every year it was produced. 

The Taurus constantly performed well in crash tests, and constantly got high ratings. The 1996 Taurus got a five star crash safety rating, as well as the 2000 Taurus. The 2008 Taurus also got a 5 star safety rating, and was named a Top safety pick by the [[IIHS]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=435 |title=Ford Taurus crash safety ratings |work=[[IIHS]] |date= |accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref>

==NASCAR==
As Ford retired the [[Ford MN12 platform|MN12]]-based [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] after the 1997 season, which had been Ford's NASCAR platform, they needed to pick another platform. The idea was risky, as the Thunderbirds had won eighteen races in 1997, the model's second-most wins after the twenty-one wins in 1994. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/headlines/cup/11/22/ford.timeline/ |title=Ford racing timeline |work=Nascar.com |date=22 September 2006 |accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref>

[[General Motors]] had already used 2-door versions of their [[front-wheel drive]] mid-sizes: the [[Chevrolet Lumina|Chevy Lumina]] and [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]], [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] and [[Buick Regal]] in NASCAR competition, even though the actual cars were V6-powered. Since Ford no longer manufactured any 2-door mid-size cars, the 4-door Taurus was chosen, although NASCAR racecars do not have any doors. The first cars were modeled after the third generation cars, but later cars adopted the standard body shape imposed on all NASCAR bodies. 

The [[Nascar]] edition of the Taurus was developed by the [[Penske Racing|Penske Racing South]] group based in [[Mooresville, North Carolina]] after the decision was made to drop the Thunderbird in March 1997.  The first one was owned by Don Miller, the co-owner and manager of Penske Racing South.

The stock car Taurus made its debut to over 300 people, including news media, team representatives, and Ford drivers, on [[July 30]], [[1997]] at the [[Indiana Convention Center]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], right before the Brickyard 400 at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]].<ref name="CNN">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9708/04/nascar.taurus/ |title=Ford takes Taurus to the track |work=CNN.com |date=4 August 1997 |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>

The Taurus was tested at the [[Daytona International Speedway]] in [[Daytona, Florida]], driven by [[Rusty Wallace]] and [[Bill Elliott]]. It was then taken to the [[Talladega Superspeedway]] in [[Alabama]] for a three day test.

The Taurus won fifteen races in the introductory season, nine more than the Thunderbird won in its first five seasons. The Taurus was at the top of the standings in 1999, and the racers wondered if the redesigned models for 2000 would continue the good fortune.<ref name="NASCAR">{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/motorsports/1268761.html?page=1 |title=Under The Skin of a NASCAR Ford Taurus |work=Popular Mechanics |date=March 2000}}</ref>

The Taurus won over 100 races during its NASCAR career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/features/news/detail/index.asp?id=1474 |title=Ford Unveils New Face for the Chase |date=14 July 2005 |accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> With the retirement of the Taurus, new Ford NASCAR bodies are now based on the [[Ford Fusion (North America)|Fusion]], a car sized similarly to the original Taurus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nascar.com/2005/news/headlines/official/07/14/ford_fusion/index.html |title=Ford unveils Fusion race car for 2006 season |work=NASCAR.com |date=14 July 2005 |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>
