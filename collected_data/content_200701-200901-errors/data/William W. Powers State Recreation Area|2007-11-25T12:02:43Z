'''William W. Powers State Recreation Area''' is an [[List of Illinois state parks|Illinois state park]] administered by the [[Illinois Department of Natural Resources]] on {{convert|580|acre|sqkm|2|}} in the [[Hegewisch, Chicago|Hegewisch]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]].<ref name=DNR>{{cite web|url=http://dnr.state.il.us/Lands/Landmgt/PARKS/R2/Wmpow.htm|accessdate=2007-07-11|date=2007|publiserh=Department of Natural Resources|title=William W. Powers - State Recreation Area}}</ref>  The area includes {{convert|419|acre|sqkm|2|}} of water in [[Wolf Lake (Indiana/Illinois)|Wolf Lake]] that provides about {{mi to km|6|precision=1}} of [[shoreline]] to [[fishermen]].<ref name=DNR/>  The park hosts about half a million visitors annually.<ref name=Quincy>{{cite web|url=http://www.quincynet.com/illinoisparks/WilliamPowers.htm|title=William W. Powers State Recreation Area|publisher=QuincyNet.com|accessdate=2007-07-11|date=2004}}</ref>  The park hosts numerous [[species]], which are the concern of [[ecologist]].  As a result, some of these species have been placed on special watch lists, and the park has been the subject of extended study as well as the focal point of extensive volunteerism.

==History==
Wolf Lake in Illinois has a storied history that somehow has lost track of the origins of the name that goes back over 150 years.  Part of this history includes visits by [[Abraham Lincoln]] in which [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] nearly drowned.<ref name=IPO>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/ipo/2002/oi020310.html|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2002-03-11|title=A Lone Wolf No More|publisher=Northern Illinois University Libraries|work=Illinois Periodicals Online}}</ref> In 1947, the state acquired a {{convert|160|acre|sqkm|2|}} parcel known as the Wolf Lake State Recreation Area. Later acquisitions were added to the property and have increased the area which was known as Wolf Lake Conservation Area. In 1965, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] named the area after [[William W. Powers]].<ref name=DNR/>  Powers had been a Chicago [[alderman]] on the [[Chicago City Council]] and [[Illinois General Assembly]] legislator in the 1920s, and used the site for picnics to feed the needy during the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=IPO/>

The park also has a military history.  There is a defunct [[Nike Ajax missile]] honoring the missile site that occupied the area during the [[Cold War]] years.  Fourth of July, Veterans Day and Memorial Day attracts veterans who place flags at markers near a former rededication ceremony cite that featured the [[Moving Vietnam Wall]].<ref name=IPO/>

==Wildlife==
Wolf Lake contains [[largemouth bass]], [[northern pike]], [[bluegill]], [[redear sunfish]], [[crappie]], [[bullhead]], [[carp]], [[walleye]], hybrid [[muskie]], and [[yellow perch]].<ref name=DNR/>  There is also an occasional [[salmon]] and [[rainbow trout]] caught in the lake.<ref name=IPO/>  [[Birdwatcher]]s enjoy the [[monk parakeet]], which is a [[South American]] [[parrot]], that nests in the park.<ref name=Quincy/>  Hunters enjoy the seasonal [[waterfowl]].<ref name=DNR/>  The park contains many [[willow]] and [[cottonwood]] trees.<ref name=DNR/> The park also attracts city dwelling [[mammal]]s such as [[squirrel]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[muskrat]]s, [[opossum]]s, and the occasional [[coyote]] and [[white-tailed deer]].<ref name=IPO/> The birds it hosts include [[cardinal]]s, [[blue jay]]s, [[finch]]es, [[oriole]]s, [[woodpecker]]s, [[teal]], [[mallard]]s, resident and migratory [[Canada geese]], [[mute swan]]s and an occasional [[bald eagle]].<ref name=IPO/> The South American monk parakeets arrived at the site in 1999 and have since established two nests with seven or eight birds each. They are presumed to have migrated from the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]].<ref name=IPO/>

On [[August 23]] [[2002]], Wolf Lake was one of three neighboring regions that hosted the Calumet [[BioBlitz]].  This bioblitz convened over 150 expert [[scientist]]s to identify and record as many living organisms as possible within 24 hours.  The purpose was to demonstrate the resilience of the extraordinary range of organisms in nature's battle against the South Side of Chicago's collage of [[factory|factories]], [[warehouse]]s, [[forest preserve]]s, [[House|residences]], and [[highway]]s as well as its battle of survival against killer pest species.  Unofficially, the BioBlitz counted 1,815 [[species]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagowildernessmag.org/issues/fall2002/bioblitz.html|accessdate=2007-07-13|date=2002|author=Parker, Don|title=Calumet BioBlitz|publisher=Chicago Wilderness Magazine, Inc.}}</ref>  The BioBlitz included teams of scientists from [[Eastern Illinois University]], [[Field Museum]], [[Forest Preserve District of Cook County]], [[Illinois Natural History Survey]], [[Indiana Department of Natural Resources]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois - Champaign]], [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], and [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish & Wildlife]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/bioblitz/bioblitzteam.html|accessdate=2007-07-13|date=2007|publisher=The Field Museum|title=The BioBlitz Team}}</ref>

[[Lake sturgeon]], [[Endangered species|endangered]] in both Indiana and Illinois, as well as [[banded killifish]], [[Threatened species|threatened]] in Illinois, are both part of the Wolf Lake ecology.<ref name=CWM/> The lake supports the nesting habitat for four species of endangered birds: [[little blue heron]], [[yellow-crowned night heron]], [[black-crowned night heron]], and [[yellow-headed blackbird]].<ref name=CWM/>

==Use==
The park offers stoves and has shelters available by reservation for [[picnic]]king.  Two of the shelters have 50 person capacities and two have 100 capacities.  Camping is not allowed, however.<ref name=IPO/>  [[Fishing]] and [[hunting]] is permitted in accordance with regulations.  [[Ice fishing]] is permitted in the winter and 10 [[horsepower]] [[motorboat]]s are permitted during the summer.<ref name=DNR/>  The lake has several [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] that temper the wave height.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.ripco.net/~jwn/wolf.html|accessdate=2007-07-15|title=Wolf Lake}}</ref>  There are 25 [[hunting blind]] to hunt waterfowl.  These sites are awarded in yearly lotteries held in late July. During the season, daily drawings are held to allocate blinds of absentee blind holders.<ref name=IPO/>

The use of the park is protected by several types of volunteers.  For example, at the 14th Annual [[Earth Day]] Wolf Lake Cleanup on [[April 21]] [[2001]], more than 350 volunteers, including [[Hammond, IN]] Mayor [[Duane Dedelow, Jr.]], helped clean up and remove an estimated {{Weight|lbs=36000}} of waste.<ref name=CWM/> A week later, Friends of Wolf Lake and associates collected more than 3,000 discarded tires from the lake and its shoreline.<ref name=CWM/> Semi-annual cleanups are organized by the Southeast Sportsmen's Club and the Wolf Lake Rod and Gun Club who work with the scouts, community organizations and the Hegewisch [[Chamber of Commerce]].<ref name=IPO/> 

The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] and the Illinois Water Survey are also studying ways to halt degradation of the lake and the [[USDA]] Forest Service is helping with a study of public interests in recreation at Wolf Lake.<ref name=CWM/>  The Wolf Lake water level determines the drainage to [[Lake Michigan]] because the connecting Calumet River flows southward during elevated levels and northward during lowered levels.<ref name=DNRdraft>{{cite web|url=http://dnr.state.il.us/owr/cmp/pdfs/Chapter%202.pdf|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2007-05-24|title=Chapter 2: Physical Characteristics of the Illinois Coast|publisher=Illinois Department of Natural Resources}}</ref>  Unlike the Lake Michigan shoreline which has been reshaped by sand and clay, Wolf Lake has been filled in large part with [[slag]] from [[steel mill]]s.<ref name=DNRdraft/>

The [[Illinois Department of Natural Resources]] and the City of [[Hammond, IN]] initiated the Reconnaissance Report in December 1998.  It was approved in September 2000.  An environmental assessment was held in 2002.  The Project Cooperation Agreement commenced in 2005.<ref name=USACE>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrc.usace.army.mil/projects/current/wolf_lake/main.htm|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2006-06-08|title=Wolf Lake|publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers}}</ref> The Wolf Lake ecosystem degradation problem is multifaceted.  It includes exotic plant species proliferation, low diversity of plant and fish species, water depth inadequacy, poor aquatic habitat, contaminant impact, and shoreline erosion. Proposed project features include new aquatic and wetland habitat plantings; shoreline restoration; creating deep holes to locally diversify the lake bottom; herbicidal and biological controls; channels clearing, and dikes and causeways construction to restore natural water levels.<ref name=USACE/>

==Geography==
Wolf Lake extends across the Illinois and Indiana State line between 120th and 134th streets.<ref name=DNR/>  It is an {{convert|804|acre|sqkm|2|}} lake that has {{convert|419|acre|sqkm|1}} within the city of Chicago and the remainder in the city of Hammond.<ref name=CWM>{{cite web|url=http://chicagowildernessmag.org/issues/summer2001/news/newvision.html|title=New Vision for Wolf Lake Shared by Illinois and Indiana Conservationists|accessdate=2007-07-15|date=Summer 2001|publisher=Chicago Wilderness Magazine, Inc.|author=Brown, Alison Carney}}</ref>  Its maximum depth is {{ft to m|20}}.<ref name=DNR/> Wetlands adjacent to the lake include the {{convert|250|acre|sqkm|2|}} Eggers Woods Forest Preserve, {{convert|175|acre|sqkm|2|}} Powderhorn Lake Prairie, and {{convert|40|acre|sqkm|2|}} Hyde Lake Wetland.<ref name=CWM/>  William W. Powers State Recreation Area is on Chicago's far southeast side, off highways [[Bishop Ford Freeway|94]], [[Chicago Skyway|90]], and [[U.S. Route 41 in Illinois|41]]. The main park entrance is at 12949 South Avenue O.<ref name=DNR/>

At one time, the Wolf lake was connected to Lake Michigan by a creek running through Hammond on the Indiana side, but the creek has long since been blocked by development. On the Illinois side, Wolf Lake empties into Indian Creek, which feeds into the [[Calumet River]].  The Illinois and Indiana are separated by State Line Road, which is a road elsewhere along the border, but it is only represented by a rock-and-gravel dike that passes through the lake. State Line Road ends in foot bridges where water enters from the Indiana side.<ref name=IPO/>
