'''James Bond 007''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[UK|British]] [[espionage|agent]]<ref>[http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/literary/casino_royale.php3 In Fleming's first novel, ''Casino Royale'', he refers to Bond as an agent.]</ref> created in [[1952]] by writer [[Ian Fleming]], featured in twelve [[novel]]s, two [[Short story|anthologies]] and a film series<ref>[http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/2006/understanding007.html Understanding 007], retrieved June 6th 2007.</ref>. After Fleming's death in 1964, subsequent James Bond novels were written by [[Kingsley Amis]] (as [[Robert Markham]]), [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]], [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], [[Raymond Benson]] and [[Charlie Higson]]. Moreover, [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] novelised two screenplays, while other writers have authored unofficial versions of the secret agent character. For the last three Bond movies, the screenplay has been written by Neil Purvis and Robert Waide.

Initially famed through the best-selling novels, James Bond is best known from the [[EON Productions]] [[film series]], twenty-one of which have been made as of 2007. The [[Bond 22|22nd EON-produced Bond adventure]] is currently in production. In addition there have been two independent feature productions (a 1967 [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|spoof]] and 1983's [[Never Say Never Again]]) and one Fleming-licenced [[United States|American]] television [[Casino Royale (Climax! episode)|adaptation]] of the first novel, aired in 1954. The EON Productions films are generally described as the "official" films originating with the purchase of the James Bond film rights by eventual producer [[Harry Saltzman]] in the late 1950s when Bond was a popular novel series; this term is used throughout this article.<ref>{{cite book | last = Winder | first = Simon | year = 2006 | title = The Man Who Saved Britain | publisher = Picador | id = ISBN 0-330-43954-5 }}</ref>

==Ian Fleming's creation and inspiration==
{{main|James Bond (character)|Inspirations for James Bond}}

<!--[[Image:007.svg|thumb|300px|The James Bond 007 gun logo]]  commenting out image with no fair use rationale-->

Commander James Bond, [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve|RNVR]] is an agent of the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS) (more commonly, [[MI6]]). He was created in January 1952 by British journalist [[Ian Fleming]] while on holiday at his [[Jamaica]]n estate, Goldeneye. The hero, James Bond, was named after an [[United States|American]] [[James Bond (ornithologist)|ornithologist]], a [[Caribbean]] bird expert and author of the definitive field guide book ''[[Birds of the West Indies]].'' Fleming, a keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]], had a copy of Bond's [[field guide]] at Goldeneye. Of the name, Fleming once said in a [[Reader's Digest]] interview, "I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure &mdash; an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department."<ref>{{cite book | last = Chancellor | first = Henry | year = 2005 | title = James Bond: The Man and His World | publisher = John Murray | id = ISBN 0-7195-6815-3}}</ref>

Nevertheless, news sources speculated about real [[espionage|spies]] or other [[covert operations|covert agents]] after whom James Bond might have been named. Although they are similar to Bond, Fleming confirmed none as the source figure, nor did [[Ian Fleming Publications]] nor any of Fleming's biographers, such as [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]] or Andrew Lycett.

James Bond's parents are Andrew Bond, a [[Scottish people|Scotsman]], and Monique Delacroix, from Canton de [[Vaud]], Switzerland. Their nationalities were established in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service.'' Fleming emphasized Bond's Scottish heritage in admiration of Sean Connery's cinematic portrayal, whereas Bond's mother is named after a Swiss fiancée of Fleming's. A planned, but unwritten, novel would have portrayed Bond's mother as a Scot. Ian Fleming was a member of a prominent Scottish banking family.<ref>http://salon.com/books/feature/2006/11/25/fleming/</ref> In his fictional biography of secret agent 007, John Pearson gave Bond's birth date as 11 November ([[Armistice Day]]) 1920; however, there is no evidence of it in Fleming's novels. Some have suggested that Fleming was inspired by the playboy and real secret agent [[Tricycle (spy)|Dušan Popov]], a Serb [[double agent]] for the British and the Germans. In the novel ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]],'' Bond's family motto is found to be "Orbis non sufficit" ("The world is not enough"). The novel also states that the family that used this motto may not necessarily be the same Bond family James Bond came from.<ref>[http://www.themanspage.org/bond.shtml Biography of the Literary James Bond]</ref>

After completing the manuscript for ''Casino Royale,'' Fleming allowed his friend - and later his editor - the poet [[William Plomer]] to read it. Plomer liked it and submitted it to [[Jonathan Cape]], who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother [[Peter Fleming|Peter]], an established [[Travel literature|travel writer]].<ref>[http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/ian_fleming_biography.php3 Ian Fleming Biography Discussing Early Writings]</ref>

[[Image:HoagyCarmichael.jpg|thumb|Photo of the young Hoagy Carmichael]]
Most researchers agree that James Bond is a romanticized version of Ian Fleming, himself a jet-setting [[womanizer|womanizer]]. Both Fleming and Bond attended the same schools, preferred the same foods ([[scrambled eggs]], [[coffee]]), maintained the same habits (drinking, smoking, wearing short-sleeve shirts), shared the same notions of the perfect woman in looks and style, and had similar naval career paths (both rising to the rank of naval [[Commander]]). They also shared similar height, hairstyle, and [[Eye color|eye colour]]. Some suggest that Bond's suave and sophisticated persona is based on that of a young [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. In ''Casino Royale,'' the [[anti-heroine]] [[Vesper Lynd]] remarks, "[Bond] reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless." Likewise, in ''[[Moonraker]],'' [[Special Branch]] Officer [[Gala Brand]] thinks that Bond is "certainly good-looking.... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold."<ref>{{cite book | last = Amis | first = Kingsley | year = 1965 | title = The James Bond Dossier | publisher = Jonathan Cape}}</ref>

Fleming did admit to being partly inspired by his service in the [[Naval Intelligence Division (UK)|Naval Intelligence Division]] of the [[Admiralty]], most notably an incident depicted in ''Casino Royale,'' when Fleming and [[Naval Intelligence Division|Naval Intelligence Director]] [[John Henry Godfrey|Admiral Godfrey]] went on a mission to [[Lisbon]] en route to the United States during [[World War II]]. At the [[Estoril Casino]], which harboured spies of warring regimes due to [[Portugal]]'s neutrality, Fleming was 'cleaned out' by a "chief [[Germany|German]] agent" in a game of [[Baccarat#Baccarat Chemin de Fer|Chemin de Fer]]. Admiral Godfrey's account differs in that Fleming played Portuguese businessmen, whom Ian fantasized as German agents he defeated at cards. Moreover, references to "Red Indians" in Casino Royale (four times; twice in the final page) are to his own [[30th Assault Unit|30 Assault Unit]].

{{main|James Bond (novels)}}
In February 1952, Ian Fleming began writing his first James Bond novel. At the time, Fleming was the foreign manager for Kemsley Newspapers, owners of ''[[The Daily Express]]'' in London. Upon accepting the job, Fleming asked for two months yearly vacation in his contract; time spent writing in Jamaica. Between 1953 and his death in 1964, Fleming published twelve novels and one short-story collection (a second collection was published posthumously). Later, continuation novels were written by [[Kingsley Amis]] (as [[Robert Markham]]), [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], and [[Raymond Benson]], who was the first American author of James Bond, last published in 2002. The [[Young Bond]] series of novels was begun in 2005, by [[Charlie Higson]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.commanderbond.net/?action=Story&SID=2677 | title = Charlie Higson interview with CommanderBond.net | work = The Charlie Higson CBn Interview | accessdate = February 23 | accessyear = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Benson | first = Raymond | year = 1984 | title = The James Bond Bedside Companion | publisher = Dodd, Mead | id = ISBN 1-4011-0284-0 }}</ref>

==Adaptations==

===Films===
{{main|James Bond (films)}}
====Overview====
From 1962 through 2006, six actors have portrayed James Bond in "official" films:
<!---Please do not add Barry Nelson or David Niven to this list as they were not in official Bond films-->
* [[Sean Connery]] (1962–1967; 1971)<!---Never Say Never was not an official Bond film; please do NOT add 1983 (it's noted in the paragraph following). The 2005 "From Russia with Love" video game is not considered a movie, either.-->
* [[George Lazenby]] (1969)
* [[Roger Moore]] (1973&ndash;1985)
* [[Timothy Dalton]] (1987&ndash;1989)
* [[Pierce Brosnan]] (1995&ndash;2002)
* [[Daniel Craig]] (2006&ndash;present)

While according to ''James Bond: The Secret World of 007'' Bond is 6' 1", only two of the actors who have played him are that height. The others range from 5' 11" (Daniel Craig) to 6' 2 1/2" (George Lazenby).

In the late 1950s, [[EON Productions|Eon Productions]] guaranteed the [[film]] adaptation rights for every 007 novel except for ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' (those rights were recovered in 1999<ref>[http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/scoop_article.asp?ai=12092&si=128 Bond, from the beginning?]</ref>) So in 1962, the first adaptation was made in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', which starred [[Sean Connery]] as 007. Connery starred in 5 more films, and after his initial portrayal, he was followed by [[George Lazenby]] (for 1 film), [[Roger Moore]] (for 7 films), [[Timothy Dalton]] (for 2 films), [[Pierce Brosnan]] (for 4 films) and [[Daniel Craig]] (currently 1 film). As of 2007, there have been 21 films. The twenty-first official film, ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', with [[Daniel Craig]] as James Bond, premiered on <!---- DO NOT CHANGE THIS DATE.

Notably, it is the first Bond film to be released in China.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6312375.stm "Bond's late arrival in China"] - BBC News. Retrieved [[23 April]] [[2007]].</ref> [[Bond 22|The sequel to ''Casino Royale'']] is currently in production. ''[[Monster's Ball]]'' and ''[[Finding Neverland]]'' director [[Marc Forster]] is set to start filming in January 2008. The film is scheduled for a November 2008 release.

The twenty-one Bond films have grossed over $4 billion worldwide, making it the second highest grossing film series ever (behind ''[[Star Wars]]''). James Bond also has the third highest amount of sequels (behind ''[[Wong Fei Hung]]'' and ''[[Godzilla]]'').

===Non-EON Films, Radio and Television Programmes===
In 1954, [[CBS]] paid Ian Fleming for the rights to adapt ''Casino Royale'' into a one hour [[television]] adventure as part of their ''[[Climax! (television)|Climax!]]'' series. However, Barry Nelson played a CIA agent named Jimmy Bond, Clarence Lieter was a British agent played by Michael Pate and Peter Lorre was Le Chiffre. ''Casino Royale'' was later made into a [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|1967 film spoof]]. A legal issue led [[Kevin McClory]] to remake ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', returning [[Sean Connery]] as 007 in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''. MGM bought the name "James Bond" so future non-Eon productions are very unlikely.

==James Bond's influence on movies and television==
{{main|James Bond parodies}}

[[Image:Stoke Me a Clipper (Red Dwarf).jpg|thumb|left|300px|James Bond has been parodied in numerous TV shows, including [[Red Dwarf]], shown above]]
James Bond has long been a household name and remains a huge influence within the spy genre. The ''[[Austin Powers]]'' series by writer and actor [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] and other parodies such as ''[[Johnny English]]'' (2003), ''[[OK Connery]]'', the "[[Our Man Flint|Flint]]" series starring [[James Coburn]] as Derek Flint, the "[[Matt Helm]]" movies starring [[Dean Martin]], and ''Casino Royale'' (1967) are testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture.<ref>{{cite book | last = Chapman | first = James | year = 1999 | title = Licence To Thrill: A Cultural History Of The James Bond Films | publisher = [[I.B. Tauris]] | id = ISBN 1-86064-387-6 }}</ref>

1960s TV imitations of James Bond such as ''[[I Spy]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', and ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' went on to become popular successes in their own right, the latter having enjoyed contributions by Fleming towards its creation: the show's lead character, "[[Napoleon Solo]]," was named after a character in Fleming's novel ''Goldfinger''; Fleming also suggested the character name April Dancer, which was later used in the spin-off series ''[[The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.]]''.<ref>[http://members.aol.com/Wmkoenig/uncle007.htm James Bond and Man From U.N.C.L.E ties ]</ref> A reunion [[television movie]], ''[[The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' (1983), is notable for featuring a cameo by George Lazenby as James Bond in tribute to Fleming (for legal reasons, the character was credited as "JB").

The [[Nickelodeon (TV Channel)|Nickelodeon]] animated series ''[[Doug]]'' had a secret agent character named Smash Adams, who was clearly inspired by Bond. The character's theme music even resembled Monty Norman's classic theme for the character. Nickelodeon's sketch comedy series ''[[All That]]'' once did a James Bond parody called Jimmy Bond.

In ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', some time after the departure of the character ''[[Cathy Gale]]'' (played by actress [[Honor Blackman]]), the character of ''[[John Steed]]'' (played by [[Patrick Macnee]]) receives a Christmas card from her. He comments, "It's from Mrs Gale! I wonder what she's doing in Fort Knox?" &ndash; the intended destination for Honor Blackman's ''[[Pussy Galore (James Bond)|Pussy Galore]]'' in ''Goldfinger''. In further coincidence, this comment is made to ''[[Emma Peel]]'' &ndash; played by [[Diana Rigg]] who would later appear as ''[[Tracy Bond]]'' in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service''. Macnee himself, a friend of Roger Moore, would later appear as ''Sir Godfrey Tibbett'' in ''A View to a Kill''. Joanna Lumley (Purdey in the late Avengers series) can also be seen in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' in a little role with only one or two words.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054518/trivia James Bond Alumni on The Avengers]</ref>

Similarly, four episodes of the TV series ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' ([[For British Eyes Only]], [[Forget-Me-Now]], [[Notapusy]] and [[Mr. F]]) referenced the Bond films. The spoofing of the Bond films is evident in the episode titles, vocal and instrumental music cues, and the gun barrel shot at the end of the episode accompanied by the subtitle "Michael Bluth will return in..." Also, on the British TV show [[Red Dwarf]], James Bond was parodied in the form of Ace Rimmer, the alternate universe equivelant of one of the main characters.

[[George Lucas]] has said on various occasions that Sean Connery's portrayal of Bond was one of the primary inspirations for the [[Indiana Jones]] character, a reason Connery was chosen for the role of Indiana's father in the third film of that series.<ref>[http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/08/28/indiana_jones_was_supposed_to_be_like_ja Bond Inspiration For Indiana Jones]</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Fleurier | first = Nicolas | year = 2006 | title = James Bond & Indiana Jones. Action figures | publisher = Histoire & Collections | id = ISBN 2-35250-005-2 }}</ref>

An [[Amiga]] computer game, ''[[James Pond]]'' is also clearly a homage to Bond.<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/james-pond-series/ James Pond Info.]</ref>

==Music==
{{Main|James Bond music}}

The "[[James Bond Theme]]" was written by [[Monty Norman]] and was first orchestrated by the [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] Orchestra for 1962's ''Dr. No'', although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years. However, in 2001, Norman won £30,000 in libel damages from the British paper ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1229406.stm | title = Monty Norman sues for libel | work = Bond theme writer wins damages | accessdate = March 9 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Barry did go on to compose the [[Film score|scores]] for eleven Bond films in addition to his uncredited contribution to ''Dr. No'', and is credited with the creation of "[[The 007 Theme|007]]," used as an alternate Bond theme in several films, as well as the popular orchestrated theme "On Her Majesty's Secret Service." Both The "James Bond Theme" and "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" have been [[remix]]ed a number of times by popular artists, including [[Art of Noise]], [[Moby]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], and the [[Propellerheads]]. The British/Australian [[string quartet]] also named [[Bond (band)|bond]] (purposely in lower case) recorded their own version of the theme, entitled "Bond on Bond."<ref>[http://www.bondmusic.net/home.html "Bond on Bond", the Redux of The Bond Theme]</ref>

Barry's legacy was followed by [[David Arnold]], in addition to other well-known composers and [[record producer]]s such as [[George Martin]], [[Bill Conti]], [[Michael Kamen]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and [[Éric Serra]]. Arnold is the series' current composer of choice, and recently completed the score for his fourth consecutive Bond film, ''Casino Royale''.<ref>[http://www.davidarnold.com/ David Arnold Homepage]</ref>

The Bond films are known for their theme songs heard during the title credits sung by well-known popular singers (which have included [[Tina Turner]], [[Wings (band)|Paul McCartney and Wings]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], among many others). [[Shirley Bassey]] performed three themes in total. ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' is the only Bond film with a solely instrumental theme, though [[Louis Armstrong]]'s ballad "[[We Have All the Time in the World]]," which serves as Bond and his wife Tracy's [[love song]] and whose title is Bond's last line in the film, is considered the unofficial theme. Perhaps one of the best known compositions is the title song to ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', which is also known as Nobody Does It Better. Written by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] with lyrics by [[Carole Bayer Sager]] and sung by [[Carly Simon]] it features both lyric and orchestral arrangements in the credit sequences of the film.

The only singer, to date, to appear within the titles is [[Sheena Easton]], who sang the theme for ''For Your Eyes Only''. The only singer of a title song to appear within the film itself as a character, to date, is [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who appeared (uncredited) as a fencing instructor, Verity, as well as contributing the theme for ''Die Another Day''. [[Chris Cornell]] performs "[[You Know My Name]]" in ''Casino Royale''. He is the first male [[Singer|lead vocalist]] to perform a 007 song since [[a-ha]] in 1987 for "The Living Daylights." This is also the first Bond theme song since 1983's Octopussy to use a different title than the film. Although many of the theme songs were successful hits, the only theme song to hit #1 in the U.S. was Duran Duran's "A View to a Kill" which hit the top of the Billboard HOT 100 chart in 1985.<ref>[http://www.cylist.com/List/400300146/ 'A View to a Kill' on 1985 Billboard Hot 100]</ref>

In [[1998]], Barry's music from ''You Only Live Twice'' was adapted into the hit song ''[[Millennium (song)|Millennium]]'' by producer and composer [[Guy Chambers]] for British recording artist [[Robbie Williams]]. The music video features Williams parodying James Bond, and references other Bond films such as ''Thunderball'' and ''From Russia With Love''. It should also be noted that the video was filmed at Pinewood Studios, where most of the Bond films have been made.

In [[2004]] the [[Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps]] won the [[Drum Corps International]] World Championship with 007, the music of James Bond as composed by David Arnold. The Cavaliers performed selections from GoldenEye, "Hovercraft Theme" and "Welcome to Cuba" from Die Another Day, and "Tomorrow Never Dies".

The James Bond theme songs have become so popular that singers, such as the British singer [[Zeeteah Massiah]] or the German singer [[Alexis (singer)|Alexis]] can be booked with special "James Bond Shows," which consists of a 45-minute-show of various James Bond theme songs.

==Video games==
{{main|James Bond (games)}}
[[Image:Everything or Nothing.jpg|thumb|''[[Everything or Nothing]]'' featured Pierce Brosnan as James Bond]]

In 1983 the first Bond video game, developed and published by [[Parker Brothers]], was released for the [[Atari 2600]], the [[Atari 5200]], the [[Atari 800]], the [[Commodore 64]], and the [[Colecovision]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/3774/HTML/Games/JB_007.html|title=James Bond Games: James Bond 007|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> Since then, there have been numerous video games either based on either the films or using original storylines.

Bond video games, however, didn't reach their popular stride until 1997's ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'' by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] for the [[Nintendo 64]].<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/top10 Goldeneye 007 Ranking on GameFaqs Top 10 Games]</ref> Subsequently, virtually every Bond video game has attempted to copy the accomplishments and features of ''GoldenEye 007'' to varying degrees of success; even going so far as to have a game entitled ''[[GoldenEye: Rogue Agent]]'' that had little to do with either the video game ''GoldenEye 007'' or the film of the same name. Bond himself plays only a minor role in which he is "killed" in the beginning during a '[[virtual reality]]' mission, which served as a tutorial for the game.

Since acquiring the licence in 1999, [[Electronic Arts]] has released eight games, five of which have original stories, including the popular ''[[Everything or Nothing]]'', which broke away from the [[first-person shooter]] trend that started with ''GoldenEye 007'' and instead featured a [[third-person shooter|third-person]] perspective. It also featured well known actors including [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Heidi Klum]], [[Judi Dench]], [[John Cleese]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]] as James Bond, although several previous games have used Brosnan's likeness as Bond. In 2005, Electronic Arts released another game in the same vein as ''Everything or Nothing'', this time a video game adaptation of ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia with Love]]'', which allowed the player to play as Bond with the likeness of [[Sean Connery]]. This was the second game based on a Connery Bond film (the first was a 1980s [[text adventure]] adaptation of ''Goldfinger'') and the first to use the actor's likeness as agent 007. Connery himself recorded new voice-overs for the game, the first time the actor had played Bond in twenty-two years.

In 2006, [[Activision]] secured the licence to make Bond-related games, currently shared with EA. The deal will become exclusive in September 2007.<ref>{{cite web | first=Ben | last=Fritz | title=Action traction: Bond, Superman games on the move | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117942524?categoryid=18&cs=1 | publisher=Variety | date=[[2006-05-03]]|accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> and release a game to tie in with the 22nd Bond movie, due for release in November 2008.

==Comic strips and comic books==
{{main|James Bond comic strips|James Bond comic books}}

In 1957 the ''[[Daily Express]]'', a newspaper owned by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips. After initial reluctance by Fleming who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed and the first strip ''[[Casino Royale#Comic strip adaptation|Casino Royale]]'' was published in 1958. Since then many illustrated adventures of James Bond have been published, including every Ian Fleming novel as well as [[Kingsley Amis|Kingsley Amis's]] ''[[Colonel Sun]]'', and most of Fleming's short stories. Later, the comic strip produced original stories, continuing until 1983.

[[Titan Books]] is presently reprinting these comic strips in an [[ongoing series]] of [[graphic novel]]-style collections; by the end of 2005 it had completed reprinting all Fleming-based adaptations as well as ''Colonel Sun'' and had moved on to reprinting original stories.

Several [[comic book]] adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years, as well as numerous original stories.

==Bond characters==
{{main|List of James Bond allies|List of James Bond villains|Bond girl}}

The James Bond series of novels and films have a plethora of allies and villains. Bond's superiors and other officers of the British Secret Service are generally known by letters, such as [[M (James Bond)|M]] and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]. In the novels (but not in the films), Bond has had two secretaries, [[List of James Bond allies#Ponsonby, Loelia|Loelia Ponsonby]] and [[List of James Bond allies#Goodnight, Mary|Mary Goodnight]], who in the films typically have their roles and lines transferred to M's secretary, [[Miss Moneypenny]]. Occasionally Bond is assigned to work a case with his good friend, [[Felix Leiter]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. In the films, Leiter appeared regularly during the Connery era, only once during Moore's tenure, and in both Dalton films; however, he was only played by the same actor twice. Absent from the Brosnan era of films, Felix returned in Craig's first James Bond film ''Casino Royale'' in 2006.

Bond's women, particularly in the films, often have [[double entendre]] names, leading to coy jokes, for example, "[[Pussy Galore (James Bond)|Pussy Galore]]" in ''Goldfinger'' (a name invented by Fleming), "[[Plenty O'Toole]]" in ''Diamonds Are Forever'', and "[[Xenia Onatopp]]" (a [[villainess]] sexually excited by [[strangling]] men with her thighs) in ''GoldenEye''.

Throughout both the novels and the films there have only been a handful of [[recurring character]]s. Some of the more memorable ones include [[List of James Bond allies#Tanner, Bill|Bill Tanner]], [[List of James Bond allies#Mathis, Rene|Rene Mathis]], [[Felix Leiter]], [[List of James Bond allies#Wade, Jack|Jack Wade]], [[Jaws (James Bond)#|Jaws]] and recently [[Charles Robinson (James Bond)|Charles Robinson]]. [[J.W. Pepper]] is also a recurring character. .<ref name="Legacy">{{cite book | last = Cork | first = John | year = 2002 | title = James Bond: The Legacy | publisher = Boxtree/Mcmillan | id = ISBN 0-8109-3296-2 }}</ref> Only a single actor, [[Joe Don Baker]], has portrayed both a Bond villian (Brad Whitaker in [[Living Daylights]]) and an allie ([[List of James Bond allies#Wade, Jack|Jack Wade]] in [[Tomorrow Never Dies]] and [[GoldenEye]]).

==Vehicles and gadgets==
{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets|List of James Bond firearms}}
Exotic espionage equipment and vehicles are very popular elements of James Bond's literary and cinematic missions. These items often prove critically important to Bond in successfully completing his missions.
[[Image:Aston.db5.coupe.300pix.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The [[Aston Martin DB5]] is probably the most famous and recognized Bond car]]
Fleming's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as ''From Russia with Love's'' booby-trapped [[attaché case]]. In ''Dr. No'', Bond's sole gadgets were a [[Geiger counter]] and a wristwatch with a luminous (and [[radioactive]]) face. The gadgets, however, assumed a higher, spectacular profile in the 1964 film ''Goldfinger''. The film's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to 007. In the opinion of many critics and fans, some Bond films have included too many outlandish gadgets and vehicles<ref>{{cite book | last = Lindner | first = Christoph | year = 2003 | title = The James Bond Phenomenon: A Critical Reader | publisher = Manchester University Press | id = ISBN 0-7190-6541-0 }}</ref>, such as 1979's [[science fiction]] – oriented ''Moonraker'' and 2002's ''Die Another Day'', in which Bond's [[Aston Martin]] could actually become [[invisibility|invisible]] thanks to a technology Q refers to as [[active camouflage|adaptive camouflage]]. Since ''Moonraker'', subsequent productions struggled with balancing gadget content against the story without depicting a technology-dependent man, to mixed results.

Bond's most famous car is the silver grey [[Aston Martin DB5]], as seen in ''Goldfinger'', ''Thunderball'', ''GoldenEye'', ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' and ''Casino Royale''. The films have used a number of different Aston Martin DB5s for filming and publicity; one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in [[Arizona]] for $2,090,000 to an unnamed European collector. That specific car was originally sold for £5,000 in 1970.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4633986.stm | title = Aston Martin DB5 auction | work = James Bond car sold for over £1m | accessdate = February 8 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

In Fleming's books, Bond had a penchant for "battleship grey" [[Bentley]]s, while Gardner awarded the agent a modified [[Saab 900]] Turbo (nicknamed the [[Licence Renewed#The Silver Beast|Silver Beast]]) and later a [[Bentley Mulsanne]] Turbo.

In the James Bond film adaptations, Bond has been associated with several well-known watches, usually outfitted with high-tech features not found on production models. Perhaps the most famous of these is the [[Rolex Submariner]], which appeared during the Sean Connery films. Roger Moore's James Bond was fond of Seiko quartz watches. Pierce Brosnan's and Daniel Craig's James Bonds were both devotees of [[Omega SA|Omega]]. The selection of James Bond's watch has been a matter of both style and finance, as product placement agreements with the watch manufacturers have frequently been arranged.

Bond's weapon of choice in the beginning of ''Dr. No'' is a [[Beretta]] in 6.35mm Browning caliber, also called "Lilliput", later replaced by the German-made [[Walther PPK]] in 7.65mm Browning. The PPK was used in every subsequent film and became his [[signature weapon]] until the ending of ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', when Bond upgraded to the [[Walther P99]]. He has subsequently used the P99 pistol in ''The World Is Not Enough'', ''Die Another Day'', and ''Casino Royale''.<ref name="Legacy">Legacy</ref>
