The '''Youngstown Ohio Works''' baseball team was one of scores of minor league clubs that appeared in [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]] in the early 20th century. The Ohio Works team, which served as a training ground for players and officials who later established themselves in [[major league baseball]], won the premiere championship of the [[Ohio-Pennsylvania League]].<ref>http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,412,5,0</ref>

== Formation and league championship==

The Ohio Works team was organized in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], as early as [[1903]], under the sponsorship of [[Joseph A. McDonald]], superintendent of the Ohio Works of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]]. In [[1905]], the club joined the Class C Division Ohio-Pennsylvania League. Records suggest that the name, "Youngstown Ohio Works", became officially associated with the club at that time.<ref>Peter Filchia, ''Professional Baseball Franchises: From the Abbeville Athletics to the Zanesville Indians'' (New York: Facts on File, 1993), p. 258.</ref> From the outset, the Youngstown-based ball club was managed by ex-major leaguer [[Marty Hogan]], a former [[outfielder]] for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and [[St. Louis Browns]].<ref>The Hogan-Cullinan Family Collection, Mahoning Valley Historical Society, Youngstown, Ohio.</ref>

In September 1905, Hogan led the Youngstown Ohio Works to the league championship, though sources disagree on the club's final record. As baseball researcher John Zajc writes: "''The Reach Guide'' (1906) credits Youngstown with an 84-32 won-lost record where the ''Spalding Guide'' of the same year list a 90-35 record. The ''Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball'' (1993) tells a third story, giving Youngstown an 88-35 mark".<ref>http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,412,5,0</ref> In the wake of this achievement, the team became popularly known as "the Champs",<ref>''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', Youngstown, Ohio, June 19, 1906</ref> though  this name would not be officially associated with a Youngstown-based ball club until 1907.<ref>Peter Filchia, ''Professional Baseball Franchises: From the Abbeville Athletics to the Zanesville Indians'' (New York: Facts on File, 1993), p. 258.</ref> 

Early in the 1906 season, as the Youngstown club prepared to meet the rival [[Zanesville]] (Ohio) Moguls, manager Hogan expressed confidence about his team's prospects of winning the league pennant. "If the boys go through the season as they are playing now, we will have no trouble winning out", he said to a reporter with ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator''. "Our pitchers are in good condition and are holding the opposing batsmen to few hits. It is the pitching staff that has saved many a game for us. We have no .350 batters on the club, but any man on it is liable to step in and break up a game".<ref>''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', Youngstown, Ohio, June 19, 1906.</ref> The manager's confidence was evidently well placed. According to an article that appeared in the ''[[The Vindicator|Youngstown Daily Vindicator]]'' in October [[1906]], the Ohio Works team won three "state [[pennant]]s" under Hogan's leadership.<ref>''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', Youngstown, Ohio, Oct. 14, 1906.</ref>

== Dissolution ==

Disagreements over funding, however, culminated in the club's sale and relocation in early [[1907]]. An article published in the ''Zanesville Signal'' on February 19, [[1907]], reported that Hogan received permission from "the Messrs. McDonald" to [[negotiation|negotiate]] a $3,000 deal for the sale of the team (including its players) to a group of Zanesville [[investors]]. In the same article, Hogan was quoted as saying, "Youngstown couldn't or didn't raise enough money to cover a [[sparrow]]'s blanket".<ref>''The Zanesville Signal'', Zanesville, Ohio, February 19, 1907.</ref> 

Hogan's anger arose from the fact that he had turned down an offer to manage a ball club in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in the wake of a [[verbal agreement]] with Joseph McDonald and his brother, Thomas G. McDonald.<ref>''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', Youngstown, Ohio, October 10, 1906.</ref> It appears that the McDonald brothers presented final terms that fell short of that earlier agreement. This interpretation of events is supported by comments published in ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'' almost a week later. When Hogan was asked why he did not plan to manage the Youngstown ball club in the 1907 season, he reportedly replied, "I'm the man who got the short end of the deal and I do not intend to stand for it".<ref>''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', Youngstown, Ohio, Feb. 24, 1907.</ref> (The story must have been published some time after the interview, because no reference was made to the club's sale.) 

The former Ohio Works manager wasn't alone in suggesting that Joseph McDonald had employed "unsportsmanlike tactics".<ref>''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', Youngstown, Ohio, May 2, 1920.</ref> According to a later newspaper account, McDonald had taken deliberate steps to replace the "[[amateur]]" Ohio Works team with a more seasoned club from [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]],<ref>''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', Youngstown, Ohio, May 2, 1920.</ref> which became officially known as the "Youngstown Champs".<ref>Peter Filchia, ''Professional Baseball Franchises: From the Abbeville Athletics to the Zanesville Indians'' (New York: Facts on File, 1993), p. 258.</ref> It seems unlikely that Hogan would have considered cooperating in such a scheme. While newspaper reports paint him as a taskmaster who "handled his men without gloves when the occasion required", they also suggest he was loyal to his players.<ref>''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', Youngstown, Ohio, Oct. 14, 1906.</ref> McDonald's reported strategy, which may have been a factor in his rift with Hogan, apparently angered Youngstown baseball fans. The local media highlighted the Champs' unexpected loss to the amateur [[Rayen High School (Youngstown, Ohio)|Rayen]] Athletics in [[1907]].<ref>''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', Youngstown, Ohio, May 2, 1920.</ref>

On November 6, [[1912]], ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'' reported that Hogan (fresh from stints as a manager in Zanesville and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]) was likely to once again manage a local ball club.<ref>''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', Youngstown, Ohio, Nov. 6, 1912.</ref> Hogan opted to manage a team in Zanesville, where he signed future [[Cleveland Indians]] pitcher [[Sad Sam Jones|Sam Jones]] to his first professional contract.<ref>http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&pid=2264&bid=1194</ref>

== Legacy ==

The Youngstown Ohio Works is often remembered for its role in launching the career of [[Hall of Fame]] umpire [[Billy Evans]]. On September 1, [[1903]], Evans, a reporter at ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', was assigned to cover a game between the Ohio Works and the [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]] Library Athletic Club in Youngstown. Club manager Hogan offered Evans $15 to fill an umpire vacancy. (In 1905, Evans received another career boost from Youngstown native [[Jimmy McAleer]], who recommended Evans to the [[American League]].)<ref>Jon Baker, In Valley's Baseball History, Evans Was an Early Scrapper", ''The Valley Voice'', Youngstown, Ohio, July 1-7, 2005.</ref> 

Overall, the Ohio Works team would prove to be just one chapter in Youngstown's rich history of amateur and minor league baseball. For decades, the community hosted the National Amateur Baseball Federation championship. Significantly, NABF officials praised Youngstown's sports establishment in [[1946]] for the pristine condition of the community's sandlot [[baseball diamond]]s, which were regarded as among the best in the country.<ref>''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', Youngstown, Ohio, Sept. 16, 1946.</ref>
