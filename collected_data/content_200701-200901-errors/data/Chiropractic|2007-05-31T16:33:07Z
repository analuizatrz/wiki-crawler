'''Chiropractic''' is a [[Complementary and alternative medicine|complementary and alternative]] [[health care]] [[profession]] with the purpose of diagnosing and treating mechanical disorders of the [[Vertebral column|spine]] and [[musculoskeletal system]] with the intention of affecting the [[nervous system]] and improving [[health]].<ref>[http://www.cce-usa.org/2006%20January%20STANDARDS.pdf Council on Chiropractic Education pdf see page 15]</ref> It is based on the premise that a [[Vertebral column|spinal joint]] dysfunction can interfere with the nervous system and result in many different conditions of diminished health.  Some chiropractors still use the term [[vertebral subluxation]] to describe what they treat.  Others have dropped this concept and concentrate mostly on the musculoskeletal components of spinal injury and rehabilitation of the spine.<ref>Association of Chiropractic Colleges, [http://www.chirocolleges.org/paradigm_scopet.html Chiropractic Paradigm]</ref> Chiropractic treatments vary depending on the patient's condition and the type of approach taken by the particular chiropractor. They often include spinal adjustments, although other interventions are used as well. In contrast, the term [[subluxation]] as used in conventional medicine is usually associated with specific conditions which are a direct consequence of injury to joints or associated nerves.  It should be noted, however, that not all chiropractic institutions subscribe to the vertebral subluxation theory; notably schools in Canada,<ref>[https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw030?owa_no_site=679]</ref><ref>[http://www.cmcc.ca/PDF/2006/CMCC_Calendar06to07.pdf]</ref> Denmark and the United Kingdom have rejected the subluxation model in favour of an evidence-based framework.

Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by [[Daniel David Palmer|D. D. Palmer]], and it is now practiced in more than 100 countries.<ref name="fclb-qa">Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards, Questions and Answers about Professional Regulation and the Chiropractic Profession, ''Where are chiropractors regulated?'', January 9, 2006.[http://www.fclb.org/Q&A.htm#Q2 available online]</ref><ref "diplomatic">Michel Tetrault, DC, ''Country Chiropractic Support'', Chiropractic Diplomatic Corps.  [http://www.chiropracticdiplomatic.com/missions/country_support.html available online]</ref> The history of Chiropractic has been shaped by philosophical conflicts within the profession and by criticism from outside the profession. Eventually, these led to scientific reform within many of the schools of chiropractic, and an antitrust suit against the [[American Medical Association|AMA]].

Today there are four main groups of chiropractors: "traditional straights", "objective straights", "mixers", and "reform". All groups, except reform, treat patients using a subluxation-based system. Differences are based on the philosophy for adjusting, claims made about the effects of those adjustments, and various additional treatments provided along with the [[spinal adjustment|adjustment]].

== History ==
Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by [[Daniel David Palmer]], based on his assertion that 95% of all health problems could be prevented or treated using adjustments of the spine ([[spinal adjustment]]s), and 5% by adjustment of other joints, to correct what he termed [[vertebral subluxation]]s. He, and later his son [[B.J. Palmer]], proposed that subluxations were misaligned vertebrae which caused nerve compression that interfered with the transmission of what he named [[Innate Intelligence]]. This interference interrupted the proper flow of Innate Intelligence from "above, down, inside, and out" to the organ to which it traveled. As a result, the human body would experience "dis-ease" or disharmony which would result in loss of health. 

== Explanation ==

[[Joint manipulation|Manipulation]] of the [[Vertebral column|spine]] is the main technique in today's chiropractic [[Spinal adjustment|adjustment]], or treatment. Though its use has been documented from the time of the ancient Egyptians,<ref name=Homola>Homola S, "Chiropractic, Bonesetting, and Cultism",[http://www.chirobase.org/05RB/BCC/00c.html Chiropractic, Bonesetting, and Cultism] (entire book on-line)</ref> spinal manipulation in an attempt to correct the theoretical vertebral subluxation is solely a chiropractic endeavor. Chiropractic's contribution to the field of manipulative therapies is the concept of applying a precise adjustment to a specific affected vertebra, as opposed to the generalized maneuvers of the early [[osteopath]]s. 

While some chiropractors adhere strictly to the use of only spinal manipulation in their adjustment, others include a broad range of methods directed at correcting the [[vertebral subluxation|subluxation]] and/or just relieving musculoskeletal pain. Examples include [[massage]], [[strength training]], [[dry_needling|dry needling]] (similar to [[acupuncture]]), [[functional electrical stimulation]], and [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]].

Some chiropractors specialize in treating specific musculoskeletal problems or sports injuries, or they may combine chiropractic with [[joint manipulation|manipulation]] of the extremities, [[nutrition]], or [[exercise]]s to increase spinal strength or improve overall health. Some also use other complementary and alternative methods as a part of a [[holistic]] treatment approach. However, chiropractors do not prescribe drugs; they believe this to be the province of conventional medicine, and that their role is to pursue drug-free alternative treatments. Depending on the country or state in which the Chiropractic school is located, some train in minor surgery. When indicated, the doctor of chiropractic consults with, co-manages, or refers to other health care providers.<ref name=CCE>The Council on Chiropractic Education (2006), Standards for Doctor of Chiropractic Programs and Requirements for Institutional Status [http://www.cce-usa.org/2006%20January%20STANDARDS.pdf available online]</ref>

== Theories ==

While the "pinched garden hose theory" has mostly been abandoned, it  is still used in a modified form by some chiropractors to explain vertebral subluxation. However, the concept of the subluxation remains integral to typical chiropractic practice. In 2003, 90% of chiropractors believed the [[vertebral subluxation|vertebral subluxation complex]] played a significant role in all or most diseases.<ref name="mcdonald">McDonald W (2003) ''How Chiropractors Think and Practice: The Survey of North American Chiropractors.'' Institute for Social Research, Ohio Northern University</ref> 

There is evidence that [[joint manipulation|spinal manipulation]] is effective for the treatment of acute low back pain, tension headaches and some musculoskeletal issues, but not all studies support this conclusion.<ref name =Duke>McCrory DC, et al.

== Origins of Chiropractic and the concept of subluxation ==

[[Image:Gray839.png|thumb|360px|Autonomic Nervous System<BR>Blue = parasympathetic<BR>Red = sympathetic]]
{{main|Vertebral subluxation}}
DD Palmer, using a [[vitalism|vitalistic]] approach, imbued the term [[vertebral subluxation|subluxation]] with a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[philosophical]] meaning. He held that a malposition of spinal [[bone]]s, which protect the spinal cord and nerve roots, interfered with the transmission of nerve impulses. Because half of the nervous system is sensory and the other half motor (control), he postulated that living things had an [[Innate intelligence]], a kind of "spiritual energy" or [[life force]] that received the sensory information from the various parts of the body and made a decision as to what the motor nerves should convey. DD Palmer claimed that subluxations interfered with this innate intelligence, and that by fixing them, all diseases could be treated.<ref>Palmer D.D., The Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic. Portland, Oregon: Portland Printing House Company, 1910.</ref>  He qualified this by noting that knowledge of Innate Intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.<ref name ="Forgotten Theories">Keating J (1995), D.D. Palmer's Forgotten Theories of Chiropractic, [http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf A Presentation to the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College]</ref>
  
The idea that all diseases were the result of a subluxation was in line with the common thinking of the day; that there was one cause for disease. The vitalistic concepts implied an intelligent governing entity that was readily perceived as spiritual constructs by many both inside and outside the profession. Chiropractors used these metaphorical concepts to rationalize their thinking about the body’s self-healing capacity.<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/> In 1998, Lon Morgan DC, a reform chiropractor, wrote that: "Innate Intelligence clearly has its origins in borrowed mystical and occult practices of a bygone era. It remains untestable and unverifiable and has an unacceptably high penalty/benefit ratio for the chiropractic profession. The chiropractic concept of Innate Intelligence is an anachronistic holdover from a time when insufficient scientific understanding existed to explain human physiological processes. It is clearly religious in nature and must be considered harmful to normal scientific activity."<ref name="Morgan">Morgan L (1998) Innate intelligence: its origins and problems ''J Can Chir Ass'' 42:35-41 [http://www.jcca-online.org/Client/cca/jcca.nsf/Articles/52C805D03B6EAB9F852569B40059418F?OpenDocument available online]</ref>

Meridel I. Gatterman DC, educator and writer observed: 
:"The word subluxation has been ... embodied with a multitude of meaning by chiropractors during the past one hundred years. To some it has become the holy word; to others, an albatross to be discarded ... to add to the confusion, more than 100 synonyms for subluxation have been used. Why then do we persist in using the term when it has become so overburdened with clinical, political, and philosophical ... significance ... that the concept that once helped to hold a young profession together now divides it and keeps it quarrelling over basic semantics? The obvious answer is: The concept of subluxation is central to chiropractic."<ref>Gatterman MI. Foundations of the Chiropractic
Subluxation. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins, 1988:6. [http://www.jcca-online.org/client/cca/JCCA.nsf/objects/Commentary:+Subluxation-the+silent+killer/$file/2-commentary.pdf#search=%22Homola%20DC%22 referenced in]</ref>

Debate about the need to remove the concept of subluxation from the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing since the mid 1960s. While straights hold firmly to the term and its vitalistic construct, reformers suggest that the mechanistic model will allow chiropractic to better integrate into mainstream medicine without making claims inherent in the term. Anthony Rosner PhD, director of education and research at the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (FCER) considered subluxation and the concept of [[Occam's razor]]. He suggests "there is no obvious reason to discard the concept of subluxation, while at the same time maintaining that it is not a rigid entity, but rather an important model and concept; a work in progress that undoubtedly will undergo extensive modification as our concepts of light or psychoanalysis have evolved over half a century."<ref name="Anthony Rosner">Rosner A (2006) [http://www.chiroweb.com/columnist/rosner/ Occam's razor and subluxation: a close shave], ''Dynamic Chiropractic'' Aug 2006</ref>

Despite the term's vitalistic roots, chiropractic today may still use the term Innate Intelligence; however, it has taken on a less metaphysical meaning. Innate Intelligence today is used to describe the self-healing power of the body. Thus, a modern chiropractic view is that by removing the restrictions caused by subluxation, the chiropractor is improving the body's own potential for self-healing.<ref>Nelson CF, Lawrence DJ, Triano JJ, Bronfort G, Perle SM, Metz RD, Hegetschweiler K, La Brot T.

== Chiropractic’s approach to healthcare ==

According to Robert Mootz [[Doctor of Chiropractic|D.C.]] and Reed Phillips [[Doctor of Chiropractic|D.C.]], [[Ph.D.]], although chiropractic has much in common with other health professions, its philosophical approach distinguishes it from modern medicine. Chiropractic philosophy involves what has been described as a "contextual, naturopathic approach" to health care.<ref>Black D (1990)''Inner Wisdom: The Challenge of Contextual Healing''. Springville, UT: Tapestry Press</ref> The traditional, "allopathic" or "medical" model considers disease as generally the result of some external influence, such as a toxin, a parasite, an allergen, or an infectious agent: the solution is to counter the perceived environmental factor (e.g., using an antibiotic for a bacterial infection). By contrast, the ''naturopathic'' approach considers that lowered "host resistance" is necessary for disease to occur, so the appropriate solution is to direct treatment to strengthen the host, regardless of the environment. In contemporary clinical practice, one can find elements of both naturopathic and allopathic philosophy among all types of providers.<ref name="Chiro Beliefs">AHCPR Chapter II [http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/ahcpr/chapter2.htm Chiropractic Belief Systems]</ref>  The degree to which a practitioner emphasizes different tenets of these philosophies is one factor that determines the manner in which they practice.

The Chiropractic approach to healthcare stresses the importance of prevention. Former president of National College of Chiropractic, Joseph Janse DC (1909-1985) explains: 
:"Unless pathology is demonstrable under the microscope, as in the laboratory or by roentgenograms, to them [allopaths] it does not exist. For years the progressive minds in chiropractic have pointed out this deficiency. With emphasis they [chiropractors] have maintained the fact that prevention is so much more effective than attempts at a cure. They pioneered the all-important principle that effective eradication of disease is accomplished only when it is in its functional (beginning) phase rather than its organic (terminal) stage. It has been their contention that in general the doctor, the therapist and the clinician have failed to realize exactly what is meant by disease processes, and have been satisfied to consider damaged organs as disease, and to think in terms of sick organs and not in terms of sick people. In other words, we have failed to contrast disease with health, and to trace the gradual deteriorization along the downward path, believing almost that mild departures from the physiological normal were of little consequence, until they were replaced by pathological changes..." 

Most patients who visit a chiropractor do so initially with a [[chief complaint]] related to musculoskeletal problems (especially low back and neck pain), although most chiropractors say they concern themselves with the overall health of the patient. According to a survey by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], in 2002, chiropractic was the fourth (7.5%) most commonly used [[complementary and alternative medicine|CAM]] therapy among adults in the USA.<ref>''More Than One-Third of U.S. Adults Use Complementary and Alternative Medicine, According to New Government Survey'' (Press Release), [[May 27]] 2004, [http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2004/052704.htm available online]</ref><ref>''Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults: United States, 2002'' (Report), [[May 27]] 2004, [http://nccam.nih.gov/news/report.pdf available online] ([[PDF]] format)</ref> The profession has evolved so that treatment consists of hundreds of different techniques.<ref>Burton, Bernard. [http://www.betterbacks.com/presentation.htm "Chiropractic Management of Low Back Pain"] Cleveland Clinic: Spinal Care 2000 Symposium. March 30, 2000.</ref>  The U.S. Department of Labor's [[Occupational Outlook Handbook]] said:
:Because chiropractors emphasize the importance of healthy lifestyles and do not prescribe drugs or perform surgery, chiropractic care is appealing to many health-conscious Americans. Chiropractic treatment of the back, neck, extremities, and joints has become more accepted as a result of research and changing attitudes about alternative, noninvasive health care practices.<ref name="Bureau of Labor">[http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos071.htm#outlook Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Outlook Handbook]</ref>

Most DCs are in private practice or work in small groups, employing chiropractic assistants as office staff and to perform therapeutic activities. They may also employ massage and physiotherapists as adjuncts to chiropractic care.

== History ==

{{main|Chiropractic history}}
[[image:ddpalmer3.jpg|thumb|left|275px|DD Palmer]]
DD Palmer gave the first chiropractic adjustment to a deaf janitor, Harvey Lillard, on [[September 18]], [[1895]]. 
[[Image:Rev_Samual_Weed.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Rev. Samuel Weed]]
Friend and Rev. Samuel Weed suggested combining the words ''cheiros'' and ''praktikos'' (meaning "done by hand") to describe Palmer's treatment method, creating the term "''chiropractic."'' In 1896, DD added a school to his magnetic healing infirmary, and began to teach others his method. It would be become known as Palmer School of Chiropractic (PSC, now [[Palmer College of Chiropractic]]). 

=== Medicine vs. chiropractic ===

In September 1899, a medical doctor in Davenport, IA, named Heinrich Matthey started a campaign against drugless healers in Iowa.  DD Palmer, whose school had just graduated its 7th student, insisted that his techniques did not need the same courses or license as medical doctors, as his graduates did not prescribe drugs or evaluate blood or urine. However, in 1906, Palmer was convicted for practicing medicine without a license.  He chose to turn over his interests in the PSC to his son, BJ and wife, Mabel.

=== BJ Palmer re-develops chiropractic ===

[[Image:BJPalmer2.jpg|thumb|left|130px|BJ Palmer Developer of Chiropractic 1882-1961]]
BJ created the Universal Chiropractic Association (UCA) for the purpose of protecting its members by covering their legal expenses should they get arrested.<ref>Keating J. (1999), [http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/17/25/09.html Tom Moore Defender of Chiropractic Part 1], ''Dynamic Chiropractic''</ref> Its first case came in 1907, when Shegataro Morikubo DC of Wisconsin was charged with unlicensed practice of osteopathy. Morikubo was freed using the defense that chiropractic philosophy was different than osteopathic philosophy.  The victory reshaped the development of the chiropractic profession, which then marketed itself as a science, an art ''and a philosophy'', and BJ Palmer became the "Philosopher of Chiropractic".

=== Straight versus mixer ===

State laws to regulate and protect chiropractic practice were eventually introduced in all fifty states in the US, but it was a hard-fought struggle. Medical Examining Boards worked to keep all healthcare practices under their legal control, but an internal struggle among DCs on how to structure the laws significantly complicated the process. Initially, the UCA, led by BJ Palmer and armed with his philosophy, opposed state licensure altogether. Palmer feared that such regulation would lead to allopathic control of the profession.<ref name="Chiro Educ">Phillips R (1998), [http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/16/07/23.html ''Education and the Chiropractic Profession''], Dynamic Chiropractic</ref> The UCA eventually caved in, but BJ remained strong in the opinion that examining boards should be composed exclusively of chiropractors (not those who mixed chiropractic with other remedies).  Mixers campaigned to increase education standards equivalent to medical schools while Palmer resisted any increase in standards.

=== The movement toward science ===

In 1975, the [[National Institutes of Health]] brought chiropractors, osteopaths, medical doctors and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] scientists together in a conference on spinal [[joint manipulation|manipulation]] to develop strategies to study the effects of spinal [[joint manipulation|manipulation]]. In 1978, the ''Journal of Manipulative & Physiological Therapeutics'' (JMPT) was launched, and in 1981 it was included in the National Library of Medicine's ''Index Medicus''.<ref name="Faulty Logic">Keating J [http://www.sherman.edu/research/rsch510/FaultyLogic-in-Chiro.pdf Faulty Logic & Non-skeptical Arguments in Chiropractic]</ref> Joseph Keating dates the birth of chiropractic as a science to a 1983 commentary in the JMPT entitled "Notes from the (chiropractic college) underground" in which Kenneth F. DeBoer, then an instructor in basic science at Palmer College in Iowa, revealed the power of a scholarly journal (JMPT) to empower faculty at the chiropractic schools. DeBoer's opinion piece demonstrated the faculty's authority to challenge the status quo, to publicly address relevant, albeit sensitive, issues related to research, training and skepticism at chiropractic colleges, and to produce "cultural change" within the chiropractic schools so as to increase research and professional standards. It was a rallying call for chiropractic scientists and scholars.<ref name="Faulty Logic"/>
<!-- **Move to a separate article? Summarize? Definitely need source referencing **
Under the direciton of Dr.Rob Francis, Dean of Clincal Sciences at TCC, the full momentum swinging chiropractic into the orhtodox health care delivery system was pioneered through Texas Chiropractic College (TCC) which led the way for chiropractic's entrance into mainstream medical acceptance of chiropractors practicinig in the orthodox health care delivery system through the development of the first hospital rotation program for chiropractic students.
The first hospital rotation for chiropractic interns and the first certification course in Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA) for chiropractors was developed in the 1980’s, by Dr. Rob Francis while Dean of Clinical Sciences at Texas Chiropractic College. 
After developing and implementing a hospital based clinical rotation for chiropractic interns at the Texas Medical Center in orthopedic surgery, Dr. Francis embarked on a mission to incorporate chiropractic services in the hospital setting by pioneering medical staff privileges for chiropractors. After successfully gaining full medial staff privileges for chiropractors at local Houston hospitals, Dr. Francis began to organize the academic programs to certify doctors of chiropractic in Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA) and Hospital Protocol.
After Dr. Francis was certified and proctored clinically in Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA) by board certified orthopedic surgeons, he was granted clinical privileges to admit patients to the hospital operating room for this procedure. Soon thereafter he developed a board approved MUA certification course for chiropractors that included hospital protocol, operating room proficiency and clincial proctorship in MUA under the auspices of the TCC Division of Post Graduate Studies.
The course became quite popular with a large number of chiropractors around the country seeking parity with medical physicians in the orthodox health care delivery system during the early 1990’s. Soon other colleges followed the TCC MUA model and began offering through post graduate programs the TCC-developed MUA certification course.
The hospital rotation program for chiropractic interns was developed during the same time period and became another TCC model for other colleges interested in providing chiropractic interns with the opportunity to rotate through hospitals and share chiropractic clinical models with their medical colleagues.
Dr. Francis initially personally selected the interns to rotate through the orthopedic service at the Texas Medical Center but soon the request by the medical staff and faculty for more chiropractic interns to rotate through services other than orthopedics allowed the program to expand to include rotations in family practice, internal medicine, radiology, neurosurgery, physical medicine and rheumatology. 
Towards an effort to shepherd this rapid expansion in a meaningful fashion, Dr. Francis recruited other TCC faculty members to participate in the hospital rotation program for TCC interns. The faculty involved in the hospital based program monitored the activity and interaction between the interns, medical students, medical school faculty and attending physicians at the hospital subsequently leading to the to development of didactic presentations at Hospital Grand Rounds to the hospital staff, medical school physicians and faculty at the medical center hospitals.
Presentations on the Rationale for Spinal Manipulative Therapy, Skeletal Radiology, Diagnostic Imaging and other clinical presentations were made by the TCC faculty leading the way for further expansion of the program.
Dr. Francis currently holds appointment as Clinical Assistant Professor of Family Medicine in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and has participated in federally funded research programs at the medical school to develop curriculum model for teaching CAM therapies to medical students.
Dr. Francis continues to teach the MUA certification courses around the country and has expanded the course to Europe teaching MUA to European chiropractors in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and France.
The intern hospital rotation program continues to bridge the chasm of communication that once existed between the medical community and the chiropractic profession. -->

=== Wilk ''et al.'' vs the American Medical Association (AMA) ===

{{main|Wilk v. American Medical Association}} 

Until 1983, the AMA held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with an "unscientific practitioner", and labeled chiropractic "an unscientific cult". Principle 3 of the AMA Principles of Medical Ethics stated: 
:"A physician should practice a method of healing founded on a scientific basis; and he should not voluntarily professionally associate with anyone who violates this principle." 
Chicago chiropractor, Chester A. Wilk initiated an [[antitrust]] suit against the AMA and other medical associations in 1976 - [[Wilk v. American Medical Association|Wilk ''et al.'' vs AMA ''et al.'']].<ref name="Sore Throat">Robbins J (1996),Medical monopoly: the game nobody wins - excerpt from 'Reclaiming Our Health: Exploding the Medical Myth and Embracing the Source of True Healing', ''Vegetarian Times'' [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0820/is_n230/ai_18696325/pg_3 available online]</ref> The landmark lawsuit ended in 1987 when the US District Court found the AMA guilty of conspiracy and restraint of trade; the Joint Council on Accreditation of Hospitals and the American College of Physicians were exonerated. The court recognized that the AMA had to show its concern for patients, but was not persuaded that this could not have been achieved in a manner less restrictive of competition, for instance by public education campaigns. The AMA lost its appeal to the Supreme Court, and had to allow its members to collaborate with DCs.<ref name = Wilk>[http://www.chiro.org/abstracts/amavschiro.pdf Wilk vs American Medical Association Summary]</ref>

Judge Susan Getzendanner, who presided over the Wilk case, said:

:"Evidence at the trial showed that the defendants took active steps, often covert, to undermine chiropractic educational institutions, conceal evidence of the usefulness of chiropractic care, undercut insurance programs for patients of chiropractors, subvert government inquiries into the efficacy of chiropractic, engage in a massive disinformation campaign to discredit and destabilize the chiropractic profession and engage in numerous other activities to maintain a medical physician monopoly over health care in this country." 

She then said that chiropractors clearly wanted "a judicial pronouncement that chiropractic is a valid, efficacious, even scientific health care service". She said no "well designed, controlled, scientific study" had been done, and concluded "I decline to pronounce chiropractic valid or invalid on anecdotal evidence, even though "the anecdotal evidence in the record favors chiropractors".<ref name = Wilk/>

Chiropractic researchers Robert Mootz and Reed Phillips suggest that, in chiropractic's early years, influences from both straight and mixer concepts were incorporated into its construct. They conclude that chiropractic has both [[materialism|materialistic]] qualities that lend themselves to scientific investigation and [[vitalism|vitalistic]] qualities that do not (Table 1). 

With relatively little federal funding, academic research in chiropractic has only recently become established in the USA. In 1994 and 1995, half of all grant funding to chiropractic researchers was from the US Health Resources and Services Administration (7 grants totaling $2.3 million). The Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (11 grants, $881,000) and the Consortium for Chiropractic Research (4 grants, $519,000) accounted for most of the rest. By 1997, there were 14 peer-reviewed chiropractic journals in English that encouraged the publication of chiropractic research, including ''The Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics (JMPT)'', ''Topics in Clinical Chiropractic'', and the ''Journal of Chiropractic Humanities''. However, of these, only ''JMPT'' is included in Index Medicus. Research into chiropractic, whether from Universities or chiropractic colleges, is however often published in many other scientific journals.<ref>Chirofind.com [http://www.chiroweb.com/find/research.html Chiropractic Research]</ref>

While there is still debate about the effectiveness of chiropractic for the many conditions in which it is applied, chiropractic seems to be most effective for acute low back pain and tension headaches.<ref name =Duke>McCrory DC, et al. (2001) ''Evidence Report: Behavioral and Physical Treatments for Tension-type and Cervicogenic Headache''. Duke University Evidence-Based Practice Center, Durham, North Carolina  [http://www.fcer.org/html/Research/DukeEvidenceReport.htm available online] ([[PDF]] format)
</ref> When testing the efficacy of health treatments, [[double blind]] studies are generally considered acceptable scientific rigor. These are designed so that neither the patient nor the doctor knows whether they are using the actual treatment or a placebo (or "sham") treatment. However, chiropractic treatment involves a [[Spinal adjustment|manipulation]]; no "sham" procedure can be devised easily for this, and even if the patient is unaware whether the treatment is a real or sham procedure, the doctor cannot be unaware. Thus there may be "observer bias" - the tendency to see what you expect to see, and the potential for the patient to wish to report benefits to "please" the doctor. This problem is not confined to chiropractic - many medical treatments are not amenable to double-blind placebo-controlled trials, indeed this is true for all surgical procedures. It is also a problem in evaluating treatments; even when there are objective outcome measures, the [[placebo effect]] can be very substantial. Thus, DCs have historically relied mostly on their own clinical experience and the shared experience of their colleagues, as reported in [[case studies]], to direct their treatment methods. In this, they are not different to the practice in much of conventional medicine.

Sociologist Leslie Biggs interviewed 600 Canadian DCs in 1997: while 86% felt that chiropractic methods needed to be validated, 74% did not believe that controlled clinical trials were the best way to evaluate chiropractic. Moreover, 68% believed that "most diseases are caused by spinal malalignment", although only 30% agreed that "subluxation was the cause of many diseases".<ref>Biggs L (2002) ''Measuring philosophy:

Even when a valid mechanism of action is not determined, it is generally thought sufficient to present evidence showing benefit for the claims made. There is wide agreement that, where applicable, an [[evidence based medicine]] framework should be used to assess health outcomes, and that systematic reviews with strict protocols are important for objectively evaluating treatments. Where evidence from such reviews is lacking, this does not necessarily mean that the treatment is ineffective, only that the case for a benefit of treatment may not have been rigorously established. 

A 2005 editorial in ''JMPT'', "The [[Cochrane Collaboration]]: is it relevant for doctors of chiropractic?"<ref>{{cite journal | author = French S, Green S | title = The Cochrane Collaboration: is it relevant for doctors of chiropractic? | journal = J Manip Physiol Ther | volume = 28 | pages = 641-2 | year = | id = PMID 16326231}}</ref> proposed that involvement in Cochrane collaboration would be a way for chiropractic to gain greater acceptance within medicine. The collaboration has 11,500 contributors from more than 90 countries organized in 50 review groups. For chiropractic, relevant review groups include the Back Group; the Bone, Joint, and Muscle Trauma Group; the Musculoskeletal Group; and the Neuromuscular Disease Group. The editorial states that, for example, "a chiropractor may provide conservative care supported by a Cochrane review to a patient with carpal tunnel syndrome. If the patient's symptoms become progressive, the doctor may consider referring the patient for surgery using a recent Cochrane review that examined new surgical techniques compared with traditional open surgery..."

The Cochrane Collaboration did not find enough evidence to support or refute the claim that manual therapy (including, but not limited to, chiropractic) is beneficial for [http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001002.html asthma]. [http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003219.html Carpal tunnel syndrome] trials have not shown benefit from diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, magnets, laser acupuncture, exercise or chiropractic and there is not enough evidence to show the effects of spinal [[joint manipulation|manipulation]] (including, but not limited to, chiropractic) for

According to Bandolier, a systematic review of a small, poor quality set of trials, provided no convincing evidence for long-term benefits of chiropractic interventions for acute or chronic low back pain, despite some positive overall findings  [http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/painpag/Chronrev/muscskel/CP092.html] but there might be some short-term pain relief, especially in patients with acute pain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Assendelft WJJ ''et al.''| title = The effectiveness of chiropractic for treatment of low back pain: an update and attempt at statistical pooling| journal = J Manip Physiol Ther | volume = 19 | pages = 499-507 | year = 1996| id = PMID 16326231}}</ref> However, the [[BMJ]] noted in a study on long-term low-back problems "...improvement in all patients at three years was about 29% more in those treated by chiropractors than in those treated by the hospitals. The beneficial effect of chiropractic on pain was particularly clear."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Meade ''et al.''| title = The effectiveness of chiropractic for treatment of low back pain: an update and attempt at statistical pooling| journal = Brit Med J | volume =  | pages = | year = 1995| id = PMID 16326231}}</ref>
A 1994 study by the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services endorses spinal [[joint manipulation|manipulation]] for acute low back pain in adults in its Clinical Practice Guideline.

The first significant recognition of the appropriateness of spinal [[joint manipulation|manipulation]] for low back pain was performed by the [[RAND]] Corporation. This meta-analysis concluded that some forms of spinal [[joint manipulation|manipulation]] were successful in treating certain types of lower back pain. Some chiropractors claimed these results as proof of chiropractic hypotheses, but RAND's studies were about spinal [[joint manipulation|manipulation]], not [[spinal adjustment|chiropractic]] specifically, and dealt with appropriateness, which is a measure of net benefit and harms; the efficacy of chiropractic and other treatments were not explicitly compared. In 1993, Dr Shekelle rebuked some DCs for their exaggerated claims: ...we have become aware of numerous instances where our results have been seriously misrepresented by chiropractors writing for their local paper or writing letters to the editor....<ref>Shekelle PM (1993) RAND misquoted. ''ACA J Chir'' 30:59–63</ref>

There is conflict in the results of chiropractic research. For instance, many DCs claim to treat [http://www.chiroweb.com/find/tellmeabout/colic.html infantile colic]. According to a 1999 survey, 46% of chiropractors in Ontario treated children for [[Baby_colic|colic]].<ref name="Verhoef">Verhoef MJ, Costa Papadopoulos C. ''Survey of Canadian chiropractors’involvement in the treatment of patients under the age of 18''.

In 1997, historian Joseph Keating Jr described chiropractic as a "science, antiscience and pseudoscience", and said "Although available scientific data support chiropractic's principle intervention method (the manipulation of patients with lower back pain), the doubting, skeptical attitudes of science do not predominate in chiropractic education or among practitioners". He argued that chiropractic's culture has nurtured antiscientific attitudes and activities, and that "a combination of uncritical rationalism and uncritical empiricism has been bolstered by the proliferation of pseudoscience journals of chiropractic wherein poor quality research and exuberant over-interpretation of results masquerade as science and provide false confidence about the value of various chiropractic techniques". However, in 1998, after reviewing the articles published in the ''JMPT'' from 1989-1996, he concluded, 
:"substantial increases in scholarly activities within the chiropractic profession are suggested by the growth in scholarly products published in the discipline's most distinguished periodical (JMPT). Increases in controlled outcome studies, collaboration among chiropractic institutions, contributions from nonchiropractors, contributions from nonchiropractic institutions and funding for research suggest a degree of professional maturation and growing interest in the content of the discipline."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Keating J ''et al.'' | title = A descriptive analysis of the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics, 1989-1996 | journal = J Manip Physiol Ther | volume = 21 |  pages = 539-52 | year = 1998 | id = PMID 9798183}}</ref>

==== The Manga Report ====

The Manga Report was an outcomes-study funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and conducted by three health economists led by Professor [[Pran Manga]]. The Report supported the scientific validity, safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of chiropractic for low-back pain, and found that chiropractic care had higher patient satisfaction levels than conventional alternatives. The report states that "The literature clearly and consistently shows that the major savings from chiropractic management come from fewer and lower costs of auxiliary services, fewer hospitalizations, and a highly significant reduction in chronic problems, as well as in levels and duration of disability."<ref>Manga P, Angus D.

==== Workers' Compensation studies ====

In 1998, a study of 10,652 Florida workers' compensation cases was conducted by Steve Wolk. He concluded that "a claimant with a back-related injury, when initially treated by a chiropractor versus a medical doctor, is less likely to become temporarily disabled, or if disabled, remains disabled for a shorter period of time; and claimants treated by medical doctors were hospitalized at a much higher rate than claimants treated by chiropractors."<ref>Wolk S. (1988) An analysis of Florida workers' compensation medical claims for back-related injuries. ''J Amer Chir Ass'' 27:50-59</ref> Similarly, a 1991 study of Oregon Workers' Compensation Claims examined 201 randomly selected workers' compensation cases that involved disabling low-back injuries: when individuals with similar injuries were compared, those who visited DCs generally missed fewer days of work than those who visited MDs.<ref>Nyiendo J. (1991) Disability low back Oregon workers' compensation claims. Part II: Time loss. ''J Manip Physiol Ther'' 14:231-239</ref>

A 1989 study analyzed data on Iowa state records from individuals who filed claims for back or neck injuries. The study compared benefits and the cost of care from MDs, DCs and DOs, focusing on individuals who had missed days of work and who had received compensation for their injuries. Individuals who visited DCs missed on average 2.3 fewer days than those who visited MDs, and 3.8 fewer days than those who saw DOs, and accordingly, less money was dispersed as employment compensation on average for individuals who visited DCs.<ref>Johnson M. (1989) A comparison of chiropractic, medical and osteopathic care for work-related sprains/strains. ''J Manip Physiol Ther'' 12:335-344</ref>

In 1989, a survey by Cherkin ''et al.'' concluded that patients receiving care from health maintenance organizations in the state of Washington were three times as likely to report satisfaction with care from DCs as they were with care from other physicians. The patients were also more likely to believe that their chiropractor was concerned about them.<ref>Cherkin CD, MacCornack FA, Berg AO (1988) [http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1026519 Managing low back pain.

==== American Medical Association (AMA) ====

In 1997, the following statement was adopted as policy of the AMA after a report on a number of alternative therapies:[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/13638.html]

Specifically about chiropractic it said,
:"[[joint manipulation|Manipulation]] has been shown to have a reasonably good degree of efficacy in ameliorating back pain, headache, and similar musculoskeletal complaints."
In 1992, the AMA issued this statement:
:"It is ethical for a physician to associate professionally with chiropractors provided that the physician believes that such association is in the best interests of his or her patient. A physician may refer a patient for diagnostic or therapeutic services to a chiropractor permitted by law to furnish such services whenever the physician believes that this may benefit his or her patient. Physicians may also ethically teach in recognized schools of chiropractic. (V, VI)"[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/8332.html]

==== British Medical Association ====

The British Medical Association notes that "There is also no problem with GPs [doctors] referring patients to practitioners in osteopathy and chiropractic who are registered with the relevant statutory regulatory bodies, as a similar means of redress is available to the patient."<ref>British Medical Association, [http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/refcomtherap0406?OpenDocument&Highlight=2,Chiropractic Referrals to complementary therapists]</ref>

== Practice styles and schools of thought ==

Contemporary chiropractic can be divided into several approaches to patient care: all are based on non-invasive, non-medication approaches, with many based on the use of manipulation as a treatment for mechanical musculoskeletal dysfunction of the spine and extremities. Most chiropractors advertise themselves as primary care doctors, and consider themselves part of "alternative health care", but there can be large differences between practitioners.<ref name="Healey">James W. Healey, DC (1990) [http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/08/21/13.html It's Where You Put the Period. ''Dynamic Chiropractic''
October 10, 1990, Volume 08, Issue 21</ref>  The differences between straights and mixers are reflected in multiple national practice associations, but most chiropractors are not members of any national organization.

#'''Traditional Straight''' chiropractors are the oldest movement. They adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by DD and BJ Palmer; that vertebral subluxation leads to interference of the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for almost any disease. Straights adhere to the chiropractic diagnosis of subluxations, and view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the "secondary effects" of subluxations) to be unnecessary for treatment. Instead, patients are typically screened for "red flags" of serious disease, and treated based on a practitioner's preferred chiropractic technique. This stance against medical diagnosing has been a source of contention between mixers and straights, because accreditation standards mandate that differential diagnosis be taught in all chiropractic programs so that patient care is safe and relevant to their complaints. Additionally, several state chiropractic licensing boards mandate that patient complaints be diagnosed before receiving care. The most popular national association for traditional straights is the [[International Chiropractors Association]] (ICA), as well as the [[Federation of Straight Chiropractors and Organizations]] (FSCO) and the [[World Chiropractic Alliance]] (WCA). 
#'''Mixer''' chiropractors are an early offshoot of the straight movement. This branch originated from naturopathic, osteopathic, medical, and even chiropractic doctors who attended the Palmer College of Chiropractic and then re-organized the treatment system to include more diagnostic and treatment approaches. They eventually split from the traditional straight group and formed various other chiropractic schools including the National College of Chiropractic. Their treatments may include naturopathic remedies, physical therapy devices, or other [[Complementary and alternative medicine|CAM methods]]. While still subluxation based, mixers also treat problems associated with both the spine and extremities, including musculoskeletal issues such as pain and decreased range of motion. Mixers describe vertebral subluxations as a form of joint dysfunction or osteoarthritis. Diagnosis is made after ruling out other known disorders and noting general signs of mechanical dysfunction in the spine. They tend to be members of the [[American Academy of Chiropractic Physicians]], the [[American Academy of Spine Physicians]], and/or the [[American Chiropractic Association]] (ACA), and all the major groups in Europe are also in membership of the [[European Chiropractors Union]].<ref name="Souza">Souza T (2005) ''Differential Diagnosis and Management for the Chiropractor, Third Edition : Protocols and Algorithms''  Jones and Bartlett Publishers Inc. 3rd edition</ref> 
#'''Objective Straight''' chiropractors<ref name="F.A.C.E._position_paper1">[http://www.f-a-c-e.com/positionpaper1.htm Position Paper One - What is Objective Straight Chiropractic?]</ref> are a recent off-shoot of the traditional straights and are a minority. This group is differentiated from traditional straights mainly by the claims made. While traditional straights claimed that chiropractic adjustments are a plausible treatment for a wide range of diseases, objective straights only focus on the correction of chiropractic vertebral subluxations. Like traditional straights, objective straights typically do not diagnose patient complaints. Their guiding principles are summed up as: "We do not want to diagnose and treat diseases, even diseases of the spine." and "We do not want chiropractic to be practiced as an alternative to medicine."<ref name="F.A.C.E._3_principles">[http://www.f-a-c-e.com/v3n3.htm F.A.C.E. three guiding principles]</ref> They also don't refer to other professionals, but do encourage their patients "to see a medical physician if they indicate that they want to be treated for the symptoms they are experiencing or if they would like a medical diagnosis to determine the cause of their symptoms".<ref name="F.A.C.E._referral">[http://www.f-a-c-e.com/positionpaper5.htm Position Paper Five - Referral]</ref> Most objective straights limit treatment to spinal adjustments; they tend to be members of the [[Foundation for the Advancement of Chiropractic Education]] (F.A.C.E.), the Federation of Straight Chiropractors and Organizations (FSCO) and the World Chiropractic Alliance (WCA). 
#'''Reform''' chiropractors are a minority group who advocate the use of palpation and [[joint manipulation|manipulation]] to identify and treat [[osteoarthritis]], painful joints, and other musculoskeletal problems. They do not subscribe to the Palmer philosophy of [[Innate Intelligence]] and [[vertebral subluxation]]s, do not believe that spinal joint dysfunction causes organic or systemic disease, and tend not to use [[alternative medicine]] methods. They  prefer to align themselves more with medical and osteopathic physicians in their views of disease causes, processes and responses to manipulative therapy. They tend to be represented by the [[National Association for Chiropractic Medicine]] (NACM).
