In terms of its coverage, the BBC reaches more than 200 countries and is available to more than 274&nbsp;million households, to CNN's (its nearest competitor) estimated 200&nbsp;million; It is therefore also the largest news channel in the world. Its radio services broadcast on a wide variety of wavelengths, making them available to many regions of the world. It also broadcasts news - by radio or over the Internet - in some 33 languages.

The BBC was the first national broadcasting organisation<ref name="historicalbroadcaster">{{cite web |title=BBC History - The BBC takes to the Airwaves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/aboutbbcnews/spl/hi/history/html/default.stm |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> and was founded on 18 October 1922 as the [[British Broadcasting Company|British Broadcasting Company Ltd]]; It was subsequently granted a [[Royal Charter]] and was made a publicly funded corporation in 1927. The corporation produces programmes and information services, broadcasting globally on [[television]], [[radio]], and the [[Internet]]. The stated mission of the BBC is "to inform, educate and entertain" (as laid down by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the [[BBC Charter]]);<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC website: ''About the BBC - Purpose and values'' |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/purpose/ |accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> [[Coat of arms of the BBC|its motto]] is "Nation Shall Speak Peace Unto Nation".

The BBC's domestic programming is primarily funded by levying [[television licence]] fees (under the [[Wireless Telegraphy Act|Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949]]), although money is also raised through commercial activities such as sale of merchandise and programming. The [[BBC World Service]], however, is funded through a [[grant-in-aid]] by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. As part of the BBC Charter, the Corporation cannot show commercial advertising on any services in the United Kingdom (television, radio, or internet). Outside the United Kingdom the BBC broadcasts commercially funded channels such as [[BBC America]], [[BBC Canada]], and [[BBC World News]]. In order to justify the [[licence fee]], the BBC is expected to produce a number of high-rating shows{{Fact|date=October 2007}} in addition to programmes that commercial broadcasters would not normally broadcast.<ref name="charter"/>

Older domestic UK audiences often refer to the BBC as "the Beeb", a nickname originally dubbed by [[Peter Sellers]] in ''[[The Goon Show]]'' in the 1950s, when he referred to the "Beeb Beeb Ceeb". It was then borrowed, shortened and popularised by [[Kenny Everett]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/kenny_everett_page.htm | title = Radio Rewind: Kenny Everett | last = Davies | first= Alan | accessdate= 2007-05-10}}</ref> Another nickname, now less commonly used, is "Auntie", said to originate from the old-fashioned "Auntie knows best" attitude, (but possibly a sly reference to the 'aunties' and 'uncles' who were presenters of children's programmes in early days)<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC Press Release: ''Mark Thompson celebrates the official opening of a new state-of-the art BBC building in Hull'' |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/10_october/21/hull.shtml |date=2004-10-21 |accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> in the days when [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], the BBC's founder, was in charge.

==History==
{{main|Timeline of the BBC}}
{{dablink|For a more detailed early history, see this section of [[British Broadcasting Company#A committee is appointed|The British Broadcasting Company]].}}
[[Image:Bbc logo before 1970.png|thumb|right|The BBC coat of arms]]
The original [[British Broadcasting Company]] was founded in 1922 by a group of [[telecommunications]] companies&mdash;[[Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company|Marconi]], Radio Communication Company, [[Metropolitan-Vickers]], [[The General Electric Company plc|General Electric]], [[Western Electric]], and [[British Thomson-Houston]]<ref> Western Electric was a subsidiary of AT&T and, confusingly, Thomson-Houston in the USA had its roots in the (American) General Electric Co.&mdash;even more confusingly, British Thomson-Houston is sometimes referred to as Hotpoint Electric Appliance Co., which was formed by BTH in 1921&mdash;Burndept Ltd. was later added to the list to represent the interests of smaller electrical manufacturers in the UK {{cite web | url = http://www.btinternet.com/~roger.beckwith/bh/odds/prebh.htm | title = Old Broadcasting Equipment and Memories - BC: Before the Corporation: compiled by Mike Chessher | accessdate = 2007-09-20}}</ref>&mdash;to broadcast experimental radio services. The first transmission was on 14 November of that year, from station 2LO, located at Marconi House, [[London]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/keydates.shtml | title = BBC Press Office: Key BBC Dates | accessdate = 2006-10-28}}</ref>

The Company, with John Reith as general manager, became the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1927 when it was granted a [[Royal Charter]] of incorporation and ceased to be privately owned. To represent its purpose and values, the Corporation adopted the [[Coat of arms of the BBC|coat of arms]], incorporating the motto "Nation shall speak peace unto Nation".<ref name=motto>the motto: "Nation shall speak peace unto Nation" was thought to have been first proposed by [[J C Stobart]] the BBC's first Director of Education.</ref> Experimental television broadcasts were started in 1932 using an electromechanical 30 line system developed by [[John Logie Baird]]. The broadcasts became a regular service (known as the [[BBC Television Service]]) in 1936, alternating between a Baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic [[405 line]] Marconi-EMI system. The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped later that year. Television broadcasting was suspended from 1 September 1939 to 7 June 1946 during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. A widely reported [[urban myth]] is that, upon resumption of service, announcer [[Leslie Mitchell (broadcaster)|Leslie Mitchell]] started by saying, "As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted ..." In fact, the first person to appear when transmission resumed was [[Jasmine Bligh]] and the words said were "Good afternoon, everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh ...?"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff.php | title = Baird: The edit that rewrote history | last = Graham | first = Russ J. | date = 31 October 2005 | accessdate = 2006-08-11}}</ref>

The [[European Broadcasting Union]] was formed on 12 February 1950, in Torquay with the BBC among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations.

Competition to the BBC was introduced in 1955 with the commercially and independently operated television network [[ITV]], however, the BBC monopoly on radio services would persist into the 1970s. As a result of the [[Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting|Pilkington Committee]] report of 1962, in which the BBC was lauded and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming,<ref>{{cite web | title = Committees of Enquiry: Pilkington Committee | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/heritage/more/pdfs/committees_of_enquiry.pdf | pages = p. 4 | date = 1 June 1962| format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-09-30}}</ref> the BBC was awarded a second TV channel, [[BBC Two|BBC2]], in 1964, renaming the existing channel [[BBC1]]. BBC2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across Europe. BBC2 was broadcast in colour from 1 July 1967, and was joined by BBC 1 and ITV on 15 November 1969. The 405 line [[Vhf#United Kingdom|VHF]] transmissions of BBC 1 (and ITV) were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985.

Starting in 1964 a series of [[pirate radio]] stations (starting with [[Radio Caroline]]) came on the air, and forced the British government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally-based advertising-financed services. In response the BBC reorganised and renamed their radio channels.    The Light Programme was split into [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] offering continuous "Popular" music and [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] more "Easy Listening".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/27/bvradio127.xml&page=1 | work = Daily Telegraph | title = The day we woke up to pop music on Radio 1| date = [[2007-09-27]] | author = Imogen Carter | accessdate = 2007-09-30}}</ref>     The "Third" programme became [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] offering classical music and cultural programming.   The Home Service became [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] offering news, and non-musical content such as quiz shows, readings, dramas and plays.   As well as the four national channels, a series of local BBC radio stations was established.<ref>{{cite news | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2939411/ | work = H2G2 | title = The Offshore Radio Revolution in Britain 1964 - 2004| date = [[2004-08-31]] | accessdate = 2007-07-22}}</ref>

In 1974, the BBC's teletext service, [[Ceefax]], was introduced, created initially to provide subtitling, but developed into a news and information service. In 1978 the BBC went on strike just before the Christmas of that year, thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one.<ref>[http://www.meldrum.co.uk/mhp/continuity/guestroom.html The Guestroom for Mr Cock-up]. See bottom of page.</ref><ref>[http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/itw/features/Ratings.html Ratings for 1978]</ref>

Since the [[deregulation]] of the UK television and radio market in the 1980s, the BBC has faced increased competition from the commercial sector (and from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster [[Channel 4]]), especially on [[satellite television]], [[cable television]], and [[digital television]] services.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The [[BBC Research Department]] has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques. In the early days it carried out essential research into acoustics and programme level and noise measurement.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The 2004 [[Hutton Inquiry]] and the subsequent Report raised questions about the BBC's journalistic standards and its impartiality. This led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then Director General, [[Greg Dyke]]. In January 2007, the BBC released minutes of the Board meeting which led to Greg Dyke's resignation. Many commentators have considered the discussions documented in the minutes to have made Dyke's ability to remain in position untenable and tantamount to a dismissal.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Unlike the other departments of the BBC, BBC World Service is funded by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, more commonly known as the Foreign Office or the FCO, is the British government department responsible for promoting the interests of the United Kingdom abroad.

On 18 October 2007, BBC Director General Mark Thompson announced a controversial plan to make major cuts and reduce the size of the BBC as an organisation. The plans include a reduction in posts of 2,500; including 1,800 redundancies, consolidating news operations, reducing programming output by 10% and selling off the flagship [[BBC Television Centre|Television Centre]] building in London.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/10_october/18/reform.shtml|title=Radical reform to deliver a more focused BBC|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=2007-10-18|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>  These plans have been fiercely opposed by unions, who have threatened a series of strikes, however the BBC have stated that the cuts are essential to move the organisation forward and concentrate on increasing the quality of programming.

==Corporation==
===Royal Charter===
The BBC is a quasi-autonomous [[Public company|Public Corporation]] operating as a [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service broadcaster]] incorporated under a Royal Charter that is reviewed every 10&nbsp;years. Until 2007, the Corporation was run by a board of governors appointed by The Queen or King on the advice of [[government of the United Kingdom|the government]] for a term of four years, but on 1 January 2007 the Board of Governors was replaced with the [[BBC Trust]]. The BBC is required by its charter to be free from both political and commercial influence and to answer only to its viewers and listeners.<ref name="charter" />

The most recent Charter came into effect on 1 January 2007.<ref name="charter" /> It has created a number of important changes to the Corporation's management and purpose:

* Abolition of the Board of Governors, and their replacement by the [[BBC Trust]].
* A redefinition of the BBC's "public services" (which are considered its prime function):
**Sustaining citizenship and civil society;
**Promoting education and learning;
**Stimulating creativity and cultural excellence;
**Representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities;
**Bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK;
**Helping to deliver to the public the benefit of emerging communications technologies and services, and taking a leading role in the switchover to digital television.
* The BBC must display at least one of the following characteristics in all content: high quality, originality, innovation, to be challenging and to be engaging.
* The BBC must demonstrate that it provides ''public value'' in all its major activities.

=== Corporate structure ===
* Trust Unit
* Content Groups
** Journalism (incorporates News, Sport, Global News and Nations and Regions)

===Management===
The BBC is a nominally autonomous corporation, independent from direct government intervention, with its activities being overseen by the [[BBC Trust]], formerly the [[Board of Governors of the BBC|Board of Governors]]. General management of the organisation is in the hands of a [[Director-General of the BBC|Director-General]], who is appointed by the Trust.

====BBC Trust====
{{main|BBC Trust}}

The BBC Trust came into effect on 1 January 2007, replacing the Board of Governors.

<blockquote>"''The BBC Trust works on behalf of licence fee payers: it ensures the BBC provides high quality output and good value for all UK citizens and it protects the independence of the BBC.''" – BBC Trust<ref>{{cite web | title = BBC Trust | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/ | accessdate = 2007-01-21}}</ref></blockquote>
The Trust sets the overall strategic direction for the corporation and assesses the performance of the BBC Executive Board. The Trust has twelve trustees, currently:<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC Trust |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/about/bbc_trust_members/index.html |accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref>

===Revenue===
{{update}}
{{see also|Television licence|Television licensing in the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:BBC income 2004 in GBP Redvers.png|right|325px]]

The principal means of funding the BBC is through the television licence, costing £139.50 per year per household (as of May 2008). Such a licence is required to operate a broadcast [[television]] receiver within the UK. The cost of a television licence is set by the government and enforced by the criminal law. A discount is available for households with only black-and-white television sets.   The revenue is collected privately and is paid into the central government [[Consolidated Fund]], a process defined in the [[Communications Act 2003]]. This ''TV Licensing'' collection is  currently carried out by Capita, an outside agency. Funds are then allocated by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Treasury and approved by Parliament via legislation. Additional revenues are paid by the Department for Work and Pensions to compensate for subsidised licences for eligible over-75 year olds.

Income from commercial enterprises and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes has substantially increased over recent years,<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Report and Accounts 2004-2005 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/finance/annual_accounts/Annual_Accounts_2004-2005.pdf | author = BBC | format = PDF | pages = p. 94 | accessdate= 2006-07-06}}</ref> with [[BBC Worldwide]] contributing some £145&nbsp;million to the BBC's core public service business.

According to the BBC's 2005–2006 Annual Report,<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Report and Accounts 2005-2006 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/annual_reports_and_reviews/annual_report_and_accounts/BBC_Annual_Report_2005_06.pdf | author = BBC | format = PDF | pages = pp. 103–104 | accessdate = 2007-01-21}}</ref> its income can be broken down as follows: 

* £3,100.6 million (£3.1bn) in licence fees collected from householders.
* £620.0M from BBC Commercial Businesses.
* £260.2M from the World Service, of which £239.1&nbsp;m is from grants (primarily funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office), £15.8&nbsp;m from subscriptions, and £5.3M from other sources.
* £24.2M from other income, such as providing content to overseas broadcasters and concert ticket sales.

The licence fee has, however, attracted criticism. It has been argued that in an age of multi stream, multi-channel availability, an obligation to pay a licence fee is no longer appropriate. The BBC's use of private sector company [[Capita Group]] to send letters to premises not paying the licence fee has been criticised, especially as there have been cases where such letters have been sent to premises which are up to date with their payments, or do not require a TV licence.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/09/22/ftlicence22.xml | title = Why am I being hounded like this? | publisher = [[Telegraph]] | date = [[22nd Sept]] 2006 | accessdate = 2008-02-06}}</ref> The BBC uses an advertising campaign to inform customers of the requirement to pay the licence fee. These letters and adverts have been criticised by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs [[Boris Johnson]] and [[Ann Widdecombe]], for having a threatening nature and language used to scare evaders into paying.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2005/05/26/do2602.xml | title = I won't pay to be abused by the BBC | publisher = [[Telegraph]] | date =  26 May 2005 | accessdate = 2008-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/24455/BBC-bullies-shame-in-licence-fee-chaos | title = BBC BULLIES' SHAME IN LICENCE FEE CHAOS | publisher = [[Daily Express]] | date =  7 November 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-06}}</ref> Audio clips and television broadcasts are used to inform listeners of the BBC's comprehensive database.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/index.jsp | title = TV Licensing | publisher = [[TV Licensing]] | date =  2 June 2008 | accessdate = 2008-02-06}}</ref> There are a number of pressure groups campaigning on the issue of the licence fee.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.spiderbomb.com/tv/ | title = Example of Licence Fee pressure group | publisher = [[Campaign to Abolish the Licence Fee]] | date =  2 June 2008 | accessdate = 2008-02-06}}</ref>

{{main|Broadcasting House}}

Broadcasting House in [[Portland Place]], [[Central London|London]], England, UK is the official headquarters of the BBC. It is home to three of the ten BBC national radio networks. They are [[BBC Radio 3]], [[BBC Radio 4]], and [[BBC 7]]. On the front of the building are statues of [[Prospero]] and [[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]] (from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'') sculpted by [[Eric Gill]].

Renovation of Broadcasting House began in 2002 and is scheduled for completion in 2010. As part of a major reorganisation of BBC property, Broadcasting House is to become home to [[BBC News]] (both television and radio), national radio, and the [[BBC World Service]]. The major part of this plan involves the demolition of the two post-war extensions to the building and construction of a new building<ref>{{cite web | title = New Broadcasting House | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/index.shtml | author = BBC | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref> beside the existing structure. During the rebuilding process many of the BBC Radio networks have been relocated to other buildings in the vicinity of Portland Place.

In 2010, the entire BBC News operation is expected to relocate from the News Centre at [[BBC Television Centre]] to the refurbished Broadcasting House in what is being described as "one of the world's largest live broadcast centres".<ref>{{cite web | title = New Broadcasting House - The future | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/thefuture/bh_project.shtml | author = BBC | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref>

By far the largest concentration of BBC staff in the UK exists in [[White City, London|White City]]. Well-known buildings in this area include the [[BBC Television Centre]], White City, Media Centre, Broadcast Centre and Centre House.

As well as the various BBC buildings in London, there are major BBC production centres located in [[Cardiff]], [[Belfast]], [[Glasgow]], [[Birmingham]], [[Leeds]], [[Manchester]], [[Bristol]], [[Southampton]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Some of these local centres are [[Broadcasting House (disambiguation)|also known as "Broadcasting House"]]. There are also many smaller local and regional studios scattered throughout the UK.

In 2011, the BBC is planning to move several departments including [[BBC Sport]] and [[BBC Children's]] north to newly built premises in [[Salford Quays]], [[Greater Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web | title = BBC Salford move gets green light | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6708383.stm | author = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 31 May 2007 | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}</ref> This will mark a major decentralisation of the corporation's operations from London.

==Services==
===Television===
{{main|BBC Television}}
[[Image:BBCBirmingham.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The back of the BBC [[Birmingham]] headquarters in [[The Mailbox]].]]
[[Image:07 CB.JPG|thumb|[[BBC Scotland]]'s and [[BBC Alba]]'s HQ in Glasgow.]]
[[Image:BBC Yorkshire.jpg|thumb|150px|[[BBC Yorkshire]] headquarters in [[Leeds]].]]
[[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] are the BBC's flagship television channels. The BBC is also promoting the new channels [[BBC Three]] and [[BBC Four]], which are only available via [[digital television]] equipment (now in widespread use in the UK, with analogue transmission being phased out by December 2012<ref>{{cite web | title = BBC News Report | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6453087.stm | date = 15 March 2007 | accessdate = 2007-03-15}}</ref>). The BBC also runs the BBC News channel, [[BBC Parliament]], and two children's channels, [[CBBC Channel|CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]], on digital.

BBC One is a regionalised TV service which provides opt-outs throughout the day for local news and other local programming. These variations are more pronounced in the BBC 'Nations', i.e. [[BBC Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]], [[BBC Scotland|Scotland]] and [[BBC Wales|Wales]], where the presentation is mostly carried out locally on BBC One and Two. BBC Two variations within England are currently rare, though most regions still have the ability to 'opt out' of the main feed, albeit on analogue only. BBC Two was also the first channel to be transmitted on 625 lines in 1964, then carry a small-scale regular colour service from 1967. BBC One would follow in December 1969.

A new [[Scottish Gaelic]] television channel, [[BBC Alba (TV channel)|BBC Alba]], was launched in September 2008. It is also the first multi-genre channel to come entirely from Scotland with almost all of its programmes made in Scotland. The service is currently only available via [[Satellite television|satellite]] and [[cable television]].

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the BBC channels are available in a number of ways. All multichannel platforms carry them, although many viewers also receive BBC services via 'overspill' from transmitters in Northern Ireland or Wales, or via 'deflectors' - transmitters in the Republic which rebroadcast broadcasts from the UK, received off-air, or from Digital Satellite.

From 9 June 2006, the BBC began a 6-12&nbsp;month trial of [[High-definition television]] broadcasts under the name [[BBC HD]]. The corporation has been producing programmes in the format for many years, and states that it hopes to produce 100% of new programmes in HDTV by 2010.<ref>{{cite web | title = BBC Press Release: ''BBC to trial High Definition broadcasts in 2006'' | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/11_november/08/hdtv.shtml | date = 8 November 2005 | accessdate= 2006-07-07}}</ref>

Since 1975, the BBC has also provided its TV programmes to the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]] (BFBS), allowing members of [[Military of the United Kingdom|HM Forces]] serving all over the world to watch and listen to their favourite programmes from home on two dedicated TV channels.

In 2008, the BBC began experimenting with live streaming of certain channels in the UK, and in November 2008, all standard BBC television channels were made available to watch online.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/11_november/19/simulcast.shtml BBC One and BBC Two to be simulcast from 27 November]</ref>

===Radio===
{{further|[[BBC Radio]], [[BBC Local Radio]]}}
The BBC has five major national stations:
*[[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] ("the best new music and entertainment")
*[[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] (the UK's most listened to radio station, with 12.9&nbsp;million weekly listeners<ref>{{cite web | title = Quarterly Summary of Radio Listening - Quarter 1 2006 - National Stations | url = http://www.rajar.co.uk/quarterlysummary/qstsvfiles/135/Q12006National.pdf | author = RAJAR | authorlink = RAJAR | format = PDF | date = 11 May 2006 | accessdate= 2006-07-06}}</ref>)
*[[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] (specialist-interest music such as classical, world, arts, drama and jazz)
*[[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] (current affairs, factual, drama and comedy)
*[[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]] (24&nbsp;hour news, sports and talk)

In recent years some further national stations have been introduced on [[Digital radio in the United Kingdom|digital radio platforms]] including [[BBC Five Live Sports Extra|Five Live Sports Extra]] (a companion to Five Live for additional events coverage), [[BBC 1Xtra|1Xtra]] (for black, urban and gospel music), [[BBC 6 Music|6 Music]] (less [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]] genres of music), BBC 7 (comedy, drama & children's programming) and [[BBC Asian Network]] ([[British Asian|British South Asian]] talk, music and news in English and in many South Asian languages), a station which had evolved from BBC Local Radio origins in the 1970s and still is broadcast on Medium Wave frequencies in some parts of England. In addition the BBC World Service is now also broadcast nationally in the UK on DAB.

There is also a network of [[BBC Local Radio|local stations]] with a mixture of talk, news and music in England and the [[Channel Islands]] as well as national stations (Nations' radio) of [[BBC Radio Wales]], [[BBC Radio Cymru]] (in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), [[BBC Radio Scotland]], [[BBC Radio nan Gaidheal]] (in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scots Gaelic]]), [[BBC Radio Ulster]], and [[BBC Radio Foyle]].

For a worldwide audience, the BBC produces the [[BBC World Service]] funded by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]], which is broadcast worldwide on [[shortwave]] radio, and on DAB Digital Radio in the UK. The World Service is a major source of news and information programming and can be received in 150 capital cities worldwide, with a weekly audience estimate of 163&nbsp;million listeners worldwide. The Service currently broadcasts in 33 languages and dialects (including English), though not all languages are broadcast in all areas.<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Review 2005-2006: A year in brief | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/us/annual_review/2005/year_in_brief.shtml | author = BBC World Service | authorlink = BBC World Service | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-01-21}}</ref>

In 2005, the BBC announced that it would substantially reduce its radio broadcasting in [[Thai language]] (closed in 2006)<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Thai service ends broadcasts| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4609860.stm | author = Clare Harkey | date = 13 March 2006 | accessdate = 2008-11-08}} </ref> and [[Eastern Europe]]an languages and divert resources instead to a new [[Arabic language]] satellite TV broadcasting station (including radio and online content) in the [[Middle East]] to be launched in 2007.<ref>{{cite web | title = BBC Arabic TV appoints former Al Jazeera employee as news editor | url = http://www.metimes.com/articles/normal.php?StoryID=20060315-071402-4650r | author = Middle East Times | authorlink = Middle East Times | date = 15 March 2006 | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref>

Since 1943, the BBC has also provided radio programming to the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]], which broadcasts in countries where British troops are stationed.

All of the national, local, and regional BBC radio stations, as well as the BBC World Service, are available over the [[Internet]] in the [[RealAudio]] [[Streaming media|streaming]] format. In April 2005, the BBC began trials offering a limited number of radio programmes as [[podcast]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/04_april/14/pod.shtml | title = BBC Press Release: ''BBC to podcast up to 20 more programmes including Today and Radio 1 speech highlights'' | date = 14 April 2005 | accessdate= 2006-07-13}}</ref>

Historically, the BBC was the only (legal) radio broadcaster based in the UK mainland until 1967, when [[URY|University Radio York (URY)]], then under the name ''Radio York'', was launched as the first (and now oldest) legal independent radio station in the country. However, the BBC did not enjoy a complete monopoly before this as several Continental stations (such as [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]]) broadcast programmes in English to Britain since the 1930s and the Isle of Man based [[Manx Radio]] began in 1964.

===News===

{{main|BBC News}}
BBC News is the largest broadcast news gathering operation in the world,<ref>{{cite web | title = Key Facts - BBC News and Current Affairs | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/news.shtml |month=October | year=2006 | author = BBC Press Office | accessdate = 2007-01-21}}</ref> providing services to BBC domestic radio as well as television networks such as the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]], [[BBC Parliament]] and [[BBC World News]], as well as [[BBC Red Button]], [[Ceefax]] and [[BBC News Online]]. New BBC News services that are also proving popular are mobile services to mobile phones and PDAs. Desktop news alerts, e-mail alerts, and digital TV alerts are also available.

Ratings figures suggest that during major crises such as the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] or a royal funeral, the UK audience overwhelmingly turns to the BBC's coverage as opposed to its commercial rivals.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Cozens | first = Claire  | title = BBC news ratings double | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = 8 July 2005 | url = http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,1524235,00.html | accessdate = 2006-12-25 }}</ref>
On 7 July 2005, the day that there were a series of coordinated bomb blasts on London's public transport system, the [[BBC Online]] website recorded an all time [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] peak of 11&nbsp;[[gigabit|Gb]]/s at 12:00 on 7 July. BBC News received some 1&nbsp;billion total hits on the day of the event (including all images, text and [[HTML]]), serving some 5.5 [[terabyte]]s of data. At peak times during the day there were 40,000 page requests per second for the BBC News website. The previous day's announcement of the [[2012 Olympics]] being awarded to London caused a peak of around 5&nbsp;Gbit/s. The previous all time high at [[BBC Online]] was caused by the announcement of the [[Michael Jackson]] verdict, which used 7.2&nbsp;Gbit/s.<ref>{{cite web | title = Statistics on BBC Webservers 7 July 2005 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/feedback/07July_Statistics.shtml | author = BBC | accessdate = 2006-11-13}}</ref>

====Allegations of bias====
BBC News forms a major department of the BBC, and as such is constantly facing allegations of holding a left-wing, right-wing or liberal bias. The [[Centre for Policy Studies]] say that, "Since at least the mid-1980s, the BBC has often been criticised for a perceived
bias against those on the centre-right of politics."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cps.org.uk/cpsfile.asp?id=521 | title = BBC Bias?

The [[Respect – The Unity Coalition|RESPECT]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[George Galloway]] has referred to it as the "Bush and Blair Corporation".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://info.edgehill.ac.uk/ehu_news/storyarch.asp?storyid=633 | title = George Galloway Attacks 'Blair's Bloody Legacy' | author = Edge Hill University | date = 12 April 2006 | accessdate = 2007-10-23}}</ref>

Criticism of the BBC's middle east coverage from both sides, including allegations of anti-Israeli bias, led the BBC to commission an investigation and report from a senior BBC editorial adviser [[Malcolm Balen]], referred to as [[the Balen Report]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/apr/27/israel.middleeastthemedia BBC wins court battle over Balen report | Media | MediaGuardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Attempts to force the BBC to release the report under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] were unsuccessful after the courts upheld the BBC's argument that the report fell outside of the Act's scope as it was conducted for journalistic purposes. This led to speculation that the report was damning, as well as to accusations of hypocrisy as the BBC frequently made use itself of Freedom of Information Act requests when researching news stories.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-444074/BBC-pays-200-000-cover-report-anti-Israel-bias.html BBC pays £200,000 to 'cover up report on anti-Israel bias' | Mail Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The BBC did make public the findings of an "independent panel report" written in 2006, that said that while there was "no deliberate or systematic bias" in the BBC's reporting of the middle east, their coverage had been "inconsistent," "not always providing a complete picture" and "misleading".<ref name="autogenerated1" /> It suggested that in fact BBC coverage implicitly favoured the Israeli side.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/bbc-bids-to-suppress-study-on-middle-east-bias-774282.html BBC bids to suppress study on Middle East 'bias' - Media, News - The Independent<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Former BBC middle east correspondent [[Tim Llewellyn]] wrote in 2004 that the BBC's coverage allowed an Israeli view of the conflict to dominate, as demonstrated by research conducted by the [[Glasgow Media Group]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/jun/20/israel.broadcasting Tim Llewellyn: The story TV news won't tell | Media | The Observer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

A new version of the BBC website was launched in December 2007, with the new site enabling the user to customise the BBC's internet services to their own needs. This, on 28 February 2008, was made permanent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2007/12/a_lick_of_paint_for_the_bbc_ho.html|title=A lick of paint for the BBC homepage|author=Richard Titus|publisher=[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet BBC Internet Blog]|date=2007-12-13|accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref>

The website allows the BBC to produce sections which complement the various programmes on television and radio, and it is common for viewers and listeners to be told [[Uniform Resource Locator|website addresses]] for the bbc.co.uk sections relating to that programme. The site also allows users to listen to most Radio output live and for seven days after broadcast using its [[RealPlayer]]-based "Radio Player"; some TV content is also distributed in [[RealVideo]] format. A new system known as [[BBC iPlayer|iPlayer]] was launched on 27 July 2007, which uses [[peer-to-peer]] and [[Digital rights management|DRM]] technology to deliver both radio and TV content of the last seven days for offline use for up to 30&nbsp;days. Also, through participation in the [[Creative Archive Licence]] group, bbc.co.uk allowed legal downloads of selected archive material via the internet.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/01_january/03/archive.shtml | title = BBC Press Release: ''BBC News opens its archives for the first time'' | date = 3 January 2006 | accessdate= 2006-10-03}}</ref> As of February 2008 the BBC has also offered television programmes for download on [[Apple iTunes]] under the studio title "BBC Worldwide".

Initial content was made available in January 2006 however BBC jam was suspended on 20 March 2007 due to allegations made to the [[European Commission]] that it was damaging the interests of the commercial sector of the industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/14_03_2007.html|title=BBC Trust suspends BBC Jam|publisher=[[BBC Trust]]|date=2007-03-14|accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref>

In recent years some major on-line companies and politicians have complained that the bbc.co.uk website receives too much funding from the television licence, meaning that other websites are unable to compete with the vast amount of advertising-free on-line content available on bbc.co.uk.<ref>{{cite web | title = Department of Culture, Media and Sport: Independent Review of BBC Online, pp41-58 | url = http://www.culture.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/45F9953F-CE61-4325-BEA6-400DF9722494/0/BBCOnlinereview.pdf | last = Graf | first = Philip | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref> Some have proposed that the amount of licence fee money spent on bbc.co.uk should be reduced&mdash;either being replaced with funding from advertisements or subscriptions, or a reduction in the amount of content available on the site.<ref>{{cite web | author = British Internet Publishers Alliance | title = BIPA Response to Review of the BBC’s Royal Charter | url = http://www.bipa.co.uk/getArticle.php?ID=325 | date = 31 May 2005 | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref> In response to this the BBC carried out an investigation, and has now set in motion a plan to change the way it provides its online services. bbc.co.uk will now attempt to fill in gaps in the market, and will guide users to other websites for currently existing market provision. (For example, instead of providing local events information and timetables, users will be guided to outside websites already providing that information.)
Part of this plan included the BBC closing some of its websites, and rediverting money to redevelop other parts.<ref>{{cite news | title = Public value key to BBC websites | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3992875.stm | date = 8 November 2004 | accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1219009.ece|title=99 per cent of the BBC archives is on the shelves.

===Interactive television===
{{main|BBC Red Button}}
BBC Red Button is the brand name for the BBC's [[Interactive television|interactive]] [[digital television]] services, which are available through [[Freeview (United Kingdom)|Freeview]] (digital terrestrial), as well as [[Sky Digital (UK & Ireland)|Sky Digital]] (satellite), and [[Virgin Media]] (cable). Unlike [[Ceefax]], BBC Red Button is able to display full-colour graphics, photographs, and video, as well as programmes. Recent examples include the interactive sports coverage for [[Association football|football]] and [[rugby football]] matches and the [[2008 Olympic Games]], [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415069/ BBC Soundbites] which starred young actress [[Jennifer Lynn]] and an interactive national IQ test, [[Test the Nation]]. All of the BBC's digital television stations, (and radio stations on [[Freeview (United Kingdom)|Freeview]]), allow access to the BBC Red Button service.

As well as the 24/7 service, BBC Red Button provides viewers with over 100 interactive TV programmes every year, including news and weather.<ref>{{cite web | title=BBC Press Office: BBCi Key Facts | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/bbci.shtml | accessdate= 2006-07-06}}</ref>

===Commercial services===
[[BBC Worldwide]] Limited is the wholly-owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC responsible for the commercial exploitation of BBC programmes and other properties, including a number of television stations throughout the world. The cable and satellite stations [[BBC Prime]] (in Europe, Africa the [[Middle East]], and Asia), BBC America, BBC Canada (alongside [[BBC Kids]]), broadcast popular BBC programmes to people outside the UK, as does [[UK.TV]] (co-run with [[Foxtel]] and Fremantle Media) in [[Australasia]]. A similar service, [[BBC Japan]], ceased broadcasts in April 2006 after its Japanese distributor folded.<ref>{{cite web | title=BBC Japan website | url=http://www.bbcjapan.tv/news.aspx?menu=news|accessdate= 2006-07-06}}</ref>  BBC Worldwide also runs a 24-hour news channel, [[BBC World News]] and co-runs, with [[Virgin Media]], the [[UKTV]] network of stations in the UK, producers of amongst others [[UKTV Gold]]. In addition, BBC television news appears nightly on many [[Public Broadcasting Service]] stations in the United States, as do reruns of BBC programmes such as ''[[EastEnders]]'', and in New Zealand on [[TV ONE|TV One]].

Many BBC programmes (especially [[Documentary film|documentaries]]) are sold via BBC Worldwide to foreign television stations, and [[comedy]], [[documentary film|documentaries]] and [[Costume drama|historical drama]] productions are popular on the international DVD market.<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Review 2006 | url = http://www.bbcworldwide.com/annualreviews/review2006/BBCWWAnnual%20Review2006.pdf | author = BBC Worldwide | authorlink = BBC Worldwide | format = PDF | accessdate= 2006-07-06}}</ref> 

BBC Worldwide also maintains the publishing arm of the BBC and it is the third-largest publisher of consumer magazines in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Review 2001 | url = http://www.bbcworldwide.com/annualreviews/review2001/magazines2.html | author = BBC Worldwide | authorlink = BBC Worldwide | accessdate = 2006-07-14}}</ref> [[BBC Magazines]], formerly known as BBC Publications, publishes the ''[[Radio Times]]'' (and published the now-defunct ''[[The Listener]]'') as well as a number of magazines that support BBC programming such as ''[[Top Gear (magazine)|BBC Top Gear]]'', ''[[BBC Good Food]]'', ''[[The Sky at Night|BBC Sky at Night]]'', ''[[BBC History (magazine)|BBC History]]'', ''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' and ''[[BBC Music]]''.

BBC Worldwide also produces several branded channels available on satellite in Asia and India, including BBC Lifestyle, BBC Knowledge and BBC Entertainment. In December 2007, a polish version of BBC Entertainment launched.

The BBC has traditionally played a major role in producing book and music tie-ins with its broadcast material. [[BBC Records]] produced soundtrack albums, talking books and material from radio broadcasts of music.

Between 2004 and 2006, BBC Worldwide owned the independent magazine publisher Origin Publishing.<ref>{{cite web | title=Origin Publishing | url=http://www.originpublishing.co.uk/ | accessdate= 2006-12-31}}</ref>

BBC Worldwide also licences and directly sells [[DVD]] and audio recordings of popular programmes to the public, most notably ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (including books and merchandise), and archive [[classical music]] recordings, initially as ''BBC Radio Classics'' and then ''BBC Legends''.

===Music===
The BBC runs a number of orchestras and choirs, including the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]], the [[BBC Philharmonic]], the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], the [[BBC Television Orchestra]] (1936-1939), the [[BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra]], the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]], [[BBC Big Band]], the [[BBC Singers]] and the [[BBC Symphony Chorus]].
===Miscellaneous===
The BBC and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office jointly run [[BBC Monitoring]], which monitors radio, television, the press and the internet worldwide.

In the 1980s, the BBC developed several PCs, most notably the [[BBC Micro]].

==Unions==
Union membership is a private matter between staff and their chosen union: staff are not automatically covered by a union, but since the BBC is a large employer (in the media sector), membership numbers are considerable.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Staff at the BBC are normally represented by [[BECTU]], along with journalistic staff by the [[National Union of Journalists|NUJ]] and electrical staff by [[Amicus]]. Union membership is optional, and paid for by staff members and not by the BBC.

==Cultural significance==
The BBC was the only television broadcaster in the United Kingdom until 1955 and the only legal radio broadcaster until 1968 (when [[URY]] obtained their first licence<ref>{{cite_web|url=http://ury.york.ac.uk/about.php|title=URY History|accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref>). Its cultural impact was therefore significant since the country had no choice for its information and entertainment from these two powerful media.

Even after the advent of commercial television and radio, the BBC has remained one of the main elements in British popular culture through its obligation to produce TV and radio programmes for mass audiences. However, the arrival of BBC2 allowed the BBC also to make programmes for minority interests in drama, documentaries, current affairs, entertainment and sport. Examples are cited such as ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]'', ''[[Civilisation (TV programme)|Civilisation]]'', ''[[Tonight (1957 TV series)|Tonight]]'', ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Pot Black]]'', but many other ground-breaking examples can be given in each of these fields as shown by the BBC's entries in the [[British Film Institute]]'s 2000 list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]].<ref name="tv100">{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php|title=The BFI TV 100: 1-100|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|year=2000|accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> Quite possibly the most critically acclaimed Documentaries in TV history have been produced by the BBC at the very beginning of the 21st Century, Blue Planet and Planet Earth received awards worldwide are considered to be the finest examples around of capturing nature in the wild. Indeed Planet Earth is to this day the biggest selling Blu-Ray High Definition title around the world. In radio the BBC has also maintained a high standard of news, drama, entertainment, documentaries, sport and music for all tastes, and still draws large audiences, while also serving minority tastes.
{{quote box|align=right|size=100px|quote="Making the good popular and the popular good has<br> been a core purpose of the BBC since its foundation."<center>|source=[[Huw Wheldon]]}}

The BBC's objective of providing a service to the public, rather than just entertainment, has changed the public's perception in a wide range of subjects from health to natural history.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} By maintaining a high standard{{Fact|date=February 2007}} the BBC also defined a quality threshold that the commercial companies had to reach to retain their licences, but the advent of the multi-channel age is lessening this effect.{{POV-statement|date=January 2008}}The export of BBC programmes, the [[BBC World Service]] and [[BBC World]] have meant that the cultural impact of the BBC has been also experienced worldwide.

Although the BBC has changed society, the society has also changed the BBC. The term [[BBC English]] (Received Pronunciation) refers to the former use of [[Standard English]] with this accent. However, the organisation now makes more use of [[Regional accents of English speakers|regional accents]] in order to reflect the diversity of the UK, though clarity and fluency are still expected of presenters. From its 'starchy' beginnings, the BBC has also become more inclusive{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, and now attempts to accommodate the interests of all strata of society and all minorities, because they all pay the licence fee.{{fact|date=June 2008}}

Competition from [[ITV|Independent Television]], [[Channel 4]], [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky]] and other broadcast television stations, has slightly lessened the BBC's reach, but nevertheless it remains a major influence on British popular culture. Many popular everyday sayings are derived from BBC-produced television shows.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
