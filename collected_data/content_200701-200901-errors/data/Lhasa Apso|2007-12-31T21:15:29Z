The '''Lhasa Apso''' is a hunting, non-sporting dog breed originating from Tibet. It was bred originally to guard monasteries. The Lhasa Apso was expected to follow the intruder barking until his master arrived to check on the intruder.

==Appearance==
According to the [[American Kennel Club]], Lhasa Apsos should measure about 10 to 11 inches at the [[withers]]. Males should weigh between 14 and 18 pounds, and females should weigh between 12 and 14 pounds. The forelegs should be straight, and the hindquarters should be well-developed and muscular. The breed standard requires dark brown eyes of medium size and a coal-black nose. Lhasa Apsos are similar in appearance to the [[Shih tzu]] dog but their personalities and temperament are very different. Shih Tzus were bred as companion dogs while the Lhasa was bred as a watchdog.

The dog has a coat that is double layered, which to show standards should drape over the entire body and the eyes. A Lhasa's coat should be of good length.  All colors are equally acceptable, with or without dark tips to ears and beard. The tail should be carried in a tight screw over the back. The AKC [[breed standard]] was approved [[July 11]], [[1978]].<ref>[http://www.akc.org/breeds/lhasa_apso/index.cfm  American Kennel Club - Lhasa Apso]</ref>

Lhasa Apsos typically live between 12-15 years, though some live as long as 18 years.

==Temperament==
Lhasa Apsos were originally bred in tibet as a watch dog.  They are, therefore suspicious of strangers.<ref>[http://www.lhasaapso.org/FAQ/FAQ.html The American Lhasa Apso Club, Frequently Asked Questions]</ref> Successful training requires the owner to establish dominance and ensure consistence in discipline.<ref>[http://www.lhasaapso.org/FAQ/FAQ.html The American Lhasa Apso Club, Frequently Asked Questions]</ref><ref>[http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/lhasaapso.htm Dog Breed Info Centre]</ref>  Lhasas require 20-30 minutes of daily exercise.<ref>[http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/lhasaapso.htm Dog Breed Info Centre]</ref> 

There is debate on whether or not Lhasa's interact well with children.   [http://www.lhasaapso.org/ The American Lhasa Apso Club] recommends caution and constant adult supervision while the [http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/lhasaapso.htm Dog Breed Info Centre] indicates the dogs do not interact well with children who are rough or badly behaved.
