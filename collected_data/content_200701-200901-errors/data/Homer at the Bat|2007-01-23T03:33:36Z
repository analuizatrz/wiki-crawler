"'''Homer at the Bat'''" is the seventeenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[List of The Simpsons episodes#Season 3 (1991-1992)|third season]]. The episode involves Homer's boss, [[Mr. Burns]], trying to guarantee victory in a [[softball]] game between the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] and the Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant by signing several [[Major League Baseball]] players. Things do not go as planned.

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}
The Springfield Nuclear Power Plant softball team has gone through their season undefeated, and in the championship game, they will face the Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant. Homer is the team's leading hitter, thanks to his homemade bat (a takeoff of the plot of the film ''[[The Natural]]'').

Mr. Burns makes a million dollar bet with [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#Aristotle Amadopolis|Aristotle Amadopolis]], owner of the Shelbyville plant, that his team will win. To secure victory in the game, Mr. Burns wants to hire major league stars, but Smithers tells Mr. Burns that the players he picked are all dead (mostly from the 1920s-1930s).  Thus Mr. Burns orders Smithers to find some current superstar players and hires several [[Major League Baseball]] players to work at the plant ([[Roger Clemens]], [[Wade Boggs]], [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]], [[Steve Sax]], [[Ozzie Smith]], [[José Canseco]], [[Don Mattingly]], [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Mike Scioscia]]) and to play on the team, much to the dismay of the plant workers who got the team to the championship game in the first place.

However, the night before the game, all the players but Strawberry have different incidents that don't allow them to play. Because of this, Mr. Burns must use actual employees, but keeps Homer on the bench because Strawberry plays his position. Homer does get in, though, with the score tied and bases loaded in the 9th inning, when Burns wants a [[Platoon system|right-handed hitter against a left-handed pitcher]]. The very first pitch [[hit by pitch|hits Homer]] [[beanball|in the head]], rendering him unconscious and forcing in the winning run. Homer is then paraded as a hero, still unconscious.

During the credits, [[Terry Cashman]], who wrote the song "[[Talkin' Baseball]]", sings a take on his hit with "Talkin' Softball".

== Trivia ==
* José Canseco was originally slated to wake up in bed with [[Edna Krabappel]] and miss the game, but Canseco's then-wife, Esther Haddad, objected.
** Because of the change, [[Marcia Wallace]] was listed in the credits, even though Mrs. Krabappel didn't appear at all in the episode.
* The players in this episode were an extremely talented group. They combined for 77 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star]] selections, 34 [[Gold Glove]]s, 7 [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]]s, and 4 league [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] awards. They also won a combined 12 [[World Series]]. 
* Smith and Boggs are presently the only members of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] from this group, although several players are not yet eligible for election.
* In the DVD commentaries, Al Jean hints that 8 of the baseball players were really nice guys, except for one guy whose name rhymes with "Manseco". He later says that Canseco had a hard time saying his lines and was really difficult every time he was told to do a retake. As well, he insisted that his original part be rewritten, so he was written as a hero.
* As of December [[2006]], Ken Griffey, Jr. and Roger Clemens are the only remaining active players (Mike Scioscia manages the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], José Canseco plays for the [[Long Beach Armada]] in the [[Independent baseball|Independent]] [[Golden Baseball League]], and Don Mattingly serves as the New York Yankees bench coach).
* This episode marks the second time in the series that someone mentions the phrase "It's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited!" Ken Griffey Jr. says it after trying Mr. Burns's nerve tonic. The first being [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]]'s exclamation upon sampling the episode's titular beverage in the season 3 episode "[[Flaming Moe's]]". This line was parodied in "[[Parasites Lost]]", a season 3 episode of ''[[Futurama]]'', another cartoon created by [[Matt Groening]], when [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] eats a very expired egg salad sandwich and exclaims "It's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!" Griffey had trouble performing the line, a number of outtakes of which are presented as a hidden feature on the [[The Simpsons DVDs#The Complete Third Season|Season 3 DVD set]].
* At the time, only Steve Sax and Don Mattingly had played for the [[New York Yankees]]. Four of the other ringers would later play for the Yankees (Boggs, Clemens, Canseco, and Strawberry).
* Although the episode said the team was a softball team, it was actually a [[baseball]] team as the pitcher pitched the ball overhand and the games were nine innings long (where as in softball, the ball is pitched underhand and in an arc and games are usually seven innings long). Also, Mr. Burns used [[Major League Baseball]] players to play the games.
* Several of the players in this episode are purposely given distinctly different personalities than what they are known for. Darryl Strawberry, well known for being self-serving and hard to deal with is depicted as an ass kissing coach's dream. Jose Canseco, known for his self-promotion and grandiosity is shown as a hero who rescues everything a woman owns from a fire.

==Cultural References==
* The episode makes several allusions to ''[[The Natural]]'', a movie starring [[Robert Redford]] and which is based upon [[Bernard Malamud]]'s book by the same name. Homer's secret weapon, his self-created "Wonderbat", is akin to Roy Hobbs's "Wonderboy". Both bats are eventually destroyed. The scene featuring the explosion of stadium lights as Homer circles the basepaths is taken directly from the film, as is the scene with the team and the [[hypnosis|hypnotist]].
* The end song "Talkin' Softball" was actually re-written from an older song "Talkin' Baseball" by [[Terry Cashman]], singer/writer of the song. Cashman has rewritten his lyrics several times for particular teams.
* The episode title is a play on the [[Ernest Thayer|Ernest Lawrence Thayer]] poem "[[Casey at the Bat]]".

== The team and why they didn't play ==
'''Batting order:'''

* [[Second baseman|2B]]: [[Steve Sax]] ([[New York Yankees]]): Arrested and sentenced to serve six consecutive lifetime in prison for every unsolved [[murder]] in [[New York City]].
* [[Third baseman|3B]]: [[Wade Boggs]] ([[Boston Red Sox]]): Punched out in a bar fight by [[Barney Gumble]] over [[Britain]]'s greatest prime minister ([[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt the Elder]] vs. [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]).
* [[Right fielder|RF]]: [[Darryl Strawberry]] ([[Los Angeles Dodgers]]): The only ringer who did play in the game, hitting nine [[home runs]]; replaced by pinch-hitter Homer in the bottom of the last inning as part of a questionable [[platoon system]] strategy by Burns.
* [[Left fielder|LF]]: [[José Canseco]] ([[Oakland Athletics]]): Rescued a woman and her possessions from her burning house; after saving her child and her cat, the woman had Canseco save her various appliances.
* [[First baseman|1B]]: [[Don Mattingly]] ([[New York Yankees]]): Kicked off the team by Mr. Burns for his "[[sideburns]]" parodying a fight Mattingly had with Yankees owner [[George Steinbrenner]]. This is despite the fact that Mattingly never had sideburns and was still kicked off the team even though by then the entire middle third of Mattingly's head was shaved. Even so, Mattingly remarks that Burns was still better than Steinbrenner.
* [[Center fielder|CF]]: [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] ([[Seattle Mariners]]): Overdoses on nerve tonic, resulting in [[gigantism]].
* [[Catcher|C]]: [[Mike Scioscia]] ([[Los Angeles Dodgers]]): Suffered [[Radiation]] poisoning, leaving him unable to move or speak at normal rate.
* [[Shortstop|SS]]: [[Ozzie Smith]] ([[St. Louis Cardinals]]): Lost in a space-time anomaly at the Springfield [[Mystery Spot]].
* [[Starting pitcher|P]]: [[Roger Clemens]] ([[Boston Red Sox]]): Hypnotized into thinking he is a [[chicken]].

== Burns' first-choice team ==
When Burns gets the idea of acquiring ringers, he unveils a team of 19th century and [[dead-ball era]] players that he wants Smithers to sign. Smithers then has to tell Burns that all these players have retired and passed on, and that the right fielder (Jim Creighton) has been dead for 130 years.

*P: [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown]]
*C: [[Gabby Street]]
*1B: [[Cap Anson]]
*2B: [[Napoleon Lajoie]]
*SS: [[Honus Wagner]]
*3B: [[Pie Traynor]]
*LF: [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]]
*CF: [[Harry Hooper]]
*RF: [[Jim Creighton]]

It should be noted that although most of these players were contemporaries, Traynor (the youngest member of the team) was born more than half a century later than Creighton. In fact, seven of the players (Anson being the exception) weren't even born yet when Creighton died. Anson, too, is a lot older than the rest of the team. He was 44 years old and close to retirement by the time Lajoie and Wagner made their Major League debuts, and had retired before any of the other players reached the Majors. Furthermore, Traynor is significantly younger than the rest of the team, and when he made his Major League debut in 1920, only Hooper was still active.
