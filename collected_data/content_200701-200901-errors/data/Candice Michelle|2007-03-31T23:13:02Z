'''Candice Michelle Beckman''' (born [[September 30]], [[1978]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]), better known as '''Candice Michelle''' or just '''Candice''' is a Costa-Rican model, [[actress]], and a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], currently working for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] under their ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]] brand''.

==World Wrestling Entertainment== 
===Diva Search and Raw (2004-2005)===
Candice Michelle came to WWE as a contestant in the 2004 [[WWE Diva Search]]. Although she wasn't one of the final ten contestants to make it to the televised event, WWE hired Candice anyway and placed her on the ''RAW'' brand under the [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] of a [[makeup]] artist. Initially, Candice Michelle's role was limited. She was never given an [[angle (professional wrestling)|angle]] on ''RAW'' and she rarely made [[television]] appearances unless to participate in one of the program's occasional lingerie [[pillow fight]]s or [[bikini]] contests that were held between [[Christy Hemme]], [[Maria Kanellis]], [[Stacy Keibler]], and herself.

===''SmackDown!'' (2005)===
On [[June 30]], [[2005]], at the end of the [[WWE Draft Lottery]], Candice Michelle was traded to the ''[[SmackDown]]!'' brand, where she became involved in a [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between [[Torrie Wilson]] and [[Melina Perez]]. Candice Michelle quickly became [[Jillian Hall]] and Melina's rival when she befriended Wilson. On [[July 24]], [[2005]], at ''[[The Great American Bash#2005|The Great American Bash 2005]]'', Candice Michelle served as the [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|Special Guest Referee]] for the [[Professional wrestling match types#Bra and Panties match|Bra and Panties match]] between Torrie Wilson and Melina. Melina was victorious, and after the match, Melina pushed Candice from behind. This resulted in both divas attacking Melina and removing her bottoms as well.

===Return to Raw (2005)===
She was then moved to ''RAW'' in a trade along with Wilson, while Keibler and Hemme went to ''SmackDown!''. From that point on, Candice and Wilson taunted [[Ashley Massaro]] (2005 WWE Diva Search Winner), bringing in [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] to attack her as part of their "initiation" for the new [[WWE Diva|Diva]]. This continued on until [[Trish Stratus]] returned from an injury to help Massaro retaliate against Candice and her two cohorts, who became known as the [[heel]] [[stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] Ladies in Pink, and later known as [[Vince's Devils]], which seemed to be a play on ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''.

Candice then began a gimmick where she acted like a [[princess]]. She would go to the ring carrying a plastic [[wand]] and opening her jacket to the crowd while standing on the ring apron to reveal her risque' wrestling attire.

Candice's first shot at the [[WWE Women's Championship]] came at [[Taboo Tuesday#2005|Taboo Tuesday 2005]] where she lost in a Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal.

===2006===
She would appear at ''[[New Years Revolution#2006|New Year's Revolution 2006]]'' in the first ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Bra & Panties Gauntlet match|Bra and Panties Gauntlet Match]], but was elimated by Maria. 

After winning a Women's Battle Royal on ''RAW'', Candice Michelle would get her first singles [[WWE Women's Championship]] match while a part of Vince's Devils, but lost to then-champion Trish Stratus on [[February 27]], [[2006]]. After this match, Candice Michelle slapped Wilson, blaming her for the loss.

[[Vince's Devils]] was short-lived because Torrie Wilson became a babyface diva once again when Candice Michelle and Victoria turned on her during Candice's ''[[Playboy]]'' cover unveiling. This lengthy feud between Candice Michelle and Wilson led to a match in which Playboy's then-newest cover girl Candice Michelle would face off against the 2-time former cover girl (Wilson) at ''[[WrestleMania 22]]'' in a ''[[Playboy]]'' Pillow Fight. Wilson won the match, but the feud continued on-and-off when Michelle was working backstage segments where she was [[Vince McMahon]]'s "[[sex]] slave". In late 2006, they resolved the feud as they appeared in segments together and even worked together in some matches.

Candice also appeared in both of [[2006]]'s ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event|Saturday Night's Main Events]]'' on [[NBC]]. In the [[March 18]] episode, she and [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] lost to [[Trish Stratus]] and [[Mickie James]] in a tag team match. On the [[July 15]] program, Candice was eliminated in the first round of a Divas' bikini bull riding competition, which was won by [[Michelle McCool]].

On the [[July 17]], 2006 edition of ''RAW'', Candice was the Special Guest Referee during a tag team match between Trish Stratus & Torrie Wilson vs. Victoria & [[Mickie James]] . At one point, Mickie James got in Candice's face, but Candice retaliated by slapping her and tossing her out of the ring. Afterwards, Victoria tried to clothesline Candice but she ducked, allowing Trish to hit the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Springboard bulldog|Stratusfaction]] gaining the victory for her and Torrie Wilson. This incident resulted in Candice becoming a babyface, and the feud with Mickie and Victoria lasted a few weeks. 

After [[Unforgiven#2006|Unforgiven 2006]] Candice then began a short feud with [[Amy Dumas|Lita]], even winning a match against her the night after, but going on to loose against her the next week after interference from [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] in the first round of the WWE Women's Championship tournament. She would later compete in the first ever Extreme Strip Poker segment on ''ECW on Sci-fi'' on October 10, 2006 representing ''RAW''.

On [[November 27]], [[2006]] edition of ''RAW'', during the Women's Battle Royal, Candice suffered a broken nose when Victoria nailed her in the face with a savate kick. She had surgery on [[November 30]], [[2006]] to repair her [[deviated septum]].

===2007===
Candice returned at ''[[WWE New Years Revolution#2007|New Year's Revolution 2007]]'' on [[January 7]] [[2007]], when she went down to the ring with [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]] to fight off [[Melina Perez|Melina]] as she tried to interfere in the [[WWE Women's Championship]] match between champion [[Mickie James]] and Victoria. Candice made her in-ring return on January 22nd, when she and Mickie James defeated Victoria and Melina in a tag team match.

She appeared at ''[[No Way Out#2007|No Way Out 2007]]'' in the first ever Diva Talent Invitational, which was won by [[Ashley Massaro|Ashley]].

Her next feud came when [[Melina Perez|Melina]] claimed in her [[blog]]s that all [[Playboy]] cover models were not capable of fighting her in the ring. Candice took offense to this and challenged Melina to a [[Bra and Panties Match]], which she lost.
