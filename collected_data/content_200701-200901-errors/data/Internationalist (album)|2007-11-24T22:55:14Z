'''''Internationalist''''' is the third [[studio album]] by [[Music of Australia|Australian]] [[alternative rock|rock]] [[band (music)|band]] [[Powderfinger]], released on [[7 September]] [[1998]]. The album's title refers to the ability for music to assist one in [[escapism]].

''Internationalist'' followed in the success of its predecessor, ''[[Double Allergic]]'', and went platinum in Australia. It was also the recipient of four [[ARIA Awards]], including "Album of the Year".  At the same time, the album was Powderfinger's most adventurous work to date, with [[lead singer]] and [[songwriter]] [[Bernard Fanning]] experimenting further in his lyrics than before. The album also contained the band's boldest political and social commentary to date, focused in songs like "[[The Day You Come]]"

Despite its popularity in Australia, ''Internationalist'' failed to launch Powderfinger in lucrative [[overseas]] market. It did, however, cement the band's position on the Australian music scene, with highly positive reviews.

==Recording and production==
''Internationalist'' was recorded at [[Melbourne]]'s Sing Sing Studios, with Powderfinger accompanied by [[United States of America|American]] [[producer]] [[Nick DiDia]] for the first time.  As the band had already prepared "about 30 or 40" songs when they entered the studio, DiDia's task was relatively minor.  [[Bass guitar]]ist [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]] said of DiDia; "Nick was really good...The way Nick based the record was that he wanted to record the band how we were at that particular moment, he didnâ€™t want to play around too much."  As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was mixed by DiDia not long after.<ref name=TakingFlight>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl38.htm|title=Taking Flight|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=[[Juice (magazine)|Juice]]|author=Samantha Clode|date=October 1998|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

Collins and [[lead singer]] [[Bernard Fanning]] described the album as not being "as easy listening as their previous work", and stated that it contained numerous experiments in songwriting that they hadn't put into previous albums.<ref name=TakingFlight /> Fanning later described ''Internationalist'' as being "a better record" than ''[[Double Allergic]]'', but acknowledged that it wasn't as easily likeable - it was just an improvement in songwriting.<ref name=Glory /> Collins and Fanning acknowledged that the album's experimental nature could lose them some old fans, but the pair drew parallels with bands such as [[U2]], who had "constantly re-invented themselves, and with success, I think", according to Collins.  He said the reinvention was as much for the band's own interest as it was for the "public's perception".<ref name=TakingFlight />  Meanwhile, [[guitarist]] [[Ian Haug]] described the album as a "moderation" between ''[[Parables for Wooden Ears]]'' ("the complicated beast") ''[[Double Allergic]]'' ("totally simplified"), Powderfinger's two previous albums.<ref name=BeckoningFinger>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl37.htm|title=The Beckoning Finger|work=[[Juice (magazine)|Juice]]|author=Benedict Watts|publisher=Powderfinger Central|date=November 1998|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> He also agreed that the album was much more experimental, and described the album as the band's "most successful", as well as the album that best replicated "the sound we have live".<ref name=AI>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl21.htm|title=Allergic Internationalists|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=hEARd online|date=1999|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref>

Numerous songs on ''Internationalist'' were [[politics|politically]] and socially influenced, although the band denied it being a deliberate [[motif]].  On the subject, Fanning explaining that the band didn't intentionally discuss political issues, saying "we don't try to do anything in particular". Fanning noted, however, that the songs, as his emotional responses to events in the past year, could inevitably be interpreted as being political.  Fanning also said it was dangerous for the band to attempt to "over-intellectualise" rock songs, comparing himself and Powderfinger with [[Peter Garrett]] and [[Midnight Oil]]. Fanning said he would never try to "preach", but "would only ever try and suggest things to people as possibilities", because he found it unfair to request that others doing things unless he was to do them himself.<ref name=TPolitics>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl12.htm|title=Talkin' Politics?|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Beat Magazine|author=Neala Johnson|date=December 1998|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref>

''Internationalist'''s title refers to [[escapism]] - namely, the ability that an "internationalist" has to escape from [[racism|racial]] and [[sociology|social]] [[tension]].  [[Bernard Fanning]] and [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]] agreed that "music can be a vehicle for that escape".<ref name=TakingFlight /><ref name=NotToPersonal>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl17.htm|title=Up Close (And Not Too) Personal|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=[[The Weekend Australian]] - Orbit|author=Iain Shedden|date=[[10 July|10]]/[[11 July|11]] [[1999]]|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref>

==Album and single releases==
''Internationalist'' was released in [[Australia]] on [[7 September]] [[1998]], two years and five days after Powderfinger's [[Double Allergic|previous album]]. Just shared a similar personnel with its predecessor, including producer [[Nick DiDia]], however ''Internationalist'' showcased background vocals from [[Tiddas]] for the first time.<ref name=PCDiscog>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/discog/inter.htm|title=Internationalist|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Discography|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

The first single from the album was "[[The Day You Come]]", a [[politics|politically]] and [[sociology|socially]] influenced song that mused about [[Pauline Hanson]]'s [[One Nation]] party. "The Day You Come" was released as the first single (on [[10 August]] [[1998]]) because, according to [[Ian Haug]], the band couldn't decide on what to release, so they "just came back to it."<ref name=BeckoningFinger />  In 2000, two years after its initial release, "The Day You Come" was played an estimated 18,000 times on national radio and television, a testimony to its popularity. [[Bernard Fanning]]'s response to this statistic was to proclaim that "Australia must be pretty sick of that song by now."<ref name=Esky>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl28.htm|title=The Odyssey Continues|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Esky Magazine|author=Kelsey Munro|date=February 2001|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

The second single released was the double [[a-side]], "[[Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray]]", on [[9 November]] [[1998]]. "Don't Wanna Be Left Out" was about a [[friend]] of Fanning's who had difficulty in social situations, and presented one of the roughest Powderfinger songs to date.<ref name=Feted /> [[Drummer]]  [[Jon Coghill]] also described it as the most difficult Powderfinger song to play live at the time, because it was so "fast and offbeat".<ref name=Cogsy>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl32.htm|title=Powderfinger (Int. With Jon Coghill)|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Australian Musician Magazine|date=[[Spring (season)|Spring]] 1999|author=Christie Eliezer|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref>  "Good-Day Ray" was dedicated to Australian [[television|television presenter]] [[Ray Martin]], and his public disagreements with [[Stuart Littlemore]], and was described by Coghill as containing "sort of punk lyrics - not that we're a punk band".<ref name=Feted>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl15.htm|title=Fingers feted at home|author=Ritchie Yorke|date=[[15 November]] [[1998]]|work=[[The Sunday Mail]]|publisher=Powderfinger Central|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> Coghill also described the [[music video]] for "Good-Day Ray" as being one of the better videos the band had made.<ref name=Cogsy />

''Internationalist'''s third single was "[[Already Gone (Powderfinger song)|Already Gone]]", also released [[12 February]] [[1999]]. The song was a tribute by Powderfinger to [[The Beatles]], and their influences on the band's own music.<ref name=BestOfp10>[[Powderfinger]] (2004). ''[[Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000]]'' companion booklet. Page 10.</ref> "Already Gone" did not achieve the same commercial response as other singles from the album, and was played on [[radio]] 4,000 times in 2000, compared to the 18,000 of "The Day You Come", a [[statistic]] [[Bernard Fanning]] jokingly described as "pretty pissweak".<ref name=Esky />

The fourth and final single from the album was "[[Passenger (Powderfinger song)|Passenger]]", released on [[9 August]] [[1999]].  "Passenger" was influenced by [[Elvis Presley]], and included a [[horn (music)|big horn]] section, as well as backing vocals from [[Tiddas]].<ref name=P2K>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl22.htm|title=Primed for P2K Tour|author=Carmine Pascuzzi|publisher=Powderfinger Central|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> "Passenger" won the [[ARIA Awards|ARIA Award]] for "Song Of The Year" in [[ARIA Music Awards of 1999|1999]].<ref name=Jackets>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl31.htm|title=Trusty Old Jackets|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Massive Magazine|author=Rod Yates|date=September 2000|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> The [[music video]] for "Passenger" was one of Powderfinger's more lavish visual works, featuring computer graphics for the first time.<ref name=P2K /><ref name=YouTubePassenger>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwgdN687SU0|title=Passenger - Powderfinger|publisher=[[YouTube]]|format=[[Adobe Flash]]|accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref>

==Touring and promotion==
Powderfinger went on a nationwide [[concert|tour]] after the release of ''Internationalist'', performing [[United Kingdom|British]] band [[Swervedriver]], and fellow Brisbane band [[Not From There]] in [[capital city|capital cities]] across Australia.<ref name=Fish /><ref name=Feted /> Later, in 1999, the band would tour with [[Something for Kate]] and [[Alex Lloyd]].<ref name=Glory>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl20.htm|title=Powder And The Glory|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] - Metro, page 3|author=Craig Mathieson|date=[[23 July]] [[1999]]|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref> [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]] described the process of choosing who the band would play with as a simple matter of choosing whose music the band preferred, stating "we had played with most of the bands...and if you're going on tour with someone you may as well go with someone you get along with and whose music you enjoy".<ref name=Fish /> Despite being fans of Swervedriver, Powderfinger did not attempt to replicate them on stage - Swervedriver were renowned for "their capability to reproduce their album sound perfectly in the live setting", and [[Bernard Fanning]] said that this was something that Powderfinger would never attempt, because he believed live shows to be much more "emotionally powerful" than recordings.<ref name=TPolitics />

With ''Internationalist'', Powderfinger first set their sights overseas, receiving lucrative places at numerous [[music festival]]s in the [[United States]], including [[South by Southwest]] in [[Texas]].<ref name=Dream>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl16.htm|title=Day Dream Believers|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=[[The Courier Mail]], Pulse|author=Nicola Six|date=[[19 November]] [[1998]]|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref> Whilst in the United States, Powderfinger played several [[showcase]] performances to record label representatives in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]]. In a later interview in Australia, Fanning said these shows were difficult as there were "no homegrown fans there to support you".  He also said the band had not been focused on the shows, and thus they did not go as well as planned.<ref name=Pulse>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl13.htm|title=Finger On The Pulse|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=HIT|author=Teresa Bolster|date=December 1998|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref> [[Jon Coghill]], meanwhile, described the showcases as "worthwhile and...fun", as were the performances in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].<ref name=P2K /> After performing in the United States, Powderfinger completed a tour of [[Canada]]. Fanning described the band's overseas outlook as a necessity for an Australian based band, as "people (in Australia) are going to get sick of you pretty quickly if you're going to do five tours a year, so that you can sustain yourself financially".<ref name=Dream />

==Response==
''Internationalist'' debuted at #1 on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian albums chart]], and went gold in its first week, selling over 35,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-1998.htm|title=ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 1998 Albums|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> It then went on to go platinum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-1999.htm|title=ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 1999 Albums|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref>  At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1999|1999]] [[ARIA Awards]], the album received three awards - "Album of the Year", "Best Rock Album", and "Best cover Art". "[[The Day You Come]]" also won "Single of the Year". In 2000, "[[Passenger (Powderfinger song)|Passenger]]" was nominated for three awards, but did not win any.<ref name="arias-list" /><ref name="ARIA-history" />

[[Ian Haug]] said he was amazed with the highly positive critical response the album had received, stating "even Molly ([[Molly Meldrum|Meldrum]]) gave it nine out of ten. Because every review has been so good itâ€™s a bit dangerous to believe it, I think. Itâ€™s just strange to read endless good reviews - I wish someone would write a really bad one." Haug also said that it was important for the band to develop "credibility" through the album, saying "people will listen with open ears if youâ€™re a credible band. If youâ€™re not, they turn off before they even hear a new song."<ref name=BeckoningFinger /> [[Jon Coghill]] agreed with Haug on the album's popularity, stating "you couldn't ask for much better", and saying he really took notice of the album's positive critical commentary.<ref name=Feted /> [[Bernard Fanning]], agreed, saying that despite [[Polydor]] telling the band the album would be heavily marketed, it was still surprising to see its success.<ref name=Fish>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl11.htm|title=Fish Tales|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=[[Juice (magazine)|Juice]]|author=Samantha Clode|date=December 1998|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref>

''[[All Music Guide]]'' did not praise ''Internationalist'' as highly as Powderfinger's previous studio album, ''[[Double Allergic]]'', stating that "much of the album was a mix of styles and ideas that didn't quite sit right as a whole".  ''All Music Guide'' also contend that the high point of the album is "The Day You Come", viewing it as "haunting", but believe the rest of the album was not of the same standard as this song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wm01.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:hbftxq8jldje|title=Internationalist > Overview|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|author=Jonathan Lewis|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref>

''Sputnikmusic'' state that ''Internationalist'' is a "beautiful, incomparable and truly surprising album", giving the album a perfect 5 out of 5.  They state that the album is a "roller-coaster ride from start to finish" and that Powderfinger are "making great music".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sputnikmusic.com/album.php?reviewid=6102|title=Powderfinger Internationalist review|publisher=Sputnikmusic|author=James Bishop|date=[[8 April]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref>
