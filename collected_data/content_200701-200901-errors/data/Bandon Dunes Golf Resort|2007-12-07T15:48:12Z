'''Bandon Dunes Golf Resort''' is a complex of three [[golf|golf courses]] located just north of the city of [[Bandon, Oregon|Bandon]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]].

==Courses==
The first course at the resort, '''Bandon Dunes''', opened on [[May 19]], [[1999]]. Bandon Dunes was designed by [[Scottish people|Scotsman]] [[David McLay Kidd]], and it instantly garnered high praise.<ref name="praise">{{cite web|title=Bandon Dunes: What Others are saying|url=http://www.bandondunesgolf.com/what_say.cfm}}</ref>  The course features [[gorse]]-lined fairways and numerous pot bunkers.

The resort's second course, '''Pacific Dunes''', opened on [[July 1]], [[2001]]. Pacific Dunes was [[golf course designer|designed]]by [[Michigan]] architect [[Tom Doak]], and sculpted by his design firm, Renaissance Design, Inc. Pacific Dunes also opened to glowing reviews and quickly surpassed Bandon Dunes as the highest-rated course on the property.  Pacific Dunes was rated the number one resort golf course in the country in 2005 by [[Golfweek]] magazine, placing just ahead of [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach]].<ref name="praise"/>

The resort's third course, '''Bandon Trails''', was designed by the team of Bill Coore and [[Ben Crenshaw]]. Bandon Trails opened on [[June 1]], [[2005]]. Bandon Trails departs from its siblings in that no holes are routed along the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The course meanders through dunes, meadows, and forest land.<ref name="praise"/>

A planned fourth course, '''Old Macdonald''' (in honor of [[Charles Blair Macdonald]]), is scheduled to open in [[2010]].<ref>{{cite web|title="Bandon Dunes: What's New|url=http://www.bandondunesgolf.com/what_new.cfm}}</ref>

Use of [[golf cart]]s is not permitted at the resort.

==Impact on local economy==
The resort employed more than 450 people in the summer of 2005 and, because of the "walking only" experience, more than 300 caddies.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Along with being one of [[Coos County, Oregon|Coos County]]'s major employers, Bandon Dunes Golf Resort is affecting the [[Southwest Oregon Regional Airport]] in [[North Bend, Oregon|North Bend]], 25 miles north of the golf resort. Due to the significant increase in usage, the commercial airport recently received funding to expand the terminal facilities.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Rankings==
All of the resort's three courses are ranked in the top 100 in the world and top 50 in the United States by [[Golf Magazine]] (September 2005 edition)â€”the only resort in the U.S. with this claim to fame. Pacific Dunes and Bandon Dunes are both ranked in the top 10 among U.S. public courses by ''[[Golf Digest]]'' (May 2007 edition).
