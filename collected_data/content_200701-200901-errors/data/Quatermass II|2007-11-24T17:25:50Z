'''''Quatermass II''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Science fiction on television|science-fiction]] [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]], originally broadcast by [[BBC One|BBC Television]] in the autumn of 1955. It is the second in the ''[[Quatermass]]'' series by writer [[Nigel Kneale]], and the first of those serials to survive in its entirety in the BBC archives. It is also the earliest surviving complete British science-fiction television production.

The serial sees [[Bernard Quatermass|Professor Bernard Quatermass]] of the British Experimental Rocket Group being asked to examine strange [[meteorite]] showers. His investigations lead to his uncovering a [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] involving [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] infiltration at the highest levels of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]]. As even some of Quatermass's closest colleagues fall victim to the alien influence, he is forced to use his own unsafe rocket prototype, which recently caused a [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear disaster]] at an [[Australia]]n testing range, to prevent the aliens from taking over [[mankind]].

==Production==
On [[September 22]] [[1955]] the [[ITV]] network was launched in the UK, bringing [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial television]] to Britain for the first time and ending the [[BBC]]'s broadcasting [[monopoly]] in the country.<ref name="onthisday">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/22/newsid_3131000/3131477.stm|title=1955: New TV channel ends BBC monopoly|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> The new network's creation had been established by the [[Television Act 1954]],<ref name="tvact">{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/Oftel/publications/news/on61/5min0903.htm|title=Oftel's five minute guide to the history of telecommunications regulation is the UK|first=Peter|last=Walker|publisher=[[Ofcom]]|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> and the BBC had known in advance that they would need programmes to combat the new rival for television audiences. Referring to the 1953 science-fiction serial ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'' in a memo written in 1954, BBC Television's Controller of Programmes, [[Cecil McGivern]], noted that: "Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while [''The Quatermass Experiment''] lasted.

''Quatermass II'' comprised six half-hour episodes, transmitted [[live television|live]] from Studio G at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]] in [[London]].<ref name="dvdnotes22">Pixley, p. 22.</ref> The episodes &mdash; individually subtitled "The Bolts", "The Mark", "The Food", "The Coming", "The Frenzy" and "The Destroyers" &mdash; were shown every Saturday night at 8 p.m. from [[October 22]] to [[November 26]] [[1955]]; due to the live nature of the performances, most of the episodes overran their allotted half-hour slots slightly.<ref name="dvdnotes23">Pixley, p. 23.</ref> Each episode was [[rehearsal|rehearsed]] on the Monday to Friday before transmission at Mansergh Woodall Boys Club in [[St John's Wood]], London, and then camera rehearsed in studio for most of the day on the Saturday.<ref name="dvdnotes21">Pixley, p. 21.</ref>

Not every scene was performed live; due to the increased budget &mdash; £7552 was spent on the serial,<ref name="money">£131,555.84 in 2007 figures, according to the [[The National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ currency converter tool]. In comparison, the BBC's [http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/network/genres/drama_detail.shtml drama commissioning notes for independent producers], as of 2007, specify a budget of £450,000 &ndash; £700,000 per hour for a Saturday evening drama series, at least three and a half times more than the amount spent on the whole of ''Quatermass II''.</ref> nearly double the amount spent on ''The Quatermass Experiment'' &mdash; Cartier was able to conduct a larger amount of pre-filming on [[35 mm film|35&nbsp;mm film]], with these filmed inserts being broadcast during the live transmissions of each episode as required.<ref name="dvdnotes1920">Pixley, pp. 19&ndash;20.</ref> Most of the pre-filmed material was shot [[Filming location|on location]] at the [[Shell Haven]] [[oil refinery]] in [[Stanford-le-Hope]], doubling for the factory where the alien creature is being grown on Earth.<ref name="dvdnotes1920"/> Filming also took place in rural [[Essex]] for material showing the meteorites being discovered in fields, and in the boiler rooms of the under-construction [[BBC Television Centre]] in London for scenes set inside the factory.<ref name="dvdnotes1920"/> The location film sequences were the most ambitious that had then been attempted in British television drama, which was usually predominantly studio-bound.<ref name="dvdnotes1920"/>

Each episode of ''Quatermass II'' was [[Telerecording|telerecorded]] onto 35&nbsp;mm film during its live transmission, for a scheduled [[Rerun|repeat]] the following Monday night at 10:15 p.m.<ref name="dvdnotes23"/> All six episodes survive intact in the BBC's archives, although the telerecording copies in some cases suffer from poor quality sound and vision.<ref name="restoration">{{cite web|url=http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/quatermass-article.htm|first=Steve|last=Roberts|title=Quatermass|date=January 2005|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> Due to either technical or artistic problems, Cartier had some scenes re-performed by the cast immediately following the live performance on the Saturday evening, and these were telerecorded and used to replace the live versions in the Monday night repeats.<ref name="dvdnotes23"/> ''Quatermass II'' was one of the first BBC drama productions to be repeated from a telerecording, rather than having the production re-performed live for any second showing as had been the norm in the past.<ref name="dvdnotes23"/>

Episode three, "The Food", was repeated in a slightly edited form on [[BBC Two]] on [[August 26]] [[1991]] as part of "The Lime Grove Story". This was a day of programming to commemorate the closure of the studios after forty years of BBC usage.<ref name="dvdnotes40">Pixley, p. 40.</ref>

==Plot==
[[Image:Quat202.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[John Robinson (actor)|John Robinson]] as [[Bernard Quatermass|Professor Bernard Quatermass]].]]
Strange objects are falling from the sky, one shower of which is observed by a military [[radar]] unit. After a farmer finds one of the objects in a country field, the soldiers become directly involved, and Captain John Dillon decides to unofficially ask the father of his fiancé, Paula, to investigate. Paula's father is Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group &mdash; "the rocket man!", as one of Dillon's troops puts it.

Following the events of ''The Quatermass Experiment'', Quatermass is now working on a powerful new rocket named the "Quatermass II". He is also planning a project to establish [[Colonization of the Moon|permanent bases on the moon]]. However, as the serial begins Quatermass is recovering from the news that an accident at the Quatermass II project's Australian testing range has caused a devastating [[nuclear explosion]].

Quatermass agrees to accompany Dillon on an investigation and the pair end up at the strange factory being built at Winnerden Flats, which seems to be the centre of the meteorite falls. There he finds a huge synthetic food plant which he is shocked to realise is an exact replica of one of his proposed moon bases. When Dillon becomes infected by "the mark" after going too close to a fallen meteorite, he begins opposing Quatermass, who finds that the factory is actually housing a growing alien creature rather than producing food.

As he tries to investigate further, Quatermass finds that figures in the highest levels of power in Britain have been "marked", and are under alien control. With little time left to prevent a catastrophe, he and his assistant Dr Leo Pugh are forced to use Quatermass's experimental rocket and attempt to fight the alien menace in space, despite the known flaws in the rocket's design. When the rocket reaches the aliens' asteroid base, Quatermass finds that Pugh has also been taken over by their influence; however, his colleague is sent floating helplessly off into space by the [[recoil]] from a gun he uses attempting to shoot Quatermass. The Professor is able to destroy the asteroid and take off safely back to Earth in his rocket.

==Cast and crew==
[[Reginald Tate]], who had played the title role in ''The Quatermass Experiment'', collapsed and died on [[August 23]] [[1955]], aged 58.<ref name="tate">{{cite news|title=Mr. Reginald Tate &mdash; Versatile Actor|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1955-08-25]]|page=13}}</ref> This was less than a month before the shooting of the location filming for ''Quatermass II'' began, and necessitated the casting of a replacement lead actor at short notice; [[John Robinson (actor)|John Robinson]] was chosen to fill the part.<ref name="dvdnotes18">Pixley, p. 18.</ref> Robinson was an experienced actor from a range of different films and television programmes since the 1930s,<ref name="imdb1">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0732754/|title=John Robinson (I)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> but was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate, and had difficulty in learning some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver.<ref name="dvdnotes21"/> Robinson's delivery of his lines has been criticised by some later reviewers.<ref name="heaven"/>

Appearing as Quatermass's chief assistant Dr Leo Pugh was [[Wales|Welsh]] actor [[Hugh Griffith]]. Griffith had been an actor on stage and screen since the 1930s,<ref name="hugh1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northwest/halloffame/showbiz/hughgriffith.shtml|title=Hugh Griffith|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> but gained his highest profile roles after ''Quatermass II''; he went on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] as Sheikh Ilderim in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959).<ref name="hugh2">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/497454/index.html|title=Griffith, Hugh (1912&ndash;1980)|first=Brian|last=McFarlane|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> He also appeared in ''[[Lucky Jim]]'' (1957) and ''[[Oliver!

[[Monica Grey]] played Paula Quatermass;<ref name="imdb2">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340642/|title=Monica Grey|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> she was chosen by BBC management rather than the production team, as she was the wife of the BBC's head of [[radio drama]], [[Val Gielgud]].<ref name="dvdnotes18"/> As Hugh Griffith also had problems with some of his technical dialogue, Grey learned his lines as well as her own, in case she needed to step in and assist him during the live performance.<ref name="murray50">Murray, p. 50.</ref> Dillon was played by [[John Stone (actor)|John Stone]]; Stone too had a long career as a supporting actor in a range of British television series, and in 1956 had a small role in the film ''[[X the Unknown]]'',<ref name="imdb3">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0831959/|title=John Stone (II)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> which [[Hammer Film Productions]] had intended as a sequel to [[The Quatermass Xperiment|their version of]] ''The Quatermass Experiment'', until Kneale denied them the rights to use the character.<ref name="murray53">Murray, p. 53.</ref>

Three actors who each became well-known for a particular role on British television had supporting parts in ''Quatermass II''. [[Roger Delgado]], who found fame in the 1970s as [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] in ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (1971&ndash;73), played a journalist who helps Quatermass before falling victim to "the mark" in episode four.<ref name="screenonline"/> [[Wilfrid Brambell]], later star of the [[sitcom]] ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' (1962&ndash;74) and [[The Beatles]]' film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964), appeared as a [[Vagrant|tramp]],<ref name="imdb4">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0104183/|title=Wilfrid Brambell|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> and [[Melvyn Hayes]], who played the small role of Frankie, became one of the stars of the popular sitcom ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]'' (1974&ndash;81).<ref name="imdb5">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371156/|title=Melvyn Hayes|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref>

Nigel Kneale not only wrote the serial but, previously an actor, had two speaking parts. He played the voice heard over the factory [[loudspeaker]] system in episode five, and [[narrator|narrated]] the [[recap]]s at the beginning of episodes two, three, four and six.<ref name="dvdnotes23"/> Kneale went on to write [[feature film]] screenplays such as ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' (1958) and ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'' (1964), as well as continuing to write for television, including two further ''Quatermass'' serials, until 1997.<ref name="knealescreen">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/458926/index.html|title=Kneale, Nigel (1922&ndash;2006)|first=Sergio|last=Angelini|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref>

Kneale credited the director Rudolph Cartier with bringing to the screen in ''Quatermass II'', with its ambitious location filming, an expansive style that had not been seen in British television drama beforehand.<ref name="conv"/> Cartier worked with Kneale again on the third ''Quatermass'' serial, ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'', in 1958, and had subsequent successes with plays such as ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' (1961), ''Cross of Iron'' (1961) and ''Lee Oswald &mdash; Assassin'' (1966).<ref name="cartscreen">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1181098/index.html|title=Cartier, Rudolph (1904&ndash;94)|first=Oliver|last=Wake|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> He continued directing for television until the 1970s.<ref name="cartscreen"/>

==Reception and influence==
The available British television audience had doubled since ''The Quatermass Experiment'' had been shown in 1953,<ref name="johnson">{{cite book|title=Telefantasy|first=Catherine|last=Johnson|chapter=1: Spectacle and Intimacy &mdash; The ''Quatermass'' serials and British television in the 1950s|pages=pp. 19&ndash;41|location=London|year=2005|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|id=ISBN 1-84457-076-2}}</ref> and the viewing figures for ''Quatermass II'' were accordingly higher. The serial gained an audience of 7.9 million viewers for its first three episodes, rising to 8.3 million for the fourth and fifth and concluding with 9 million.<ref name="dvdnotes45">Pixley, p. 45.</ref> A BBC audience research report commissioned after ''Quatermass II'' had finished found that 90% of those questioned in the sample had watched at least five episodes of the production.<ref name="johnson"/>

''Quatermass II'' received positive newspaper reviews in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and the ''[[Daily Express]]'', although the BBC's ''[[Radio Times]]'' listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial.<ref name="dvdnotes24">Pixley, p. 24.</ref> The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt it to be not as good as the original.<ref name="johnson"/> One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in [[Haverfordwest]] who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to [[Ireland]] to spend the rest of her life in a [[convent]]; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion.<ref name="dvdnotes25">Pixley, p. 25.</ref> Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.<ref name="johnson"/>

The BBC's own website regarded ''Quatermass II'' unfavourably when reviewing its [[DVD]] release in 2005. "The script is too often let down by the production's rougher edges. Your heart will break halfway through episode six as it all falls apart. And then there's Monica Gray &mdash; less an actress than a [[finishing school]] on legs."<ref name="bbcdvd"/> Writing in ''[[The Times]]'' in 2006, Morgan Falconer claimed to find racist undertones in the serial. "Quatermass, for instance, often seemed to have an unhealthy preoccupation with blackness, a barely veiled commentary on racial change in Britain. In one scene in ''Quatermass II'', the Professor stands outside a pub and watches the sky fill with dark asteroids. 'They’re coming in their thousands,' he says, 'this is it.'"<ref name="falconer">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14929-2441343,00.html|title=Aliens in our midst|first=Morgan|last=Falconer|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[2006-11-11]]|accessdate=2007-02-05|page=34}}</ref> However, this interpretation of the serial is not widespread, and is in direct contrast with Kneale's deliberate attack on racial intolerance in ''Quatermass and the Pit''.<ref name="allegory">{{cite episode|title=The Kneale Tapes|series=Timsehift|credits=Producer - Tom Ware; Executive Producer - Michael Poole|network=[[BBC Four]]|airdate=2003-10-15}}</ref>

Speaking in a 2003 [[television documentary]] about Nigel Kneale's career, the writer and critic [[Kim Newman]] praised the underlying themes of ''Quatermass II'', and their particular relevance to the British way of life. "''Quatermass II'' is the British ''Invasion of the Bodysnatchers'', but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing... What ''Quatermass II'' does is take that metaphor and apply it to the specific conditions of Britain in the 1950s; not just the [[Cold War]] paranoia, but the traditional British grumbling resentment of bureaucracy as represented by [[Local government in the United Kingdom|the council]], or in this case big business."<ref name="tapes">[[Kim Newman|Newman, Kim]] in {{cite episode|title=The Kneale Tapes|series=Timsehift|credits=Producer - Tom Ware; Executive Producer - Michael Poole|network=[[BBC Four]]|airdate=2003-10-15}}</ref> The British Film Institute's "[[Screenonline]]" website also offers praise in its analysis of the serial.<blockquote>"With its tale of an invasion by an invisible enemy indistinguishable from ourselves, Kneale's story tapped into contemporary fears about the 'red' (i.e. [[communist]]) threat, although in a less direct way than the American science fiction films of the 1950s, including ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers''. At the same time, it reflected the widespread anxiety of the nuclear age &mdash; the story begins with a failed test of a nuclear-powered rocket in Australia (at a time when the country was in reality a site for a series of British [[nuclear weapons]] tests). In short, ''Quatermass II'' was the perfect cold-war drama."<ref name="screenonline"/></blockquote>

Some [[science fiction fandom|science-fiction fans]] have speculated that the Quatermass serials in general, and ''Quatermass II'' in particular &mdash; with its elements including a conspiracy of silence in the government concerning extraterrestrial life, secret government facilities for alien use, and the silencing of any critic who opposes the government's plans &mdash; influenced the successful [[United States|American]] series ''[[The X-Files]]'' (1993&ndash;2002).<ref name="11th hour">{{cite web|url=http://www.the11thhour.com/archives/091999/features/muldermass1.html|title=Muldermass and the Pit|publisher=The 11th Hour Web Magazine|date=September 1999|accessdate=2007-02-05}}</ref> Kneale was invited to write for ''The X-Files'' during the 1990s, but declined the offer.<ref name="timesobit">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-2432768.html|title=Nigel Kneale|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[2006-11-02]]|accessdate=2007-02-05}}</ref>

Other genre productions that have been compared with the serial include the 1970 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[Spearhead from Space]]''.<ref name="screenonline"/> This serial features an alien entity falling to Earth in a meteorite shower; a factory taken over for the growth of the alien creature, and governmental institutions being inflitrated by servants of the aliens.<ref name="spearhead">{{cite episode|title=Spearhead from Space|episodelink=Spearhead from Space|series=Doctor Who|serieslink=Doctor Who|credits=Writer [[Robert Holmes]], Director [[Derek Martinus]], Producer [[Derrick Sherwin]]|began=1970-01-03|ended=1970-01-24|network = [[BBC]]|station = [[BBC One]]|city = London}}</ref>

==Other media==
As with ''The Quatermass Experiment'', the film rights to the serial were purchased by [[Hammer Film Productions]] &mdash; in this case after they had only read the scripts, before the serial was even made.<ref name="dvdnotes18"/> Titled ''[[Quatermass 2]]'', the film was released in 1957 and once again directed by [[Val Guest]], with [[Brian Donlevy]] starring; unlike the first film, Kneale wrote the [[screenplay]] himself.<ref name="quat2">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050873/|title=Quatermass 2 (1957)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-02-05}}</ref> In the United States, the film was released under the title ''Enemy From Space''.<ref name="quat2"/>

Shortly after ''Quatermass II'' finished its run, comedian [[Bob Monkhouse]] included a spoof of the serial in an episode of his own BBC television series, which featured Monica Grey reprising her role as Paula Quatermass. Cartier and Kneale were greatly displeased with this, and complained to their superiors at the BBC about it.<ref name="murray52">Murray, p. 52.</ref>

Quatermass returned to the BBC in 1958 when Kneale's third serial, ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'', began transmission.<ref name="screen">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438573/index.html|title=Quatermass and the Pit (1958&ndash;59)|first=Mark|last=Dugoid|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-05}}</ref> That was the last television appearance of the character for twenty years, until Kneale brought Quatermass back for a final time in the 1979 serial ''[[Quatermass (TV serial)|Quatermass]]'', this time produced for [[Thames Television]].<ref name="q79">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/442672/index.html|title=Quatermass (1979)|first=Mark|last=Dugoid|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-05}}</ref>

A serialised [[novelisation]] of ''Quatermass II'', written by Kneale, ran in the ''Daily Express'' newspaper in the UK from [[December 5]] to [[December 20]] [[1955]], although Kneale was forced to draw the storyline to a premature conclusion as the paper lost interest in the project.<ref name="dvdnotes26">Pixley, p. 26.</ref> The television scripts were released by [[Penguin Books]] in 1960, with a selection of stills from the production also included.<ref name="dvdnotes38">Pixley, p. 38.</ref> The book was re-released in 1979, with a new introduction by Kneale, to coincide with the transmission of the Thames Television serial.<ref name="dvdnotes39">Pixley, p. 39.</ref> 

In April 2005 [[BBC Worldwide]] released a DVD [[box set]] of all their existing ''Quatermass'' material.<ref name="bbcdvd"/> This included [[Remaster|digitally restored]] versions of all six episodes of ''Quatermass II'',<ref name="restoration"/> with the sound and vision of the telerecording copies cleaned up as far as possible, and some of the existing [[special effect]]s inserts that survived on their original film elements being re-inserted into the episodes.<ref name="restoration"/>
