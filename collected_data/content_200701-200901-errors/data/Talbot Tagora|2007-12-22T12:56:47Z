The '''Talbot Tagora''' was an [[executive car]] developed by [[Chrysler Europe]] and produced by [[PSA Peugeot Citroën|Peugeot Société Anonyme]] (PSA). The Tagora was marketed under the [[Talbot]] [[marque]] after PSA took over [[Chrysler]]'s European operations in 1979. PSA presented the first production vehicle in 1980 and launched it commercially in 1981. The Tagora fell far short of sales expectations, and PSA cancelled the model only two years later. Fewer than 20,000 Tagoras were ever built, all of them at the former [[Simca]] factory in the [[Poissy]] [[Commune in France|commune]] near [[Paris]], [[France]].

== Development ==
Chrysler Europe began the development of the Tagora in 1976, under the [[code name]] ''C9'', with the goal of replacing the unsuccessful [[Chrysler 180]] series. Following the same development pattern as with the [[Chrysler Horizon|Horizon]] and [[Simca 1307|Alpine]] models, the responsibility for the Tagora's technical development remained in France, while the styling was devised at Chrysler's design centre in the United Kingdom.<ref name="rootes-development">{{cite web|url=http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/car-development/dev-tagora.html|title=Development of the Talbot Tagora cars|work=Rootes-Chrysler.co.uk &ndash; Rootes Group, Chrysler Europe, SIMCA, and Talbot cars|accessdate=2006-06-11}}</ref> An early proposal for the name of the car was "Simca 2000".<ref name="club">{{cite web|url=http://www.simcatalbotclub.org/ttagora.htm|title=Talbot Tagora|work=Simca Talbot Information Centre &ndash; Simca Club UK|accessdate=2006-06-11}}</ref>

=== Design ===
The original ''C9'' prototype was a modern-styled [[sedan|saloon]] with a low beltline, ample glazing and a generous interior made possible by the rather large [[wheelbase]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] design team initially proposed some stylistic features inspired by the [[Citroën SM]], including a front glass panel between the headlights to accommodate the [[vehicle registration plate|license plate]], round front wheelarches and rear [[fender skirts]]. However, Chrysler management in the United States deemed these features too extravagant, so the design of the ''C9'' became more conventional: front and rear wheelarches were squared off and the skirts lost, and the license plate was placed on the front bumper as on most cars. To better balance the rather tall silhouette, the beltline was raised. Over the course of development, the ''C9'' also lost its vertical taillights in favour of more "fashionable" horizontal ones.<ref name="rootes-development"/><ref name="rootes-prototype">{{cite web|url=http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/proto-tagora.html|title=Talbot Tagora projects and prototypes|work=Rootes-Chrysler.co.uk|accessdate=2006-06-11}}</ref>

=== Engine dilemma ===
The main competitors in the executive vehicle market offered engines bigger than the biggest two-litre [[straight-4]] used by Chrysler Europe, and a six-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] engine was generally expected. Consequently, the company had to seek a new engine for the Tagora. One candidate was the [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] [[straight-6]], but it proved unsuitable for a car of this class. The other proposal was the [[PRV engine|Douvrin V6 engine]] (the "PRV"), a joint development of PSA, [[Renault]] and [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]]. Since the Tagora would be in direct competition with PSA models that used the PRV, it seemed unlikely that Chrysler would be able to procure that engine.<ref name="rootes-development"/>

=== Sales projections ===
Chrysler Corporation approved the development of the model on the assumption that Chrysler Europe would sell 60,000 ''C9''s per year, which translated into a projected 5 percent share of the executive car market. This estimate seemed achievable because Chrysler had a 7 percent market share in Europe overall. The projected sales would have covered the car's tooling costs, with the development costs accounted for separately, as part of an independent annual budget.<ref name="rootes-development"/>

=== PSA takeover ===
During the development of the ''C9'', the management of the [[bankruptcy]]-threatened Chrysler Corporation decided to divest itself of its debt-ridden European operations. The buyer was the French [[PSA Peugeot Citroën|PSA Group]], formed in 1976 after [[Peugeot]] took over [[Citroën]]. The deal was finalized in 1978, with the buyer paying a mere $1 for the entirety of Chrysler Europe and its [[Liability|obligations]]. The take-over was effective as of [[1 January]] [[1979]].<ref name="rootes-PSA">{{cite web|url=http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/car-development/dev-180.html||title=Development of the Simca 180 cars|work=Rootes-Chrysler.co.uk|accessdate=2006-06-11}}</ref>

While the ''C9'' project was well advanced, PSA already had a rather crowded lineup in the large vehicle segment, including the legendary [[Citroën CX]], the slow-selling [[Peugeot 604]] and the newly-launched [[Peugeot 505]]. Nevertheless, PSA decided to move forward with the ''C9'' project, making a few significant changes that enabled the use of their own parts. The Simca [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] front suspension gave way to [[MacPherson strut]]s adopted from the Peugeot 505 and 604, and the rear [[axle]] was replaced with that of the 505, much narrower than the one originally planned, as it was designed with respect to the 505 body width. The ''C9'' front end was extended to accommodate the optional PRV engine: now that the model belonged to PSA, using the PRV presented no problems.<ref name="rootes-development"/><ref name="club"/>

== Short market life ==
[[Image:Talbot Tagora 2.2 green profile.jpg|thumb|250px|A green Talbot Tagora 2.2 seen from the side]]
Following the renaming of Chrysler Europe's models to the [[Talbot]] marque, the ''C9'' was christened the Talbot Tagora, and the first batch of cars rolled out of the former Simca plant in Poissy in 1980. The same year, PSA presented the Tagora at the [[Mondial de l'Automobile|Salon de l'Automobile]] in Paris. Following a hands-on demonstration of the model to the press in [[Morocco]] in March 1981, the car went on sale in France in April and in the United Kingdom in May.<ref name="rootes-development"/><ref name="rootes-gallery">{{cite web|url=http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/tagora-gallery.html|title=Talbot Tagora gallery|work=Rootes-Chrysler.co.uk|accessdate=2006-06-11}}</ref> The British [[billboard advertising]] campaign boasted ''"The new Talbot Tagora. Luxury and performance redefined."''<ref name="club"/>

The Tagora was priced to overlap with high-end Peugeot 505s and low-end Citroën CXs, while slotting in beneath the Peugeot 604. Its pricing was also comparable to the [[Renault 20/30]] and [[Ford Granada]]. (The Tagora was in the 20,000–30,000 [[German mark|Deutschmark]] bracket in [[Germany]].)<ref name="Auto Katalog2">{{cite book | title=Auto Katalog | year=1983 |pages=178–184}} &ndash; prices in Germany on [[1 August]] [[1982]]</ref> The initial production run in 1981 (combined with some [[Pre-production car|pre-production]] runs from 1980) was only one quarter of Chrysler's initial projections. Sales proved insufficient even for this production level, and production continued to sharply decline throughout 1982 and 1983, prompting PSA to cancel the model altogether. By the time the Tagora met its fate, only about 20,000 had been built; by comparison, over 116,000 Peugeot 505s and 74,000 Citroën CXs were made in 1981 alone.<ref name="Auto Katalog3">{{cite book | title=Auto Katalog | year=1983 |pages=243}}</ref><ref name="rootes-development"/><ref name="club"/>

== Powertrains and versions ==
As with most large cars of its time, the Tagora was a [[rear-wheel drive]] vehicle, with a longitudinally-mounted engine. There were three engine choices, mated to four- and five-speed [[manual transmission]]s or an optional three-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] in the case of the four-cylinder engines.<ref name="Auto Katalog"/><ref name="brochure">{{cite web|url=http://storm.tocmp.com/talbot/tagora18.jpg|title=Dutch Talbot Tagora brochure|work=Free Car Brochures|accessdate=2006-06-11}} {{Nl icon}}</ref>

The available models were:

* 2.2&nbsp;L (2165&nbsp;cc) ''[[Simca Type 180|Type 180]]'' [[OHC]] [[straight-4|I4]], double-barrel ''[[Solex]]'' [[carburetor]], 115&nbsp;[[Horsepower#PS|PS]] (85&nbsp;[[Watt|kW]]), 184&nbsp;[[Newton metre|N·m]] (136&nbsp;[[Torque|ft·lbf]])
:The base engine was a version of the older Simca ''[[Simca Type 180|Type 180]]'' 2-litre with increased displacement, as also featured in the [[Matra Murena]]. It was unrelated to either the [[United States|American]] [[Chrysler K engine|Chrysler ''K'']] or PSA ''[[Douvrin engine|Douvrin]]'' 2.2-litre engines.<ref name="rootes-development"/> Available trim levels were designated '''GL''' and '''GLS'''. The GL was the only model to feature the four-speed manual transmission, and have [[power steering]] as an option rather than standard. It was first to be dropped, for the 1983 model year.

* 2.3&nbsp;L (2304&nbsp;cc) ''XD2S'' [[Overhead valve|OHV]] [[turbocharger|turbo]][[diesel engine|diesel]] [[straight-4|I4]], 80&nbsp;PS (59&nbsp;kW), 188&nbsp;N·m (139&nbsp;ft·lbf)
:This Peugeot-developed [[turbodiesel]] was primarily used in the Peugeot 505 and 604. The diesel-powered version of the Tagora was designated '''DT'''.

* 2.7&nbsp;L (2664&nbsp;cc) ''[[PRV engine|PRV]]'' OHC [[V6 engine|V6]], two triple-barrel ''[[Weber carburetor|Weber]]'' carburetors, 166&nbsp;PS (122&nbsp;kW), 234&nbsp;N·m (173&nbsp;ft·lbf)
:The V6 model, which was actually badged "2.6", came in the top '''SX''' trim level, loaded with extras, but (surprisingly) it was not available with automatic transmission.<ref name="brochure"/> The PRV engine used in the Tagora was different from the one used in contemporary Peugeots in that it was fitted with triple-barrel Weber carburetors rather than [[fuel injection]], resulting in a higher power rating. This made it the most powerful French car of its time.<ref name="Auto Katalog"/> Nevertheless, only 1,083 V6 Tagoras were made.<ref name="club 604">{{cite web|url=http://club604.free.fr/tagora/tagora.html|title=La Talbot Tagora|work=Club 604 International|accessdate=2006-06-11}} {{Fr icon}}</ref>

== Tagora ''Présidence'' ==
The Tagora ''Présidence'' was a [[concept car]] designed by stylist Sunny Atri at the Talbot design studio in [[Whitley, Coventry]]. The concept was created to generate interest in employing high-end Tagoras as chauffeur-driven [[limousine]]s by users such as business executives and government officials. The donor model for the ''Présidence'' was the 2.6 SX, which had an interior appointed with [[Connolly Leather]] upholstery and real [[brass]], plus a host of electronics including a telephone, [[dictaphone]], text-message receiver, and television with [[VCR]]. Originally valued at [[Pound sterling|£]]25,000, the ''Présidence'' now resides at a car museum in Poissy.<ref name="rootes-presidence">{{cite web|url=http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/tagora-pres.html|title=Tagora Presidence|work=Rootes-Chrysler.co.uk|accessdate=2006-06-11}}</ref><ref name="Presidence">{{cite web|url=http://tagora.special.9online.fr/|title=A cutting of the article on the ''Présidence'' from the French magazine ''Gazoline'', posted online|accessdate=2006-06-11}} {{Fr icon}}</ref>

== Reasons for commercial failure ==
=== Market situation and image ===
In terms of engineering, the Tagora had no major flaws (except perhaps for the poor cabin ventilation). The [[1979 energy crisis]], however, dealt a blow to the European automotive market: the large car segment contracted significantly, making Chrysler's initial sales projections unrealistic. The Tagora was ultimately launched under the Talbot brand, which was relatively unestablished in the marketplace and had a questionable pedigree, which was an unfavorable trait in the executive car market ruled by established names like the [[Ford Granada]].<ref name="rootes-development"/><ref name="club"/>
[[Image:Talbot Tagora 2.2 interior.jpg|250px|thumb|Interior of a Talbot Tagora 2.2]]

=== Design ===
As the British automobile magazine ''[[What Car?]]'' opined, the Tagora "has such a complete blandness of style as to disqualify it instantly in a market where character and status count for so much."<ref name="rootes-development"/> The design of the Tagora was focused on practicality, providing exceptional cabin space at the expense of style. The loss of some of the original design elements at the hands of Chrysler left the Tagora rather featureless. The steep windshield formed a quite strange angle with the relatively short, wedge-shaped [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]]. The car was wider and taller than most of its competitors, and buyers were unaccustomed to such proportions. The PSA-sourced axles had very narrow tracks relative to the width of the body, which provided an awkward look, especially at the rear. Nor did the plain, plastic [[dashboard]] stir enthusiasm among reviewers and prospective customers.<ref name="rootes-development"/><ref name="club"/>
