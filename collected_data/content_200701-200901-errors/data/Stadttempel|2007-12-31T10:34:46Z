The '''Stadttempel''' ([[English language|en]]: City-Temple or City-Synagogue) is the main [[synagogue]] of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. It is located in the 1st [[Districts of Vienna|District]] ([[Innere Stadt]]), at Seitenstettengasse 4.

The synagogue was constructed from [[1825]] to [[1826]] by the Viennese architect [[Joseph Kornhäusel]] in a neo-classicistic style. The luxurious ''Stadttempel'' was fitted into the block of houses and hidden from plain view from the street. This went back to an edict issued by Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] that only Catholic places of worship were allowed to have a direct means of entry from the street. This situation actually saved the synagogue from total destruction during the ''[[Reichskristallnacht]]'' in November [[1938]], as the [[Nazism|Nazis]] were afraid that the whole block could go up in flames. The other 93 synagogues and [[Jewish]] prayer-houses of Vienna were badly damaged or destroyed. In August [[1981]] two people died after [[Arab]] [[terrorist]]s threw a hand grenade at the synagogue. Today the synagogue is the main temple for the Viennese Jewish Community of about 7,000 members.
