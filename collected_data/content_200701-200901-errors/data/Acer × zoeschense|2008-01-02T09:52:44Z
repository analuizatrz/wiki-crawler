'''''Acer × zoeschense''''' ('''Zoeschen Maple''') is a [[hybrid]] [[maple]], a cross between ''[[Acer campestre]]'' (Field Maple), and either ''[[Acer lobelii]]'' (Lobel's Maple)<ref name=afm>Mitchell, A.

==Description==
''A. × zoeschense'' is a medium-sized [[tree]] growing up to 20&nbsp;m (66&nbsp;feet) tall, and almost as wide. The shiny, five-lobed leaves are 10–11 cm long and up to 14 cm broad, dark green, often with purplish edges. The [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]] produce a milky [[latex]] when broken. The [[flower]]s are produced in open [[corymb]]s 5–10 cm diameter, each flower small, pale yellow-green, with five sepals but no petals. The [[fruit]] is a paired [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] 5 cm across; the two [[seed]]s are usually [[infertility|sterile]].<ref name=afm/><ref name=gelderen/>

==Cultivation==
One [[cultivar]], ''A. zoeschense'' 'Annae', was popular as a street tree in previous generations. In the [[United Kingdom]], a mature and magnificent example of  'Annae' can be viewed in [[Westonbirt Arboretum]]. The [[Japan]]ese cultivar, 'Kinka', has [[variegation|variegated]] foliage.<ref name=gelderen/>
