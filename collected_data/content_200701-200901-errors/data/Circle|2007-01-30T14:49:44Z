{{about|the shape and mathematical concept of circle}}
In [[Euclidean geometry]], a '''circle''' is the [[set]] of all [[point (geometry)|points]] in a plane at a fixed [[distance]], called the [[radius]], from a fixed point, the ''centre''.  Circles are [[simple closed curve]]s, dividing the plane into an interior and exterior.  Sometimes the word ''circle'' is used to mean the interior, with the circle itself called the circumference(C). Usually, however, the ''[[circumference]]'' means the length of the circle, and the interior of the circle is called a ''[[Disk (mathematics)|disk]]''. An ''arc'' is any continuous portion of a circle. 

A circle is a special [[ellipse]] in which the two [[foci]] coincide (i.e., are the same point).  Circles are [[conic sections]] attained when a right circular cone is intersected with a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone.

In an ''x''-''y'' [[coordinate system]], the circle with centre (''a'', ''b'') and radius ''r'' is the set of all points (''x'', ''y'') such that
:<math>
\left( x - a \right)^2 + \left( y - b \right)^2=r^2
</math>.

If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then this [[formula]] can be simplified to 
:<math>
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
</math>.

The circle centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the [[unit circle]].

Expressed in [[parametric equations]], (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') can be written using the [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine as

:''x'' = ''a'' + ''r''&nbsp;cos(t)
:''y'' = ''b'' + ''r''&nbsp;sin(t),

where ''t'' is a [[parametric variable]], understood as the angle the ray to (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') makes with the x-axis. 

In [[homogeneous coordinates]] each [[conic section]] with equation
:<math>
ax^2+ay^2+2b_1xz+2b_2yz+cz^2=0
</math>

is called a circle.

It can be proven that a ''conic section'' is a circle if and only if the point I(1,i,0) and J(1,-i,0) lie on the conic section. These points are called the [[circular points at infinity]].

In [[polar coordinates]] the equation of a circle is:
:<math>
r^2 - 2 r r_0 \cos(\theta - \varphi) + r_0^2 = a^2
</math>

The [[slope]] of a circle at a point (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') can be expressed with the following formula, assuming the centre is at the origin and (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') is on the circle:
:<math>
y' = - \frac{x}{y}
</math>.


In the [[complex plane]], a circle with a centre at ''c'' and radius ''r'' has the equation <math>|z-c|^2 = r^2</math>. Since <math>|z-c|^2 = z\overline{z}-\overline{c}z-c\overline{z}+c\overline{c}</math>, the slightly generalized equation <math>pz\overline{z} + gz + \overline{gz} = q</math> for real ''p'', ''q'' and complex ''g'' is sometimes called a '''generalized circle'''. It is important to note that not all generalized circles are actually circles.

All circles are [[similarity (mathematics)|similar]]; as a consequence, a circle's circumference and radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]], as are its [[area (geometry)|area]] and the square of its radius. The [[mathematical constant|constants]] of proportionality are 2[[pi|π]] and π, respectively.

In other words: 
*Length of a circle's circumference is: 
:<math>
c = 2\pi \cdot r
</math>
*The [[Area of a disk|area enclosed by a circle]] is:
:<math>
A = r^2 \cdot \pi = \frac{d^2\cdot\pi}{4} \approx 0{.}7854 \cdot d^2
</math>
*Diameter of a circle is:
:<math>
d = 2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} = 2r \approx 1{.}1284 \cdot \sqrt{A} 
</math>

The [[compass]] in this [[13th Century]] manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation (theology)|Creation]], as many believed that there was something intrinsically "divine" or "perfect" that could be found in circles]]
The formula for the ''area of a circle''
<ref>Saying: '''area of the circle''', it is a common use in coloquial situations, , but in precise mathematical terms it should be say (and think) the area [[bounded]] by circle and not the interior because [[interior of a set]] is another precise concept, even, the circle hasn't interior relative to the plane</ref>   
can be derived from the formula for the circumference and the formula for the area of a [[triangle (geometry)|triangle]], as follows. Imagine a regular [[hexagon]] (six-sided figure) divided into equal triangles, with their apices at the centre of the hexagon.  The area of the hexagon may be found by the formula for triangle area by adding up the lengths of all the triangle bases (on the exterior of the hexagon), multiplying by the height of the triangles (distance from the middle of the base to the centre) and dividing by two.  This is an [[approximation]] of the area of a circle.  Then imagine the same exercise with an [[octagon]] (eight-sided figure), and the approximation is a little closer to the area of a circle.  As a regular polygon with more and more sides is divided into triangles and the area calculated from this, the area becomes closer and closer to the area of a circle. In the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], the sum of the bases approaches the circumference 2π''r'', and the triangles' height approaches the radius ''r''. Multiplying the circumference and radius and dividing by 2, we get the area, π ''r'' <sup>2</sup>.

The formula for the area of circle can also be derived by using an [[infinitesimal]] area element <math>dA</math> and integrating it over the whole circle.

In [[Chinese mathematics]] the area of a circle is usually expressed as:
:''A''=''c''/2•''d''/2
where ''A'' is the area, ''c'' is the circumference, and ''d'' is the diameter. c=2πr, and d=2r, so c/2•d/2=πr²=A, the familiar identity for area.

==Properties==
[[Image:CIRCLE LINES.svg|right|200px|Chord, secant, and tangent]]
[[Image:Circle slices.svg|right|185px|Arc, sector, and segment]]

*The circle is the shape with the highest area for a given length of perimeter.
*The circle is a highly symmetric shape, every line through the centre forms a line of [[reflection symmetry]] and it has [[rotational symmetry]] around the centre for every angle. Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[orthogonal group]] O(2,'''R'''). The group of rotations alone is the [[circle group]] '''T'''.

===Chord properties===
*Chords equidistant from the centre of a circle are equal (length). 
*Equal (length) chords are equidistant from the centre. 
*The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector: 
**A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord. 
**The line segment ([[Circular segment]]) through the centre bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord. 
*If a central angle and an [[inscribed angle]] of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. 
*If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal. 
*If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are supplemental.
**For a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle.
*An inscribed angle subtended by a semicircle is a right angle.

===Tangent properties===
*The line drawn perpendicular to the end point of a radius is a tangent to the circle. 
*A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent at the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle. 
*Tangents drawn from a point outside the circle are equal in length. 
*Two tangents can always be drawn from a point outside of the circle.

===Theorems===
{{See also|Power of a point}}
*The chord theorem states that if two chords, CD and EF, intersect at G, then <math>CG \times DG = EG \times FG</math>. (Chord theorem) 
*If a tangent from an external point ''D'' meets the circle at ''C'' and a secant from the external point ''D'' meets the circle at ''G'' and ''E'' respectively, then <math>DC^2 = DG \times DE</math>. (tangent-secant theorem) 
*If two [[secant]]s, DG and DE, also cut the circle at H and F respectively, then <math>DH \times DG = DF \times DE</math>. (Corollary of the tangent-secant theorem) 
*The angle between a tangent and chord is equal to the subtended angle on the opposite side of the chord. (Tangent chord property)
*If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 degrees then ''l'' = √(2)&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''r'', where ''l'' is the length of the chord and ''r'' is the radius of the circle.
 [[Image:Secant-Secant_Theorem.svg|thumb|200px|right|Secant-secant theorem]]
*If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle A is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (DE and BC). This is the secant-secant theorem.

==Inscribed angles==

[[Image:inscribed_angle_theorem.svg|thumb|242px|right|Inscribed angle theorem]]

An [[inscribed angle]] <math>\psi</math> is exactly half of the corresponding [[central angle]] <math>\theta</math> (see Figure).
Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc have the same value
(cf. the blue and green angles <math>\psi</math> in the Figure).  Angles inscribed on the arc are supplementary.
In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a [[diameter]] 
is a [[right angle]].

==An alternative definition of a circle==

[[Image:Apollonius_circle_definition_labels.svg|thumb|200px|left|<math>\frac{d1}{d2}=\textrm{constant}</math> Apollonius' definition of a circle]]

[[Apollonius of Perga]] showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points having a constant ''ratio'' of distances to two foci, A and B.  

The proof is as follows.  A line segment PC bisects the interior angle APB, since the segments are similar
:<math>
\frac{AP}{BP} = \frac{AC}{BC}
</math>

Analogously, a line segment PD bisects the corresponding exterior angle.  Since the interior and exterior angles sum to <math>180^{\circ}</math>, the angle CPD is exactly <math>90^{\circ}</math>, i.e., a [[right angle]].   The set of points P that form a right angle with a given line segment CD form a circle, of which CD is the diameter.
{{-}}
As a point of clarification, note that C and D are determined by A, B, and the desired ratio; i.e. A and B are not arbitrary points lying on an extension of the diameter of an existing circle.

==Numbers and the circle==
The division of the circle into 360 degrees dates back to ancient [[India]], as found in the [[Rig Veda]]:

:Twelve spokes, one wheel, navels three. 
:Who can comprehend this? 
:On it are placed together 
:three hundred and sixty like pegs. 
:They shake not in the least. 
:(Dirghatama, Rig Veda 1.164.48) 

This division is used in mathematics, but also in [[geography]] and in [[astronomy]] to measure the celestial sphere and equator (both in terms of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]).

The [[enneagram]] expresses the circle as equal to 9 integers. The structure of the enneagram is based partly on the primary [[triangle]] of the circle at 0/360 degrees, 120 degrees and 240 degrees of the circle. In terms of integers, these points of the circle correspond to the numbers 0/9, 3 and 6. The rest of the Enneagram structure consists of connections between the other 6 integers of the 9-based number system - determined by the fraction 1/7 = 0.142857 (repeating).
