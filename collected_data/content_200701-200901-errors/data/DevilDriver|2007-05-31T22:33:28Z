'''DevilDriver''' is a [[death metal]]-influenced [[groove metal]] band from [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]].

==Biography==
The group was started by its core members (everyone except for Dez). The band saw Dez one morning in a diner in California. They made the offer to jam, which Dez accepted. [[Dez Fafara]] is the former frontman of the band [[Coal Chamber]], who broke up prior to his term in Devildriver, as a result of frustrations over heavy drug use between various members of the band. After the demise of Coal Chamber, DevilDriver became his main focus. Their debut album, the self-titled [[DevilDriver (album)|DevilDriver]], was released on [[October 23]], [[2003]] under [[Roadrunner Records]]. Dez wanted to focus more on the extreme side of music, influenced by [[black metal|black]], [[Death metal|death]], and [[thrash metal]]. This is more apparent on their second album, [[The Fury of Our Maker's Hand]], where one can hear traces of [[Scandinavian death metal]], specifically with the guitar work.

Their second album, ''[[The Fury of Our Maker's Hand]]'', was released in 2005 and was generally well-received by fans and critics alike, even garnering a 4K review from rock magazine [[Kerrang]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrun.com/artists/Devildriver/showphoto.aspx?photoID=10838|title=Kerrang DevilDriver Review Scan}}</ref> 

The band went on numerous tours in support of the album, including stops in the [[United States]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]] in support of bands such as [[In Flames]], [[Fear Factory]], and [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], as well as the Burning Daylight Tour, their first headlining.

On [[October 31]], [[2006]], DevilDriver re-released ''The Fury of Our Maker's Hand'' with three additional studio tracks and three live recordings of previously released material. The special edition also contains a DVD of all of their music videos to date.

Just recently, DevilDriver wrapped up the recording sessions for their third album (which is set to be released on [[July 31]], [[2007]]), entitled ''[[The Last Kind Words]]'', at Sonic Ranch studios outside El Paso, Texas and will be promoted in 2007 by the band playing the British rock festival [[Download Festival]] at [[Donnington]] alongside headliners [[Linkin Park]], [[Iron Maiden]], and [[My Chemical Romance]]. They are currently on tour with [[Unearth]], [[Dimmu Borgir]], and [[Kataklysm]].

"Horn of Betrayal" was debuted off ''The Last Kinds Words''. It was played on May 16th on Sirius Satellite's Hard Attack channel.

==Trivia== 
* A "Devil Driver" is the name witches give to the bells they use to drive evil away when they are casting their spells. 
* During their shows, DevilDriver have the crowd form a [[circle pit]]. These are regular circle pits but are often very large and are becoming a signature for the band, much like [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]]'s [[Wall of death (moshing)|Wall of Death]]. At the 2007 installment of the UK's [[Download Festival]] DevilDriver aim to set a [[Guiness World Record]] for largest Circle pit ever.
* As with as the [[Japan]]ese ''The Fury of Our Maker's Hand'' release, the special re-release contains two [[bonus tracks]]: "Guilty as Sin" and "Unlucky 13", as well as "Digging Up the Corpses", which was an outtake from their first album. These three songs were later added to ''The Fury of Our Maker's Hand'' re-release album, along with 3 live tracks: "I Could Care Less", "Hold Back the Day", and "Ripped Apart."
* The band was originally named ''Deathride'', but changed their name to ''DevilDriver'' before their first release.
* "Driving Down the Darkness" was featured in the [[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]] episode "[[My Long Goodbye]]", in which the track is (incorrectly) described as "[[speed metal]]".
* There is no exact genre of metal that DevilDriver play, as Dez says he doesn't want to pigeonhole their genre.
* They were dubbed by Phil Anselmo, the former Pantera leadman and current Down lead singer, as the next Pantera.
* "The Mountain" was featured on the soundtrack for the US release of [[Galerians: Rion]]
