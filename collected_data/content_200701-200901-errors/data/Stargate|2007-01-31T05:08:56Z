'''''Stargate''''' refers to the [[science fiction]] [[media franchise]] beginning with the 1994 feature film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', and the subsequent body of works that detail an elaborate [[fictional universe]]. The story of the film was continued in [[novel]] form, in two live-action television series (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''), one animated series (''[[Stargate Infinity]]''), and in other [[spin-off|derivative works]].

Owned by [[MGM]], the franchise has proved successful even {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 1994 }} years after its conception.<ref name="Stargate 200">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6332083.html|title=''Stargate 200'': 10 years of ''Stargate'' success|work=MultiChannel}}</ref> However, due to multiple developers working separately and independently on the franchise over the years, as a whole, the various Stargate productions are not entirely coherent. Although no set of works form a "correct" [[canon (fiction)|canon]], the largest [[fanbase]] exists for the [[Timeline of Stargate|story]] which begins with the original film, and continues with ''Stargate SG-1'' ([[1997]]&ndash;present) and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' ([[2004]]&ndash;present).<ref name="Comic Boom">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6357339.html|title=''Comic Boom'': Massive loyal fanbases for SciFi productions like ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''|work=MultiChannel}}</ref> The [[Stargate: Third series|third series]] is currently being developed.

All Stargate productions center on the premise of a "[[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]", a ring-shaped alien device that allows for personal [[teletransportation]] to complementary devices cosmic distances away.<ref name="SG1 Official">{{cite web|url=http://www.stargatesg-1.com|title=''Stargate SG-1'' Official Site}} ''FAQ Section''</ref> Most Stargate productions are set in the [[present day]],<ref name="stargate summary">{{cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=132284|title=Summary of ''Stargate''|work=New York Times}}</ref> with plots constructed so that there is [[suspension of disbelief|no immediate contradiction]] between the depicted events and [[reality]].<ref name="wright02">{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/articles/interviews/wright02.shtml|title=Interview with Brad Wright|work=GateWorld}}</ref> As such, the existence of the Stargate devices is described as a [[military secret]].<ref name="film">''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' ([[1994]]).</ref>

However, after a successful rebellion the aliens were forced to flee and the Stargate was buried, to be forgotten until rediscovery in 1928.<ref name="film" />

In 2006, Stargate SG-1 was recognized as the longest running consecutive sci-fi series by [[Guinness World Records]]. The show is second only to [[Doctor Who]], which holds the title for longest running sci-fi show overall.

The feature film '''''Stargate''''' was released in [[1994 in film|1994]]. Written by [[Dean Devlin]] and directed by [[Roland Emmerich]], it was originally intended as the start of a film franchise, but Emmerich moved on to create ''[[Independence Day (film)|Independence Day]]'' and ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]''.<ref name="amazon">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/52346/ref%3Ded%5Fart%5F370423%5Ftxt%5F1/026-7273928-0012425|title=''Stargate SG-1'' on DVD|work=Amazon.com Feature}}</ref> Despite the film not being continued in a cinematic [[trilogy]] as intended, the story itself was later expanded by writers and developers other than Emmerich and Devlin.

Notably, Emmerich and Devlin do not consider <i>Stargate</i>'s [[spin-off]]s to be valid continuations of the original film's story, although [[MGM]] owned the rights to the franchise and they were unable to see "their" sequels made.<ref name="devlin">{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537|title=Dean Devlin on his Movie Trilogy|work=ComingSoon.net}}</ref> As a result, some fans of the film reject the series (and vice-versa).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2006/07/21/devlin-pushing-stargate-the-movie-trilogy/|title=Fan reactions to films versus series|work=SliceOfSciFi.com}}</ref> Devlin has, however, stated that he plans to write his own sequel to ''Stargate'' separately to its spin-offs, providing two versions of the continuing story.<ref name="devlin"/>

The film cost an estimated [[USD|$]]55,000,000 to produce, and made $196,600,000 gross worldwide, $16,600,000 of which was in the opening weekend.<ref name="imdb business">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111282/business|title=Business Data for ''Stargate''|work=IMDb}}</ref> Critical reaction to it was varied.

{{spoiler}}
The plot of the film set the grounds of the Stargate mythos. A brilliant [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], [[Daniel Jackson|Dr. Daniel Jackson]] ([[James Spader]]) is shunned by the academic world due to his far-fetched theories. However, a [[Catherine Langford|Dr. Catherine Langford]] privately hires him to [[decipher]] a set of [[symbol]]s found on the [[cover stone]]s of an ancient ring-shaped artifact (the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]) that had been found at [[Giza]] in 1928. Jackson discovers that the symbols are in fact [[constellation]]s, so that if 6 are identified, a point in space can be extrapolated corresponding to a "destination"; a seventh symbol then defines the [[point of origin]]. This unlocks the secret to using the Stargate for travel.

[[United States Air Force|USAF]] Colonel [[Jack O'Neill (Stargate)|Jack O'Neil]] ([[Kurt Russell]]), alongside Jackson, leads an expedition through the Stargate to the planet [[Abydos (Stargate)|Abydos]]. In the plot of the film, there existed only two Stargates in the universe, connecting only Abydos and Earth; hence the purpose of the mission was to determine whether Abydos was dangerous, and if so to destroy the gate there, protecting Earth. Expansions of the film such as ''SG-1'' explained later that there is an entire network of Stargates, meaning that this original mission would have been fruitless.

On Abydos, Jack O'Neil's team comes into conflict with [[Ra (Stargate)|an alien]] who is posing as the [[Egyptian Mythology|Egyptian sun god]] [[Ra]]. He controls vast numbers of slaves who mine for him and live in fear; the slaves are in fact the descendants of humans who were transported to this planet from Ancient Egypt in the distant past. Jack's team befriend the people, and Daniel Jackson falls in love, and is married, to a woman named [[Sha'uri]].

Before Jack O'Neil is able to detonate a nuclear warhead, sealing the pathway to Earth, Ra steals the bomb and enhances it so that its destructive power increases a hundredfold, then intends to send the bomb back to Earth. Jack is unable to defuse the detonation timer, so instead he moves the bomb onto Ra's space-vessel, where it detonates, destroying both Ra and Ra's ship.  With the destruction of Ra, the slaves of Abydos are liberated.

Jack and the surviving members of his team return to Earth, but Daniel stays behind to live with his wife.<ref name="primer"/>

===''Stargate SG-1''===
{{main|Stargate SG-1}}
[[Image:Sg1-poster.jpg|thumb|The original starring cast of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.]]

'''''Stargate SG-1''''' is a [[television series]] that debuted on [[Showtime]] on [[July 27]], [[1997]], and moved to the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]] after its fifth season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2001-08/14/12.30.sfc|title=Announcement from SciFi Channel|work=SciFi Wire}}</ref> Created by [[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]], it starred [[Richard Dean Anderson]] (as the respelled [[Jack O'Neill|O'Neill]]), [[Michael Shanks]] (as [[Daniel Jackson|Jackson]]), [[Amanda Tapping]], [[Christopher Judge]] and [[Don S. Davis]].

The cast has remained fairly regular for most of <i>SG-1</i>'s run but has experienced some changes. [[Michael Shanks]] left the show at the end of Season 5 and was replaced by [[Corin Nemec]] as [[Jonas Quinn]].  Shanks returned at the beginning of Season 7 and Nemec was written out. At the end of Season 7 [[Don S. Davis|Davis]] left the show and [[Richard Dean Anderson|Anderson]] filled the gap he left in the story. Season 9 saw an unpopular departure of [[Richard Dean Anderson|Anderson]], but added new regulars [[Beau Bridges]] and [[Ben Browder]]. After a debut episode in Season 8, followed by appearances in eight episodes of Season 9, [[Claudia Black]]'s popular reaction<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/claudia_black_01.htm|title=Interview &mdash; Vala joins ''SG-1'' regulars|work=SciFi World}}</ref> earned her a position in the regular cast in Season 10.

[[MGM]] put an average of $1,400,000 into each episode of the show, and regard it as one of their most important franchises.<ref name="Stargate 200" /> It has won the [[Saturn Award]] for ''Best Syndicated Television Series'' on numerous occasions, as well as its cast having won similar awards for their acting.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118480/awards|title=''Stargate SG-1'' Awards and Nominations|work=IMDb}}</ref> More recently it has received acclaim for its [[visual effect]]s which have increased in quality and realism as the show gained a larger budget.<ref name="vfx">{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/05/istargatei_grew_cutting_edge_vfx.shtml|title=Stargate  grows cutting edge VFX industry|work=GateWorld}}</ref>

The series begins one year after the original film in their internal chronology. It chronicles the activities of [[SG-1]], the first exploratory team of the newly-formed [[Stargate Command]], after an enemy attack through the Stargate allows the [[United States Air Force]] to discover that Ra was not the last of [[Goa'uld|his species]], as they thought in the film. The series expands on the film, creating a full and rich [[Series Mythology|mythology]] and a strong cast of recurring characters.

''Stargate SG-1'' proved to be very popular. Between Seasons 6 and 8, the show was repeatedly expected to end, but ratings continued to be high, allowing the show to break records and enter its current tenth season (surpassing ''[[The X-Files]]'' as the longest running [[United States]] science-fiction series). 

On the [[August 21]], 2006, the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] announced that they would not be renewing ''Stargate SG-1'' for an eleventh season after a series of poor performances in the [[Nielsen Ratings]].<ref name="sg1 cancellation">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6364450.html?display=Breaking+News|title=''Stargate SG-1'' Said To Be Axed|work=MultiChannel News}}</ref> Many fans were enraged at the news, even initiating reactionary websites to exhibit their commitment to the series.<ref name="savestargatesg1">{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/fans_rally_savestargatesg1.com.shtml|title=Fans Rally: SaveStargateSG1|work=GateWorld}}</ref> Spokespersons for the production have said all options for the continuation of ''SG-1'' are being considered, including complete digital broadcasting.<ref name="sg1 future">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6366152.html|title=MGM Insists ''Stargate'' Won't Shut|work=MultiChannel News}}</ref> Executive producer [[Robert C.

However, SciFi has attempted to block other networks from taking up the show, citing their original exclusive contract with MGM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/mgm_considers_isg-1is_future.shtml|title=MGM Considers ''Stargate SG-1'' Future|work=GateWorld}}</ref> In response to Sci-Fi's announcement to cancel Stargate, a community site &mdash; (see external links) has been set up in an effort to convince Sci-Fi to renew the show. Despite such efforts, MGM has decided not to pursue an eleventh season and instead focusing their efforts on new SG-1 DVD movie productions.

MGM has since announced the release of two direct-to-DVD SG-1 films for release in Autumn 2007.  '''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]''' will wrap up the Ori storyline, and '''[[Stargate Continuum]]''' will involve time travel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/10/istargate_sg-1i_movies_coming_to.shtml|title=Stargate SG-1 movies coming to DVD|work=GateWorld}}</ref>  This is intended to be the beginning of a series of SG-1 DVD movies, released at a rate of one per year or so.

===''Stargate Atlantis''===
{{main|Stargate Atlantis}}
[[Image:Sga poster 1.JPG|thumb|The original starring cast of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.]]

'''''Stargate Atlantis''''' began as a [[spin-off]] [[television series]] from ''Stargate SG-1'' that was originally intended to succeed its seventh season and a second feature film. When ''SG-1'' was renewed for an eighth season, the intended film became the episode "[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]", a two-part [[season finale]], and the setting of ''Stargate Atlantis'' was moved to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]]. <ref>{{cite book | last = Gosling  | first = Sharon | authorlink = Sharon Gosling | title = Stargate Atlantis: The Official Companion Season 1 | origdate =  | origyear = 2005 | origmonth = July | publisher = Titan Books | location = London | id = ISBN 1-84576-116-2 | pages = 10&ndash;14 | chapter = Watergate }}</ref> This allowed the two shows to exist side-by-side within the same [[fictional universe]], and later on the two shows even began to be interconnected, almost to the point that audiences were expected to watch both. The show is developed by most of the same people as ''SG-1'', and is produced in the same studios.

''Atlantis'' debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel on [[July 16]], [[2004]], starring [[Joe Flanigan]] and [[Torri Higginson]] in the lead roles, with [[Rainbow Francks|Rainbow Sun Francks]], [[David Hewlett]], and [[Rachel Luttrell]] alongside. Hewlett and Higginson had previously been characters in ''SG-1''. In <i>Atlantis</i>' second season, [[Paul McGillion]] and [[Jason Momoa]] (replacing Francks) were added as regulars. The series is currently in its third season, and opposite to SG-1 a new season has already been confirmed by the SciFi Channel, so there will be a 4th season for the series.

The plot follows the adventures of the "Atlantis expedition", a combination of military forces and civilian scientists that travel to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]] in search of the Lost City of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], left behind by the powerful race known as the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]]. The finding of the city had been a plot arc for most of <i>SG-1</i>'s Season 7, and the Ancients themselves had been a long-running facet of the ''SG-1'' setting. Arriving at the City, the expedition discover that the Pegasus galaxy is dominated by a terrible enemy known as "the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]" whom they must defend themselves against despite being vastly outnumbered and helpless.

The series has won several awards for its actors, visual effects and directors, including a [[WorldFest]] Platinum Award for [[David Winning]]'s direction of an early Season 1 episode. ''Atlantis'' proved to be equally as successful as ''SG-1'', with [[Nielson Ratings]] consistently in the regions of 1.9.

===''Stargate Third Series''===
{{main|Stargate: The third series}}
A third series of Stargate is in development, although no concept for the new show has been announced. It is thought to premiere in 2008 or later. 
 
More details can be found [http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/12/exclusive_third_istargatei_serie.shtml here].

===''Stargate Infinity''===
{{main|Stargate Infinity}}
[[Image:Stargate-infinity.jpg|thumb|Characters from ''[[Stargate Infinity]]''.]]

'''''Stargate Infinity''''' was an [[animated series]] spin-off from ''Stargate SG-1'' intended for children aged 9 to 11. It ran from [[14 September]], [[2002]] to [[June 2003]] on the [[FOX]] Network. Even though the series was produced by [[MGM]] with [[DiC Entertainment]], none of the writers and producers of ''Stargate SG-1'' were involved with ''Infinity'', and it is not considered official Stargate [[canon (fiction)|canon]].<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/articles/interviews/wright01.shtml GateWorld &mdash; Interviews: Brad Wright]</ref> The show was cancelled after 1 season for its poor reception and ratings.

Set 30 to 40 years in the future, ''Infinity'' tells the story of a team of young recruits led by a veteran member of [[Stargate Command]] that are framed for a crime they did not commit. The team must travel from world to world trying to find a way to clear their name, whilst protecting a strange alien being discovered in the first episode, which is believed to hold the secret to mysteries surrounding the Stargates and the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] race that built them. Due to its cancellation, none of the major [[plot arc]]s of the series were concluded.

The series featured a strong [[moral]] and [[edutainment|educational]] theme, purposely summarizing each episode with a distinct lesson for its young audience to learn. It focused primarily on the importance of [[teamwork|working together]] and accepting [[xenophobia|differences]] in other cultures or people, whether they be aliens or members of your own team. The "Stargate Explorers" exhibited the qualities of typical role models&mdash;this formulaic clich√© might have contributed to the show's unpopularity, appearing patronizing and unwatchable even for Stargate [[aficionado]]s, and too [[didactic]] even for children. It is more or less ignored or even unknown to most Stargate audiences.

==Books==
{{main|Stargate literature}}

There are three series of novels based on the Stargate franchise, one based on the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' film and two based in the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' [[television show]]s. Short fiction has also been published in the official ''Stargate Magazine''. 

A series of books written by [[Bill McCay]] were published from [[1996]] to [[1999]] that were unofficial sequels to the film. These were produced by consulting the original notes made by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, in an attempt to envision where the film "would have gone". Neither party has commented on whether McCay's interpretation was correct. Despite the fact that he attempted to remain close to the original vision, the subsequent television series ''Stargate SG-1'' (which began under an entirely independent development) developed the story along different lines, making  no attempt to reconcile the plot lines of the books. This marked the first major branching of the franchise.

Later,  from 1999 to 2001, [[ROC (publisher)|ROC]] published four novels based in ''Stargate SG-1'' written by [[Ashley McConnell]]. In 2004, [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Fandemonium|Fandemonium Press]] started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on ''Stargate SG-1''. Due to the conflict with ROC's license, these books were available in  [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], but not in the US. Fandemonium books became available in the US in 2006.

The official ''Stargate Magazine'', produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''.

===Comic books===
{{main|Stargate Comics}}

A series of [[comic book]]s, based on ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'', began to be published by [[Avatar Press]] in [[2003]]. Five have been published to date, with stories by [[James Anthony]] and artwork by [[Jorge Correa]].

==Video Games==
[[Image:Stargate Worlds Concept.jpg|thumb|Concept art for ''Stargate Worlds''.]]

* A [[Stargate SG-1 (roleplaying game)|Stargate Role-Playing Game]] ([[Role-playing game|RPG]]) was produced by Alderac Entertainment. It was considered canon by both the publishers, and the staff of MGM.<ref>[http://www.alderac.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6471 Posts by the Adelrac Entertainment staff on their boards]</ref> However, when [[Sony]] bought MGM, they lost the license to produce Stargate RPG products and the RPG license is currently unassigned.
* Two [[video game]]s based on the film were released by [[Acclaim Entertainment]]: a [[side-scrolling]] [[platformer]] for the [[Super Nintendo]] and [[Sega Genesis]], and a [[Tetris]]-like [[puzzle game]] for the [[Sega Game Gear]] and [[Nintendo Gameboy]].
* ''[[Stargate SG-1: The Alliance]]'' was a computer game based on the Stargate universe, which was due to be released in late [[2005]]. The release of the game was however cancelled.
* There are three simulator-style [[amusement park]] rides named ''[[Stargate SG-3000]]'' located at [[Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom]], [[Six Flags Great America]], and [[Six Flags Marine World]].
* ''[[Stargate Worlds]]'' is a Stargate-universe [[MMORPG]] in development. The writers and producers of Stargate view Stargate Worlds as running side by side with the show in complete canon. <ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/01/mgmannouncesstargatemmorpg.shtml GateWorld &mdash; News: MGM announces Stargate MMORPG]</ref>

==Future of the franchise==
Charles Cohen, executive vice president of MGM Television, has voiced plans to develop further Stargate films and produce a [[Stargate: Third series|third television series]] (discounting ''Infinity'' as a Stargate television series), currently in a pre-production concept phase .<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/05/mgm_planning_stargate_film_third.shtml MGM planning Stargate film, third series]. ''Gateworld.net''</ref><ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/12/exclusive_third_istargatei_serie.shtml Exclusive: Third Stargate series in development]. ''Gateworld.net''</ref> Additionally, [[Brad Wright]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]], developers of ''SG-1'' have signed a contract with MGM to produce two ''SG-1''-based films.  Both films will be direct-to-DVD releases.<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/10/istargate_sg-1i_movies_coming_to.shtml Stargate SG-1 movies coming to DVD] ''Gateworld.net''</ref>

Plans for producing two sequels of the original film were announced by the original film's creator [[Dean Devlin]] at the 2006 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. He has said he is currently in talks with MGM to produce four films and he would like two of them to be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy.<ref name="film_sequels">[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537 Devlin Announces Plans for Stargate Sequels]</ref> In an interview with [[SciFi Wire]],<ref>[http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=37194&type=0 SciFi Wire Interview with Devlin]</ref> Devlin says that should the sequels be made, he hopes to enlist [[Kurt Russell]] and [[James Spader]] in the two sequels. These sequels would ignore the 10 years of mythology created by ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' if they are produced.
