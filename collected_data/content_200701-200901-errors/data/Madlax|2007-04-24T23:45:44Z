{{nihongo|'''''Madlax'''''|マドラックス|Madorakkusu}} is a 26-episode [[anime]] [[television series]] produced in [[2004 in television|2004]] by the [[Bee Train]] animation studio.  [[Kōichi Mashimo]] directed ''Madlax'' and the soundtrack was composed by [[Yuki Kajiura]].  The [[DVD]] version was released in [[North America]] by [[ADV Films]], and as of November 2006, it airs on the [[Anime Network]] channel.  According to the director Mashimo, the title is a [[portmanteau]] of two [[English language|English]] words: ''[[wiktionary:mad|MAD]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:relax|reLAXed]]'', mirroring the authors' intention to portray the two extremes of human being.<ref name="Wong" />

The story revolves around two young women, who, at first glance, have nothing in common, nor know of each other's existence. The first and titular [[heroine]] is Madlax, a living legend among the mercenaries and assassins in Gazth-Sonika, a small [[Asia]]n country torn by a [[civil war]]. "Madlax" is a [[code name]] and a substitute for her real one, forgotten along with the rest of her past before 1999, when the war started. The second girl is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy [[aristocrat]]ic family in the peaceful [[Europe]]an country of Nafrece. Twelve years before the story begins, an [[airliner]] her mother and she were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret's father who lead the rescuers, have been missing ever since. Margaret managed to travel back to Nafrece on her own, though how she made it remains a mystery because she has lost her memories prior to her return, save one word: "Madlax". This thread linking the two girls turns out to be a much more intense connection when they both independently start investigating the powerful [[crime syndicate]] Enfant and its enigmatic mastermind, who, for some reason, shows interest in both of them. 

Multiple similarities between ''Madlax'' and ''[[Noir (anime)|Noir]]'', an earlier work by Bee Train, have been pointed out.<ref name="AJ_V1_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animejump.com/index.php?module=prodreviews&func=showcontent&id=662|title=''Madlax'' DVD #1 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Carter, Jason|date=[[2005-07-20]]|publisher=''AnimeJump.com''}}</ref><ref name="ANN_V1_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=747|title=''Madlax'' DVD #1 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Martin, Theron|date=[[2005-05-06]]|publisher=''[[Anime News Network]]''}}</ref>  According to the authors, these two series are the first installments of a planned [[trilogy]] exploring the so-called girls-with-guns [[genre]],<ref name="Wong">{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=A.|title=Inside Bee Train|journal=[[Newtype USA]]|pages=8-15|date=[http://www.newtype-usa.com/issues/index.php?itemid=71 March 2005]}}</ref><ref name="GWG">See also the article about the [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Girls-with-guns girls-with-guns] on ''Bee Train Fan Wiki''.</ref> with the third title being ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]''.<ref name="ANS_EC_news">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsservice.com/archives/janx.htm|title=January 3-10 News|accessdate=2007-01-19|date=[[2007-01-06]]|publisher=''Anime News Service''|quote=Following ''Noir'' and ''Madlax'', this [''El Cazador''] will be the thrid <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> installment in a series of what Director Koichi Mashimo has referred to as his girls-with-guns genre trilogy.}}</ref> Still, ''Madlax'' differs considerably from its predecessor, as it is more plot driven and less episodic, pays much attention to the interaction of various factions rather than individual characters,<ref name="DV_V2_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/madlaxvol2.php|title=''Madlax'' DVD #2 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Hattaway, Mitchell|date=[[2005-09-01]]|publisher=''DVDVerdict.com''|quote=...every new twist only strengthens the plot.

{{main|List of Madlax characters}}
''Madlax'' features a large cast of distinctive characters which, according to the composer [[Yuki Kajiura]], serve as the milestones for {{nihongo|[[List of Madlax characters#Margaret Burton|Margaret Burton]]'s|マーガレット・バートン|Māgaretto Bāton}} inner growth, one of the main topics of the show (see [[#Themes|Themes of ''Madlax'']]).<ref name="ST5">{{cite DVD-notes|title=[http://www.advfilms.com/CatalogFilms_Detail.asp?ID=4206 Madlax Volume 3: The In-Between]|titleyear=2004|director=[[Kōichi Mashimo]]|format=insert leaflet ''Staff Talk #5 (Yuki Kajiura)''|publisher=[[ADV Films]]|location=[[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]]|publisherid=DMAD/003|year=2005}}</ref>  At the beginning, Margaret is a sleepy, clumsy [[amnesia]]c, who lives under the care of her devoted and sometimes overprotective [[maidservant]] {{nihongo|[[List of Madlax characters#Elenore Baker|Elenore Baker]]|エリノア・ベイカー|Erinoa Beikā}}, a [[child prodigy]] who graduated from school years ahead of other students to spend all her time caring for her "Miss".

It is also Vanessa who links Margaret to the other female lead in the second half of the series &mdash; {{nihongo|[[List of Madlax characters#Madlax|Madlax]]|マドラックス|Madorakkusu}}, a beautiful and kind young woman who happens to be the most efficient operative and assassin in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika<ref name="ep1_agnt">'''Galza Lieutenant:''' "What'll be a big deal is when THAT one shows up.

Just like Margaret, Madlax remembers next to nothing of her life before twelve years ago, except the word that she accepted as her [[code name]] and a vague [[flashback|image]] of her father, whom she hopes to meet one day. Madlax's supernatural battle skills prove increasingly useful when Vanessa's investigation of the Gazth-Sonican [[casus belli]], which until then had been unjustly thought to be her own father's [[diplomat]]ical incompetence,<ref name="ep13_VPar">'''Vanessa:''' "My father was a diplomat in Nafrece, you see, and at the time that the threat of civil war here was coming to a peak, he was in charge of relations with Gazth-Sonika.

Carrossea attempts to gain the trust of Margaret Burton, whom he is assigned to observe, yet he also feels himself mysteriously drawn to her. Another agent of Enfant in the series is {{nihongo|[[List of Madlax characters#Limelda Jorg|Limelda Jorg]]|リメルダ・ユルグ|Rimeruda Yurugu}}, an officer of the Gazth-Sonikan [[royal guard]] and the best [[sniper]] in the country, except for Madlax with whom she develops an increasingly bitter rivalry.

=== Plot summary ===
{{main|Fictional setting of Madlax|Plot summary of Madlax}}
{{spoiler}}
The series starts off with the two female leads living completely separate lives.  This is reflected in the episode structure of the first half of the series; the episodes generally alternate their focus between the two.  Madlax works as a [[special forces|special ops]] agent for hire in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, while Margaret enjoys the tranquility of Nafrece, a country apparently styled after [[France]].<ref name="ep14_Eiffel">''Madlax'', episode 14: The Eiffel Tower can be observed at approx. 6:25.</ref>  When a "picture book", presumably given to Margaret by her late father, attracts the attention of international [[crime syndicate]] Enfant, she starts researching the book's origins and discovers that they lie in Gazth-Sonika.  Enfant's top operative, Carrossea Doon, tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction &mdash; towards Madlax, who has been causing Enfant trouble in Gazth-Sonika for some time. Meanwhile, Vanessa Rene, Margaret's former tutor, discovers that her employer, Bookwald Industries, covertly supports the [[civil war]] in Gazth-Sonika by supplying both sides with [[firearm]]s, so she seizes the opportunity to find more about the true [[casus belli]]. Her investigation brings her to Gazth-Sonika, where Madlax is assigned as her [[bodyguard]], and together, they uncover data that proves that Enfant orchestrated the entire conflict. Enfant intercepts them and forces into hiding. Back in Nafrece, Margaret decides to travel to Gazth-Sonika to help Vanessa and is accompanied by both her maidservant Elenore Baker and Carrossea Doon. 

Eventually, Madlax and Margaret encounter each other and embark on a search for [[List of Madlax characters#Quanzitta Marison|Quanzitta Marison]], a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who is suggested to know about Margaret's book, Enfant's involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Friday Monday (Enfant's leader) possesses [[supernatural]] powers connected to the [[Fictional setting of Madlax#Holy Books|three ancient books]], one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he in fact died 12 years ago, and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret.  Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to complete his own goals. 

[[Image:Laetitia, Margaret and Madlax.jpg|thumb|200px|Three personae of Margaret Burton]]

While Margaret and Carrossea perform the ritual, Madlax is attacked by her [[arch-nemesis]] throughout the show, Limelda Jorg.  Limelda accidentally kills Vanessa while targeting Madlax, sending the latter into [[clinical depression]].  Elenore and Lady Quanzitta's servant [[List of Madlax characters#Nakhl|Nakhl]] manage to restore Madlax's will to live and persuade her to save Margaret, and the three storm Enfant's headquarters together. During the assault, Elenore is killed and Margaret, now under Monday's control, shoots Madlax. Believing her to be dead, Monday commences a ritual to unleash people's inhibitions and trigger worldwide anarchy; but Margaret's memories return and she snaps out of his [[mind control]].  Only now does the audience learn the truth: back in 1999, Monday drove Margaret's father insane with his powers and she was forced to kill her own parent. To escape the horrible truth of her [[patricide]], Margaret split herself into three personae: the "memory keeper" [[List of Madlax characters#Laetitia|Laetitia]], the sinful Madlax, and the innocent Margaret herself. After the revelation, Madlax reappears and guns down Monday, followed by Margaret fusing the three personae to undo the ritual she previously performed with Monday, saving the world from insanity. Upon accomplishing that, she once again splits herself in three, judging that after twelve years, she no longer has the right to make decisions for her other personae.

=== Themes ===
Among the most prominent recurring themes in ''Madlax'' are the [[war]], its causes and the destructive effects it has upon the characters' lives.<ref name="CW_lives">Pete's life story (''Madlax'', episode 1); Guen McNichol's life story (episode 3); Luciano's life story (episode 9).</ref> In the first episodes, the authors juxtapose the tranquil Nafrece and the war-torn Gazth-Sonika to show off the contrast between them;<ref name="DV_V1_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/madlaxvol1.php|title=''Madlax'' DVD #1 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Hattaway, Mitchell|date=[[2005-04-28]]|publisher=''DVDVerdict.com''}}</ref> later, the story moves completely to the combat zone, focusing on the central characters, such as Limelda Jorg,<ref name="AoD_V5_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/4716.php|title=''Madlax'' DVD #5 review|accessdate=2006-11-09|author=Beveridge, Chris|date=[[2005-12-22]]|publisher=''AnimeOnDVD.com''|quote=[Limelda's] decision [...] sets her on a path that isn't quite easy to understand but makes a twisted sort of sense.

On the other hand, ''Madlax'' can be interpreted as a story of [[List of Madlax characters#Margaret Burton|Margaret Burton]]'s search for a [[psychological identity]]: for example, based on the available to her Mashimo Menu theme titles,<ref name="Mmenu">See also the article about [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Mashimo_Menu Mashimo Menu] on ''Bee Train Fan Wiki''.</ref> Yuki Kajiura has once suggested that while searching for her memories, Margaret meets the other characters ("Gatekeepers") one after another and gets to know the lifestyles ("Gates") they represent. In the end, she finds her own "Gate", which is her new identity that finally replaces the one she lost twelve years ago.<ref name="ST5" /><!-- This entire paragraph was extracted from the DVD insert. -->

Another important theme in ''Madlax'' is Elenore Baker's loyalty towards her "Miss" Margaret Burton.<ref name="AoD_V7_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/4979.php|title=''Madlax'' DVD #7 review|accessdate=2006-11-09|author=Beveridge, Chris|date=[[2006-04-13]]|publisher=''AnimeOnDVD.com''}}</ref> She is presented as an utterly devoted and always compassionate maidservant and comes to Margaret's rescue on occasions, such as when the latter is harassed by the playboy Maurice Lopez on a private party,<ref name="ep6" /> or when Elenore storms the Enfant headquarters, where Margaret is held, on her own despite a severe gunshot wound.<ref name="ep24_ElET">Margaret, Elenore, and Friday Monday's conversation. ''Madlax'', episode 24 (16:21).</ref> Contrary to the speculations of particularly inventive fans, Elenore's affection towards her "miss" is not [[shoujo-ai|romantic]]: at some point, she recounts making a promise over her dying grandfather that she would protect Margaret forever<ref name="ep6_ElProm">'''Elenore Baker:''' "I'll protect Miss Margaret.

[[Image:Madlax and Vanessa.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Madlax and Vanessa]]

Overall, ''Madlax'' does not depict obvious [[lesbian]] relationships but has gained fame among the [[yuri (animation)|yuri]] fandom,<ref name="SAA-Madlax">A [[fanfic]] collection about ''[http://www.shoujoai.com/fanfics/madlax/ Madlax]'' and ''[http://www.shoujoai.com/fanfics/noir/ Noir]''.

According to the director [[Kōichi Mashimo]], he has always envisioned ''Noir'' and ''Madlax'' as part of a trilogy belonging to the girls-with-guns genre,<ref name="GWG" /> and soon after the release of the latter, he has revealed that the third installment is already being planned.<ref name="Wong" /> In late 2002, Mashimo invited [[Shigeru Kitayama]], the producer of ''Noir'' who once came up with its original idea, to discuss a new series entitled ''Madlax''. Kitayama greatly expanded Mashimo's original [[screenplay]] plan, but it was not until [[Yōsuke Kuroda]] was put in charge of the script that the series took its final appearance. It took Kuroda about one year to finish the screenplays for all 26 episodes, during which he was constantly encouraged by Mashimo to add his own original ideas to their initial plan. Kuroda has admitted that at the time he received Mashimo's invitation, he felt frustrated after his first project has been canceled by the publisher, so he decided to make ''Madlax'' "really extravagant", blending as many [[genre]]s at once as he could. Kōichi Mashimo, furthermore, admitted that the most unusual [[plot twist]]s, like Margaret and Madlax's connection to each other, were invented by Kuroda and him while [[alcohol intoxication|drunk]].<ref name="Wong" />

By comparison with ''Noir'', ''Madlax'' features a much larger primary cast, including multiple recurring male [[fictional character|character]]s, who were effectively absent in the former. It was not so in the original screenplay [[draft document|draft]] written by Mashimo and Kitayama: for example, "Madlax" was Margaret's own [[nickname]] and [[List of Madlax characters#Charlie|Charlie]] (Vanessa's colleague at Bookwald Industries) had one of the central roles similar to Speedy's in ''[[Avenger (anime)|Avenger]]''.

The North-American DVD release contains extras available in English only, such the controversial ''Conversations with SSS''<ref name="DV_V1_rev" /><ref name="DV_V7_rev" /><ref name="AoD_V7_rev" /> and ''Sock Puppet Theater'', an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] [[live action]] about Madlax going after [[Chris Patton]], [[List of Madlax characters#Badgis|Badgis]]' voice actor and an annoying [[womanizer]].<ref name="ANN_V67_rev" /> To access the latter, one should press "Up", "Down", "Left", and "Right" buttons when the second eye-catch of episode 21 (DVD volume #6) comes on.

Since [[7 February]] [[2006]], ''Madlax'' is aired on [[Anime Network]] (which is, like ADV Films, a subsidiary of [[A.D. Vision]]) on Tuesdays from 8:00 to 8:30 p.m. (each episode is repeated on 11:00 p.m. the same day and on 7:30 p.m. the next Tuesday).

=== Music ===
[[Image:Madlax OST I cover.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The cover of the first ''Madlax'' soundtrack album]]
Like with many of studio [[Bee Train]]'s other works (including ''Noir'', her first collaboration with them), the entire ''Madlax'' [[soundtrack]] was composed by the acclaimed [[Yuki Kajiura]], making it her and Kōichi Mashimo's fifth project together. Kajiura and [[Yuuka Nanri]]'s duo [[FictionJunction YUUKA]] recorded the series' opening and ending themes, {{nihongo|"Fragments of an Eye"|瞳の欠片|Hitomi no Kakera}} and "inside your heart", respectively, as well as two insert songs: "nowhere" and "I'm here". Aside from the opening sequence, "Fragments of an Eye" is featured in the series itself: at the end of episode 18 and in the episode 24, when Margaret is humming its tune (along with another song called "Cradle") to herself in the flower field.

The entire OST has been released on two [[album]]s in 2004. Two [[single (music)|single]]s were published in the same year by FictionJunction YUUKA, each containing an opening/ending theme and one insert song, as well as their respective [[karaoke]] versions.<ref name="OST">See also the complete track listings for [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Madlax_OST_I OST 1], [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Madlax_OST_II OST 2], [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Madlax_OP_Single OP-single], [http://www.beetrainfan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Madlax_ED_Single ED-single] on ''Bee Train Fan Wiki''.</ref>

In the insert song "nowhere", there is a frequently repeated background [[refrain]] {{nihongo|"Yanmaani"|ヤンマーニ|Yanmāni}}, which is meaningless chanting rather than an actual word. Since the song usually plays when Madlax is fighting, "Yanmaani" has become something of a joke to many ''Madlax'' fans: its loud singing has come to symbolize Madlax's apparent invincibility - some see it as a kind of "[[magic word]]" that powers Madlax up for battle, in accordance with the [[magical girl]] genre canons.<ref name="ST3">{{cite DVD-notes|title=[http://www.advfilms.com/CatalogFilms_Detail.asp?ID=4205 Madlax Volume 2: The Red Book]|titleyear=2004|director=[[Kōichi Mashimo]]|format=insert leaflet ''Staff Talk #3 (Satoshi Osawa <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>)''|publisher=[[ADV Films]]|location=[[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]]|publisherid=DMAD/002|year=2005}}</ref>

Unlike ''Noir'', which became instantly successful in Japan and Western countries despite controversial opinions about it, ''Madlax'' has never been able to match it in fame and received only moderate (though generally approving) attention from the critics. ''Madlax'' was often accused of being secondary and reusing ''Noir'''s stylistic solutions, such as the story [[premise (film)|premise]], the two heroines' appearance, and the musical style.<ref name="ANN_V1_rev" />  Nevertheless, some sources praised the story for being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor's, owing to all its episodes and [[subplot]]s being tightly intertwined and held together by the primary [[A-Plot]].<ref name="AoD_V7_rev" /> 

The majority of reviewers perceived the early episodes of ''Madlax'' as boring and too slow-paced,<ref name="AJ_V1_rev" /> but some of the same critics later remarked that the prolonged [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] is crucial to the unusual [[finale]] of the series, which fully establishes the series' own identity and sets it apart from other works.<ref name="ANN_V67_rev" /><ref name="AoD_V7_rev" /><ref name="DV_V6_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/madlaxvol6.php|title=''Madlax'' DVD #6 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Hattaway, Mitchell|date=[[2006-02-07]]|publisher=''DVDVerdict.com''|quote=Sure, at first glance ''Madlax'' appears to be nothing more than another run-of-the-mill girls-with-guns anime, but this series goes a long way to proving that the devil's in the details. <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> Unless they really blow things at the end, this will go down as one terrific series.}}</ref> According to them, after the initial volume, the story gets better and better with every new episode,<ref name="AoD_V4_rev" /><ref name="DV_V3_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/madlaxvol3.php|title=''Madlax'' DVD #3 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Hattaway, Mitchell|date=[[2005-09-15]]|publisher=''DVDVerdict.com''|quote=This series keeps getting better and better. <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> I keep waiting for ''Madlax'' to implode, but it somehow manages to keep on chugging along.}}</ref> though some have been dissatisfied with its "pseudo-[[existentialism|existentialistic]]" ending.<ref name="DV_V7_rev" /> Professional reviewers welcomed the increased number of sympathetic characters,<ref name="AoD_V6_rev" /> especially of the distinguishable male ones (Friday, Carrossea, Colonel Burton), as opposed to [[stormtrooper effect|stormtrooper]]-like operatives of Soldats in ''Noir'',<ref name="AJ_V1_rev" /> but the female character designs were still said to be much more detailed (to the point of subtle [[fanservice]] in case of Madlax) than more generic male ones.<ref name="ANN_V67_rev" />

The high quality of the [[animation]] in ''Madlax'' was generally acknowledged <ref name="ANN_V1_rev" /><ref name="AoD_V7_rev" /> and the [[action film|action]] sequences were compared to the works of [[John Woo]].<ref name="s101_v23_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.suite101.REMOVETHIS.com/article.cfm/anime_dvd/118150|title=''Madlax'' DVD #2 and #3 review|accessdate=2007-04-14|date=[[2005-09-11]]|author=Ellingwood, Holly|publisher=''Suite101.com''|quote=...this anime is part suspense, part drama, and tense filled action the likes of which reminded me of the artistry of John Woo.}}</ref> On the negative side, the episodes that involve [[computer]] use and [[computer crime|hacking]] received critisism for their lack of realism.<ref name="AoD_V3_rev" /> In terms of soundtrack, ''Madlax'' has not become as innovative as ''Noir'',<ref name="AA_OST1_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.activeanime.com/html/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2343|title=''Madlax OST I'' review|accessdate=2006-10-29||author=Salandanan, Rommel|date=[[2005-11-14]]|publisher=''ActiveAnime.com''}}</ref> with critics suggesting its OST to be a blend of ''Noir'' and ''[[.hack//Sign]]'' styles.<ref name="ANN_V2_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=773|title=''Madlax'' DVD #2 review|accessdate=2006-11-08|author=Martin, Theron|date=[[2005-06-28]]|publisher=''[[Anime News Network]]''|quote=The musical scoring, which sounds like a mix of ''Noir'' and ''.hack//SIGN'' <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>,..}}</ref> Nevertheless, the reviewers acknowledged its superiority over the majority of contemporary works.<ref name="AJ_V1_rev" /><ref name="ANN_V1_rev" /> The English translation released by ''ADV Films'' was praised for keeping most of series' original stylistic aspects preserved and inviting veteran voice actors for the dub.<ref name="AoD_V4_rev" /> Reviewers went as far as to suggest that several English voices (especially [[Mike Kleinhenz]]'s) match the characters better than the Japanese ones.<ref name="ANN_V67_rev" />

The initial slow pacing, especially compared to the first episodes of ''Noir'',<ref name="ANN_V1_rev" /> became a main reason why the audience often dropped watching ''Madlax'' before it could present its later story turns which eventually resulted in the moderate success of the series.<ref name="ANN_V1_rev" /> Among other suggested reasons behind the mediocre popularity of the show were: the [[market saturation]], which resulted from other anime series attempting to repeat the success of ''Noir'' since [[2001 in television|2001]]; the expectable disinterest against a "''Noir'' [[remake]]", found among the fans of the first series;<ref name="AJ_V1_rev" /> the over-the-top action scenes that some felt to be ridiculous;<ref name="THEM_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=817|title=''Madlax'' (first two episodes) review|accessdate=2007-01-10|author=Ross, Carlos|publisher=''THEM Anime Reviews''|quote=Usually, a show like this is saved by its dramatic themes and its action sequences.
