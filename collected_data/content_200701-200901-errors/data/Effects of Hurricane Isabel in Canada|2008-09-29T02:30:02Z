{{HurricaneIsabel}}
The '''effects of Hurricane Isabel in Canada''' were fairly minor due to Isabel transitioning into an [[extratropical cyclone]] before affecting the area. [[Hurricane Isabel]] formed from a [[tropical wave]] on September 6 2003 in the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 265&nbsp;km/h (165&nbsp;mph) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] with winds of 165&nbsp;km/h (105&nbsp;mph) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western [[Pennsylvania]] the next day before entering southern [[Ontario]].

Impact from the storm was fairly minor, including downed trees and power lines across southern [[Ontario]]. Isabel was indirectly responsible for one traffic fatality. A group of researchers flew into Isabel over [[Lake Erie]] and southern Ontario to study tropical cyclones transitioning into extratropical cyclones. The group also flew into two previous cyclones [[List of Canada hurricanes|affecting Canada]].

==Preparations==
Beginning on September 14, four days before Isabel made landfall, and continuing for every subsequent forecast, the [[National Hurricane Center]] predicted the center of Isabel would pass into the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]] before later crossing into [[Quebec]]. Initially, it was predicted to enter the country as an [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical storm]] with winds exceeding 64&nbsp;km/h (40&nbsp;mph), though later was revised to enter Canada as an extratropical depression. One forecast predicted Isabel to turn to the northeast and pass over [[Labrador]] before entering the [[Atlantic Ocean]], though subsequent forecasts correctly predicted the extratropical remnant would merge with another extratropical storm over south-central Canada.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven & Hugh Cobb|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2007-01-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003isabel.shtml}}</ref>

On September 18, the [[Canadian Hurricane Centre]] issued a heavy rainfall warning and wind warnings for portions of southern Ontario.

A group of Canadian researchers organized a [[Convair 240|Convair 580]] flight out of [[Ottawa]] to fly into Isabel to study the structure of a storm transitioning into an [[extratropical cyclone]] by collecting data from [[radar]] and [[dropsonde]]s. The plane flew generally south of the center, and while passing through the area of heaviest precipitation, ice accumulated up to 25&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;inch) thick, forcing the pilot to descend. The flight was the first Convair flight into a storm undergoing extratropical transition over land, though was similar to the two previous flights over water for [[Hurricane Michael (2000)|Hurricane Michael]] in 2000 and [[Hurricane Karen (2001)|Tropical Storm Karen]] in 2001.<ref name="summary"/>

Swells from Isabel produced moderate surf conditions along the Atlantic coast of [[Nova Scotia]], particularly in the [[Gulf of Maine]]. No direct observations were recorded, though swells of 2 to 3&nbsp;m (6 to 10&nbsp;feet) were expected.<ref name="chc918"/> 

Isabel produced rough surf in [[Lake Ontario]] while passing the lake, with waves reaching 4&nbsp;m (13&nbsp;ft) along the western portion of the lake. At [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], the waves surpassed seawalls and produced spray onto coastal streets.<ref name="summary">{{cite web|author=Chris Fogarty|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Summary in Canada|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|accessdate=2007-02-04|url=http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/isabel/index.html}}</ref> Rainfall from the storm first began affecting [[Ontario]] early on September 19.<ref name="chc919"/> The strongest convection moved over the southern portion of the province before weakening, resulting in light to moderate precipitation across the region.

The strong pressure gradient between Isabel and a [[high pressure area|high pressure system]] over the eastern portion of the country produced strong easterly winds across Lakes Ontario and Erie.<ref name="summary"/> A [[buoy]] in Lake Ontario reported a peak gust of 78&nbsp;km/h (49&nbsp;mph).<ref name="chc920"/> On land, winds reached 55&nbsp;km/h (34&nbsp;mph) with gusts to 73&nbsp;km/h (45&nbsp;mph) in numerous locations,<ref name="chc03"/> with [[Port Colborne, Ontario|Port Colborne]] reporting a peak gust of 81&nbsp;km/h (51&nbsp;mph).<ref name="tcr"/> The winds resulted in downed trees across southwestern Ontario, with many power outages reported from trees falling onto power lines.<ref name="summary"/> One person died in a traffic fatality in Ontario as a result of the storm.<ref name="2004c">{{cite web|author=Canadian Hurricane Centre|year=2004|title=Atlantic hurricane season 2004 Outlook|accessdate=2007-02-04|url=http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/outlook2004_e.html}}</ref>
