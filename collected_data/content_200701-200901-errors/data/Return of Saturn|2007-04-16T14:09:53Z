'''''Return of Saturn''''' is the fourth [[album]] by American [[ska punk]] band [[No Doubt]], released by [[Interscope Records]] in April 2000 (see [[2000 in music]]).

==Background==
After the success of No Doubt's breakthrough album ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'' (1995), the band wrote more than twenty songs for a new album, influenced by artists such as [[the Cure]].<ref name="followup">[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432728/19981111/no_doubt.jhtml "No Doubt Ready To Record 'Tragic Kingdom' Follow-Up"].  [[MTV News]].  [[November 11]], [[1998]].  Retrieved [[April 6]], [[2007]].</ref>  Having toured extensively for two and a half years since the release of ''Tragic Kingdom'', they initially had trouble producing material and decided to experiment with new sounds.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427729/19980910/cure.jhtml "No Doubt To Get Goth For Next Album?"].  [[MTV News]].  [[September 10]], [[1998]].  Retrieved [[April 6]], [[2007]].</ref>  Many of the songs were written in a rented house in [[Hollywood Hills]], [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where [[bassist]] [[Tony Kanal]] was living.<ref name="rs">Levitan, Corey.

The album's title was originally announced as ''Magic's in the Makeup'' in May 1998<ref name="rs"/> and later as ''Saturn Returns'' in November 1999.<ref name="title">Manning, Kara.

Retrieved [[April 7]], [[2007]].</ref>  The title refers to the [[astrological]] phenomenon known as the [[Saturn return]].  [[Saturn]]'s orbit takes 29.4 [[Earth]] years,<ref>[http://solarsystem.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Saturn&Display=Facts&System=Metric "Saturn: Facts & Figures"].

Retrieved [[April 7]], [[2007]].</ref> and in astrology, the time when Saturn returns to its position during a person's [[birth]] is believed to be a period of self-evaluation.  Lead singer [[Gwen Stefani]] was born [[October 3]], [[1969]], and many of the songs were written during her Saturn return.<ref name="title"/>

The album is considered by many as their darkest. Most of this is true because here the group replaces their signature ska sound, which has always been colorful and giddy, by the artsy detachment of new wave, inspired by such bands like [[Split Enz]] and especially [[Missing Persons]]. Gwen Stefani's self-deprecating lyrical sense in this album also grabbed the attention of critics, who poked her about writing on such things like insecurity, marriage and settling down. The album, which leaned on the retro-smart production sense of Glen Ballard, was very celebrated and acclaimed, even though it slid down the charts (after a very good start) and only got one major hit ("Simple Kind of Life"), while "Ex-Girlfriend", "Bathwater", and "New" largely failed to reach expectations. "Magic's in the Makeup" was originally intended to be the fourth and final single.

==Critical reception==
The album was well-received by critics.  [[All Music Guide]] gave it four and a half stars, calling it "a terrific, layered record that exceeds any expectations set by ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]''".<ref>[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas]].

Retrieved [[April 6]], [[2000]].</ref>  Barry Walters of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' referred to it as "a superstar follow-up that not only betters its predecessor but also radically departs from it".<ref>Walters, Barry.

==Chart performance==
