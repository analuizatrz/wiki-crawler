'''James Milner''' (born [[January 4]] [[1986]], [[Horsforth]], [[Leeds]], [[England]]) is an [[English people|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]]er playing for the [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] side [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. 

He has previously played for [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and spent periods on loan at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

Milner broke the record set by [[Wayne Rooney]] as the youngest ever Premiership goal scorer while playing for Leeds on [[26 December]], [[2002]], being just 16 years and 357 days old when he scored against {{afc|Sunderland}}.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/football/features/newsid_2609000/2609487.stm The Premiership's youngest guns]</ref> His record was later broken by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]'s [[James Vaughan (striker)|James Vaughan]].

==Leeds United==
Milner started his professional career with Leeds United, playing for their reserve team.  After an impressive outing with the England Under-17 team in a summer tournament in 2002, Milner was selected for the Leeds first team for the [[2002-03 in English football|2002-03]] season. He made his debut on [[10 November]] [[2002]] at [[Upton Park]], a 3-4 win against {{fc|West Ham United}}, becoming, in the process, the second youngest player ever to play in the Premiership, behind then [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] player [[Gary McSheffrey]].<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=26843&cc=5739 James Milner]</ref> In December he set another record, that of the Premiership's youngest scorer, his first goal thus coming on [[26 December]] [[2002]], in a 2-1 win against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at the [[Stadium of Light]]. He made a total 22 appearances for Leeds that season, 18 in the [[English football league system|league]], scoring two goals. On [[10 February]] [[2003]] he signed a new five-year contract for Leeds after his promising displays.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/2745555.stm Milner signs Leeds deal]</ref>

At the beginning of next season, in September 2003, Milner was sent on a month-long loan to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]].  In December he represented England U20 at the [[2003 FIFA World Youth Championship]], returning to play six league matches for Swindon, scoring two goals, and gaining important first team experience.

He was back at [[Elland Road]] in October. Milner had a good season, playing in 30 of the 38 Premiership games, scoring three goals and creating many more. However the season ended in disappointment as Leeds finished nineteenth in the league table and were relegated to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. 

Even though Milner had completed only one year of his five year deal with Leeds, there were enquiries from several clubs, and he was eventually sold to {{fc|Newcastle United}}.

==Newcastle United==
Milner signed for Newcastle on [[2 July]] [[2004]] for £5 million.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/3852503.stm Magpies land Milner]</ref> He was introduced by the Magpies in their pre-season Asian tour, and he made good use of the opportunity to score his first goal for the club, against [[Kitchee]] in [[Hong Kong]], a 1-1 draw.

His first Premiership game for Newcastle was a 2-2 draw at the [[Riverside Stadium]] against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on [[14 August]] [[2004]]. On [[16 September]] he made his European debut when Newcastle played [[Israel]]'s [[Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin FC|Bnei Sakhnin]] in the [[UEFA Cup]], and nine days later he scored his first goal for the club, against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at home on [[25 September]] [[2004]], a 3-1 win.

But Newcastle's poor start to the season, in which they could not find a win in the first four  Premiership matches, resulted in manager [[Sir Bobby Robson]] being sacked. New manager [[Graeme Souness]] gave Milner only 13 league starts in the whole season. He played 41 games in all competitions, but only scored once.

The [[2005-06 in English football|2005-06]] campaign saw Milner scoring his first European goal when he struck in Newcastle's 1-3 win away against [[Slovakia]]n side [[FK ZTS Dubnica]] in the [[Intertoto Cup]] on [[17 July]], [[2005]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4689063.stm ZTS Dubnica 1-3 Newcastle]</ref> However his inability to hold down a regular first team place, and a clause in the purchase of [[Nolberto Solano]] by Newcastle from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], resulted in Milner being loaned to Aston Villa for the 2005-06 season. 

==Aston Villa==
Former Aston Villa manager [[David O'Leary]], who managed Leeds from 1998 to 2002, gave Milner his Villa debut on [[12 September]], [[2005]] against newly-promoted West Ham United. He got his first goal for the club five days later, scoring in the 1-1 draw against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on [[17 September]] at [[Villa Park, England|Villa Park]].  Three days later Milner struck again, scoring two goals in Villa's thrilling 3-8 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] win over [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]].
 
Milner was a regular in his season with Villa and, after his loan spell had expired, O'Leary wanted to sign him permanently. With a lack of transfer funds at Villa Park, in addition to a change of management at the club, no deal appeared to be on the cards. However, with Villa being taken over by American billionaire [[Randy Lerner]] and appointing [[Martin O'Neill]] as manager, the deal was resurrected.

According to Milner's agent Mick McGuire, he was going to sign for Villa on [[31 August]], [[2006]]. Villa made an improved offer to Newcastle on the afternoon of [[30 August]] and this, after deliberation, was accepted within hours by Newcastle chairman [[Freddy Shepherd]]. Aston Villa confirmed that Milner was travelling to the club for talks. Media sources have quoted the transfer fee as being £4,000,000. However Newcastle then recalled Milner and talks broke down.<ref>[http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=415086&plid=15157&clid=7&cpid=8 Roeder backs Milner stance]</ref>

On [[27 November]] tribalfootball.com reported that Villa boss Martin O'Neill would try again for the player in January, [[2007]].<ref>[http://www.tribalfootball.com/article.php?id=19769 Villa boss O'Neill: We'll try for Newcastle's Milner]</ref> However, Milner responded by saying he would love to stay at Newcastle.<ref>[http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/newcastleunited/journalsport/tm_headline=milner-wants-united-future%26method=full%26objectid=18204291%26siteid=50081-name_page.html Milner wants United future]</ref>

{{cquote|''There are constant rumours about Aston Villa, but I think I'll still be here in January, I certainly hope so. I'm going to concentrate on Newcastle, playing my football and getting on with the job of getting us back up the Premiership table. It's no secret that I'm enjoying myself here this season''.}}

==Return to Newcastle==
The recall of Milner was to much relief of many Newcastle fans, who viewed the player as an outstanding prospect and were delighted with his level of commitment at the start of the [[2006-07 in English football|2006-07]] season.

Milner started the 06/07 season playing regularly in the first team with impressive performances. He scored a wonderful goal in Newcastle's 2-2 draw with Manchester United on [[January 1]], [[2007]], his first of the campaign. Before this he had scored just once in the league for Newcastle. His scoring form continues as he went on to score 3 goals in under 3 weeks, against {{fc|Manchester United}}, {{fc|Birmingham City}} and {{fc|West Ham United}} respectively. All of them were long-range efforts. Since his return to Newcastle he has proved his ability to play comfortably on either wing, after scoring and setting up goals with both feet on either flank.

After very impressive displays, [[Glenn Roeder]] told interested clubs such as Aston Villa and {{fc|Middlesbrough}} that Milner would not be leaving.<ref>[http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=436700&plid=15157&clid=4&cpid=8 Roeder Rejects Milner Exit Talk]</ref> On [[January 20]], [[2007]], Milner signed a new contract at Newcastle which secured his future at the club until [[2011]]. On [[January 31]], his goal scoring form continued as he netted against former club Aston Villa from 18 yards.

==England U21s==
Milner is currently part of the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 side]] and with 23 caps<ref>As of [[March 24]][[2007]]</ref>, one of the team's all-time most-capped players. He lies joint sixth in the rankings, four behind [[Jamie Carragher]] and [[Gareth Barry]].  He was first called up to the squad in August 2004, for the match against [[Ukraine national under-21 football team|Ukraine]]. 

He made his début for the team in March 2004 against [[Sweden national under-21 football team|Sweden]] and scored against [[Wales national under-21 football team|Wales]] in October 2004.  His second goal, against [[Switzerland national under-21 football team|Switzerland]] on [[6 September]] [[2006]], saw England secure the victory required to reach the final qualification round for the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2007 European U21 Championship]].<ref>[http://www.thefa.com/England/U21s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2006/09/EnglandU21s_vSwitzerland.html Milner fires U21s through]</ref> Milner became one of the first footballers to play at the newly opened [[Wembley Stadium]] on [[March 24]], [[2007]], setting up the third goal against [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy]]. He is eligible for the under-21 team until the end of the 2009 finals.
