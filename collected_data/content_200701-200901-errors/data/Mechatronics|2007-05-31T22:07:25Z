'''Mechatronics''' is the [[synergy|synergistic]] combination of [[mechanical engineering]] ("mecha" for [[mechanisms]], i.e., [[machine]]s that 'move'), [[electronic engineering]] ("tronics" for [[electronics]]), and [[software engineering]]. The purpose of this interdisciplinary engineering field is the study of [[automata]] from an engineering perspective and serves the purposes of controlling advanced [[hybrid system]]s.

==Description==
[[Image:Logo gif 800x800.gif|thumb|320px|pxright|A [[Venn diagram]] illustrating the synergy of several engineering disciplines that constitute the field '''mechatronics''']]
Mechatronics is centred on [[mechanics]], [[electronics]] and [[computing]] which, combined, make possible the generation of simpler, more economical, reliable and versatile systems.  The [[portmanteau]] "mechatronics" was first coined by Mr. Tetsuro Mori, a senior engineer of the [[Japan]]ese company [[Yaskawa]], in [[1969]]. Mechatronics may alternatively be referred to as "[[electromechanical]] [[systems]]" or less often as "control and automation engineering". 

[[Engineering cybernetics]] deals with the question of control [[engineering]] of mechatronic systems. It is used to control or regulate such a system; see [[control theory]]. Through collaboration the mechatronic modules perform the production goals and inherit flexible and agile manufacturing properties in the production scheme. Modern production equipment consists of [[mechatronic]] modules that are integrated according to a [[control architecture]]. The most known architectures involve [[hierarchy]], [[polyarchy]], [[heterarchy]] and [[hybrid]]. The methods for achieving a [[technical effect]] are described by [[control algorithm]]s, which may or may not utilize [[formal method]]s in their design. Hybrid-systems important to Mechatronics include [[production systems]], [[synergy-drives]], [[planetary-rovers]], automotive subsystems such as [[anti-lock braking system]]s, [[spin-assist]] and every day equipment such as autofocus cameras, video, [[hard disk]]s, CD-players, washing machines, etc.

A typical mechatronic engineering degree would involve classes in engineering [[mathematics]], [[mechanics]], machine component design, mechanical design, [[thermodynamics]], [[circuits]] and systems, [[electronics]] and communications, control theory, digital signal processing, power engineering, [[robotics]] and usually a final year [[thesis]].

==Variant of this field==

An emerging variant of this field is ''[[biomechatronics]]'', whose purpose is to integrate machine and man, usually in the form of removable gadgets such as [[exoskeleton]]. This is the “real-life” version of [[cyberware]].
