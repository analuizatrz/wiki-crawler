{{Campaignbox North Sea 1914-1918}}The '''Second Ostend Raid''' was the latter of two failed attempts by the [[Royal Navy]] to block the channels accessing the Belgian port of [[Ostend]] during the Spring of 1918. The [[German Navy]] had used the port since 1915 as a base for their [[U-boat]] activities during the [[first battle of the Atlantic]] and the strategic advantages of the Belgian ports in the conflict were enormous. In attempting to blockade these bases, the British were attempting force the German [[submarines]] to use bases on the German coast such as [[Wilhelmshaven]] and therefore take a circuitous route around the [[British Isles]], thus increasing the danger from allied countermeasures and reducing the length of time they were able to spend raiding in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

Ostend was strategically important for the German Navy because the canals which emptied into the [[North Sea]] in the town connected with [[Bruges]], the most important port in Southern Belgium for minor warships including submarines. Its situation eight miles inland protected it from artillery fire or coastal raids and gave a sheltered harbour for training, repair and for launching operations against British coastal shipping with relative impunity. Ostend was the smaller of the two ports from which submarines could depart Bruges, the other being [[Zeebrugge]], which had been partially blocked in the [[Zeebrugge Raid]] of three weeks previously.

The operation failed due to both heavy German resistance and the failure of British planners to judge the difficulty of finding the narrow channel of Ostend in the dark without navigation bouys, which the Germans had removed in the case of just such a British operation. Despite its failure, the operation was hailed in Britain as a courageous and daring gamble which came very close to success. Three [[Victoria Cross]]es were awarded to sailors who had participated in the operation and numerous other gallantry awards were presented. British casualties in the raid were very heavy, compared to minimal German losses.

==Bruges==
After the [[German Army]] captured much of Belgium following the [[battle of the Frontiers]] in 1914, the Allied forces were left holding a thin strip of coastline to the west of the [[Yser]]. The remainder of the Belgian coast came under the occupation of German Marine Divisions, including the important strategic ports of [[Antwerp]] and Bruges. Whilst Antwerp was a deep water port vulnerable to British attack, Bruges was comparatively safe from artillery or warship bombardment and raids from the sea. A network of [[canals]] connected Bruges with the sea at Ostend and Zeebrugge, through which small warships like [[destroyers]], [[light cruisers]] and [[submarines]] could travel and find relative safety from which to launch raids into the [[English Channel]] and along the coasts of South-East England. U-boats could also depart from Bruges at nightime, shaving a day off the journey to the Western Approaches, Avoiding the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]], and allowing U-boat captains to gain familiarity with the net and mine defences of the English Channel, through which they had to pass to reach the main battlegrounds of the Atlantic.

During 1915 and 1916 the German Navy had developed Bruges from a small Flanders port into a major naval centre with large concrete bunkers for U-boats to shelter in, extensive barracks and training facilities for U-boat crews and similar facilities for other classes of raiding warship. The military advantages such an asset brought to the Germany Navy was vital in the increasingly deperate struggle to prevent Britain from recieving food and material supplies from the rest of the world. The significance of teh bas ewas not lost on British naval planners and two previous attempts to block the exit at Ostend, the smaller and narrower of the Bruges canals, had ended in failure. In the summer of 1915 heavy [[monitors]] under Admiral [[Reginald Bacon]] had bombarded the town in efforts to destroy the lock gates which allowed access to the sea. This attack achieved nothing except the wearing out of several barrels on the monitors' 12" guns, the lock gates undamaged.

A further two years passed before the next attempt on the Ostend locks. This attack, lead by Admiral [[Roger Keyes]], was conducted in tandem with the similar [[Zeebrugge Raid]], a large scale operation to block the wider canal at Zeebrugge. Both attacks failed, but whilst at Zeebrugge the operation came so close to success that the British authorities would not realise it had failed for months, at Ostend the attack had ended catastrophically. Both blockships intended to close off the canal had grounded over half a mile from their intended location and been scuttled by their crews under heavy artillery and long-range small arms fire, which caused severe casualties. Thus whilst Zeebrugge seemed to be blocked entirely, Ostend was open wide, nulifying any success which might have been achieved at the other port.

==Planning==
As British forces on the South-East coast regrouped, remanned and repaired follwong the heavy losses at Zeebrugge, Keyes planned a return to Ostend with the intention of closing the canal and consequently severing Bruges from the sea, closing the harbour and trapping the 18 U-boats and 25 destroyers present for months to come. Volunteers from amongst the force which had failed in April aided the planning with advice based on bitter experience.
