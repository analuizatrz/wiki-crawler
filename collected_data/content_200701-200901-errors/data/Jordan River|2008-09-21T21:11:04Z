The '''Jordan River''' ({{lang-ar|نهر الأردن}} ''nahr al-urdun'', [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: נהר הירדן ''nehar hayarden'') is a [[river]] in [[Southwest Asia]] which flows into the [[Dead Sea]]. Historically and religiously, it is considered to be one of the world's most sacred rivers.<ref name="11Sep2006">{{cite web | title=Raw Sewage Taints Sacred Jordan River| url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060911_ap_Jordan_Baptism.html| accessdate=2007-04-10 |author=Ramit Plushnick-Masti|publisher=Associated Press}}</ref> It is 251 kilometers (156 miles) long.

==Physical characteristics==
===Tributaries===
* The [[Hasbani River|Hasbani]] (Arabic: الحاصباني ''hasbani'', Hebrew: שניר ''senir''), which flows from Lebanon.
* The [[Banias River|Banias]] (Arabic: بانياس ''banias'', Hebrew: חרמון ''hermon''), arising from a spring at Banias at the foot of [[Mount Hermon]]. 
* [[Dan River (Israel)|The Dan]] (Hebrew: דן ''dan'', Arabic: اللدان ''leddan''), whose source is also at the base of Mount Hermon. 
* The Iyon (Hebrew: עיון iyon, Arabic: دردره ''derdara'' or براغيث ''braghith''), which flows from Lebanon.

===Course===
The river drops rapidly in a 75 kilometer run to swampy [[Lake Hula]], which is slightly below [[sea level]] in the Galilee sea. Exiting the lake, it drops much more in about 25 kilometers to the [[Sea of Galilee]]. The last section has less [[stream gradient|gradient]], and the river begins to [[meander]] before it enters the [[Dead Sea]], which is about 400 meters below sea level and has [[Endorheic|no outlet]]. Two major [[Tributary|tributaries]] enter from the east during this last phase: the [[Yarmouk River]] and [[Jabbok|Jabbok River]].

Its section north of the [[Sea of Galilee]] (Hebrew: כינרת ''kinneret'', Arabic: ''Bohayrat Tabaraya'', meaning Lake of [[Tiberias]]) is within the boundaries of [[Israel]], and forms the western boundary of the [[Golan Heights]]. South of the lake, it forms the border between the [[Kingdom of Jordan]] (to the east) and Israel and the [[West Bank]] (to the west).

==Human impact==

In 1964, Israel began operating a [[dam]] that diverts water from the Sea of Galilee, a major Jordan River water provider, to the [[National Water Carrier of Israel|National Water Carrier]]. Also in 1964, Jordan constructed a channel that diverted water from the [[Yarmouk River]], another main tributary of the Jordan River. Syria has also built reservoirs that catch the Yarmouk's waters. Environmentalists blame [[Israel]], [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]] for extensive damage to the Jordan River ecosystem.<ref name="11Sep2006"/>

In modern times, the waters are 70% to 90% used for human purposes and the flow is much reduced. Because of this and the high evaporation rate of the Dead Sea, the sea is shrinking. All the shallow waters of the southern end of the sea have been drained in modern times and are now salt flats.

In September 2006, a problem arose with contamination: just downstream, raw sewage began flowing into the water. Small sections of the Jordan's upper portion, near the [[Sea of Galilee]], have been kept pristine for baptisms. Most polluted is the 60-mile downstream stretch - a meandering stream from the Sea of Galilee to the [[Dead Sea]]. Environmentalists say the practice has almost destroyed the river's [[ecosystem]]. Rescuing the river could take decades, according to environmentalists.<ref name="11Sep2006" /> In 2007, [[friends of the Earth]] Middle East named the Jordan River as one of the world's 100 most endangered ecological sites, due in part to lack of cooperation between Israel and the neighboring Arab states. <ref>"Endangered Jordan",''Dateline World Jewry'', [[World Jewish Congress]], September, 2007</ref>

===Importance===
The waters of the Jordan River are an extremely important resource to the dry lands of the area and are a [[Wiktionary:bone of contention|bone of contention]] among [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinians]].

===Transport===
[[Route 90 (Israel)|Route 90]] connects the northern and southern tips of Israel and parallels the Jordan River on the western side.

== Biblical importance ==
===Tanakh===
In the [[Bible]], the Jordan is referred to as the source of fertility to a large plain ("Kikkar ha-Yarden"), called on account of its luxuriant vegetation "the garden of [[God]]" ([[Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|13:10|HE}}). There is no regular description of the Jordan in the Bible; only scattered and indefinite references to it are given. [[Jacob]] crossed it and its tributary, the [[Jabbok]] (the modern Al-Zarqa), in order to reach [[Haran]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|32:11|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|32:23-24|HE}}). It is noted as the line of demarcation between the "two tribes and the half tribe" settled to the east ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|34:15|HE}}) and the "nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh" that, led by [[Joshua]], settled to the west ({{bibleverse||Joshua|13:7|HE}}, passim).

Opposite [[Jericho]], it was called "the Jordan of Jericho" ({{bibleverse||Numbers|34:15|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|35:1|HE}}). The Jordan has a number of [[ford (crossing)|fords]], and one of them is famous as the place where many Ephraimites were slain by Jephthah ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] {{bibleverse-nb||Judges|12:5-6|HE}}). It seems that these are the same fords mentioned as being near Beth-barah, where Gideon lay in wait for the [[Midianites]] ({{bibleverse||Judges|7:24|HE}}). In the plain of the Jordan, between [[Succoth]] and [[Zarthan]], is the clay ground where Solomon had his brass-foundries ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Kings|7:46|HE}}).

In biblical history, the Jordan appears as the scene of several [[miracle]]s, the first taking place when the Jordan, near Jericho, was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua ({{bibleverse||Joshua|3:15-17|HE}}). Later the two tribes and the half tribe that settled east of the Jordan built a large altar on its banks as "a witness" between them and the other tribes ({{bibleverse||Joshua|22:10|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|22:26|HE}}, et seq.). The Jordan was crossed by [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]] on dry ground ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|2:14|HE}}). Elisha performed two other miracles at the Jordan: he healed [[Naaman]] by having him bathe in its waters, and he made the axe head of one of the "children of the prophets" float, by throwing a piece of wood into the water ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|5:14|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|6:6|HE}}).

The Jordan was crossed by [[Judas Maccabeus]] and his brother [[Jonathan Maccabaeus]] during their war with the Nabatæans ([[1 Maccabees]] {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Maccabees|chapter=5|verse=24|nobook=}}). A little later the Jordan was the scene of the battle between Jonathan and [[Bacchides (general)|Bacchides]], in which the latter was defeated ({{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Maccabees|chapter=9|verse=42|range=-49}}).

===New Testament===
[[Image:Baptism Site.jpg|thumb|The excavated remains of [[Bethabara]], in modern-day [[Jordan]], where [[John the Baptist]] is believed to have conducted his ministry.]]

The [[New Testament]] states that [[John the Baptist]] baptized unto repentance<ref>Cf. {{bibleverse||Acts|19:4|KJV}}</ref> in the Jordan ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|3:5-6|KJV}}; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:5|KJV}}; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|3:3|KJV}}; [[Gospel of John|John]]{{bibleverse-nb||John|1:28|KJV}}). This is recounted as having taken place at [[Bethabara]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:28|KJV}}).

[[Jesus]] came [[Baptism of Jesus|to be baptized]] by him there ({{bibleverse||Matthew|3:13|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|1:9|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|3:21|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|4:1|KJV}}). The Jordan is also where John the Baptist bore record of Jesus as the [[Son of God]] and [[Lamb of God]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:29-36|KJV}}).

The [[prophesy]] of [[Isaiah]] regarding the [[Messiah]] which names the Jordan ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|9:1-2|KJV}}) is recounted in {{bibleverse||Matthew|4:15|KJV}}.

The New Testament speaks several times about Jesus crossing the Jordan during his ministry ({{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|10:1|KJV}}), and of believers crossing the Jordan to come hear him [[preaching|preach]] and to be [[miracle|healed]] of their diseases ({{bibleverse||Matthew|4:25|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|3:7-8|KJV}}). When his enemies sought to capture him, Jesus took refuge at Jordan in the place John had first baptized ({{bibleverse||John|10:39-40|KJV}}).

==Symbolic importance==
The Jordan is a frequent symbol in [[Folk music|folk]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], and [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]] [[music]], or in [[poetry|poetic]] or [[literature|literary]] works.

Because the [[Israelite]]s made a difficult and hazardous journey from [[slavery]] in [[Egypt]] to freedom in ''The Promised Land'', the Jordan can refer to freedom. The actual crossing is the final step of the journey, which is then complete. The Jordan also can signify death itself, with the crossing from life into [[Paradise]] or [[Heaven]].
