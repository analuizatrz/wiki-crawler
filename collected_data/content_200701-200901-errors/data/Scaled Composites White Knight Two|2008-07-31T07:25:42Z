The '''Scaled Composites Model 348 White Knight Two''' (WK2) is a jet-powered carrier [[aircraft]] which will be used to launch the [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipTwo|SpaceShipTwo]] [[spacecraft]]. It was developed by [[Scaled Composites]] as the first stage of [[Tier 1b]], a two-stage to suborbital-space manned launch system. WK2 is based on the successful mothership to [[SpaceShipOne]], [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]], which itself is based on [[Scaled Composites Proteus|Proteus]].

It was officially unveiled on July 28, 2008.

==Design==
White Knight Two is roughly three times larger than [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]], in order to perform a [[captive carry]] with the larger [[SpaceShipTwo]] spacecraft. The WK2 is similar in [[wingspan]] to a [[B-29 Superfortress]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/943/1 |title=Something dangerous and new |accessdate=2007-08-28 |date=[[August 28]], [[2007]] |publisher=thespacereview.com}}</ref> Despite that comparison, White Knight Two is a thoroughly modern aircraft - even the flight control cables are constructed of carbon fibre, using a new patented design.<ref>[http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/080606-virgin-mother.html David, Leonard. "Virgin Galactic Spaceline: Mega-Mothership Set for Rollout Debut". Space.com [[June 6]], [[2008]]]</ref>

WK2 is intended to be an [[aerobatic]] aircraft, and will provide preview flights offering several seconds of [[weightlessness]], before the actual suborbital event. It is intended to have a [[service ceiling]] of about 60,000 ft (18 km), offering a dark blue sky to passengers. This will allow tourists to practice before the real flight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/news/060811_rutan_interview.html |title=Burt Rutan on Civilian Spaceflight, Breakthroughs, and Inside SpaceShipTwo |accessdate=2007-08-25 |date=[[11 August]] [[2006]] |author=Leonard David |publisher=Space.com }}</ref>

White Knight Two consists of a [[twin boom]] with two [[jet engine]]s per hull.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kenny Kemp |title=Destination Space |year=March 2007 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] }}</ref> One hull is an exact replica of that of SpaceShipTwo (to allow tourist training), and the other will carry cut-rate day-trippers into the stratosphere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/science/space/magazine/15-06/ff_space_virgin |title=Burt Rutan and Richard Branson Want You to Hit Space in High Style |accessdate=2007-08-25 |date=[[May 22]], [[2007]] |author= Spencer Reiss |publisher=Wired.com }}</ref>

The design is quite different from the White Knight, both in size, use of tail, engine configuration and placement of cockpit(s). The White Knight uses two T-tails, but the White Knight Two uses two cruciform tails. Engine configuration is also very different, with engines hung underneath the wings on the White Knight Two as opposed to engines on either side of the sole cockpit on the White Knight.

=== Historical similarity of design ===
It has been suggested that the final design of [[Scaled Composites]] ''White Knight Two'' resembles a 1979 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft designated ''3M-2''. A twin-boom, four-engined aircraft would have carried a spaceplane under its middle wing and released it at high altitude. The design was developed by the Soviet [[Myasishchev|Myasishchev Experimental Design Bureau]] around 1979. The carrier aircraft would have been based on the Soviet [[Myasishchev M-4|3M bomber]], and like White Knight Two, it could have been used in other ways, not just for carrying the spacecraft. However, at an engineering level the resemblance between the two craft is not strong and may simply be a case of similar requirements leading to similar designs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/blogs/2008/01/25/space-ship-two-eerily-familiar%e2%80%a6/ |title=Space Ship Two: Eerily Familiar… |accessdate=2008-01-26 |date=2008-01-25 |author=Dave Brody |publisher=Live Science }}</ref>

==Commercial introduction==
The White Knight Two design was revealed on [[January 23]], [[2008]]. Completion and rollout of the first aircraft, [[VMS Eve|"Eve"]], ([[Aircraft registration|Tail Number]]: N348MS<ref>{{cite web |url=http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNumSQL.asp?NNumbertxt=348MS |title=FAA N Number Registration for "Eve" |accessdate=2008-07-28}}</ref>) occurred on [[July 28]], [[2008]], with flight tests set to begin in early September 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airventure.org/2008/news/080605_ss2.html |title=2008 AirVenture Oshkosh schedule |accessdate=2008-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/080606-virgin-mother.html |title=Virgin Galactic Spaceline: Mega-Mothership Set for Rollout Debut |accessdate=2008-06-10 |date=[[June 6]], [[2008]] |author=Leonard David |publisher=SPACE.com}}</ref>

The launch customer of White Knight Two is [[Virgin Galactic]], which will have the first two units, and exclusive rights to the craft for the first few years.

On [[July 28]], [[2008]], Branson unveiled Scaled Composites White Knight Two "Eve," inside a [[hangar]] in the [[Mojave Desert]]. Branson predicted that the maiden space voyage will take place in 18 months: "It represents... the chance for our ever-growing group of future astronauts and other scientists to see our world in a completely new light." Virgin Galactic contracted aerospace designer Burt Rutan to build the mothership and spacecraft.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7529978.stm bbc.co.uk, Branson unveils space tourism jet]</ref><ref>[http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn14419-virgin-galactic-rolls-out-spaceshiptwos-mothership.html?DCMP=ILC-hmts&nsref=tech3_head_Virgin%20Galactic%20rolls%20out%20SpaceShipTwo's%20'mothership'  space.newscientist.com, Virgin Galactic rolls out SpaceShipTwo's 'mothership']</ref>
