''''' The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet''''' is a [[tragedy]] by [[William Shakespeare]] concerning the fate of two young "[[Star-crossed|star-cross'd lovers]]". It is one of the most famous of Shakespeare's plays, one of his earliest theatrical triumphs, and is thought to be the most [[archetype|archetypal]] love story of the [[Renaissance]].

''Romeo and Juliet'' is a dramatisation of [[Arthur Brooke]]'s narrative poem ''[[The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet]]'' (1562). Shakespeare followed Brooke's poem closely<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Sources of Romeo and Juliet|author=Arthur J. Roberts|journal=Modern Language Notes|volume=17|issue=2|year=Feb 1902|pages=41-44}}</ref> but enriched its texture by adding extra detail to both major and minor characters, in particular the Nurse and [[Mercutio]]. Shakespeare also knew ''"The goodly History of the true and constant love of Rhomeo and Julietta"'', a prose retelling of the story by [[William Painter]].<ref>N. H. Keeble "York Notes on Romeo and Juliet" (Longman, 1980) p.18</ref>

Brooke's poem was not original either, being a translation and adaptation of [[Giuletta e Romeo]], by [[Matteo Bandello]], included in his ''Novelle'' of 1554.  This was in turn an adaptation of [[Luigi da Porto]]'s [[Giulietta e Romeo]], included in his [[Istoria novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti]] (c. 1530).{{Fact|date=April 2007}} This is the version that gave the story much of its modern form, including the names of the lovers, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti, and the location in [[Verona]], in the [[Veneto]]. However, the earliest-known version of the tale is the 1476 story of Mariotto and Gianozza of [[Siena]] by [[Masuccio Salernitano]], in [[Il Novellino]] (Novella XXXIII).{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Bandello's story was the most famous and was translated into French (and into English by Brooke). It was also adapted by Italian theatrical troupes, some of whom performed in London at the time that Shakespeare was writing his plays.  One such performance or script could have inspired Shakespeare's version of ''Romeo and Juliet''.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} 

This story of ill-fated lovers had obvious parallels with similar tales told throughout history, including those of [[Hero and Leander]], [[Pyramus and Thisbe]], [[Floris and Blanchefleur]], [[Troilus and Cressida]], [[Antony and Cleopatra]], [[Layla and Majnun]], [[Tristan and Iseult]], [[Chosroes and Shirin|Shirin and Farhad]] and [[Hagbard and Signy]].  Shakespeare was familiar with these stories, some of which were included in his other plays.  The tale of Pyramus and Thisbe appears in comic mode in [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]], while the Trojan War lovers, Troilus and Cressida, were given a history play of their own.

==Date and Text== 
[[Image:Romeo and juliet title page.jpg |thumb|300px|right|Title page of the Second Quarto of ''Romeo and Juliet'' (published 1599)]]
Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' was published in two distinct [[book size|quarto]] editions prior to the publication of the [[First Folio]] of 1623.  These are referred to as [[First quarto|Q1]] and [[Second quarto|Q2]].

Q1, the first printed edition, appeared in 1597, printed by John Danter.  Because its text contains numerous differences from the later editions, it is labelled a '[[bad quarto]]': the twentieth century editor T. J .B. Spencer described it as "a detestable text, probably a reconstruction of the play from the imperfect memories of one or two of the actors."<ref>T. J. B Spencer (ed.) The New Penguin Shakespeare "Romeo and Juliet" (Penguin, London, 1967) "An account of the Text" p.284</ref>

The superior [[Second quarto|Q2]] followed in [[1599]], published by Cuthbert Burby and printed by Thomas Creede. It is a much more complete and reliable text, and was reprinted in 1609 (Q3), 1622 (Q4) and 1637 (Q5).<ref>T. J. B Spencer (ed.) The New Penguin Shakespeare "Romeo and Juliet" (Penguin, London, 1967) "An account of the Text" p.286</ref> Its title page describes it as "Newly corrected, augmented and amended". Scholars believe that this text was based on Shakespeare's pre-performance draft, since there are textual oddities such as variable tags for characters and "false starts" for speeches that were presumably struck through by the author but erroneously preserved by the typesetter.<ref>T. J. B Spencer (ed.) The New Penguin Shakespeare "Romeo and Juliet" (Penguin, London, 1967) "An account of the Text" p.280</ref> Q2 contains 800 lines missing from [[first quarto|Q1]]. Q2 also has an interestingly defective stage direction: it reads "Enter [[William Kempe|Will Kempe]]" instead of "Enter Peter" in IV,v,102.

The First Folio text of 1623 seems to be based primarily on Q3, with some clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical promptbook.<ref>T. J. B Spencer (ed.) The New Penguin Shakespeare "Romeo and Juliet" (Penguin, London, 1967) "An account of the Text" p.286</ref>

The greater part of ''Romeo and Juliet'' is written in [[iambic pentameter]].  However, the play is also notable for its copious use of [[rhyme]]d verse, notably in the [[sonnet]] contained in Romeo and Juliet's dialogue in the scene where they first meet (Act I, Scene v, Lines 95-108). 

==Performance history==
''Romeo and Juliet'' was a popular play in Shakespeare's lifetime. Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare's plays, in the period after the death of [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] and [[Thomas Kyd|Kyd]] but before the ascendancy of [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]] during which Shakespeare was London's dominant playwright.<ref>Gary Taylor "Shakespeare Plays on Renaissance Stages" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.) "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage" (Cambridge University Press, 2002) p.18. The five more popular plays, in descending order, are [[Henry VI, Part 1]], [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]], [[Hamlet]] and [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]</ref>

After the theatres re-opened in the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Sir [[William Davenant]] staged a 1662 production in which [[Henry Harris]] played Romeo, [[Thomas Betterton]] was Mercutio, and Betterton's wife [[Mary Saunderson]] played Juliet.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} [[Thomas Otway]]'s adaptation ''The History and Fall of Caius Marius'', one of the more extreme of the Restoration versions of Shakespeare, debuted in 1679. The scene is shifted from Renaissance Verona to ancient Rome; Romeo is Marius, Juliet is Lavinia, the feud is between patricians and plebians; Juliet/Lavina wakes from her potion before Romeo/Marius dies. Otway's version was a hit, and was acted for the next seventy years. [[Theophilus Cibber]] mounted his own adaptation in 1744, followed by [[David Garrick]]'s in 1748. Both Cibber and Garrick used variations on Otway's innovation in the tomb scene.<ref>Jean I. Marsden "Shakespeare from the Restoration to Garrick" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.) "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage" (Cambridge University Press, 2002) pp.26-27</ref>

In 1750 came the so-called "''Romeo and Juliet'' War," with [[Spranger Barry]] and [[Susannah Maria Arne]] (Mrs. Theophilus Cibber) at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] versus [[David Garrick]] and [[George Anne Bellamy]] at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. Shakespeare's original returned to the stage in 1845 in the United States (with the sisters [[Charlotte Saunders Cushman|Charlotte]] and Susan Cushman as Romeo and Juliet),<ref>[[Charlotte Saunders Cushman]] played Romeo 54 years before [[Sarah Bernhardt]] played Hamlet.</ref><ref>Penny Gay "Women and Shakespearean Performance" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.) "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage" (Cambridge University Press, 2002) p.162</ref> and in 1847 in Britain ([[Samuel Phelps]] at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]]).<ref>F. E. Halliday, ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 125, 365, 420.</ref>

[[Henry Irving]]'s 1882 production at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] is considered an archetype of his "pictorial" style, placing the action on elaborate sets. Irving hmself played Romeo, and [[Ellen Terry]] played Juliet.<ref>Richard W. Scooch "Pictorial Shakespeare" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.) "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage" (Cambridge University Press, 2002) pp.62-63</ref>

In one of the most notable twentieth century performances, staged by [[John Gielgud]] at the [[NoÃ«l Coward Theatre|New Theatre]] in 1934, Gielgud and [[Laurence Olivier]] played the roles of Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six weeks into the run, with [[Peggy Ashcroft]] as Juliet.<ref>Robert Smallwood "Twentieth-century Performance" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.)

==Synopsis==
{{Spoiler}}
[[Image:Francesco_Hayez_053.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Romeo and Juliet'' by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]
The play begins with a 14-line [[prologue]] by a Chorus in the form of a [[Shakespearean sonnet]].
The Chorus explains to the audience that the story concerns two noble families of [[Verona]], the
Capulets and the Montagues, that have [[feud]]ed for generations. The prologue also explains that
the lovers' tragic suicides "bury their parents' strife."

The action proper starts with a street-battle between the two families' servants .  The Prince of [[Verona]], Escalus, finally intervenes with his men.  The Prince declares that the heads of the two families will be held personally accountable for any further breach of the peace, and disperses the crowd. 

[[Count Paris]], a young nobleman, talks to Capulet about marrying his thirteen-year-old daughter, [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]]. Capulet demurs, citing the girl's tender age, and invites him to attract the attention of Juliet during a [[Masquerade ball|ball]] that the family is to hold that night. Meanwhile Juliet's mother tries to persuade her young daughter to accept Paris' wooing during their coming ball. Young Juliet admits to not having considered marriage, but accedes to her mother's wishes as a dutiful daughter. This scene also introduces Juliet's nurse, the comic relief of the play.

Meantime, [[Benvolio]] queries Romeo, Montague's son, to find out the source of his melancholy, which lies in unrequited love of a girl named Rosaline (an [[unseen character]]), a Capulet. Despite the bad-natured taunts of nobleman and friend [[Mercutio]], Romeo decides to attend the masquerade at the Capulet house, in hope of meeting Rosaline.

With his masked friends Romeo attends the ball as planned, but falls instead for Juliet, and she with him. In the famous [[balcony scene]], the two eloquently declare their love for each other. This scene contains arguably the most famous line of Romeo and Juliet, "Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?" spoken by Juliet to the darkness ("wherefore" means "why" not "where" &mdash; Juliet is lamenting that Romeo is a Montague, and thus her enemy).
The young lovers decide to marry without informing their parents, with the Nurse as an intermediary.

With the help of the [[Franciscan]] [[Friar Lawrence]], who hoped to reconcile the two families through their children's union, the two are married that next day.

Events take a darker turn in Act Three. Tybalt, Juliet's hot-blooded cousin, challenges Romeo to a duel for appearing in the Capulets' ball disguised. Romeo refuses to fight Tybalt as they are now kinsmen by marriage, but Mercutio, Romeo's companion, who is also unaware of the marriage, is incensed by Tybalt's insolence and accepts instead. In the ensuing duel, Mercutio is fatally wounded when Romeo tries to intervene.  Romeo, angered by his friend's death, pursues and slays Tybalt, then flees. 

A grieving Prince proclaims his judgement: he fines the head of each house heavily, and [[exile]]s Romeo from Verona, in recognition that Tybalt had first killed Mercutio, who had not only been Romeo's friend but a kinsman of the Prince.

Meanwhile the Capulets had engaged their unwilling daughter to marry Paris in three days' time, threatening to disown her if she does not. The Nurse, once her confidante, tells Juliet she should discard the exiled Romeo and comply.
[[Image:Johann Heinrich FÃ¼ssli 060.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Romeo at Juliet's Deathbed, by [[Johann Heinrich FÃ¼ssli]]]]
Juliet visits Friar Lawrence and Friar Lawrence, comes up with a plan: he hands her a [[drug]] which will put her into a death-like coma for "two and forty hours" (Act IV. Scene I); she is to take it and when discovered apparently dead, she will be laid in the family crypt. Meanwhile, the Friar will send a messenger to inform Romeo, so that she can rejoin him when she awakes.
The enforced messenge does not reach Romeo, however, due to a [[plague]] quarantine. Romeo learns of Juliet's supposed "death" from his servant Balthasar. Grief-stricken, he buys strong poison from an apothecary, returns to Verona in secret, and visits the Capulets' crypt, encountering Paris, who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Romeo kills Paris in the darkness, regrets his decision, and then,  after seeing the comatose Juliet, drinks the poison in [[suicide]].

At this point Juliet awakes. Friar Lawrence arrives, and aware of the tragedies which ensue from misunderstanding, tries to convince Juliet to leave, but she refuses. Discovering a dead Romeo, she stabs herself fatally with his dagger.
 
The two feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb and are horrified to find three new casualties. A captured Friar Lawrence then recounts the love and secret marriage of Romeo and Juliet, and how the tragedies occured. It is revealed by Montague that his wife has died of grief after hearing of her son's exile, thus completing the cycle of two family members from each house being lost. The families are reconciled by their children's deaths and agree to end their violent feud, as foretold by the prologue. The play ends with the Prince's brief elegy for the lovers. {{endspoiler}}

==Adaptations and Cultural references==
===Plays===
[[Image:Romeo and Juliet.jpg|thumb|right|Romeo and Juliet statue in [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]].]]
Adaptations of Romeo and Juliet have used modern settings. For instance, a version of the play which had Romeo as a [[Palestinian]] and Juliet as a [[Jew]] in [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]] were made, which criticizes the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].<ref>Pape, Ilan. "Post-Zionist Critique on Israel and the Palestinians Part III: Popular Culture." ''Journal of Palestine Studies'' 26 (1997): 69.</ref> Similarly, versions have also been devised dealing with [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]], in which Romeo is black and Juliet is white.<ref>Quince, Rohan. ''Shakespeare in South Africa: Stage Productions During the Apartheid Era''. New York: Peter Lang, 2000: 121-125</ref>

A Native American version called "Kino and Teresa" was first produced in 2005 by Native Voices at the Autry in Los Angeles.  Written by James Lujan, the historical play was set in 17th Century Santa Fe, seventeen years after the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 and revolved around the conflict between the Pueblo Indians and Spanish colonists.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klugman|first=Deborah|url=http://www.laweekly.com/index.php?option=com_lsd&task=film&Itemid=109&id=81675|title=Kino and Teresa review|publisher=[[LA Weekly]]|accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>

''Romeo and Juliet'' has been adapted in many ways over the years quite subtly. It is the basis for many famous musicals, most famously ''[[West Side Story]]'' and more recently ''Disney's [[High School Musical]]''<ref>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=404621&in_page_id=1773</ref>.

===Opera===
The story was converted into the [[opera]] ''[[RomÃ©o et Juliette]]'' by [[Charles Gounod]] in [[1867]] with a [[libretto]] written by [[Jules Barbier]] and [[Michel CarrÃ©]].

The ''Romeo and Juliet'' story was also the subject of [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s opera ''[[I Capuleti e i Montecchi]]'', although Bellini and his librettist, [[Felice Romani]], worked from Italian sources, and these were only distantly related to Shakespeare's work.

In 2004 American composer [[Lee Hoiby]] also adapted ''Romeo and Juliet'' to write an opera of the same name.

"[[Butterfly Lovers]]", a [[Chinese Opera]], is commonly known as the Chinese version of Romeo and Juliet.

===Ballet===
Several [[ballet]] adaptations of the story have been made, the first written in the 18th century.  The best known feature music by [[Sergei Prokofiev]], and a variety of choreographers have used this music.  The first version featuring Prokofiev's music was performed in [[1938]].  See: [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)]]

===Musical===
The "[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture]]" (1869, revised 1870, 1880), by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Peter Tchaikovsky]], contains one of the world's most famous melodies. The tremendously famous love theme in the middle of this long symphonic poem has been used countless times in commercials and movies.

In 1957, the [[Musical theater|musical]] ''[[West Side Story]]'' debuted on Broadway, with music by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]]. This version of "Romeo and Juliet" updated the setting to mid-[[20th century]] [[New York City]] and the warring families to ethnic gangs. ''West Side Story'' opened on the West End in London in 1958 and then was released as a film in 1961. 

In 1999, [[Terrence Mann]]'s rock musical ''William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet'', co-written with Jerome Korman, premiered at the Ordway Theatre in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was not a critical success.

''[[RomÃ©o et Juliette, de la Haine Ã  l'Amour]]'', a musical by [[GÃ©rard Presgurvic]], premiered on January 19, 2001 in the Palais de CongrÃ¨s in Paris, France. By 2005, it had already attracted some six million people.

"[[Once on This Island]]" is another musical adaptation that takes on the Romeo and Juliet theme.  These star crossed lovers, Ti Moune and Daniel, were fated to love one another even with the pressures of their class and ethnic backgrounds upon them. However, it was only through death that they could be together.

====Film Adaptations====
*The film ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' was released in 1961 following the success of the musical on stage in New York and London. It was set in a 1960s [[New York City]] gang culture and was loosely based on the story of Romeo and Juliet, with the Montagues becoming the Jets and the Capulets becoming the Sharks.
*The film ''[[West Bank Story (film)|West Bank Story]]'' set, unsurprisingly, in the contemporary West Bank is a musical comedy parody based on West Side Story. West Bank Story won the 2006 best Live Action Short at the Academy Awards (Oscars).<ref>http://www.westbankstory.com/</ref>
*The film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' is a fictional account of how Shakespeare writes the play against the clock inspired by his love for a noble woman. The movie also describes the start of ''[[Twelfth Night]],'' inspired by the same woman's ultimate fate.
*[[Devdas]] transposes Romeo and Juliet into an Indian culture.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}
*[[Love Is All There Is]], starring Angelina Jolie and Lannie Kazan, is a comedic take on the tragic story. It takes place in the Bronx, New York and involves two Italian immigrant families who own opposing restaurants. The two families hate each other and have tried to run each other out of business for years. When their children secretly fall in love, the families are forced to deal with it. Instead of the tragic Shakespearean ending, the movie makes the story a bit more light-hearted.

===Television===
The Canadian-produced animated television special ''[[Romie-0 and Julie-8]]'' (1979) is a [[science fiction]] adaptation of the play, recasting the lead characters as robots.

The 2005 television movie "[[Pizza My Heart]]" is also based on ''Romeo and Juliet''. This story takes place in Verona, New Jersey and is centered around the lives of two feuding pizzeria owners, the Prestolanis and the Montebellos.

The [[Japan]]ese animation studio [[Gonzo (studio)|Gonzo]] has adapted ''Romeo and Juliet'' into an [[anime]] television series entitled ''[[Romeo x Juliet]]'', the very first of its kind. Set in a dystopian world on a supernatural, aerial city known as Neo Verona, the series premiered from April 2007.

===Documentaries===
"[[Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo]]" - Though the âstoryâ does not bear much resemblance to that of the original Shakespearean play, the characters and outcome are quite similar. The characters in both the play and the film (Romeo and Juliet and Admira and BoÅ¡ko) simply want to live their lives and be allowed to love one another, yet are tragically prevented from doing so, instead succumbing to an untimely death.
