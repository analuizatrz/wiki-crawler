{{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy VII'''''|ファイナルファンタジーVII|Fainaru Fantajī Sebun}} is a [[console role-playing game]] developed and published by [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]), and the seventh installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' video game series. It was released in [[1997 in video gaming|1997]] and is the first numbered ''Final Fantasy'' game for the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation]] [[video game console]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]-based [[personal computer]]s; it is also the first to use [[3D computer graphics]]<ref name="development5">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly | title=Electronic Gaming Monthly October 2005; issue 196 | pages=104|language=English|publisher=Ziff Davis Media Inc.}}</ref> featuring fully rendered characters on [[pre-rendered]] backgrounds.<ref name="ignreview">{{cite web | author=IGN staff | year=1997 | title=Final Fantasy VII Review | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150494p1.html | work=[http://ign.com/ IGN] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="gamespotreview">{{cite web | author=Kasavin, Greg | year=1997 | title=Final Fantasy VII for PlayStation Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasy7/review.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="egmreview">{{cite web | author=Editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly | year=2004 | url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=2016960&did=2 | title=Final Fantasy VII PS Review | work=[http://1up.com/ 1UP.com] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The game's story centers on a group of adventurers as they battle a powerful [[Megacorp|mega corporation]] called "[[Shin-Ra|Shinra]]", which is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. As the story progresses, conflicts escalate and the world's safety becomes a major concern.

A major critical and commercial success, the game remains arguably the most popular title in the series,<ref>{{cite video | year=2007 | date=August 13 | url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/23449.html | title=Final Fantasy Retrospective Part V | medium=GameTrailers.com feature | publisher=[http://www.gametrailers.com/ GameTrailers.com]}}</ref><ref name="mainstream">{{cite web | date=October , 2003 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200310/ai_ziff109006 | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children | work=[http://www.findarticles.com/ Find Articles]; originally published in [http://1up.com/ 1UP] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="mainstream2">{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-08-29-dirge-of-cerberus_x.htm | title='Dirge of Cerberus' defies expectations, for better and worse | work=[http://www.usatoday.com/ USA TODAY] | accessmonthday=30 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="GamespostBestAllTime">{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/index.html | title='The greatest games of all time" | accessmonthday=30 Nov | accessyear=2007}}</ref> and is often credited with allowing console-style RPGs to achieve mainstream success outside [[Japan]].<ref name="mainstream" /> The ongoing popularity of the title led Square Enix to produce a series of [[sequel]]s and [[prequel]]s under the collective title "''[[Final Fantasy VII#Related media and merchandise|Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]''". As of September 2004, ''Final Fantasy VII'' has sold more than 9.5 million copies worldwide, earning it the position of the best-selling ''Final Fantasy'' title.<ref>{{cite web | year=[[May 5]] [[2005]] | url=http://www.square-enix.com/na/company/press/2005/05152005/| title=SQUARE ENIX ANNOUNCES RELEASE DATE OF FINAL FANTASY® VII ADVENT CHILDREN™|accessmonthday=12 July | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:FFVIIfieldmapexample.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Navigation on a town's field map]]

Like previous installments of the ''Final Fantasy'' series, ''Final Fantasy VII'' consists of three basic gameplay modes: an [[overworld]] map, town and [[Dungeon (games)|dungeon]] field maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down simplified version of the game's [[fictional universe|fictional world]],<ref name="ignreview" /><ref name="travel">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=15, 44–46 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts|language=English|id=SCUS-94163}}</ref> which the player navigates to travel between the game's locations. It is the first ''Final Fantasy'' game to have character models with fully-rendered polygons, rather than flat two-dimensional sprites. As with the preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, by [[chocobo]], by [[Final Fantasy airships#Final Fantasy VII|airship]], or by other means of transportation.<ref name="travel" /> On field maps, the game's 3D [[player character|playable characters]] are directed across realistically scaled environments, consisting of [[2D computer graphics|2D]] pre-rendered backgrounds that represent locations such as towns or forests.<ref name="ignreview" /> The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area such as a building interior or grassland, in which the player commands the game's characters in battles against [[central processing unit|CPU]]-controlled enemies through a menu-driven interface.<ref name="ignreview" /><ref name="menuinterface">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=20–25 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SCUS-94163}}</ref> While characters are miniaturised on maps, in combat their renderings are more realistic and normal-scaled.

Initially, the player is restricted to travel within a single city, but as the game continues, more areas become accessible, and the scripted adventure sequences gradually yield more freedom to explore.<ref name="travel" /> Progression through the game's storyline is largely developed by way of scripted sequences, which cannot be skipped, and require frequent player interaction to proceed. At other times, pre-rendered cinematic [[cut scene]]s advance the story.

===Combat===
During its turn-based battle sequences, the game uses the same [[Square Enix battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]] and first featured in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Unlike previous games in the series, which allow 4–5 playable characters to participate in battle, ''Final Fantasy VII'' allows for only up to three characters to be present in the party at any one time.<ref name="ignreview" />[[Image:FFVIIbattlexample.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A battle in ''Final Fantasy VII'']]

''Final Fantasy VII''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Statistic (role-playing games)#Skills|skill system]] is built around the use of [[materia]], magical orbs that are placed in special slots on weapons and armor, allowing players to customize their characters' access to [[Final Fantasy magic|magic spells]], summons, and special abilities. In addition to their individual traits, materia can be used together in a fixed number of ways to enhance their effects or produce other abilities.<ref name="materiause">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=35 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SCUS-94163}}</ref><ref name="materiause2">{{cite book | author=Cassady, David | year=1997 | title=Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide | pages=5–7 | publisher=Brady Publishing | language=English | id=ISBN 1-56686-714-2}}</ref>

A modified form of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'''s [[Limit Breaks#Final Fantasy VI|Desperation Attack]]s appears here as the [[Limit Break#Final Fantasy VII|Limit Break]].<ref name="Khosla">{{cite web | author=Khosla, Sheila | year=2003 | title=Tetsuya Nomura 20s | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&more=1 | work=[http://flaregamer.com/ FLAREgamer]|accessmonthday=April 13 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> Every playable character has a bar that gradually fills up when they suffer damage in battle. When the bar is completely filled, the character is able to unleash his or her Limit Break, a special attack which generally inflicts significantly more damage on enemies than normal attacks, or otherwise aids the party in battle.<ref name="ignreview" /><ref name="menuinterface" /> Character designer and battle director [[Tetsuya Nomura]] implemented this advanced form of Desperation Attacks in response to the low probability of their occurrence in ''Final Fantasy VI'', where they would randomly become available as an attack substitution only when a character's [[hit point]]s (a numerically based [[life bar]]) were low.<ref name="Khosla" />

Nomura decided to incorporate elaborately animated [[Final Fantasy magic#Summon Magic|summon spells]] in the game, one of which lasts more than a minute.<ref name="Khosla" /> This idea became popular with ''Final Fantasy'' fans, and they were incorporated into the development of future games in the series.<ref name="Khosla" /> However, critics have described these animations as tedious.<ref name="summons">{{Cite book | year=2001 | editor=Kennedy, Sam & Steinman, Gary | title=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine August 2001; issue 47 | pages=98 | language=English | publisher=Ziff Davis Media Inc.}}</ref>

The game's setting follows in the footsteps of ''Final Fantasy VI'' by presenting a world with considerably more advanced technology than the first five games in the series.

Shinra's major military base, Junon, is also located on the continent, along with a chocobo ranch and a small town called Kalm.

The [[List of Final Fantasy VII locations#Western continent|western continent]] features most of the playable areas, which include the Gold Saucer(an amusement park), a seaside resort, and a settlement constructed on a plateau called "Cosmo Canyon". The tribe inhabiting the canyon places a strong emphasis on living in harmony with nature and dedicate great consideration to the planet's well-being.<ref name="cosmo">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=217 | language=Japanese|publisher=Square Enix|id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> Their settlement features an [[observatory]] and serves as a research facility for those who wish to participate in a philosophy known as "the Study of Planet Life", an environmentally conscious way of life that encourages utmost deference for nature, and teaches that the planet has a life of its own.<ref name="cosmo" /> The [[List of Final Fantasy VII locations#Northern continent|northernmost continent]] is a heavily [[glacier|glaciated]] wasteland covered in snow and ice, with its few settlements largely concerned with excavation or research. It does, however, feature a ski resort. There are also underwater locations accessible via submarine.

All of the game's main characters have had significant ties to the Shinra Company in their past, and all harbor disapproval or outright hatred for the corporation and its activities. Although the antagonists for the first portion of the game are the [[List of Final Fantasy VII characters#Executives|Shinra executives]], a mysterious man named "[[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]]" — once hailed as the greatest SOLDIER — reappears several years after disappearing in a battle in which he was concluded to have died.<ref name="sephiroth">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=10 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SCUS-94163}}</ref><ref name="sephiroth2">'''Aeris:''' What happened to Sephiroth? / '''Cloud:''' In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him. / '''Tifa:''' Official records state Sephiroth is dead.

The game's character designer, Tetsuya Nomura, has expressed feeling that ''Final Fantasy VII'' was hindered by graphical limitations, and that his designs were, consequently, very plain in comparison to his "true" style.<ref name="Khosla" /> However, he was able to find other means of expressing some of his ideas. Cloud's original character design called for slicked back black hair with no spikes, intended to serve as a contrast to Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair. To give Cloud a unique feature that would emphasize his role in the game as the main character, Nomura changed the design to feature Cloud's now trademark shock of spiky, bright blond hair.<ref name="Khosla" /> For Tifa's design, Nomura has admitted to facing a difficult decision in choosing to give her a miniskirt or pants. With input from other members of the game's development staff, he eventually selected a dark miniskirt, contrasted by Aeris' long, pink dress.<ref name="Khosla" />

Vincent's character developed from horror researcher to detective, then to chemist, and finally to the figure of a former Turk with a tragic past. It has been explained that his crimson mantle was added to symbolize the idea of carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders associated with death. Nomura has indicated that Cid Highwind's fighting style resembles that of a [[Dragon Knight (character class)|Dragon Knight]], a [[character class]] so chosen because his last name is the same as that of two previous Dragon Knights featured in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, [[Characters of Final Fantasy II#Ricard Highwind|Ricard Highwind]] of ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' and [[Kain Highwind]] of ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''.<ref name="Khosla" />

Due to their popularity, several characters from the game have made [[cameo appearance]]s in other Square Enix titles, most notably the [[Versus fighting game|fighting game]] ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'' and the popular ''Final Fantasy''-[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] crossover series ''Kingdom Hearts''. Sephiroth remains one of the most popular villains in video game history, [[Unanimity|unanimously]] voted #1 by the staff of [[video game magazine|gaming publication]] ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' in their "Top 10 [[boss (video games)|Video Game Bosses]]" list in October 2005.<ref name="sephboss1">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Editors of EGM magazine | title=Electronic Gaming Monthly October, 2005 | pages=72–73 | language=English | publisher=Ziff Davis Media}}</ref> During spring of the same year, the character won [[GameFAQs]]' best villain contest.<ref name="gamefaqs">{{cite web | author=GameFAQs Site Staff | year=2005 | title=GameFAQs - Spring 2005: Got Villains? | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/spr05 | work=[http://www.gamefaqs.com/ GameFAQs] | accessmonthday=January 3 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===Story===
''Final Fantasy VII'' begins with Cloud joining [[AVALANCHE]] in a raid on one of eight Mako reactors that surround the city of Midgar. The Mako reactor is destroyed and the group makes their way back to their base. During their next mission at another reactor, AVALANCHE is trapped by [[List of Final Fantasy VII characters#President Shinra|President Shinra]] before they can escape. Although they defeat the Shinra's machine, the reactor's explosion sends Cloud flying from the upper levels of Midgar into the slums below. Falling through the roof of a derelict church in Sector 5, he lands on a flower bed unharmed, where he is formally introduced to Aeris.<ref name="secondmeetingwithaeris">'''Aeris:''' You okay? This is a church in the Sector 5 slums. [You] suddenly fell on top of me.

You're lucky. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Cloud agrees to work for Aeris as her bodyguard, an agreement prompted by the arrival of operatives of the Shinra Company's Turks organization, who have been ordered to capture Aeris.<ref name="secondmeetingwithaerith">'''Aeris:''' Say, Cloud. Have you ever been a bodyguard?

After Cloud defends Aeris from her would-be kidnappers, Aeris offers to show him the way back to Sector 7. Along the way, she reveals that her first boyfriend had been a 1<sup>st</sup> Class SOLDIER, as Cloud claims to have been. The two spot Tifa entering Wall Market, an area of Sector 6 infamous for criminal activity, to which they follow her.

As the only remaining members of AVALANCHE, Tifa, Barret and Cloud infiltrate Shinra's headquarters to rescue Aeris. After freeing her and Red XIII, who joins the party, they escape when most of the personnel in the building — including President Shinra — are killed. Finding the body of the president skewered by a long sword, Cloud suspects a man called Sephiroth who has returned from his presumed death. These suspicions are confirmed by an executive spared during the massacre, who claims to have witnessed Sephiroth murder the president and state that he would never allow Shinra to claim the Promised Land.<ref name="sephirothreturns">'''Cloud:''' Did you see him?

While [[Rufus Shinra]], the president's son, assumes control of the Shinra Company, AVALANCHE pursues Sephiroth across the planet, fearing his intentions for the Promised Land may be more destructive than Shinra's. During this pursuit, the party is joined by Yuffie, Cait Sith, Vincent and Cid. As the journey progresses, each member of the group must come to terms with personal conflicts from their past, and the full scope of Sephiroth's plan is eventually revealed to the player: if the planet is significantly damaged, the Lifestream within will gather at the point of injury, attempting to heal the wound. Sephiroth explains that he intends to use a powerful spell known as "[[Materia#Meteor|Meteor]]" to fatally injure the planet, inciting a reaction in the Lifestream to heal the wound before it can cause the planet's destruction. Entering the fissure created by the meteor's impact, Sephiroth would merge with all the energy of the planet, granting him god-like power over it.<ref name="agodtorule">'''Aeris:''' How do you intend to become one with the Planet? / '''Sephiroth:''' It's simple.

Meteor. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> At an ancient temple erected by the Cetra, AVALANCHE attempts to undermine Sephiroth's plot by claiming the [[Materia#Black materia|Black Materia]] needed to activate Meteor, but Sephiroth displays a mysterious power over Cloud, forcing him to relinquish it.

Fearing that Sephiroth may cast Meteor, and having gained a greater understanding of her heritage from scholars in Cosmo Canyon and the memories of her ancestors in the Cetra's temple, Aeris sets off to stop him on her own. Concerned for her safety, AVALANCHE follows her to the northern continent, where the player must enter an ancient Cetra city. After finding Aeris praying to the planet for aid, Sephiroth, unseen, begins affecting Cloud's behavior once again, and attempts to force him to kill her. Cloud resists Sephiroth's command, but Sephiroth himself appears and kills Aeris.<ref name="sephboss1" /><ref name="development3">{{Cite book | year=2003 | editor=Editors of Edge magazine | title=Edge May 2003; issue 123 | pages=108–113 | language=English | publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref> After laying her body to rest, the surviving characters resolve to defeat Sephiroth and avenge her.

Later, Sephiroth begins causing Cloud to doubt his memories and insists that he is not a real human, but rather a specimen created from Jenova's genetic material by [[List of Final Fantasy VII characters#Professor Hojo|Professor Hojo]]. Jenova, the player learns, was an interstellar creature who crashlanded on the planet approximately two thousand years earlier, arriving via travel on a meteor. This collision formed a large [[impact crater]], grievously harming the planet.<ref name="meteor">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=214, 587 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref><ref name="meteor2">'''Ifalna:''' 2000 years ago, our ancestors, the Cetra, heard the cries of the Planet.

Attempting to defend itself, the planet created giant monsters called "[[WEAPON (Final Fantasy)#Final Fantasy VII|WEAPON]]s", while the majority of humans fled rather than fight Jenova. However, a small group of Cetra survivors fought to defend the planet and managed to defeat Jenova, confining it within the fissure created by its landing.<ref name="defense">'''Ifalna:''' A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova, and confined it. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Afterward, the WEAPONs entered hibernation to await any future threat that could harm the planet. Eventually, the mummified remains of Jenova would be unearthed by [[List of Final Fantasy VII characters#Professor Gast|Professor Gast]], a researcher for the Shinra Company. Mistaking the creature for a Cetra, Gast was given authorization to conduct an experiment to artificially produce a Cetra by combining cells from Jenova with the fetus of an unborn child.<ref name="jenova" />

Five years before the present-day events seen by the player, Sephiroth learned that he was the product of this experiment while on a Shinra mission in Nibelheim, the hometown of Cloud and Tifa. However, unaware of all details involved, he concluded that he was a Cetra who had been produced solely from Jenova's genetic material. Enraged, he burned down the town, intending to kill all descendants of those he believed had abandoned his ancestors in the defense of the planet. According to Cloud, he confronted Sephiroth during this massacre, after which  Sephiroth vanished under unknown circumstances and was presumed dead until his reappearance in the Shinra building. When AVALANCHE reaches the Northern Crater, Sephiroth tells Cloud that he was not in Nibelheim, showing him images of a 1<sup>st</sup> Class SOLDIER with dark hair who occupies Cloud's place in his memories.<ref name="puppet">'''Cloud:''' Sephiroth! I know you're listening! I know what you want to say! That I wasn't in Nibelheim five years ago. That's it, isn't it? / '''Sephiroth:''' I see you finally understand. / '''Cloud:''' But, I want to ask you one thing. Why... why are you doing this? / '''Sephiroth:''' Ha, ha, ha...... I want to take you back to your real self. The one who gave me the Black Materia that day... Who would have ever thought a failed experiment would prove so useful? Hojo would die if he knew. / '''Cloud:''' Hojo!? What does he have to do with me!? / '''Sephiroth:''' Five years ago you were... ...constructed by Hojo, piece by piece, right after Nibelheim was burnt. A puppet made up of vibrant Jenova cells, her knowledge, and the power of Mako. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> With Tifa unable to refute Sephiroth's claims, Cloud breaks down and allows him to cast Meteor, resulting in the WEAPONs' awakening. During the earthquake that follows, Cloud is separated from his companions and falls into the Lifestream.

As the meteor summoned by Sephiroth slowly approaches the planet, the Shinra Company focuses its efforts on protecting humanity from the WEAPONs,<ref name="defendingtheplanet" /> who have begun to perceive everything as a threat to the planet. Meanwhile, AVALANCHE searches for Cloud, eventually locating him on a tropical resort island where he washed up following the casting of Meteor; he is in a [[catatonia|catatonic]] state. The WEAPONs' destructive activity quickly causes the island to split open, depositing Cloud and Tifa into the Lifestream below. There, she reconstructs Cloud's memories and learns the truth about his past. Although the player learns that he is a real human being and had actually been in Nibelheim during Sephiroth's attack, he never actually succeeded in joining SOLDIER and only managed to attain the rank of [[Private (rank)|private]] in Shinra's military. The player learns that the previously-seen dark-haired SOLDIER is named "[[Zack Fair|Zack]]", and was Aeris' first boyfriend. During Sephiroth's destruction of Nibelheim, Zack, Tifa and Cloud fought Sephiroth in Nibelheim's Mako reactor. Although Tifa and Zack were defeated, Cloud and Sephiroth severely wounded one another. After decapitating the body of Jenova, which had been stored in the Mako reactor, Sephiroth is thrown into the Lifestream by Cloud, taking the creature's head with him. Rather than dying, however, his body and consciousness were preserved in Mako inside Jenova's crater.

While Tifa was taken to safety in Midgar, Cloud and Zack were among the wounded survivors who were apprehended by Shinra as part an elaborate [[cover-up]] of Sephiroth's massacre. Professor Hojo subjected these survivors to an experiment, in which he performed the same enhancements given to members of SOLDIER. However, because Hojo conducted the experiment without any concern for the subjects' mental capacities to handle the procedure, all but Zack entered a [[coma]]tose state. Nearly five years later, Zack broke free from his confinement and took Cloud with him. The player learns that the procedure used to enhance members of SOLDIER involved both Mako showers and the injection of cells from Jenova. The alien cells inhabiting Cloud's body allowed his mind to construct a false persona, built around Zack's behavior, fighting style, and description of Sephiroth's destruction in Nibelheim, but they also allowed Sephiroth to modulate his behavior. The cells' inherent ability to duplicate information led Cloud to believe that he had been the 1<sup>st</sup> Class SOLDIER in Nibelheim, as Zack was shot and killed outside Midgar by pursuing Shinra soldiers, shortly before the beginning of the game. Afterward, Tifa discovered Cloud, who was wearing Zack's spare uniform, and offered him a job with AVALANCHE.<ref name="jenova" />

With the truth revealed, Cloud awakens and rejoins AVALANCHE. The player learns that, in her final moments, Aeris was casting a spell known as "[[Materia#Holy|Holy]]", the only means of opposing Meteor. Though she succeeds, Sephiroth's focused will prevents the spell from taking effect and has been restraining it since. Deciding that humanity must be protected from the WEAPONs before Sephiroth can be approached, Shinra and AVALANCHE destroy the WEAPONs, but nearly all of Shinra's executives are killed in the process. Among the few survivors are [[List of Final Fantasy VII characters#Reeve Tuesti|Reeve Tuesti]], revealed to be the repentant controller of Cait Sith,<ref name="reeve">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=57 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> and Professor Hojo, who is revealed to be Sephiroth's father. He explains that he and his wife were assistants to Professor Gast, and offered up their unborn child as a test subject to research involving Jenova.<ref name="jenova" /><ref name="wife">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=198 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> When Hojo attempts to help Sephiroth to gain mastery over the Lifestream afterward, AVALANCHE is given no choice but to fight and kill him.

With each member of AVALANCHE at peace with his or her past and all other opponents defeated, the group travels through the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] of the planet to its core, where they defeat Sephiroth and free Holy. However, due to Meteor's already close proximity to the planet's surface, Holy is unable to destroy it alone. Selected as Meteor's target, Midgar is almost completely destroyed by the storms that spawn from its presence. However, sent by Aeris' spirit, the Lifestream itself rises from the planet to aid Holy by pushing Meteor away, allowing Holy to destroy it.<ref name="aerithsavestheday">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=591 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> During the epilogue that follows, the ruins of Midgar are shown five hundred years later. While the landscape had once been desolate due to Shinra's operations, it is now a land of lush greenery.

Development of ''Final Fantasy VII'' began in late [[1995 in video gaming|1995]],<ref name="development3">{{Cite book | year=2003 | editor=Editors of Edge magazine | title=Edge May 2003; issue 123 | pages=108–113 | language=English | publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref><ref name="development">{{cite web | author=The Final Fantasy VII Citadel site staff | year=2005 | title=Hironobu Sakaguchi Interview | url=http://www.ff7citadel.com/press/int_sakaguchi.shtml | work=[http://www.ff7citadel.com/ The Final Fantasy VII Citadel] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and required the efforts of more than one hundred artists and programmers<ref name="development" /><ref name="development2">{{cite web | author=Vestal, Andrew | year=1998 | title=The History of Final Fantasy | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec1_7_2.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> using such software as [[PowerAnimator]] and [[Softimage|Softimage|3D]],<ref name="development3" /> and a budget of approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]45 million. ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s co-director and scenario writer, Yoshinori Kitase, returned to direct and co-write this installment of the series and expressed a concern that the franchise might be left behind if it did not catch up to the [[3D computer graphics]] used in other games at the time.<ref name="development5" /> Development then began after the development of a short, experimental [[technology demo]] for [[Silicon Graphics]] Onyx workstations.<ref name="development" />

Called "[[Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game|Final Fantasy SGI]]", the demo featured [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]]-based 3D renderings of characters from ''Final Fantasy VI'' in a [[real-time (media)|real-time]] battle and incorporated interactive elements.<ref name="development" /><ref name="development6">{{cite web | author=Sutherland, Kenny | year=2003 | title=Elusions: Final Fantasy 64 | url=http://www.lostlevels.org/200510/ | work=[http://www.lostlevels.org/ LostLevels] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="development7">{{cite web | author=RPGamer site staff | title=Final Fantasy SGI Demo | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/affw/ffsgi.html | work=[http://www.rpgamer.com/ RPGamer]|accessmonthday=August 10 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> This experiment led the development team to decide to integrate these design mechanics into ''Final Fantasy VII''.<ref name="development" /> However, as a result of the high quantity of memory storage required to implement the motion data, 3D models and [[computer graphics]] effects involved, it was decided that only the [[CD-ROM]] format would be able to suit the project's needs.<ref name="development3" /><ref name="development" /><ref name="development6" /> [[Nintendo]], for whom Square had developed all previous titles in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, had decided to continue to use [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]]s for their upcoming [[Nintendo 64]] console. This eventually led to a dispute and as a result, Square eventually decided to end their long, often tumultuous, relationship with Nintendo and announced on [[January 12]], [[1996 in video gaming|1996]] that they would be developing ''Final Fantasy VII'' for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]] system.<ref name="development3" /><ref name="development6" />

In 1996, a demonstration disc was released to those who attended [[Tokyo Game Show]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Tuulisti |url=http://www.tuulisti.com/ff_misc.htm |title=Miscellaneous |accessdate = 2007-08-01 |work=[http://www.tuulisti.com/ Tuulisti’s Final Fantasy FFVII Collectibles Website]}}</ref> This disc, called ''Square's Preview Extra'', contained the earliest playable demo of ''Final Fantasy VII'' as well as the 1995 Siggraph demonstration called ''[[Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game|Final Fantasy SGI]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://208.109.211.60/bn_inf.php?type=promo&l=j&id=1387 |title=ファイナルファンタジー?

===Changes from past installments===
The transition from [[2D computer graphics]] to 3D environments overlaid on [[pre-rendered]] backgrounds<ref name="ignreview" /><ref name="gamespotreview" /><ref name="egmreview" /> was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation, which challenged the development team. According to Kitase, "Right from the time the decision to go with CD was made he <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Game producer|producer]] [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]]] set down a ground rule for the team saying, 'If the player becomes aware of the access times, we have failed'", demanding that an immersive atmosphere be upheld, which led to the programming of various animations to activate while the game loaded data.<ref name="development3" /> While the extra storage capacity and computer graphics to which the team now had access gave them the means to implement more than 40 minutes of [[full motion video]] movies<ref name="development3" /> — an unprecedented undertaking in the genre at the time<ref name="development3" /> — this innovation brought with it the added difficulty of ensuring that the inferiority of the in-game graphics in comparison to the FMV sequences was not too obvious. Kitase has described the process of making the in-game environments as detailed as possible to be "a daunting task".<ref name="development3" />

Among the difficulties faced was the potential inability to render 3D polygon models based on the designs of [[Yoshitaka Amano]], the series' long-time character designer. As his style was considered too exquisite to be compatible with the visual format of the project, this issue was addressed by bringing Tetsuya Nomura onboard as the project's main artist, while Amano aided in the design of the game's world map. Previously a monster designer for ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'',<ref name="nomurain">{{cite web | date=September , 2005 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zdoup/is_200509/ai_n14800453 | title=Nomura | work=[http://www.findarticles.com/ Find Articles]; originally published in [http://opm.1up.com/ Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]|accessmonthday=August 10 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> Nomura's style was more reminiscent of [[manga]], and considered easier to adapt. Another problem faced during development was a rushed production schedule. Veteran series [[composer]] [[Nobuo Uematsu]] commented in the liner notes of [[Final Fantasy VII Original Sound Track|the game's soundtrack]]: "There is one thing common in all the ''Final Fantasy'' games. None of them are complete". Despite delaying the game's release from December 1996 to January 1997, several additions to gameplay and story needed to be made for the game's North American release,<ref name="gamespotreview" /> prompting a rerelease in Japan under the title "''Final Fantasy VII International''".  

===Design and inspirations===
Art director [[Yusuke Naora]] refers to the game's atmosphere as "strong [and] dark",<ref name="development8">{{cite web | author=Coxon, Sachi | year=1998 | title=Interview with Yoshinori Kitase, Tetsuya Nomura and Yusuke Naora | url=http://members.tripod.com/PlayStationJapan/main.html | work=[http://members.tripod.com/PlayStationJapan/main.html PlayStation Japan] | accessmonthday=July 15 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> achieved through lighting effects that he considers "the darkest of darkest",<ref name="development9">{{cite web | author=Final Fantasy Shrine site staff | title=Final Fantasy VIII Kitase, Nojima, Naora and Nomura Interview | url=http://www.ffshrine.org/ff8/ff8_interview.php | work=[http://www.ffshrine.org/ Final Fantasy Shrine] | accessmonthday=July 15 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and a story that emphasised realism while drawing on a variety of myths, legends, and religious and philosophical systems to "[use] as a framework for loftier ethical aspirations and ecologically conscious evangelism".<ref name="development5" /><ref name="development3" /> These concepts were reflected in names, such as "Sephiroth",<ref name="sephname">{{Cite book | year=1997 | editor=Famitsu | title=Final Fantasy VII Kaitai Shinsho | pages=26 | language=Japanese | publisher=Famitsu | id=ISBN 4-7577-0098-9}}</ref> Cloud's personal conflicts, the permanence of Aeris' death and the plot element of the Lifestream.<ref name="development3" /><ref name="development5" /> Tetsuya Nomura has explained that, during the early stages of development, the game was to have featured only Cloud, Barret and Aeris, with the intention that one of the three would die.<ref name="development5" /> Feeling that Cloud could not die due to his leading role and that the death of characters such as Barret was already too great a cliché in the ''Final Fantasy'' series and fiction in general, he expressed frustration with the frequent presentation of death in fiction as an awe-inspiring, often romantic idea centered around sacrifice and resurrection. As a result, he suggested that Aeris die and not return, believing the audience would not expect such a development and that it would emphasise the sudden, harsh, and irreversible nature of death.<ref name="development5" /><ref name="development3" /> Alternatively, Sakaguchi based the philosophy of the Lifestream on ideas from cultures who believe in an invisible, inextinguishable energy that permeates planets and all life upon them, and was given its in-game representation by Kitase.<ref name="development3" />

Members of the development team have revealed that they intended some aspects of the game's story to be left open to the interpretation of individual players.<ref name="Khosla" /><ref name="opentointerpretation">{{cite web | author=Final Fantasy Insider site staff | year=2005 | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Interview - Conducted by GanGan | url=http://www.ffinsider.net/advent-children/interview3.php | work=[http://www.ffinsider.net/ Final Fantasy Insider] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="sheila2">{{cite web | author=Khosla, Sheila | year=2005 | title=The Second Coming | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=109&more=1 | work=[http://flaregamer.com/ FLAREgamer] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Scenario writer [[Kazushige Nojima]] has explained that he intended players to feel encouraged to speculate about what Cloud might be thinking in certain situations rather than be provided with actual insight into what he felt.<ref name="scifisetting" /><ref name="development3" /> The game's ending left the fate of the characters ambiguous until the release of ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children]]'' in 2005,<ref name="development12">{{Cite book | year=2001 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy X Ultimania Ω | pages=191 | language=Japanese | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-88787-021-3}}</ref><ref name="rpgamer">{{cite web | author=Alley, Jake | title=Final Fantasy VII - Review | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff7/reviews/ff7strev1.html | work=[http://www.rpgamer.com/ RPGamer] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> but the ultimate fate of humanity remained unclear nonetheless. At the time of ''Advent Children''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, Kitase suggested that the game's epilogue may signify the extinction of human beings.<ref name="development5" /> However, Nomura has since stated that the game's final scene symbolizes humans living in harmony with nature,<ref name="development13">{{Cite book | year=2006 | editor=Watanabe, Yukari | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children - Reunion Files - | pages=105 | language=Japanese|publisher=SoftBank|id=ISBN 4-7973-3498-3}}</ref> and Square has provided explanations for other details of the game's plot with the publication of the ''Final Fantasy VII [[Ultimania]] Ω'' guidebook.

===North American release===
The game's release in North America was preceded by a massive three month marketing campaign for which Sony allocated a US$100 million budget. The high-profile campaign consisted of three 30-second television commercials on major networks, a holiday promotion with [[Pepsi]], and printed ads in publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'', ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'' and [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC]].<ref name="development14">{{cite web | date=August , 1997 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_August_27/ai_19701566 | title=PlayStation's Final Fantasy VII Marketing Blitz Continues | work=[http://www.findarticles.com/ Find Articles]; originally published in [http://www.businesswire.com/ Business wire] | accessmonthday=10 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="development15">{{cite web | author=Final Fantasy Shrine site staff | title=Final Fantasy 7 Commercial Screenshots | url=http://www.ffshrine.org/ff7/ff7_commercial1_page1.php | work=[http://www.ffshrine.org/ Final Fantasy Shrine]|accessmonthday=August 10 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> In 1998, ''Final Fantasy VII'' was [[porting|ported]] to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[personal computer|PC]]s.

==Music==
{{main|Music of Final Fantasy VII}}
The soundtrack for ''Final Fantasy VII'' was composed by [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. Instead of recorded music and sound effects for the game, Uematsu opted for [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]]s, using the PlayStation's own internal [[sound chip]]. He has explained that he chose this method because it allowed the console's CPU to process audio data more quickly, which in turn allowed it to focus more on processing the game's 3D engine and to prevent noticeable load times. The game was originally intended to feature a [[vocal music|vocal piece]], but this was cut due to the limitations imposed by recorded audio. However, a song with full choral backing is heard in "[[One-Winged Angel]]".

The game's soundtrack was commercially released on four [[compact disc]]s;<ref name="soundtrack">{{cite web | author=Square Enix North America site staff | title=SQUARE ENIX MUSIC | url=http://na.square-enix.com/music/tunes/ff7.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060717233408/http://na.square-enix.com/music/tunes/ff7.html | archivedate=2006-07-17 | work=[http://na.square-enix.com/ Square Enix North America] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="soundtrack2">{{cite web | author=Schweitzer, Ben & Gann, Patrick | title=Final Fantasy VII OST | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ost/index.html | work=[http://www.rpgfan.com/ RPGFan]|accessmonthday=August 10 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> a single-disc album of selected tracks from the Original Soundtrack and three selected [[arrangement|arranged]] tracks, entitled "''[[Final Fantasy VII: Reunion Tracks]]''", was released separately.<ref name="reuniontracks">{{cite web | author=Square Enix North America site staff | title=SQUARE ENIX MUSIC | url=http://na.square-enix.com/music/tunes/reunion.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061109062521/http://na.square-enix.com/music/tunes/reunion.html | archivedate=2006-11-09 | work=[http://na.square-enix.com/ Square Enix North America] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="reuniontracks2">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick  | title=Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7reunion/index.html | work=[http://www.rpgfan.com/ RPGFan] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> A piano-only arrangement of selected tracks has also been produced,<ref name="pianotracks">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick  | title=Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7piano/index.html | work=[http://www.rpgfan.com/ RPGFan] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and several remixed versions of tracks from the game have surfaced in subsequent Square productions, including ''Final Fantasy VII Advent Children''<ref name="actracks">{{cite web | author=Castro Juan | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children | url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/656/656519p2.html | work=[http://ign.com/ IGN] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="actracks2">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick  | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children OST | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ac/index.html | work=[http://www.rpgfan.com/ RPGFan] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and ''Kingdom Hearts''.<ref name="khtracks">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick  | title=Kingdom Hearts -Final Mix- Additional Tracks | url=http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/khfm/index.html | work=[http://www.rpgfan.com/ RPGFan] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Final Fantasy VII'' was both a critical and commercial success, and set several sales records. Within three days of its January 1997 release in Japan, the game had sold 2.3 million copies. This popularity inspired thousands of retailers in North America to break [[street date]]s in September to meet public demand for the title.<ref name="streetdates">{{cite web | date=September , 1997 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_Sept_4/ai_19720780 | title=Retailers Nationwide Break Official Release Date of PlayStation's "Final Fantasy VII" Videogame | work=[http://www.findarticles.com/ Find Articles]; originally published in [http://www.businesswire.com/ Business Wire] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> In the game's debut weekend in North America, it sold 330,000 copies,<ref name="330k">{{cite web | date=September , 1997 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_Sept_9/ai_19749216 | title=PlayStation's "Final Fantasy VII" Breaks Industry Records in Debut Weekend | work=[http://www.findarticles.com/ Find Articles]; originally published in [http://www.businesswire.com/ Business Wire] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and had reached sales of 500,000 units in less than three weeks.<ref name="500k">{{cite web | date=September , 1997 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_Sept_25/ai_19781799 | title=PlayStation's Final Fantasy VII Has Sold More Than Half a Million Copies to Date | work=[http://www.findarticles.com/ Find Articles]; originally published in [http://www.businesswire.com/ Business Wire] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The momentum built in the game's opening weeks continued for several months; Sony announced that the game had sold one million copies on the continent by early December,<ref name="1mil">{{cite web | date=December , 1997 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_Dec_4/ai_20033866 | title=Final Fantasy VII For PlayStation Hits Million-Unit Mark | work=[http://www.findarticles.com/ Find Articles]; originally published in [http://www.businesswire.com/ Business Wire] | accessmonthday=August 10 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> prompting one business analyst to comment that "Sony redefined the role-playing game (RPG) category and expanded the conventional audience with the launch of ''Final Fantasy VII''".<ref name="1mil" /> <!--As of March [[2006 in video gaming|2006]], the game has sold more than 9.72 million copies worldwide, earning it the position of the best-selling ''Final Fantasy'' title.

Although Square's announcement that ''Final Fantasy VII'' would be produced for Sony rather than Nintendo and that it would not be based on the ''Final Fantasy SGI'' demo was initially met with discontent among gamers,<ref name="development6" /><ref name="development7" /> the game continues to maintain a strong following.

===Critical response===
The game received extremely favorable reviews from many well-known gaming publications. [[GameFan magazine|GameFan]] called it "quite possibly the greatest game ever made", while [[GameSpot]] commented that "never before have technology, playability, and narrative combined as well as in ''Final Fantasy VII''", expressing particular favor toward the game's graphics, audio and story. The UK-based publication ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' gave the game a 9/10,<ref name="edge">{{cite web | author=Edge Online site staff | title=Edge Online: Search Results | url=http://www.edge-online.co.uk/edgedb/search.php?gamename=Final+Fantasy+VII&x=0&y=0 | work=[http://www.edge-online.co.uk/ Edge Online]|accessmonthday=August 10 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> and ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' granted a 9.5/10, claiming that "No other RPG can pull off a cinematic experience like Final Fantasy VII".<ref name="egmreview" /> At the time of release, multimedia website [[IGN]] insisted that "''FF7''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s graphics are light years beyond anything ever seen on the PlayStation", held that its plot "is deep ... and epic", and regarded its battle system as its strongest point.<ref name="ignreview" /> One [[RPGamer]] staff reviewer praised the game's soundtrack "both in variety and sheer volume", suggesting that "Uematsu has done his work exceptionally well" and "is perhaps at his best here".<ref name="rpgamer2">{{cite web | author=Castomel | title=Final Fantasy VII - Review | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff7/reviews/ff7strev3.html | work=[http://www.rpgamer.com/ RPGamer] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy VII'' has received negative criticism as well. [[GameSpy]] rated it 7<sup>th</sup> on their "25 Most Overrated Games" list in September 2003, saying, "Most ''FF'' aficionados will tell you that ''VII'', while very good, is hardly the best game in the series", two of the reviewers placing both ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' above it.<ref name="GameSpy">{{cite web | author=Gamespy site staff | title=Top 25 Most Overrated Games | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/september03/25overrated/index20.shtml | work=[http://www.gamespy.com/ GameSpy] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> While giving the game an overall 5/5, ''[[Official PlayStation Magazine|Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' questioned the game's highly linear progression,<ref name="opmreview">{{cite web | author=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine staff | title=Final Fantasy VII PS Review | url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3111181&did=3 | work=[http://1up.com/ 1UP.com]|accessmonthday=August 10 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> as did GameSpot.<ref name="gamespotreview" /> ''OPM'' considered the game's translation "a bit muddy, causing unnecessary confusion and clouding the fine story", sentiments echoed by one member of RPGamer's staff who suggested that "[the game] is far from perfect", citing its translation as "packed with typos and other errors which further obscure what is already a very confusing plot".<ref name="rpgamer" /> [[GamePro]] also considered the [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-to-[[English language|English]] translation a significant weakness in the game,<ref name="development17" /> and IGN regarded the option to use only three characters at a time as "the game's only shortcoming".<ref name="ignreview" /> Overall, the game has earned a 92% universal approval rating from critics on [[Metacritic]] and [[Game Rankings]].<ref name="metacritic">{{cite web | editor=Metacritic site staff | title=Final Fantasy VII Reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/psx/finalfantasy7?q=Final%20Fantasy%20VII | work=[http://www.metacritic.com/ Metacritic] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="gamerankings">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy VII Reviews | editor=Game Ratings site staff | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/197341.asp?q=Final%20Fantasy%20VII | work=[http://www.gamerankings.com/ Game Rankings] | accessmonthday=July 23 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The game has also been the subject of criticism from parents concerned with violence in video games, particularly in the wake of the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in 1999. Following the event, several parents of children murdered in the massacre filed a US$5 billion lawsuit against companies that published and developed video and computer games. Among the co-defendants were [[Eidos Interactive]], publisher of the PC version of the game, with ''Final Fantasy VII'' cited as their offending contribution.<ref name="lawsuit">{{cite web | date=June , 2001 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4153/is_20010605/ai_n11965987 | title=Massacre parents sue London Lara firm | work=[http://www.findarticles.com/ Find Articles]; originally published in [http://www.associatednewspapers.com/es.htm Evening Standard] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="lawsuit2">{{cite web | date=June , 2001 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010607/ai_n14390475 | title=School massacre families to sue creators of violent games | work=[http://www.findarticles.com/ Find Articles]; originally published in [http://www.independent.co.uk/ The Independent] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Legacy===
''Final Fantasy VII'' is regarded as one of the most influential titles in the history of video games. It is credited with allowing console RPGs to find a place in markets outside Japan, and remains arguably the most popular title in the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name="mainstream" /><ref name="mainstream2" /> In January 2005, it was selected by ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' as 6<sup>th</sup> on their list of "the 10 most important games ... that helped redefine the industry since ... 1989". Citing its "beautiful cut-scenes and a deep, introspective narrative", they claimed that "Square’s game was ... the first RPG to surpass, instead of copy, movie like storytelling", and that, without it, "Aeris wouldn’t have died, and gamers wouldn’t have learned how to cry".<ref name="egmclaim">{{cite web | date=January , 2005 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zdegm/is_200501/ai_n7182265 | title=10 the 10 Most Important Games | work=[http://www.findarticles.com/ Find Articles]; originally published in [http://egm.1up.com/ Electronic Gaming Monthly] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> As well, in late 2007, [[Dengeki PlayStation]] named ''Final Fantasy VII'' as the best story, best RPG, and best overall game in their retrospective awards feature about the original [[PlayStation]].<ref name="dengeki-awards">{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | date=2007-11-22 | title=Nomura Talks FFXIII | url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/837/837350p1.html | work=[http://ps3.ign.com/ IGN PS3] | accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> The game's popularity and open-ended nature also led the director and writer to establish a plot-related connection between ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', another popular ''Final Fantasy'' title.<ref name="development12" />

The game's legacy includes the acceptance and standard inclusion of FMV sequences in RPGs, as well as significant advancement in computer graphics. These developments would allow series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi to begin production of the first ''Final Fantasy'' film, ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]''.<ref name="spiritswithin">{{Cite book | year=2001 | editor=Kennedy, Sam & Steinman, Gary | title=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine August 2001; issue 47 | pages=90 | language=English | publisher=Ziff Davis Media Inc.}}</ref> The game also introduced settings dominantly suffused with modern-to-advanced technology into the ''Final Fantasy'' series, a theme continued by ''Final Fantasy VIII'' and ''The Spirits Within''.<ref name="scifisetting" /><ref name="scifi" /><ref name="scifi2">{{cite web | author=Oliver, Glen | year=2001 | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/301/301291p1.html | title=Review of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within | work=[http://ign.com/ IGN] | accessmonthday=August 10 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Rereleases of Square games in Japan with bonus features would occur frequently after the release of ''Final Fantasy VII International''.

Though not under the ''Compilation'' label, two novellas set within ''Final Fantasy VII''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s continuity have been produced, while a third ''Final Fantasy VII'' mobile game has also been developed. The first of the two novellas is ''[[Aerith Gainsborough#Maiden who Travels the Planet|Maiden who Travels the Planet]]''. It follows Aeris' journey in the Lifestream following her death at the hands of Sephiroth, taking place concurrently with the second half of ''Final Fantasy VII''.<ref name="maiden">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=572 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> The second novella, ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children#On the Way to a Smile|On the Way to a Smile]]'', is a 3 part story based on the events that immediately followed the end of the game, with one part narrated from Tifa's perspective, one narrated from Barret's perspective, and the other narrated from that of a boy named "Denzel", orphaned after Shinra crushed Sector 7.<ref name="otwtas">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=V-Jump | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Prologue | pages=3 | language=Japanese | publisher=Shueisha | id=ISBN 4-08-779339-7}}</ref> Finally, ''Final Fantasy VII Snowboarding'', released in North America in [[2005 in video gaming|2005]], is a mobile [[porting|port]] of the snowboarding [[minigame]] featured in the original game.<ref name="snowboard">{{cite web | author=Buchanan, Levi | year=2005 | title=Final Fantasy VII Snowboarding | url=http://wireless.ign.com/articles/594/594902p1.html | work=[http://ign.com/ IGN] | accessmonthday=August 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The game is playable on the LG VX8000, LG VX8100, Audiovox 8940 and Samsung A890 [[mobile phone]] and contains different tracks than the original minigame.

Some speculate that the ''Compilation'' will also include an [[enhanced remake]] of the original ''Final Fantasy VII'' for the PlayStation 3. This speculation was sparked at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo by the release of a ''Final Fantasy VII'' [[technology demo]] featuring the opening sequence of ''Final Fantasy VII'' recreated using the PlayStation 3's graphical capabilities.<ref name="demo">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=571 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref><ref name="demo2">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly | title=Electronic Gaming Monthly October 2005; issue 196 | pages=106 | language=English | publisher=Ziff Davis Media Inc.}}</ref><ref name="demo3">{{cite web | author=Allen, Jason | year=2005 | title=E3 2005: Eyes-on the Final Fantasy VII Tech Demo | url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/614/614859p1.html | work=[http://ign.com/ IGN] | accessmonthday=August 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The demo was created by Yoshinori Kitase's team with help from Koji Sugimoto, the main programmer for ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', as well as [[Motomu Toriyama]], and was completed in one and a half month to Kitase's surprise and satisfaction, who nevertheless noted that it does not use the PlayStation 3's full capacities and could have been of even higher quality if more time had been given.<ref>{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | date=2005-06-10 | title=Yoshinori Kitase Talks Final Fantasy VII | url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/624/624504p1.html | work=[http://ign.com/ IGN] | accessmonthday=September 2 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>
