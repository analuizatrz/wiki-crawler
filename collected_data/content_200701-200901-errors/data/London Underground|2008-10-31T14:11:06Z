The '''London Underground''' is a [[metro system]] serving a large part of [[Greater London]] and neighbouring areas of [[Essex]], [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Buckinghamshire]] in the [[UK]]. It is both the world's oldest underground railway and the oldest [[rapid transit system]]. It was also the first underground railway to operate electric trains. It is usually referred to as ''the Underground'' or ''the Tube'' - the latter deriving from the shape of the system's [[Tunnel boring machine|deep-bore tunnel]]s - although about 55% of the network is above ground.

The earlier lines of the present London Underground network, which were built by various private companies, became part of an integrated transport system (which excluded the main line railways) in 1933 with the creation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB), more commonly known by its shortened name: "'''London Transport'''". The underground network became a single entity when London Underground Limited (LUL) was formed by the [[UK government]] in 1985.<ref name="history">{{ cite web | title = History | publisher = Transport for London | url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/1604.aspx | accessdate = 2007-03-31 }}</ref> Since 2003 LUL has been a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Transport for London]] (TfL), the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in [[Greater London]], which is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the [[Mayor of London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp#transport|title=How do I find out about transport in London? |publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of the London Underground}}
Railway construction in the [[United Kingdom]] began in the early 19th century. By 1854 six separate railway terminals had been built just outside the centre of London: [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]], [[Euston railway station|Euston]], [[London Paddington station|Paddington]], [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]], [[Bishopsgate railway station|Bishopsgate]] and [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]]. At this point, only [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street Station]] was located in the actual [[City of London]]. Traffic congestion in the city and the surrounding areas had increased significantly in this period, partly due to the need for rail travellers to complete their journeys into the city centre by road. The idea of building an underground railway to link the City of London with the mainline terminals had first been proposed in the 1830s, but it was not until the 1850s that the idea was taken seriously as a solution to the traffic congestion problems.<ref name="illustrated">{{cite book|last=Green|first=Oliver |title=The London Underground - An illustrated history|publisher=Ian Allan Ltd|year=1987}}, at pp.3-4</ref>

===The first underground railways===
In 1854 an [[Act of Parliament]] was passed approving the construction of an underground railway between [[Paddington Station]] and [[Farringdon station|Farringdon Street]] via [[King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] which was to be called the [[Metropolitan Railway]]. The [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) gave financial backing to the project when it was agreed that a junction would be built linking the underground railway with their mainline terminus at Paddington. GWR also agreed to design special trains for the new subterranean railway. 

Construction was delayed for several years due to a shortage of funds. The fact that this project got under way at all was largely due to the lobbying of [[Charles Pearson]], who was [[Solicitor]] to the [[City of London Corporation]] at the time. Pearson had supported the idea of an underground railway in London for several years. He advocated plans for the demolition of the unhygienic slums which would be replaced by new accommodation for their inhabitants in the suburbs, with the new railway providing transportation to their places of work in the city centre. Although he was never directly involved in the running of the Metropolitan Railway, he is widely credited as being one of the first true visionaries behind the concept of underground railways. And in 1859 it was Pearson who persuaded the City of London Corporation to help fund the scheme. Work finally began in February 1860, under the guidance of chief engineer [[Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet|John Fowler]]. Pearson died before the work was completed.

The Metropolitan Railway opened on 10 January 1863.<ref name="history"/> Within a few months of opening it was carrying over 26,000 passengers a day.<ref>Green, p.5</ref> The [[Hammersmith & City Line|Hammersmith and City Railway]] was opened on 13 June 1864 between [[Hammersmith tube station (Hammersmith & City Line)|Hammersmith]] and Paddington. Services were initially operated by GWR between Hammersmith and Farringdon Street. By April 1865 the Metropolitan had taken over the service. On 23 December 1865 the Metropolitan's eastern extension to [[Moorgate station|Moorgate Street]] opened. Later in the decade other branches were opened to [[Swiss Cottage tube station|Swiss Cottage]], [[South Kensington tube station|South Kensington]] and Addison Road, Kensington (now known as [[Kensington Olympia station|Kensington Olympia]]). The railway had initially been dual gauge, allowing for the use of GWR's signature broad gauge rolling stock and the more widely used standard gauge stock. Disagreements with GWR had forced the Metropolitan to switch to standard gauge in 1863 after GWR withdrew all its stock from the railway. These differences were later patched up, however broad gauge was totally withdrawn from the railway in March 1869.

On 24 December 1868, the [[Metropolitan District Railway]] began operating services between South Kensington and [[Westminster tube station|Westminster]] using Metropolitan Railway trains and carriages. The company, which soon became known as "'''the District'''", was first incorporated in 1864 to complete an Inner Circle railway around [[London]] in conjunction with the Metropolitan. This was part of a plan to build both an Inner Circle line and [[Outer Circle (London)|Outer Circle]] line around London.

The Metropolitan and the District were initially friendly to each other. They shared four directors and the two companies were widely expected to merge once the Inner Circle was completed. However a fierce rivalry soon developed when the independent directors on the District board became dissatisfied with the performance of the Metropolitan service providers. On 3 January 1870 the Metropolitan informed the District that operating agreements would cease in 18 months. The four Metropolitan directors serving on the District board subsequently resigned. This severely delayed the completion of the Inner Circle project as the two companies competed to build far more financially lucrative railways in the suburbs of London. The [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) began running their Outer Circle service from [[Broad Street railway station (London)|Broad Street]] via [[Willesden Junction]], Addison Road and [[Earl's Court tube station|Earl's Court]] to [[Mansion House tube station|Mansion House]] in 1872. The Inner Circle was not completed until 1884, with the Metropolitan and the District jointly running services. In the meantime, the District had finished its route between [[West Brompton station|West Brompton]] and [[Blackfriars station|Blackfriars]] in 1870, with an interchange with the Metropolitan at South Kensington. In 1877, it began running its own services from [[Hammersmith tube station (Piccadilly and District Lines)|Hammersmith]] to [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond]], on a line which had originally opened by the [[London & South Western Railway]] (LSWR) in 1869. The District then opened a new line from [[Turnham Green tube station|Turnham Green]] to [[Ealing Broadway station|Ealing]] in 1879<ref name="Chiswick Past">{{cite book|last=Clegg|first=Gillian |title=Chiswick Past|publisher=Historical Publications Ltd|year=1995}}, at p.72</ref> and extended its West Brompton branch to [[Fulham Broadway tube station|Fulham]] in 1880. Over the same decade the Metropolitan was extended to [[Harrow tube station|Harrow]] in the north-west.

The early tunnels were dug mainly using [[cut-and-cover]] construction methods. This caused widespread disruption and required the demolition of several properties on the surface. The first trains were steam-hauled, which required effective ventilation to the surface. Ventilation shafts at various points on the route allowed the engines to expel steam and bring fresh air into the tunnels. One such vent is at Leinster Gardens, W2.<ref>{{cite web | last =Slocombe | first =Mike | title =23/24 Leinster Gardens, Paddington, London W2 | work =London Landmarks | publisher =[[Urban75]] | date =January 2007 | url =http://www.urban75.org/london/leinster.html  | accessdate =2008-07-11  }}</ref>  In order to preserve the visual characteristics in what is still a well-to-do street, a five-foot-thick (1.5&nbsp;m) concrete façade was constructed to resemble a genuine house frontage.

On 7 December 1869 the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&SCR) started operating a service between [[Wapping tube station|Wapping]] and [[New Cross Gate station|New Cross Gate]] on the [[East London Railway]] (ELR) using the [[Thames Tunnel]] designed by [[Marc Brunel]], who designed the revolutionary [[tunnelling shield]] method which made its construction not only possible, but safer, and completed by his son [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. This had opened in 1843 as a pedestrian tunnel, but in 1865 it was purchased by the ELR (a consortium of six railway companies: the [[Great Eastern Railway]] (GER); London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR); [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LCDR); [[South Eastern Railway]] (SER); Metropolitan Railway; and the Metropolitan District Railway) and converted into a railway tunnel. In 1884 the District and the Metropolitan began to operate services on the line.

By the end of the 1880s, underground railways reached [[Chesham tube station|Chesham]] on the Metropolitan, [[Hounslow West tube station|Hounslow]], [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] and [[Whitechapel tube station|Whitechapel]] on the District and [[New Cross station|New Cross]] on the East London Railway. By the end of the 19th century, the Metropolitan had extended its lines far outside of London to [[Aylesbury Station|Aylesbury]], [[Verney Junction]] and [[Brill]], creating new suburbs along the route—later publicised by the company as [[Metro-land]]. Right up until the 1930s the company maintained ambitions to be considered as a main line rather than an urban railway.

===The first tube lines===
{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}}

[[Image:Gb-lu-Angel-southbound.jpg|thumb|left|The nickname "the Tube" comes from the circular tube-like tunnels and platforms through which the trains travel. This photograph shows the southbound station platform at [[Angel tube station]] on the [[Northern Line]].]]

The first underground railways, excluding the ELR, had been just 10 feet deep. Following advances in the use of [[tunnelling shield]]s, electric traction and deep-level tunnel designs, later railways were built even further underground. This caused much less disruption at ground level and it was therefore cheaper and preferable to the cut-and-cover construction method.

The [[City & South London Railway]] (C&SLR, now part of the [[Northern Line]]) opened in 1890, between [[Stockwell tube station|Stockwell]] and the now closed original terminus at [[King William Street tube station|King William Street]]. It was the first "deep-level" electrically operated railway in the world. By 1900 it had been extended at both ends, to [[Clapham Common tube station|Clapham Common]] in the south and Moorgate Street (via a diversion) in the north. The second such railway, the [[Waterloo and City Line|Waterloo and City Railway]], opened in 1898. It was built and run by the [[London and South Western Railway]]. 

On 30 July 1900 the [[Central Line|Central London Railway]] (now known as the [[Central Line]]) was opened, operating services from Bank to Shepherd's Bush. It was nicknamed the "Twopenny Tube" for its flat fare and cylindrical tunnels; the "tube" nickname was eventually transferred to the Underground system as a whole. An interchange with the C&SLR was provided at Bank. Construction had also begun in August 1898 on the [[Baker Street & Waterloo Railway]]. However work on this railway came to a halt 18 months after it began when funds ran out.

===Integration===
In the early 20th century the presence of six independent operators running different Underground lines caused passengers substantial inconvenience; in many places passengers had to walk some distance above ground to change between lines. The costs associated with running such a system were also heavy, and as a result many companies looked to financiers who could give them the money they needed to expand into the lucrative suburbs as well as electrify the earlier steam operated lines. The most prominent of these was [[Charles Yerkes]], an American [[tycoon]] who secured the right to build the [[Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway]] (CCE&HR) on 1 October 1900. In March 1901 he effectively took control of the District and this enabled him to form the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company (MDET) on 15 July. Through this he acquired the Great Northern & Strand Railway and the Brompton & Piccadilly Circus Railway in September 1901, the construction of which had already been authorised by Parliament, together with the moribund Baker Street & Waterloo Railway in March 1902. On 9 April the MDET evolved into the [[Underground Electric Railways Company|Underground Electric Railways of London Company Ltd]] (UERL). The UERL also owned three tramway companies and went on to buy the [[London General Omnibus Company]], creating an organisation colloquially known as "the Combine" which went on to dominate underground railway construction in London until the 1930s.

[[Image:London Underground Embankment 1090744 1090752.jpg|600px|center|thumb|The Circle and District Line platforms at Embankment station]]

With the financial backing of Yerkes, the District opened its [[South Harrow tube station|South Harrow]] branch in 1903 and completed its link to the Metropolitan's [[Uxbridge tube station|Uxbridge]] branch at [[Rayners Lane tube station|Rayners Lane]] in 1904 - although services to Uxbridge on the District did not begin until 1910 due to yet another disagreement with the Metropolitan. By the end of 1905 all District Railway and Inner Circle services were run by electric trains.

The Baker Street & Waterloo Railway opened in 1906, soon branding itself the [[Bakerloo Line|Bakerloo]], and by 1907 it had been extended to [[Edgware Road tube station|Edgware Road]] in the north and [[Elephant & Castle tube station|Elephant & Castle]] in the south. The newly named [[Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway]], combining the two projects acquired by MDET in September 1901, also opened in 1906. With tunnels at an impressive depth of 200 feet below the surface, it ran from Finsbury Park to Hammersmith; a single station branch to [[Aldwych tube station|Strand]] (later renamed Aldwych) was added in 1907. In the same year the CCE&HR opened from [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross]] to [[Camden Town tube station|Camden Town]], with two northward branches, one to [[Golders Green tube station|Golders Green]] and one to [[Highgate tube station|Highgate]] (now [[Archway tube station|Archway]]). 

Independent ventures did continue in the early part of the 20th century. The independent [[Northern City Line|Great Northern & City Railway]] opened in 1904 between [[Finsbury Park tube station|Finsbury Park]] and [[Moorgate tube station|Moorgate]]. It was the only tube line of sufficient diameter to be capable of handling main line stock, and it was originally intended to be part of a main line railway. However money soon ran out and the route remained separate from the main line network until the 1970s. The C&SLR was also extended northwards to [[Euston tube station|Euston]] by 1907.

In early 1908, in an effort to increase passenger numbers, the underground railway operators agreed to promote their services jointly as "the Underground", publishing new adverts and creating a free publicity map of the network for the purpose. The map featured a key labelling the Bakerloo Railway, the Central London Railway, the City & South London Railway, the District Railway, the Great Northern & City Railway, the Hampstead Railway (the shortened name of the CCE&HR), the Metropolitan Railway and the Piccadilly Railway. Some other railways appeared on the map but with less prominence than the aforementioned lines. These included part of the ELR (although the map wasn't big enough to fit in the whole line) and the Waterloo and City Railway. As the latter was owned by a main line railway company it wasn't included in this early phase of integration. As part of the process, "The Underground" name appeared on stations for the first time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/london-underground-fact-sheet.pdf|title=London Underground Factsheet|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> and electric ticket-issuing machines were also introduced. This was followed in 1913 by the first appearance of the famous circle and horizontal bar symbol, known as "the roundel",<ref>http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/history/1606.aspx</ref> designed by [[Edward Johnston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/london-underground-fact-sheet.pdf|title=London Underground Factsheet|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref>

On 1 January 1913 the UERL absorbed two other independent tube lines, the C&SLR and the Central London Railway. As the Combine expanded, only the Metropolitan stayed away from this process of integration, retaining its ambition to be considered as a main line railway. Proposals were put forward for a merger between the two companies in 1913 but the plan was rejected by the Metropolitan. In the same year the company asserted its independence by buying out the cash strapped Great Northern and City Railway. It also sought a character of its own. The Metropolitan Surplus Lands Committee had been formed in 1887 to develop accommodation alongside the railway and in 1919 Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Ltd. was founded to capitalise on the post-World War One demand for housing. This ensured that the Metropolitan would retain an independent image until the creation of London Transport in 1933.

The Metropolitan also sought to electrify its lines. The District and the Metropolitan had agreed to use the low voltage dc system for the Inner Circle, comprising two electric rails to power the trains, back in 1901. At the start of 1905 electric trains began to work the Uxbridge branch and from 1 November 1906 electric locomotives took trains as far as [[Wembley Park tube station|Wembley Park]] where steam trains took over. This changeover point was moved to Harrow on 19 July 1908. The Hammersmith & City branch had also been upgraded to electric working on 5 November 1906. The electrification of the ELR followed on 31 March 1913, the same year as the opening of its extension to [[Whitechapel tube station|Whitechapel]] and [[Shoreditch tube station|Shoreditch]]. Following the [[Railways Act 1921|Grouping Act]] of 1921, which merged all the cash strapped main line railways into four companies (thus obliterating the original consortium that had built the ELR), the Metropolitan agreed to run passenger services on the line.

The Bakerloo line extension to [[Queen's Park tube station|Queen's Park]] was completed in 1915, and the service extended to [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]] via the [[London and North Western Railway]] tracks in 1917. The extension of the Central line to [[Ealing Broadway tube station|Ealing Broadway]] was delayed by the war until 1920.

The major development of the 1920s was the integration of the CCE&HR and the C&SLR and extensions to form what was to become the Northern line. This necessitated enlargement of the older parts of the C&SLR, which had been built on a modest scale. The integration required temporary closures during 1922—24. The [[Golders Green tube station|Golders Green]] branch was extended to [[Edgware tube station|Edgware]] in 1924, and the southern end was extended to [[Morden tube station|Morden]] in 1926.

The [[Watford tube station|Watford]] branch of the Metropolitan opened in 1925 and in the same year electrification was extended to Rickmansworth. The last major work completed by the Metropolitan was the branch to [[Stanmore tube station|Stanmore]] which opened in 1932. 

By 1933 the Combine had completed the [[Cockfosters tube station|Cockfosters]] branch of the Piccadilly Line, with through services running (via realigned tracks between Hammersmith and [[Acton Town tube station|Acton Town]]) to [[Hounslow West tube station|Hounslow West]] and [[Uxbridge tube station|Uxbridge]].

===London Transport===
In 1933 the Combine, the Metropolitan and all the municipal and independent bus and tram undertakings were merged into the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB), a self-supporting and unsubsidised public corporation which came into being on 1 July 1933. The LPTB soon became known as "'''London Transport'''" (LT).

Shortly after it was created, LT began the process of integrating the underground railways of London into one network. All the separate railways were given new names in order to become lines within it. A free [[tube map|map]] of these lines, designed by [[Harry Beck (graphic designer)|Harry Beck]], was issued in 1933. It featured the [[District Line]], the [[Bakerloo Line]], the [[Piccadilly Line]], the [[Northern Line|Edgware, Highgate and Morden Line]], the [[Metropolitan Line]], the [[Northern City Line|Great Northern & City Line]], the [[East London Line]] and the [[Central Line|Central London Line]]. Commonly regarded as a design classic, an updated version of this map is still in use today. The [[Waterloo & City line]] was not included in this map as it was still owned by a main line railway (the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] since 1923) and not LT.

LT announced a scheme for the expansion and modernisation of the network entitled the [[New Works Programme]], which had followed the announcement of improvement proposals for the Metropolitan Line. This consisted of plans to extend some lines, to take over the operation of others from main-line railway companies, and to electrify the entire network. During the 1930s and 1940s, several sections of main-line railways were converted into surface lines of the Underground system. The oldest part of today's Underground network is the Central line between [[Leyton tube station|Leyton]] and [[Loughton tube station|Loughton]], which opened as a railway seven years before the Underground itself. 

LT also sought to abandon routes which made a significant financial loss. Soon after the LPTB started operating, services to Verney Junction and Brill on the Metropolitan Railway were stopped. The renamed "Metropolitan Line" terminus was moved to [[Aylesbury station|Aylesbury]].

The outbreak of [[World War II]] delayed all the expansion schemes. From mid-1940, the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] led to the use of many Underground stations as [[air-raid shelter|shelters]] during [[airstrike|air raids]] and overnight. The authorities initially tried to discourage and prevent this, but later supplied [[bunk]]s, [[latrine]]s, and [[catering]] facilities. Later in the war, eight [[London deep-level shelters]] were constructed under stations, ostensibly to be used as shelters (each deep-level shelter could hold 8,000 people) though plans were in place to convert them for a new express line parallel to the Northern line after the war. Some stations (now mostly disused) were converted into government offices: for example, [[Down Street tube station|Down Street]] was used for the headquarters of the Railway Executive Committee and was also used for meetings of the [[War Cabinet]] before the [[Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms|Cabinet War Rooms]] were completed;<ref name=Disused_1>
{{cite book |last=Conner|first=J.E.|title=London's Disused Underground Stations|year=1999|publisher=Capital Transport|chapter=Down Street|pages=p. 33|isbn=185414-250-X}}</ref> [[Brompton Road tube station|Brompton Road]] was used as a control room for [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and the remains of the surface building are still used by London's University Royal Naval Unit (URNU) and University London Air Squadron (ULAS).

After the war one of the last acts of the LPTB was to give the go-ahead for the completion of the postponed Central Line extensions. The western extension to [[West Ruislip tube station|West Ruislip]] was completed in 1948, and the eastern extension to [[Epping tube station|Epping]] in 1949; the single-line branch from Epping to Ongar was taken over and electrified in 1957.

===Nationalisation===
[[Image:TubeStationWithTrain.jpg|thumb||A [[London Underground 1995 Stock]] train pulls into [[Mornington Crescent tube station|Mornington Crescent]] station on the [[Northern Line]].]]
On 1 January 1948 London Transport was [[nationalised]] by the incumbent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, together with the four remaining main line railway companies, and incorporated into the operations of the [[British Transport Commission]] (BTC). The LPTB was replaced by the [[London Transport Executive]] (LTE). This brought the Underground under the remit of central government for the first time in its history. 

The implementation of nationalised railways was a move of necessity as well as ideology. The main line railways had struggled to cope with a war economy in the First World War and by the end of World War Two the four remaining companies were on the verge of bankruptcy. Nationalisation was the easiest way to save the railways in the short term and provide money to fix war time damage. The BTC necessarily prioritised the reconstruction of its main line railways over the maintenance of the Underground network. The unfinished parts of the [[New Works Programme]] were gradually shelved or postponed.

However the BTC did authorise the completion of the electrification of the network, seeking to replace steam locomotives on the parts of the system where they still operated. This phase of the programme was completed when the [[Metropolitan Line]] was electrified to [[Chesham tube station|Chesham]] in 1960. Steam locomotives were fully withdrawn from London Underground passenger services on 9 September 1961, when [[British Railways]] took over the operations of the Metropolitan line between [[Amersham tube station|Amersham]] and Aylesbury. The last steam shunting and freight locomotive was withdrawn from service in 1971.<ref>http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/history/1606.aspx</ref>

In 1963 the LTE was replaced by the [[London Transport Board]], directly accountable to the [[Ministry of Transport]].

===GLC Control===
On 1 January 1970, the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) took over responsibility for London Transport. 

The first real post-war investment in the network came with the carefully planned [[Victoria Line]], which was built on a diagonal northeast-southwest alignment beneath Central London, incorporating centralised signalling control and automatically driven trains, and opened in stages between 1968 and 1971. The Piccadilly line was extended to [[Heathrow Terminals 1,2,3 tube station|Heathrow Airport]] in 1977, and the Jubilee line was opened in 1979, taking over part of the Bakerloo line, with new tunnels between [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] and [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross]]. 

===London Regional Transport===
In 1984 [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government removed London Transport from the GLC's control, replacing it with [[London Regional Transport]] (LRT) - a statutory corporation for which the [[Secretary of State for Transport]] was directly responsible. The government planned to modernise the system whilst slashing its subsidy from taxpayers and ratepayers at the same time. As part of this strategy London Underground Limited was set up in 1985 as a wholly owned subsidiary of LRT to run the network. This period saw the introduction of automatic ticketing machines and network-wide [[Travelcard]]s. 

In 1994, with the [[privatization|privatisation]] of [[British Rail]], LRT took control of the Waterloo and City line, incorporating it into the Underground network for the first time. This year also saw the end of services on the little used Epping-Ongar branch of the Central Line and the Aldwych branch of the Piccadilly Line after it was agreed that necessary maintenance and upgrade work would not be cost effective.

In 1999 the Jubilee line extension to [[Stratford station|Stratford]] in London's East End was completed. This plan included the opening of a completely refurbished interchange station at [[Westminster tube station|Westminster]]. The Jubilee line's old terminal platforms at Charing Cross were closed but maintained operable for emergencies.

===Public Private Partnership===
Transport for London (TfL) replaced LRT in 2000, a development that coincided with the creation of a directly-elected Mayor of London and the [[Greater London Assembly]]. 

In January 2003 the Underground began operating as a [[Public-Private Partnership]] (PPP), whereby the infrastructure and rolling stock were maintained by two private companies ([[Metronet]] and [[Tube Lines]]) under 30-year contracts, whilst London Underground Limited remained publicly owned and operated by TfL.

There was much controversy over the implementation of the PPP. Supporters of the change claimed that the private sector would eliminate the inefficiencies of public sector enterprises and take on the risks associated with running the network, while opponents said that the need to make profits would reduce the investment and public service aspects of the Underground. There has since been criticism of the performance of the private companies; for example the January 2007 edition of [[The Londoner]],<ref>
{{cite news | title =Metronet guilty of 'inexcusable failures' | publisher =[[The Londoner]] | date =January 2007 | url =http://www.london.gov.uk/londoner/07jan/p3b.jsp?nav=around | accessdate =2007-01-10}}</ref> a newsletter published periodically by the Greater London Authority, listed ''Metronet's mistakes of 2006'' under the headline ''Metronet guilty of 'inexcusable failures'''. 

Metronet was placed into [[Administration (insolvency)|administration]] on 18 July 2007.<ref>{{cite news | title =Metronet calls in administrators  | publisher =[[BBC News]] | date =2007-07-18 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6903977.stm | accessdate =2007-08-21  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metronetrail.com/default.asp?sID=1184745625515|title=PPP Administration|publisher=Metronet Rail|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref>TfL has since taken over Metronet's outstanding commitments. 

The [[UK government]] has made concerted efforts to find another private firm to fill the vacuum left by the liquidation of [[Metronet]]. However so far only TfL has expressed a plausible interest in taking over Metronet's responsibilities. Even though [[Tube Lines]] appears to be stable, this has put the long-term future of the PPP scheme in doubt. The case for PPP was also weakened in 2008 when it was revealed that the demise of Metronet had cost the UK government £2 billion. The five private companies that made up the Metronet alliance had to pay £70m each towards paying off the debts acquired by the consortium. But under a deal struck with the government in 2003, when the PPP scheme began operating, the companies were protected from any further liability. The UK taxpayer therefore had to foot the rest of the bill. This undermined the argument that the PPP would place the risks involved in running the network into the hands of the private sector.<ref>{{cite journal|date=April 2008|journal=Railway Magazine}}, at p.6</ref>

==Transport for London==
{{main|Transport for London}}
Transport for London (TfL) was created in 2000 as the integrated body responsible for London's transport system. It replaced London Regional Transport. It assumed control of London Underground Limited in July 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp#tube|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref>

TfL is part of the [[Greater London Authority]] and is constituted as a statutory corporation regulated under local government finance rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/4510.aspx|title=Company information|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> It has three subsidiaries: London Transport Insurance (Guernsey) Ltd., the TfL Pension Fund Trustee Co. Ltd. and Transport Trading Ltd (TTL). TTL has six wholly-owned subsidiaries, one of which is London Underground Limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/boardandchiefofficers/1452.aspx|title=TfL subsidiaries|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref>

The TfL Board is appointed by the [[Mayor of London]]. The Mayor also sets the structure and level of public transport fares in London. However the day-to-day running of the corporation is left to the [[Commissioner]] of Transport for London. The current Commissioner is [[Peter Hendy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/1434.aspx|title=Chief Officers|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref>

The Mayor is responsible for producing an integrated transport strategy for London and for consulting the GLA, TfL, local councils and others on the strategy. The Mayor is also responsible for setting TfL's budget. The GLA is consulted on the Mayor's transport strategy, and inspects and approves the Mayor's budget. It is able to summon the Mayor and senior staff to account for TfL's performance. London TravelWatch, a body appointed by and reporting to the Assembly, deals with complaints about transport in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/transport.jsp|title=Transport|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref>

===Stations and lines===
The London Underground's 11 lines are the [[Bakerloo line]], [[Central line]], [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]], [[District line]], [[Hammersmith & City line]], [[Jubilee line]], [[Metropolitan line]], [[Northern line]], [[Piccadilly line]], [[Victoria line]], and [[Waterloo & City line]].  Until 2007 there was a twelfth line, the [[East London line]], but this has closed for conversion work and will be transferred to the [[London Overground]] when it reopens in 2010.

The Underground serves 268 [[Underground station|stations]] by rail; an additional six stations that were on the East London line are served by Underground replacement buses. Fourteen Underground stations are outside Greater London, of which five ([[Amersham station|Amersham]], [[Chalfont & Latimer station|Chalfont & Latimer]], [[Chesham tube station|Chesham]], [[Chorleywood station|Chorleywood]], [[Epping tube station|Epping]]) are beyond the [[M25 motorway|M25 London Orbital motorway]]. Of the 32 [[London borough]]s, five ([[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]], [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]], [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], and [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]]) are not served by the Underground network, while [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] only has [[Old Street tube station|Old Street]] and [[Manor House tube station|Manor House]] on its boundaries.

[[Image:London Underground Zone 1.svg|center|600px|thumb|Zone 1 (central zone) of the Underground (and [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]]) network in a geographically more accurate layout than the usual Tube map, using the same style.]]

[[Image:London Underground subsurface and tube trains.jpg|thumb|Underground trains come in two sizes, larger subsurface trains and smaller tube trains. A [[Metropolitan line]] [[London Underground A60 and A62 Stock|A Stock]] train (left) passes a [[Piccadilly line]] [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]] train (right) in the siding at [[Rayners Lane tube station|Rayners Lane]]]]

Lines on the Underground can be classified into two types: subsurface and deep-level. The subsurface lines were dug by the [[cut-and-cover]] method, with the tracks running about {{convert|5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} below the surface. The deep-level or tube lines, bored using a [[tunnelling shield]], run about {{convert|20|m|ftin|abbr=on}} below the surface (although this varies considerably), with each track in a separate tunnel. These tunnels can have a diameter as small as {{convert|3.56|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and the [[loading gauge]] is thus considerably smaller than on the subsurface lines. Lines of both types usually emerge onto the surface outside the central area.

While the tube lines are for the most part self-contained, the subsurface lines are part of an interconnected network: each shares track with at least two other lines. The subsurface arrangement is similar to the [[New York City Subway]], which also runs separate "lines" over shared tracks.

===Rolling stock and electrification===
{{main|London Underground rolling stock}}
[[Image:Stratford Depot 27.JPG|thumb|[[London Underground 1996 Stock|1996 Stock]] trains at Stratford Market Depot]]
The Underground uses [[rolling stock]] built between 1960 and 2005. Stock on subsurface lines is identified by a letter (such as [[London Underground A62 Stock|A Stock]], used on the [[Metropolitan line]]), while tube stock is identified by the year in which it was designed (for example, [[London Underground 1996 Stock|1996 Stock]], used on the Jubilee line). All lines are worked by a single type of stock except the [[District line]], which uses both [[London Underground C69 Stock|C]] and [[London Underground D78 Stock|D]] Stock. Two types of stock are currently being developed &mdash; [[London Underground 2009 Stock|2009 Stock]] for the Victoria line and [[London Underground S Stock|S stock]] for the subsurface lines, with the Metropolitan line A Stock being replaced first. Rollout of both is expected to begin about 2009. In addition to the [[Electric Multiple Unit]]s described above, there is [[London Underground engineering stock|engineering stock]], such as ballast trains and brake vans, identified by a 1-3 letter prefix then a number. 

The Underground is one of the few networks in the world that uses a four-rail system. The additional rail carries the electrical return that on third-rail and overhead networks is provided by the running rails. On the Underground a top-contact third rail is beside the track, energised at +420 V DC, and a top-contact fourth rail is centrally between the running rails, at -210 V DC, which combine to provide a traction voltage of 630 V DC.

===Cooling===
{{main|London Underground cooling}}
In summer, temperatures on parts of the '''[[London Underground]]''' can become very uncomfortable due to its deep and poorly ventilated tube tunnels: temperatures as high as {{convert|47|°C|°F}} were reported in the [[2006 European heat wave]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5191604.stm|title=Baking hot at Baker Street|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-07-18|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> Posters may be observed on the Underground network advising that passengers carry a bottle of water to help keep cool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/anniemole/166070278/|title=Carry a bottle of water TfL poster|publisher=Flickr}}</ref>

===Planned improvements and expansions===
[[Image:Piccadilly T5 Extension.JPG|thumb|A diagram at [[Ealing Common tube station|Ealing Common]], showing the layout of the [[Piccadilly line]] at [[London Heathrow Airport]]]]
There are many planned improvements to the London Underground. A new station opened on the Piccadilly line at [[Heathrow Terminal 5 station|Heathrow Airport Terminal 5]] on 27 March 2008 and is the first extension of the London Underground since 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/5507.aspx|title=First Piccadilly line trains travel to Heathrow Terminal 5|date=2007-07-18|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref><ref>London Underground.  [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/press-centre/metro/article.asp?id=1206 Piccadilly line update] {{Dead link|date=July 2008}} (21 August 2006).</ref> Each line is being upgraded to improve capacity and reliability, with new computerised signalling, [[automatic train operation]] (ATO), track replacement and station refurbishment, and, where needed, new rolling stock. A trial programme for a groundwater cooling system in [[Victoria station (London)|Victoria station]] took place in 2006 and 2007; it aimed to determine whether such a system would be feasible and effective if in widespread use.<ref>{{cite web | title =Subsurface network (SSL) upgrade | publisher =alwaystouchout.com | date =2006-12-07 | url =http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/39 | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}</ref> A trial of mobile phone coverage on the Waterloo & City line<ref>{{cite web | title=Mobile phone trial on the Waterloo & City line | publisher =Transport for London | date = 2007-03-15 | url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/4577.aspx | accessdate =2008-07-11  }} </ref> aims to determine whether coverage can be extended across the rest of the Underground network. Although not part of London Underground, the [[Crossrail]] scheme will provide a new route across central London integrated with the tube network.

The long proposed [[Chelsea-Hackney line]], which is planned to begin operation in 2025, may be part of the London Underground, which would mean it would give the network a new Northeast to South cross London line to provide more interchanges with other lines and relieve overcrowding on other lines. However it is still on the drawing board. It was first proposed in 1901 and has been in planning since then. In 2007 the line was passed over to Cross London Rail Ltd, the current developers of Crossrail.  Therefore, the line may be either part of the London Underground network or the National Rail network. There are advantages and disadvantages for both.

The [[Croxley Rail Link]] proposal envisages diverting the Metropolitan line Watford branch to [[Watford Junction station]] along a disused railway track. The project awaits funding from [[Hertfordshire County Council]] and the [[Department for Transport]], and remains at the proposal stage.<ref name="TFLcroxley">{{cite web 
|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/networkandservices/2053.aspx |title=Croxley Rail Link |publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>

==Travelling==
===Ticketing===
{{main|London Underground ticketing}}
[[Image:London-underground-travelcard.jpg|thumb|London Underground One-Day Travelcard]]
[[Image:Oyster front.svg|thumb|London Underground Oyster Card]]
The Underground uses TfL's [[Travelcard]] zones to calculate fares. Greater London is divided into 6 zones; [[Travelcard Zone 1|Zone 1]] is the most central, with a boundary just beyond the Circle line, and [[Travelcard Zone 6|Zone 6]] is the outermost and includes [[London Heathrow Airport]]. Stations on the Metropolitan line outside Greater London are in Zones 7-9.<ref>
{{cite news| title =Numbered zones for stations | publisher =[[Watford Observer]] | url =http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/1855280.numbered_zones_for_stations/ | accessdate =2008-07-11  }}</ref>

Travelcard zones 7-9 also apply on the Euston-Watford Junction line (part of the London Overground) as far as Watford High Street. Watford Junction is outside these zones and special fares apply.

There are staffed ticket offices, some open for limited periods only, and ticket machines usable at any time. Some machines that sell a limited range of tickets accept coins only, other touch-screen machines accept coins and banknotes, and usually give change. These machines also accept major credit and debit cards: some newer machines accept cards only. 

More recently, TfL has introduced the [[Oyster card]], a [[smartcard]] with an embedded contactless [[RFID]] chip, that travellers can obtain, charge with credit, and use to pay for travel. Like Travelcards they can be used on the Underground, buses, trams and the Docklands Light Railway. The Oyster card is cheaper to operate than cash ticketing or the older-style magnetic-strip-based Travelcards{{Specify|date=December 2006}}, and the Underground is encouraging passengers to use Oyster cards instead of Travelcards and cash (on buses) by implementing significant price differences. Oyster-based Travelcards can be used on National Rail throughout London. Pay as you go is available on a restricted, but increasing, [[Oyster card (pay as you go) on National Rail|number of routes]].<ref>{{cite web | title =Oyster Help | publisher =Transport for London | url =http://transportforlondon.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/transportforlondon.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=&p_lva=&p_li=&p_faqid=%2011 | accessdate =2008-07-11  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title =Transport Secretary and Mayor of London announce new Oyster deal | publisher = Transport for London | date =2006-05-10 | url =http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/3597.aspx  | accessdate =2008-07-11 }}</ref>

For tourists or other non-residents, not needing to travel in the morning peak period, the all day travelcard is the best ticketing option available. These are available from any underground station. These cost around £5.50 and allow unlimited travel on the network from 9:30am onwards for the rest of the day. This provides excellent value for money and a huge saving considering one single journey on the network can cost close to £5. Travel cards for multiple days are also available. 

====Penalty fares and fare evasion====
In addition to automatic and staffed ticket gates, the Underground is patrolled by both uniformed and plain-clothes ticket inspectors with hand-held [[Oyster card]] readers. Passengers travelling without a ticket valid for their entire journey are required to pay at least a £20 [[penalty fare]] and can be prosecuted for fare evasion under the [[Regulation of Railways Act 1889]] under which they are subject to a fine of up to £1,000, or three months' imprisonment. [[Oyster card|Oyster]] pre-pay users who have failed to touch in at the start of their journey are charged the maximum cash fare (£4, or £5 at some [[National Rail]] stations) upon touching out. In addition, an Oyster card user who has failed to touch in at the start of their journey and who is detected mid-journey (''i.e.'' on a train) by an Inspector is now liable to a penalty fare of £20. No £4 maximum charge will be applied at their destination as the inspector will apply an 'exit token' to their card.

While the Conditions of Carriage require period Travelcard holders to touch in and touch out at the start and end of their journey, any Oystercard user who has a valid period Travelcard covering their entire journey is not liable to pay a Penalty fare where they have not touched in. Neither the Conditions of Carriage or Schedule 17 of the [[Greater London Authority Act 1999]], which shows how and when Penalty fares can be issued, would allow the issuing of a Penalty fare to a traveller who had already paid the correct fare for their journey.

===Delays===
According to statistics obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act]], the average commuter on the Metropolitan line wasted three days, 10 hours and 25 minutes in 2006 due to delays (not including missed connections).<ref>{{cite news  | last =Stephens | first =Alex  | title =Tube wastes three days a year of your life | publisher =The Harrow Observer | date =2006-12-06 | url =http://www.harrowobserver.co.uk/west-london-news/tm_headline=tube-wastes-three-days-a-year-of-your-life&method=full&objectid=18244569&siteid=53431-name_page.html | accessdate = 2008-07-11 }}</ref> Between 17 September 2006 and 14 October 2006, figures show that 211 train services were delayed by more than 15 minutes.<ref name="performance">

===Hours of operation===
The Underground does not run 24 hours a day (except at New Year and major public events - such as the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002 and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Olympics]] in 2012) because most lines have only two tracks (one in each direction) and therefore need to close at night for planned maintenance work. First trains start operating around 04:30, running until around 01:30. Unlike systems such as the [[New York City Subway]], few parts of the Underground have express tracks that allow trains to be routed around maintenance sites. Recently, greater use has been made of weekend closures of parts of the system for scheduled engineering work.

===Accessibility===
[[Accessibility]] by people with mobility issues was not considered when most of the system was built, and most older stations are inaccessible to disabled people. More recent stations were designed for accessibility, but [[retrofit]]ting accessibility features to old stations is at best prohibitively expensive and technically extremely difficult, and often impossible. Even when there are already [[escalator]]s or [[Elevator|lift]]s, there are often steps between the lift or escalator landings and the platforms.

Most stations on the surface have at least a short flight of stairs to gain access from street level, and the great majority of below-ground stations require use of stairs or some of the system's 410 escalators (each going at a speed of {{convert|145|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} per minute, approximately {{convert|1.65|mph|0|abbr=on}}). There are also some lengthy walks and further flights of steps required to gain access to platforms. The emergency stairs at [[Covent Garden tube station|Covent Garden]] station have 193 steps (the equivalent climbing a 15-storey building) to reach the exit,<ref>{{cite web | title = London's shortest tube journey | work = The Big Smoke | publisher = [[Time Out]] | date = 2007-04-17 | url = http://www.timeout.com/london/features/2816.html | accessdate = 2008-06-05 | quote = I have important advice for you. Never ever, under any circumstances, take the stairs. Don’t do it because although you think it might be quicker than waiting for the lift it won’t be, and the ascent will destroy you. There are 193 steps, and that’s the equivalent of climbing to the top of a 15-storey building.}}</ref> so passengers are advised to use the lifts as climbing the steps can be dangerous.

The escalators in Underground stations include some of the longest in Europe, and all are custom-built. The longest escalator is at [[Angel tube station|Angel station]], {{convert|60|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, with a vertical rise of {{convert|27.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="facts"/> They run 20 hours a day, 364 days a year, with 95% of them operational at any one time, and can cope with 13,000 passengers per hour. Convention and signage stipulate that people using escalators on the Underground ''stand'' on the right-hand side so as not to obstruct those who ''walk'' past them on the left.

TfL produces a map indicating which stations are accessible, and since 2004 line maps indicate with a [[wheelchair]] symbol those stations that provide step-free access from street level. Step height from platform to train is up to {{convert|300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and there can be a large gap between the train and curved platforms. Only the [[Jubilee Line Extension]] is completely accessible.

TfL plans that by 2020 there should be a network of over 100 fully accessible stations, consists of those recently built or rebuilt, and a handful of suburban stations that happen to have level access, along with selected 'key stations', which will be rebuilt. These key stations have been chosen due to high usage, interchange potential, and geographic spread, so that up to 75% of journeys will be achievable step-free.<ref>{{cite web | title =Unlocking London for all | publisher =Transport for London | url =http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tube/using/getting-around/unlocking_london/mobilitycontents.asp | accessdate = 2008-07-11 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2008}}</ref>

===Overcrowding===
Overcrowding on the Underground has been of concern for years and is very much the norm for most commuters especially during the morning and evening rush hours. Stations which particularly have a problem include [[Camden Town tube station|Camden Town station]] and [[Covent Garden tube station|Covent Garden]], which have access restrictions at certain times<ref>{{cite web | title = Tube Map | |date=May 2008|publisher =Transport for London | url =http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/Standard-Tube-map.pdf | accessdate = 2008-07-11|format=PDF}}</ref>. Restrictions are introduced at other stations when necessary. Several stations have been rebuilt to deal with overcrowding issues, with Clapham Common and Clapham North on the Northern line being the last remaining stations with a single narrow platform with tracks on both sides. At particularly busy occasions, such as [[Soccer|football]] matches, [[British Transport Police]] may be present to help with overcrowding.

On 24 September 2007 the entirety of King's Cross underground station was closed due to "overcrowding".{{Fact|date=October 2008}} Some stations are closed or are made exit-only stations due to overcrowding in peak periods. At other times trains simply don't stop at the overcrowded station and go onto the next closest station, in places where there is another station within walking distance. Overcrowding can also be limited by temporarily disallowing passengers from passing through ticket gates to the platforms at some stations.

According to a 2003 House of Commons report,<ref>{{cite news  | title =Commuters face 'daily trauma' | publisher =[[BBC News]] | date =2003-10-15 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3191562.stm | accessdate = 2007-01-18 }}</ref> commuters faced a "daily trauma" and were forced to travel in "intolerable conditions".

===Safety===
{{Main|Safety on the London Underground}}

[[London Underground accidents|Accidents on the Underground network]], which carries around a billion passengers a year, are rare.   There is one fatal accident for every 300 million journeys.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/research/backgrounders/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2155915 Safety first.] ''[[The Economist]]'' (23 October 2003) Retrieved 3 December 2006.</ref> There are several [[safety]] warnings given to passengers, such as the '[[mind the gap]]' announcement and the regular announcements for passengers to keep behind the yellow line. Relatively few accidents are caused by overcrowding on the platforms, and staff monitor platforms and passageways at busy times prevent people entering the system if they become overcrowded. 

Most fatalities on the network are [[suicide]]s. Most platforms at deep tube stations have pits beneath the track, originally constructed to aid drainage of water from the platforms, but they also help prevent death or serious injury when a passenger falls or jumps in front of a train.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Coats | first =T.

TfL's [[Tube map]] and "[[roundel]]" [[logo]] are instantly recognisable by any Londoner, almost any Briton, and many people around the world. The original maps were often street maps with the lines superimposed, and the stylised Tube map evolved from a design by electrical engineer [[Harry Beck (graphic designer)|Harry Beck]] in 1931.<ref>{{cite web | last =Beck | first =Harry | authorlink =Harry Beck | title =Tube Map | publisher =Transport for London | url =http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/images/general/beckmap1.jpg | accessdate = 2008-07-11 }}</ref>  Virtually every major urban rail system in the world now has a map in a similar stylised layout and many bus companies have also adopted the concept. TfL licences the sale of clothing and other accessories featuring its graphic elements and it takes legal action against unauthorised use of its trademarks and of the Tube map. Nevertheless, unauthorised copies of the logo continue to crop up worldwide. The announcement "[[mind the gap]]", heard when trains stop at certain platforms, has also become a well known catchphrase.

===The roundel===
[[Image:LU Leytonstone sign.jpg|thumb|The use of the roundel with the station name in the blue bar dates from 1908. The roundel seen above can be found at [[Leytonstone tube station]].]]
[[Image:Roundelfamily.jpg|thumb|A few of the Roundels used.]]
The origins of the [[roundel]], in earlier years known as the 'bulls-eye' or 'target', are obscure. While the first use of a roundel in a London transport context was the 19th-century symbol of the [[London General Omnibus Company]] — a wheel with a bar across the centre bearing the word '''GENERAL''' —  its usage on the Underground stems from the decision in 1908 to find a more obvious way of highlighting station names on platforms. The red circle with blue name bar was quickly adopted, with the word "U<small>NDERGROUN</small>D" across the bar, as an early corporate identity.<ref>{{cite web | title =Logo | publisher =[[London Transport Museum]] | url =http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/exhibitions/online_exhibitions/logo/index.html | accessdate = 2008-07-11}} {{Dead link|date=July 2008}}</ref>  The logo was modified by [[Edward Johnston]] in 1919.

Each station displays the Underground roundel, often containing the station's name in the central bar, at entrances and repeatedly along the platform, so that the name can easily be seen by passengers on arriving trains. 

The roundel has been used for buses and the tube for many years, and since [[Transport for London|TfL]] took control it has been applied to other transport types (taxi, [[Tramlink|tram]], [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]], etc.) in different colour pairs. The roundel has to some extent become a symbol for London itself.

The 100th anniversary of the roundel was celebrated by TfL commissioning 100 news works that celebrate the design.
===Typography===
Edward Johnston designed TfL's distinctive [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]], in 1916. The typeface is still in use today although substantially modified in 1979 by Eiichi Kono at Banks & Miles to produce "[[Johnston (typeface)|New Johnston]]". It is noted for the curl at the bottom of the [[Lower case|minuscule]] ''l'', which other sans-serif typefaces have discarded, and for the diamond-shaped [[tittle]] on the minuscule ''i'' and ''j'', whose shape also appears in the [[full stop]], and is the origin of other punctuation marks in the face. TfL owns the copyright to and exercises control over the New Johnston typeface, but a close approximation of the face exists in the [[TrueType]] computer font ''Paddington'', and the [[Gill Sans]] typeface also takes inspiration from Johnston.

===Contribution to arts===
[[Image:RussellSqTilework.jpg|thumb|An Edwardian tile pattern at [[Russell Square tube station]]]]
The Underground currently sponsors and contributes to the arts via its [[Platform for Art]] and [[Poems on the Underground]] projects. Poster and billboard space (and in the case of [[Gloucester Road tube station]], an entire disused platform) is given over to artwork and poetry to "create an environment for positive impact and to enhance and enrich the journeys of ... passengers".<ref>{{cite web | title =Platform art | publisher =Transport for London | url =http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tube/arts/platform-for-art | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2008}}</ref> 

Its artistic legacy includes the employment since the 1920s of many well-known graphic designers, illustrators and artists for its own publicity posters. Designers who produced work for the Underground in the 1920s and 1930s include [[Man Ray]], Edward McKnight Kauffer and [[Fougasse (cartoonist)|Fougasse]]. In recent years the Underground has commissioned work from leading artists including [[R. B. Kitaj]], [[John Bellany]] and [[Howard Hodgkin]].

In architecture, [[Leslie Green]] established a house style for the new stations built in the first decade of the 20th century for the Bakerloo, Piccadilly and Northern lines which included individual Edwardian tile patterns on platform walls.<ref name=edwardiantilepatterns>Many of these tile patterns survive, though a significant number of these are now replicas &ndash; {{ cite web | title = London Underground's Edwardian Tile Patterns | publisher = Doug Rose | url=http://www.dougrose.co.uk/ | accessdate = 2007-07-12 }}</ref> In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Charles Holden]] designed a series of [[modernist]] and [[art-deco]] stations for which the Underground remains famous. Holden's design for the Underground's headquarters building at [[55 Broadway]] included avant-garde sculptures by [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Eric Gill]] and [[Henry Moore]] (his first public commission). [[Misha Black]] was appointed design consultant for the 1960s Victoria Line, contributing to the line's uniform look<ref>{{cite web | title =Black, Sir Misha | publisher =[[20th Century London]] | url =http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=conInformationRecord.150  | accessdate = 2008-06-25}}</ref>, while the 1990s extension of the Jubilee line featured stations designed by leading architects such as [[Norman Foster]], [[Michael Hopkins]] and [[Will Alsop]].

Many stations also feature unique interior designs to help passenger identification. Often these have themes of local significance. Tiling at [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] incorporates repetitions of [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s silhouette. [[Tottenham Court Road tube station|Tottenham Court Road]] features semi-abstract mosaics by [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] representing the local music industry at [[Denmark Street]]. Northern line platforms at [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross]] feature murals by [[David Gentleman]] of the construction of [[Charing Cross]] itself.

===In popular culture===
{{main|London Underground in popular culture}}

The Underground has been featured in many movies and television shows, including ''[[Sliding Doors]]'',  ''[[Tube Tales]]'' and ''[[Neverwhere]]''. The London Underground Film Office handles over 100 requests per month. The Underground has also featured in music such as [[The Jam]]'s "[[Down in the Tube Station at Midnight]]" and in literature such as the graphic novel ''[[V for Vendetta]]''. Popular legends about the Underground being haunted persist to this day.<ref>{{ cite web | title = London Underground Ghosts | publisher = BBC h2g2 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A673391 | accessdate = 2007-10-14 }}</ref>

After placing a number of spoof announcements on her web page, London Underground voiceover artiste [[Emma Clarke]] had further contracts cancelled in 2007. <ref>{{cite news  | last = Griffiths | first = Peter | title = Subway announcer fired over spoof messages | publisher = Reuters | date = 2007-11-26 | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2663927720071126|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Clarke | first = Emma | title = Spoof london Underground Announcements | Publisher = Emma Clarke – Voiceover and writer for radio, television and new media | url = http://www.emmaclarke.com/fun/mind-the-gap/spoof-london-underground-announcements|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref>
