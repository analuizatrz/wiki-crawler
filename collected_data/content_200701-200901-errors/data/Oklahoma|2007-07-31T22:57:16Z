'''Oklahoma''' ([[IPA]]: /[[IPA chart for English|{{IPA|ˌoʊ.kləˈhoʊ.mə}}]]/) is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the south-central region of the [[United States of America]]. Nicknamed the "Sooner State," it is part of a region commonly known as the American [[Heartland]]. The state's name, derived from the [[Choctaw]] words ''okla'' and ''homma'', literally means "red people," and was chosen during the 1866 treaty negotiations by Allen Wright, the Principal Chief of the Choctaw Nation.<ref name="Oklahoma State History and Information">{{cite web | url=http://www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/stinfo2.html | title=Oklahoma State History and Information | work=A Look at Oklahoma | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation | language=English | accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref><ref name="Chronicles of Oklahoma">{{cite web | last=Merserve | first=John | year=1941 | month=December | url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v019/v019p314.html | title=Chief Allen Wright| work=Chronicles of Oklahoma | language=English | accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref><ref name="Kappler's Indian Affairs">{{cite web | last=Kappler | first=Charles J. | year=1904 | url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/cho0918.htm | title=Treaty with the Choctaw and Chickasaw, 1866| work=Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties | language=English | accessdate=2007-01-18}}</ref> With more distinct [[ecosystems]] per-mile than any other state, Oklahoma contains the nation's most diverse terrain,<ref name="Oklahoma Terrain">{{ cite web | date=2006-01-12 | url=http://www.travelok.com/atv/index.asp | title= Oklahoma, All Terrain Vacation | work=TravelOK | publisher=TravelOK.com | language=English | accessdate=2006-07-15 }}</ref> and is placed geographically in the Southern United States by the [[United States Census Bureau]]. [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]] is its capital and largest city. 

Oklahoma became the 46th state in the Union on November 16, 1907. As [[Indian Territory]], it was home for thousands of American Indian settlers who traveled the [[Trail of Tears]] with the forced removal of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] from the southeastern United States. Situated along the routes of [[Cattle drives in the United States|cattle drive]]s, a destination for white settlers during the [[Oklahoma Land Run]]s, and a focal point in the American oil boom, the state developed a combination of [[Western United States|Western]] and [[Native American]] heritage that played a large part in its cultural development. The [[Gilcrease Museum]], located in [[Tulsa]], is home to the largest, most comprehensive collection of [[American West]]ern art and artifacts in the world.<ref>{{cite web| title =Urban Turf| publisher =TravelOK.com| url =http://www.travelok.com/atv/urban.asp| accessdate =2007-06-20}}</ref> Today, the state contains more native American tribal headquarters than any other state, as well as the nation's largest [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] population.<ref name="Oklahoma State facts">{{cite web | url=http://www.50states.com/facts/okla.htm | title=Oklahoma state facts | work=Oklahoma facts| publisher=50states.com | language=English | accessdate=2007-02-07}}</ref>

Oklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States,<ref>{{cite web| title = Land and Water Area of States, 2000| publisher = Information Please| date = 2006| url = http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108355.html | accessdate = 2006-11-22}}</ref> covering an area of 69,960 square miles (181,196 km²). It is one of six states on the [[Frontier Strip]], and lies partly in the [[Great Plains]] near the geographical center of the 48 [[Continental United States|contiguous states]]. It is bounded on the east by [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], on the north by [[Kansas]], on the northwest by [[Colorado]], on the far west by [[New Mexico]], and on the south and near-west by [[Texas]].

===Climate===
Oklahoma is situated at the heart of [[Tornado Alley]] in a region dominated by colliding cold and warm [[air mass]]es that produce a wide range of weather patterns. Categorizied with a [[temperate climate|temperate]] [[continental climate| continental]] climate, weather patterns vary widely throughout the state. A [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical zone]] near Oklahoma's southeastern border is influenced heavily by southerly winds bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, but transitions progressively to a [[semi-arid]] zone in the [[High Plains]] of the panhandle rarely touched by southern moisture.<ref name= "The Climate of Oklahoma"/> Precipitation and temperatures vary widely accordingly, with areas near the Texas border holding an annual mean temperature of {{convert|62|°F|°C|0|lk=on}} and an annual rainfall of 56 inches, while areas of the panhandle average {{convert|58|°F|°C|0}}, with an annual rainfall of under 17 inches.

{{Main|Government of Oklahoma}}
The [[capital]] of the state is [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]] and the [[Governor of Oklahoma]] is [[Brad Henry]] (Democrat). Other Executive Branch elected officials include [[Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma]] [[Jari Askins]] (Democrat), [[Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector|State Auditor]] [[Jeff McMahan (politician)|Jeff McMahan]] (Democrat), [[Attorney General of Oklahoma|Attorney General]] [[Drew Edmondson]] (Democrat), [[State Treasurer of Oklahoma|State Treasurer]] [[Scott Meacham]] (Democrat), [[Oklahoma Superintendent of Public Instruction|State School Superintendent]]  [[Sandy Garrett]] (Democrat), Labor Commissioner [[Lloyd Fields]] (Democrat), Insurance Commissioner [[Kim Holland]] (Democrat), and the three member State Corporation Commission which currently consists of [[Bob Anthony]] (Republican), [[Jeff Cloud]] (Republican), and [[Jim Roth]] (Democrat).  The Governor appoints the [[Secretary of State of Oklahoma|Secretary of State]], currently [[M. Susan Savage]] (Democrat). As a result of the 2006 elections, the Lieutenant Governor became Jari Askins (Democrat) and the new Labor Commissioner became [[Lloyd Fields]]. They took office on January 8, 2007.

[[Image:Oklahoma Capitol building with oil derrick.JPG|thumb|left|360px|Oklahoma Capitol building with oil derrick.]]
The [[Oklahoma Legislature|Legislature of Oklahoma]] consists of the [[Oklahoma Senate|Senate]] and the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Senate has 48 members serving four-year terms, while the House has 101 members with two year terms. The state has term limits for their legislature that restrict any one person to a total of twelve years service in both the House and Senate. In the 2007&ndash;2008 state legislature, the Republicans control the House of Representatives (57 to 44) and the Senate is currently evenly divided (24 to 24). This changes the government's make-up; before the 2004 election the Democrats had controlled both chambers since 1921. Republicans have never controlled the State Senate outright.

The state's judicial branch consists of the [[Oklahoma Supreme Court]], the [[Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals]], and 77 District Courts which serve one county apiece. The Oklahoma judiciary also contains two independent courts: a Court of [[Impeachment]] (which is the Senate sitting) and the [[Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary]]. Oklahoma is unusual in that it has two courts of last resort, the state Supreme Court hears civil cases, and the state Court of Criminal Appeals hears criminal cases (the state of [[Texas]] uses a similar system). Judges of those two courts, as well as the Court of Civil Appeals are appointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the state Judicial Nominating Commission, and are subject to a [[non-partisan]] retention vote on a six-year rotating schedule.

Due to Oklahoma's restrictive ballot access laws (deemed by many to be the most restrictive in the nation).{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, third parties have very limited access to the primary ballots. However, the state does have the following active third parties: [[Oklahoma Libertarian Party]], [[Green Party of Oklahoma]], [[Oklahoma Constitution Party]]. There are also organizers from the [[Communist Party USA]] working in the state.

=== Local governance ===
The state is divided into 77 counties which deliver local government. Each is governed by a three member commission. Other county elected officials are the tax assessor, clerk, court clerk, treasurer, and sheriff. Cities and towns are established under the rights granted in the Oklahoma statutes (in comparison, Oklahoma gives municipal governments a great deal of latitude in chartering new governments). Towns are municipalities of under 1000 residents, while cities have more than 1000 residents. Major cities are also allowed to form "charter governments," in which the voters choose the form of government they want to use in place of the statutory forms. Other local government units in Oklahoma include independent and dependent school districts, Technology Center Districts (known as [[Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education|CareerTech]]), community college districts, rural fire departments, rural water districts, and other special use districts.

=== National politics ===
After the [[United States Census Bureau|2000 census]] the Oklahoma delegation to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] was reduced from six to five representatives. For the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] (2007&ndash;2009) there are no changes in party strength, and the delegation has four [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and one [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. Oklahoma's two U.S. senators are [[Jim Inhofe]] (Republican) and [[Tom Coburn]] (Republican). The U.S. Representatives are [[John Sullivan (U.S. Rep)|John Sullivan]] (Republican) of District 1, [[Dan Boren]] (Democrat) of District 2, [[Frank D. Lucas]] (Republican) of District 3, [[Tom Cole]] (Republican) of District 4, and [[Mary Fallin]] (Republican) of District 5.

Although there are more registered Democrats in Oklahoma than registered Republicans,<ref name="Voter Registration by Party">{{cite web | date=January 2007 | url=http://www.ok.gov/~elections/reg_0107.pdf | title= Registration by Party as of January 15, 2007 | format=pdf | work=Oklahoma State Election Board| pages=1 | publisher= Oklahoma State Election Board| language=English | accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref> it has become a solidly Republican state in presidential elections, voting for the Republican in every election from 1968 forward. (The 1976 Carter-Ford race was close, however.) In 2004, [[George W. Bush]] carried every county in the state and 65.6% of the statewide vote.

== Economy ==
Oklahoma is a major fuel and food-producing state; thousands of oil and natural gas wells dot the Oklahoma landscape, and the state is among the highest food producing states in the nation.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} Its main agricultural outputs are soy, wheat, cattle, dairy, poultry, and cotton.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} Oklahoma ranks fourth in the nation in the production of all wheat, fourth in cattle and calf production, fifth in the production of pecans, sixth in peanuts and eighth in peaches.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} Its industrial outputs are transportation equipment, machinery, electric products, rubber and plastic products, and food processing. Oklahoma had the 4th fastest growing GDP in the nation from 2005 to 2006. In 2006 Oklahoma's GDP was $105.7 billion, a 6.7 percent increase over 2005.<ref name="OK GDP">{{cite web | date=6/8/2007 | url=http://tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?articleID=070608_5_E1_hOkla78026 | title=State grows at brisk pace  | format=web | work=Tulsa World| pages=1 | publisher=World Publishing Co. | language=English | accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref> [[Image:Bb lake spillway.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Dam forming Broken Bow Lake.]]
[[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]] is one of the primary economic engines of the state, centered on the finance, retail, governance, entertainment, and tourism sectors. The city has numerous manufacturing and processing plants as well as a growing biotech research and health center. Oklahoma City has a large aviation market and its location at the intersection of [[I-35]], [[I-40]], and [[I-44]] makes Oklahoma City an important distribution point. Oklahoma City is home to many corporate and regional headquarters including [[Devon Energy]], [[Chesapeake Energy]], [[Sonic Drive-In]], [[AT&T]], [[The Hertz Corporation]], BancFirst, [[OGE Energy]], Midfirst Bank, [[Hobby Lobby]], [[Dobson Communications]], Express Personnel Services, Oklahoma Publishing Company, Spectro Wire & Cable, Inc., Rainbo Manufacturing, Globe Life and Accident Insurance, [[Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc.]], and [[Big Daddy's BBQ Sauce]].

[[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] is another primary economic engine of the state, centered on energy, aerospace, telecommunications, and transportation. The city has the nation's most inland sea port and Oklahoma's only connection to the ocean, the [[Tulsa Port of Catoosa]], which connects the state with international ocean trade routes through the [[Arkansas River]] and [[Mississippi River]]. Despite an oil bust that plagued the entire state in the 1980s, Tulsa is still among the top cities in the nation for the number of oil and energy related company headquarters. Tulsa is also home to an extensive aviation market, exemplified by its [[American Airlines]] maintenance center, the largest airline maintenance base in the world. Recently, Forbes magazine rated Tulsa as second in the nation in job income growth, and one of the best 50 cities to do business in the country.<ref name="forbestop50">{{cite web | date=2006 | url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/1/2813.html | title= Tulsa, OK: Best Places to do Business 2006 | format=web | work=Forbes Magazine| pages=1 | publisher= Forbes Magazine| language=English | accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref> Companies based in Tulsa include The NORDAM Group, [[BOK Financial Corporation]] (BOKF), Bank of Oklahoma, [[Williams Companies]], Oneok, Wiltel, [[QuikTrip]], Public Service of Oklahoma, [[Mazzio's]] Corporation, [[RibCrib]], [[SemGroup]], [[Thrifty Car Rental|Dollar-Thrifty]], [[Hilti]] USA, and [[The Vanguard Group]]. 

Both of Oklahoma's major metropolitan areas, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, are engaged in large-scale economic development and tourism initiatives.

== Transportation ==
Oklahoma is an integral point on the U.S. Interstate Network. Three major interstates connect at a point in [[Oklahoma City]] known as "The Crossroads of America." These interstates are: [[Interstate 35]], [[Interstate 40]], and [[Interstate 44]].

[[Interstate 35]] traverses the state from north to south across the center of the state. [[Interstate 40]] runs through the center of Oklahoma in a bisecting fashion, traversing in an east/west direction. [[Interstate 44]] runs through [[Tulsa]], bisecting the state from the northeast to the southwest. [[Interstate 44]] is a turnpike for most of its duration through the state, with exceptions within the cities of [[Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma City]], and [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]]. In addition, the state has 10 major turnpikes. Oklahoma also has the longest drivable stretch of [[Route 66]] in the country. 

The state is connected to the nation's rail network via the [[Heartland Flyer]], an [[Amtrak]]-operated rail line which stretches from [[Oklahoma City]] to [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. There are also plans to connect the Heartland Flyer to [[Tulsa]]. Two major airports serve Oklahoma: [[Will Rogers World Airport]] in Oklahoma City and [[Tulsa International Airport]]. There are also numerous other regional and general aviation airports. See [[List of airports in Oklahoma]] for further information. In addition, the [[Tulsa Port of Catoosa]], the nation's most inland seaport, is the state's primary connection to international ocean trade routes.

Because of Oklahoma's central location in the United States, the cultures of the Midwest, the Southwest, the West, and the Southeast all have a distinct impact. For example, [[Guymon, Oklahoma|Guymon]], in the state's panhandle, hosts one of the largest rodeos in the nation,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guymonrodeo.com/rodeohistory.htm | publisher=Guymon Rodeo Foundation | title=Rodeo History | accessdate=2007-05-02 }}</ref> typifying western Oklahoma's Southwest cultural influence. Meanwhile, [[Green Country (Oklahoma)|Northeast Oklahoma]] is influenced in large by midwestern and western cultures, while [[Kiamichi Country|Southeast Oklahoma]] is known as [[Little Dixie (Oklahoma)|Little Dixie]] because of its heavy southern cultural influence. Most of Oklahoma, furthermore, shares some degree of [[Native American]] cultural influence, dating to pre-statehood [[Indian Territory]]. The various government sponsored arts, community, and [[tourism]] programs emphasize Oklahoma's Native American heritage heavily. There are many central areas of Native American heritage in Oklahoma, including one of the most notable, [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Tahlequah]] which is near [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]] in eastern Oklahoma, is known for being the Capitol of the Cherokee Nation. Native American culture runs deep in the lives of Oklahomans and one may experience it through various cultural programs including pow wows, the Tsa-La-Gi village in Tahlequah, and the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum. Oklahoma is a center for Native American culture with a rich history before and after statehood in [[1907]], quickly developing a tradition of strongly embracing the state's roots, and there are 10 Native American languages with over 10,000 speakers. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of [[2006]], Oklahoma has an estimated population of 3,579,212, which is an increase of 35,770, or 1.0%, from the prior year and an increase of 128,558, or 3.6%,  since the year 2000. This does not include the natural increase since the last census in 2005 of 80,753 people (that is 264,324 births minus 183,571 deaths) and an increase due to net [[migration]] of 21,128 people into the state. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 36,546 people, and migration within the country produced a net decrease of 15,418 people.

The [[center of population]] of Oklahoma is located in [[Lincoln County, Oklahoma|Lincoln County]], in the town of [[Sparks, Oklahoma|Sparks]] [http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt].
{{US Demographics}}
[[Image:Oklahoma population map.png|thumb|300px|right|Oklahoma Population Density Map]]
The five largest ancestry groups in Oklahoma are [[German American|German]] (14.5%), American (13.1%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (11.8%), [[English American|English]] (9.6%), [[African Americans]] (8.1%) and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] (7.9%, with [[Cherokee]]s as the largest tribe, although the total number of Oklahoma's American Indian tribes is 50). {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Descendants of these people still live in Oklahoma today. There are estimates of over a quarter of Oklahoma's white (and black) populations have a certain degree of American Indian ancestries.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

Counties with the names of these tribes also exist. Oklahoma has the second highest number of Native Americans/Amerindians in the country estimated at 395,219 as of 2003. Only California has a higher Amerindian population at 682,720 [http://eire.census.gov/popest/data/states/ST-EST2002-ASRO-04.php]. Oklahoma also has the second highest concentration of Native Americans/Amerindians in the nation with 11.4% of the state's population, topped only by Alaska at 19% of that state's population. [http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/c2kbr01-15.pdf]. 39 of the Amerindian tribes currently living in Oklahoma are headquartered in the state. [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] predominate in eastern Oklahoma, there are predominantly American Indian communities and towns.

In ethnic diversity, [[German Americans]] are present in the northwestern part of the state. Oklahomans of [[British American|British]] (English or Scottish) ancestry dominate Tulsa and some other areas. African Americans are a plurality in Lawton and Oklahoma City, but have their own communities in Central parts of the state and the historic Black community of [[Greenwood, Oklahoma|Greenwood]] inside the city of Tulsa. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. While Pittsburg county has many [[Irish Americans]] and North-central areas have some [[Swedish Americans]], there are small close-knit [[Italian American]] and [[Slavs|Slavic American]] (i.e. Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Czech and Slovak) communities ([[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]], [[McAlester, Oklahoma|McAlester]], [[Prague, Oklahoma|Prague]] and [[Fort Gibson, Oklahoma|Fort Gibson]]) in the state's eastern parts. 

Oklahoma City has the largest [[Asian American]] population in the state. In fact, Oklahoma City's population is 1.6% [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]], which is the twelfth-highest [[List of U.S. cities with large Vietnamese American populations|percentage among major American cities]]. Oklahoma City's gentrified [[Little Saigon|Asian District]] grew from Vietnamese American immigrants who were relocated to the state in the 1980s. While many of the neighborhood's residents and businesses are Vietnamese American, significant numbers of [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Thai American|Thai]], [[Filipino American|Filipino]], and [[Korean American]]s also live, work, and study in the Asian district and surrounding area.

A few western counties have significant [[Mexican American]] populations; since 1990, immigrants from Latin America settled down mostly in sections of Tulsa and Oklahoma City. [[Arab Americans]] became a sizable ethnic group in the state's urban areas since the first wave of immigrants in the 1970s, the majority came from the oil-rich [[Persian Gulf]] countries. 6.8% of Oklahoma's population was reported as under 5, 25.9% under 18, and 13.2% was 65 or older. Females made up approximately 50.9% of the population. The state has an above-average birth rate than most of the United States.  Oklahoma has dealt with many [[socioeconomic]] issues, as the state's rank of annual household income is 36th in the 2000 US Census, below national average and the state's poverty rate exceeds 15 percent, higher in rural areas. The state's 2000 per capita personal income was $23,517, 43rd in the nation. However, Oklahoma's cost of living index also among the lowest in the nation.<ref name="costofliving">{{cite web | date=March 2007 | url=http://www.okcommerce.gov/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=330&Itemid=411 | title= More or Less | format=web | work=Oklahoma Chamber of Commerce| pages=1 | publisher= Oklahoma Chamber of Commerce| language=English | accessdate=2007-04-5}}</ref> Oklahoma City suburb [[Nichols Hills, Oklahoma|Nichols Hills]] is ranked first on [[Oklahoma locations by per capita income]] at $73,661.

=== Religion ===
Oklahoma is part of the primarily [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Protestant]] region known as the "[[Bible Belt]]" spanning the Southeast and Midwest states, also known for strong politically and socially [[Conservatism|conservative]] views. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Tulsa is considered one of the "Buckles" of the Bible Belt, as it is the home of [[Oral Roberts University]].

The people of Oklahoma participate in 73 major religious affiliations ranging from the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] with 1578 churches and 967,223 members to the [[Holy Orthodox Church in North America]] with 1 church and 6 members. The state has a large Methodist population at over 300,000 members. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Oklahoma has a comparably small [[Jew]]ish community concentrated in Tulsa and Oklahoma City, and a growing [[Islam|Muslim]] population from recent immigrants from the [[Middle East]] also resides in the state's major cities. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Oklahoma has over 10,000 Native American members in the [[Native American Church]], but most Native Americans are practicing Christians, the majority are Baptists and Methodists, and some Catholics of French and Spanish influences like the [[Seminole]] and [[Quapaw]] tribes.

The 10 most popular religious affiliations (including "none") account for more than 90% of all Oklahomans:<ref>[http://thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/40_2000.asp Association of Religion Data Archives]</ref>
