'''Key''' is a [[Japan]]ese [[visual novel]] studio under [[Visual Art's]], known for making dramatic and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]-oriented visual novels. ''[[Kanon]]'' was Key's debut release, which combined an elaborate storyline, an up-to-date [[anime]]-style drawing style, and a musical score which helped to set the mood for the game. Key's second game, ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'' had a similar if not more complex storyline to ''Kanon'' and a more thorough gameplay. Both ''Kanon'' and ''Air'' were originally produced as [[Eroge|adult games]], but had non-erotic console ports released for the [[Dreamcast]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[PlayStation Portable]]. Key, as of July 2007, has released six games and has worked in the past with [[Interchannel]], [[Prototype (company)|Prototype]] and [[NTT DoCoMo]] for the consumer port releases of previous Key titles.

Every soundtrack that is released based from one of Key's titles is on a [[record label]] called [[Key Sounds Label]]. There are other albums on the label not directly related to the visual novels, such as two albums by [[Lia (singer)|Lia]] and one by [[Eufonius]]. The albums on this label have music composed by members from Key.

Three of Key's works, ''Kanon'', ''Air'' and ''Clannad'', have been made into [[anime]]. Key supervised the production of these anime while working with two animation studios, [[Toei Animation]] and [[Kyoto Animation]]. Toei Animation animated the first ''Kanon'' TV anime series, the [[Air (film)|''Air'' movie]] and the [[Clannad (film)|''Clannad'' movie]]. Kyoto Animation animated the ''Air'' TV anime series, the second ''Kanon'' TV anime series and the ''Clannad'' TV anime series.

==History==
Before forming Key, the founding members worked for another visual novel development company called [[Tactics (company)|Tactics]]. At the time of ''[[Dōsei]]'''s production, Tactics' first game, only two of Key's original staff worked on the game: [[Itaru Hinoue]] as art director and [[Shinji Orito]] as musical composer. After ''Dōsei'', the rest of Key's founding staff joined Tactics and contributed to two more games: ''[[Moon.]]'', and ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]''. After the release of ''One'', these developers transferred to [[Visual Art's]] where they created their debut title ''[[Kanon]]'' in 1999. ''Kanon'' was an [[Eroge|adult game]],<ref name="keyproducts">{{citeweb|url= http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/index.htm|title=Key's product list|accessdate=2007-05-03|language=Japanese}}</ref> though the scenes containing sexual intercourse were kept to a minimum. This gave the player more of a focus on the characters' stories and on the visuals and music, especially for a visual novel at the time of its release. A year later, in 2000, Key released their second game ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'', which was also an adult game and similar in storytelling to ''Kanon''.<ref name="keyproducts"/>

In 2001, Visual Art's created the [[record label]] [[Key Sounds Label]].<ref name="ksldisc">{{citeweb|url=http://key.soundslabel.com/discography.htm|title=Key Sounds Label discography|accessdate=2007-05-03|language=Japanese}}</ref> The music albums released by Key after this were put under this label, meaning that this does not include the first three albums which were released before it was officially formed. The first album on this label was ''[[Humanity...]]'', though the only direct connection to Key's works is that it contains a remixed version of the opening theme to ''Air''. The albums under this label are composed by Key's signature [[composer]]s: Jun Maeda, [[Shinji Orito]] and [[Magome Togoshi]]. Three of the albums feature songs sung by [[Lia (singer)|Lia]] and one other, ''[[Love Song (album)|Love Song]]'', features the singer [[Riya]] from [[Eufonius]]. Two [[drama CD]]s have been released as well.<ref name="ksldisc"/>

The third game named ''[[Clannad (visual novel)|Clannad]]'' is a [[visual novel]] similar to Key's previous games, but is entirely clean, without any [[Hentai|adult]] content. ''Clannad'' was meant to be released in 2002, but was delayed, leading to the game finally being released in 2004<ref name="keyproducts"/>. Seven months after ''Clannad'''s release, Key released their shortest game, ''[[Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume]]'', in late 2004. ''Planetarian'', in contrast to Key's past games, is a linear visual novel that does not require the user to make a choice, but to sit back and enjoy the story; this is what is referred to as a [[KineticNovel|kinetic novel]]. The company's fifth game was ''[[Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life]]'', an [[Eroge|adult]] game and sequel of sorts to ''Clannad'' released in 2005. Key released their sixth game, ''[[Little Busters!]]'', on [[July 27]] [[2007]].<ref name="keyproducts"/>

Starting in December 2007, Key will sponsor an [[Internet radio]] show in regards to Key hosted by [[Itaru Hinoue]], [[Shinji Orito]], and another named Chiro. Listeners can submit thoughts about the show and any requests they may have for the show, along with submitting questions to the host trio.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/blog/index.php?eid=132|title= Key's official blog entry announcement for Key's radio show|publisher=Key|accessdate=2007-11-20|language=Japanese}}</ref>

===Comiket involvement===
[[Image:Key's booth at Comiket 71.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Key's booth at [[Comiket|Comiket 71]].]]
[[Comiket]], short for Comic Market, is a large comic convention held twice a year in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] during August or December, which are referred to as the summer and winter Comic Markets respectively. Key has been an active participant in the convention since Comiket 59 in December 2000 where they sold ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'' releated products.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20021013195151/http://catalog-of-59.product.co.jp/visualarts.htm|title=Key's Comiket 59 products|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|accessdate=2007-11-29|language= Japanese}}</ref> Generally, the products Key sells at Comiket are very rare and cannot be bought anywhere else, which causes them to become collector's items and can be resold at higher prices on [[Online auction business model|online auctions]]. Typical products include: [[postcard]]s, [[telephone card]]s, [[calendar]]s, and posters. The products Key sells at Comiket are all related to the visual novels the company produces.

Key, through Visual Art's, generally participates at the winter Comiket in conjunction with other brands under Visual Art's, but has been known to appear at the summer Comiket too, such as with Comiket 70 in August 2006 where they sold ''[[Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume]]'' related products.<ref>{{citeweb|url= http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/c70/c70-goods.html|title=Key's Comiket 70 products|publisher=Key|accessdate=2007-11-29|language= Japanese}}</ref> The combined total of the products Key sells at a given Comiket range in price between 3,000 [[Japanese yen|yen]] (about [[United States dollar|US$]]27) and 5,000 yen (about US$45).<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030415211013/catalog-of-63.product.co.jp/key.html|title=Key's Comiket 63 products|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|accessdate=2007-11-29|language= Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://catalog-of-65.product.co.jp/|title=Brands under Visual Art's that participated at Comiket 65|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|accessdate=2007-11-29|language= Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url= http://web.archive.org/web/20061007075531/http://c67.product.co.jp/|title=Brands under Visual Art's that participated at Comiket 67|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|accessdate=2007-11-29|language= Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url= http://web.archive.org/web/20061005014437/http://c69.product.co.jp/||title=Brands under Visual Art's that participated at Comiket 69|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|accessdate=2007-11-29|language= Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url= http://web.archive.org/web/20070826204152/http://c71.product.co.jp/|title=Brands under Visual Art's that participated at Comiket 71|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|accessdate=2007-11-29|language= Japanese}}</ref> This includes the selling of music albums released under Key's [[record label]] [[Key Sounds Label]] which has been releasing albums since Comiket 60 in August 2001 with the release of the label's first two albums, ''[[Humanity...]]'' and ''[[List of Air soundtracks#Natsukage ／ nostalgia|Natsukage ／ nostalgia]]''.

==Staff==
===Main===
The main staff in Key are members that have had a hand in nearly every game released by Key and do the majority of the work involved. [[Jun Maeda]] has worked on the planning for the individual projects and is one of the main scenario writers; he has also composed music for all of Key's games.<ref>'''Untranslated quote:''' 自分の書いた曲では一番気に入ってます。<br>'''Translated quote:''' "Out of the songs I wrote myself, I like this one the most."<br>Kanon Original Soundtrack booklet, page 4.<br>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chudahs-corner.com/soundtracks/index.php?catalog=KSLA-0006|title=Chudah's Corner on the Kanon Original Soundtrack|accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref> [[Itaru Hinoue]] is Key's main artist and was the art director for Key's first three games.<ref name="hatena">{{citeweb|url=http://d.hatena.ne.jp/keyword/VisualArt%A1%C7s/Key|title=Information on Key|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> [[Na-Ga]], another prominent artist in the company, mainly worked with background art in earlier games, but with ''Little Busters!'' was given the position of co-art director with Hinoue.<ref name="littlebusters!">{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/newsoft/products.htm|title=Little Busters! products page|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> Further computer graphics have been provided in the past by two graphic artists, Shinory and Mochisuke.<ref name="kanon">{{citeweb|url=http://www7.tok2.com/home/bgr/pc18/kanon/kanon.html|title=Kanon staff information|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> Key's main [[composer]], [[Shinji Orito]], has been with the company since ''Kanon''.<ref>'''Untranslated quote:''' サウンド担当　折戸伸治<br>'''Translated quote:''' "Sound Director Shinji Orito."<br>Kanon Original Soundtrack booklet, page 5.<br>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chudahs-corner.com/soundtracks/index.php?catalog=KSLA-0006|title=Chudah's Corner on the Kanon Original Soundtrack|accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref>

===Other===
In addition to the main staff, there are others who have helped make the games released by Key. Tomotaka Fujii helped write the scenario for ''Air'', working as a scenario assistant.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www7.tok2.com/home/bgr/pc18/air/air.html|title=Air staff information|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> [[Eeji Komatsu]] worked as the art director for the [[KineticNovel|kinetic novel]] ''Planetarian'',<ref name="planetarian">{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/planetarian/|title=Key's official Planetarian website|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> and another artist, [[Fumio]], worked as the art director for ''Tomoyo After''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=5986|title=Tomoyo After staff information|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> Further scenario writers include [[Leo Kashida]], who has been working with Key since ''Tomoyo After'',<ref name="erogamescape">{{citeweb|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/creater.php?creater=938|title=Key staff members at erogamescape.ddo.jp|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> Yūto Tonogawa and Chika Shirokiri who both started working with Key since ''Little Busters!''.<ref name="littlebusters!"/> Two new composers named Manack and PMMK helped with the music in ''Little Busters!'', and [[MintJam]] helped with arrangement.<ref name="littlebusters!"/>

===Former===
Many of Key's staff have left the company over time. [[Naoki Hisaya]] had worked as one of the main scenario writers for ''Kanon'',<ref name="kanon"/> but once the project was complete left the company to work for another video game company, Siesta in 1999.<ref name="hatena"/> Another member of the staff that made ''Kanon'' was [[OdiakeS]], a composer who has since left Key. OdiakeS returned to help in two music albums, one each released for ''Air'' and ''Clannad'', but has done nothing with Key since 2004.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.beta.or.jp/~odiakes/|title=OdiakeS' personal website|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> One of the staff members for ''Air'', Takashi Ishikawa, only participated in this game as one of the scenario writers, but did not contribute in future games released by Key.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/creater.php?creater=941|title=Takashi Ishikawa's involvement in Key|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> Ishikawa has since moved to another brand in [[Visual Art's]] as of 2000. Kai, one of the scenario writers, contributed in ''Air'' and ''Clannad'', as did a different scenario writer named Tōya Okano. Kai moved to the company [[Ram (company)|Ram]] under Visual Art's in 2004 and Okano moved to the company Daikumaneko, also under Visual Art's the same year. Another scenario writer, [[Yūichi Suzumoto]], worked with Key between ''Air'' and ''Planetarian''. Suzumoto has since transferred to [[Leaf (company)|Leaf]] as of 2004 under the publisher Aquaplus. One of the original computer graphics artists, Miracle ☆ Mikipon, left after ''Clannad'', and a different computer graphics artist, Torino, worked with Key from ''Kanon'' until ''Clannad''. Mikipon had been working for [[Psycho (company)|Psycho]] under [[Nexton]] starting in 2004, but then moved onto the company Ham Ham Soft under Visual Art's; Torino left for Ram in 2004, also under Visual Art's.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.psycho-cop.net/ff.htm|title=Miracle ☆ Mikipon employed by Psycho|accessdate=2007-06-13|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://ram.product.co.jp/5staff.html|title=Torino employed by Ram as a background artist|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> [[Magome Togoshi]] had been with Key since ''Air'', working as one of the signature composers, but left the company in October 2006.<ref>{{citeweb|url= http://magome.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2007/07/key_8ca9.html|title=Magome Togoshi's official blog announcement of his resignation from Key|date=[[July 10]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-11-29|language=Japanese}}</ref>

==Impact==
According to Satoshi Todome's work, ''A History of Adult Games'', Key's impact on the visual novel, or rather primarily the [[Eroge|adult game]], world stems from before Key was formed and most of the founding members of Key worked for [[Tactics (company)|Tactics]] under [[Nexton]].<ref name="history-of-adult-games">{{citeweb|last=Todome|first=Satoshi|url=http://www.kyo-kan.net/column/eroge/eroge3.html|title=A History of Adult Games, chapter 3|accessdate=2007-11-22|language=Japanese}}</ref> Due to an influence by [[Leaf (company)|Leaf's]] visual novel ''[[To Heart]]'' released in 1997, the developers at Tactics created a simple formula for a game: a comedic first half with a heart-warming romantic middle followed by a tragic separation and finally an emotional reunion formed what is known as a "crying game". The main purpose of such a game is to make the player feel for the characters and make them cry due to emtional scenarios which serves to leave a bigger impact on the player after the game is over.<ref name="history-of-adult-games"/> Tactics' second title ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]'' was created based on this simple formula.

After ''One'' was complete, the development team quit Tactics to form Key where they developed their first title ''[[Kanon]]'' also based upon on this formula.<ref name="history-of-adult-games"/> ''Kanon'' was "heavily hyped [and] had gamers impatient until its release. It was only one game released by Key so far, and yet [it] had already sent major shockwaves around the industry. And yet another game [''Air''], two years later, sent even more shockwaves. ''Air'' was equally hyped and well received."<ref name="bluemist">{{citeweb|url=http://bluemist.animeblogger.net/archives/key/|title=Short Key history|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> The success of ''One'' and ''Kanon'' on Key's formula to create a "crying game" was later adopted by other visual novel developing companys which were influenced by this formula. Examples of this include: ''[[Kana: Little Sister]]'' by Digital Object, the ''[[Memories Off]]'' series by [[KID]], ''[[D.C. ～Da Capo～]]'' by [[Circus (company)|Circus]], ''[[Snow (visual novel)|Snow]]'' by Studio Mebius (also under [[Visual Art's]]), and ''[[Wind: A Breath of Heart]]'' by [[Minori]].<ref name="history-of-adult-games"/>

Key is one of seventeen brands under [[Visual Art's]] with games included in the [[Lycèe Trading Card Game]] published by [[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]. Characters from Key's first five games were included in the first three out of four Visual Art's card sets.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lycee-tcg.com/card_list_serch.cgi?version=VA1.1|title=Lycèe Trading Card Game Visual Art's 1.1 card set|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lycee-tcg.com/card_list_serch.cgi?version=VA2.0|title=Lycèe Trading Card Game Visual Art's 2.0 card set|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url= http://www.lycee-tcg.com/card_list_serch.cgi?version=VA3.0|title=Lycèe Trading Card Game Visual Art's 3.0 card set|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url= http://www.lycee-tcg.com/card_list_serch.cgi?version=VA4.0|title=Lycèe Trading Card Game Visual Art's 3.0 card set|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref> There are also seven out of fifty-five rare promotional cards with characters from Key titles.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lycee-tcg.com/card_list_serch.cgi?version=all&rare=P|title=Lycèe Trading Card Game promotional cards|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref> Other big-name visual novel companies included in the card game include: [[AliceSoft]], [[August (company)|August]], [[Leaf (company)|Leaf]], [[Navel (company)|Navel]], and [[Type-Moon]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lycee-tcg.com/card.html| title=Lycèe Trading Card Game card sets|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref>
