'''Ronald Ernest Paul''' (born [[August 20]] [[1935]]) is a 10th-term [[United States Congress|Congressman]], [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]), and a [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential candidate]] from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], seeking the [[2008 Republican presidential candidates|nomination of the Republican party]]. 

As a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he has represented [[Texas's 14th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] since 1997, and had previously served as the representative from [[Texas's 22nd congressional district|Texas's 22nd district]] in 1976 and from 1979 to 1985.

Paul advocates a limited role for the federal government, low taxes, [[free market]]s, a [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] foreign policy, and a return to monetary policies based on commodity-backed currency. He has earned the nickname "Dr. No" because he is a [[physician|medical doctor]] who votes against the bills he believes violate the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.com.com/They+call+him+Dr.+No+for+good+reason/2010-1071_3-940767.html|title= Perspective: They call him Dr. No for good reason|author= McCullagh, Declan|date= 2002-07-01|publisher= CNET News}}</ref>
In the words of former Treasury Secretary [[William E. Simon|William Simon]], Paul is the "one exception to the Gang of 535" on [[Capitol Hill]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/paul/bio.shtml|title= Congressman Ron Paul|accessdate= 2007-05-20|publisher= United States House of Representatives}}</ref> He has never voted to raise taxes or congressional pay, and refuses to participate in the [[Congressional pension|congressional pension system]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press97/prjan30.htm |title=Paul refuses to participate in "immoral" pension system |accessdate=2007-05-24 |date=1997-01-30}}</ref> He has consistently voted against the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]], and the [[Iraq War]].

==Early life and education==
Paul was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] to Howard Caspar Paul (1904–1997), the son of a [[Germany|German]] immigrant, and Margaret Paul (1908–2001), who owned a dairy farm outside Pittsburgh.<ref name=dailypaul>{{cite web |url= http://dailypaul.com/node/53|title= The American Dream - Through the Eyes of Mrs. Ron Paul|author= Paul, Carol|date= 2007-03-16|publisher= Daily Paul}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wargs.com/political/paul.html|title= The Ancestors of Ron Paul|accessdate= 2007-05-20|author= Reitwiesner, William Addams|publisher= Wargs.com}}</ref>  He was the third of five sons born during the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=dailypaul/> In his early years, Paul worked at his parents' dairy, delivered newspapers and worked in a drugstore.<ref name=dailypaul/>

He graduated from Dormont High School in [[Dormont, Pennsylvania|Dormont]], Pennsylvania in 1953. Paul attended [[Gettysburg College]] while delivering mail and laundry on the side, where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1957.<ref name=dailypaul/>

He was then accepted to [[Duke University School of Medicine]], where he received his [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) in 1961. He did his [[internship]] training at [[Henry Ford Hospital]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] from 1961 to 1962<ref name=dailypaul/> and [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1965 to 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=P000583|title= PAUL, Ronald Ernest|accessdate= 2007-05-20|publisher= United States Congress}}</ref>

==Medical career==
Paul interrupted his medical training to serve as a [[flight surgeon]] in the [[United States Air Force]] at [[Kelly Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] from 1963 to 1965.  He served in the [[Air National Guard]] from 1965 to 1968 while completing his medical residency in [[Pittsburgh]]. 

Paul began his medical practice in [[Lake Jackson, Texas]] as a specialist in [[obstetrics]]/[[gynecology]] and has delivered more than 4,000 babies. He took over the practice of a retiring doctor and was busy as the only obstetrician/gynecologist in [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]].  Paul said of his time as a doctor, "I delivered forty to fifty babies a month and did a lot of surgery."<ref name="texasmonthly2001">{{cite web |url= http://www.texasmonthly.com/2001-10-01/feature7.php|title= Dr. No|author= Gwynne, S.C.|date= 2001-10-01|publisher= ''[[Texas Monthly]]''}}</ref> 

Dr. Paul did not accept [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or [[Medicaid]] as a physician; instead, he would do the work [[Pro bono publico|for free]] or work out a lowered payment for needy patients.<ref name="paulfacts">{{cite web |url= http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070323/23paulfacts.htm|title= 10 Things You Didn't Know About Ron Paul|author= Burton, Danielle|date= 2007-03-23|publisher= ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Paul and his wife Carol have five children, Ronnie, Lori, Rand, Robert, and Joy. He also has 17 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.  Three of the children, Robert, Rand, and Joy, also became medical doctors. Rand specializes in [[ophthalmology]].  Like Congressman Paul, his daughter, Joy, specializes in obstetrics and gynecology.<ref name="firstfamily">{{cite web |url= http://www.dailypaul.com/node/185 |title= The First Family ???|author= Pyeatt, Matt|date= May 24, 2007|publisher= Daily Paul}}</ref>  Paul supported his children during their undergraduate and medical school years, refusing to allow them to take part in [[subsidy|subsidized]] federal [[student loan]] programs. He has not signed up for a [[congressional pension]] for the same reason.<ref name="paulfacts"/>

When her husband was campaigning in the 14th District, Carol Paul decided to help his campaign by compiling family recipes into a [[cookbook]] and sending it to constituents.<ref name="saynot">{{cite web |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/08/AR2006070800966_2.html|title= Congressman Paul's Legislative Strategy? He'd Rather Say Not.|author= Copeland, Libby|date= 2006-07-09|publisher= ''[[The Washington Post]]''}}</ref> The cookbook is filled with pictures of the large Paul family.  Since orginally published, five editions have been written.  She and other family members keep a "Recipe of the Week" on her husband's Congressional campaign website.<ref name="recipeofweek">{{cite web |url= http://www.ronpaulforcongress.com/html/recipe.html |title= Recipe of the week|author= Paul, Debbie|date= 2007|publisher= Ron Paul Congressional campaign}}</ref>

Paul usually goes home to [[Lake Jackson, Texas|Lake Jackson]] on weekends.<ref name="saynot"/>

==Early congressional career==
A prominent physician in his district when he went into politics, Paul became a [[delegate]] to the Texas state Republican [[Political convention|convention]] in 1974. He had decided to enter politics on August 15, 1971, when President [[Richard Nixon]] went off the [[gold standard]] completely.  He said,"After that day, all money would be political money rather than money of real value. I was astounded."<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> 

Paul was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congressman from the 22nd District of Texas in 1974, an election where Democratic candidates won heavily, against the incumbent Democrat [[Robert R. Casey]]. When President [[Gerald R. Ford]] appointed Casey as head of the [[Federal Maritime Commission]], a [[special election]] was held in [[April]] [[1976]] to choose a new congressman. Paul won that election but lost six months later in the [[general election]] to Democrat [[Robert Gammage|Robert A. Gammage]]. He then defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch. Paul won new terms in 1980 and 1982.

Paul delivered babies on Mondays and Saturdays during his entire term as the 22nd District representative.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

Paul was the first congressman to propose [[term limit]] legislation for the House of Representatives, where he declined to attend junkets or register for a congressional pension while serving four terms.<ref name="PVL">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n6_v17/ai_18535311 Paul vs. Laughlin - Ron Paul's campaign against Representative Greg Laughlin] on Find Articles accessed on [[May 5]] [[2007]]</ref> Paul was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[U.S. Senate]] in the 1984 [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] primary against [[Phil Gramm]]. In 1985, Paul returned to full-time medical practice and was succeeded in his seat by [[Tom DeLay]], then a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]]. 

==1988 presidential campaign==
In the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]], despite no previous affiliation with the Libertarian Party, Paul won the nomination of the [[United States Libertarian Party]] for the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidency]]. He placed third in the [[popular vote]] (with 431,750 votes - 0.47%), behind [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Michael Dukakis]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEEDB103AF93AA15751C1A96E948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fP%2fPaul%2c%20Ron|title=  1988 VOTE: The Final Word|date= 1988-12-29|publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''}}</ref>  Although he had been an early supporter of [[Ronald Reagan]], Paul was critical of the unprecedented [[deficits]] incurred by Reagan's administration, for which his opponent George H.W. Bush had been [[Vice President of the United States|vice-president]].<ref name="PVL"/>

During his time as Libertarian candidate, Paul gained supporters nationwide who agreed with him on many of his positions-- on gun rights, fiscal conservatism, home-schoolers, right-to-lifers, and others who thought the federal government was heading in the wrong direction.  These supporters formed a nationwide support base that encouraged him to return to office and supported him financially.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

==Later Congressional career==
===Campaigns===
In 1996, Paul returned to Congress after a tougher battle than he had faced in the 1970s.  His Republican primary opponent, [[Greg Laughlin]], had support from leaders within the Republican Party, including House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]].<ref name="PVL"/>  Incumbent Laughlin had switched from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to the Republican side the year before, but despite efforts by the national party, challenger Paul won the primary by a large margin.  Baseball player [[Nolan Ryan]] was his honorary campaign chairman.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> Paul was elected for the coastal 14th Congressional District rather than the 22nd District he had previously represented. The change in district was a result of the borders of redistricting<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ao.nictusa.com/ao/no/900023.html|title= Federal Election Commission Advisory Opinion Number 1990-23|accessdate= 2007-05-26|author= Elliott, Lee Ann|date= 1990-11-05|publisher= }}</ref> as Paul continued to maintain his home in Lake Jackson.

His Democratic opponent in the fall election, [[lawyer]] Charles "Lefty" Morris, lost in a close margin despite running numerous attacks on Paul, including his past votes to repeal federal drug laws and portions of old newsletters, assisted by the [[AFL-CIO]].  Paul in turn attacked Morris as a pawn of trial lawyers and big labor.  He raised more money than Morris, with the help of his national network of donors: $1.2 million to Morris' $472,153{{fact}}.  Ken Bryan, a Democratic consultant to some of Paul's opponents, has said, "He has one of the largest contributor bases in Congress, outside of the leadership."  Most of Paul's contributions are given in small amounts by individuals.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  That year, he had the third-highest amount of individual contributions of any House member, behind Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[Bob Dornan]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.reason.com/news/show/118086.html|title= Paul for President?:The maverick libertarian Republican talks on war, immigration, and presidential ambition.|accessdate= 2007-05-28|author= Doherty, Brian|date= 2007-01-22|publisher= Reason Magazine }}</ref>

In 1998 he again won the primary and the election and outraised his opponent by a large margin, $2.1 million to $734,000.  Opposing a Democratic rice farmer and former [[Matagorda County, Texas|Matagorda County]] judge, Loy Sneary, Paul won by 11 percentage points; he ran ads warning voters to be "leery of Sneary".<ref name="saynot"/> Paul accused Judge Sneary of voting to raise his pay by 5% and increasing his judge's travel budget by 400% in one year.  Sneary's aides said he had voted to raise all county employees' pay by 5% in a "cost of living" increase. Paul countered that he had never voted to raise congressional pay.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story.mpl/content/chronicle/metropolitan/98/08/15/notebook.2-0.html|title= Foes lock horns over Paul's radio ads|accessdate= 2007-05-26|author= |date= 1998-08-14|work= Campaign Notebook|publisher= Houston Chronicle}}</ref>  

In 2000, Sneary ran against Paul again, with Paul winning 60% to 40%{{fact}}.  He raised $2.4 million to Sneary's $1.1 million in that campaign{{fact}}.  Paul was re-elected in 2002. Unopposed in 2004, he was re-elected to his ninth term in the Congress, and he was re-elected again in 2006 for his 10th term by a 20-point margin.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006//pages/results/states/TX/index.html|title= State Races: Texas|accessdate= 2007-03-04|work= Elections 2006|publisher= CNN}}</ref>

===Principles===
''Texas Monthly'', calling Paul "both deeply principled and wholly uncompromised", wrote in 2001 that he does not take money from [[political action committee]]s (PACs), is not swayed by Congressional lobbyists, only votes on his "deeply held beliefs" and does not cut "backroom deals."  They write, "The phrase 'honest politician' is an oxymoron; yet in the sense that Paul never, ever votes against his stated principles... the phrase describes him."  Along with not signing up for a Congressional pension, Paul's Congressional office returns money to the government each year; in 2000, the sum returned was $50,000.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

However, records from the Federal Election Commission show that this reporting on his refusing PAC funds is not correct. Dr. Paul consistently received PAC money during the 1998, 2000, 2004,and 2006 congressional electoral cycles[http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/memberprofile.asp?cid=N00005906&Cycle=2006&CollapseAll=TRUE].  An political action committee called the Liberty PAC was created specifically to help elect Dr. Paul into Congress[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Political_action_committee#Current_Congressional_Leadership_PACs][http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.asp?strid=C00234641&cycle=1998][http://www.libertypac.net/] 
although Dr. Paul has since then de-associated himself with the Liberty PAC. 

"Dr. No" can be "maddeningly uncooperative" to his Republican colleagues because he will not give in to pressure to vote for bills that spend taxpayers' money or that he feels violate the Constitution.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  Once when former House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] exhorted every Republican to vote the party line, he said that Paul was exempt.<ref name="saynot"/> Fellow fiscal conservative [[Jeff Flake]] said in 2006, "When I'm the only no vote, I can usually rest assured he's on a plane somewhere."

===Relationship with district===
Paul continued to work as an [[obstetrician]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas]] even while serving in Congress, delivering many constituents' babies.  As of 2001, he was one of few doctors in the House (eight, including dentists) and part of an even smaller group that continued to practice while in office.  It is not unusual for him to be in his home district and hear a younger person call out, "You delivered me!"<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

Paul is against some legislation that coastal or rural congresspersons usually are not.  Paul's district in Texas borders the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with 675 miles of coastline and also includes suburbs of [[Houston]]; it was redistricted prior to the 2004 election. Paul is opposed to federally funded [[flood insurance]] because it requires those who do not live near flood zones to subsidize those who choose to live in an area that is prone to flooding and does not allow those in flood zones to choose their own insurer.  In an "overwhelmingly rural region," Paul opposes farm subsidies because they go to big corporations rather than small farmers. Despite voting against bills with large support in Congress, such as the farm bill, the congressman's "contrarian nature" and devotion to lowering taxes appeals to voters in the 14th District.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

While some politicians would find it unthinkable to vote against bringing "[[pork barrel spending|pork]]" to their home district, Paul spends time in the district to compensate for "violat[ing] almost every rule of political survival you can think of."<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  He sometimes spends three to four days a week in his district addressing constituents' concerns, often accompanied by one of his 17 grandchildren.  He attends graduations, civic ceremonies, and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] honor ceremonies.  In an expansive district, it is not unusual for him to log more than 300 miles per day visiting constituents or handling their concerns.  He is particularly effective at reaching 14th District voters on veterans' issues, such as procuring medals for war veterans who lost or never received their medals; he holds medal ceremonies for those whose medals are being presented.  He has helped senior citizens of the district get free or low-cost prescription drugs through a little-known drug company program.  His staff sends out birthday cards to constituents, as well as condolence cards on the deaths of family members.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

Paul sponsors many bills in Congress, many of which, like one he regularly introduces that would abolish the [[income tax]], do not get out of committee.  He has sponsored successful legislation to prevent the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] from seizing a church in New York state through [[eminent domain]] and a bill transferring ownership of the [[Lake Texana]] dam project from the federal government to [[Texas]].<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

===Legislation and affiliations===
Paul remains on good terms with the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and addressed its [[Libertarian National Convention|national convention]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.theadvocates.org/liberator/vol-09-num-10.htm|title= President's Corner|accessdate= 2007-05-28|date= 2004-06-09|work= Liberator Online, Volume 9, Number 10|publisher= Advocates for Self-Government}}</ref>

Paul served as honorary chairman and is a current member of the [[Republican Liberty Caucus]], a political action organization dedicated to promoting the ideals of individual rights, limited government and free enterprise within the Republican Party.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://fl.rlc.org/|title= RLC of Florida|accessdate= 2007-03-04|author= |date= |year= |work= |publisher= Republican Liberty Caucus of Florida}}</ref>

Unlike many political candidates, Paul receives the overwhelming majority of his campaign contributions (96.8% in 2005-2006) from individuals.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.asp?CID=N00005906&cycle=2006|title= Contributions|accessdate= 2007-05-25|work= Ron Paul: Campaign Finance/Money|publisher= OpenSecrets.org}}</ref>

==2008 presidential campaign==
{{main|Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008}}
Ron Paul formally declared his candidacy for the 2008 Republican nomination in [[March 12]], [[2007]], as a guest on ''[[Washington Journal]]'' on [[C-SPAN]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA031207.paul2008.EN.74141d9.html | title = Paul formally launches presidential bid | first = Gary | last = Martin | work = San Antonio Express-News | date = 2007-03-12 | accessdate = 2007-03-13}}</ref><ref>[http://chbn.com/Clip.aspx?key=1CD9E3A0397BCBEC Ron Paul announcing candidacy on C-SPAN]</ref> Political analyst [[James Kotecki]] interviewed him regarding his candidacy, [[foreign policy]], Congress and the Constitution, and personal liberties.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/jameskotecki James Kotecki interviews Ron Paul]</ref>

On February 20, 2007, prior to Paul formally announcing his candidacy, Radley Balko of FoxNews.com wrote an article<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,252847,00.html|title= Ron Paul, the Real Republican?|accessdate= 2007-05-09|author= Balko, Radley|date= 2007-01-20|publisher= FOXNews.com}}</ref> titled "Ron Paul, the Real Republican?"  Balko concludes the piece with these two  sentences.  "Of all the candidates so far declared, only Paul can credibly lay claim to the legacy of the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-[[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] revolution. How well he does, how long he lasts, and who ends up defeating him will reveal whether there's any limited government allegiance at all still stirring the Republican Party."

===Internet popularity===
There are many indicators that Paul is widely supported on the Internet.  The term "Ron Paul" has been measured as the top Internet search term by [[Technorati]].com<ref name="onlinerise">{{cite web |url= http://www.usnews.com/usnews/blogs/news_blog/070509/ron_pauls_online_rise.htm|title= Ron Paul's Online Rise|author= Wilson, Chris|date= 2007-05-09|work= |publisher= USNews.com}}</ref> since May 9, 2007, which ranks popularity in the [[blogosphere]]. The ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' article titled "Ron Paul's Online Rise"<ref name="onlinerise"/> states "Technorati spokesman Aaron Krane confirmed that, to the best of the company's knowledge, the online support for Paul is genuine. (Tech-savvy devotees occasionally attempt to enlist programs called "bots" to artificially boost their candidate on search engines, but Krane said Technorati is usually able to detect and delete the cheaters.)"
 
Paul also ranked 517th on Wikicharts,<ref>[http://tools.wikimedia.de/~leon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?lang=en&wiki=enwiki&ns=all&limit=1000&month=05%2F2007&mode=view wikicharts] May 9, 2007 data</ref> a measurement of most-viewed Wikipedia pages, above Republican contenders such as [[Mitt Romney]], [[Rudy Guiliani]], and [[John McCain]].

===May 3 GOP Presidential Debate===
Ron Paul participated along with nine other Republican presidential candidates in a televised [[Republican Presidential Debates, 2008|2008 Republican Presidential Candidates Debate]] on May 3, 2007. 

After the debate, [[Pat Buchanan]] told [[MSNBC]]'s [[Keith Olbermann]] that Ron Paul came the closest of all the candidates to classic conservatism.  [[Donald Luskin]] told [[CNBC]] that Paul was his "pro-stock market candidate."<ref>[http://youtube.com/watch?v=peBGJwE9NXo "Ron Paul in Debate at Reagan Library (May '07)" YouTube]</ref>

===May 15 GOP Presidential Debate===
In a [[May 15]] [[2007]], GOP debate in [[South Carolina]], Paul commented that America's history of [[interventionism]] in the [[Middle East]] has led to an unpopular view of the U.S. in Middle Eastern countries. Agreeing with what has previously been asserted by the [[9/11 Commission Report]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s specialists on [[al Qaeda]], Paul stated that the CIA removal of an elected [[Iran]]ian leader (the CIA's involvement in the 1953 military coup against the democratically elected leader of Iran [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]] in [[Operation Ajax]]) and the bombing of Iraq in the 1990s, culminating in the ongoing Iraq war, has led to increasing anti-American sentiment in the Middle East. Then he said:

{{Cquote2|They attack us because we've been over there. We've been bombing Iraq for 10 years. We've been in the Middle East [for years]. I think [Ronald] Reagan was right. We don't understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics. Right now, we're building an embassy in Iraq that is bigger than the [[Vatican]]. We're building 14 permanent bases. What would we say here if [[People's Republic of China|China]] was doing this in our country or in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]? We would be objecting.<ref name="RGVRP">{{cite news | url = http://news.yahoo.com/s/thenation/20070516/cm_thenation/45195576 | title = Rudy Giuliani Vs. Ron Paul, and Reality | publisher = ''[[The Nation]]'' | date = 2007-05-16 | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref> }}

After Paul had completed his answer, Rudy Giuliani interrupted the moderator and interjected that he thought Paul was implying that America had invited the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]]; he said:

{{Cquote2|That's really an extraordinary statement. That's an extraordinary statement, as someone who lived through the attack of September 11, that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq. I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11.<ref name="RGVRP" />}}

Paul defended his previous statement, which did not mention 9/11 specifically, but did say "they attack us"  and further explained: 

{{Cquote2|I believe the CIA is correct when it warns us about [[blowback (intelligence)|blowback]]. We overthrew the Iranian government in 1953 and their taking the hostages was the reaction. This dynamic persists and we ignore it at our risk. They’re not attacking us because we’re rich and free, they’re attacking us because we’re over there.}}

While Paul's assertions have received criticism from some pundits from the [[right wing politics|political right]] (particularly FOX news commentator [[Sean Hannity]]<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEZO7MPxJIs</ref> and GOP spokesman [[Michael S.

Former CIA analyst [[Michael Scheuer]], who headed the CIA's team of bin Laden specialists for years, agreed with Paul's statements:  

{{Cquote2|I thought Mr. Paul captured it the other night exactly correctly. This war is dangerous to America because it’s based, not on gender equality, as Mr. Giuliani suggested, or any other kind of freedom, but simply because of what we do in the Islamic World – because 'we’re over there,' basically, as Mr. Paul said in the debate."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.antiwar.com/blog/2007/05/19/former-head-of-cias-osama-unit-backs-up-rep-ron-paul/|title= Antiwar Radio: Scott Horton Interviews Michael Scheuer|accessdate= 2007-05-29|author= Horton, Scott|date= 2007-05-19|publisher= Antiwar.com Blog}}</ref>}}

Since the debate, Ron Paul and his position have also been defended by [[Lew Rockwell]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/paul-said-it.html|title= Ron Paul Said It|accessdate= 2007-05-26|author= Rockwell, Llewellyn H.|date= 2007-05-17|publisher= LewRockwell.com}}</ref> [[Pat Buchanan]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55763|title= But who was right – Rudy or Ron?|accessdate= 2007-05-26|author= Buchanan, Patrick J.|date= 2007-05-28||publisher= [[WorldNetDaily]]}}</ref> [[Accuracy in Media]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.aim.org/aim_column/5461_0_3_0_C/|title= Fox News' Pro-Giuliani Conflict of Interest |accessdate= 2007-05-26|author= Kincaid, Cliff|date= 2007-05-16|publisher= [[Accuracy in Media]]}}</ref> and other conservative and libertarian as well as more liberal commentators, including [[Joy Behar]] and [[Rosie O'Donnell]] on [[ABC]]'s ''[[The View]]''.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jetwXdBMwbQ</ref>

In a press release following the debate, Paul's campaign chairman Kent Snyder said in response to Giuliani, "It is clear from his interruption that former Mayor Giuliani has not read the 9/11 Commission Report and has no clue on how to keep America safe"<ref>[http://www.ronpaul2008.typepad.com/ Ron Paul Press Release May 16, 2007]</ref> and on [[May 16]], during an appearance on ''[[The Situation Room]]'' with CNN's [[Wolf Blitzer]], Paul asked for an apology from Giuliani and suggested that Giuliani should read the 9/11 Commission's Report.<ref>{{cite episode | title = May 16, 2007 | episodelink = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy4Eugc0Xls&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fblog%2Elewrockwell%2Ecom%2Flewrw%2Farchives%2F013040%2Ehtml | series      = The Situation Room | network = CNN | airdate = May 16, 2007}}</ref>

[[Andrew Sullivan]], an early supporter of the war, responded to Paul's remarks by saying:

{{Cquote2|The question serious supporters of a real [[war on terror]] must now ask is: will continuing the fight in Iraq help reverse this trend or cement it for decades to come? Is the war making us less secure and the world much less safe? Would withdrawal or continued engagement makes things better? At the very least, it seems to me, this question should be on the table in the Iraq debate. And yet the Republicans - with the exception of Ron Paul - don't even want to talk about it. Until they do, they are not a party serious about [[national security]].<ref>http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/05/blowback.html#more</ref>}}

In the debate, only Paul and [[John McCain]] would not endorse the United States using [[torture]] to obtain information from prisoners.<ref>http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/la-oe-brooks18may18,0,2989659.column</ref>

==Political positions==

{{main|Political positions of Ron Paul}}

In his [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], Paul has stated that he would like to "reinstate the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and restore the [[Republic]]." His voting record is consistent in rejection of a [[welfare state]] role for the federal government, and advocacy of [[Gold standard|hard currency]] and a [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] [[foreign policy]].
 
Paul is the only [[2008 Republican presidential candidates|2008 Republican presidential candidate]] to have voted against the [[Iraq War Resolution]] in 2002<ref>http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr090402.htm</ref><ref>http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr100802.htm</ref> and has offered alternatives, such as granting the President authority to grant [[Letters of Marque and Reprisal]], which would allow war to be carried out against individuals rather than foreign countries and allow local bounty hunters familiar with the Afghanistani terrain to be hired to capture [[Osama bin Laden]] and his co-conspirators. Paul released a statement about the bill:  "Paul's bill would allow Congress to authorize the President to specifically target Bin Laden and his associates using non-government armed forces. Since it is nearly impossible for U.S. intelligence teams to get close to Bin Laden, the marque and reprisal approach creates an incentive for people in Afghanistan or elsewhere to turn him over to the U.S."<ref>{{cite web | title=Paul Offers President New Tool in the War on Terrorism | author=Ron Paul | url=http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press2001/pr101101.htm | publisher= Rep. Ron Paul, official website | date=2001-10-11 | accessdate=2007-05-21}} </ref>  Paul would also allow armed commercial airline [[pilot]]s. 

Paul's desire to secure U.S. borders remains a key topic in his 2008 presidential campaign. He opposes the North American Union proposition and its proposed integration of Mexico, the United States of America, and Canada.  Paul voted "yes" on the [[Secure Fence Act of 2006]], which authorizes the construction of an additional 700 miles of double-layered fencing between the U.S and Mexico. Paul opposes [[illegal immigration]] as well as [[amnesty]] for illegal immigrants.  He also introduced legislation that would amend the Constitution to stop giving automatic citizenship to babies who are born in the United States  to non-citizen parents, which has been in effect since the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] was ratified in 1868.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rethinking Birthright Citizenship | author=Ron Paul | url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2006/tst100206.htm | publisher= Rep. Ron Paul, official website | date=2006-10-02 | accessdate=2007-05-20}} </ref>

In the May 3, 2007, GOP Debate, Paul stated that as President, he would seek the immediate abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and the abolition of the income tax. As Congressman, he has long fought for the [[Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_9:_Limits_on_Congress|prohibition of direct taxes]] by repeal of the [[16th Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment]] which created the [[income tax]].

Moreover, Ron Paul links his pro-life position closely to his libertarian views.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Ron_Paul</ref> Paul supports allowing individual states to decide on the legality of [[abortion]] citing that it is not an enumerated power of the federal government.<ref>[http://www.ontheissues.org/TX/Ron_Paul.htm position on states' authority regarding abortion laws]</ref> Accordingly, he has challenged [[Roe v. Wade]] for its unconstitutionality.<ref>[http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul98.html The Partial Birth Abortion Ban] speech</ref>

===Alleged racial remarks===	
A 1996 article in the ''Houston Chronicle''<ref name=HoustonChronicle>{{cite news | title=CAMPAIGN '96 U.S. HOUSE Newsletter excerpts offer ammunition to Paul's opponent | url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1996_1343749 | author=Alan Bernstein | publisher=Houston Chronicle | date=1996-05-23 | accessdate=2007-05-20}} also accessible [http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/aol-metropolitan/96/05/23/paul.html here]</ref> alleges that Ron Paul made comments in a 1992 edition of his ''Ron Paul Survival Report'' (a newsletter that he had published from 1985) which could be construed as racist, including disparaging remarks about fellow congressperson [[Barbara Jordan]], and that this could help his political opponents.<ref> The 1996 ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' article by Alan Bernstein quoted the ''Ron Paul Survival Report'' newsletter</ref> 	 

In a 2001 interview with ''Texas Monthly'' magazine, Paul acknowledged that the comments were printed in his newsletter under his name, but explained that they did not represent his views and that they were written by a ghostwriter. He further stated that he felt some moral responsibility for the words that had been attributed to him, despite the fact that they did not represent his way of thinking: 	 

<blockquote>"They were never my words, but I had some moral responsibility for them...I actually really wanted to try to explain that it doesn't come from me directly, but they [campaign aides] said that's too confusing. 'It appeared in your letter and your name was on that letter and therefore you have to live with it.'"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.latestpolitics.com/blog/2007/05/ron-paul-and-race-continued.html | title=Ron Paul and Race, Continued | author=Ryan Sager | publisher=The New York Sun | date=2007-05-18 | accessdate=2007-05-20}} quoting from {{cite news | title=Dr. No | author=S.C. Gwynne | publisher=Texas Monthly magazine | date =October 2001}}</ref><ref name=texasmonthly2001/></blockquote>	 

He further stated:	 

<blockquote>"I could never say this in the campaign, but those words weren't really written by me. It wasn't my language at all. Other people help me with my newsletter as I travel around. I think the one on Barbara Jordan was the saddest thing, because Barbara and I served together and actually she was a delightful lady... we wanted to do something on affirmative action, and it ended up in the newsletter and became personalized. I never personalize anything."<ref name=texasmonthly2001/></blockquote>	 

''Texas Monthly'' wrote in 2001, at the time they printed the denial, "What made the statements in the publication even more puzzling was that, in four terms as a U. S. congressman and one presidential race, Paul had never uttered anything remotely like this." They state that it would have been easier for him to deny the accusations at the time, because the controversy would have destroyed most politicians.<ref name=texasmonthly2001/>	 

In an April 2007 column on his official House of Representatives website,<ref name="2007racism">{{cite web | url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2007/tst041607.htm | title=Government and Racism | author=Ron Paul | date=2007-04-16 | accessdate=2007-05-20| publisher=Rep. Ron Paul, official website}}</ref> Paul criticizes [[racism]], saying:	 

:Racism is simply an ugly form of [[collectivism]], the mindset that views humans strictly as members of groups rather than individuals. Racists believe that all individuals who share superficial physical characteristics are alike: as collectivists, racists think only in terms of groups. By encouraging Americans to adopt a group mentality, the advocates of so-called "diversity" actually perpetuate racism. Their obsession with racial group identity is inherently racist.<ref name="2007racism" />
