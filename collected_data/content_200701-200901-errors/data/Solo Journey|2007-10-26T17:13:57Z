'''''Solo Journey''''' is [[Bradley Joseph]]'s third album, released in 1999 (see [[1999 in music]]), and first album on his own [[record label]], Robbins Island Music.  

==History==
Having previously recorded on the [[Narada Productions|Narada]] label and admitting it was a great experience music-wise, Joseph didn't like the lack of control over the end product, and asked to be released from his contract.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview">{{cite web |author=Wheeler,Fred|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20041101084648/http://www.indiejournal.com/indiejournal/interviews/bradleyjoseph.htm |title= Interview with Bradley Joseph|publisher = Indie Journal (archived version of indiejournal.com)|date = 2002|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref>  He started Robbins Island Music in 1998, composing, producing, and distributing his own recordings.  Hence, ''Solo Journey'' was released in 1999 and is comprised of eleven soft piano compositions.  While Joseph's first two releases, ''[[Hear the Masses]]'' and ''[[Rapture (Bradley Joseph album)|Rapture]]'', employ mainly orchestral compositions and arrangements, this album features Joseph on soft solo piano and is characterized as being a "scaled down introspective, ... and while simplistic was still breath-taking", by Michael Debbage of ''Wind and Wire Magazine''.<ref name="Christmas Around the World at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage">{{cite web|author=Debbage, Michael| url=http://www2.bitstream.net/~billb/bradley_joseph.htm|title= Review of ''Christmas Around the World''|publisher= Wind and Wire Magazine (windandwire.com)|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref> Joseph's goal for this album was to provide an "intimate and peaceful environment for the special times we all encounter in our lives".<ref name="AlbumNotesSJ">{{cite album-notes |title= Solo Journey|bandname=Bradley Joseph |year= 1999|format= CD liner|publisher= Robbins Island Music|publisherid=BJOS-2D}}</ref> Reviewing for ''Solo Piano Publications'', Kathy Parsons calls it a "beautiful musical excursion", "...inviting the listener to kick back and relax for a while"; although, as a piano teacher, she opined that "most of the piano parts sound electronic", stating, "As good as the electronic pianos have gotten, they lack the warmth and richness of a great acoustic grand."<ref name="SPP-Kathy Parsons-SJ">{{cite web |author=Parsons, Kathy|url=http://www.solopianopublications.com/reviews/joseph.htm |title=Review of ''Solo Journey''|publisher = Solo Piano Publications (solopianopublications.com)|date|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref>

Parsons observes that "The Long, Last Mile" starts out with a bittersweet melody, and then builds in intensity and complexity with cello, winds, and ethereal sounds intertwining around the piano. Then it breaks off, and the opening melody returns.   She describes "Winter Moon" as a simple, straightforward melody with a gentle rhythm; and "The Poetry Room" as almost minimalist in its simplicity, "also very beautiful".   She goes on to say, "'The First Snow'  gently describes the quiet but dazzling splendor of the first snow of the season. Joseph makes effective use of arpeggiated chords in the upper registers to depict the light dancing in sparkles.<ref name="SPP-Kathy Parsons-SJ"/>  

In 2003, Joseph released a sequel to this album, ''[[The Journey Continues]]''.<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage">{{cite web|author=Debbage, Michael |url=http://www.windandwire.com/february/the_journey_continues.htm |title= Review of ''The Journey Continues''
