'''Lead(II) nitrate''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] [[lead|Pb]]([[Nitrate|NO]]<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. It commonly occurs as a colourless [[crystal]] or white powder and, unlike most other lead(II) [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], is [[solubility|soluble]] in [[water (molecule)|water]]. 

Known since the [[Middle Ages]] by the name '''plumb dulcis''', the production of lead(II) nitrate from either metallic [[lead]] or [[lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] in [[nitric acid]] was small-scale, for direct use in making other [[Inorganic compounds by element#Lead (Plumbum)|lead compounds]].  In the 19th century lead(II) nitrate began to be produced commercially in Europe and the United States.  Historically, the main use was as a raw material in the production of [[pigment]]s for [[lead paint]]s, but such paints have been superseded by less toxic paints based on [[titanium dioxide]].  Other industrial uses included heat [[stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilisation]] in [[nylon]] and [[polyester]]s, and in coatings of [[thermography|photothermographic]] paper. Since around the year 2000, lead(II) nitrate has begun to be used in [[gold cyanidation]].

Lead(II) nitrate is [[toxicity|toxic]], an [[oxidizing agent|oxidising agent]], and is categorised as ''[[List of IARC Group 2A carcinogens|probably carcinogenic to humans]]'' by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]]. Consequently, it must be handled and stored with the appropriate safety precautions to prevent inhalation, ingestion and skin contact. Due to its [[Hazard|hazardous nature]], the limited applications of lead(II) nitrate are under constant scrutiny.

==History==
Since the Middle Ages, lead(II) nitrate has been produced as a raw material for the production of coloured pigments in [[lead paint]]s, such as [[chrome yellow]] (lead(II) chromate), [[chrome orange]] (lead(II) hydroxide chromate) and similar [[Inorganic compounds by element#Lead (Plumbum)|lead compounds]]. These pigments were used for [[dyeing]] and printing [[calico (textile)|calico]] and other textiles.<ref name="pigments">{{cite book | title = A Text-book of Inorganic Chemistry | publisher = MacMillan | year = 1950 | page = p.&nbsp;838 | first = James Riddick | last = Partington}}</ref>

In 1597, the German [[alchemy|alchemist]] [[Andreas Libavius]] first described the compound, coining the medieval names of ''plumb dulcis'' and ''calx plumb dulcis'', meaning "sweet lead", because of its taste.<ref name="libavius">{{cite book | first = Andreas | last = Libavius | authorlink = Andreas Libavius | title = Alchemia Andreæ Libavii | location = Francofurti | publisher = Iohannes Saurius | year = 1595}}</ref> Although originally not understood during the following centuries, the [[decrepitation]] property of lead(II) nitrate led to its use in matches and special [[explosive material|explosives]] such as [[lead(II) azide|lead azide]].<ref name="pyrotechnica">{{cite article | title = Lead nitrate as an oxidizer in blackpowder | work = Pyrotechnica | volume = IV | date = October 1978 | pp.&nbsp;16&ndash;18 | first = J.B. | last = Barkley | publisher = Pyrotechnica Publications | location = [[Post Falls, Idaho|Post Falls, ID]]}}</ref>

The production process was and still is chemically straightforward, effectively dissolving [[lead]] in aqua fortis ([[nitric acid]]), and subsequently harvesting the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]]. However, the production remained small-scale for many centuries, and the commercial production of lead(II) nitrate as raw material for the manufacture of other lead compounds was not reported until 1835.<ref name=britannica1911>{{cite web | url = http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Lead | title = Lead | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] | accessdate = 2006-10-11}}</ref><ref name=macgregor>{{cite book | first = John | last = Macgregor | title = Progress of America to year 1846 | publisher = Whittaker & Co | location = London | year = 1847}}</ref> In 1974, the [[United States|U.S.]] consumption of lead compounds, excluding pigments and [[gasoline]] additives, was 642&nbsp;tons.<ref name="greenwood">{{cite book| first = Norman N. | last = Greenwood | coauthors = Earnshaw, A. | year = 1997 | title = Chemistry of the Elements | edition = 2nd edition | pages = pp.&nbsp;388, 456 | location = Oxford | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | id = ISBN 0-7506-3365-4}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
===Aqueous chemistry===
Lead(II) nitrate readily [[solvation|dissolves]] in water to give a clear, colourless solution.<ref name="ferris">{{cite journal | first = L.M. | last = Ferris | title = Lead nitrate&mdash;Nitric acid&mdash;Water system | journal = Journal of Chemicals and Engineering Date| month = December | year = 1959 | doi = 10.1021/je60007a002 | volume = 5 | pages = 242}}</ref>  As an [[ionic compound|ionic substance]], the dissolution of lead(II) nitrate involves [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] into its constituent ions.
:Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>([[solid|s]]) → Pb<sup>2+</sup>([[aqueous solution|aq]]) + 2 NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>(aq)
Any [[solution]] containing the lead(II) cation will react with a solution containing the [[iodide]] anion to produce a [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] of the bright orange-yellow [[lead(II) iodide]]. This reaction is often used to demonstrate precipitation, because of the striking colour change observed, under the name ''Pot-o-Gold'' or ''Golden Rain'':<ref name="adlam">{{cite book | last = Adlam | first = George Henry Joseph | coauthors = Price, Leslie Slater | title = A [[Higher School Certificate (UK)|Higher School Certificate]] Inorganic Chemistry | location = London | publisher = John Murray | year = 1938}}</ref> 
:Pb<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2 I<sup>&minus;</sup>(aq) → PbI<sub>2</sub>(s)
Similar [[metathesis reaction]]s take place in the solid phase when appropriate solids, such as [[potassium iodide]] and lead(II) nitrate, are mixed and finely ground using a [[mortar and pestle]].
:Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(s) + 2 KI(s) → PbI<sub>2</sub>(s) + 2 KNO<sub>3</sub>(s)
The colour of the resulting mixture will depend on the relative amount of the [[reagent|reactant]]s used, and the extent of grinding; in any event, the colour will be paler than that of pure lead(II) iodide due to the presence of white solids within the mixture.

Apart from lead(II) nitrate, [[lead(II) acetate]] is the only other common soluble lead compound. Nearly all other lead compounds are insoluble in water, even when coupled with commonly very soluble anions. For example, [[lead(II) chloride]], [[lead(II) bromide]] and [[lead(II) iodide]], collectively known as lead [[halide]]s, are merely weakly soluble in water (less than 0.01 mol/l) at room temperature, and only slightly more closer to the boiling point. This means that lead(II) nitrate has particular importance as a starting point for the production of insoluble lead compounds via [[Metathesis reaction (chemistry)#Aqueous metathesis|double decomposition]]. 

Hot solutions of lead halides can be brought to precipitation on cooling to create feathery, iridescent crystals suspended in water, the colour of which crystal depends on the particular halide (chloride = [[white]], bromide = [[Buff (colour)|buff]], iodide = [[yellow]]). These crystals appear suddenly, requiring only a [[nucleation]] site once the temperature of the solution has fallen sufficiently for the solution to be [[supersaturation|supersaturated]]. This effect is used for demonstration of solubility in classrooms.<ref name="orna">{{cite book | title = The chemistry of rocks, minerals and gems.

When concentrated [[sodium hydroxide]] solution is added to lead(II) nitrate solution, [[Alkali salts|basic nitrate]]s are formed, even well past the [[equivalence point]]. Up through the half equivalence point, Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·Pb(OH)<sub>2</sub> predominates, then after this point Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·5Pb(OH)<sub>2</sub> is formed. No simple Pb(OH)<sub>2</sub> is formed up to at least [[pH]] 12.<ref name="kirkothmer">{{cite book | first = D.F. | last = Othmer | authorlink = Donald Othmer | title = Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology | edition = second completely revised edition | volume = 12 (Iron to Manganese) | year = 1967 | publisher = [[John Wiley]] & Sons | location = New York | pages = p.&nbsp;272}}</ref><ref name="pauley">{{cite journal | title = Basic Salts of Lead Nitrate Formed in Aqueous Media | first = J.

===Crystal structure===
[[Image:LeadNitrateCrystalStructure.png|300px|left|thumb|Crystal structure <nowiki>[111]</nowiki> plane]]
The [[crystal structure]] of solid lead(II) nitrate has been determined by [[neutron diffraction]].<ref>{{cite journal | first = W.C. | last = Hamilton | title = A neutron crystallographic study of lead nitrate | journal = [[Acta Crystallographica|Acta Cryst.]] | year = 1957 | volume = 10 | pages = 103&ndash;107 | doi = 10.1107/S0365110X57000304}}</ref><ref name="nowotny">{{cite journal | title = Structure refinement of lead nitrate | first = H. | last = Nowotny | coauthors = G.

Its [[space group]] is Pa3<sub>Z=4</sub> ([[Bravais lattice]] notation), with each side of the cube with length 784&nbsp;[[picometre]]s.

The black dots represent the lead atoms, the white dots the nitrate groups 27&nbsp;picometres above the plane of the lead atoms, and the blue dots the nitrate groups the same distance below this plane. In this configuration, every lead atom is [[chemical bond|bonded]] to twelve oxygen atoms ([[bond length]]: 281&nbsp;pm). All N–O bond lengths are identical, at 127&nbsp;picometres.

Research interest in the crystal structure of lead(II) nitrate was partly based on the possibility of free internal rotation of the nitrate groups within the crystal lattice at elevated temperatures, but this did not materialise.<ref name="nowotny"/>

===Complexation===
Lead(II) nitrate is associated with interesting [[supramolecular chemistry]] because of its [[complex (chemistry)|coordination]] to [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] electron-donating compounds. The interest is largely academic, but with several potential applications. For example, combining lead nitrate and [[diethylene glycol|pentaethylene glycol]] (EO<sub>5</sub>) in a solution of [[acetonitrile]] and [[methanol]] followed by slow [[evaporation]] produces a new crystalline material [Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(EO<sub>5</sub>)].<ref>{{cite journal | title = Structural Chemistry of Poly (ethylene glycol). Complexes of Lead(II) Nitrate and Lead(II) Bromide | first = Robin D. | last = Rogers | coauthors = Andrew H. Bond, and Debra M. Roden | journal = [[Inorganic Chemistry (journal)|Inorg. Chem.]] | year = 1996 | vol = 35 | issue = 24 | pages = 6964&ndash;6973 | doi = 10.1021/ic960587b | volume = 35}}</ref> In the crystal structure for this compound, the EO<sub>5</sub> chain is wrapped around the lead ion in an [[Celestial sphere|equatorial plane]] similar to that of a [[crown ether]]. The two bidentate nitrate [[ligand]]s are in [[Cis-trans isomerism|trans configuration]]. The total [[coordination number]] is 10, with the lead ion in a bicapped [[square antiprism]] [[molecular geometry]].

The complex formed by lead(II) nitrate, [[lead(II) perchlorate]] and a [[thiazole|bithiazole]] bidentate N-donor ligand is binuclear, with a nitrate group bridging the lead atoms with coordination number of 5 and 6.<ref name=mahjoub>{{cite journal | title = A Dimeric Mixed-Anions Lead(II) Complex: Synthesis and Structural Characterization of [Pb<sub>2</sub>(BTZ)<sub>4</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)](ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> {BTZ = 4,4'-Bithiazole} | first = Ali Reza | last = Mahjoub | coauthors = Ali Morsali | journal = [[Chemistry Letters]] | volume = 30 | issue = 12 | year = 2001| pages= 1234 | doi=10.1246/cl.2001.1234}}</ref> One interesting aspect of this type of complexes is the presence of a physical gap in the [[coordination sphere]]; i.e., the ligands are not placed symmetrically around the metal ion. This is potentially due to a lead [[lone pair]] of electrons, also found in lead complexes with an [[imidazole]] ligand.<ref name=wan>{{cite journal | title = 2D 4.8² Network with threefold parallel interpenetration from nanometre-sized tripodal ligand and lead(II) nitrate | first = Shuang-Yi | last = Wan | coauthors = Jian Fan, Taka-aki Okamura, Hui-Fang Zhu, Xing-Mei Ouyang, Wei-Yin Sun and Norikazu Ueyama | journal = [[Chemical Communications|Chem. Commun.]] | year = 2002 | pages = 2520&ndash;2521 | doi = 10.1039/b207568g}}</ref>

This type of chemistry is not unique to the nitrate salt; other lead(II) compounds such as [[lead(II) bromide]] also form complexes, but the nitrate is frequently used because of its solubility properties and its bidentate nature.

===Oxidation and decrepitation===
Lead(II) nitrate is an [[oxidizing agent|oxidising agent]].  Depending on the reaction, this may be due to the Pb<sup>2+</sup>(aq) ion, which has a standard [[reduction potential]] (E<sup>0</sup>) of &minus;0.125&nbsp;V, or the nitrate ion, which under acidic conditions has an E<sup>0</sup> of +0.956&nbsp;V.<ref name="HillPetrucci">{{cite book | title = General Chemistry | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | year = 1999 | page = p.&nbsp;781 | first = John W. | last = Hill | coauthors = Petrucci, Ralph H. | edition = 2nd edition | id = ISBN 0-13-010318-7}}</ref> 

When heated, lead(II) nitrate crystals decompose to [[lead(II) oxide]], [[Oxygen#Allotropes|dioxygen]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]], accompanied by a crackling noise. This effect is referred to as [[decrepitation]]. 
:2 Pb([[nitrate|NO<sub>3</sub>]])<sub>2</sub>(s)  →  2 [[Lead(II) oxide|PbO]](s)  +  4 [[Nitrogen dioxide|NO<sub>2</sub>]]([[Gas|g]])  +  [[Oxygen#Allotropes|O<sub>2</sub>]](g)
Because of this property, lead nitrate is sometimes used in [[pyrotechnics]] such as [[fireworks]].<ref name="pyrotechnica"/>

==Preparation and production==
Lead(II) nitrate does not occur naturally.  The compound can be obtained by dissolving [[metal]]lic [[lead]] in aqueous [[nitric acid]]:<ref name="greenwood"/><ref name="kirkothmer"/>
:3 Pb(s) + 8 H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + 2 NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>(aq) → 3 Pb<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2 NO(g) + 4H<sub>2</sub>O(l)
More commonly, lead(II) nitrate is obtained by dissolving [[lead(II) oxide]], which is readily available as a [[mineral]], in aqueous nitric acid:<ref name="greenwood"/>
:PbO(s) + 2 H<sup>+</sup>(aq) → Pb<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)
In either case, since the [[solvent]] is concentrated nitric acid (in which lead(II) nitrate has very low solubility) and the resulting solution contains [[nitrate]] ions, anhydrous crystals of lead(II) nitrate spontaneously form:<ref name="kirkothmer"/>
:Pb<sup>2+</sup> + 2 NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> → Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(s) 
Most commercially available lead(II) nitrate, as well as [[laboratory]]-scale material, is produced accordingly.<ref name="adlam"/> Supply is in 25&nbsp;kilogram bags up to 1000&nbsp;kilogram [[Flexible intermediate bulk container|big bags]], and in laboratory containers, both by general producers of laboratory chemicals and by producers of lead and [[Inorganic compounds by element#Lead (Plumbum)|lead compounds]]. No large-scale production has been reported.

In nitric acid treatment of lead-containing wastes, e.g., in the processing of lead–[[bismuth]] wastes from lead refineries, impure solutions of lead(II) nitrate are formed as [[by-product]]. These solutions are reported to be used in the [[gold cyanidation]] process.<ref name="sidech">{{cite web | title = Product catalog; other products | url = http://www.sidech.be/products.html | publisher = Sidech | location = Tilly, Belgium | accessdate = 2008-01-05}}</ref>

==Applications==
Due to the hazardous nature of lead(II) nitrate, there is a preference for using alternatives in industrial applications. In the formerly major application of [[lead paint]]s, it has largely been replaced by [[titanium dioxide]].<ref name="millennium">{{cite web | url = http://www.millenniumchem.com/Products+and+Services/Products+by+Type/Titanium+Dioxide+-+Paint+and+Coatings/r_TiO2+Fundamentals/Historical+Development+of+Titanium+Dioxide_EN.htm  | title = Historical development of titanium dioxide | publisher = Millennium Inorganic Chemicals | accessdate = 2008-01-04}}</ref> Other historical applications of lead(II) nitrate, such as in matches and fireworks, have declined or ceased as well. Current applications of lead(II) nitrate include use as a heat stabiliser in nylon and polyesters, as a coating for [[thermography|photothermographic]] paper, and in [[rodenticide]]s.<ref name="greenwood"/> 

On a laboratory scale, lead(II) nitrate provides one of two convenient and reliable sources of [[dinitrogen tetroxide]].  By carefully drying lead(II) nitrate and then heating it in a steel vessel, [[nitrogen dioxide]] is produced along with [[Oxygen#Allotropes|dioxygen]] following to the decripitation equation shown above.  Alternatively, nitrogen dioxide is formed when concentrated nitric acid is added to [[Copper|copper turnings]]; in this case, substantial nitrogen monoxide can also be produced.  In either case, the resulting nitrogen dioxide exists in equilibrium with its dimer: 
:2 NO<sub>2</sub> {{unicode|⇌}} [[Dinitrogen tetroxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]]
In order to remove either impurity, the gas mixture is condensed and fractionally distilled to give a mixture of NO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.<ref name="greenwood"/>  As the dimerisation is exothermic, low temperatures favour N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as the dominant species. 

To improve the [[leaching]] process in the [[gold cyanidation]], lead(II) nitrate solution is added. Although a bulk process, only limited amounts (10 to 100&nbsp;milligrams lead(II) nitrate per kilogram gold) is required.<ref name="habashi">{{cite book | first = Fathi | last = Habashi | title = Recent advances in gold metallurgy | publisher = Laval University | location = Quebec City, Canada | year = 1998 (est) | url = http://www.ucv.ve/cifi/16%5CArticuloh.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.e-goldprospecting.com/html/auxiliary_agents_in_gold_cyani.html | title = Auxiliary agents in gold cyanidation | publisher = Gold Prospecting and Gold Mining | accessdate = 2008-01-05}}</ref> Both the cyanidation itself, as well as the use of lead compounds in the process, are deemed controversial due to the compounds' toxic nature.
