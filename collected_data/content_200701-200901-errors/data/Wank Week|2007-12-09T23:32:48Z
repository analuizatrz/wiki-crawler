'''Wank Week''' was a controversial season of [[television]] programming that was due to be broadcast in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Channel 4]], expected to consist of a series of three documentary programmes about [[masturbation]]. However, plans to broadcast it in March 2007 came under public attack from senior television figures, and the planned broadcasts were pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel's [[public broadcasting|public service broadcasting]] credentials. While Wank Week itself has been cancelled, the films it was meant to showcase may yet be broadcast by the channel at a later date.<ref name=Deans2007-02-02>{{cite web|date=2007-02-02|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/feb/02/broadcasting.channel4|accessdate=2007-11-02| title='Wank week' postponed|author=Jason Deans|work= [[Media Guardian]]}}</ref>

==Commissioning and programming==

The season was commissioned by Andrew MacKenzie, the channel's factual entertainment commissioning editor, and announced in July 2006. It was to consist of three films broadcast in the 11pm slot, headlined by a documentary on mass public masturbation. This kind of programming was not unprecedented: the Channel had previously screened a 'Penis Week', described by MacKenzie as a "success" in an interview to ''[[The Guardian]]'''s Media Guardian site. He continued on the subject of Wank Week, "we feel this is exactly the type of provocative and mischievous programming that Channel 4 should be covering in the 11pm slot"<ref name = Holmwood2006-07-18>{{cite web|date=2006-07-18|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/jul/18/channel4.broadcasting|accessdate=2007-11-02| title=More tossers on TV|author = Leigh Holmwood|work=[[Media Guardian]]}}</ref> 
In the [[United Kingdom]], the 11pm slot is considered [[Watershed (television)|post-watershed]], defined by the regulator [[Ofcom]] in the Broadcasting Code as later than 9pm (although transition to more adult material "must not be unduly abrupt at the watershed or after the time when children are particularly likely to be listening" according to section 1.6). This allows the broadcasting of more sexually explicit content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/codes/bcode/protectingu18/|accessdate=2007-11-02| title=Broadcasting Code (Section One)|publisher=[[Ofcom]]}}</ref>

The first show to be announced centred on a [[Masturbate-a-thon]] held in [[Clerkenwell]], [[London]] in August 2006. This was a public mass masturbation event organised to raise money for the [[sexual health]] charity [[Marie Stopes International]]. A press release from Zig-Zag, the independent [[production company]] behind the recording of the event, promised that the film would reveal "if the only things allowed to be stiff in Britain are [[stiff upper lip|upper lips]]". The programme's [[working title]] was ''Wank-a-thon''.<ref name = Lewis2006-07-19>{{cite web|date=2006-07-19|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1823630,00.html|accessdate=2007-11-02| title=C4's pleasure principle to raise eyebrows|author = Paul Lewis|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

A week later, plans for an as yet unnamed second documentary about compulsive male masturbators were announced, to be produced by the independent company Spun Gold. The film was to be an hour long and focus on men trying to cut down [[masturbation addiction|excessive masturbatory habits]] of up to twenty times a day, using methods developed in the [[United States]].<ref name = Busfield 2006-07-24>{{cite web|date=2006-07-24|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/jul/24/broadcasting.channel4|accessdate=2007-11-02| title=Wank Week looks at the 20-a-day men|author = Steve Busfield|work= [[Media Guardian]]}}</ref> In September 2006, the final film in the series was announced. Entitled ''Masturbation For Girls'', it was also to be produced by Spun Gold, and focus on [[female masturbation]]. It was to feature the [[sex education]]alist Dr [[Betty Dodson]], although the format had yet not been finalised.<ref name = Holmwood2006-09-13>{{cite web|date=2006-09-13|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/sep/13/channel4.broadcasting|accessdate=2007-11-02| title=Wank Week to climax with girls' guide|author = Leigh Holmwood|work= [[Media Guardian]]}}</ref> It was reported after the postponement of their airing that the second and third films were to be entitled ''I Can't Stop Wanking'' and ''Masturbation for Women'' respectively.<ref name=Welsh2006-02-02>{{cite web|date=2006-02-02|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a42343/channel-4-abandons-wank-week.html|accessdate=2007-11-02| title= Channel 4 'abandons' "wank week"|author = James Welsh|work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref>

==Controversy and cancellation==

Wank Week was criticised in the prestigious [[James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture]] at the 2006 [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] on [[25 August]], only a month after Channel 4's initial announcement. [[Charles Allen (businessman)|Charles Allen]], the outgoing [[Chief Executive]] of Channel 4's commercial rival [[ITV]], attacked Channel 4 for deterioration of output and adopting a "begging" approach to finances in the run-up to terrestrial [[digital switchover]] (requesting subsidies for public service output while pursuing a path of commercialism).<ref>{{cite web|date=2006-08-25|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5287336.stm| title=ITV's chief tears into Channel 4|author =Kevin Young|work=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=[[2006-08-25]] |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/aug/25/edinburghtvfestival2006.broadcasting|accessdate=2007-11-02| title=MacTaggart lecture: Allen goes out fighting |author = Owen Gibson|work= [[Media Guardian]]}}</ref> Wank Week's mention came as part of a critique of programming that Channel 4 was counting towards its "educational" content. Allen joked that he was expecting Wank Week to be included, "but that could be a hard one to pull off even for Channel 4."<ref>{{cite web |date=[[2006-08-27]] |url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a36361/in-full-allens-mactaggart-speech.html| title=In Full: Allen's MacTaggart speech |author =Charles Allen |work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref> The pun was subsequently repeated in the press.<ref>{{cite news |date=[[2006-08-28]] |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/aug/28/mondaymediasection.broadcasting|accessdate=2007-11-02| title=The caterer's revenge |author=Owen Gibson and Maggie Brown|work= [[Media Guardian]]}}</ref>

Criticisms of Wank Week were echoed later in 2006 by Sir [[Jeremy Isaacs]], the first Chief Executive of Channel 4, in an article for ''[[Prospect magazine|Prospect]]'' magazine. Isaacs argued that Channel 4's increased commercialisation led to a targeting of the 16-34 year old audience, and the subsequent "obsession with adolescent transgression and sex" could be seen in programming such as ''[[Designer Vaginas]]'', ''[[The World's Biggest Penis]]'' and Wank Week.<ref name = Herbert2006-11-14>{{cite news |date=[[2006-11-14]] |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1981701.ece|accessdate=2007-11-02| title=Isaacs condemns Channel 4 for being obsessed with sex|author = Ian Herbert |work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref>

Although these public attacks led to reports of concern in Channel 4 management, postponement of Wank Week did not take place until early February 2007, only a month before its planned screening. There had been a major racism controversy during January's ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 2007 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' contest, and the launch of Wank Week raised the prospect of further embarrassment at a critical time: [[Ofcom]] was reviewing the channel's finances ahead of the digital switchover, with the continued nature of Channel 4's existence as a [[Public ownership|state-owned]] but [[Television advertisement|advertisement-funded]] public service broadcaster at stake.<ref name=Deans2007-02-02 />

According to the media section of ''[[The Guardian]]'', the films commissioned for Wank Week are likely to be broadcast at a later date, but probably not as part of a dedicated season of programming, and certainly not under the Wank Week banner.<ref name=Deans2007-02-02 />
