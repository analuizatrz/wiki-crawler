'''Alvin John Paddock''' (born [[June 9]], [[1954]] in [[Oak River]], [[Manitoba]]) is a former [[Canadian]] [[ice hockey]] player.

==Playing Career==
Selected in the [[1974 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Washington Capitals]], Paddock only played 8 games with the Capitals before he was traded to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. He played a memorable role in the [[1980]] [[Stanley Cup Finals]], scoring the tying goal to send game 6 of the Finals into overtime.  Unfortunately for the Flyers, [[Bob Nystrom]] scored at 7:11 of [[overtime]] to win the [[Stanley Cup]].

Throughout his career he had a difficult time trying to crack the lineup on an NHL team.  Playing primarily in the minors, in particular the [[Maine Mariners]], Paddock retired as a player in 1983-84 and moved to the coaching side.

==Coaching Career==
After coaching in the minors for several years he was named head coach of the [[Winnipeg Jets]] in [[1991]], becoming the first Manitoba-born coach of the franchise.  During his coaching stint he would also become General Manager of the team, and would relinquish his coaching duties in early 1994.  He would remain the General Manager, even after the Jets relocated to Phoenix, until December 1996.

After two years as a scout with the [[New York Rangers]], Paddock would return to head coaching in 1999, primarily in the [[American Hockey League|AHL]].
