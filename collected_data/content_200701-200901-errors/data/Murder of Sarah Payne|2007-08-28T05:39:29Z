The '''Murder of Sarah Payne''' was a high profile murder case in the [[United Kingdom]]. The victim was '''Sarah Payne''' (born [[13 October]], [[1992]]), and last seen alive on [[1 July]], [[2000]]) who was murdered by car mechanic '''Roy William Whiting''' (b. [[26 January]] [[1959]]). Following his conviction, Whiting was imprisoned and is currently being held in the maximum security [[Wakefield Prison]], [[West Yorkshire]].

==Pre-convictions==
Born in [[Horsham]], [[West Sussex]], Whiting left school in 1975 with no academic qualifications and over the next few years found himself employed in several different jobs, including doing deliveries for the local Co-operative store and working as a car mechanic and paintsprayer at a local garage. In 1986 he married a 19-year-old woman who became pregnant the same year; however, they separated just before the birth of their son and were [[divorce]]d in 1989.

==1995 conviction and imprisonment==
On [[4 March]] [[1995]], Whiting abducted and sexually assaulted an eight-year-old girl on the Langley Green estate in [[Crawley]]. He was arrested a few weeks later after a man who knew Whiting came forward after hearing that the abductor's car had been a red [[Ford Sierra]]. Three months later he admitted to the charges of abduction and indecent assault and was sentenced to four years in prison. The maximum sentence would have been a [[life sentence]] for the crime, however his sentence was reduced because he had admitted the crime. A [[psychiatrist]] who assessed Whiting after his conviction said that he was likely to re-offend once he was released.

Whiting was released from prison in November 1997, having serving 2 years and 5 months of his 4-year sentence, and was one of the first people in Britain to go on the sex offenders' register. Whiting, knowing that he would not be welcome back in Crawley, moved some 25 miles (40 km) away to [[Littlehampton]] on the West Sussex coast, where he rented a flat in St Augustine's Road. Two years later he moved into another flat in the same road. On [[2 July]] [[2000]] officers from Sussex Police visited his flat making inquiries into the disappearance of [[Sarah Payne]].

==Disappearance and murder==
Sarah Payne disappeared on [[1 July]], [[2000]] from a cornfield near the home of her grandparents in Kingston Gorse, [[West Sussex]], [[England]], where she had been playing with her brothers and sister. A nationwide search was under way within 48 hours and Sarah's parents made numerous television appeals for her safe return.

On [[17 July]], a farm labourer found a girl's body in a field near [[Pulborough]], some 15 miles (24 km) from the village of [[Kingston Gorse]] (near [[Littlehampton]]) where Payne had disappeared. The following day, [[forensic]] science tests were able to confirm that the body was Sarah's and [[Sussex Police]] began a murder investigation.

==Sarah Payne murder investigation==
Whiting was questioned about the disappearance of '''Sarah Payne''', who went missing on [[1 July]] [[2000]] while visiting her grandparents in [[Kingston Gorse]] in [[Sussex]], around five miles from Whiting's flat. Whiting was routinely questioned as he had been placed on the [[Sex Offenders Register]]. The officers left Whiting's flat but were suspicious of his lack of concern for Sarah - something that some of the worst offenders had shown when questioned in connection with Sarah's disappearance. When Whiting re-appeared soon after and attempted to drive away in his van, he was stopped by the police and arrested. He spent two days in custody but the police had no concrete evidence, although they had found a receipt for fuel at Buck Barn garage near [[Pulborough]] which contradicted his alibi of being at a [[funfair]] in [[Hove]] at 5.30 p.m. and then returned to his flat by 9.30 p.m. on the night Sarah disappeared [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1670366.stm]. 

When Whiting was released on bail, he went to live with his father in [[Crawley]] while his flat in St Augustine's Road was being searched by [[forensic]] scientists. No evidence was found in Whiting's flat to suggest that Sarah had been there.

On [[2 July]] [[2000]], Whiting was arrested on suspicion of [[abduction]]. He was released on [[police bail]]. On [[17 July]] [[2000]] Sarah Payne's body was discovered and Roy Whiting was subsequently re-arrested on [[31 July]] [[2000]].  Despite Sarah's body being discovered just 3 miles (5 km) from the service station where Whiting had bought fuel on the night Sarah disappeared and Whiting's failure to confirm his [[alibi]] there was still not enough evidence to press charges and Whiting was released on bail once again.

A few days after his second arrest, Whiting moved out of his father's house after a vigilante mob smashed the windows with bricks, and went to live in a tent in woodland behind a housing estate in Crawley. He then took to the road in a stolen [[Vauxhall Nova]] car and was pursued by police at speeds of up to 70 mph (112  km/h) before he crashed into a parked vehicle and was arrested on dangerous driving charges. On [[27 September]] [[2000]], Whiting admitted taking the car and driving dangerously. He was sentenced to 22 months' imprisonment.

When Whiting began his jail term for the car theft, detectives were able to carry out forensic tests on his F-registered white [[Fiat Ducato]] van. On [[6 February]] [[2001]] following a police enquiry Roy Whiting was formally charged with the [[murder]] of Sarah Payne [[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/ p.m./1156763.stm]].

==The trial==
On [[6 February]] [[2001]], Sussex Police had found enough evidence to charge Whiting and he appeared at [[Lewes Crown Court]] on charges of abduction and murder. He denied the charges and was remanded in custody to await trial. 

The trial began on [[14 November]] [[2001]] at Lewes Crown Court and the jury heard from several witnesses. The key witnesses included Sarah Payne's oldest brother Lee, who had seen a scruffy-looking man with yellowish teeth drive past the field where he and his siblings had been playing at the time Sarah vanished. A female motorist had found one of Sarah's shoes in a country lane several miles from where her body was found, and forensic scientists had found fibres from Whiting's van on the shoe. The damning piece of evidence was a strand of blonde hair on a T-shirt found in Whiting's van - the forensic experts who made this discovery said that DNA test results meant that there was a one-in-a-billion chance of it belonging to anyone other than Sarah. 

This case is particularly notable for the extensive use of [[forensic]] sciences in establishing the prosecution case against Roy Whiting. 20 forensic experts were employed during the inquiry from a variety of fields including [[entomology]], [[pathology]], [[geology]], [[archaeology]], environmental profiling and oil/lubricant analysis. It has been estimated that the cost of the investigation involved a thousand personnel and cost more than Â£2 million.[[http://www.forensic.gov.uk/forensic_t/inside/news/list_casefiles.php?case=7]] 

On [[12 December]] [[2001]], Roy Whiting was convicted of the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial judge, Mr Justice Curtis, said that it was a rare case in which a life sentence should mean life. This was only the 24th time in British legal history that such a recommendation had been made. Whiting was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] and the trial [[judge]] recommended that he should never be released. 

Sussex Police later admitted that they had been convinced Whiting would re-offend after the 1995 offence (their belief was backed up by a psychiatrist's report at the time) but, short of keeping Whiting under 24-hour watch, they were powerless to stop him. This and many other cases of killings committed by serial [[sex offender]]s has led to continued calls from the public for serious sex offenders to be locked away indefinitely until they are no longer judged to be a risk, and for the worst offenders to be locked away and never released unless they lived to a great age or had changed physically and were incapable of attacking children.

After Whiting was convicted of killing Sarah Payne, it was revealed that he was already a convicted child sex offender; this proved correct the Payne family's belief that Sarah had been killed by a child sex offender. There were renewed calls for the government to allow controlled public access to the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register|sex offender's register]]. This became the campaign for what is known as [[Sarah's Law]], after [[Megan's Law]] in America.

==Attack in prison==
On [[4 August]] [[2002]] Whiting was attacked with a razor by another prisoner while fetching hot water at [[Wakefield Prison]]. Convicted killer Rickie Tregaskis was found guilty of carrying out the slashing which left Whiting with a six-inch scar on his right cheek.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/3840449.stm]
Tregaskis, serving life for the murder of a disabled man in [[Cornwall]], received a six-year sentence (to run concurrently alongside his life sentence) for the attack at his trial in [[June]] [[2004]]. This will not mean that he will have to serve any extra time in prison when (and if) the [[Parole Board]] decides that he can be freed on life licence.

==David Blunkett's ruling==
On [[24 November]] [[2002]], [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]] made a landmark ruling. He ordered that Roy Whiting must serve a minimum of 50 years in prison. This would make him ineligible for parole until 2051, when, if he survived that long, he would be 92. 

Within 48 hours of the ruling being made, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] and [[European Court of Human Rights]] had ruled in favour of another convicted of murder who was challenging the right of politicians to decide how long a murderer must spend in prison before being considered for parole. 

In June 2004, it was confirmed that Whiting was going to apply to the [[Court of Appeal]] for a new minimum term to be set, although his appeal has yet to be heard.

In September 2005, a 40-year minimum term on double child killer [[Ian Huntley]] - who killed two girls in similar circumstances - sparked fear that Whiting could use the High Court's ruling on Huntley as grounds for an appeal because he had killed once whereas Huntley had killed twice in similar circumstances and received a lesser sentence. The Lord Chief Justice had also recommended that Whiting should serve 28 years behind bars before being considered for parole, which could see him out of prison by [[2029]] and the age of 70.

==Sarah's Law==
{{Split|Sarah's Law}}

{{Unreferencedsect|date=April 2007}}

Sarah's Law was a campaign spearheaded by the ''[[News of the World]]'' [[newspaper]] which began in July [[2000]] in response to the murder of Sarah Payne. Sarah's parents backed up the campaign as they were sure that a [[child sexual abuse|child sex offender]] had been responsible for their daughter's death. The News of the World also claimed that everyone living in British residential areas had a paedophile living within a mile of them.

The aim of the campaign was for the government to allow controlled access to the [[Sex Offenders Register]] so parents with young children could know if a child sex offender was living in their area. Sarah's mother has always insisted that such a law would have saved Sarah's life. 

In December 2002, Stuart Campbell was convicted of murdering his niece [[Murder of Danielle Jones|Danielle Jones]] - whose body was never found - and it was revealed that he had served a prison sentence for holding a young girl against her will and had been placed on the Sex Offenders Register.

Payne's mother said that Sarah's Law would have saved Danielle, but the government has refused to allow any public access to the Sex Offenders Register. 

===International parallels===
Sarah's Law is similar to [[Megan's Law]] which operates in the [[United States|USA]] in honour of murder victim [[Megan Kanka]], who was [[rape]]d and [[murder]]ed by her neighbour [[Jesse Timmendequas]] in [[1994]]. After the killer's trial, it was revealed that he was a convicted child rapist. Megan's Law even shows photographs and addresses of sex offenders. Sarah's Law would just inform parents if there was a paedophile living in their area.

===Debate over effectiveness===
There has been considerable debate over the effectiveness of [[Megan's Law]] and therefore, by implication, Sarah's Law. Issues raised have included:

* The risk of "vigilante" actions. This has been demonstrated in the U.S. where those on the sex offenders register have been the victims of violence. There have also been cases of mistaken identity, where people have been attacked despite not being sex offenders.

* The increased stereotyping of those on the sex offenders register. This may lead to a reduction in the ability of offenders to find work and accommodation, thus leading to their being ostracised and therefore being more likely to reoffend.

* The lack of "finesse" of American definitions of "[[sex offender]]". In the USA, this has led those being convicted of urinating in a public place (which is classified as "indecent exposure") as sex offenders, and thus being placed on a register with those convicted of more serious offences.

* The increased risk of sex offenders avoiding registration with offender management services. In the USA, this figure stands at around 80%, compared with 97% in the UK. it has been suggested that the risk of harm mentioned above deters offenders from registering.

* The nature of offending is seriously mis-represented by "Sarah's Law". Research [http://www.bfms.org.uk/Text_Assets/HO_Findings_164.pdf] suggests that reoffending rates over a six year period run at around 8.5%. Thus, it may be suggested that reoffending is not the problem that is suggested by some commentators.

* Relationships of offenders to victims. In terms of rape, 83% of attackers are known to their victims [http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf] and 54% are partners or former partners. These statistics suggest that "stranger danger" has been exaggerated.

*Political correctness: A full and complete list of adults who pose a serious threat to children would also include drunk drivers and parents who don't force children to put a seat belt on (and many other groups) but it would not be [[politically correct]] to imply that 'ordinary' people could pose an equal or greater risk to children than sex offenders.

It may be suggested that the introduction of Sarah's Law is highly unlikely as it could breach the [[Data Protection Act]] and the [[Human Rights Act]] on the right to a private life. Indeed, it has been suggested that the "campaign" for Sarah's Law is little more than a publicity exercise for the [[tabloid]] press.

==Aftermath==
Payne's mother Sara has subsequently written a book - [[Sara Payne: A Mother's Story]] - about the experience. 

In July 2001, it was reported that Payne's parents received Â£11,000 compensation from the [[Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority]]{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. Payne's parents said that they were appalled by the offer and described it as a "sick joke"{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. The Victims of Crime Trust condemned the payout as "derisory"{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.
