The '''Rookery Building''' (209 S. LaSalle St.) is an historic [[landmark]] of [[Chicago, Illinois]].  Completed by [[John Wellborn Root]] and [[Daniel Burnham]] in [[1888]], it is considered one of their masterpiece buildings, once housing the office of the famous [[architects]]. It is eleven stories tall and has a unique style of exterior load-bearing walls and an interior steel frame.  The lobby was remodeled in 1907 by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].  The lobby was again restored to the original Wright design starting in 1989. 


The Rookery Building was featured in the movie [[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]], where one of the lower levels was modeled as a toy store, [[Duncan's Toy Chest]]. ([http://www.movietourguide.com/Home_Alone_2:_Lost_in_New_York/filming_locations Citation])
