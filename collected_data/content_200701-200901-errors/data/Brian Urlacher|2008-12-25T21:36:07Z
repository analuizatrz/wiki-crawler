'''Brian Keith Urlacher''' ({{pronEng|'ɝlækɚ}}) (born May 25, 1978 in [[Pasco, Washington]]) is an [[American football]] player for the [[Chicago Bears]] of the [[National Football League]]. Urlacher, an alumnus of the [[University of New Mexico]], is a six-time<ref name="pfrstat">{{cite web |url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/UrlaBr00.htm|title= Brian Urlacher statistics|publisher= ''Pro-football-reference.com''| accessdate = 2008-11-08}}</ref> [[Pro Bowl]] player and has established himself as one of the NFL's most productive [[linebackers]].He is regarded as one of the best defensive players in the NFL, winning the [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award|NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award]] in 2000 and the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award]] in 2005, becoming only the fifth player in NFL history to win both awards.<ref name="chicagobearsurlacher">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Roster - Brian Urlacher | date=2008 | publisher=''chicagobears.com'' | url =http://www.chicagobears.com/team/player79.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-02 | language = }}</ref>
==Early life==
Brian Urlacher was born to Brad and Lavoyda Urlacher in [[Pasco, Washington]]. The family broke apart in the late 1980s, and Lavoyda gained [[custody]] of Urlacher and his siblings.<ref name="JockBio_Brian_Urlacher">{{cite web |url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Urlacher/Urlacher_bio.html|title=JockBio: Brian Urlacher|publisher=''Jockbio.com''}}</ref> Lavoyda then moved the family to [[Lovington, New Mexico]], where she was eager to give the family a new start. While his mother worked several jobs to keep the family afloat, Urlacher spent his free time exercising. Over time, Urlacher developed a sincere interest in [[American football|football]]. Urlacher combined his brute force, agility, and speed to lead the Lovington High School Wild Cats to a 14-0 season.<ref name="chicagobearsurlacher">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/team/player.asp?player_id=79|title=Chicago Bears Roster — Brian Urlacher|publisher= ''Chicagobears.com''}}</ref>

==College career==
Although Urlacher was partial to attending [[Texas Tech University]], his dreams were cut short after the university did not offer him a much needed [[athletic scholarship|scholarship]]. The only two [[Division I]] schools that expressed genuine interest in him were the [[University of New Mexico]] and [[New Mexico State University|New Mexico State]]. He ultimately chose to attend the University of New Mexico.<ref name="JockBio_Brian_Urlacher">{{cite web |url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Urlacher/Urlacher_bio.html|title=JockBio: Brian Urlacher|publisher= ''jockbio.com''}}</ref> Urlacher did not get a lot of playing time as a freshman in 1996, as head coach [[Dennis Franchione]]'s rebuilding plan for the team relied heavily on upperclassmen.<ref name="JockBio_Brian_Urlacher">{{cite web |url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Urlacher/Urlacher_bio.html|title=JockBio: Brian Urlacher|publisher= ''jockbio.com''}}</ref> 
He played more as a sophomore when the University of New Mexico finished with a 9-4 and captured the [[Western Athletic Conference]] Mountain division title, but eventually lost 41-13 to [[Colorado State University]] in the WAC Championship Game. Despite the loss, the Lobos were invited to the [[Insight.com Bowl]], where they lost to the [[University of Arizona]] 20-14.<ref>{{cite news | first=James | last=Baron | coauthors= | title=Lobo fans crowd bowl game | date=2003-01-21 | publisher= | url =http://media.www.dailylobo.com/media/storage/paper344/news/2003/01/21/Sports/Lobo-Fans.Crowd.Bowl.Game-348067.shtml?norewrite200612071906&sourcedomain=www.dailylobo.com | work =Daily Lobo | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref>

Following the 1997 season, Franchione left the university to coach for [[Texas Christian University]]. [[Rocky Long]], an alumnus of the university and former [[defensive coordinator]] for [[UCLA]], helped Urlacher achieve national recognition. Under the tutelage of Long and defensive coordinator Bronco Mendenhall, Urlacher became a “Lobo-Back,” a cross between a [[linebacker]] and [[defensive back|safety]], and garnered much success in Long's [[American football strategy|3-3-5 defense scheme]].<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title= Rocky Long | date=2008 | publisher=cstv.com | url =http://golobos.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/long_rocky00.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Carolyn | last=Gonzales | coauthors= | title=The Big Hitter | date=2004-08-26 | publisher=University of New Mexico | url =http://www.unmalumni.com/mirage/fall2004/bighitter_print.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref> He recorded 422 tackles, the third most in the school’s history, three interceptions, eleven forced fumbles and sacks. He was also the team’s return specialist and clutch [[wide receiver]], catching seven passes for six touchdowns.<ref name="chicagobearsurlacher">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/team/player.asp?player_id=79|title=Chicago Bears Roster — Brian Urlacher}}</ref> Urlacher also earned several honors during his collegiate career, named an [[All-American]] by Sports Network, [[Walter Camp]], [[Football Writers Association of America]], and the [[Associated Press]]. Entering the [[2000 NFL Draft]], Urlacher was considered one of the nation's most talented college prospects.<ref>{{cite news | first=Joel | last=Buchsbaum | coauthors= | title=Joel Buchsbaum previews the top prospects for the 2000 NFL draft | date=1999-12-29 | publisher= | url =http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives/draft_1999/prospects_lb_122799.asp | work =Pro Football Weekely | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref>

==Professional career==
===2001–2004===
During the [[2000 NFL Draft]], Urlacher was selected by the [[Chicago Bears]] with the ninth pick in the first round. Early in the season, Urlacher briefly lost his starting position to [[Rosevelt Colvin]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Vito | last=Stellino | coauthors= | title=Meet Urlacher's trusty sidekick - Rising Star: Rosevelt Colvin | date=2002-02 | publisher=''[[Football Digest]]'' | url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCL/is_6_31/ai_81789945 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref> However, an [[injury]] to [[Barry Minter]] forced Urlacher to fill in as the team’s starting middle linebacker. After a productive performance against the [[New York Giants]], he became an instant hit, recording over 15 tackles in each of his next two games. Not even a minor injury could prevent Urlacher from claiming the 2000 [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award]], along with an invite to his first [[Pro Bowl]]. Over the next two years, Urlacher distinguished himself as one of the league's most productive linebackers by recording 313 tackles, fourteen sacks and five interceptions.<ref>{{cite news | first=Roger | last=Mills | coauthors= | title= High profile -- Brian Urlacher | date=2002-12-2002 | publisher= | url =http://www.sptimes.com/2002/12/29/Bucs/High_profile____Brian.shtml | work =St. Petersburg Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref>

Under the leadership of new coach [[Dick Jauron]], the Bears surprised many with their performance during the [[2001 NFL season]]. Urlacher helped lead the Bears to three come from behind victories, and two shut-outs. During week fifteen of the 2001 season, a fake field goal allowed Bears' punter [[Brad Maynard]] to throw a game winning touchdown pass to Urlacher, giving the Bears the [[National Football Conference]]'s number two playoff seed.<ref>{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Maske | coauthors= | title=Redskins Fall From Race | date=2001-12-24 | publisher= | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A18019-2001Dec23 | work =Washington Post | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref> Despite their extremely productive defense, the Bears lost the divisional playoffs to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Unfortunately, the Bears’ 2001 winning season would soon be overshadowed by three years of mediocrity.  Prior to the [[2004 NFL season]], the Bears’ organization fired coach [[Dick Jauron]], and then hired [[Lovie Smith]]. After starting the season on the lower rungs of the [[NFC North]], Urlacher suffered several injuries, which sidelined him for a majority of the season.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Urlacher injured again | date=2004-12-23 | publisher=[[Reuters]] | url =http://tvnz.co.nz/view/sport_story_skin/465927?format=html | work =TVNZ | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref>

===2005–present===

[[Image:302343997 76a1a28f71.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Urlacher addresses the media in a post-game interview]]
Despite starting the [[2005 NFL season]] on a disastrous note, the Bears rebounded by winning eight straight games, and eventually clinched a playoff berth against the [[Green Bay Packers]] on [[Christmas Day]]. Urlacher played a crucial role in the Bears' playoff berth; he recorded at least ten tackles in six consecutive games, while leading the team with 121 tackles. Additionally, his leadership and seasoned judgment allowed the Bears' defense to allow the fewest points in the league.<ref>{{cite news | first=John | last=Dewan | coauthors= | title=The best defense of all time? | date=2005-12-21 | publisher=ACTA Sports | url =http://www.actasports.com/sow.php?id=72 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref> By the time the season ended, Urlacher and the Bears had boasted the best defense in the entire [[NFL]]. Before the regular season’s end, Urlacher was awarded with the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award]], and an invitation to the Pro Bowl. Urlacher, who ranked among the league's top defensive tiers, received more votes than any other defensive player in the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.about.com/od/sportsrecreation/a/122505_Bears.htm

The following week, the [[Carolina Panthers]] defeated the Bears with a score of 29-21 in the divisional playoffs. 

The Bears started the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|2006 season]] by winning nine out of eleven games. Urlacher had a prodigious performance against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] during a week six [[Monday Night Football]] game. After trailing the Cardinals by twenty points, Urlacher helped the Bears engineer a late comeback, by stripping the ball from [[Edgerrin James]], which led to a pivotal Bears’ recovery and touchdown. The Bears went on to win, 24-23, while Urlacher recorded eighteen total tackles (ten solo).<ref>{{cite news | first=Larry | last=Mayer | coauthors= | title=Lightning strikes twice for Urlacher | date=2006-10-22 | publisher=''chicagobears.com'' | url =http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2561 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref>
Later, he went on to overcome a serious sprained toe injury to lead the Bears to a 38-20 victory over the [[New York Giants]], and made an interception in the end-zone the following week to solidify a [[shutout]] against the [[New York Jets]].<ref>[http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2695 Bears catch up to Jets' no-huddle offense] by ''Larry Mayer'' of Chicagobears.com, posted 19 November, 2006.</ref> Urlacher and the Bears concluded the season with a 13-3 record, and the [[National Football Conference|NFC]]’s top playoff seed. Urlacher was selected as the NFC’s starting middle linebacker in the [[2007 Pro Bowl]], and was named onto the [[Associated Press]]’s "2006 All-Pro Team".<ref>{{cite news | first=Larry | last=Mayer | coauthors= | title=Bears send three special teams players to Pro Bowl | date=2006-12-19 | publisher=''chicagobears.com'' | url =http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2825 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AqMbR3et8MEKS6ALAZcsdTlDubYF?slug=ap-nflall-proteam&prov=ap&type=lgns|title= Tomlinson, Taylor and Bailey unanimous All-Pros}}</ref> He also finished fourth in the 2006 NFL Defensive Player Award.<ref>{{cite news | first=Alex | last=Marvez | coauthors= | title=Dolphins' Taylor in the running for Defensive Player of the Year | date=2006-12-16 | publisher= | url =http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28948159_ITM | work =South Florida Sun-Sentinel | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref>

Urlacher finished the season with three interceptions and 141 total tackles, which led the [[National Football Conference]] and earned Urlacher a selection to his fifth [[Pro Bowl]]. He played a pivotal defensive role in the Bears’ post-season victories over the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and [[New Orleans Saints]]. Ultimately, the Bears won the [[NFC Championship]], but lost to the [[Indianapolis Colts]], 29-17, at [[Super Bowl XLI]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Barry | last=Wilner | coauthors= | title=Colts 29, Bears 17 | date=2007-02-05 | publisher=[[Yahoo!

=== Reputation ===

Following his successful rookie season, Urlacher was able to gain popularity with the fans. Undoubtedly, he is still one of the most popular current Chicago Bears players. Bears fans consider Urlacher to be one of the "[[Monsters of the Midway]]", a "[[Valhalla]]" of Bears’ icons including [[Dick Butkus]], [[Bill George]], and [[Mike Singletary|“Samurai” Mike Singletary]]. On a national level, Urlacher’s jersey sales have rivaled those of other NFL icons, such as [[Michael Vick]] and [[Brett Favre]].<ref>{{cite news | first=James | last=Adler | coauthors= | title=Top 10 NFL Player Jerseys | date=2002 | publisher=[[About.com]] | url =http://football.about.com/cs/footballapparel/tp/2002playjersey.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref> Football fans across the nation have also voted Urlacher into six [[Pro Bowls]].<ref name="pfrstat">{{cite web |url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/UrlaBr00.htm|title= Brian Urlacher statistics}}</ref> Urlacher's teammates and coaches have also praised his character and athletic ability. In 2007, former teammate [[Tank Johnson]] called upon Urlacher to testify during one of his court hearings.<ref>CBS Chicago, [http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/local_story_074094000.html Tank Johnson Sentenced To 120 Days In Jail] Retrieved on March 15, 2007</ref> 

Some skeptics and critics, however, consider Urlacher overrated. Even after winning the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award]] for the [[2005 NFL season|2005]] season, a 2006  ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' poll of 361 NFL players named Urlacher to be the second most overrated player in the league, behind [[Terrell Owens]].<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Overrated: Terrell Owens, Brian Urlacher ... and Tom Brady? | date=2006-10-31 | publisher=[[AOL|AOL Sports]] | url =http://nfl.fanhouse.com/2006/10/31/overrated-terrell-owens-brian-urlacher-and-tom-brady/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref> Urlacher was unfazed by the poll’s results. During an interview, he said, "Just watch the film. I don’t know what people are saying, but I’m not too worried about it anymore. All I can do is go out there and play hard and try and help my team win, and that’s what I’m going to keep doing."<ref>{{cite news | first=Larry | last=Mayer | coauthors= | title=Adversity not slowing Urlacher's meteoric rise | date=2006-10-31 | publisher=''chicagobears.com'' | url =http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2603 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref>

Urlacher has two daughters, Pamela and Riley, with ex-wife Laurie Urlacher and a son, Kennedy, with Tyna Robertson.  Urlacher currently lives with his daughters and has visitation rights with his son.<ref name="Cust"/> His younger brother, [[Casey Urlacher|Casey]], lived with him before beginning a career in the [[Arena Football League]].

In 2002, he appeared on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', and won over $47,000 for charity. Urlacher, along with other Chicago Bears players, have sold autographed sports memorabilia to help fund the [[Special Olympics]]. Furthermore, Urlacher has been involved with charity work since his days at the University of New Mexico, where he volunteered numerous hours for the [[Special Olympics]] and [[Ronald McDonald House]].

In June 2005, Urlacher [[Paternity (law)|filed suit]] to establish paternity of another child, Kennedy. [[Genetic testing]] was completed and proved that he is Kennedy's father. Kennedy's mother, Tyna Robertson was already well-known to the [[Mass media|media]], having made unsuccessful claims of [[sexual assault]] against famed dancer [[Michael Flatley]] and a doctor from [[Naperville, Illinois]].<ref name="Cust"/>  In October 2006, Robertson refused to drive Kennedy to Urlacher’s house in [[Lake Bluff, Illinois]] and he took her to court to resolve the dispute. Ultimately, the judge decided it would be best for both Kennedy and his parents if they met at a halfway point between their residences for exchanges.<ref name="Cust">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Decision in Urlacher's child custody battle | date=2006-10-18 | publisher=[[WLS-TV|ABC7]] | url =http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&id=4674077 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref> However, custody issues remain ongoing; in November 2008, Robertson filed a court motion accusing Urlacher of confusing Kennedy's gender identity by painting his toenails and putting him in girls' pink pull-up diapers.  <ref name=si.com>{{cite news | first=Bonvissuto| last= Dominic| coauthors= | title=Bears' Urlacher accused of painting son's toenails | date=2008-11-26| publisher=[[si.com]] | url =http://www.fannation.com/si_blogs/nfl_tracker/posts/27181-bears-urlacher-accused-of-painting-sons-toenails| accessdate = 2008-11-26 | language = }}</ref>.

Urlacher is also a prosperous businessman. He is the owner of an [http://www.travelingusa.com/business/brianurlachercrosscountryautotucumcari/index.html?from_cat=Rentals%20and%20Dealerships auto dealership] in [[New Mexico]], and has appeared in several commercials for [[McDonald's]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Comcast]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Campbell's]] [[Chunky soup]], [[Old Spice]], and [[Glacéau]]. Nike also aired special commercials about Urlacher's [[high school]] career containing clips and commentary of plays he made. However, Urlacher later stated that he feels "uncomfortable" appearing in commercials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Urlacher/Urlacher_mysay.html|publisher=JockBio.com |title=Brian Urlacher "My Say"}}</ref> He was also the cover athlete and spokesperson for [[Sega|Sega Sports']] ''[[ESPN NFL 2K|NFL 2K3]]''. During media day before [[Super Bowl XLI]]  Urlacher wore a hat promoting [[Glacéau|Glacéau vitamin water]], a non-NFL approved sponsor, for which he was fined [[United States dollar|$]]100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=3307 |title=Urlacher fined $100,000 by NFL for wearing hat |accessdate=2007-04-19 |publisher=ChicagoBears.com}}</ref>

Outside football, Urlacher is a die-hard [[Chicago Cubs]] fan, and was once invited to sing ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]'' during the [[Seventh-inning stretch]], as part of the organization's tradition. He also enjoys watching [[professional wrestling]], and wrestled in a pay-per-view event. The Bears organization discovered this and forced him to stop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Urlacher/Urlacher_numbers.html|publisher=JockBio |title=Brian Urlacher Facts}}</ref> He also enjoys [[golf]]ing in his spare time, and during an episode of ''[[AT&T]]’s Home Turf,'' Urlacher revealed a room in his mansion containing a plethora of golf paraphernalia. When home, Urlacher revealed that he also enjoys watching the [[Discovery Channel]], [[National Geographic]], and [[HBO]]’s ''[[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]''. Urlacher enjoys listening to a wide variety of music, including [[hip-hop]], [[rap]], [[rock (music)|rock]], and [[country music]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Nastia | last=Liukin | coauthors= | title=AT&T's Home Turf | date=2006 | publisher=[[AT&T]] | url =http://attblueroom.com/sports/teamusa/mediaplayer.php?cid=182484 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | language = }}</ref>
