'''Egypt''' ({{Audio-IPA|lang=US English|En-us-Egypt.ogg|[ˈiːdʒɪpt]}}; {{lang-ar|مصر}}, ''{{transl|ar|Miṣr}}'' or ''{{transl|ar-EGP|Máṣr}}'') is a country in [[North Africa]], with the [[Sinai Peninsula]] forming a land bridge to [[Western Asia]]. Covering an area of about {{convert|1010000|km2|sp=us}}, Egypt borders the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the north, the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[Israel]] to the northeast, the [[Red Sea]] to the east, [[Sudan]] to the south and [[Libya]] to the west.

Egypt is one of the most populous countries in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. The great majority of its estimated 75.4 million<ref name=popclock>[http://www.msrintranet.capmas.gov.eg/pls/fdl/tst12e?action=&lname= Central Agency for Population Mobilisation and Statistics -  Population Clock (July 2008)]</ref> live near the banks of the [[Nile River]], in an area of about {{convert|40000|km2|sp=us}}, where the only [[arable land|arable]] agricultural land is found. The large areas of the [[Sahara]] [[Desert]] are sparsely inhabited. About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with the majority spread across the densely-populated centres of greater [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]] and other major cities in the [[Nile Delta]].

Egypt is famous for its [[Ancient Egypt|ancient civilization]] and some of the world's most famous monuments, including the [[Giza pyramid complex]] and its [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]].  The southern city of [[Luxor]] contains numerous ancient artifacts, such as the [[Karnak]] Temple and the [[Valley of the Kings]].  Egypt is widely regarded as an important political and cultural nation of the Middle East.

{{Hiero | ''km.t'' (Egypt) | <hiero>km-m-t:niwt</hiero> | align=left | era=default}}
One of the ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] names of the country, ''Kemet'' ({{transl|egy-Latn|kṃt}}),  (from ''kem'' "black"), is derived from the fertile black soils deposited by the Nile floods, distinct from the ''deshret'', or "red land" ({{transl|egy-Latn|dšṛt}}), of the desert.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rosalie, David |title=Pyramid Builders of Ancient Egypt: A Modern Investigation of Pharaoh's Workforce |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |pages=p. 18}}</ref> The name is realized as ''{{lang|cop-Latn|kīmi}}'' and ''{{lang|cop-Latn|kīmə}}'' in the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] stage of the Egyptian language, and appeared in early Greek as {{Polytonic|Χημία}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|Khēmía}}'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/webprojects2002/crabb/history.html|title=A Brief History of Alchemy|publisher=UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> Another name was ''{{lang|egy-Latn|t3-mry}}'' "land of the riverbank".<ref>{{cite book |title=Ancient Records of Egypt |last=Breasted |first=James Henry |coauthors= Peter A. Piccione |year=2001 |publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252069758 |pages=76;40|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bT0q7nt1-gUC&client=firefox-a }}</ref> The names of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] were ''Ta-Sheme'aw''  ({{transl|egy-Latn|t3-šmˁw}}) "sedgeland" and ''Ta-Mehew'' ({{transl|egy-Latn|t3 mḥw}}) "northland", respectively.

''{{transl|ar|Miṣr}}'', the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and modern official name of Egypt ([[Egyptian Arabic]]: ''{{transl|arz-Latn|Maṣr}}''), is of [[Semitic]] origin, directly [[cognate]] with other Semitic words for Egypt such as the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{lang-Hebrew2|מִצְרַיִם}} (''{{transl|he|Mitzráyim}}''), literally meaning "the two straits" (a reference to the dynastic separation of upper and lower Egypt).<ref name="hebrewname">[http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/emagazine/011.html Biblical Hebrew E-Magazine. January, 2005]</ref> The word originally connoted "metropolis" or "civilization" and also means "country", or "frontier-land". 

The English name "Egypt" came via the [[Latin]] word ''{{lang|la|Aegyptus}}'' derived from the [[ancient Greek]] word ''Aígyptos'' ({{lang|grc|Αίγυπτος}}). The adjective ''aigýpti, aigýptios'' was borrowed into Coptic as ''gyptios, kyptios'', and from there into Arabic as ''{{transl|ar|qubṭī}}'', back formed into ''{{transl|ar|qubṭ}}'', whence English ''[[Copt]]''. The term is derived from [[Late Egyptian]] ''Hikuptah'' "Memphis", a corruption of the earlier [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name ''Hat-ka-Ptah'' ({{transl|egy-Latn|ḥwt-k3-ptḥ}}), meaning "home of the [[Egyptian soul|ka]] (soul) of Ptah", the name of a temple to the god [[Ptah]] at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].<ref>{{Citation|last= Hoffmeier|first =James K| author-link =| title =RAMESES OF THE EXODUS NARRATIVES IS THE 13TH CENTURY B.C.

[[Image:WhiteD1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|White Desert, [[Farafra, Egypt|Farafra]]]]
At {{convert|1001450|km2|sp=us}},<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html World Factbook area rank order]</ref> Egypt is the world's 38th-largest country (after [[Mauritania]]). It is comparable in size to [[Tanzania]], twice the size of France, four times the size of the United Kingdom, and is more than half the size of the US state of [[Alaska]].

Nevertheless, due to the aridity of Egypt's climate, population centres are concentrated along the narrow Nile Valley and Delta, meaning that approximately 99% of the population uses only about 5.5% of the total land area.<ref>Hamza, Waleed. [http://iodeweb1.vliz.be/odin/bitstream/1834/383/1/Hamza.pdf Land use and Coastal Management in the Third Countries: Egypt as a case]. Accessed= 2007-06-10.</ref>

Egypt is bordered by Libya to the west, Sudan to the south, and by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the east. Egypt's important role in geopolitics stems from its strategic position: a [[transcontinental nation]], it possesses a land bridge (the Isthmus of Suez) between Africa and [[Asia]], which in turn is traversed by a navigable waterway (the [[Suez Canal]]) that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the [[Indian Ocean]] via the Red Sea.

[[Image:Nile N517266177 30554 627.jpg|thumb|left|The Nile River in Egypt]]

Apart from the Nile Valley, the majority of Egypt's landscape is a sandy desert. The winds blowing can create [[Dune|sand dunes]] more than {{convert|100|ft}} high. Egypt includes parts of the [[Sahara Desert]] and of the [[Libyan Desert]]. These deserts were referred to as the "red land" in ancient Egypt, and they protected the Kingdom of the Pharaohs from western threats.

Towns and cities include [[Alexandria]], one of the greatest ancient cities, [[Aswan]], [[Asyut]], [[Cairo]], the modern Egyptian capital, [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]], [[Giza]], the site of the Pyramid of Khufu, [[Hurghada]], [[Luxor]], [[Kom Ombo]], [[Port Safaga]], [[Port Said]], [[Sharm el Sheikh]], [[Suez]], where the Suez Canal is located, [[Zagazig]], and [[Minya, Egypt|Al-Minya]]. [[Oasis|Oases]] include [[Bahariya Oasis|Bahariya]], [[Dakhla Oasis|el Dakhla]], [[Farafra, Egypt|Farafra]], [[Kharga Oasis|el Kharga]] and [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]]. [[Protectorates]] include Ras Mohamed National Park, Zaranik Protectorate and Siwa. See [[Egyptian Protectorates]] for more information. {{MapLibrary|Egypt_sat.png|Egypt}}
===Climate===
Egypt does not receive much rainfall except in the winter months.<ref>Soliman, KH. ''Rainfall over Egypt''. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, vol. 80, issue 343, pp. 104-104.</ref> South of Cairo, rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in) per year and at intervals of many years. On a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as {{convert|410|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}},<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=60326&refer= Marsa Matruh, Egypt].  Weatherbase.com.  Last accessed February 12, 2008.</ref> with most of the rainfall between October and March. Snow falls on Sinai's mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta, Baltim, Sidi Barrany, etc. and rarely in Alexandria, frost is also known in mid-Sinai and mid-Egypt.

Temperatures average between {{convert|80|F}} and {{convert|90|F}} in summer, and up to {{convert|109|F}} on the Red Sea coast. Temperatures average between {{convert|55|F}} and {{convert|70|F}} in winter. A steady wind from the northwest helps hold down the temperature near the Mediterranean coast. The [[Khamaseen]] is a wind that blows from the south in Egypt in spring, bringing sand and dust, and sometimes raises the temperature in the desert to more than {{convert|100|F}}.

Every year, a predictable flooding of the Nile replenishes Egypt's soil. This gives the country consistent harvest throughout the year. Many know this event as ''The Gift of the Nile''.

The rise in sea levels due to [[global warming]] threatens Egypt's densely populated coastal strip and could have grave consequences for the country's economy, agriculture and industry. Combined with growing demographic pressures, a rise in sea levels could turn millions of Egyptians into [[environmental refugees]] by the end of the century, according to climate experts.<ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=77240 Contingency planning for rising sea levels in Egypt | IRIN News, March 2008]</ref>

=== Ancient Egypt ===
[[Image:PyramidsofEgypt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Giza Pyramids]]
Evidence of human habitation in the [[Nile Valley]] since the [[Paleolithic]] era appears in the form of artifacts and [[Petroglyph|rock carvings]] along the [[Nile]] terraces and in the desert oases. In the [[10th millennium BC]], a culture of [[hunter-gatherer]]s and [[fishing|fishers]] replaced a [[cereal|grain]]-grinding [[culture]]. Climate changes and/or overgrazing around 8000 BC began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt,  forming the Sahara. Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural [[Economic system|economy]] and more centralized [[society]].<ref>Midant-Reynes, Béatrix. ''The Prehistory of Egypt: From the First Egyptians to the First Kings''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers.</ref> 

By about 6000 BC the Neolithic culture rooted in the Nile Valley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/africa/nile_valley/6000-4000BC|title=The Nile Valley 6000-4000 BC Neolithic|publisher=The British Museum|year=2005|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> During the [[Neolithic]] era, several [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] cultures developed independently in [[Upper and Lower Egypt]]. The [[Badarian]] culture and the successor [[Naqada]] series are generally regarded as precursors to [[Ancient Egypt|Dynastic Egyptian civilization]]. The earliest known Lower Egyptian site, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining somewhat culturally separate, but maintaining frequent contact through trade. The earliest known evidence of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyphic]] inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on [[Naqada]] III pottery vessels, dated to about 3200 BC.<ref>Bard, Kathryn A. Ian Shaw, ed. ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Ancient Egypt''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000. p. 69.</ref> 

{{Hiero | ''tAwy'' ('Two Lands') | <hiero>N16:N16</hiero> | align=right | era=default}}A unified kingdom was founded circa 3150 [[Before Christ|BC]] by King [[Menes]], giving rise to a [[List of Egyptian dynasties|series of dynasties]] that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia. [[Egyptians]] subsequently referred to their unified country as ''tawy'', meaning "two lands",  and later ''kemet'' ([[Coptic language|Coptic]]: ''kīmi''), the "black land", a reference to the fertile black soil deposited by the Nile river. [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]] flourished during this long period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religion]], [[Art of Ancient Egypt|arts]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and customs. The [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt|first two ruling dynasties]] of a unified Egypt set the stage for the [[Old Kingdom]] period, c.2700−2200 BC., famous for its many [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], most notably the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]] [[pyramid of Djoser]] and the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza Pyramids]].

[[Image:SphinxGiza.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]] and the [[Giza pyramid complex|Pyramids of Giza]], built during the [[Old Kingdom]], are modern national icons that are  at the heart of Egypt's thriving tourism industry.]]
The [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]] ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years. Stronger Nile floods and stabilization of government, however, brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] ''c''. 2040 BC, reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh [[Amenemhat III]]. A [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|second period of disunity]] heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt, that of the [[Semitic]] [[Hyksos]]. The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at [[Avaris]]. They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by [[Ahmose I]], who founded the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and relocated the capital from [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].

[[Image:Cairo, Old Cairo, Hanging Church, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Hanging Church]] of Cairo, first built in the third or fourth century AD, is one of the most famous [[Coptic]] Churches in Egypt.]]

The [[New Kingdom]] (c.1550−1070 BC) began with the Eighteenth Dynasty, marking the rise of Egypt as an [[Power in international relations|international power]] that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as [[Jebel Barkal]] in [[Nubia]], and included parts of the [[Levant]] in the east. This period is noted for some of the most well-known [[Pharaoh]]s, including [[Hatshepsut]], [[Thutmose III]], [[Akhenaten]] and his wife [[Nefertiti]], [[Tutankhamun]] and [[Ramesses II]]. The first historically attested expression of [[monotheism]] came during this period in the form of [[Atenism]]. Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom. The country was later invaded by [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]], [[Kush|Nubians]] and [[Assyria]]ns, but native Egyptians drove them out and regained control of their country.

The [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth Dynasty]] was the last native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch. It [[History of Egypt under Achaemenid Persian domination|fell to the Persians]] in 343 BC after the last native Pharaoh, King [[Nectanebo II]], was defeated in battle. Later, Egypt fell to the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Greeks]] and [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Romans]], beginning over two thousand years of foreign rule. 

Before Egypt became part of the [[Aegyptus (Roman province)#Byzantine Egypt|Byzantine]] realm, Christianity had been brought by [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] in the AD first century. [[Diocletian]]'s reign marked the transition from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era in Egypt, when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted. The [[New Testament]] had by then been translated into Egyptian.  After the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, a distinct [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]] was firmly established.<ref>Kamil, Jill. ''Coptic Egypt: History and Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 1997. p. 39</ref>

The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief [[Aegyptus (Roman province)#Persian and Arab conquests|Persian]] invasion early in the seventh century, until in AD 639, Egypt was [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|invaded]] by the [[Muslim]] [[Arabs]]. The form of Islam the Arabs brought to Egypt was [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]].  Early in this period, Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices that had survived through [[Coptic Christianity]], giving rise to various [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders that have flourished to this day.<ref>El-Daly, Okasha. ''Egyptology: The Missing Millennium''. London: UCL Press, 2005. p. 140</ref> Muslim rulers nominated by the [[Islamic Caliphate]] [[History of Arab Egypt|remained in control of Egypt]] for the next six centuries, including a period for which it was the seat of the Caliphate under the [[Fatimid]]s. With the end of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]], the [[Mamluk]]s, a [[Turkish people|Turco]]-[[Circassians|Circassian]] military caste, took control about AD 1250.  They continued to govern even after the [[History of Ottoman Egypt|conquest of Egypt]] by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1517.

=== Modern History ===
[[Image:Citadel2.jpg|thumb|left|Mosque of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohamed Ali]] built in the early nineteenth century within the [[Cairo Citadel]].]]
The brief [[French Invasion of Egypt]] led by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1798 had a great social impact on the country and its culture. Native Egyptians became exposed to the principles of the [[French Revolution]] and had a chance to exercise [[self-governance]].<ref>Vatikiotis, P.J. ''The History of Modern Egypt''. 4th edition. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1992, p. 39</ref> The expulsion of the French in 1801 by Ottoman, Mamluk, and British forces was followed by four years of anarchy in which Ottomans, Mamluks, and Albanians who were nominally in the service of the Ottomans, wrestled for power. Out of this chaos, the commander of the Albanian regiment, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (Kavalali Mehmed Ali Pasha) emerged as a dominant figure and in 1805 was acknowledged by the [[Sultan]] in [[Istanbul]] as his ''[[pasha]]'' ([[viceroy]]) in Egypt; <!--[[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power]] -->the title implied subordination to the Sultan but this was in fact a polite fiction: Ottoman power in Egypt was finished and Muhammad Ali, an ambitious and able leader, established a [[dynasty]] that was to rule Egypt (at first really and later as British puppets) until the revolution of 1952. His primary focus was military: he annexed Northern Sudan (1820-1824), [[Syria]] (1833), and parts of [[Arabia]] and [[Anatolia]]; but in 1841 the European powers, fearful lest he topple Byzantium itself, checked him: he had to return most of his conquests to the Ottomans, but he kept the Sudan and his title to Egypt was made hereditary. A more lasting consequence of his military ambition is that it made him the moderniser of Egypt. Anxious to learn the military (and therefore industrial) techniques of the great powers he sent students to the West and invited training missions to Egypt. He built industries, a system of canals for irrigation and transport, and reformed the [[civil service]]. For better or worse, the introduction in 1820 of long-staple [[cotton]], the Egyptian variety of which became famous, transformed Egyptian agriculture into a cash-crop monoculture befor the end of the century. The social effects of this were enormous: it led to the concentration of agriculture in the hands of large landowners, and, with the additional trigger of high cotton prices caused by  the United States' [[United States Civil War|civil war]] production drop, to a large influx of foreigners who began in earnest the exploitation of Egypt for international commodity production.<ref>Nejla M. Abu Izzeddin, ''Nasser of the Arabs'', published ''circa'' 1973, p 2.</ref>
  
Muhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son [[Ibrahim Pasha|Ibrahim]] (in September 1848), then by a grandson [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]] (in November 1848), then by [[Said Pasha|Said]] (in 1854), and [[Isma'il Pasha|Isma'il]] (in 1863).
<!--  In 1866, the Assembly of Delegates was founded to serve as an advisory body for the government. Members of the Assembly were elected from across Egypt and came to have an important influence on governmental decisions.<ref>Jankowski, James. ''Egypt: A Short History.'' Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2000. p. 83</ref>     That's hogwash, the assembly had almost no power and rarely met    -->
Abbas I was cautious. Said and Ismail were ambitious developers; unfortunately they spent beyond their means. The Suez Canal, built in partnership with the French, was completed in in 1869. The expense of this and other projects had two effects: it led to enormous debt to European [[bank]]s, and caused popular discontent because of the onerous [[tax]]ation it necessitated. In 1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt's share in the canal to the British government. Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French [[Dual control|controllers]] who sat in the Egyptian cabinet, and, "with the financial power of the bondholders behind them, were the real power in the government."<ref>Nejla M. Abu Izzeddin, ''Nasser of the Arabs", p 2.</ref> Local dissatisfaction with Ismail and with European intrusion led to the formation of the first [[national liberation|nationalist groupings]] in 1879, with [[Ahmad Urabi]] a prominent figure. In 1882 he became head of a nationalist-dominated ministry committed to democratic reforms including parliamentary control of the budget. Fearing a diminishment of their control, Britain and France intervened militarily, bombarding Alexandria and crushing the Egyptian army at the [[battle of Tel el-Kebir]].<ref>Anglo French motivation: Derek Hopwood, ''Egypt: Politics and Society 1945-1981''.

[[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II]] was deposed as khedive and replaced by his uncle, [[Husayn Kamil]], as sultan.<ref>James Jankowski, ''Egypt, A Short History'', p. 111</ref>

In 1906, the [[Dinshaway Incident]] prompted many neutral Egyptians to join the nationalist movement. After the First World War, [[Saad Zaghlul]] and the [[Wafd Party]] led the Egyptian nationalist movement, gaining a majority at the local [[Legislative Assembly]]. When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to [[Malta]] on March 8, 1919, the country arose in its [[Egyptian revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. Constant revolting by the Egyptian people throughout the country led Great Britain to issue a unilateral declaration of Egypt's independence on February 22, 1922.<ref>Jankowski, ''op cit''., p. 112</ref>

=== The Revolution ===

The new Egyptian government drafted and implemented a new [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|constitution]] in 1923 based on a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] representative system. Saad Zaghlul was popularly-elected as [[Prime Minister of Egypt]] in 1924.  In 1936 the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] was concluded. Continued instability in the government due to remaining British control and increasing political involvement by the king led to the ouster of the monarchy and the dissolution of the parliament in a military ''[[coup d'état]]'' known as the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]]. The officers, known as the [[Free Officers Movement]], forced King [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] to abdicate in support of his son [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fuad]].

On June 18, 1953, the Egyptian Republic was declared, with General [[Muhammad Naguib]] as the first President of the Republic. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]{{ndash}} the real architect of the 1952 movement{{ndash}} and was later put under [[house arrest]]. Nasser assumed [[Political power|power]] as President and declared the full independence of Egypt from the United Kingdom on June 18, 1956. His [[nationalization]] of the Suez Canal on July 26, 1956 prompted the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].

Three years after the 1967 [[Six Day War]], during which Israel had invaded and occupied [[Sinai]], Nasser died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]]. Sadat switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972. He launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform policy, while violently clamping down on religious and secular opposition alike. 

In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the [[Yom Kippur War|October War]], a surprise attack against the Israeli forces occupying the Sinai Peninsula and the [[Golan Heights]]. It was an attempt to liberate the territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier. Both the US and the USSR intervened and a [[Ceasefire|cease-fire]] was reached. Despite not being a complete military success, most historians agree that the [[Yom Kippur war|October War]] presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai in return with peace with Israel. 

Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977, which led to the 1979 [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty|peace treaty]] in exchange for the complete Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the [[Arab world]] and led to Egypt's expulsion from the Arab League, but it was supported by the vast majority of Egyptians.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 443</ref> A fundamentalist military soldier assassinated Sadat in Cairo in 1981. He was succeeded by the incumbent [[Hosni Mubarak]]. In 2003, the [[Kefaya|Egyptian Movement for Change]], popularly known as ''Kefaya'', was launched to seek a return to [[democracy]] and greater [[civil liberties]].

== Identity ==
{{main|Egyptians#Identity}}
[[Image:Egypt's Awakening.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mahmoud Mokhtar]]'s ''Egypt's Renaissance'' 1919-1928, [[Cairo University]].]]
The Nile Valley was home to one of the [[Ancient Egypt|oldest cultures in the world]], spanning three thousand years of continuous history. When Egypt fell under a [[History of Egypt|series of foreign occupations]] after 343 BC, each left an indelible mark on the country's [[Culture of Egypt|cultural landscape]]. Egyptian identity evolved in the span of this long period of occupation to accommodate, in principle, two new religions, [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]; and a new language, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and its spoken descendant, [[Egyptian Arabic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.youregypt.com/issue3/topic.htm|title=The Egyptian Identity: Pharaohs, Moslems, Arabs, Africans, Middle Easterners or Mediterranean People?|author=Raymon Kondos|date=February 15|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> The degree to which Egyptians identify with each layer of Egypt's history in articulating a sense of [[collective identity]] can vary. Questions of identity came to fore in the last century as Egypt sought to free itself from foreign occupation for the first time in two thousand years. Three chief ideologies came to head: ethno-territorial Egyptian nationalism, secular [[Arab nationalism]] and [[pan-Arabism]], and [[Islamism]]. Egyptian nationalism predates its Arab counterpart by many decades, having roots in the nineteenth century and becoming the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anti-colonial activists and intellectuals until the early 20th century.<ref>Jankowski, James.

== Politics ==     
{{main|Politics of Egypt}}

===National===
Egypt has been a republic since June 18, 1953. President [[Hosni Mubarak|Mohamed Hosni Mubarak]] has been the [[President of Egypt|President of the Republic]] since October 14, 1981, following the assassination of former-President [[Anwar Sadat|Mohammed Anwar El-Sadat]]. Mubarak is currently serving his fifth term in office. He is the leader of the ruling [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]]. [[Heads of government of Egypt|Prime Minister]] Dr. [[Ahmed Nazif]] was sworn in as Prime Minister on July 9, 2004, following the resignation of Dr. [[Atef Ebeid]] from his office.

Although power is ostensibly organized under a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[semi-presidential system]], whereby the executive power is theoretically divided between the President and the [[Prime Minister of Egypt|Prime Minister]], in practice it rests almost solely with the President who traditionally has been elected in single-candidate elections for more than fifty years. Egypt also holds regular multi-party parliamentary elections. The last presidential election, in which Mubarak won a fifth consecutive term, [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|was held in September 2005]].

In late February 2005, President Mubarak announced in a surprise television broadcast that he had ordered the reform of the country's presidential election law, paving the way for multi-candidate polls in the upcoming presidential election. For the first time since the [[Free Officers Movement|1952 movement]], the Egyptian people had an apparent chance to elect a leader from a list of various candidates. The President said his initiative came "out of my full conviction of the need to consolidate efforts for more freedom and democracy."<ref>Business TodayEGYPT. [http://www.businesstodayegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=4565 Mubarak throws presidential race wide open]. March 2005.</ref> However, the new law placed draconian restrictions on the filing for presidential candidacies, designed to prevent well-known candidates such as [[Ayman Nour]] from standing against Mubarak, and paved the road for his easy re-election victory.<ref>Lavin, Abigail.

March 27, 2006.</ref> 
Concerns were once again expressed after the 2005 presidential elections about government interference in the election process through fraud and vote-rigging, in addition to police brutality and violence by pro-Mubarak supporters against opposition demonstrators.<ref>Murphy, Dan. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0526/p06s01-wome.html Egyptian vote marred by violence]. [[The Christian Science Monitor|Christian Science Monitor]].

As a result, most Egyptians are skeptical about the process of [[democratization]] and the role of the elections. Less than 25 percent of the country's 32 million registered voters (out of a population of more than 72 million) turned out for the 2005 elections.<ref>Gomez, Edward M.

December 5, 2006.</ref>

Thirty-four constitutional changes voted on by parliament on March 19, 2007 prohibit parties from using religion as a basis for political activity; allow the drafting of a new anti-terrorism law to replace the emergency legislation in place since 1981, giving police wide powers of arrest and surveillance; give the president power to dissolve parliament; and end judicial monitoring of election.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6472031.stm Anger over Egypt vote timetable] [[BBC]] News.</ref> As opposition members of parliament withdrew from voting on the proposed changes, it was expected that the referendum would be boycotted by a great number of Egyptians in protest of what has been considered  a breach of democratic practices. Eventually it was reported that only 27% of the registered voters went to the polling stations under heavy police presence and tight political control of the ruling National Democratic Party. It was officially announced on March 27, 2007 that 75.9% of those who participated in the referendum approved of the [[constitutional amendment]]s introduced by President Mubarak and was endorsed by opposition free parliament, thus allowing the introduction of laws that curb the activity of certain opposition elements, particularly Islamists.

Several local and international human rights organizations, including [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], have for many years criticized Egypt's human rights record as poor. In 2005, President [[Hosni Mubarak]] faced unprecedented public criticism when he clamped down on [[Kefaya|democracy activists]] challenging his rule. Some of the most serious human rights violations, according to HRW's 2006 report on Egypt, are routine torture, arbitrary detentions and trials before military and state security courts.<ref name="HRW">Human Rights Watch.

Discriminatory personal status laws governing marriage, divorce, custody and inheritance which put women at a disadvantage have also been cited. Laws concerning [[Copt]]ic [[Christian]]s which place restrictions on church building and open worship have been recently eased, but major construction still requires governmental approval, while sporadic attacks on Christians and churches continue.<ref>[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=19813&sec=36&cont=3 Church Building Regulations Eased]</ref> Intolerance of [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] and unorthodox Muslim sects, such as [[Sufism|Sufi]]s and [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]], also remains a problem.<ref name="HRW" /> The Egyptian legal system only recognizes three religions: [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]].

In 2007, human rights group [[Amnesty International]] released a report criticizing Egypt for [[torture]] and illegal detention. The report alleges that Egypt has become an international center for torture, where other nations send suspects for interrogation, often as part of the [[War on Terror]]. The report calls on Egypt to bring its [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorism laws]] into accordance with international human rights statutes and on other nations to stop sending their detainees to Egypt.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6544149.stm Egypt torture centre, report says].

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of Egypt}}
Egypt's foreign policy operates along moderate lines. Factors such as [[population size]], historical events, military strength, diplomatic expertise and a strategic geographical position give Egypt extensive political influence in Africa and the Middle East. Cairo has been a crossroads of regional commerce and culture for centuries, and its intellectual and Islamic institutions are at the center of the region's social and [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural development]].

The permanent [[Headquarters of the Arab League]] are located in Cairo and the Secretary General of the Arab League has traditionally been an Egyptian. Former Egyptian Foreign Minister [[Amr Moussa]] is the current Secretary General. The Arab League briefly moved from Egypt to Tunis in 1978, as a protest to the signing by Egypt of a peace treaty with Israel, but returned in 1989.

Egypt was the first Arab state to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, with the signing of the [[Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty]] in 1979. Egypt has a major influence amongst other Arab states, and has historically played an important role as a mediator in resolving disputes between various Arab states, and in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian dispute]].

Former Egyptian [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] served as [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] from 1991 to 1996.

[[Image:Egypt-map-idsc.gif|thumb|right|320px|Map of Egypt, showing the 29 capitals of governorates, plus the self-governing city of [[Luxor]] (numbers label 5 capitals).]]

Egypt is divided into 29 [[governorate]]s (in Arabic, called ''muhafazat'', singular ''[[muhafazah]]''). The governorates are further divided into regions (''[[markaz]]es'').

Each governorate has a capital, often having the same name as the governorate (''see map, showing names of the 29 capitals'').

The tables (''below'') list the governorates in alphabetical order.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Egypt}}

[[Image:Downtowncairo.jpg|thumb|left|250px| Cairo's city centre is a busy economic hub]] Egypt's economy depends mainly on agriculture, media, petroleum exports, and tourism; there are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad, mainly in [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[Persian Gulf]] and Europe. The completion of the [[Aswan High Dam]] in 1970 and the resultant [[Lake Nasser]] have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly-growing population, limited [[arable land]], and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/egypt_2.htm|title=Egypt: Economy|publisher=LookLex Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-08-21}} </ref>

The government has struggled to prepare the economy for the new millennium through economic reform and massive investments in communications and physical infrastructure. Egypt has been receiving  U.S. [[foreign aid]] (since 1979, an average of $2.2 billion per year) and is the third-largest recipient of such funds from the United States following the Iraq war. Its main revenues however come from tourism as well as traffic that goes through the Suez Canal.

Egypt has a developed energy market based on coal, oil, [[natural gas]], and [[Hydropower|hydro power]].  Substantial coal deposits are in the north-east Sinai, and are mined at the rate of about {{convert|600000|t|lk=on|sp=us}} per year.  Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions, the [[Gulf of Suez]], and the Nile Delta.  Egypt has huge reserves of gas, estimated at over {{convert|1100000|m3|sp=us}} in the 1990s, and LNG is exported to many countries.

Economic conditions have started to improve considerably after a period of stagnation from the adoption of more liberal economic policies by the government, as well as increased revenues from tourism and a booming [[stock market]]. In its annual report, the [[IMF]] has rated Egypt as one of the top countries in the world undertaking economic reforms.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} Some major economic reforms taken by the new government since 2003 include a dramatic slashing of customs and tariffs. A new [[Tax law|taxation law]] implemented in 2005 decreased corporate taxes from 40% to the current 20%, resulting in a stated 100% increase in [[tax revenue]] by the year 2006.
 
[[Image:Nile07(js).jpg|thumb|upright|Tourists ride in traditional Nile boats.]]

FDI ([[Foreign direct investment|Foreign Direct Investment]]) into Egypt has increased considerably in the past few years due to the recent [[Liberal theory of economics|economic liberalization]] measures taken by minister of investment Mahmoud Mohieddin, exceeding $6 billion in 2006.

Although one of the main obstacles still facing the Egyptian economy is the trickle down of the wealth to the average population, many Egyptians criticize their government for higher prices of basic goods while their [[Standard of living|standards of living]] or purchasing power remains relatively stagnant. Often corruption is blamed by Egyptians as the main impediment to feeling the benefits of the newly attained wealth.<ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=27105 IRIN Middle East | Middle East | Egypt | EGYPT: Corruption hampering development, says opposition report | Other | Breaking News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2963 Daily News Egypt - Full Article<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.egypttoday.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2978 et - Full Story<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Major reconstruction of the country's infrastructure is promised by the government, with a large portion of the sum paid for the newly acquired 3rd mobile license ($3 billion) by Etisalat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesstodayegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6902|title=Etisalat Wins Third License|author=Fatima El Saadani|month=August | year=2006|publisher=Business Today|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref>

The best known examples of Egyptian companies that have expanded regionally and globally are the [[Orascom Group]] and [[Raya]]. The IT sector has been expanding rapidly in the past few years, with many new start-ups conducting outsourcing business to North America and Europe, operating with companies such as Microsoft, Oracle and other major corporations, as well as numerous SME's. Some of these companies are the Xceed Contact Center, Raya Contact Center, E Group Connections and C3 along with other start ups in that country. The sector has been stimulated by new Egyptian entrepreneurs trying to capitalize on their country's huge potential in the sector, as well as constant government encouragement.

{{main|Demographics of Egypt|Egyptians}}
[[Image:Egyptian farm.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Egyptian farm]]

Egypt is the most populated country in the Middle East and the third most populous on the [[African continent]], with an estimated 75 million people (as of mid-2008). Almost all the population is concentrated along the banks of the Nile (notably Cairo and Alexandria), in the Delta and near the Suez Canal. Approximately 90% of the population adheres to [[Islam in Egypt|Islam]] and most of the remainder to Christianity, primarily the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] denomination.<ref name="Factbook">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html#People|title=Egyptian people section from the World Factbook|work=[[World Fact Book]]|accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref> Apart from religious affiliation, Egyptians can be divided demographically into those who live in the major urban centers and the [[fellah]]in or farmers of rural villages. The last 40 years have seen a rapid increase in population due to [[History of medicine#Modern medicine|medical advances]] and massive increase in agricultural productivity,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6496585.stm BBC NEWS | The limits of a Green Revolution?]</ref> made by the [[Green Revolution]].<ref>[http://www.foodfirst.org/media/opeds/2000/4-greenrev.html Food First/Institute for Food and Development Policy]</ref> 

[[Egyptians]] are by far the largest ethnic group in Egypt at 98% of the total population.<ref name="Factbook" /> Ethnic minorities include the [[Bedouin]] Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the [[Sinai Peninsula]], the [[Berber language|Berber]]-speaking [[Siwis]] ([[Berber people|Amazigh]]) of the [[Siwa Oasis]], and the ancient [[Nubian]] communities clustered along the Nile. There are also tribal communities of [[Beja people|Beja]] concentrated in the south-eastern-most corner of the country, and a number of [[Dom people|Dom]] clans mostly in the Nile Delta and [[Faiyum]] who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanization increases.

Egypt also hosts an unknown number of [[refugees]] and asylum seekers, but they are estimated to be between 500,000 and 3 million.<ref name="Refugees">[http://www.forcedmigration.org/guides/fmo029/fmo029-3.htm Refugees in Egypt].</ref> There are some 70,000 [[Palestinian refugee]]s,<ref name="Refugees" /> and about 150,000 recently arrived [[Refugees of Iraq|Iraqi refugees]],<ref>[http://hrw.org/backgrounder/refugees/iraq0407/4.htm Iraq: from a Flood to a Trickle: Egypt]</ref> but the number of the largest group, the [[Sudanese refugees in Egypt|Sudanese]], is contested.<ref>See [http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?subm=&ssm=&cid=96 The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants] for a lower estimate. The [http://www.eohr.org/ref/ The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights] states on its web site that in 2000 the [[World Council of Churches]] claimed that "between two and five million Sudanese have come to Egypt in recent years". Most Sudanese refugees come to Egypt in the hope of resettling in Europe or the US.</ref> The once-vibrant [[Greeks in Egypt|Greek]] and [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Jewish communities in Egypt]] have virtually [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|disappeared]], with only a small number remaining in the country, but many Egyptian Jews visit on religious occasions and for tourism. Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites are found in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities.

== Media ==
{{main|Media of Egypt}}
Egyptian [[Mass media|media]] are highly influential both in Egypt and the [[Arab World]], attributed to large audiences and increasing freedom from government control.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/country_profiles/737642.stm#media Country profiles: Egypt] ''BBC''</ref><ref name=tbs>[http://www.tbsjournal.com/Archives/Fall05/Levinson.html "Plus ca Change: The Role of the Media in Egypt's First Contested Presidential Elections"], ''TBS''</ref> Freedom of the media is guaranteed in the constitution; however, many laws still restrict this right.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=fh>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=251&year=2007 Freedom House 2007 report]</ref> After the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|Egyptian presidential election of 2005]], Ahmed Selim, office director for Information Minister Anas al-Fiqi, declared an era of a "free, transparent and independent Egyptian media."<ref name=tbs/>

Egypt hosts two major religious institutions. [[Al-Azhar University]], founded in 970 [[A.D]] by the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] as the first Islamic University in Egypt and the main Egyptian Church the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] established in the middle of the 1st century by [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]]. 

In Egypt, [[Muslims]] and [[Christians]] live as neighbors, they share a common history and [[national identity]]. They also share the same [[ethnicity]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[culture]], and [[language]].<ref name="International Religious Freedom Report 2008"/>

[[Image:monastry3.jpg|thumb|Millions of Egyptians follow the Christian faith as members of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].]]

Religion plays a central role in most Egyptians' lives, The [[Adhan]] (Islamic call to prayer) that is heard five times a day has the informal effect of regulating the pace of everything from business to media and entertainment. Cairo is famous for its numerous [[mosque]] [[minaret]]s and is justifiably dubbed "the city of 1,000 minarets",<ref name="The Independent on Cairo">{{cite news|title= Cairo: Welcome to the city of 1,000 minarets|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/africa/cairo-welcome-to-the-city-of-1000-minarets-692635.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|location=London|author= Robin Barton|date=2001-02-19}}</ref> with a significant number of [[Steeple (architecture)|church towers]].

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Egypt}}
[[Image:LibraryAlexandria1-Omar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] is a commemoration of the ancient [[Library of Alexandria]] in Egypt's second largest city.]]
[[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]] has five thousand years of [[Recorded History|recorded history]]. [[Ancient Egypt]] was among the earliest [[civilization]]s and for millennia, Egypt maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe, the Middle East and other African countries. After the Pharaonic era, Egypt itself came under the influence of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], Christianity, and Islamic culture. Today, many aspects of Egypt's ancient culture exist in interaction with newer elements, including the influence of modern [[Western culture]], itself with roots in ancient Egypt. 

Egypt's capital city, Cairo, is Africa's largest city and has been renowned for centuries as a center of learning, culture and commerce. Egypt has the highest number of [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureates]] in Africa and the Arab World. Some Egyptian born politicians were or are currently at the helm of major international organizations like [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] of the [[United Nations]] and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] of the [[IAEA]].

====Renaissance====
The work of early nineteenth-century scholar Rifa'a et-Tahtawi gave rise to the Egyptian Renaissance, marking the transition from [[History of Ottoman Egypt|Medieval]] to [[History of Modern Egypt|Early Modern]] Egypt. His work renewed interest in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquity]] and exposed Egyptian society to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles. Tahtawi co-founded with education reformer [[Ali Mubarak]] a native [[Egyptology]] school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars, such as [[Suyuti]] and [[Maqrizi]], who themselves studied the [[History of ancient Egypt|history]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|antiquities]] of Egypt.<ref>El-Daly, ''op cit''., p. 29</ref> Egypt's renaissance peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through the work of people like [[Muhammad Abduh]], [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], [[Tawfiq el-Hakim]], [[Louis Awad]], [[Qasim Amin]], [[Salama Moussa]], [[Taha Hussein]] and [[Mahmoud Mokhtar]]. They forged a [[liberalism|liberal]] path for Egypt expressed as a commitment to individual freedom, [[secularism]] and faith in science to bring progress.<ref>Jankowski, ''op cit''., p. 130</ref>

====Art and architecture====
[[Image:Maler der Grabkammer des Ramose 002.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]] painting from the tomb of [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] governor [[Ramose]] in [[Deir el-Madinah]].]]
The Egyptians were one of the first major civilizations to codify design elements in art and architecture. The wall paintings done in the service of the [[Pharaoh]]s followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Egyptian civilization is renowned for its colossal pyramids, [[colonnade]]s and monumental tombs. Well-known examples are the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] designed by ancient architect and engineer [[Imhotep]], the [[Sphinx]], and the temple of [[Abu Simbel]]. Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene, from the vernacular architecture of [[Hassan Fathy]] and [[Ramses Wissa Wassef]], to [[Mahmoud Mokhtar]]'s famous sculptures, to the distinctive [[Coptic art|Coptic iconography]] of [[Isaac Fanous]].

The [[Cairo Opera House]] serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital. Egypt's media and arts industry has flourished since the late nineteenth century, today with more than thirty satellite channels and over one hundred motion pictures produced each year. Cairo has long been known as the "Hollywood of the Middle East;" its annual film festival, the [[Cairo International Film Festival]], has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers' Associations.<ref>[http://www.ukhotmovies.com/film-festivals/cairo-film-festival/information.html Cairo Film Festival information].</ref> To bolster its media industry further, especially with the keen competition from the [[Persian Gulf Arab States]] and [[Lebanon]], a large media city was built. Some Egyptian-born actors, like [[Omar Sharif]], have achieved worldwide fame.

====Literature====
[[Literature]] constitutes an important cultural element in the life of Egypt. Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of [[Arabic literature]], and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/EgyptOnline/Culture/000001/0203000000000000000567.htm|title=Global influence of Egyptian culture|date=February 4, 2006|publisher=Egypt State Information Service|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> The first modern Egyptian novel ''[[Zaynab (novel)|Zaynab]]'' by [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]] was published in 1913 in the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian vernacular]].<ref>Vatikiotis, ''op cit''.</ref> Egyptian novelist [[Naguib Mahfouz]] was the first Arabic-language writer to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Egyptian women writers include [[Nawal El Saadawi]], well known for her [[feminism|feminist]] [[activism]], and [[Alifa Rifaat]] who also writes about women and tradition. Vernacular poetry is perhaps the most popular [[literary genre]] amongst Egyptians, represented by the works of [[Ahmed Fouad Negm]] (Fagumi), [[Salah Jaheen]] and [[Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi]].

====Music====
{{main|Music of Egypt}}
[[Image:Egyptian musicians.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Upper Egyptian folk musicians from [[Kom Ombo]].]]
[[Music of Egypt|Egyptian music]] is a rich mixture of indigenous, Mediterranean, African and Western elements. In [[Ancient Egypt|antiquity]], Egyptians were playing harps and flutes, including two indigenous instruments: the [[ney]] and the [[oud]]. [[Percussion]] and vocal music also became an important part of the local music tradition ever since. Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu-l Hamuli, Almaz and Mahmud Osman, who influenced the later work of Egyptian music giants such as [[Sayed Darwish]], [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]] and [[Abdel Halim Hafez]]. These prominent artists were followed later by [[Amr Diab]]. He is seen by many as the new age "Musical Legend", whose fan base stretches all over the Middle East and Europe. From the 1970s onwards, Egyptian pop music has become increasingly important in Egyptian culture, while Egyptian folk music continues to be played during weddings and other festivities.

====Festivals====
Egypt is famous for its many festivals and religious carnivals, also known as ''mulid''. They are usually associated with a particular Coptic or Sufi saint, but are often celebrated by all Egyptians irrespective of creed or religion. [[Ramadan]] has a special flavor in Egypt, celebrated with sounds, lights (local lanterns known as ''fawanees'') and much flare that many Muslim tourists from the region flock to Egypt during Ramadan to witness the spectacle. The ancient spring festival of [[Sham El Nessim|Sham en Nisim]] ([[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{Coptic|Ϭⲱⲙ‘ⲛⲛⲓⲥⲓⲙ}} ''shom en nisim'') has been celebrated by Egyptians for thousands of years, typically between the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian months]] of [[Paremoude]] (April) and [[Pashons]] (May), following [[Easter]] Sunday.

====Sports====
[[Image:98228505 21d43dad6d.jpg|thumb|[[Cairo International Stadium]] during the [[2006 African Cup of Nations]]]]
[[Football (soccer)]] is the ''de facto'' [[national sport]] of Egypt. Egyptian Soccer clubs [[Al-Ahly|El Ahly]], [[El Zamalek]] and  [[Ismaily]] are the most popular teams and enjoy the reputation of long-time regional champions. The great rivalries keep the streets of Egypt energized as people fill the streets when their favorite team wins. Egypt is rich in soccer history as soccer has been around for over 100 years. The country is home to many African championships such as the [[Africa Cup of Nations]]. While, Egypt's national team has not qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] since 1990, the Egyptian team won the Africa Cup Of Nations an unprecedented  six times, including two times in a row in 1957 and 1959 and again in 2006 and 2008, setting a world record.

[[Squash (sport)|Squash]] and [[tennis]] are other popular sports in Egypt. The Egyptian squash team has been known for its fierce competition in international championships since the 1930s. [[Amr Shabana]] is Egypt's best player and the winner of the world open three times and the best player of 2006.
 
The Egyptian Handball team also holds another record; throughout the 34 times the [[African Handball Nations Championship]] was held, Egypt won first place five times (including 2008), five times second place, four times third place, and came in fourth place twice. The team won 6th and 7th places in 1995, 1997 at the World Men's Handball Championship, and twice won 6th place at the 1996 and 2000 Olympics.

In 2007, Omar joined Ben Stephens (England), Victoria James (Wales) and Greg Maud (South Africa) in putting together an expedition to climb Mount Everest from its South side. The Everest expedition began on 25 March 2007 and lasted for just over 9 weeks. On the 17th of May at precisely 9:49 am Nepal time, Omar became the first and youngest Egyptian to climb 8,850m Mount Everest. He also became the first Egyptian to climb Everest from its South face, the same route taken by Sir Edmund Hilary and Sherpa Tenzing in 1953.

Egypt has a long history of [[Egypt at the Olympics|participation at the Summer Olympics]] since 1912.
