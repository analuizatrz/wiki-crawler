The '''Mars Scout Program''' is a [[NASA]] program to send a series  of small, low-cost missions to [[Mars]], competitively selected from innovative proposals by the scientific community.  The first [[robotic spacecraft]] in this program is ''[[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]]'', a [[lander (spacecraft)|lander]] originally intended for the cancelled [[Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander|Mars Surveyor]] mission.  Phoenix was launched [[August 4]], [[2007]], and will land in the icy northern polar region of the planet on [[May 25]] [[2008]].

Originally planned for launch in 2011, the second scout mission is now targeted for launch in 2013 due to an organizational conflict of interest that was discovered in one of the mission proposal team's Phase A Concept Study.

This third installment of the Mars Scout Missions is tentativley scheduled for 2018.

The [[Mars 2011|second set of Scout missions]] are under review and projected to launch in [[2013]].<ref name="release">.   {{Cite web
