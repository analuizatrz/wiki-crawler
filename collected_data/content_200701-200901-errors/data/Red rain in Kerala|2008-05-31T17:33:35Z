From [[25 July]] to [[23 September]] [[2001]], red rain sporadically fell on the southern [[India|Indian]] state of [[Kerala]]. Heavy downpours occurred in which the [[rain]] was coloured red, staining clothes with an appearance similar to that of blood.<ref name="gentleman">{{cite web | last = Gentleman  | first = Amelia | coauthors = Robin McKie | year = 2006 | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1723913,00.html | title = Red rain could prove that aliens have landed | publisher = Guardian Unlimited | accessdate = March 12 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> Yellow, green, and black rain was also reported.<ref name=hinduonet>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2001/07/29/stories/0229000p.htm JULY 28, 2001, The Hindu: Multicolour rain]</ref><ref name="L&K 2006"/><ref name=BBC/> Coloured rain had been reported in Kerala in as early as 1896 and several times since then.<ref name=CESS/>

It was initially announced that the rains were coloured by fallout from a hypothetical meteor burst, but a study commissioned by the [[Government of India]] found that the rains had been coloured by airborne spores from a locally prolific terrestrial [[algae|alga]]. Other explanations were proposed but not until early 2006 did the coloured rains of Kerala gain widespread attention in the popular media. A controversial conjecture that the coloured particles were [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] cells was proposed by [[Godfrey Louis]] and Santhosh Kumar of the [[Mahatma Gandhi University]] in [[Kottayam]].<ref name="L&K 2006"/> No information to support the extraterrestrial hypothesis has been published since 2006.

Source: CCAB, Cardiff University]]

The brownish-red solid separated from the red rain consisted of about 90% round red particles and the balance consisted of [[protozoans]] and debris.<ref name=CESS/> The red particles in [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] in the rain water were responsible for the colour of the rain, which at times was as strongly coloured as [[blood]]. A small percentage of particles were white or had light yellow, bluish gray and green tints.<ref name="L&K 2006"/> The red particles were typically 4 to 10 [[micrometre|µm]] across and spherical or oval. At higher magnification some particles had depressed centre, suggestive of biological cell, especially red blood cells.
At still higher magnification some particles showed internal structures.  

===Chemical composition===
Several groups of researchers analyzed the chemical elements in the solid particles and different techniques gave similar results. The paticles were mostly [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] with lesser amounts of [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[silicon]], [[chlorine]] and [[metals]].

Sediment (red particles plus debris) from the red rain was collected and analyzed by the [[Centre for Earth Science Studies]] (CESS) using a combination of ion-coupled plasma [[Mass Spectrometer|mass spectrometry]], atomic absorption spectrometry and wet chemical methods. The major elements found are listed below.<ref name=CESS>{{cite journal

J. Thomas Brenna in the Division of Nutritional Sciences at [[Cornell University]] conducted carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses using a scanning electron microscope with X-ray microanalysis, an elemental analyzer, and an isotope ratio (IR) mass spectrometer.

==Possible causes for the red rain==

===Conventional hypotheses===
History records many instances of unusual objects falling with the rain — in 2000, in an example of [[raining animals]], a small [[waterspout]] in the [[North Sea]] sucked up a school of [[fish]] a mile off shore, depositing them shortly afterwards on [[Great Yarmouth]] in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Lane | first = Megan | date = [[2000-08-07]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/869482.stm | title = It's raining fish! | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 2006-03-06}}</ref> Coloured rain is by no means rare, and can often be explained by the airborne transport of [[dust]] from [[desert]] or other dry regions which is washed down by rain. One such case occurred in [[England]] in 1903, when dust was carried from the [[Sahara]] and fell with rain in February of that year.<ref name="english_rain">Mill H. R., R. K. G. Lempfert, 1904,
''The great dust fall of February 1903 and its origin.'' Quart. J. Roy. Meteorol. Soc. 30:57.</ref>

At first, the red rain in Kerala was attributed to the same effect, with dust from the deserts of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] initially the suspect.<ref name="indiatoday"/> [[LIDAR]] observations had detected a cloud of dust in the atmosphere near Kerala in the days preceding the outbreak of the red rain.<ref name="Satyanarayana">{{ cite journal | last =Satyanarayana | first =M. | authorlink = | coauthors =Veerabuthiran S., Ramakrishna Rao D.

K.K. Sasidharan Pillai, a senior scientific assistant in the Indian Meteorological Department, proposed dust and acidic material from an eruption of [[Mayon Volcano]] in the [[Phillippines]] as an explanation for the coloured rain and the "burnt" leaves.<ref>{{cite news   | last = Varma  | first = M. Dinesh | title = Theory links 'scarlet rain' to Mayon volcano| work = | publisher = The Hindu

The Equatorial jet stream is unusual in that it flows from east to west at about 10° N,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/jetstreams_world.shtml}|title=Jet Streams around the World|publisher=BBC Weather Centre|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> approximately the same latitude as Kerala (8° N) and Mayon Volcano (13° N).

===Official report===
Initially the Centre for Earth Science Studies (CESS) had said that the cause of the red rain was an exploding meteor, which had dispersed about 1,000 kg (around one ton) of material. A few days later, when the red rain continued to fall, CESS retracted this. (Debris from a meteor would not have continued to fall in the same area; it would have been dispersed by winds.) CESS and the [[Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute]] (TBGRI) jointly issued a statement that the particles colouring the rainwater were some type of [[spore]].<ref name=notfungus>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Red rain was fungus, not meteor|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie20010806/nat10.html  |work= |publisher=Indian Express |date=Monday, August 6, 2001 |accessdate=2008-05-31 }}</ref>  Then in November of 2001, commissioned by the [[Government of India]]'s Department of Science & Technology, the CESS and TBGRI released a report<ref name=CESS/> which concluded that: <blockquote>
The colour was found to be due to the presence of a large amount of spores of a [[lichen]]-forming [[algae|alga]] belonging to the genus [[Trentepohlia]]. Field verification showed that the region had plenty of lichens. Samples of
lichen taken from Changanacherry, when cultured in an algal medium, also showed the presence of the same species of algae. Both samples (from rainwater and from trees) produced the same kind of algae, indicating that the spores seen in the rainwater could most probably have come from
local sources.
</blockquote> Although red or orange, ''Trentepohlia'' is a [[Chlorophyta|Chlorophyte]] green alga which can grow abundantly on tree bark or damp soil and rocks, but is also the photosynthetic [[symbiosis|symbiont]] or photobiont of many lichens, including some of those abundant on the trees in [[Changanacherry]] area.<ref name=CESS/> 

The report also stated that there was no dust of meteoric, volcanic, or desert origin present in the rainwater, and that the colour of the rainwater was not due to any dissolved gases or pollutants. The report concluded that heavy rains in Kerala in the weeks preceding the red rains could have caused the widespread growth of lichens, which had given rise to a large quantity of spores in the atmosphere. 

However, it could find no satisfactory explanation for the apparently extraordinary dispersal, nor for the uptake of the spores into clouds. It noted, for example, that prior to the first red rainfall there had been almost continuous rain for a period of eight hours. CESS responded ‘‘While the cause of the colour in the rainfall has been identified, finding the answers to these questions is a challenge.’’<ref name=notfungus/>

The conclusions in the CESS/TBGRI report were supported by Milton Wainwright at [[Sheffield University]], who has studied [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[spore]]s.<ref name="gentleman"/><ref name="tmcnet 2006">[http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/03/03/1427866.htm It's raining aliens] — transcript of a [[New Scientist]] [[podcast]] [http://www.newscientist.com/podcast.ns - get podcast here]" </ref>  In March 2006 he said the particles were similar in appearance to spores of a [[rust (fungus)|rust fungus]],<ref name="yorkshire">[http://www.yorkshiretoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=55&ArticleID=1375334 Is mysterious ‘red rain’ first evidence of life in space?] — [[Yorkshire Today]]</ref> later saying that he had confirmed their similarity to spores or algae, and found no evidence to suggest that the rain contained dust, sand, fat globules or blood.

===Extraterrestrial hypotheses===
{{see|Panspermia}}
Another hypothesis was proposed in 2003 by [[Godfrey Louis]] and [[Santhosh Kumar|A. Santhosh Kumar]], two scientists at [[Mahatma Gandhi University]] in [[Kottayam]], Kerala.  Having collected samples of the [[rainwater]] at many locations, Louis and Kumar claimed that the red particles did not look like dust but instead appeared to be biological cells. [[Chemical]] analyses indicate that they consist of [[organic material]], and so they proposed that the particles may be [[microbes]] of [[Outer space|extraterrestrial]] origin.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0601022 ''The red rain phenomenon of Kerala and its possible extraterrestrial origin''], Godfrey Louis, A. Santhosh Kumar, Astrophys.Space Sci. 302 (2006) 175-187]</ref>

Louis and Kumar performed tests with [[ethidium bromide]] in an attempt to detect any evidence of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] present in the red particles, but no such evidence was found. Their results were published in the journal ''[[Astrophysics and Space Science]]''.<ref name="L&K 2006" /> 
[[Image:RRR-003.jpg|thumb|right|Photomicrograph of particles from red rain sample]]

Louis suggests these microbes could be a prehistoric domain of life, or a [[Proto-Domain]].

A sample of the rain was also sent to [[Cardiff University]] for analysis by noted [[panspermia]] proponent [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]].  Wickramasinghe has reported on [[March 30]], [[2006]] that “work in progress has yielded [sic] positive for DNA”.<ref>[http://www.astrobiology.cf.ac.uk/redrain.html Cardiff Centre of Astrobiology: Analysis of red rain of Kerala]</ref> Since then Pat­rick Mc­Caf­ferty has published a study showing a correlation between historic reports of colored rains and of meteors.<ref>{{Citation

====Cometary origin hypothesis====
A few hours before the first occurrence of the red rain, a [[sonic boom]] was reported by residents of [[Changanasserry]] in Kottayam district, accompanied by a flash of light. Louis and Kumar suggest that this was caused by the disintegration of a small [[comet]] entering the Earth's atmosphere, and that this comet contained large quantities of the red particles.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310120 ''Cometary panspermia explains the red rain of Kerala''], Godfrey Louis, A. Santhosh Kumar, Astrophys.Space Sci.</ref> Observations show that 85% of the red rain fell within ten days of [[25 July]], and Louis and Kumar suggest that this is consistent with the settling of red particles released into the upper atmosphere by a cometary break-up.  However, this hypothesis could not explain certain aspects of the red rain, such as gradual decline over two months, and its localisation to Kerala despite atmospheric conditions that should have seen it occur in neighbouring states as well. Subsequent research by a different group of scientists concluded that the red particles were spores of the alga ''[[Trentepohlia]]'', but may simply be contamination from the lichens that grow abundantly in the region.<ref>Coloured Rain: A Report on the phenomenon http://www.geocities.com/iamgoddard/Sampath2001.pdf</ref>

Louis and Kumar further suggest that the particles are [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and thus represent evidence of extraterrestrial life. If the particles are biological in nature and did originate in a comet, it would be the first evidence in favour of the theory of [[panspermia]], in which life on Earth is proposed to have been carried here from elsewhere in the [[universe]]. [[Fred Hoyle]] and [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] have been among the proponents of the theory, but it has been dismissed by most mainstream scientists.

====Proto-domain hypothesis==== 
[[Image:FUtree.svg|left|thumbnail|250px|The newly hypothesized [[tree of life]].]] 
Proto-domain organisms are a hypothetical group of microorganisms acknowledged by some proponents of [[panspermia]], including Godfrey et al.<ref>http://arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0312/0312639.pdf</ref><ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/evolution/mg18925411.100 When aliens rained over India - evolution - 02 March 2006 - New Scientist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It is suggested that these hypothetical organisms might share many of the same abilities as terrestrial life on [[Earth]]: [[metabolism]], [[homeostasis]], [[organization]], [[growth]], [[adaptation]], [[reproduction]], and response to stimuli. However, unlike all life thus far discovered on earth, if the objects in red rain are proto-domain organisms they would appear to lack [[DNA]] as their informational [[macromolecule]].<ref>http://arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0312/0312639.pdf</ref><ref>[http://www.world-science.net/exclusives/060104_specksfrm1.htm Skepticism greets claim of possible alien microbes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1723913,00.html Red rain could prove that aliens have landed | World | The Observer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

To date, red rain represents the only supposed evidence of the existence of proto-domain organisms.  Proponents of the proto-domain theory argue that the fact that the "cells" in red rain lacked DNA is evidence that they could not have been algal spores. However, mainstream scientific opinion regards the existence of proto-domain organisms as at best a hypothesis and at worst as wild speculation.<ref>http://arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0312/0312639.pdf</ref><ref>[http://www.world-science.net/exclusives/060104_specksfrm1.htm Skepticism greets claim of possible alien microbes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1723913,00.html Red rain could prove that aliens have landed | World | The Observer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Critics also argue that the lack of DNA is not proof that these organisms are either prehistoric or extraterrestrial, noting, "further work in progress has yielded positive for DNA using [[DAPI]] staining in the cells and daughters."<ref>[http://whyfiles.org/shorties/207red_rain/ The Why Files | Red rain controversy: Aliens or hype?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This identification, however, is not yet fully confirmed, and might be considered equivocal.
===Controversy===
Milton Wainwright, who worked on the red particles in 2006 said, “There appears to be an increasing tendency among scientists to come up with wild explanations when asked by the press to comment on unusual, novel phenomena. A good example is provided by comments about the recent Indian red rain phenomenon.”<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025455.400.html 1 April 2006, New Scientist: Red rain fantasies]</ref> A correction was printed in ''The Observer''<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1729000,00.html For the record], ''[[The Observer]]'', [[March 12]], [[2006]]</ref> regarding Dr. Wainwright's comment that the red rain lacked DNA.  Dr. Wainwright asked in the correction to make clear that he currently had no view on whether the samples contained genetic material or not, and that it was physicist Godfrey Louis who held that view. The controversial research of Godfrey et al. is the only evidence suggesting that these organisms are of extraterrestrial origin.<ref>{{Citation

Sainudeen [[Pattazh]] came to the conclusion that, "Regarding red rain, there was an argument that it was alien presence. But that’s just like science fiction. During 2001-02, [a] peculiar geological situation was prevailing in Kerala like caving in of wells and landslides.” NASA named a minor planet after him in recognition of his environmental research in May 2008.<ref>[http://theviewspaper.net/science/2008/05/3137 The Viewspaper - 5178 Pattazhy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The shape of the particles can be explained by the formation of multi-phase  particles which on drying assume the shape of solid material seen in the red rain.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18925430.300-its-raining-blood.html It's raining blood] - [[March 18]], [[2006]], [[New Scientist]]</ref>
