In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[fantasy]] writings, '''Orcs''' or '''Orks''' are a race of creatures who are used as soldiers and henchmen by both the greater and lesser villains of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' &mdash; [[Morgoth]], [[Sauron]] and [[Saruman]]. The Orcs also work independently as the common antagonists in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', though [[Goblin]]s are of completely different race, Orcs are very similar.

Although not dim-witted and even crafty, they are portrayed as miserable beings, hating everyone including themselves and their masters, whom they serve out of fear. They make no beautiful things, but rather design cunning devices made to hurt and destroy.

==Tolkien's influences==
{{see also|Orc}}

"Orc" or "Ork" is an [[Old English]] word which appears in the epic ''[[Beowulf]]'' and refers to the [[undead]] monsters of [[Grendel]]'s race (''orc-néas'' "orc-corpses" ). Tolkien translated ''orc'' as "demon".<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#144}}</ref> 

In his later, post-''The Lord of the Rings'' writings (including ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and many essays published in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]])'', Tolkien preferred the spelling "Ork", evidently mainly to avoid the form ''Orcish'', which would be naturally pronounced with the c as /s/ instead of /k/ in English. Tolkien indeed used the adjective ''Orkish''. 

Tolkien stated that the goblins of ''The Hobbit'' were heavily influenced by ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' by [[George MacDonald]], a story he liked very much.

==Middle-earth terms for Orcs==
In the [[Calaquendi|High-elven]] tongue [[Quenya]], the word for "Orc" was ''urko'', pl. ''urqui'', meaning "bogey", or [[Boogeyman|"bogeyman"]], that is, something that provokes fear. In the [[Sindar|Grey-elven]] tongue [[Sindarin]], it was ''orch'', plural ''yrch''. In the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarven]] tongue [[Khuzdul]], it was ''rukhs'', plural ''rakhâs''.  In the language of the [[Drúedain]] or Wild Men, it was ''gorgûn''. In the [[Black Speech]] of [[Mordor]], the equivalent was ''Uruk'', as can be seen in ''[[Uruk-hai]]'', "Orc-folk". ''Orc'' itself is strictly from [[Rohirric]]. 

''Uruk'' and ''Uruk-hai'' were reserved for the larger Uruks themselves, and they called the smaller weaker ones ''snaga'', "slave". The Grey Elves also referred to the Orcs as a whole as the ''Glamhoth'', "noisy horde" (''Unfinished Tales'', "Of [[Tuor]] and his coming to [[Gondolin]]"). The word "[[goblin]]" is used to represent a term used by [[Hobbit]]s (see below). In ''The History of Middle-earth'' Tolkien muses about some Orcs being incarnate [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]]; these were called ''Boldogs'' (see below). 
 
===Orcs, Goblins, and Uruks===
<!-- Note: "Uruk-hai" is _plural_. "Uruks" is Anglicized and acceptable.-->
In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Tolkien used the word "[[goblin]]s" for Orcs, because he had not yet identified the world of ''The Hobbit'' with Middle-earth (which predated ''The Hobbit'' by several decades, in early writings which would later become ''The Silmarillion''). Fortunately Tolkien did include some references to his [[legendarium]] in the ''Hobbit'', which later allowed him to identify the lands of the ''Hobbit'' with his Middle-earth. The term "Orc" does occur, but only in an instance where Gandalf is trying to scare Bilbo by mentioning creatures of the wilderness and in the name of Thorin's sword, 'Orc-rist' ('goblin-cleaver').

In ''The Lord of the Rings'', "Orc" is used predominantly, and "goblin" mostly in the [[Hobbit]]s' speech.

As an example, a passage where the terms are used interchangeably goes: 
<blockquote>"There were four '''goblin-soldiers''' of greater stature, swart, slant-eyed, with thick legs and large hands. They were armed with short broad-bladed swords, not with the curved scimitars usual with '''Orcs''': and they had bows of yew, in length and shape like the bows of Men." 

<br />~"The Departure of Boromir", from ''[[The Two Towers]]''. The goblins described are Saruman's [[Uruk-hai]]. </blockquote>

This change can be seen story-externally as a part of the shift towards the use of Elvish words that occurred during the period between the writing of ''The Hobbit'' and the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Story-internally, it is a translation of the Hobbit term from the ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'', where Tolkien claimed to have translated his Middle-earth writings (a device also used by other authors).  

Thus, "Goblin" represents a term for Orcs used by Hobbits, sometimes picked up by Men and Elves (since English was not spoken, or rather had not yet developed, in Middle-earth).<ref>Middle-earth is a fictional version of the prehistoric Earth.</ref>

The original edition of ''The Hobbit'' and early drafts of ''The Lord of the Rings'' first used "goblin" everywhere and used "[[Hobgoblin (fairy)|hobgoblin]]" for larger, more evil goblins: when "goblin" and "goblins" were replaced with "Orc" and "Orcs", Tolkien invented the terms [[Uruk-hai|"Uruks" and "Uruk-hai"]] for his stronger Orcs.

Treatments of the material in other media has sometimes gone beyond what Tolkien intended by making Goblins distinct from Orcs. This can be seen in the real-time strategy games ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]''. In the former, Goblins can be used alongside common Orcs and Uruk-hai, while in the latter  Goblins get their own playable faction.

==The physical appearance of Orcs==

Orcs are described as ugly and filthy fanged humanoids. Their height varies from human-sized to shorter. Many have long arms, like monkeys or apes. Along with that, many of them have crooked backs and legs. They have sour black blood, reminiscent of reanimated corpses.

Tolkien describes Orcs explicitly in one of his ''Letters'':

<blockquote>''...they are (or were) squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes; in fact degraded and repulsive versions of the (to Europeans) least lovely Mongol-types.''
<br/>
— ''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', #210. </blockquote>

In response to charges that the above comment is [[racist]], [[Tolkien fandom|Tolkienist]] [[Steuard Jensen]] writes in his ''Tolkien Newsgroups FAQ'' ([http://tolkien.slimy.com/faq/External.html#Racist]) :

<blockquote>''At first glance this looks blatantly racist, but the qualifier '''"to Europeans"''' casts it in a very different light: Tolkien explicitly recognized that different cultures have different standards of beauty, and that his impressions did not reflect any underlying superiority. Moreover, he made it clear that the Orcs were not in any sense actual "Mongol-types", but "degraded and repulsive versions" of humanoid stock. (Nevertheless, his comment certainly falls short of modern standards of sensitivity.)'' (Bolding made by editors)
</blockquote>
Fellow Tolkienist [[Michael Martinez]] writes in ''Parma Endorion'', his guide to Middle-earth, that he feels that Tolkien may have based the Orcs on the [[Huns]], in the sense of their "historical context" within Middle-earth. This should not be surprising since he based his writings on a Western viewpoint and the Mongol Empire did reach Europe. 

Even so, many white supremacists praise ''The Lord of the Rings'' for portraying white western Europeans as "good" and ugly dark-skinned non-whites as "bad". [http://www.stormfront.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=63]. Jensen continues in his ''FAQ'':

<blockquote>''Finally, a few people have mistaken the symbolic conflict between "darkness" and "light" in the books for a conflict between "black" and "white", which they then interpret racially (which is already a stretch). They seem to overlook the ghastly white corpse-light of [[Minas Morgul]], the [[White Hand]] of [[Saruman]], and [[Isildur]]'s black Stone of [[Erech (Middle-earth)|Erech]], to name a few exceptions.''
<br/>
<br/>
''As for specific claims that Tolkien linked skin color to good and evil, there are simply too many exceptions for that to hold up. Light skinned characters who did evil things include Saruman, [[Grima]], [[Gollum]], [[Boromir]], [[Denethor]], and the [[Númenor|Númenóreans]] as mentioned above. And it is notable that Tolkien described [[Lossarnach|Forlong]]'s people of [[Gondor]]'' (reinforcements who come to [[Minas Tirith]] in '''''The Return of the King''''' — eds.) ''and even the men of Bree as "swarthy", the same term he used for example of the [[Southrons]] who were ambushed by [[Faramir]] (though to be fair, he may have imagined different degrees of "swarthiness" for those groups). For that matter, Sam's flash of empathy for the fallen [[Haradrim|Southron]] he saw during the ambush'' (in [[Ithilien]] in '''''The Two Towers''''' — eds.) ''indicates that many of Sauron's soldiers were likely unwilling slaves, not evil at heart.''
<br/>
<br/>
''In short, while there are racially "suspicious" elements to be found in Tolkien's writings if one hunts for them, closer examination typically reveals the attitude behind them to be benign. That doesn't mean that he was perfect, but it certainly doesn't seem that he should be condemned for intolerance.''</blockquote>

As Tolkien himself said of racism:
<blockquote>"I should regret giving any colour to the notion that I subscribed to the wholly pernicious and unscientific race-doctrine." 
<br/>
— ''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', #29. </blockquote>

==Types of Orcs==
There was much variation among Orcs. The most obvious examples are the ''Uruk-hai'', who were larger, more powerful and have black skin.  Another variantion are ''snaga'', who are smaller and less strong than Uruk-hai.   There was also some variation in terms of function. Sauron apparently bred specialized types, such as the "super-soldier" Uruk-hai, and smaller, tracker Orcs or 'Snufflers' (one of which appears in ''The Return of the King'', paired with an Uruk of Mordor, searching for the hobbits). The Uruk-hai of Saruman were also physically different from the Uruk-hai of Sauron; they were taller and had more human-like proportions while the latter were shorter and had longer arms (as shown by Uglúk and Grishnákh in ''The Two Towers''). In ''The History of Middle-earth'' Tolkien mentions [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]] incarnate in Orc-bodies called ''Boldogs'' (see below).  

Saruman apparently bred his own modified orcs.  Tolkien wrote of Saruman creating ''Men-orcs'' and ''Orc-men'' in Myths Revisited.  There has been speculation that these Uruk-hai were cross-breed with [[Dunland|swarthy men]], and these could withstand the sunlight.  However, this has never been stated directly.  The Orc-men, also called ''Half-orcs'' and ''Goblin men'', were definitely crossbreeds.  They were described as looking more human than orcs.        

In terms of "political factions", the Orcs served [[Morgoth]] in [[Angband (Middle-earth)|Angband]] and subsequently [[Sauron]] in [[Mordor]]. By the time of the War of the Ring, some served [[Saruman]] in [[Isengard]]. However, as Sauron laid low after losing the Ring at the end of the [[Second Age]] (before returning to Mordor), some Orcs must have worked independently. Before and during the time when ''The Hobbit'' takes place, some Orcs had [[Mount Gundabad]] as their capital, the Orcs of the [[Misty Mountains]] were apparently ruled by one "Great Goblin", the former Dwarf-realm of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] was held by Orcs under one [[List of Middle-earth Orcs#Azog|Azog]] and then his son Bolg, and one Golfimbul had led the Orcs of [[Mount Gram]] in a foray into the Shire.

==Orkish culture==
Tolkien does not elaborate much on Orc culture and customs. However, we do know that Orcs know some form of healing arts (as the Orc-band apply harsh Orkish medicine to Merry's injuries while in their captivity). We also know that their armour, though inferior to that of Elves and Dwarves, is serviceable enough. Also, they often use [[poison|poisoned]] blades (as [[Aragorn]] states as he inspects a wound of [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]; the wound is fortunately not poisoned) and arrows (as they use such on [[Isildur]]). Also, they like to sing horrible songs (as in ''The Hobbit'').

In regards to Orc [[ecology]], orcs are highly [[xenophobic]], and will quickly attempt to kill anyone who enters their territory. Their leaders are not fools, however, and will lie in wait, observing an enemy before striking. This is particularly shown in the films.

===Orkish diet===
[[Image:orccannibalism.jpg|thumb|right|Orc [[cannibalism]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]''.]]
Orcs eat all manner of flesh, including those of men and horses, except perhaps their own. In Chapter II of ''The Two Towers'', Grishnákh, leader of the Mordor Uruks, accuses the Uruks of Saruman (who look different from them) of [[cannibalism|eating Orc-flesh]], which the latter angrily deny. Later [[List of Middle-earth Orcs#Shagrat|Shagrat]] of [[Cirith Ungol]] threatens to "eat" a disobedient ''[[List of Middle-earth Orcs#Snaga|snaga]]'' (smaller Orc), although this could be simply an emotional or symbolic threat. 

Rather than simply being hinted, however, Orkish cannibalism is displayed outright in the [[Peter Jackson]] interpretation, when Uglúk, leader of the Isengard Uruks (after [[List of original characters in the Lord of the Rings film trilogy#Lurtz|Lurtz]]'s death) kills a disobedient Orc (who wanted to eat [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] against the order of [[Saruman]]) and announces: "Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!".

==Orkish language==
The Orcs had no language of their own; merely a piecemeal of corrupted versions of words derived from various languages (an insult to a [[linguistics|linguist]] like Tolkien). However, individual tribes developed dialects that were so widely different from each other that the Orkish tongue was of no use for communication between tribes; for this purpose, [[Westron]] was used, albeit with a crude accent.  The few words in common usage throughout Orc tribes extant in the text of ''The Lord of the Rings'' are from [[Black Speech]]; some examples are ''ghâsh'', "fire", ''sharkǔ'', "old man" (referring to Saruman's nickname of "Sharkey" during The Scouring of the Shire), ''snaga'', "slave", and ''Uruk''. Another "Orkish" word is ''tark'', "man of Gondor", from Westron and ultimately Quenya ''tarkil'', "high man".

When Sauron returned to power in Mordor in the Third Age, [[Black Speech]] was used by the captains of his armies and by his servants in Barad-dûr.

A substantial sample of debased Black Speech/Orkish can be found in ''The Two Towers'', where the Mordor Uruk Grishnákh curses the Isengard Uruk Uglúk:

:''Uglúk u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob búbhosh skai!''

In ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'',  Tolkien gives the translation: "Uglúk to the cesspool, sha! the dungfilth; the great Saruman-fool, skai!". However, in a note published in the Tolkien scholarly linguistic journal ''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'' this alternative translation is given: "Uglúk to the dung-pit with stinking Saruman-filth, pig-guts, gah!"

==Historical notes==
On the subject of orcish tendencies to good and evil, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' states of the [[Last Alliance]] at the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] and the subsequent siege of [[Barad-dûr]] that "All living things were divided in that day, and some of every kind, even of beasts and birds, were found in either host, save the Elves only. They alone were undivided and followed Gil-galad. Of the Dwarves, few fought upon either side; but the kindred of Durin of Moria fought against Sauron." ("[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]") Since the Elves alone were said to be undivided, this apparently implies that at least some Orcs fought ''against'' Sauron, though this may be an overliteral interpretation of the passage. On the subject of orc redeemability Tolkien wrote in one of his letters "I nearly wrote 'irredeemably bad'; but that would be going too far. Because by accepting or tolerating their making - necessary to their actual existence - even Orcs would become part of the World, which is God's and ultimately good. That God would 'tolerate' that, seems no worse theology than the toleration of the calculated dehumanizing of Men by tyrants that goes on today."

To some extent Tolkien did not regard Orcs as inherently evil, or evil in their own right, but rather as tools and slaves of Morgoth and Sauron, hating themselves and their masters as they hated everyone else. He wrote once that "we were all orcs in the [[World War I|Great War]]".{{ME-fact}}

==The origin of Orcs== 
The origin of Orcs is an open question. In Tolkien's writings, evil is not capable of independent creation, making it unlikely that the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Vala]] [[Morgoth]], who was obviously the first to produce them, could do that ''[[ex nihilo]]''.  

Unlike the ''orc-néas'' ('orc-corpses') of Beowulf, no female Orcs are ever mentioned by Tolkien in any publication. However, in the published ''Silmarillion'' it is stated that Orcs "breed after the manner of Elves and Men", implying that there are; in ''The Hobbit'' the Orc Bolg is the son of one Azog, while Gollum is described as having eaten a young Orc child ("goblin-imp") shortly before he first met Bilbo. Tolkien confirms in a letter that female Orcs did exist<ref>Unpublished letter dated 21 October 1963 to Mrs Munby</ref>.

===Made from the earth===

According to the oldest "theory" proposed by Tolkien (found in ''The Fall of [[Gondolin]]'', from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', circa [[1917]] — the first tale of Middle-earth to be written in full), Orcs were made of stone and slime through the sorcery of Morgoth (''"bred from the heats and slimes of the earth"'' — ''The Book of Lost Tales, Vol. 2'').

===Corrupted Elves===
Tolkien later changed the legendarium so that Morgoth could no longer produce life on his own, and amended the origins to the "theory" that would eventually be published in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'': that the Orcs were transformed from [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] &mdash; the purest form of life on [[Arda]] (the Earth) &mdash; by means of torture and mutilation; and this "theory" would then become the most popular. Moreover, if Orcs were in fact Elves at their core, this could perhaps mean that they were also [[Immortality|immortal]] &mdash; a fact which, if true, would seem inconsistent with J. R. R Tolkien's treatment of Orcs, although the books do not openly confirm or deny it. If Orcs indeed were immortal, it holds no doubt that their [[Fëa and hröa|''fëar'']] would not be allowed reincarnation by [[Mandos]], if they even answered the calling. Most Orcs would probably fear the calling of Mandos, and therefore would see their ''fëar'' diminished to [[evil]] spirits. These may have been some of the evil spirits occasionally described in the books, such as the spirit which tempted [[Gorlim]] of [[Barahir]]'s company, or the [[Barrow-wight]]s. There is some evidence for the immortality, or otherwise long life of Orcs in ''[[The Two Towers (book)|The Two Towers]]'': [[Gorbag#Gorbag|Gorbag]] and [[Orc (Middle-earth)#Shagrat|Shagrat]], during the conversation which [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] overheard, mention the "Great Siege" of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]]. It is possible to interpret from the sentence that they were actually there and remembered it themselves: an event which lay millennia in the past.  Another interpretation of this conversation is that this "Great Siege" could have instead been merely the current siege ongoing at [[Minas Tirith]], or the siege of [[Minas Morgul]].  They certainly did live for at the very least hundreds of years, since Bolg was the son of Azog and his death occurred over 140 years after the death of his father.  This second theory is consistent with a statement made in the "Myths Transformed" essay of ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'' that the orcs had short lifespans in relation to the [[Númenórean]]s. The published ''Silmarillion'' states also that the Orcs reproduce after the manner of the Children of Ilúvatar (i.e. Men and Elves).  In the ''Hobbit,'' Gollum remembers killing and eating a "small goblin-imp," which probably refers to a baby or child goblin.

Since this version of the origin of Orcs explicitly appears in the published ''Silmarillion'', many have accepted it at face value as Tolkien's final views on the matter. However, as can be seen, Tolkien wrote later differing accounts, which may reflect his final intentions (see [[Middle-earth canon]]).

===Fallen Maiar===
There are hints in the ''[[The History of Middle-earth|History of Middle-earth]]'' series of books, (especially in ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'' in the section "Myths Transformed"), that some Orc leaders, such as the [[First Age]]'s [[Boldog]], or the [[Great Goblin]] encountered by [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], may in fact have been fallen [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]] which had taken Orc form:

: ''Some of these things may have been delusions and phantoms but some were no doubt shapes taken by the servants of Melkor, mocking and degrading the very forms of the children. For Melkor had in his service great numbers of Maiar, who had the power, as their Master, of taking visible and tangible shape in Arda.''  (''Morgoth's Ring'', "Myths transformed", text X)

: ''Boldog (…) is a name that occurs many times in the tales of the War. But it is possible that Boldog was not a personal name, and either a title, or else the name of a kind of creature: the Orc-formed Maiar, only less formidable than the Balrogs'' (Author's footnote to the text X)

: ''Melkor had corrupted many spirits - some great as [[Sauron]], or less as Balrogs. The least could have been primitive Orcs.'' (Author's note to text)

===Some cross-bred with Men===
Tolkien also "suggested" that [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] were cross-bred with Orcs under Morgoth's lieutenant, Sauron (and possibly under Morgoth himself). The fierce Orcs known as [[Uruk-hai]] were created in this way. The process was later repeated during the [[War of the Ring]] by Saruman, enabling him to make his own Uruks.

:''There is no doubt that long afterwards, in the Third Age, Saruman rediscovered this, or learned of it in lore, and in his lust for mastery committed this, his wickedest deed: the interbreeding of Orcs and Men, producing both Men-orcs large and cunning, and Orc-men treacherous and vile.'' (''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', "Myths Transformed" - Text X)

While Tolkien at some point saw all Orcs as descended from tortured Elves, later comments of his indicate, according to [[Christopher Tolkien]] in ''Morgoth's Ring'' ("Myths Transformed, text X"), that he began to feel uncomfortable with this theory. At about the same time he removed the references to the [[Thrall-Ñoldorin]], he also began searching for a new origin for the Orcs. The question of Orc origin may have been one of the problems Tolkien tried to solve by completely changing the [[cosmology]] and [[prehistory]] of Arda. By setting the origin of Men back to almost the same time as the Elves, he possibly allowed for Men to be the origin of Orcs all along. Tolkien died before he could complete this upheaval of the cosmology, however, so the Elf origin was adopted in the published version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

===Sentient beasts=== 
Yet other of Tolkien's theories proposes that Orcs may have begun as animals of vaguely humanoid shapes, empowered by the [[will (philosophy)|will]] of the [[Dark Lord]] (first Morgoth, later Sauron):

: ''The Orcs were beasts of humanized shape (…).'' ('Morgoth's Ring', "Myths transformed", text VIII') 

It is certain all Orcs were dependent on the Dark Lord in various ways: after their leader was defeated, the Orcs were confused and dismayed, and easily scattered by their enemies. In the millennia after Morgoth's defeat and banishment from [[Arda]], they were without a leader, and degenerated to small, quarrelsome tribes hiding in the [[Misty Mountains]]. Only when Sauron returned to power did they begin to reclaim some of their old power. The same happened after Sauron's defeat by the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]]: only when Sauron returned as the Necromancer of [[Mirkwood]] did the Orcs become a real danger for Middle-earth again.

== Individual Orcs ==

{{See also|List of original characters in the Lord of the Rings film trilogy}} ''for Orcs unique to the New Line films''

==Influence on later fantasy==

Tolkien's Orcs have indisputably been a major influence on fantasy fiction and games; they are the literary precursors of the Orcs (and similar races) of many different settings like ''[[Warhammer Fantasy]]'', ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' and ''[[Warcraft]]''. The Orcs of the above-mentioned games most often differ from Tolkien's Orcs in that they are taller and larger than humans and usually have green or greyish-green skin (in the case of the ''Warcraft'' Orcs, they even become the protagonists in the third game, redeeming themselves from the pact they made with the Burning Legion).

[[C. S. Lewis]] may have inserted a nod to his friend's Orcs in ''[[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]''. When Aslan goes to his death on the Stone Table, the narrator mentions various evil creatures gathered around the White Witch — including "Orknies" (the name is also directly based on the above Old English term).
