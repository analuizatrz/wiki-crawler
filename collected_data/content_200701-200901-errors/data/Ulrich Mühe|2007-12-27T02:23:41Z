'''Friedrich Hans Ulrich Mühe''' (pronounced {{IPA2|ˈʊlʁɪç ˈmyːə}}) ([[20 June]] [[1953]] – [[22 July]] [[2007]]) was a [[Germany|German]] film, television and theatre [[actor]]. He played the role of [[Hauptmann]] (Captain) Gerd Wiesler in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[The Lives of Others|Das Leben der Anderen]]'' (''The Lives of Others'', 2006), for which he received the award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, Gold, at Germany's most prestigious film awards, the ''[[Deutscher Filmpreis]]'' (German Film Awards); and the Best Actor Award at the 2006 [[European Film Awards]].

Curiously, events in Mühe's life were mirrored by the plot of the film, as he discovered in a [[Ministerium für Staatssicherheit (GDR)|Stasi]] file compiled on him that he had been under surveillance by his second wife, Jenny Gröllmann. This was denied by Gröllmann who, after an acrimonious and highly-publicized court case, succeeded in obtaining an injunction to prevent Mühe from repeating the allegation in a book.

After leaving school, Mühe was employed as a construction worker and a border guard at the [[Berlin Wall]]. He then turned to acting, and from the late 1970s into the 1980s appeared in numerous plays, becoming a star of the [[Deutsches Theater]] in [[East Berlin]]. He was active in politics and denounced [[Communism|Communist]] rule in [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] in a memorable address at [[Alexanderplatz]] on [[4 November]] [[1989]] shortly before the [[Berlin Wall#The Fall, 1989|fall of the Berlin Wall]]. After [[German reunification]] he continued to appear in a large number of films, television programmes and theatre productions. In Germany he was particularly known for playing the lead role of Dr. Robert Kolmaar in the long-running forensic crime series ''Der letzte Zeuge'' (''The Last Witness'', 1998–present).

==Biography==
The son of a [[furrier]],<ref>Mühe's older brother Andreas took over the family's furrier business: {{cite web|title=Biography for Ulrich Mühe|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0618057/bio|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] (IMDb)|accessdate=2007-08-05}} However, according to an obituary in ''[[The Independent]]'' published on [[26 July]] [[2007]], Mühe's father was a [[Tanning|tanner]]: see {{cite news|title=Ulrich Mühe : Star of 'The Lives of Others' (obituary)|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2802598.ece|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=[[2007-07-26]]}}</ref> Mühe was born on [[20 June]] [[1953]] in [[Grimma]],<ref>In 2007, shortly before his death, Mühe was conferred honorary citizenship of Grimma: {{cite web|title=Biography for Ulrich Mühe|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0618057/bio|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] (IMDb)|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> [[Saxony]], in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany).

[[Image:Volksbühne1999_gobeirne.jpg|thumb|The [[Volksbühne]] in [[Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz]] in the borough of [[Mitte]], [[Berlin]], photographed in July 1999.]]

Subsequently, between 1975<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last=Bergan|first=Ronald|title=Ulrich Mühe (obituary)|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,2136670,00.html|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[2007-07-28]]}}</ref> and 1979 he studied acting at the Hans Otto Theaterhochschule in [[Leipzig]], and in 1979 he appeared in his first professional stage role as Lyngstrand in [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s ''Fruen fra havet'' (''[[The Lady from the Sea]]'') at the Städtlisches Theater in Karl-Marx-Stadt (now [[Chemnitz]]). He followed this by appearing in a production of ''[[Macbeth]]'' by playwright and director [[Heiner Müller]] at the [[Volksbühne]] in [[East Berlin]].<ref name="Telegraph"/>

In 1983 at Müller's invitation he joined the ensemble of East Berlin's [[Deutsches Theater]], and became its star due to his versatility in comic and serious roles, appearing in productions such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Egmont (play)|Egmont]]'' (1986), Ibsen's ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]'s ''[[Nathan the Wise|Nathan der Weise]]'' (''Nathan the Wise'', 1988).<ref name="Deutsche Welle"/> He took the lead role of [[Hamlet]] in both [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s play and Heiner Müller's ''[[Hamletmachine|Die Hamletmaschine]]'' (''Hamletmachine'', 1989).<ref name="Guardian"/> Mühe later said: "Theatre was the only place in the GDR where people weren't lied to. For us actors it was an island. We could dare to criticise."<ref name="Independent Obituary">{{cite news|title=Ulrich Mühe : Star of 'The Lives of Others' (obituary)|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2802598.ece|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=[[2007-07-26]]}}</ref> On screen, he co-starred with his second wife Jenny Gröllmann in Herman Zschoche's film ''Hälfte des Lebens'' (''Half of Life'', 1984) about the German [[Lyric poetry|lyric poet]] [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] (1770–1843).<ref name="Telegraph"/>

Mühe played a leading role in organizing the demonstrations that took place prior to the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. He often gave public readings from Walter Jenka's essay ''Schwierigkeiten mit der Wahrheit'' (''Difficulties with the Truth'', 1989) at the Deutsches Theater, before the book was permitted to be published in East Germany. On [[4 November]] [[1989]] shortly before the [[Berlin Wall#The Fall, 1989|fall of the Berlin Wall]], in front of half a million people at [[Alexanderplatz]], he declared the [[Communism|Communists]]' monopoly on power to be invalid.<ref name="Deutsche Welle"/> In the same year he became internationally known after appearing in [[Bernhard Wicki]]'s ''Das Spinnennetz'' (''The Spider's Web'', based on the novel of the same name by Austrian writer [[Joseph Roth]]) as a right-wing lieutenant who sleeps and murders his way to professional success in the early [[Weimar Republic]] following a near fatal injury during the [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny]] of [[29 October]] [[1918]].<ref name="Telegraph"/>

Mühe appeared in many other films, television series and plays in Germany and abroad. He proved his ability to take on comic roles in ''[[Schtonk!]]'' (1991), an Oscar-nominated satire about the [[Hitler Diaries]] hoax,<ref>{{cite news|title=Ulrich Mühe : German Actor who Won Acclaim Playing a Stasi Officer in the Oscar-winning ''The Lives of Others'' (obituary)|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2155356.ece|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[2007-07-28]]}}</ref> and showed his more serious side in [[Michael Haneke]]'s ''[[Benny's Video]]'' (1992), ''Das Schloss'' (''The Castle'', 1996) (an adaptation of [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]'s ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'' (1922)) and ''[[Funny Games (1997 film)|Funny Games]]'' (1997).<ref name="Guardian"/><ref name="Independent Obituary"/> In the latter film, Mühe and his third wife Suzanne Lothar played a husband and wife held captive in their holiday cabin by two psychotic young men who force them to play sadistic "games" with one another.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

In recent years Mühe played a series of [[Nazism|Nazis]]. He portrayed [[Joseph Goebbels]] in ''Goebbels und Geduldig'' (''Goebbels and Geduldig'', 2001); Dr. [[Josef Mengele]] in ''[[Amen. (film)|Amen.]]'' (2002), a film by [[Costa Gavras]]; and was to have played [[Klaus Barbie]] in an upcoming feature. His last film was the comedy ''[[Mein Führer – Die wirklich wahrste Wahrheit über Adolf Hitler]]'' (''My Führer: The Truly Truest Truth about Adolf Hitler'', 2007), in which he played Prof. Adolf Israel Grünbaum, an actor hired to give Hitler lessons.<ref name="Guardian"/>

In 2006 he appeared at the [[Barbican Arts Centre]] in London in ''Zerbombt'', Thomas Ostermeier's German production of [[Sarah Kane]]'s ''[[Blasted]]'', playing a middle-aged journalist whose encounter with a young girl leads to pandemonium in a [[Leeds]] hotel room.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

Mühe was also well-known in Germany for playing the brilliant but eccentric pathologist Dr. Robert Kolmaar in 73 episodes of the forensic crime serial ''Der letzte Zeuge'' (''The Last Witness'', 1998–2007),<ref name="Guardian"/><ref name="Independent Obituary"/> for which he was awarded the prize for ''Beste/r Schauspieler/in in einer Serie'' (Best Actor or Actress in a TV Series) at the ''Deutscher Fernsehpreis'' (German Television Awards) in 2005.

However, to English-speaking audiences, Mühe was probably best known for portraying [[Hauptmann]] (Captain) Gerd Wiesler in [[Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck]]'s ''[[The Lives of Others|Das Leben der Anderen]]'' (''The Lives of Others'', 2006), which won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2007. The film is set in the mid-1980s, and Wiesler is a [[Ministerium für Staatssicherheit (GDR)|Stasi]] agent who is assigned to bug and conduct surveillance of the apartment of an East German playwright, Georg Dreyman ([[Sebastian Koch]]), and his girlfriend, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland ([[Martina Gedeck]]). However, he becomes disillusioned about the necessity of monitoring the couple for national security reasons after discovering that the government minister who ordered the surveillance did so for sexual rather than political motives. Gradually, Wiesler's heart moves from contempt and envy to compassion.<ref name="Telegraph"/> For his performance, in 2006 Mühe received, among other things, the ''Beste darstellerische Leistung – Männliche Hauptrolle'' (Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role), Gold, at Germany's most prestigious film awards, the ''[[Deutscher Filmpreis]]'' (German Film Awards); and the Best Actor Award at the [[European Film Awards]].

Stiftung Aufarbeitung, the government-funded organization tasked with examining and reappraising East Germany's Communist dictatorship, said of Mühe: "Through his impressive performance... Ulrich Mühe sensitized an audience of millions to the Stasi's machinations and their consequences." The statement added that Mühe had been an active and valued participant in the foundation's events.<ref name="Deutsche Welle"/>

Mühe was already seriously ill at the prize-giving ceremony in Los Angeles in April 2007 when ''Das Leben der Anderen'' was awarded its Oscar, and flew back to Germany hours later for an urgent stomach operation.<ref name="Independent"/> In an article in ''[[Die Welt]]'' dated [[21 July]] [[2007]], Mühe discussed his diagnosis of [[stomach cancer]] which had put his acting career on hold; he died the following day.<ref name=CNN>{{cite news|title=Oscar Film's German Star Dies|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/07/25/german.actor.reut/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=[[2007-07-25]]}}</ref> On [[25 July]] [[2007]] he was buried in his mother's village of [[Walbeck, Börde|Walbeck]] in the ''[[List of rural districts of Germany|Landkreis]]'' (rural district) of [[Börde]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ulrich Mühe am Mittwoch beigesetzt|url=http://www.ad-hoc-news.de/Aktuelle-Nachrichten/de/12640566/(%DCbersicht-Neu-Beerdigung)-Zeitung-Ulrich-M%FChe-am|publisher=Ad-Hoc News|date=[[2007-07-25]]}} In German.</ref>

==Personal life==
[[Image:Liebeingedanken 02.jpg|thumb|150px|Mühe's daughter [[Anna Maria Mühe|Anna Maria]], with actor [[Daniel Brühl]] at the première of their film ''Was nützt die Liebe in Gedanken'' (''[[Love in Thoughts]]'', 2004).]]

Mühe was married three times. He was first married to [[dramaturge]] Annegret Hahn and had two sons by her: Andreas, a Berlin-based photographer, and Konrad, a painter. His second marriage was in 1984 to the actress Jenny Gröllmann, after they fell in love while acting together<ref name="Telegraph"/> in the TV film ''Die Poggenpuhls'' (''The Poggenpuhls'') in that year. Mühe and Gröllmann had a daughter, [[Anna Maria Mühe]], who is also an actress, and he was stepfather to Gröllmann's daughter Jeanne, a [[make-up artist]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography for Ulrich Mühe|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0618057/bio|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] (IMDb)|accessdate=2007-11-23}} See {{imdb name|0344949|Jeanne Gröllmann}} Retrieved on [[23 November]] [[2007]].</ref>

After German reunification, Mühe discovered evidence in his Stasi file that he had been under surveillance not only by four of his fellow actors in the East Berlin theatre, but also by his wife Gröllmann. The file held detailed records of meetings that Gröllmann, who was allegedly an "''Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter''" (unofficial collaborator), had with her controller from 1979 to 1989.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ulrich Mühe 1953-2007 : The Actor who Played the Conscience-Stricken Stasi in The Lives of Others has Died|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/07/ulrich_muehe_19532007.html|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[2007-07-25]]}}</ref> This mirrored the plot of ''Das Leben der Anderen'' as in the film pressure exerted by the Stasi on the playwright's girlfriend makes her betray him as the author of an ''exposé'' of covered-up GDR suicide rates. Mühe and Gröllmann divorced in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography for Ulrich Mühe|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0618057/bio|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] (IMDb)|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> In a book accompanying the film, Mühe spoke about the sense of betrayal he felt when he found out about his former wife's alleged Stasi role. However, Gröllmann's real-life controller later claimed he had made up many of the details in the file and that the actress had been unaware that she was speaking to a Stasi agent. After a highly public and acrimonious battle in the courts, Gröllmann, who died in August 2006, won an injunction preventing the book's publication.<ref name="Telegraph"/> Mühe's response when asked how he prepared for his role in ''Das Leben der Anderen'' was, "I remembered."<ref name="Telegraph"/><ref name="Deutsche Welle"/>

At the time of Mühe's death, he was married to his third wife, stage actress Susanne Lothar, and living in [[Berlin]] with her and their two children, Sophie Marie and Jakob.<ref name="CNN"/>
