'''Richard Hunt''' ([[August 16]], [[1951]] - [[January 7]] [[1992]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[puppeteer]] from [[Closter, New Jersey]] best known for his association with [[The Muppets]]. His Muppet characters included [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem|Janice]], [[Beaker (muppet)|Beaker]], [[Statler & Waldorf|Statler]], and [[Sweetums]] He also shared [[Miss Piggy]] with [[Frank Oz]] until Season 2 of [[The Muppet Show]]. He also performed many characters on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', including [[Forgetful Jones]], [[Placido Flamingo]], [[Don Music]], and an early [[Elmo]].  

Following Hunt's death from [[AIDS]] (which he had kept private), the role of [[Beaker (muppet)|Beaker]] was inherited by [[Steve Whitmire]], that of Statler by [[Jerry Nelson]] until his retirement which Whitmire took over, that of [[Sweetums]] by [[John Henson (Muppet performer)|John Henson]], and those of [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]] and [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Janice|Janice]] by [[Brian Henson]]; Scooter's most recent performer is [[Rickey Boyd]]. ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' was dedicated to Hunt and [[Jim Henson]].

[[Jon Stone]], director of ''Sesame Street'', said this at the time of Hunt's unexpected death: "It’s impossible to imagine a world without Richard. He came to us a wide-eyed eighteen year old and grew into a master puppeteer and inspired teacher. No one ever had a more manic love of the outrageous and absurd; no one could ever make me laugh the way Richard could. A generation has grown up absorbing Richard’s art, and I have to believe that every one of them is a smarter, funnier, stronger, sillier, more generous person because of him." <ref> [http://rhuntfan.tripod.com/ Your Face!] </ref>
