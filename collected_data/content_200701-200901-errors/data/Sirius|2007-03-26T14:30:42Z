'''Sirius''' (α CMa / α Canis Majoris / [[alpha (letter)|Alpha]] Canis Majoris) ({{IPA2|ˈsɪ.ɹi.əs}}) is the [[list of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night-time sky, with a visual [[apparent magnitude]] of &minus;1.47. It is located in the [[constellation]] [[Canis Major]]. Sirius can be seen from almost every inhabited region of the [[Earth]]'s surface ([[Northernmost settlements|those living north of 73.284 degrees]] cannot see it) and, in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], is known as a [[vertex]] of the [[Winter Triangle]]. The best time of year to view it is around [[January 1]], when it reaches the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] at midnight.

Under the right conditions, Sirius can be observed in daylight with the naked eye. Ideally the sky must be very clear, with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the sun low down on the horizon.<ref>{{cite journal | author=C. Henshaw | title=On the Visibility of Sirius in Daylight | journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association | year=1984 | volume=94 | issue=5 | pages=221-222 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984JBAA...94..221H }}</ref>

What to the eye appears as a single star is actually a [[binary star]] system, consisting of a bright white [[main sequence]] star of [[spectral type]] A0 or A1, named '''Sirius A''', and a faint [[white dwarf]] companion, named '''Sirius B'''.

==Etymology==
The name of this star comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Sīrius'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Σείριος'' (''Seirios'', "glowing" or "scorcher"). As the major star of the "Big Dog" constellation, it is often called the "[[Dog]] Star".

The [[Latin language|Latin]] name for this star is '''Canicula''' ("little dog") and in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''{{Unicode|الشعرى}}''' ''aš-ši‘rā'' in  [[Islamic astronomy]], from which the alternate name '''Al Shira''' derives.

In [[Sanskrit]], it is known as '''Mrgavyadha''' ("deer hunter") or '''Lubdhaka''' ("hunter"). As Mrgavyadha, the star represents [[Shiva]].

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] the star is known as star of '''celestial wolf''' ({{CJKV|t=天狼|s=天狼|j=天狼|k=천랑}}; [[Pinyin|Chinese romanization]]: Tiānláng; [[Romanization of Japanese|Japanese romanization]]: Tenrō; [[Korean romanization]]: Cheonlang) in [[Well (Chinese constellation)|Mansion of Jǐng]] (井宿), while Japanese vernacular name of the star is '''{{Unicode|青星}}''' ('''Aoboshi''', "blue star").

In Scandinavia, the star has been known as 'Lokabrenna' ('burning done by Loki', or 'Loki's torch')

==History==
Historically, many cultures have attached special significance to Sirius. Sirius was worshipped as [[Sothis]] in the valley of the [[Nile]] long before [[Rome]] was founded. The [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]ians based [[Egyptian calendar|their calendar]] on the [[heliacal rising]] of Sirius, which occurred just before the annual flooding of the [[Nile]] and the summer [[solstice]].<ref>{{cite web | date = December 2004 | url = http://www.siriusresearchgroup.com/articles/Sothis7.shtml | title = The Sun Behind The Sun &mdash; A Special Day In Egypt's Remote Past | publisher = The Sirius Research Group | accessdate = 2006-07-04 }}</ref> In [[Greek mythology]], [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]]'s dog became Sirius. The Greeks also associated Sirius with the heat of summer: they called it Σείριος ''Seirios'', often translated "the scorcher."

In the [[astrology]] of the [[Middle Ages]], Sirius was a [[Behenian fixed star]], associated with [[beryl]] and [[juniper]]. Its [[kabbalistic]] symbol [[Image:Agrippa1531_Canismaior.png]] was listed by [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]].

Based on changes in its [[proper motion]], in 1844 [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] deduced that Sirius had a hidden companion. Nearly two decades later in 1862 [[Alvan Graham Clark]] discovered the faint companion, which is called '''Sirius B''', or affectionately "the Pup". The visible star is now sometimes known as '''Sirius A'''.

In 1909 [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] suggested that Sirius was a member of the [[Ursa Major Moving Group]], based on the systems movements across the sky. However, more recent research by Jeremy King et al. at [[Clemson University]] in 2003 questions whether that is true, since the two components of Sirius appear to be too young.<ref>{{cite journal | author=J.R. King, A.R. Villarreal, D.R. Soderblom, A.F. Gulliver, S.J. Adelman | title=Stellar Kinematic Groups. II.

Astronomers at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] determined in 1915 that Sirius B was a [[white dwarf]], the first to be discovered. The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by [[Robert Hanbury Brown]] and [[Richard Q. Twiss]] in 1959 at [[Jodrell Bank]] using their stellar [[intensity interferometer]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=R.H. Brown, R.Q. Twiss | title=Interferometry of the Intensity Fluctuations in Light.

| accessdate = 2006-07-04 }}</ref> In 2005, using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the [[Earth]], 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles), with a mass that is 98% of the [[Sun]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Peter Bond | title=Astronomers Use Hubble to 'Weigh' Dog Star's Companion | publisher=Royal Astronomical Society | date=2005-12-14 | url=http://www.ras.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=897&Itemid=2 | accessdate=2006-08-04 }}</ref>

In approximately 250,000 years, the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' spacecraft, launched in 1977 to study the four [[Jovian planets]] in the [[Solar System]], is expected to pass within 3 light years of Sirius.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==System==
[[Image:Sirius A and B artwork.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An artist's impression of Sirius A and Sirius B. Sirius A is the larger of the two stars. (Credit: ''[[NASA]]'')]]
At a distance of 2.6 [[parsec|pc]] or 8.6 [[light year]]s, Sirius is one of the [[nearest stars]] to Earth.<ref>{{cite web | last = Henry | first = Dr. Todd J. | date = 2006-07-01 | url = http://www.chara.gsu.edu/RECONS/TOP100.htm | title = The One Hundred Nearest Star Systems | publisher = RECONS | accessdate = 2006-08-04 }}</ref> Its closest large neighbour star except Sirius B is [[Procyon]], 1.61 pc or 5.24 ly away.

Sirius is a [[main sequence]] star of [[spectral type]] A0 or A1 and has a mass about 2.1 times that of the [[Sun]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Pedro | first = Braganca | date = 2003-07-15 | url =

These two stars orbit each other with a separation of about 20&nbsp;[[Astronomical Unit|AU]]<ref>1&nbsp;light&nbsp;year&nbsp;=&nbsp;63,241&nbsp;AU; semi-major axis =&nbsp;distance &times; tan(subtended angle) =&nbsp;8.6 &times; 63,241 &times; tan(7.56&Prime;) =&nbsp;19.9&nbsp;A.U., approximately</ref> (roughly the distance between the [[Sun]] and [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]]) and a period of close to 50 years. The orbit of Sirius B can take the star in front of Sirius A, briefly lowering the total luminosity. For this reason the system is considered an [[eclipsing binary]] [[variable star]].

A typical white dwarf has a mass equal to 0.5&ndash;0.6 [[solar mass]]es. With a mass nearly equal to the Sun's, Sirius B is one of the more massive white dwarfs known. Yet that same mass is packed into a volume roughly equal to the [[Earth]]. A white dwarf forms only after the star has evolved from the main sequence and then passed through a [[red giant]] stage. This occurred when Sirius B was less than half its current age, approximately 120 million years ago. The original star had an estimated 5 solar masses<ref>{{cite journal

While it passed through the red giant stage, Sirius B may have enriched the [[metallicity]] of its companion. For this reason Sirius A now has a higher than normal abundance of elements heavier than helium, such as iron.<ref name="solstation" /> The Sirius star system also emits a higher than expected level of infrared radiation, as measured by [[IRAS]]. This may be an indication of dust in the system, and is considered somewhat unusual for a binary star.<ref name="solstation" />

The current primary, Sirius A, is expected to have completely exhausted the store of hydrogen at its core within a billion (10<sup>9</sup>) years. At that point it will pass through its own red giant stage, then settle down to become a white dwarf.

There remain a few unsolved mysteries regarding Sirius: 

===Possible Third Member in System===
Since 1894, some apparent orbital irregularities in Sirius B have been observed, suggesting a third very small companion star, but this has never been definitely confirmed.<ref>Benest, D., & Duvent, J. L. (1995, July). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1995A%26A...299..621B&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=40dcacf76b29443 Is Sirius a triple star?] ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'', 299, 621-628. (available at [http://adswww.harvard.edu/ The NASA Astrophysics Data System])</ref>

===Sirius' Color===
Curiously, some ancient observations of Sirius describe it as a red star.<ref>{{cite web | date = 2005-03-21 | url = http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE351.html | title = Claim CE351 | publisher = The Talk Origins Archive | accessdate = 2006-08-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date = Jan-Feb 1986 | url = http://www.science-frontiers.com/sf043/sf043p07.htm | title = A Recent Transformation of Sirius? | publisher = Science Frontiers Online | accessdate = 2006-08-04 }}</ref> To the Romans this meant an angry god, and they are known to have sacrificed red dogs to this star. Today, Sirius A is bluish white.

The possibility that stellar evolution of either Sirius A or Sirius B could be responsible for this discrepancy is rejected by [[astronomer]]s on the grounds that the timescale of thousands of years is too short and that there is no sign of the nebulosity in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place. Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic scintillations of the star when it was observed rising left the viewer with the impression that it was red. To the naked eye, it often appears to be flashing with red/white/blue hues when near the horizon.

Sirius is the standard star for the color white in ancient China. Multiple records from the 2nd century BC up to the 7th century AD all describe Sirius as white in hue.<ref>{{cite journal | author=江晓原 | year=1992 | title=中国古籍中天狼星颜色之记载 | journal=天文学报 | volume=33 | issue=4 | language=Chinese }}</ref>

===The Dogon===
The [[Dogon people]] are a tribal people living in Africa who were reported by the anthropologists [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Germaine Dieterlen]] early in the 20th Century as having certain traditional astronomical knowledge, including of the existence of Sirius B, which would be impossible without at least telescopes.

The ethnographers' credibility and methodology are highly questionable, however, and the basis for their claim that the Dogon were aware of Sirius B is especially vague. It is derived solely from the fact that they had a mask ceremony in which a new mask was created every 60 years. This 60-year period was equated by the ethnographer to the orbital period of Sirius B, as it was then calculated by astronomers.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Nonetheless, the subject has proven fertile for [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] enthusiasts and was the theme of the book ''[[The Sirius Mystery]]'' by [[Robert Temple]], who claimed the legends of the Dogon as well as of the ancient [[Egyptians]] and [[Sumeria]]ns, allude to aliens from Sirius visiting Earth and influencing early civilization.

This work has been challenged by astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], among other mainstream scientists, as based on [[cherry picking|selective evidence]]. Skeptics believe there may have been cultural contamination on the part of visiting astronomers who went to the region to observe a [[transit of Venus]].<ref>Ridpath, Ian (1978) [http://www.csicop.org/si/7809/sirius.html Investigating the "Sirius Mystery"].
