He denied that the Bible was the Word of God<ref>Hill, ''The English Bible and the Seventeenth-Century Revolution'' (1993) p. 234.</ref>, and that Christ was more divine than other men<ref>Hill, ''Milton and the English Revolution'' (1977), p. 293.</ref>. He considered that the real Devil lay in human nature<ref>[http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:uGtsb5V3s4MJ:www.isaac-newton.org/devil.doc+%22Jacob+Bauthumley%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=19&gl=uk]</ref>, while God dwells in the flesh of man<ref>Hill, Milton, p. 301.</ref>.

[[E. P. Thompson]] calls his views 'quasi-pantheistic' in their re-definition of God and Christ, and quotes [[A. L. Morton]] to the effect that this is the central Ranter doctrine<ref>''Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law'' (1993), p. 26.</ref>.
