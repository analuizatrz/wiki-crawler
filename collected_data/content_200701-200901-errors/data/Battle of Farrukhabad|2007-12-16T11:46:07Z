The '''Battle of Farrukhabad''' took place on [[November 14]] [[1804]], between a small [[United Kingdom|British]] force under [[Gerard Lake, 1st Viscount Lake|General Lake]], and an army of 60,000 [[Maratha]]s under [[Yashwantrao Holkar]]. Holkar was signally defeated with heavy losses. The British casualties were two killed and 20 wounded.

(*[[Yashwantrao Holkar]] was in [[Farrukhabad]] on 16 November 1804, but he had defeated Major Frazer in [[Doab]] and he was on his way to [[Deeg]]. Lord Lake reached Farrukhabad on 17 November 1804 but he didnt dare to attack Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar. Lord Lake was a mute spectator watching Yaswantrao Holkar proceeding towards Deeg. Governor General was disappointed by this conduct of Lord Lake and he wrote to him about his disappointment.)
