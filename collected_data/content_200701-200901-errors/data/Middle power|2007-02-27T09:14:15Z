'''Middle power''' is a term used in the field of [[international relations]] to describe [[state]]s that are not [[superpower]]s or [[great power]]s, but still have some influence internationally. There is no single specific definition of which countries are middle powers.

==Canada==
The original use of the term was in [[Canada]] by Prime Ministers [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]  and [[Louis St. Laurent]], to describe that nation's expected level of influence following the [[Second World War]].  Under this classical definition, Canada was a middle power because it was a junior partner in larger alliances (e.g. [[NATO]], [[NORAD]]), was actively involved in resolving disputes outside its own region (e.g. [[Suez Crisis]]), was not a former colonial power and therefore neutral in anti-colonial struggles, worked actively in the [[United Nations]] to represent the interests of smaller nations and to prevent the dominance of the superpowers (often being elected to the [[United Nations Security Council]] for such reasons), and because it was involved in humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts around the world (Canada has contributed to more UN missions than any other nation).

This usage is now considered historical, and is no longer the most popular way to describe Canada's global position.  Canada's current position in international affairs is uncertain.  As of 2006, Canada no longer contributes to most UN missions, and has one of the lowest defence spending levels in NATO by percentage of GDP.  Despite this, Canada still ranks 6th in total spending in NATO, following the US, UK, France, Germany, and Italy.  Its recent increase in defence spending is modest, but funding has been used to both increase capabilities, modernize the forces, and enlarge them to more respectable levels.  Economically Canada's economy is no longer among the 10 largest (PPP) in the world, and 4/5ths of Canada's trade is with the US, yielding relatively little influence in any other part of the world, until recently.  Due to the immense natural resource base of the country, particularly its oil deposits, Canada is increasingly important to global energy production and the world's commodities' markets.  Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] has called the country an "emerging [[energy superpower]]", which appears to be backed up by projections of future oil, energy, and resource production in Canada. Canada figures prominently in plans for securing more stable sources of oil for such countries as: the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[United States]], [[Japan]], and perhaps even [[India]].  Canada's foreign aid spending has fallen sharply from a peak of 0.65% of GDP in the 1960s, with most of the rest being "tied aid" that requires recipient nations to buy Canadian products.  The government has pledged to reverse this and increase it to 0.7% of GDP, but progress has been slow.

==Globally==
Economically, middle powers are generally those that are not considered too "big" or too "small", however that is defined.  For example, most often middle powers are described as being not among the top five largest economies but perhaps still in the top thirty.  However, economics is not always considered the defining factor.

Under the original sense of the term, a middle power was one that had some degree of influence globally, but not dominance over any one area.  However, this usuage is not universal, and some define middle power to include nations that can be regarded as [[regional power]]s.  Hence, the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, though their definitions are not strictly the same.

Middle powers are characterized by allegiance to groups, but not leadership of them. Thus Canada and [[Australia]] are part of alliance blocs led by the [[United States]]. During the [[Cold War]], middle powers not aligned with either of the two superpowers often turned to the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] to find international allies. Middle powers are often the states most committed to [[multilateralism]].

Since the end of the Cold War the role of middle powers has faded as the world is no longer shaped by the rival factions of NATO and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The Middle Powers of Europe have turned to the [[European Union]], giving up some national sovereignty but maintaining influence in international affairs. Canada and Australia on the other hand have continued to pursue closer economic and security ties with the United States.

== Middle powers in 1988 ==
Some researchers use [[Gross National Product]] (GNP) statistics to draw lists of middle powers around the world. However this is not a standard method to make middle power listings. Some authors may consider other facts, such as the political association of a country, free market associatons or even its proven oil reserves.
