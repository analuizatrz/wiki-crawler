The '''National Flag of Canada''', also known as the '''Maple Leaf''', and '''''l'Unifolié''''' ([[French language|French]] for "the one-leafed"), is a red [[flag]] with a white square in its centre, featuring a stylized 11-pointed red [[maple leaf]]. Its adoption in 1965 marked the first time a national flag had been officially adopted to replace the [[Union Flag]].  The [[Canadian Red Ensign]] had been unofficially used since the 1890s and was approved by a 1945 [[Order-in-Council]] for use "wherever place or occasion may make it desirable to fly a distinctive Canadian flag".<ref name="1945 order">{{cite book|title=Historical documents of Canada|editor=Stacey, C.

Pearson]] appointed a committee to resolve the issue, sparking a  serious [[Great Flag Debate|debate about a flag change]]. Out of three choices, the maple leaf design by [[George Stanley|George F. G. Stanley]] was chosen. The flag made its first appearance on [[February 15]], [[1965]]; the date is now celebrated annually as [[National Flag of Canada Day|Flag Day]].<ref name="flagfest" />

Other flags have been created for use by Canadian officials, government bodies, and military forces. Most of these flags contain the maple leaf motif in some fashion, either by having the Canadian flag charged in the canton, or by including maple leaves in the design. The [[Union Flag|Royal Union Flag]] is also an official flag in Canada, used as a symbol of Canada's membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and of its allegiance to [[Monarchy of Canada|the Crown]]. The flag forms a component of other Canadian flags, notably the provincial flags of [[flag of Manitoba|Manitoba]] and the [[flag of Ontario|Ontario]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Royal Union Flag |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University]]|author=Fraser, Alistair }}</ref>

== History ==
{{seealso|Great Flag Debate}}
The first flag known to have flown in Canada was the [[St George's Cross]] [[England|English]] flag carried by [[John Cabot]] when he reached the east coast of Canada in 1497. In 1534, [[Jacques Cartier]] planted a cross in [[Gaspé Peninsula|Gaspé]] bearing the French royal coat of arms with the [[fleurs-de-lis]]. His ship flew a red flag with a white cross, the national flag of France at the time. [[New France]] continued to fly the evolving [[Flag of France|French military flags]] of that period.<ref name="first flags" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/portrait/drapeau/?lang=en|title=National Flag and Emblems|date=2006-10-12|work=Portrait of Québec|publisher=[[Government of Quebec]]|accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref>

The [[Union Flag|Royal Union Flag]] has been in use in Canada since the 1621 British settlement in [[Nova Scotia]]. Since the [[French and Indian War|surrender of New France]] to the [[United Kingdom]] in the early 1760s, the Royal Union Flag, called the Union Flag (or, commonly, Union Jack) in the [[United Kingdom]], was used as a ''[[wikt:de jure|de jure]]'' national flag, as in the United Kingdom, until the adoption of the current flag in 1965.<ref name="first flags" />

Shortly after [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867, the need for distinctively Canadian flags emerged. The first Canadian flag was the [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada]], a Royal Union Flag with a shield in the centre bearing the quartered arms of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick surrounded by a wreath of maple leaves.<ref name="Fraser Flags">{{cite book |last=Fraser |first=Alistair B. |title=The Flags of Canada |url=http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/index.html |accessdate=2008-04-20 |date=[[1998-01-30]] |chapter=A Canadian Flag for Canada |chapterurl=http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Nation/CanFlag.html }}</ref> In 1870, the [[Red Ensign]], with the addition of the Canadian composite shield in the fly, began to be used unofficially on land and sea, and was known as the [[Canadian Red Ensign]]. As new provinces joined the Confederation, their arms were added to the shield. In 1892, the British admiralty approved the use of the Red Ensign for Canadian use at sea. The composite shield was replaced with the [[Coat of arms of Canada]] upon its grant in 1921 and, in 1924, an [[Order-in-Council]] approved its use for Canadian government buildings abroad.<ref name="first flags" />

In 1963, the minority [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[Lester B. Pearson]] gained power, and decided to adopt an official Canadian flag through parliamentary debate. Creating an official national flag had been discussed for decades in the 20th century, particularly during the Liberal governments of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-17|url=http://www.mta.ca/about_canada/study_guide/debates/flag_debate.html|title=The Flag Debate |publisher=[[Mount Allison University]] }}</ref> During the [[World War II|Second World War]], there was an effort to create a national flag for Canadian troops to carry into battle.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-13|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/flag-drapeau/naissance-birth/elements_e.cfm|title=Elements of the National Flag of Canada |publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]] }}</ref> It was not until the 1960s that the debate intensified and became a subject of controversy, culminating in the [[Great Flag Debate]] of 1964.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-13|url=http://history.cbc.ca/history/?MIval=EpisContent&series_id=1&episode_id=16&chapter_id=1&page_id=2&lang=E|title=The Great Flag Debate |publisher=[[CBC]] }}</ref> The principal political proponent of the change was [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Lester Pearson. He had been a significant broker during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref name="suez">{{harv|Thorner|2003|p=524}}</ref> During the crisis, Pearson was disturbed when the Egyptian government objected to Canadian peacekeeping forces, on the grounds that the Canadian flag (the Red Ensign) contained the flag (the Union Jack) of the United Kingdom, one of the belligerents.<ref name="suez" /> Pearson's goal was for the Canadian flag to be distinctive and unmistakably Canadian. The main opponent to changing the flag was the [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|leader of the opposition]] and former prime minister, [[John Diefenbaker]], who eventually made the subject a personal crusade.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-31|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/language_culture/topics/80/|title=The Great Canadian Flag Debate |publisher=[[CBC]] }}</ref>

Pearson was leader of a minority Government and risked losing power over the issue; however, he knew the Red Ensign with the Union Jack was unpopular in Quebec, a Liberal base of support. The Red Ensign was strongly favoured by rural English Canada, the heart of [[Tory]] support. On [[May 27]], [[1964]], Pearson's minority Liberal government introduced a motion to Parliament for adoption of his favourite design of a "sea to sea" (Canada's motto) flag with blue borders and three conjoined red maple leaves on a white field. This motion led to weeks of acrimonious debate in Parliament, and the design came to be known as the "Pearson Pennant".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-13|url=http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2007-2/issue3/fe-flags.html|title=Wrong turns on the road of symbolism |publisher=[[The Peak (newspaper)|The Peak]]|date=2007-05-21|author=Reeve, Iain}}</ref> Diefenbaker demanded a referendum be held on the flag issue, but Pearson instead formed a 15-member multi-party parliamentary committee to select a new design. Through a period of study with political manoeuvring, the committee chose the current design, which was created by [[George Stanley|George F.G. Stanley]] and inspired by the flag of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. The design was approved unanimously by the committee on [[October 29]], [[1964]], and later passed by a majority vote in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] on [[December 15]], [[1964]]. The [[Canadian Senate|Senate]] added its approval two days later.<ref name="birth" />

[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] proclaimed the new flag on [[January 28]], [[1965]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/df3_e.cfm|title=Birth of the Canadian flag |publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]] }}</ref> It was inaugurated on [[February 15]], [[1965]], at an official ceremony held on [[Parliament Hill]] in Ottawa in the presence of [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] Major-General [[Georges P. Vanier]], the [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], the members of the Cabinet, and Canadian parliamentarians. The Canadian Red Ensign, bearing the Union Jack and the shield of the [[Coat of arms of Canada|royal arms of Canada]], was lowered at the stroke of noon, and the new Maple Leaf flag was raised. The crowd sang the national anthem, "[[O Canada]]", followed by the royal anthem, "[[God Save the Queen]]".<ref name="flagfest" /> [[Maurice Bourget]], Speaker of the Senate, said, "The flag is the symbol of the nation's unity, for it, beyond any doubt, represents all the citizens of Canada without distinction of race, language, belief, or opinion."<ref name="flagfest" />  For the nation's centennial celebrations in 1967, the Canadian government used the Canadian coat of arms (whose shield was used on the red ensign) on a red flag.<ref>{{harv|Thompson|2002|p=50}}</ref>

As a symbol of the nation's membership in the Commonwealth, the Royal Union Flag remains an official Canadian flag and is flown on certain occasions.<ref name="royal union" /> Regulations require federal installations to fly the Union Flag beside the Maple Leaf when physically possible, using a second flagpole, on the following days: [[Commonwealth Day]] (the second Monday in March), [[Victoria Day]] (which is also the Sovereign's official birthday in Canada), and the anniversary of the [[Statute of Westminster]] ([[December 11]]). The Union Flag can also be flown at the National War Memorial or at other locations during ceremonies that honour Canadian involvement with forces of other Commonwealth nations during times of war. The Maple Leaf Flag always precedes the Union Flag, with the former occupying the place of honour.<ref name="royal union" /> The Union Flag is also part of the provincial [[flag of Ontario|flags of Ontario]] and [[Flag of Manitoba|Manitoba]], forming the canton of these flags. A modified version is used on the [[flag of British Columbia]], and the [[flag of Newfoundland and Labrador]] is a stylized version of the Union Jack.<ref name="royal union" /> Several of the provincial [[lieutenant-governor]]s formerly used a modified Union Flag as their personal standard, but the [[Lieutenant-Governors of Nova Scotia|Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia]] is the only one who retains this design.<ref name="royal union">{{cite web| date = 2003-01-01| url =http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/etiquette/4_e.cfm| title = The Royal Union Flag| publisher =[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]| accessdate=2006-05-20}}</ref> The Union Flag and Canadian Red Ensign are still sometimes flown in Canada by veterans' groups and others who continue to stress the importance of Canada's British heritage and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] connection.<ref name="royal union" />

It was flown at the commemorations of the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in 2007.<ref name="globe red ensign" /><ref name="slams red ensign" /> This decision elicited criticism from those who believe it should not be given equal status to the Canadian flag, and received praise from people who believe that it is important to retain the ties to Canada's past.<ref name="globe red ensign">{{cite news|date=2007-03-31|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070331.weensign31/BNStory/VimyRidge/home/|title=Globe Editorial: Red Ensign|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref><ref name="slams red ensign">{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FRTGAM.20070709.wvimy09%2FBNStory%2FNational%2Fhome&ord=72267222&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true|title=Dallaire slams decision to fly Red Ensign|last=Peritz|first=Ingrid|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=2007-07-09|accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref>

Officially, there is no law that dictates the proper use of the Canadian flag. However, [[Canadian Heritage]] released guidelines on how to correctly display the flag alone and with other flags. The guidelines deal with the order of precedence the Canadian flag is placed, where the flag can be used, how it is used, and what people should do to honour the flag. The suggestions, titled ''Flag Etiquette in Canada,'' were published by Canadian Heritage in book and online formats and last updated in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/etiquette/2_e.cfm|title=Rules for Flying the Flag |publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]|date=2003-04-01 }}</ref> The [[Government of Canada|Canadian Government]], on the other hand, follows guidelines set forth by the United Nations. With the weather permitting, the flag itself can be displayed on any day at buildings operated by the Canadian government, airports, military bases, and diplomatic offices, as well as by citizens, during any time of the day. When flying the flag, it must be flown using its own pole and must not be inferior to other flags, save for, in descending order, the [[Queen's Personal Canadian Flag|Queen's Personal Standard]], the [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada|Governor General's Standard]], any of the Personal Standards of members of the [[Canadian monarchy#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]], or flags of the [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governors]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf|format=[[PDF]]| title=The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces |publisher=[[Department of National Defence (Canada)]] }}</ref>

==Promoting the flag==
[[Image:Items from the Canadian Parliamentary Flag Program.jpg|thumb|A sample of items from the Parliamentary Flag Program]]
Ever since the adoption of the Canadian flag in 1965, the Canadian government has sponsored programs to promote it. Examples include the Heritage Department's Parliamentary Flag Program <!--year range, or "since [year]" for each of these two (and remove the stub-sentence I now see further on about 1973); use the proper title of the heritage department ... the p f p of the [full title of dept]-->and the flag program run by the [[Public Works and Government Services Canada|Department of Public Works]]. These programs increased the exposure of the flag and the concept that it was part of the national identity. To increase awareness of the new flag, the Parliamentary Flag Program was set up in December 1972 by the Cabinet.<!--This refers back to the previous mention; so cite the PWGSC first, then this one, and run it into this more detailed bit --> The purpose of this program was to allow members of the [[Canadian House of Commons]] to distribute flags and lapel pins in the shape of the Canadian flag to their constituents. The program has been in operation since 1973.<ref>{{cite web| date = 2003-01-01| url =http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/mission/11_e.cfm| title = Administration of the Parliamentary Flag Program| publisher =[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]| accessdate=2006-05-20}}</ref> Flags that are flown from the [[Peace Tower]] and the East and West blocks of [[Parliament Hill]] are packaged by the Department of Public Works and can be obtained free of charge. However, the program has an 11-year waiting list for East and West block flags, and a 20-year waiting list for Peace Tower flags.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-25|url=http://www.parliamenthill.gc.ca/text/faq_e.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[Government of Canada]] }}</ref>
