A large part of the reef is protected by the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]], which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as overfishing and tourism.  Other environmental pressures to the reef and its ecosystem include water quality from runoff, climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching, and cyclic outbreaks of the [[crown-of-thorns starfish]].

==Geology and geography==

Dating [[wikt:discrepancy|discrepancies]] stem from how reefs fluctuate (grow and recede) as the [[sea level]] changes. They can increase in diameter from 1 to 2 centimetres per year, and grow vertically anywhere from 1 to 15 centimetres (0.4&ndash;12&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]) per year; however, they are limited to growing above a depth of {{m to ft|150|spell=UK|precision=0|wiki=yes}} due to their need for sunlight, and cannot grow above sea level.<ref>{{cite web|author=MSN Encarta|year=2006 |title=Great Barrier Reef| url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575831/Great_Barrier_Reef.html|accessdate=2006-12-11}}</ref>

According to the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority]], the current, living reef structure is believed to have begun growing on an older platform about 20,000 years ago.<ref name = "GBRMPAage"/> The [[Australian Institute of Marine Science]] agrees, which places the beginning of the growth of the current reef at the time of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. At around that time, the sea level was {{m to ft|120|spell=UK|precision=0|}} lower than it is today. The land that formed the [[wiktionary:substrate|substrate]] of the Great Barrier Reef was a [[coastal plain]] with some larger hills (some of which were themselves remnants of older reefs).<ref name ="AIMSage">{{cite web | last = Tobin | first = Barry | title = How the Great Barrier Reef was formed | publisher = Australian Institute of Marine Science | date = 1998, revised 2003 | url = http://www.aims.gov.au/pages/research/project-net/reefs/apnet-reefs00.html | accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}</ref>

[[Image:Heron Island, Australia - View of Island from helicopter.JPG|right|thumb|[[Heron Island]], a coral cay in the southern Great Barrier Reef.]]
From 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, the [[Sea level rise|sea level rose]] steadily. As it rose, the corals could grow higher on the hills of the coastal plain. By around 13,000 years ago the sea level was {{m to ft|60|spell=UK|precision=0|}} lower than the present day, and corals began to grow around the hills of the coastal plain, which were, by then, [[Island#Continental islands|continental islands]]. As the sea level rose further still, most of the continental islands were submerged. The corals could then overgrow the hills, to form the present [[cay]]s and reefs. Sea level on the Great Barrier Reef has not risen significantly in the last 6,000 years.<ref name="AIMSage"/>The CRC Reef Research Centre estimates the age of the present, living reef structure at 6,000 to 8,000 years old.<ref name="CRCage"/>

==Environmental threats==
{{main|Environmental threats to the Great Barrier Reef}}

===Pollution===
Pollution is currently one of the largest threats to the Reef's health. The rivers of north eastern Australia provide significant pollution of the Reef during tropical flood events with over 90% of this pollution being sourced from farms.<ref>{{cite web|date=2003|url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p01258bs.pdf|title=Coastal water quality |work=The State of the Environment Report Queensland 2003 |publisher=Environment Protection Agency Queensland|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref>

Farm run-off is polluted as a result of overgrazing and excessive fertiliser and pesticide use. Mud pollution has increased by 800% and inorganic nitrogen pollution by 3,000% since the introduction of European farming practices on the Australian landscape. This pollution has been linked to a range of very significant risks to the reef system, including intensified outbreaks of the coral-eating Crown of Thorns Starfish which contributed to a loss of 66% of live coral cover on sampled reefs in 2000.<ref name="cots 1999-2000">{{cite web|url=http://www.reef.crc.org.au/publications/techreport/techrept32.htm|title=CRC REEF RESEARCH CENTRE TECHNICAL REPORT No. 32 — Crown-of-thorns starfish(Acanthaster planci) in the central Great Barrier Reef region. Results of fine-scale surveys conducted in 1999-2000.|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref> 

Due to the range of human uses made of the water catchment area adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef, [[Water pollution|water quality]] has declined owing to the sediment and chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from farming, and to loss of coastal [[wetland]]s which are a natural filter.<ref name= wetlands>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=|title=Wetlands|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/water_quality/wetlands|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>
Industries in the water catchment area are cotton growing, comprising of approximately 26 200 [[hectare]]s; 340 dairy farms with an average area of 200 ha each, 15800 ha cattle grazing, 28 800 ha horticulture including banana growing, sugarcane farming, and cropping of approximately 800 000 ha wheat, 120 000 ha barley, and 600 000-700 000 ha sorghum and maize.<ref name= "Brodie07">{{cite web |date=2007 |author=Brodie, J.|url=http://www.actfr.jcu.edu.au/Publications/ACTFRreports/06-07_NMZ%20technical%20final%20March%202007%20main.pdf|title=Nutrient management zones in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment: A decision system for zone selection|publisher=Australian Centre for Tropical Freshwater Research|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref>  Fertiliser use in the cotton, dairy, beef, horticulture and sugar industries is essential to ensure productivity and profitability.

It is thought that the mechanism behind poor water quality affecting the reefs is due to increased light and oxygen [[Competition (biology)|competition]] from [[algae]].<ref name= waterquality>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2006|title=Principal water quality influences on Great Barrier Reef ecosystems|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/water_quality/principal_influences.html|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>

Most people believe that the most significant threat to the status of the Great Barrier Reef and of the planet's other tropical reef [[ecosystem]]s is [[climate change]], comprising chiefly of [[global warming]] and [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|the El Niño effect]].<ref name="GBRMPAclimatechange">{{cite web |author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/science/climate_change|title=Climate change and the Great Barrier Reef|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> Many of the corals of the Great Barrier Reef are currently living at the upper edge of their temperature tolerance, as demonstrated in the mass [[coral bleaching]] events of the summers of 1998, 2002 and 2006.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|title=Coral Bleaching and Mass Bleaching Events|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/science/climate_change/coral_bleaching.html|acccessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref>

As demonstrated in 1998, 2002 and 2006, corals expel their [[photosynthesis]]ing [[zooxanthella]]e and turn colourless, revealing their white [[calcium carbonate]] skeletons, under the stress of waters that remain too warm for too long. At this stage the coral is still alive, and if the water cools, the coral can regain its zoozanthellae.<ref name="GuideCoralBleaching">{{cite book

Kleypas ''et al.'' in their 2006 report suggest that the trend towards [[ocean acidification]] indicates that as the sea's [[pH]] decreases, corals will become less able to secrete calcium carbonate.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kleypas, J.A., R.A.

Climate change has implications for other forms of life on the Great Barrier Reef as well - some fish's preferred temperature range lead them to seek new areas to live, thus causing chick mortality in seabirds that prey on the fish. Also, in sea turtles, higher temperatures mean that the sex ratio of their populations will change, as the sex of sea turtles is determined by temperature. The habitat of sea turtles will also shrink.<ref name="GBRMPAclimatechange"/>
With seawater temperatures rising above sustainable levels for oceanic life, the Australian ecology and biodiversity is suffering. Currently, several environmental activist groups and campaigners are trying to involve the wider community in part taking in an action plan against climate change. One such development, is the Big Switch. <ref>[http://www.thebigswitch.org.au/ The Big Switch Climate Change Campaign]</ref>

===Crown-of-thorns starfish===
[[Image:CrownofThornsStarfish_Fiji_2005-10-12.jpg|thumb|right|Crown-of-thorns starfish]]
The [[crown-of-thorns starfish]] is a coral reef predator which preys on coral polyps. An individual adult of this species can wipe out up to six [[square metre]]s of living reef in a single year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pierre Madl|title=Marine Biology I - Acanthaster planci| url=http://www.sbg.ac.at/ipk/avstudio/pierofun/planci/planci.htm| accessdate=2006-08-28}}</ref>

Large outbreaks of these starfish can devastate reefs. In 2000, an outbreak contributed to a loss of 66% of live coral cover on sampled reefs in a study by the CRC Reefs Research Centre.<ref name="cots 1999-2000"/>

===Overfishing===
The unsustainable [[overfishing]] of [[keystone species]], such as the [[Triton (mollusk)|Giant Triton]], can cause disruption to [[food chain]]s vital to life on the reef. Fishing also impacts the reef through increased pollution from boats, [[by-catch]] of unwanted species (such as dolphins and turtles) and reef [[habitat destruction]] from [[trawling]], [[anchors]] and nets.<ref>{{cite web|author=CSIRO Marine Research|year=1998|title=Environmental Effects of Prawn Trawling|url=http://www.marine.csiro.au/LeafletsFolder/26trawl/26.html|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> As of the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]] is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|title=Marine Park Zoning|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/management/zoning/index.html|accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref>

===Shipping===

Shipping accidents are also a pressing concern, as several commercial shipping routes pass through the Great Barrier Reef.

The leading cause of shipping accidents in the Great Barrier Reef is [[Human reliability|human error]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Maritime Safety Authority|year=2002|title=Great Barrier Reef Review Report - Review of ship safety and pollution prevention measures in the Great Barrier Reef|url=http://www.amsa.gov.au/shipping%5Fsafety/great%5Fbarrier%5Freef%5Freview/gbr%5Freview%5Freport/contents%5Fhtml%5Fversion.asp|accessdate=2006-10-19}}</ref>

Although the route through the Great Barrier Reef is not easy, reef pilots consider it safer than outside the reef in the event of mechanical failure, since a ship can sit safely while being repaired.<ref name=reefdoco>''Reef Dreams: Working The Reef'' [[Documentary film|TV documentary]], [[Australian Broadcasting Commission]], broadcast [[6 July]] [[2006]] [http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/netw/200607/programs/ZY6905A003D6072006T180400.htm]</ref> 75% of all ships that use the Great Barrier Reef as a route use the inner route.<ref name="GBRMPAshipping"/> On the outside, wind and swell will push a ship towards the reef and the water is deep right up to the reef so anchoring is impossible.<ref name=reefdoco/> [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] in the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' nearly came to grief that way, being utterly becalmed and pushed towards the reef by the swell.

===Oil===
It is suspected that the Great Barrier Reef is the cap to an [[Oil reservoir|oil trap]]. In the 1960s and early 1970s, there was some speculation about [[Oil well|drilling for oil]] and gas there.<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Institute of Marine Science|year=1996|title=AIMS Science for Management of the Great Barrier Reef - The Great Barrier Reef at a Glance |url=http://www.aims.gov.au/pages/research/smgbr/smgbr10.html|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> In 1970, two [[Royal Commission]]s were ordered "into exploratory and production drilling for petroleum in the area of the Great Barrier Reef".<ref>{{cite web|author=Parliament of Australia|year=2006|title=List of Royal Commissions, 1902-|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/INTGUIDE/LAW/royalcommissions.htm|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref><ref name="1975review"/> Oil drilling is not permitted on the Great Barrier Reef, yet [[oil spill]]s are still considered "one of the biggest threats to the reef", with a total of 282 oil spills between 1987-2002.<ref name="waterquality"/>

===Tropical cyclones===
[[Image:Cyclone Larry 19 mar 2006 0025Z.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cyclone Larry|Tropical Cyclone Larry]] over the Great Barrier Reef, 19 March 2006.]]
Tropical cyclones are a cause of [[Disturbance|ecological disturbance]] to the Great Barrier Reef. The types of damage caused by tropical cyclones to the Great Barrier Reef is varied, including fragmentation, sediment plumes, and decreasing salinity following heavy rains ([[1990-1995 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons#Tropical Cyclone Joy|Tropical Cyclone Joy]]). The patterns of reef damage are similarly 'patchy'. From 1910-1999, 170 cyclones' paths came near or through the Great Barrier Reef. Most cyclones pass through the Great Barrier Reef within a day.<ref name="tropicalcyclones">{{Citation

==Human use==
The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and utilised by the [[Aboriginal Australian]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples. Aboriginal Australians have been living in the area from at least 40,000 years ago,<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|date=2006 date|title=Fact Sheet No. 4 - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People and the Great Barrier Reef Region|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/2142/Fact_Sheet_04_IPLU.pdf|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> and Torres Strait Islanders since about 10,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|date=|title=reefED - GBR Traditional Owners|url=http://www.reefed.edu.au/explorer/traditional_owners/index.html|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> For these 70 or so clan groups, the reef is also an important part of their culture and spirituality.<ref name= traditionalfishing>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/conservation/natural_values/indigenous|title=Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Culture & Dugongs and Turtles|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>

The reef first became known to [[Europeans]] when the [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']], captained by explorer [[James Cook]], ran [[wiktionary:aground|aground]] there on [[June 11]], [[1770]], sustaining considerable damage. It was finally saved after lightening the ship as much as possible and re-floating it during an incoming tide.<ref name="cook"/> One of the most famous wrecks was that of the [[HMS Pandora (1779)|HMS ''Pandora'']], which sank on [[August 29]], [[1791]], killing 35. The [[Queensland Museum]] has been leading archaeological digs to the ''Pandora'' since 1983.<ref>{{cite web| author=Queensland Museum| year=| title=HMS Pandora| url=http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/features/pandora/pandora.asp| accessdate=2006-10-12}}</ref>

===Management===
{{main|Great Barrier Reef Marine Park}}
After the Royal Commissions' findings, in 1975 the [[Government of Australia]] created the Great Barrier Reef [[Marine Park]] and defined what activities were prohibited on the Great Barrier Reef.<ref>{{cite web| author=Commonwealth of Australia| year=1975| title=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/gbrmpa1975257/index.html| accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref> The park is managed, in partnership with the [[Government of Queensland]], through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to ensure that it is widely understood and used in a sustainable manner. A combination of zoning, management plans, permits, education and incentives (such as [[eco-tourism]] certification) are used in the effort to conserve the Great Barrier Reef.

In July 2004, a new zoning plan was brought into effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for the conservation of [[marine ecosystem]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2003|title=Zoning Plan 2003|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/10591/Zoning_Plan.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-02}} (PDF)</ref> While protection across the Marine Park was improved, the highly protected zones increased from 4.5% to over 33.3%.<ref>{{cite web|author=World Wildlife Fund Australia|year=|title=Great Barrier Reef - WWF-Australia|url=http://www.wwf.org.au/ourwork/oceans/gbr/|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> At the time, it was the largest [[Marine Protected Area|marine protected area]] in the world, although as of 2006, the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument]] is the largest.<ref name=BBC_5083974>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5083974.stm Bush to protect Hawaiian islands], [[BBC News]], [[15 June]] [[2006]]</ref>

In 2006, a review was undertaken of the ''Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975''. Some recommendations of the review are that there should be no further zoning plan changes until 2013, and that every five years, a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] Outlook Report should be published, examining the health of the Great Barrier Reef, the management of the reef, and environmental pressures.<ref name="1975review"/>

===Tourism===
Due to its vast [[biodiversity]], warm clear waters and its accessibility from the floating guest facilities called '[[live aboard]]s', the reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially [[scuba diving|scuba divers]]. Many cities along the Queensland coast offer daily boat trips to the reef. Several continental and coral cay islands have been turned into [[resort]]s, including the pristine resort island of [[Lady Elliot Island]].

As the largest commercial activity in the region, it was estimated in 2003 that tourism in the Great Barrier Reef generates over [[Australian dollar|AU$]]4 billion annually.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2003|title=Summary report of the social and economic impacts of the rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.|url=http://www.reefed.edu.au/rap/pdf/JUG_SR_09-12-03.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-19}} (PDF)</ref> (A 2005 estimate puts the figure at [[AU$]]5.1 billion.<ref name = 2005Brochure>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=Protecting Biodiversity Brochure 2005|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/brochures/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref>) Approximately two million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year= |title=Number of Tourists Visiting The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park| url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/tourism/gbr_visitation/numbers|accessdate=2006-10-12}} </ref> Although most of these visits are managed in partnership with the marine [[Tourism|tourism industry]], there are some very popular areas near shore (such as [[Green Island National Park|Green Island]]) that have suffered damage due to overfishing and land based run off.

[[Image:Glasbodenboot.jpg|left|thumb|A glass-bottomed boat on the Great Barrier Reef]]
A variety of boat tours and cruises are offered, from single day trips, to longer voyages. Boat sizes range from [[dinghies]] to [[superyacht]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=Onboard The Tourism Operator's Handbook for the Great Barrier Reef - What You Do|url=http://www.tourismoperators.reefhq.com.au/yourproduct/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> [[Glass bottom boat|Glass-bottomed boats]] and [[underwater observatory|underwater observatories]] are also popular, as are [[helicopter]] flights. By far, the most popular tourist activities on the Great Barrier Reef are [[snorkelling]] and diving, for which pontoons are often used, and the area is often enclosed by nets. The outer part of the Great Barrier Reef is favoured for such activities, due to water quality.

Management of tourism in the Great Barrier Reef is geared towards making tourism [[ecological sustainability|ecologically sustainable]]. A daily fee is levied that goes towards research of the Great Barrier Reef.<ref name = "2005Brochure"/> This fee ends up being 20% of the GBRMPA's income.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=Onboard The Tourism Operator's Handbook for the Great Barrier Reef - How is the Money Used?|url=http://www.tourismoperators.reefhq.com.au/emc/use_of/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref> Plans of management are also in place for the popular tourist destinations of Cairns and the [[Whitsunday Islands]], which account for 85% of the tourism in the region.<ref name = "2005Brochure"/>
Policies on [[cruise ship]]s, [[bareboat charter]]s, and anchorages limit the traffic on the Great Barrier Reef.<ref name = "2005Brochure"/>

The 2003 Pixar film, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', featured the Great Barrier Reef as a setting.

===Fishing===
The [[fishing industry]] in the Great Barrier Reef, controlled by the Queensland Government, is worth [[Australian dollar|AU$]]1 billion annually.<ref>{{cite web|author=Access Economics Pty Ltd|year=2005|title=Measuring the economic and financial value of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/about_us/documents/economic_values_report.pdf|accessdate=2007-03-16}} (PDF)</ref> It employs approximately 2000 people, and fishing in the Great Barrier Reef is pursued commercially, for recreation, and as a traditional means for feeding one's family.<ref name= traditionalfishing/> [[Wonky hole]]s in the reef provide particularly productive fishing areas.
