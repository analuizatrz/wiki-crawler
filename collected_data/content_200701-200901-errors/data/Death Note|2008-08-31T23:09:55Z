== Plot ==
The series is about [[Light Yagami]], an extremely intelligent young man who resents the crime and corruption in the world. His life undergoes a drastic change when he discovers a mysterious notebook, known as the "Death Note", lying on the ground. The Death Note's instructions claim that if a human's name is written within it, that person shall die. Light is initially skeptical of the notebook's authenticity, but after experimenting with it, Light realizes that the Death Note is real. After meeting with the previous owner of the Death Note, a ''[[Shinigami (Death Note)|shinigami]]'' named [[Shinigami (Death Note)#Ryuk|Ryuk]], Light seeks to become "the God of the New World" by passing his judgement on those he deems to be evil or who get in his way.

Soon, the number of inexplicable deaths of reported criminals catches the attention of the [[Interpol|International Police Organization]] and a mysterious detective known only as "''[[L (Death Note)|L]]''". L quickly learns that the serial killer, dubbed by the public as {{nihongo|"Kira"|キラ||derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the word "''killer''"}}, is located in Japan. L also concludes that Kira can kill people without laying a finger on them. Light realizes that L will be his greatest nemesis, and a game of psychological [[Wiktionary:cat and mouse game|cat and mouse]] between the two begins.

=== The Death Note and its function ===
A ''Shinigami''{{'}}s Death Note is a notebook with the power to kill the human whose name is written in it. All Death Notes are governed by the same set of rules determining the extents and limitations of the Notes' powers.

;Written rules
Before dropping the Death Note in the human world, Ryuk wrote five of the most basic rules on the Note's inside front cover. He chose to write the rules in [[English language|English]] because he believed it to be the most popular human language. Those rules are as follows:
<!-- NOTE: All of the rules that belong in this section are here. Please do not add any other rules to this section, or remove any of them. Thank you.!-->
*The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
*This note will not take effect unless the writer has the subject's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
*If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the subject's name, it will happen.
*If the cause of death is not specified, the subject will simply die of a [[cardiac arrest|heart attack]]. 
*After writing the cause of death, the details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

In addition to these basic rules, many [[manga]] chapters have a title page, and many [[anime]] episodes have two [[eyecatch]]es, containing several rules written in both English and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. These rules often serve to clarify the more esoteric uses of the Death Note that the characters discover on their own, and usually pertain to the chapter or episode that they accompany. Official Death Notes contain over 40 pages listing these rules.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

== Characters ==
{{Main|List of Death Note characters}}

=== Main characters ===
;<span id="Light"/>{{Nihongo|[[Light Yagami]] (Kira)|夜神 月|Yagami Raito}}
:The protagonist of ''Death Note'', Light is an extremely intelligent, popular and athletic, but bored 17-year old student. When he finds the Death Note, dropped in the human world by Ryuk (a ''shinigami''), he decides to use it to kill all criminals and earns the title ''Kira''. His ultimate goal is to cleanse the world of evil to create a [[utopia]] and then reign over this new world as its [[god]].  

;<span id="L"/>{{Nihongo|[[L (Death Note)|L]]|エル|Eru|L Lawliet}}
:L is the world's top-rated detective, tasked with tracking down and arresting Kira. As such, he is Light's arch-enemy. His disheveled appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. L has many quirks, such as sitting in an odd manner, snacking on sweets constantly, and holding objects in a peculiar manner. He often takes drastic strategies to confuse and force the hand of his opponents. On several occasions he has willingly disclosed several of his weaknesses to Kira at the risk of his own life in the hopes that he would lure him into a trap.

;<span id="Misa"/>{{Nihongo|[[Misa Amane]]|弥 海砂|Amane Misa}}
:A girl with an immense crush on Kira, Misa is a popular [[Japanese idol|idol]] in Japan. She is immature and tends to refer to herself in the third person in an attempt to be cute. Misa is completely devoted to Light, and she once said that she loved him at first sight. Light, however, only views her as an asset to his plans because of her Death Note and her ''Shinigami'' eyes (that she obtained at the cost of half of her remaining life span, twice). Misa devotes herself to Light because he killed her parents' murderer after several trials had failed to convict him.

;<span id="Mello"/>{{Nihongo|[[Mello (Death Note)|Mello]]|メロ|Mero|Mihael Keehl}}
:Mello was an orphan who grew up with Near in Watari's shelter for gifted children. Like Near, Mello was one of the candidates to become L's successor. Similar to L's fondness for sweets, he is often seen eating bars of chocolate. Although Mello is quite intelligent, he often lets his emotions get the better of him. Mello wears leather most of the time, unlike Near or L. He also appears to be less secluded in terms of his friends and hobbies, and seems to be fond of biking.

;<span id="Near"/>{{Nihongo|[[Near (Death Note)|Near]]|ニア|Nia|Nate River}}
:Near was a primary candidate to become L's successor and calls himself N during the course of his investigations. He shares a number of similarities with L. Much like how L plays with things such as sugar cubes and forks, Near is frequently shown playing with toys or his hair. Near also sits in an unusual manner similar to L, but with some slight differences. He offered to join forces with Mello to fight Kira, but Mello turned him down. Near then gained the support of the [[Government of the United States]] and formed the Special Provision for Kira (SPK).

=== ''Shinigami'' (Death Gods) ===
{{main|Shinigami (Death Note)}}
;<span id="Ryuk"/>{{Nihongo|Ryuk|リューク|Ryūku}}
:A ''shinigami'' who dropped a Death Note into the human world, which Light would pick up. Acting out of pure boredom, Ryuk begins the story of Death Note on a whim. It is stated that Ryuk obtained the second Death Note in the ''shinigami'' world from "tricking the old man" for another one. Ryuk is not Light's ally, and in fact declares in their first meeting that someday he (Ryuk) would write Light's name into his own Death Note. Ryuk often refuses to aid Light and instead enjoys watching him struggle for his goals. He acts for his own interests and entertainment, and often fails to tell Light key details about the Death Note. However, Ryuk will aid Light if it serves his own goals, such as providing amusement or obtaining apples, without which he suffers a form of [[Withdrawal|withdrawal symptoms]].

;<span id="Rem"/>{{Nihongo|Rem|レム|Remu}}
<!-- Rem is female. She is indeed female, so please do not change this section again to imply that she is male. It will be considered vandalism. Thank you. -->
:The female ''shinigami'' who first gives Misa her Death Note and trades her for the ''Shinigami'' eyes. Similar to Ryuk, Rem possesses two Death Notes; however, she purposely gives one of them to Misa Amane. Rem inherited her second Death Note from Gelus, another ''shinigami'' who died when he saved Misa's life, and thought it only right to pass it on to Misa. Rem inherits Gelus' love for Misa as well and is prompt to defend Misa even at the cost of her life. Rem shows this when she states that she will kill Light if Misa dies before her time.

;<span id="Shidou"/>{{Nihongo|Sidoh|シドウ|Shidō}}
:The third ''shinigami'' seen in the human world, Sidoh is revealed as the original owner of the Death Note Ryuk dropped at the beginning of the series. Initially upon entering the human world, Sidoh relentlessly follows Ryuk, demanding the return of his Death Note. Ryuk eventually admits he has no knowledge of the location of Sidoh's Death Note, said note having been used as a bargaining chip by Light and fallen into Mello's hands. Sidoh eventually locates his Death Note, and, under questioning, reveals to Mello (who subsequently reveals to Near) that some of the rules written in the Death Note are fake. The English versions of the series and the Japanese volumes use the romanization ''Sidoh'' while the Japanese ''Death Note 13: How to Read'' book uses the romanization ''Shidoh''.

== Production ==
Ohba said that he decided to create a suspense series because he did not feel that he could have created a "normal fight-style" series and that the genre had few suspense series. Ohba said that he did not derive the ''Death Note'' concept from any single source. He said that one day he thought of a concept involving Shinigami and "specific rules."<ref name="HowtoRead59">''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[Viz Media]]. 59.</ref> 

After publication of the pilot chapter Ohba said that he did not expect for the series to be approved as a serialized comic as he thought it did not "fit with ''Jump''." Ohba said that when he learned ''Death Note'' received approval and that Obata would create the artwork he "couldn't even believe it."<ref name="HTR174">''Death Note: How to Read 13''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 174.</ref>

Due to positive reactions to the series ''Death Note'' became a serialized manga series.<ref name="HowtoRead 58">"How to Think." ''Death Note: How to Read 13''. [[VIZ Media]]. 58.</ref>

Ohba created "thumbnails," consisting of dialog, panel layout, and basic drawings, to be sent to Obata; the editor reviewed the thumbnails and sent them to Obata with the script set in stone and the panel layout "mostly done." Obata determined the expressions and "camera angles" and created the final artwork. According to Ohba he concentrated on the "tempo" and the amount of dialog; he added that he had difficulty in keeping the text from being too long. Ohba said that he tried to make the story concise and did not want too much text as he believed that "reading too much exposition" would be "tiring" and that it would negatively affect the atmosphere and "air of suspense". Ohba set the basic characteristics of his characters while he allowed for Obata to influence the actual character designs. According to Ohba he did not derive the actual plot idea from one particular source.<ref name="HowtoRead59"/> Regarding the backgrounds and props Ohba said that he put descriptions such as "abandoned building" and let Obata wield most of the creative power regarding the backgrounds and props.<ref name="HTR180">''Death Note: How to Read 13''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 180.</ref>

Ohba said that when he decided on the plot he internally visualized the panels while "rolling around in bed," drinking [[tea]], or walking around his house; Ohba said that he needed to feel relaxed while visualizing the panels. After that he drew the panels on white paper in a "very simple manner." The writer added that on many occasions the draft consisted of too many pages and he had to write drafts "two or three times" to find the desired "tempo" and "flow" for the chapter. Ohba added that he liked to read the previous "two or four" chapters "very carefully" to ensure consistency in the story.<ref name="HowtoRead59"/>

Ohba said that his general weekly schedule consisted of five days to create and think about the creation and then use one day pencil and insert dialog into the rough drafts; according to Ohba, after this point he faxed the drafts to the editor. Obata also described his weekly schedule. He said that he usually took one day with the thumbnails, layout, and pencils and one day with additional penciling and inking. His assistants usually worked for four days and Obata used one day to add "final touches." Obata said that sometimes he took "an extra day or two" to color pages and that this "messed with the schedule." Ohba said that on some occasions he took "three or four" days to create a chapter while on other occasions he took a month to create a chapter. Obata said that his schedule remained consistent except when he had to create color pages.<ref name="HTR192">''Death Note: How to Read 13''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 192.</ref>

Ohba and Obata rarely met in person during the creation of the serialized manga; the two met with the editor, who, according to. The first time they met in person was at an editorial party in January 2004. Obata said that, despite the intrigue, he did not ask his editor about Ohba's plot developments as he anticipated the new thumbnails every week.<ref name="HTR174"/> The two did not discuss the final chapters with one another and they continued to talk with the editor.<ref name="HTR180"/> Ohba said that when he asked the editor if Obata had "said anything" about the story and plot the editor responded '"No, nothing" [''laughs''].'<ref name="HTR180">''Death Note: How to Read 13''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 180.</ref>

Ohba said that the series ended more or less in the manner that he intended for it to end; Ohba considered the idea of [[L (Death Note)|L]] defeating [[Light Yagami]] with Light dying; he instead chose to use the "Yellow Box warehouse" ending. According to Ohba he had the details set "from the beginning."<ref name="HowtoRead58">''Death Note 13: How to Read''. Viz Media. 58.</ref> Ohba wanted an ongoing plot line instead of an episodic series because ''Death Note'' was serialized and that Ohba wanted a series focused on a cast with a series of events triggered by the Death Note.<ref name="HowtoRead60">''Death Note 13: How to Read''. Viz Media. 60.</ref> Ohba used the internet for research and did not go on any research trips.<ref name="HowtoRead61">''Death Note 13: How to Read''. Viz Media. 61.</ref>

''How to Read 13'' states that the humorous aspects of ''Death Note'' originated from Ohba's "enjoyment of humorous stories."<ref name="HTR194">''Death Note: How to Read 13''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 194.</ref>

====General creative process====
For each chapter the creative process began with Ohba and moved to Obata; both authors took advice from the editor.<ref name="HTR189">''Death Note 13: How to Read''. Viz Media. 189.</ref>

Ohba began each segment by creating a rough draft; he said that his main weakness was including too much information in each panel.<ref name="HTR189"/> Once each draft "goes through a few rounds" and the elements "are decided on" Ohba split the panels and "solidified" dialog, monologues, and "everything else." Ohba included "specific art" in thumbnails if he believed it was needed.<ref name="HTR188">''Death Note 13: How to Read''. Viz Media. 188.</ref> Obata took the thumbnails and edited "camera angles" and expressions exhibited by characters. Obata used the thumbnails as models for his final panels. When Obata decided on the content he began drawing. At this point in many cases Obata determined designs of newly-introduced characters and items. After that point, the editor takes the pages and lettering, special effects, and other type are inserted into the pages; at that point the final drafts are finished.<ref name="HTR189"/>

====Collected volumes====
Ohba described writing comments for the collected volumes as the task he liked "the least" and he said that he often "pretty much" wrote comments "really quickly" before the time that the comments were due. He added "I'm sorry." Obata said that he prefers not to write any comments since he is "so bad" at doing that and that he uses as much effort as possible in his comments. Obata said that he sees his comments for Volume 2 and Volume 12 as "pretty good."<ref name="HTR193">''Death Note: How to Read 13''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 193.</ref>

===Pilot chapter===
The ''Death Note'' process began when Ohba brought thumbnails for two concept ideas to [[Shueisha]]; Ohba said that the ''Death Note'' pilot, one of the concepts, became "received well" by editors and attained "positive" reactions by readers.<ref name="HowtoRead 58"/>

Ohba described keeping the story of the pilot to one chapter as "very difficult" and he said that he remembered taking "more than a month" to begin writing the chapter. Ohba added that the story had to revive the killed characters with the Death Eraser and that he "didn't really care" for that plot device.<ref name="HTR215"/>

Obata said that he "really" wanted to draw the story after he heard of a "horror story featuring Shinigami."<ref name="HTR174"/> According to Obata, when he first received the rough draft created by Ohba he "didn't really get it" at first and that he wanted to work on the work due to the presence of Shinigami and that the work "was dark."<ref name="HTR215"/> He also said that he wondered about the progression of the plot as he read the thumbnails and if ''Jump'' readers would enjoy reading the comic. Obata said that while there is little action and that the main character "doesn't really drive the plot" he enjoyed the atmosphere of the story. Obata stated that he drew the pilot chapter "in a way that would appeal to me."<ref name="HTR215">''Death Note: How to Read 13''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 215.</ref>

Ohba brought the rough draft of the pilot chapter to the editorial department. Obata came into the picture at a later point to create the artwork. Ohba and Obata did not meet in person while creating the pilot chapter. Ohba said that the editor told him that Ohba did not need to meet with Obata to discuss the pilot; Ohba said "I think it worked out all right."<ref name="HTR174"/>

=== Conception and design of the Death Notes ===
Obata said that Ohba did not give him suggestions regarding how to design the Death Notes, so Obata possessed free rein. Obata said that he originally thought of the books as "[[Bible]]-like" "something you would automatically think was a Death Note." Obata added that he felt that this design would seem "difficult to use" so he opted for an "easy to use" "college" notebook. Obata said that at a later point he thought of a concept that Death Notes could look different depending on the human era, such as having Death Notes in ancient Japan looking like scrolls and Death Notes in [[medieval Europe]] looking like [[The Old Testament]].<ref name="drawing design 140">"Takeshi Obata Production Note: Characters." ''Death Note: How to Read 13''. [[VIZ Media]]. 140.</ref>

Ohba said that he "randomly" selected numbers for used for various conditions. He said that in some conditions he wished to use the number [[four]] since the word {{nihongo|"four" in [[Japan]]ese|[[Wiktionary:四|四]]|shi}} sounds like the word for {{nihongo|"[[death]]"|[[Wiktionary:死|死]]|shi}};<ref name="HowtoRead 58"/> this association is a form of [[tetraphobia]] common in Asia.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

===Intent with the series===
Ohba said that he did not have a theme that he wished to express throughout the series. Ohba said that if he had to choose one, he would select "Humans will all eventually die and never come back to life, so let's give it our all while we're alive." He said that he did not intend for Death Note to push an ideology or make a statement about good and evil. Ohba said that Near's statement in Volume 12 about deciding right and wrong is closest to his own personal belief. Ohba said that he understands how debate can form from the story; Ohba says that since the answers to the questions raised become "ideological" and that he believes this development would be "dangerous" and not "interesting in a manga" Ohba decided not to include this aspect in ''Death Note''.<ref name="HowtoThink69">"How to Think." ''Death Note How to Read 13''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 69.</ref>

As a response to the interview question "So the series is meant to be all about enjoying the plot twists and psychological warfare" Ohba responded by saying that the statement is the reason why he was "very happy" to place the story in ''Weekly Shōnen Jump''. He said that, because ''Death Note'' is aimed at "the young" the reader can "push back ideology" and focus on "pure entertainment." Ohba said that if he aimed the series at an older audience he would expect "more debate over the issues" and therefore he believed that the story would have had to develop in that direction.<ref name="HowtoThink69"/> ''Death Note: How to Read 13'' states that debate about good and evil "sometimes" appears in the series and that the "answer" to the debate is left for the reader to decide.<ref name="HTR183">''Death Note: How to Read 13''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 183.</ref> 

Ohba responded to the question "If you had to say what the most important thing in ''Death Note'' is, what would it be?" by answering "The human whose name is written in this note shall die" while Obata responded by answering "Impossible to say."<ref name="HTR192"/>

==Production and intent in the anime==
Tetsuro Araki, the director, said that he wished to convey aspects that "made the series interesting" instead of simply "focusing on morals or the concept of justice." Toshiki Inoue, the series organizer, agreed with Araki and added that, in anime adaptations, there is a lot of importance in highlighting the aspects that are "interesting in the original." Inoue concluded that Light's presence was "the most compelling" aspect; therefore the adaptation chronicle's Light's "thoughts and actions as much as possible." Inoue noted that, to best incorporate the manga's plot into the anime, he "tweak"ed "the chronology a bit" and incorporated flashbacks that appear after the openings of the episodes; he said this revealed the desired tensions. Araki said that, because in an anime the viewer cannot "turn back pages" in the manner that a comic reader can, the anime staff ensured that the show clarified details. Inoue added that the staff did not want to get involved with every single detail, so the staff selected elements to emphasize. Due to the complexity of the original manga, Inoue described the process as "definitely" "delicate" "and a great challenge." Inoue admitted that he placed "way more instructions and notes in the script than usual." Araki added that because of the importance of otherwise trivial details, the notes became crucial to the development of the series.<ref name="Passionsdreams">"Passion and dreams." ''[[Newtype USA]]''. November 2007. Volume 6. Number 11. 50-51.</ref>

Araki said that when he discovered the ''Death Note'' anime project, he "literally begged" to join the production team; when he joined he insisted that Inoue should write the scripts. Inoue added that, because he enjoyed reading the original comic, he wished to use his effort.<ref name="Passionsdreams"/>

{{Main|Death Note (film)}}
''Death Note'' was adapted into a two-part [[live-action]] [[film]] released in 2006. The two motion pictures were directed by Shūsuke Kaneko, produced by [[Nippon Television]], and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures Japan. The first movie, ''Death Note'', focuses on episodes 1-9. VIZ Pictures released an English language version(dub) of this film in 300 select theaters for two nights only on May 20 & 21st 2008. The English language version was produced using the voices from the Death Note anime dub. The film was originally rated PG 13 in Japan, but was raised to an R rating in the U.S due to a few choice swear words used in the dub. The English language version of this film is to be released on DVD on September 16, 2008. (it will include both English and Japanese audio with optional English subtitles)

The second movie, ''Death Note the Last Name'', picks up where the first movie ends, carrying the story through episode 25. A third movie, ''[[L: Change the WorLd]]'', premiered in February 2008. It is a spin-off focusing on the last twenty-three days of L's life as he tries to solve the Kira case.

{{main|List of Death Note episodes}}
The ''Death Note'' anime, directed by [[Tetsurō Araki]] and animated by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]], began airing in Japan on October 3, 2006,<ref name="sbook">{{cite web|url=http://www.s-book.net/shueisha/tvguide/|title=Shueisha TV Guide|publisher=[http://www.s-book.net/ S-book.net]|accessdate=2006-11-09|language=Japanese}}</ref> and finished its run on June 26, 2007, totaling 37 twenty-minute episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntv.co.jp/english/pc/ntv-animation.pdf|title=Nippon Television Network Program Catalogue: Animation|accessdate=2006-11-06|format=PDF|pages=4|publisher=[[Nippon Television]]}}</ref> Contrary to the movies, the anime series closely follows the original storyline of the first seven volumes of the [[manga]] (L's arc) then rushes significantly through N's arc by accentuating many action scenes and skipping monologues or long discussions between characters described in the final 5 volumes of the manga series. There are also a few changes on the character designs, adapted by [[Masaru Kitao]], and the order of facts, as well as a few additional scenes not featured in the original manga. It is also set in the year 2007, instead of starting at the year 2003.

''Kira Game'' is a strategy game where the player takes on the role of Kira or L. These are just titles, as any character can be Kira or L. The player will attempt to deduce who their enemy is (Kira will try to uncover L's identity and vice versa). This will play out in 3 phases: Investigation, where the player will discuss the case and clues with other characters; Voting, where each member of the investigation team casts a vote on who they suspect is L or Kira based on the player's performance in the previous phase; L/Kira, where the player can either focus their investigation on one member to see if they are Kira (L part) or force a member off of the team (Kira part).<ref name="game">{{cite web|title=Official Konami Website for Death Note|url=http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/deathnote/|publisher=Konami|accessdate=2007-02-03|language=Japanese}}</ref> The gameplay is very similar to that of the common party game [[Mafia (party game)|Mafia]].

== Reception==
[[Shūsuke Kaneko]], director of the film versions of the series, said that the comic series "barely touches" pain felt by the Death Note's victims, so he decided to use a different focus with the film series.<ref name="Making">"[http://star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2006/10/29/movies/15836968&sec=movies The making]." ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]''.</ref>

[[Tatsuya Fujiwara]], the actor who portrayed Light in the film series, compared the theme of ''Death Note'' to the theme of ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' and viewed ''Death Note'' as a "very eccentric story" that depicts a "very permanent theme."<ref>"[http://www.sinchew-i.com/contests/deathnote/index.phtml?sec=cast CAST]." ''[[Sinchew]]''.</ref>

Tom S. Pepirium of ''[[IGN]]'' said that ''Death Note'''s "heavy serialized nature" is what "makes the show so engaging and discussion worthy."<ref>"[http://tv.ign.com/articles/836/836387p1.html Death Note "Tactics" Review]." ''[[IGN]]''.</ref> Pepirium, saying that translating ''Death Note'' is "no small task," said that Stephen Hedley created a dub with "nothing clunky." Pepirium added that Karl Willems, director of the dub, assembled a "stunning voice cast of professionals" with a "solid tone minus some of the cheesy yelling and screaming of other dubs."<ref>"[http://tv.ign.com/articles/855/855426p1.html Death Note: "Ally" Review]." ''[[IGN]]''.</ref> [[Play (US magazine)|''Play'' magazine]] named ''Death Note'' as the best anime of 2007 in their "2007 Anime Year in Review" feature.<ref>"[http://www.playmagazine.com/animeyir2007/index.html Play Magazine's Anime Year in Review 2007]."</ref> John Powers of the [[NPR]] show ''[[Fresh Air]]'' finds the show "addicting" and equates its similarity to the American TV series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''."<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89999028 Killer Penmanship in 'Death Note']" [[Fresh Air]]</ref>

Douglas Wolk of ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' said that a rumor circulated stating that the creators intended to create ''Death Note'' to last half as long as its actual run; according to Wolk the rumor stated that Ohba and Obata had been persuaded to lengthen the storyline when ''Death Note'''s popularity increased. In addition he said that fans wrote "thousands" of ''Death Note'' [[fan fiction]] stories and posted them on the [[internet]].<ref>Wolk, Douglas. "[http://www.salon.com/books/review/2007/07/26/death_note/print.html Death strip]." ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]''.</ref>

A.E. Sparrow of ''[[IGN]]'' reviewed the novel and gave it a 9.5 out of 10. Sparrow said that the author understood "what made these characters click so well" and "captures everything that made the manga the compelling read that it is." Sparrow said that fans of ''Death Note'' who read ''Another Note'' will "find a welcome home" in the Nisio Isin's work that "adds a few more fun layers" to the ''Death Note'' franchise.<ref>"[http://comics.ign.com/articles/865/865077p1.html Death Note - Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases Review]." ''[[IGN]]''.</ref>

Carl Kimlinger, in ''[[Protoculture Addicts]]'', called ''Death Note'' "morally repellant" and said it "presents a worldview that is both shallow and repulsively misanthropic."<ref name=Kimlinger>Kimlinger, Carl (2008). "Death Note, Vol. 3." ''[[Protoculture Addicts]]'', Issue #97, page 83.</ref>

=== Banishment by People's Republic of China ===

[[Beijing]] has a ban on "horror stories" around schools to protect the "physical and mental health" of students, which includes local adaptations of ''Death Note''.<ref name="Beijing">{{cite news|title=Beijing bans scary stories to protect young|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSPEK30969020070515|accessdate=2007-05-15|date= 2007-05-15|work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> China itself is likewise trying to weed out pirated copies of the books and television series, as well other [[J-Horror|Japanese horror]] magazines, where no legal publication house prints it.

The principal, Chris Roger, sent letters to all the students' parents saying "Regardless of the origin of the book, we take the situation very seriously. The safety of our school family is always our top priority. We treat situations like this the same as if a student called in a bomb threat or brought a weapon to school. While there may not be any serious intent to do anyone harm, we cannot and will not take that chance with our students.
