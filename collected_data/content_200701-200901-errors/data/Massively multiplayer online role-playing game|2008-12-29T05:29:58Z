A '''massively multiplayer online role-playing game''' ('''MMORPG''') is a genre of [[computer role-playing game]]s (CRPGs) in which a large number of [[player (game)|players]] interact with one another in a [[virtual world]]. The term MMORPG was coined by [[Richard Garriott]], the creator of [[Ultima Online]], the game credited with popularizing the genre in 1997.<ref>[http://www.ge-eu.com/games.html Game Entertainment Europe<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://pc.ign.com/articles/759/759391p1.html IGN: Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn Preview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

<!--Please do not squeeze in a mention of your favorite MMORPG in this section. If it is a notable product or part of history, please add it to a later, appropriate section-->

==Common features==
Although modern MMORPGs sometimes differ dramatically from their antecedents, many of them share some basic characteristics.  These include several common themes: some form of progression, social interaction within the game, in-game culture, system architecture, and character customization. Characters can often be customized quite extensively, both in the technical and visual aspects, with new choices often added over time by the developers. Many games also offer some form of [[Mod (computer gaming)|modding]] in order to allow for even greater flexibility of choice.

Character abilities are often very specific due to this. Depending on the particular game, the specialties might be as basic as simply having a greater affinity in one statistic, gaining certain bonuses of in-game resources related in-game race, job, etc.

===Themes===
The majority of popular MMORPGs are based on traditional [[fantasy]] themes, often occurring in an in-game universe comparable to that of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.<ref name="MMORPG blog?"/> Some employ hybrid themes that either merge or substitute fantasy elements with those of [[science fiction]], [[sword and sorcery]], or [[crime fiction]].  Still others use more obscure themes, including [[American comic books]], the [[occult]], and other recognizable literary [[genres]].<ref name="MMORPG blog?"/> Often these elements are developed using similar tasks and scenarios involving [[quest (gaming)|quests]],<ref name="MMORPG blog?"/> [[Mob (computer gaming)|monsters]], and [[Looting (gaming)|loot]]. As the MMORPG genre matures, and the search for new consumer niches continues, this variety can only be expected to diversify.

===Progression===
[[Image:Eq2 level 60 mount.jpg|thumb|260px|A highly progressed character from ''[[EverQuest 2]]'', with mount.]]
In nearly all MMORPGs, the development of the player's character is a primary goal.<ref name="MMORPG blog?"/> Many MMORPGs feature a character progression system in which players earn [[experience points]] for their actions and use those points to reach character "levels", which makes them better at whatever they do.<ref name="MMORPG blog?"/> Traditionally, combat with [[Mob (computer gaming)|monsters]] and completing quests for [[Non-player character|NPC]]s, either alone or in groups, is the primary way to earn experience points.  The accumulation of wealth (including combat-useful items) is also a way to progress in many titles, and again, this is traditionally best accomplished via combat. The cycle produced by these conditions, combat leading to new items allowing for more combat with no change in gameplay, is sometimes pejoratively referred to as the [[level treadmill]],<ref name="MMORPG blog?"/> or 'grinding'. The role-playing game ''[[Progress Quest]]'' was created as a parody of this trend.

Also, traditional in the genre is the eventual demand on players to team up with others in order to progress at the optimal rate.  This sometimes forces players to change their real-world schedules in order to "keep up" within the game-world.

===Social Interaction===
{{mainarticle|Social Interaction via MMORPGs}}
MMORPGs almost always allow players to communicate with one another.  Depending on the other interactions allowed by the game, other social expectations will be present.

====Teamwork====

Many MMORPGs exploit their players' social skills and offer support for in-game [[Clan (computer gaming)|guilds<span style="color:black"> or </span>clans]] (though these will usually form whether the game supports them or not).<ref name="MMORPG blog?"/> As a result, many players will find themselves as either a member or a leader of such a group after playing an MMORPG for some time. These organizations will likely have further expectations for their members (such as intra-guild assistance).

Even if players never join a formal group, they are still usually expected to be a part of a small [[team]] during game play, and will probably be expected to carry out a specialized role (such as healing).  In combat-based MMORPGs, usual roles include the "[[Tank (computer gaming)|tank]]", a character who absorbs enemy blows and protects other members of the team, the "[[Healer (computer gaming)|healer]]", a character responsible for keeping up the health of the party,<ref name="MMORPG blog roles">{{cite web

}}</ref> the "DPS (Damage Per Second)," a character specializing in inflicting damage, and sometimes the "CC (Crowd Control)," a character who temporarily controls the opponent, such as the "[[NPC]]" (Non-Player Character), and making the opponent lose its control of actions and abilities.  Other common roles include being a dedicated "[[Buff (MMORPG terminology)|buffer]]" or "debuffer", using abilities that affect the team or the opponents in other ways.  Any given MMORPG might allow players to take on all of these roles, additional hybrid roles, or none of them.  Despite the variability, some players might enjoy one role over others and continue to play it through many different MMORPG titles.

====Roleplaying====
Some MMORPGs also may expect players to [[roleplay]] their characters – that is, to speak and act in the way their character would act, even if it means shying away from other goals such as wealth or experience. However, as this behavior is far from being the norm, most MMORPG players never actually play the roles of their characters.<ref name="NO RP">{{cite web

}}</ref> Still, MMORPGs may offer "RP-only" servers for those who wish to immerse themselves in the game in this way.

MMORPG's generally have Game Moderators or Game Masters (frequently abbreviated to GM), which may be paid employees or unpaid volunteers who attempt to supervise the world. Some GMs may have additional access to features and information related to the game that are not available to other players and roles.

===Culture===
<!--This use of this image has no rationale on the image's page. Please read [[Wikipedia:NFCC#10c]] [[Image:Modified WoW User Interface.jpg|thumb|260px|A level 70 (currently the highest level attainable) character from ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', with a heavily modified user interface.]]-->
Since MMORPGs have so many elements in common, and those elements are experienced by so many people, a common culture of MMORPGs has developed which exists in addition to the culture present within any given game.  For example, since MMORPGs often feature many different character "classes", the games must be balanced in order to be fair to all players, and this has led players of many games to expect "Buffing" or "Nerfing", which is a term describing the strengthening or weakening of a subset of players, respectively.

As another example, in many older MMORPGs the fastest way to progress was simply by killing the same monsters over and over again, and as this is still common in the genre all MMORPG players know the process as "[[grind (gaming)|grinding]]".  The importance of grinding in MMORPGs, and how much "fun" it contributes to the experience, is constantly debated.  Many MMORPGs have taken steps to eliminate or reduce grinding, but few such attempts have met with success, and it is generally accepted by players and developers alike that some amount of 'grind' is required to maintain a stable playing experience.

[[Video game addiction|MMORPG addiction]], which has been a source of concern for parents,<ref>[http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070729/ENTERTAINMENT/707290400/-1/LOCAL17 Indystar on game addiction]</ref> also affects the culture. Some players might look down on those who invest huge amounts of time into a game, while others might scorn those who can't put in the time to "play properly.".  The validity of such viewpoints is heavily debated, with both sides of the issue being discussed frequently on most games' forums.

===System architecture===
Most MMORPGs are deployed using a [[client-server]] system architecture. The software that generates and persists the "world" runs continuously on a server, and players connect to it via client software. The client software may provide access to the entire playing world, or further 'expansions' may be required to be purchased to allow access to certain areas of the game.  [[Everquest]] and [[World of Warcraft]] are two examples of games that use such a format. Players generally must purchase the client software for a one-time fee, although an increasing trend is for MMORPGs to work using pre-existing "thin" clients, such as a web browser. 

Some MMORPGs require payment of a monthly subscription to play. By nature, "[[massively multiplayer]]" games are always online, and most require some sort of continuous revenue (such as monthly subscriptions and advertisements) for maintenance and development. Some games, such as Guild Wars, have disposed of the 'monthly fee' model entirely, and recover costs directly through sales of the software and associated expansion packs.

Depending on the number of players and the system architecture, a MMORPG might actually be run on multiple separate servers, each representing an independent world, where players from one server cannot interact with those from another; World of Warcraft is a prominent example, with each separate server housing several thousand players.  In many MMORPGs the number of players in one world is often limited to around a few thousand, but a notable example of the opposite is [[EVE Online]] which accommodated around 20,000 players in the same world as of August 2007 and 41,690 users online in December 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eve-online.com/news/newsOfEve.asp?newsID=505|title=EVE Online: Breaks The Wall Yet Again!|}}</ref> Some games allow characters to appear on any world, but not simultaneously (such as Seal Online: Evolution), others limit each character to the world in which it was created.

==History==
[[Image:MUDscreen.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[MUD]], an early multi-user roleplaying game]]
{{main|History of massively multiplayer online role-playing games}}
Although MMORPGs, as defined today, have only existed since the early 1990s,<ref name="MMORPG?"/> all MMORPGs can trace a lineage back to the earliest multi-user games which started appearing in the late 1970s.<ref name="MMORPG?"/> The first of these was ''[[Mazewar]]'', though more would soon be developed for the [[PLATO system]].<ref name="Koster's Timeline">{{cite web
| url =http://www.raphkoster.com/gaming/mudtimeline.shtml
| title =Online World Timeline
| accessdate = 2007-04-03
| last =Koster
| first =Raph}}</ref> 1984 saw a [[Roguelike]] (semi-graphical) multi-user game, called ''[[Islands of Kesmai]]''.<ref name="Koster's Timeline"/>  The first "truly" graphical multi-user RPG was ''[[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|Neverwinter Nights]]'', which was delivered through [[America Online]] in 1991 and was personally championed by AOL President [[Steve Case]].<ref name="Koster's Timeline"/>  Other early proprietary graphical MMORPGs include three on [[The Sierra Network]]: [[The Shadow of Yserbius]] in 1992, ''The Fates of Twinion'' in 1993, and [[The Ruins of Cawdor]] in 1995.

When [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET]] restrictions were lifted in 1995, the Internet was opened up to developers, which allowed for the first really "massive" titles.  The first success after this point was ''[[Meridian 59]]'', which also featured first-person 3D graphics,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meridian59.com/|title=Welcome to the world of Meridian 59!|accessdate = 2007-04-03}}</ref> although ''[[The Realm Online]]'' appeared nearly simultaneously and may be credited with bringing the genre to a wider player-base.<ref name="Koster's Timeline"/>  ''[[Ultima Online]]'', released in 1997, may be credited with first popularizing the genre,<ref name="Koster's Timeline"/> though ''[[Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds]]'' was primarily responsible for mainstream attention throughout Asia which was released in 1996, about a year earlier than Ultima Online. It was ''[[EverQuest]]'' that brought MMORPGs to the mainstream in the West.<ref name="Koster's Timeline"/>

These early titles' financial success has ensured competition in the genre since that time. MMORPG titles now exist on [[video game console|consoles]] and in new settings, and their players enjoy higher-quality gameplay. The current market for MMORPGs has [[Blizzard]]'s ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' dominating as the largest pay-to-play MMORPG<ref>{{cite web |last =Snow |first =Blake |title =World of Warcraft addicts 10 million subscribers |publisher =GamePro.com |date =2008-01-23 |url =http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=157968 |accessdate =2008-06-15}}</ref>, alongside earlier such titles like ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' and ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'', though an additional market exists for [[free-to-play]] MMORPGs, which are supported by advertising and purchases of in-game items. This free-to-play model is particularly common in [[Korea]]n MMORPGs such as ''[[MapleStory]]'' and ''[[Rohan: Blood Feud]]''. One exception, however, is ''[[Guild Wars]]'', which avoids competition with other MMORPGs by only requiring the initial purchase of the game to play.

==Psychology==

Since the interactions between MMORPG players are real, even if the environments are virtual, [[psychologist]]s and [[sociologist]]s are able to use MMORPGs as tools for academic research. [[Sherry Turkle]], a clinical psychologist, has conducted interviews with computer users including game-players.  Turkle found that many people have expanded their emotional range by exploring the many different roles (including gender identities) that MMORPGs allow a person to explore.<ref name="turkle">Sherry Turkle (1997), Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet, ISBN 0-684-83348-4</ref>

[[Nick Yee]] has surveyed more than 35,000 MMORPG players over the past several years, focusing on psychological and sociological aspects of these games. Recent findings included that 15% of players become a guild-leader at one time or another, but most generally find the job tough and thankless;<ref name="yee1">{{cite web |url= http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001516.php|title= Life as a Guild Leader|accessdate = 2007-05-16 |author = Yee, Nick|authorlink= Nick Yee|coauthors= |date=2006-03-20 |work= The Daedalus Project}}</ref> and that players spend a considerable amount of time (often a third of their total time investment) doing things that are external to gameplay but part of the [[metagame]].<ref name="yee2">{{cite web |url= http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001535.php|title= Time Spent in the Meta-Game|accessdate = 2007-05-16 |author = Yee, Nick|authorlink= Nick Yee|coauthors= |date=2006-08-29 |work= The Daedalus Project}}</ref>

Many players report that the emotions they feel while playing a MMORPG are very strong, to the extent that 8.7% of male and 23.2% of female players in a statistical study have had an online wedding.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/000467.php|title= An Ethnography of MMORPG Weddings|accessdate = 2007-05-16 |author = Yee, Nick|authorlink= Nick Yee|coauthors= |date=2006-08-29 |work= The Daedalus Project}}</ref> Other researchers have found that the enjoyment of a game is directly related to the social organization of a game, ranging from brief encounters between players to highly organized play in structured groups.<ref name="nardi harris">Nardi, Harris (2006), Strangers and Friends: Collaborative Play in World of Warcraft, Proceedings of the 2006 20th anniversary conference on Computer supported cooperative work</ref>


In a study by Zaheer Hussain, B.Sc., M.Sc. and Mark D. Griffiths, Ph.D., it was found that just over one in five gamers (21%) said they preferred socializing online to offline. Significantly more male gamers than female gamers said that they
found it easier to converse online than offline. It was also found that 57% of gamers had created a character of the opposite gender, and it is suggested that the online female persona has a number of positive social attributes.  <ref name="hussain zaheer">Hussain, Zaheer (2008), Gender Swapping and Socializing in Cyberspace: An Exploratory Study</ref>

[[Richard Bartle]] classified multiplayer RPG-players into four primary psychological groups.  His classifications were then expanded upon by Erwin Andreasen, who developed the concept into the thirty-question [[Bartle Test]] that helps players determine which category they are associated with.  With over 200,000 test responses as of 2006, this is perhaps the largest ongoing survey of multiplayer game players.<ref name="bartletest">Bartle Test of Gamer Psychology, http://www.gamerdna.com/bartle.php</ref>

In ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', a temporary programming glitch attracted the attention of psychologists and epidemiologists across North America, when the "[[Corrupted Blood]]" ability of a monster began to spread unintentionally -- and uncontrollably -- into the wider game world. The Center for Disease Control used the incident as a research model to chart both the progression of a disease, and the potential human response to large-scale epidemic infection.<ref name="CDCP">{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2005-01-04 |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=131791 |title=Looking Back...

==Economics==
{{see also|Real-money trading}}
[[Image:evemarketscreen.png|thumb|280px|right|A user browsing the market for items in [[EVE Online]]]]

Many MMORPGs feature living economies. Virtual items and currency have to be gained through play and have definite value for players.<ref name="Development of Economy">{{cite web| url =http://www.devmaster.net/articles/mmo-economy/part1.php| title =Tips on Developing an MMO Economy, Part I| accessdate = 2007-04-21| last =Privantu| first =Radu| date =[[2007-02-17]]| format = | work = | publisher =DevMaster.net}}</ref> Such a [[virtual economy]] can be analyzed (using data logged by the game)<ref name="Development of Economy" /> and has value in economic research; more significantly, these "virtual" economies can have an impact on the economies of the real world. 

One of the early researchers of MMORPGs was [[Edward Castronova]], who demonstrated that a supply-and-demand market exists for virtual items and that it crosses over with the real world.<ref>Castronova, Edward. Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games. ISBN 0-226-09626-2, University Of Chicago Press</ref> This crossover has some requirements of the game:
* The ability for players to sell an item to each other for in-game (virtual) currency.
* Bartering for items between players for items of similar value.
* The purchase of in-game items for real-world currency.
* Exchanges of real-world currencies for virtual currencies.
* The creation of meta-currencies such as DKP, or [[Dragon kill points]], to distribute in-game rewards.<ref>Castronova (2007), Dragon Kill Points: a Summary White Paper, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945</ref>

The idea of attaching real-world value to "virtual" items has had a profound effect on players and the game industry, and even the courts. Castronova's first study in 2002 found that a highly liquid (if illegal) currency market existed, with the value of ''Everquest'''s in-game currency exceeding that of the Japanese yen.<ref name="CurrencyExchange">{{cite web |url= http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,55982,00.html|title= Online Game Economies Get Real|accessdate = 2007-05-16 |author=  Whiting, Jason|date= 2002-11-06|publisher= [[Wired News]]}}</ref> Some people even make a living by working these virtual economies; these people are often referred to as [[gold farming|gold farmers]], and may be employed in [[game sweatshop]]s.<ref name="Wage Slaves">{{cite web |url= http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3141815|title= Wage Slaves|accessdate = 2007-04-21 |author= Lee, James|date= 2005-07-05|publisher= 1UP.com}}</ref>

Game publishers usually prohibit the exchange of real-world money for virtual goods, but others actively promote the idea of linking (and directly profiting from) an exchange. In ''[[Second Life]]'' and ''[[Entropia Universe]]'',  the virtual economy and the real-world economy are directly linked.  This means that real money can be deposited for game money and vice versa.  Real-world items have also been sold for game money in ''Entropia'', and some players of ''Second Life'' have generated revenues in excess of $100,000.<ref name="SecondLifeEconomy">{{cite web |url= http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982001.htm|title= My Virtual Life |accessdate = 2007-05-16 |author= Hof, Robert|date= 2006-05-01|publisher= BusinessWeek}}</ref>

Some of the issues confronting online economies include:

* The use of "bots" or automated programs, that assist some players in accumulating in-game wealth to the disadvantage of other players.<ref name="bots">Robert Shapiro (2003), How online games teach us about economics, http://www.slate.com/id/2078053/</ref>

* The use of unsanctioned auction sites, which has led publishers to seek legal remedies to prevent their use based on intellectual-property claims.<ref name="stopauctions">Blizzard Goes to War, http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2004/12/blizzard_goes_t.html</ref>

* The emergence of [[virtual crime]], which can take the form of both fraud against the player or publisher of an online game, and even real-life acts of violence stemming from in-game transactions.<ref>BBC News (2005), Game Theft led to Fatal Attack, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4397159.stm</ref>

Linking real-world and virtual economies is rare in MMORPGs, as it is generally believed to be detrimental to gameplay. If real-world wealth can be used to obtain greater, more immediate rewards than skillful gameplay, the incentive for strategic roleplay and real game involvement is diminished. It could also easily lead to a skewed hierarchy where richer players gain better items, allowing them to take on stronger opponents and level up more quickly than less wealthy but more committed players.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.danwei.org/electronic_games/gambling_your_life_away_in_zt.php|title=Gamble your life away in ZT Online}}</ref>

==Development==

[[Image:Devious2.png|thumb|280px|right|[[Runescape|DeviousMUD]], the unreleased forerunner to MMORPG [[RuneScape]], was created as an attempt at a graphical [[MUD]].]]

The cost of developing a competitive commercial MMORPG title often exceeds $10 million.<ref name="devcost">Adam Carpenter (2003), Applying Risk-Based Analysis to Play Balance RPGs, Gamasutra, http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20030611/carpenter_01.shtml</ref>  These projects require multiple disciplines within game design and development such as 3D modeling, 2D art, animation, user interfaces, client/server engineering, database architecture, and network infrastructure.<ref>Jon Radoff (2007), "Anatomy of an MMORPG," '' PlayerVox,'' http://radoff.com/blog/2008/08/22/anatomy-of-an-mmorpg/</ref>

The front-end (or client) component of a commercial, modern MMORPG features 3D graphics.  As with other modern 3D games, the front-end requires expertise with implementing [[3D engine]]s, real-time [[shader]] techniques and physics simulation.  The actual visual content (areas, creatures, characters, weapons, spaceships and so forth) is developed by artists who typically begin with two-dimensional concept art, and later convert these concepts into animated 3D scenes, models and texture maps.<ref name="3d game design">Frank Luna (2006), "3D Game Programming with DirectX 9.0c, a Shader Approach," Worldware Publishing, ISBN 1-59822-016-0</ref>

Developing an MMOG server requires expertise with client/server architecture, network protocols, security, and relational database design.  MMORPGs include reliable systems for a number of vital tasks.  The server must be able to handle and verify a large number of connections, prevent [[Cheating in online games|cheating]], and apply changes (bug fixes or added content) to the game.  A system for recording the game's data at regular intervals, without stopping the game, is also important.<ref name="game server">Jay Lee (2003), Gamasutra, Relational Database Guidelines for MMOGs, http://www.gamasutra.com/resource_guide/20030916/lee_01.shtml</ref>

Maintenance requires sufficient [[Server (computing)|server]]s and [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], and a dedicated support staff.  Insufficient resources for maintenance lead to [[lag]] and frustration for the players, and can severely damage the reputation of a game, especially at launch.  Care must also be taken to ensure that player population remains at an acceptable level by adding or removing servers ("shards").  [[Peer-to-peer]] MMORPGs could theoretically work cheaply and efficiently in regulating server load, but practical issues such as asymmetrical network bandwidth and CPU-hungry rendering engines make them a difficult proposition. Additionally, they would probably become vulnerable to other problems including new possibilities for [[cheating in online games|cheating]].  The hosted infrastructure for a commercial-grade MMORPG requires the deployment of hundreds (or even thousands) of servers.  Developing an affordable infrastructure for an online game requires developers to scale to large numbers of players with less hardware and network investment.<ref name="architecture">GDC Proceedings 2005, Online Game Architecture: Back-End Strategies, http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050310/esbensen_01.shtml</ref>

In addition, the development team will need to have expertise with the fundamentals of game design: world-building, lore and game mechanics,<ref name="game fundamentals">Chris Crawford (2003), Chris Crawford on Game Design, New Riders Games, ISBN 0-13-146099-4</ref> as well as what makes games fun.<ref name="fun games">Koster and Wright (2004), "A Theory of Fun for Game Design," Paraglyph Press, ISBN 1-932111-97-2</ref>

===Non-corporate development===
Though the vast majority of MMORPGs are produced by companies, many small teams of programmers and artists have attempted to contribute to the genre. As shown above, the average MMORPG development project requires enormous investments of time and money, and running the game can be a long-term commitment.  As a result, non-corporate (or independent, or "[[Indie game|indie]]") development of MMORPGs is less common compared with other genres.  Still, many independent MMORPGs do exist, representing a wide spectrum of genres, gameplay types, and revenue systems.

Some independent MMORPG projects are completely [[open source]], while others like ''[[PlaneShift]]'' feature proprietary content made with an open-source game engine. The developers of ''Endless Online'' have also released development information with details about their coding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.endless-online.com/information.html|title=Endless Online Technical Information|accessmonthday=11|accessdaymonth=March|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

The [[WorldForge]] project has been active since 1998 and formed a community of independent developers who are working on creating framework for a number of open-source MMORPGs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldforge.org/doc/history|title=WorldForge History|accessmonthday=11|accessdaymonth =March|accessyear=2007|first=Bryce|}}</ref> The [[Multiverse Network]] is also creating a network and platform specifically for independent MMOG developers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multiverse.net/about/index.jsp?cid=5&scid=0|title=About Multiverse|accessmonthday=11|accessdaymonth=March|accessyear=2007|publisher=[[Multiverse]]}}</ref>

==Trends as of 2008==
As there are a number of wildly different titles within the genre, and since the genre develops so rapidly, it is difficult to definitively state that the genre is heading in one direction or another.  Still, there are a few obvious developments. One of these developments is the [[raid (gaming)|raid]] group quest, or "raid",<ref name="raid trend">{{cite web |url= http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/1028|title= Casual Play: Raiding Needs to Die|accessdate = 2007-05-02 |author= Wilson, Steve|date=December 14, 2006}}</ref> which is an adventure designed for large groups of players (often twenty or more).

=== Instance dungeons ===
Another is the use of [[instance dungeons]]. These are game areas that are "copied" for individual groups, which keeps that group separated from the rest of the game world.  This reduces competition, and also has the effect of reducing the amount of data that needs to be sent to and from the server, which reduces lag.  ''[[World of Warcraft]]'''s "raids", mentioned above, are often instance dungeons, as are all of the combat areas in ''[[Guild Wars]]''. Also the creators of ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'' introduced an instanced dungeon called ''Endless Tower''. This is, however, the only instanced dungeon in the game. The ''[[Dungeon Runners]]'' is, like Guild Wars, instanced, excluding Player vs Player areas.

=== Solo play===
Although these games are multiplayer, and intended to be played in groups for the best experience, most now provide solo content, or adventures a [[player character]] can do on their own.  It can be difficult to find a group to adventure with, and this allows people to play the game without waiting around in safe areas like cities for a long period of time.  This change turned out to be popular, and some of the older MMORPGs such as [[Dungeons & Dragons Online]] were [[retrofitted]] to make [[Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Online#Update_1.2:_Solo_Enhancements|solo play easier]].  Adding to the popularity is a side effect: some people prefer to solo.  To encourage players to continue grouping, many games reward grouping by giving grouped players bonuses such as more [[experience points]] than they would otherwise get soloing.

=== Player-created content ===
Increased amounts of "Player-created content" may be another trend.<ref name="player content trend">Jon Radoff (March 20, 2007), Gamasutra, Five Prescriptions for Viral Games, http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070320/radoff_01.shtml</ref> From the beginning, the Ultima Online world included blank 30-page books that players could write in, collect into personal libraries and trade; in later years players have been able to design and build houses from the ground up. Some non-combat-based MMORPGs rely heavily on player-created content, including everything from simple animations to complete buildings using player-created textures and architecture like ''[[A Tale in the Desert]]''.  However, these games are very different from the far more popular "standard" MMORPGs revolving around combat and limited character trade skills.  Player-created content in these games would be in the form of areas to explore, monsters to kill, quests to carry out and specific in-game items to obtain. ''[[The Saga of Ryzom]]'' was the first of these "standard" MMORPGs to offer players the ability to create this type of content.

=== Use of licenses ===
The use of licenses, common in other video game genres, has also appeared in MMORPGs. 2007 saw the release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', based on [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]]. Other licensed MMORPGs include ''[[The Matrix Online]]'', based on the ''Matrix'' trilogy of films, ''[[Warhammer Online]]'', based on [[Games Workshop]]s [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle|tabletopgame]], ''[[Star Trek Online]]'', ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' and ''[[Age of Conan]]''. Additionally, several licenses from television have been optioned for MMORPGs, for example ''[[Stargate Worlds]]'', which is currently in development. The process is also apparently being applied in reverse, with [[James Cameron]] designing an MMORPG that will ''precede'' the film (''[[Project 880]]'') to which it is tied.<ref name="Cameron">James Cameron's Game Theory, Business Week (February 13, 2006) http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_07/b3971073.htm</ref>

=== Console-based MMORPGs ===
Although console MMORPGs are considered more difficult<ref name="no console mmo">{{cite web
