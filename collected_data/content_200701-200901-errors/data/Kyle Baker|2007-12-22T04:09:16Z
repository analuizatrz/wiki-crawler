==Biography==
===Early life and career===
As a [[high school]] [[intern]] at [[Marvel Comics]], Baker came into contact with such artists as [[John Romita, Jr.]], [[Al Milgrom]] and [[Walter Simonson]]. He eventually became an assistant [[inker]], working on backgrounds. He got further inking work at Marvel while attending the [[School of Visual Arts]].  Finding himself already gainfully employed in comics and illustration, he eventually dropped out of SVA. <!--His inking style was very loose, and even at this early stage his art stood out from the standard Marvel fare.-->

===Comics and graphic novels===
The Dolphin imprint of the publishing house [[Doubleday]] expressed interest in his ''Cowboy Wally'' comic strips, which he expanded into a 128-page graphic novel published in 1988.  Baker went on to draw the pulp revival series ''The Shadow'' and ''[[The Avenger#DC Comics|Justice, Inc.]]'' for [[DC Comics]], as well as the [[Classics Illustrated]] series ''Through the Looking Glass'' and ''Cyrano''.  In 1990, Baker released two graphic novels, one an  adaptation of the [[film]] ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', the other an original story, ''Why I Hate Saturn''.    <!--He went to Los Angeles, where he wrote a TV show called "Cosmic Slop" for HBO.  NOTE: Not according to IMDb or other sources--> He next spent three years illustrating the weekly strip "Bad Publicity" for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine. in 1994, Baker directed an animated video featuring the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] singer [[KRS-ONE]]<!--spelling per http://www.krs-one.com/-->, called "Break The Chain".

Baker's other [[graphic novel]]s as writer-artist include ''You Are Here'', ''King David'', and ''I Die At Midnight''.  He has also illustrated a graphic novel written by [[Aaron McGruder]] and [[Reginald Hudlin]] titled ''Birth of a Nation''.

===Later career===
Beginning in the [[1990s]], Baker's cartoons and [[caricatures]] began appearing in ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[ESPN]], ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Guitar World]]'', ''[[MAD Magazine]]'', ''[[National Lampoon]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Spin magazine]]'',  ''[[Us (magazine)|Us]]'', ''[[VIBE|Vibe]]'' and ''[[The Village Voice]]''. His animation has appeared on [[BET]] and [[MTV]], and in animated ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' projects<!--something more specific here, please-->.

For mainstream comics in the [[2000s]], Baker drew the miniseries ''Truth,'' a [[Captain America]] storyline with parallels to the infamous [[Tuskegee experiment]], later collected as a [[trade paperback]]. He also wrote and drew the comedic adventures of the DC Comics [[superhero]] [[Plastic Man]], and was one of contributors to the [[Dark Horse Comics]] series ''[[Michael Chabon]] Presents...The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist,'' a spin-off of Chabon's [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel, ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay]]''.

In 2006, his company, Kyle Baker Publishing, serialized a four-part comic book series about [[Nat Turner]], and published the series ''The Bakers'', based on his family life.
