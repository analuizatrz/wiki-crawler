'''El Al Israel Airlines''' (אל על, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''Skyward'') is the national [[airline]] of [[Israel]]. From their hub at [[Tel Aviv|Tel Aviv's]] [[Ben Gurion International Airport]], El Al operates international scheduled passenger flights to [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[North America]], [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], as well as international cargo flights through their cargo branch, [[El Al Cargo]].

== History ==

The airline was established on [[15 November]] [[1948]] and started operations in [[August]] [[1949]] with a service from [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Rome]] and [[Paris]], extended a year later to [[London]]. Non-stop Tel Aviv to [[New York]] services were introduced on [[15 June]] [[1961]], when its [[Boeing 707]] set the world record for the longest non-stop commercial flight covering 5,760 miles in 9 hours and 33 minutes. On [[24 May]] [[1991]] an El Al [[Boeing 747]] airlifted a record-breaking 1,087 passengers – [[Ethiopian Jews]] flying from [[Addis Ababa]] to Israel as part of [[Operation Solomon]]. In [[February]] [[1995]] El Al left the technical receivership it had been operating under since [[1982]].

The first phase of a long delayed [[privatisation]] was initiated in [[June]] [[2003]] when 15% of the airline's shares were listed on the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]]. [[Arkia Israel Airlines]] parent company, [[Knafaim-Arkia Holdings]], acquired a large stake in mid-2004 and intends to take complete ownership. The owners are Knafaim-Arkia Holdings (40%), private investors (30%) and the state (30%). It employs 5,417 staff.

In late [[2006]], following a strike that temporarily shut down the airline at the end of November, El Al decided to fly some of their planes on [[Shabbat]] in order to get back on schedule. This led to a large-scale [[Haredi]] boycott of the airline. On [[5 January]] [[2007]], a deal was signed between El Al and the Haredi community, which stated that El Al will not fly on Shabbat.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/810030.html | title=El Al, ultra-Orthodox sign deal to end dispute over Shabbat flights | accessdate=2007-01-05 | publisher=Haaretz}}</ref>

In [[January]] [[2007]], El Al signed cooperation agreements with [[Austrian Airlines]], [[Lufthansa]], and [[Swiss International Airlines]], and announced that they would schedule their flights to enable shorter waiting times for passengers on connecting flights. El Al also opened a new [[King David Lounge]] at [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]]. New lounges at [[Heathrow Airport]] and [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] will open later this year.

==Security==

El Al has the reputation for being the most secure airline in the world for the following reasons:

===On the plane===

Approximately six undercover agents (formerly two; exact numbers are never given for security purposes) accompany each international El Al flight, sitting amongst passengers with hidden firearms. Most El Al pilots are former [[Israeli Air Force]] fighter pilots, and all El Al flight crew members are trained in hand-to-hand combat. In fact, most El Al employees have served in the [[Israel Defense Force]] (since national service is compulsory in Israel for most citizens).

El Al [[airline]]rs have double doors to keep passengers away from the [[aviator|pilot]]s. A [[password|code]] is necessary to access the doors, the second door will only be opened after the first has closed and the person has been identified by the [[captain]] or copilot.

There are reinforced [[steel]] floors separating the [[passenger]] [[cabin]] from the [[baggage]] hold <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&ObjectID=10396216 | title=Flying under the eagle eyes of El Al's famed high security | accessdate=2006-08-15 | publisher=New Zealand Herald}}</ref>. This is intended to strengthen the plane in case of an explosion in the hold or vice versa.

The El Al fleet is also the only commercial airline fleet in the world to be equipped with anti-missile [[countermeasures]] (the radar-based ''[[Flight Guard]]'' system). [[Switzerland]] has refused El Al flights landing rights because of fears that [[flares]] dropped by such an automated system might cause fires on the ground near airports, and other European governments have expressed similar views.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3221013,00.html | title=Europe objects to El Al's anti-missile shield | accessdate=2006-11-12 | publisher=YNet News}}</ref> El Al does not comment about the specifications of these systems.

===On the ground===

Passengers are asked to report three hours before takeoff. In Israel, they are checked at a security barrier on the road to the terminal. All El Al terminals around the world are closely monitored by security agents in plain clothes, who patrol the premises for explosives, suspicious behavior, and other threats. Inside, passengers and their baggage are checked by a trained team. El Al security procedures also require that all passengers be interviewed individually prior to boarding, allowing El Al staff to identify possible security threats with probing questions, such as their origin, goal and occupation. The likelihood of potential terrorists maintaining their calmness under such inquisitive probing is considered low. All passengers are classified on a basic 3 tier threat scale: [[Israeli]]s and [[Jew]]s are usually classified as the lowest threat, Westerners are usually classified as medium level threats, and [[Arabs]] (particularly males) are usually classified as high threat due to the overwhelming majority of attacks against Israeli targets having been carried out by Arab individuals in the past.

At the [[check-in]] counter, ground staff scrutinise the [[passport]] and the [[ticket]]. They will not accept a ticket without a sticker from the [[security]] checkers. Once through passport control, where the person's name is checked through a computer, which utilizes information from both the [[FBI]] and [[Scotland Yard]] terrorism databases, the person and their hand luggage go through rigorous screening, including hand searches. In addition, all luggage must pass through a decompression chamber; this simulates pressures during flight which may be triggers for explosives <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.segl.com/xj.php | title=El Al Decompression Chamber | accessdate=2006-07-18 | publisher=Simcoe Engineering Group Limited}}</ref>. El Al is the only airline in the world that passes all luggage through such a chamber. Even in airports in the United States, El Al security agents conduct all luggage searches personally, though they are often supervised by government or private security firms who otherwise have screening responsibilities.

== Incidents and accidents ==

Since 1970, El Al has never fallen victim to a successful terrorist attack on board any of its aircraft. 

*On [[27 July]] [[1955]] an El Al [[Lockheed Constellation]] plane was shot down over [[Bulgaria]]. All the crew and passengers were killed.

*On [[23 July]] [[1968]], an El Al 707 carrying 10 crew and 38 passengers was the target of the first Arab hijacking of an El Al plane. Three members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) hijacked the plane which was [[enroute]] from [[Rome]], [[Italy]], to [[Lod]], [[Israel]], and diverted it to [[Algiers]]. The negotiations extended over 40 days. Both the hijackers and the 21 Israeli hostages ultimately went free. This was the first and only successful hijacking of an El Al flight. The hijackers left from Beirut armed, with the full consent of the Lebanese authorities. Accordingly, Israel held Lebanon accountable, and retaliated on [[28 December]] [[1968]] when it raided [[Lebanon|Lebanon's]] airport and destroyed 13 planes on the ground, most of which belonged to [[Middle East Airlines]].

*Passengers and crew foiled a hijacking attempt on an El Al plane in [[1970]]. This was part of the [[Dawson's Field hijackings]].

*In the [[Hindawi Affair]] on [[18 April]] [[1986]], a pregnant Irishwoman named [[Anne Mary Murphy]] was about to board an El Al flight at [[London]]'s [[Heathrow Airport]] when her bag was found to contain 3 pounds of plastic explosives. The explosives had been planted by her fiancé [[Nezar Hindawi]] who was to go on a separate flight. Hindawi was jailed for 45 years, the longest sentence ever delivered by a British court. Murphy, who had been duped, later gave birth to their daughter. There was evidence that [[Syrian]] officials were involved. Britain cut off diplomatic relations with Syria.

*On [[4 October]], [[1992]], [[El Al Flight 1862]], a Boeing 747-200F cargo plane, crashed into the Groeneveen and Klein-Kluitberg flats in [[Bijlmermeer]], a neighbourhood in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. The three crew members and one passenger, and 43 on the ground were killed. 

*On [[4 July]], [[2002]], [[Hesham Mohamed Hadayet]] shot six Israelis at El Al's ticket counter at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] ([[LAX]]). Two of the victims died. Although the gunman was not linked to any terrorist group, Hadayet, an [[Egypt]]ian, espoused anti-Israeli views and was opposed to U.S. policy in the Middle East.[http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/04/12/airport.shooting/] This led the [[FBI]] to classify the shooting as a [[terrorist act]], one of the few on U.S. soil since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

*On [[23 October]], [[2003]], an El Al Boeing 767 flying from Tel Aviv to Los Angeles via Toronto was diverted to [[Mirabel International Airport]] and then on to [[Hamilton/John C. Munro International Airport|Hamilton Airport]], where [[RCMP]] tactical teams were ready. The diversion was the result of a "severe security threat," which was later clarified as a possible [[surface-to-air missile]] attack on the aircraft upon landing in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/news/national/2003/10/26/pearson_elal031026.html | title=Israeli Flight Lands in Toronto| accessdate=2006-11-12 | publisher=CBC News}}</ref>

*On [[7 June]], [[2006]], the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Attorney General]] reported that seven [[North Africa|North Africans]] were arrested in connection with a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to blow up an unspecified El Al flight the following day. At the time of the arrest, El Al's flights between [[Tel Aviv]] and [[London]] flew over the area where a ground-to-air missile was discovered.
