The game's story revolves around a supernatural phenomenon, which [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#F.E.A.R. Team|F.E.A.R.]]—a fictional [[special forces]] team—is called to contain. The player assumes the role of F.E.A.R.'s [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#The Point Man (main character)|Point Man]], who possesses superhuman reflexes and combats an army of [[clone]]d soldiers, and at the same time uncovers the secrets of a paranormal menace in the form of a little girl.

''F.E.A.R.'' was well-received critically, scoring 89% on [[Game Rankings]],<ref name=gamerankings3>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/920744.asp?q=F.E.A.R. | title=''F.E.A.R.''

==Gameplay==
''F.E.A.R.'', as a [[first-person shooter]] game, simulates combat from a [[first-person perspective]]. The protagonist's body is fully present, allowing the player to see his or her character's torso and feet while looking down. Within scripted sequences, when rising from a lying position or [[fast-roping]] from a helicopter for example, the hands and legs of the protagonist can be seen performing the relevant actions. The game's environments are largely urban-styled and indoor; this element has received criticism.<ref name="gamespotreview">{{cite web | last=Ocampo | first=Jason | date=October 14, 2005 | title = ''F.E.A.R.'' for PC Review at GameSpot| url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/fear/review.html | work=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=October 8 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

[[Image:FEAR_screenshot3.png|thumb|250px|left|The player character uses reflex time while firing on a group of soldiers.]]



A prominent gameplay element is "[[Bullet time|reflex time]]," which slows down the game world while allowing the player to aim and react at normal speeds. This effect is used to simulate the character's superhuman reflexes. Reflex time is represented by stylized visual effects, such as bullets in flight that cause air distortion or interact with the game's [[visual effects|particle effects]]. ''F.E.A.R.'' lead designer Craig Hubbard stated that Monolith Productions' primary goal was "to make combat as intense as the tea house shootout at the beginning of [[John Woo]]'s ''[[Hard-Boiled]]''." He continued on to say that "defeat[ing] ... enemies ... with style" was crucial to this goal and that reflex time plays a large role in "mak[ing] the player feel like an action movie hero."<ref name=eurogamer>{{cite web | last=Bramwell | first=Tom | date=October 12, 2005 | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=61255 | title= The FEAR Effect | work=[[Eurogamer]] | accessdate=October 4 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

The game contains weapons based on non-fictional firearms, such as [[pistol]]s, [[assault rifle]]s and [[submachine gun]]s, as well as entirely [[science fiction|fictional]] armaments like [[particle beam weapon]]s. Each firearm differs in terms of ammunition type, accuracy, range, fire rate, damage and bulkiness. The latter characteristic affects the player's character, as more cumbersome weapons slow the player's maneuvers. Monolith Productions stated that it aimed for "a balanced arsenal where each weapon serves a specific function," rather than "just going with a bunch of real-world submachine guns and assault rifles."<ref name=gamespotinterview>{{cite web | date=April 1, 2005 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/fear/news.html?sid=6121461&mode=previews | title=''F.E.A.R.''

The player may carry only three firearms at a time; thus, strategy is required when using and selecting weapons. All weapons possess [[Mêlée#Use in gameplay|mêlée attacks]], and a hand-to-hand combat system allows unarmed players to attack with maneuvers including punches and kicks.

''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[artificial intelligence]] allows computer-controlled characters a large degree of action. Enemies can duck to travel under crawlspaces, jump through windows, vault over railings, climb ladders and push over large objects to create cover. Various opponents may act as a team, taking back routes to surprise the player, using [[suppressive fire]] or taking cover if under fire. The game's artificial intelligence is often cited as being highly advanced,<ref name="FEAR-AI">{{cite web | last = Orkin | first = Jeff | title = Three States and a Plan: The A.I. of F.E.A.R. | work = Game Developers Conference 2006 | date = March 23, 2006 | url = http://www.jorkin.com/gdc2006_orkin_jeff_fear.doc | format = [[DOC (computing)|DOC]] | accessdate = 2006-10-04 }}</ref> and its efficiency helped the game win [[GameSpot]]'s "2005 Best AI Award."<ref name="FEAR-AI2">{{cite web | title = GameSpot's 2005 Best AI Award | work = GameSpot | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pages/features/bestof2005/index.php?day=2&page=10 | accessdate = 2006-10-11 }}</ref>

==Atmosphere==
A core element of ''F.E.A.R.'' is its horror theme, which was heavily inspired by [[Japanese horror]].<ref name=designerdiary>{{cite web | date=October 4, 2005 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/fear/news.html?sid=6134936&mode=previews | title=Music to your F.E.A.R.s | work=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=October 4 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> The design team attempted to keep "[the] psychology of the encounter" in the player's mind at all times, in order to "get under [the player's] skin", as opposed to the "in your face 'monsters jumping out of closets' approach".<ref name=fearpreviewign>{{cite web | date=October 4, 2005 | url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/653/653534p1.html | title=Level design -- it's scary | work=[[IGN]] | accessdate=October 4 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> Lead designer Craig Hubbard stated in an interview that "horror is extremely fragile ... you can kill it by spelling things out too clearly and you can undermine it with too much ambiguity". He remarked that he attempted to strike a balance with the narrative elements of ''F.E.A.R.'', to give players "enough clues so that [they] can form [their] own theories about what's going on, but ideally [they will] be left with some uncertainty".<ref name="gamespotinterview" /> Lead level designer John Mulkey stated, "Creating expectation and then messing with that expectation is extremely important, predictability ruins a scary mood".<ref name="fearpreviewign" />

<!-- FAIR USE of CorridorAlma.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:CorridorAlma.jpg for rationale -->
[[Image:CorridorAlma.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A horror sequence.]]
The main source of the game's horror is Alma, a ghostly little girl. Craig Hubbard remarked that "a guy in a mask chasing co-eds with a meat cleaver can be scary, but on some level you're thinking to yourself you could probably kick his ass if you got the drop on him ... but when a spooky little girl takes out an entire Delta Force squad, how are you supposed to deal with that?"<ref name="eurogamer" /> While Alma has been compared to the character [[Samara Morgan|Samara]] from ''[[The Ring]]'',<ref name=firingsquad>{{cite web | last=Todd | first=Brett | date=October 23, 2005 | url=http://www.firingsquad.com/games/fear_review/ | title=''F.E.A.R.'' review at FiringSquad | work=FiringSquad | accessdate=October 9 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> Craig Hubbard stated that she "was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts" and not "as an answer to any specific movie character".<ref name="eurogamer" /> Hubbard acknowledged that Alma "admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in ''[[Dark Water (2002 film)|Dark Water]]'' or ''Séance''", but "creepy little girls have been freaking [him] out since ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''".<ref name="eurogamer" /> 

''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s audio was designed in the style of Japanese horror films, with the sound engineers using inexpensive equipment to create sound effects, utilizing methods including dragging metal across different surfaces and recording pump sounds.<ref name="designerdiary" /> Monolith Productions commented, "The sound designers had to be concerned with avoiding predictability," since "[l]isteners are smart ... they will recognize your formula quickly and then you won't be able to scare them anymore."<ref name="designerdiary" /> Silence was also utilized in order to "allow players to fill in the space, which lets their imagination create their own personal horror".<ref name="designerdiary" />

Monolith Productions composed ''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s music in reaction to scenes, instead of "creating a formula that would consistently produce music throughout the game".<ref name="designerdiary" /> The design team called ''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s music structure "more cerebral and tailored to each individual event", and continued that "sometimes the music is used to ratchet up the tension to toy with players ... [it] will build to a terrifying crescendo before cutting off without a corresponding event, only to later have the silence shattered by Alma, when players least expect it."<ref name="designerdiary" />

''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s horror theme was praised by critics. ''[[Game Informer]]'' claimed that "... the frequent spooky head trips that Monolith has so skillfully woven together make an experience that demands to be played."<ref name=gameinformer>{{cite web | url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/9FA7ADDB-EA75-454E-AA1A-6EF52A4DFF0A.htm?CS_pid=645831 | title=''Game Informer'' review of ''F.E.A.R.'' | work=[[Game Informer]] | accessdate=October 4 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> [[IGN]] opined that "the environment has been so well-crafted to keep you edgy and watchful ... [that] playing the game for a few hours straight can get a little draining." [[GameSpot]] reacted similarly, calling ''F.E.A.R.''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s horror "exceedingly effective," and agreeing that it "can leave you a bit emotionally exhausted after a while."

==Synopsis==
===Plot===
{{spoiler}} 
The story of ''F.E.A.R.'' is presented in such a way that only a few minor plot elements are presented in the game's beginning, thus allowing players to experience the adventure as "the hero[es] in [their] own  spine-tingling epic of action, tension and terror."<ref name="sierra">{{cite web | title = F.E.A.R.

Team|F.E.A.R.]], a secret special ops group of the [[United States of America|U.S.]] government specialized in dealing with [[paranormal]] threats. The character's extraordinarily reactive reflexes are described as well, hinting that the government is interested in his abilities.<ref name="manual"/> When the game begins, the player witnesses a man named [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Paxton Fettel|Paxton Fettel]] taking command of a [[battalion]] of [[Telepathy|telepathically]] controlled clone [[supersoldier]]s, seizing control of the [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC)|Armacham Technology Corporation]] (ATC) structure and killing all its occupants.<ref>'''Genevieve Aristide''': There was an uprising. Fettel has taken command of the prototypes.</ref>

Now fully in control of the Point Man, the player attends a briefing held by [[Commissioner]] [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#"Rowdy" Betters|Betters]], in the company of his F.E.A.R. team-mates [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Spen Jankowski|Jankowski]] and [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Jin Sun-Kwon|Jin Sun-Kwon]]. The team's mission consists of eliminating Fettel, operating in conjunction with [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Delta Force|Delta Force]].<ref>'''Betters''': This wacko's name is Paxton Fettel. He's the key. If we contain him, we contain the situation. / '''Jin Sun-Kwon''': What's his story? / '''Betters''': Property of Armacham Technology Corporation. They're working on a military contract to develop an army of clones that respond to a psychic commander. Top secret, of course. Fettel was one of the commanders.</ref> <!-- FAIR USE of FEAR_screenshot2.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:FEAR_screenshot2.png for rationale -->[[Image:FEAR_screenshot2.png|thumb|250px|left|A firefight against replica soldiers]]

Fettel is located by means of a [[satellite]] tracking device and hunted by F.E.A.R. and Delta Force over several locations.<ref>'''Jin Sun-Kwon''': How do we find him? / '''Betters''': That's easy. He's got a transmitter embedded in his head that'll lead us right to him.</ref> The search for Fettel begins at a water treatment plant and later continues at Armacham headquarters. While the villain evades capture by the special forces, the player witnesses unexplained and occasionally life-threatening paranormal phenomena, including frequent [[hallucination]]s, all of which center around a little girl in a red dress named [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Alma|Alma]]. Laptops found during the course of the mission, hacked by Commissioner Betters, provide details regarding the background story. The player learns that Fettel was raised to become a telepathic military commander<ref>'''Betters (reading from an ATC laptop)''': Well, this confirms the point of Perseus was to train telepathic commanders to work with cloned soldiers, although Paxton Fettel was the only commander of the program. The weird thing is they refer to him as the second prototype.</ref> as part of ATC project [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Project Origin|Origin]]. He is the son of Alma, who is described as being a powerful psychic.<ref>'''Betters (reading from an ATC laptop)''': More info on Origin: the genetic reference they used for the program was apparently a powerful psychic. Makes sense. If you want a telepathic commander, you need a telepath. And it was a woman. Says here she gave live birth to the prototypes. Seems Wade wasn't convinced the psychic characteristics were genetic. He figured there was better chance they'd be passed along if the fetus gestated inside the subject. So they put her in a coma, made her carry a genetically engineered baby to term, then induced labor.</ref> The player also learns of the existence of another child of Alma, who was born before Fettel.<ref>'''Betters (reading from an ATC laptop)''': Here's some more info about Fettel: he's developed as part of a project called Origin. It says the first prototype didn't work out, Fettel was the second, and there was never a third. They just pulled the plug a few years after he was born.</ref>

All clues lead F.E.A.R. to believe Fettel is under control of Alma,<ref>'''Betters (reading from an ATC laptop)''': I figured out what a synchronicity event is. There was an incident when they lost control of Fettel, he just suddenly started freaking out. He was only about ten years old at the time, but I guess he killed a few people. In the investigation, they discovered that there had been a telepathic link between Fettel and Alma even though she was in a coma. They concluded that she was influencing him. That's must've been why they pulled the plug on Origin.</ref> who was buried within the Origin facility when ATC closed down the project because of the danger posed by the woman. Now the villain is searching for that same facility to free his mother.<ref>'''Betters''': It's starting to make sense. The name of the woman they used for Origin is Alma. That's who Fettel's looking for.</ref> The player eventually takes the Point Man to the abandoned structure, fighting back both the clone soldiers and ATC, whose [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#ATC Security Guards|security agents]] have received orders to cover up the whole affair.<ref>'''Betters (reading from an ATC laptop)''': She was just a kid. Says here Alma was eight years old when Origin started up. They used a little girl. No wonder they're so fucking anxious to keep a lid on this mess.</ref> When the protagonist finally comes face-to-face with Fettel, he is drawn into a hallucination where the player learns that the Point Man is Alma's first son.<ref>'''Fettel''': We are brothers, you and I. [...] You and I were born from the same mother.</ref> After this hallucination, the player is able to kill Fettel. Nonetheless, Alma is freed when her storage chamber is opened by an ATC researcher, [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Harlan Wade|Harlan Wade]], who feels guilty about the company's treatment of her;<ref>'''Wade''': They want to destroy her. But I think she's suffered enough. We put her in there two days before her eighth birthday. She died six days after we pulled the plug.</ref> eventually, it is revealed Alma shares Wade's name, implying that he might be her father or a relative.<ref>In the final hallucination sequence of the game, Alma's full name is shown to be Alma Wade.</ref> The player is then called upon to sabotage the structure's reactor,<ref>'''Mapes''': You have to destroy this facility, before he lets her out. There are four pylons. Damage the reactor cells and you'll trigger a chain reaction. Blow the whole place to hell, where it belongs.</ref>  before the whole location explodes. In the aftermath of the detonation, a Delta Force UH-60 Black Hawk extracts the Point Man from the rubble. While the player and the survivors of the F.E.A.R team survey the results of the explosion from the helicopter, Alma makes one last appearance, preparing to pull herself up into the helicopter's cabin. The destruction of the Origin facility has not stopped her quest for revenge.<ref>'''Holiday''': We still don't know the extent of the damage. / '''Jin Sun-Kwon''': We haven't been able to get through to anyone since the explosion. What about Alma? What happened to her? '''''(After a loud crash is heard)''''' What was that sound?</ref>

After the game's credits, the player can listen to a phone call between a mysterious senator and ATC president [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations#Genevieve Aristide|Aristide]], which offers some further explanation: The president considers the project under control and deems the first prototype (ostensibly the Point Man) a success.<ref>'''Genevieve Aristide''': I just wanted to assure you that the Origin situation has been resolved. / '''Senator''': But so much for discretion. / '''Genevieve Aristide''': It was unavoidable. There is some good news, however: the first prototype was a complete success.</ref>

===Characters and organizations===
:''Main article: [[List of F.E.A.R. characters & organizations]].''
During the course of the game, the player interacts with a number of different characters from various organizations. Some of them are allies, such as the F.E.A.R. and Delta Force team members, while others are hostile, such as Fettel's soldiers and some ATC personnel. The player's character [[silent protagonist|never speaks]], and instead participates in one-sided discussions with other characters. On occasion, the Point Man is required to hand a communicator to other characters, allowing them to speak over the F.E.A.R. team radio. No artificial intelligence–controlled characters fight alongside the player in ''F.E.A.R.'', except for during some sequences in the expansion ''Extraction Point''.

Also included is the exclusive first episode of the ''F.E.A.R.'' machinima, ''[[PANICS|P.A.N.I.C.S.]]'', created by "[[Rooster Teeth Productions]]." 

Over the course of the "Developer's roundtable commentary," producer Chris Hewitt reveals, "We had a whole level in the game where we had this car chase sequence [...] we spent about two months on that thing...." "[B]ut the car chase sequence didn't work the way we hoped it would," adds designer Craig Hubbard, commenting on the choice to remove that level from the game.<ref name="roundtable">{{cite video | people = [[Monolith Productions]] | title = F.E.A.R.

===Engine technology===
:''Main article: [[Lithtech]].''

''F.E.A.R.'' is the first game developed using the newest iteration of Monolith's Lithtech engine. Codenamed "Jupiter EX," the ''F.E.A.R.'' engine is driven by a [[DirectX]] 9 renderer and has seen major advancements from its direct precursor, "Jupiter." The new engine includes both [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics and the Havok "Vehicle Kit," which adds support for common vehicle behavior.<ref name="enginetech">{{cite web | title = Jupiter EX Technology Brochure | publisher = Touchdown Entertainment | url = http://www.touchdownentertainment.com/Content/Pdf/JupiterEXDoc.pdf | accessdate = 2006-07-15 }}</ref> This latter feature goes mostly unused in ''F.E.A.R.'', as no vehicles appear outside of scripted sequences.

Graphically, ''F.E.A.R.'' utilizes [[normal mapping]] and [[parallax mapping]] to give textures a more realistic appearance; the latter is used to give the appearance of depth to flat bullet hole sprites on walls. [[Volumetric lighting]] and [[lightmap]]ping are included with the addition of a [[per-pixel lighting]] model, allowing complex lighting effects to be developed. Vertex, pixel and high-level [[shader]]s, including a host of additional special effects, are also featured in Jupiter EX.<ref name="enginetech"/>

==Reception==
Prior to release, ''F.E.A.R.'' generated large amounts of hype from [[Computer and video game journalism|computer game journalists]].<ref name="gamespotpreview2" /><ref name=1uppreview>{{cite web | last=Green | first=Jeff | date=August 18, 2005 | title = ''F.E.A.R.''

[[IGN]] claimed that "Monolith forges new shooter territory with some truly freaky elements, challenge, fun, and beauty."<ref name=ignreview>{{cite web | last=McNamara | first=Tom | date=October 12, 2005 | url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/657/657310p1.html | title=''F.E.A.R.'' review at IGN | work=[[IGN]] | accessdate=October 9 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> GameSpy praised the game's plot,<ref name=gamespyreview>{{cite web | last=Accardo | first=Sal | date=October 27, 2005 | url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/fear/662327p1.html | title=''F.E.A.R.''

I knew my goal—track down a psychic, escort a corporate executive's daughter out of danger—but I didn't ever care who these people were nor did I understand their motives."<ref name="nyt" /> The game has also received criticism for its system requirements, which call for an extremely powerful [[Personal computer|PC]].<ref name="gamespotreview"/>

''[[Maximum PC]]'' stated that "Monolith did a great job with both the in-game sounds and the soundtrack ... the spooky audio makes exploring deserted ruins creepy, and the positional sound works to great effect; sinister noises like breaking bottles and creaking metal come from your rear channels with just the right frequency to freak you out," but "after eight hours of battling the exact same opponents, in a perfectly linear environment, it’s tough to remain enthusiastic."<ref name=maximumpc>{{cite web | last=Smith |first=Will | date=January 2006 | url=http://www.maximumpc.com/2006/01/fear.html | title=''F.E.A.R.'' review at ''Maximum PC'' | work=[[Maximum PC]] | accessdate=October 9 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> [[GameSpot]] also found the game slightly repetitive, but still called it "quite easily one of the most intense and atmospheric games that you'll play"<ref name="gamespotreview"/> and later awarded it their "Shooter of the Year" prize.<ref name=gsaward>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pages/features/bestof2005/index.php?day=4&page=2 | title = GameSpot's Best of 2005 - Genre Awards | work=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=October 2 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

==Later developments==
Monolith Productions has announced a [[sequel]] to ''F.E.A.R.'', which will not be titled ''F.E.A.R. 2'' due to [[Vivendi]]'s ownership of the ''F.E.A.R.'' name.<ref name="sequel"/> However, the follow-up will stay in the game's existing universe, retaining the original storyline and characters.<ref name="sequel"/> Monolith Productions will require a new publisher for the game, since they were purchased by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment]] in 2004 while development of ''F.E.A.R.'' was under way, after which Vivendi Universal was dropped as publisher.<ref name="sequel"/>

While Monolith Productions owns the rights to the game's characters, Vivendi Universal retains the use of the ''F.E.A.R.'' name, publishing Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 ports of the original,<ref name="ps3" /> developed by Day 1 Studios. An expansion pack titled ''[[F.E.A.R. Extraction Point]]'' was released by [[Timegate Studios]] on [[October 24]], [[2006]].<ref name="Extpoint"/>
