'''New York State Route 23''' runs from [[Central New York]] through the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line in the [[Berkshire Mountains|Berkshires]]. It crosses the [[Hudson River]] via the [[Rip Van Winkle Bridge]].

Along the way it passes through some very scenic areas of the state.

==Route description==
Route 23 has three distinct sections: its western third in Central New York and the Leatherstocking region, the middle in the Catskills, and east of the Hudson.

===Central New York===
The highway begins at a junction with [[New York State Route 26|NY 26]] in eastern [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland County]], at [[Cincinnatus, New York|Lower Cincinnatus]]. It crosses into [[Chenango County, New York|Chenango County]] very soon afterwards, and  then trends northwards to the [[Pharsalia State Wildlife Management Area]], after which it starts heading southwards again to the [[county seat]], [[Norwich (city), New York|Norwich]], where it intersects with [[New York State Route 12|NY 12]]. Another major north-south route, [[New York State Route 8|NY 8]], awaits at [[New Berlin (town), New York|South New Berlin]]. It is followed by the [[Unadilla River]], which puts 23 into [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]].

Several miles into the new county, 23 encounters [[Morris (village), New York|Morris]], its first town, where it briefly joins [[New York State Route 51|NY 51]] along the main street. Beyond Morris, the route continues easterly with a generally southern trend through rolling farmland, until turning south again at [[Laurens, New York|West Laurens]]. A brief easterly turn again at West Oneonta merges it with [[New York State Route 205|NY 205]].

The two highways enter the western end of the city of [[Oneonta (city), New York|Oneonta]], where they are met by [[New York State Route 7|NY 7]] coming in from the southwest. 205 continues south with that portion of 7 while 23 and 7 go east to serve as the city's main street. The two roads diverge again at the city's east end, near the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]]. 23 has an interchange with [[Interstate 88 (east)|Interstate 88]], here also carrying [[New York State Route 28|NY 28]], and then leaves the Oneonta area by going past several large [[strip mall]]s and big-box retailers to the [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]] line.

===Catskills===
23 follows the [[Charlotte Creek]] valley, at first, as the land gets noticeably woodsier and the houses fewer in this, the least densely populated county in New York outside of the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondacks]]. After [[Davenport, New York|Davenport]], the road begins to climb onto the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill Plateau]]. By the time it intersects [[New York State Route 10|NY 10]] at [[Stamford (village), New York|Stamford]], and crosses a small brook that is all that exists of the [[West Branch Delaware River|West Branch]] of the [[Delaware River]] this close to its [[Source (river or stream)|source]], it has already reached 1,820 feet (555 m) above sea level.

It maintains this elevation during a brief detour into [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie County]], where the scenic mountains to the south rise to heights over 3,000 feet (914 m) â€” still leaving them among the lesser Catskill peaks. Elevation drops slightly at the next stop, [[Roxbury, New York|Grand Gorge]], just above the small pond along junctioning [[New York State Route 30|NY 30]] that gives rise to the Delaware's [[East Branch Delaware River|East Branch]].

A few miles outside of Grand Gorge, at a bend south of [[Schoharie Reservoir]], 23 enters [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]]. A bridge over the [[Schoharie Creek]] heralds the next town, [[Prattsville, New York|Prattsville]]. Zedoch Pratt, the [[tanning|tanner]] and [[politician]] who lent his name to the town, left a series of rock carvings depicting his life at [[Pratt Rocks]] just outside of town.

Shortly after the village, [[New York State Route 23A|NY 23A]] continues along the Schoharie while 23 climbs again along [[Batavia Kill]]. Shortly past the scenic [[Red Falls]] along the kill, all crossings of the creek come to mark the [[Blue Line (New York State)|Blue Line]] that delineates the [[Catskill Park]]. 23 remains to the north of the creek even as it passes the [[Windham Mountain]] ski area and [[New York State Route 296|NY 296]] comes in from the south. However, it crosses it several times and is within the park as it reaches its highest point, 1,940 feet (591 m) at the [[mountain pass|pass]] next to [[Windham High Peak]] where the [[Long Path]] crosses the road (and ended for a very long time). This location, very near the northernmost point in the Catskill Park, has long been considered its northern gateway.

Here 23 begins a long descent down the [[Catskill Escarpment]], losing much of the elevation it has gained since Oneonta and providing sweeping, panoramic views of the [[Capital District]] and points north, east and west. [[Five State Lookout]] is a popular place to stop and gape. On good days the Adirondack foothills and [[Green Mountains]] in [[Vermont]] are visible.

Having reached the floor of the [[Hudson Valley]], 23 assumes a southeast-trending route through [[Cairo (town), New York|Cairo]], where it picks up [[New York State Route 145|NY 145]] and briefly duplexes with [[New York State Route 32|NY 32]], the major north-south state route on the west side of the river. It has an indirect intersection with the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87]]), and then [[U.S. Route 9W|US 9W]] and [[New York State Route 385|NY 385]] as it passes north of [[Catskill (village), New York|Catskill]], the county seat, to cross the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] at the [[Rip Van Winkle Bridge]].

===East of the Hudson=== 
Once across the bridge and into [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]], 23 encounters [[New York State Route 9G|NY 9G]] near [[Olana State Historic Site]]. The two highways are briefly joined until 9G continues north with [[New York State Route 23B|NY 23B]] to follow 23's old course through [[Hudson (village), New York|Hudson]].

23 perseveres to the southeast, meeting [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] after a few miles. The two highways multiplex into the complex intersection at Bell Pond, where 9 continues south, [[New York State Route 82|NY 82]] continues along 23's course, while 23 and new route [[New York State Route 9H|NY 9H]] pick up 9's in a northerly direction that takes them to [[Claverack, New York|Claverack]]. Here 23B finishes its loop from the west, 9H continues north and 23 resumes an east-west alignment. Shortly after this junction, [[New York State Route 217|NY 217]] splits off to the north.

The road continues across countryside more open and less rugged, but still very picturesque, than the Catskills. At Martindale it intersects the [[Taconic State Parkway]], then following a creek valley down into [[Hillsdale, New York|Hillsdale]], where the [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]] junction heralds the proximity of the state's eastern border. Almost three miles (5 km) to the east, at the bi-state [[Catamount Ski Area]], NY 23 becomes [[Route 23 (Massachusetts)|MA 23]].

==History==

23 originally went right through Hudson, until 23B was commissioned along its old route to allow through traffic to bypass the village.

==Miscellanea==
From the 1960s through the 1980s, map makers have used reference markers (the little green signs found every 0.1 mile (161 m) along state highways) from NY 23 to explain how they work. Such focus on this one road has provided speculation that it also doubled as an attempt to bring tourists to the Catskills{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.
