'''Adrian Malcolm Conan Doyle''' ([[November 19]], [[1910]] - [[June 3]], [[1970]]) was the youngest son of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], and his father's [[literary executor]].  Adrian Doyle was described as a race-car driver, big-game hunter, explorer, and writer.  He was born in [[Crowborough]], [[England]] and died in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. His wife's name was Anna. He was the founder of the Arthur Conan Doyle Foundation in Switzerland.

Either alone or with the assistance of [[John Dickson Carr]], Adrian Doyle produced additional [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.  The basis of his production was to complete the tales referenced in his father's stories, but which his father had never written.   These Sherlock Holmes tales were written in [[1952]] and [[1953]], but have been republished subsequently. In [[1954]] a hard cover collection of the stories was published, ''[[The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes]]''. [[List of authors of new Sherlock Holmes stories|Other authors]] have also written Sherlock Holmes stories based on the same references within the original tales.
