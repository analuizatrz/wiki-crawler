'''John Wilkes Booth''' ([[May 10]], [[1838]] &ndash; [[April 26]], [[1865]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] from [[Maryland]], who fatally shot [[President of the United States]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on [[April 14]], [[1865]]. Lincoln died the next day from a single gunshot wound to the head &ndash; the first American president to be [[assassinated]]. 

Booth was a successful professional stage actor of his day and a member of the prominent [[Booth family]] of actors. He was also a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer who expressed vehement dissatisfaction with the South's defeat in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and Lincoln's proposal to extend [[Suffrage|voting rights]] to freed slaves. 

Booth and a group of co-conspirators led by him planned to kill Lincoln, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]], and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Henry Seward, Sr.|William Seward]] in a desperate bid to help the tottering Confederacy's cause. Although [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] had surrendered four days earlier, Booth felt that the war was not yet over because Confederate General [[Joseph Johnston]]'s army was still fighting [[Union Army]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]]. Of the conspirators, only Booth was successful in carrying out his part of the plot.

Following the shooting, Booth fled by horseback to southern Maryland and eventually to a farm in rural northern Virginia, where he was tracked down and killed by Union soldiers two weeks later. Several of the other conspirators were tried and hanged shortly thereafter.

== Background and early life ==
John Wilkes Booth's parents, the noted [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Shakespearean]] [[actor]] [[Junius Brutus Booth]] and his actress wife Mary Ann Holmes, emigrated to the United States from England in 1821, purchasing a farm near [[Bel Air, Harford County, Maryland|Bel Air]], [[Maryland]], where John Wilkes Booth was born in 1838.<ref>The Booth family's house, "Tudor Hall", was built in 1847 and still stands today; it was acquired by [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]] in 2006, to be eventually opened to the public as an historic site and museum.</ref> He was named for the British revolutionary [[John Wilkes]], whom the family claimed was a distant relative.<ref>Booth's uncle Algernon Sydney Booth was said to be the great-great-great-grandfather of [[Cherie Blair]] (née Booth), wife of Former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]].{{spaces|2}}&ndash;{{spaces|2}}{{cite web|author=Phil Westwood|title=The Lincoln-Blair Affair|url=http://www.genealogytoday.com/uk/columns/westwood/021025.html}}However, Algernon Sydney Booth died at the age of 5 in 1803. Archer, S. ''Junius Brutus Booth: Theatrical Prometheus'' (1992): 282</ref>

Booth was educated in the classics, in particular Shakespeare. He attended the Bel Air Academy, where his headmaster described him as "Not deficient in intelligence, but disinclined to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered him. Each day he rode back and forth from farm to school, taking more interest in what happened along the way than in reaching his classes on time".<ref>Stanley Kimmel, ''The Mad Booths of Maryland''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1940</ref>

In 1850-1851, he attended Milton Boarding School for Boys located in [[Sparks, Maryland]].<ref>The Milton Boarding School building in Sparks, Md., which John Wilkes Booth once attended, still stands and is now the ''Milton Inn'' restaurant.</ref> As recounted by Booth's sister, [[Asia Booth]] Clarke, in her book entitled "''The Unlocked Book''," the future actor met an old Gypsy woman in the woods near the school who gave him a grim assessment of his life and said he would die young.<ref>Clarke, Asia Booth. ''The Unlocked Book'' (1938):56-57</ref> In 1851, at age 13, Booth attended St. Timothy's Hall, a military academy in [[Catonsville]], Maryland.  Following in the footsteps of their father, [[Junius Brutus Booth, Sr.]] (who had died in 1852) Booth and his brothers [[Edwin Booth|Edwin]] and [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.|Junius, Jr.]] would become well-known actors in mid-nineteenth century America.<ref>Booth is sometimes connected to historical assassin [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], for whom Booth's father was named. On November 25, 1864, Booth acted in a version of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' where he played [[Mark Antony]]. His brother Edwin played the larger role of Brutus.{{spaces|2}}&ndash;{{spaces|2}}

==Theatrical career and Civil War==
[[Image: Booths Caesar.jpg|right|thumb|165px|John Wilkes Booth, Edwin Booth and Junius Brutus Booth, Jr. in [[Shakespeare]]’s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' in 1864.]]

At the age of 17, Booth played the Earl of Richmond in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', but did not act again until [[1857]], when he joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. At his request he was billed as "J.B. Wilkes", a pseudonym meant to divert attention away from his famous [[thespian]] family. In [[1858]] he was accepted as a member of the Richmond Theatre <!--is it Richmond, Va., or London, England? I've removed the Wikilink to Richmond Theatre in London pending clarification-->stock company, and became increasingly popular, called "the handsomest man in America" by reviewers. He stood 5&nbsp;feet, 8&nbsp;inches tall, had jet-black hair, and was lean and athletic. He was also an excellent swordsman. His performances were often characterized by his contemporaries as acrobatic and intensely physical. A fellow actress once recalled that he occasionally cut himself with his own sword. 

On [[December 2]], [[1859]], Booth attended the hanging of militant  [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], who was executed for leading a raid on the Federal [[armory]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], [[Virginia]] (in present-day [[West Virginia]]). Booth bought a uniform from a member of the Richmond Grays militia unit, which was heading for [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], and he joined the Grays, who stood guard for Brown's trial. When Brown was hanged, Booth stood at the foot of the scaffold.

Abraham Lincoln was elected president on [[November 6]], [[1860]], and the following month Booth wrote a long speech that decried what he saw as Northern abolitionism and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of [[slavery]]. On [[April 12]], [[1861]], the Civil War erupted, and eventually eleven Southern states seceded from the Union. Booth's family was from [[Maryland]], a [[Border states (Civil War)|border state]] which remained in the Union during the war despite a slaveholding portion of the population that favored the Confederacy. Because Maryland shared a border with Washington, D.C., Lincoln declared [[martial law]] in Maryland and ordered the imprisonment of pro-secession Maryland political leaders at [[Ft. McHenry]] to prevent the state's secession, a move that many, including Booth, viewed as [[unconstitutional]].<ref>Kauffman, M. ''American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies'' (2004):104-114</ref>

Although Booth was pro-Confederate, his family, like many Marylanders, was divided, and to preserve harmony among his brothers, Booth promised his mother that he would not enlist in the [[Confederate Army]]. As a popular actor in the 1860s, he travelled extensively to perform in both North and South, and as far west as [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. Booth was outspoken in his love for the South, and equally outspoken in his hatred for Lincoln. In early [[1862]], Booth was arrested by a provost marshal in [[Saint Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] for making anti-government remarks.

Booth and Lincoln crossed paths on several occasions. Lincoln was an avid theater-goer and especially loved Shakespeare. On [[November 9]], [[1863]], President Lincoln saw Booth playing Raphael in Charles Selby's ''The Marble Heart'' at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D. C.|Washington]]. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln sat in the same "presidential box" in which he would later be assassinated.

Booth made a final appearance at Ford's on [[March 18]], [[1865]], when he played Duke Pescara in ''The Apostate'' in what was the last appearance of his career. However, Booth's family were long time friends with [[Ford's Theatre|John T. Ford]], the theater's owner, and Booth was in and out of the theater so often during the war that he even had his mail sent there. This granted Booth complete access to Ford's Theatre, day and night.

==Hatching the plot==

By 1864, the tide of the war had shifted in the North's favor. The North halted prisoner exchange in an attempt to diminish the size of the Confederate Army, and because the Confederates refused to exchange captured African-American soldiers. Booth began devising a plan to kidnap Lincoln from his summer residence at [[The Soldiers' Home]] outside of Washington and smuggle him across the Potomac and into Richmond. He would be exchanged for the release of around 10,000 Southern soldiers held captive in Northern prisons. He successfully recruited his old friends Samuel Arnold and Michael O'Laughlin as accomplices. 

==Possible ties to the Confederacy==

In the summer of 1864, Booth met with several well-known Confederate sympathizers at [[The Parker House]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. In October 1864 he made an unexplained trip to [[Montreal]]. At the time, Montreal was a well known center of clandestine Confederate activities. He spent ten days in the city and stayed for a time at St. Lawrence Hall, a meeting place for the Confederate Secret Service, and met at least one blockade runner there. It is possible that it was here that he also met Confederate Secret Service director [[James D. Bulloch]] as well as [[George Nicholas Sanders]], a one-time US ambassador to Britain. 

There has been much scholarly attention devoted to why Booth was in Montreal at this time, and what he was doing there. No solid evidence has ever linked Booth's kidnapping or assassination plot to a conspiracy involving any elements of the Confederate government, although this possibility had been explored at some length in two books; Nathan Miller's ''Spying For America'' and William Tidwell's ''Come Retribution: the Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln.

==The kidnapping attempt==

Booth began to devote more and more of his energy and money to his plot to kidnap Abraham Lincoln after his re-election in early November, [[1864]]. He assembled a loose-knit band of Southern sympathizers, including [[David Herold]], [[George Atzerodt]], [[John Surratt]], and [[Lewis Payne]]. They began to meet routinely at the boarding-house of Surratt's mother, Mrs. [[Mary Surratt]].

On [[November 25]], [[1864]], John Wilkes performed for the first and only time with his two brothers, [[Edwin Booth|Edwin]] and Junius, in a single engagement production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' at the [[Winter Garden Theater]] in [[New York]]. The proceeds went towards a statue of [[William Shakespeare]] for [[Central Park]] which still stands today. The performance was interrupted by a failed attempt by clandestine Confederate agents to burn down several hotels, and by extension the city of New York, with [[Greek fire]]. One of the hotels was next door to the theater, but the fire was quickly extinguished. The following morning, Booth argued bitterly with his brother, Edwin Booth, about Lincoln and the war. 

Three months later, Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on [[March 4]], [[1865]] as the invited guest of his secret fiancée, Lucy Hale. (Lucy's father, [[John P. Hale]], was Lincoln's minister to [[Spain]].) In the crowd below were Powell, Atzerodt, and Herold. There seems to have been no attempt to kidnap or assassinate Lincoln during the inauguration. Later, however, Booth remarked about "what a wonderful chance" he had to shoot Lincoln, if he had so chosen.

On March 17, Booth learned at the last minute that Lincoln would be attending a performance of the play ''Still Waters Run Deep'' at a hospital near the Soldier's Home. Booth assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier's Home in the attempt to kidnap Lincoln en route to the hospital, but the president never showed up. Booth later learned that the President had changed his plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington, which ironically was where Booth lived.

==The assassination==
{{main|Abraham Lincoln assassination}}

On [[April 10]], after hearing the news that [[Robert E. Lee]] had surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House]], Booth told [[Louis J. Weichmann]], a friend of John Surratt, and a boarder at Mary Surratt's house that he was done with the stage and that the only play he wanted to present henceforth was ''[[Venice Preserved|Venice Preserv'd]]''. Although Mr. Weichmann did not understand the reference, ''Venice Preserv'd'' is about an assassination plot.

On [[April 11]], Booth was in the crowd outside the White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window. When Lincoln stated that he was in favor of granting [[suffrage]] to the former slaves, Booth turned to [[Lewis Payne|Lewis Powell]] and urged him to shoot the president on the spot. Powell refused. Booth muttered that it would be the last speech Lincoln would ever make. 

On the morning of [[Good Friday]], [[April 14]], [[1865]], Booth learned that the President and Mrs. Lincoln would be attending the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at Ford's Theatre. He immediately set about making plans for the assassination, which included a getaway horse waiting outside, and an escape route. Booth informed Powell, Herold and Atzerodt of his intention to kill Lincoln. He assigned Powell to assassinate Secretary of State Seward and Atzerodt to assassinate Vice-President Johnson. Herold would assist in their escape into Virginia. By targeting the President and his two immediate successors to the office, Booth seems to have intended to decapitate the Union government and throw it into a state of panic and confusion. Booth also planned to assassinate the Union commanding general, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]; however, Grant's wife had promised to visit family and so they were heading to New Jersey. Booth had hoped that the assassinations would create sufficient chaos within the Union that the Confederate government could reorganize and continue the war. 

As a famous and popular actor, Booth was a friend of the owner of Ford's Theatre, [[John T. Ford]], and had free access to all parts of the theater. Boring a spyhole into the presidential box earlier that day, the assassin could see if his intended victim had made it to the play. That evening, at around 10 p.m., as the play progressed, John Wilkes Booth slipped into Lincoln's box and shot him in the back of the head with a .44 caliber [[Derringer|Deringer]]. Booth's escape was almost thwarted by Major [[Henry Rathbone]], who was present in the Presidential box with Mrs. [[Mary Todd Lincoln]].

==Wanted for murdering [[Abraham Lincoln]]==
[[Image:John Wilkes Booth wanted poster.jpg|thumb|Wanted poster for Booth, Surratt, and Herold]]
Booth then jumped from the President's box and fell to the stage, reputedly breaking his leg after it was snagged by a U.S. Treasury Guard flag used for decoration. At least one researcher, Michael W. Kauffman, now believes, however, that Booth actually broke his leg when his horse fell on him later in the escape, and that Booth's diary entry claiming it occurred jumping to the stage is a typical Booth dramatization.<ref> Kauffman, M. (2004) ''American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies''. ISBN 0-375-75974-3</ref> Some witnesses said he shouted "''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]''" (Latin for "Thus always to tyrants" the Virginia state motto) from the stage, while others said he shouted "The South is avenged." He fled to the home of Dr. [[Samuel Mudd]], who treated the broken leg. Mudd was later convicted of conspiracy before a military court and sentenced to life in prison at [[Dry Tortugas National Park|Fort Jefferson]] in the [[Dry Tortugas]] islands, west of Key West, Florida. He was [[Pardon|pardoned]] in 1869. Booth was surprised when he found little sympathy for his action, and wrote in his journal on [[April 21]], 5 days before his capture, ''[W]ith every man's hand against me, I am here in despair. And why; For doing what Brutus was honored for&nbsp;... And yet I for striking down a greater tyrant than they ever knew am looked upon as a common cutthroat.'' (Booth had appeared with his brothers in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' in New York just 6 months before.)

==The Pursuit==
Union soldiers, led by Lieutenant Edward P. Doherty of the 16th New York Cavalry Regiment, pursued Booth through Southern Maryland and across the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Rappahannock River|Rappahannock]] rivers to Richard Garrett's farm, just south of [[Port Royal, Virginia|Port Royal]], [[Caroline County, Virginia|Caroline County]], [[Virginia]]. Booth and his companion, [[David E. Herold]], had been led to the farm by William S. Jett, formerly a private in the 9th Virginia Cavalry, whom they had met before crossing the Rappahannock.

==Death==
Early in the morning of [[April 26]], [[1865]], the soldiers caught up with Booth. Trapped in a [[tobacco]] barn owned by Richard H. Garrett, [[David Herold]] surrendered. Booth refused to surrender and [[Everton Conger]] ordered the soldiers to set the barn ablaze. Sergeant [[Boston Corbett]] fired at Booth -not against orders as some claim, as no orders were given, fatally wounding him in the neck. Booth was dragged from the fire and died on the porch of the nearby farmhouse at age 26. The bullet had severed his spinal cord, paralyzing him. His last words were reportedly, "Useless, useless."<ref>James L. Swanson, ''Manhunt: The 12-day chase for Abraham Lincoln's Killer''. (ISBN 0-7499-5134-6)</ref>

Booth's body was taken to the [[ironclad]] [[USS Montauk|USS ''Montauk'']] at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] for identification and an [[autopsy]]. The body was then buried in a storage room at the Old Penitentiary at the Washington Arsenal. When the prison was razed in [[1867]], the body was moved to a warehouse on the Arsenal grounds. In [[1869]], the remains were once again identified before being released to the Booth family, where they were buried in the family plot at [[Greenmount Cemetery]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].<ref>Kauffman, M. "Fort Lesley McNair and the Lincoln Conspirators." ''Lincoln Herald'' 80 (1978):176-188</ref>

=="Booth escaped" theories==
[[Image:Jwb_farm.jpg|right|thumb| Historic Site marker on Route 301 near Bowling Green, VA]]
An early popularizer of "Booth Escape" theories was [[Finis L. Bates]] who claimed to have met Booth in [[Granbury, Texas]] in the 1870s and later to have taken possession of Booth's body after his suicide in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] in 1903. He toured the mummified body in carnival sideshows and wrote ''The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth'' (1907) in order to authenticate the mummy.

Some have claimed that it was not Booth who had been trapped in the tobacco barn at Garrett's farm, but a look-alike double agent named [[James William Boyd]], who died in his place. In this scenario, the government went to great pains to cover up the blunder. These theories are seen by most historians as having no substance. 

[[The Lincoln Conspiracy (book)|''The Lincoln Conspiracy'']] (ISBN 1-56849-531-5) details the assassination, the Boyd plot, and Booth's escape to the swamps. ''The Curse of Cain: The Untold Story of John Wilkes Booth'' (ISBN 1-58006-021-8) continues with the claim that Booth escaped, sought refuge in [[Japan]] and eventually returned to the United States where he died in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] in [[1903]]. Another is that a man claiming to be Booth lived into the 1900s in [[Missouri]]. In recent years, a legal attempt was mounted to force the exhumation of Booth's presumed remains in order to conduct a photo-superimposition study. This was blocked by Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Joseph H. H. Kaplan, who cited, among other things, "the unreliability of petitioners' less-than-convincing escape/cover-up theory" as a major factor in his decision. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals upheld the ruling. <ref>{{cite web|author=Francis J.
