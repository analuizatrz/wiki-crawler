She arrived at Holby after the death of her husband James in [[Dubai]], where she had recently met surgical registrars Joseph Byrne and [[Jac Naylor]].  Faye had also been married twice previously.

== Character History ==
<!-- ATTENTION! PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING! Try to keep this section brief. Not every plot detail needs to be added here, especially since the show is currently ongoing. -->
Faye first appeared in episode 'Into The Dark', approaching Joseph and Jac for help in gaining employment as a nurse at Holby City Hospital.  Despite the fact that he had no access to her most recent employment records, she was hired by Nursing Consultant Mark Williams.  In episode 'What Lies Beneath' it was revealed that whilst living in Dubai, Faye's husband at the time had lost her life savings of Â£50,000 with which she had been planning to buy a nursing home in England.  After coming home drunk and attacking Faye, James later ended up dead as Faye stepped over his body at the bottom of a staircase.  Although she was arrested and questioned, for the time being Faye appears relatively safe, although is worried about her colleagues finding out about her arrest.  This worry heightened when she seemed to be recognized by [[Minor_characters_in_Holby_City#Harvey_Tyson|Harvey Tyson]], policeman husband of [[Nursing_in_the_United_Kingdom#Hierarchy_.26_roles|Acting Sister]] [[Kyla Tyson]], with whom Faye has since struck up a budding friendship.  In episode 'The Borders of Sleep', Faye resisted the advances of hospital lothario Sam Strachan
