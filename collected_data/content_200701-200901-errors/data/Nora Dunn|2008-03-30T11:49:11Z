===Career===
Dunn joined ''SNL'' in [[1985]] with the return of [[Lorne Michaels]] as [[executive producer]]. The 1985 – [[1986|86]] season proved to be a ratings disaster, and she was one of only five cast members who were not fired at its end (the others were newcomers [[Jon Lovitz]], [[A. Whitney Brown]], [[Dennis Miller]] and longtime featured player [[Al Franken]]). As part of the 1986 – [[1987|87]] cast including newcomers [[Dana Carvey]], [[Phil Hartman]], [[Jan Hooks]], [[Victoria Jackson]], and [[Kevin Nealon]], Dunn would be part of what was considered the show's second golden age.

Although she never became one of its breakout stars, Dunn was a dependable supporting player. Her characters included half of "The Sweeney Sisters" lounge act alongside Hooks, as well as [[talk show]] host Pat Stevens (which became a popular recurring role starting in the low-rated 1985-1986 season), melodramatic French hooker Babette, and film buff Ashley Ashley from the "Actors on Film" sketch from the 1985-1986 season. Her many impressions included [[Ann Landers]], [[Imelda Marcos]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Tyne Daly]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Martina Navratilova]], and [[Cokie Roberts]].

Dunn made headlines in 1990 when she, along with original musical guest [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[boycot]]ted an episode which was hosted by comedian [[Andrew Dice Clay]] because they found his [[misogynist]]ic humor offensive. Since then, in addition to numerous [[feature film]] roles, she has gone back to [[television]] with reoccurring roles on ''[[Sisters (TV series)|Sisters]]'' from 1993-1996 and ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'' from 1998-1999.

Her many films include ''[[Three Kings]]'' with George Clooney, ''[[Runaway Jury]]'' with John Cusack and ''[[Zoolander]]'' with Ben Stiller.
