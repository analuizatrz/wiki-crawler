The '''Scottish Railway Preservation Society''' is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] charity, operating both the [[Bo'ness and Kinneil Railway]] and charter trains.

The SRPS charter trains and rail-tours are mostly operated within or originating in [[Scotland]]. The SRPS own a small fleet of preserved [[British Railways Mark 1|"Mark 1"]] carriages (based in [[Bo'ness]]); these are used for trips and ''land-cruises'' based over the rail network to destinations such as [[Mallaig]] and the [[Lincoln Christmas Market]].
