==History==
Penn State at the turn of the 20th century had developed a national reputation for its engineering curriculum,<ref name="oldest" /> but industrial engineering was only beginning to emerge as an academic discipline. Noted efficiency expert [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] recommended that university president James A. Beaver hire Hugo Diemer, a professor from the [[University of Kansas]], in the hope that Diemer would create an industrial engineering curriculum at Penn State.  A two-year option was ready by 1908, and a four-year [[baccalaureate]] degree program emerged the following year, the first of its kind in the world. At the time, courses consisted of modern industrial engineering fundamentals such as [[time and motion study]], plant layout optimization, and [[Managerial economics|engineering economics]], in addition to courses on [[advertising]] and [[sales]].  The new department also took over the instruction of manual shop skills, including [[carpentry]] and [[metalworking]].<ref name="oldest" />

At the time, the department did not have its own building, and for many years shared building space with other departments in the university's College of Engineering. In the 1980s, Penn State board members began to consider expanding the campus toward the west, and by 1987, initial plans to construct a new engineering building were in place. The Penn State Board of Trustees funded the project in 1995 amid concerns of damaging the aesthetics of the previously undeveloped western edge of campus. Some trustees disapproved of the building design, but the board ultimately released $5 million from its fund dedicated to expanding west campus.<!--

-->  The building opened in 2000 and was named after William E. Leonhard, a 1936 Penn State alumnus who with his wife has donated in excess of $1 million toward engineering at Penn State.<!--

--> In 1999, the department itself was named after Harold and Inge Marcus, a couple living in [[Seattle]] who donated $5 million to the department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/1999/01/01-25-99tdc/01-25-99dnews-13.asp|title=Engineering department named for benefactors|author=Daryl Lang|work=The Digital Collegian|year=January 25, 1999|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

In 2005, the department restructured the undergraduate industrial engineering curriculum for the first time in 21 years. Shifting its focus somewhat from its traditional [[manufacturing]] emphasis, the new curriculum introduced several courses related to the [[Tertiary sector of industry|service industry]]. An industry advisory board in conjunction with faculty helped guide the changes, mentioning [[healthcare]], [[supply chain]]s, and [[e-commerce]] as service industry opportunities for industrial engineers. Under the new curriculum, students take a number of refactored courses, and are offered a choice between three separate subject tracks, allowing them to focus their major on manufacturing, the service industry, or [[information technology]].<!--

==Academics==
The department is recognized as one of the country's premier industrial engineering departments.  The 2006 ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rankings placed the department's undergraduate program fourth in the country, and the graduate program third.<ref name="U.S. News" /> Twenty-five full-time faculty served 127 graduate and 345 undergraduate students in 2005.<ref name="facts" />

At the undergraduate level, students can pursue a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in industrial and manufacturing engineering.  The first two years of the program consist primarily of general engineering courses, including math and science.  Once these introductory courses are complete, students begin taking industrial engineering courses on topics such as engineering economy, manufacturing technology, statistics, work design, and operations research.<!--
--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ie.psu.edu/Academics/Undergraduate/Courses/ugradreq2.cfm?coursetype=ugreq&level=ugrad&curr=new|title=IE Undergraduate Required Courses|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><!--
--> Of the 129 credits required for graduation, nine are devoted to a specialization, allowing students to focus their degree on a specific area within industrial engineering. The available tracks are manufacturing engineering, engineering service systems, and engineering information systems.  Undergraduates are also permitted to pursue an approved minor and count three of the credits earned toward their IE degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ie.psu.edu/Academics/Undergraduate/Courses/SpecializationElectives.htm|title=Specialization Track Electives|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><!--
--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ie.psu.edu/Academics/Undergraduate/Courses/CurriculumPlan2.htm|title= Undergraduate Curriculum Plan|accessdate=2006-09-07}}</ref>

Graduate students have a greater variety of options.  [[Master of Science]] and [[Master of Engineering]] degrees are available, and may be supplemented by options in manufacturing engineering, human factors/ergonomics engineering, or quality engineering.  Furthermore, dual M.S. degrees in industrial engineering and operations research are offered.  At the [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] level, students may pursue an industrial engineering degree, a dual-degree in industrial engineering and operations research, or a degree in industrial engineering with a minor in operations research.<!--
--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ie.psu.edu/Academics/Graduate/Degrees/Degrees.htm|title=Degrees offered|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><!--
-->  Besides coursework, a thesis is required for the M.S. and Ph.D. programs. For the M.Eng. degree, a shorter scholarly paper must be written.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ie.psu.edu/Academics/Graduate/Degrees/MSENG/PaperRequirements.htm|title=M. Eng. Program - Scholarly Paper Requirements|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

In addition to the study abroad opportunities available to all engineering students at Penn State, the industrial engineering department offers two study abroad programs specifically for industrial engineering students.  The first, at the [[University of Navarra]] in [[Donostia|San Sebastian]], [[Spain]], is offered to undergraduate juniors and seniors in the department.  The second, at the [[Technion - Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]] in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], is open to both graduate and undergraduate students. Each offers a variety of industrial engineering coursework, taught both in English and the language of the host country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ie.psu.edu/studyabroad/studyabroad.htm|title=Study Abroad Programs|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

Additionally, the building contains a 10,000 square foot (900&nbsp;m²) high-bay manufacturing lab called the Factory for Advanced Manufacturing Education, or the FAME lab. With the goal of reinforcing material taught in the classroom and introducing students to common engineering processes, the department brought together a variety of manufacturing equipment.  It partnered with [[Haas Automation]] to create the Haas Technical Center, a section of the lab that contains 10 Haas [[CNC]] machining centers and turning centers.<!--
