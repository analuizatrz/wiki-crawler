'''Sarah Trimmer''' ([[January 6]], [[1741]]-[[December 15]], [[1810]]) was a noted writer and critic of [[children's literature]] in the eighteenth century. Her periodical, ''The Guardian of Education'', helped to establish the parameters of children's literature and her most popular book, ''Fabulous Histories'', was reprinted for over a century.

==Early life==
Trimmer was born on [[January 6]], [[1741]] in [[Ipswich]] to Joshua Kirby and Sarah Bell. In 1755 the family moved to [[London]] when her father, a noted artist who had written "several major books on perspective," was made tutor of perspective to the Prince of Wales, later [[George III]].<ref>Grenby, Matthew. "Introduction." ''The Guardian of Education''. Bristol: Thoemmes Press (2002), vi.</ref> Through her father's connections, Trimmer was able to meet [[William Hogarth]], [[Thomas Gainsborough]], and [[Samuel Johnson]]. In 1759 her father was given the position of Clerk of Works at the Kew palace and the family moved to [[Kew]]. There Trimmer met James Trimmer whom she married on [[September 21]], [[1762]]. The couple moved to [[Brentford|Old Brentford]].<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," vi-vii.</ref>

==Motherhood and a literary career==
Trimmer and her husband had twelve children--six boys and six girls--and Trimmer was responsible for their education. It was from her own experience that she drew many of her ideas on education. She was also active in the Sunday School movement, establishing the first Sunday school for poor children in Old Brentford in 1786. Trimmer's school became so well-known that [[Queen Charlotte]] even asked her advice on founding a Sunday School.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," vii.</ref>

Trimmer's first book was ''An easy introduction to the knowledge of nature, and reading the holy scriptures, adapted to the capacities of children'' (1780), which built on the revolution in children's literature begun by [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]]. In her twenty-five year career, Trimmer produced around thirty-three additional texts.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," viii.</ref> While the bulk of her output was for children, some were also for specific adults audiences. For example, ''The Oeconomy of Charity'' (1786, revised 1801) "advised on the institution of Sunday schools and on how best to distribute charity. She also wrote books aimed at the poor; ''The Servant’s Friend'' (1786-7), for example, was written to teach the duty of a servant to both young and old."<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," viii.</ref>
 
But it was her children's literature that was "most enduring" and most influential. ''Fabulous Histories'', her most popular work, also known as ''The History of the Robins'', remained in print "well into the twentieth century."<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," viii.</ref> She also produced sets of illustrations and commentary on the Bible, ancient history and modern history that were wildly popular. “These came in various forms. The early editions were designed so that the prints could be pasted onto boards and hung on the wall; later they were bound into books. They were sold either together with, or separate from, Trimmer’s text.”<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," viii.</ref>

Trimmer worked with four different publishers--John Marshall, T.N. Longman, G. Robinson, Joseph Johnson--and by 1800 no author had more works in the [[John Newbery|Newbery]] catalogue than Trimmer.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," ix.</ref>

[[Image:TrimmerJesusWater.jpg|right|200px|thumb|From Trimmer's ''A Description of a Set of Prints Taken from the New Testament'': "Jesus spake unto them, saying, It is I, be not afraid. And Peter answered and said Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water: and he said, Come. And when Peter was come out of the ship, he (through the power of CHRIST) walked on the water likewise; but when he saw the wind boisterous, his faith or belief in CHRIST'S power, failed, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, Lord, save me! And immediately JESUS stretched forth his hand and caught him, saying, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"]]

==''The Guardian of Education''==
Later in her life Trimmer published the influential ''Guardian of Education'' (June 1802-September 1806) which included ideas for instructing children and reviews of various contemporary children's books<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," x.</ref> Matthew Grenby, the current expert on Trimmer, estimates that the ''Guardian'''s circulation was around 1500 and 3500 copies per issue.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," x.</ref> Although there had been a previous attempt to review children's books,<ref>Immel, Andrea. "James Petit Andrews's 'Book' (1790): The First Critical Survey of English Children's Literature." ''Children's Literature'' 28 (2000): 147-63.</ref> according to Grenby “it was a far less substantial and sustained enterprise than Trimmer’s.”<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xiv.</ref> Each issue of the ''Guardian'' was divided into three sections: extracts from texts that Trimmer thought would be edifying to her adult readers, an essay by Trimmer herself commenting on an issue related to education, and reviews of children's books. Trimmer undertook no small task in her periodical. According to Grenby, she aimed “to assess the current state of educational policy and praxis in Britain and to shape its future direction.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xii.</ref> To do so, she critiqued the educational theories of, among others, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[John Locke]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Hannah More]], [[Madame de Genlis]], [[Joseph Lancaster]], and [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]]. In her “Essay on Christian Education,” later also published separately, she proposed her own educational program.

Trimmer took her reviews very seriously. Her over 400 reviews consitute a set of distinct values.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xvi.</ref> As a [[high-church]] [[Anglican]], she was intent on protecting Christianity from [[evangelicalism]] as well as [[secularism]]. She was also a stauch supporter of the conservative government and an opponent of the [[French Revolution]]. As Grenby puts it, "her initial questions of any children’s books that came before her were always first, was it damaging to religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established social hierarchy.”<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xvii-xviii.</ref> It was religion that most important to Trimmer and her emphasis on the inerrancy and the literal truth of the Bible make her a Christian fundamentalist in many ways.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xxi.</ref>

But Trimmer's fundamentalism, Grenby argues, did not necessarily make her the rigid a thinker that she has been described as in the past by critics such as Geofffey Summerfield.<ref>See Summerfield, Geoffrey. ''Fantasy and Reason: Children’s Literature in the Eighteenth Century''. Athens: The University of Georgia Press (1984).</ref> He points out that she, like Rousseau, believed children were naturally good; in this, she was arguing against centuries of tradition, particularly the tradition of [[original sin]] and the Puritanical attitudes towards raising children (exemplified by [[John Wesley]]).<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xxiv.</ref> She also agreed with "Rousseau’s key idea, later taken up by the Romantics, that children should not be forced to become adults too early," in particular that they should not be exposed to political issues too soon.<ref>Grenby, Matthew. "A Conservative Woman Doing Radical Things." ''Culturing the Child, 1690-1914''. Ed. Donelle Ruwe. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press (2005), 148-9.</ref> Trimmer also argued that mothers should not be solely responsible for the care of children; she described "partnership-parenting" in which both the mother and the father contributed.<ref>Grenby, "A Conservative Woman Doing Radical Things," 150.</ref>Such an arrangement is reflected in the robin family in ''Fabulous Histories''.

While Trimmer has often been described as a shrill critic, as Grenby points out “fewer than 50 were chiefly negative, and of these only 18 were thoroughly excoriating. These were easily outweighed by the positive notices, although most of her reviews were mixed or – more surprisingly given her reputation for always impassioned appraisal – ambivalent.”<ref>Grenby, "Introduction, xxviii.</ref> Her primary objections were to texts that challenged or altered the Bible or to books that promoted the ideas associated with the [[French Revolution]]. She also criticized books that included death scenes, insane characters and representations of sexuality.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction, xxxv.</ref>

She typically praises books which encourage intellectual instruction, such as [[Anna Barbauld]]'s ''Lessons for children'' series, which teaches children how to read and write.  Other notable authors that she critiques in her journal include [[Sarah Fielding]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], and [[Dorothy Kilner]].  However, she criticizes books which may frighten children (Barbauld's ''Lessons'' included an episode with a bear) and [[Fairy Tales]], such as translations of [[Charles Perrault]]'s ''Histoires ou Contes du Temps passé'' (1697) (a collection which includes ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[Puss in Boots]]''), because they suggested that children could too easily become successful (they did not have to work, in other words) and because they endorsed an irrational view of the world.<ref>Grenby, "A Conservative Woman Doing Radical Things," 152.</ref>

With its 400 reviews, ''The Guardian of Education'' established [[children's literature]] as a genre. It decided, by what it included as a children's book (novels, chapbooks, tracts, ballads, and fairy tales were excluded), what counted as children's literature and what did not. Moreover, in one of her early essays, “Observations on the Changes which have taken place in Books for Children and Young Persons," Trimmer wrote the first history of children's literature, thereby setting out the first canon of children's literature. Its landmark books, such as [[Sarah Fielding]]’s ''The Governess'' or ''[[The History of Little Goody Two Shoes]]'', are still books we cite today as important in the development of the genre.<ref>Grenby, "Introduction," xl.</ref>

==Death==
Trimmer's husband died in 1792. A few years later, in 1800, she and some of her daughters moved to another house in [[Brentford]]. She died there on [[December 15]], [[1810]] and was buried at St Mary's, Ealing. There is a memorial plaque describing her contributions to literature at St. George's, Brentford.<ref>Schnorrenberg, Barbara Brandon. "Sarah Trimmer." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.
