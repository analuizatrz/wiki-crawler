== History ==
===Early years===
[[Image:El Al Logo 1950.gif|thumb|El Al's logo during the 1950s]]

In September [[1948]], [[Israel|Israels]] first [[President of Israel|president]], [[Haim Weizman]], attended a conference in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. It was planned for Weizman to fly back to Israel in a government aircraft, but due to the embargo which Israel was under at the time, this was not possible and the decision was made to convert a [[C-54]] military transport aircraft into civilian configuration for this purpose. The aircraft, which was painted with '''El Al Ltd./Israel National Aviation Company''' titles and fitted with extra fuel tanks in order to make the flight non-stop from Geneva to Israel, departed from [[Tel Nof Israeli Air Force Base|Ekron Air Base]] on [[28 September]], and returned to Israel on [[September 30]]. Upon its return to Israel, the aircraft was re-converted and put back into military use.<ref name="answers">{{citeweb | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/el-al-israel-airlines-ltd | title=El Al Company History | accessdate=2007-05-27 | publisher=Answers.com Premium Partner}}</ref> 

[[Image:60s.gif|left|thumb|El Al's new logo as used during the early 1960s]]

It only took two months before the airline officially established itself as a scheduled carrier when it was incorporated on [[15 November]], borrowing aircraft until February 1959, when it acquired two unpressurised [[DC-4]]'s from [[American Airlines]] using funds provided by the [[Politics of Israel|Israeli government]], the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]], and other Jewish organizations, with the first aircraft arriving at [[Ben Gurion International Airport|Lod Airport]] on [[April 3]], [[1949]]. Aryeh Pincus, a lawyer originating from [[South Africa]], was chosen to lead the company at this time, and the airlines first international flight was from [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Paris]] (via a refuel stop in Rome) on July 31, 1949.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13400/edition_id/259/format/html/displaystory.html | title=El Al flies to rescue throughout the world | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Jewish News Weekly of Northern California|last=Kanon|first=Sharon|date=2000-04-07}}</ref><ref name="answers" /> By the end of 1949, the airline had flown passengers to London and Johannesburg as well, and service to London became scheduled in mid-1950. In late 1950, El Al acquired Universal Airways, an airline founded by South African Zionists, while [[Arkia Israel Airlines|Israel Inland Airlines]], a state-run domestic airline, was also founded, with El Al having a 50% stake.<ref name="answers" />

El Al started cargo service using military surplus [[C-46]] aircraft in 1950 when it also initiated its first charter services to the [[USA]], shortly afterwards scheduled services began as well.<ref name="answers" /> From its earliest days, the airline was the source of friction between secular and religious Israeli's. In order for [[David Ben Gurion]] to form his first coalition, he was forced to declare that El Al would serve only [[kosher]] food on its flights and would not fly on the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]].<ref name="shabbat">{{citeweb | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010222124207/http://www.jewishgates.org/history/modhis/elal.stm | title=El-Al, Israel's Airline | accessdate=2007-05-27 | publisher=Gates of Jewish Heritage}}</ref>

In the early [[1950s]], the airline carried over 160,000 immigrants to Israel from [[History of the Jews in India|India]], [[History of the Jews in Iran|Iran]], [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Yemenite Jews|Yemen]] as part of [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]] and [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]].<ref name="History of El Al" /> As Israel's flag carrier, they have been involved in a number of a number of secretive operations such as that in 1960 when [[Nazi]] War Criminal, [[Adolf Eichmann]] was captured and flown from Argentina to Israel on an El Al aircraft.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874118-2,00.html | title=The Beast in Chains | publisher=Time Magazine | accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>

In 1955, following a period of the airline's usage of the unreliable and noisy [[Constellations]], the airline placed an order for two [[Bristol Britannia]] aircraft to become only the second airline to fly the aircraft after the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]]. In 1958, the airline ran a newspaper advertisement in the [[USA|US]] with a picture of the Atlantic Ocean one-fifth torn away ("Starting Dec. 23, the Atlantic Ocean will be 20% smaller"), advertising non-stop trans-atlantic flights on its Britannia aircraft.<REF>{{citeweb| url=http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:uff0IpxEuXsJ:www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,937575,00.html%3Fiid%3Dchix-sphere+%22el+al%22+advertisement+1958&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=8&client=firefox-a | title=Adman's Adman | accessdate=2007-05-28 | publisher=Time Magazine}}</ref> This was revolutionary as it was unknown in the industry for airlines to use images of the ocean in their advertising, due to public fears of crashing. The advertisement, which ran only once, had the desired effect and within one year, El Al's sales tripled.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.ciadvertising.org/studies/student/98_fall/theory/weirtz/doyle.htm | title=William Bernbach | accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>

[[Image:El Al ocean ad.png|thumb|left|El Al's famous ocean advert from 1958 advertising non-stop transatlantic services]]

===Jet era and terrorism===

Despite the purchases of the Britannia, and introduction of non-stop trans-atlantic flights, the airline remained unprofitable.<ref name="answers" /> The end of the 1950s saw Efraim Ben-Arzi take over leadership of the airline, and soon the Britannias were replaced by the [[de Havilland Comet|de Havilland Comet 4]], [[Boeing 707]], and [[Douglas DC-8]] jets. 1960 was the first year in which the airline posted a profit and El Al was, at this time carrying more than half of all passengers flying into Israel.<ref name="answers" /> 

On [[15 June]] [[1961]], the airline set the world record for the longest non-stop commercial flight from Tel Aviv to [[New York]] when one of its [[Boeing 707]] aircraft covered 5,760 miles in 9 hours and 33 minutes.<ref name="History of El Al" /> By this time, El Al was carrying 56,000 passengers a year, beating out well-known airlines as [[Loftleidir]] and the same as [[Qantas]]. In 1961, El Al was the world's 35th largest airline in terms of accumulated passenger-miles.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Commercial_Aviation/ElAl/Tran25.htm | title=El Al, the Israeli Airline | accessdate=2007-05-28 | publisher=US Centennial of Flight}}</ref>

El Al continued to pass through a strong era during the late 1960s, especially in 1968 when, not only did El Al began flying scheduled flights to [[Bucharest]] and started dedicated cargo flights to Europe and the USA, but also established a catering subsidiary, Teshet Tourism and Aviation Services Ltd., all of which led to annual profits of approximately $2 million in this year.<ref name="answers" />

In 1968, El Al experienced what would become the first of many instances of terrorism against the airline. On [[July 23]], the first and only successful hijacking of an El Al aircraft took place when a 707 carrying 10 crew and 38 passengers was taken over by three members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP). The aircraft was en route from [[Rome]], [[Italy]], to [[Lod]], [[Israel]]. The hijackers diverted it to [[Algiers]]. The negotiations extended over 40 days and both the hijackers and the 21 Israeli hostages ultimately went free. It later emerged that the hijackers left Beirut armed, with the full consent of the Lebanese authorities.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942267-2,00.html | title=Drama of the Desert: The Week of the Hostages | date=1970-09-21|accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=TIME}}</ref> This was followed on [[December 26]] by the attack against an El Al aircraft at Athens Airport, in which two PFLP operates killed an Israeli mechanic.<ref name="TVNZ"/> Israel once again held Lebanon accountable for the attack, and, following restraint following the July attack, the [[IDF]] retaliated on [[December 29]], when it raided Lebanon's [[Beirut Airport]] airport at night, destroying 14 planes on the ground belonging to [[Middle East Airlines]], [[Trans Mediterranean Airways]] and Lebanese International Airways.<REF>{{cite web

[[1969]] did not see any easing of tensions in the region, and El Al continued to be a terrorism target. On [[February 18]] [[1969]], Palestinian terrorists attacked an El Al plane at [[Zurich Airport]] killing the copilot and injuring the pilot. One Palestinian terrorist was killed and others were convicted but later released.<ref name="idiots">{{cite book |last=Bard |first=Mitchell Geoffrey |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Middle East Conflict |year= |publisher=Alpha Books |location= |isbn= }}</ref> Between September and December 1969, bomb and grenade attacks occurred at El Al offices in [[Athens]], [[Berlin]], and [[Brussels]].<ref name="idiots" /> This culminated in the failed attempt hijack of an El Al [[Boeing 707]] by [[Patrick Arguello]] and [[Leila Khaled]] on [[September 6]] 1970, as part of the [[Dawson's Field hijackings]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=15456 | title=The Day a New Terrorism Was Born | date=2006-02-24|last=Tugend|first=Tom|accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Jewish Journal}}</ref>

===1970s and 1980s===

1971 saw El Al recieve its first [[Boeing 747]] jet which was received in a new color scheme. Many saw this purchase as too risky, given the enormous cost and serious threat of terrorism, but traffic soared with the two 747s, and at this time, El Al's relatively small operation of just 12 jets was one highly regarded world-wide. A third 747 was delivered in 1973 which was used by the airline to inaugurate nonstop services from Tel Aviv to New York. At thirteen hours against prevailing winds, this was the longest scheduled flight in the world.<ref name="answers" /> By the mid-1970s, El Al had started to schedule its flights to leave airports outside of Israel on Sabbath, in order to arrive in Israel after Sabbath. This caused religious parties to object to this breaking of [[halachah]] and the original 1948 agreement. The subsequent controversy caused the Labor government to fall. New elections were held, and [[Menachem Begin]], the new Prime Minister agreed to enforce the agreement. This caused the secular community to campaign against the laws once again, by threatening to boycott the airline, and arguing that they would lose much-needed income. In August 1982, angry El Al workers prevented Orthodox and Hassidic Jews from entering the airport.<ref name="shabbat" /> 

In 1977 El Al created a charter subsidiary then known as El Al Charter Services Ltd., but later renamed [[Sun D'Or|Sun D'Or International Airlines Ltd]]. This happened two years after its first year of losses since the late 1950s, as a result of a global recession. El Al replaced its management three times in the late 1970s, finally settling with Itzhak Shander as president. Following the deterioration in the situation in Iran at this time, El Al sent aircraft to the country to evacuate Jewish citizens to Israel. Soon, all of the airline's facilities in the country were destroyed.<ref name="answers" />

[[Image:Elal logo.gif|right|El Al's logo from the 1960s to 2006|thumb]]

[[April]] [[1980]] saw the launch of El Al service from Tel Aviv to [[Cairo]] following the [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty|peace agreement]].<ref name="History of El Al" /> It didn't last long though, as it, along with all other El Al operations were grounded in late 1982 following poor operations and particularly a strike in September. The government appointed Amram Blum as the person ultimately responsible for the airline, which lost $123.3 million in the fiscal year ending April 1983.<ref name="answers" /> It sold its stake in [[Arkia]] at this time.<ref>{{Citeweb | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/sde_dov.htm | title=Sde Dov/Tel Aviv | accessdate=2007-05-27 | publisher=Global Security}}</ref>


The government gave the airline permission to resume services in January 1983 from a technical receivership position. The Israeli government provided them with two new [[Boeing 737]] aircraft and agreed to purchase four [[Boeing 767]] jets worth $200 million. Within four years, the airline had returned to a position of profits.<ref name="answers" /> In [[May]] [[1988]], El Al operated what is to this day the longest non-stop flight in its history from [[Los Angeles]] to Tel Aviv, a journey of 7,000 miles in 13 hours and 41 minutes.<ref name="History of El Al" /> In 1989, flights to Poland and Yugoslavia commenced.<ref name="answers" />

===1990s and early 2000s===
[[Image:elal.b747.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|El Al Boeing 747-200 such as that operated in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s]]

In January 1990, [[North American Airlines]] started operations, designed partly to provide feeder services to El Al gateways in North America. El Al held a 24.9% stake in the airline until it sold it back to Dan McKinnon in July 2003. By this time, El Al operated a fleet of 20 aircraft, including nine Boeing 747s, and had begun the process of replacing its aging Boeing 707s with the [[Boeing 757]]. Early 1990 saw El Al begin scheduled services to [[Moscow]] following the downfall of the [[Soviet Union]]. At this time, however, the airline was unable to carry Jewish emigrants out of the country. In 1991, however, permission came through, and charter operations started in August of this year, with many immigrants also flying in available seates on El Al's scheduled routes. In this operation, El Al, in cooperation with [[Aeroflot]], carried more than 400,000 Jewish immigrants to Israel within a three year period.<ref name="answers" /><ref>">{{cite news | title= El Al flies olim on first direct charter| work= [[Jerusalem Post]] | date= 1991-11-28 | accessdate=2007-05-31 | writer=Herb Keinin}}</ref>

On [[24 May]] [[1991]] an El Al [[Boeing 747]] airlifted a record-breaking 1,087 passengers, [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] flying from [[Addis Ababa]] to Israel as part of [[Operation Solomon]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://library.thinkquest.org/J0110426/records/records1.html | title=Aviation World Records | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Think Quest}}</ref> Within a few years, the airline had started flights to the [[Far East]], and in 1995, entered into its first code-sharing agreement with [[American Airlines]].<ref name="answers" /> In [[February]] [[1995]] El Al left the technical receivership it had been operating under since [[1982]]<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/3508/edition_id/62/format/html/displaystory.html | title=El Al Airlines posts $15 million profits | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Jewish Bulletin Online}}</ref> and in June 1996, another milestone was hit with the inaugural flight from Israel to [[Amman]], [[Jordan]].<ref name="History of El Al" /> [[Image:Operation Solomon.jpg|thumb|right|Ethiopian Jews boarding El Al aircraft during Operation Solomon]] 1996 saw the airline post losses  of $83.1 million, due partly to a new wave of terrorism, and the open-skies policy which was being adopted by the Israeli government at this time.<ref name="answers" /> During this difficult time, in order to keep its aircraft flying, El Al introduced flights "to nowhere" in which passengers could enjoy various in-flight entertainments while circling the Mediterranean. It also promoted day trips for shopping in London or visiting newly accessible sites of religious importance in eastern Europe.<ref name="answers" />

It was in 1997 that [[El Al Cargo|El Al's cargo branch]] became an independent entity.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.elal.co.il/ELAL/English/ELALCargo/ | title=El Al Cargo Profile | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=El Al}}</ref> El Al's first [[Boeing 777]] took off for the first time in March 2000, and later that year the debate regarding Sabbath flights was re-ignited when it was announced that it is estimated that the airline loses $55 million a year by not flying on Sabbath. It was expected that following the first phase of a long delayed [[privatisation]], which was initiated in [[June]] [[2003]] when 15% of the airline's shares were listed on the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]], the policy regarding Sabbath flights would be reversed.<ref name="History of El Al" /><ref name="shabbat" /> [[Arkia Israel Airlines]]' then-parent company, Knafaim-Arkia Holdings, acquired a large stake in mid-2004 and intended to take complete ownership.<ref name="History of El Al" /><ref name="shabbat" /> In order to satisfy Israeli anti-trust rulings, Knafaim-Arkia was forced to sell its stake in [[Arkia]].<REF>{{cite web

===Recent history===
[[Image:NewElAlLogo.JPG|left|thumb|El Al's logo from 2006]]

El Al has had success in serving the needs of the religious Jewish clientele who fly to and from Israel: it serves only kosher food (by most definitions), and long-haul flights typically feature passenger-led prayer-services. As a rule, El Al has not flown on [[Shabbat]], despite the possible loss of clientele. An estimated 20-30% of the company's passengers are Jewish Ultra-Orthodox, who mostly fly in certain seasons, and to certain destinations. Operating on Sabbath may result in a Haredi boycott, a major financial blow far exceeding the potential profits. <ref>{{cite news| title=Potential ultra-Orthodox boycott threatens to cripple El Al airlines |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/796900.html |date=2006-12-05 |last=Ettinger |first=Yair|publisher=Haaretz| quote=An official boycott could deal a fatal blow to El Al|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> In the aftermath of a November 2006 strike that temporarily shut down Tel-Aviv airport, El Al decided to fly some of their planes on Sabbath in order to get back on schedule.

In this case, a pregnant Irishwoman named [[Anne Mary Murphy]] was about to board an El Al flight at [[London]]'s [[Heathrow Airport]] when her bag was found to contain 3 pounds of plastic explosives. The explosives had been planted by her fiancé [[Nezar Hindawi]] who was to go on a separate flight.

== Destinations ==
{{further|[[El Al destinations]]}}

El Al serves destinations on four continents with a particularly developed network to [[Europe]]. The airline serves a number of gateway [[North American]] cities and has recently extended its service to include direct service to [[Los Angeles]] and [[Miami]]. Over the past few years, El Al has expanded its destinations to cover the [[Far East]], while retaining its limited coverage of [[Africa]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.airlineroutemaps.com/West_Asia/El_Al_europe.shtml | title=El Al European Route Map | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Airline Route Maps}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.airlineroutemaps.com/West_Asia/El_Al_international.shtml | title=El Al Worldwide Route Map | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Airline Route Maps}}</ref>

==Cargo==

El Al has a cargo branch, El Al Cargo, which became independent in 1997. As the national cargo airline of Israel, they operate a fleet of 4 [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-200]] aircraft to destinations in [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Prior to 2001, when the Israeli air cargo market was opened to competition, the airline occupied a monopolistic position in the market.<ref name="answers" />

==Security==

Due to terrorist actions on El Al throughout its history, the airline employs stringent security procedures, both on the ground and onboard its aircraft. These effective, and sometimes controversial, procedures have given El Al the reputation of being the more secure airline in the world.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2001/10/01/elal-usat.htm | title= 
Unfriendly skies are no match for El Al | date=2001-01-10| last=Walt| first=Vivienne| accessdate=2007-04-29| publisher=USA Today}}</ref> 

===On the plane===
Approximately six undercover agents (formerly two; exact numbers are never given for security purposes) with hidden firearms accompany each international El Al flight, sitting amongst passengers.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2097352.stm | title=El Al sets security standards | date=2002-07-05| accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Most El Al pilots are former [[Israeli Air Force]] fighter pilots, and all El Al flight crew members are trained in hand-to-hand combat. In fact, most El Al employees have served in the [[Israel Defense Force]] as national service is compulsory in Israel for most citizens.<ref name="Security">{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/09/26/rec.el.al.security | title=Model for air travel security may be El Al | date=2001-09-26| accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=CNN}}</ref>
[[Image:Elal.b777-200.4x-ecd.arp.jpg|thumb|El Al Boeing 777]]

The cockpits in all El Al [[aircraft]] have double doors to prevent entry by unauthorized people. A [[password|code]] is required to access the doors, and the second door will only be opened after the first has closed and the person has been identified by the [[Captain]] or [[First Officer]].<ref name="Security" /> Furthermore, there are reinforced [[steel]] floors separating the [[passenger]] [[cabin]] from the [[baggage]] hold.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&ObjectID=10396216 | title=Flying under the eagle eyes of El Al's famed high security | accessdate=2006-08-15 | publisher=New Zealand Herald|last=Silver |first=Eric| date=2006-08-15}}</ref> This is intended to strengthen the plane in case of an explosion in the hold or vice versa. The El Al fleet is also the only commercial airline fleet in the world to be equipped with anti-missile [[countermeasures]] by utilising the radar-based Flight Guard system.<ref name="antimissiles" /> [[Switzerland]] has threatened to refuse El Al flights landing rights if these systems are fitted because of fears that [[flares]] dropped by such an automated system might cause fires on the ground near airports, and other European governments have expressed similar views.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3221013,00.html | title=Europe objects to El Al's anti-missile shield | accessdate=2006-11-12 | last=Beck | first=Eldad| date=2006-02-26| publisher=Ynet News}}</ref> El Al does not comment about the specifications of these systems.

===On the ground===

Passengers are asked to report three hours before departure. All El Al terminals around the world are closely monitored by security agents in either plain clothes or fully armed local police or army personnel, who patrol the premises for explosives, suspicious behavior, and other threats. Inside, passengers and their baggage are checked by a trained team. El Al security procedures also require that all passengers be interviewed individually prior to boarding, allowing El Al staff to identify possible security threats with probing questions, such as their origin, the reason for them traveling and their job or occupation. The likelihood of potential terrorists maintaining their calmness under such inquisitive probing is considered low.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2001/09/12/israelisecurity.htm | title=Israeli-style security might have averted hijackings | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=USA Today| date=2001-09-13}}</ref>

At the [[check-in]] counter, ground staff scrutinize the [[passport]] and the [[Airline ticket|ticket]]. They will not accept a ticket without a sticker from the [[security]] checkers. Once through passport control, where the person's name is passed through computer checks utilising information from [[FBI]], [[Scotland Yard]], [[Shin Bet]] and [[Interpol]] databases, the passenger and their hand luggage go through rigorous screening, including hand searches. In addition, all luggage must pass through a decompression chamber simulating pressures during flight which may be triggers for explosives.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.segl.com/xj.php | title=El Al Decompression Chamber | accessdate=2006-07-18 | publisher=Simcoe Engineering Group Limited}}</ref> El Al is the only airline in the world that passes all luggage through such a chamber.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.israelinsider.com/channels/security/articles/sec_0108.htm | title=El Al's legendary security measures set industry standards | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Israel Insider | date=2001-10-03}}</ref> Even in airports in the United States, El Al security agents conduct all luggage searches personally, though they are often supervised by government or private security firms who otherwise have screening responsibilities,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2006-05-12-el-al-security_x.htm | title=El Al wants to do own bag screening at Newark | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=USA Today | date=2006-05-12}}</ref>.

===Controversy===

According to a report published by the Center Against Racism and the Arab Association for Human Rights in December 2006, there exists a situation during El Al security checks whereby passengers are racially profiled.<ref name="ArabReport">{{cite web | url=http://www.no-racism.org/arabic/data/publications/AirportReportEnglish.pdf | title=Suspected Citizens: Racial Profiling Against Arab Passengers by Israeli Airlines and Airports | last=Tarek |first=Ibrahim|year=2006| month=December |accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref> The report goes further to claim that this is unfair, irrational, and degrading to those undergoing the stringent screening procedures.

On the other hand, there are those, such as the political analyst [[Daniel Pipes]], who do not consider the policy of passenger profiling to be racist. According to Pipes, "however distasteful, there must be special scrutiny of Muslims in the West for security purposes."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/650 | title=What Security Measures vis-à-vis Western Muslims? | first=Daniel |last=Pipes|date=2006-08-10| accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref>

The airline was also criticised by the Hungarian courts for refusing to search luggage with the passenger present, whilst also acting against Hungarian domestic laws which stipulate that only authorized officials are able to undertake such searches.<Ref name="ArabReport"/>

While the stringent security measures have ensured that no El Al aircraft has been successfully hijacked since 1968, the apparent failure of these measures came under scrutiny on [[November 17]], [[2002]] when on an El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Turkey, Tawfiq Fukra, a twenty-three-year-old [[Israeli Arab]], was reported to have stabbed a flight attendant with a pocket knife and attempted to break into the cockpit in order to fly the aircraft back to Israel and crash it into a building,<REF>{{cite web

In May 2007, it was announced that El Al reached an agreement to lease six or seven aircraft from [[Boeing]] between 2011 and 2015 after canceling its option to buy eight [[Boeing 787]] aircraft. It is currently unclear what model these aircraft will be.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/DocView.asp?did=1000208163&fid=1725 | title=El Al, Boeing close to plane lease deal for 2011-15 | publisher=Globes | last=Tal| first=Dalia | date=2007-05-03 |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref>

==King David Lounge==
[[Image:BGN LY King David Lounge birdseyeview.jpg|thumb|King David Lounge at Ben Gurion International Airport]]
The King David Lounge is El Al's [[airport lounge]], serving the airline's premium class passengers. There are a total of five King David Lounges worldwide, located at [[Ben Gurion International Airport]], [[Charles de Gaulle International Airport]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], [[London Heathrow Airport]], and [[Los Angeles International Airport]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.elal.co.il/ELAL/English/MatmidFrequentFlyer/AboutTheClub/KingDavidClub.htm | title=El Al King David Lounge | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=El Al}}</ref>

The King David Lounges all offer slightly different services to passengers, however they all offer basics such as drinks, snacks, newspapers (Israeli and International), and magazines. Some lounges also offer free [[Wi-Fi]] internet access. The King David Lounge in Ben Gurion International Airport's Terminal 3 includes a special area for first class passengers, telephones, massage facilities, showers, and even a [[spa]].<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.elal.co.il/ELAL/English/AllAboutYourFlight/PremiumClasses/FirstClass/kingDavidLounge.htm | title=El Al King David Lounge Spa | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=El Al}}</ref>

El Al also has agreements with other companies to provide services at the lounges: [[Arcaffe]] offers coffee and baked goods, [[Strauss (company)|Strauss]] offers breakfasts, and [[Tnuva]], which provides health food meals.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000173171&fid=942 | title=El Al signs cooperation agreements with 3 European carriers | publisher=Globes | last=Tal |first=Dalia |date=2007-01-16 |accessdate=2007-01-16}}</ref>

==Livery==

El Al's historic, now superseded livery featured a turquoise/navy blue stripe down the side of aircraft, and a turquoise tailfin with the [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flag]] at the top. El Al's logo was featured above the front run of windows on each side of the plane in the turquoise/navy scheme.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.airliners.net/open.file?id=1166039&WxsIERv=Obrvat%20757-258&Wm=0&WdsYXMg=Ry%20Ny%20Vfenry%20Nveyvarf&QtODMg=Zvyna%20-%20Znycrafn%20%28ZKC%20%2F%20YVZP%29&ERDLTkt=Vgnyl&ktODMp=Qrprzore%2024%2C%202006&BP=0&WNEb25u=Raevpb%20Cvreboba%20FcbgVG&xsIERvdWdsY=4K-ROG&MgTUQtODMgKE=&YXMgTUQtODMgKERD=973&NEb25uZWxs=2007-01-22%2021%3A01%3A02&ODJ9dvCE=&O89Dcjdg=25036%2F356&static=yes&width=1024&height=694&sok=JURER%20%20%28nvepensg_trarevp%20YVXR%20%27Obrvat%20757%25%27%29%20NAQ%20%28nveyvar%20YVXR%20%27Ry%20Ny%20Vfenry%20Nveyvarf%25%27%29%20%20BEQRE%20OL%20cubgb_vq%20QRFP&photo_nr=10&prev_id=1174285&next_id=1164049 | title=El Al Superseded Livery | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=Airliners.net}}</ref> The replacement livery featured a ribbon effect blue stripe with a thick silver border on the bottom.
