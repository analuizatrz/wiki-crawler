'''Gordon James O'Connor,''' [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]], [[Order of Military Merit (Canada)|OMM]],  [[Canadian Forces Decoration|CD]], BA, B.Sc., [[Member of Parliament|MP]] (born [[May 18]], [[1939]]) is a retired [[Brigadier-General]], current [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Canadian House of Commons|Member of Parliament]] and the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]]. He is one of a few Defence Ministers to have served in the military, the last being [[Gilles Lamontagne]].

Born in [[Toronto, Ontario]], he has a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc]] Mathematics and Physics from [[Concordia University]] and [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Philosophy from [[York University]].

He served over 30 years in the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Army]], starting as a Second Lieutenant in the Armour Branch, retiring with the rank of Brigadier General. 

He then entered the private sector as Vice-President of Business Development for a large facility management firm, and Vice-President Operations for a vehicle testing centre. 

He was a Senior Associate with [[Hill & Knowlton]] Canada, a world-wide public relations, public affairs and strategic communications company.  O'Connor has also been an official [[lobbyist]] for several [[defense industry]] companies.  These companies include: [[BAE Systems]] (1996 to 2004), [[General Dynamics]] (1996 to 2001), [[Atlas Elektronik GmbH]] (1999 to 2004), and [[Airbus Military]] (2001 to 2004) <sup>[http://www.matthewgood.org/mblog/?p=891]</sup>.

He was elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 elections]] as a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] candidate in the [[Ottawa]] riding of [[Carleton—Mississippi Mills]] with slightly more than 50% of the vote. After winning he became Defence Critic for the Official Opposition. His vote share increased in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 election]]. He is an honorary member of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] student #S157.

Gordon is married and has two children, both of them are adults. He now lives in Kanata, Ontario where he has lived for over 20 years.

==Cabinet selection==

Though somewhat muted by the higher profile issues in the naming of [[David Emerson]] and [[Michael Fortier]] to the cabinet, the posting of O'Connor to the position of [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper|Harper]] was met with controversy.  Harkening back to ethics and accountability issues including a promised crackdown on lobbying and reforms to lobbying legislation [http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1139267414551&call_pageid=968332188774&col=968350116467] that Harper raised during the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], O'Connor's employment as a lobbyist for several major defence industry companies including some of the world's largest military contractors, such as [[General Dynamics]], [[BAE Systems]] and [[Airbus]] as recently as 2004 was seen by many as peculiar. Some feared that with the posting the minister would often be dealing with the very companies for whom he advised for and assisted in soliciting defence contracts; seemingly putting him in constant peril of conflict-of-interest issues[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/realitycheck/20060208.html]. However, the aim of the Accountability Act is to prevent people from moving from government to lobbying, and not the opposite as was the case with O'Connor (at least not this time, although in the past he went from General of the Canadian Forces to lobbyist)

There were potential conflict-of-interest issues early in his term as one of the first major issues the Conservatives pledged they would sort out is the replacement of the Forces 'tactical airlift' fleet. One of the most prominent companies bidding for the contract to replace the present fleet of [[C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules Turboprops]] is [[Airbus S.A.S.]] for whom O'Connor worked as a lobbyist until February 2004, lobbying the former Liberal government to purchase the airplane that would become the [[Airbus A400M]] for its tactical airlift fleet[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060208.OCONNOR08/TPStory/National].

==Tenure as Minister==
As soon as Gordon O'Connor became Minister of National Defence, the Canadian Government decided to purchase 4 [[C-17 Globemaster III]]s, manufactured by [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems]] for 3.4 billion dollars, 16 [[CH-47 Chinook]] medium lift helicopters, also from [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems]], for 4.7 billion dollars<ref>[http://www.dnd.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1966]</ref>, 17 [[C-130J]]s from [[Lockheed-Martin]] for 4.9 billion dollars<ref>[http://www.dnd.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1971]</ref>, 2300 [[Medium-Sized Logistics Trucks]] for 1.1 billion dollars<ref>[http://www.dnd.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1962]</ref>, and 2.9 billion dollars for 3 [[Joint Support Ships]]<ref>[http://www.dnd.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1959]</ref>, for a total of 17 billion dollars.

O'Connor announced on May 30th 2006 that the [[Canadian Forces]] would be suspending usage of the [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|Mercedes G-Wagon]] combat vehicle to on-base operations only, after a number of Canadian soldiers were killed while travelling in the lightly-armoured vehicle. However, three months later it was revealed that no such order was ever given, and the controversial vehicles were still being used in combat operations.[http://thechronicleherald.ca/Canada/521909.html]

==Controversy ==

===Afghanistan===

{{main|Canadian Afghan detainee abuse scandal}}

In May 2005, as Canada's policy of detaining people in Afghanistan and transferring them to units of the Afghan police known for torture, O'Connor told Parliament that the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]: "The Red Cross or the Red Crescent is responsible to supervise their treatment once the prisoners are in the hands of the Afghan authorities. If there is something wrong with their treatment, the Red Cross or Red Crescent would inform us and we would take action."

This statement was later denied by the ICRC, which stated that it was "informed of the agreement, but ... not a party to it and ... not monitoring the implementation of it."  The ICRC also advised that, in accordance with its normal operating procedure, it would not notify any foreign government (Canada included) of abuse found in Afghan prisons. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070308.wdetainees07/BNStory/National/home|first=Paul|last=Koring|title=Red Cross contradicts Ottawa on detainees|publisher=Globe and Mail|date=8 March 2007|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>

On March 13, O'Connor travelled to [[Kandahar]] to meet with Abdul Noorzai of the [[Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission]], "look the man in the eyes", and gain assurances that detainees were being supervised. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070313.woconnor0313/BNStory/Afghanistan/|first=Joe|last=Friesen|title=O'Connor fails to meet Afghan watchdog|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=13 March 2007|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>

O'Connor subsequently acknowledged in a [http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=2217 official release] that his statement in Parliament was not true, and that the ICRC was not monitoring detainees and not informing Canada as he claimed. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/19/afghanaplogy.html|title=O'Connor sorry for misinforming House on Afghan detainees|publisher=CBC News|date=19 March 2007|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>

Additional controversy was generated in the week of April 23 when ''The Globe and Mail'' reported that 30 Afghan men formerly under Canadian custody alleged they had been tortured by their Afghan captors <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070423.DETAINEE23/TPStory/?query=From+Canadian+custody+into+cruel+hands|title=From Canadian custody into cruel hands|first=Graeme|last=Smith|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=23 April 2007|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>.  Two days later, another ''Globe'' story ran on a government report from which "negative references to acts such as torture, abuse, and extra judicial killings were blacked out without an explanation." <ref name="globeandmail-20070425">{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070425.DETAINEE25/TPStory/National|title=What Ottawa doesn't want you to know|publisher=The Globe and Mail|first=Paul|last=Koring|date=25 April 2007|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> The difficulties faced by O'Connor were exacerbated after various government ministers and Stephen Harper himself gave aparently conflicting testimony on the existence and nature of the agreement with Afghan forces to supervise detainees. <ref name="globeandmail-20070425"/>

Following these revelations, the opposition parties unanimously demanded O'Connor's resignation; a demand echoed by some press commentators such as [[Andrew Coyne]].  Stephen Harper has resisted all calls for O'Connor's dismissal. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070425.wdetaineesreax25/BNStory/Front|title=Harper stands by O'Connor as furor grows|publisher=The Globe and Mail|first=Daniel|last=Leblanc|date=25 April 2007|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>

An anonymous Conservative source was quoted as saying that despite losing Harper's confidence, O'Connor would not be dismissed lest his removal send the wrong message: "If it's interpreted as us wavering, or any weakening of resolve that somehow we're on the wrong course, those questions would get asked... The Taliban would see it as a positive thing." <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070426.DETAINEEANALYSIS26/TPStory/|title=PM stands by O'Connor -- but for the wrong reasons|publisher=The Globe and Mail|first=Brian|last=Laghi|date=26 April 2007|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>

O'Connor also faced criticism for remarks that Canada was in Afghanistan as an act of retribution for  
[[9/11]]. [http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=3a784a6c-a6fc-490e-bccd-62cefb82cbad&p=2]

===Letter to Donald Rumsfeld===

In December 2006 O'Connor wrote to [[Donald Rumsfeld]] praising his "leadership" and seeking "to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your many achievements (sic) as Secretary of Defence, and to recognise the significant contribution you have made in the fight against terrorism". <ref>http://news.independent.co.uk/fisk/article2768261.ece</ref>
