'''Ernesto Guevara de la Serna''' ([[June 14]], [[1928]] – [[October 9]], [[1967]]), commonly known as '''Che Guevara''', '''el Che''', or simply '''Che'''; was an [[Argentina|Argentinean]] [[Marxist]] [[revolutionary]], political figure, author, [[Foco|military theorist]], and leader of [[Cuba]]n and [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] [[guerrillas]]. His ubiquitous [[Che Guevara (photo)|image]] also later morphed into a [[countercultural]] alpha-numeric [[symbol]], utilized by youth and [[leftist]] inspired movements throughout the world. 

As a young medical student, Guevara embarked on a journey throughout [[Latin America]] and was transformed by the endemic [[poverty]] he witnessed. His experiences and observations during these trips led him to the conclusion that the region's [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] inequalities were an insidious result of [[Anti-capitalism|capitalism]], [[neo-colonialism]], and [[Anti-imperialism|imperialism]], with the only remedy being [[world revolution]]. This belief prompted his involvement in [[Guatemala|Guatemala's]] social revolution under President [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]], whose eventual [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|CIA assisted overthrow]] solidified Guevara’s [[Guevarism|radical ideology]]. 

Later while in [[Mexico]] he joined [[Fidel Castro|Fidel Castro’s]] [[26th of July Movement]], in which he was promoted to commander and played a [[Battle of Santa Clara|pivotal role]] as "Castro's brain",{{dubious}} in the successful guerrilla campaign to seize power from the US backed Cuban dictator [[Fulgencio Batista]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,869742,00.html ''"Castro's Brain"'', Aug 8 1960, Cover Story for Time Magazine]</ref>{{dubious}} After the [[Cuban revolution]], Guevara served in many prominent governmental positions including President of the National Bank and “supreme prosecutor” over the revolutionary tribunals and executions of suspected war criminals from the previous regime. Along with traveling around the world meeting important leaders on behalf of Cuban socialism, he was also a prolific author of an assortment of books, including a [[Guerrilla Warfare (book)|classic manual]] on the theory and practice of [[guerrilla warfare]]. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to incite revolutions first in an unsuccessful attempt in [[Congo-Kinshasa]] and ultimately in [[Bolivia]], where he was captured with help of the [[CIA]] and executed.

Both notorious for his disciplined brutality and revered for his unwavering dedication to his revolutionary doctrines, Guevara remains a controversial and respected historical figure.{{Clarifyme|date=March 2008}} Because of his death, invocation to armed [[class struggle]], and romantic visage; Guevara became an inspirational [[icon]] of [[socialism|socialist]] revolutionary movements worldwide, as well as a global [[Commodity|merchandising]] sensation. He has since been venerated and reviled in [[Additional materials on Che Guevara|dozens]] of biographies, memoirs, books, essays, documentaries, songs, and films, while being referred to as everything from a "saint" to a "butcher." [[Time Magazine]] professed him to be one of the 100 most influential people of the [[20th century]],<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/time100/heroes/profile/guevara01.html Time 100: Che Guevara] By Ariel Dorfman, [[June 14]] [[1999]]. </ref> while an [[Alberto Korda]] [[Che Guevara (photo)|photo]] of him (shown) has been declared "the most famous photograph in the world."<ref>Maryland Institute of Art, referenced at BBC News, "Che Guevara photographer dies", 26 May 2001.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1352650.stm Online at BBC News], accessed [[January 4]][[2006]].</ref>

==Early life==

Ernesto Guevara de la Serna was born on [[June 14]], [[1928]] in [[Rosario]], [[Argentina]], the eldest of five children in a family of mixed [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] descent. Both his father and mother were of [[Basque people|Basque]] ancestry.{{cref|Basque}} Growing up in a family with [[leftist]] leanings, Guevara became known for his radical perspective even as a boy, idolizing [[Francisco Pizarro]] while yearning to have been one of his soldiers. Though suffering from the crippling bouts of [[asthma]] that were to afflict him throughout his life, he excelled as an athlete. He was an avid [[rugby union]] player despite his handicap and earned himself the nickname "Fuser"&mdash;a contraction of "El Furibundo" (English: raging) and his mother's surname, "Serna"&mdash;for his aggressive style of play.<!--<ref>{{Citation

Guevara learned [[chess]] from his father and began participating in local tournaments by the age of 12.<!--<ref>Digital Granma Internacional, "Simultaneous chess game on 37th anniversary of Che’s death", [[13 October]] [[2004]]. [http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2004/octubre/mier13/42CHE.html Online at Granma International English Edition], accessed [[January 5]], [[2006]].</ref>--> During his adolescence, he became passionate about poetry, especially that of [[Pablo Neruda]], [[John Keats]], and Sara De Ibáñez. It is also said that he memorized [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling's]] [["If"]] by heart. The Guevara home contained more than 3,000 books which allowed Guevara to be an enthusiastic and eclectic reader, with interests comprising of [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[André Gide|Gide]] and [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]. He also enjoyed adventure classics by [[Jack London]], [[Emilio Salgari]], and [[Jules Verne]] as well as essays by [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Bertrand Russell]].{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

In 1948 Guevara entered the [[University of Buenos Aires]] to study medicine and fell in love with 16-year-old Maria del Carmen Ferreyra.<ref name=che1>{{Citation

Guevara took notes during this trip and wrote an account using extracts from his notes entitled [[The Motorcycle Diaries]]. 
 
Witnessing the widespread poverty, [[oppression]] and disenfranchisement throughout Latin America, and influenced by his readings of [[Marxist]] literature, Guevara began to view armed revolution as the solution to social inequality. By trip's end, he also viewed Latin America not as separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide liberation strategy. His conception of a borderless, united [[Hispanic America]] sharing a common '[[mestizo]]' culture{{cref|Hispanic America}} was a theme that prominently recurred during his later revolutionary activities. Upon returning to Argentina, he completed his medical studies and received the diploma accrediting him as a medic on [[12 June]] [[1953]].{{cref|Diploma}}

==Guatemala==
On [[7 July]] [[1953]], Guevara set out on a trip through [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]. In December 1953 he arrived in [[Guatemala]] where President [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]] headed a democratically elected government that, through [[land reform]] and other initiatives, was attempting to end the U.S.-dominated ''[[latifundia]]'' system. Guevara decided to settle down in Guatemala so as to perfect himself{{Clarifyme|date=March 2008}} and do what was necessary to become a true revolutionary.<ref>Guevara Lynch, Ernesto.

In Guatemala City, Guevara sought out Hilda Gadea Acosta, a Peruvian economist who was well-connected politically as a member of the socialist [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA) led by [[Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre]]. She introduced Guevara to a number of high-level officials in the [[Arbenz]] government. Guevara also established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to [[Fidel Castro]] through the revolutionary attack on the  [[Moncada Barracks]]  in [[Santiago de Cuba]].<ref>Radio Cadena Agramonte, "Ataque al cuartel del Bayamo" [http://www.cadenagramonte.cubaweb.cu/historia/cuartel_bayamo.asp Online], accessed [[February 25]] [[2006]]</ref> During this period he acquired his famous nickname, "Che", due to his frequent use of the Argentine [[interjection]] [[Che (Spanish)|''Che'']] ({{pronounced|tʃe}}), which is used in much the same way as "hey", "pal", "[[eh]]", or "mate"; and employed colloquially now in various English-speaking countries.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

Guevara's attempts to obtain a medical internship were unsuccessful and his economic situation was often precarious.<!--<ref name=precarious> Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 139–141</ref>--> He kept away from any political organization, even though his political thinking at the time was clearly sympathetic toward [[Marxism]].{{Who|date=March 2008}} On [[May 15]], [[1954]] a shipment of [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] infantry and light artillery weapons was sent from [[Communist]] [[Czechoslovakia]] for the Arbenz Government and arrived in [[Puerto Barrios]].<ref name=usdepstate>

''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 144</ref> prompting a CIA-sponsored coup attempt.<ref name=usdepstate />  Guevara was eager to fight on behalf of Arbenz and joined an armed [[militia]] organized by the Communist Youth for that purpose, but frustrated with the group's inaction, he soon returned to medical duties. Following the coup, he again volunteered to fight, but soon after, Arbenz took refuge in the Mexican Embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country. After Hilda Gadea was arrested, Guevara sought protection inside the Argentine [[consulate]], where he remained until he received a safe-conduct pass some weeks later and made his way to [[Mexico]].<ref>Taibo, Paco Ignacio II. ''Ernesto Guevara, también conocido como el Che'', p. 74.</ref>

The overthrow of the Arbenz regime by a [[Operation PBSUCCESS|coup d'état backed by the Central Intelligence Agency]] cemented Guevara's view of the United States as an [[imperialism|imperialist]] power that would oppose and attempt to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries. This strengthened his conviction that Marxism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions.

Guevara arrived in [[Mexico City]] in early September 1954, and renewed his friendship with the other Cuban exiles whom he had known in Guatemala. In June 1955, López introduced him to [[Raúl Castro]] who later introduced him to his older brother,  [[Fidel Castro]], the revolutionary leader who had formed the [[26th of July Movement]] and was now plotting to overthrow the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]] in what became the [[Cuban Revolution]]. Guevara recognized at once that Castro was the cause for which he had been searching. 

Although he planned to be the group's medic, Guevara participated in the military training with the members of the Movement, and, at the end of the course, was called "the best guerrilla of them all" by their instructor, Colonel  [[Alberto Bayo]].<ref name=anderson2>{{Citation| last =Anderson| first =Jon Lee| year =1997

}}.</ref> The first step in Castro's revolutionary plan was an assault on Cuba from Mexico via the ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]],'' an old, leaky cabin cruiser. They set out for Cuba on [[November 25]], [[1956]]. Attacked by Batista's military soon after landing, most of the 82 men were either killed in the attack or executed upon capture.{{cn}} Guevara wrote that it was during this bloody confrontation that he laid down his medical supplies and picked up a box of ammunition dropped by a fleeing comrade, finalizing his symbolic transition from physician to combatant.

Only a small band of revolutionaries survived to re-group as a bedraggled fighting force deep in the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains, where they received support from the [[urban guerrilla]] network of [[Frank País]], the [[26th of July Movement]], and local country folk. With the group withdrawn to the [[Sierra]], the world wondered whether Castro was alive or dead until the famous [[Herbert Matthews]] interview with Castro appeared in the [[New York Times]] in early 1957, presenting a lasting, almost mythical image for Castro. Guevara was not present for that interview, but in the coming months he began to realize the importance of the interview that created an icon of a bearded Castro dressed in fatigues, legitimizing the Cuban Revolution. Meanwhile, as supplies and morale grew low, Che considered these "the most painful days of the war."<ref name=DePalma1>{{Citation| last =DePalma| first =Anthony| year =2006

At this point Castro unexpectedly promoted Che to ''comandante'' of a second army column. As Che considered his tactics, he imposed even more ruthless treatment as a strict disciplinarian whose harsh methods were already notorious among the rebel fighters. Deserters were severely punished as traitors, and Guevara was known to send execution squads to hunt down deserters seeking to escape.<ref>Anderson, Jon Lee (1997), Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, New York: Grove Press, pp. 269–270, ISBN 0-8021-1600-0</ref> As a result, Guevara became feared for his brutality and ruthlessness.<ref>Castañeda, Jorge G., Che Guevara: Compañero, New York: 1998, Random House, pp 105, 119.</ref> During the guerrilla campaign, he was responsible for the [[execution]] of a number of men accused of being [[Informant|informers]], [[Desertion|deserters]] or [[Espionage|spies]].<ref name="execution-squads">Anderson pp. 269–270, 277–278.</ref> As the war extended, Guevara led a new column of fighters dispatched westward for the final push towards [[Havana]].

Shortly thereafter, he divorced Hilda Gadea, who was still in Mexico. On [[June 2]], [[1959]], he married Aleida March,{{cref|Children}} a Cuban-born member of the 26th of July movement with whom he had been living since late 1958.

During the rebellion against Batista's dictatorship, the general command of the rebel army, led by Fidel Castro, introduced into the liberated territories the 19th-century penal law commonly known as the Ley de la Sierra{{cref|Ley de la Sierra}}.{{clarifyme}}{{cn}} This law included the death penalty for extremely serious crimes, whether perpetrated by the dictatorship or by supporters of the revolution. In 1959, the revolutionary government extended its application to the whole of the republic and to war criminals captured and tried after the revolution. This latter extension, supported by the majority of the population, followed the same procedure as those seen in the [[Nuremberg Trials]] held by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after [[World War II]].<ref>Thirty Years of Cuban Revolutionary Penal Law, by Raul Gomez Treto, Latin American Perspectives, Vol. 18, No. 2, Cuban Views on the Revolution (Spring, 1991), pp. 114-125 (pg 115-116)</ref> To implement this plan, Castro named Guevara commander of the [[La Cabaña Fortress]] prison, for a five-month tenure ([[January 2]] through [[June 12]], [[1959]]).<ref>Anderson, Jon Lee.

On 12 June 1959, as soon as  Guevara returned to Havana, Castro sent him out on a three-month tour of fourteen countries, most of them [[Asian-African Conference|Bandung Pact]] members in Africa and Asia. Sending Che from Havana allowed Castro to appear to be distancing himself from Che and his [[Communism]], that troubled both the United States and Castro's [[26th of July Movement|M-26-7]] members.<ref name=anderson1b>Anderson, Jon Lee.

When he returned to Cuba in September 1959, he found Castro now had more political power. The government had begun land seizures included in the agrarian reform law, but was backing off on the compensation offers to landowners, alerting the United States who was becoming wary. The popular leader, [[Huber Matos]],  had joined the resisters, acting as the chief spokesman for the M-26-7. Castro began cleaning house with a showdown with Matos.<ref name=anderson3a>Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', ISBN 0-8021-1600-0, New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 434&ndash;437.</ref> Abruptly, Castro appointed Guevara chief official at the National Institute of Agrarian Reform,{{cref|INRA}}, and President of the National Bank of Cuba,{{cref|BNC}} while allowing him to retain his military rank. Although seeming to be a strange choice for the important position, Che had been promoting the creation of self-sufficient industries since days of the [[Sierra Maestra]]. Che was expecting the U.S. to invade, and the Cuban population to then leave the cities and fight as guerillas, although Che's hopes for armed uprisings elsewhere were failing.<ref name=anderson4a>Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', ISBN 0-8021-1600-0, New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 438&ndash;439.</ref> 

In 1960 Guevara provided first aid to victims when the freighter ''[[La Coubre explosion|La Coubre]]'', a French vessel carrying munitions from the port of Antwerp, exploded twice while it was being unloaded in Havana harbor, resulting in well over a hundred dead.<ref>Cuban Information Archives, "La Coubre explodes in Havana 1960."

Guevara later served as Minister of Industries, a post in which he helped formulate Cuban [[socialism]], and became one of the country's most prominent figures. He called for the diversification of the Cuban economy, and for the elimination of material incentives. He believed that volunteer work and dedication of workers would drive economic growth and all that was needed was will. To display this, Guevara led by example, working endlessly at his ministry job, in construction, and even cutting sugar cane, as did Castro.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/p_guevara.html PBS: Che Guevara, Popular but Ineffective]</ref> During this time he also wrote several publications advocating a replication of the Cuban revolutionary model, promoting small rural guerrilla groups (''[[foco theory]]'') as an alternative to massive armed insurrection.

Guevara did not participate in the fighting of the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], having been ordered by Castro to a command post in Cuba's western [[Pinar del Río Province|Pinar del Río province]] where he fended off a decoy force.{{cn}} He suffered a bullet wound to the face during this deployment, saying that it had been caused by the accidental discharge of his own gun.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}<!--<ref name=anderson2>Anderson, Jon Lee.

In [[Algiers]] on [[24 February]], [[1965]], he made what turned out to be his last public appearance on the international stage when he delivered a speech at an economic seminar on Afro-Asian solidarity.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, (editors Rolando E.

Two weeks later, in 1965 Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished altogether. His whereabouts were a great mystery in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself. His disappearance was variously attributed to the failure of the [[industrialization]] scheme he had advocated while minister of industry, to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials disapproving of Guevara's pro-[[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] stance on the [[Sino-Soviet split]], and to serious differences between Guevara and the pragmatic Castro regarding Cuba's economic development and ideological line. Castro had grown increasingly wary of Guevara's popularity and considered him a potential threat. Castro's critics sometimes say his explanations for Guevara's disappearance have always been suspect. 

The coincidence of Guevara's views with those expounded by the Chinese Communist leadership was increasingly problematic for Cuba as the nation's economy became more and more dependent on the Soviet Union. Since the early days of the Cuban revolution, Guevara had been considered by many an advocate of [[Maoism|Maoist]] strategy in Latin America and the originator of a plan for the rapid industrialization of Cuba which was frequently compared to China's "[[Great Leap Forward]]". According to Western observers of the Cuban situation, the fact that Guevara was opposed to Soviet conditions and recommendations that Castro pragmatically saw as necessary might also have been the reason for his disappearance. However, both Guevara and Castro were supportive publicly of the idea of a united front.

Following the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and what Guevara perceived as a Soviet betrayal of Cuba when [[Castro]] convinced [[Khrushchev]] to withdraw the missiles from Cuban territory, Guevara had grown more skeptical of the Soviet Union. As revealed in his last speech in Algiers, he had come to view the [[Northern Hemisphere]], led by the U.S. in the West and the Soviet Union in the East, as the exploiter of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. He strongly supported [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]] [[North Vietnam]] in the [[Vietnam War]], and urged the peoples of other developing countries to take up arms and create "many Vietnams".<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, "English Translation of Complete Text of his ''Message to the Tricontinental''", or see [[s:es:Mensaje a los Pueblos del Mundo|Original Spanish text at Wikisource]]
.</ref>

Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara's fate, Castro stated on [[16 June]] [[1965]] that the people would be informed about Guevara when Guevara himself wished to let them know. Numerous rumors about his disappearance spread both inside and outside Cuba. On 3 October of that year, Castro revealed an undated letter purportedly written to him by Guevara some months earlier in which Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight abroad for the revolutionary cause, resigning from all his positions in the government and the party and renouncing his honorary Cuban citizenship.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, "Che Guevara's Farewell Letter", 1965. English translation of complete text: [[s:Che Guevara's Farewell Letter|Che Guevara's Farewell Letter at Wikisource]].</ref> Guevara's fate remained a mystery at the end of 1965 and his movements and whereabouts continued to be a closely held secret for the next two years.

During the time that his whereabouts were unknown, in 1965, Guevara decided to venture to Africa and offer his knowledge and experience as a guerrilla to the ongoing war in the Congo. According to [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] who was president of [[Algeria]] at the time and who talked with Guevara, Che thought that Africa was imperialism's weak link and therefore had enormous revolutionary potential.<ref>

South African mercenaries including [[Mike Hoare]] and [[Cuba]]n exiles worked with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] army to thwart Guevara. They were able to monitor his communications, to arrange to ambush the rebels and the Cubans whenever they attempted to attack, and to interdict his supply lines.<!--<ref>African History Blog, "Che Guevara's Exploits in the Congo", [http://africanhistory.about.com/b/a/227091.htm Che Guevara's Exploits in the Congo Online at African History], accessed [[January 5]] [[2006]].</ref>--><!--<ref>Mad Mike Hoare Site, "Mad Mike".

Guevara's aim was to export the Cuban Revolution by instructing local Simba fighters in communist ideology and [[foco theory]] strategies of [[guerrilla warfare]]. In his ''Congo Diary'', he cites the incompetence, intransigence and infighting of the local Congolese forces as key reasons for the revolt's failure.<ref>Ireland's Own, "From Cuba to Congo, Dream to Disaster for Che Guevara". [http://irelandsown.net/Che2.html Online at irelandsown.net], accessed [[January 11]] [[2006]].</ref> Later that year, ill with dysentery, suffering from asthma, and disheartened after seven months of frustrations, Guevara left the Congo with the Cuban survivors. (Six members of his column had died.) At one point Guevara considered sending the wounded back to Cuba, then standing alone and fighting until the end in the Congo as a revolutionary example; however, after being urged by his comrades and pressed by two emissaries sent by Castro, at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to leave the Congo. A few weeks later, writing the preface to the diary he kept during the Congo venture, he began: "This is the history of a failure."<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, translated from the Spanish by Patrick Camiller, ''The African Dream'', New York: Grove Publishers, 2000, p.1.</ref>

Because Castro had made public Guevara's "farewell letter" to him&mdash;a letter Guevara had intended should only be revealed in case of his death&mdash;wherein he had written that he was severing all ties to Cuba in order to devote himself to revolutionary activities in other parts of the world, he felt he could not return to Cuba with the surviving combatants for moral reasons,<ref>Castañeda, Jorge G., ''Che Guevara: Compañero'', New York: 1998, Random House, p 316.</ref>  and he spent the next six months living clandestinely in Dar es Salaam and [[Prague]]. During this time he compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience, and wrote drafts of two more books, one on philosophy<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, ''Apuntes Filosóficos'', draft.</ref> and the other on economics.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, ''Notas Económicas'', draft.</ref> He also visited several countries in Western Europe to test a new false identity and the corresponding documentation (passport, etc.) created for him by [[DGI|Cuban Intelligence]] that he planned to use to travel to South America. Throughout this period Castro continued to importune him to return to Cuba, but Guevara only agreed to do so when it was understood he would be there only for the few months needed to prepare a revolutionary effort somewhere in Latin America, and that his presence on the island would be secret.

==Bolivia==
[[Image:CheinBolivia1.jpg|thumb|left|220px|In rural [[Bolivia]] shortly before his death, 1967.]] 

Guevara's location was still unknown. Representatives of the independence movement of [[Mozambique]], the  [[FRELIMO]], reported that they met with Guevara in late 1966 or early 1967 in Dar es Salaam regarding his offer to aid in their revolutionary project which they ultimately rejected.<ref>Mittleman, James H. ''Underdevelopment and the Transition to Socialism - Mozambique and Tanzania'', New York: 1981, Academic Press, p. 38.</ref> In a speech at the 1967 [[May Day]] rally in Havana, the Acting Minister of the armed forces, Major [[Juan Almeida]], announced that Guevara was "serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America". The persistent reports that he was leading the guerrillas in Bolivia were eventually shown to be true.

At Castro's behest, a parcel of jungle land in the remote Ñancahuazú region had been purchased by native Bolivian Communists for Guevara to use as a training area and base camp. 

Training at this camp in the Ñancahuazú valley proved to be more hazardous than combat to Guevara and the Cubans accompanying him. Little was accomplished in the way of building a guerrilla army. Former [[Stasi]] operative [[Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider]], better known by her ''[[nom de guerre]]'' "Tania", who had been installed as his primary agent in La Paz, was reportedly also working for the [[KGB]] and is widely inferred to have unwittingly served Soviet interests by leading Bolivian authorities to Guevara's trail.<ref>Major Donald R. Selvage - USMC, "Che Guevara in Bolivia", [[1 April]] [[1985]].

[[Image:Vallegrande location.png|thumb||160px|right|Map of Bolivia showing location of [[Vallegrande]].]]
Guevara's guerrilla force, numbering about 50 and operating as the ELN (''Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Bolivia''; "[[National Liberation Army of Bolivia]]"), was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian regulars in the difficult terrain of the mountainous [[Camiri]] region. In September, however, the Army managed to eliminate two guerrilla groups in a violent battle, reportedly killing one of the leaders. 

Guevara's plan for fomenting revolution in Bolivia appears to have been unsuccessful because it was based upon three primary misconceptions:
*He had expected to deal only with the country's military government and its poorly trained and equipped army. However, Guevara was unaware that the U.S. government had sent the CIA and other operatives into Bolivia to aid the anti-insurrection effort. The Bolivian Army was trained and supplied by [[U.S. Army Special Forces]]{{cref|USMilitary}} advisors, including a recently organized elite battalion of [[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]] trained in [[jungle warfare]] that set up camp in [[La Esperanza]], a small settlement close to the location of Guevara's guerillas.<ref>U.S. Army, "[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB5/che14_1.htm Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Activation, Organization and Training of the 2d Ranger Battalion – Bolivian Army ([[28 April]] [[1967]])]".

'' The Fall of Che Guevara: A Story of Soldiers, Spies, and Diplomats'', New York, 1998: Oxford University Press, p 82–102, inter alia.</ref>
*Guevara had expected assistance and cooperation from the local dissidents which he did not receive, nor did he receive support from Bolivia's Communist Party, under the leadership of [[Mario Monje]], which was oriented toward Moscow rather than Havana.
*He had expected to remain in radio contact with Havana. However, the two shortwave transmitters provided to him by Cuba were faulty; the guerrillas were unable to communicate with Havana and Guevara was therefore on his own, receiving no support from Cuba.

In addition, his known preference for confrontation rather than compromise, which had previously surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba, contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local leaders in Bolivia, just as it had in the Congo.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, "Excerpt from ''Pasajes de la guerra revolucionaria:Congo''",[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&fuseaction=va2.document&identifier=5034C64B-96B6-175C-97A3C636C37896FB&sort=Collection&item=The%20Cold%20War%20in%20Africa Online at Cold War International History Project], accessed [[April 26]] [[2006]].</ref> This tendency had existed in Cuba, but had been kept in check by the timely interventions and guidance of Fidel Castro.<ref>Castañeda, Jorge G.

==Capture and execution==
[[Image:Cheexecuted.jpg|thumb|220px|Che Guevara's corpse was displayed to the World's press after his execution.]]

The hunt for Guevara in Bolivia was headed by [[Félix Rodríguez (Central Intelligence Agency)|Félix Rodríguez]], a [[CIA]] operative.<ref>Rodriguez, Felix I. and John Weisman. ''Shadow Warrior/the CIA Hero of a Hundred Unknown Battles (Hardcover)'', New York: 1989, Publisher: Simon & Schuster.</ref><ref>NewsMax, "Félix Rodríguez:Kerry No Foe of Castro". [http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/8/29/113445.shtml Online], accessed [[February 27]] [[2006]].</ref> On 7 October, an informant apprised the Bolivian Special Forces of the location of Guevara's guerrilla encampment in the Yuro ravine. They encircled the area, and Guevara was wounded and taken prisoner while leading a detachment with [[Simeón Cuba Sarabia]]. According to some soldiers present at the capture, as they approached Guevara during the skirmish he allegedly shouted, "Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead."<ref>Anderson, Jon Lee. Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, New York: 1997, Grove Press, p.733.</ref> 

Guevara was taken to a dilapidated schoolhouse in the nearby village of [[La Higuera]]. Early the next day, [[René Barrientos|Barrientos]] ordered that he be killed.{{cref|Barrientos}} The executioner was [[Mario Terán]], a sergeant in the Bolivian army who had drawn a short straw after arguments over who would get the honor of shooting Guevara broke out among the soldiers. To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the story the government planned to release to the public, Félix Rodríguez ordered Terán to aim carefully to make it appear that Guevara had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7027619.stm|title=CIA man recounts Che Guevara's death

Moments before Guevara was executed he was asked if he was thinking about his own immortality.

''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life''. New York: Grove Press, 1997, page 739.</ref> According to Felix Rodriquez the shots that killed Guevara rang out at about 1:10 pm. Guevara received many wounds to the legs and a fatal one to the chest but none to the face that would soon be seen around the world. His body was lashed to the landing skids of a helicopter and flown to neighboring [[Vallegrande]] where photographs were taken showing a figure described by some as "Christ-like" lying on a concrete slab in the laundry room of the Nuestra Señora de Malta hospital.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/09/MNVASLK4R.DTL&feed=rss.news Bolivia marks capture, execution of 'Che' Guevara 40 years ago, SF Chronicle, October 9 2007]</ref><ref>[[Richard Gott]], "Bolivia on the Day of the Death of Che Guevara".[http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm Online at Mindfully.org], accessed [[February 26]] [[2006]].</ref>

A declassified memorandum dated 11 October 1967 to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] from his senior adviser, [[Walt Rostow]], called the decision to kill Guevara “stupid” but “understandable from a Bolivian standpoint.”<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/26/world/americas/26che.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin Lone Bidder Buys Strands of Che’s Hair at U.S. Auction, by Marc Lacey, October 26 2007, NY Times]</ref> After the execution, Rodríguez took personal items of Guevara's including a [[Rolex]] watch, often showing them to reporters during the ensuing years.

The death of Guevara was regarded as a blow to socialist revolutionary movements in Latin America and the rest of the [[third world]].{{Fact|date=March 2008}}
[[Image:Che Guevara - Grab in Santa Clara, Kuba.jpg|thumb|215px|left|Che Guevara's Monument and Mausoleum in Santa Clara, Cuba.]]

While researching his definitive biography ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', author [[Jon Lee Anderson]] happened to discover the location of Guevara's burial. Thus in 1997, the skeletal remains of a handless body were exhumed from beneath an air strip near Vallegrande, identified as those of Guevara by a Cuban forensic team at the scene, and returned to Cuba. On [[17 October]], [[1997]], his remains, with those of six of his fellow combatants, were laid to rest with military honors in a specially built mausoleum{{cref|Mausoleum}} in the city of Santa Clara, where he had won the decisive battle of the Cuban Revolution.

Also removed when Guevara was captured was his diary, which documented events of the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, ''"Diario (Bolivia)"''. [http://www.uco.es/~i62guigm/che/diario.htm Online], accessed [[February 26]] [[2006]].</ref> The first entry is on [[November 7]] [[1966]] shortly after his arrival at the farm in Ñancahuazú, and the last entry is on [[October 7]] [[1967]], the day before his capture. The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely due to discovery by the Bolivian Army, explains Guevara's decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to re-establish contact, and describes their overall unsuccessful venture. It also records the rift between Guevara and the Bolivian Communist Party that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally anticipated and shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace, due in part to the fact that the guerrilla group had learned [[Quechua]] unaware that the local language which was actually [[Tupí-Guaraní]]. As the campaign drew to an unexpected close, Guevara became increasingly ill. He suffered from ever-worsening bouts of asthma, and most of his last offensives were carried out in an attempt to obtain medicine.

The Bolivian Diary was quickly and crudely translated by ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine and circulated around the world. There are at least four additional diaries in existence&mdash;those of Israel Reyes Zayas (Alias "Braulio"), Harry Villegas Tamayo ("Pombo"), Eliseo Reyes Rodriguez ("Rolando")<ref>Major Donald R. Selvage - USMC, "Che Guevara in Bolivia", [[1 April]] [[1985]].

==Legacy==
