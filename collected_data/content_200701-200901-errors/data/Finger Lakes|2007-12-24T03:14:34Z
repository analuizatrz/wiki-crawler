The '''Finger Lakes''', a major tourist destination in the west-central section of [[Upstate New York]], are actually eleven in number, but only seven of the largest are commonly identified as such.  The lakes mainly are linear in shape, each lake oriented on a north-south axis.  The longest, [[Cayuga Lake]] and [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]], are among the deepest in America. Both are close to 40 miles (64 km) from end to end, but never more than 3.5 miles (5,600 m) wide.  Cayuga is actually the longest (38.1 miles (61.3 km)), but Seneca the largest in total area.  Seneca is the deepest (618 feet, 188.4 m), followed by Cayuga (435 feet, 132.6 m), with the bottoms well below sea level.  These largest lakes resemble the others in shape, which collectively reminded early map-makers of the fingers of a hand.

[[Image:LakeFromBoat680N.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Skaneateles Lake, looking south from a modern tour boat. Steamboat excursions began there in 1816, probably the first Finger Lakes recreational offering to visitors.]]

[[Cazenovia Lake]] to the east, although smaller, is sometimes called "the eighth Finger Lake," because it is similar in shape, located in Appalachian hill terrain, with a historic village linked to other Finger Lakes by [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US 20]]. It may have been formed in the same manner as the Finger Lakes, as satellite photos show three valleys similar in character and spacing to the Finger Lakes east of Otisco Lake. The first is the [[Tully, New York|Tully]] Valley, which includes a chain of small lakes at the south end that could be a "Finger Lake" that never formed because of a terminal [[moraine]]. The moraine caused the [[Tioughnioga River]] to flow south instead of north, the opposite of the other waters of the Finger Lakes. The next two valleys to the east contain Butternut Creek, which flows north, and the East Branch of the Tioughnioga River, which flows south. The next valley contains Limestone Creek, which flows north. The next valley after that contains '''Cazenovia Lake'''.

[[Oneida Lake]], to the northeast of [[Syracuse, New York]], is sometimes included as the "thumb," although it is shallow and somewhat different in character from the rest. [[Onondaga Lake]], though located just north of the Finger Lakes region, is not considered one of the Finger Lakes.  '''Conesus''', '''Hemlock''', '''Canadice''', '''Honeoye''',  and '''Otisco''' are considered the minor Finger Lakes.  Other, smaller lakes, including Silver, [[Waneta Lake|Waneta]], and [[Lamoka Lake|Lamoka]] lakes, dot this region. However, Waneta and Lamoka lakes are part of the [[Susquehanna River]] watershed as they drain into a tributary of the [[Chemung River]]. 

East of Oneida and Cazenovia Lakes are the [[headwaters]] of the [[Susquehanna River]] and [[Hudson River]] watersheds (the latter through the [[Mohawk Valley]]).

== Region ==
The Finger Lakes were modified by [[glaciers]], but were not simply gouged out by glacial action, as often asserted.  The present lakes were preglacial stream valleys or earlier lakes.  Glaciers modified the terrain somewhat, but more critically:  when the ice retreated, deposits left behind dammed the valleys, impounding water.  The deep valley south of Syracuse, seen from [[Interstate 81 in New York|Interstate 81]], might have been another Finger Lake, had the glacier's [[recessional moraine]] been deposited farther north rather than at [[Tully, New York]].

The Finger Lakes are situated on the northern edge of the Appalachian Upland. They now drain northward to [[Lake Ontario]]. The southern ends of the lakes are characterized by steeper hills etched by streams running toward the lakes below.  Glacial ''[[hanging valley]]s'', terraces in the descent toward the lakes, often end with [[waterfall]]s. [[Taughannock Falls]], with a drop of {{Convert|214|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, is one of the highest waterfalls east of the Rocky Mountains. [[Taughannock Falls State Park]], [[Fillmore Glen State Park|Fillmore Glen]], Treman State Park, and [[Watkins Glen State Park|Watkins Glen]] are especially scenic examples of glens and waterfalls that have been incorporated into public parks. The glens of this region are unique worldwide.  They are the narrow, rocky valleys carved by rainfall's relatively quick (10,000 years) erosion of the loose shale and siltstone of this plateau of nearly level sedimentary rock. The eroded sediment ends up, e.g., along or in Cayuga Lake (Taughannock and Treman) and Seneca Lake (Watkins Glen). 

Most of the area was originally forested with [[oak]], hickory, [[maple]], [[chestnut]], [[ash tree|ash]], [[Tsuga|hemlock]], and [[beech]] trees, but the [[Iroquois]] maintained, by annual burning, the land between Cayuga and Seneca Lakes as [[prairie]], with herds of [[American Bison|bison]]{{Fact|date=October 2007}}, normally thought of as a western animal. Today the Finger Lakes area is still known for [[fishing]] and [[hunting]]. Winter sports are also popular, with [[skiing]], [[snowmobile|snowmobling]] and [[ice fishing]] available.

The Finger Lakes region is an important agricultural sector of New York. The rolling land between the lakes is occupied notably by vineyards (discussed below) but more commonly with other farms, mostly [[dairy]] operations, a number owned by [[Amish]] and [[Mennonite]] families in the twentieth centuries.  Many Quakers settled in the nineteenth century. Farms raise [[maize|corn]], [[hay]], [[wheat]], [[oat]]s, [[barley]], and [[soybean]]s. [[Cabbage]]s, [[sweetcorn]], and [[potato]]es are major vegetable crops. [[Maple syrup]] and [[honey]] are also local products. Cornell University (below) maintains the [[New York State Agricultural Experiment Station]] and horticultural [[seedbank|gene bank]] at [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]] on the north end of Seneca Lake.

Finger Lakes cities and larger villages are situated at the head and foot of most major lakes:  [[Skaneateles (village), New York|Skaneateles]], [[Auburn, New York|Auburn]], [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]], [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins Glen]], [[Penn Yan, New York|Penn Yan]], [[Hammondsport, New York|Hammondsport]] and [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]].  These historic communities with scenic situations all are tourist destinations, as is the village of [[Aurora, Cayuga County, New York|Aurora]], which is situated on the east shore of Cayuga Lake, and [[Naples (village), New York|Naples]], located about five miles south of Canandaigua Lake.   Although not on one of the lakes, the nearby city of [[Corning (city), New York|Corning]] is also a major destination for visitors, because of its famous glass museum and demonstrations.  Similarly, the villages of [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]] and [[Waterloo (village), New York|Waterloo]], although not on lakes, attract many to the several sites of the [[Women's Rights National Historical Park]] and the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]]. Likewise not on a lake but attracting many visitors is the [[Genesee Country Village and Museum]] at [[Mumford, New York|Mumford]].  Similarly, [[Letchworth State Park]], with its famous gorge and waterfalls, draws visitors to the western end of the Finger Lakes region.  The [[Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge]] at the foot of Cayuga Lake is also a major feature of the region, as is the [[Sonnenberg Gardens and Mansion State Historic Park]] at Canandaigua.

Tourism has become a major growth industry of the Finger Lakes Region.  According to the New York State Department of Economic Development, taxable sales derived from tourism in one county alone exceeded ninety million dollars in a recent year (2001).  Visitors spent an estimated 200 million dollars in the central Finger Lakes region, where the industry employed about fifteen thousand people.

Water quality becomes an increasing concern as population expands, with waterfront property increasingly in demand.  [[Skaneateles Lake]] is the purest of the Finger Lakes, in large part because of controls imposed by the City of Syracuse, which in 2006 spent 2.3 million dollars to protect its water supply.  Skaneateles Lake is deep and also has a relatively small watershed compared to other Finger Lakes.  Smaller and shallower [[Owasco Lake]], to the west, has a watershed nearly four times larger, while receiving discharge from two municipal sewage plants, but with far less pollution control.

== Wine ==
[[Image:CanandaguaLakeVinyard680.JPG|right|thumbnail|300px| Vineyard overlooking  [[Canandaigua Lake]], from Route 21]]
The Finger Lakes area is New York's largest [[wine]] producing region, and the second largest in the United States behind the [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]] in [[California]].{{Fact|date=September 2007}}  Numerous [[wineries]] and [[vineyards]] are centered around Seneca, Cayuga, Canandaigua, and Keuka Lakes.  Because of the lakes' great depth, they provide a [[lake effect]] to the lush vineyards that flank their shores.  Retaining residual summer warmth in the winter, and winter's cold in the spring, the grapes are protected from disastrous spring frost during grape formation, and early frost before the harvest.  With the passage of the Farm Winery Act in 1978, countless numbers of wineries have opened their doors to visitors from all over the world.  Wineries are a major growth industry of the region, not merely contributing to the economy through production, but increasingly because they attract large numbers of visitors who support other components of tourism.

== History ==
The Finger Lakes region is a central part of the [[Iroquois]] homeland. The Iroquois tribes include the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] tribes, for which the two largest Finger Lakes are named. The [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] tribe lived in the Finger Lakes region as well. The [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] and [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] tribes lived at the eastern edge of the region, closer to their namesake lakes, [[Lake Oneida]] and [[Onondaga Lake]]. The sixth Iroquois tribe, the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], lived farther east. During colonial times, many other tribes moved to the Finger Lakes region, seeking the protection of the Iroquois. For example, remnants of several tribes of North Carolina, collectively called the [[Tutelo]], moved to the town of Coreorgonel at the south end of Cayuga Lake near present-day Ithaca. Major Iroquois towns in the Finger Lakes region included the Seneca town of [[Geneseo (town), New York|Gen-nis-he-yo]] (present-day Geneseo), [[Kanadaseaga]] (Seneca Castle, near present-day Geneva), [[Goiogouen]] (Cayuga Castle, east of Cayuga Lake), [[Chonodote]] (Cayuga town, present-day Aurora), and [[Catherine's Town (Seneca town)|Catherine's Town]] (near present-day Watkins Glen).

As one of the most powerful Indian nations during colonial times, the Iroquois were able to prevent European colonization of the Finger Lakes region for nearly two centuries after first contact. By the late 18th century Iroquois power had weakened, relative to the European-Americans, and internal strife eroded the political unity of the Iroquois League. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] some of the Iroquois sided with the British and some with the Americans, resulting in civil war among the Iroquois. In the late 1770s, British-allied Iroquois attacks various American frontier settlements, prompting counter-attacks, culminating in the [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779, which destroyed most of the Iroquois towns and effectively broke Iroquois power.

After the Revolutionary War, the Iroquois and other Indians of the region were assigned reservations. Most of their land, including the Finger Lakes region, was opened up to purchase and settlement.

Roughly the western half of the Finger Lakes region comprised the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]] of 1790. The region was rapidly settled at the turn of the nineteenth century, largely by a westward migration from New England, but to a lesser degree by northward influx from Pennsylvania.  The regional architecture reflects these area traditions of the Federal and Greek Revival periods.

The Finger Lakes region, together with the [[Genesee Country]] of Western New York, has been referred to as the [[Burned-Over District]], where, in the [[19th century]], the [[Second Great Awakening]] was a revival of [[Christianity]], and some new [[religion]]s were also formed.  The region was active in reform and utopian movements.  Many [[Underground Railroad]] sites have been documented.  The [[Harriet Tubman]] Home at Auburn recalls the life and work of the African-American  "Moses of her people."

On the northern end of the Finger Lakes is also [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], the birthplace of the [[Women's suffrage]] movement, [[Waterloo (village), New York|Waterloo]], the birthplace of [[Memorial Day]], and [[Palmyra (village), New York|Palmyra]], the birthplace of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], also known as the [[Mormon]] Church.  An annual outdoor drama, The ''Hill Cumorah Pageant'', produced by the Mormons draws thousands of visitors each year.

[[Hammondsport, New York|Hammondsport]] was the home of aviation pioneer [[Glenn Curtiss]], and the favorable air currents make the area a popular spot for [[glider]] pilots. [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]], just to the south, was the home of [[Mark Twain]] in his later life, and the site of an infamous Civil War prison. [[Corning (city), New York|Corning]] is most noted as the home of [[Corning Glass Works]]. [[Hornell, New York|Hornell]], just southwest of the Finger Lakes was a major [[railroad]] center. [[Locomotive]]s were repaired there until recently.

[[Image:GrangerHomestead.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|right|Granger Homestead, 1816, [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]]]]

Notable among the historic buildings of the region (most linked below) is the [[Granger Homestead]] (1816), a large village house in Federal Style at Canandaigua, New York.  Another example of the Federal Style is the Prouty-Chew House (1829) at Geneva, portions of which were altered at various times in new fashions. Three Greek Revival mansions are situated near three lakes:  The Richard DeZeng House, Skaneateles (1839), Rose Hill, Geneva (1839), and Esperanza, Penn Yan (1838).  The latter two are open to the public.  The Seward House in Auburn, a National Historic Landmark, is a mansion more characteristic of the Civil War era, virtually unchanged from the nineteenth century.  [[Belhurst Castle]], Geneva, a stone mansion in the Romanesque Revival style, now serves as an inn.  [[Sonnenberg Gardens and Mansion State Historic Park|Sonnenberg]] mansion at Canandaigua is later nineteenth-century residence in the Queen Anne style, known for its restored period gardens.  Geneva on the Lake is a villa (1910-14) that recalls those on Italian lakes.  Now an inn, it has exceptional gardens in the European manner. Many buildings and historic districts of the Finger Lakes region are notable, other than these historic houses.

== Educational institutions ==
[[Image:WellsCollegeTower600R.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px| [[Wells College]], [[Aurora, Cayuga County, New York|Aurora]]]]
The area is also known for education, with the largest institution being [[Cornell University]] in Ithaca, the state [[land-grant university|land grant institution]]. Its [[alma mater]] begins "[[Far Above Cayuga's Waters]]", because it is on the hills overlooking the city of [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] and the southern end of Cayuga Lake. There are also the State Universities of New York at [[State University of New York at Geneseo|Geneseo]] and [[State University of New York at Cortland|Cortland]], [[Ithaca College]] in Ithaca, [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]] in Geneva, [[Wells College]] in [[Aurora, New York|Aurora]], also on Cayuga Lake, [[Keuka College]], [[New York Chiropractic College]] in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], and several [[community college]]s.
