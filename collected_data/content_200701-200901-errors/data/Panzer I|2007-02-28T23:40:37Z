The '''Panzerkampfwagen I''', or Sonderkraftfahrzeugh (SdKfz) 191, abbreviated PzKpfw I and more commonly referred to as the [[Panzer]] I, was a [[light tank]] produced by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in the 1930s.<ref>Nomenclature ''see:'' Gander, ''Tanks and Armour: PanzerKampfwagen I & II,'' p.10</ref>  Intended as a training tank to introduce the concept of armored warfare into the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] it was first began production in 1934.  Despite the original purpose of the vehicle the Panzer I saw combat in [[Spain]], during the [[Spanish Civil War]], and during the [[Second World War]].  By 1941, however, old Panzer I chassis were being reused for production of tank surrogates based on the Panzer I.  Furthermore, there would be various attempts to upgrade the Panzer I throughout its history and would continue to serve in the armed forces of Spain until 1954.<ref>Franco, ''La Brunete: Primera Parte'', p. 31</ref>

== Development History ==
The 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] formally disallowed Germany to design, manufacture and deploy tanks within the [[Reichswehr]], the post [[First World War]] German army.  According to paragraph twenty-four of the treaty a 100,000 [[German mark|marks]] fee and up an imprisonment of up to six months would be imposed on anybody who "[manufactured] armoured vehicles, tanks or similar machines, which may be turned to military use."<ref>Guderian, ''Achtung-Panzer!'', p. 133</ref>  Despite the limitations imposed upon Germany by the Treaty of Versailles, several officers of the Reichswehr were able to establish a clandestine General Staff dedicated to the study of the First World War with the purpose of the development of future strategies and tactics.  Although at-first the concept of the tank as a mobile weapon of war was met by apathy German industry was silently encouraged to look into tank-design, while quiet cooperation was undertaken with the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Gander, ''Tanks & Armour: PanzerKampfwagen I & II'', p. 6-7</ref>  There was also minor military cooperation with [[Sweden]], including the extraction of technical data which proved invaluable to early German tank design.<ref>Perett, ''German Light Panzers: 1932-42'', p.4</ref>  As early as 1926 various German companies, including [[Rheinmetall] and [[Daimler-Benz]], produced a single prototype denominated under ''Grosstraktor'', in an attempt to veil the true intents of the vehicle, armed with a large 75&nbsp;mm [[cannon]].<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I: El Inicio de una Saga'', p.3</ref>  Only two years later prototypes of the new ''Leichtertraktor'', or light-tractor, were produced by German companies, armed with 37&nbsp;mm KwK L/45 [[tank gun|guns]].<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I: El Inicio de una Sage'', p.3; Gander, ''Tanks & Armour: PanzerKampfwagen I & II'', p. 7</ref>  The ''Grosstraktor'' was later put into service with the 1st Panzer Division, although not for a considerable amount of time, and the ''Leichtertraktor'' remained experimental vehicles until 1935.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I: El Inicio de una Saga,'' p. 3</ref>  In the late 1920s and early 1930s German tank theory was pioneered by two figures: General Lutz and his chief-of-staff Lieutenant Colonel [[Heinz Guderian]].  Guderian became the most influential of the two-men and his ideas were widely publisized.<ref>''See:'' ''Achtung-Panzer!'', first released in 1937 in German.</ref>  

Guderian envisioned an armor corps composed of several types of tanks.  This included a slow [[infantry tank]], armed with a small-caliber cannon and several machine guns.  An infantry tank, according to Guderian, was also to be heavily armored to defend against enemy anti-tank guns and [[artillery]].  Furthermore, he also envisioned a fast breakthrough tank which was armored against enemy anti-tank weapons and had a large 75&nbsp;mm cannon.  Finally, Germany would need a heavy tank to defeat enemy fortifications, armed with a 150&nbsp;mm cannon and relatively stronger armor.  Such a tank also required a weight of between 70 and 100&nbsp;tonnes.<ref>Guderian, ''Achtung-Panzer!'', pp. 169-170 for a detailed look into Guderian's theories.</ref>  Hitler, soon after rising to power in Germany, found interest in Guderian's opinions and approved the creation of Germany's first panzer divisions.  Guderian suggested the design of a main combat vehicle, which was manifested later as the [[Panzer III]], and a breakthrough tank, later the [[Panzer IV]].<ref>Gander, ''Tanks & Armour: PanzerKampfwagen I & II'', p. 9</ref>  These were not available in 1933 and no existing tank design appealed to Guderian.  Nevertheless, a preliminary vehicle was ordered by the German Army for the intent of training German tank crews - this became the Panzer I.<ref>McCarthy, ''Panzerkrieg'', p. 31</ref>  

The beginning of the Panzer I's design history can be traced back to 1932 with the beginning of the ''Landswirtschaftlicher Schlepper'' [[armored fighting vehicle]], abbreviated La S.  The La S was intended not just to train Germany's panzer troops, but to prepare Germany's industry for the mass production of tanks in the near future.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', p. 4</ref>  In 1933 Krupp revealed a prototype of the ''Landswerk Krupp A'', or LKA, with a sloped front plane, a large central casemate and heavily influenced by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Vickers]] Carden-Lloyd design.  The tank was armed with two [[MG-13]] Dreyse machine guns.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer II'', p.4-5</ref>  A mass produced version of the LKA was consequently designed between Daimler-Benz, Henschel, Krupp, MAN and Rheinmetall, exchaning the casemate with a rotating turret, and was accepted into service after testing in 1934.<ref>Perett, ''German Light Panzers'', p. 4</ref>  Although these tanks were referred to as the La S and LKA well beyond the beginning of initial production, nomenclature would change in 1938 to its official designation - PanzerKampfwagen I Ausf. A.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', p. 5-6</ref>  The first fifteen versions were produced between February and March 1934 and did not include the rotating turret; they were used specifically for crew training.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', p.6</ref>  Following the production of these first fiteen tanks, production was switched to the combat version of the tank.  The Panzer I Ausf. (variant) A was underarmored, with only 13&nbsp;mm of steel protection at its thickest points.  Furthermore, several faults were found in the design, including suspension problems - which forced the vehicle to pitch at high velocities - and engine problems - overheating.<ref>Gander, ''Tanks & Armour: PanzerKampfwagen I & II'', p. 10</ref>  The driver was positioned inside the chassis, using steering levels to control the tank, while the commander was positioned in the turret where he also acted as the dedicated gunner.  The two crew members could communicate by means of a voice tube.<ref>Perrett, ''German Light Panzers'', p.5-6</ref>  Machine gun ammunition was stowed in five individual bins, containing several clips of twenty-five rounds.<ref>Specifically, there was an eight clip bin in the turret, and four bins in the hull containing 8, 20, 6 and 19 clips, respectively.  For more information ''see:'' Perrett, ''German Light Panzers'', p. 6</ref>  Lucas Molina Franco, a Spanish author, suggests that 833 Ausf. A models were fabricated in total<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', p. 10</ref>, while Bryan Perrett offers the number of 300<ref>Perrett, ''German Light Panzers'', p. 6</ref> and Terry Gander 818<ref>Gander, ''Tanks & Armour: PanzerKampfwagen I & II'', p. 11</ref>.

Many of the problems found in the Panzer I Ausf. A were later corrected with the introduction of the Ausf. B version of the vehicle.  The engine was replaced by the water-cooled, six-cylinder, 100&nbsp;hp Maybach NL 38 TR and the [[gearbox]] was exchanged with by a newer, more reliable model.  The larger engine required the extension of the vehicle's chassis by no less than 40&nbsp;cm, and this allowed the improvement of the tank's suspension system by means of adding a new bogie wheel and raising the tensioner.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', pp. 21-21; tensioner refers to the idler wheel.</ref>  The tank's weight increased by .4&nbsp;tonnes, although protection was not increased.  Production of the Panzer I Ausf. B began August 1935 and finished in early 1937 - Franco writes that 840 were constructed<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', p. 22</ref>, while Perrett offers a total number of 1,500<ref>Perrett, ''German Light Panzers'', p. 6</ref> and Gander a total of 675<ref>Gander, ''Tanks & Armour: PanzerKampfwagen I & II'', p. 11</ref>.  However, Lucas Molina Franco mentions that only 675 of the 840 built were combat versions.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', p. 34</ref>

=== Sister tanks ===
Two more combat versions of the Panzer I were designed and produced between 1939 and 1942.  However, these tanks had nothing in common with either the Panzer I Ausf. A or the Ausf. B, except in name.<ref>Gander, ''Tanks & Armour: PanzerKampfwagen I & II'', p. 14</ref>  One of the these, the Panzer I Ausf. C, was designed jointly between [[Krauss-Maffei]] and Daimler-Benz in 1939 for the purpose of having an amply armored and armed reconnaisance light tank.<ref>Perrett, ''German Light Panzers'', p. 6</ref>  The Ausf. C boasted a completely new chassis and turret, a modern torsion-bar suspension and five interleaved roadwheels.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', pp. 37-38</ref>  This new tank also had a maximum thickness of 30&nbsp;mm of steel plating, which was over twice as thick as either the Ausf. A or Ausf. B, and was armed with a 7.92&nbsp;mm EW 141 machine gun.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', p. 6  Both Franco and Perrett mention that the EW 141 cannon was 20mm, although Gander mentions a caliber of 7.92&nbsp;mm.  No published image of the Ausf. C in any of these books showcases a 20&nbsp;mm gun, however.  There is a [http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=59317|topic] regarding the EW 141 on Axis History Forum.</ref>  Forty of these tanks were produced<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', p. 37</ref>, along with six prototypes<ref>Gander, ''Tanks & Armour: PanzerKampfwagen I & II'', p.  14</ref>.  Two tanks saw deployment to 1st Panzer Division in 1943, and the other thirty-eight were deployed to the LVIII Panzer Reserve Corps during the [[Battle of Normandy|Normandy landings]] in 1944.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', p. 38</ref>

The second vehicle, the Ausf. F, was as different from the Ausf. B as it was from the Ausf. C.<ref>Gander, ''Tanks & Armour: PanzerKampfwagen I & II'', pp. 14-15</ref>  Intended as an infantry support tank, the Panzer I Ausf. F fielded a maximum thickness of 80&nbsp;mm and weighed between 18 and 21&nbsp;tonnes.<ref>Perrett, ''German Light Panzers'', pp. 6-7.  Perrett claims a weight of 18&nbsp;tonnes, although Franco claims 21.</ref>  Thirty of these tanks were produced in 1940, although a second order of 100 vehicles was later canceled.  In order to make-up for the increased weight a new 150&nbsp;hp Maybach HL45 ''Otto'' engine was used, allowing a maximum road-speed of 25&nbsp;km/h.  Eight of thirty produced tanks were send to the 1st Panzer Division in 1943 and saw combat at the [[Battle of Kursk]].  The res were given to several army schools for training and evaluation purposes.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', pp. 38-39</ref>  The Ausf. F tank was armed with two 7.92&nbsp;mm [[MG-34]]s.<ref>Gander, ''Tanks & Armour: PanzerKampfwagen I & II'', p. 14; although this is similar to the armament of earlier Ausf. A and Ausf. B tanks, these two were armed with [[MG-13]]s, not the modern [[MG-34]]</ref>

==Spanish Civil War==
On [[18 July]], [[1936]], war broke out on the [[Iberian peninsula]] as Spain disolved into a state of [[Spanish civil war|civil war]].  After the initial uprising two sides began to consolidate themselves and form - the [[Popular front]] and the [[Spain under Franco|Spanish Nationalist]].  Both sides almost immediately received support from various countries around the world, especially from the [[Soviet Union]] and Germany.<ref>Candil, ''Soviet Armor in Spain: Aid Mission to Republicans Tested Doctrine and Equipment''.</ref>  The first shipment of foreign tanks arrived on 15 October and consisted of fifty [[T-26]] light tanks from the Soviet Union.<ref>Candil, ''Soviet Armor in Spain'', p. 32; for reference, Wikipedia's [[T-26]] article includes a table of every shipment of T-26Bs to Spain throughout the entirety of the war.</ref>  The shipment was under the surveillance of the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] and Germany immediately responded by sending forty-one Panzer Is to Spain a few days after.<ref>38 Panzer I Ausf. A and 3 Panzerbefehlswagen I Ausf. B command vehicles.  García, ''Las Armas de la Guerra Civil Española'', p. 308</ref>  This first shipment was followed by four more shipments of Panzer I Ausf. B tanks<ref>Perrett, ''German Light Panzers'', p. 46</ref>  , coming to the total of 122 vehicles.<ref>García, ''Las Armas de la Guerra Civil Española'', p. 311; Perrett offers the total number of 180, but then contradicts himself by later stating that only 100 vehicles were sent.  122 is the correct number, as referenced in ''Las Armas de la Guerra Civil Española''.</ref>

The first shipment of tanks were immediately consolidated under the command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Wilhelm Josef Ritter von Thoma|Ritter von Thoma]] in ''Gruppe Thoma'', also referred to as ''Panzergruppe Drohne''.  ''Gruppe Thoma'' formed part of ''Gruppe Imker'' which referred to the ground formations of the German [[Condor Legion]].</ref>Ramos, ''Le Legión Cóndor en la Guerra Civil'', p. 96</ref>  Between July and October a rapid Nationalist advance from Sevilla to Toledo placed them in position to take [[Madrid]], the capital of Spain.<ref>Beevor, ''The Spanish Civil War'', pp. 97-104</ref>  The rapid nationalist advance and the fall of the town of Illescas to Nationalist armies on [[18 October]], [[1936]], caused the government of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] to flee to [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia]], including President [[Manuel Azaña]].<ref>Moa, ''Los Mitos de la Guerra Civil'', p. 323.</ref>  In an attempt to stem the tide and gain Madrid's defenses crucial time Soviet armor was deployed south of Madrid under the command of Colonel Krivoshein, before the end of October.<ref>Candil, ''Soviet Armor in Spain'', p. 32</ref>  Upon their arrival several T-26 tanks, under the command of Captain Paul Arman, were thrown into a counterattack directed towards the town of Torrejon de Velasco in an attempt to cut off the Nationalist's line of advance north - this was the first tank battle in the Spanish Civil War.  Despite initial success poor communication between Republican armor and infantry caused the isolation of Captain Arman's tanks and the subsequent destruction of a number of tanks.  This battle also marked the first use of the [[molotov cocktail]] against tanks.<ref>Daley, ''Soviet and German Advisors Put Doctrine to the Test'', pp. 33-34</ref>  Ritter von Thoma's Panzer Is found use only days later, on  30 October, and immediately experienced problems.  As the Nationalist armor advanced it was engaged by the ''Commune de Paris'' battalion, armed with Soviet [[BA-10]] armored cars.  It was found that the 37mm anti-tank gun used by the BA-10 was more than sufficient to knock-out the poorly armored German Panzer I at ranges of over 500&nbsp;m.<ref>Daley, ''Soviet and German Advisors Put Doctrine to the Test'', p. 35</ref>  Although initially the German Panzer I was able to knock-out Soviet T-26 tanks at ranges of up to 150&nbsp;m using a special armor piercing 7.92mm bullet, Republican tanks began to engage at longer distances using their superior 45&nbsp;mm tank gun.<ref>Candil, ''Soviet Armor in Spain'', p. 36</ref>  

Although the Panzer I would partake in almost every major Nationalist offensive of the war, the Nationalist army began to deploy more and more captured T-26 tanks to offset the disadvantage in the quality of armor.<ref>García, ''Las Armas de la Guerra Civil Española'', pp. 327-328</ref>  At one point Ritter von Thoma offered up to 500 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] per T-26 captured.<ref>McCarthy, ''Panzerkrieg'', p. 34</ref>  There was an attempted upgrade of the Panzer I in order to increase the tank's lethality.  On [[8 August]], [[1937]], Major General García Pallasar received a note from Generalísimo [[Francisco Franco]] which expressed the need for a Panzer I, or ''negrillo'' as known by their Spanish crews, armed with a 20&nbsp;mm gun.  Ultimately, the piece chosen was the 20&nbsp;mm Breda mod. 1935 due to the simplicity of the design over competitors such as the German [[Flak 38|Flak 30]].  Furthermore, the 20&nbsp;mm Breda was capable of perforating 40&nbsp;mm of steel at 250&nbsp;m, which was more than required to penetrate the front armor of rival T-26 tanks.  Although originally forty Italian [[L3/35|CV.35]] light tanks were ordered with the original armament exchanged for the 20&nbsp;mm Breda mod. 1935 this order was subsequently canceled after it was thought that the adaptation of the same gun to the Panzer I would yield better results.  Prototypes were ready by September 1937 and an order was placed after successful results.  The mounting of the Breda machine gun onto the Panzer I required the original turret to be opened at the top and then extended by a verticle supplement.  Moreover, the diameter of the front plate of the turret had to be widened.  Four of these tanks were finished at the Armament Factory of [[Sevilla]], but further production was canceled as it was decided that sufficient numbers of Republican T-26 tanks had been captured in order to fulfill the Nationalist's leadership's request for more potent lethality on their tanks.  This modification of the Panzer I was not particularly liked by German crews, as the unprotected gap in the turret, designed to allow the tank's commander to aim was found to be a dangerous weakpoint.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', pp. 47-49</ref>  

In late 1938 another Panzer I was sent to the Armament Factory of Sevilla in order to adapt a 45&nbsp;mmm tank-gun, captured from either a Soviet T-26 or [[BT-5]].  A second Panzer was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37&nbsp;mm Maklen anti-tank gun, which had been deployed to [[Asturias]] in late 1936 on the Soviet ship ''A. Andreiev''.  It remains unknown to what extent these trials and adaptations were completed, although it is safe to assume that neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board.<ref>Franco, ''Panzer I'', p. 50</ref>

== Second World War ==
[[image:PanzerIAWes.PNG|right|thumb|305px|Panzer I Ausf. A, 4th Panzer Division, during the campaign in the West. (US National Archives)]]

During the initial campaigns of the Second World War Germany's light tanks, including the Panzer I, formed the bulk of its armor.<ref>McCarthy, ''Panzerkrieg'', p. 51</ref>  In March 1938 the German Army [[Anschluss|marched into Austria]], experiencing a breakdown rate of up to thirty percent.<ref>Perrett, ''German Light Panzers'', pp. 35-37</ref>  However, the experiences of the occupation of Austria allowed Guderian to realize several faults within the German armor corps and subsequently allowed him to improve the maintenance and fuel supply situation.<ref>McCarthy, ''Panzerkrieg'', p. 42</ref>  In October 1938 German tanks occupied [[Czechoslovakia]]'s [[Sudetenland]], and then occupied the remainder of the country in March 1939.  The capture of Czechoslovakia allowed several Czech tank designs, such as the [[Panzer 38(t)]], to be incoporated into the German Army.  It also prepared German forces for the eventual invasion of [[Poland]].<ref>McCarthy, ''Panzerkrieg'', pp.42-43</ref>

=== Polish Campaign ===
On [[1 September]], [[1939]], Germany [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland]] using forty-two divisions, including six panzer divisions.<ref>McCarthy, ''Panzerkrieg'', p. 51</ref>  The battalion strength of the 1st Panzer Division contained no less than fourteen Panzer I tanks, while the other five divisions included thirty-four Panzer Is.<ref>Perrett, ''German Light Panzers'', pp. 37</ref>  A total of about 2,600 tanks were available for the invasion of Poland, but only 310 [[Panzer III]]s and [[Panzer IV]]s were available.  Furthermore, 350 of these tanks were of Czech design - the rest were either Panzer Is or [[Panzer II]]s.<ref>McCarthy, ''Panzerkrieg'', p. 50-51</ref>  The invasion was swift.  Between the 1st and 5th of September Heinz Guderian, in command of the XIX Panzerkorps, was able to pierce the Polish Pomorze Army and achieve a breakthrough at the battle of Tuchel Heath.<ref>Guderian, ''Panzer Leader'', pp. 68-73</ref>  There was similar success in the south, and by 9 September the German eighth, tenth and fourteenth armies were able to enclose a large portion of the Polish army in the Radom pocket, which was finally destroyed on 12 September.  By 20 September remaining Polish forces had been destroyed at the Battle of Bzura, and the road to [[Warsaw]] was opened.<ref>Manstein, ''Lost Victories'', pp. 53-57</ref>

== Variants ==
{{main | Panzer I variants}}

Between 1934 and the mid-1940s several variants of the Panzer I were designed.  The majority of variants, especially tank surrogates, were designed during the later years of the Panzer I's combat history in an attempt to reuse aging chassis.  Being an obsolete design, even early in its history, and incapable of defeating foreign armor such as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[T-26]] [[tank|light tank]], and outclassed by newer German tanks, including the [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer II]], Panzer I chassis were used increasingly often to mount larger guns in order to provide the German Army with [[Tank destroyer|tank destroyers]], [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft vehicles]] and other surrogates.<ref>Gander, ''Tanks & Armour: PanzerKampfwagen I & II'', p. 62</ref>
