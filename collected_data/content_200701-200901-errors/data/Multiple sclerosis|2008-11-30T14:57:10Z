'''Multiple sclerosis''' (abbreviated MS, also known as ''disseminated sclerosis'' or ''encephalomyelitis disseminata'') is an [[autoimmune disease|autoimmune condition]] in which the immune system attacks the [[central nervous system]], leading to [[demyelinating disease|demyelination]].<ref name="pmid11955556"/> Disease onset usually occurs in young adults, and it is more common in women.<ref name="pmid18637953"/> It has a [[prevalence]] that ranges between 2 and 150 per 100,000.<ref name="pmid11603614">{{cite journal

}}</ref> MS was first described in 1868 by [[Jean-Martin Charcot]].<ref name="Charcot1"/>  

MS affects the ability of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to communicate with each other.  Nerve cells communicate by sending electrical signals called [[action potential]]s down long fibers called [[axon]]s, which are wrapped in an insulating substance called [[myelin]].  In MS, the body's own immune system attacks and damages the myelin.  When myelin is lost, the axons can no longer effectively conduct signals.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> The name ''multiple sclerosis'' refers to scars (scleroses – better known as plaques or lesions) in the [[white matter]] of the brain and spinal cord, which is mainly composed of myelin.<ref name="Charcot1"/> Although much is known about the mechanisms involved in the disease process, the cause remains unknown. Theories include [[genetics]] or [[infection]]s. Different environmental [[risk factor]]s have also been found.<ref name="pmid17444504"/><ref name="pmid11955556"/>

Almost any neurological [[symptom]] can appear with the disease, and often progresses to [[physical]] and [[cognitive]] [[disability]].<ref name="pmid11955556"/> MS takes several forms, with new symptoms occurring either in discrete attacks (relapsing forms) or slowly accumulating over time (progressive forms).<ref name="pmid8780061"/> Between attacks, symptoms may go away completely, but permanent neurological problems often occur, especially as the disease advances.<ref name="pmid8780061"/> 

There is no known cure for MS. Treatments attempt to return function after an attack, prevent new attacks, and prevent disability.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> MS medications can have adverse effects or be poorly tolerated, and many patients pursue alternative treatments, despite the lack of supporting scientific study. The [[prognosis]] is difficult to predict; it depends on the subtype of the disease, the individual patient's disease characteristics, the initial symptoms and the degree of disability the person experiences as time advances.<ref name="pmid8017890"/> [[Life expectancy]] of patients is nearly the same as that of the unaffected population.<ref name="pmid8017890"/>

{{Main|Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms}}
[[Image:Optokinetic nystagmus.gif|thumb|right|[[Nystagmus]], characterised by involuntary eye movements, is one of many symptoms that can appear with MS]]

Symptoms of MS usually appear in episodic acute periods of worsening ([[relapse]]s, exacerbations, bouts or attacks), in a gradually-progressive deterioration of neurologic function, or in a combination of both.<ref name="pmid8780061">{{cite journal

==Disease subtypes==
[[Image:Types of MS-2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|300px|Progression of MS subtypes]]

Several subtypes, or patterns of progression, have been described. Subtypes use the past course of the disease in an attempt to [[predict]] the future course. They are important not only for prognosis but also for therapeutic decisions. In 1996 the United States [[National Multiple Sclerosis Society]] standardized four subtype definitions:  ''relapsing remitting'', ''secondary progressive'', ''primary progressive'' and ''progressive relapsing''.<ref name="pmid8780061"/>

The relapsing-remitting subtype is characterized by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet ([[remission (medicine)|remission]]) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits suffered during attacks may either resolve or leave [[sequelae]]. This describes the initial course of 85–90% of individuals with MS.<ref name="pmid8780061"/> When deficits always resolve between attacks, this is sometimes referred to as ''[[benign]] MS''.<ref name="pmid18219812">{{cite journal

Secondary progressive MS describes those with initial relapsing-remitting MS, who then begin to have progressive neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission.<ref name="pmid8780061"/> Occasional relapses and minor remissions may appear.<ref name="pmid8780061"/> The median time between disease onset and conversion from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive MS is 19&nbsp;years.<ref name="pmid16545751">{{cite journal

Clinical data alone may be sufficient for a diagnosis of MS if an individual has suffered separate episodes of neurologic symptoms characteristic of MS.<ref name="pmid11456302"/> Since some people seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing may hasten and ease the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are [[neuroimaging]], analysis of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and [[evoked potential]]s. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] of the brain and spine shows areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). [[Gadolinium]] can be administered [[intravenous]]ly as a contrast to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation.<ref name="pmid11456302"/><ref name="pmid18256986">{{cite journal

===MS as an autoimmunological disease===
MS is currently believed to be an immune-mediated disorder with an initial trigger, which may have a viral etiology,<ref name="pmid11955556"/> although this concept has been debated for years and some still oppose it. Damage is believed to be caused by the patient's own immune system. The immune system attacks the nervous system, possibly as a result of exposure to a molecule with a similar structure to one of its own.<ref name="pmid11955556"/>

===Lesions===
The name ''multiple sclerosis'' refers to the scars (scleroses – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. MS lesions most commonly involve [[white matter]] areas close to the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]] of the [[cerebellum]], [[brain stem]], [[basal ganglia]] and [[spinal cord]]; and the [[optic nerve]]. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between [[grey matter]] areas, where the processing is done, and the rest of the body. The [[peripheral nervous system]] is rarely involved.<ref name="pmid11955556">{{cite journal

More specifically, MS destroys [[oligodendrocyte]]s, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer—known as the [[myelin]] sheath—which helps the neurons carry [[electricity|electrical]] [[Signal (biology)|signal]]s.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> MS results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as the disease advances, the cutting (transection) of the neuron's extensions or [[axons]].<ref name="pmid17606882">{{cite journal

===Inflammation===
Apart from demyelination, the other pathologic hallmark of the disease is inflammation. According to a strictly immunological explanation of MS, the inflammatory process is caused by [[T cell]]s, a kind of [[lymphocyte]]. Lymphocytes are cells that play an important role in the body's defenses.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> In MS, T cells gain entry into the brain via the [[blood–brain barrier]], a [[capillary]] system that should prevent entrance of T cells into the nervous system.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> The blood–brain barrier is normally not permeable to these types of cells, unless triggered by infection or a virus, which decreases the integrity of the [[tight junction]]s forming the barrier.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> When the blood–brain barrier regains its integrity, usually after infection or virus has cleared, the T cells are trapped inside the brain.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> The T cells recognize myelin as foreign and attack it as if it were an invading virus. This triggers inflammatory processes, stimulating other immune cells and soluble factors like [[cytokine]]s and antibodies. Leaks form in the blood–brain barrier, which in turn cause a number of other damaging effects such as [[edema|swelling]], activation of [[macrophages]], and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins.<ref name="pmid11955556"/>

==Epidemiology==
[[Image:MS Risk.jpg|thumb|left|World map showing that risk (incidence) for MS increases with distance from the equator]]
Two main measures are used in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies: incidence and prevalence. [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] is  the number of new cases per unit of person–time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person–years); while [[prevalence]] is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at a given time.
Prevalence is known to depend not only on incidence, but also on survival rate and migrations of affected people. MS has a prevalence that ranges between 2 and 150 per 100,000 depending on the country or specific population.<ref name="pmid11603614">{{cite journal

Environmental factors during childhood may play an important role in the development of MS later in life. Several studies of migrants show that if migration occurs before the age of fifteen, the migrant acquires the new region's susceptibility to MS. If migration takes place after age fifteen, the migrant retains the susceptibility of his home country.<ref name="pmid15556803"/> However, the age–geographical risk for developing multiple sclerosis may span a larger timescale.<ref name="pmid10775541">{{cite journal

==Causes==
Epidemiological studies of MS have provided hints on possible causes for the disease. Various theories try to combine the known data into plausible explanations, but none has proved definitive. MS likely occurs as a result of some combination of both environmental and genetic factors. 
 
===Genetic cause===
[[Image:HLA complex1.JPG|thumb|right|upright|HLA region of Chromosome&nbsp;6. Changes in this area increase the probability of suffering MS.]]
MS is not considered a [[hereditary]] disease. However, [[genetics]] may play a role in determining a person's susceptibility to MS.

===Infectious cause===
Genetic susceptibility can explain some of the geographic and epidemiological variations in MS incidence, like the high appearance of the disease among some families or the risk decline with genetic distance, but does not account for other phenomena, such as the changes in risk that occur with migration at an early age.<ref name="pmid17444504"/>

An explanation for this epidemiology finding could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare pathogen, is the origin of the disease.<ref name="pmid17444504"/> Different hypotheses have elaborated on the mechanism by which this may occur. The ''hygiene hypothesis'' proposes that exposure to several infectious agents early in life is protective against MS. MS would be an autoimmune reaction triggered in susceptible individuals by multiple infective [[microorganism]]s, with risk increasing with age at infection.<ref name="pmid17444504"/><ref name="pmid5910580">{{cite journal

==Treatment==
{{main|Treatment of multiple sclerosis}}

Although there is no known cure for multiple sclerosis, several therapies have proven helpful. The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS have several [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]]. [[Alternative medicine|Alternative treatments]] are pursued by some patients, despite the paucity of supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study.

===Management of acute attacks===
During symptomatic attacks, administration of high doses of [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[corticosteroid]]s, such as [[methylprednisolone]],<ref> [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682795.html Methylprednisolone Oral.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) ([[2003-04-01]]).

Retrieved on 2007-09-01.</ref> is the routine therapy for acute relapses. The aim of this kind of treatment is to end the attack sooner and leave fewer lasting deficits in the patient. Although generally effective in the short term for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long-term recovery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brusaferri F, Candelise L |title=Steroids for multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials |journal=J.

===Disease-modifying treatments===
[[Image:Injection 23.JPG|right|thumb|Disease-modifying treatments are expensive and most of these require frequent (up-to-daily) injections. Others require IV infusions at 1–3 month intervals.]]
The earliest clinical presentation of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Several studies have shown that treatment with [[interferon]]s during an initial attack can decrease the chance that a patient will develop clinical MS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jacobs LD, Beck RW, Simon JH, ''et al.'' |title=Intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy initiated during a first demyelinating event in multiple sclerosis.

As of 2007, six disease-modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies of different countries for RRMS. Three are interferons: two formulations of [[interferon beta-1a]] (trade names ''Avonex'' and ''Rebif'') and one of [[interferon beta-1b]] (U.S. trade name ''Betaseron'', in Europe and Japan ''Betaferon''). A fourth medication is [[glatiramer acetate]] (''Copaxone''). The fifth medication, [[mitoxantrone]], is an [[immunosuppressant]] also used in [[chemotherapy|cancer chemotherapy]], approved only in the USA and largely for secondary progressive MS. The sixth is [[natalizumab]] (marketed as ''Tysabri''). All six medications are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks and slowing progression to disability, although their efficacy rates differ, and studies of their long-term effects are still lacking.<ref name="pmid17627671">{{cite journal |author=Ruggieri M, Avolio C, Livrea P, Trojano M |title=Glatiramer acetate in multiple sclerosis: a review |journal=CNS Drug Rev |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=178–91 |year=2007 |pmid=17627671 |doi=10.1111/j.1527-3458.2007.00010.x}}</ref><ref name="pmid14974077">{{cite journal |author=Munari L, Lovati R, Boiko A |title=Therapy with glatiramer acetate for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD004678 |year=2004 |pmid=14974077 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004678}}</ref><ref name="pmid11687131">{{cite journal |author=Rice GP, Incorvaia B, Munari L, ''et al'' |title=Interferon in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD002002 |year=2001 |pmid=11687131| doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002002 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref><ref name="pmid16235298">{{cite journal |author=Martinelli Boneschi F, Rovaris M, Capra R, Comi G |title=Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD002127 |year=2005 |pmid=16235298 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002127.pub2}}</ref> Comparisons between immunomodulators (all but mitoxantrone) show that the most effective is natalizumab, both in terms of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression;<ref name="pmid17350652">{{cite journal |author=Johnson KP |title=Control of multiple sclerosis relapses with immunomodulating agents |journal=J.

The interferons and glatiramer acetate are delivered by frequent injections, varying from once-per-day for glatiramer acetate to once-per-week (but intra-muscular) for ''[[Avonex]]''. [[Natalizumab]] and mitoxantrone are given by IV infusion at monthly intervals.

Treatment of progressive MS is more difficult than relapsing-remitting MS. Mitoxantrone has shown positive effects in patients with secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses. It is moderately effective in reducing the progression of the disease and the frequency of relapses in patients in short-term follow-up.<ref name="pmid16235298">{{cite journal |author=Martinelli Boneschi F, Rovaris M, Capra R, Comi G |title=Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD002127 |year=2005 |pmid=16235298 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002127.pub2}}</ref> No treatment has been proven to modify the course of primary progressive MS.<ref name="pmid15907149">{{cite journal |author=Leary SM, Thompson AJ |title=Primary progressive multiple sclerosis: current and future treatment options |journal=CNS drugs |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=369–76 |year=2005 |pmid=15907149 |doi=}}</ref>

As with any medical treatment, these treatments have several adverse effects. One of the most common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferon treatments. Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as [[lipoatrophy]], may develop.

=== Management of the effects of MS ===
Disease-modifying treatments reduce the progression rate of the disease, but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptomatology tends to increase. The disease is associated with a variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and [[disability]]. Management of these deficits is therefore very important. Both drug therapy and [[neurorehabilitation]] have shown to ease the burden of some symptoms, though neither influences disease progression.<ref name="pmid16168933">{{cite journal |author=Kesselring J, Beer S |title=Symptomatic therapy and neurorehabilitation in multiple sclerosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=643–52 |year=2005 |pmid=16168933 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70193-9}}</ref> 
As for any patient with neurologic deficits, a [[multidisciplinary]] approach is key to limiting and overcoming disability; however, there are particular difficulties in specifying a ‘core team’ because people with MS may need help from almost any health profession or service at some point.<ref name="isbn = 1 86016 182 0">{{cite book | last = The Royal College of Physicians |title = Multiple Sclerosis.

The [[life expectancy]] of people with MS, at least for earlier years, is nearly the same as that of unaffected people.<ref name="pmid8017890"/> Almost 40% of patients reach the seventh decade of life.<ref name="pmid3495637"/> Nevertheless, half of the deaths in people with MS are directly related to the consequences of the disease, while 15% more are due to [[suicide]], a percentage much higher than in the healthy population.<ref name="pmid8017890"/><ref name="pmid15561552">{{cite journal

==History==
===Medical discovery===
[[Image:Carswell-Multiple Sclerosis2.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of drawing from Carswell book depicting multiple sclerosis lesions in the [[brain stem]] and [[spinal cord]] (1838)]]

The French [[neurologist]] [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825&ndash;1893) was the first person to recognize multiple sclerosis as a distinct disease in 1868. Summarizing previous reports and adding his own clinical and pathological observations, Charcot called the disease ''sclerose en plaques''. The three signs of MS now known as [[Charcot's triad 1]] are [[nystagmus]], [[intention tremor]], and [[telegraphic speech]], though these are not unique to MS. Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a "marked enfeeblement of the memory" and "conceptions that formed slowly".<ref name="Charcot1">Charcot, J. ''Histologie de la sclerose en plaques.'' Gazette des hopitaux, Paris, 1868; 41: 554–555.</ref>

Prior to Charcot, Robert Carswell (1793&ndash;1857), a British professor of [[pathology]], and [[Jean Cruveilhier]] (1791&ndash;1873), a French professor of pathologic anatomy, had described and illustrated many of the disease's clinical details, but did not identify it as a separate disease.<ref name="pmid3066846">{{cite journal

After Charcot's description, [[Eugène Devic]] (1858–1930), [[Jozsef Balo]] (1895–1979), [[Paul Ferdinand Schilder]] (1886–1940), and [[Otto Marburg]] (1874–1948) described special cases of the disease.

===Historical cases===
There are several historical accounts of people who lived before or shortly after the disease was described by Charcot and probably had MS. 

A young woman called Halldora, who lived in [[Iceland]] around the year 1200, suddenly lost her vision and mobility, but after praying to the saints, recovered them seven days after. [[Saint Lidwina]] of [[Schiedam]] (1380&ndash;1433), a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[nun]], may be one of the first clearly identifiable MS patients. From the age of 16 until her death at 53, she suffered intermittent pain, weakness of the legs, and vision loss&mdash;symptoms typical of MS.<ref name="pmid390966">{{cite journal

[[Augustus d'Este|Augustus Frederick d'Este]] (1794&ndash;1848), an illegitimate grandson of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of Great Britain]], almost certainly suffered from MS. D'Este left a detailed diary describing his 22&nbsp;years living with the disease. His diary began in 1822 and ended in 1846, although it remained unknown until 1948. His symptoms began at age&nbsp;28 with a sudden transient visual loss after the funeral of a friend. During the course of his disease, he developed weakness of the legs, clumsiness of the hands, numbness, dizziness, bladder disturbances, and [[erectile dysfunction]]. In 1844, he began to use a wheelchair. Despite his illness, he kept an optimistic view of life.<ref>{{cite book

Another early account of MS was kept by the British diarist [[W. N. P. Barbellion]], [[nom-de-plume]] of Bruce Frederick Cummings (1889&ndash;1919), who maintained a detailed log of his diagnosis and struggle with MS.<ref name="pmid16103678"/> His diary was published in 1919 as ''The Journal of a Disappointed Man''.<ref>{{cite book

[[Image:Alemtuzumab Fab 1CE1.png|thumb|left|upright|Chemical structure of [[alemtuzumab]].]]

A number of treatments that may curtail attacks or improve function are under investigation. Some of these treatments involve the combination of drugs that are already in use for multiple sclerosis, such as the joint administration of [[mitoxantrone]] and [[glatiramer acetate]] (''Copaxone'').<ref> [http://www.mxga-mstrial.co.uk United Kingdom early Mitoxantrone Copaxone trial.] Onyx Healthcare ([[2006-01-01]]). Retrieved on [[2007-09-02]].</ref> However, most treatments already in clinical trials involve drugs that are used in other diseases.

Alemtuzumab performed better than interferon beta-1a in relapsing-remitting MS reducing disability, imaging abnormalities and frequence of relapses, at the cost of increased [[autoimmunity]] problems. These included three cases of [[immune thrombocytopenic purpura|thrombocytopenic purpura]] which led to the suspension of the therapy.<ref name="pmid1234567">{{cite journal |author=The CAMMS223 Trial Investigators |title=Alemtuzumab vs. Interferon Beta-1a in Early Multiple Sclerosis |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=359 |issue=17 |pages=1786-1801 |year=2008 |pmid=18946064 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
Other drugs in clinical trials have been designed specifically for MS, such as [[fingolimod]],<ref> [http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00289978 Efficacy and Safety of Fingolimod in Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.] ClinicalTrials.gov ([[2006-02-09]]).

New diagnostic and evolution evaluation methods are also being investigated. The measurement of [[antibody|antibodies]] against myelin [[protein]]s such as [[myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein]] and [[myelin basic protein]] could be useful for diagnosis. [[Optical coherence tomography]] of the eye's [[retina]] could be used as a measure of response to medication, axonal degeneration and brain atrophy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Albrecht P, Fröhlich R, Hartung HP, Kieseier BC, Methner A |title=Optical coherence tomography measures axonal loss in multiple sclerosis independently of optic neuritis |journal=J Neurol |volume=Online |issue=  | pages = 1595|year=2007 |pmid=17987252 |doi=10.1007/s00415-007-0538-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gordon-Lipkin E, Chodkowski B, Reich DS ''et al'' |year=2007 |month=October |title=Retinal nerve fiber layer is associated with brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis |journal=Neurology |volume=69 |issue=16 |pages=1603–09 |pmid=17938370 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000295995.46586.ae <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref> Currently there are no clinically established [[laboratory investigation]]s available that can predict prognosis.
