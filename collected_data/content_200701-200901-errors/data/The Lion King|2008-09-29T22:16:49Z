'''''The Lion King''''' is a [[1994 in film|1994]] American [[Animation|animated feature]] film produced by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], released in theaters on June 15, 1994 by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the 32nd film in the [[List of Disney animated features|Disney animated feature]] canon. The film was the highest grossing animated film of all time until the release of ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (a [[Disney/Pixar]] computer-animated film). ''The Lion King'' still holds the record as the highest grossing [[traditionally animated]] film in history.<ref name=Boxofficemojo>{{cite news |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=animation.htm |title = Highest grossing animated films| publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2008-07-29 }}</ref> This film also belongs to an era known as the [[Disney Renaissance]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.decentfilms.com/sections/articles/quovadisdisney.html |title = Disney: Notes on the end of the Disney Renaissance| publisher = decentfilms.com |accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref> 

The story, which was strongly influenced by the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] play ''[[Hamlet]]'' and Disney's 1942 classic ''[[Bambi]]'', takes place in a kingdom of [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals in Africa.<ref name="PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins">{{cite video | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2), Origins  | medium = DVD  | publisher = [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]  | date2=1994-06-15}}</ref> A musical film, ''The Lion King'' garnered two [[Academy Award]]s for its achievement in music.

== Plot ==
''The Lion King'' takes place in the Pride Lands of Africa where a [[lion]] rules over the other animals as [[king]]. [[Rafiki]] ([[Robert Guillaume]]), a wise old [[mandrill]], anoints [[Simba]] (cub by [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]], adult by [[Matthew Broderick]]), the newborn cub of King [[Mufasa]] ([[James Earl Jones]]) and Queen [[List of The Lion King characters#Sarabi|Sarabi]] ([[Madge Sinclair]]), and presents him to a gathering of animals at Pride Rock ("[[Circle of Life]]").

Mufasa's brother, [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] ([[Jeremy Irons]]), now upset that he is no longer the primary heir to the throne (having been demoted by Simba's birth), plots to regain his place as [[heir apparent]].  The remainder of the movie centers around Scar's (initially) successful attempt to become King over the Pride Lands, and Simba's (eventual) successful reclamation of his rightful place as King.

Mufasa takes Simba on a tour of the Pride Lands, teaching him about the "[[Balance of nature (biological fallacy)|Circle of Life]]", the delicate balance affecting all living things. Later at Pride Rock, Scar piques Simba's curiosity about the [[elephant's graveyard|elephant graveyard]], a place where Mufasa has forbidden Simba to go. Simba asks his mother if he can go to the water-hole with his best friend,  [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]] (cub by [[Niketa Calame]], adult by [[Moira Kelly]]). Their parents agree but only if Mufasa's [[majordomo]], the [[hornbill]] [[Zazu]] ([[Rowan Atkinson]]), goes with them. Simba and Nala elude Zazu's supervision ("[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]") and go to the graveyard instead.  There, the cubs are met by [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed]] ([[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Cheech Marin]] and [[Jim Cummings]]), [[spotted hyena]]s who try to kill them, but they are rescued by Mufasa. Scar gains the loyalty of the hyenas by claiming that if he becomes king, they'll "never go hungry again" ("[[Be Prepared (The Lion King song)|Be Prepared]]"). During the song, Scar tells the hyenas that for this to happen they must kill Mufasa and Simba, thus establishing his plan of [[regicide]].

[[Image:YoungSimbaSmilestlk.png|thumb|left|Simba, meeting Timon and Pumbaa]] 

Some time later, Scar lures Simba into a gorge for a "surprise from his father" while the hyenas create a [[wildebeest]] stampede. Alerted by Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a steep cliff. Scar, instead of helping Mufasa, flings his brother into the stampede below. Simba sees his father fall and rushes down the cliff after him, only to find him dead. Scar convinces the young cub that he was responsible for his father's death and recommends that he flee from the Pride Lands. Scar once again sends Shenzi, Banzai and Ed to kill Simba but he escapes. Scar informs the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed and that he is assuming the throne as the next in line. Scar proclaims that "this is the dawning of a new era, in which lion and hyena come together", thus allowing the hyenas into the Pride Lands.

In a distant desert, Simba is found unconscious by [[Timon and Pumbaa]] ([[Nathan Lane]] and [[Ernie Sabella]]), a [[meerkat]]-[[warthog]] duo who adopt and raise the cub under their worry-free philosophy ("[[Hakuna matata|Hakuna Matata]]"). When Simba has grown into an adult he is discovered by Nala, who tells him that Scar has turned the Pride Lands into a barren wasteland. She asks Simba to return and take his place as king but Simba refuses, still believing he caused his father's death. Simba shows Nala around his home and the two begin to fall in love ("[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]"). Nala, however, tells Simba that she does not understand why he will not return to Pride Rock and they end up in a quarrel. Rafiki arrives and persuades Simba to return to the Pride Lands, aided by the appearance of the ghost of Mufasa.

[[Image:PDVD 889.jpg|thumb|right|Simba and Nala during the "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" sequence]]

Once back at Pride Rock, Simba (with Timon, Pumbaa and Nala) is horrified to see the condition of the Pride Lands. Timon and Pumbaa create a diversion, allowing Simba and Nala to sneak past the hyenas guarding Pride Rock. After seeing his mother struck by Scar for criticizing him, Simba announces his return. In response, Scar tells the pride that Simba was responsible for Mufasa's death and corners Simba at the edge of Pride Rock. As Simba dangles over the edge of Pride Rock, Scar proudly reveals to Simba that ''he'' was actually responsible for Mufasa's death. Enraged, Simba leaps up and pins Scar to the ground, forcing him to admit the truth to the pride.

Atop Pride Rock's peak, Simba corners Scar. To gain Simba's mercy, Scar blames everything on the hyenas but Shenzi, Banzai and Ed overhear this betrayal. Simba demands that Scar go into [[exile]]. Scar pretends to leave but turns to attack Simba, resulting in a final duel. Simba triumphs over his uncle by kicking him over a low cliff. Scar survives the fall but finds himself surrounded by the now-resentful hyenas, who attack him. Simba and Nala become the new king and queen of the Pride Lands. The film concludes with the Pride Lands turning green with life again and Rafiki presenting Simba and Nala's newborn cub as "The Circle of Life" continues.

==Production==
The production of ''The Lion King'', originally titled ''King of the Jungle'',<ref name="kingofthejungle">{{cite web | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | title=The Lion King (1994) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/| accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref> took place at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in [[Glendale, California]], and [[Disney-MGM Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Thirteen supervising animators, both in California and Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film's main characters. Nearly twenty minutes of the film were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios.<ref name=LionKingProduction>{{cite web |url=http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |title=Lion King Production Notes |accessdate=2008-08-05|publisher=Lionking.org}}</ref>
Ultimately, more than 600 artists, animators and technicians contributed to the ''The Lion King'' over its lengthy production schedule. More than one million drawings were created for the film, including 1,197 hand-painted backgrounds and 119,058 individually colored frames of film.<ref name="LionKingProduction"/> 

In April 1992, when [[Rob Minkoff]] joined the directing team, a session was held to revamp the story. [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Gary Trousdale]], the directors responsible for ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', also attended. For two days, the producer, [[Don Hahn]], presided over the discussion that finally produced a character makeover for Simba and a radically revised second half of the film.<ref name="LionKingProduction"/> Screenwriter [[Irene Mecchi]] joined the team that summer to help further develop the characters and define their personalities. Several months later, she was joined by [[Jonathan Roberts (writer)|Jonathan Roberts]] in the rewriting process. Working together in the animation department and in conjunction with the directors and story team, they tackled the unresolved emotional issues in the script and also added many comic situations, with Pumbaa and Timon and with the hyenas.<ref name="LionKingProduction"/>
<!--
Story head, [[Brenda Chapman]], gave insight to the challenge of the story by saying, "Writing an original story is definitely more challenging, because there is nothing to fall back on. There is no structure to begin with. Sometimes we found ourselves in left field and didn't know it until we were way out there. The story changed quite a bit from the initial idea that Simba would stay with the pride after his father's death. It was our job to make the main character likeable and sympathetic. It was also challenging to make the environment and characters interesting. In real life, lions basically sleep, eat and have no props."<ref name="LionKingProduction"/> -->

Animators studied real-life animals for reference, as was done for the earlier film, ''[[Bambi]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/collection/masterworks/bambi/index.html |title=Bambi Notes |accessdate=2008-08-11 |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]}}</ref>  [[Jim Fowler]], renowned wildlife expert, visited the studio on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other jungle inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings an authentic feel. He taught them how lions greet one another by gently butting heads, and show affection by placing one's head under the other's chin. Fowler also talked about how they protect themselves by lying on their backs and using their claws to ward off attackers, and how they fight rivals by rising on their hind legs.<ref name=LionKingProduction/> 

The main locations for the film, including Pride Rock and the Gorge, are modeled after [[Hell's Gate National Park]] in Kenya.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/trivia|title=The Lion King (1994)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref> To prepare the filmmakers, some of the lead production crew made a trip to Africa to better understand the environment for the film. The trip gave production designer [[Chris Sanders]] a new appreciation for the natural environments and inspired him to find ways to incorporate these elements into the design of the film.<ref name=LionKingProduction /> 

[[Image:Lionkingwilderbeest.jpg|thumb|left|Simba, during the "wildebeest stampede" sequence]] 

The use of computers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways. The most notable use of [[computer animation]] is in the "wildebeest stampede" sequence. Several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, [[cel shading|cel shaded]] to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd. Similar multiplication occurs in the "[[Be Prepared (song)|Be Prepared]]" musical number with identical marching hyenas.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2), Computer Animation|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]|date2=1994-06-15}}</ref> Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the 2Â½ minute stampede sequence.<ref name=LionKingProduction/>

At one time, the Disney Feature Animation staff felt ''The Lion King'' was less important than ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]''.<ref name=PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins /> Both projects were in production at the same time, and most of the staff preferred to work on ''Pocahontas'', believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.<ref name=PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins /> Songwriter [[Elton John]] thought his career had hit a new low when he was writing the music to the song "Hakuna Matata".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legends.disney.go.com/legends/detail?key=Elton+John|title=Disney Legends: Elton John|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref> While both films were commercial successes, ''The Lion King'' received more positive feedback and larger grosses than ''Pocahontas''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pocahontas.htm |title=Pocahontas revenue |accessdate=2008-08-11 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref><ref name="rottentomatoestlk">{{cite web | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title=Rotten Tomatoes - The Lion King |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/| accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref><ref name="rottentomatoespocahontas">{{cite web | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title=Rotten Tomatoes - ''Pocahontas'' |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1063809-pocahontas/| accessdate=2006-09-17}}</ref>

Two months prior to the film's release, [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s [[chief operating officer]] [[Frank Wells]] died in a helicopter crash, and a statement in remembrance of Wells was added to the beginning of the original theatrical film. Later, on the IMAX and DVD release, it was moved to the end credits.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=Film Freak Central| title=''The Lion King'' DVD review |url=http://filmfreakcentral.net/dvdreviews/lionking.htm| accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref>

==Music==
[[Elton John]] and [[Tim Rice]] wrote five original songs for this film, with Elton John performing "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" during the end credits. The film's score was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and supplemented with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by [[Lebo M]].<ref>{{cite video | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 1), Music: African Influence  | medium = DVD  | publisher = [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]  | date2=1994-06-15}}</ref>

===Songs===
Here are the musical numbers in the film, listed in the order of their occurrence:

*"'''[[Circle of Life]]'''" is sung by an off-screen character voiced by [[Carmen Twillie (actress)| Carmen Twillie]], with African vocals by [[Lebo M]] and his African choir. This [[song]] is played during the ceremony where the newborn Simba is presented to the animals of the Pride Lands. The song is reprised at the end of the film, during the presentation of Simba and Nala's newborn cub.
*"'''The Morning Report'''" was originally a scene created for the theatrical film but never made it past the [[storyboard]] stage. It was later cut and the song lyrics were written to be used for the live musical version of ''The Lion King'' instead.<ref>{{cite video | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 1), "The Making of The Morning Report"  | medium = DVD  | publisher = [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]  | date2=1994-06-15}}</ref> It was later added, with an accompanying animated sequence, to the 2003 Platinum Edition home video rerelease. Sung by [[Zazu]] ([[Jeff Bennett]]), [[Mufasa]] ([[James Earl Jones]]) and young [[Simba]] (Evan Saucedo), the song is an extension of the scene in the original film where Zazu delivers a morning report to Mufasa, and later gets pounced on by Simba. 
*"'''[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]'''" is sung by young [[Simba]] ([[Jason Weaver]]), young Nala (Laura Williams), and Zazu ([[Rowan Atkinson]]). Simba uses this musical number in the film to distract Zazu so that he and Nala can sneak off to the elephant graveyard, at the same time expressing his wish to be king as soon as possible.
*"'''[[Be Prepared (The Lion King song)|Be Prepared]]'''" is sung by [[Scar]] ([[Jeremy Irons]]/[[Jim Cummings]]), [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed#Shenzi|Shenzi]] ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]), [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed#Banzai|Banzai]] ([[Cheech Marin]]) and [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed#Ed|Ed]] (Jim Cummings). In this song, Scar reveals his plot to kill Mufasa and Simba to his hyena minions.
*"'''[[Hakuna Matata (song)|Hakuna Matata]]'''" is sung by [[Timon and Pumbaa|Timon]] ([[Nathan Lane]]), [[Timon and Pumbaa|Pumbaa]] ([[Ernie Sabella]]) and Simba (Jason Weaver as a cub and [[Joseph Williams]] as an adult). Timon and Pumbaa use this song as a warm welcome to Simba as he arrives at their jungle home, and to explain their "no worries" lifestyle. The sequence also contains a [[montage]] in which Simba grows into a young adult, indicating the passage of time in Simba's life in the jungle. The [[American Film Institute]] released its [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Songs]] list in 2004 and "Hakuna Matata" was listed at number 99.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classicmovies.org/articles/afi100songs.htm|title=AFI's "100 Years, 100 Songs|accessdate=2008-08-09 |publisher=Classic Movies}}</ref>
*"'''[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]'''" is a love song sung mainly by an off-screen character voiced by Kristle Edwards, along with Timon (Nathan Lane), Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), adult Simba (Joseph Williams) and adult Nala ([[Sally Dworsky]]). This musical sequence shows Timon and Pumbaa's frustration at seeing Simba fall in love, and the development of Simba and Nala's romantic relationship. The song won the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for Best Original Song during the [[67th Academy Awards]].

=== Soundtrack and other albums ===
{{main|The Lion King (soundtrack)}}

The film's original motion picture soundtrack was released on July 13, 1994. It was the fourth best-selling album of the year on the [[Billboard 200]] and the top-selling soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+200&g=Year-end+Albums&year=1994 |title=Year-end 1994 Billboard 200|accessdate=2008-08-05 |publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''}}</ref>

On February 28, 1995, Disney released an album entitled ''[[Rhythm of the Pride Lands]]'', which featured songs and performances inspired by, but not featured in, the film. Focusing on the African influences in the film's original music, most of the tracks were by African composer Lebo M, sung either partially or entirely in various African languages. Several songs included on the album would be used in other ''The Lion King''-related projects, such as the stage musical and the direct-to-video sequels (''e.g.'', "He Lives In You" was used as the opening song for ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', and a reincarnation of "Warthog Rhapsody", called "That's All I Need", in ''The Lion King 1Â½''). ''Rhythm of the Pride Lands'' was initially issued in a very limited quantity, but there was a 2003 rerelease included in some international versions of ''The Lion King'''s special edition soundtrack, with an additional track. Additionally, ''The Lion King Expanded Score'' contains never-before-released instrumental music from Hans Zimmer's original score.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hans-zimmer.com/fr/disco_detail.php?id=534 |title=Lion King Expanded Score Info|accessdate=2008-07-31 |publisher=Hans-Zimmer.com}}</ref>

The compilation ''[[Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic]]'' includes "Circle of Life", "I Just Can't Wait to Be King", "Hakuna Matata", "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?", and "Be Prepared".
The compilation ''[[Disney's Greatest Hits]]'' also includes "Circle of Life", "Hakuna Matata", and "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?".

==Reception==
===Box office performance===
''The Lion King'' became the highest grossing motion picture of 1994 worldwide, and the second highest in the USA (behind ''[[Forrest Gump (film)|Forrest Gump]]'').<ref name="movies">{{cite web | publisher= [[Movies.com]] | title=Highest grossing movies of 1994 |url=http://movies.go.com/boxoffice?cat=1994| accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref>  The film initially made [[United States dollar|US$]]312,855,561 domestically, including a short return to theaters in November 1994, and adding in its 2002 [[IMAX]] rerelease the domestic total is $328,541,776.<ref name="boxoffice">{{cite web | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | title=''The Lion King'' box office|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lionking.htm| accessdate=2006-07-30}}</ref>

''The Lion King'' held the record for the most successful animated feature film until 2003 when it was surpassed by the [[computer animated]] ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', but it remains the highest grossing ''hand-drawn'' animated feature film.<ref name="Boxofficemojo" /> When adjusted for inflation, however, it is the fourth top-grossing animated film (after ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' and ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'').

''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called the film "a superbly drawn animated feature" and, in his print review wrote, "The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to ''Hamlet'', is a learning experience as well as an entertainment."<ref name="tlkebertreview">{{cite web | last=Ebert | first=Roger | publisher=''[[Chicago Sun Times]]''|date=[[1994-06-24]]| title=''The Lion King'' review|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940624/REVIEWS/406240301/1023| accessdate=2006-08-31}}</ref> However, on the television program ''[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Siskel & Ebert]]'' the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to previous Disney films. [[Gene Siskel]] and Roger Ebert both gave the film a "Thumbs Up" but Siskel said that it was not as good as earlier films such as ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and was "a good film, not a great one".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper]]| title=''The Lion King'' review|url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&subsec=1140| accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> Hal Hinson of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it "an impressive, almost daunting achievement" and felt that the film was "spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney's feature-length animations", but was less enthusiastic toward the end of his review saying, "Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids.

===Awards and nominations===
''The Lion King'' received many award nominations, including the [[Academy Award]] for Best Original Score (by [[Hans Zimmer]]) and the [[Golden Globe award]] for Best Motion Picture &ndash; Musical or Comedy, both of which it won.

==Home video==
''The Lion King'' was first released on [[VHS]] and [[laserdisc]] in the United States on March 3, 1995, under [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s "[[Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection|Masterpiece Collection]]" video series. In addition, Deluxe Editions of both formats were released. The VHS Deluxe Edition included the film, an exclusive [[lithograph]] of Rafiki and Simba (in some editions), a commemorative "Circle of Life" [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]], six concept art lithographs, another tape with the half-hour TV show ''The Making of The Lion King'', and a certificate of authenticity. The CAV laserdisc Deluxe Edition also contained the film, six concept art lithographs and ''The Making of The Lion King'', and added storyboards, character design artwork, concept art, rough animation, and a directors' commentary that the VHS edition did not have, on a total of four double sided disks. The VHS tape quickly became one of the best-selling videotapes of all time: 4.5 million tapes were sold on the first day<ref name="homevideosellingfigures">{{cite web |publisher=ComingSoon.Net | title=''The Lion King'' home video selling figures|url=http://comingsoon.net/news.php?id=1818| accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref> and ultimately sales totaled more than 30 million<ref name="EWlionking">{{cite web | publisher=Ew.com | title="Lion King" sets new records with DVD release|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,517818,00.html| accessdate=2008-08-16}}</ref> before these home video versions went into [[moratorium (entertainment)|moratorium]] in 1997.<ref name="homevideoinfo">{{cite web | publisher=Lionking.org | title=TLK on Home Video|url=http://www.lionking.org/homevideo.html| accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref> 

On October 7, 2003, the film was rereleased on VHS and released on DVD for the first time, titled ''The Lion King: Platinum Edition'', as part of Disney's [[Platinum Edition]] line of animated classic DVDs. The DVD release featured two versions of the film on the first disc: a remastered version created for the 2002 [[IMAX]] release and the original 1994 theatrical version.  A second disc, with bonus features, was also included in the DVD release.  The film's soundtrack was provided both in its original [[Dolby 5.1]] track and in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix, making this one of the first Disney DVDs so equipped.<ref name="DVDfeatures">{{cite web | publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] | title=''The Lion King'' Special Edition DVD features|url=http://disneyvideos.disney.go.com/moviefinder/products/3038703.html#details| accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref> By means of [[seamless branching]], the film could be viewed either with or without a newly-created scene â a short conversation in the film replaced with a complete song ("The Morning Report"). A Special Collector's Gift Set was also released, containing the DVD set, five exclusive lithographed character portraits (new sketches created and signed by the original character animators), and an introductory book entitled ''The Journey''.<ref name="homevideoinfo" />

The Platinum Edition of ''The Lion King'' was criticized by fans for its false advertising: producer [[Don Hahn]] had earlier stated that the film would be in its original 1994 theatrical version, but it was confirmed after release that it was the "digitally enhanced" IMAX version instead, which is slightly different from the original theatrical cut. One of the most noticeable differences is the re-drawn [[crocodiles]] in the "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" sequence.<ref name="dvddifferences">{{cite web | publisher=UltimateDisney.com | title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition DVD Review (Page 2) which shows the differences between the film presented on the DVD and the original theatrical cut|url=http://www.ultimatedisney.com/thelionking2.html| accessdate=2006-08-23}}</ref> 

Despite this criticism, more than two million copies of the Platinum Edition DVD and VHS units were sold on the first day of release.<ref name="homevideosellingfigures" /> A DVD boxed set of the three ''The Lion King'' films (in two-disc Special Edition formats) was released on December 6, 2004. In January 2005, the film, along with the sequels, went back into moratorium,<ref name="outofprint">{{cite web | publisher=UltimateDisney.com | title=Out of Print Disney DVDs|url=http://www.ultimatedisney.com/OOP.htm| accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref> but new and used copies still sell very well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Lion-King-Disney-Special-Platinum/dp/B00003CXB4|title=Amazon.com DVD Page|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2008-08-16}}</ref> Disney has yet to announce a date for the [[Blu-ray Disc]] release, although the studio showed clips of the film on Blu-ray at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/ces2008/|title=CES 2008 report|publisher=Blu-ray.com|accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
===Story origin===
[[Image:Kimbasimba.JPG|thumb|290px|left|Comparison of ''Kimba the White Lion'' (left) and ''The Lion King'' on pride rock (right)]]
{{main|Kimba the White Lion#The Lion King controversy}}
''The Lion King'' was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story, rather than being based on an already-existing story.<ref name="PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins"/><ref name="LionKingProduction"/> The filmmakers have said that the story of ''The Lion King'' was inspired by the [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] and [[Moses]] stories from the [[Bible]] and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref name="PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins"/> Certain elements of the film, however, bear a resemblance to a famous 1960s Japanese [[anime]] [[television]] show, ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]''.<ref name="Kimba">{{cite web | publisher=Kimbawlion.com | title=Comparison screen-shots of ''The Lion King'' and ''Kimba the White Lion''|url=http://www.kimbawlion.com/rant2.htm| accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref> One similarity is the protagonists' names: Kimba and Simba, although the word "simba" means "lion" in [[Swahili]].<ref>As shown in a search for either term at [http://africanlanguages.com/swahili/ Online Swahili - English Dictionary].</ref> Another point is that most characters in ''Kimba'' have an analogue in ''The Lion King'' and that various individual scenes are nearly identical in composition and camera angle. Early production artwork on the film's Platinum Edition DVD even includes a white lion.<ref name="PlatinumEditionDVDPresentationReel">{{cite video | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2), Presentation Reel  | medium = DVD  | publisher = [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]  | date2=1994-06-15}}</ref> Disney's official stance is that the similarities are all coincidental.<ref name='Lion king/Kimba'>{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Hong | title=The Lion King/Kimba controversy | date= [[2002-05-19]] | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | url =http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/120586440.html?dids=120586440:120586440&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+19%2C+2002&author=PETER+HONG&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=L.4&desc=Weekend+Escape%3B+Before+Silicon+Valley%2C+There+Was+San+Jose%3B+Seeking+out+history%2C+Asian+and+otherwise%2C+in+California%27s+oldest+city |pages =L4 | accessdate = 2008-08-12 }}</ref>

The only elements alleged to have been taken from ''Kimba'' are the character designs and certain individual scenes&mdash;the plots are different.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} [[Christopher Vogler]], in his book ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers]]'', described Disney's request that he suggest how to improve the plot of ''The Lion King'' by incorporating ideas from ''Hamlet''.<ref name="mythicstructure">{{cite book | last=Vogler | first=Christopher | title=''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers'' | date=1998}}</ref> It has also been noted that the plot bears some resemblance to the [[West Africa]]n [[Epic of Sundiata]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED386732&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=ED386732|title=The True Lion King of Africa: The Epic History of Sundiata, King of Old Mali.|publisher=[[Education Resources Information Center]]|accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref>

===Alleged subliminal messaging===
[[Image:Lionkg2.jpg|thumb|right|The supposed "SEX" frame]]
In one scene of the film's original VHS and LaserDisc releases, it appears as if the word "SEX" might have been embedded into the dust flying in the sky when Simba flops down,<ref name="The "SEX" frame">{{cite web | publisher=[[Snopes]]|title=The alleged "SEX" frame in ''The Lion King''|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/lionking.htm| accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> which conservative activist [[Donald Wildmon]] asserted was a [[subliminal message]] intended to promote [[sexual promiscuity]]. The film's [[animator]]s, however, have stated that the letters spell "SFX" (a common abbreviation of "special effects"), and was intended as an innocent "signature" created by the effects animation team.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hartmann|first=Caroline|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/what-disney-all-about|title=What Disney is all about|publisher=''[[Michigan Daily]]''|date=[[2007-02-01]]|accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref> Due to the controversy it had caused, the scene was edited for the film's 2003 DVD and VHS releases, and the dust no longer formed any letters.<ref name="editedsex">{{cite video | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 1)  | medium = DVD  | publisher = [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]  | date=  2003}}</ref>

==="The Lion Sleeps Tonight"===
The use of the song "[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]" in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa has led to disputes between Disney and the family of South African [[Solomon Linda]], who composed the song (originally titled "Mbube") in 1939. In July 2004, the family filed suit, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.<ref name="undisclosed">{{cite web | publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2006-02-16]] |title=Disney settles Lion song dispute|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4721564.stm | accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref>

===Hamas' propaganda===
In August 2007, the [[Hamas]] organization produced an animated propaganda film that allegedly mimicked the style of ''The Lion King''. The program was aired via their [[television station]], ''Al-Aqsa TV''. Hamas was portrayed as a lion that chased and killed rats that bore the likenesses of members of the secular [[Fatah]] organization in [[Gaza]]. The program was briefly aired but was pulled off the air for revision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSB569000 |title=Hamas "Lion King" cartoon re-enacts Gaza takeover |accessdate=2007-11-14 |author=Nidal al-Mughrabi |date=[[2007-09-04]] |publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/24/africa/ME-GEN-Palestinians-Hamas-Lion-King.php |title=Hamas battle cartoon mimics "Lion King" |accessdate=2007-12-24 |date=[[2007-08-24]] |publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]''}}</ref>

===Appropriateness for children===

Despite being given a "G" rating by the MPAA, there has been criticism that '''The Lion King'' (as well as various other Disney films) contains adult themes. The most well known example is Mufasa's death. <ref>http://depts.clackamas.cc.or.us/banyan/4.2/edwards.htm</ref><ref>http://www.qwipster.net/lionking.htm</ref>

The British version of the film had a warning on the box that some scenes may be disturbing for children.

==Impact on popular culture==
[[Image:2f32.jpg|left|thumb|Mufasa's cameo in the episode "[['Round Springfield]]" from ''[[The Simpsons]]'']]
Because of its popularity, ''The Lion King'' has been referenced in a variety of media. For instance, the animated TV series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' spoofed the film in the episode "[['Round Springfield]]". Toward the end of the episode, the ghost of Mufasa appears in the clouds with [[Bleeding Gums Murphy]] and [[Darth Vader]], and [[James Earl Jones]] (who voiced both Mufasa and Darth Vader) says, "This is [[CNN]]. You must avenge my death, Kimba... dah, I mean Simba," a reference to the ''Lion King''/''Kimba the White Lion'' controversy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.starwars.com/community/news/media/f20070724/index.html|title=I Bent My Wookiee! Celebrating the Star Wars/Simpsons Connection|accessdate=2008-04-22|date=[[2007-07-24]]|author=Scott Chernoff|publisher=Lucas Online}}</ref>

Disney also frequently referenced ''The Lion King'' in its own films and shows. For example, in the Disney-released, [[Pixar]]-produced 1995 computer animated film ''[[Toy Story]]'', the song "[[Hakuna Matata]]" can be heard playing in [[List of Toy Story characters#Andy Davis|Andy's]] car during the film's climax.<ref name="toystory">{{cite web | publisher=The Easter Egg Archive | title=''Toy Story'' easter eggs|url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/46803.html| accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> Pumbaa made a cameo in ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996),<ref name="aladdin3">{{cite web | publisher=[[TV.com]]| title=''Aladdin and the King of Thieves''|url=http://www.tv.com/aladdin/aladdin-and-the-king-of-thieves/episode/83700/summary.html| accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref>
and ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' (1997) paid homage to both ''The Lion King'' and the [[Nemean Lion]]: Scar's skin is worn by Hercules while he is posing for a painting on a [[Greece|Greek]] vase.<ref name="hercules">{{cite web |publisher=The Easter Egg Archive| title=''Hercules'' Easter Egg|url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/1306.html| accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref>

==Sequels and spin-offs==
The success of the film led to several spin-offs, the first being a 70&nbsp;mm film released in 1995 titled ''[[Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable]]''. It promoted environmental friendliness and was shown in the [[The Land (Disney)|The Land Pavilion]]'s Harvest Theater at [[Epcot]] in [[Walt Disney World]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdwhistory.com/FindFile.Ashx?/Epcot/FutureWorld/Land/CircleofLife/|title=Circle of Life at Walt Disney World|publisher=WDWHistory.com|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref> A spin-off television series called ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa]]'', which focused on the titular meerkat and warthog duo in a more modern, human world than that of the film, also debuted in 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/show/10327/summary.html|title=''The Lion King's'' Timon & Pumbaa |publisher=[[TV.com]]|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref>

In addition, a [[direct-to-video]] sequel called ''[[The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride]]'' was released in 1998,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/simbaspride/|title=The Lion King 2:Simba's Pride|publisher=disney.go.com|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref> focusing on Simba and his daughter [[List of The Lion King characters#Kiara|Kiara]] as she falls in love with [[List of The Lion King characters#Kovu|Kovu]], a former member of Scar's pride. Finally, a direct-to-video [[prequel]]-[[Sequel#Parallel|parallel]], ''[[The Lion King 1Â½]]'' (also known as ''The Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata''), was released in 2004, providing some background on Timon and Pumbaa and giving the timeline of ''The Lion King'' from their perspective.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/bcdb/cartoon.cgi?film=25090/|title=The Lion King 1 1/2|publisher=bcdb.com|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref>

Many characters from ''The Lion King'', including Timon, Pumbaa, Simba, Nala, Rafiki, Zazu, Shenzi, Banzai, Ed, Scar and Mufasa, appear in the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[House of Mouse]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whatsitsgalore.com/disney/house.html |title=House of Mouse Cast of Characters|publisher=WhatsIts Galore|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref>  Some of them also appear in the series' spin-off movies ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' and ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''.

===Musical===
{{main|The Lion King (musical)}}
''The Lion King'' was adapted into a successful [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage musical in 1997. The musical is based on ''The Lion King'' film and is directed by [[Julie Taymor]], using actors in animal costumes as well as giant, hollow [[puppet]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/theatre/thelionking/#/background/behindthescenes/ | publisher=disney.go.com| title=The Lion King, Disney on Broadway (Behind the Scenes)| accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref>
