The '''flag of [[Lithuania]]''' is a horizontal [[tricolour|tricolor]] of [[yellow]], [[green]] and [[red]]. The flag was adopted on [[March 20]], [[1989]] on the advent of breaking away from the [[Soviet Union]]. Before its readoption, this flag was used from 1918 until 1940, when Lithuania was occupied in turn by [[Nazi Germany]] and by the [[Soviet Union]]. From 1945 until 1989, the [[Flag of Lithuanian SSR|Soviet Lithuanian flag]] consisted first of a generic [[red]] flag with the name of the republic, then changed to the more familiar red flag with [[white]] and green bars at the bottom.  The last change to the flag occurred in 2004 when the [[aspect ratio]] changed from 1:2 to 3:5.

The earliest known flags with a Lithuanian identity were recorded in the 15th century [[Banderia Prutenorum]] manuscript, written by [[Jan Długosz]]. At the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, two distinct flags were present. The majority of the 40 regiments carried a red banner with a mounted knight, chasing an unseen enemy. This flag, known as the [[Vytis]], would eventually be used as the Lithuanian war flag, and again in 2004 as the state flag. The remainder of the regiments carried a red banner displaying the [[Columns of Gediminas]]. Those that bore the Vytis, also known as the [[Coat of arms of Pogoń Litewska|Pahonia]], were armies from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], while those who bore the Columns of Gediminas were from noble families of Lithuania. Until the end of the 18th century, when they were annexed by the [[Russian Empire]], the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the successor states of Lithuania used the Vytis as their flag.<ref name="history"/>

The birth of the yellow, green, and red tricolor occurred during a drive by other European republics to change their flags. One example that gave life to the idea of the tricolor was the [[France|French]] blue, white and red flag adopted after the [[French Revolution]]. The only tricolor that existed for Lithuania before the yellow, green and red flag was a green, white and red flag used to represent [[Lithuania Minor]].<ref name="history"/> 

It is not known who originated the suggestion of yellow, green and red, but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living in Europe or in the United States during the 19th century. These three colors were frequently used in folk weavings and [[national costume|traditional dress]].<ref>{{en icon}} [http://www.fibtex.lodz.pl/56_12_37.pdf Lithuanian folk textile arts]</ref> At the [[Great Seimas of Vilnius]], this flag was favored over the Vytis banner as the flag of the Lithuanian nation. The Vytis was not chosen for two reasons: the first reason was that as part of the drive for national identity, the [[Seimas]] (the Lithuanian parliament) wished to distance itself somewhat from the flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which encompassed now-distinct nations such as Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine. The second issue was the choice of the color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with Marxist or Communist causes. Debates about the national flag occurred again in 1917, but after consultations with [[heraldry|heraldists]], the yellow, green and red tricolor was chosen as the flag in 1918.<ref name="history"/>

Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green and red did not follow the existing rules of [[heraldry]]. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.  During [[World War II]], Lithuania was occupied by both [[Nazi]] Germany and the [[Soviet Union]]. Two flags were used during the period of Soviet occupation; immediately after the war, the flag consisted of a red field, golden hammer and sickle with SSR in gold above it. That flag was replaced in 1953 by the last flag used by the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]] - a red flag, with the hammer and sickle and star in the hoist. At the bottom of the flag, a white and green horizontal bar was placed.<ref name="history"/> 

During 1988, when the Lithuanian movement towards independence was gaining strength, the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet again recognized the tricolor as the national flag, formally defining the colors a year later. After independence from the Soviet Union, the tricolor flag was written into the new [[Constitution of Lithuania]], which was adopted by referendum in 1992.<ref name="history"/>

== Design and symbolism ==
Passed on [[June 26]], [[1991]], the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Lithuanian State Flag governs the design, sizes and use of the state flag. The law was last amended on [[July 8]], [[2004]], with the most notable changes including the switching of the national flag ratio from 1:2 to 3:5 and the official adoption of a historical flag as the state (government) flag. The amendment came into force on [[September 1]], [[2004]], after it was approved by [[President of Lithuania|President]] [[Valdas Adamkus]].<ref name="flaglaw">{{en icon}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=257119 Seimas of Lithuania - Republic of Lithuania Law on the National Flag and Other Flags - No. I-1497]. Passed on Jun 26 1991. Amended Jul 8 2004 and May 12 2005. Retrieved Dec 14 2006.</ref>

The exact colors of both the national and state flag are made according to the [[Pantone Matching System]], specifically Pantone textile-paper (TP). The ratio of both the national and state flag must be 3:5, with the standard flag size to be 1 [[meter]] by 1.7 meters. Different sizes of the flag can be created, but they must conform to the color codes and ratio requirements set in the law.<ref name="flaglaw"/>

The yellow in the flag is meant to symbolize the golden fields of Lithuania, the green is for its green countrysides, and the red represents all the blood that has been shed for Lithuania.<ref name="history">{{en icon}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/home/w5_viewer/statiniai/seimu_istorija/w5_show-p_r=4056&p_d=49324&p_k=2.html  Seimas of Lithuania - History of the National Flag].

== State flag ==
[[Image:State Flag of Lithuania.svg|thumb|State (historic) flag adopted in 2004]]
In 2004, along with the law authorizing the change of the flag ratio, a state flag was adopted. This flag displays the national emblem in a banner form. The ratio of the flag is the same as that of the national flag, i.e. 3:5. The state flag, called the historical flag in law, was proposed by [[Česlovas Juršėnas]], the vice-speaker of the Seimas, and by [[Edmundas Rimša]], the chairman of the Commission of Heraldry. This flag was also proposed at the same time as the grand coat of arms; both were meant to honor the 750th anniversary of the coronation of [[Mindaugas]] in 1253. The designer of the flag and coat of arms was [[Arvydas Každailis]].<ref name="stateflag"> {{lt icon}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/home/w5_viewer/statiniai/seimu_istorija/w5_show-p_r=4056&p_d=17268&p_k=1.html    Seimas of Lithuania - Symbols - Historic flag]. Retrieved Dec 14 2006, translated on Dec 15 2006. </ref> Historically, this flag was used during the [[Battle of Grunwald]], and has served as the government flag for Central Lithuanian from 1922 until 1939.<ref name="history"/> This was one of the few flags considered to become the national flag during the drive for national independence. It is also worth noting that several other countries have an official national flag for civilian use and a [[state flag]] for government use. Some of the countries that practice this are [[Spain]], [[Venezuela]], [[Germany]] and [[Thailand]].

Under the National Flag Law, the state flag is permanently hoisted at three locations: the [[Royal Palace of Lithuania]], [[Trakai Island Castle]], and the grounds of the Museum of War in Kaunas. In addition, the flag is hoisted at the following locations on these days:<ref name="stateflag"/>

* February 16 - next to the House of Signatories, on Pilies Street in Vilnius
* March 11 - next to Palace of Seimas
* July 6 - next to the Presidential Palace, Vilnius
* July 15 - next to the Ministry of Defense
* October 25 - next to the Seimas Building, the Presidential Palace, and the Gedimino 11 building that houses the Government of Lithuania

== Flag protocol ==
[[Image:Gediminas Tower with flag.jpg|thumb|[[Gediminas Tower]] with the national flag hoisted]]
The flag can be flown vertically or horizontally from public buildings, private homes, businesses, ships, town squares, or during official ceremonies. If the flag is flown horizontally, the yellow stripe must be at top; when flown vertically, the yellow stripe must be facing right with the red stripe facing left. While the flag should be flown from sunrise to sunset, government offices in Lithuania and abroad must fly the flag on a 24-hour basis. The flags must conform to the legal standards, and cannot be soiled or damaged in any way.<ref name="flaglaw"/>

For mourning activities, the flag can be flown in either of the following ways. The first method, commonly known as [[half-staff]]ing, is performed when the flag is hoisted to the top of the flagpole, then lowered to the pole's one-third position. The other method is to attach a black ribbon to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. The ribbon itself is ten [[centimeter]]s wide and it is attached to the mast so that the ends of the ribbon reach the bottom of the flag. During the [[funeral]] ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers, signatories of the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania]], and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before internment.<ref name="flaglaw"/>

When flying the Lithuanian flag with other flags, the following is the correct order of precedence: The national flag, the historical (state) flag, flags of foreign states, the flag of the [[European Union]], international [[NGO]]s, the presidential standard, military and government standards, county flags, city flags and any others. When foreign flags are used alongside the Lithuanian flag, the flags are sorted according to their countries' names in the [[Lithuanian language]]. The only exception is when the congress or meeting held in Lithuanian dictates a different language to be used for sorting. The European Union flag has been hoisted since Lithuania became a member of the organization. While not mentioned by name in the law, the flag of [[NATO]] can be used in Lithuania, since it belongs to that organization as well. It is also common to fly the flags of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] during certain occasions, mainly the celebration of independence of the three [[Baltic States]]. The Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the National Flag and Other Flags governs the rules, use, protocol and manufacturing of the national and other flags used inside the country.<ref name="flaglaw"/>

=== National flag days ===
As part of the flag protocol, the daily display of the Lithuanian flag is encouraged, but is strongly encouraged or legally required on the following days:<ref name="dayslt"> {{lt icon}}  [http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=279613 Seimas of Lithuania - Flag Days of Lithuania].

== Other Lithuanian flags ==
[[Image:Naval_Ensign_of_Lithuania.svg|thumb|250px|Naval ensign]]
A [[naval ensign]] has been used by Lithuania starting in 1992. The ensign has a white background charged with a blue cross, with the national flag in the canton. The width of each cross is 1/7 of the total width of the ensign, with the ratio being 1:2.<ref>{{en icon}} [[Flags of the World]]. [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/lt-nav.html Lithuania - Naval Flags].

Retrieved Dec. 13 2006.</ref> A naval jack and a masthead pennant have been adopted by the Lithuanian navy to use on their ships.

The [[President of Lithuania]] was officially given a standard by the [[Seimas]] in 1993. The standard is the State Emblem of Lithuania charged in the center on a single-color background. Under  state law, the background color is stated as purple, but the color used in practice is dark-red. The ratio of the standard is 1:1.2.<ref>{{en icon}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter2/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=101704 REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA LAW ON THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT - No. I-56].

Each county of Lithuania has adopted a flag, each of them conforming to a pattern: a blue rectangle with ten instances of the Cross of [[Vytis]] appearing in gold, acts as a fringe to the central feature of the flag, which is chosen by the county itself. Most of the central designs were adapted from the counties' coat of arms.<ref>{{en icon}} [http://www.vexilla-mundi.com/lithuania.htm Vexillology of Lithuania]. Vexilla Mundi.
