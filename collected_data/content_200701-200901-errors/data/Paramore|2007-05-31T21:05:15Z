'''Paramore''' is a [[Fueled By Ramen]] band from [[Franklin, Tennessee]].

== History ==
The Franklin, Tennessee-based band Paramore was formed by three members: brothers Zac and Josh Farro, and Hayley Willams. At the age of 13, Williams moved from her hometown of Meridian, Mississippi to the Nashville suburb, where she met the brothers. In the next few years, Paramore would begin to perform at venues outside the greater Nashville area, including the concert festivals [[Purple Door]] and [[Warped Tour]]. In April 2005, after being seen only once by a record executive for the music label [[Fueled by Ramen]], the band was offered a contract to produce a major market CD. 

Paramore's first United States headlining tour kicked off on [[August 2]], [[2006]], leading them across the country and ending with a hometown show in Nashville, Tennessee. They also toured the United Kingdom from [[October 5]], [[2006]] to [[October 15]], [[2006]], where they ended in London at The [[Mean Fiddler]].

Paramore covered [[Foo Fighters]]' "My Hero" for the ''[[Sound of Superman]]'' soundtrack, and Williams' voice has been featured on two tracks by other bands: "Keep Dreaming Upside Down" by [[October Fall]], as well as "Then Came To Kill" by [[The Chariot]].

Paramore recorded their second album, [[RIOT!]], from December 2006 to March 2007. The band will be co-headlining Warped Tour 2007 and have a headlining tour in April with [[This Providence]], [[The Almost]], and [[Love Arcade]].  They have stated that they will play about 3 new songs and confirmed the song "Hallelujah" will be on the new record. RIOT! will be released [[June 12]], [[2007]].

On March 12, 2007, Paramore announced through a [[LiveJournal]] update that Hunter Lamb had left the band to be with his fiancée. He will be replaced by Taylor York, a close friend, to help them with their Warped tour.
