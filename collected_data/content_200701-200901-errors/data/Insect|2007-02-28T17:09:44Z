'''Insects''' ([[Class (biology)|Class]] '''Insecta''') are a major group of [[arthropod]]s and the most diverse group of [[animal]]s on the Earth, with over a million described [[species]] — more than all other animal groups combined&nbsp;<ref name="Chapman">{{cite book |author=Chapman, A.

==Roles in the environment and human society==
[[Image:Aedes aegypti biting human.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Aedes aegypti]]'', a parasite, and vector of [[dengue fever]] and [[yellow fever]]]]
Many insects are considered pests by humans. Insects commonly regarded as pests include those that are parasitic ([[mosquito]]es, [[lice]], [[bedbug]]s), transmit diseases ([[mosquito]]s, [[fly|flies]]), damage structures ([[termite]]s), or destroy agricultural goods ([[locust]]s, [[weevil]]s). Many [[entomologist]]s are involved in various forms of [[pest (animal)|pest]] control, often using [[insecticides]], but more and more relying on methods of [[Biological pest control|biocontrol]].

Although pest insects attract the most attention, many insects are beneficial to the [[natural environment|environment]] and to [[human]]s. Some [[pollination|pollinate]] [[flowering plant]]s (for example [[wasp]]s, [[bee]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]], [[ant]]s). Pollination is a trade between plants that need to reproduce, and pollinators that receive rewards of [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] and [[pollen]]. A serious environmental problem today is the [[pollinator decline|decline of populations of pollinator]] insects, and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for [[pollination management]] in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field, [[orchard]] or [[greenhouse]] at [[bloom]] time.

Insects also produce useful substances such as [[honey]], [[wax]], [[lacquer]] and [[silk]]. [[Honey bee]]s have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey, although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for [[beekeeper]]s. The [[silkworm]] has greatly affected human history, as [[Silk Road|silk-driven trade]] established relationships between China and the rest of the world. [[Fly]] larvae ([[maggot]]s) were formerly used to [[Maggot therapy|treat wounds]] to prevent or stop [[gangrene]], as they would only consume dead flesh. This treatment is finding modern usage in some hospitals. Adult insects such as crickets, and insect larvae of various kinds are also commonly used as fishing bait.
[[Image:Chorthippus biguttulus f 8835.jpg|thumb|180px|left|''Chorthippus biguttatus'', a grasshopper]]
In some parts of the world, insects are used for human food ("[[Entomophagy]]"), while being a [[taboo]] in other places. There are proponents of developing this use to provide a major source of [[protein]] in human [[nutrition]]. Since it is impossible to entirely eliminate pest insects from the human food chain, insects already are present in many foods, especially grains. Most people do not realize that [[food laws]] in many countries do not prohibit insect parts in food, but rather limit the quantity. According to [[cultural materialism|cultural materialist]] anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have protein sources that require less work, like farm birds or cattle.

Many insects, especially [[beetle]]s, are [[scavenger]]s, feeding on dead animals and fallen trees, [[recycling]] the biological materials into forms found useful by other [[organism]]s, and insects are responsible for much of the process by which [[topsoil]] is created. The [[ancient Egyptian religion]] adored beetles and represented them as [[scarabeum]]s.

Although mostly unnoticed by most humans, the most useful of all insects are [[insectivore]]s, those that feed on other insects. Many insects, such as [[grasshopper]]s, can potentially reproduce so quickly that they could literally bury the earth in a single season. However, there are hundreds of other insect species that feed on grasshopper eggs, and some that feed on grasshopper adults. This role in ecology is usually assumed to be primarily one of [[bird]]s, but insects, though less glamorous, are much more significant. For any pest insect one can name, there is a species of wasp that is either a [[parasitoid]] or [[predator]] upon that pest, and plays a significant role in controlling it. 

Human attempts to control pests by insecticides can backfire, because important but unrecognized insects already helping to control pest populations are also killed by the poison, leading eventually to population explosions of the pest species.

Insects possess segmented bodies supported by an [[exoskeleton]], a hard outer covering made mostly of [[chitin]]. The body is divided into a head, a [[thorax]], and an [[abdomen]]. The head supports a pair of sensory [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], a pair of [[compound eye]]s, and mouth parts. The thorax has [[6 (number)|six]] [[arthropod leg|legs]] (one pair per segment) and [[Insect wing|wings]] (if present in the species). The abdomen (made up of eleven segments some of which may be reduced or fused) has [[Respiration|respiratory]], [[Excretion|excretory]] and reproductive structures.

===Nervous system===
Their [[insect nervous system|nervous system]] can be divided into a brain and a [[ventral nerve cord]]. The head capsule (made up of six fused segments) has six pairs of [[ganglion|ganglia]]. The first three pairs are fused into the brain, while the three following pairs are fused into a structure called the [[subesophageal ganglion]]. 

The thoracic segments have one ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also seen in the abdomen but only in the first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction. Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the abdomen, whereas the wasp ''[[Vespa crabro]]'' has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen. And some like the house fly ''[[Musca domestica]]'' have fused all the body ganglia into a single large thoracic ganglion.

===Exoskeleton===
Most insects have two pairs of [[Insect wing|wings]] located on the second and third thoracic segments. Insects are the only invertebrates to have developed [[Insect flight|flight]], and this has played an important part in their success. The winged insects, and their wingless relatives, make up the subclass [[Pterygota]]. [[Insect flight]] is not very well understood, relying heavily on turbulent aerodynamic effects.  The primitive insect groups use muscles that act directly on the wing structure. The more advanced groups making up the [[Neoptera]] have foldable wings and their muscles act on the thorax wall and power the wings indirectly. These muscles are able to contract without nerve impulses allowing them to beat faster (''see [[insect flight]]'').

Their outer skeleton, the cuticle, is made up of two layers; the [[epicuticle]] which is a thin and waxy water resistant outer layer and contains no chitin, and another layer under it called the [[procuticle]]. This is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers. The outer being the exocuticle while the inner is the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each others in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is [[sclerotization|sclerotized]].

===Internal anatomy===
Insects have a complete digestive system. Their digestive system consists basically of a tube that runs from mouth to anus, contrasting with the incomplete digestive systems found in many simpler invertebrates. The excretory system consists of [[Malpighian tubule]]s for the removal of nitrogenous wastes and the hindgut for [[osmoregulation]]. At the end of the hindgut, insects are able to reabsorb water along with potassium and sodium ions. Therefore, insects don't usually excrete water with their feces, allowing storage of water in the body. This process of reabsorption enables them to withstand hot, dry environments.

Insects use [[trachea]]l respiration with openings on the sides of the thorax and abdomen called [[spiracle]]s leading to the tubular tracheal system. Air reaches internal tissues via a network of branches from the tracheal system. There is usually one pair of spiracles per segment. There can be up to 8 abdominal segments with spiracles and upto 2 thoracic segments (restricted to the mesothorax and metathorax). Some groups have reduced numbers of spiracles with the hoverflies having none on their abdomen. There is a physical limit to the pressure that the walls of the tracheal tubes can withstand without collapsing, even though they are stiffened by bands of chitin, and this is one of the reasons why insects are relatively small. The spiracles have muscle controlled valves, enabling the insects to avoid drowning in water or to prevent desiccation. The spiracles often have hairs that help filter the air entering them. 

Some insect groups such as the [[Chironomidae]] or "blood worms" have true respiratory pigments such as [[hemoglobin]] in their blood during their larval stage. Here the trachea are often reduced as their body can absorb oxygen directly from the water, allowing them to live in bottom mud where the oxygen levels are low. 

In certain types of [[water bug]]s the three pairs of the spiracles are covered by a pressure-sensitive membrane that help them sense their position in water. The last abdominal spiracle and associated trachea of certain Lepidopteran caterpillars are modified into a ''tracheal lung'' adapted for hemocyte gas exchange. Short [[tracheole]]s from this trachea ends in knots within the tracheole cell basement membrane. Since they do not supply any cellular tissue, it seems most likely that they are supplying the hemocytes with oxygen.

The [[Madagascar hissing cockroach]] uses certain spiracles to forcibly expel air to create a loud hissing sound when threatened.

A diffuse tissue called a fat body is found in the abdominal haemocoel of some insects. This is believed to help in energy storage and metabolic processes and acts like a liver for the insects.

The [[circulatory system]] of insects, like that of other arthropods, is open: the heart, which is little more than a perforated muscular tube along the dorsal midline, pumps the [[hemolymph]] to open spaces surrounding the internal organs; when the heart relaxes, the hemolymph seeps back into the heart.

Like some other invertebrates, insects cannot synthesise cholesterol and must receive it from the diet. With very few exceptions, they also require long-chain fatty acids in their diet. Lack of these fatty acids affects their development leading to delayed maturity or deformations.

==Development==
[[Image:Hoverflies mating midair.jpg|thumb|240px|Hoverflies mating in flight]]
Most insects hatch from [[egg (biology)|eggs]], but others are [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] or [[viviparous]], and all undergo a series of [[ecdysis|moults]] as they develop and grow in size. This manner of growth is necessitated by the inelastic exoskeleton. Moulting is a process by which the individual escapes the confines of the exoskeleton in order to increase in size, then grows a new and larger outer covering. In some insects, the young are called '''nymphs''' and are similar in form to the adults except that the wings are not developed until the adult stage. This is called ''incomplete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]'' and insects showing this are termed as ''[[Hemimetabolism|Hemimetabolous]]''. ''[[Holometabolism|Holometabolous]]'' insects show ''Complete metamorphosis'', which distinguishes the [[Endopterygota]] and includes many of the most successful insect groups. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a '''[[larva]]''', which is generally worm-like in form, and can be divided into five different forms; eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grublike), campodeiform (elongated, flattened, and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) and vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a '''[[pupa]]''', a stage sealed within a [[pupa|cocoon]] in some species. There are three types of pupae; obtect (the pupa is compact with the legs and other appendages enclosed), exarate (where the pupa has the legs and other appendages free and extended) and coarctate (where the pupa develops inside the larval skin). In the pupal stage, the insect undergoes considerable change in form to emerge as an adult, or '''[[imago]]'''.  Butterflies are an example of an insect that undergoes complete metamorphosis. Some insects have even evolved [[hypermetamorphosis]].

Some insects (parastic wasps) show [[polyembryony]] where a single fertilized egg can divide into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Other developmental and reproductive variations include [[haplodiploidy]], [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]], [[paedomorphosis]] (metathetely and prothetely), [[sexual dimorphism]], [[parthenogenesis]] and more rarely [[hermaphroditism]].

==Behavior==
[[Image:Flies around 60 watt light globe.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Flies attracted to an incandescent light bulb]]
Many insects possess very sensitive and/or specialized organs of [[sense|perception]]. Some insects such as bees can perceive [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths, or detect [[polarized light]], while the [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] of male moths can detect the [[pheromone]]s of female moths over distances of many kilometers. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice-versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound, and it is by no means universal; the general pattern, however, is that if an insect can produce sound, then it can also hear sound, though the range of frequencies they can hear is often quite narrow (and may in fact be limited to only the frequency that they themselves produce). Some nocturnal moths can perceive the [[ultrasonic]] emissions of [[bat]]s, a mechanism which helps them avoid predation. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey/hosts. Bloodsucking insects have special sensory structures that can detect [[infrared]] emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.

Most insects lead short lives as adults, and rarely interact with one another except to mate, or compete for mates. A small number exhibit some form of [[parental care]], where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possible even actively feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either of which may be simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food. This sort of care is typical of bees and various types of wasps.

A few such insects also have a well-developed number sense, among the solitary wasps that provision with a single species of prey. The mother wasp lays her eggs in individual cells and provides each egg with a number of live caterpillars on which the young feed when hatched. Some species of wasp always provide five, others twelve, and others as high as twenty-four caterpillars per cell. The number of caterpillars is different among species, but it is always the same for each sex of larvae. The male solitary wasp in the genus ''[[Eumenes (genus)|Eumenes]]'' is smaller than the female, so the mother of one species supplies him with only five caterpillars; the larger female receives ten caterpillars in her cell. She can in other words distinguish between both the numbers five and ten in the caterpillars she is providing and which cell contains a male or a female.

===Sociality===
[[Image:Termite Cathedral DSC03570.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A termite mound made by the cathedral termite]]
[[Social insect]]s, such as the [[termite]]s, [[ant]]s and many [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s, are the most familiar species of [[Eusociality|eusocial]] animal. They live together in large well-organized colonies that may be so tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered [[superorganism]]s. It is sometimes argued that the various species of [[honey bee]] are the only invertebrates (and indeed one of the only non-human groups) to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication (i.e., where a behavior is used to ''represent'' and convey specific information about something in the environment), called the "[[Bee learning and communication|dance language]]" - the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun, and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown.

Only those insects which live in nests or colonies demonstrate any true capacity for fine-scale spatial orientation or "homing" - this can be quite sophisticated, however, and allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among a mass of thousands of apparently identical holes all clustered together, after a trip of up to several kilometers' distance, and (in cases where an insect [[hibernation|hibernates]]) as long as a year after last viewing the area (a phenomenon known as [[philopatry]]). A few insects [[migration|migrate]], but this is a larger-scale form of [[navigation]], and often involves only large, general regions (e.g., the overwintering areas of the [[Monarch butterfly]]).

===Light production and vision===
A few insects, notably the beetles of the family [[Lampyridae]] have evolved light generating organs. They are also able to control this light generation to produce flashes and some species use the light to attract mates. 

Most insects except some species of cave dwelling crickets are able to perceive light and dark. Many species have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements. The eyes include simple eyes or ocelli as well as compound eyes of varying sizes. Many species are able to detect light in the infrared, ultraviolet as well as the visible light wavelengths. Colour vision has been demonstrated in many species.

===Sound production and hearing===
Insects were the earliest organisms to produce sounds and to sense them. Soundmaking in insects is achieved mostly by mechanical action of appendages. In the [[grasshoppers]] and crickets this is achieved by [[stridulation]]. The [[cicada]]s have the loudest sounds among the insects and have special modifications to their body and musculature to produce and amplify sounds. Some species such as the African cicada, ''Brevisana brevis'' have been measured at 106.7 decibels at a distance of 50 cm.<ref name="walker"/> Some insects can hear ultrasound and take evasive action when they sense detection by bats. Some moths produce clicks and these were earlier thought to have a role in jamming the bat echolocation. However studies suggest that these are produced mostly by unpalatable moths to warn the bats, just as [[Aposematism|warning colouration]] is used visually.<ref>Hristov, N.I., Conner, W.E. (2005) Sound strategy: acoustic aposematism in the bat–tiger moth arms race. Naturwissenschaften 92:164–169. DOI:10.1007/s00114-005-0611-7</ref>

Very low sounds are also produced in various species of [[lepidoptera]], [[coleoptera]] and [[hymenoptera]], mostly through the use of wing movement or friction at the joints of appendages. 

Most soundmaking insects also have tympanal organs that can perceive airborne sounds. Most insects are also able to sense vibrations transmitted by the substrate.

===Chemical communication===
In addition to the use of sound for communication, a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication. These chemicals, termed [[semiochemical]]s, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species, others are used for communication across species. The use of scents is especially well known developed in the social insects.

==Locomotion==
===Flight===
{{main|insect flight}}
Insects are the only group of invertebrates to have developed flight. The evolution of insect wings has been the subject of debate. Some proponents suggest that the wings are para-notal in origin while others have suggested that these are modified gills. In the Carboniferous age, some of the ''Meganeura'' dragonflies had as much as a 50cms wide wingspan. The largest flying insects today are much smaller and include several moth species such as the [[Atlas moth]] and the White Witch (''[[Thysania agrippina]]'').

Insect flight has been a topic of great interest in [[aerodynamics]] due partly to the inability of steady-state theories to explain the lift generated by the tiny wings of insects.

===Walking===
[[Image:Ladybird-animation.gif|left|Ladybird animation showing tripedal gait]] Many adult insects use six legs for walking and have adopted a [[tripedal gait]]. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking whilst always having a stable stance and has been studied extensively in [[Cockroach|cockroaches]]. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, whilst the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on.

The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at speed and is illustrated in the gif animation of a 7-spot ladybird ([[Coccinellidae]], ''[[Coccinella septempunctata]]''). However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits; for example, when moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs. 

[[Cockroach|Cockroaches]] are amongst the fastest insect runners and at full speed actually adopt a bipedal run to reach a high velocity in proportion to their body size. As [[Cockroach|Cockroaches]] move extremely rapidly, they need recording at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is also studied by scientists in stick insects [[Phasmatodea]].

A few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water, especially the bugs of the family, [[Water strider|Gerridae]], also known as water striders. A few species in the genus ''[[Halobates]]'' even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species. 

Insect walking is of particular interest as an alternative form of locomotion to the use of wheels for robots ([[Robot locomotion]]).
===Swimming===
[[Image:Notonecta glauca01.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The backswimmer ''[[Notonecta glauca]]'' underwater, showing the paddle like hindleg adaptation]]
A large number of insects live either a part or their whole lives underwater. In many orders the immature stages are spent in water while the adults are either aerial or terrestrial in habit. A few species spend a part of their adult life either under or over water.
Many of these species have adaptations to help in locomotion under water. The water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle like structures. Some [[Neuroptera]]n larvae, such as dragonfly naiads, propel themselves rapidly by expelling water forcibly out of the rectal chamber.

==Evolution==
[[Image:Insect antennae.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Evolution has produced astonishing variety in insects. Pictured are some of the possible shapes of [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].]]
{{Main|Insect evolution}}
The relationships of insects to other animal groups remain unclear. Although more traditionally grouped with millipedes and centipedes, evidence has emerged favoring closer [[evolution]]ary ties with the crustaceans. In the [[Pancrustacea]] theory insects, together with [[Remipedia]] and [[Malacostraca]], make up a natural [[clade]].

Apart from some tantalizing [[Devonian]] fragments, insects first appear suddenly in the fossil record at the very beginning of the Late [[Carboniferous]] period, Early [[Bashkirian|Bashkirian age]], about 350 million years ago. Insect species were already diverse and highly specialized by this time, with fossil evidence reflecting the presence of more than half a dozen different orders. Thus, the first insects probably emerged earlier in the Carboniferous period, or even in the preceding Devonian. The oldest insect traces are found in amber from Lebanon representing the Lower Cretaceous (120 mya). Research to discover these earliest insect ancestors in the fossil record continues.

The origins of [[insect flight]] remain obscure, since the earliest winged insects currently known appear to have been capable fliers. Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax, for a total of three pairs. So far, there is nothing that suggests that the insects were a particularly successful group of animals before they got their wings.

[[Pennsylvanian|Late Carboniferous]] and [[Cisuralian|Early Permian]] insect orders include both several current very long-lived groups and a number of Paleozoic forms. During this era, some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of 55 to 70&nbsp;cm, making them far larger than any living insect. Also their nymphs must have had a very impressive size. This gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today. The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor.

Most extant orders of insects developed during the [[Permian]] era that began around 270 million years ago. Many of the early groups became extinct during the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]], the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth, around 252 million years ago.

The remarkably successful Hymenopterans appeared in the [[Cretaceous]] but achieved their diversity more recently, in the [[Cenozoic]]. A number of highly-successful insect groups evolved in conjunction with [[flowering plants]], a powerful illustration of [[co-evolution]]. 

Many modern insect genera developed during the [[Cenozoic]]; insects from this period on are often found preserved in [[amber]], often in perfect condition. Such specimens are easily compared with modern species. The study of fossilized insects is called [[paleoentomology]].
==Coevolution==
:{{main|Coevolution}}
Insects were the first group of herbivores and they acted as major selection agents on plants. Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects in turn evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins. Many insects make use of these toxins to protect themselves from their predators. And such insects advertise their toxicity using warning colours. This successful evolutionary pattern has also been utilized by [[mimic]]s. Over time, this has led to complex groups of [[coevolution|co-evolved]] species.

==Taxonomy==
[[Image:Aust blue dragonfly02.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[Orthetrum caledonicum]]'', the Blue Skimmer dragonfly]]
This is a list of the [[Order (biology)|orders]] and higher taxa of insects. 

Within the [[subphylum]] [[Hexapoda]], a few groups such as springtails ([[Collembola]]), are often treated as insects; however some authors treat them as distinct from the insects in having a different evolutionary origin. This may also be the case for the rest of the members of the [[Entognatha]]; [[Protura]] and [[Diplura]]. 

The true insects, those of the Class Insecta, are distinguished from all other arthropods in part by having '''ectognathous''', or exposed, mouthparts and eleven abdominal segments. The true insects are therefore sometimes also referred to as the ''Ectognatha''. Many insect groups are [[insect wing|winged]] as adults. The exopterygote part of the [[Neoptera]] are sometimes divided into Orthopteroida (cerci present) and Hemipteroida (cerci absent), also called lower and higher Exopterygota; a full classification is given below.

As seen above, insects are divided into two subclasses; Apterygota and Pterygota (flying insects), but this could relatively soon change. Apterygota is made up of two orders; Archaeognatha (bristletails) and Thysanura (silverfish). In the suggested classification, the Archaeognatha makes up the Monocondylia while Thysanura and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. It is even possible that the Thysanura itself are not [[monophyletic]], making the family Lepidotrichidae a [[sister group]] to the Dicondylia (Pterygota + the rest of the Thysanura). 

Also within the infraclass Neoptera we will probably see some re-organization in not too long. Today Neoptera is divided into the superorders Exopterygota and Endopterygota. But even if the Endopterygota are monophyletic, the Exopterygota seems to be [[paraphyletic]], and can be separated into smaller groups; Paraneoptera, Dictyoptera, Orthopteroidea and to other groups (Grylloblattodea + Mantophasmatodea and Plecoptera +
Zoraptera + Dermaptera). Phasmatodea and Embioptera has been suggested to form Eukinolabia, while Strepsiptera and Diptera are sometimes grouped together in Halteria. Paraneoptera has turned out to be more closeley related to Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota. It is not still clear how closley related the remaining Exopterygote groups are and if they belongs together in a larger unit. Only more research will give the answer.

==Relationship to other arthropods==
[[Image:Wolf spider focus bracket02.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Spiders such as this [[wolf spider]] are not insects]]
Other terrestrial arthropods, such as [[centipede]]s, [[millipede]]s, [[scorpion]]s and [[spider]]s, are sometimes confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar, sharing (as do all arthropods) a jointed exoskeleton. However upon closer examination their features differ significantly; most noticeably they do not have the six legs characteristic of adult insects.

The higher level phylogeny of the arthropods continues to be a matter of debate and research. A proposed [[phylogenetic]] tree of the arthropods and related groups is given in the tree below. This tree does not take into consideration many extinct groups.<ref>Tree of Life Web Project. 1995. Arthropoda. Version 01 January 1995 (temporary).

==Quotes==
*"''Something in the insect seems to be alien to the habits, morals, and psychology of this world, as if it had come from some other planet: more monstrous, more energetic, more insensate, more atrocious, more infernal than our own.''"
::&mdash;[[Maurice Maeterlinck]] ([[1862]]–[[1949]])

*When asked what can be learned about the Creator by examining His work, [[J.B.S. Haldane]] said "''an inordinate fondness for beetles''."

*"''To understand the success of insects is to appreciate our own shortcomings''" &mdash;[[Thomas Eisner]]
