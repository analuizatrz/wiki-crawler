===Mount Everest===
At 7 a.m. on [[May 19]], [[2006]], Danenberg reached the top of Mount Everest. Withstanding bad weather during the night that delayed some other climbers in her party, Pa Nuru Sherpa and his brother Mingma Tshiring were the only climbers to witness the event. At the time, Danenberg was suffering from [[bronchitis]], a stuffed nose, [[frostbite]] on her cheeks, and a clogged oxygen mask. 

Since 1953, approximately 2,500 people have reached the summit. The first person of African descent to have done so was [[South Africa]]n [[Sibusiso Vilane]] in 2003.
