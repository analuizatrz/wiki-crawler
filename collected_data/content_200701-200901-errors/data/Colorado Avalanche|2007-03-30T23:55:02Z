The '''Colorado Avalanche''' are a professional [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Denver, Colorado]] [[United States]]. They are members of the [[Northwest Division (NHL)|Northwest Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The Avalanche have won the [[Stanley Cup]] two times, in 1996 and 2001. The franchise was founded in [[Quebec]] and were the [[Quebec Nordiques]] until moving to [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1995. The Avalanche have won 8 division titles and have gone to playoffs in all their 10 seasons in the NHL.<ref>{{cite web |title =Colorado Avalanche History|url =http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/teams/history/COL|publisher =CBS Sportsline|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> The Avalanche is also notable for being the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup their first season after a re-location.

Since their move to Denver, the Avalanche have played their home games at the [[Pepsi Center]]. The Avalanche has a notable rivalry with the [[Detroit Red Wings]] due to both teams having met each other five times in seven years in the Western Conference playoffs between 1996 and 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title =Welcome to NHL's nastiest rivalry|url =http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=RM&p_theme=rm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB4E6E5FAB223F2&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|author =Kravitz, Bob|publisher =Rocky Mountain News|date =1996-12-18|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

==Franchise history==
===Quebec Nordiques (1972-1995)===
{{see also|Quebec Nordiques}}
The Quebec Nordiques were one of the [[World Hockey Association]]'s original teams when the league began play in [[1972-73 WHA season|1972]]. Though first awarded to a group in [[San Francisco]], the team quickly moved to [[Quebec City]] when the [[California]] deal soured due to financial and arena problems.<ref name="whanordiques">{{cite web |title =Quebec Nordiques|url =http://www.whahockey.com/nordiques.html|publisher =WHA Hockey|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> During their seven WHA seasons, the Nordiques won the [[Avco World Trophy]] once, in [[1976-77 WHA season|1977]] and lost the finals once, in [[1974-75 WHA season|1975]].<ref>{{cite web |title =WHA Yearly Standings|url =http://www.whahockey.com/whayearlystandings.html|publisher =WHA Hockey|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> Two years later, in [[1979-80 NHL season|1979]], they entered the NHL, along with the WHA's [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Hartford Whalers]], and [[Winnipeg Jets]].<ref>{{cite web |title =From the WHA to the NHL |url =http://www.nhl.com/history/062279.html|publisher =NHL|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

After making the postseason for seven consecutive years, [[1980-81 NHL season|1981]] to [[1986-87 NHL season|1987]], the Nordiques fell into the league's basement.<ref name="nordiquesrecord">{{cite web |title =Quebec Nordiques Almanac|url =http://www.nordiquespreservation.com/record.html|publisher =Nordiques Preservation|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> In [[1991 NHL Entry Draft|1991]], for the third straight draft, Quebec had the first overall selection.<ref>{{cite web |title =NHL Entry Draft First Round Selections 1980-89|url =http://www.nhl.com/futures/firstround80_89.html#89|publisher =NHL|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title =NHL Entry Draft First Round Selections 1990-99|url =http://www.nhl.com/futures/firstround90_99.html|publisher =NHL|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> Although [[Eric Lindros]], the draft's top-ranked player, had made it clear he did not wish to play for the Nordiques, they drafted him anyway.<ref>{{cite news |title =A look back: 1991|url =http://www.nhl.com/futures/2006draft/lookback_91_053106.html|author =Roarke,Shawn P.|publisher =NHL|date =2006-05-31|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> Lindros did not even wear the jersey for the press photographs, only holding it when it was presented to him.<ref name="lindrosnhl">{{cite news |title =As expected, Quebec selects Lindros No.1|url =http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=DSNB&d_place=DSNB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F360039496DAD62&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|author =|publisher =Associated Press|date =1991-06-23|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> On advice from his mother, Lindros refused to sign a contract and began a holdout that would last over a year.

Quickly, Quebec would become a [[Stanley Cup]] contender. 

While the team experienced on-ice success, off-ice financial failure during the lockout-shortened [[1994-95 NHL season]] forced team owner [[Marcel Aubut]] to ask for a bailout from Quebec's provincial government.<ref>{{cite news |title =Quebec's Government Plans Bailout to keep Nordiques from moving|url =http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&s_site=twincities&p_multi=SP&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB5DDC4964DA9E0&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|author =|publisher =Associated Press|date =1994-04-09|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> The bailout fell through and Aubut subsequently sold the team to a group of investors in [[Denver]].<ref>{{cite news |title =NHL's Nordiques sold, moving west to Denver \ Comsat Entretainment Group bought the team.

===Colorado Avalanche (1995-present)===
[[Image:Patrick_Roy_1999.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Goaltender [[Patrick Roy]], the winningest net minder in the NHL, played for the Avalanche from 1995-2003.]]




Led by [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]] [[Joe Sakic]], Forsberg and [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defensive]] stalwart [[Adam Foote]], Colorado entered their first season in Denver with a strong lineup. The goaltender [[Patrick Roy]] joined the team after an incident while playing for the [[Montreal Canadiens]] against the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. Roy was left in the net after having suffered 9 goals in 26 shots in a game that would end 11-1. Roy felt humiliated and told team president [[Ronald Corey]] it was his last game for the Canadiens. Four days later, he joined the Avalanche with [[Mike Keane]]. [[Jocelyn Thibault]], [[Martin Rucinsky]] and [[Andrei Kovalenko]] were sent to Montreal.<ref>{{cite news |title =Roy gets call he's in Hall|url =http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/nhl/article/0,2777,DRMN_23920_4810040,00.html|author =Sadowski, Rick|publisher =Rocky Mountain News|date =2006-06-29|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> In the [[1995-96 NHL season|1996 playoffs]], after beating the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in a six-game series in the Western Conference Final, the Avalanche would roll to the [[Stanley Cup]] Final to meet the [[Florida Panthers]].

In [[1996-97 NHL season|1996-97]], Colorado lost in the Western Conference Finals in a rematch against the Red Wings, despite having won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] for best regular-season record. After losing in the Conference Quarterfinals in [[1997-98 NHL season|1997-98]] against the [[Edmonton Oilers]], the Avalanche lost two more Western Conference Finals the following two years, both times against the [[Dallas Stars]].

In March 6, [[1999-2000 NHL season|2000]], the [[Boston Bruins]] traded future [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]r defenseman [[Ray Bourque]] and [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]] [[Dave Andreychuk]] to Colorado for [[Brian Rolston]], [[Martin Grenier]], [[Samuel Pahlsson]], and a first-round draft pick. Bourque, who had been a Bruin since [[1979-80 NHL season|1979-80]], requested a trade to a contender for one last shot at a Stanley Cup.<ref name="bourque">{{cite news |title =For Bourque, at long last Stanley!|url =http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=290833|author =Roarke, Shawn P.|publisher =[[National Hockey League|NHL]]|date =2007-03-22|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

After failing to do so in 2000, for the [[2000-01 NHL season|2000-01 season]] the Avalanche strengthen their defense for a run at the Stanley Cup. On February 21, 2001, they acquired star defenseman [[Rob Blake]] and defensive center [[Steven Reinprecht]] from the [[Los Angeles Kings]] for [[Adam Deadmarsh]], [[Aaron Miller]] and their first-round [[2001 NHL Entry Draft|2001 Draft]] pick.<ref>{{cite news |title =Kings take Avs' Aulin to complete Blake trade|url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-72313179.html|author =Sadowski, Rick|publisher =Rocky Mountain News|date =2001-03-23|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> Colorado won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] again, with a 52-16-10-4, 118-point record.

The Devils had taken a 3-2 advantage in the series onto home ice for game six, but Colorado won 4-0 in New Jersey and then 3-1 at Denver to claim the Cup. After being handed the Cup from [[NHL Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]], the captain Joe Sakic immediately gave it to Ray Bourque, capping off his 22-year career with his only championship.<ref>{{cite news |title =Avalanche beat Devils to capture Stanley Cup|url =http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup01/games/2001-06-09-njcol.htm|author =Allen, Kevin|publisher =USA Today|date =2001-06-10|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

The Avalanche never reached the Stanley Cup finals again since 2001. In [[2001-02 NHL season|2002]], they lost to the Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Finals in a 7-game series. In [[2002-03 NHL Season|2003]], the Avalanche blew a 3-1 lead over the [[Minnesota Wild]] in the first round of the playoffs, losing in overtime of game 7.<ref>{{cite news |title = Minnesota 3, Colorado 2|url =http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/recaps/2003/04/21/min_col/|author =|publisher =Sports Illustrated|date =2003-04-22|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

On [[March 8]], [[2004]], during a game between the Colorado Avalanche and the [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[Steve Moore]] was punched from behind by [[Todd Bertuzzi]], who knocked him to the ground and left him unconscious.

After the [[2004-05 NHL lockout]] and the implementation of a salary cap, the Avalanche had to let go some of their top players.

By the beginning of the [[2006-07 NHL season|2006-07 season]] Joe Sakic and [[Milan Hejduk]] were the only two remaining members since the 2001 Stanley Cup winning team. Joe Sakic is the only player left from the team's days in Quebec (though Hejduk was drafted by the Nordiques), but prospect [[Paul Stastny]], son of Nordiques legend [[Peter Stastny]], also provides a link to the past.

After a record 487 consecutive games, the NHL's longest consecutive attendance sellout ended with the Avalanche on [[October 16]], [[2006]] after a reported attendance of 17,681 which was 326 under capacity at the [[Pepsi Center]] before an Avalanche-[[Chicago Blackhawks]] game, which the [[Hawk]]s ultimately won 5-4. The streak began on [[November 9]], [[1995]], the Avalanche's eighth [[regular season]] home game during the [[1995-96 NHL season]], before a sellout of 16,061 at the [[McNichols Sports Arena]] versus the [[Dallas Stars]].<ref>{{cite news |title =Avs see sellout streak get away|url =http://www.denverpost.com/avalanche/ci_4503924|author =Frei, Terry|publisher =Denver Post|date =2006-10-17|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref> The Avalanche recorded their 500th home sellout in their 515th game at Denver on [[January 20]] [[2007]], against the [[Detroit Red Wings]].<ref>{{cite news |title = Avalanche Reaches 500th Sellout In Denver |url =http://www.coloradoavalanche.com/News/NewsDetails.aspx?NID=780|author =|publisher =Colorado Avalanche|date =2006-01-20|accessdate =2007-03-25}}</ref>

[[Image:Avalanche200607jerseys.GIF|thumb|350px|right|Avalanche jerseys for the 2006-07 season: Home and away (top) and 3rd jersey (bottom)]]
The Avalanche jerseys have not changed since their first season in 1995. The team colors are burgundy, blue and white. The home jersey, which was the team's road jersey until 2003 when the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] decided to switch home and road jerseys,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statenews.com/article.phtml?pk=15112|title=NHL 'quacked' up with hockey jersey switch|first=Kristofer|last=Karol|publisher=[[State News]]|date=[[January 27]], [[2003]]|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref> is dominantly burgundy and dark blue in color. There are two black and white [[zigzag]] lines along the jersey, one in the shoulders, the other near the belly. Between them, the jersey is burgundy, outside those lines it is dark blue. Similar lines exist around the neck. The Avalanche logo is in the center of the jersey. On top of the shoulders, there is the alternate logo, one on each side. The away jersey is similar, just with different colors. The burgundy part on the home jersey is white on the away jersey, the dark blue part is burgundy and the black and white lines became white and dark blue.

The Avalanche have introduced a third jersey during the 2001-02 season.<ref>{{cite news |title =OILERS 4, AVALANCHE 1 "Third jersey' to make debut on Halloween|url =http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&p_theme=dp&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EF431E783FCBE23&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|author =Dater, Adrian|publisher =Denver Post|date =2001-10-19|accessdate =2007-03-26}}</ref> It is dominantly burgundy.

In the middle of the arms, there are 5 stripes, black, white and burgundy from the outside inside in both sides.

==Rivalry with the Detroit Red Wings== 
In [[1995-96 NHL season|1996]], the Colorado Avalanche met the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the Western Conference Finals and won the series 4-2. Colorado would go on to win the Stanley Cup. During game 6 of those Conference Finals, as Red Wings player [[Kris Draper]] was skating backwards towards the bench, he was checked into the boards by Avalanche player [[Claude Lemieux]].<ref name="bloodfeud">{{cite book  | last =Dater| first = Adrian| title =Blood Feud: Detroit Red Wings vs. Colorado Avalanche| publisher =Taylor Trade Publishing| date =2006| url =http://www.denverpost.com/books/ci_5106839| isbn =1589793196}}</ref> Draper bled a lot but he did not lose consciousness until being taken out of the ice and for a few moments. He had broken bones in the nose, jaw, cheekbone; damages to his right eye socket may had been made and five teeth were bent inward toward the throat.<ref name="bloodfeud"/> He was submitted to reconstructive surgery.<ref name="avsrw10y">{{cite news |title =Happy anniversary to Red Wings, Avalanche|url =http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=neumann/070326|author =Neumann, Thomas|publisher =ESPN|date =2007-03-26|accessdate =2007-03-27}}</ref> After the incident, Lemieux recieved many threats from Red Wings players and fans,  with goalie [[Chris Osgood]] being the first to issue one.<ref name="bloodfeud"/>

In the following season, in the last meeting between the two teams in the regular season, a brawl known as [[Brawl in Hockeytown]] occurred. The gamed ended with 9 fights, 11 goals, 39 penalties, 148 penalty minutes, one hat-trick (by [[Valeri Kamensky]]) and with a goalie fight between Stanley Cup champion goalies [[Patrick Roy]] and [[Mike Vernon]].<ref name="avsrw10y"/> After two fights throught the first period, it was near the end of it that the brawl started. [[Peter Forsberg]] and [[Igor Larionov]] started fighting and then [[Darren McCarty]] hit Claude Lemieux. Patrick Roy came in aid of his teammate and collided against [[Brendan Shanahan]]. Mike Vernon joined the brawl and he had a "legendary scrap" with Roy.<ref name="avsrw10y"/> Four more fights occurred and the Red Wings ended up winning the game in overtime by 6-5.<ref name="avsrw10y"/> Both teams met again in the Conference Finals that season and Red Wings went on to win the Stanley Cup. In the following 5 years, the Avalanche and the Red Wings met 3 times in the playoffs, with Colorado winning the first two and losing the last.

This rivalry is considered one of the top rivalries in the NHL by the press and fans.<ref>{{cite news |title =Part II -- Top rivalries|url =http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/preview2005/news/story?id=2172427|author =|publisher =ESPN|date =2005-10-29|accessdate =2007-03-27}}</ref>

He was traded to Colorado in 2000 so he could have a chance of winning the Stanley Cup before retiring.<ref name="bourque"/> He won his only Stanley Cup in 2001, in the last season of his career, becoming the player who waited the most to win a Stanley Cup. Patrick Roy played from 1995 to 2003 in the Avalanche and won two Stanley Cups. He is the goaltender with more wins in the history of the NHL.

Both Bourque and Roy were inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]. The only other Avalanche player to be inducted is [[Jari Kurri]] who played the last season of his career with the franchise.

[[Joe Sakic]] is the only captain the Avalanche have ever had.<ref>[[Sylvain Lefebvre]] was interim captain in 1997-98</ref> He was in both Avalanche Stanley cup winning teams, played his entire career in the franchise, has six individual NHL trophies and holds the franchise record for goals, assists and points.
