'''Emmett Watson''' ([[November 22]] [[1918]] &ndash; [[May 11]] [[2001]]) was a [[Seattle, Washington]] based [[United States|American]] [[Columnist|newspaper columnist]] whose columns ran in a variety of Seattle newspapers over a span of more than fifty years. Initially a sportswriter, he is primarily famous for writing a social commentary column for the [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] from [[1956]] until [[1982]], when he left the PI and was subsequently hired by [[The Seattle Times]] to write a column there.  

==Biography==

===Early life===

Emmett, along with his twin brother Clement, was born on November 22, 1918, the son of Garfield and Lena McWhirt<ref>http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3274</ref>. Emmett's mother and twin brother died of [[Spanish flu|Spanish Influenza]] the following year and his father, an itinerant laborer unable to care for his son, arranged for Emmett's adoption by John and Elizabeth Watson of West Seattle.

As a child, Watson suffered an ear infection that permanently damaged his hearing. He first attended high school in West Seattle before transfering to Franklin High School, where he played baseball with legendary [[Fred Hutchinson]]. Emmett graduated from Franklin High School in 1937.

He continued his baseball career with the [[University of Washington]] Huskies, and then played very briefly with the [[Seattle Rainiers]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]]. A newsletter that Watson produced and circulated during [[World War II]] to enlisted baseball players prompted the Seattle Star to hire him in 1944. Around this time he contracted [[polio]], which left him with a permanent limp.

===Personal life===

Emmett Watson was married for 28 years to the former Betty Lea. The couple had two daughters, Lea and Nancy. The marriage ended in divorce.

===Early career===

In 1944 the Seattle Star (a daily newspaper, now defunct) hired Watson to cover the Seattle Rainiers. In 1946, The Seattle Times lured him away from the Star. At the Times, Watson continued to cover sports until he was given an offer by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that The Seattle Times chose not to match. It was during this time that Watson, weakened by polio, transitioned from reporter to columnist, a job that required less legwork. In 1956 the paper was pitched the idea of an "Around the Town" column by a group of restaurant owners who offered to partially underwrite the costs of producing the column in exchange for an occasional plug. The column "This our City," with Watson at the helm, began in 1956 and quickly broadened its scope to cover all aspects of life in Seattle. By 1962 the column was running six days a week utilzing the "three dot" format on most days, while including an essay-style column every week or so. It was these essay-style columns that provided most of the fodder for his 1993 book, ''My Life in Print''. 

===Columnist at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer===

In his column, as in his life, Watson was an early champion of civil rights, social reform, and the anti-war movement. He denounced urban renewal plans aimed at flattening [[Pioneer Square, Seattle, Washington|Pioneer Square]] and radically altering Seattle's [[Pike Place Market|Pike Place Public Market]]. He was the founder and leader of  "Lesser Seattle," a parody of Greater Seattle, Inc., which advocated several schemes, ill-advised in Watson's opinion, for Seattle's civic improvement and development. Feeling that the influx of outsiders, primarily from California, was ruining the city, Watson often published tongue-in-cheek columns suggesting ways to make visitors to Seattle feel unwelcome. He also invented a fictional organization called the [[Keep the Bastards Out]] (KBO) that fought against the influx of newcomers to the Puget Sound area from out of state. 

In 1961, Emmett Watson received international notoriety when he broke the story of [[Ernest Hemmingway|Ernest Hemingway's]] suicide, which had been falsely reported by Hemingway's wife as an accidental shooting.

A life-long fan of baseball, Watson, along  U.S. District Judge Bill Dwyer, Watson's longtime friend, were ringleaders in the anti-trust suit against [[Major League Baseball]] when the [[Seattle Pilots]] were moved to Milwaukee after a single season in Seattle in 1969<ref>http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/connelly/23748_watson21.shtml</ref>. It was the effectiveness of this action that proved to be instrumental in Seattle being award a Major League franchise, the [[Seattle Mariners]], in 1977. Watson left the P-I after being treated, in Watson's opinion, unfairly by a new editor. Nevertheless, he, continued to contribute to the paper as a freelancer. Eventually, Watson's criticisms of one-time Mariner's owner [[George Argyros]] led to the P-I reducing the frequency of his column. Watson remembered, "I picked up the paper and saw the column wasn't in there. The managing editor called and said he was thinking of cutting me back to one column a week. I said maybe we should make it zero columns a week."

Within days he was offered a job back at the Seattle Times.

===Columnist at the Seattle Times===

At the Seattle Times Watson continued to write his column in the style that had made him Seattle's best known newspaper columnist. As was his custom, he continued to skewer the rich and powerful in his columns, always fighting against the kind of development and modernization that he felt was destroying the city he knew and loved. Over the years the tone in his columns softened somewhat and they often consisted of his reminisces of "Old Seattle." In November of 2000, when his union, [[The Newspaper Guild]], went on strike against The Seattle Times, Watson, now in his eighties, made regular, daily appearances on the picket lines. During the strike he wrote for the Seattle Union Record<ref>http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/sept01/watson.html</ref>, the strike paper of the [http://www.nwguild.org/ Pacific Northwest Newspaper Guild].

===Accomplishments===

Watson was called "one of the greats" by contemporaries [[Herb Caen]] of the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] and [[Jimmy Breslin]] of the [[New York Daily News]]<ref>http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/sept01/watson.html</ref> and he considered himself of proteg√© of Caen's. He wrote four books (including My Life in Print) and received the Distinguished Service Award from the [[Society of Professional Journalists]]' Western Washington Chapter in 1998.

===Death===

In March of 2001 Emmett Watson underwent surgery for an abdominal aneurysm at [[Virginia Mason Medical Center|Virginia Mason Hospital]] in Seattle. He passed away of complications from the surgery on May 11, 2001.
