'''''Pan's Labyrinth''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] '''''El Laberinto del Fauno'''''; literally ''The Labyrinth of the Faun'') is an [[Academy Award]]-winning Spanish-language [[fantasy film]]<ref name="newtimes">{{cite news |last=Shafer|first=Craig |url=http://www.newtimesslo.com/index.php?p=showarticle&id=2232 | title=Amazing journey: Fantasy both frightening and beautiful lurks in this award-winning labyrinth | publisher=New Times SLO | date=[[2007-01-18]] | accessdate=2007-01-24 }}</ref><ref name="SF">{{cite news |url= http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw14471.html |title=Guillermo del Toro and Ivana Baquero escape from a civil war into the fairytale land of ''Pan's Labyrinth'' |accessdate=2007-01-27| date=[[2006-12-25]] |publisher=[[Science Fiction Weekly]]| last=Spelling|first=Ian}}</ref> written and directed by [[Mexico|Mexican]] film-maker [[Guillermo del Toro]]. Though the original title referred only to the mythological [[faun]], the [[English language|English]] title refers to the faun-like [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. Del Toro has stated, however, that the faun featured in the film is not actually Pan.<ref name="SF"/> It was produced and distributed by the Mexican film company [[Esperanto Films]].

''Pan's Labyrinth'', set in post-[[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] [[Spain]], tells the allegorical story of a girl named Ofelia who is given three tasks by a mysterious faun. Meanwhile, her stepfather, the [[Falange|Falangist]] Captain Vidal, viciously hunts for [[Spanish Maquis|rebels]] in the region, and her pregnant mother grows ill. Heavily influenced by fairy tales and considered a [[spiritual sequel]] to ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'', the film employed make-up, puppetry, and [[computer generated imagery|CGI]] effects to create its [[fantasy]] creatures.

The film premièred at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].  It was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[November 24]] [[2006]]. In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the film was given a limited release on [[December 29]], [[2006]], with a nationwide release on [[January 19]], [[2007]].<ref name="bom">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=panslabyrinth.htm|title=Pan's Labyrinth (2006)|accessdate=2007-02-12  |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>  ''Pan's Labyrinth'' has won numerous international awards, including three [[Academy Awards]], and the 2007 [[Hugo Award]] for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form.

==Plot==
<!-- Read this before editing: 1. This is a synopsis, try to keep it as short as possible. Tiny details do not need to be added to it. 2. The spoiler warning is not supposed to be used in sections that are clearly going to contain spoilers. -->

The movie opens with a [[fairy tale]]. In it, Princess Moanna, whose father is the king of the [[underworld]], becomes curious about the world above. When she goes to the surface, she forgets about her life in the underworld and grows old and dies as a mortal. The king believes that her [[spirit]] will come back to the underworld someday.

The story then cuts to post-[[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] Spain in [[1944]], with [[Francisco Franco]] firmly in power. Ofelia ([[Ivana Baquero]]), a young girl who loves fairy tales, travels with her pregnant mother Carmen ([[Ariadna Gil]]) to meet Captain Vidal ([[Sergi López i Ayats]]), her new stepfather and father of Carmen's unborn child. Vidal, the son of a famed commander who died in [[Morocco]], believes strongly in [[falangism]] and was assigned to root out any [[Spanish Maquis|anti-fascist rebels]].

Ofelia discovers a large insect resembling a [[stick insect]] which she believes to be a [[fairy]]. It follows her to the mill where Vidal is stationed and leads Ofelia into an ancient [[labyrinth]] nearby. Before Ofelia can enter, she is stopped by Mercedes ([[Maribel Verdú]]), Vidal's housekeeper who is spying for the rebels. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom where it changes into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth.  There, she meets the [[faun]] ([[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]]), who believes her to be Princess Moanna.  He gives her three tasks to complete before the [[full moon]] to ensure that her "[[essence]] is intact". Meanwhile, Vidal brutally kills two farmers suspected of being rebels before searching them properly. After looking in their bag it is clear that they were hunting rabbits as they had said and were not rebels.

[[Image:Panslabyrinthofelia.JPG|thumb|left|The [[faun]] gives Ofelia the Book of Crossroads, which explains her tasks.]]Ofelia completes the first task of retrieving a key from the belly of a disgusting giant toad, but she becomes worried about her mother whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a [[Mandrake (plant)|mandrake root]], which instantly begins to cure her mother's illness. 

Accompanied by three fairy guides, Ofelia then completes the second task of retrieving an ornate dagger from the lair of the Pale Man ([[Doug Jones (actor)|Jones]] as well), a gruesome, child-eating monster who sits silently in front of a large feast.  Although she was gravely warned not to consume anything, she eats two grapes, awakening and angering the Pale Man. He eats two of the fairies and chases her, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give her the third task.

Meanwhile, Vidal becomes increasingly vicious, torturing a captured rebel.  Vidal also kills the doctor who [[euthanasia|euthanized]] the tortured prisoner to stop his pain, because he discovered the doctor was helping the rebels. Vidal catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root. Carmen throws it into the fireplace, where it then begins to scream. Instantly, she develops painful contractions and dies giving birth to a son. Vidal discovers that Mercedes is a spy, and he captures her and Ofelia as they attempt to escape. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, and Mercedes is taken to be tortured; however, she frees herself using a hidden knife, badly injures Vidal, and flees into the woods where the rebels rescue her.

The faun returns to Ofelia and gives her one more chance to prove herself. He tells her to take her baby brother into the labyrinth. Ofelia steals the baby after sedating Vidal; although disoriented, Vidal continues to chase her through the labyrinth while the rebels attack the mill. The faun tells Ofelia that the [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] to the underworld will open only with an innocent's blood, so he needs a drop of her brother's blood. Ofelia refuses to harm her brother and the faun disappears. Vidal finds her, takes the baby and shoots Ofelia. 

When he leaves the labyrinth the rebels and Mercedes are waiting for him. Knowing that he will die, he calmly hands Mercedes the baby. He takes out his watch, ready to break it, and tells Mercedes to tell his son when he grows up what time his father died, reflecting his own father's death. Mercedes refuses, telling him that his son will never even know his name. Pedro, one of the rebels and Mercedes' brother, draws his weapon and shoots Vidal in the face, killing him.

As Mercedes enters the labyrinth and mourns over the dying girl, humming her lullaby, drops of Ofelia's blood drips onto the altar which was the gateway into the underworld.  Ofelia is reunited in spirit with the king and queen of the underworld. The Faun is there with his fairy companions flying around him (including the ones previously eaten by the monster). She learns that by giving up the eternal life as the princess to save her baby brother, she has completed the final task and proven herself to be the Princess Moanna.

===Influences===
The idea for ''Pan's Labyrinth'' came from Guillermo del Toro's notebooks, which he says are filled with "doodles, ideas, drawings, and plot bits." He had been keeping these notebooks for twenty years.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.premiere.com/features/3364/del-toros-pans-labyrinth-sketches.html |accessdate=2007-07-20|date=|title=Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth Sketches| publisher=Premiere.com}}</ref> At one point during production, he left the notebook in a taxi and was distraught, but the cabbie returned it to him two days later.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.mrnewsmx.com/fullStory.php?nid=25996 |accessdate=2007-07-20|date=[[November 6]] [[2006]]|title=Almost a horror story|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Horn|first=John}}</ref> Though he originally wrote a story about a pregnant woman who falls in love with a faun,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=film&article=288 |accessdate=2007-07-20 |title=The world of the labyrinth|publisher=Bay Area Reporter|date=[[January 4]] [[2007]]| last=Lamble|first=David}}</ref> Sergi López said that del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that "for two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written.'" López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he's said that "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head." <ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.canmag.com/nw/6255-sergi-lopez-pans-labyrinth-interview |title=Sergi Lopez on ''Pan's Labyrinth'' |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[January 2]] [[2007]]|publisher=CanMag| last=Topel |first=Fred}}</ref>

Del Toro has said the film has strong connections in theme to ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' and should be seen as an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there. Some of the other works he drew on for inspiration include [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''Alice'' books, [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''[[Ficciones]]'', [[Arthur Machen]]'s ''[[The Great God Pan]]'' and ''[[The White People]]'', [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany|Lord Dunsany's]] ''The Blessing of Pan'', [[Algernon Blackwood]]'s ''Pan's Garden'' and [[Francisco Goya]]'s works. In 2004, del Toro said: "Pan is an original story. Some of my favorite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and the symbol of the labyrinth. These are things that I find very compelling (remember the labyrinth image on ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]''?) and I am trying to mix them and play with them."<ref> [http://www.deltorofilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=28#28 Del Toro message board, Answers Archive Wed Nov 24, 2004 1:27 am], repost from elsewhere; Retrieved [[20 August]] [[2007]]</ref> Though del Toro thought ''Pan's Labyrinth'' was "profane," Alejandro González Iñárritu described the film as "truly Catholic." It was also influenced by the illustrations of [[Arthur Rackham]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1949245,00.html |title=Pan's people|accessdate=2007-07-09|publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] Arts}}</ref>

[[Guillermo Navarro]], the director of photography, said that "after doing work in Hollywood on other movies and with other directors, working in our original language in different scenery brings me back to the original reasons I wanted to make movies, which is basically to tell stories with complete freedom and to let the visuals really contribute to the telling of the story."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/January2007/PansLabyrinth/page1.php |title=Fear and Fantasy|accessdate=2007-06-17|date=January 2007|publisher=[[American Cinematographer]]}}</ref>

===Casting===
*'''[[Ivana Baquero]]''' as '''Ofelia'''. Del Toro says he was "scared shitless" in casting the right actress for the lead role, and that finding the 11-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental. "The character I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9 and Ivana came in and she was a little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age."<ref name="DH">{{cite news |url= http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/deltoro.php |title=Exclusive Interview: Guillermo del Toro "Pan's Labyrinth" |accessdate=2007-01-28|date=[[2006-09-26]] |publisher=Dark Horizons |last=Fischer|first=Paul}}</ref> Baquero says that del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairytales to help her "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt". She says she thought the film was "marvelous", and that "At the same time it can bring you pain and sadness and scariness and happiness."<ref name=SF/>
*'''[[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]]''' as '''The Faun''' and '''The Pale Man''': Jones had worked with del Toro before on ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' and ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]'', and says the director sent him an email saying, "You must be in this film. No one else can play this part but you." Jones read an English translation of the script and was enthusiastic but then found out the film was in Spanish, which he did not speak. Jones says he was "terrified" and del Toro suggested learning the script phonetically, or dubbing his lines with a [[voice-over]] actor, but Jones rejected both ideas preferring to learn the words himself. He said, "I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word and I got the pronunciation semi-right before I even went in," using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up on to practice the words.<ref>{{cite news |url =http://www.canmag.com/news/4/3/6216|title=Doug Jones En Espanol |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2006-12-27]] |publisher=CanMag|last=Topel|first=Fred}}</ref> Del Toro decided afterwards that he still preferred to dub Jones with the voice of "an authoritative theatre actor," but Jones's efforts remained valuable because the voice actor was able to easily match his delivery with Jones's mouth movements.<ref>{{cite news |url =http://www.straight.com/node/63731 |title= Labyrinth’s faun unmasked |accessdate=2007-01-28 |date=[[2007-01-11]] |publisher=straight.com |last=Eisner|first=Ken}}</ref>
*'''[[Sergi López (actor)|Sergi López]]''' as '''Captain Vidal''': Del Toro met with López in [[Barcelona]], a year and a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. In Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the producers told del Toro "You should be very careful because you don't know about these things because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance"; del Toro replied "Well, it's not that I don't know, it's that I don't care."<ref name="oscarwatch">{{cite news |url=http://www.oscarwatch.com/2007/01/pans_labyrinth_a_story_that.html |title=Pan's Labyrinth: A Story that Needed Guillermo Del Toro |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2007-01-11]]|publisher=oscarwatch.com| last=Stone|first=Sasha}}</ref> Of his character, López said he is "the most evil character I've ever played in my career. It is impossible to improve upon it; the character is so solid and so well written. Vidal is deranged, a psychopath who is impossible to defend. Even though his father's personality marked his existence - and is certainly one of the reasons for his mental disorder - that cannot be an excuse. It would seem to be very cynical to use that to justify or explain his cruel and cowardly acts. I think it is great that the film does not consider any justification of fascism."<ref name="Lopez biography">{{cite news|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0530365/bio|title=Sergi López's biography|accessdate=2007-07-25 |date=[[2007-07-25]]|publisher=oscarwatch.com| last=Stone|first=Sasha}}</ref> 
*'''[[Maribel Verdú]]''' as '''Mercedes''': Like López, Verdú was cast against type; usually playing a sex goddess, del Toro selected her to play the compassionate revolutionary because he "saw a sadness in her...he thought would be perfect for the part".<ref name="oscarwatch"/>
*'''[[Ariadna Gil]]''' as '''Carmen''': Ofelia's mother and Vidal's wife.
*'''Alex Angulo''' as '''Doctor Ferreiro''': a doctor in the service of Vidal who is anti-fascist.
*'''Roger Casamajor''' as '''Pedro''': One of the Rebels, and Mercede's brother.
*'''César Vea''' as '''Serrano''': Vidal's lieutenant.

===Effects===
''Pan's Labyrinth'' employs some [[computer generated imagery]] in its effects, but also uses complex make-up and [[puppetry]]. The giant [[toad]] was inspired by ''[[The Maze (1953 film)|The Maze]]''. Del Toro himself performed the noises. The [[mandrake root]] is a combination of puppetry and CGI. Del Toro wanted the fairies "to look like little monkeys, like dirty fairies," but the animation company had the idea to give them wings made of leaves.<ref name="USAToday">{{cite web|url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-01-02-pans-labyrinth-main_x.htm |accessdate=2007-07-20|date=2007-03-14|title=Surprises lurk inside ''Pan's Labyrinth''| publisher=[[USA Today]]|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan}}</ref>

Jones spent five hours putting on make-up for the faun, which was mostly [[latex]] [[foam]]. He operated the faun's legs, while his own were digitally erased. Puppeteers helped to operate his face. Del Toro told Jones to "go rock star... like a glam rocker. But less [[David Bowie]], more [[Mick Jagger]]."<ref name="USAToday"/> Del Toro also had the faun grow younger as the movie progressed. Jones said that he had to look out of the Pale Man's nostrils. The Pale Man's legs were attached to the front of his over a green [[leotard]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.chud.com/index.php?type=interviews&id=8772 |accessdate=2007-07-20|title=INTERVIEW: DOUG JONES (PAN'S LABYRINTH)|date=[[February 18]] [[2007]]|last=Fischer|first=Russ}}</ref>

===Subtitles===
The film uses [[subtitles]] for its translation into [[English language|English]]. Del Toro wrote them himself, because he was disappointed with the subtitles of his previous Spanish film, ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]''. In an interview, he said that they were "for the thinking impaired" and "incredibly bad." He spent a month working with two other people, and said that he didn't want it to "feel like... watching a subtitled film."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.postchronicle.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=9&num=64817 |accessdate=2007-08-20 |date=[[18 February]] [[2007]]|title=Labyrinth Director Wrote His Own Subtitles}}</ref>

=== Comparisons to other films ===
In 2007, del Toro noted the striking similarities between his film and [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney's]] ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|The Chronicles of Narnia]]'': both films are set around the same time, have similar child-age principal characters, mythic creatures (particularly the fauns), and themes of "disobedience and choice." Says del Toro: "This is my version of that universe, not only 'Narnia,' but that universe of children's literature."<ref name=del-toro-narnia>{{cite news|url=http://www.starbeacon.com/heat/local_story_363121523|title=Del Toro crafts a harrowing fairy tale|accessdate=2007-03-28|date=[[December 29]] [[2006]] |publisher=[[Star Beacon]]}}</ref> In fact, del Toro was asked to direct ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' but turned it down for ''Pan's Labyrinth.''<ref name=del-toro-narnia/>

In addition to ''Narnia'', ''Pan's Labyrinth'' has also been compared to films such as [[Gabor Csupo]]'s ''[[Bridge to Terabithia (2007 film)|Bridge to Terabithia]]'' and [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/83674.html |title=Pan's Labyrinth Film Review - Time Out Film |accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canmag.com/nw/6778-bridge-terabithia-review | title=Bridge to Terabithia a Pan's Labyrinth for Kids |accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> Del Toro himself has noted similarities with ''[[The Spirit of the Beehive]]''.<ref name=outsidetheframe>{{cite web|url= http://www.thephoenix.com/OutsideTheFrame/PermaLink.aspx?guid=8ae649e6-a17f-478b-993a-a6f0f791a936 |title=Outside The Frame: Guillermo Del Toro Interview Part 1 |accessdate=2007-01-28 |date=[[January 11]] [[2007]] |publisher=ThePhoenix.com}}</ref>
