The '''Zambezi''' (also spelled '''Zambesi''') is the [[List of rivers by length|fourth-longest]] [[river]] in [[Africa]], and the largest flowing into the [[Indian Ocean]]. The area of its [[drainage basin|basin]] is [[1 E12 m²|1,390,000&nbsp; km²]] (537,000&nbsp;[[square mile|miles²]]),<ref name="Beilfuss"/><ref name="INBO"/> slightly less than half that of the [[Nile]]. The 2,574&nbsp;km- (1,600 mile-) long river has its source in [[Zambia]] and flows through [[Angola]], along the borders of [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], Zambia, and [[Zimbabwe]], to [[Mozambique]], where it empties into the Indian Ocean.

The Zambezi's most spectacular feature is [[Victoria Falls]], the world's largest [[waterfall]]s. Other notable falls include the [[Chavuma Falls]] at the border between Zambia and Angola, and [[Ngonye Falls]], near [[Sioma]] in Western Zambia. 

There are two main sources of [[hydroelectric]] power on the river.  These are the [[Kariba Dam]], which provides power to Zambia and Zimbabwe and the [[Cahora Bassa|Cahora Bassa Dam]] in [[Mozambique]] which provides power to [[South Africa]]. There is also a smaller power station at Victoria Falls.

==Course==
===Source===
The river rises in a black marshy [[dambo]] in north-western [[Zambia]], in undulating [[miombo woodland]], quite dense in parts, about 1,500&nbsp;metres (4,900 ft) above [[sea level]]. Eastward of the source the [[drainage basin|watershed]] between the [[Congo River|Congo]] and Zambezi basins is a well-marked belt of high ground, falling abruptly north and south, and running nearly east-west. This distinctly cuts off the basin of the [[Lualaba]] (the main branch of the upper Congo) from that of the Zambezi. In the neighbourhood of the source the watershed is not as clearly defined, but the two river systems do not connect.

===The upper river===
The river flows to the south-west and into [[Angola]] for about 240&nbsp;km (150&nbsp;miles), then is joined by sizeable [[tributary|tributaries]] such as the [[Luena River, Angola|Luena]] and the Chifumage flowing from highlands to the north-west. It turns south and develops a floodplain and becomes very variable in width between the dry and rainy seasons. It enters a region with dense patches of evergreen [[Ecoregions of Zambia#Cryptosepalum dry forests|Cryptosepalum dry forest]], though on its wesern side, [[Ecoregions of Zambia#Western Zambezian grasslands|Western Zambezian grasslands]] also occur. Where it re-enters Zambia it is nearly 400 m wide in the rainy season and flows quite quickly with [[rapids]] ending in the [[Chavuma Falls]], where the river flows through a rocky fissure. The river drops about 400 metres in elevation from its source to the at 1500&nbsp;metres (4,900 ft) to the Chavuma Falls at 1100&nbsp;metres (3,600 ft), in a distance of about 400&nbsp;km (250&nbsp;miles). From this point to the [[Victoria Falls]], the level of the basin is very uniform, dropping only by another 180&nbsp;metres (590&nbsp;ft) in a distance of around 800&nbsp;km (500&nbsp;miles). 

The first of its large tributaries to enter the Zambezi is the [[Kabompo River]] in the north-western province of Zambia. The [[savanna]] through which the river has flowed gives way to a wide floodplain, studded with [[Borassus]] [[fan palm]]s. A little farther south is the [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] with the [[Lungwebungu River]]. This is the beginning of the [[Barotse Floodplain]], the most notable feature of the upper Zambezi, but this northern part does not flood so much and includes islands of higher land in the middle
[[Image:Zambezi River near Zambezi Town.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Zambezi River in North Western Zambia]]

Thirty kilometers (20 miles) below the confluence of the [[Lungwebungu]] the country becomes very flat, and the typical Barotse Floodplain landscape unfolds, with the flood reaching a width of 25 km in the [[rainy season]]. For more than 200 km downstream the annual flood cycle dominates the natural environment and human life, society and culture.

Eighty kilometers (50&nbsp;miles) further down, the [[Luanginga]], which with its tributaries drains a large area to the west, joins the Zambezi. A few kilometres higher up on the east the main stream is joined in the rainy season by overflow of the [[Luampa River|Luampa]]/[[Luena River, Western Zambia|Luena]] system.

A short distance downstream of the confluence with the Luanginga is [[Lealui]], one of the capitals of the [[Lozi people]] who populate the semi-[[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] Zambian region of [[Barotseland]]. The chief of the Lozi has two compounds, the other being at [[Limulunga]]. Limulunga is on high ground and serves as the capital during the rainy season. The annual move from Lealui to Limulunga is a major event, celebrated as one of Zambia's best known festivals, the [[Kuomboka]].

After Lealui, the river turns to south-south-east. From the east it continues to receive numerous small streams, but on the west is without major tributaries for 240&nbsp;km (150&nbsp;miles). Before this, the [[Ngonye Falls]] and subsequent rapids interrupt navigation. South of Ngonye Falls, the river briefly borders [[Namibia]]'s [[Caprivi Strip]]. The strip projects from the main body of Namibia, and results from the colonial era: it was added to [[German South-West Africa]] expressly to give [[Germany]] access to the Zambezi.

Below the junction of the [[Cuando River]] and the Zambezi the river bends almost due east. Here, the river is very broad and shallow, and flows fairly slowly, but as it flows eastward towards the border of the great central plateau of Africa it reaches a chasm into which the [[Victoria Falls]] plunge.

===The middle Zambezi===
[[Image:Victoria5.jpg|[[Victoria Falls]], the end of the upper Zambezi and beginning of the middle Zambezi|thumb|right|250px]]

The [[Victoria Falls]] are considered the boundary between the upper and middle Zambezi. Below them the river continues to flow due east for about 200&nbsp;km (120&nbsp;miles), cutting through perpendicular walls of [[basalt]] 20 to 60&nbsp;metres (65 to 200 ft) apart in hills 200 to 250&nbsp;metres (650 to 820 ft) high. The river flows swiftly through the gorge, the current being continually interrupted by reefs. Beyond the gorge are a succession of [[rapids]] which end 240&nbsp;km (150&nbsp;miles) below Victoria Falls. Over this distance, the river drops 250 metres (820 ft).

At this point, the river enters [[Lake Kariba]], created in 1959 following the completion of the [[Kariba Dam]]. The lake is one of the largest man-made lakes in the world, and the [[hydroelectric]] power-generating facilities at the dam provide electricity to much of Zambia and [[Zimbabwe]].

The [[Luangwa]] and the [[Kafue]] are the two largest left-hand tributaries of the Zambezi. The Kafue joins the main river in a quiet deep stream about 180&nbsp;metres (590 ft) wide. From this point the northward bend of the Zambezi is checked and the stream continues due east. At the confluence of the Luangwa (15°37&prime;&nbsp;S) it enters [[Mozambique]].

The middle Zambezi ends when the river enters Lake [[Cahora Bassa]] (also spelled Cabora Bassa). Formerly the site of dangerous rapids known as Kebrabassa, the lake was created in 1974 by the construction of the Cahora Bassa Dam.

===The lower river===
The lower Zambezi's 650&nbsp;km (400&nbsp;miles) from Cahora Bassa to the Indian Ocean is navigable, although the river is shallow in many places during the [[dry season]]. This shallowness arises as the river enters a broad valley and spreads out over a large area. Only at one point, the [[Lupata Gorge]], 320&nbsp;km (200&nbsp;miles) from its mouth, is the river confined between high hills. Here it is scarcely 200 metres wide. Elsewhere it is from 5 to 8&nbsp;km (3 to 5&nbsp;miles) wide, flowing gently in many streams. The river bed is sandy, and the banks are low and reed-fringed. At places, however, and especially in the [[rainy season]], the streams unite into one broad fast-flowing river.

[[Image:Zambezi delta.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Zambezi's delta]]

About 160&nbsp;km (100&nbsp;miles) from the sea the Zambezi receives the drainage of [[Lake Malawi]] through the [[Shire River]]. On approaching the [[Indian Ocean]], the river splits up into a number of branches and forms a wide [[river delta|delta]]. Each of the four principal mouths, Milambe, Kongone, Luabo and Timbwe, is obstructed by a sand bar. A more northerly branch, called the Chinde mouth, has a minimum depth at low water of 2&nbsp;metres at the entrance and 4&nbsp;metres further in, and is the branch used for navigation. 100&nbsp;km (60&nbsp;miles) further north is a river called the [[Quelimane]], after the town at its mouth. This stream, which is silting up, receives the overflow of the Zambezi in the rainy season. The delta of the Zambezi is today about half as broad as it was before the construction of the [[Kariba]] and [[Cahora Bassa]] dams controlled the seasonal variations in the flow rate of the river.

The region drained by the Zambezi is a vast broken-edged plateau 900–1200&nbsp;metres high, composed in the remote interior of [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] beds and fringed with the [[igneous]] rocks of the Victoria Falls. At [[Shupanga]], on the lower Zambezi, thin strata of grey and yellow [[sandstone]]s, with an occasional band of [[limestone]], crop out on the bed of the river in the dry season, and these persist beyond [[Tete]], where they are associated with extensive seams of [[coal]]. Coal is also found in the district just below the Victoria Falls. [[Gold]]-bearing rocks occur in several places.

The north of the [[Zambezi basin]] has mean annual rainfall of 1100 to 1400 mm which declines towards the south, reaching about half that figure in the south-west. The rain falls in a 4 to 6 month [[rainy season]] when the [[Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]] moves over the basin from the north. [[Evaporation]] rates are high (1600mm−2300 mm) and much water is lost this way in swamps and floodplains, especially in the south-west of the basin.<ref name="Beilfuss">[http://www.gorongosa.net/research/research_documents/Patterns_Hydrological_Change_Zambezi_Delta.pdf  Richard Beilfuss & David dos Santos: Patterns of Hydrological Change in the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique.] Working Paper No 2 Program for the Sustainable Management of Cahora Bassa Dam and The Lower Zambezi Valley (2001)</ref>

'''TOTAL ZAMBEZI RIVER BASIN: 1,390,000 km², 3424 m³/s discharged into delta'''

''Source: Beilfuss & Dos Santos (2001)''<ref name="Beilfuss"/>

The [[Okavango Basin]] is not included in the figures because it only occasionally overflows to any extent into the Zambezi.

Due to the rainfall distribution, northern tributaries contribute much more water than southern ones, for example: the Northern Highlands catchment of the upper Zambezi contributes 25%, Kafue 8%, Luangwa and Shire Rivers 16% each, total 65% of Zambezi discharge. The large Cuando basin in the south-west on the other hand contributes only about 2 m³/s because most is lost through evaporation in its swamp systems.

The 1940s and 1950s were particularly wet decades in the basin. Since 1975, it has been drier, the average discharge being only 70% of that for the years 1930 to 1958.<ref name="Beilfuss"/>

====Floods====
Before the dams were built, the lower Zambezi experienced a small [[flood]] surge early in the dry season as rain in the Gwembe catchment and north-eastern Zimbabwe rushed through while rain in the Upper Zambezi, Kafue, and Lake Malawi basins, and Luangwa to a lesser extent, is held back by swamps and floodplains. The discharge of these systems contributed to a much larger flood in March or April, with a mean monthly maximum for April of 6700 m³/s at the delta. The record flood was more than three times as big, 22,500 m³/s being recorded in 1958. By contrast the discharge at the end of the dry season averaged just 500 m³/s.<ref name="Beilfuss"/>

The dams at [[Kariba Dam|Kariba]], [[Cahora Bassa]] and [[Itezhi-Tezhi Dam|Itezhi-Tezhi on the Kafue]] have changed that pattern completely. Downstream of the dams, the mean monthly minimum—maximum was 500 m³/s—6000 m³/s, now it is 1000 m³/s—3900 m³/s. Medium-level floods especially, of the kind to which the ecology of the lower Zambezi was adapted, happen less often and have a shorter duration. As with the [[Itezhi-Tezhi Dam|Itezhi-Tezhi Dam's deleterious effects on the Kafue Flats]], this has the following effects:
* [[fish]], [[bird]] and other [[wildlife]] feeding and breeding patterns disrupted 
* less [[grassland]] after flooding for [[grazing]] wildlife and [[cattle]]
* traditional farming and fishing patterns disrupted.
The dams have not removed flooding in the lower Zambezi completely. They can't control extreme floods, they have just made medium-level floods less frequent. When heavy rain in the lower Zambezi combines with good runoff upstream, massive floods still happen, except they are more destructive because the absence of regular medium floods lures people to settle and farm former floodplains, so that when the flood does occur, it causes more damage. This is what happened in the floods of 1997.<ref name="Beilfuss"/>

== Geological changes to the course of the Zambezi ==
More than two million years ago, the Upper Zambezi river used to flow south through what is now the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]] to the [[Limpopo River]]. The land around the pan experienced [[tectonic uplift]] (perhaps as part of the [[African superswell]]) and a large lake formed, and extended east.

Meanwhile, 1000 km east, a western tributary of the [[Shire River]] in the [[Great Rift Valley]]'s southern extension through [[Malawi]] eroded a deep valley on its western escarpment. At the rate of a few centimetres per year, this river, the Middle Zambezi, started cutting back the bed of its river towards the west, aided by [[grabens]] ([[rift valley]]s) forming along its course in an east-west axis. As it did so it [[River capture|captured]] a number of south-flowing rivers such as the [[Luangwa River|Luangwa]] and [[Kafue River|Kafue]]. 

Eventually the large lake trapped at Makgadikgadi (or a tributary of it) was captured by the Middle Zambezi cutting back towards it, and emptied eastwards. The Upper Zambezi was captured as well. The Middle Zambezi was about 300 m lower than the Upper Zambezi, and a high waterfall formed at the edge of the basalt plateau across which the upper river flows. This was the first Victoria Falls, somewhere down the Batoka Gorge near where Lake Kariba is now.<ref>[http://www.zamsoc.org/documents/Summary%20of%20Technical%20Reviews%20Part%202.pdf AWF Four Corners Biodiversity Information Package No 2: Summary of Technical Reviews] Accessed 1 March 2007.</ref> For details of how the falls cuts back its bed to form the gorge, see [[Victoria Falls#How the Victoria Falls formed|How the Victoria Falls formed]].

==Exploration of the river==
[[Image:Satellite view of Victoria Falls.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Satellite image showing [[Victoria Falls]] and subsequent series of zigzagging gorges]]

The Zambezi region was known to [[medieval]] geographers as the [[Empire of Monomotapa]], and the course of the river, as well as the position of [[Lake Ngami|Lakes Ngami]] and [[Lake Nyasa|Nyasa]], were given broadly accurately in early maps. These were probably constructed from [[Arab]] information.

The first European to visit the upper Zambezi was [[David Livingstone]] in his exploration from [[Bechuanaland]] between 1851 and 1853. Two or three years later he descended the Zambezi to its mouth and in the course of this journey discovered the Victoria Falls. During 1858–60, accompanied by [[John Kirk (explorer)|John Kirk]], Livingstone ascended the river by the Kongone mouth as far as the Falls, and also traced the course of its tributary the Shire and reached Lake Malawi.

For the next 35 years very little exploration of the river took place, but in 1889 the Chinde channel north of the main mouths of the river was discovered. Two expeditions led by Major [[A. St Hill Gibbons]] in 1895 to 1896 and 1898 to 1900 continued the work of exploration begun by Livingstone in the upper basin and central course of the river. Portuguese explorer [[Serpa Pinto]] examined some of the western tributaries of the river and made measurements of the Victoria Falls in 1878.

==Wildlife==
The river supports large populations of many animals. [[Hippopotamus]]es are abundant along most of the calm stretches of the river, and many [[crocodile]]s are also present. [[Monitor lizard]]s are found in many places. [[Bird]] life is abundant, with species including [[heron]], [[pelican]], [[egret]] and [[African Fish Eagle]] present in large numbers. [[Riverine]] woodland also supports many large animals, such as [[African Buffalo|buffalo]], [[zebra]]s, [[giraffe]]s and [[elephant]]s. However, below Kariba and Cahora Bassa dams, the cessation of annual [[flood]]ing has seen the area of this habitat greatly reduced and a corresponding reduction in the populations of the large mammals.

The Zambezi also supports several hundred species of [[fish]], some of which are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the river. Important species include [[cichlid]]s which are fished heavily for food, as well as [[catfish]], [[tigerfish]], [[Zambezi Yellowfish|yellowfish]] and other large species. The [[bull shark]] is sometimes known as the Zambezi Shark after the river but is found around the world. It normally inhabits [[coast]]al waters but has been found far inland in many large rivers including the Zambezi. It is an aggressive shark which has been responsible for several attacks on humans.

==Economy==
[[Image:ISS009-E-7622- Zambezi river near Mongu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The river and its floodplain near Mongu in Zambia]]

The population of the Zambezi river valley is estimated to be about 32 million. About 80% of the population of the valley is dependent on [[agriculture]], and the upper river's [[flood plain]]s provide good agricultural land.

Communities by the river fish extensively from it, and many people travel from far afield to fish. Some Zambian towns on roads leading to the river levy unofficial 'fish taxes' on people taking Zambezi fish to other parts of the country. As well as fishing for food, [[game fishing]] is a significant activity on some parts of the river. Between [[Mongu]] and [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]], several [[safari]] lodges cater for [[tourist]]s who want to fish for exotic species, and many also catch fish to sell to [[aquaria]].

The river valley is rich in [[mineral]] deposits and [[fossil fuel]]s, and [[coal]] mining is important in places. The [[dam]]s along its length also provide employment for many people near them, in maintaining the [[hydroelectric]] power stations and the dams themselves. Several parts of the river are also very popular tourist destinations. Victoria Falls receives over 1.5 million visitors annually, while [[Mana Pools]] and [[Lake Kariba]] also draw substantial tourist numbers.

==Transport==
[[Image:Victoria Falls Bridge over Zambesi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Victoria Falls Bridge. 1975 photo.]]

The river is frequently interrupted by [[rapids]] and so has never been an important long-distance transport route. [[David Livingstone#Zambezi expedition|David Livingstone's Zambezi Expedition]] attempted to open up the river to navigation by [[paddle steamer]], but was defeated by the [[Cahora Bassa rapids]]. Along some stretches, it is often more convenient to travel by [[canoe]] along the river rather than on the unimproved roads which are often in very poor condition due to being regularly submerged in flood waters, and many small villages along the banks of the river are only accessible by boat. In the 1930s and 40s a paddle barge service operated on the stretch between the Katombora Rapids, about 50 km upstream from Livingstone, and the rapids just upstream from Katima Mulilo. However, depending on the water level, boats could be paddled through — [[Lozi]] paddlers, a dozen or more in a boat, could  deal with most of them — or they could be pulled along the shore or carried around the rapids, and teams of oxen pulled barges 5 km over land around the Ngonye Falls.<ref>[http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V1N2/V1N2.htm (On www.nrzam.org.uk website accessed 26 February)] E.

Road, rail and other crossings of the river, once few and far between, are proliferating. They are, in order from the source:

There are a number of small [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon]] ferries across the river in Angola, western Zambia, and Mozambique, notably between [[Mongu]] and [[Kalabo]]. Above Mongu in years following poor rainy seasons the river can be forded at one or two places.

==Ecology==
[[Image:STS51B-51-14- Lake Cahora Bassa.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lake Cahora Bassa in Mozambique, one of the river's major sources of hydroelectric energy]]

Sewage [[effluent]] is a major cause of water [[pollution]] around urban areas, as inadequate water treatment facilities in all the major cities of the region force them to release untreated sewage into the river. This has resulted in [[eutrophication]] of the river water and has facilitated the spread of diseases of poor [[hygiene]] such as [[cholera]], [[typhus]] and [[dysentery]].

The construction of two major dams regulating the flow of the river has had a major effect on wildlife and human populations in the lower Zambezi region. When the Cahora Bassa Dam was constructed in [[1973]], its managers allowed it to fill in a single flood season, going against recommendations to fill over at least two years. The drastic reduction in the flow of the river led to a 40% reduction in the coverage of [[mangrove]]s, greatly increased [[erosion]] of the coastal region and a 60% reduction in the catch of [[prawn]]s off the mouth due to the reduction in emplacement of [[silt]] and associate [[nutrient]]s. [[Wetland]] [[ecosystem]]s downstream of the dam shrank considerably.
