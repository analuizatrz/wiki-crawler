'''Scottish clans''' (from [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''clann'', "children"), give a sense of identity and shared descent to people in [[Scotland]] and to their relations throughout the world, with a formal structure of [[Scottish clan chief|Clan Chief]]s officially registered with the court of the [[Lord Lyon, King of Arms]] which controls the [[heraldry]] and [[Coat of Arms]]. Each [[clan]] has its own [[tartan]] patterns, usually dating to the 19th century, and members of the clan may wear [[kilt]]s, skirts, sashes, ties, scarves, or other items of clothing made of the appropriate tartan as a badge of membership and as a uniform where appropriate.

Clans identify with geographical areas originally controlled by the Chiefs, usually with an ancestral [[castle]] or [[manor house|manor]], and clan gatherings form a regular part of the social scene.

==Origins of the clans==
The word ''clann'' in [[scottish gaelic languge|Gaelic]] means "children of the family". Each clan was a large group of related people, theoretically an extended family, supposedly descended from one progenitor and all owing allegiance to the patriarchal clan chief. It also included a large group of loosely-related ''[[Sept (social)|septs]]'' – related families - all of whom looked to the [[Scottish clan chief|clan chief]] as their head and their protector.

The ''[[Senchus fer n-Alban]]'' lists three main kin groups in [[Dál Riata]] in Scotland, with a fourth being added later:<ref>The Senchus is translated in Bannerman, ''Studies'', pp. 47&ndash;49; previously published in ''Celtica'', vols. 7 (1966) &ndash; 9 (1971); earlier translations in Anderson, ''ESSH'', vol. 1, pp. cl&ndash;cliii and Skene, ''Chronicles of the Picts and Scots''.</ref>

* The [[Cenél nGabráin]], in [[Kintyre]], supposedly the descendants of [[Gabrán mac Domangairt]].
* The [[Cenél nÓengusa]], in Islay and [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], supposedly the descendants of Óengus Mór mac Eirc. 
* The [[Cenél Loairn]], in [[Lorne, Argyll and Bute|Lorne]], perhaps also [[Isle of Mull|Mull]] and [[Ardnamurchan]], supposedly the descendants of [[Loarn mac Eirc]].<ref>Broun, ""Dál Riata", notes that the Senchus treats the Cenél Loairn differently. In fact, it lists the three (actually four) thirds of the Cenél Loairn as the Cenél Shalaig (or Cenél Fergusa Shalaig), Cenél Cathbath, Cenél nEchdach and Cenél Muiredaig. Even the compiler of the Senchus doubts whether their [[eponym]]ous founders Fergus Shalaig, Cathbad, Eochaid and Muiredach were all sons of Loarn mac Eirc.</ref>
* The [[Cenél Comgaill]], in [[Cowal]] and [[Isle of Bute|Bute]], a later addition, supposedly the descendants of [[Comgall mac Domangairt]].<ref>Bannerman, ''Studies'', p. 110, dates the separation of the Cenél Comgaill from the Cenél nGabráin to around 700.</ref>

The Senchus does not list any kindreds in Ireland. Among the Cenél Loairn it lists the [[Airgíalla]], although whether this should be understood as being Irish settlers or simply another tribe to whom the label was applied is unclear.<ref>Bannerman, ''Studies'', pp. 115&ndash;118, proposes a tie to the [[Uí Macc Uais]]. See also Bannerman, ''Studies'', pp. 120 & 122, noting that the ''Tripartite Life'' of [[Saint Patrick]] appears to refer to a "Cenél nÓengusa" in Anterim.</ref> The meaning of Airgíalla 'hostage givers' adds to the uncertainty, although it must be observed that only one grouping in Ireland was apparenly given this name and it is therefore very rare, perhaps supporting the Ui Macc Uais hypothesis{{what?}}. There is no reason to suppose that this is a complete or accurate list.<ref>The Annals of Ulster, s.a. 670, refer to the return of the ''genus Gartnaith'', i.e. the Cenél Gartnait, from Ireland to Skye. This Gartnait is presumed to be a son of Áedán mac Gabraín: see Broun, "Dál Riata". Bannerman, ''Studies'', pp. 92&ndash;94, identifies this Gartnait as a son of Áedán, whom he sees as the same person as [[Gartnait IV of the Picts|Gartnait]], king of the Picts. No such son is named by Adomnán, in the annals, or by the Senchus. See also Adomnán, ''Life'', II, 22, and note 258, where a certain Ioan mac Conaill mac Domnaill is said to have belonged to "the royal lineage of Cenél nGabráin". See also the discussion of the Cenél Loairn above.</ref> 

Some clans such as [[Clan Campbell]] and [[Clan Donald]] claim ancient [[Celtic mythology|Celtic mythological]] progenitors mentioned in the [[Fenian cycle]], with a group including [[Clan Sweeney|Clan MacSween]], [[Clan Lamont]], [[Clan MacEwen of Otter]], [[Clan Maclachlan]], and [[Clan MacNeil|MacNeil]] tracing their ancestry back to the 5th century High King of [[Ireland]]. Others such as [[Clan MacAulay]], [[Clan Mackinnon]] and [[Clan Gregor]] claim descent from the [[Scottish people|Scots]] King [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Kenneth Mac Alpin]] who made himself King of the [[Picts]] in 843, founding the Kingdom called after the name of the land [[Alba]] (modern-day Scotland). The [[Clan Donald|MacDonald]]s and [[MacDougall]]s claim descent from [[Somerled]], the [[Norse-Gael|half-Gael/Norse-Manx]] [[Lord of the Isles]] in the mid-11th century.

Though the clans had always been a feature of pre-Christian Scotland and Ireland, they first emerged into English consciousness from the turmoil of the 12th and 13th centuries when the Scottish crown pacified northern rebellions and re-conquered areas taken by the Norse, and after the fall of [[Macbeth I of Scotland|Macbeth]] when the crown became increasingly [[Anglo-Norman]]. This turmoil created opportunities for [[Norsemen|Norse]], [[Gaels|Scottish]] and [[England|English]] warlords and their kin to dominate areas, and the instability of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] brought in warlords with [[Normans|Norman]], and [[Flemings|Flemish]] ancestry, founding clans such as the [[Clan Chisholm|Chisholms]] and [[Clan Menzies|Menzies]].

==The [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] clan system==
===Inheritance and authority===
The '''Scottish Highland clan system''' incorporated the [[Celt]]ic/[[Norsemen|Norse]] traditions of heritage as well as [[Normans|Norman]] [[Feudal society]]. Chieftains and petty kings under the [[suzerainty]] of a [[High King]] (''ard rí'') ruled [[Gaels|Gaelic]] [[Alba]], with all such offices being filled through election by an assembly. Usually the candidate was nominated by the current office holder on the approach of death, and his heir-elect was known as the tanist, from the Gaelic ''tànaiste'', or second, with the system being known as [[tanistry]]. This system combined a hereditary element with the consent of those ruled, and while the succession in clans later followed the [[feudalism|feudal]] rule of [[primogeniture]], the concept of authority coming from the clan continued.

Thus the collective heritage of the clan, the ''dùthchas'', gave the right to settle the land to which the chiefs and leading gentry provided protection and authority as trustees for the people. This was combined with the complementary concept of ''òighreachd'' where the chieftain's authority came from charters granted by the feudal Scottish crown, where individual heritage was warranted. While ''dùthchas'' held precedence in the [[medieval]] period, the balance shifted as the mainly lowland [[Scots law]] became increasingly important in shaping the structure of clanship.

===Legal process===
To settle criminal and civil disputes within clans both sides put their case to an [[arbitration]] panel drawn from the leading gentry of the clan and presided over by the chief. Similarly, in disputes between clans the chiefs served as procurators (legal agents) for the disputants in their clan and put the case to an arbitration panel of equal numbers of gentry from each clan presided over by a neighbouring chief or landlord. There was no appeal from the decision which awarded reparations, called ''assythment'', to the wronged party and which was recorded in a convenient Royal or Burgh court. This compensation took account of the age, responsibilities and status of the victim as well as the nature of the crime, and once paid precluded any further action for redress against the perpetrator. To speed this process clans made standing provisions for arbitration and regularly contracted bands of friendship between the clans which had the force of law and were recorded in a convenient court.

===Social ties===
[[Fosterage]] and [[manrent]] were the most important forms of social bonding in the clans. In fosterage, the chief's children were brought up by favoured members of the leading clan gentry (traditionally the mother's brother or similar, i.e. in another clan), whose children in turn were brought up by other favoured members of the clan (again the mother's brother or the like - i.e. in another clan). This brought about intense ties and reinforced inter-clan cohesion. [[Manrent]] was a bond contracted by the heads of families looking to the chief for territorial protection, though not living on the estates of the clan elite. These bonds were reinforced by ''calps'', death duties paid to the chief as a mark of personal allegiance by the family when their head died, usually in the form of their best cow or horse. Although ''calps'' were banned by [[Parliament]] in 1617, manrent continued covertly to pay for protection. 

Less durably, marriage alliances reinforced kinship between clans. These were contracts involving the exchange of livestock, money and rent, ''tocher'' for the bride and ''dowry'' for the groom.

===Clan management===
Payments of rents and ''calps'' from those living on clan estates and ''calps'' alone from families living elsewhere were channelled through ''[[Tacksman|tacksmen]]''{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. These lesser gentry acted as estate managers, allocating the ''run-rig'' strips of land, lending seed-corn and tools and arranging droving of cattle to the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] for sale, taking a minor share of the payments made to the clan nobility, the ''fine''{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. They had the important military role of mobilising the ''Clan Host'', both when required for warfare and more commonly as a large turn out of followers for weddings and funerals, and traditionally in August for hunts which included sports for the followers, the predecessors of the modern [[Highland games]]{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. 

From the late 16th century the [[Scottish Privy Council]], recognising the need for co-operation, required clan leaders to provide bonds of surety for the conduct of anyone on their territory and to regularly attend at [[Edinburgh]], encouraging a tendency to become absentee landlords. With an increase in droving, tacksmen acquired the wealth to finance the gentry's debts secured against their estates, hence acquiring the land. By the 1680s this led to the land in ownership largely coinciding with the collective 'dutchas' for the first time. The tacksmen became responsible for the bonds of surety leading to a decline in banditry and feuding.

===Disputes and disorder===
Where the ''oighreachd'', land owned by the clan elite or ''fine'', did not match the common heritage of the ''duthchas'' this led to territorial disputes and warfare. The ''fine'' resented their clansmen paying rent to other landlords, while acquisitive clans used disputes to expand their territories, and many clan histories record ferocious long lasting feuding such as the [[Clan Gordon]] and the [[Clan Forbes]], which lasted for centuries and caused many deaths in both clans. On the western seaboard clans became involved with the wars of the Irish Gaels against the Tudor English, and a military caste called the ''buannachan'' developed, seasonally fighting in Ireland as mercenaries and living off their clans as minor gentry, but this was brought to an end with the [[Plantations of Ireland|Irish Plantations]] of [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland and I of England]]. During that century law increasingly settled disputes, and the last feud leading to a battle was at [[Battle of Mulroy|Mulroy]] in [[Lochaber]] on August 4 1688.

[[Reive|Reiving]] had been a rite of passage, the ''creach'' where young men took livestock from neighbouring clans. By the 17th century this had declined and most reiving was the ''spreidh'' where up to 10 men raided the adjoining [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]], the livestock taken usually being recoverable on payment of ''tascal'' (information money) and guarantee of no prosecution. Some clans offered the Lowlanders protection against such raids, on terms not dissimilar to [[blackmail]]. 

Although by the late 17th century disorder declined, reiving persisted with the growth of ''cateran'' bands of up to 50 [[Outlaw|bandits]], usually led by a renegade of the gentry, who had thrown off the constraints of the clan system. As well as preying off the clans, ''caterans'' acted as mercenaries for Lowland lairds pursuing disputes amongst themselves.

===Civil wars and Jacobitism===
As the [[wars of the Three Kingdoms|civil wars of the Three Kingdoms]] broke out in the early 17th century the [[Covenanter]]s were supported by the territorially ambitious Argyll Campbells and House of Sutherland as well as some clans of the central Highlands opposed to the Royalist House of Huntly. While some clans remained neutral, others led by [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Montrose]] supported the Royalist cause, projecting their feudal obligations to clan chiefs onto the Royal [[House of Stuart]], resisting the demands of the Covenanters for commitment and reacting to the ambitions of the larger clans. In the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars]] of 1644-47, the most prominent Royalist clan were [[Clan Donald]] led by [[Alasdair MacColla]]. 

With the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalianism]] became widespread among clans as it suited the hierarchical clan structure and encouraged obedience to Royal authority, while some other clans were converted by [[Catholic]] missions.
In 1682 James Duke of York, Charles' brother, instituted the Commission for Pacifying the Highlands which worked in co-operation with the clan chiefs in maintaining order as well as redressing Campbell acquisitiveness, and when he became King [[James II of England|James VII]] he retained popularity with many Highlanders. All these factors contributed to continuing support for the Stuarts when James was deposed by [[William III of Orange|William of Orange]] in the "[[Glorious Revolution]]".

The support among many clans, their remoteness from authority and the ready mobilisation of the clan hosts made the Highlands the starting point for the [[Jacobite Rising]]s. In Scottish [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] ideology the Highlander symbolised patriotic purity as against the corruption of the Union, and as early as 1689 some Lowlanders wore "''Highland habit''" in the Jacobite army.

===Decline of the Clan system===
Successive Scottish governments had portrayed the clans as bandits needing occasional military expeditions to keep them in check and extract taxes. As Highlanders became associated with [[Jacobitism]] and rebellion the government made repeated efforts to curb the clans, culminating with brutal repression after the [[battle of Culloden]]. This followed in 1746 with the [[Act of Proscription]], further measures making restrictions on their ability to bear arms, traditional dress, culture, and even music. The [[Heritable Jurisdictions Act]] removed the [[feudal]] authority the Clan Chieftains had once enjoyed. 

With the failure of Jacobitism the clan chiefs and gentry increasingly became landlords, losing the traditional obligations of clanship. They were incorporated into the British aristocracy, looking to the clan lands mainly to provide them with a suitable income. From around 1725 clansmen had been emigrating to America; both clan gentry looking to re-establish their lifestyle, or as victims of raids on the [[Hebrides]] looking for cheap labour. Increasing demand in Britain for cattle and sheep led to higher rents with surplus clan population leaving in the mass migration later known as the [[Highland Clearances]], finally undermining the traditional clan system.

==Romantic "revival" of interest==
[[Image:George IV in kilt, by Wilkie.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]'s flattering portrait of the [[kilt]]ed [[King George IV]], with lighting chosen to tone down the brightness of his kilt and his knees shown bare, without the pink [[tights]] he wore at the event.]]
The [[Ossian]] poems of [[James Macpherson]] in the 1760s suited the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] enthusiasm for the ''"sublime" "primitive"'' and achieved international success with a disguised elegy for the Jacobite clans, set in the remote past. They were presented as translations of ancient ballads, a fraud caustically dismissed by Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]]. This damaged the reputation of the poems, but their artistic merit had widespread influence.

Shortly before or after the [[Dress Act]] restricting kilt wearing was repealed in 1782, Highland aristocrats set up Highland Societies in [[Edinburgh]] and other centres including [[Highland Society of London| London]] and [[Aberdeen]], landowners' clubs with aims including "Improvements" (which others would later call the [[Highland Clearances]]). Clubs like the Celtic Society of Edinburgh included Highland chieftains and Lowlanders taking an interest in the clans. The success of the [[historical novel]]s of [[Sir Walter Scott]] as well as the pomp surrounding the [[visit of King George IV to Scotland]] in 1822 spurred 19th century interest in the clans and a reawakening of Scottish culture and pride.

----

===The Lowland Families===
It is quite acceptable to refer to the great Lowland families as clans also, since the Scots themselves appear to have used both terms interchangeably until the 19th century. In an Act of the Scottish Parliament of 1597 we have the description of the "Chiftanis and chieffis of all clannis...duelland in the hielands or bordouris" - thus using the word clan and chief to describe both Highland and Lowland families. The act goes on to list the various Lowland clans including the Maxwells, Jardines, Turnbulls and other famous [[Border Reivers]] names. Further, Sir George MacKenzie of Rosehaugh, the Lord Advocate (Attorney General) writing in 1680 said "By the term 'chief' we call the representative of the family from the word chef or head and in the Irish (Gaelic) with us the chief of the family is called the head of the clan". So it can be seen that all along the words chief or head and clan or family are interchangeable. It is therefore quite correct to talk of the MacDonald family or the Stirling clan. The idea that Highlanders should be listed as clans while the Lowlanders should be termed as families is a 19th century convention. <ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/clans_families_septs.htm Clans, Families and Septs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The important point to remember is that until the 19th century, the Lowland or Border clans did not identify themselves by specific tartans, nor did they wear the kilt or play the Great Highland Pipes (although they would be familiar with the widely used Lowland or Border Pipes) but afterwards they adopted these characteristics of Highland culture as a form of clan identification, which they are happy to use to the present day.

'''The cultural development of the Lowlands''' 

The [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] south of the [[river Forth]] had been [[Brython]]ic Celtic, with the southeast coming under the [[Angles]] and [[Galloway]] and the western seaboard becoming [[Norse-Gaels|Norse-Gaelic]], then by 1034 the [[Kingdom of Alba]] had expanded to bring all but the last area under Gaelic Celtic rule. From the accession of King [[David I of Scotland|David I]] (1124), the traditional social patterns of much of eastern Scotland began to be altered, particularly with the growth of [[burghs]] and the settlement of French [[feudal]] families on royal demesne lands. This process was, of course, very slow, but its cumulative effect over many centuries was to undermine the integrity of Gaelic in the areas affected, areas which later became known collectively as the ''Lowlands'', though to a large extent Galloway and Carrick, where [[Galwegian Gaelic]] survived into the 17th century, were not affected as much as elsewhere until very late. 

However, many aristocratic Gaelic clans did in fact survive in form, especially in Galloway (e.g. ''[[Clan MacDowall|MacDowall]]'', ''[[Clan MacLellan|MacLellan]]'', ''MacCann'' ), Carrick (e.g. ''[[Kennedy]]'') and Fife (e.g. ''[[Clan MacDuff|MacDuff]]''). The term ''clan'' was still being used of Lowland families at the end of the 16th century and, while aristocrats may have been increasingly likely to use the word ''family'', the terms remained interchangeable until the 19th century.

By the late 18th century the Lowlands were integrated into the British system, with an uneasy relationship to the Highlanders. The total population of Lowlanders diminished drastically in some parts of the south as a direct result of the [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] which resulted in the [[Lowland Clearances]], and the subsequent [[emigration]] of large numbers of Lowland Scots. 

However, with the revival of interest in Gaeldom and the visit of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] to [[Scotland]] in 1822, there was a new enthusiasm amongst Lowlanders for re-identification with their Gaelic culture. As a result many Lowland families and aristocrats now appear on clan lists with their own tartans, in some cases with a claim to ancestry from the Highland area &ndash; encouraged, no doubt, by companies who market supposed [[coats-of-arms]] and [[heraldry|heraldic devices]], manufacturers of tartan cloth, and by the immense growth of [[Internet]] [[genealogy|genealogical research]], beginning in the last few years of the twentieth century. As a result, many Lowland/Border clans now have their own clan societies, [[website]]s and annual reunions.

==Clan membership==
A clan is community which is distinguished by [[heraldry]] and recognised by the [[Sovereign]]. A clan is considered a "noble incorporation" because a [[Scottish clan chief|clan chief]] is a title of honour in Scotland and the chief confers his or her noble status onto the clan. Clans with recognised chiefs are therefore recognised under [[Scottish law]]. A group without a chief recognised by the Sovereign, through the Lord Lyon, has no position under Scottish law. All claimants to the title of chief must be recognised by the Lord Lyon who determines if the claimant is entitled to the [[undifferenced arms]] of the community of which the claimant wishes to be chief. A chief of a clan is the only person who is entitled to bear the undifferenced arms of that community. The clan as a "noble corporation" is the chief's heritable property and the chief's Seal of Arms is the seal of the corporation. Under law the chief owns the clan and is responsible for it.<ref name="electricscotland.com--clans_families_septs">[[Crispin Agnew of Lochnaw|Agnew of Lochnaw, Crispin]]. [http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/clans_families_septs.htm "Clans, Families and Septs"] Retrieved on [[2008-02-26]]</ref><ref name="lyon-court.com--239">[http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/239.html What is a clan?] ''[[Lyon Court]]''. Retrieved on [[2008-02-26]]</ref>

Historically a clan was made up of everyone who lived on the chief's territory, or on territory of those who owed allegiance to the said chief. Through time, with the constant changes of "clan boundaries", migration or regime changes, clans would be made up of large numbers of members who were unrelated and who bore different surnames. Often those living on a chief's lands would over time adopt the clan surname. A chief could add to his clan by adopting other families, and also had the legal right to outlaw anyone from his clan, including members of his own family. Today, anyone who has the chief's [[surname]] is automatically considered to be a member of the chief's clan. Also, anyone who offers allegiance to a chief is considered a member of the chief's clan, unless the chief decides not to accept that person's allegiance.<ref name="lyon-court.com--240">[http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/240.html Who is a member of a clan?] ''[[Lyon Court]]''. Retrieved on [[2008-02-26]]</ref> The only rule is that it is up to the chief whom he may decide to accept as a member of his clan. 

Clan membership goes through the surname.<ref name="clan-duncan.co.uk--lyon_Leaflet_2"/> It does ''not'' pass through a married woman who has taken her husband's surname, and then on to her children. Children who take their father's surname are part of their father's clan and ''not'' their mothers. However, today it is common for people to claim clan membership through their mother's side of the family, anyone who offers allegiance to a particular clan chief is part of his or her clan (unless refused by the chief).<ref name="clan-duncan.co.uk--lyon_Leaflet_2">[http://www.clan-duncan.co.uk/images/heraldry/lyon_Leaflet_2.pdf Information Leaflet No. 2] Retrieved on [[2008-01-29]]</ref> Today many clans have lists of [[sept (social)|septs]]. Septs are surnames, families or clans which historically, currently or for whatever reason the chief chooses, are associated with that clan. There is no official list of clan septs, and the decision of what septs a clan has is left up to the clan itself.<ref name="lyon-court.com--240"/> Confusingly many sept names are shared by many clans, and it may up to the individual to use his or her family history or genealogy to find the correct clan they are associated with.

{{See|Tartan|Kilt}}
There are no official rules on who can or can not wear a particular tartan. Up until now there has been no official registry for tartans but this changed on the 9th October 2008, when it was announced that the Scottish Parliament had passed a bill establishing an official register of tartans for the first time. The National Archives of Scotland will create and maintain the register. <ref>'MSPs approve tartan register bill': http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7661994.stm</ref> 

Even though the Lord Lyon does not have jurisdiction over tartans, the Lord Lyon may record a specific tartan which a clan chief or commander wishes to use as an "official" tartan for their clan.<ref name="lyon-court.com--243">[http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/243.html Tartans] ''[[Lyon Court]]''. Retrieved on [[2008-02-26]]</ref> 

Originally there appears to have been no association of tartans with specific clans; instead, highland tartans were produced to various designs by local weavers and any identification was purely regional, but the idea of a clan-specific tartan gained currency in the late 18th century and in 1815 the [[Highland Society of London]] began the naming of clan-specific tartans. In fact, many of today's clan tartans are the work of a 19th-century forgery known as the ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'', but despite this, the designs are still highly regarded and they continue to serve their purpose to identify the clan in question.

;Crest badge
{{See|Scottish crest badge|List of crest badges used by Scottish clan members}}
A sign of allegiance to a certain clan chief is the wearing of a crest badge. The crest badge suitable for a clansman or clanswoman consists of the chief's [[heraldic crest]] encircled with a strap and buckle and which contains the chief's heraldic [[motto]] or [[Slogan (heraldry)|slogan]]. Although it is common to speak of "clan crests" there is no such thing.<ref name="lyon-court.com--242">[http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/242.html Crests] ''[[Lyon Court]]''.

;Clan badge
{{See|Clan badge}}
Clan badges, are another means of showing one's allegiance to a Scottish clan. These badges, sometimes called plant badges, consist of a sprig of a particular plant. They are usually worn in a bonnet behind the Scottish crest badge, they can also be attached at the shoulder of a lady's tartan [[sash]], or be tied to a pole and used as a [[heraldic standard|standard]]. Many clans which are connected historically or that occupied lands in the same general area, share the same clan badge. According to popular lore clan badges were used by Scottish clans as a form of identification in battle. However, many of the badges attributed to clans today are completely unsuitable for even modern clan gatherings. Clan badges are commonly referred to as the original clan symbol, however [[Thomas Innes of Learney]] claimed the [[heraldic flag]]s of clan chief's would have been the earliest means of identifying Scottish clans in battle or at large gatherings.<ref>Adam; Innes of Learney (1970), pp. 541–543.</ref>

==Clan lists and maps==
The revival of interest, and demand for clan ancestry, has led to the production of lists and maps covering the whole of Scotland giving clan names and showing territories, sometimes with the appropriate [[tartan]]s. While some lists and clan maps confine their area to the Highlands, others also show Lowland clans or families. Territorial areas and allegiances changed over time, and there are also differing decisions on which (smaller) clans and families should be omitted. Some alternative online sources are listed in the ''External links'' section below.

This list of Clans contains clans registered with the [[Lyon Court|Lord Lyon Court]]. 
The Lord Lyon Court defines a clan or family as a legally recognised group, but does not differentiate between Families and Clans as it recognises both terms as being interchangeable. Clans or families thought to have had a Chief in the past but not currently recognised by the Lord Lyon are listed at [[Armigerous clan]]s.
