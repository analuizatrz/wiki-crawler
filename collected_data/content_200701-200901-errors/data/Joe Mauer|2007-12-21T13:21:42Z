Born in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], Mauer was a three-sport athlete, baseball, football, and basketball, for Saint Paul's [[Cretin-Derham Hall High School|Cretin-Derham Hall]] Raiders. Mauer attended the same high school as Baseball Hall of Famer and former Minnesota Twin, [[Paul Molitor]].<ref name="sports"/> Molitor has said that Mauer "has one of the best swings he had ever seen".<ref name="joe"/> He was even good enough to make it into a [[Sports Illustrated]] issue as a "Face In The Crowd". A stand-out in baseball, Mauer was struck out only once during his high school career, while hitting .605 during his senior season.<ref name="joe"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://citypages.com/databank/27/1335/article14491.asp | title=The Kid Who Struck Out Joe Mauer | author=Jim Walsh | date=2006-7-5 | publisher=CityPages.com}}</ref> He also set a Minnesota high school record by homering in seven consecutive games.<ref name="sports">{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/baseball/2001-06-28-mauer-honored.htm | title=Mauer Honored | author=Tom Wier | date=2001-6-29 | publisher=USA Today}}</ref> Mauer caught for the Team USA Junior National team from 1998 to 2000 and hit .522 during his final year on the team. He was voted best hitter at the world tournament in Panama in 2000. In 2001, Mauer was voted the Minnesota District V Player of the Year. 

During his senior season as the Raiders' quarterback, Mauer completed 178 of 288 passes for 3,022 yards and 41 [[touchdown]]s with only two [[Interception (football)|interceptions]] and finished his two-year career as a starter with 5,528 yards and 73 touchdowns.<ref name="joe"/> He led the Raiders to two consecutive Class 5A state championship game appearances, winning the title in 1999, and once threw seven touchdown passes in a single playoff game against the Hopkins Royals.

==Professional career== 
Mauer was part of the United States' roster at the 2003 [[All-Star Futures Game]] at [[US Cellular Field]] before being promoted to the Twins' roster in [[2004 in baseball|2004]] after his predecessor, [[A.J. Pierzynski]], was traded to the [[San Francisco Giants]] in the 2003 off-season. Mauer went [[batting average|2 for 3]] in his Major League debut, hitting a single off [[Rafael Betancourt]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]] for his first major-league hit.

A knee injury to his left [[medial meniscus]] on April 7, 2004 required surgery and sidelined Mauer for over a month. After a rehabilitation stint with the Twins' AAA affiliate [[Rochester Red Wings]], Mauer returned to the Twins' lineup in June. In July, pain and swelling in his knee forced an early end to Mauer's 2004 season. 

Following his injury-shortened 2004, Mauer signed a contract worth $5.7 million with the Twins on January 24, 2005. In 2005, Mauer returned to the Twins' lineup for his first full major league season and had 144 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in 131 games, ending the year with an average of .294.

In 2006, Mauer's performance throughout the months of May and June gathered attention from the national media. He recorded a .528 average over the first ten days of June and hit .452 over the course of the month.<ref name="gamelog">{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/gamelog?playerId=5378 | title=ESPN.com Gamelog | pulisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref> He was also the first player  since [[Mike Piazza]] in 1997 to reach base four or more times for five consecutive games.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2479115 | author=Elias Sports Bureau, Inc. | title=Elias Says... | date=2006-6-11}}</ref> On June 12, Mauer was named the American League Player of the Week by Major League Baseball for his performance the week of June 4-11, during which he hit .625 (15-for-24) with 5 doubles, 4 RBI and 2 stolen bases.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060612&content_id=1501971&vkey=news_min&fext=.jsp&c_id=min | author=D.C. Reeves | title=Surging Mauer takes top AL honors | date=2006-6-12 | publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}</ref>

Mauer recorded his first five-RBI game [[June 26]], against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].<ref name="gamelog"/> Mauer followed that up with his first career five-hit game [[June 27]], also against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].<ref name="gamelog"/>He was also named [[Player of the Month]] for June after batting .452 with a .624 [[slugging percentage]] and .528 [[on base percentage]], 11 [[Double (baseball)|doubles]], 14 [[RBI]] and 18 runs. Along with [[Johan Santana]] (Pitcher of the Month) and [[Francisco Liriano]] (Rookie of the Month), Mauer was part of the first-ever single-team sweep of MLB's three monthly awards.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060702&content_id=1535971&vkey=news_min&fext=.jsp&c_id=min  | title=Twins       te monthly AL honors | author=Jason Brummond | date=2006-7-2 | publisher= [[MLB.com]]}}</ref> On July 2, Mauer was selected by the players to his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/allstar06/news/story?id=2512107 | title=American League All-Star Roster | date=2006-7-7 | publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref> Mauer appeared on the cover of the August 7, 2006 issue of [[Sports Illustrated]].<ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/2006/0807.html</ref>

Mauer finished the 2006 regular season with a .347 batting average, edging the Yankees' [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Robinson Cano]] to win the American League batting title and become the first-ever American League catcher to win the crown and the first catcher to claim the title since [[Ernie Lombardi]] in [[1942 in baseball|1942]] with the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]].  His .347 average was the highest in the American League, a feat not achieved by the previous three catchers to win NL batting titles.<ref name="ba"/><ref name="base"/> He was the youngest to win a batting title since Alex Rodriguez in [[1996 in baseball|1996]].<ref name="base"/>

After going 2-for-4 in the last game of the 2006 regular season, Mauer confessed to reporters, "When I told you I wasn’t thinking about the batting title?  I was lying.  I’ve never been that nervous in my life.  I haven’t felt anything like that since Opening Day as a rookie.”

Mauer won his first [[Silver Slugger]] award in 2006, announced on [[November 10]] [[2006]], along with teammate [[Justin Morneau]], who also won a Silver Slugger award that year.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2656967 | title=Red Sox LF Ramirez wins ninth Silver Slugger award | date=2006-10-10 | publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>

On February 11, [[2007]], Mauer agreed to a four-year, $33 million contract with the Twins to avoid arbitration. The deal ensures that Mauer will remain in Minnesota long enough to play in the Twins' [[Twins Ballpark|new outdoor stadium in 2010]].<ref name="dollar">{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2762203 | title=Mauer, Twins avoid arbitration with four-year deal | date=2007-2-11 | publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>

On July 21, 2007, Mauer hit his first career [[inside-the-park home run]] against [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] pitcher [[Scot Shields]].  It was his fifth home run of the season, and there were two players on base when he hit the homer. It was the first inside-the-park home run by a catcher since [[Kelly Stinnett]] did it for the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in 2005. <ref>{{cite web | title=Mauer's inside-the-park HR Twin's first since 2001 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2007-7-21 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270721109}}</ref>
