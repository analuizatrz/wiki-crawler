'''Iron Man''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Born '''Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark''', he suffers a severe heart injury during a kidnapping and is forced to build a destructive weapon. He instead creates a [[Powered exoskeleton|power suit]] to save his life and help protect the world as the [[superhero]] Iron Man.<ref> Tales of Suspense #39 </ref> He is a wealthy industrialist and genius inventor who created military weapons and whose metal suit is laden with technological devices that enable him to fight crime.

The character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #39 (March 1963), and was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and artists [[Don Heck]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore [[Cold War]] themes, particularly the role of American technology and business in the fight against [[communism]].  Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have gradually removed the Cold War themes, replacing them with more contemporary concerns such as corporate crime and terrorism.

Throughout most of the comics history, Iron Man has been a member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and has been featured in several incarnations of his own various comic book series. The character has been adapted for several animated TV shows, as well as for the 2008 live action film ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' where he is played by [[Robert Downey Jr]].

Iron Man first appeared in 13- to 18-page stories in ''Tales of Suspense'', which featured [[anthology]] [[science fiction]] and [[supernatural]] stories. The character's original costume was a bulky grey armor, which later turned golden in his second story (issue #40, April 1963), and then redesigned again as a sleeker red-and-golden armor starting in issue #48 (Dec. 1963), drawn by [[Steve Ditko]]. In his premiere, Iron Man was an [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] hero, defeating various Vietnamese agents; Lee later regretted this early focus.<ref name="origins 45"/><ref name="Nation">{{cite book|title=Comic Book Nation|last=Wright|first=Bradford|authorlink= |year=2001|publisher=John Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore MD|isbn=0-8018-6514-X|pages=336}}</ref> Throughout the character’s [[comic book]] series, technological advancement and [[National security|national defense]] were constant themes for Iron Man, but later issues developed Stark into a more complex and vulnerable character as they depicted his battle with [[alcoholism]] and other personal difficulties. 

From issue #59 (Nov. 1964) to its final issue #99 (March 1968), the anthological [[science-fiction]] backup stories in ''Tales of Suspense'' were replaced by a feature starring the superhero [[Captain America]]. After issue #99 (March 1968), the book's title was changed to ''Captain America''.  Iron Man stories moved to the title ''[[Iron Man and Sub-Mariner]]'' in April 1968, before the "Golden Avenger"<ref name="iron man spotlight">{{cite web|author=Beard, Jim|date=2008-02-27|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/moviestories.424.Spotlight_on_Iron_Man|title=Spotlight on Iron Man/Tony Stark|work=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]|accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref> made his solo debut with ''The Invincible Iron Man'' #1 (May 1968).

Writers have updated the war in which Stark is injured. In the original 1963 story, it was [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. Later, in the 1990s, it was updated to be the first [[Gulf War]],<ref name="emerging pop">{{cite web|author=Lewis, A. David|authorlink=A.

However, his time with the Asian [[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientist Ho Yinsen is consistent through nearly all incarnations of the Iron Man origin, depicting Stark and Yinsen building the original armor together. One exception is the [[direct-to-DVD]] animated feature film ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]'', in which the armor Stark uses to escape his captors is not the first Iron Man suit.

==Thematic origins==
Like other [[Stan Lee]] creations in the early years of [[Marvel Comics]], such as ''[[The Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'', the ''Iron Man'' story, in its original manifestations, was an exploration of [[Cold War]] themes.  Where ''The Fantastic Four'' and ''The Incredible Hulk'' focused on the American domestic and government/bureaucratic responses to Cold War pressures, respectively, ''Iron Man'' looked to industry's role in the struggle against communism.  Tony Stark's real-life model [[Howard Hughes]] was an archetype of American individualism as well as a significant defense contractor who helped develop new weapons technologies.<ref name="JournalofPopCulture">Robert Genter, "'With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility': Cold War Culture and the Birth of Marvel Comics", ''The Journal of Popular Culture'', vol. 40, issue 6, pp. 953-978, December 2007.  pp. 965-969.</ref>

Tony Stark/Iron Man's reliance on technology and intelligence, rather than the chance transformations of many other superheroes, reinforced the American faith in technological solutions to the military, political and ideological problems of the Cold War.  Stark is an idealized portrait of the American inventor.  By the 1960s, military weapons development was firmly in the realm of [[Big Science]], with little role for the lone inventor.  Issues of autonomy and government intervention in research and questions of loyalty&mdash;which real-life American physicists and engineers were also facing, if less dramatically&mdash;are prominent themes in early ''Iron Man'' storylines.<ref name="JournalofPopCulture" />

According to historian Robert Genter, Stark is [[emasculated]] by his loss of autonomy as an inventor&mdash;a blow to his manhood symbolized by his chest wound&mdash;and "''Iron Man'' centers on Stark's inability to reconcile with this wound to his masculinity."<ref name="JournalofPopCulture" />  Stan Lee used the playboy side of Stark to restore the character's sense of masculinity.  Stark conquers women&mdash;either romantically or physically, and with female supervillains frequently both&mdash;and, writes Genter, "follows the lead of other cultural and literary figures such as [[Ian Fleming]], [[Mickey Spillane]], and [[Norman Mailer]] who made unregulated sexuality a form of authenticity."<ref name="JournalofPopCulture" />

==Fictional character biography==
{{in-universe}}
===Origins===
Anthony Stark was born on [[Long Island]], the son of [[Howard Stark]], a wealthy industrialist and head of [[Stark Industries]], and Maria Stark. Tony is a boy genius, entering [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] at the age of 15 to study [[electrical engineering]], and graduating [[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]. After his parents' accidental deaths in a car crash, he inherits his father's company.

While observing the effects of his experimental technologies on the [[United States|American]] war effort, Tony Stark is injured by a booby trap and captured by the enemy, who then orders him to design weapons for them. However, Stark's injuries are dire and shrapnel in his chest threatens to pierce his heart. His fellow prisoner, [[Ho Yinsen]], a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[physicist]] whose work Stark had greatly admired during college, constructs a [[magnetism|magnetic]] chest plate to keep the shrapnel from reaching Stark's heart, keeping him alive. Stark uses the workshop to design and construct in secret a suit of [[powered exoskeleton|powered armor]]. Stark uses the armor to escape, although Yinsen dies during the attempt. Stark takes revenge on his kidnappers, then heads back to rejoin the American forces. Along the way he meets a wounded [[United States|American]] [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] helicopter pilot, [[War Machine|James "Rhodey" Rhodes]].

Back home, Stark discovers the shrapnel lodged in his chest cannot be removed without killing him, and he is forced to wear the armor's chestplate beneath his clothes to act as a regulator for his heart. He must also recharge the chestplate every day or else risk the shrapnel killing him. The cover for Iron Man is that he is Stark's [[bodyguard]] and corporate mascot. To that end, Iron Man fights threats to his company, [[Communism|Communist]] opponents such as the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], the [[Crimson Dynamo]] and the [[Titanium Man]] as well as independent villains like the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]. No one suspects Stark of being Iron Man as he cultivates an image as a rich playboy and industrialist. Two notable members of Stark's supporting cast at this point are his personal chauffeur [[Happy Hogan|Harold "Happy" Hogan]] and secretary [[Pepper Potts|Virginia "Pepper" Potts]], to both of whom he eventually reveals his dual identity.  Meanwhile, Jim Rhodes would find his own niche as Stark's personal pilot of extraordinary skill and daring.
The comic took an anti-Communist stance in its early years, which was softened as opposition rose to the [[Vietnam War]]<ref name="origins 45" />. This change evolved in a series of stories with Stark profoundly reconsidering his political opinions and the morality of manufacturing weapons for the military. Stark, however, often shows himself to be occasionally arrogant and willing to let the ends justify the means<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24317684 Quiz: Is your 'Iron Man' knowledge iron-clad? - Movies - MSNBC.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://graphicpolicy.com/tag/iron-man/ iron man «<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. This leads to personal conflicts with the people around him, both in his civilian and superhero identities. Stark uses his personal fortune not only to outfit his own armor but to develop weapons for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and other technologies such as the [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|Quinjets]] used by the Avengers, and the image inducers used by the [[X-Men]].

Eventually, Stark's [[heart condition]] is discovered by the public and cured with an artificial [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]]. However, Stark also develops a serious dependency on [[alcoholism|alcohol]]. The first time it becomes a problem is when Stark discovers that the national security agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] has been buying a controlling interest in his company in order to ensure Stark's continued weapons development for them. At the same time, Stark's business rival [[Justin Hammer]] hires several supervillains to attack Stark. At one point, the Iron Man armor is even taken over and used to murder a diplomat. Although Iron Man is not immediately under suspicion, Stark is forced to hand the armor over to the authorities. Eventually Stark and Rhodes, who is now his personal pilot and confidant, track down and defeat those responsible, although Hammer would return to bedevil Stark again. With the support of his then-girlfriend, [[Bethany Cabe]], his friends and his employees, Stark pulls through these crises and overcomes his dependency on alcohol.

Some time later, a ruthless rival, [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], manipulates Stark emotionally into a serious relapse. As a result, Stark loses control of Stark International, becomes a homeless alcoholic vagrant and gives up his armored identity to Rhodes, who becomes the new Iron Man for a lengthy period of time. Eventually, Stark recovers and joins a new startup, Circuits Maximus. Stark concentrates on new technological designs, including building a new set of armor as part of his recuperative therapy. Rhodes continues to act as Iron Man but steadily grows more aggressive and paranoid, due to the armor not being calibrated properly for his use. Eventually Rhodes goes on a rampage, and Stark has to don the prototype silver centurion suit to stop him. When Circuits Maximus comes under assault from Stane, Stark uses the completed next-generation silver centurian armor to confront Stane in personal combat. Stark's skill proves superior over Stane's unpracticed use of his own variant suit (known as the [[Iron Monger]]) and Stark regains his company when Stane commits suicide rather than be captured.

===Late 1980s and 1990s===
In an attempt to stop other people from misusing his designs, Stark goes about disabling other armored heroes and villains who are using suits based on the Iron Man technology, the designs of which were stolen by his enemy [[Spymaster (comics)#Spymaster I|Spymaster]]. His quest to destroy all instances of the stolen technology severely hurts his reputation as Iron Man. After attacking and disabling a series of minor villains such as [[Stilt-Man]], he attacks and defeats the government operative known as [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]]. The situation worsens when Stark realizes that Stingray's armor does not incorporate any of his designs. He publicly "fires" Iron Man while covertly pursuing his agenda. He uses the cover story of wanting to help disable the rogue Iron Man to infiltrate and disable the armor of the S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives known as the [[Mandroid]]s, and disabling the armor of the [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]], in the process allowing some of the villains that they guard to escape. This leads [[Federal government of the United States|the United States government]] to declare Iron Man a danger and an outlaw. Iron Man then travels to Russia where he inadvertently causes the death of the Soviet [[Titanium Man#Titanium Man II - The Gremlin|Titanium Man]] during a fight. Returning to the U.S he faces an enemy commissioned by the government named [[Firepower (comics)|Firepower]]. Unable to defeat him head on, Stark fakes Iron Man's demise, intending to retire the suit forever. When Firepower goes rogue, Stark creates a new suit, claiming that a new person is in the armor.

Stark's health continues to deteriorate, and he discovers the armor's [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] interface is causing irreversible damage to his [[nervous system]]. His condition is aggravated by a failed attempt on his life by a mentally unbalanced former lover which injures his spine, paralyzing him. Stark has a nerve chip implanted into his spine to regain his mobility.  Still, Stark's nervous system continues its slide towards failure, and he constructs a "skin" made up of artificial nerve circuitry to assist it. Stark also begins to pilot a remote-controlled Iron Man armor, but when faced with the Masters of Silence, the [[telepresence]] suit proves inadequate. Stark then designs a more heavily armed version of the suit to wear, the "Variable Threat Response Battle Suit", which becomes known as the [[War Machine|War Machine armor]]. Ultimately, the damage to his nervous system becomes too extensive. Faking his death, Stark places himself in [[suspended animation]] to heal as Rhodes takes over the running of Stark Enterprises and the mantle of Iron Man using the War Machine armor. Stark ultimately makes a full recovery by using a chip to reprogram himself and reassumes the Iron Man identity. When Rhodes learns that Stark has manipulated his friends by faking his own death, he becomes enraged and the two friends part ways, Rhodes continuing as War Machine in a solo career. 

The story arc "The Crossing" reveals Iron Man as a traitor among the Avengers' ranks, due to years of manipulation by the time-traveling dictator [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Stark, as a sleeper agent in Kang's thrall, kills Marilla, the nanny of [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver's]] daughter Luna, as well as Rita DeMara, the female [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]], then an ally of the Avengers. (The miniseries ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' later [[retroactive continuity|retcon]]s these events as the work of a disguised [[Immortus]], not Kang, and that the mental control had gone back only a few months).

Needing help to defeat both Stark and the ostensible Kang, the team travels back in time to recruit a teenaged Tony Stark from an alternate timeline to assist them. The young Stark steals an Iron Man suit in order to aid the Avengers against his older self. The sight of his younger self shocks the older Stark enough for him to regain momentary control of his actions, and he sacrifices his life to stop Kang. The young Stark later builds his own suit to become the new Iron Man, and, remaining in the present day, gains legal control of "his" company.

During the battle with the creature called [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], the teenaged Stark dies, along with many other superheroes. However, [[Franklin Richards]] preserves these "dead" heroes in the "[[Heroes Reborn]]" pocket universe, in which Tony Stark is once again an adult hero; Franklin recreates the heroes in the pocket universe in the forms he is most familiar with rather than what they are at the present. The reborn adult Stark, upon returning to the normal Marvel Universe, merges with the original Stark, who had died during "The Crossing," but was resurrected by Franklin Richards. This new Tony Stark possesses the memories of both the original and teenage Tony Starks, and thus considers himself to be essentially both of them. With the aid of the law firm [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Nelson & Murdock]], he successfully regains his fortune and, with Stark Enterprises having been sold to the Fujikawa Corporation following Stark's death, sets up a new company, Stark Solutions. He also returns from the pocket universe with a restored and healthy heart. After the Avengers reform, Stark demands a hearing be convened to look into his actions just prior to the Onslaught incident. Cleared of wrongdoing, he rejoins the Avengers.

===2000s===
At one point, Stark's armor itself becomes sentient, despite fail-safes to prevent its increasingly sophisticated computer systems from doing so. Initially, Stark welcomes this "living" armor, as it has improved tactical abilities, but soon the armor's behavior begins to grow more aggressive, and it even kills. Eventually, the armor reaches the point where it wants to join with Stark and eventually replace him. Stark finds he cannot defeat the armor, but in the final confrontation on a desert island, Stark suffers another heart attack. To save its creator's life, the armor gives up part of its components to give Stark a new, artificial heart, sacrificing its own existence. The new heart solves Stark's health problems, but it does not have an internal power supply, so Stark becomes once again dependent on periodic recharging. The sentient armor incident so disturbs Stark that he goes back to using an early model version of his armor for a while, lacking the sophistication of the sentient version and thus unlikely to result in a repeat of the same problem. He also dabbles with using liquid metal circuitry known as S.K.I.N. that will form itself into a protective shell around his body, but eventually returns to more conventional hard metal armors. 

During this time, Stark engages in a romance with [[Rumiko Fujikawa]], (first appearance in ''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #4), a wealthy heiress and daughter of the man who had taken over his company during the "Heroes Reborn" period. An intelligent and resourceful woman, she nonetheless begins the relationship in part to rebel against her stern father, who disapproves of Stark. Her relationship with Stark endures many highs and lows, including an infidelity with Stark's rival, Tiberius Stone, in part because the fun-loving Rumiko believes that Stark is too serious and dull. Their relationship ends with Rumiko's death at the hands of an Iron Man impostor in vol. 3, #87.

In ''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #55 (July 2002), Stark publicly reveals his dual identity as Iron Man, not realizing that by doing so, he has invalidated the agreements protecting his armor from government duplication (since those contracts state that the Iron Man armor would be used by an employee of Tony Stark, not by Stark himself). When he discovers that the [[Military of the United States|United States military]] is again using his technology, Stark, rather than confront them as before, accepts a [[President of the United States|Presidential]] appointment as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. In this way, he hopes to monitor and direct how his designs are used. He is forced to resign after launching into a tirade against the [[Latveria]]n ambassador at the [[United Nations]], being manipulated by the mentally imbalanced [[Scarlet Witch]]. Following this, the Scarlet Witch causes the destruction of the Avengers mansion and the death of several Avengers; Stark claims publicly that he will stand down as Iron Man. The "new" Iron Man remains Stark; however, the catastrophic events that preceded this, combined with Stark's assertion, convinces the public that Iron Man and Stark are now different people. Stark leaves the wreckage of Avengers Mansion as it is, and unveils [[Stark Tower]], a state-of-the-art office building that becomes headquarters for the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] team, of which he is a member.

The miniseries ''Iron Man: The Inevitable'' reintroduces the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]], the [[Living Laser]] and [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]]. Presenting the change in status quo — the focus of Iron Man stories shifting from superhero-ism to political and industrial tales — as Iron Man having elevated himself to a new place in his life where he is "beyond" apprehending supervillains, the miniseries sees a resentful Spymaster conspire to drag Iron Man back to that [[plebeian]] level.

''[[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|New Avengers: Illuminati]]'' #1 (June 2006) reveals that years before, in the wake of the [[Kree-Skrull War]], Stark initiates a meeting at the palace of the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] in [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]] with [[Professor X]], [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Black Bolt]], [[Doctor Strange]], and [[Namor]] to form a clandestine, unnamed group (dubbed the "Illuminati" by Marvel) to devise strategy and policy regarding overarching menaces (Black Panther rejects membership and derides the other heroes for joining). Stark's original goal is to create a governing body for all superheroes in the world to answer to. However, the different beliefs and philosophies, besides the fact that many heroes choose to conceal their real identities, makes Stark's plan impractical. Despite this, the group agrees to share vital information.

Learning of the government's plans to instigate a [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] that would force super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government and register as licensed agents, Tony Stark at first seeks to defeat the proposal. His opinion of the Act later changes when he sees it as a means to achieve the goals of the Illuminati. Of his fellow Illuminati members, only Reed Richards, of the [[Fantastic Four]], and [[Black Bolt]], king of the [[Inhumans]], agree with Stark, who becomes the figurehead of the Registration Act. Many superpowered individuals opposed to registration rally behind [[Captain America]], leading to a destructive "[[Civil War (comic book)|superhero civil war]]" that ends with Captain America standing down to prevent further collateral damage. Stark is appointed the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.848?utm_campaign=front+page+tracking&utm_source=main+graphic&utm_medium=small+graphic+link&utm_content=/news/comicstories.848|Previews:|title=The Initiative - Marvel.com news|accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref> and also revives the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Shortly afterward, Captain America is assassinated while in custody, leading Stark to great guilt and misgivings.

After Tony Stark survives an encounter with [[Ultron]] taking over his body, he is confronted in the hospital by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], holding the corpse of a [[Skrull]] posing as [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]].  Becoming keenly aware of the upcoming invasion of the Skrulls, Tony gathers the Illuminati and reveals the corpse to them, declaring they're at war.  After [[Black Bolt]] reveals himself as a Skrull and is killed by [[Namor]], a squadron of Skrulls attack, forcing Tony to evacuate the other Illuminati members and destroy the area, killing all the Skrulls.  Realizing they're incapable of trusting each other, the members all separate to form individual plans for the oncoming invasion.

Soon after, a "[[Venom (comics)|Venom]] virus" hits New York, causing New York citizens and superheroes to be covered in symbiotes.  After the battle, Iron Man learns the virus came from [[Latveria]] and launches a full-scale assault on its monarch, [[Doctor Doom]].  During the battle, Doom, Iron Man, and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] are transported through time via Doom's broken time platform. Doom and Stark form an alliance in an attempt to return to the proper time without being seen or causing any actions that could alter their future and try to find a way to get a hold of the time platform at the [[Fantastic Four]]'s headquarters. Thanks to the Sentry's memory spell, which erased knowledge of his existence from the minds of the public, they are able to return to the present and later on capture Doom and send him to the Negative Zone prison.  Soon after, all of Stark's technology is jeopardized by the [[Skrull]] empire as a part of their [[Secret Invasion|invasion]], causing Stark to rebuild his armor from scratch to fight back.  Stark must also deal with the murderous yet genius [[Ezekiel Stane]], son of Obadiah Stane.

While in the Savage Land with the Mighty Avengers, Iron Man's armor is compromised and he goes to the Mutate's base to build himself a new set of armor.  While he is there, Spider-Woman shows up, praising Stark for his efforts and informing him that he is a Skrull sleeper agent named Kr'Ali. <ref>''Secret Invasion'' #3</ref> It is later proven by Mr. Fantastic, who finds a way to reveal Skrulls for who they are, that Iron Man is not a Skrull like Veranke said he was.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===Armor===
{{See also|Iron Man's armor}}
Iron Man possesses [[powered exoskeleton|powered armor]] that gives him superhuman strength and durability, flight, and an array of weapons. The armor is invented and (with occasional short-term exceptions) worn by Stark. Other people who have assumed the Iron Man identity include Stark's long-time partner and best friend [[War Machine|James Rhodes]]; close associates [[Happy Hogan|Harold "Happy" Hogan]]; Eddie March; and (briefly) [[Guardsman (comics)#Guardsman (Michael O'Brien)|Michael O'Brien]].

The weapons systems of the suit have changed over the years, but Iron Man's standard offensive weapons have always been the [[repulsor rays]] that are fired from the palms of his [[gauntlet]]s. Other weapons built into various incarnations of the armor include: the [[uni-beam projector]] in its chest; pulse bolts (that pick up only [[kinetic energy]] along the way; so the farther they travel, the harder they hit); an [[electromagnetic pulse]] generator; and a defensive energy shield that can be extended up to 360 degrees. Other capabilities include: generating ultra-[[freon]] (i.e., a freeze-beam); creating and manipulating [[magnetic field]]s; emitting sonic blasts; and projecting 3-dimensional [[hologram]]s (to create decoys). 

In addition to the general-purpose model he wears, Stark has developed several specialized [[space suit|suits]] for [[spaceflight|space travel]], [[atmospheric diving suit|deep-sea diving]], [[stealth technology|stealth]], and other situations. Stark has modified suits, like the [[Iron_Man%27s_armor#Hulkbuster_Armor.2C_Mk_I|Hulkbuster]] heavy armor. The Hulkbuster armor is composed of add-ons to his so-called modular armor, designed to enhance its strength and durability enough to rival that of [[The Incredible Hulk]]. A later model, designed for use against [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], is modeled on the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] and uses a mystical powersource. Stark also develops an electronics pack during the Armor Wars that, when attached to armors that use Stark technologies, will burn-out those components -- rendering the suit useless. This pack is ineffective on later models, however.

===Powers===
For a time, due to an artificial nervous system installed after he suffered extensive damage to his nervous system, Stark had superhumanly acute sensory perceptions as well as extraordinary awareness of the physical processes within his own body. This is no longer a part of the character's powers.

After being critically injured during a battle with the Extremis-enhanced Mallen, Stark injects his nervous system with a modified techno-organic virus (the Extremis process) that not only saves his life, it gives him the ability to store the inner layers of the Iron Man armor in the hollows of his bones as well as control it through direct brain impulses. Stark can control the layer of the armor underneath his skin and make it emerge from numerous exit points around his limbs as a gold-colored neural interface under-sheath. While in this form, Stark has technopathic control of the armor and can suit up at any time, calling the larger components to him. Furthermore, the Extremis process has increased his body's recuperative and healing abilities. He is also able to connect remotely to external communications systems such as satellites, cellular phones, and computers throughout the world. Because the armor's operating system is now directly connected to Stark's nervous system, its response time has been significantly improved.

===Skills===
Tony Stark is an inventive genius who graduated with advanced degrees in physics and engineering at 21<ref>Iron Man: The Legend, 1996</ref> and further developed his knowledge ranging from [[artificial intelligence]] to [[quantum mechanics]] as time progressed.

In addition, Stark possesses great business and political acumen. On multiple occasions he reacquired control of his companies after losing them, and leading corporate takeovers.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol.1 Issue 210</ref>

Stark received hand to hand combat training from [[Happy Hogan]] (a professional [[Boxing|Boxer]]), [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] (a [[Marines|Marine]]) and [[Captain America]] himself.
