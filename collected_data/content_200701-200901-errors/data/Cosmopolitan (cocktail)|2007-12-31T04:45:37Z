A '''Cosmopolitan''' is a [[cocktail]] made with [[vodka]], [[Triple Sec]], [[Cranberry|cranberry juice]], and fresh-squeezed [[lime (fruit)|lime]] juice or sweetened lime juice. Informally, it is referred to as a '''Cosmo'''. 

==History==
This origins of the Cosmopolitan are somewhat disputed. According to the [http://www.iba-world.com/english/ International Bartenders Association] the original recipe is based on [[Absolut Vodka|Absolut]] Citron, a lemon-[[flavored vodka]].

Most sources credit [[South Beach, Florida]] bartender Cheryl Cook with the original creation.<ref name="FoodMaven">Schwartz, Arthur.

Her original recipes called for "Absolut Citron, a splash of [[Triple Sec]], a drop of roses lime and just enough cranberry to make it oh so pretty in pink."<ref name="Cook" />

The next person involved in the creation of the drink was Toby Cecchini<ref name="Cook" /><ref>Cecchini, Toby. "Cosmopolitan: A Bartender's Life". New York: Broadway, 2003.</ref> of [[Manhattan]]. While working at The Odeon in [[1987]]/[[1988]], Cecchini worked from a poorly described version of Cook's original drink, and developed a slightly different version using Cointreau and fresh-squeezed lime juice. Cecchini's version has become the common standard method for preparing the drink.<ref name="IBA">[http://www.iba-world.com/english/ International Bartenders Association] Official Cocktail [http://www.iba-world.com/english/cocktails/cosmopolitan.php recipe].

The Cosmopolitan gained popularity fairly quickly, traveling from Miami to San Francisco, to New York.<ref name="Cook" /> It really gained in popularity in the [[1990s]], and was further popularized among young women by its frequent mention on the television program ''[[Sex and the City]]''.

The Cosmopolitan is a descendant of the Cold War's Cape Codder and the respectable sibling of the Kamikaze. In the 1970's the gay community in Provincetown, Massachusetts, is credited with its invention. The popularity of the Cosmopolitan quickly traveled from New England to New York and then across the country. The original recipe calls for Vodka, Roses Lime juice, Contreau, cranberry juice, lemon twist.

==Preparation and serving==
{{Wikibooks|Bartending|Cocktails/Cosmopolitan|Cosmopolitan}}
The Cosmopolitan is usually served in a large [[cocktail glass]], also called a ''martini glass''. For this reason, the drink is sometimes mistakenly categorized as a type of [[martini (cocktail)|martini]].

Mix 2 parts lemon vodka to one part triple sec combined with one part cranberry and the juice of half a lime.  Cointreau may be used but is twice the price of a "standard" triple sec.  Drinkers may think this is being cheap, but any bartender who knows the trade will know the taste is cleaner and more citrusy.  Gran Marnier produces a very sweet and cloying version and should be avoided.  The cranberry merely adds colour and should not dilute the alcohol content of the drink.

A wedge of lemon or lime, or a twist of orange or lemon peel, are commonly used to [[Cocktail garnish|garnish]].  Traditionally a coin sized piece of orange should be "flamed" across the top of the drink.  This coats the drink with a slick of citrus oil, but also produces a flame, which is great for bar "circus", and usually gets many admiring glances.

==Variations==
* One variation is to squeeze a lime wedge into the chilled [[cocktail glass]] instead of including it with the [[ingredient]]s to be [[Cocktail shaker|shaken]].
* The original version calls for [[Rose's lime juice]] instead of fresh lime juice, and [[Triple Sec]] instead of [[Cointreau]].
* [[Sour mix]] may be substituted for either type of lime juice.
* A blue cosmopolitan may be made by using white cranberry juice instead of standard red juice, and blue [[curaçao liqueur|curaçao]] in place of the triple sec.
* A Cosmocello substitutes [[limoncello]] for the lime juice.

==Popular culture==
* [[Demeter Fragrance Library]] has created a cologne intended to smell like the Cosmopolitan cocktail.
* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]'s ''[[Sex and the City]]'' character, [[Carrie Bradshaw]], commonly orders the drink when out with her girlfriends. In the episode "[[Sex and the Country]]", Carrie goes to a [[drive-through]] diner and jokingly orders, "A cheese burger, large fries and a cosmopolitan please?".
*In [[The Office (US)|The Office]] episode, "[[The Convention (The Office episode)|The Convention]]", Michael Scott makes cosmos in his hotel room.  In a deleted scene, he claims ''"Cosmos!  Just like [[Carrie Bradshaw]]"''
*In the Simpsons episode [[Midnight Towboy]], Homer orders Moe's fanciest drink - a Lobsterpolitan.
