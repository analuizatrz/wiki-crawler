The [[color|colour]] '''orange''' occurs between [[red]] and [[yellow]] in the visible [[Optical spectrum|spectrum]] at a [[wavelength]] of about 585 – 620 [[nanometre|nm]], and has a [[hue]] of 30° in [[HSV colour space]]. The [[complementary colour]] of orange is [[Azure (color)|azure]], a slightly [[green]]ish [[blue]]. With [[pigment]]s such as [[paint]]s or [[ink]]s, a mixture of the subtractive [[primary colour]]s in the proportion of 75% yellow and 25% [[magenta]] produce the [[secondary colour]] orange. Orange pigments are largely in the [[ochre]] or [[Cadmium pigments|cadmium]] families, and absorb mostly blue light.

== Orange (colour wheel) ==
At above right is the [[colour wheel]] colour ''orange''. This is the colour orange as defined in [[HSV colour space]]; that is, it is the hue midway between red and yellow.  It is numerically halfway between red and yellow in a [[gamma correction|gamma-compressed]] [[RGB colour space]], and is diametrically opposite [[azure (color)|azure]], on the HSV colour wheel.

== Etymology of ''orange'' ==
[[Image:Ambersweet oranges.jpg|thumb|[[Orange (fruit)|Oranges]]]]
{{main|Orange (word)}}

The colour is named after the [[orange (fruit)|orange fruit]], introduced to Europe via the Indo-European word ''nāranja''. Before this was introduced to the [[English language|English]]-speaking world, the colour was referred to (in [[Old English language|Old English]]) as ''geoluhread'', which [[translation|translates]] into [[Modern English]] as ''yellow-red''.

The first recorded use of ''orange'' as a colour name in [[English language|English]] was in 1512,<ref> Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 200 </ref> in the court of King [[Henry VIII]].

==Biological detection==
===Human===
A woman named Susan Hogan was born with an extra set of [[Cone cell|cone]]s that are sensitive in the orange range, as well having the red, green, and blue cones that [[human]]s with normal [[color vision|colour vision]] (i.e. [[trichromat]]s) possess.  She is therefore classified as a [[tetrachromat]], but her extra type of cone is an orange cone instead of the ultraviolet cone possessed by [[animal]]s who are typically tetrachromats, such as [[bird]]s.  It is estimated that while normal humans can see about 1,000,000 different colours, tetrachromats such as Hogan can see 100,000,000 different colours. This is because each additional type of cones reacts with the other types of cones in such a way that an addition of a new type of cone means an organism can see 100 times as many colours. (This means that a [[pentachromat]] would be able to see 10,000,000,000 (ten billion) different colours.) <ref> [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06256/721190-114.stm Some women may see 100,000,000 colors, thanks to their genes (Article by Mark Roth in the Philadelphia Post-Gazette Wednesday, September 13, 2006):]</ref>

=== Academia ===
* In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], orange [[Academic dress|regalia]] is associated with the field of [[engineering]].

=== Geography and history ===
* Orange is the national colour of [[The Netherlands]], because its [[royal family]] used to own the [[principality]] of [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]] (the [[Prince of Orange|title]] is still used for the Dutch heir apparent). There is no etymological connection between ''orange'' (the fruit and colour) and ''Orange'' (the name of the principality), and the similarity is fortuitous.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Orange is the colour of choice for many of the national sports teams and their supporters. The nickname of the Dutch national [[football (soccer)|football]] team is ''Oranje'', the Dutch word for orange. In the modern [[flag of the Netherlands]], red substitutes the original orange, but on royal birthdays, the flag has an additional orange [[banner]]. Most geographical usages of the word ''orange'' can be traced back to Dutch maritime power in the 17th century.
* In [[Ireland]] the use of ''orange'' dates from the reign of [[William III of England|William of Orange]], the Protestant English king and a Dutch [[stadholder]].
