A '''comedian''', or '''comic''', is a performer who entertains an audience by making them laugh. This might be through [[joke]]s or amusing situations, or acting the fool, as in [[slapstick]], or employing [[prop comedy]]. A female comedian may be known as a '''comedienne'''.
A comedian who stands and addresses an audience directly is called a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]].

Since the mid-[[1980s]], a new wave of comedy, called [[alternative comedy]], has been gaining popularity with its offbeat style. This normally involves more experiential, or observational reporting.

Formats of a comedian's show are flexible and often depend on the type of [[comedy]]. Some comedians like Brian Figarol and Jack Tzianabos speak about their own day to day lives, while others like [[Frank Skinner]] sing humorous songs.

As far as content is concerned, comedians such as [[Tommy Tiernan]] draw on their background to poke fun at themselves, while others such as [[Bill Hicks]] and [[George Carlin]] have strong political and cultural undertones.

Many comics achieve a [[cult following]] while touring famous comedy hubs such as the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in [[Montreal]], the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]] in [[Australia]]. Often a comic's career is made when they win a notable comedy prize, such as the now defunct [[Perrier Award]]. Comics typically survive by continuous touring and foray into other areas of entertainment, when they have become famous. These include [[television]] (such as with [[Drew Carey]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Ray Romano]], [[Pablo Francisco]] and [[Dave Chappelle]]), films (such as with [[Chris Rock]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[George Carlin]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]],[[Jim Carrey]],  [[Rodney Dangerfield]] and [[Robin Williams]]), [[radio]] (such as with [[Dave Callan]], [[Adam Carolla]] and [[Artie Lange]]) and the release of [[DVD]]s of live shows.
