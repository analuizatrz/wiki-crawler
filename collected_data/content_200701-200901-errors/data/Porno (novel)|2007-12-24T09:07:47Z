'''''Porno''''' is a [[novel]] by [[Scotland|Scottish]] writer [[Irvine Welsh]], and is the [[sequel]] to ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]''.
The book describes the characters of [[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]] nine years after the events of the earlier book, as their paths cross again, this time with the [[pornography]] business as the backdrop rather than [[heroin]] use. A number of characters from ''[[Glue (novel)|Glue]]'' make an appearance as well.

This sequel picks up ideas of the film adaptation of [[Trainspotting (film)|''Trainspotting'']]. One example is the fact that "Spud" has received his share of the drug money, which is shown in the film, but only alluded to in the book.

==Plot summary==

The novel is divided into 3 sections, each of which comprises [[chapter]]s with different [[narrator]]s. Unlike ''Trainspotting'' which had more narrational diversity, ''Porno'' is reduced to just 5 narrators: Sick Boy, Renton, Spud, Begbie and Nikki. Another difference from the format of ''Trainspotting'' is that each [[fictional character|character]] has a defined chapter heading. Sick Boy's chapters all begin with "Scam..." and then a prison number in front of a "#". Renton's all begin with "The Whores of Amsterdam Part..." depending on what chapter it is. Spud's chapters are just narrative, Begbie's are in capitals, and Nikki's are quoted. "...A SIMON DAVID WILLIAMSON PRODUCTION..." for example.

Each narrator is associated with a distinctive prose style.  Renton, Sick Boy, and Nikki's chapters are written almost entirely in "standard" English while Begbie and Spud's chapters are in [[Scots language|Scots]].  For example, in Chapter 25, Spud narrates, "So ah'm downcast when ah git intae the library, thinkin tae masel" ("So I'm downcast when I get into the library thinking to myself"). Sick Boy's returning grandiose nature is featured in imagined interviews with John Gibson of the ''Evening News'' and [[Alex McLeish]]. 

===Section 1: Stag===
Simon 'Sick Boy' Williamson leaves the London [[Cocaine#Crack cocaine|crack]] scene and returns to Leith when he comes into ownership of his aunt's [[pub]]. Convinced that the area is destined to become a social and cultural hub, Simon decides to focus his energy into making the pub a classier establishment.

Nikki Fuller-Smith is a university student who works part time in a massage parlour. Rab, a university acquaintance, introduces her to his friend Terry Lawson and his underground, homemade pornography operation. The scene interests Nikki.

Danny 'Spud' Murphy has been regularly attending group sessions in an attempt to kick his drug habit. His relationship with his wife Alison is strained and Spud feels like he has become a burden on her. He considers his [[life insurance]] policy and contemplates [[suicide]].

Meanwhile, in [[Amsterdam]], Mark Renton is co-owner of a successful nightclub. One night, a [[DJ]] from his hometown plays at one of his clubs and recognises him.

When Sick Boy learns of Terry's operation, he offers the use of the upstairs bar to shoot some scenes. During their first meeting, the group begins planning to film a full length adult film.

The first section concludes with "OOTSIDE", a chapter noting the release into society of Francis Begbie.

===Section 2: Porno===
While in prison, Begbie received packages of gay porn, sent anonymously by Sick Boy. Upon his release, he determines to find the culprit. While accompanying an old friend on a debt collection errand he meets Kate and begins a relationship with her.

When Alison begins working at Sick Boy's pub and Sick Boy deliberately attempts to sabotage her relationship with Spud, the friendship between Spud and Sick Boy is strained. During one thinly veiled argument, Spud reveals that he received his share of the money from Renton. He also unveils his recent ambition, to write a history of Leith.
 
Begbie visits Sick Boy's pub. As the two converse, Sick Boy considers the duplicitous trait of opportunity and threat accompanying Begbie's release.

Soon after, Terry, Rab and several other friends arrive and begin discussing their upcoming trip to Amsterdam, a [[bachelor]] celebration for Rab. Sick Boy is initially reluctant to attend but changes his mind after Carl, a DJ, mentions that he worked at a club in Amsterdam that was owned by Mark Renton.

===Section 3: Exhibition===
Sick Boy's "Porno" shot becomes a slow demolish of his so-called mates. Spud turns out soon after Begbie threatens him in front of his family, Renton decides to leave with his strong relationship with Dianne, Nikki leaves him after "understandin the real Simon", and Begbie becomes even more psychotic. And is now on Sick Boy's side.

Begbie gets hit by a car trying to run across the road to Renton, who runs off with Nikki and Dianne, as well as Sickboy's Â£60,000.

==Characters in "Porno"==
*Simon David "Sick Boy" Williamson - Marred by a string of failed business ventures, decides to make a porn film.  A heavy [[cocaine]] user. Still bitter about being ripped off by Renton in the previous novel. In the years since ''Trainspotting'' he had a son with a woman who is now his ex-wife. He has also lost some of the charm and physical attractiveness he previously possessed.
*Mark "Rents" Renton - Kicked heroin and owns a successful nightclub in Amsterdam. Agrees to finance Sick Boy's porn film in exchange for a share of the profits, despite a mutual lack of trust and amiability. Has got into shape and learned martial arts in anticipation and fear of an eventual meeting with Begbie.
*Nikki Fuller-Smith - 25-year old university student and film studies major who moonlights performing minor sexual favours at a sauna/massage parlour.  Has body image problems (she occasionally vomits after meals) and is attracted to Sick Boy.  She decides to help Sick Boy with his film by starring in it. 
*Daniel "Spud" Murphy - Still on drugs but trying to kick them.  The only one compensated for his role in the drug deal at the end of ''Trainspotting'', and holds no ill will against Renton as a result. Married with a son, Andy, but is plagued by marital and self-esteem problems.
*Francis "Franco" Begbie - Spent three years in prison for manslaughter. The crime was actually a murder, but he managed to stab himself and plant false evidence to make it seem like manslaughter. Harbours a lot of resentment towards Renton for ripping him off in the last novel and blames him for the crime he committed. Still as violent and psychopathic as ever, now even more [[Paranoia|paranoid]] due to heavy cocaine use. The fact that Sick Boy anonymously sends gay porn to his prison cell doesn't help.
*Lauren - Nikki's best friend and flatmate, a feminist, who tries to dissuade Nikki from being in a porn film. She is generally regarded as a bore and/or motherly figure.
*Terry "Juice" Lawson - Amateur porn star that Sick Boy employs to be in his film. A main character in ''Glue''.
*Rab - Friend of Nikki and Lauren also younger brother of "Business Birrell" from Glue, who introduces them to the underground porn scene. Engaged with a child on the way.
*Dianne - Another flatmate of Nikki's.  Had a relationship with Renton during ''Trainspotting'' while she was underaged. Currently studying for a [[psychology]] degree, with particular attention to sexual psychology.
