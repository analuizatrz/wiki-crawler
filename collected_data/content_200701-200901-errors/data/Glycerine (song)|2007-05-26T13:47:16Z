'''"Glycerine"''' is a [[1995]] single by the rock band [[Bush (band)|Bush]] from their debut album ''[[Sixteen Stone]]''.
The Band Bush features guitarist and vocalist Gavin Rossdale.  Bush was formed in late 1992 by Rossdale. Bush landed an American record deal before they had a British label. Sixteen Stone, their debut album produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley (producers of early-'80s hits by Madness and Elvis Costello, among others), was released in late 1994 by Interscope Records, which features the song Glycerine.

The video for Glycerine was notable for being shot in a very short time period when the band was on tour in the United States.  The video was shot so quickly because the band's visas had expired.  In spite of being very simple and unadorned, the video was highly acclaimed and won several awards, including the [[MTV Video Music Award - Viewer's Choice]] from the 1996 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

The song is also well known for being performed live during a heavy storm at the 1996 MTV Spring Break. 

Glycerine is also featured on [[Buzz Ballads]] soundtrack, offered by musicspace.com (2006).

Glycerine came 5th in Australia's Triple J Hottest 100 in 1996.

The song was also featured in the season 4 premiere of CBS's [[Cold Case]] entitled "Rampage".

Glycerine has also been covered by many bands, usually played with an acoustic guitar.
