The '''Tennessee Public Service Commission''' was a three-member elected body which regulated private [[public utility|utilities]], [[truck]]ing firms, and [[railroad]]s within the state of [[Tennessee]]. It was dissolved in 1996 when its functions were transferred to the [[Tennessee Regulatory Authority]].

The body consisted of three commissioners, one from each of the state's three "[[Grand Divisions]]" ([[East Tennessee|East]], [[Middle Tennessee|Middle]], and [[West Tennessee]]).  While one member of the body was required to be from each Grand Division, each was [[election|elected]] on a statewide basis to staggered six-year terms, resulting in the election of one commissioner in each even-numbered year.  This body was somewhat less powerful than some similar bodies in most other states in that, with the exception of the [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]] area, it had no jurisdiction over electric rates since the vast majority of the state received its [[electric power|power]] from the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], which as part of the [[United States Government|federal government]] was not subject to [[U.S. state|state]] regulation.<ref name="encyclopedia" />

==History==
The Tennessee Public Service Commission originated in [[1897]] as an elected three-member state Railroad Commission, vested with the authority to investigate the rates and practices of [[railroad]]s and to approve rail tariffs.<ref name="encyclopedia">[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=T054 Tennessee Public Service Commission] in ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture''</ref> In 1919 the Railroad Commission's responsibilities were expanded to include the regulation of [[street railway]]s and public utilities, and the [[Tennessee General Assembly]] changed the body's name to the Railroad and Public Utilities Commission.<ref name="encyclopedia" /> Jurisdiction over [[motor carrier]]s was added in 1933.<ref name="encyclopedia" /> With the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1930s the commission lost its jurisdiction over electric utilities; street railways were removed from commission jurisdiction in 1943. The commission's name was changed to the Public Service Commission in 1955.<ref name="encyclopedia" />

Once the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] was changed to being confirmed by a yes-no vote (the "Modified [[Missouri Plan]]" or "[[Tennessee Plan]]") rather than being chosen by an actual election, the PSC members became the only government officials in Tennessee other than [[governor]] who were elected statewide. During the entire life of the body, all of its members were [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. The process was notoriously tainted by allegations of corruption.<ref name="court">[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=6th&navby=case&no=00a0131p Decision in the case of ''Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, Inc. v. Keith Bissell'', No. 98-6037], U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, April 12, 2000</ref> The general public showed very little interest in the office, despite its potential for considerable impact on their daily lives, with total votes cast in races for the office often amounting only to two-thirds or less of the numbers cast for governor, [[United States Senate|senator]], or [[President of the United States|President]] in the same election, and most people largely or entirely unaware of the duties and functions of the commission.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}  Nearly all [[campaign finance|campaign donations]] came from the industries which were regulated by the PSC, their representatives, and persons involved with them.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}  No one was ever elected to higher office from the Tennessee Public Service Commission, although such attempts were occasionally made.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Election-related scandals and charges of favoritism, together with the fact that no [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] was ever elected to the office of Public Service Commissioner, led the administration of [[governor of Tennessee|Governor]] [[Don Sundquist]] to move to abolish the office in [[1995]].<ref name="encyclopedia" /> The Tennessee General Assembly acted that year to abolish the Public Service Commission, replacing it with the [[Tennessee Regulatory Authority]]<ref name="court" />, consisting of three members, with one member each appointed by the [[Governor]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee|Lieutenant Governor]], and the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]]. The Public Service Commission ceased operation on June 30, 1996, and the Regulatory Authority began operation the following day.<ref name="encyclopedia" />
