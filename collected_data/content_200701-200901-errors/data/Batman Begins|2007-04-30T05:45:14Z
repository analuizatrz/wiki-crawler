'''''Batman Begins''''' is a [[2005 in film|2005]] [[superhero film]] based on the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. The film is directed by [[Christopher Nolan]] and stars [[Christian Bale]] as Batman. 

Several years after the commercial and critical failure of [[Joel Schumacher|Joel Schumacher's]] ''[[Batman & Robin (1997 film)|Batman & Robin]]'' in [[1997 in film|1997]], ''Begins'' was a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the Batman film franchise. The lighter direction Schumacher had taken the franchise was abandoned, and the new film was written concerning the origins of Batman with some inspirations from classic comic book storylines such as ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' and ''[[The Long Halloween]]''. The film was the first live action film to depict this stage of the character's history.

''Batman Begins'' proved to be successful, and a sequel titled ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' was commissioned for a [[2008 in film|2008]] release with both Nolan and Bale returning.

==Plot==
{{spoilers}}
As a young boy of 8, Bruce Wayne falls down a well, where he is caught in a swarm of [[bat]]s. Bruce is rescued by his father [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]], but he is left with a [[fear of bats]]. When Bruce and his parents attend the opera ''[[Mefistofele]]'', Bruce is frightened by the portrayals of bat-like demons in the performance. He and his parents exit into an alley, where they are confronted by an armed mugger, [[Joe Chill]], who shoots and kills Bruce's parents. Chill is arrested and convicted for the double murder, but Bruce is left traumatized by the incident. The family's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], raises Bruce in the absence of his parents.

When Bruce becomes a young man, he returns home to [[Gotham City]] from [[Princeton University]], intent on killing Joe Chill, whose prison sentence is being [[suspended sentence|suspended]] in exchange for testifying against the mob boss [[Carmine Falcone]]. Chill is assassinated by one of Falcone's henchmen, depriving Bruce of his opportunity. When Bruce tells his childhood friend Rachel Dawes about his foiled plan, she expresses disgust and gives him a lecture of the difference between justice and revenge. Realizing she is right, Bruce decides to confront Falcone himself, but the mob boss dismisses him as powerless, having his thugs beat him to teach him a lesson. He abandons his life at home, stowing away on a cargo ship and traveling the world for nearly seven years. He associates with criminals to learn their ways and is thrown in prison by police in China for theft. After a prison brawl some time later, an enigmatic man who identifies himself as [[Henri Ducard|Ducard]] invites Bruce to join an elite vigilante group, the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]], under the leadership of [[Ra's al Ghul]].  Bruce, freed the next day, travels to the top of a mountain to begin his combat training with the League. In his training, Bruce overcomes his fear of bats while under the [[psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] influence of a mountainside blue flower. When Ducard tells Bruce to execute a murderer as a final test before leading the League to destroy a corrupted Gotham City, Bruce refuses to obey and destroys the League's headquarters, killing Ra's in the process. However, Bruce rescues an unconscious Ducard from the wreckage and leaves his mentor at a nearby village. 

Bruce Wayne returns to a Gotham City that is almost completely in the pocket of Falcone and begins plotting a one-man war against the corrupt system. He plans to seek the help of Rachel, having now become an assistant district attorney, and police sergeant [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], who consoled him in the aftermath of the murder of his parents. Bruce pays a visit to Gordon one night in disguise to establish communication. After reestablishing his connections to his father's company, [[Wayne Enterprises]], Bruce is able to acquire, with the help of former board member [[Lucius Fox]], a [[Batmobile|prototype armored car]] and an experimental [[Batsuit|armored suit]]. He augments the suit with League of Shadows armor, and a special cape that can become a rudimentary hang glider. One night, he dons the completed costume to become Batman, interrupts a drug shipment by Falcone, and leaves the mob boss tied to a searchlight to form a makeshift [[Bat-Signal]]. He also disrupts an assassination attempt on Dawes, leaving her with evidence against a judge that has gone soft on Falcone in the past. While investigating the "unusual" drugs in the shipment, Batman is stunned by [[Scarecrow (comics)|Dr. Jonathan Crane]] ("The Scarecrow"), who sprays him with a hallucinogenic drug. Bruce is saved by Alfred and an anti-toxin developed by Lucius. Crane later poisons Rachel after showing her that the toxin, which is revealed to only be harmful in vapor form, is being piped into Gotham's [[water supply network|water supply]]. She is saved by Batman. The Police enter the asylum, and Batman escapes with Rachel in his [[Batmobile]]. After administering the antidote to Rachel in his cave, he gives her two vials of it for Gordon; one for the detective to inoculate himself, and another to mass production for the city.
[[Image:Gordon-batman-rooftop.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Batman and Gordon assume new responsibilities.]]
Later, Bruce is confronted by his old mentor Ducard, who then reveals himself to be the real Ra's al Ghul, the former who died being a decoy. Ra’s, who had been conspiring with Crane the entire time, plans to destroy Gotham by distributing the toxin (which was extracted from his blue flowers) undetected via Gotham's water supply, and then vaporize it with a stolen device from Wayne Enterprises. Bruce, tricking his guests into leaving, fights Ra's while the League of Shadows set fire to [[Wayne Manor]]. Bruce escapes the inferno with Alfred's help just as the manor is destroyed. While the police are engaged in battle with psychotic criminals the League disguised as a SWAT team has released from Arkham, Batman arrives to help. After saving Rachel, who guesses his identity, he leaves Gordon in control of the Batmobile to stop the [[elevated train]] that is being used to transport the vaporizer to the city's central water hub. Batman battles Ra's, then escapes just as Gordon topples the elevated line using the Batmobile's missiles, leaving Ra's, who seems eerily peaceful to accept his fate, to crash with the train to the ground. Following the battle, Batman becomes a public hero. Bruce gains control of Wayne Enterprises and installs Fox as CEO, firing Earle. However, he is unable to hold onto Rachel, who cannot reconcile her love for Bruce Wayne with his dual life as Batman. Gordon, now a Lieutenant, unveils a Bat-Signal for Batman and mentions a new criminal that, like Batman, has "a taste for the theatrical", leaving a [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] playing card at his crime scenes. Batman promises to look into it and takes off into the night.

In September 2003, director Christopher Nolan was reported to be considering [[Billy Crudup]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Christian Bale]], [[Hugh Dancy]], [[Joshua Jackson]] and [[Cillian Murphy]] for the role of Bruce Wayne.<ref name="dynamic">{{ cite news | first=Cathy | last=Dunkley | coauthors=Bing, Jonathan | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117891989.html?categoryid=1019&cs=1 | title=Inside Move: New dynamic for WB duo | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2003-09-07]] | accessdate=2006-11-02 }}</ref> On [[September 11]], [[2003]], Warner Bros.

This effectively shattered the record of 70 pounds set by [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] in 1987 for his role in ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. At first he went well over the weight required (taking literally Nolan's instructions to "get as big as you can"), and when he was first introduced to the crew there was concern over whether he'd look right for the part. However, Bale worked hard to lose the excess weight, and was ready in time for filming.<ref>{{cite video| title = Shaping Mind and Body| medium = DVD| publisher = Warner Bros| date = 2005}}</ref>

==Influences==
The film's overall look, feel and story was inspired by several works. DC Comics president [[Paul Levitz]], director Christopher Nolan and screenwriter [[David S. Goyer]] worked as a team to draw ideas from thirty years' worth of Batman comics. Nolan's personal "jumping off point" was ''[[Batman: The Man Who Falls]]'', a short story about the death of Bruce Wayne's parents and Bruce's travels throughout the world. The early scene in ''Batman Begins'' of young Bruce Wayne falling into a well was directly adapted from ''The Man Who Falls''. The group also drew June 1971's Batman #232: "Daughter of the Demon" ("the classic arc that introduced [[Ra's al Ghul]]") and "the two or three best [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] stories ever done" to help write the film's main villains. While the Scarecrow stories were mentioned more ambiguously, the Scarecrow's line in the film, "Dr. Crane isn't here right now…" was drawn from the story "Choices" from ''Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight Halloween Special'' (December 1993) by [[Jeph Loeb]].  In addition, the story ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'' influenced Goyer in writing the screenplay, with the villain [[Carmine Falcone]] as one of many elements which were drawn from ''Halloween'''s "sober, serious approach".<ref name="genesis">{{cite video | people=[[Dan DiDio|DiDio, Dan]] (Vice President of DC Comics), [[David S.

Frank Miller's ''Year One'' plot device about a corrupt police force creating Gordon and [[Gotham City]]'s need for Batman was also used by the writers of ''Batman Begins''.<ref name="genesis" />

In addition to drawing from Batman canon, director Christopher Nolan used the [[science fiction film]] ''[[Blade Runner]]'' as a source of inspiration for ''Batman Begins''. The director screened ''Blade Runner'' to cinematographer [[Wally Pfister]] and two others to show the attitude and style that he wanted to draw from the film. Nolan described the film's world as "an interesting lesson on the technique of exploring and describing a credible universe that doesn't appear to have any boundaries", a lesson that he applied to the production of ''Batman Begins''.<ref>{{cite news | first=Pat | last=Jankiewicz | url=http://www.christianbale.net/articles/2005/starlog2005-08.htm | title=Dark Knight Resurrected | publisher=[[Starlog]] | date=August 2005 | accessdate=2006-11-06 }}</ref>

==Design==
===Gotham City===
[[Image:Gotham City Batman Begins.jpg|thumb|250px|Gotham City]]
Gotham City is depicted as still being affected by a long Depression, due in part to [[Ra's al Ghul]] bringing down what he perceives to be a corrupt city. [[Wayne Enterprises]] creates a train line to connect the poverty stricken Narrows and the richer parts of the city, and the end point is also above the city's main water supply within W.E.'s main tower. Carmine Falcone is the main source of corruption in the city, having bribed many judges, policemen, lawyers whilst he oversees the drug stock. His partnership with Jonathan Crane allows his men to avoid jail. The Wayne family lives somewhere outside the city and has a long history: during the [[American Civil War]] Bruce's ancestor used the underground network to lead slaves to their freedom.<ref name="film">{{cite video | people = [[Christopher Nolan]] | year = 2005 | title = Batman Begins | url = | format = | accessdate = 2007-02-25 | medium = DVD | location = | publisher = [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] | time= }}</ref>

Director Christopher Nolan worked with production designer Nathan Crowley to create the look of [[Gotham City]]. Nolan designed Gotham City to be a large, modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through. Elements were drawn from [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], and [[Tokyo]], the latter for its elevated freeways and monorails. In ''Batman Begins'', the Narrows was based on the [[slum|slummish]] nature of the (now demolished) [[Kowloon Walled City|walled city of Kowloon]] in [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Jeff | last=Otto | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/622/622719p1.html | title=Interview: Christopher Nolan | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2006-06-05]] | accessdate=2006-11-06 }}</ref>

===Batmobile===
In ''Batman Begins'', Bruce Wayne acquires a mothballed Wayne Enterprises military vehicle, called the Tumbler, to serve as his [[Batmobile]]. Originally sporting [[military camouflage]] paint, Bruce Wayne requests Lucius Fox to have the Tumbler painted black. The Tumbler possesses a [[jet engine]] which can propel the vehicle in the air over a short distance. The vehicle has two driving positions: one for actual driving, and one for shooting missiles. [[stealth technology|Stealth capabilities]] are also built into the Tumbler, which includes a silent, [[electric motor]] drive that helps render the vehicle "invisible" at night.<ref name="film" />
[[Image:Batmantumbler2.jpg|thumb|250px||The Tumbler, the [[Batmobile]] used in ''Batman Begins''.]]
Nathan Crowley, one of the production designers for ''Batman Begins'', started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by [[kitbashing|model bashing]]. One of the parts that Crowley used to create the vehicle was the nose cone of a [[P-38 Lightning]] model to serve as the chassis for the Tumbler's jet engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of [[Styrofoam]], which was a process that lasted two months.<ref name="batmobile">{{cite web | first=Marshall | last=Brain | url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/batmobile.htm/printable | title=How the Batmobile Works | publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]] | accessdate=2006-11-05 }}</ref>

The Styrofoam model was used to create a steel "test frame", which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over 100 [[miles per hour|mph]], go from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds, possess a [[steering]] system to make sharp turns at city corners, and to withstand a self-propelled launch of up to 30 feet. On the very first jump test, the Tumbler's front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt. The basic configuration of the newly designed Tumbler included a 5.7-liter Chevy [[V8 engine]], a truck axle for the rear axle, front racing tires by Hoosier, rear 4x4 mud tires by Interco., and the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system of Baja racing trucks. The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars.<ref name="batmobile" />

With the design process completed, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle possessing 65 [[carbon fiber]] panels and costing $250,000 each to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six [[propane]] tanks.  Due to the poor visibility inside the vehicle by the driver, monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film's scenes.<ref name="batmobile" />

The interior of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was over-sized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a [[radio-controlled car|miniature model]] that was 1:5 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the scene in ''Batman Begins'' where the Tumbler flies through the waterfall was the actual race car.<ref name="batmobile" />

===Batsuit===
[[Image:Batsuitplusbats.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Batman uses the Batsuit to summon bats for distraction in the Arkham Asylum.]]
In ''Batman Begins'', Bruce Wayne physically becomes Batman by wearing a fictional [[Nomex]] Survival Suit created by the Applied Science Division of [[Wayne Enterprises]]. Wayne modifies the undersuit by adding defensive gauntlets, [[Kevlar]] gloves, a cowl, and a cape. The cowl has a [[reinforced carbon-carbon|composite-graphite]] exterior with the interior containing microphones and a radio antenna. The cape is made of memory fiber, another fictional product of Wayne Enterprises' Applied Science Division, which allows the fabric to become stiff via electrical charge and enable the cape user to glide, mimicking the skeletal structure of a Bat's wings. Batman also has multiple gadgets on his utility belt, including a magnetic grappling gun. In addition, the Batsuit has a sonic device built into the heel of one of the boots to attract bats to use for distraction.<ref name="film" />

The filmmakers intended to create a very mobile Batsuit that would allow the wearer to move easily in order to fight and crouch. Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restricted full head movement. Lindy Hemming, the costume designer for ''Batman Begins'', and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed "Cape Town", a secured compound located at [[Shepperton Studios]] in London. The Batsuit's basic design was a [[neoprene]] undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections. Batman actor [[Christian Bale]] was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast. To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface. In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black. The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam's durability.<ref name="batsuit">{{cite web | url=http://www2.warnerbros.com/batmanbegins/productionnotes/# | title=''Batman Begins'' Production Notes - The Batsuit & Gadgetry | publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] | accessdate=2006-11-06 }}</ref>

For the cape, director Christopher Nolan wanted to have a "flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels". Hemming's team created the cape out of their own version of [[parachute]] [[nylon]] that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defense]]. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection. The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard. The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show "a man who has angst", so his character would be revealed through the mask.<ref name="batsuit" />

For the film, three people were needed to dress Christian Bale up in the Batsuit. Since Bale wore the Batsuit for hours at a time, overheating became an issue. Plastic tubes were occasionally routed into the Batsuit as Bale wore it to provide a "cool suit" similar to those worn by high-altitude pilots and astronauts.  To best pose as Batman, Bale studied graphic novels and illustrations of the superhero. Nolan said that Bale succeeded in his intimidating pose, recalling, "Everyone on set felt quite a charge when Christian would walk on in the Batsuit."  Bale had a love-hate relationship with the suit, which had often sent him into foul moods, helping him transform into Batman. Bale said, "Batman's meant to be fierce, and you become a beast in that suit, as Batman should be — not a man in a suit, but a different creature."<ref name="batsuit" />

==Film score==
{{seealso|Batman Begins (soundtrack)}}
The film score for ''Batman Begins'' was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[James Newton Howard]]. Director Christopher Nolan originally invited Zimmer to compose the film score, and Zimmer asked the director if he could invite Howard to compose as well. The two composers collaborated on separate themes for the "split personality" of Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Batman. Zimmer and Howard began composing in [[Los Angeles]] and moved to [[London]] where they stayed for 12 weeks to complete most of their writing.<ref>{{cite news | author=Spence D | url=http://music.ign.com/articles/624/624382p1.html | title=Batman Vs. Hans Zimmer & James Newton Howard Part 1 | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2005-06-10]] | accessdate=2006-12-01 }}</ref> Zimmer wanted to avoid composing a film score that had been done before, so the score became an amalgamation of [[orchestra]] and [[electronic music]]. Zimmer and Howard sought inspiration for shaping the score by making set visits to ''Batman Begins''. The film's orchestra was developed from members of various London orchestras, and Zimmer chose to use more than the normal amount of [[cello]]s. Zimmer enlisted a [[choir]] boy to help reflect the music in the film's scene where Bruce Wayne's parents are killed. "He's singing a fairly pretty tune and then he gets stuck, it's like froze, arrested development," Zimmer said. Zimmer also attempted to add human dimension to Batman, whose behavior would typically be seen as "psychotic", through the music. Both composers collaborated to create 2 hours and 20 minutes' worth of music for the film.<ref name="zimmer">{{cite news | author=Spence D | url=http://music.ign.com/articles/624/624641p1.html | title=Batman Vs.
