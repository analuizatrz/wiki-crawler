'''''Amaryllis''''' is a monotypic (only one species) [[genus]] of plant also known as the '''Belladonna Lily''' or '''naked ladies'''. The single species, ''Amaryllis belladonna'', a native of [[South Africa]], particularly the rocky southwest region near the Cape. It is often confused with the [[Hippeastrum]], a flowering [[bulb]] commonly sold for [[blooming]] [[indoors]].

==Characteristics==

The Belladonna Lily is a [[bulb|bulbous]] plant, with each bulb being 5-10 cm in diameter. It has several strap-shaped, dull green [[leaf|leaves]], 30-50 cm long and 2-3 cm broad, arranged in two rows. The leaves are produced in the autumn and eventually die down by late spring. The bulb is then dormant until late summer. 

In late summer the bulb produces one or two naked stems 30-60 cm tall, each of which bear a cluster of 2 to 12 funnel-shaped [[flower]]s at their tops. Each flower is 6-10 cm diameter with six [[tepal]]s (three outer sepals, three inner petals, with similar appearance to each other). The usual color is white with crimson veins, but pink or purple also occur naturally. This flowering pattern is the cause of its common name "naked lady".

The Belladonna Lily was introduced into cultivation at the beginning of the eighteenth century. However, most of the so-called Amaryllis bulbs sold as 'ready to bloom for the holidays' belong to the allied genus [[Hippeastrum]], despite being labeled as 'Amaryllis' by sellers and [[nursery (horticulture)|nurseries]]. Adding to the name confusion, some bulbs of other species with a similar growth and flowering pattern are also sometimes called "naked ladies", even though those species have their own more widely used and accepted common names, such as the [[Resurrection Lily]] (''Lycoris squamigera'').

==Etymology==
The scientific name ''Amaryllis'' is taken from a shepherdess in [[Virgil]]'s pastoral "[[Eclogues]]," from the [[Greek language|Greek]] αμαρυσσω ([[Latin]] ''amarysso'') meaning "to sparkle."[http://behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=amaryllis]

It is used as a [[given name]] for females.
