'''Beall Woods State Park''' is [[List of Illinois state parks|Illinois state park]] on {{convert|635|acre|sqkm|2}} bordering the [[Wabash River]] near [[Mount Carmel, Illinois|Mount Carmel]] in [[Wabash County, Illinois|Wabash County]], [[Illinois]] in the [[United States]].  {{convert|329|acre|sqkm|2}} of the state park is an [[old-growth forest]] designated as an ''Natural Area'' by the state of Illinois.  The trees within the forest consist overwhelmingly of [[hardwood]]s of the former Eastern Woodlands ecosystem.  Beall Woods State Park has been elevated to the status of a [[National Natural Landmark]] as the ''Forest of the Wabash''.  The state park was created in 1966.

==Forest of the Wabash== 
The Forest of the Wabash Natural Area within Beall Woods State Park contains trees from 64 separate species.  Foresters have counted more than 300 "climax" trees with trunks of greater than {{convert|30|in|cm|0}} diameter at "breast" i.e. {{convert|40|in|m|1}} high.  Some of the trees in the Forest of the Wabash are more than {{convert|120|ft|m|0}} tall.

Trees of note include the [[white oak]] (the state tree of Illinois), the [[tuliptree]] (the state tree of Indiana, across the Wabash River), the [[American sycamore]], and the [[American Sweetgum]].  One of the sweetgums of this Forest is designated as the "state champion" tree as being the largest member of this species known to grow within the boundaries of Illinois.   

The Forest of the Wabash was patented by the federal government to the Beall family in the early 1800s, and was owned by them as an undisturbed woodlot until the 1960s.  Meanwhile almost all of the other old-growth trees in the Wabash Valley were cut down for fine hardwood purposes, timber, or even for [[firewood]].  Upon the death of Laura Beall, the last private-sector guardian of the Forest of the Wabash, and after a fight with a lumber company, in 1965 the State of Illinois condemned the Beall farm and forest for public use.

==The state park today==
A visitor center was opened in April 2001.  The park maintains {{convert|6.25|mi|km|2}} of hiking [[trail]]s, primarily through the Forest of the Wabash portion of the park.
