The '''Heath-leaved Banksia''' (''Banksia ericifolia''), also known as the '''Lantern Banksia''' or '''Heath Banksia''', is a [[species]] of woody [[shrub]] of the [[Proteaceae]] family native to Central and Northern [[New South Wales]] east of the [[Great Dividing Range]]. Well -known for its orange or red autumn inflorescences which contrast with its green fine=leaved heath-like foliage, it has been widely grown in Australian gardens on the east coast for many years as well as being used in the cut flower industry. 

''Banksia ericifolia'' was one of the original ''[[Banksia]]'' species collected by [[Joseph Banks]] around [[Botany Bay]] in 1770 and was named by [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger|Carl Linnaeus the Younger]], son of [[Carolus Linnaeus]], in 1782. A distinctive plant, it has recently been split into two subspecies.

It is the official plant of [[Sydney]] and is sometimes seen in amenity plantings and parks around the city. It was known as '''wadanggari''' (pron. "wa-tang-gre") to the local [[Eora]] and [[Darug]] 
inhabitants of the Sydney basin.<ref>{{cite book|author=Troy, Jakelin|year=1993|title=The sydney language|publisher=Jakelin Troy, Canberra}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
In nature, the variety ''ericifolia'' is found on acidic sandstone-based soils, generally in elevated heathland around the [[Sydney]] basin, from [[Collaroy, New South Wales|Collaroy]] to the [[Illawarra]] and into the [[Blue Mountains]] to the west. It is a wonderful highlight to bushwalking around sandstone areas in Autumn and early winter. Good places to see it include the Kings Tableland walk in the Blue Mountains, Jennifer Street Boardwalk in [[Little Bay]], and [[Royal National Park]]

Another variety, ''macrantha'' is found on the far north coast of [[New South Wales]] from Crowdy Bay northwards to [[Murwillumbah]], just south of the [[Queensland]] border.

==Description==
''Banksia ericifolia'' grows as a large shrub to 6&nbsp;metres, though often smaller (1-2&nbsp;metres) in exposed places such as coastal or mountain heathlands. The bark is a smooth grey colour with lenticels, though can become thicker with age. The foliage is a green, with new growth an attractive lime green colour. The linear dark green leaves are small and narrow, 9–20&nbsp;mm long and up to 1&nbsp;mm wide, generally with two small 'teeth' at the tips. Flowering is in autumn or winter in cooler areas; the inflorescences, or flower spikes are 7-22&nbsp;cm high and 5&nbsp;cm broad or so. The spikes are red or gold in overall colour, with styles golden, orange or orange-red, or burgundy. Some unusual forms have red styles on a whitish perianth which can be striking. Very occasionally, yellow flowered forms are seen. 

Old flowers fall off the cones, often to reveal numerous small dark grey to dull black finely furry follicles. ''Banksia ericifolia'' responds to fire by seeding, the parent plant being killed. As plants take several years to flower in the wild it is very sensitive to too-frequent burns and has been eliminated in some areas where this occurs.

==Taxonomy==
===Taxonomic history===
''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' was first collected at [[Botany Bay]] on [[29 April]] [[1770]], by [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander|Dr Daniel Solander]], naturalists on the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' during Lieutenant (later Captain) [[James Cook]]'s [[James Cook#First voyage (1768-1771)|first voyage]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name="Wharton 1893">{{cite book | editor = William J. L. Wharton (ed.) | year = 1893 | title = [[Wikisource:Captain Cook's Journal, First Voyage|Captain Cook's Journal during his First Voyage Round the World made in H. M. Bark "Endeavour" 1768-71: A Literal Transcription of the Original MSS]] | location = London | publisher = E. Stock}}</ref><ref name="Banks 1770">{{cite web | author = [[Joseph Banks|Banks, Sir Joseph]] | title = 29 April 1770 | work = Banks's Journal | url = http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/banks/17700429.html | accessdate = 2006-10-25}}</ref> However, the species was not published until April 1782, when [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]] described the first four ''Banksia'' species in his ''[[Supplementum Plantarum]]''. Linnaeus distinguished the species by their leaf shapes, and named them accordingly. Thus the species with leaves reminiscent of [[heather]] formerly of the genus ''[[Erica]]'' was given the specific name ''ericaefolia'', from the Latin ''erica'', meaning "heather", and ''folium'', meaning "leaf".<ref name="L.f. 1782">{{cite book | author = [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]] | year = 1782 | title = [[Supplementum Plantarum]] | location = Brunsvigae | publisher = Orphanotrophei}}</ref> The [[Binomial nomenclature#Authorship in scientific names|full name]] for the species is therefore '''''Banksia ericifolia'' L.f.'''<ref name="APNI"/>

Salisbury described this plant as ''Banksia phylicaefolia'' in 1796, though this was not adopted. Though many species have undegone much taxonomic change over the next 200 years, the distinctive ''Banksia ericifolia'' as a species concept remained unchanged until the northern form was published as a distinct taxon, ''macrantha'', in 1996. Alf Salkin had noted this in 1979, giving it the name ''microphylla''. He also noted some differences in those populations of the Blue Mountains and felt there were three distinct forms in total, with one being a possible hybrid with ''[[Banksia cunninghamii]]''. <ref name = "Salkin79"/>

===Placement within ''Banksia''===
''Banksia ericifolia''  has classically been described as lying within series [[Banksia ser. Spicigerae|''Banksia'' ser. ''Spicigerae'']], together with ''[[Banksia spinulosa]]'' and various western Hairpin-like Banksias such as ''[[Banksia seminuda|B. seminuda]]'' and ''[[Banksia brownii|B. brownii]]''. This series in placed in [[Banksia sect. Oncostylis|''Banksia'' sect. ''Oncostylis'']] according to [[Alex George]]'s [[taxonomy of Banksia]],<ref name ="George 1981">{{The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)}}</ref><ref name ="George99">*{{cite book|author=[[Alex George|George, Alex]]|year=1999|chapter=Banksia|editor=Wilson, Annette (ed.)|title=Flora of Australia: Volume 17B: Proteaceae 3: Hakea to Dryandra|pages=175–251|publisher=CSIRO Publishing / Australian Biological Resources Study|id=ISBN 0-643-06454-0}}</ref> but directly into [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''Banksia'' subg. ''Banksia'']] in Thiele's arrangement based on [[cladistic analysis of Banksia|cladistic analysis]].<ref name="Thiele 1996">{{cite journal | author = [[Kevin Thiele|Thiele, Kevin]] and Pauline Y. Ladiges | year = 1996 | title = A Cladistic Analysis of Banksia (Proteaceae) | journal = [[Australian Systematic Botany]] | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 661-733 | doi = 10.1071/SB9960661}}</ref>  Molecular research suggests that ''B. spinulosa'' and ''B. ericifolia'' may be more closely related to series [[Banksia ser. Salicinae|''Banksia'' ser. ''Salicinae'']], with ''[[Banksia integrifolia]]'' and its relatives.

In 2005, Austin Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for ''Banksia''. They inferred a [[phylogeny]] very greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding ''Banksia'' to be [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] with respect to ''[[Banksia ser. Dryandra|Dryandra]]''.<ref name="Mast 2005">{{cite journal | [[Austin Mast|Mast, Austin R.]], Eric H. Jones and Shawn P. Havery | year = 2005 | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | title = An Assessment of Old and New DNA sequence evidence for the Paraphyly of Banksia with respect to Dryandra (Proteaceae) | journal = [[Australian Systematic Botany]] | pages = 75-88 | publisher = CSIRO Publishing / Australian Systematic Botany Society | doi = 10.1071/SB04015}}</ref> A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring ''Dryandra'' to ''Banksia'', and publishing ''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Spathulatae'' for the species having spoon-shaped [[cotyledon]]s; in this way they also redefined the [[autonym]] [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Banksia'']]. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of ''Dryandra'' was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then ''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'' is placed in ''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Spathulatae''.<ref name="Mast 2007">{{cite journal | author = [[Austin Mast|Mast, Austin R.]] and [[Kevin Thiele]] | year = 2007 | title = The transfer of Dryandra R.Br. to Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae) | journal = [[Australian Systematic Botany]] | volume = 20 | pages = 63–71 | doi = 10.1071/SB06016}}</ref>

Hybrids with ''[[Banksia spinulosa]]'' have been recorded in the wild. ''Banksia'' [[Banksia 'Giant Candles'|"Giant Candles"]] was a chance garden hybrid between ''B. ericifolia'' and ''B. cunninghamii''.

===Subspecies===
Two geographically distinct forms are recognised:

*'''''Banksia ericifolia''''' subsp. '''''ericifolia''''': The nominate race is found in the Sydney basin, south to the Illawarra and north to Collaroy, as well as the Blue Mountains. The seedling leaves have 2–6 teeth on each margin, while on the inflorescences the perianths are 19–22 mm long and pistils are 30–35 mm long. Salkin noted that this subspecies often grew in association with ''Banksia cunninghamii'' and that there appeared plants which have longer leaves some 20-25 mm long with entire revolute margins. He gave them the name "longifolia" and suspected these may have been hybrids between the two species.<ref name = "Salkin79"/>

*'''''Banksia ericifolia''''' subsp. '''''macrantha''''': The northern race is found on the New South Wales north coast, from Crowdy Head northwards to the Queensland border. Described as a distinct subspecies in 1996 by Alex George from material he collected at [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] in 1975, it is distinguished by finer foliage, more crowded leaves and larger flowers, with the perianths 26–28 mm long and pistils 46–48 mm long. The seedling leaves have one, or occasionally two, teeth on each margin. Salkin observed that the inflorescences tended to be terminal rather than axial.<ref name = "Salkin79"/>

==Ecology==
Like other banksias, ''B. ericifolia'' plays host to a wide variety of pollinators and is a vital source of nectar in autumn when other flowers are scarce. It has been the subject of a number of studies on pollination. A 1998 study in [[Bundjalung National Park]] in Northern New South Wales found that ''B. ericifolia'' inflorescences are foraged by a variety of small mammals, including [[marsupial]]s (such as [[Yellow-footed Antechinus]], ''Antechinus flavipes'') and [[rodent]]s such as the [[Pale Field Rat]], ''Rattus tunneyi'', and ''Melomys burtoni'' . These carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectariferous birds, making them effective pollinators.<ref name="Hackett 2001">{{cite journal | first = Damian J. | last = Hackett | coauthors = Ross L. Goldingay | title = Pollination of Banksia spp. by non-flying mammals in north-eastern New South Wales | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 49 | issue = 5 | pages = 637–644}}</ref> A 1978 study found the [[Bush Rat]] ''(Rattus fuscipes)'' to bear large amounts of pollen from ''B. ericifolia'' and proposed the hooked styles may play a role in pollination by mammals.<ref>Carpenter FL (1978) Hooks for mammal pollination? ''Oecologia'' '''35''' 123-132</ref>  

Other visitors recorded include the honeybee ''[[Apis mellifera]]''<ref name="Hackett 2001"/>

A 1985 study in the [[Sydney]] area of ''B. ericifolia'' var. ''ericifolia'' found numerous creatures visiting the inflorescences, including the bird species, honeyeaters [[Eastern Spinebill]] ''(Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris)'', [[White-cheeked Honeyeater]] ''(Phylidonyris nigra)'', [[New Holland Honeyeater]] ''(Phylidonyris novaehollandiae)'', [[White-naped Honeyeater]] ''(Melithreptus lunatus)'', [[Yellow-faced Honeyeater]] ''(Lichenostomus chrysops)'', [[Red Wattlebird]] ''(Anthochaera carunculata)'' and [[Little Wattlebird]] ''(Anthochaera chrysoptera)'' as well as the [[Silvereye]] ''Zosterops lateralis''. Some mammals were recorded but were found to bear no pollen. Exclusion of certain pollinators showed that birds and insects were important for fertilisation. <ref name = "Paton85">Paton DC, Turner V (1985) Pollination of ''Banksia ericifolia'' Smith: Birds, mammals and insects as pollen vectors. ''Australian Journal of Botany'' '''33''' 271-286</ref>

==Cultivation==
Historically, ''Banksia ericifolia'' was introduced into cultivation soon after its discovery, and was mentioned (as ''B. ericaefolia'') in volume 6 of [[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]] where it was described as, "...a handsome shrub, thrives freely, and has flowered in several collections". An illustration was drawn of one growing in Vauxhall in 1802.<ref name = "Salkin79">{{cite book  | last = Salkin  | first = Abraham Isaac | title = Variation In Banksia in Eastern Australia: An Investigation Using Experimental Methods  | publisher = Monash University  | date = 1979  | location = Clayton, Victoria  | pages = 239  | doi =  | id =  }}</ref> 

Tough enough to be used as a street plant in parts of Sydney, ''B. ericifolia'' is a fairly easy plant to grow given it is provided with the conditions it likes, namely a sandy well drained soil, sunny aspect and extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to [[Phytophthora cinnamomi|dieback]], like most eastern banksias<ref>McCredie TA, Dixon KW, Sivasithamparam K. (1985) Variability in the resistance of ''Banksia'' L.f. species to ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'' Rands. ''Australian Journal of Botany''. '''(33)''': 629-637.</ref>. 

Flowering may take some years from seed; a minimum of four years is standard. Buying an advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a [[cutting]]-grown plant. Note that named cultivars (see below) are propagated by cuttings.

Pruning is important to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia as it lacks a lignotuber (unlike many other species)

Over the years, more and more cultivars of ''Banksia ericifolia'' have come on the market, including colour variants and dwarf forms (especially important as the original plant may reach a size of 5 metres in height). This helps enthusiasts choose a plant that is right for their conditions and tastes. 

===Cultivars and varieties===
A registered cultivar, [[Banksia 'Limelight'|''Banksia'' 'Limelight']], has bright lime green foliage and orange blossoms.
[[Image:Banksia ericifolia little eric Cox Jul 04 email.jpg|thumb|''B.'' 'Little Eric', cult. [[Kenthurst]], NSW]]
There are a number of commercial varieties available, none of which have yet been registered under [[plant breeders' rights]] legislation:
'''''B. ericifolia'' ‘Little Eric’''' – a dwarf form to 1 or 2&nbsp;m, chance garden seedling, with maroon styles and whitish perianth, propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery.

'''''B. ericifolia'' ‘Bronzed Aussie’''' - a white-budded terminal-flowering form to 2&nbsp;m, with honey-coloured pistils, and bronzed foliage. Propagated by Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery, Hoddle Creek. A new release in 2003, its provenance is unknown (seed donated to Rod’s father by SGAP member many years ago.)

'''''B. ericifolia'' ‘Golden Girl’''' - a golden yellow-flowered form (hidden wide fat flowers to 8cm high) to 1.5-1.8&nbsp;m, with blue-grey foliage. Propagated by Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery. A new release in 2003, its provenance is unknown (seed donated to Rod’s father by [[Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants|SGAP]] member many years ago.)

'''''B. ericifolia'' ‘Red Rover’''' – to 1.8&nbsp;m with a more open habit, this form has lime green foliage and scarlet-red flowers. Propagated by Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery. A new release in 2004, it was a garden selection.

'''''Banksia ericifolia'' ‘Kanangra Gold’''' – Propagated by Kuranga Nursery, this is a gold flowered form to 4&nbsp;m from the Kanangra-Boyd region of the Blue Mountains. It is bushy and flowers are much paler than the regular ericifolia orange.

[[Image:Banksia ericifolia WC email.jpg|thumb|''Banksia ericifolia'' "White Candles" cult. Sydney]]

'''''Banksia ericifolia'' ‘White candles/Christmas Candles’''' - allegedly from somewhere in [[Sutherland Shire]] in Sydney’s south. It has an unusual red style/white body colour combination somewhat reminiscent of ''[[Banksia coccinea|B. coccinea]]''. The buds are white and are a nice contrast to the red styles that emerge through them. An open shrub to presumably 3-4&nbsp;m. Apparently '''''B. ericifolia'' ‘Ruby Clusters’''' is similar in appearance.  

'''''Banksia ericifolia'' ‘St Pauls’''' – a dwarf form to 2&nbsp;m with conspicuous red inflorescences which has been available from time to time from Cranebrook Nursery in Sydney’s west. Originally propagated from a plant cultivated at St Pauls’ secondary school (a local high school).

'''''Banksia ericifolia'' ‘Purple Pygmy’''' – a dwarf form propagated by Kuranga Nursery to 1&nbsp;m with purplish foliage with claret flowers. It only flowers rarely and is difficult to propagate. Also, due to low demand it is only propagated in low numbers.

'''''Banksia ericifolia macrantha'' ‘Creamed Honey’''' – so called as its flowers are the colour of creamed honey, this pale flowered variant was found at Crowdy Head on the NSW north coast. Propagated by Kuranga  nursery it grows to 4 or 5&nbsp;m with a more open habit. Notable in that it is the northern subspecies of ''Banksia ericifolia''.
