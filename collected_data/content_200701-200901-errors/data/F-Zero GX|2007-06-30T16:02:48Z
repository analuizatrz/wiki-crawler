{{nihongo|'''''F-Zero GX'''''|エフゼロ ジーエックス|Efu Zero Jī Ekkusu|F-ZERO GX}} is a [[futuristic]] racing video game for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] console. Developed by Sega's [[Amusement Vision]] department, it was released in [[Japan]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]], in 2003.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/driving/fzero/similar.html?mode=versions|title=F-Zero GX dates|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref> Its arcade counterpart, ''[[F-Zero AX]]'', utilizes hardware conceived from a business alliance between Nintendo, [[Namco]], and [[Sega]].<ref name="triforce"/> ''F-Zero GX'' runs on an enhanced version of the engine that powered ''[[Super Monkey Ball]]''.<ref name="Engine"/> The game is considered and ranked<ref name="GameRankings">{{cite web | title=F-Zero GX reviews | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/560617.asp | publisher=Gamerankings.com | accessdate=2006-10-15}}</ref> as one of the best racers of its time and the greatest racer on the GameCube platform.<ref>{{cite web|date=[[2007-06-28]]|author=Bozon, Mark|authorlink=Mark Bozon |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/800/800442p3.html|title= Wii Summertime Blues|publisher=IGN | |accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref><ref name="SpotsBest"/>

''F-Zero GX'' is the sixth installment in the [[F-Zero (series)|''F-Zero'' series]] and the successor to ''[[F-Zero X]]''. The game continues the series difficult, high-speed racing style, retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the [[Nintendo 64]] title. A heavy emphasis is placed on track memorization and reflexes, which aids in completing the title.<ref name="GameS"/><ref name="thunderboltgames">{{cite web |author=Boot, Justin| date=[[2005-11-12]]| title=F-Zero GX review | publisher=thunderboltgames.com | url=http://www.thunderboltgames.com/reviews/viewreview.php?rid=777 | accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> ''GX'' introduces a "story mode" element, where the player walks in the footsteps of [[Captain Falcon]] through nine chapters while completing various missions.<ref name="player guide">{{Cite book |last=Pelland |first=Scott (ed.) |title=F-Zero GX Player's Guide |year=2003 |publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc |location=Redmond, Washington |isbn=1930206-35-6}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
''F-Zero GX'' is a futuristic [[racing game]] where thirty pilots race on massive circuits inside [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]-powered [[hovercar]]s in an intergalactic [[Grand Prix]] at speeds that can exceed over 2000 [[km/h]]. The game is noteworthy for its visuals, intense action, high level of difficulty and for its very high sense of speed.<ref name="Review"/> Tracks include loops, half-pipes, cylinders, and jumps. Some courses have innate obstacles like dirt patches, mines, tricky jumps, and magnetic tubes to navigate.<ref name="Review"/> Before a race, the player is able to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed. This adds strategy,<ref>{{cite web|title=Game Information|publisher=Nintendo Europe|url= http://www.nintendo-europe.com/NOE/en/GB/games/gamepage.do?ElementId=ed350197-ce61-44d8-8aeb-d94f8ec09620 |accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref> as players with greater knowledge of the circuits can make better decisions. There is a wide range of machines available for the player to choose, each with its own characteristics and performance abilities, including and limited to varying levels of top speed, acceleration, cornering, grip, boost, body, and each is driven by a different character. Custom machines can also be created, they consist of three adjustable parts that affect the overall performance of the vehicle.

A race in ''F-Zero GX'' consists of three laps around the track. Each machine has an energy meter, which serves two purposes. First, it is a measurement of the machine's health and is decreased when the machine hits another racer or the side of the track. Second, the player is given the ability to boost after the first lap. Boosting greatly increases the racer's speed, but also drains their energy. Energy can be replenished by driving over recharge strips that are placed on the track.<ref name="player guide"/> If a player falls off a track or runs out of energy, the race will be restarted, or their machine will be restored to the track with half depleted energy. As with all ''F-Zero'' titles, combat is not a crucial part of the game, but machines can attempt to damage and destroy each other using side or spin attacks. Vehicles that have taken an excessive amount of damage and are about to finish a race can attempt an "suicide finish". It is an intentional explosion just before the finish line, if properly timed, allows broken down vehicles to slide past the line on momentum alone.<ref name="Techniques"/>

''F-Zero GX'' includes several different modes.<ref name="GXmanual">{{cite book | year=2003 | editor=Amusement Vision | title=F-Zero GX instruction manual | pages=pp. 14, 25 | url=http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.2044 |publisher=Nintendo |date=2003-08-25 | language=English}}</ref> In the Grand Prix mode, the player chooses a cup and races against twenty-nine opponents through each track in that cup. Players get a certain amount of points for finishing a track depending on where they placed, and the winner of the circuit is the character who receives the most total points.<ref name="player guide"/> There are three difficulty levels available at the start: Novice, Standard, and Expert. Master difficulty can be unlocked by beating the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald cups on Expert. Placing first in a cup on Master difficulty with a non-custom machine unlocks an [[Full motion video|FMV]] featuring that machine's pilot. The Vs. Battle is the multiplayer mode where two to four players can compete simultaneously. [[Image:F-Zero GX.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''F-Zero GX'' is regarded as one of the best looking GameCube titles.<ref name=Top10>{{cite web|title=Top Ten Best Looking GameCube Games|publisher=IGN.com|url= http://cube.ign.com/articles/608/608634p2.html |accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>]] Time Attack lets the player choose a track and complete it in the shortest time possible. Ghost data can be saved to a Memory Card, racing against a staff ghost or transparent re-enactments of the player's best three-lap performances is possible. Up to five ghosts can be shown at a time. A new Story mode allows the player to follow [[Captain Falcon]] as he races through missions and completes a wide array of challenges. The replay mode allows saved replays to be viewed under different camera angles and music. Customize is where items such as pilots and machine parts can be bought. Practice allows the player to practice any track with an adjustable amount of laps and opponents.<ref name="GXmanual"/> Each character's biography, theme music, as well as information on their machine is located in the Pilot Profile mode. Unlocked character movies can also be viewed here.

There is also an Internet ranking system whereby players will enter a password on the Internet and will get ranked based on their position in the database. Players can receive a password after completing a race, write it down, go an enter it into a webpage database, and it will track their time and the machine they've used.<ref name=Conference>{{cite web|author=IGN Staff |date=[[2003-07-08]]|title=F-Zero Press Conference|publisher=IGN.com|url= http://cube.ign.com/articles/427/427647p1.html |accessdate=2006-11-04}}</ref>

===Customize mode===
The new "customize mode" allows the player to create emblems to place on the machines and buy items and use a variety of them in many ways. Buy parts to customize a machine that range from extremely heavy to extremely light ones, in-game sounds, unlockable pilots, circuits and finally "staff ghosts" that players can try to beat - these ghosts do particularly fast runs on tracks and are exceedingly difficult. All of these things, once unlocked, are purchased using "tickets", which the player wins by completing one of the five Grand Prix Cups (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond, and AX (Amount varies based on the number of wins on the difficultly level and cup chosen)) or story missions, or by achieving specific minimum times in [[time trial]] mode (which also unlocks that track's Staff Ghost).<ref name="Customization">{{cite web|author=Schneider, Peer|authorlink=Peer Schneider |title= F-Zero GX Customization|publisher=IGN.com|url= http://guides.ign.com/guides/480123/page_10.html| accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref><ref name="GXSecrets">{{cite web|author=Schneider, Peer|authorlink=Peer Schneider|title=F-Zero GX Secrets| publisher=IGN.com| url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/480123/page_11.html| accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref>

===Snaking technique===
After properly navigating out of banked turns, the game's physics modeling allows F-Zero machines to get a boost of acceleration if it has high grip, high acceleration and/or heavy weight. Players can exploit ''F-Zero GX'''s finely tuned physics model to simulate special boosts caused by correctly leaning into curves using the controller's shoulder buttons. This can be done easily on a wide straight stretch of a circuit to generate movements likened to actual [[snake]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Schneider, Peer|authorlink=Peer Schneider|title=Tips & Techniques|publisher=IGN.com|url= http://guides.ign.com/guides/480123/page_2.html|accessdate=2006-11-04}}</ref> These back and forth [[snake]]-like movements set a high rate of oscillation, achieving speeds of over 3,000&nbsp;km/h.

==Story==
The new story mode lets the player race as Captain Falcon in nine chapters of various non-standard racing scenarios, such as Falcon's training regiment, a battle against a rival's gang, an escape from a collapsing building through closing blast doors under a narrow time limit, and the ''F-Zero'' Grand Prix race against 29 other veteran pilots.<ref name="player guide"/> Each chapter can be completed in three [[difficulty level]]s, each of which unlocks an item in the game's shop: "Normal," which unlocks the next chapter; "Hard," which unlocks parts from the [[arcade game|arcade]] version, ''[[F-Zero AX]]''; and "Very Hard," which unlocks driver-specific vehicles from ''F-Zero AX''.<ref>{{cite web |author= Schneider, Peer |authorlink=Peer Schneider |title=F-Zero GX story guide|publisher=IGN.com|url= http://guides.ign.com/guides/480123/page_9.html|accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref>
[[Toshihiro Nagoshi]], one of the game's co-producers, stated that this mode was included because the development team felt that the ''F-Zero'' universe was unique and they wanted to explain some of the characters' motivations and flesh out the game world.<ref name=Conference>{{cite web|author=|title=F-Zero Press Conference|publisher=IGN.com|year=2003|url= http://cube.ign.com/articles/427/427647p1.html|accessdate=2006-11-04}}</ref>

==Circuits==
Though ''GX'' has more tracks than its predecessor ''[[F-Zero X]]'', there is no longer a code to unlock them all, which means that some will never see more than the first 15 tracks. Furthermore, the "X Cup" (which randomly generates tracks) was removed in ''GX''. There are four "GX cups" in the game with five tracks each. Initially only the Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald Cups can be played. Diamond Cup can be unlocked by coming first overall in Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald Cup on standard or a higher difficulty in the Grand Prix.<ref name="player guide"/> Beating the first three cups on Expert also unlocks the Master class difficulty level. Individual AX tracks can be unlocked by placing first on the tracks in the arcade (''F-Zero AX'') version of the game and saving progress to a memory card. Placing first overall in the other four cups on the Master difficulty setting also unlocks five of the six AX Cup tracks for purchase using tickets. The sixth, which is the 26th and last track in the game, Mute City: Sonic Oval, can be unlocked by placing first in the AX Cup on any difficulty level.<ref name="GXSecrets"/>

==Development==
At the AOU Amusement Expo in mid-February 2002, Nintendo announced that an arcade board under the name of "Triforce" was being developed in conjunction between Nintendo, [[Namco]], and Sega. In an a follow-up interview held in London, Miyamoto said announcements will be made revealing several software titles that will make use of the hardware. The first occurred in late March 2002 and was from Sega's Amusement Vision.<ref name="triforce"/> The announcement revealed Sega's subsidiary Amusement Vision and Nintendo will collaborate to release ''F-Zero'' video game titles for the [[Triforce (arcade system board)|Triforce arcade board]] and the Nintendo GameCube.<ref name=developerpublisher/> While Amusement Vision was responsible for most of the game's development, Nintendo EAD executives including Shigeru Miyamoto, Takaya Imamura, and Isshin Shimizu, took on leading roles.<ref name="triforce">{{cite web | author=Bayer, Glen | date=[[2003-04-12]] | title=Triforce - Namco, Nintendo, and Sega | url= http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=58 | publisher=N-Sider.com | accessdate=April 6 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Nintendo revealed the first footage of ''F-Zero GX'' at the Pre-[[E3|E³]] press conference on May 21, [[2002 in video gaming|2002]]. While the game was known to exist several months prior, it had remained behind closed doors until that conference.<ref>{{cite web |author=IGN Staff |date=[[2002-05-21]] |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/360/360297p1.html | publisher=IGN.com | accessdate=2006-10-19 | title=E3 2002: F-Zero GCN Videos}}</ref> 

In early March 2003 according to the official Nintendo website, ''F-Zero'' was delayed by two months.<ref>{{cite web | author=IGN Staff|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/388/388645p1.html | date=[[2003-03-10]] |title=F-Zero and Wario Delayed|publisher=IGN.com|accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> Via a live video conference call from Japan on July 8, 2003 Shigeru Miyamoto, supervisor Takaya Imamura and Amusement Vision president Toshihiro Nagoshi answered questions about the two ''F-Zero'' games. There Miyamoto announced the Japanese version of the game was finished and would be soon available to the public.<ref name=Conference/> Toshihiro Nagoshi mentioned that back at E³ 2003, he was hoping that they would have that time to include a [[Local area network|LAN]] multiplayer mode. But they chose not to actually support a LAN mode in ''F-Zero GX''. He stated "Once you include a mode like that the multiplayer mode becomes the focus of gameplay. With ''F-Zero'', we're more focused on the single-player game. That's the main reason we've not included it this time."<ref name=Conference/> Takaya Imamura commented that even though he worked directly on ''F-Zero'' throughout its different incarnations, this time Imamura took a "step back and was involved at kind of a producer level at looking over the game". Imamura went on to say he "have worked on the ''F-Zero'' series, and seeing the results of the collaboration with Sega, I found myself at something of a loss as to how we can take the franchise further past ''F-Zero GX'' and ''AX''".<ref name=Conference/>

Hidenori Shoji, Daiki Kasho and Alan Brey composed a soundtrack for ''GX'' and its arcade counterpart called, ''[[F-Zero GX/AX Original Soundtrack]]''. It was released on [[July 22]], [[2004]], in Japan by Scitron Digital Content.

==F-Zero AX connectivity==
The game's [[memory card]]s, on which [[saved game]]s are kept, can be taken to an arcade with ''F-Zero AX'', the game's arcade counterpart, to download special data. Players are meant to use the ''AX'' arcade cabinets to unlock permanent access to the fifth and last cup, the AX Cup; a number of new custom machine parts and ten new vehicles. This is easier said than done, as ''AX'' cabinets are quite rare; according to a fan-compiled ''F-Zero AX'' Locations database, less than twenty are available in the North America region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashboards.com/fzero/locations.php|title=F-Zero AX Database|accessdate=2006-11-11 }}</ref> However, more can be located and its content can instead be unlocked in ''F-Zero GX'' or use of a cheating device. In ''GX'', the AX Cup can be unlocked by completing all other cups (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald and Diamond) on Master difficulty, the vehicles by completing Story Mode missions on Very Hard difficulty and all the custom parts by completing Story Mode on Hard difficulty and the Grand Prix on expert in the Diamond cup.<ref name="GXSecrets"/><ref name="Customization"/><ref name="player guide"/>
