'''Tel Aviv-Yafo''' ({{lang-he-n|תֵּל־אָבִיב-יָפוֹ}}; {{lang-ar|تَلْ أَبِيبْ يَافَا}}) is the second most populous city of [[Israel]], located on the [[Mediterranean]] coast. It is the main city of the largest and most populous [[metropolitan area]] in Israel, [[Gush Dan]] (Dan Bloc), which has a population of 3.04 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Localities, Population and Density per sq. km., by Metropolitan Area and Selected Localities |work=Statistical Abstract of Israel 2006 |publisher = [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] |url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton57/st02_15.pdf | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> The city itself has a population of 382,500 over an area covering 50,553 [[dunam]]s (50.6 km² or 19.5 sq mi). As of 2007, it has been named the costliest city in the [[Middle East]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercerhr.com/referencecontent.jhtml?idContent=1268475|title=Worldwide Cost of Living Survey 2007 – city rankings|publisher=[[Mercer Human Resource Consulting]]|date=[[18 June]] [[2007]]}}</ref>

The City of Tel Aviv was originally founded in the 1880s by Jewish immigrants as an alternative to the expensive neighbouring, historic town of [[Jaffa]] ({{lang-he|יפו}}, ''Yafo''; {{lang-ar|يافا}}, ''Yafa''). Tel Aviv grew and grew, and eventually overtook the [[Arab]] dominated town. The two towns became united in the single municipality of Tel Aviv-Yafo in 1950, two years after the establishment of the State of Israel. Tel Aviv is today viewed by many as Israel's economic capital ([[Jerusalem]] is the official capital) and the city lies in the area known internationally as [[Silicon Wadi]]. Tel Aviv is also viewed by many to be the country's cultural capital with a vibrant, modern, cosmopolitan character, and a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Status for its [[Bauhaus]] architecture.

==Etymology==
The name Tel Aviv in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] means "Hill (''[[tell|tel]]'') of [[Spring (season)|Spring]] (''aviv'')". This is the title given by [[Nahum Sokolow]] to his Hebrew translation of [[Theodor Herzl]]'s book ''Altneuland'' ([[German language|German]]: "[[The Old New Land]]").

There is an account that Sokolow came up with the Hebrew title "Tel Aviv" to allude to the destruction of the ancient Jewish state and its hoped-for restoration: ''aviv'' = "spring" to symbolize renewal; and ''tel'' to symbolize the destruction of the ancient state, following not the usual Hebrew meaning of the word "tel" but its use in [[archaeology]], meaning "mound of accumulated ruins". Sokolow took the name from the [[Book of Ezekiel]], 3:15 : "Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days." (The spelling in the [[King James Version of the Bible]] is ''Telabib'' <ref>[http://king-james-bible.classic-literature.co.uk/the-book-of-the-prophet-ezekiel/ebook-page-03.asp King James Bible: The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel]</ref>). The ''Aviv'' referred to is possibly an indirect reference to a [[Mesopotamia]]n god or goddess believed to bring forth the season of spring.

Jaffa is Yafo in Hebrew, which may well be derived from yafah/yofi (beautiful) or may simply come from the name of its founder, Japheth, son of Noah. This port city is mentioned in the book of [[Jonah]]. A mention of the city by the name of "Japo" was found on an ancient Egyptian tax register clay tablet found at [[Amarna|Tel el-Amarna]], which could render the [[etymological]] derivation from "yofi" (or "Yefet") unlikely.

== History ==
[[Image:Telaviv founding 1909.jpg|thumb|300px|Tel Aviv was founded on empty dunes, purchased from Arabs, north of the existing city of Jaffa. This photograph is of the auction of the first lots in 1909.]]

The gulf of Jaffa has been the site of a fortified port town for at least 4000 years. During the 19th century the town’s population grew from about 2,500 (1806) to 17,000 (1886). The old city walls could no longer contain the population, and they were destroyed in the 1870s. New, more spacious neighborhoods started to appear. 

The settlement in the area of modern southern Tel Aviv (the neighbourhoods of [[Neve Tzedek]] and Neve Shalom<!--not to be confused with the much later Arab-Jewish cooperative village by the same name-->) was started in the 1880s as a substitute for the relatively expensive Arab neighbourhoods of [[Jaffa, Israel|Jaffa]] by some of the town's distinguished Jewish residents.

In 1908 the Ahuzat Bayit homebuilders association bought land north of Jaffa. Building started in 1909, and the association admitted members of two suburbs established nearby. In 1910, the common name of Tel Aviv was adopted. At its founding, Tel Aviv was intended only to be a suburb, a [[bedroom community]], with the workers commuting to Jaffa. The founders envisaged a European-style garden suburb, with wide streets and boulevards. 

In May 1921, however, dozens of Jews were killed by an Arab mob in Jaffa and soon after that, thousands of the 16,000 Jews of Jaffa moved north to Tel Aviv. Following the disputes, the inhabitants of Tel Aviv created a new [[central business district]]. The [[Urban planning|master plan]] for development of the city, based on a framework of central routes and [[boulevard]]s, was designed in 1925 by [[Patrick Geddes]] and adopted by the city council under [[Meir Dizengoff]]. Owing to its proximity to the port of Jaffa, and its status as the first Jewish community that immigrants saw when coming into the country, Tel Aviv quickly grew to become the centre of Israeli urban life, which it remains to this day. 1938 marked the opening of Tel Aviv port, an important milestone marking the end of its dependency on Jaffa.

Israel's [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Declaration of Independence]] took place in Tel Aviv on [[May 14]], [[1948]], and it served as Israel's temporary capital throughout the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] due to the Arab blockade of [[Jerusalem]], which was proclaimed capital in December 1949. Due to the international dispute over the status of Jerusalem, most embassies stayed in the Tel Aviv area. Thirteen more returned there in the early eighties. <ref>http://www.icaj.nl/nieuwsbrief/sep2005/25_jaar_ambassade.htm</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1979-1980/119%20Foreign%20Ministry%20reaction%20to%20the%20transfer%20of%20t |title=Foreign Ministry reaction to the transfer of the Dutch embassy from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv- 26 August 1980 |accessdate=2007-06-03 |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |work=Israel's Foreign Relations: Selected Documents}}</ref>. Today all but two of the international embassies to Israel are in Tel Aviv or the surrounding district.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.science.co.il/Embassies.asp|title=Embassies and Consulates in Israel |accessdate=2007-07-18 |publisher=Israel Science and Technology|work=Israel Science and Technology Homepage}}</ref>  In 1950 Tel Aviv and Jaffa were united in the single municipality Tel Aviv-Yafo.

Tel Aviv has been the victim of violence and terrorism having been targeted several times by [[:Category:Palestinian militant groups|Palestinian militant groups]]. On [[October 19]], [[1994]], a suicide bomber exploded on the Line 5 bus killing himself and 25 civilians. On [[March 4]], [[1996]], another suicide bomber exploded nearby at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] and killed 18 civilians. Оn [[June 1]], [[2001]], a suicide bomber [[Dolphinarium massacre|exploded in a line for a discotheque]] and 32 were killed and more than 100 were injured. On [[January 25]], [[2002]], 20 were killed in a suicide attack. On [[January 5]], [[2003]], in two nearly simultaneous attacks, 23 were killed. On [[17 April]], [[2006]], 10 people were killed and dozens wounded in a suicide attack near the old Central bus station.

Today, Tel Aviv-Yafo represents the heart of a thriving Israeli metropolis - the greater metropolitan area comprises a number of separate municipalities with approximately 1.1 million people living in a 15 km long sprawl along the Mediterranean coast - with around 360,400 in Tel Aviv-Yafo itself making it the second largest city in Israel after Jerusalem. Bat Yam, Holon, Ramat Gan, Givatayim, Bnei-Brak, Petah Tikva, Rishon LeZion, Ramat Ha-Sharon and Herzliya are the other major cities in the coastal area commonly known as Gush Dan. 

Whilst Jerusalem is Israel's capital city where most government departments are located, Tel Aviv and its satellite cities form the economic and cultural center. It is known as "the city that doesn't stop" and indeed you will find that the nightlife and culture are on around the clock. In summer it is not unusual to see the beach boardwalk bustling with people at 4am and the clubs and bars usually pick up around midnight until morning, giving Tel Aviv a well deserved reputation of being a party town. It is the pinnacle of secular life in Israel. 

In July 2003 Tel Aviv-Yafo was declared a cultural UNESCO World Heritage site for the many "International" style (also known as Bauhaus after the German school it originated from) buildings built in the city during the 1930s-50s. As this style emphasized simplicity and the white color, Tel Aviv is also called the White City.

== Geography==
{{see|Neighborhoods of Tel Aviv}}

Tel Aviv is located around {{Coor dm|32|5|N|34|48|E|}} on the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain]]. Located immediately north of the old city it stemmed out of, Jaffa, Tel Aviv 'proper' is situated on land which used to be sand dunes, and as such has relatively poor soil fertility. In modern times, due to the urban sprawl of Tel Aviv and the Gush Dan region in general, drawing absolute borders between Tel Aviv and Jaffa is incredibly hard, as it is to draw borders between the city's neighbourhoods. The city is located some 60 kilometers (37 mi) north west of [[Jerusalem]], Israel's capital city, and some 90 kilometers south of the northern port city of [[Haifa]]. Tel Aviv municipality has a jurisdiction of 50,553 [[dunam]]s (50.6 km² or 19.5 sq mi).

==Climate==
Tel Aviv has a [[mediterranean]] climate with hot summers, pleasant spring and autumn, and cool, rainy winters. Humidity tends to be high all year round, and rain occurs usually between October to May. In winter, temperatures seldom drop below 5°C and are more likely to be in the region of 10° to 15°C, while in summer the average is 26°C. The average annual rainfall is 530 [[millimetres]].

===Tourism and recreation===
[[Image:800px-Tel Aviv Beachs.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tel Aviv's coastline]]

Israel should be noted for having the highest number of museums per capita of any country and its fair to say that Tel Aviv has a fair percentage of these.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.israeliconsulatela.org/culture/Science.asp | title=Science & Technology | publisher=Consulate General of Israel in Los Angeles | accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Among the most notable are the [[Eretz Israel Museum]] which is known for its rich collection of archaeology and history exhibits and the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]] which is one of the major art museums in Israel. Also, the campus of TAU houses the [[Beit Hatefutsot|Jewish Diaspora Museum]], dedicated to Jewish history throughout the world. Carrying both historical documents and art, the museum tells the story of Jewish prosperity and persecution throughout the [[Jewish diaspora|centuries of exile]]. [[Batey Haosef Museum]] is a museum for the [[military]] history of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] which is regarded by many experts and arms collectors as a real jewel, containing rare exhibits and authentic pieces from Israel's history as well as a wide variety of firearms and pictures. Meanwhile, the Palmach Museum near Tel Aviv University offers a unique multimedia experience, as well as vast archives, depicting the lives of young self-trained Jewish soldiers who eventually became the first defenders of Israel. Near [[Charles Clore]]'s garden in north [[Jaffa, Israel]], there is a small museum of the [[Irgun|Etzel]] Jewish militant organization, one of whose achievements was conquering Jaffa for Israel in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. the [[Tel Aviv Exhibition Centre]] which is located in one of the northern sides of the city, hosts over 60 major events every year. Many, more offbeat museums, are located in the city including the Tel Aviv Raw Art contemporary art gallery which is located in the old bus station. Exhibits contemporary art of Israeli and international upcoming artists. <ref>http://www.rawartint.com Raw Art Gallery</ref>

Tel Aviv is a major tourist destination, combining a mediterranean feel with culture and complexity. The city has several public parks and gardens, the biggest being [[the Yarkon Park]]. Gan Meir, named after first mayor [[Meir Dizengoff]], is located on King George Street.

The economy of Tel Aviv has developed dramatically over the past decades, and as well as being Israel's economic capital, the bustling city has now been described as a flourishing technological center by [[Newsweek]] and a "miniature [[Los Angeles]]" by [[The Economist]].<ref name="Newsweek">Levy, Stephen & Matt Rees, "FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGY: The Hot New Tech Cities"; ''[[Newsweek]]'', 1998-11-09 <!-- (online: 1998-11-04) "Massive immigration from Russia in the early '90s brought the country a flood of computer scientists with advanced theoretical knowledge." --></ref><ref name="Economist>{{citeweb | url=http://www.economist.com/cities/findStory.cfm?city_id=TLV&folder=Facts-Figures#Economic_profile | title=Tel Aviv City Guide | accessdate=2007-05-28 | publisher=The Economist}}</ref> Many computer scientists now live and work in Tel Aviv. Their numbers increased as a result of immigration from the former Soviet Union since the early 1990s. The city is considered by Newsweek to be one of the top ten most technologically influential cities in the world. Actually, it is the [[metropolitan area]] (including suburbs such as [[Herzlia]] and [[Petah Tikva]]) that contains much of Israel's high-tech muscle which has become known as [[Silicon Wadi]].<ref name="Newsweek" />

Historically, Tel Aviv struggled to find a niche economic position, being located on sand dunes which weren't suited to agricultural usage, and being on a stretch of the [[Mediterranean]] not suited to a port (as is in [[Ashdod]] and [[Haifa]]. Slowly, the city developed a reputation as a centre for scientific and technical research. and in 1974, [[Intel]] opened its first overseas research and development operation in Israel. Tel Aviv finally emerged in the high-tech map in the 1990s following an economic boom.<ref name="Economist" />

Tel Aviv is home to the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]], (TASE), Israel's only stock exchange, which in recent times has reached record heights,<ref>Neal Sandler. [http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jun2007/gb20070621_251927.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business Israel: A Hotbed of...Investment], ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' June 21, 2007}}</ref> as well as many international headquarters of venture-capital firms, scientific research institutes, and high-tech companies. Having said this, there is some industry in the Tel Aviv area, and goods such as such as chemicals, textiles and food are exported from factories here.<ref name="Economist" /> Also important to the Tel Aviv economy is tourism, and people travel from around the world to this city not only because of the plethora of cultural sites which Israel can offer, but also because of its legendary nightlife, atmosphere, and architecture.

The Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC) at [[Loughborough University]]  constructed an inventory of [[world cities]] based upon their level of advanced producer services. The inventory includes Tel Aviv as having "strong evidence" of world city formation—the highest ranking for a Middle Eastern city with the exception of partly-European [[Istanbul]].<ref>[http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html Inventory of World Cities]</ref>

Seven out of the nine Israeli [[billionaire]]s reside in Israel; of them, at least four live in Tel Aviv or its suburbs (according to [[Forbes]]).<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/10/07billionaires_The-Worlds-Billionaires_CountryOfCitizen_10.html]</ref><ref>Boaz Bin-Nun. [http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/81/biz_06israel_Israels-Richest_land.html Israel's 40 Richest] 12.09.06</ref> According to [[Mercer Human Resource Consulting|Mercer]], as of 2007, Tel Aviv is considered the most expensive city in the Middle East to live, and seventeenth most in the world. It falls just short of [[New York City]] and [[Dublin]] and right ahead of [[Rome]] and [[Vienna]].<ref>Sahadi, Jeanne.

== Transportation ==
[[Image:Kirya bridge Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Multimodal traffic in Tel Aviv: pedestrians, private vehicles, buses, trucks and taxis (and accessible from the other side of the building shown is also a train station).]]

The main access route to Tel Aviv is the [[Highway 20 (Israel)|Ayalon Highway]] (a.k.a. Highway 20), which runs along the eastern side of the city from north to south along the Ayalon River riverbed, divinding for the most part, Tel Aviv and [[Ramat Gan]]. Driving south on the Ayalon gives access to Highway 1, leading to [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] and [[Jerusalem]]. Within the city, the main routes are King George Street, [[Allenby Street]], [[Ibn Gabirol Street]],[[Dizengoff Street]], [[Rothschild Boulevard]] and in [[Jaffa]], Jerusalem Boulevard. Other access routes include Namir Road (which connects to Highway 2, and provides access from the North) and Begin/Jabotinsky Road (which provides access from the east, through Ramat Gan, Bnei Brak and Petach Tiqva).

Tel Aviv has four [[Israel Railways|train stations]] all located along the Ayalon Highway. The stops are from north to south: Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv Merkaz (Tel Aviv Central Train Station), Tel Aviv Hashalom (near [[David Azrieli|Azrieli]] Center shopping mall) and Tel Aviv Hahaganah (near the [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]]). It is estimated that over a million people use the train from the surrounding cities to Tel Aviv each month.

The [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]], a large central [[bus]] station, is located in the south. The main bus network in Tel Aviv is operated by [[Dan Bus Company]] whilst the [[Egged Bus Cooperative]], the world's second-largest bus company, provides intercity transportation from Tel Aviv to settlements across the city.

Tel Aviv's airport is [[Sde Dov Airport|Dov Hoz Airport]] ''Sde Dov'' (code: SDV) which is located in the north-western side of the city and serves as a major airport for domestic flights. [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] (code: TLV), Israel's main international airport, is located 15km south-east of Tel Aviv, close to the city of [[Lod]]. Because of its proximity to Tel Aviv and its location within the metropolitan area of Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport is often referred to as ''Tel Aviv International Airport'' despite the fact that the airport is not included in any municipal jurisdiction.

The first phase of the [[Tel Aviv Subway]] is planned to be completed by 2012, which is expected to improve public transportation in the city dramatically.
