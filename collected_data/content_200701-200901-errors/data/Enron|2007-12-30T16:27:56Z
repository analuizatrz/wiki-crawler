'''Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation''' (formerly '''Enron Corporation''') (former [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]] ticker symbol: ENE) was an [[United States|American]] [[energy]] company based in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]]. Before its [[bankruptcy]] in late 2001, Enron employed around 22,000 people (McLean & Elkind, 2003) and was one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas, pulp and paper, and communications companies, with claimed revenues of $111 billion in 2000. ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' named Enron "America's Most Innovative Company" for six consecutive years. At the end of 2001 it was revealed that its reported financial condition was sustained mostly by institutionalized, systematic, and creatively planned [[accounting scandals|accounting fraud]] (see: ''[[Enron scandal]]''). Enron has since become a popular symbol of willful corporate fraud and corruption.

Enron filed for [[bankruptcy]] protection in the Southern District of New York in late 2001 and selected [[Weil, Gotshal & Manges]] as their bankruptcy counsel. Enron still exists as an asset-less shell corporation, emerging from bankruptcy in November of 2004 after one of the biggest and most complex bankruptcy cases in U.S. history. On [[September 7]] [[2006]], Enron sold [[Prisma Energy International|Prisma Energy International Inc.]], its last remaining business, to Ashmore Energy International Ltd. Following the scandal, lawsuits against Enron's directors were notable because the directors settled the suits by paying very significant sums of money personally. The scandal also caused the dissolution of the [[Arthur Andersen]] accounting firm, affecting the wider business world.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2047122.stm</ref>

Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. will continue to operate under the name Enron Corp. by filing a [[Doing Business As]], or "dba" certificate in [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]], [[Texas]]. 
 
==Early history==

Enron began as the [[Northern Natural Gas Company]], which was formed in 1931 in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. [[Internorth]], a [[holding company]], bought the company and reorganized it in 1979. They later purchased the smaller [[Houston Natural Gas]] in 1985 and changed its name to Enron in the process.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/business/2002/enron/timeline/1.stm</ref>
After building a large, new corporate headquarters in Omaha, the new Enron named former [[Houston Natural Gas]] CEO [[Kenneth Lay]] as CEO of the newly merged company, and soon moved Enron's headquarters to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].

The merged company initially styled itself "HNG/InterNorth Inc.", but the departure of ex InterNorth CEO [[Samuel Segnar]] six months after the merger provided Ken Lay with the opportunity to thoroughly re-brand the business. Lay originally favored the name "Enteron" (possibly spelled in [[camelcase]] as "EnterOn"); but when it was pointed out that the term approximated a [[Greek language|Greek]] word referring to the intestine, it was quickly shortened to "Enron." The final name was decided upon only after business cards, stationary, and other items had been printed reading Enteron, reflecting the confused state of affairs in the company at the time.  Enron's famous "tilted E" logo was designed by the late American [[graphic designer]] [[Paul Rand]].

Enron was originally involved in the transmission and distribution of electricity and gas throughout the United States and the development, construction, and operation of [[power plant]]s, [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], and it also deals with rule of law and other infrastructure worldwide.  In 1998, Enron moved into the [[water sector]], creating the [[Azurix]] Corporation, which it part-floated on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) in June 1999. Azurix failed to break into the [[water utility]] market, and one of its major concessions, in [[Buenos Aires]], was a large-scale money-loser. In April 2001, Enron announced its intention to break up Azurix and sell its assets.

Enron grew wealthy, it claimed, through its pioneering, due largely in thanks to [[marketing]] and [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] of power and [[communication]]s [[bandwidth]] [[commodities]] and related [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] as tradable [[financial instruments]], including exotic items such as [[weather derivatives]]. Enron was named "America's Most Innovative Company" by ''[[Fortune magazine]]'' for six consecutive years, from 1996 to 2001. It was on the ''Fortune''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "100 Best Companies to Work for in America" list in 2000, and had offices that were, in hindsight, stunning in their opulence. Enron was hailed by many, including labor and the workforce, as an overall great company, praised for its large long-term pensions, benefits for its workers and extremely [[Vitality curve|effective management]] until its exposure in corporate fraud.

As was later discovered, many of Enron's recorded assets and profits were inflated, or even wholly fraudulent and nonexistent. Debts and losses were put into entities formed "offshore" that were not included in the company's [[financial statements]], and other sophisticated and arcane financial transactions between Enron and related companies were used to take unprofitable entities off the company's books.

Its most valuable asset and the largest source of honest income, the 1930s-era Northern Natural Gas, was eventually purchased back by a group of Omaha investors, who moved its headquarters back to Omaha, and is now a unit of [[Warren Buffett]]'s Mid-American Energy Holdings Corp.  NNG was put up as collateral for a $2.5 billion capital infusion by [[Dynegy|Dynegy Corporation]] when Dynegy was planning to buy Enron.  When Dynegy took a close look at Enron's books they backed out of the deal and fired their CEO, Chuck Watson. The new chairman and interim CEO, the late Daniel Dienstbier, had been president of NNG and an Enron executive at one time and an acquaintance of Warren Buffett.  NNG continues to be profitable today.

==EnronOnline==
[[Image:Enrononlinescreen.JPG|frame|The front page of EnronOnline]]
In November 1995, Enron launched EnronOnline, the first web-based transaction system that allowed buyers and sellers to buy, sell, and trade commodity products globally. It allowed users to do business only with Enron. Due to the giant cash needs of Enron Online and the company wasting money in other areas such as broadband, [[Azurix]], [[Enron Energy Services]], and shutting down the original pipeline service which generated cash flow, Enron virtually drained itself of cash. The Enron Global Finance department had to keep working up more creative financing moves to keep the company running.

EnronOnline went live on [[November 29]] [[1999]]. The site allowed energy users to do business in a previously unseen way. Until this point a [[trade]]r who wanted to buy an [[energy]] [[contract]] talked with another energy trader who wanted to sell a contract, and from there terms were agreed. EnronOnline allowed [[market]] participants to see prices on their screen just like a [[stock ticker]], and could do business much more simply.

The main commodities offered on EnronOnline were [[natural gas]] and [[electricity]], although there were 500 other products including [[credit derivative]]s, [[bankruptcy swap]]s, pulp, gas, [[plastic]]s, [[paper]], [[steel]], [[metal]]s, [[freight]], and [[Television commercial|TV commercial]] time.

EnronOnline was seen as an impressive tool, but because Enron was either buying, selling, or trading in every transaction, the costs increased as time went on, and the systems were involved in the financial misreporting and other questionable financial behavior that eventually led to the Enron's demise. However, EnronOnline spawned several other e-commerce websites including [http://www.DealBench.com www.DealBench.com].  DealBench is an acquisition and divestiture tool still operating today.  As of this writing, Enron still operates the DealBench code under the name EnronAssets.  Other Enron developed technologies include Commodity Logic, ClickPaper and [[EnronCredit]].

EnronOnline closed down for online trading on the morning of [[November 28]], [[2001]], with Enron filing for [[bankruptcy]] four days later.

==Accounting scandal of 2001==
{{main|Enron scandal}}
After a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures bordering on fraud perpetrated throughout the 1990s involving Enron and its accounting firm [[Arthur Andersen]], Enron stood on the verge of undergoing the largest bankruptcy in history by mid-November 2001. [[Daniel Scotto]], an influential [[financial analyst]], stated in August 2001 that Enron was likely to implode, and recommended the sale of all Enron securities, including its common stock. He was also the first to divulge publicly the magnitude of Enron's financial leverage and lack of corporate ethics, and to question the reliability of Enron's reported earnings results, despite those results being audited by [[Arthur Andersen]]. A [[white knight (business)|white knight]] rescue attempt by a similar, smaller energy company, [[Dynegy]], was not viable.

As the scandal was revealed, Enron shares dropped from over US$90.00 to just pennies. As Enron had been considered a [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue chip]] stock, this was an unprecedented and disastrous event in the financial world. Enron's plunge occurred after it was revealed that much of its profits and revenue were the result of deals with [[Special Purpose Entity|special purpose entities]] ([[limited partnership]]s which it controlled). The result was that many of Enron's debts and the losses that it suffered were not reported in its [[financial statements]].

Enron filed for bankruptcy on [[December 2]] [[2001]]. In addition, the scandal caused the dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], which at the time was one of the world's top accounting firms.  The company also withdrew a naming rights deal with the [[Houston Astros]] Major League Baseball club to have its name associated with their new stadium, which was formerly known as Enron Field.

==California's deregulation and subsequent energy crisis==
{{see also|California electricity crisis}}
In October 2000, [[Daniel Scotto]], the top ranked utility analyst on [[Wall Street]], suspended his ratings on all energy companies conducting business in [[California]] due to the unlikely probability that the companies would receive full and adequate compensation for the deferred energy accounts used as the cornerstone for the California Deregulation Plan enacted in the late 1990s.  Five months later, [[Pacific Gas & Electric]] (PG&E) was forced into bankruptcy.  Congressman [[Phil Gramm]], the second largest recipient of campaign contributions from Enron, succeeded in legislating California's energy commodity trading deregulation. Despite warnings from prominent consumer groups which stated that this law would give energy traders too much influence over energy commodity prices, the legislation was passed in December 2000. 

As [[Public Citizen]] reported, "Because of Enron’s new, unregulated power auction, the company’s 'Wholesale Services' revenues quadrupled—from $12 billion in the first quarter of 2000 to $48.4 billion in the first quarter of 2001."<ref>http://www.citizen.org/documents/Blind_Faith.PDF</ref>

Prior to the passage of the deregulation law, there had been only one Stage 3 [[rolling blackout]] declared. Following the passage, California experienced a total of 38 blackouts defined as Stage 3 rolling blackouts until federal regulators intervened in June 2001. These blackouts occurred largely as a result of the manipulation by traders and marketers. By withholding energy and shutting down generators, frenzy appeared in the market and energy prices climbed higher on the West Coast. Enron traders were revealed as intentionally encouraging the removal of power from the market during California's energy crisis by encouraging suppliers to shut down plants to perform unnecessary maintenance, as documented in recordings made at the time.<ref>http://www.truthout.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/37/8796</ref> These acts contributed to the necessity for rolling blackouts, which adversely affected numerous businesses dependent upon a reliable supply of electricity and inconvenienced a large number of retail consumers.

According to industry consultant Charles Cicchetti, former chairman of the Wisconsin Public Service Commission:  "Two things should be obvious. First, none of this should be called deregulation. Second, it is difficult to see how any of these myriad regulatory schemes, unless altered significantly but perhaps not fundamentally, will lower prices."{{Fact|date=July 2007}}
