'''''Sesame Street''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American]] educational [[children's television series]] and a pioneer of the contemporary educational television standard, combining both [[edutainment|education and entertainment]]. ''Sesame Street'' is well known for its [[The Muppets|Muppet]] characters created by [[Jim Henson]].  It premiered on November 10, 1969, and is the longest running children's program on American television.  The show is produced in the United States by the non-profit organization [[Sesame Workshop]], formerly known as the [[Children's Television Workshop]] (CTW), founded by [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and [[Ralph Rogers]].

As a result of its positive influence, ''Sesame Street'' is one of the most highly regarded educational shows for children in the world.<ref>Karen Barss ''et al.'', "[http://enhancinged.wgbh.org/kids/cases/sesame/ Enhancing Education: A Children's Producer's Guide: Sesame Street: Case Study]", Corporation for Public Broadcasting (accessed [[June 29]] [[2005]])</ref> No other television series has matched its level of international recognition and success.

Sesame Street uses combinations of animation, puppets, and live actors to stimulate young children's minds, improve their letter and word recognition, basic [[arithmetic]], geometric forms, classification, simple problem solving, and socialization by showing children or people in their everyday lives. Since the show's inception, other instructional goals have been basic life skills, such as how to cross the street safely, proper hygiene, healthy eating habits, and social skills.

The show displays a subtle sense of humor that has appealed to older viewers since it first premiered; this was devised as a means to encourage parents and older siblings to watch the series with younger children, thus becoming involved in the learning process, rather than having ''Sesame Street'' act as a [[babysitter]]. A number of parodies of popular culture appear, especially ones aimed at the [[Public Broadcasting Service]], the network that broadcasts the show. 

The series has made many published lists, including greatest all-time show compilations by ''[[TV Guide]]''<ref>{{cite news | author = Associated Press | title = TV Guide names top 50 shows | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml | work = CBS News | date = 2002-04-26 | accessdate = 2008-09-28}}</ref> and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.  A 1996 survey found that 95% of American preschoolers have watched the show by the time they are three years old.<ref>Fisch, p. xvi</ref>

{{seealso|History of Sesame Street}}
The show's format called for the humans to be intermixed with the segments of animation, live-action shorts and [[The Muppets|Muppet]]s. These segments were created to be like commercials—quick, catchy and memorable—and made the learning experience much more like fun. The format became a model for what is known today as [[edutainment]]-based programming.

CTW aired the program for test groups to determine if the revolutionary new format was likely to succeed. Results showed that test watchers were entranced when the ad-like segments aired, especially those with the jovial puppets, but were remarkably less interested in the street scenes. Psychologists warned CTW against a mixture of fantasy and reality elements, but producers soon decided to mix the elements. A simple dose of cartoon-like characters lets the humans deliver messages without causing viewers to lose interest.<ref name=unpaved>David Borgenicht, ''[[Sesame Street Unpaved]]''. Hyperion, 1998.</ref> Prior to its national debut, a week of test episodes were seen in July 1969 on [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] educational station WUHY-TV (now [[WYBE]]).

Since season 33, a variety of miniature programs have come and gone from ''Sesame Street'', inspired by the immense popularity of ''[[Elmo's World]]'', which debuted in 1998. Unlike previous recurring sketches, such as ''[[Monsterpiece Theatre]]''<ref name"wolfson-linz">{{cite news | first = Hilary S. | last = Wolfson | title = It's Cool to Be a Lion or a Mouse | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E1DD1230F931A1575AC0A9649C8B63 | work = The New York Times | publisher = The New York Times Company | location = New York, New York | pages =  | page =  | date = 2002-09-22 | accessdate = 2008-10-09  }}</ref> and ''[[Sesame Street News Flash]]'',<ref name="tvsquad">{{cite news | first = Adam | last = Finley | title = Cancel everything and watch Sesame Street the rest of the day | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/24/cancel-everything-and-watch-sesame-street-the-rest-of-the-day/ | work = TV Squad | publisher = Weblogs, Inc. | location = Dulles, Virginia | date = 2006-04-24 | accessdate = 2008-10-09  }}</ref> these segments were in every episode of at least one season, though some appeared sporadically before or after their primary run.

The current regular segments of the show are ''Murry Has a Little Lamb'', ''[[Bert & Ernie's Great Adventures]]'', and ''Word on the Street''.<ref>"[http://archive.sesameworkshop.org/aboutus/pressroom/presskits/season39/word_on_the_street.php About the Show]", ''Season 39 Press kit for Sesame Street'', 2008.</ref> ''Elmo's World'' was created by producers, after it was identified that the average age of ''Sesame Street'' viewers was heading downwards.<ref name="cnn30years">{{cite news | first = Jill | last = Brooke | title = 'Sesame Street' takes a bow to 30 animated years | url = http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9811/13/sesame.street/ | work = CNN.com | publisher = Turner Broadcasting System | location = Atlanta, Georgia, United States | date = 1998-11-13 | accessdate = 2008-09-16  | quote = But they manage to do it, introducing segments like "Elmo's World" for the little tots, and having Big Bird skits for the older ones. }}</ref> Created with 3-year-olds in mind,<ref>{{cite news | first = Melanie | last = Mcfarland | title = 'Powerpuff Girls': Smart, Sassy, Out To Save The World | url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19981113&slug=2783260 | work = The Seattle Times | publisher = Seattle Times Company | location = Seattle, Washington | pages =  | page =  | date = 1998-11-13 | accessdate = 2008-09-16  | quote = The show will also introduce a 15-minute segment called "Elmo's World," aimed at 3-year-olds. }}</ref> the segment brought a predictable regularity to the show, which ran contrary to its normal, varied assortment of segments. Because of its predictability, length, and young target audience, the segment has been derided by some critics and older fans, despite its success. The segment's low-skewing age was decided on after producers found the show was attracting that age bracket, even though it wasn't intended for it.

===Healthy Habits for Life===
In 2005, ''Sesame Street'' launched its [[Healthy Habits for Life]] programming, to encourage young viewers to lead more active and nutritious lifestyles.<ref name="friedman-educates" /> A major catalyst for this was data published by the US [[Centers for Disease Control]] regarding [[obesity]] in children.

Health content has existed on ''Sesame Street'' for years, but to a limited extent. In one instance press kits for a project were made available, news wires latched onto the story, and many major newspapers incorrectly reported that [[Cookie Monster]] was "going on a diet."<ref>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Buncombe | title = Cookie Monster to bring healthy diet message | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10119847 | work = The New Zealand Herald | publisher = APN News & Media | location = Auckland, New Zealand | pages =  | page =  | date = 2005 | accessdate = 2008-10-09  | quote = Cookie Monster is going on a diet }}</ref> In actuality there was no change to Cookie Monster's character. The new season featured a new segment with musician [[Wyclef Jean]] singing the praises of fruits and vegetables,<ref name="gitter">{{cite news | first = Emily | last = Gitter | title = More Sunny Days | url = http://www.nysun.com/parenting/more-sunny-days/11634/ | work = The Sun | publisher = ONE SL LLC | location = New York, New York | pages =  | page =  | date = 2005-04-04 | accessdate = 2008-10-09  }}</ref> similar to segments in the 1990s which featured Cookie doing nearly the same.

According to people from Sesame Workshop, {{cquote|Health has always been a part of our Sesame Street curriculum, therefore we will always be committed to ensuring kids are given information and messages that will help them become healthy and happy in their development. For season 36, we have turned up the dial in health, but it will always be part of our curriculum.<ref>[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/press_kit/qa.php Sesame Workshop Season 36 Press Kit], accessed [[28 June]] [[2006]].</ref>}}

The Workshop formed an Advisory Board consisting of experts such as [[Woodie Kessel]], M.D., M.P.H., the Assistant [[Surgeon General of the United States]].<ref>{{cite speech | title = Healthy Habits for Life: The Sesame Workshop Model | first = Jeanette | last = Betancourt, Ed.

==Production==
===Research department===
[[Image:Tv Sesame Street Telly Monster and a triangle.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''Sesame Street'' was one of the first kids television series devoted to promoting the arts. The art of [[Keith Haring]], filmmaking of [[William Wegman (photographer)|William Wegman]] and his [[Weimaraner]] dogs, Big Bird conducting the [[Boston Pops]], or simply Telly Monster playing a triangle.]]

''Sesame Street'' has operated with a rigorous research standard since its foundation, to ensure that programming addresses its viewers' needs. The Education and Research (E&R) department of Sesame Workshop, which started with [[Samuel Ball (educator)|Sam Ball]], then employed at Teachers College Columbia University and editor of the Journal of Educational Psychology. E&R is currently headed by [[Rosemarie Truglio|Rosemarie T. Truglio]], Ph.D. and [[Jeanette Betancourt]], Ed. D. Truglio states that the level of interaction between E&R, Content, and Production is "intimately hand-in-hand. They are not creating anything without our knowledge, our guidance and our review. We are involved in content development across all media platforms."<ref name="Q&A">[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/press_kit/pdf/Q_&_A_Susan_and_Rosemarie.pdf Sesame Workshop question and answer page.]</ref> This close-knit organizational structure has been an integral part of Sesame Workshop since it began.

Research is funded by government grants, corporate and private donations (including, recently, The Prudential Foundation for the Sesame Beginnings program), and the profits gained from the sale of Sesame Workshop merchandise.

===Writing process===
The following is a summary of the writing process used as of 2008.<ref>[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000605.php 11/15/2008: Brought to you by the letter from Syndi], a blog entry from the screenwriting blog of [[Jane Espenson]]</ref>

The writing process for the season begins with a couple of rounds of brainstorming that involve the head writer and the nine staff writers.  Following that, the producers assign each of the season's 26 episodes to specific writers, assignments that include information on that episodes muppet and human cast as well as its "letter of the day" and a "number of the day" (two long-running features of the format).  Writers then lead brainstorming sessions for each episode they are assigned.  The head writer meets with each of the writers, and then the writers produce the first drafts of each episode.  Once the head writer signs off on an episode (which may take several drafts), the research department gets a formatted copy of the script.  Research staff members do their review, giving comments to the head writer.  Anything that isn't vetoed by the head writer gets incorporated into the script by a writer's assistant, at which point the producers then review the script.  Producers pass on their comments to the show's executive producer, who meets with the head writer to resolve any remaining issues, with the final decision in the hands of the executive producer.  The process ends after one or more meetings are held to deal with any production-specific issues. 

When a script is factually correct, but includes gray areas that may not be comprehensible to children, the writers and research department work together to tweak everything. "A balance between content and humor"<ref name="Q&A" /> is always pursued, according to head of research [[Rosemarie Truglio]].

As the show spread internationally, live segments featuring children of other cultures were filmed, or intermixed with clips of world youth.

==Music==
Show creator Cooney once commented: "Music was always an important element in Jim [Henson]'s work. He employed music not only as a means to further his comic purposes, but also as a way of expressing his gentleness and the vulnerability hidden in his heart."<ref>{{cite book |editor=Cheryl Henson |title=It's not easy being green : and other things to consider |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |accessdate=2008-10-21 |edition=1 |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York, New York |isbn=|pages=200 |ref=Page 42. }}</ref>

The music created for ''Sesame Street'' and its specials have won multiple Primetime and Daytime Emmys.

When [[The Carpenters]] appeared on ''Sesame Street'', they were given Raposo's previous creation, "[[Sing (The Carpenters song)|Sing]]". The song "Sing" became a hit in 1973, reaching #3 on the [[Billboard]] charts, #1 on the adult contemporary charts. It wasn't the only early creation from the series to obtain mainstream success; "[[Rubber Duckie]]", sung by series character [[Ernie]], made #16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart in 1970;<ref name="friedman-educates" /> the song achieved an even higher position in Germany.

In 1992, British band [[Smart E's]] released ''Sesame's Treet'', a [[Techno music|techno]] dance track which sampled the "classic" version of the ''Sesame Street'' theme. It reached #2 on the [[UK Singles Chart|UK singles chart]].<ref>David Roberts (Managing Editor) ''et al.'', ''Guinness World Records: British Hit Singles & Albums'' (Eighteenth Edition), 2005, ISBN 1-904994-00-8</ref> Sesame Street has won 11** Grammy Awards, most recently for 2001 release ''Elmo and the Orchestra''.
The closing theme that was used during the full credits is titled "Funky Chimes"<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nUhDOqyDgo</ref>. This song, along with various samples of the [[Cookie Monster]] would be used in the [[MF DOOM]] song "Kookies."

==Cast information==
{{seealso|List of Sesame Street puppeteers}}

Much of the currently billed cast, both appearing as humans or performing Muppets, has remained with the production for a decade or more, thanks to the longevity of the program.

Non-Muppet characters on the series age as their performers do. Actresses such as [[Sonia Manzano]] (who plays Maria) and [[Alison Bartlett-O'Reilly]] (who plays Gina) have gone from being teens when introduced, 1971 and 1987 respectively, to motherly figures in more recent seasons. When [[Will Lee]] passed in 1982, his character of [[Mr. Hooper]] was written out of the program. Other actors to be on the series for over a decade include [[Desiree Casado]] (Gabi, since 1993), [[Emilio Delgado]] (Luis, 1971), Bill Irwin (Mr. Noodle, 1998), [[Loretta Long]] (Susan, 1969), [[Bob McGrath]] (Bob, 1969), [[Alan Muraoka]] (Alan, 1998), and Roscoe Orman (Gordon, 1974).

Currently credited actors that haven't met the decade mark are [[Olamide Faison]] (Miles, since 2003), [[Christopher Lawrence Knowings]] (Chris, 2007), and [[Nitya Vidyasagar]] (Leela, 2008). [[Linda Bove]] (Linda, 1972 to 2003) is the only actor to be on the show for more than a decade, and yet written out.

Over two hundred notable personalities have made guest appearances on the show, beginning with [[Carol Burnett]] on the first episode, and ranging from performers like [[James Brown]], [[The Goo Goo Dolls]], and [[Johnny Cash]], to political figures such as [[Laura Bush]] and [[Kofi Annan]].<ref name=washingtonfile1>Michael Jay Friedman, [http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2006&m=April&x=20060405165756jmnamdeirf0.4207117 Washington File: Honored children's show popular throughout the world], [[8 April]] [[2006]]. Annan was actually on his way to Norway to accept the 2001 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].</ref>  (See [[List of celebrity guest stars on Sesame Street]].)  By making a show that not only educates and entertains kids, but also keeps parents entertained and involved in the educational process, the producers hope to inspire discussion about the concepts on the show.

:''See also: Characters that are [[List of Sesame Street characters, in spin-offs|Exclusive to books or movies]], [[List of guest stars on Sesame Street|celebrities]], [[List of characters from international versions of Sesame Street|from international versions]]. Also [[List of Sesame Street characters, by order of debut|Characters ordered by date of debut]], [[List of Sesame Street characters by last known appearance|Characters ordered by last known appearance]]''

''Sesame Street'' is known for its [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] element and is inclusive in its casting, incorporating roles for disabled people, young people, senior citizens, Hispanic actors, Black actors, Asian actors, and others. While some of the puppets look like people, others are animal or "monster" puppets of different sizes and colors. This encourages children to believe that people come in all different shapes, sizes, and colors, and that no particular physical "type" is any better than another. Jim Henson commented that "The only kids who can identify along racial lines with the Muppets have to be either green or orange."<ref name=all>Phylis Feinstein, ''All About Sesame Street''. 1970."</ref>

In harmony with its multiculturalist perspective, the show pioneered the idea of occasionally inserting very basic Spanish words and phrases to help young children become acquainted with the concept of a foreign language, doing so almost three decades before [[Dora the Explorer]] made her debut on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]. Perhaps in response to the popularity of Dora, the recently revamped format gives [[Rosita, la Monstrua de las Cuevas|Rosita]], the bilingual muppet who "emigrated" in 1993 from the Mexican version of the show, more time in front of viewers, and also introduced the more formalized "Spanish Word of the Day" in every episode.{{Or|date=September 2008}}

Each of the puppet characters has been designed to represent a specific stage or element of early childhood, and the scripts are written so that the character reflects the development level of children of that age. This helps the show address not only the learning objectives of various age groups, but also the concerns, fears, and interests of children of different age levels.

===The Muppets===
{{Seealso|Muppets}}

[[Big Bird]] is an 8 ft 2-inch (250cm) tall yellow bird who lives in a large nest on an abandoned lot which is located in 123 Sesame Street's garbage heap. Big Bird is often visited by his friend [[Aloysius Snuffleupagus]], who is a very large, brown creature, which looks very much like the prehistoric wooly mammoth, and is known more popularly by his nickname "Snuffy". Various other Snuffleupaguses<!--this spelling is correct within SS--> have appeared on the show from time to time, most notably Snuffy's little sister Alice and his unnamed mother. Initially, Snuffy showed up when no one but Big Bird was around, leaving the rest of the neighborhood to think he was imaginary. In the mid-1980s, however, Snuffy was revealed to be "real" and incorporated into the regular cast of the show.

[[Oscar the Grouch]] lives with his pet worm [[Slimey the Worm|Slimey]] and his pet elephant [[List of Sesame Street characters|Fluffy]] in a garbage can in the heap. He is always grumpy, and loves everything that other people hate, and vice versa- he loves rainy days, but hates cute puppies and kittens.  His favorite thing in the world is rubbish (trash, or garbage), hence his signature song, "I Love Trash", and consequently, he lives in a garbage can.

[[Bert and Ernie]] two of the most-recognized Muppets, are roommates who share the [[basement apartment]] of 123 Sesame Street, and regularly engage in comic routines which showcase their odd-couple personalities. Ernie's flowerbox was once a hotspot for [[Twiddlebugs]], a colorful family of insects.  Ernie is a fun-loving orange Muppet who is always ready to play a game, and is always trying, often in vain, to interest Bert in his latest idea for one.  Bert usually ends up grudgingly, or in the case of the "Feelings Game", unwittingly, joining in.  Ernie especially loves his Rubber Duckie, who is the subject of several of Ernie's songs. Bert's idea of having fun involves doing things which most people find boring, like playing with [[pigeon]]s, and collecting [[paperclip]]s and [[bottle cap]]s.

[[The Bear family]], which is identified as the bears of ''[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]'', resides in ''Sesame Street''. This family, headed by [[Papa Bear (Sesame Street)|Papa Bear]] and [[Mama Bear (Sesame Street)|Mama Bear]], welcomed their second child [[Curly Bear (Sesame Street)|Curly Bear]], and [[Baby Bear (Sesame Street)|Baby Bear]] became a good friend of the monsters [[Telly Monster|Telly]] and [[Zoe (Sesame Street)|Zoe]], Mexico-born [[Rosita, la Monstrua de las Cuevas|Rosita]], and the furry, red preschooler [[Elmo]]. Elmo has his own segment near the end of each episode, in which viewers explore topics in ''[[Elmo's World]]''. New to ''Sesame Street'' is [[Abby Cadabby]], a [[fairy]]-in-training who attends Storybook Community School with Baby Bear.

[[Grover]]'s regular segment, ''Global Grover'', follows the self-described "cute, furry monster" around the world as he explores local cultures and traditions. Grover has had several notable roles over the years, often as a waiter or a superhero ([[Grover|Super Grover]]). In the waiter sketches, Grover's most frequent customer is [[Mr. Johnson (Sesame Street)|Mr. Johnson]], a [[Fat Blue|blue]] Muppet with very little hair on his head.  Grover always serves him inappropriate food, and the customer eventually loses his temper.

[[Cookie Monster]] is a character who, as his name would suggest, loves cookies, but doesn't seem to mind eating anything, edible or not. He currently has a segment of the show in which he fights with his conscience daily during [[Letter of the Day]], as he tries to control his urges to eat the letters, shown as icing on cookies. [[Prairie Dawn]] often attempts to help Cookie Monster refrain from eating the letters, but never succeeds and always leaves frazzled. 

[[Count von Count]] has fewer problems during the [[Number of the Day]] segment, where he indulges in counting until the mystery number is revealed by his pipe organ.  He is usually known simply as "The Count".  He has more songs than most of the other characters.  They are usually catchy songs, such as "The Batty Bat", and "The First Day of School", in which he tells the story of how he soon settled in at school, because he enjoyed counting his fellow pupils.

[[Humphrey and Ingrid]] are a married couple who have a baby named [[Natasha (Sesame Street)|Natasha]], and they are the proprietors of the hotel known as ''[[The Furry Arms]]'', which is located near the Sesame Street Subway station.  The hotel's bellhop, [[Benny Rabbit]], tends to be easily irritated, but begrudgingly helps out.  His sketch usually includes someone mistakenly referring to him as Bunny, which makes him very angry.

The [[Two-Headed Monster]] sounded out words coming together, and the [[Yip-Yips|Yip-Yip]] aliens, furry blue monsters with long, curly antennae, named after the only word in their vocabulary, discovered telephones and typewriters. For two seasons, [[List of Sesame Street characters#G|Googel]], [[List of Sesame Street characters#N|Narf]], [[List of Sesame Street characters#M|Mel]] and [[List of Sesame Street characters#P|Phoebe]] hung out in the ''[[Monster's Clubhouse]]''.

[[Kermit the Frog]] hosted the segment ''[[Sesame Street News Flash]]''.  The newsflashes were often takes on popular fairy tales, although there was also one about the first ever day at school, in which Kermit assists the inexperienced caveman teacher, Mr. James, in his lesson about the letter "N". In other segments, Kermit would play [[Double act|straight man]] to the wacky antics of other Muppets.

Incidental characters include television personality [[Guy Smiley]], who presented various game shows, such as "Beat The Time", and "Mystery Guest", construction workers [[Sully and Biff]], the large [[Herry Monster]] (who does not know his own strength), and [[The Big Bad Wolf]], who is not a terror to the Street. [[Forgetful Jones]], a cowboy with a short-term memory disorder, rode his trusty Buster the Horse with his girlfriend Clementine, and [[Rodeo Rosie]] was an early cowgirl. The [[Amazing Mumford]] tries his hardest to amaze with his magic, but his tricks always end up backfiring. "Sherlock Hemlock", was the self-proclaimed World's Greatest Detective, although he was actually rather hapless, and it was usually someone else, often his dog Watson, who solved the mystery.  Whenever he discovered a clue, he would say "Egad!".  He had only one song, "X Marks The Spot".

Don Music wrote songs such as "Yankee Doodle" and "Mary had a Bicycle". He always banged his head on the piano every time he forgot a word to each song. His favourite catchphrase is "Oh I will never get the word to my song,Never Never NEVER"!. Kermit always helped him every time he entered the studio.

===Other characters===
[[Image:Bob McGrath Sesame Place 2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Here Bob ([[Bob McGrath]]) appears at [[Sesame Place]] in 2007. McGrath performed various songs, signed autographs, and appeared in the theme park's daily parade, as seen.]]
{{Main|Human characters on Sesame Street}}
A slate of live actors pull the zaniness of the Muppets back to reality. They were not always meant to serve this purpose. The show lost test viewers' attention during the Street Scenes, meaning Muppets needed to be added, to hide the fact it was educational.

Music teacher Bob has been on ''Sesame Street'' since its inception. He dated [[Linda Bove|Linda]] the local [[New York Library]] librarian, who was the first regular deaf character on television.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Linda owns [[Barkley (Muppet character)|Barkley]], a Muppet dog. [[The Robinson family]] are an African-American family that includes schoolteacher Gordon, nurse Susan, and adopted son Miles. The Puerto Rican [[Rodriguez family]] include Maria and Luis, who ran the Fix-It Shop, which was turned into the Mail-It Shop; Maria gave birth to daughter Gabby in 1989, and her [[pregnancy]] was covered on the show. Luis is the longest-running Hispanic character in TV history.<ref name="friedman-educates" />

General store and restaurant operator [[Mr. Hooper|Harold Hooper]], played by actor [[Will Lee]], was a mainstay at [[Mr. Hooper's Store]]. When Lee died in 1982, the producers opted to help their young viewers deal with the death of someone they loved rather than cast a new actor in the role, and the character's death was discussed in a landmark 1983 episode.{{fn|Hooper}} Afterwards, Hooper's apprentice David took over, followed by later owners Gina, Mr. Handford, and Alan. Gina stopped running the store in the 1990s, to earn a PhD and became a veterinarian.

[[Mr. Noodle]] and his brother and sister (sister played by [[Kristin Chenoweth]]), who appear only in ''[[Elmo's World]]'' are meant to provide a vaudevillian perspective on subjects, contrary to most of the show's current human characters (though reminiscent of such earlier insert characters as Buddy and Jim, Larry and Phyllis, and The Mad Painter).<ref>[[wikiasite:muppet:Category:Character Pairs|Muppet Wiki: Character Pairs]]</ref>

Famous guest stars and various children from New York schools and day-care centers are a constantly changing part of the cast, including children who would later become celebrities, like actor [[Tyler James Williams]], actress [[Tatyana M. Ali]] and rapper [[GM Grimm]].

==Crew==
{{seealso|Crew of Sesame Street}}
Over the 39 seasons of ''Sesame Street'' hundreds, if not thousands, of people have worked on the show's cast and in their crew, producing Street scenes or segments, or working behind the scenes.{{Clarifyme|date=September 2008}}

==Reception==
===Ratings===
As a result of its success in revolutionizing the standards of children's television, ''Sesame Street'' inadvertently diminished its own audience share. According to PBS Research, the show went from a 2.0 average on [[Nielsen Media Research]]'s "people meters" in 1995–1996 to a 1.3 average in 2000–2001. Even with this decrease, ''Sesame Street'''s viewership in an average week came from roughly 5.6 million households with 7.5 million viewers. This placed ''Sesame'' at 8th place in the overall kids' charts, as of 2002. The program fares better among mothers age 18–49 who had children under the age of 3, taking second place. 

A format change helped the show's ratings, boosting them up 31% in February 2002 among children age 2–5, in comparison to its ratings in 2001. As of 2005, ''Sesame Street'' and three other PBS shows are in the top 10 shows for children ages 2 to 5.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/families/articles/1018pbscharacter1019.html |title=New character joins PBS |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2005-10-19}}</ref> As of season 36 in 2005, there were 8 million viewers daily.<ref name = "presskit"/>

===Criticism===
Some educators criticized the show when it debuted, as it emphasized [[cognitive]] learning rather than play and activities like other children's shows at the time.<ref>''Saturday Morning Censors: Television Regulation Before the V-Chip''. Heather Hendershot. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. 1998</ref> In addition it was believed that it would only worsen children's attention spans.

In a letter to the ''Boston Globe'', [[Boston University]] professor of education Frank Garfunkel commented "If what people want is for their children to memorize numbers and letters without regard to their meaning or use—without regard to the differences between children, then ''Sesame Street'' is truly responsive. To give a child 30 seconds of one thing and then to switch it and give him 30 seconds of another is to nurture irrelevance."

In the magazine ''[[Childhood Education]]'', Minnie P. Berson of [[State University of New York at Fredonia|SUNY Fredonia]] asked "Why debase the art form of teaching with phony pedagogy, vulgar sideshows, bad acting, and layers of smoke and fog to clog the eager minds of small children?"<ref>http://members.tripod.com/~hooperfan/chap12.html</ref>

For an animation on the letter "J", the writers included "a day in jail." This drew criticism from ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist [[Terrence O'Flaherty]], despite executive producer David Connell's assertion that kids are familiar with the word through shows like ''[[Batman]]'' and ''[[Superman]]'', and that "when you're trying to come up with a lot of words starting with J, you soon run short" of words they are already familiar with.

The series also met with criticism in its attempts to help the underprivileged. Educator Sister Mary Mel O'Dowd worried that the show might start to replace "personalized experiences". "If Sesame Street is the only thing ghetto kids have, I don't think it's going to do much good. It never hurts a child to be able to count to 10 or recognize the 26 letters of the alphabet. But without the guidance of a teacher, he'll be like one of our preschoolers who was able to write 'CAUTION' on the blackboard after seeing it on the back of so many buses, and told me 'That says STOP.'"<!--unreliable Tripod ref removed-->

''Sesame Street'' has long had to contend with those who disagree with its social content. [[Gerald S. Lesser]] comments in his book ''Children and Television: Lessons from Sesame Street'' that the show faced hostility in the southern United States when it first aired because it portrayed people of various races mingling peacefully.<ref>Gerald S. Lesser, ''Children and Television: Lessons from Sesame Street'', ISBN-10 0394714482.</ref> At first the [[Mississippi Public Broadcasting|Commission for Educational Television]] in Mississippi refused to air the show. However, the commission had no choice but to allow their local public television stations to air the show when commercial stations in Mississippi said they would air the program themselves.<ref name="mandel">{{cite journal | journal=The Journal of American Culture | last=Mandel | first=Jennifer| title=The Production of a Beloved Community: Sesame Street’s Answer to America’s Inequalities | date=2006 | accessdate = 2006-08-21 | publisher=Blackwell Publishing, Inc. | url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1542-734X.2006.00270.x | volume = 29 | pages = 3 | doi = 10.1111/j.1542-734X.2006.00270.x <!--Retrieved from URL by DOI bot-->}}</ref>

When ''Sesame Street'' premiered in Australia on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] in 1973 it replaced the long-running and popular Australian children's series ''[[Adventure Island (TV series)|Adventure Island]]''. Australian TV historians Tony Harrison <ref>Harrison, Tony: ''The Australian Film and Television Companion'' (Simon & Shuster, 1994), p.122</ref> and Albert Moran <ref>Moran, Albert: ''Moran's Guide to Australian TV Series'' (Australian Film Television & Radio School, 1993), p.42</ref> record that the cancellation of ''Adventure Island'' and its replacement with an American-made program caused a controversy and that questions were asked in federal parliament about the detrimental effects of the ABC's decision on local TV production.

===Rumors and urban legends===
While many rumors have been started about the series, a few have been widely promulgated and perpetuated over the years.

It has widely been suggested that [[Bert and Ernie]] are a [[gay]] couple, as they are apparently adult human males portrayed sharing a bedroom, though with separate beds. A 1980 collection of humorous essays by [[Kurt Andersen]], titled ''The Real Thing'', made light of the growing rumor. "Bert and Ernie conduct themselves in the same loving, discreet way that millions of gay men, women and hand puppets do. They do their jobs well and live a splendidly settled life together in an impeccably decorated cabinet."<ref>{{cite book | last = Andersen | first = Kurt | title = The Real Thing | format = Paperback | year = 1982 | month = February | publisher = Henry Holt & Co | location = New York, NY  | id = ISBN 0-03-060037-5 | pages = 180}}</ref> The rumor was promulgated repeatedly, so much so that by 1993, Sesame Workshop had a prepared statement to send out to people inquiring on the topic. In a 1994 effort to get the characters banned, Rev. Joseph Chambers stated on his radio show: "Bert and Ernie are two grown men sharing a house and a bedroom. They share clothes, eat and cook together and have blatantly effeminate characteristics. In one show, Bert teaches Ernie how to sew. In another, they tend plants together. If this isn't meant to represent a homosexual union, I can't imagine what it's supposed to represent."<ref>James R. Petersen, [http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/anijerry.htm The Ridiculous Right (say it ain't so, Barney)], December 1995</ref> Both Steve Whitmire as Ernie and Eric Jacobson as Bert have stated publicly that the characters are not gay.<ref>[[wikiasite:muppet:Ernie and Bert's Relationship|Muppet Wiki: Bert and Ernie's relationship]], accessed [[30 June]] [[2006]].</ref> The alleged relationship has been parodied on the animated series ''[[Family Guy]]'' and by ''[[Ernest & Bertram]]''. The latter, a 2002 short film that ran at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], was the subject of a cease and desist order from the legal department of Sesame Workshop.<ref>{{cite news | last=San Vicente | first=Romeo | title=Bert and Ernie outed from film festival | date=[[March 27]] [[2002]] | publisher=PlanetOut | url=http://www.planetout.com/pno/entertainment/news/splash.html?sernum=154}}</ref> The Broadway musical ''[[Avenue Q]]'' includes two characters similar to Bert and Ernie, named Rod and Nicky, one of which is gay.

The pair's relationship bears similarity to that of [[Laurel and Hardy]], who were also occasionally shown sleeping together; this became such a comedy staple as to be adopted by [[Morecambe and Wise]] in the 1970s, all of whom were similarly asexual. ''[[The Odd Couple]]'' is another, more apposite, contemporary comparison. Some adult viewers are upset by the assertions, as in their view, Ernie and Bert act like children, teenagers at the oldest, and are no more different than brothers or cousins who share a room.{{Or|date=August 2008}}

In 1990, puppeteer [[Jim Henson]]'s death spurred rumors that Ernie would be "killed off" in the show, much the way the character of Mr. Hooper was after actor [[Will Lee]]'s passing some years earlier.<ref>[Manchester] Union Leader   "Muppet Ernie Keeps His Life." 28 July 1991 (p. F1).</ref> Rumor said that he would be either killed by a vehicle, [[AIDS]], or [[cancer]]. There was no legitimacy to this rumor, but because producers took their time recasting a puppeteer for Ernie, the delay allowed the claims to burgeon. A spokesperson for the series was quoted as saying "Ernie is not dying of AIDS, Ernie is not dying of leukemia. Ernie is a puppet."<ref>{{cite news | first = Jefferson | last = Graham | title = Muppet Ernie Is Doing Just Fine | url =  | work = USA Today | publisher = | pages = 1 | page = D3 | date = 1992-04-30 | accessdate =   }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Brenda | last = Herrmann | title = Ernie Rumor Just Won't Die | work = Chicago Tribune | publisher =  | pages = 1 | page = C1 | date = 1992-11-10 | accessdate =   | quote =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Jon | last = Lender | title = Rest Assured, Ernie the Puppet Has Never Felt Better | work = Hartford Courant | publisher =  | pages = 1 | page = B1 | date = 1992-11-23 | accessdate =   | quote =  }}</ref><ref>Barbara Mikkelson, [http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/deadmupp.htm Urban Legends Reference Pages: Toe Tag Ernie], [[December 14]] [[1997]].</ref>

In 2002, Sesame Workshop announced that a character with [[HIV]] would be introduced to ''[[Takalani Sesame]]'', the [[South Africa]]n version of the show. Many [[conservatives]] and religious groups wrongly presumed that the American version would be getting a "gay Muppet."{{Fact|date=August 2008}} This concern came about presumably because of a perceived [[HIV and AIDS misconceptions#HIV can infect only homosexual men and drug users|connection between homosexuality and HIV]] in the United States, but the character with HIV is only present on this international version of the show. The character, [[Kami (Takalani Sesame)|Kami]], contracted HIV from a blood transfusion as an infant.

==Media information==
===Broadcast history===
The show is broadcast worldwide; in addition to the U.S. version, many countries have locally-produced versions adapted to local needs, some with their own characters, and in a variety of different languages. In [[Television in Canada|Canada]], beginning in 1970, 15-minute shows called ''Canada's Sesame Street'' were broadcast, and by 1972 an edited version of the one-hour American program was airing but with specially filmed Canadian segments, which featured the [[French language]]. In 1995 the American version was replaced by a half-hour long all-Canadian version of the series entitled ''[[Sesame Park]]''. Since the original ''Sesame Street'' was still accessible to Canadians, and more familiar, the format change didn't find acceptance with audiences and was taken off the air in 2002. Broadcasts in [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]] began in 1971. 

In the [[United Kingdom]] its introduction was controversial. The [[ITV]] network company [[London Weekend Television]] first showed the series in the [[London]] region in the early 1970s to much criticism (generally regarding its [[Americanism]]). In time the show was subsequently broadcast by other [[ITV]] regions in the early 1980s, after which it moved to [[Channel 4]], where it was a lunch-time fixture for many years through to the early 2000s. Later broadcasts of the show featured the hour-long episodes in a format of two ½-hour episodes. 120 countries have aired the show, many of which partnered with Sesame Workshop to create local versions.

In recent years ''Sesame Street'' has made what area educators consider to be critical advances in its international versions. In the late 1990s versions appeared in [[China]] and [[Russia]] as these countries shifted away from communism. There is also a joint [[Israel]]i-[[Palestinian]]-[[Jordan]]ian project, called ''Sesame Stories'', which was created with the goal of promoting greater cultural understanding.The show along with [[123 Sesame Street]] and [[Sesame Street Unpaved]] aired on the half [[Sesame Workshop]]/[[Viacom]] [[Noggin (TV channel)|Noggin]] until 2005.

A series of ''Sesame Street'' telefilms have featured the characters on day trips or in foreign countries. ''[[Don't Eat the Pictures: Sesame Street at the Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'' (1983) saw the cast locked in the gallery overnight; Big Bird and Snuffy help a cursed boy pharaoh. NBC's ''[[Big Bird in China]]'' (1983) followed Big Bird, Barkley, and their new friend Xiao Foo traveling through China to find Feng Huang, the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] bird. In ''[[Big Bird in Japan]]'' (1988), the titular character gets lost. ''[[Out to Lunch (1974 special)|Out to Lunch]]'' (1974) features the cast of ''Sesame Street'' and ''[[The Electric Company]]'' taking over [[ABC News]]. Big Bird turned six in ''Big Bird's Birthday or Let Me Eat Cake'' (1991), despite being referred to as four years old previously. ''[[CinderElmo]]'' (1999) was a FOX special, with [[Keri Russell]] as the princess looking for her match in the kingdom.

The ''Sesame Street Special'' (1988) also included many guest performances.

Holiday special ''[[Christmas Eve on Sesame Street]]'' (1978) won an Emmy Award, while another special that year, ''[[A Special Sesame Street Christmas]]'' (1978), has mostly unfavourable reviews. ''[[Elmo Saves Christmas]]'' is a movie about Elmo who wishes Christmas is everyday when he receives a snow globe that lets him wish for anything when he rescues Santa Claus stuck in his chimney , Elmo must go back in time to change things, Anniversary specials include ''A Walking Tour of Sesame Street with James Earl Jones'' (1979), ''[[Sesame Street: 20 And Still Counting]]'' (1989), ''All-Star 25th Birthday: Stars and Street Forever'' (1994) and ''Sesame Street Jam: A Musical Celebration'' (1994), and ''[[The Street We Live On]]'' (2004).

===Feature films===
[[Image:Follow that bird theatrical poster.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Follow that Bird'' movie poster]]
Two theatrical wide-release feature films based on the series have been made.

Co-produced with [[Warner Bros.]], the 1985 film ''[[Sesame Street Presents: Follow that Bird]]'' revolved around a social worker forcing Big Bird into adoption. Big Bird gets homesick and tired of his adoptive parents, and heads back to New York, when he is kidnapped by evil carnival leaders (played by [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] and [[Joe Flaherty]]); the residents of Sesame Street launch a cross-country search to find him.<ref>{{cite news | first = Walter | last = Goodman | title = FILM: BIG BIRD ON THE BIG SCREEN WITH THE 'SESAME STREET' GANG | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901EEDF1038F931A3575BC0A963948260  | work = The New York Times | publisher = The New York Times Company | location = New York City | pages =  | page =  | date = 1985-08-02 | accessdate = 2008-09-15  }}</ref>

In the second ''Sesame Street'' theatrical film, 1999's ''[[The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland]]'', fourteen years after ''Follow That Bird'', [[Elmo]] spends time with his favorite blanket. After [[Zoe]] accidentally tears the blanket, when Elmo refuses to share, the blanket winds up in Grouchland, ruled by the Queen of Trash ([[Vanessa L. Williams]]). Elmo ventures forth, to rescue his blanket from the villainous [[Huxley]] ([[Mandy Patinkin]]). Soon, the rest of the ''Sesame Street'' gang follow in pursuit.<ref>{{cite news | first = Liam | last = Lacey | title = Elmo teaches hell's residents to share | url = http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/moviePrint/MOVIEREVIEWS/19991004/TAELMO/TV/?print=true | work = The Globe and Mail | publisher = Bell Globemedia Interactive Inc. | location = Toronto, Ontario | pages =  | page =  | date = 1999-10-04 | accessdate = 2008-09-15  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Anita | last = Gates | title = FILM REVIEW; That Very Special Blue B-L-A-N-K-E-T | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE5D6153EF932A35753C1A96F958260&scp=2&sq=elmo%20in%20grouchland&st=cse | work = The New York Times | publisher = The New York Times Company | location = New York City | pages =  | page =  | date = 1999-10-01 | accessdate = 2008-09-15  }}</ref>

===Merchandising and endorsement===
[[Image:Book Brought to You by . . . Sesame Street|right|thumb|The cover of the book ''Brought to You by . . . Sesame Street! #1'' shows several of Sesame Street's muppet characters]]
''Sesame Street'' is known for its extensive merchandising, which includes many books, magazines, video/audio media, and toys. A percentage of the money from any Sesame Workshop product goes to help fund ''Sesame Street'' or its international co-productions.<ref name = "presskit"/>

Current licensors include [[Fisher-Price]], [[Nakajima USA]], [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] (Build-An-Elmo, Build-A-Cookie Monster, And Build-A-Big Bird), [[Hasbro]] ([[Monopoly (game)|Sesame Street Monopoly]]), [[Wooly Willy]], [[Betty Crocker]] (Elmo Fruit Snacks), [[C&D Visionary]] (air freshners) and [[Children's Apparel Network]]. Former licences include [[Applause]], [[Child Dimension]], [[Gibson Greetings]], [[Gorham Fine China]], [[Ideal Toys]], [[Milton Bradley Company]], [[Nintendo]], [[Palisades Toys]], [[Questor]], [[Radio Shack]], [[Tyco]], and the [[Western Publishing Company]]. [[Creative Wonders]] (a partnership between [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[Electronic Arts]]) produced Sesame Street software for the Macintosh, since at least 1995 and on the PC since 1996<!--1994?-->; [[Atari]] produced ''Sesame Street'' games in 1983. Before going bankrupt, [[Palisades Toys]] was to release a line of deluxe series action figures, for adults, as part of Sesame Workshop's push to expand into retro products for teens and adults.

[[Tickle Me Elmo]] was one of the fastest selling toys of the 1996 season. That product line was and still is one of the most successful products Mattel has ever launched. Both it and its most notable successor, TMX, have caused in-store fights. Elmo starred in a [[Christmas special]] that year, in which he wished every day of the year was Christmas.<ref>{{cite news | last=Gliatto | first=Tom | title=Elmo Saves Christmas | date=[[December 23]] [[1996]] | publisher=People | url=http://search.epnet.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=rch&an=9612201526}}, accessed in EBSCOhost.</ref>

After [[Fisher-Price]] recalled a large number of ''Sesame Street'' brand toys (among multiple licenses) in 2007, Sesame Workshop announced that they would independently inspect the products of all manufacturers. It went so far as to threaten withdrawing entirely from toy licensing, if it were not satisfied with the manufacturer's guarantees.<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2007/09/21/2007-09-21_elmos_to_get_sesame_st_testing.html Elmos to get 'Sesame St.' testing<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Its fiction books are published on five continents, primarily by [[Random House]] in North America. Over 18 million ''Sesame Street'' books and magazines were purchased in 2005.<ref name = "presskit"/> The books often mention that children do not have to watch the show to benefit from its publications.

[[Image:Elmo and Bookaneers.JPG|left|thumb|250px|''Elmo and the Bookaneers'', a stage show at [[SeaWorld Orlando]].]]
Live touring show ''[[Sesame Street Live]]'' presents costumed actors and dancers as characters from the series, in original plots. In recent years, VEE has had four touring casts, each performing a unique multi-million dollar budget show. Each season, the tours reach 160 different cities across North America, reaching 2 million people annually. Since the first production of ''Sesame Street Live'' on [[September 17]] [[1980]], 48 million children and their parents have seen the show performed, across the world.<ref name="sslpress">''Sesame Street Live'' Press Kit, Minneapolis MN: Vee Corporation, 2004.</ref>

Langhorne, Pennsylvania, United States, is the long-time home to ''Sesame Street'' theme park [[Sesame Place]]. [[SeaWorld Orlando]] started a stage show called ''Elmo and the Bookaneers'' in 2007. Another theme park, ''[[Parque Plaza Sésamo]]'', exists in [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]], and [[Universal Studios Japan]] includes a three-dimensional movie based on the show.

The [[Sesame Beginnings]] line, launched in mid-2005, consists of apparel, health and body, home, and seasonal products. The products in this line are designed to accentuate the natural interactivity between infants and their parents. Most of the line is exclusive to a family of Canadian retailers that includes [[Loblaws]], [[Fortinos]], and [[Zehrs]].

Although ''Sesame Street'' characters occasionally endorse non-educational products, they rarely appear in their puppet form, to limit the suggestion to children that the characters are formally endorsing the product. The Muppets do appear in puppet form to endorse select causes. Big Bird has promoted safe seating practices and the wearing of seatbelts, for the [[Ford Motor Company]],<ref>{{cite news | first=Thomas L. | last=Bryant | url=http://search.epnet.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=rch&an=9706193803 | title=Big Bird and Ford | publisher=Road & Track | pages= | page= | date=July 1997 | accessdate=2006-03-02}}, accessed through EBSCOhost.</ref> while Grover promoted a new course on children's informal learning, created by [[Harvard University]] with Sesame Workshop.<ref>{{cite news | first=Debra | last=Viadero | url=http://search.epnet.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&an=16357051 | title=Grover Promotes Harvard Course | publisher=Education Week | pages=1/5th | page=6 | date=[[2 March]] [[2005]] | accessdate=2006-03-02}} The course itself was developed by professor Joseph Blatt, who told Education Week "it focuses on how to harness the positive power of the media to improve children's health, particularly problems that stem from alarming levels of obesity among youngsters nationwide." Guests to the course include Sesame Workshop staff. Students are required to pitch media projects to promote healthy behaviors among 6- to 9-year-olds to Sesame executives at the end of the course.</ref> Elmo has appeared before the US Education Appropriations Subcommittee to urge more spending on music in schools.<ref>Bruce Morton, "Mr. Elmo goes to Washington". Atlanta, GA: ''CNN'', [[24 April]] [[2002]]. The characters of ''Sesame Street'' have a major presence in Washington. President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1997 inaugural guests included [[Elmo]].

''Barrio Sésamo'', ''Plaza Sésamo'', ''Sesamstraße'', ''Sesame English'' and ''Sesamstraat'' have all had merchandise of their local characters. ''Shalom Sesame'' videos and books have also been released.

In 2004, [[Copyright Promotions Licensing Group]] (CPLG) became Sesame Workshop's licensing representative for [[The Benelux]],<ref>[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/aboutus/inside_press.php?contentId=11877128 SESAME WORKSHOP NAMES NEW LICENSING REP FOR THE BENELUX]</ref> adding to their United Kingdom representation.<ref>Previously [[The Licensing Company Ltd.]] held the British rights to ''Sesame Street''. Its licensees included [[Reed Books Children's Publishing]] for books.

===International co-productions===
{{mainarticle|Sesame Street internationally}}
[[Image:Tv sesame park basil the bear.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Basil the Bear from Canada's [[Sesame Park]], in a knight's armour. The puppet, as well as most of the series cast, is displayed at the [[CBC Museum]].]]
Some countries have co-produced their own unique versions of ''Sesame Street'', in which the characters and segments represent their country's cultures. Other countries simply air a dubbed version of ''Sesame Street'', or a dubbed version of ''[[Open Sesame]]''. Among various other countries, Australia has and still does broadcast the American version on the ABC and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] had broadcast the American show, on [[Channel 4]] until 2001 when it was replaced with Henson production ''[[The Hoobs]]''.

Dubbed versions include ''Seesamtie'' in Finnish, ''Boneka Sesame'' in Indonesian, ''Sesam Opnist Þú'' in Icelandic, ''Sezame otevři se'' in Czech, ''Sesamo Apriti'' in Italian, ''Sezame, otevři se'' in Czech, and ''Taman Sesame'' in Malay. In 2004, one Japanese network cancelled the dubbed American ''Sesame'', while another created a local version. In [[New Zealand]], locally produced segments entitled "Korero [[Māori]]" (in English: "let's speak Māori") were inserted into episodes to educate children in the [[Māori language]]. Likewise, in [[Canada]] the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] substituted locally-produced [[French language]] segments in place of the [[Spanish language]] portions of the US version. Spanish program ''[[La Cometa Blanca]]'' also includes segments from ''Sesame Street''.

{{seealso|List of characters from international versions of Sesame Street}}

The popular, long-running [[United Kingdom|British]] children's series ''[[Rainbow (TV series)|Rainbow]]'' was originally conceived as a British equivalent of ''Sesame Street'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Jeff|title=The Guinness Television Encyclopedia|publisher=Guinness|id=ISBN 0-85112-744-4|year=1995}}</ref> but holds no official affiliation with Sesame Workshop.

On Sesame Workshop's website for the program, on the games, the voices for the Muppet characters in the games are done by their respective puppeteers (for example, Fran Brill voices Zoe, Kevin Clash voices Elmo, etc).

===Funding===
[[Image:Nader-sesame01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Public advocate [[Ralph Nader]] appearing on the show in the 1988 special ''[[The Sesame Street Special]]'', with the character Bob, singing "[[People in Your Neighborhood]]".]]

Funding for ''Sesame Street'' is derived from a variety of public, private, and corporate sources. [[Beaches Family Resorts]], [[McDonald's]], [[Earth's Best Organic]], [[New Balance]], and [[American Greetings]] are considered "Sponsors" of the show, receiving ad-like spots before the program, when it is shown on PBS. <ref>{{cite web | title = Thanks to Our Funding Partners | publisher = Sesame Workshop | date =  | url = http://www.sesameworkshop.org/fundingpartners | accessdate = September 15, 2008}}</ref> The [[The Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]<ref>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting did not fund the American production of ''Sesame Street'' from 1972–1991, or from 1998–2000.</ref>. a [[Ready to Learn]] grant,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pbskids.org/read/about.html | title = The Ready To Learn Initiative | accessdate = 2008-09-16 | work = PBS Kids raising readers | publisher = PBS | location =   | quote = Between the Lions, Sesame Street, SUPER WHY, and WordWorld continue to be part of the PBS KIDS Ready To Learn initiative programming, and fun new shows are on the way!

Sesame Street's Web site was one of the first to include educational materials, for both parents and children. "There are downloadable games plus number- and alphabet-coloring pages for the children.

Upon the 1973 death of George Woodbridge, who played the titular character in the British series ''[[Inigo Pipkin]]'', the third season of the show dealt with the character's passing. The series was renamed ''Pipkins'', to reflect the change in cast.
