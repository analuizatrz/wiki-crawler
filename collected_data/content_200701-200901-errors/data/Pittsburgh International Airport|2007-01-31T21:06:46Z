'''Pittsburgh International Airport''' {{Airport codes|PIT|KPIT|PIT}} is situated in the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] suburb of [[Findlay Township, Pennsylvania|Findlay Township]] at the intersection of [[I-376]] and [[I-576]], with portions of the airport located in [[Moon Township, Pennsylvania|Moon Township]]. It has been a [[focus city]] for [[US Airways]], and until 2004 was the airline's largest hub. The airport now retains the title of being [[US Airways]]'s largest secondary hub.  Pittsburgh is a hub for [[Air Midwest]] and [[Colgan Air]] as well.

==Scope==
Pittsburgh International Airport occupies more than 12,900 acres (45 km²), making it the fourth largest airport in the nation<ref>[http://pittsburgh.about.com/library/weekly/aa122100a.htm About.com: Pittsburgh International Airport]</ref>.  It is so large that both Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]] and Atlanta's [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield-Jackson]] could comfortably fit within the airport's land area, with room to spare.  Pittsburgh International is within three hours' flying time of all locations east of the [[Mississippi River]] and within one hour of any location in the northeast or eastern Midwest.  65% of Americans are within just a two and a half hour flight of the facility.  It is served by over 20 commercial carriers with 119 non-stop destinations averaging 580 commercial carrier flights per day.  In the average year, the airport serves 20 million passengers; however, with [[US Airways]]' de-hubbing of the airport, that number has remained steady at about half that, and looks to serve approximately 10 million in [[2006]] <ref>[http://www.pitairport.com/NewsEventsServlet]</ref>

The airport's nine cargo carriers account for over 200 million lbs (90 million kg) of freight per year<ref>[http://www.flypittsburgh.com/AboutUsServlet?option=pit_factsheet Pittsburgh International Airport: Fact Sheet]</ref>. Three cargo buildings provide more than 183,000 sq ft (17,000 m²) of warehouse capacity and over 450,000 sq ft (42,000 m²) of apron space.  The complex also serves as the headquarters for two Air Force units and the home base for the Pennsylvania Air National Guard.  Pittsburgh International hosts an average of 20 military flight operations per day in its role as host to the region's defense center.

==Innovations==
Pittsburgh International has also been the first in the world in several key innovations.  It was the first airport to offer free [[Wi-Fi]] throughout its passenger terminal<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04057/277604.stm Wireless computer users rush to take advantage of free access, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (2004-02-26)]</ref>, one of the first to deploy dozens of portable defibrillators<ref>[http://www.early-defib.org/05_02_06202001.html Pittsburgh International Airport launches AED program, ''National Center for Early Defibrillation'' (2001-06-11)]</ref>, is slated to be the first "Joint Readiness Center"<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05239/561132.stm Joint readiness center, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (2005-08-27)]</ref>, and developed the first volunteer ambassador program <ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05239/561033.stm Airport ambassadors deploy to assist domestic travelers, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (2005-08-27)]</ref>.  

The airmall at the airport also provided several world's firsts in both featuring fair "street prices" and being the first major and diverse shopping center located within an airport terminal<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2003/09/25-airport-cities.htm New 'cities' springing up around many U.S. airports "USA Today" (2003-09-25)]</ref>, as well as the first airport to have two Xpress Spas in its retail area. Pittsburgh International Airport also has electronic parking<ref>[http://www.flypittsburgh.com/NewsEventsServlet?option=pressArchives&shortdescp=50 Pittsburgh International Airport: Press Releases (2004-10-11)]</ref>. Pittsburgh also was the first airport to offer fare alert emails {{fact}}.

==Passenger complex==
The commercial side of the complex has three main terminal buildings housing five terminals (all connected by subway or peoplemover), 75 commercial gates with 105 international and national retailers in the "Airmall" <ref>[http://retailtrafficmag.com/mag/retail_buying_fly/ "Buying on the Fly" Retail Traffic Magazine (2000/05/01)]</ref> and a Hyatt Regency hotel.  Both the landside and midfield terminals have been used as a model to other airports in efficiency; it is possible for a traveler to only take only a few steps to travel more than half a mile from parking to airplane<ref>[http://www.flypittsburgh.com/AboutUsServlet?option=pit_background Pittsburgh International Airport: Background]</ref> and for airlines the revolutionary airside design of the complex makes Pittsburgh one of the nation's "best gateways".  The airport uses one large passenger screening area which connects to an automated underground tram system which ferries passengers to the intersection of terminals A, B, C, and D.  The original design of the air-side terminals included a large amount of retail and restaurant space.  The name "Airmall" conveyed the intent to blend the airport with a shopping mall.

==Air Force==
Since its inception in the 1940s Pittsburgh International has served a second purpose as an important regional center for the [[U.S. Air Force]].  It currently hosts the [[Air Force Reserve]] Base that is headquarters to the [[911th Airlift Wing]] on its northeastern side, and the  [[171st Air Refueling Wing]], Pennsylvania Air National Guard Base on its southeastern side.  In its military role it has long been the headquarters for the Pennsylvania [[Air National Guard]], as well as its largest base of operations.  Although the Air Reserve and Air National Guard maintain a great presence on that corner of the complex, the shuttering of some of the Air Force facilities in recent decades has led to the growth of a new tenant for that equipment at Pittsburgh.  The [[FAA]] has taken over much of the excess infrastructure that the Air Guard and Reserve does not need, making Pittsburgh recently an important regional center for the agency.  Pittsburgh's military heritage is also rekindled each summer as the complex hosts one of the largest air shows on the east coast, "Wings over Pittsburgh". Roughly 200,000 spectators attended the two-day show in 2005.

==Runways==
Pittsburgh's size provides enough land for four massive runways (the shortest is 8,100 feet (2469 m), the longest is just shy of 12,000 feet (3658 m) long) with enough acreage to double the number of runways to 8 if neccessary (a 9,500 ft., a 8,500 ft. and two 8,200 ft. runways, see capacity plan under external links for more information).  The terminal complex has also been built with the idea of easy additions of more than two dozen gates to easily accommodate any expansions in the number of runways for the airport.  The Air National Guard and the two Air Force Reserve companies also have the option of several acres as well as a possible runway for any expansion that may be necessary for their role.
