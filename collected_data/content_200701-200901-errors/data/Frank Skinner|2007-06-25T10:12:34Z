'''Frank Skinner''', (born '''Christopher Graham Collins''' on [[28 January]], [[1957]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[writer]] and [[comedian]], best known for the hit football song "[[Three Lions]]" with [[David Baddiel]] and [[The Lightning Seeds]] as well as presenting, alongside Baddiel, the hit comedy show [[Fantasy Football League]].

==Career==
===Youth and Early Career (1957-1993)===

Born at [[Sandwell General Hospital]], [[West Bromwich]], Collins grew up in [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[England]]. He attended Moat Farm Infant School from 1961 to 1964, St. Hubert's Roman Catholic Junior School from 1964 to 1968, and then [[Warley High School|Oldbury Technical Secondary School]] from September 1968. 

He passed 2 [[O-level]]s in the summer of 1973 and was allowed to take [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] in English Language and Art, along with several O-level re-sits, at Oldbury Technical School Sixth Form. But he was caught embezzling the school meals service by selling cut-price meal vouchers to pupils and expelled just six weeks into his studies.

For several years he was known to the police after a series of minor offences including putting a length of pipe across a road and causing a car crash, although he never ended up in prison.

But he soon turned his life around by taking 4 A-levels (including English Language and Literature) at night school and then graduating from the Birmingham Polytechnic, now known as [[UCE Birmingham]] in [[1985]] with a degree in English Literature. After graduating, he spent four years as an English lecturer at [[Halesowen College]], whilst being a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] on the side, before quitting his job in 1989 to pursue his comedy career full-time. During this period he quit drinking due to [[influenza]] and remains one of the UK's most high-profile recovering [[alcoholic]]s.

Collins took on the pseudonym '''Frank Skinner''' when the actors' union [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] told him there was already someone of the same name on their books (their rules do not permit two members with identical names). He took the name from a member of his late father's [[dominoes]] team.

Skinner had performed his first stand-up gig in 1987 and made his [[television]] debut a year later. In 1990 he co-wrote and starred in a weakly-received [[sitcom]], ''[[Packet of Three (TV series)|Packet Of Three]]'', on [[Channel 4]] but continued to see his reputation as a stand-up grow. He won the 1991 [[Perrier Award]] at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], beating [[Jack Dee]] and [[Eddie Izzard]].

===Career Peak (1994-2005)===

He often works with best friend and ex-flatmate [[David Baddiel]], notably on the popular late night entertainment show ''[[Fantasy Football League]]'', from 1994 to 2004 and on ''[[Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned]]'' from 2000 to 2005. 

The duo also co-wrote and performed the [[soccer|football]] song "[[Three Lions]]" with the [[Lightning Seeds]] and the [[England national football team]] for [[Euro 96]], and re-released it for the [[1998 World Cup]]. Both times the song reached #1 in the UK charts and it is widely regarded as the best of the English football anthems. 

In 2001, he released his [[autobiography]] "Frank Skinner by Frank Skinner", which became an instant bestseller. An accompanying TV show, "Frank Skinner on Frank Skinner", in which Skinner showed where he lived as a child and interviews with Skinner, his friends and family members, was recorded and shown on [[ITV]] in 2001.

From 1995 to 1998, Skinner had his own chat show on [[BBC]] One, and moved it to [[ITV]] in 1999, where it ran until late 2005. He has appeared in a number of self-written sitcoms, including ''[[Blue Heaven]]'' (1994) and ''[[Shane (UK TV series)|Shane]]'' (2004). In 2003, he was listed in [[The Observer]] as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. He has lived in London since the beginning of his comedy career in 1991, but still supports [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]] and [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club]]. When West Bromwich Albion won promotion to the [[FA Premier League]] in 2004, he featured in an Express and Star article which commemorated the club's promotion.

===Post ITV (2006-present)===

In 2005, Skinner announced he was going to leave behind his television work in favour of returning to the stand-up comedy circuit. It was rumoured that ITV's decision not to offer him a new contract was the main driving force behind this decision. A second series of ''Shane'' has been made, but is lost amongst the wrangling. 

In February 2006, he received an [[honorary degree]] from the [[University of Central England in Birmingham|University of Central England]]. [http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/feb06/dr820203.php]

Skinner and David Baddiel covered the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] by podcast for ''[[The Times]]'', a British broadsheet. The podcasts received a nomination for the 2007 Sony Radio Academy Awards. 

In May 2006, he appeared as a guest speaker at the [[Oxford Union]].

Frank recently learned to play the banjo for a celebrity reality show, [[Play It Again#2: Frank Skinner.2C playing the banjo.|Play It Again]], which was broadcast on the BBC in March 2007. He had 3 months to learn the instrument before competing in a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] festival. In the end, despite progressing well, he got very nervous when performing and made many mistakes.

In 2007, he announced a new live stand-up tour, his first for 10 years. On 1st May he performed a warm-up gig before a sell-out crowd at the [[Swindon]] Arts Centre http://www.swindon.gov.uk/artsandculture/artscentre/artscentrewhatson.htm[http://www.swindon.gov.uk/artsandculture/artscentre/artscentrewhatson.htm], and followed this up on 26th May at the 150 capacity Forest Arts, [[New Milton]]. He will perform in venues around the UK and Ireland during September and October 2007. There is a list of the tour at http://frankskinner.net/live.aspx

He will executive produce a [[CBS]] pilot version of ''Shane''. A novel called "Thunderman and Jeff Phillips" is due in August 2007.

Skinner is returning to ITV with his new show ''Frank Skinner's Tough Gig'', which airs on Tuesday [[12 June]] [[2007]] at 10pm.
