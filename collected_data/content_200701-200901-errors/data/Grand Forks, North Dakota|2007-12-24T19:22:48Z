{{main|History of Grand Forks, North Dakota}}

Prior to settlement by Europeans or Americans, the area where the city now sits — at the forks of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] and [[Red Lake River]] — had been an important meeting and trading point for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Early [[France|French]] explorers, [[animal trapping|fur trappers]], and traders called the area ''Les Grandes Fourches'' meaning "The Grand Forks". By the 1740s, ''Les Grandes Fourches'' was an important [[trading post]] for French fur trappers.<ref name="history"/> A U.S. post office was established on the site on [[June 15]], [[1870]] and the name was changed to "Grand Forks."<ref name="history"/> [[Alexander Griggs]], a [[steamboat]] captain, is regarded as being "The Father of Grand Forks."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prairiepublic.org/programs/datebook/bydate/03/1003/102603.jsp |title=Dakota Datebook, October 20,2003: Griggs and Grand Forks |accessdate=2007-06-08 |format= |work=North Dakota Public Radio}}</ref> Griggs' steamboat froze in the Red River on a voyage in late 1870, forcing the captain and his crew to spend the winter camping at Grand Forks. Griggs platted the community in 1875 and Grand Forks was officially incorporated on [[February 22]], [[1881]].<ref name="history"/> The city quickly grew after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] in 1880 and the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] in 1887.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grandforkshistory.com/index_files/page0002.htm |title=Historic Grand Forks |accessdate=2007-06-08 |format= |work=Grand Forks County Historical Society}}</ref> In 1883, the [[University of North Dakota]] was established, six years before North Dakota was formally recognized as an independent state born from the [[Dakota Territory]].<ref name="und"/>

The first half of the 1900s saw steady growth and the development of new neighborhoods farther south and west of [[Downtown Grand Forks]]. The 1920s saw the construction of the [[public ownership|state-owned]] [[North Dakota Mill and Elevator]] on the north side of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ndmill.com/ndmill/new/history.cfm |title=History |accessdate=2007-06-08 |format= |work=North Dakota Mill and Elevator }}</ref> In 1954, Grand Forks was chosen as the site for an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] base.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://public.grandforks.amc.af.mil/documents/History2003.pdf |title=History of the Grand Forks Air Force Base |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format=PDF| work= }}</ref> [[Grand Forks Air Force Base]] brought thousands of new jobs and residents to the community. The military base and the University of North Dakota would become integral pieces of the city's economy. The second half of the 20th century saw Grand Forks spreading further away from the older part of town.<ref name="history"/> [[Interstate 29]] was built on the western side of the city and two enclosed shopping malls – [[Grand Cities Mall|South Forks Plaza]] and [[Columbia Mall (Grand Forks)|Columbia Mall]] – were built on the south side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/library/Collections/og1242.html |title=Grand Forks, Mayor's Office |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work=University of North Dakota }}</ref>

The city was struck by a [[1997 Red River Flood|severe flood in 1997]], causing extensive damage.<ref name="flood"/> With [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] upstream from the bulk of the waters and [[Winnipeg]] with its flood control structures, Grand Forks became the hardest hit city in the [[Red River Valley]]. During the height of the flooding, a major fire also destroyed eleven buildings in the downtown area. Many neighborhoods had to be demolished to make way for a new [[levee]] system, which was ultimately completed ten years later. The land bordering the Red River was turned into a massive park known as the [[Greater Grand Forks Greenway]]. Since the flood, Grand Forks has seen both public and private developments throughout town. Two new, large sports venues opened in 2001, including the [[Alerus Center]]<ref name="alerus"/> and the [[Ralph Engelstad Arena]].<ref name="rea"/> In 2007, the [[Winnipeg]]-based [[Canad Inns]] hotel chain opened a 13-story hotel and waterpark adjacent to the Alerus Center.<ref name="canad">{{cite web |url=http://www.canadinns.com/grandforks/

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Grand Forks, North Dakota}}

Due to its location in the [[Great Plains]] and its distance from both mountains and oceans, the city has an extreme continental climate. This type of climate is distinguished by four very distinct seasons and great variation in temperatures over very short periods of time. As there are no nearby mountain ranges or bodies of water to ameliorate the climatic conditions, Grand Forks lies exposed to numerous weather systems including bitterly cold Arctic high pressure systems. The city is known for its long, cold, and snowy winters. In sharp contrast, summers are warm to hot and often quite humid with frequent thunderstorms. Depending on the year, warm weather can continue beyond to October, or come to an abrupt end soon after [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]]. Spring and autumn are short and highly variable seasons. The lowest temperature ever recorded was -43°F (-42°C) on [[January 30]], [[2004]] and the highest temperature ever recorded was 109°F (43°C) on [[July 6]], [[1936]].

[[Image:GrandForksMap.png|right|250px|thumb|Map of the city of Grand Forks]]
Grand Forks has several distinct neighborhoods. The area adjacent to the Red River developed first so this is where some of the oldest neighborhoods, including the downtown area, can be found. The area between downtown and the [[University of North Dakota]] campus was another early growth area and historic properties can be found here as well.

[[Downtown Grand Forks]] is the oldest part of the city and thus contains many historic buildings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grandforksgov.com/National%20Register.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places |accessdate=2005-12-24 |format=PDF| work=City of Grand Forks, North Dakota}}</ref> It is the governmental center of the city and county.

In general, the newer neighborhoods of Grand Forks are in the southern and western parts of town. The 32nd Avenue South corridor has been the commercial center of the city since the [[Columbia Mall (Grand Forks)|Columbia Mall]] opened in 1978. Many [[big box]] stores, as well as hotels and restaurants, are now located along the avenue.<ref name="shopping">{{cite web |url=http://www.visitgrandforks.com/main.php/destinations |title=Shopping Destinations in Grand Forks, ND and East Grand Forks, MN |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work=Greater Grand Forks Convention & Visitors Bureau |}}</ref> A large strip mall, called the Grand Forks Marketplace, opened in 2001 near the Columbia Mall.

==Economy==
The economy of Grand Forks is not dominated by any one industry or sector. While agriculture continues to play a role in the area's economy, the city of Grand Forks now has a relatively diverse economy that includes public and private employers in sectors such as education, defense, health care, manufacturing, and food processing.<ref name="community"/><ref name="employers"/> The state and federal governments operate two of the largest employers in the Grand Forks area. The [[University of North Dakota]], located in the heart of the city, is the largest employer in the metropolitan area.<ref name="employers"/> [[Grand Forks Air Force Base]], just west of the city, employs a large number of civilian workers in addition to its enlisted personnel. [[Altru Health System]] is the largest private employer in Grand Forks.<ref name="employers"/>

The retail and service sector is also an important part of the economy. The historic center of shopping in Grand Forks was the [[Downtown Grand Forks|downtown]] area. Today, downtown is home to small shops and restaurants and south Grand Forks has become the major retail district in the city.<ref name="shopping"/> Grand Forks has three large shopping centers. The oldest, [[Grand Cities Mall]], is located on South Washington Street and contains mainly small, locally owned stores as well as a [[Kmart Corporation|Kmart]]. With about 80 stores, the area's largest indoor mall is [[Columbia Mall (Grand Forks)|Columbia Mall]] which is anchored by [[Macy's]], [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], [[J.C. Penney]], and a large food court. The newest major shopping center in the city is the Grand Forks Marketplace [[power centre|power center mall]] which features [[Target Corporation|SuperTarget]], [[Best Buy]], [[Lowe's]], [[Gordmans]], and several smaller stores. Depending on the relative strength of the [[Canadian dollar]] versus the [[American dollar]], the Greater Grand Forks area attracts large numbers of tourist shoppers from [[Manitoba]] and especially from [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]].<ref name="dollar">{{cite news|last=Noronha  |first=Charmaine|title=Currency goes loonie|work=Associated Press|date=[[2007-06-05]]|url=http://www.grandforksherald.com/articles/?id=39723|accessdate=}}</ref>

===Economic development===
The city government is actively involved in the economic development process, helping existing firms grow and attracting new ones. A portion of sales tax revenues is set aside for this, some of it going into the Grand Forks Growth Fund.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grandforks.org/businessresources/localstateprograms.php |title=Business Resources – Local and State Programs |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work=The Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation }}</ref> Companies can request low-interest loans or grants from this fund provided they meet certain criteria, such as paying a relatively high wage and doing most of their business outside the city's trade region. The city also contributes to the Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation (EDC), a public-private organization that also receives funding from banks and other major businesses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grandforks.org/gfredc/faq.php |title=About us |accessdate=2007-06-11 |format= |publisher=Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation }}</ref> The EDC plays a consulting role for businesses, such as identifying suitable sites for expansion or assembling public funding packages. Its other key role is to vet businesses to see if they are suitable for funding by the Growth Fund.

Community leaders have long seen UND as an "economic engine" for the city. Besides its regular faculty, it also has business-like components such as the [[Energy and Environmental Research Center]]. UND hosts a technology incubator called the Center for Innovation. More recently, the University has been working to commercialize its research. A major thrust in that direction is the construction of a research park on the western fringes of the campus.<ref name="und"/> Another potential economic opportunity for the city is the addition of the [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) mission to [[Grand Forks Air Force Base]]. The base currently hosts [[KC-135 Stratotanker]]s, which will gradually be transferred to other bases around the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/grand-forks.htm |title=Grand Forks AFB |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work=GlobalSecurity.org }}</ref>

Grand Forks uses the [[mayor-council government|mayor-council]] model of [[municipal government]]. The mayor, who is elected every four years, has the power to oversee the daily administration of city government and to work directly with department heads to ensure the proper provision of services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grandforksgov.com/gfgov/home.nsf/Pages/Mayor's+Office |title=Mayor Brown |accessdate=2007-06-05 |format= |work=City of Grand Forks, North Dakota }}</ref> The mayor of Grand Forks is [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] [[Michael Brown (mayor)|Dr. Michael Brown]]. He was first elected in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004. 

The city is divided into seven wards with each ward electing a single city council representative for a four year term. The council meets twice each month as the council proper and twice each month as a [[committee of the whole]]. All council meetings are broadcast on a local cable channel.<ref name="citycouncil"/>
