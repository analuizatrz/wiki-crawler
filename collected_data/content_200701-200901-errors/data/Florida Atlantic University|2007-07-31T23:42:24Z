==History==
{{refimprovesect|date=July 2007}}
{{main article|History of Florida Atlantic University}}
On [[July 15]], [[1961]], the [[Florida Legislature]] passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in southeastern Florida.  A [[1940s]]-era [[Boca Raton Airport|Army airbase]] in Boca Raton was selected as the site of the new university.  In [[1962]], the [[Florida Board of Control]] selected "Florida Atlantic University" as the name of the new institution, and ground was broken on [[December 8]], [[1962]].  FAU opened on [[September 14]], [[1964]], with an initial student body of 867; it was the only university in the nation to offer only upper-division and graduate work.  [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] dedicated the university on [[October 25]] of the same year and received the first honorary doctorate awarded by Florida Atlantic.
[[Image:FAU Alumni Plaza.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Alumni Plaza on the Boca Raton Campus]]

FAU's history is one of continuing expansion as the university population has grown. The university expanded to [[Broward County, Florida]], in 1971, with the founding of the Commercial Boulevard campus in [[Fort Lauderdale]], and by the fall semester of [[1983]], enrollment would reach 9,388.  In [[1984]], due to a rapidly growing population in the state, Florida Atlantic opened its doors to [[freshmen]] and [[sophomores]], and in 1985, the downtown Fort Lauderdale campus opened on Las Olas Boulevard.

In [[1989]], the [[Florida Legislature]] designated Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County, and fall semester enrollment reached 13,148. In [[1995]], Florida Atlantic purchased [[Barry University|Barry University’s]] [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] facility to establish a campus on the [[Treasure Coast]], in partnership with [[Indian River Community College]].

[[Image:FAU Baldwin House.jpg|right|thumb|200px|President's residence at Baldwin House on the Boca Raton Campus]]
In 1999, the [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]] campus also opened and was formally named for the late [[John D. MacArthur]]; by [[2003]], fall semester enrollment was 24,961. Also in 2003, the state of Florida awarded FAU [[USD|$]]10 million to establish the nation's only Center of Excellence in Biomedical and Marine Biotechnology, a research facility that searches the waters off Florida's coastline for drugs from natural sources that could be used to treat [[cancer]], [[heart disease]], and other serious illnesses.

Today, FAU's [[USD|$]]168 million endowment is the fourth largest in the state,<ref name="Endowment">{{cite web | url = http://www.palmbeachpost.com/pbcsouth/content/local_news/epaper/2006/10/17/s1b_fauendow_1017.html?cxtype=rss&cxsvc=7&cxcat=17 | title = "Giving to FAU Fourth in State" | publisher = Palm Beach Post | accessdate = 2006-10-17}}</ref> and FAU has maintained the most diverse student body in the state university system, with [[minority]] enrollment of 34.6%. The Boca Raton campus remains the largest campus, with 69% of FAU's students enrolled there.[http://www.fau.edu/academic/iea/inst/facts.htm] The Boca Raton campus and the Jupiter campus are the only campuses that offer student housing.

Since its founding, Florida Atlantic University has had [[List of Presidents of Florida Atlantic University|five presidents]]. President Frank T. Brogan became the fifth president in 2003 after resigning his position as the [[Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Florida]] under then [[Governor]] [[Jeb Bush]].

Florida Atlantic's main campus in [[Boca Raton]] was established on the remnants of a [[World War II]] American [[United States Army Air Corps|Army airbase]] in 1964. Spanning 850 [[acres]] (3.5&nbsp;[[square kilometer|km²]]) near the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the site is located between the cities of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] and Fort Lauderdale. The campus was designated a [[burrowing owl]] sanctuary in [[1971]], by the [[Audubon Society]].<ref name="FAU Trad">{{cite web | title =FAU Traditions | publisher =Florida Atlantic University: Athletics Department | url =http://fausports.cstv.com/trads/fau-trads.html | accessdate =2007-07-15}}</ref> The owl prefers the campus because there are few predators due to the university's proximity to the [[Boca Raton Airport]], and the fact that the campus was originally cleared of vegetation when operating during World War II. The feisty bird, traditionally associated with wisdom and determination, serves as the university's [[mascot]]. 

The Boca Raton Campus is home to a wide variety of university programs and facilities. These include "state-of-the-art labs and classrooms, suite-style housing for students plus athletic and recreational facilities."<ref name="Boca Raton campus"/> In addition to academic and cultural programs, the campus also houses Florida Atlantic's [[Division One]] intercollegiate [[Florida Atlantic Owls|athletics program]].

Located in [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]], [[Florida]] the Treasure Coast Campus of Florida Atlantic University operates under a unique partnership with [[Indian River Community College]] (IRCC). Since the 1970s FAU has been operating on the [[Treasure Coast]] in conjunction with IRCC "to extend educational opportunities that take students from an [[associate's degree]] to [[undergraduate]] and [[graduate school|graduate]] degrees."<ref name="PSL campus">{{cite web | title =About FAU on the Treasure Coast | publisher =Florida Atlantic University | url =http://www.fau.edu/psl/overview.php | accessdate =2007-07-09}}</ref>

Florida Atlantic University purchased 50 acres (.2&nbsp;[[square kilometer|km²]]) of land in Port. St. Lucie in 1994. The university operated in the existing infrastructure for eight years before joining with Indian River Community College in order to open a joint-use facility.

Florida Atlantic's 18 varsity sports teams, known as the [[Florida Atlantic University Owls|Owls]], compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Division I]] [[Sun Belt Conference]]. The university's athletics program began in 1979, when FAU first started sponsoring intercollegiate teams.<ref name="Athletics HF">{{cite press release | title =FAU Inducts Seven into Inaugural Athletic Hall of Fame | publisher = Florida Atlantic University: FAU Athletics | date =2006-10-27 | url =http://fausports.cstv.com/genrel/100906aaa.html | accessdate =2007-07-12}}</ref> Since then the university has worked to expand the quality of its intercollegiate program by attracting renowned coaches such as [[Howard Schnellenberger]], [[Matt Doherty]], and [[Rex Walters]]. Due to this effort, in [[2006]] the athletic department was ranked 79th in the nation by the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] (NACDA).  "In conjunction with ''[[USA Today]]'' and the United States Sports Academy, NACDA recognized FAU for its Division I athletic programs and accomplishments."<ref name="79th Ranking">{{cite press release | title =University MRI Continues Commitment with FAU Football | publisher =Florida Atlantic University: University Communications and Marketing | date =2006-08-02 | url =http://www.fau.edu/communications/mediarelations/Releases0806/080602.php | accessdate =2007-07-12}}</ref> This ranking placed Florida Atlantic in the top 24% of 326 [[NCAA]] Division I universities.<ref name "79th Ranking"/> The [[Florida Atlantic Owls|FAU Owl]] athletic teams have also garnered a number of accolades for their accomplishments. During the [[2007]] season the men's basketball team was noted as "one of the [[Sun Belt Conference]]'s top offensive teams", with a "scary offense" that earned it the reputation of the "best shooting team in the conference."

===Traditions===
[[Image:Bb2 fau fiu celebration.JPG|left|thumb|200px|FAU celebrates a basketball victory]]
Since the inception of the athletics program, a number of sports-related traditions and school spirit organizations have been started at the university. One new tradition is "Bury the Burrow in Red,"  which calls for Florida Atlantic students to wear as much [[red]] as possible and fill the [[FAU Arena|Burrow]], the university's multi-purpose arena, during the annual [[college basketball|basketball]] face-off between FAU and nearby neighbor [[Florida International University]] (FIU).<ref name:"BuBu Red">{{cite web | title =Minutes for February 15, 2007 | publisher =Florida Atlantic University: Student Government Association | url =http://sga.fau.edu/download_pdf.php?form=15_february_200_1178049306.pdf | accessdate =2007-07-15}}</ref> The official spirit group supporting Florida Atlantic athletics are the "prOWLers". The group began in February [[2002]] when Pablo Paez, Will Pearson, and Michael W. Moore gathered a group of students to rally around the men's basketball program during the team’s run for the [[Atlantic Sun Conference|Atlantic Sun Conference Championship]]. Since that time the group has grown and been reorganized and reinvigorated by Rick Smith in order to ensure that it remains as one of the lead spirit organizations at FAU. The group is funded by the Student Alumni Association, and today "...can be found at most sporting events for FAU, teaching students and fans the university’s fight songs and cheers, while carrying on tradition from year’s past."<ref name: "prOWLers">{{cite web | title =prOWLers - The rowdiest students at FAU | publisher =Florida Atlantic University: Athletics Department | url =http://fausports.cstv.com/trads/prowlers.html | accessdate =2007-07-15}}</ref> In addition, the university has two other spirit organizations which support specific university sports; the "Rowdy Rexes" support the basketball programs and the "Crazy Coonies" support the baseball program.<ref name="FAU Trad"/>

Another traditional competition between FAU and FIU is the annual [[Shula Bowl]]. This annual intercollegiate football game is named after legendary coach [[Don Shula]]; the game originates from the fact that both head coaches, FAU's [[Howard Schnellenberger]] and former FIU coach [[Don Strock]], worked under Shula at some point during their careers.  This game provides bragging rights to one of the [[South Florida]] teams until the next game is played the following season. As a home game the competition takes place at [[Dolphins Stadium]], as an away game, the bowl is played at [[FIU Stadium]] in Miami.<ref name="FAU Trad"/>

===Residential life===
[[Image:Apts 2.PNG|left|thumb|200px|Village Apartments, Boca campus]]
Residential housing at Florida Atlantic University is available on the Boca Raton and John D. MacArthur campuses. "All full-time freshman students are required to live in university housing," however, "exceptions are made for a number of reasons including residing with a parent or legal guardian within a 50-mile commutable distance from the campus, a student being 21 years of age, or if a student is married."<ref name="Housing FAQ">{{cite web | title = Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = Florida Atlantic University: Department of Housing and Residential Life   | url =http://www.fau.edu/housing/FAQ.html | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}</ref>

Within its existing residential life programs Florida Atlantic offers a number of Learning Communities for freshman and students with similar interests and concentrations. These communities "are a residential experience that bring together what happens inside and outside the classroom." Participants meet "students with similar interests, live on the same floor and take courses with others in their community, while receiving additional programming and support related to those interests."<ref name="LLC">{{cite web | title =Becoming a Part of the Community: Living Learning Communities | publisher =Florida Atlantic University: Department of Housing and Residential Life | url =http://www.fau.edu/retention/2007-08LLCBrochure.pdf | accessdate =2007-07-09}}</ref> The university's Learning Community programs are divided into two categories, Freshman Learning Communities and Living Learning Communities.

===Campus organizations and activities===
For the [[2006]]-[[2007]] academic year, Florida Atlantic had approximately 150 registered student organizations. This includes 40 academic organizations, 19 honor societies, 18 spiritual/religious organizations, 16 diversity appreciation organizations, 5 service organizations, 25 personal interest organizations, 12 club-sports, and 7 student government agencies. These clubs and organizations run the gamut from [[sailing]] to [[Ultimate Frisbee]], from varsity and club sports and a [[jazz]] group to a [[pottery]] [[guild]], from political organizations to chess and video game clubs.<ref name="Club/Org List">{{cite web | title =2006-2007 Registered Club List | publisher =Florida Atlantic University: Student Development & Activities | url =http://wise.fau.edu/sda/clubs/clubs_index.pdf | accessdate =2007-07-14}}</ref> These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which [[USD|$]]10.00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund. This generates approximately [[USD|$]]5.8 million which is then given to [[student government#United States|Student Government]] for allocation to student clubs and organizations. The student government also finances other student life programs including career fairs, the ''[[University Press]]'', Owl [[TV]] and Owl Radio, and Homecoming.<ref name="SGA $">{{cite web | title =A&S Fee Funded | publisher =Florida Atlantic University: University Wide Council | url =http://sga.fau.edu/uwc/funding.php | accessdate =2007-07-14}}</ref>
