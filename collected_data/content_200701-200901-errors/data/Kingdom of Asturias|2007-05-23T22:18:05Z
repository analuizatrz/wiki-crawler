The '''Kingdom of Asturias''' was the first [[Christianity|Christian]] political entity to be established in the [[Iberian peninsula]] after the collapse of the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Kingdom. This followed the defeat of [[Monarch|King]] [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]] and the subsequent [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Islamic conquest of Hispania]].

==Indigenous background of the Kingdom of Asturias==

The birthplace of the Asturian kingdom were the western and central territories of the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], particularly the [[Picos de Europa]] and the central area of Asturias. In these lands took place the main polical and military happenings during the first decades of existence of the kingdom. According to the descriptions of [[Strabo]], [[Dio Cassius]] and other graeco-roman geographers, the lands of Asturias where inhabited in the beginnings of the Christian era by several peoples, among which the most important were: the ''Vadinienses'', who inhabited the Picos de Europa region and whose settlement area gradually expanded southward during the first centuries of our era; the ''Orgenomesci'', who dwelled along the Asturian eastern coast; the ''Saelini'', whose settlement area extended through the [[Sella]] valley; the ''Luggones'', who had their capital in ''Lucus Asturum'' and whose territories stretched between the rivers Sella and Nalón; the ''Astures'' (in strict sense), who dwelled in inner Asturias, between the current councils of [[Piloña]] and [[Cangas del Narcea]]; and the ''Paesici'', who had settled along the coast of Western Asturias, between the mouth of the Navia river and the present city of [[Gijón]].

[[Image:Somiedo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Picture of ''l.lagu del Val.le'' ([[Somiedo]]). They are shown the typical Asturian cottages, which were already in use in the time of the [[Astures]]]]Classic geographers give us confuse informations about the ethnical adscription of the above mentioned peoples: [[Ptolemy]] says that the Astures extended along the central area of current Asturias, between the Navia and Sella rivers, fixing the latter the boundary with the Cantabrian territory. However, another geographers placed the frontier between the Astures and the Cantabrians much eastwards: Julius Honorius stated in his ''Cosmographia'' that the springs of Ebro river were located in the land of the Astures (''sub asturibus''). In any case, ethnical borders in the Cantabrian mountains were not so important at that time, as all the peoples of Northern Spain had similar culture and habits.

This situation started to change during the Late [[Roman Empire]] and the High [[Middle Ages]], when an Asturian identity started to develop gradually: The centuries-old fight against Romans, [[Visigoths]] and [[Vandals]], contributed to forge a common identity among the peoples of the Cantabrian mountains. In this sense, several archaeological diggings in the ''castro'' of La Carisa (municipality of Lena) have found remnants of a defensive line whose main goal was to protect the valleys of central Asturias from the invaders who came from the Meseta through the Pajares pass: Scholars think that the construction of this fortifications reveals a high grade of organization and cooperation between the several Asturian tribes, in order to defence themselves from the southern invaders. [[Carbon-14]] tests have found that the wall dates from the period 675-725 AD, when two armed expeditions against the Asturians took place: One of them, leaded by Visigothic king [[Wamba]]; the other by Muslim governor [[Musa bin Nusair]], during the [[Islamic conquest of Iberia]].

The Asturian identity that was gradually forming led to the creation of the Kingdom of Asturias after [[Pelayo of Asturias|Pelayo]]'s coronation and the victory over the berbers in [[Battle of Covadonga|Covadonga]]. In this sense, the Chronica Albeldense, in narrating the happenings of Covadonga, stated: ''"Regnum Asturorum divina providencia exoritur"''.

==Establishment==
[[Image:Don Pelayo.jpg|thumb|left|200ppx|Monument in memory of Pelayo in [[Covadonga]]]]The kingdom was established by a  nobleman, [[Pelayo]] who had returned to his country after the [[Battle of Guadalete]], where he became elected leader of the [[Astures]] and founded the Kingdom of Asturias. However, Pelayo's kingdom initially was little more than a banner for the existing guerilla forces. 

Under his leadership, the attacks on the [[Berber people|Berbers]] increased. In [[722]] (or possibly in [[724]] or as early as [[718]]), the [[Emir]] sent a force led by [[Munuza]] to quell this rebellion and establish [[Moors|Moorish]] control of the region. This force was defeated in the valley of [[Battle of Covadonga]]. The most commonly accepted hypothesis for this battle (epic as described by [[Christian]] chronicles, but a mere skirmish in [[Muslim]] texts) is that the Moorish column was attacked from the cliffs and then fell back through the valleys towards present day [[Gijón]], but was attacked whilst in retreat by the retinue and nearly destroyed. After this first battle, the Astures grew stronger. Once he had expelled the Moors from the eastern valleys of Asturias, Pelayo attacked [[León, Spain|León]], the main city in the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula and secured the mountain passes, isolating the region from Moorish attack.

Pelayo continued attacking those Berbers which remained north of the Asturian Mountains until they withdrew. He then married his son [[Favila of Asturias|Favila]] to Duke [[Peter of Cantabria]]’s daughter, a descendant of the former Astur dynasty. 

Pelayo founded a dynasty in Asturias that survived for centuries and gradually expanded the kingdom's boundaries until all of northwest Iberia was included by roughly [[775]]. The reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]] from [[791]]-[[842]] saw further expansion of the kingdom to the south, almost as far as [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].

==Recognition==
It was not until King [[Alfonso II of Asturias]] (791-842), that the kingdom was firmly established with Alfonso's recognition as king of Asturias by [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Pope]]. He conquered [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basques]]. During his reign, the holy bones of [[James the Great|St. James the Great]] were declared to be found in Galicia, at [[Santiago de Compostela]] (from Latin campus stellae, literally "the field of the star"). Pilgrims from all over [[Europe]] opened a way of communication between the isolated Asturias and the [[Carolingian]] lands and beyond.

The first capital city was [[Cangas de Onís]]. Then, in [[Silo of Asturias|Silo's]] time, it was moved to [[Pravia]]. Alfonso II chose [[Oviedo]] as the definite capital of the Kingdom. The kingdom was known as Asturias until [[924]], when it became the [[Kingdom of León]]. It continued under that name until incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]] in [[1230]], after [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III]] became joint king of the two kingdoms.

==Spirituality and religion in the Kingdom of Asturias==

===Remnants of Megalithic and Celtic Paganism===

Although the earliest evidences of Christian cult in Asturias date from the 5th century, evangelisation did not really make any substantial progress until the middle of the 6th century, when hermits like Santo Toribio de Liébana and monks of the San Fructuoso order settled gradually in lands of the Cantabrian mountains and started to preach the Christian doctrine to the locals.

According another scholars, ''deva'' is just a common Celtic word which means ''"goddess"'', so it is possible that behind this name another divinities, like Briga and Navia, are hidden. In any case, Deva was highly popular title in Prerroman Asturias, and still today can be found in placenames like the Isle of Deva and the Güeyu of Deva well.

[[Image:Eibe.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The yew tree links the present Asturians with their land, their ancestors, and the Ancient Religion.]]
In the middle of the Sella valley (where [[Cangas de Onís]] is located) there was a dolmen area, which dated back to the [[megalith|megalithic era]], and was built probably in the 4,000 - 2,000BC period. In this place, particularly in Santa Cruz Dolmen, the ritual burials of the surrounding regions chieftains were performed. Such practices survived the Roman and Visigothic conquests to a point that still in the 8th century king [[Favila]] was buried there, in the same place were the corpses of ancient tribal liders had their final rest. Although the Asturian monarchy fostered the christianization of this site (ordering the edification of a church), there are still today Pagan traditions linked with the Santa Cruz dolmen: It is said that ''[[xanas]]'' (Asturian fairies) appear the visitors, and magical properties are ascribed to the earth of the place.

===Christian spirituality: Milleniarism and Jacobean cult===





[[Image:B Facundus 224vdét.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean things of her fornication, and upon her forehead a name written: «Mystery, '''Babylon the Great''', the mother of the harlots and of the abominations of earth.»"'' (Revelation, 17.4-5)]]

===Among the mists of myth...===

==Legacy==
The Kingdom of Asturias was, in its infancy, an indigenous reaction of [[Astur|Astures]] and [[Cantabri]] peoples to a foreign invasion. These people had fought the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the [[Astur-Cantabrian wars|Astur-Cantabrian Wars]], and initially resisted [[Romanisation]]. Although they preserved many characteristics of their pre-Roman culture, their [[Celtic languages]] were later lost in favor of [[Latin]]. Thus, they conserved part of their pre-Roman features, such as [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] [[inheritance]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, and a certain amount of [[social equality]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. However, these long standing egalitarian traits were eroded by the arrival of the [[Visigoths]] who introduced [[feudalism]].

This kingdom is the birthplace of an influential European [[Medieval architecture|medieval architectural style]]: Asturian [[Preromanesque]]. This style of architecture was founded during the reign of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]].

This small kingdom was a milestone in the fight against [[Adoptionist]] [[heresy]], with [[Beatus of Liébana]] as a major figure. In the time of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]], the shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela|Santiago]] was "found." The pilgrimage to Santiago, [[Camino de Santiago]], was a major nexus within Europe, and many pilgrims (and their money) passed through Asturias on their way to Santiago de Compostela.
