'''Windows XP''' is a line of [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[operating system]]s developed by [[Microsoft]] for use on [[Personal computer|general-purpose]] [[computer system]]s, including home and business desktops, [[laptop|notebook computer]]s, and [[media center]]s. The letters "XP" stand for ''e'''XP'''erience''.<ref name="xppr">{{cite web

Windows XP was first released on [[October 25]] [[2001]], and over 400 million copies are in use, according to a January 2006 estimate by an [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] analyst.<ref name="idc">{{cite web

}}</ref> It is succeeded by [[Windows Vista]], which was released to volume license customers on [[November 8]], [[2006]], and worldwide to the general public on [[January 30]], [[2007]].

The most common editions of the operating system are Windows XP Home Edition, which is targeted at home users, and Windows XP Professional, which has additional features such as support for [[Windows Server domain]]s and [[Symmetric multiprocessing|dual processor]]s, and is targeted at power users and business clients. [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]] has additional multimedia features enhancing the ability to record and watch TV shows, view DVD movies, and listen to music. [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]] is designed to run the ink-aware [[Tablet PC]] platform.  Two separate [[64-bit]] versions of Windows XP were also released, [[Windows XP 64-bit Edition]] for [[IA-64]] ([[Itanium]]) processors and [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] for [[x86-64]] processors.

Windows XP is known for its improved stability and efficiency over previous versions of [[Microsoft Windows]]. It presents a significantly redesigned [[graphical user interface]], a change Microsoft promoted as more user-friendly than previous versions of Windows. New software management capabilities were introduced to avoid the "[[DLL hell]]" that plagued older consumer versions of Windows. It is also the first version of Windows to use [[product activation]] to combat [[Copyright infringement of software|software piracy]], a restriction that did not sit well with some users and privacy advocates.  Windows XP has also been criticized by some users for security vulnerabilities, tight integration of applications such as [[Internet Explorer]] and Windows Media Player, and for aspects of its user interface.

Windows XP had been in development since early 1999, when Microsoft started working on [[Windows Neptune]], an operating system intended to be the "Home Edition" equivalent to Windows 2000 Professional. It was eventually cancelled and became Whistler, which later became Windows XP.  Many ideas from Neptune and Odyssey (another cancelled Windows version) were used in Windows XP.

On [[April 19]], [[2007]], [[Dell]] again began offering Windows XP as an option on four laptop and two desktop models, due to high customer demand.  The company had switched to exclusively offering Vista systems in January.<ref name="dellxp">{{cite web| url = http://news.com.com/Dell+brings+back+XP+on+home+systems/2100-1046_3-6177619.html | title=Dell brings back XP on home systems | year = [[April 19]] [[2007]] | author = Ina Fried |publisher = CNet News}}</ref>
==Editions==
[[Image:XP-Editions.svg|thumb|350px|Diagram representing the main editions of Windows  XP. It is based on the category of the edition (grey) and codebase (black arrow).]]Two major editions are Windows XP Home Edition, designed for home users, and Windows XP Professional, designed for business and power-users. Other builds of Windows XP include those built for specialized hardware and limited-feature versions sold in Europe and select developing economies.

Windows XP Professional offers a number of features unavailable in the Home Edition, including:
*Able to become part of a [[Windows Server domain]] &mdash; a group of computers that are remotely managed by one or more central servers (many businesses that use Windows have a Windows Server and a domain)
*Sophisticated [[access control list|access control]] scheme that allows specific permissions on files to be granted to specific users under normal circumstances. However, users can use tools other than Windows Explorer (like cacls or File Manager), or restart to [[Safe Mode]] to modify access control lists.
*[[Terminal Services|Remote Desktop]] server, which allows a PC be operated by another Windows XP user over a [[local area network]] or the Internet
*Offline Files and Folders, which allow the PC to automatically store a copy of files from another networked computer and work with them while disconnected from the network
*[[Encrypting File System]], which encrypts files stored on the computer's hard drive so they cannot be read by another user, even with physical access to the storage medium
*Centralized administration features, including Group Policies, Automatic Software Installation and Maintenance, Roaming User Profiles, and Remote Installation Service (RIS)
*Internet Information Services (IIS), which is Microsoft's HTTP and FTP Server.
*Support for two physical [[central processing unit]]s (CPU).  The [[Multi-core (computing)|number of CPU cores]] and [[Hyper-threading]] capabilities on modern CPUs are considered to be part of a single physical processor, therefore multicore CPUs will work fine under XP Home Edition.<ref name="XP-Cores>{{cite news

===Windows XP for specialized hardware===
[[Image:MCE 2005.png|thumbnail|270px|The main menu from Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005.]]

Microsoft has also customized Windows XP to suit different markets and there are now several different versions available. Five different versions of XP for specific hardware were designed, two of them specifically for [[64-bit]] processors.

; [[Windows XP 64-bit Edition]] : This edition was designed specifically for [[Itanium]]-based workstations. This edition was discontinued in early 2005, after [[Hewlett Packard|HP]], the last distributor of Itanium-based workstations, stopped selling Itanium systems marketed as 'workstations'. However, Itanium support continues in the server editions of Windows. 

; [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] : Not to be confused with the previous 64-bit Itanium edition of Windows XP, this edition is based on [[Windows Server 2003]] and supports [[x86-64]] extension of the Intel IA-32 architecture. x86-64 is implemented by AMD as "AMD64", found in AMD's [[Opteron]] and [[Athlon 64]] chips, and implemented by Intel as "Intel64" (formerly known as IA-32e and EM64T), found in Intel's [[Pentium 4]] and later chips.

: Microsoft had previously supported other microprocessors with earlier versions of the [[Windows NT]] operating system line (including two 64-bit lines, the [[DEC Alpha]] and the [[MIPS]] R4000, although Windows NT used them as 32-bit processors). The files necessary for all of the architectures were included on the same installation CD and did not require the purchase of separate versions.

; [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]] : This edition is designed for [[media center]] PCs. Originally, it was only available bundled with one of these computers, and could not be purchased separately. In 2003 the Media Center Edition was updated as "Windows XP Media Center Edition 2003", which added additional features such as FM radio tuning. Another update was released in 2004, and again in 2005, which was the first edition available for [[System Builder]]s.

[[Image:TabletPC 2004.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Internet Explorer 6 running on a Tablet PC.]]
; [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]] : Intended for specially designed notebook/laptop computers called [[tablet PC]]s, the Tablet PC Edition is compatible with a pen-sensitive screen, supporting handwritten notes and portrait-oriented screens. It cannot be purchased separately from a Tablet PC.

; [[Windows XP Embedded]] : An edition for specific consumer electronics, [[set-top box]]es, kiosks/[[Automatic teller machine|ATMs]], medical devices, arcade video games, point-of-sale terminals, and Voice Over Internet Protocol ([[Voice over IP|VoIP]]) components.

; [[Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs]] : In July 2006, Microsoft introduced a "thin-client" version of Windows XP called '''Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs''', which targets older machines (as early as the original Pentium). It will only be available to [[Microsoft Software Assurance|Software Assurance]] customers, who would like to upgrade to Windows XP to take advantage of its security and management capabilities, but can't afford to purchase new hardware. Applications will typically be run on a remote server using [[Terminal Services|Remote Desktop]].

===Windows XP Starter Edition===
Windows XP Starter Edition is a lower-cost version of Windows XP available in Thailand, Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia, Russia, India, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador, Uruguay and Venezuela. It is similar to Windows XP Home, but is limited to low-end hardware, can only run 3 programs at a time, and has some other features either removed or disabled by default.

According to a Microsoft press release, Windows XP Starter Edition is "a low-cost introduction to the Microsoft Windows XP operating system designed for first-time desktop PC users in [[developing country|developing countries]]." It is seen as an effort to fight unauthorized copying of Windows XP and possibly the spread of [[Linux|GNU/Linux]]-based systems in [[Asia]] and [[South America]].

====Specializations====
The Starter Edition includes some special features for certain markets where consumers may not be [[Computer literacy|computer literate]].  Not found in the Home Edition, these include [[Software localization|localized]] help features for those who may not speak English, a country-specific computer wallpaper<ref name="XPStartermaterial>{{

In addition, the Starter Edition also has some unique limitations to prevent it from displacing more expensive versions of Windows XP.<ref name="XPStarterfacts>{{

The maximum screen resolution is limited to 1024×768, and there is no support for workgroup networking or domains.  In addition, the Starter Edition is licensed only for low-end processors like Intel's [[Celeron]] or AMD's [[Duron]]. There is also a 512MB limit on main memory, and an 120GB disk size limit<ref name="XPStarterlimits>{{

On [[October 9]] [[2006]], Microsoft announced<ref name="MSfinancialanalystmeet>{{cite press release

}}</ref> that they reached a milestone of 1,000,000 units of Windows XP Starter Edition sold. In the mass market, however, the Starter Edition has not had much success. Many markets where it is available have seen the uptake of illegally cracked or pirated versions of the software instead.

===Windows XP Edition N===
In March 2004, the [[European Commission]] fined [[Microsoft]] €497 million ($603 million USD) and ordered the company to provide a version of Windows without [[Windows Media Player]]. The Commission concluded that [[Microsoft]] "broke [[European Union]] competition law by leveraging its near [[monopoly]] in the market for PC operating systems onto the markets for work group [[Server (computing)|server]] [[operating system]]s and for media players". [[Microsoft]] is currently appealing the ruling. In the meantime, a court-compliant version has been released. This version does not include the company's [[Windows Media Player]] but instead encourages users to pick and download their own media player. Microsoft wanted to call this version ''Reduced Media Edition'', but EU regulators objected and suggested the ''Edition N'' name, with the ''N'' signifying "not with Media Player" for both Home and Professional editions of Windows XP. Due to the fact that it is sold at the same price as the version with Windows Media Player included, [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Lenovo]] and [[Fujitsu Siemens]] have chosen not to stock the product. However, Dell did offer the operating system for a short time. Consumer interest has been low, with roughly 1,500 units shipped to [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]]s, and no reported sales to consumers.<ref name="WinXPlite">{{

==New and updated features==
{{main|Features new to Windows XP}}

Windows XP introduced several new features to the Windows line, including:
*Faster start-up and [[Hibernate (OS feature)|hibernation]] sequences;
*The ability to discard a newer device driver in favor of the previous one (known as ''driver rollback''), should a driver upgrade not produce desirable results;
*A new, arguably more user-friendly interface, including the framework for developing themes for the desktop environment;
*''[[Fast user switching]]'', which allows a user to save the current state and open applications of their desktop and allow another user to log on without losing that information;
*The ''[[ClearType]]'' font rendering mechanism, which is designed to improve text readability on [[Liquid Crystal Display]] (LCD) and similar monitors;
*The ''[[Terminal Services|Remote Desktop]]'' functionality, which allows users to connect to a computer running Windows XP from across a network or the [[Internet]] and access their applications, files, printers, and devices.
*Support for most [[Digital Subscriber Line|DSL]] modems and [[IEEE 802.11|wireless network]] connections, as well as networking over [[FireWire]].

==User interface==

Windows XP features a new task-based [[graphical user interface]]. The Start menu and [[Windows indexing service|search capability]] were redesigned and many visual effects were added, including:
*A translucent blue selection rectangle in Explorer
*A [[watermark]]-like graphic on folder icons, indicating the type of information stored in the folder.
*Drop shadows for icon labels on the desktop
*Task-based sidebars in Explorer windows ("common tasks")
*The ability to group the taskbar buttons of the windows of one application into one button
*The ability to lock the taskbar and other toolbars to prevent accidental changes
*The highlighting of recently added programs on the Start menu
*Shadows under menus (Windows 2000 had shadows under mouse pointers, but not menus)

Windows XP analyzes the performance impact of visual effects and uses this to determine whether to enable them, so as to prevent the new functionality from consuming excessive additional processing overhead. Users can further customize these settings.<ref name="WinXPVisualFX">{{

}}</ref>Windows XP adds the ability for Windows to use "Visual Styles" to change the user interface. However, visual styles must be cryptographically signed by Microsoft to run. ''Luna'' is the name of the new visual style that ships with Windows XP, and is enabled by default for machines with more than 64&nbsp;MB of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]. ''Luna'' refers only to one particular visual style, not to all of the new user interface features of Windows XP as a whole. In order to use unsigned visual styles, many users turn to [[software]] such as TGTSoft's StyleXP or [[Stardock]]'s WindowBlinds. Some users "patch" the <tt>uxtheme.dll</tt> file that restrict the ability to use visual styles, created by the general public or the user, on Windows XP.

[[Image:Royale.PNG|left|thumbnail|250px|The '[[Energy Blue|Royale]]' theme on Windows XP Media Center Edition]]
The default wallpaper, [[Bliss (image)|Bliss]], is a [[Windows bitmap|BMP]] photograph of a landscape in the [[Napa Valley]] outside [[Napa, California]], with rolling green hills and a blue sky with [[stratocumulus]] and [[cirrus cloud]]s.

The Windows 2000 "classic" interface can be used instead if preferred. Several third party utilities exist that provide hundreds of different visual styles. In addition, another Microsoft-created theme, called "[[Energy Blue|Royale]]", was included with Windows XP Media Center Edition, [http://weblogs.asp.net/dotnetrolando/archive/2005/05/10/406381.aspx and was also released for other versions of Windows XP], but has [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=15373c73-d5f6-4af0-b583-d633cb021612&DisplayLang=en since been removed] from the original Microsoft [[New Zealand]] package. The Luna theme uses 4 more megabytes of RAM than the "Classic" Windows theme, so Classic can possibly improve performance on lower-end systems. A matching black theme by [[Zune]] can also be downloaded for free from the [http://www.zune.net/en-us/meetzune/software.htm Zune website] (''see [[Energy Blue#Royale Noir .2F Zune theme|Energy Blue]]'').

Over 100 of the new [[icon (computing)|icons]] were created by [[The Iconfactory]], best known for their [[freeware]] [[Mac OS|Mac]] icons.<ref name="iconfactory">{{cite web|last=Iconfactory |first=The |authorlink=The Iconfactory |coauthors= | date= |url=http://design.iconfactory.com/pages/winicon/winicon.html |title=Iconfactory Design: Windows Icon Design |format= |work= |pages= |publisher= | language= |accessdate=2006-05-22 |accessyear= }} <small>(Click on the [http://design.iconfactory.com/pages/winicon/windowxp.html Windows XP] link on the left hand list for a [[pop-up]] with more details.)</small></ref>

Windows XP also has a [[command line interface]] (CLI), <tt>[[cmd.exe]]</tt>, for [[Execution (computers)|executing]] single commands or for running scripts called ''[[Batch file]]s''.  The syntax for the language of the Windows XP CLI is not as well-documented by Microsoft in the built-in ''Help'' as many GUI features.  A simple list of the basic commands is available at the command prompt by typing "<tt>help</tt>"; and somewhat more complete command syntax may be found by typing "<tt>command_name /?</tt>" for any command.

==Service packs and support==
Microsoft occasionally releases [[service pack]]s for its Windows operating systems to fix problems and add features.

===Service Pack 1===
[[Image:Windows XP - Program Access and Defaults.png|thumbnail|180px|left|Program Access and Defaults Menu was added in Service Pack 1.]] Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows XP was released on [[September 9]], [[2002]]. Its most notable new features were [[Universal Serial Bus|USB 2.0]] support and a ''Set Program Access and Defaults'' utility. For the first time, users could control the default application for activities such as web browsing and instant messaging, as well as hide access to some of Microsoft's bundled programs. This utility was also brought into the older [[Windows 2000]] operating system with its Service Pack 3. Service Pack 1a was later released to remove Microsoft's [[Java virtual machine]] as a result of a lawsuit with [[Sun Microsystems]].

[[Logical block addressing|LBA]]-48, which allowed the OS to view and use HDD space above 137&nbsp;GB, was enabled by default. Native support for [[Serial ATA]] was added.

Support for Windows XP Service Pack 1 and 1a ended on [[October 10]], [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/support/endofsupport.mspx|accessdate=2006-06-27|title=End of support for Windows 98, Windows Me, and Windows XP Service Pack 1|date=[[January 6]], [[2006]]}}</ref>
{{Clr}}

===Service Pack 2===
[[Image:XPsp2 SecurityCentre FirewallAlert.png|thumbnail|175px|[[Windows Security Center]] was added in Service Pack 2.]]
Service Pack 2 (SP2) (codenamed "Springboard") was released on [[August 6]], [[2004]] after several delays, with a special emphasis on security. Unlike previous service packs, SP2 adds new functionality to Windows XP, including an enhanced firewall, improved [[Wi-Fi]] support with a wizard utility, a [[pop-up ad]] blocker for [[Internet Explorer]], and [[Bluetooth]] support. Security enhancements include a major revision to the included firewall which was renamed to [[Windows Firewall]] and is enabled by default, advanced memory protection that takes advantage of the [[NX bit]] that is incorporated into newer processors to stop some forms of buffer overflow attacks, and removal of [[raw socket]] support (which supposedly limits the damage done by "zombie" machines: infected computers that can be used remotely to launch denial of service attacks).  Additionally, security-related improvements were made to e-mail and web browsing. Windows XP Service Pack 2 includes the [[Windows Security Center]], which provides a general overview of security on the system, including the state of [[anti-virus software]], Windows Update, and the new Windows Firewall. Third-party anti-virus and firewall applications can interface with the new Security Center.

There were also some visual changes made with Service Pack 2. On the boot screen (where it says Microsoft Windows XP with the three scrolling squares), the "(C)1985-2001" designation at the bottom was removed, and the edition name was removed (e.g. "Home Edition" or "Professional"). In the Home Edition version the scrolling squares, originally green, were replaced with blue ones. In addition, the Wireless Network Connection Icon, which used to show two computer symbols (like the LAN Connection Icon) now shows just one, with a radio wave symbol on the right side.

While well received in general, Service Pack 2 was not without its critics. Thomas Greene from ''[[The Register]]'' claimed that SP2 was merely a placebo of sorts in terms of features, fixes, and security updates:

<blockquote>
"While we found that there are indeed a few minor improvements worthy of acknowledgment, in particular, some rather low-level improvements that don't show to the admin or user, overall, SP2 did little to improve our system's practical security, leaving too many services and networking components enabled, bungling permissions, leaving IE and OE vulnerable to malicious scripts, and installing a packet filter that lacks a capacity for egress filtering."<ref name="SP2SR">{{cite news | url = http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/02/winxpsp2_security_review/ | publisher = The Register | title = WinXP SP2 - security placebo? | date = [[September 2]] [[2004]] }}</ref>
</blockquote>

Service Pack 2 also introduced a severe compatibility problem with any [[Pentium 4#Prescott|Prescott core]] based [[Intel]] processor, rendering the PC unable to boot. Both Microsoft and Intel later released fixes for the problem.

===Service Pack 3===

The site titled [http://www.thehotfix.net The Hotfix] has been reported as keeping an up-to-date list of downloadable hotfixes that will be included in Service Pack 3. Many of the hotfixes on the site have not yet been officially released by Microsoft and users have been warned not to install them all, but many of the fixes have been known to solve specific problems that SP3 will eventually address.

===Support lifecycle===
Support for Windows XP Service Pack 2 will end four years after its general availability. Windows XP will be generally available for a period of 12 months after the [[January 30]] [[2007]] launch of [[Windows Vista]], except for [[system builder]]s, for whom licenses will be available for 24 months.<ref>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/lifecycle/default.mspx</ref>
On [[April 14]] [[2009]] Windows XP will begin its "Extended Support" period that will last for 5 years until [[2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=3223|title=Microsoft Windows XP Lifecycle Policy|accessdate=2007-03-25|publisher=Microsoft}}</ref> Windows XP without Service Pack 2 is no longer supported and [[Microsoft]] has already withdrawn the support for Windows XP RTM on [[September 30]] [[2004]] and Windows XP Service Pack 1 and 1a on [[October 10]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifesupsps#Windows|title = Lifecycle Supported Service Packs|accessdate=2007-02-01}}</ref>

==Common criticisms==
{{main|Criticism of Windows XP}}

===Security issues===
Windows XP has been criticized for its susceptibility to [[malware]], [[computer virus|viruses]], [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]] and [[Computer worm|worms]]. Security issues are compounded by the fact that users of the Home edition, by default, receive an administrator account that provides unrestricted access to the underpinnings of the system. If the administrator's account is broken into, there is no limit to the control that can be asserted over the compromised PC.

Windows, with its large market share, has historically been a tempting target for virus creators. Security holes are often invisible until they are exploited, making preemptive action difficult. Microsoft has stated that the release of patches to fix security holes is often what causes the spread of exploits against those very same holes, as [[security cracking|crackers]] figured out what problems the patches fixed, and then launch attacks against unpatched systems.

In an effort to slow down the rate at which malicious programs can spread to uninfected computers, Service Pack 2 lowered the limit on outgoing TCP/IP connection attempts from 65,535 to 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/sp2netwk.mspx#E5AAE|accessdate=2006-06-27|title=TCP/IP|author=Starr Andersen|date=[[August 9]], [[2004]]}}</ref> There can be no more than this many incomplete outgoing connections being attempted at any one time; additional connection attempts will be queued. This limit can adversely affect legitimate software such as [[peer-to-peer]] applications. The "tcpip.sys" system file can be patched to raise the limit to its former value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phex.org/mambo/content/view/49/33/|accessdate=2006-06-27|title=The Windows XP SP2 connection limit|date=[[24 May]] [[2005]]}}</ref>

===User interface and performance===
Critics have claimed that the default Windows XP user interface (Luna) adds visual clutter and wastes screen space while offering no new functionality and running more slowly – with some even calling it 'the [[Fisher-Price]] interface'. Users who do not like the new interface can easily switch back to the Windows Classic theme.<ref name="fpi">{{

}}</ref>

===Integration of operating system features===
In light of the [[United States v. Microsoft]] case which resulted in Microsoft being convicted for abusing its operating system monopoly to overwhelm competition in other markets, Windows XP has drawn fire for integrating user applications such as [[Windows Media Player]] and [[Windows Messenger]] into the operating system, as well as for its close ties to the [[Windows Live ID]] service.

===Backward Compatibility===
Some users switching from [[Windows 9x]] to XP dislike its lack of [[DOS]] support.  Although XP comes with the ability to run programs in a backward compatibility mode, as well as a ''command'' program which is more like a 9x "Dos Box" than CMD, XP still has trouble running many old DOS programs.  This is largely due to the fact that it is NT-based and does not use DOS as a base OS.  There are work arounds such as the open source [[DOSBox]] and [[FreeDOS]].

===Product activation===
While [[product activation]] and licensing servers are common for business and industrial software (especially software sold on a per-user basis for large sums of money), Windows XP gave many casual computer users their first introduction to it. The system was introduced by Microsoft to curb unauthorized distribution of Windows XP.<ref name="activation">{{

cite news
|url = http://www.microsoft.com/piracy/basics/activation/
|publisher = Microsoft
|title = Microsoft Product Activation
|date = Unknown

}}</ref> Activation requires the computer or the user to activate with Microsoft within a certain amount of time in order to continue using the operating system. If the user's computer system ever changes &mdash; for example, if two or more relevant components of the computer itself are upgraded &mdash; Windows may refuse to run until the user reactivates with Microsoft.

===Copying restrictions===
Microsoft Windows XP service packs are designed so that they will not install on computers running installations of Windows XP that use product keys known to be widely used in unauthorized installations. These product keys are unique to each boxed (or bundled) copy of Windows XP and are included with the product documentation, but a small number of product keys have been posted on the Internet and are used for a large number of unauthorized installations. The service packs contain a list of these keys and will not update copies of Windows XP that use them.

Microsoft developed a new key verification engine for Windows XP Service Pack 2 that could detect illicit keys, even those that had never been used before. After an outcry from [[Computer security|security]] consultants who feared that denying security updates to illegal installations of Windows XP would have wide-ranging consequences even for legal owners, Microsoft elected to disable the new key verification engine. Service Pack 2 only checks for the same small list of commonly used keys as Service Pack 1. This means that while Service Pack 2 will not install on copies of Windows XP which use the older set of copied keys, those who use keys which have been posted more recently may be able to update their systems.

"Crack" programs exist to randomly generate Windows XP product keys (thus, there are no longer any commonly used keys to block) and then activate windows without contacting Microsoft. These may or may not allow the user to receive security updates. These are currently put to illegal and arguably unethical "software piracy" uses but may become legitimately useful in the future for running what will then be "old windows XP software" if Microsoft ever stops supporting/activating legitimate copies of Windows XP.

===Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications===

[[Image:WGA Notification.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] notification indicating a failed validation.]]
[[Windows Genuine Advantage]] Notifications is a utility that checks the legitimacy of a Windows XP license. If the license key is judged not genuine, it displays a [[nag screen]] at regular intervals asking the user to buy a license from Microsoft.<ref name="KB905474">{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=905474 |title=Description of the Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications application|accessdate=2006-10-31 }}</ref> In addition, the user's access to Microsoft Update is restricted to critical security updates, and as such, new versions of [[DirectX]], [[Windows Defender]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[Windows Media Player 11]] and other Microsoft products will refuse to install.

The download is itself marked as a "Critical Security Update", causing Automatic Updates to download it without user intervention. However, unlike most critical updates, the Notifications component does not install automatically; you must accept the supplemental [[EULA]] provided before it can install.<ref name="NotificatonsFAQ">{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/downloads/faq.aspx#ques105 |title=Genuine Microsoft Software: Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2006-10-31 }}</ref>

Once installed, WGA Notifications "[[Phoning home|phones home]]" to Microsoft every time the computer is connected to the Internet. In 2006, Microsoft has changed the latest version of WGA Notifications to indicate what exactly the program does during its install.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/wga/archive/2006/11/29/new-wga-notifications-released.aspx|title=New WGA Notifications Released|work=[[MSDN Blogs]]|date=2006-09-29|accessdate=2006-12-03}}</ref>

While in the testing phase, Microsoft did not include an uninstallation utility, but rather gave the user manual removal instructions that do not work with the final build.<ref name="KB905474" />

Strictly speaking, neither the download nor the install of the Notifications is mandatory; the user can change their Automatic Update settings to allow them to choose what updates may be downloaded for installation. If the update is already downloaded, the user can choose not to accept the supplemental EULA provided for the Notifications. In both cases, the user can also request that the update is not presented again. However this setting will only have effect on the existing version of Notifications, so it can appear again as a new version.

As of 2006, Microsoft is currently involved in a [[class action lawsuit]] brought forth in California, on grounds that it violated the spyware laws in the state with its Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1983687,00.asp|title=Lawsuit Labels Windows Genuine Advantage as Spyware|work=[[eWeek]]|date=2006-07-29|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref>
