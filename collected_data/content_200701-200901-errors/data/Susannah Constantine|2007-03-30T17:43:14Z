'''Susannah Constantine''' (born [[1962]] in [[London]]) is an award-winning [[England|English]] [[television presenter]], personality, fashion guru and [[author]]. She was best-known as the co-host, along with [[Trinny Woodall]], on the [[BBC]] style series ''[[What Not to Wear]]''. Following her success on the show, she went on to co-host ''[[Trinny & Susannah Undress]]''. She has also co-written many fashion advice books.

==Background==
Constantine's father was successful in the property and shipping sectors and was an [[Eton College|ex-Eton]] pupil and [[Coldstream Guards]]. She grew up in an old priory in the [[Leicestershire]] village of Knipton and went hunting from the age of seven.<ref name="Interview"> ''[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/femail/article.html?in_article_id=229872&in_page_id=1879 Acne, alcohol … and non-stop sex]'' &mdash; dailymail.co.uk</ref> She was educated at [[St Mary's School, Wantage|St Mary's School]] in [[Wantage]], [[Oxfordshire]], and Queens Gate School in [[South Kensington]], [[London]]. Constantine is best known as a fashion guru, where her fashion career started when she worked for many years for fashion designers such as Alistair Blair and [[John Galliano]]. Constantine has also worked for [[Harrods]].<ref name="Swells"> ''[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,864290,00.html Just a couple of swells]'' &mdash; observer.guardian.co.uk</ref> She teamed up in [[1994]] with [[Trinny Woodall]] after they had met at a party hosted by [[David, Viscount Linley]].<ref name="Swells"/> They proceeded to write ''Ready to Wear'', a weekly style guide for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' which ran successfully for seven years.<ref name="Swells" /> Constantine and Woodall were also co-founders of [[Ready2shop.com]], a [[dot-com]] fashion advice business that ceased trading after running out of funding in November [[2000]].

Constantine made her television debut when [[Granada Sky Broadcasting]] signed up her and Woodall to present a daytime shopping show named after their column in the ''Daily Telegraph'' called ''Ready to Wear''. Soon after the start of their television career, they secured a frequent makeover slot on the show ''[[Richard & Judy]]''. It ensured that they had further exposure in television and gained attention from [[Jane Root]], controller of BBC Two, who took a risk and signed them up after their book ''Ready to Dress'' and their internet business, Ready2shop.com had been unsuccessful.<ref name="Swells" />

==Television career==
[[Image:TrinnyandSusannahWNTW.jpg|200px|right|Constantine (right) on book cover]]
Constantine was well-known and made famous for co-hosting ''[[What Not to Wear]]'' with Trinny Woodall, which required using her fashion expertise and some brutally honest remarks in order to reform people's appearance and style. She co-hosted the show from [[2001]] to [[2005]] where she was often noted for her tactile behaviour with the candidates.

During her time co-hosting ''What Not to Wear'' for five series, she and Woodall gained recognition for their work on the show, where they won a [[Royal Television Society#Awards|Royal Television Society Award]] in 2002, for being the best factual presenters.<ref>''[http://www.rts.org.uk/awards_det.asp?id=1457&sec_id=336 Royal Television Society]'' &mdash; rts.org.uk</ref> In 2002, Constantine and Woodall provided [[Jeremy Clarkson]] with a makeover on a celebrity ''What Not to Wear'',<ref>''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/02_february/01/tvmoments_2002.shtml BBC One honours the best TV moments from 2002]'' &mdash; BBC Press Office</ref> and later did a spin-off show called ''What Not to Wear on the Red Carpet'' in which they transformed the appearances of [[Jo Brand]] and [[Sophie Raworth]]. ''What Not to Wear'' also gained her fame in America, when the show was aired on [[BBC America]] and was well received.

Constantine voiced a robot version of herself in the popular [[science fiction]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. In the episode ''[[Bad Wolf]]'' in [[2005]], Trine-e and Zu-Zana were two robots acting out a deadly futuristic version of ''What not to Wear''. In the same year, Constantine appeared on the live BBC coverage of [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles|The Royal Wedding of Charles and Camilla]], where she contributed as a fashion and contemporary social commentator along with Woodall.<ref>''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/03_march/30/wedding.shtml The Royal Wedding: Charles and Camilla]'' &mdash; BBC Press Office</ref> 

Constantine defected from the BBC to [[ITV]] along with Woodall, where they started their new show, ''[[Trinny & Susannah Undress]]'' on [[3 October]], 2006. Since then, ''What Not to Wear'' on [[BBC One]] has been hosted by [[Lisa Butcher]] and [[Mica Paris]]. Constantine has also appeared regularly as a makeover expert on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' (with Woodall), where she gave fashion advice and guidelines on how to better your overall appearance. The show saw them giving numerous American citizens makeovers and a thoroughly improved appearance.<ref>''[http://www.oprah.com/tows/pastshows/200405/tows_past_20040518.jhtml ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'', What Not to Wear this summer]'' &mdash; oprah.com</ref> 

She has also appeared a couple of times on ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'', ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', [[Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car]]; a recurring segment on the [[BBC Two]] motoring programme ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'', amongst numerous other talk shows. In [[2003]], when Constantine and Woodall appeared on ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'',  actress [[Meg Ryan]] had a controversial interview with [[Michael Parkinson]], which resulted in negative publicity for several reasons. Parkinson said that he felt Ryan's behaviour to his fellow guests; Woodall and Constantine, whom she turned her back on, was "unforgivable".<ref>''[http://business.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=598&id=521652006 Parky was a 'nut', says Meg Ryan]'' &mdash; scotsman.com</ref>

==Other work==
Susannah Constantine and Woodall became the faces of [[Nescafé]] in 2003, when they were featured in advertisements promoting the brand of coffee and later became the faces of ''[[Littlewoods Shop Direct Group|Littlewoods]]''. During ''Littlewoods''' sponsorship of their new ITV programme ''Trinny & Susannah Undress'', orders rose thirty per cent. During that time in 2006, the pair produced a twelve page fashion advice section within the ''Littlewoods'' catalogue and made a booklet called ''The Golden Rules'', which was distributed to all ''Littlewoods'' customers with fashion advice to suit a range of body shapes.<ref>''[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/consumer_goods/article1288827.ece Littlewoods signs up Trinny and Susannah]'' &mdash; timesonline.co.uk</ref> 

Together, they have also written several style books as spin-offs from their series ''What Not to Wear'', some of which  include ''What Not to Wear'' and ''What You Wear Can Change Your Life''. Their fashion books have been number one bestsellers in Britain and the United States and have been translated throughout the world.<ref>''[http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=6606 Trinny and Susannah Undress]'' &mdash; itv.com</ref> Other success with their books included winning a [[British Book Awards|British Book Award]] in 2003 for "The TV & Film Book of the Year" for their book ''What Not to Wear''.<ref>''[http://www.britishbookawards.co.uk/bba/pnbb_previouswinners.asp British Book Awards]'' &mdash; britishbookawards.co.uk</ref> The book also sold 670,000 copies, consequently outselling [[Jamie Oliver]] and [[Nigella Lawson]].<ref>''[http://parkinson.tangozebra.com/guest.phtml?guest_id=93 Parkinson]'' &mdash; parkinson.com</ref> It was also noted that Constantine and Woodall secured a £1 million book deal to write more of their fashion books.<ref>''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/student/article805020.ece The makeover millionaires]'' &mdash; timesonline.co.uk</ref>

For charity, Constantine has appeared with Woodall on ''[[Comic Relief]]: Red Nose Night Live 05'' and on [[Children in Need]] in 2004, which saw a special segment, with her giving the fictional ''[[EastEnders]]'' characters [[Little Mo]] and [[Mo Harris]] a makeover à la ''What Not to Wear'', commenting on them in her usual style.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/11_november/09/cin.shtml Children In Need 2004], BBC Press Office</ref>

In the same year that Woodall and Constantine moved to ITV, they launched their own underwear range; "Trinny and Susannah Magic Pants" which were made of [[Nylon]], produced to flatten the [[tummy]], [[buttocks]] and [[thighs]], so that the areas appear slimmer and compact.<ref>''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/10_october/24/parky_251003.shtml Meg Ryan talks to Parkinson]'' &mdash; BBC news</ref> She currently writes a weekly column for ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' with Woodall.
