The '''Nintendo Entertainment System''' (often referred to as the '''NES''' or simply '''Nintendo'''), is an [[8-bit]] [[video game console]] released by [[Nintendo]] in [[North America]], [[Brazil]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]] in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]]. In most of [[Asia]], including [[Japan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Taiwan]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Singapore]],  it was released as the {{nihongo|'''Family Computer'''|ファミリーコンピュータ|Famirī Konpyūta}} or simply, the {{nihongo|'''Famicom'''|ファミコン|Famikon}} ''{{Audio|Famicom.ogg|listen}}''. In [[South Korea]], the hardware was licensed to [[Hyundai Electronics]], which marketed it as the '''Comboy''' (컴보이).<ref name="korea">{{cite web | title=Breaking the Ice: South Korea Lifts Ban on Japanese Culture | url=http://web-japan.org/trends98/honbun/ntj981207.html | format=html | accessdate=May 19 | accessyear=2007 | date=December 7 | year=1998 | work=[http://web-japan.org/trends/ Trends in Japan]}}</ref>

The most successful gaming console of its time in Asia and North America (Nintendo claims to have sold over 60 million NES units worldwide<ref>{{cite web | title=Classic Systems&mdash;Nintendo Entertainment System | work=Nintendo | url=http://www.nintendo.com/systemsclassic?type=nes | format=html | accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>), it helped revitalize the US video game industry following the [[video game crash of 1983]]. It set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from [[game design]] (the breakthrough [[platform game]], ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', was the system’s first major success) to controller layout. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted [[third-party developer]]s.

== History ==
{{main|History of the Nintendo Entertainment System}}
[[Image:NES Donkey Kong.png|thumb|left|200px|Nintendo’s successes in [[video arcade]]s encouraged the company to enter the home console market with the Famicom. A [[Porting|port]] of Nintendo’s arcade hit ''Donkey Kong'' was a [[Launch title#Nintendo Entertainment System.2FFamicom|launch title]] for the system.]]
Following a series of [[arcade game]] successes in the early [[1980s]], Nintendo made plans to produce a cartridge-based console. [[Masayuki Uemura]] designed the system, which was released in [[Japan]] on [[July 15]], [[1983 in video gaming|1983]] for [[Yen|¥]]14,800 alongside three [[Porting|ports]] of Nintendo’s successful [[arcade game]]s ''[[Donkey Kong]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', and ''[[Popeye (video game)|Popeye]]''. The '''Nintendo Family Computer''' ('''Famicom''') was slow to gather momentum; during its first year, many criticized the system as unreliable, prone to [[software bug|programming errors]] and rampant [[hang|freezing]]. Following a [[product recall]] and a reissue with a new [[motherboard]], the Famicom’s popularity soared, becoming the best-selling game console in Japan by the end of [[1984]]. 

Encouraged by its successes, Nintendo soon turned its attention to the North American market. Nintendo entered into negotiations with [[Atari]] to release the Famicom under Atari’s name as the name Nintendo Enhanced Video System; however, this deal eventually fell through.<ref>Atari broke off negotiations with Nintendo in response to [[Coleco|Coleco’s]] unveiling of a unlicensed port of ''Donkey Kong'' for its [[Coleco Adam]] computer system. Although the game had been produced without Nintendo’s permission or support, Atari took its release as a sign that Nintendo was dealing with one of its major competitors in the market.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The History of the Nintendo Entertainment System or Famicom | work=Nintendo Land | url=http://www.nintendoland.com/home2.htm?nes/history.htm | format=html | accessdate=February 12 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Subsequent plans to market a Famicom console in North America featuring a keyboard, cassette data recorder, wireless joystick controller, and a special [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] cartridge under the name "Nintendo Advanced Video System" likewise never materialized.

Finally, in June 1985, Nintendo unveiled its American version of the Famicom at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES). Nintendo rolled out its first systems to limited American markets on [[October 18]], [[1985]], following up with a full-fledged North American release of the console in February of the following year.<ref>{{cite book | first = Van | last = Burnham | year = 2001 | title = Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age, 1971–1984 | pages = p. 375 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | id = ISBN 0-262-52420-1 }}</ref> Nintendo simultaneously released eighteen [[launch title]]s: ''[[10-Yard Fight]]'', ''[[Baseball (Nintendo game)|Baseball]]'', ''[[Clu Clu Land]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong Jr. Math]]'', ''[[Duck Hunt]]'', ''[[Excitebike]]'', ''[[Golf (video game)|Golf]]'', ''[[Gyromite]]'', ''[[Hogan's Alley (arcade game)|Hogan’s Alley]]'', ''[[Ice Climber]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (video game)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Mach Rider]]'', ''[[Pinball (video game)|Pinball]]'', ''[[Stack-Up]]'', ''[[Tennis (video game)|Tennis]]'', ''[[Wild Gunman]]'', ''[[Wrecking Crew (video game)|Wrecking Crew]]'', and of course, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''.

In Europe and Australia, the system was released to two separate marketing regions (A and B). Distribution in region B, consisting of most of mainland Europe (excluding Italy), was handled by a number of different companies, with Nintendo responsible for most cartridge releases; most of region B saw a 1986 release. Mattel handled distribution for region A, consisting of the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Australia and New Zealand, starting the following year. Not until 1990 did Nintendo’s newly created European branch take over distribution throughout Europe.<ref name="Europe">{{cite web | title=European information | format=html | work=[http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/ Nintendo Database] | url=http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/nes/nes_eu.shtml | accessdate=May 4 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Despite the system’s lackluster performance outside of Japan and North America, by 1990 the NES had become the best-selling console ever up to that time.<ref>{{cite web | author=Nielsen, Martin | year=1997 | title=The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) FAQ v3.0A | format=html | work=ClassicGaming.com’s Museum | url=http://www.classicgaming.com/museum/faqs/nesfaq.shtml | accessdate=January 5 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

[[Image:DSCN2594.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Shortly before ceasing production of the system in North America, Nintendo released a radically redesigned console (known as the [[AV Family Computer]] in Japan and the [[NES 2]] in North America) that corrected a number of problems with the original hardware.]]
As the 1990s dawned, however, renewed competition from technologically superior systems such as the [[16-bit]] [[Sega Mega Drive]] (known as the Sega Genesis in North America) marked the end of the NES’s dominance. Eclipsed by Nintendo’s own [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES), the NES’s user base gradually waned. Nintendo continued to support the system in America through the first half of the decade, even releasing a new version of the console, the [[NES 2]], to address many of the design flaws in the original NES hardware.<ref name="topload">{{cite web | author=The Collector | title=The Toploader NES: Why did it fail? | url=http://www.nesplayer.com/Editorials/toploaderfailure.htm | work=[http://www.nesplayer.com/ The NES Player] | format=html | accessdate=August 23 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> The final games released for the system were as follows: in Japan, [[Adventure Island 4]] in [[1994]], and, in America, among unlicensed titles, [[Sunday Funday]] was the last, whereas [[Wario's Woods]] was the last licensed game (also the only one with an ESRB rating).<ref name="warioswoods">{{cite web | title="Did you know..."

Despite this, Nintendo of Japan kept producing new Nintendo Famicoms for a niche market up until October 2003, when Nintendo of Japan officially discontinued the line. Even as developers ceased production for the NES, a number of high-profile video game franchises and series for the NES were transitioned to newer consoles and remain popular to this day. Nintendo’s own ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and ''[[Metroid]]'' franchises debuted on the NES, as did [[Capcom]]’s ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, [[Konami]]’s ''[[Castlevania]]'' franchise, and [[Square Enix]]’s ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' franchises.

In the years following the official "death" of the NES in the West, a collector’s market based around [[Rental shop|video rental shops]], [[garage sale]]s and [[flea market]]s led some gamers to rediscover the NES. Coupled with the growth of [[console emulation]], the late 1990s saw something of a second golden age for the NES. The secondhand market began to dry up after 2000, and finding ROMs (digital copies of games for use on emulators) no longer represented the challenge it had in the past. Parallel to the rise of interest in emulation was the emergence of a dedicated NES hardware [[modding|"modding" scene]]. Such hobbyists perform tasks such as moving the NES to a completely new case, or just dissecting it for parts or fun. The controllers are particular targets for modding, often being adapted to connect with [[personal computer]]s by way of a [[parallel port|parallel]] or [[USB]] port. Some NES modders have transformed the console into a [[portable]] system by adding [[AA batteries]] and an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] or [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen.<ref name="portable">{{cite web | author=TigheKLory | title=NESp | url=http://nestable.classicgaming.gamespy.com/ || format=html | accessdate=December 20 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

== Bundle packages ==
[[Image:NES Super Mario Bros.png|thumb|left|200px|''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' was one of the titles packaged alongside the NES deck for the North American launch of the console.]]
For its North American release, the NES was released in two different configurations, or "bundles". The console deck itself was identical, but each bundle was packaged with different Game Paks and accessories. The first of these sets, the Control Deck, retailed from [[USD|US$]]199.99, and included the console itself, two game controllers, and a ''Super Mario Bros.'' game cartridge. The second bundle, the Deluxe Set, retailed for [[USD|US$]]249.99, and consisted of the console, a [[R.O.B.]], a [[NES Zapper]] (electronic gun), and two game paks: ''[[Duck Hunt]]'' and ''[[Gyromite]]''.

For the remainder of the NES’s commercial lifespan in North America, Nintendo frequently repackaged the console in new configurations to capitalize on newer accessories or popular game titles. Subsequent bundle packages included the NES Action Set, released in November 1988 for [[USD|US$]]199.99, which replaced both of the earlier two sets, and included the console, the NES Zapper, two game controllers, and a [[multicart]] version of ''Super Mario Bros.'' and ''Duck Hunt''. The Action Set became the most successful of the packages released by Nintendo. One month later, in December 1988, to coincide with the release of the [[Power Pad]] floor mat controller, Nintendo released a new Power Set bundle, consisting of the console, the [[Power Pad]], the NES Zapper, two controllers, and a multicart containing ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Duck Hunt]]'', and ''[[World Class Track Meet]]''.<ref name="liedholm1">{{cite web | author=Liedholm, Marcus and Mattias | title=History of the Nintendo Entertainment System or Famicom | work=Nintendo Land | url=http://www.nintendoland.com/home2.htm?nes/history.htm | format=html | accessdate=February 12 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> In 1990, a Sports Set bundle was released, including the console, a [[NES Satellite]] infrared wireless [[multitap]] adaptor, four game controllers, and a multicart featuring ''[[Super Spike V'Ball]]''  and ''[[Nintendo World Cup]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Nintendo Entertainment System > United States Software List | work=[http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/ Nintendo Database] | url=http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/nes/nes_us.shtml | format=html | accessdate=August 23 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

A Total of 1,321 games have been released on the NES{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

Two more bundle packages were released using the original model NES console. The Challenge Set included the console, two controllers, and a ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' game pak. The Basic Set, first released in 1987, included only the console and two controllers with no pack-in cartridge. Instead, it contained a book called the ''[[The Official Nintendo Player's Guide]]'', which contained detailed information for every NES game made up to that point. Finally, the redesigned [[NES 2]] was released as part of the final Nintendo-released bundle package, once again under the name Control Deck, including the new style NES 2 console, and one redesigned "dogbone" game controller. Released in October 1993, this final bundle retailed for $49.99, and remained in production until the discontinuation of the NES in 1995.<ref name="topload" />

== Regional differences ==
[[Image:Famicom disk system.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Famicom Disk System]] was a peripheral available only for the Japanese Famicom that utilized games stored on "Disk Cards", reminiscent of 3.5" [[floppy disk]]ettes.]]
Although the Japanese Famicom and the international NES included essentially the same hardware, there were certain key differences between the two systems:
* ''Different case design''. The Famicom featured a top-loading cartridge slot, a 15-[[pin]] expansion port located on the unit’s front panel for accessories (as the controllers were hard-wired to the back of the console), and a red and white color scheme. The NES featured a front-loading cartridge slot (often jokingly compared to a [[toaster]]), and a more subdued gray, black and red color scheme. An expansion port was found on the bottom of the unit, and the cartridge connector pinout was changed.
* ''60-pin vs. 72-pin cartridges''. The original Famicom and the re-released [[AV Family Computer]] both utilized a 60-pin cartridge design, which resulted in smaller cartridges than the NES (and the [[NES 2]]), which utilized a 72-pin design. Four pins were used for the [[10NES]] lockout chip.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hernandez, Christopher | title=Nintendo NES / Famicom | format=html | work=Dark Watcher’s Console History | url=http://darkwatcher.psxfanatics.com/console/nes.htm | accessdate=January 5 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Ten pins were added that connected a cartridge directly to the expansion port on the bottom of the unit. Finally, two pins that allowed cartridges to provide their own sound expansion chips were removed, a regrettable decision. Many early games (such as ''[[Stack-Up]]'') released in North America were simply Famicom cartridges attached to an adapter (such as the [[T89 Cartridge Converter]]) to allow them to fit inside the NES hardware. Nintendo did this to reduce costs and inventory by using the same cartridge boards in America and Japan.
* A number of [[peripheral device]]s and [[Computer software|software]] packages were released for the Famicom. Few of these devices were ever released outside of Japan.
** <span id="fds">''[[Famicom Disk System]] (FDS)''</span>. Although not included with the original system, a popular floppy disk drive peripheral was released for the Famicom in Japan only. Nintendo never released the Famicom Disk System outside of Japan, citing concerns about software bootlegging. Notable games released for the FDS include ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic]]'', ''[[Metroid]]'', and the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]''.<ref>Many titles produced for the Famicom Disk System were subsequently [[porting|ported]] to cartridge format for international release. Such games include ''Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic'' (rebranded as ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'') and [[Konami]]’s ''[[Castlevania]]'' series. The original version of ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released for the FDS in Japan, and didn’t see an international release until ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (where it was retitled ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'').</ref>
** ''[[Famicom BASIC]]'' was an implementation of BASIC for the Famicom. It allowed the user to program his or her own games. Many programmers got their first experience on programming for the console this way.
** ''Famicom MODEM'' was a [[modem]] that allowed connection to a Nintendo server which provided content such as jokes, news (mainly about Nintendo), game tips, and weather reports for Japan; it also allowed a small number of programs to be downloaded.
* ''External [[sound chip]]s''. The Famicom had two cartridge pins that allowed cartridges to provide external sound enhancements. They were originally intended to facilitate the Famicom Disk System’s external sound chip. These pins were removed from the cartridge port of the NES, and relocated to the bottom expansion port. As a result, individual cartridges could not make use of this functionality, and many NES [[Software localization|localizations]] suffered from inferior sound compared to their equivalent Famicom versions. ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse|Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse]]'' is a notable example of this problem.
[[Image:Famicom controllers.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Unlike the NES, the Famicom's controllers were hardwired to the system itself. The 2nd controler eliminated the Start and Select buttons, replacing it with a microphone and a volume control slider.]]
* <span id="hardwired">''Hardwired controllers''</span>. The Famicom’s original design includes hardwired, non-removable controllers. In addition, the second controller featured an internal [[microphone]] for use with certain games and lacked SELECT and START buttons. Both the controllers and the microphone were subsequently dropped from the redesigned AV Famicom in favor of the two seven-pin controller ports on the front panel used in the NES from its inception.
* ''Lockout circuitry''. The Famicom contained no lockout hardware, and, as a result, unlicensed cartridges (both legitimate and bootleg) were extremely common throughout Japan and the Far East. The original NES (but not the top-loading NES 2) contained the [[10NES]] lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip’s mode of operation from "lock" to "key", removing all effects and greatly improving the console’s ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports.<ref>{{cite web | author=Horton, Kevin | title=The Infamous Lockout Chip | format=html | work=BlueTech | url=http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/lockout/ | accessdate=January 5 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> The European release of the console used a [[regional lockout]] system that prevented cartridges released in region A from being played on region B consoles, and vice versa.<ref name="Europe" /> 
* ''Audio/video output''. The original Famicom featured an [[RF modulator]] plug for audio/video output, while the original NES featured both an RF modulator and [[RCA connector|RCA]] [[composite video|composite]] output cables. The AV Famicom featured only RCA composite output, and the top-loading [[NES 2]] featured only RF modulator output. The original North American NES was the first game console to feature direct composite video output so people could hook it up to a stand-alone [[composite monitor]].
* ''Third-party cartridge manufacturing''. In Japan, six companies, namely Nintendo, [[Konami]], [[Capcom]], [[Namco]], [[Bandai]], and [[Jaleco]], manufactured the cartridges for the Famicom. This allowed these companies to develop their own customized chips designed for specific purposes, such as Konami's VRC 6 and VRC 7 sound chips that increased the quality of sound in their games.

== Game controllers ==
{{seealso|List of Nintendo Entertainment System accessories}}
[[Image:squarebuttonfamicom.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Before the 1984 product recall, Famicom controllers were manufactured with square-shaped A and B buttons.]] 
The [[game controller]] used for both the NES and the Famicom featured a brick-like design with a simple four button layout: two round buttons labelled "B" and "A", a "START" button, and a "SELECT" button. Additionally, the controllers utilized the cross-shaped [[D-pad]], designed by Nintendo employee [[Gunpei Yokoi]] for Nintendo [[Game & Watch]] systems, to replace the bulkier [[joystick]]s on earlier gaming consoles’ controllers.

The original model Famicom featured two game controllers, both of which were hardwired to the back of the console. The second controller lacked the START and SELECT buttons, but featured a small [[microphone]]. Relatively few games made use of this feature. The earliest produced Famicom units initially had square A and B buttons.<ref name="20years">{{cite web | author=Nutt, Christian; Turner, Benjamin | year=2003 | title=Metal Storm: All About the Hardware. | format=html | work=Nintendo Famicom--20 years of fun | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index5.shtml | accessdate=May 21 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> This was changed to the circular designs because of the square buttons being caught in the controller casing when pressed down, and glitches within the hardware causing the system to freeze occasionally while playing a game.

[[Image:NES controller.jpg|thumb|200px|right|In addition to featuring a revised color scheme that matched the more subdued tones of the console itself, NES controllers were [[Hot swapping|hot swappable]] and lacked the microphone featured in Famicom controllers.]]
The NES dropped the hardwired controllers, instead featuring two custom 7-pin ports on the front of the console. Also in contrast to the Famicom, the controllers included with the NES were identical to each other—the second controller lacked the microphone that was present on the Famicom model, and possessed the same START and SELECT buttons as the primary controller.

[[Image:Nes zapper.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Although several specialty controllers were marketed for the NES and the Famicom, few were commercially successful. Support for the Zapper, a [[light gun]] accessory, was limited to only a handful of game titles.]]
A number of special controllers designed for use with specific games were released for the system, though very few such devices proved particularly popular. Such devices included, but were not limited to, the [[NES Zapper]] (a [[light gun]]), the [[Power Pad]], and the ill-fated [[R.O.B.]] and [[Power Glove]]. The original Famicom featured a deepened [[DA-15]] expansion port on the front of the unit, which was used to connect most auxiliary devices. On the NES, these special controllers were generally connected to one of the two control ports on the front of the unit.

Near the end of the NES's lifespan, upon the release of the AV Famicom and the top-loading NES 2, the design of the game controllers was modified slightly. Though the original button layout was retained, the redesigned device abandoned the "brick" shell in favor of a "dog bone" shape reminiscent of the controllers of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. In addition, the AV Famicom joined its international counterpart and dropped the hardwired controllers in favor of detachable controller ports. However, the controllers included with the Famicom AV, despite being the "dog bone" type, had cables which were a short three feet long, as opposed to the standard six feet of NES controllers.

In recent years the original NES controller has become one of the most recognizable symbols of the system. Nintendo has mimicked the look of the controller in several recent products, from promotional merchandise to limited edition versions of the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] and [[Game Boy Micro]] [[handheld game console]]s.  Nintendo's most recent home console, the [[Wii]], has a wireless remote that resembles an original NES controller when held sideways, but longer and wireless.

== Hardware design flaws ==
[[Image:NES Cleaning Kit.JPG|200px|thumb|left|The official [[NES Cleaning Kit]] was intended to address flaws in the NES design that caused cartridge connectors to be particularly susceptible to interference from dirt and dust.]]
When Nintendo released the NES in the United States, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors, and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the [[video game crash of 1983]]. One result of this philosophy was a front-loading [[ZIF|zero insertion force]] (ZIF) cartridge socket designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a [[Video cassette recorder|VCR]]. The ZIF connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Repeated insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out relatively quickly, and the ZIF design proved far more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector.<ref name="zif">{{cite web | first=Benj | last=Edwards | title=No More Blinkies: Replacing the NES's 72-Pin Cartridge Connector | url=http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/13 | work=[http://www.vintagecomputing.com/ Vintage Computing and Gaming] | date=2005-11-07 | accessdate=2007-06-03 | format=HTML }}</ref> Exacerbating the problem was Nintendo’s choice of materials; the slot connector that the cartridge was actually inserted into was highly prone to corrosion.<ref name="corrosion">{{cite web | first=Rob | last=Nelson | title=Nintendo Redivivus: how to resuscitate an old friend | url=http://arstechnica.com/guides/tweaks/nintendo.ars/1 | format=HTML | work=[http://arstechnica.com/ Ars Technica] | date=2003-02-12 | accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref> Add-on peripherals like the popular [[Game Genie]] [[cheat cartridge]] tended to further exacerbate this problem by bending the front-loading mechanism during gameplay.<ref name="ggbent">{{cite web | first=Mark | last=Knibbs | title=NES Repairs | url=http://nintendope.iodized.net/thisoldnes/nes.txt | format=Text | date=1997-09-22 | work=[http://nintendope.iodized.net/ Nintendope] }}</ref> Recently, third-party manufacturers have been producing gold clones of the NES connector piece to replace the existing one and prevent corrosion.<ref name="gold">{{cite web | name=Snowcone | title=Repairing Your NES | url=http://www.snackbar-games.com/features/editorial/repairing_your_nes-40.html | format=HTML | date=2003-05-21 | accessdate=2007-06-04 | work=[http://www.snackbar-games.com/ Snackbar-Games.com] }}</ref>

[[Image:10nes.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The 10NES authentication chip contributed to the system's reliability issues. The circuit was ultimately removed from the remodelled NES 2.]]
Problems with the [[10NES]] lockout chip frequently resulted in the system’s most infamous problem: the blinking red power light, in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly. The lockout chip was quite finicky, requiring precise timing in order to permit the system to boot. Dirty, aging, and bent connectors would often disrupt the timing, resulting in the blink effect.<ref name="blinking">{{cite web | title=Blinking Screen | url=http://www.nesplayer.com/technical/blinkingscreen/blink.htm | work=[http://www.nesplayer.com/ NES Player] | accessdate=6 June | accessyear=2007 | format=html }}</ref> Alternatively, the console would turn on but only show a gray screen. Users attempted to solve this problem by blowing air onto the cartridge connectors, licking the edge connector, slapping the side of the system after inserting a cartridge, and/or cleaning the connectors with alcohol which, observing the back of the cartridge, was not endorsed by Nintendo. Many of the most frequent attempts to fix this problem ran the risk of damaging the cartridge and/or system. Blowing on the cartridge connectors was, in most cases, no better than removing and reinserting the cartridge, and tended to increase the rate of [[oxidation]] resulting in browning of the [[printed circuit board]], while slapping the side of the system after inserting the cartridge could potentially damage the console. In 1989, Nintendo released an official [[NES Cleaning Kit]] to help users clean malfunctioning cartridges and consoles.

With the release of the top-loading [[NES 2]] toward the end of the NES's lifespan, Nintendo resolved the problems by switching to a standard card edge connector, and eliminating the lockout chip. All of the Famicom systems used standard card edge connectors, as did Nintendo’s subsequent game consoles, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the [[Nintendo 64]].

In response to these hardware flaws, "Nintendo Authorized Repair Centers" sprang up across the United States. According to Nintendo, the authorization program was designed to ensure that the machines were properly repaired. Nintendo would ship the necessary replacement parts only to shops that had enrolled in the authorization program. In practice, the authorization process consisted of nothing more than paying a fee to Nintendo for the privilege. In a recent trend, sites like ''Nintendo Repair Shop Inc.'' have sprung up to offer Nintendo repair parts, guides and services, that replace those formerly offered by the authorized repair centers.<ref name="repairshop">{{cite web | title=What is The Nintendo Repair Shop Inc? | url=http://www.nintendorepairshop.com/shopcontent.asp?type=Aboutus | work=[http://www.nintendorepairshop.com/ Nintendo Repair Shop Inc.] | format=HTML | accessdate=2007-06-04 }}</ref>

== Third-party licensing ==
Nintendo’s near [[monopoly]] on the home video game market left it with a degree of influence over the industry exceeding even that of [[Atari]] during its heyday in the early 1980s. Unlike Atari, who never actively courted third-party developers, and went so far as to go to court to attempt to force [[Activision]] to cease production of [[Atari 2600]] games, Nintendo had anticipated and encouraged the involvement of third-party software developers—but strictly on Nintendo’s terms. To this end, a 10NES authentication chip was placed in every console, and another was placed in every officially licensed cartridge. If the console’s chip could not detect a counterpart chip inside the cartridge, the game would not load.

[[Image:Nintendo Seal of Quality.png|thumb|left|150px|The [[Nintendo Seal of Quality]] was placed on every officially licensed NES cartridge released in North America, with a similar design used in Europe.]]
Nintendo combined this with a marketing campaign introducing the [[Nintendo Seal of Quality]]. Commercials featured a purple-robed wizard instructing consumers that the Nintendo Seal of Quality was the only assurance that a game was any good—and, by implication, that any game without the Seal of Quality was bad. In reality, the seal meant that the developer had paid the license fee.

The business side of this was that game developers were now forced to pay a license fee to Nintendo, to submit to Nintendo’s [[quality assurance]] process, to buy [[software development kit|developer kits]] from Nintendo, and to utilize Nintendo as the manufacturer for all cartridges and packaging. Nintendo tested and manufactured all games at its own facilities (either for part of the fee or for an additional cost), reserved the right to dictate pricing, censored material it believed to be unacceptable, decided how many cartridges of each game it would manufacture, and placed limits on how many titles it would permit a publisher to produce over a given time span (five per year). This last restriction led several publishers to establish or utilize [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]] to circumvent Nintendo’s policies (examples including [[Konami]]’s subsidiary [[Ultra (company)|Ultra]], and [[Acclaim Entertainment]]’s subsidiary [[LJN]]).

These practices were intended not only to keep developers on a short leash, but also to manipulate the market itself: in 1988, Nintendo started orchestrating intentional game shortages in order to increase consumer demand. Referred as "inventory management" by Nintendo of America public relations executive Peter Main, Nintendo would refuse to fill all retailer orders. Retailers, many of whom derived a large percentage of their profit from sales of Nintendo-based hardware and software (at one point, [[Toys "R" Us]] reported 17% of its sales and 22% of its profits were from Nintendo merchandise), could do little to stop these practices. In 1988, over 33 million NES cartridges were sold in the United States, but estimates suggest that the realistic demand was closer to 45 million. Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges, it was able to enforce these rules on its third-party developers. These extremely restricted production runs would end up damaging several smaller software developers: even if demand for their games was high, they could only produce as much profit as Nintendo allowed.<ref>{{cite web | author=GaZZwa | title=History of Videogames (part 2) | format=html | work=Gaming World | url=http://www.gamingw.net/articles/74 | accessdate=January 7 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

=== Unlicensed games ===
[[Image:Bible adventures.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Unlicensed games, such as Wisdom Tree’s ''[[Bible Adventures]]'', were often released in cartridges which looked very different from typical NES game packs.]]

Several companies, refusing to pay the licensing fee or having been rejected by Nintendo, found ways to circumvent the console's authentication system. Most of these companies created circuits that used a voltage spike to disable the 10NES chip in the NES. A few unlicensed games released in Europe and Australia came in the form of a [[dongle]] that would be connected to a licensed game, in order to use the licensed game’s 10NES chip for authentication.

[[Atari Games]] created a line of NES products under the name [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]], and took a different tack: the company obtained a description of the lockout chip from the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] by falsely claiming that it was required to defend against present infringement claims in a legal case. Tengen then used these documents to design its ''Rabbit'' chip, which duplicated the function of the [[10NES]]. Nintendo sued Tengen for these actions, and Tengen lost because of the fraudulent use of the published patent. Tengen’s [[antitrust]] claims against Nintendo were never finally decided.<ref>{{cite web | author=U.S. Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit | year=1992 | title=Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America Inc. | format=html | work=Digital Law Online | url=http://digital-law-online.info/cases/24PQ2D1015.htm | accessdate=March 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

Although successful in its suit against Tengen, Nintendo’s overall track record at suing unlicensed developers was mixed: the case of [[Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc.]] was found in favor of [[Galoob]] and its [[Game Genie]] device, for instance. Most unlicensed developers were eventually forced out of business or out of production by legal fees and court costs for extended lawsuits brought by Nintendo against the companies. One notable exception was [[Color Dreams]], who produced [[Christian video games]] under the subsidiary name [[Wisdom Tree]]. This operation was never sued by Nintendo.

Following the introduction of the [[Sega Mega Drive]], Nintendo began to face real competition in the industry, and in the early 1990s was forced to reevaluate its stance towards its developers, many of whom had begun to defect to other systems. When the console was reissued as the [[NES 2]], the [[10NES]] chip was omitted from the console, marking the end of Nintendo’s most notorious hold over its third-party developers.

Companies that produced unlicensed games or accessories for the Western market include [[Active Enterprises]], American Game Cartridges, [[American Video Entertainment]], [[Camerica]], [[Codemasters]], [[Color Dreams]], Galoob, [[Home Entertainment Suppliers]], [[Panesian]], S.E.I., Tengen, and Wisdom Tree.

=== Hardware clones ===
{{main|Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone}}
[[Image:PSOne Style Famicom Clone.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Pirated clones of NES hardware remained in production for many years after the original had been discontinued. Such devices were frequently built to superficially resemble contemporary consoles, such as the [[PlayStation]].]]A thriving market of unlicensed NES hardware [[Clone (computer science)|clones]] emerged during the heyday of the console’s popularity. Initially, such clones were popular in markets where Nintendo never issued a legitimate version of the system. In particular, the [[Dendy]] ({{lang-ru|Денди}}), an unlicensed hardware clone produced in [[Russia]] and other nations of the former [[Soviet Union]], emerged as the most popular video game console of its time in that setting, and it enjoyed a degree of fame roughly equivalent to that experienced by the NES/Famicom in North America and Japan. The [[Micro Genius]] ([[Simplified Chinese]]: 小天才) was marketed in Southeast Asia as an alternative to the Famicom, and Samurai was the popular [[PAL]] alternative to the NES.

The unlicensed clone market has persisted, and even flourished, following Nintendo’s discontinuation of the NES. As the NES fades into memory, many such systems have adopted case designs which mimic more recent game consoles. NES clones resembling the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and even more recent systems like the [[Nintendo GameCube]], the [[PlayStation 2|Sony PlayStation 2]] and the [[Microsoft Xbox]]{{Fact|date=July 2007}} have been produced. Some of the more exotic of these systems have gone beyond the functionality of the original hardware, and have included variations such as a portable system with a color LCD (e.g. [[Pocket Famicom]]). Others have been produced with certain specialized markets in mind, including various "educational computer packages" which include copies of some of the NES’s educational titles and come complete with a clone of the Famicom BASIC keyboard, transforming the system into a rather primitive [[personal computer]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Davidson, Michael | title=Famicom Clones / Pirate Multicarts and Other Weirdness | format=html | work=Obscure Pixels | url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~pinwhiz/famicom.htm | accessdate=January 5 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>  These unauthorized clones have been helped by the invention of the so called [[NES-on-a-chip]] or NoaC.

As was the case with unlicensed software titles, Nintendo has typically gone to the courts to prohibit the manufacture and sale of unlicensed cloned hardware. Many of the clone vendors have included built-in copies of licensed Nintendo software, which constitutes copyright infringement in most countries. As recently as 2004, Nintendo of America has filed suits against manufacturers of the [[Power Player Super Joy III]], an NES clone system that had been sold in [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]].

Although most hardware clones were not produced under license by Nintendo, certain companies were granted licenses to produce NES-compatible devices. The [[Sharp Corporation]] produced at least two such clones: the [[Twin Famicom]] and the [[SHARP 19SC111]] television. The Twin Famicom was compatible with both Famicom cartridges and [[Famicom Disk System]] disks.  It was available in two colors (red and black) and used hardwired controllers (as did the original Famicom), but it featured a different case design. The SHARP 19SC111 television was a television which included a built-in Famicom.<ref>{{cite web | author=ASSEMbler | title= Sharp Nintendo Television | format=html | work=[http://assembler.roarvgm.com/index.html ASSEMbler] | url=http://assembler.roarvgm.com/Sharp_Nintendo_Television/sharp_nintendo_television.html | accessdate=January 17 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>  A similar licensing deal was reached with [[Hyundai Electronics]], who manufactured the system under the name Comboy in the [[South Korean]] market. This deal with Hyundai was made necessary because of the South Korean government's wide ban on all Japanese "cultural products," which remained in effect until [[1998]] and ensured that the only way Japanese products could legally enter the South Korean market was through licensing to a third-party (non-Japanese) distributor (see also [[Korean-Japanese disputes]]).<ref name="korea" />

== Technical specifications ==
=== Chassis/casing ===
[[Image:Jeux NES 2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|North American cartridges (or "Game Paks," pictured) were significantly longer than their Japanese counterparts, but slightly less wide.]]
The original Japanese Famicom was predominantly white plastic, with dark red trim. It featured a top-loading cartridge slot, and grooves on both sides of the deck in which the hardwired game controllers could be placed when not in use.

The original version of the North American NES utilized a radically different design. The NES's color scheme was two different shades of gray, with black trim. The top-loading cartridge slot was replaced with a front-loading mechanism. The slot is covered by a small, hinged door that can be opened to insert or remove a cartridge, and closed at other times. The dimensions of this model are 10" width by 8" length by 3.5" height. When opened, the cartridge slot door adds an additional 1" height to the unit.

The remodelled NES 2 uses the same basic color scheme, although the power switch is colored a bright red. Like the original Famicom, it utilizes a top-loading cartridge slot. The NES 2 is considerably more compact than the original model, measuring 6" by 7" by 1.5".

All officially licensed North American and European cartridges are 5.5" long by 4.1" wide. Japanese cartridges are shaped slightly differently, measuring only 3" in length, but 5.3" in width.

=== Central processing unit ===
[[Image:RP2A07.jpg|thumb|200px|Versions of the NES console released in PAL regions incorporated a Ricoh 2A07 CPU.]]
For its [[central processing unit]] (CPU), the NES uses an [[8-bit]] [[microprocessor]] produced by [[Ricoh]] based on a [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] core.  It incorporates custom sound hardware and a restricted [[DMA controller]] on-die. [[NTSC]] (North America and Japan) versions of the console use the [[Ricoh 2A03]] (or RP2A03), which runs at 1.79 [[MHz]].<ref name="specs">{{cite web | title=NES Specifications | url=http://nocash.emubase.de/everynes.htm | format=html | accessdate=6 June | accessyear=2007 }}</ref> [[PAL]] (Europe and Australia) versions of console utilize the Ricoh 2A07 (or RP2A07), which is identical to the 2A03 save for the fact that it runs at a slower 1.66 MHz [[clock rate]].<ref name="specs2">{{cite web | title=NES specificaties | url=http://www.rgame.nl/nesspecs_eng.html | work=[http://www.rgame.nl/index_eng.html Rgame.nl] | format=html | accessdate=6 June | accessyear=2007 }}</ref>

=== Memory ===
The NES contains 2 [[Kibibyte|KiB]] of onboard [[random access memory]] (RAM). A game cartridge may contain expanded RAM to increase this amount. The system supports up to 49,128 bytes (just shy of 48 KiB) for [[read-only memory]] (ROM), expanded RAM, and cartridge [[input/output]]. The process of [[bank switching]] can increase this amount by orders of magnitude.<ref name="specs" />

=== Video ===
The NES utilizes a custom-made [[picture processing unit]] (PPU) developed by Ricoh. The version of the processor used in NTSC models of the console, named the RP2C02, operates at 5.37 MHz, while the version used in PAL models, named the RP2C07, operates at 5.32 MHz.<ref name="specs2" /> Both the RP2C02 and RP2C07 output [[composite video]].<ref name="specs" /> Special versions of the NES's hardware designed for use in [[video arcade]]s use other variations of the PPU. The [[PlayChoice-10]] uses the RP2C03, which runs at 5.37 MHz and outputs [[RGB#Video electronics|RGB video]] at NTSC frequencies. Two different variations were used for [[Nintendo Vs. Series]] hardware: the RP2C04 and the RP2C05. Both of these operate at 5.37 MHz and output RGB video at NTSC frequencies. Additionally, both utilize irregular palettes to prevent easy ROM swapping of games.<ref name="vsseries">{{cite web | title=Unisystem VS schematic | url=http://www.raphnet.net/electronique/nes_vs/VSSCHEM.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=6 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> All variations of this PPU feature 256 bytes of on-die sprite position / attributable RAM ("OAM") and 28 bytes of on-die palette RAM to allow selection of background and [[Sprite (computer science)|sprite]] colors. This memory is stored on separate buses internal to the PPU. The console's 2 KiB of onboard RAM may be used for tile maps and attributes on the NES board, and 8 KiB of tile pattern ROM or RAM may be included on a cartridge. Using bank switching, virtually any amount of additional cartridge memory can be used, limited only by manufacturing costs.<ref name="specs" />

The system has an available [[Palette (computing)|color palette]] of 48 colors and 5 grays. Red, green, and blue can be individually darkened at specific screen regions using carefully timed code. Up to 25 colors may be used on one [[scanline]]: a background color, four sets of three tile colors, and four sets of three sprite colors. This total does not include color de-emphasis.<ref name="specs" />

A total of 64 sprites may be displayed onscreen at a given time without reloading sprites mid-screen. Sprites may be either 8 [[pixels]] by 8 pixels, or 8 pixels by 16 pixels, although the choice must be made globally and it affects all sprites. Up to eight sprites may be present on one scanline, using a flag to indicate when additional sprites are to be dropped. This flag allows the software to rotate sprite priorities, increasing maximum amount of sprites, but typically causing [[Flicker (screen)|flicker]].<ref name="specs" />

The PPU allows only one [[Parallax scrolling|scrolling layer]], though horizontal scrolling can be changed on a per-scanline basis. More advanced programming methods enable the same to be done for vertical scrolling.<ref name="specs" />

The standard [[display resolution]] of the NES is 256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels. Typically, games designed for NTSC-based systems had an effective resolution of only 256 by 224 pixels, as the top and bottom 8 scanlines [[Overscan|are not visible]] on most television sets. For additional video memory bandwidth, it was possible to turn off the screen before the [[Raster scan|raster]] reached the very bottom.<ref name="specs" />

Video output connections varied from one model of the console to the next. The original Japanese Famicom featured only [[RF modulator|radio frequency (RF) modulator]] output. When the console was released in North America and Europe, support for composite video through [[RCA connector]]s was added in addition to the RF modulator. The AV Famicom dropped the RF modulator entirely and adopted composite video output via a proprietary 12-pin "multi-out" connector first introduced for the Super Famicom / Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Conversely, the North American rereleased NES 2 most closely resembled the original model Famicom, in that it featured RF modulator output only.<ref name="20years" /> Finally, the PlayChoice-10 utilized an inverted RGB video output.

=== Audio ===
The NES board supported a total of five sound channels. These included two [[pulse wave]] channels of variable [[duty cycle]] (12.5%, 25%, 50%, and 75%), with a volume control of sixteen levels, and hardware [[Portamento|pitch bending]] supporting frequencies ranging from 54 [[Hz]] to 28 [[kHz]]. Additional channels included one fixed-volume [[triangle wave]] channel supporting frequencies from 27 Hz to 56 kHZ, one sixteen-volume level [[white noise]] channel supporting two modes (by adjusting inputs on a [[linear feedback shift register]]) at sixteen preprogrammed frequencies, and one delta [[pulse-width modulation]] channel with six bits of range, using 1-bit delta encoding at sixteen preprogrammed sample rates from 4.2 kHz to 33.5 kHz, often resulting in poor sound quality{{Fact|date=July 2007}}. This final channel was also capable of playing standard [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) sound by writing individual 7-bit values at timed intervals.<ref name="specs" />
