'''Lafayette Ronald Hubbard''' ([[13 March]] [[1911]] &ndash; [[24 January]] [[1986]]), better known as '''L. Ron Hubbard''', was an [[United States|American]] [[fiction]] and [[self-help]] writer<ref name="Blue Sky">{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/atack/index.html | title = A Piece of Blue Sky | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY|id = ISBN 0-8184-0499-X}}</ref><!--page 65--><ref name="Pulpateer">{{cite web|last=Hubbard |first=L.

Hubbard was a controversial public figure, with many details of his life disputed. The Church of Scientology official biographies present Hubbard as "larger than life, attracted to people, liked by people, dynamic, charismatic and immensely capable in a dozen fields".<ref name="LRHsite">[http://www.lronhubbard.org L. Ron Hubbard Site] (accessed 4/15/06)</ref> However, the Church's account of Hubbard's life has changed over time, with editions of the biographical account published over the years differing from each other.<ref>EG, differences in editions of ''What is Scientology?'' noted by Tom Voltz in his book [http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/books/swoe00.htm '''Scientology With(out) an End'''],  pages [http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/books/swoe07.htm 58-59].</ref> 

In contrast, biographies of Hubbard by independent journalists and accounts by former Scientologists paint a much less flattering, and often highly critical, picture of Hubbard and in many cases contradict the material presented by the Church.<ref>Corydon, Bent ''[http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/mom/Messiah_or_Madman.txt L.

==Early life==

L. Ron Hubbard was born in 1911 in [[Tilden, Nebraska]]. His father Harry Ross Hubbard was born Henry August Wilson in [[Fayette, Iowa]], but was [[orphan]]ed as an [[infant]] and adopted by the Hubbards, a farming family of [[Fredericksburg, Iowa]]. Harry Ross Hubbard joined the [[United States Navy]] in 1904, leaving the service in 1908, then re-enlisting in 1917 when the United States [[World War I|declared war on Germany]]. He served in the Navy until 1946, reaching the rank of [[Lieutenant-Commander]] in 1934.<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 70 -->

His mother Dora May Hubbard (née Waterbury) was a [[feminist]] who had trained to become a [[high school]] teacher and married Harry in 1909. Her father, Lafayette O. Waterbury (born [[1864]]), was a [[veterinarian]] turned [[coal]] merchant. Her mother, Ida Corinne DeWolfe, was the daughter of affluent banker John DeWolfe. May's paternal grandfather, Abram Waterbury, was from the [[Catskill Mountains]], and later headed West, employed as a [[veterinarian]].<ref name=bio77>[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio00.html Biography issued 7 April 1977 by Liz Gablehouse][http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio01.html pg.1],[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio02.html pg.2],[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio03.html pg.3],[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio04.html pg.4],[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio05.html pg.5],[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio06.html pg.6],[http://misou.awardspace.us/lrhbio07.html pg.7]</ref><ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 8-9 -->

The Hubbards moved first to [[Kalispell, Montana]] and then to [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], the state capital. Church biographies have stated that during this period Hubbard became the protegé of "Old Tom, a [[Blackfoot]] Indian medicine man ... [who] passe[d] on much of the tribal lore to his young friend" and that at the age of four, he was "honored with the status of blood brother of the Blackfeet in a ceremony that is still recalled by tribal elders." <ref>"[http://www.scientology.org/html/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/chronicle/index.html L. Ron Hubbard - A Chronicle - 1911-1917]. Accessed 27 Jan 2007</ref>. In 1937 Hubbard honored this status with "Buckskin Brigades", a "novel of one man's courageous struggle to save the Blackfoot Nation from destruction by the Northwestern fur traders"<ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/buckskin1.html L. Ron Hubbard, ''Buckskin Brigades''],[http://misou.awardspace.us/buckskin2.html 1937, republished 1977], ISBN 0-91797201-5</ref>. In 1985 Tribal Council members of Blackfeet Nation, Montana, acknowledged L. Ron Hubbard's "seventieth anniversary of ... becoming a blood brother of the Blackfeet Nation"<ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/blackfoot.html Letter dated 27 August 1985], Blackfeet Nation, Browning, Montana, signed by Fischer, Mataisz and Kennerly (Tribal Council)</ref>. Contemporary records do not record the existence of "Old Tom". The white Blackfeet historian Hugh Dempsey has commented that the act of [[blood brother]]hood was "never done among the Blackfeet", and some Blackfeet Nation officials have disavowed attempts to "re-establish" Hubbard as a "blood brother" of the Blackfeet<ref>"Staking a Claim to Blood Brotherhood", ''Los Angeles Times'', 24 June 1990, page A38:5</ref>.  

Harry Ross Hubbard's naval career led to the family moving several more times, first to [[San Diego]], then to [[Oakland, California]] followed by [[Puget Sound]] in the state of [[Washington]] and finally to [[Washington, D.C.]]. During this period L. Ron Hubbard joined the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] at the age of 13. Church biographies routinely state that he was "the nation's youngest Eagle Scout."<ref name="chronicle01">[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/chronicle/pg001.html L. Ron Hubbard - A Chronicle - 1918-1921].

Between 1927 and 1929, Hubbard traveled twice to the [[Far East]] to visit his parents during his father's posting to the [[United States Navy]] base on [[Guam]]. Church biographies published from the 1950s to the 1970s stated that with "the financial support of his wealthy grandfather" Hubbard journeyed throughout Asia, "studying with holy men" in northern [[China]],  [[India]] and [[Tibet]].<ref name="certainty">"L. Ron Hubbard", Certainty, vol. 3 no. 2, Hubbard Association of Scientologists International, 1956</ref><ref name="mit">"L. Ron Hubbard - Explorer of Two Realms", in Hubbard, ''Mission into Time'', Advanced Organization Saint Hill Denmark, 1973</ref> Hubbard said that on several occasions he visited India.<ref>See ''inter alia'' Hubbard, "Case Analysis - Rock Hunting - Q&A Period", lecture of 4 August 1958: "I got over to Asia and India..."; Hubbard, "Universes", lecture of 6 April 1954: "But in the interim [as a boy] I was in India..."; Hubbard, "Mechanics of the Mind", lecture of 10 January 1953: "I struggled along in north China, India and was back in the States and then back out there again."</ref> However, the Church of Scientology's current official account makes no mention of India or Tibet,<ref>[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/chronicle/pg002.html L. Ron Hubbard - A Chronicle - 1926-1929]. Accessed 28 Jan 2007</ref> and according to [[Jon Atack]] "a flight change at [[Calcutta]] airport in 1959 seems to have been his only direct contact with the land of [[Veda]]ntic philosophy."<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 57 -->

While in Guam<ref name="aapsa" /> Hubbard was befriended by Commander [[Joseph Cressman Thompson|Joseph "Snake" Thompson]] (1876-1943), who {{interp|had}} recently returned from Vienna and studies with Sigmund Freud and was stationed as a member of the Naval Medical Corps<ref name="aapsa">[http://www.aapsa.org/forum/forum43_1.html#4312 The American Academy of Psychoanalysis], ''The Psychoanalytic Roots of Scientology'' by Silas L. Warner, M.D. Lightly edited by Ann-Louise S. Silver, M.D. The American Academy of Psychoanalysis, Presented at the winter meeting, New York City December 12, 1993</ref>. Through the course of their friendship, the commander {{interp|spent}} many an afternoon teaching Ron what he knows of the human mind."<ref name="chronicle01" /> Thompson is an important figure in official Church accounts of Hubbard's life and was referenced in many of Hubbard's works in support of his claims to possess expertise in Freudian [[psychoanalysis]].<ref>See ''inter alia'' Hubbard, "Special Effect Cases, Anatomy Of - Q&A period", lecture of 23 July 1958: "I have made people feel better by using straight Freudian analysis the way I got it from Commander Thompson who imported it to the US Navy"; Hubbard, "Universes", lecture of 6 April 1954: "I was fortunate enough to be trained to some degree by Commander Thompson, who had himself studied with Sigmund Freud"; Hubbard, "The Story of Dianetics and Scientology", lecture of 18 October 1958: "When I was about twelve years old ... I met one of the great men of Freudian analysis - a Commander Thompson ... he started shoving my nose into an education in the field of the mind."</ref>

==Education==
After studies at Swavely Preparatory School in Manassas, Virginia, and graduating from Woodward School for Boys in 1930, Hubbard enrolled at the [[George Washington University]], where he majored in [[civil engineering]]. 
There he became associate editor of the University newspaper ''"The University Hatchet"''<ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/universityhatchet02.html "The University Hatchet"] of George Washington University, Vol. 28 , No. 33, May 24, 1932, lists L. Ron Hubbard as "Assistant Editor"</ref><ref>[http://www.gwhatchet.com/ "The Hatchet"]</ref> and was a member of many of the University's clubs and societies including the Twentieth Marine Corps Reserve and the George Washington College Company<ref name=bio77>Biography issued 7 April 1977 by Liz Gablehouse</ref>.
His grades varied widely, and university records show that he attended for only two years, was on academic probation for his second year, and left the University in 1932 without a degree. The Church of Scientology's official account of Hubbard's university career does not mention its premature conclusion. <ref name="chronicle1930-1933">"[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/chronicle/pg003.html L. Ron Hubbard: A Chronicle 1930-1933]", Church of Scientology International. Accessed 4 March 2007</ref><ref name=bio77 /> In June 1932 Hubbard heads the so called ''Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition''. The two-and-a-half-month, 5,000-mile voyage aboard the 200-foot, four-masted schooner "Doris Hamlin" with over fifty college students has the purpose to collect floral and reptile specimens for the University of Michigan.<ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/universityhatchet01.html "The University Hatchet", May 24, 1932], "L.

Critics have questioned many of the claims that Hubbard and the Church of Scientology later made about his university years. According to the Church's official account, "Here he studies engineering and atomic and molecular physics and embarks upon a personal search for answers to the human dilemma. His first experiment concerning the structure and function of the mind is carried out while at the university."<ref name="chronicle1930-1933" /> One of his classes was indeed a second-year physics course entitled "Modern Physical Phenomena; Molecular and Atomic Physics", for which he received a grade of "F".<ref>{{cite paper | title = Official Transcript of the Record of Lafayette Ronald Hubbard | publisher = George Washington University | date = [[April 24]], [[1941]] | url = http://www.lermanet.com/L_Ron_Hubbard/mr142.htm | accessdate = 2006-07-30 }}</ref> On the basis of this class, however, Hubbard claimed to be a "nuclear physicist"<ref>Hubbard, "P.E.

After the University episode Hubbard works as a writer, aviator and heads further sailing expeditions<ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/thepilot.html The Pilot, July 1934 issue, about Hubbard]</ref><ref>The Sportsman Pilot, articles of L. Ron Hubbard, [http://misou.awardspace.us/sportsmanpilot01.html Issue January 1932], [http://misou.awardspace.us/sportsmanpilot02.html Issue May 1933], [http://misou.awardspace.us/sportsmanpilot03.html Issue October 1933]</ref>. 

In December 1939 Hubbard was proposed as a member to the invite-only "Explorers Club" in New York City. He got accepted as a member on 19 February 1940 and awarded the flag of the club in May 1940 for his "Alaskan Radio Experimental Expedition". Further flags followed over the coming 25 years<ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/explorersclub1.html Explorers Club NYC, proposal for membership, dated 12 Dec 1939]</ref><ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/explorersclub2.html Explorers Club NYC, Member certificate of L.

In 1961 he was awarded the Explorers Club flag for his 'Ocean Archaeological Expedition' ... Just recently Mr. Hubbard was again awarded custody of the Explorers Club flag for the 'Hubbard Geological Survey Expedition' ..."</ref>.

In December 1940 Hubbard was licensed by the United States Department of Commerce to "Master of Steam and Motor Vessels", valid first in the Pacific Ocean only and - from March 1941 on - in "Any Ocean".<ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/vesselmaster02.html US Dept of Commerce certificate 160111, "License to Master of steam and motor vessels", "Pacific Ocean", 17 Dec 1940];[http://misou.awardspace.us/vesselmaster01.html US Dept of Commerce certificate 12005, "License to Master of steam and motor vessels", "Any Ocean", 29 March 1941]</ref>

Hubbard stated to have been educated at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. In the preface for his 1951 book ''[[Science of Survival]]'', he thanks "my instructors in atomic and molecular phenomena, mathematics and the humanities at George Washington University and at Princeton". However, he was never a member of Princeton University's student body; instead, he participated in a four-month course in military government at the Naval Training School, Princeton during the [[Second World War]].<ref name="Bare-faced" />

On February 10, 1953 Hubbard was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]][[honoris causa|h.c.]] by [[Sequoia University]], California, "in recognition of his outstanding work and contributions in the fields of Dianetics and Scientology."<ref>Notarized affidavit of the President of Sequoia University, J.W.

==Early fiction career==
[[Image:MastersOfSleep.jpg|left|thumb|200 px|Hubbard's post war writing career: Cover of October, 1950 edition of ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'' featuring Hubbard's "The Masters of Sleep".]]

Hubbard published many stories and novellas in aviation, sports and [[pulp magazine]]s during the 1930s.<ref name="Pulpateer"/> Critics often cite ''Final Blackout'', set in a war-ravaged future Europe, and ''Fear'', a psychological horror story, as the best examples of Hubbard's pulp fiction. ''Final Blackout'' was cited by [[Karl Edward Wagner]] as one of the thirteen best science-fiction horror novels.<ref>N G Christakos, "Three By Thirteen: The Karl Edward Wagner Lists" in ''Black Prometheus: A Critical Study of Karl Edward Wagner'', ed. Benjamin Szumskyj, Gothic Press 2007</ref>

Among his published stories were ''Sea Fangs'', ''The Carnival of Death'', ''Man-Killers of the Air'', and ''The Squad that Never Came Back''; among the pseudonyms Hubbard used were Rene Lafayette, Legionnaire 148, Lieutenant Scott Morgan, Morgan de Wolf, Michael de Wolf, Michael Keith, Kurt von Rachen, Captain Charles Gordon, Legionnaire 14830, Elron, Bernard Hubbel, Captain B.A. Northrup, Joe Blitz and Winchester Remington Colt.<ref name="Blue Sky">{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = A Piece of Blue Sky | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | id = ISBN 0-8184-0499-X}}</ref><!--page 63-65--> He became a well-known author in the [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] genres; he also published [[westerns]] and adventure stories.

By 1936, at the age of 25, Hubbard was in Hollywood working as a scriptwriter on several films, amongst them the Columbia production "The Secret of Treasure Island".<ref name=bio77 /><ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/secretoftreasure.html The copyright notice of the movie shows Hubbard as the script writer]</ref>

Hubbard's [[metafiction]] novel ''Typewriter in the Sky'', published in 1940 in two installments in [[John W. Campbell]]'s ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'' magazine, provides an amusing insight into the New York writing scene within which Hubbard worked. The novel is centered around a character named Horace Hackett, who is a hyper-productive, multi-genre [[hack writer]] desperately trying to finish his latest [[potboiler]] to an ever-approaching deadline while (unknown to him) his friend Mike de Wolf is trapped inside the potboiler's action. Two of Horace's author friends, in Hubbard's novel, are named Winchester Remington Colt and Rene Lafayette after Hubbard's own pseudonyms.

After some years in the Navy (1941-1947), Hubbard returned to writing fiction briefly for a few years, his best-remembered work from this period being the ''[[Ole Doc Methuselah]]'' series for Campbell's ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine. It was in the pages of this magazine that the first article on Dianetics appeared; while some fiction works appeared after that (including "Masters of Sleep", which promotes Dianetics and features as a villain "a mad psychiatrist, Doctor Dyhard, who persists in rejecting Dianetics after all his abler colleagues have accepted it {{interp|and}} believes in prefrontal lobotomies for everyone")<ref>{{cite journal | last = Frenschkowski | first = Marco | year = 1999 | month = July | title = L.

Hubbard did not make a major return to fiction again until the 1980s.

== Commission and service with the O.N.I. ==
In 1941 Hubbard was commissioned as a [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade]] in the [[United States Navy]] after one of his professors recommended him for service in intelligence and a successful interview with the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]]. The position offered Hubbard the chance at a distinguished career, as intelligence officers were badly needed. It also allowed him to skip the initial officer rank of [[Ensign (rank)#United States|Ensign]]. After [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] he received orders deploying him to the [[Philippines]]<ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/navyendors.html Hubbard endorsements record, page 4]</ref>, specifically [[Manila]]. While embarked on the SS President Polk Japanese forces cut off the sea route to the Philippines, diverting the ship to [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. Upon arrival Hubbard asked the Naval Attaché if he could leave the Polk in order to secure faster transport to the Philippines. He was unable to locate other transport, and instead began working as a sort of liaison for a deployed Army unit. This duty had not been ordered and he made himself somewhat of a nuisance by working outside the established [[chain of command]]. He was then sent back to the United States, with a note stating: "This officer is not satisfactory for independent duty assignment. ... and will require close supervision for satisfactory performance of any intelligence duty."<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:420214.gif Subject: Lieutenant (jg) L. Ron Hubbard, U.S.N.R.; Suggestion as to nature of duty assigned. 14 February 1942]</ref><ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:420217-2.gif Document indicating Hubbard's transfer from SW Pacific area and reason why.]</ref>[[Image:Yp422 large.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|[[USS YP-422|''USS YP-422'']] prior to final conversion]]

==== From the O.N.I. to ''USS YP-422'' ====

The situation cost him an opportunity to work as a Naval Intelligence officer, and he was subsequently made prospective Commanding Officer of [[USS YP-422|USS ''YP-422'']]. A fishing trawler undergoing conversion into a shipyard patrol vessel at the [[Boston Naval Shipyard]], it had been called ''Mist'' by its civilian owners. Shortly after arrival a personality dispute there evolved into a situation which Lt. Hubbard did not feel was handled properly by the Commandant of the shipyard. Ignoring the [[chain of command]], he then spoke with the Commandant's [[Commanding Officer|C.O.]] the Vice Chief of Naval Operations. Subsequently the Commandant requested Hubbard be relieved of command noting he is: "...not temperamentally fitted for independent command."<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:420925a.gif] Commandant's request to relieve Hubbard.</ref><ref name="Blue Sky"/><!--p. 74--> He then repeated his mistake, and asked again for the intervention of the Vice Chief's office. The second request was not acted upon either.<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:420925b.gif] Hubbard's request for intervention of Vice Chief of Naval Operations.</ref>These statements are in stark contrast with official Scientologist literature, which often portrays Hubbard as a role model sailor during the war.<ref name="MBTR"/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://aboutlronhubbard.org/eng/wis3_1r.htm | title= About the Life Story of L.

==== ''PC-815's'' possible submarine contact ====

Being relieved of command, he was briefly sent back to the Bureau of Personnel for reassignment. After requesting training in the operation and command of PC class submarine chasers<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:PCrqst.gif Image of request to attend PC school] - Wikimedia Commons</ref> he reported to a naval school in [[Florida]]. There he was trained in anti-submarine warfare, and graduated in the bottom half of his class. He was then assigned as prospective Commanding Officer of the [[USS PC-815|USS ''PC-815'']]. The vessel was in the last stages of construction, near [[Astoria, Oregon]]. His first duties were supervising her fitting out, training of the crew, and finally deployment to [[San Diego, California]], her assigned port. 

In the early hours of [[May 19]], [[1943]], the crew of the ''PC-815'' detected what Hubbard evaluated as first one then later two [[Imperial Japanese Navy submarines]] approximately 10 miles from the shore of [[Cape Lookout (Oregon)|Cape Lookout]]. Lt. Hubbard, his Executive Officer, Lt. Moulton, and the [[SONAR]] operator, all trained in the use of the equipment, evaluated the echo of an [[Active sonar#Active sonar|active sonar ping]], combined with apparent propeller noises ("screws") heard through the ship's [[hydrophone]] as indicating contact with a submarine.<ref> "Proceeding southward just inside the steamer track an echo ranging contact was made by soundman then on duty, <NAME REDACTED>,Soundman third class. The Commanding Officer had the conn and immediatly slowed all engines to ahead one third to better echo ranging conditions, and placed the contact dead ahead, 500 yards away." and "Screw noises, fluttering and without pulsation, were distinct on the bearing and quite different from the pulsations of our screws." [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Batrep01.gif Page 1 of Hubbard's report]  Image: Page one of Lt. Hubbard's report</ref>

Over the next two and a half days, the ship expended 37 depth charges and saw none of the telltale signs of a sunken submarine. Hubbard did identify "orange" oil "erupting" to the surface at one point, however the color and lack of other debris consistent with a pressure hull compromised submarine were not seen. The US Navy [[blimp]]s ''K-39'' and ''K-33'', the [[US Coast Guard]] patrol boats ''Bonham'' and 78302, and the subchasers USS ''SC-536'' and USS ''SC-537'', were all summoned to act as reinforcements, and, according to Hubbard's battle report, placed under his command. On [[May 21]], with depth charges exhausted and the presence of a submarine still unconfirmed by any other ship, the ''PC-815'' was ordered back to Astoria.<ref>Hubbard, ''ANTI-SUBMARINE ACTION BY SURFACE SHIP, REPORT OF'', 24 May 1943.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Batrep01.gif Page 1 of 18 Hubbard's report]</ref>

In his eighteen page after-action report, Hubbard claimed to have "definitely sunk, beyond doubt" one submarine and critically damaged another. However, the subsequent investigation by the Commander NW Sea Frontier, Vice Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher]], cast a skeptical light on Hubbard's claims. His summary memorandum to Fleet Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], stated:<blockquote>

*''It is noted that the report of PC 815 is not in accordance with "Anti-Submarine Action by Surface Ship" (ASW-1) which should be submitted to Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet.''<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:U-521ASW-1.gif Example of form ASW-1 filled by another subchaser of the PC-416 class where a submarine was actually sunk and the report submitted properly]</ref>
*''An analysis of all reports convinces me that there was no submarine in the area. Lieutenant Commander Sullivan states that he was unable to obtain any evidence of a submarine except one bubble of air which is unexplained except by turbulence of water due to a depth charge explosion. The Commanding Officers of all ships except the PC-815 state they had no evidence of a submarine and do not think a submarine was in the area.''</blockquote><ref>"Battle Report - Submission of.", A16-3(3)/PC815, Vice Adm. Frank Jack Fletcher, Commander NW Sea Frontier, 8 June 1943; [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Batconcl.gif Image of document]</ref>

Fletcher added that "there is a known magnetic deposit in the area in which depth charges were dropped", as the responding blimps were equipped with a [[Magnetic Anomaly Detector]] for submarine detection and had registered an undetermined anomaly. It should be noted that the Imperial Japanese Navy did not operate it's submarines near the West Coast on a regular basis. They were criticized by their [[Nazi Germany|German]] allies for not pursuing a policy of [[commerce raiding]], which would target cargo ships and oil tankers,  rather than adhering to their practice of fleet warfare which caused them to attack large warships and aircraft carriers. Japanese submarines were in fact so dedicated to attacking warships instead of merchant vessels, that the shipping lanes in the [[Pacific Theater|Pacific]] did not use the convoy system necessitated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939-1945)|Atlantic]] caused by [[u-boat]]s.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/USSBS/IJO/IJO-70.html#Japanese Interrogation of: Vice Admiral Paul H Weneker, German Naval Attaché Japan] - Hyperwar project - Admiral Weneker speaks about Japanese tactics and submarines over the course of the war, as well as the IJN High Command's attitude toward submarine warfare.</ref> After the war, British and American analysis of captured Japanese Navy records further confirmed that no Japanese submarines had been lost off the Oregon coast.<ref>HM Admiralty, ''German, Italian and Japanese U-Boat Casualties during the War: Particulars of Destruction'', Cmd. 6843 (June 1946); US Navy, ''Japanese Naval and Merchant Shipping Losses during World War II by All Causes'' (February 1947)</ref> Hubbard, however, continued to claim that he had engaged the enemy, as did his Executive Office, Lt. Moulton, in later testimony. Years later, Hubbard told Scientologists:

<blockquote>''I dropped the I-76 or the Imperial Japanese Navy Trans-Pacific Submarine down into the mouth of the Columbia River, dead duck. And it went down with a resounding furor. And that was that. I never thought about it again particularly except to get mad at all the admirals I had to make reports to because of this thing, see? This was one out of seventy-nine separate actions that I had to do with. And it had no significance, see? But the other day I was kind of tired, and my dad suddenly sprung on me the fact that my submarine had been causing a tremendous amount of difficulty in the mouth of the Columbia River. Hadn't thought about this thing for years. Of course, it's all shot to ribbons, this thing. It's got jagged steel sticking out at all ends and angles, and it's a big submarine! It's a -- I don't know, about the size of the first [[USS Narwhal (SS-167)|Narwhal]] that we built. And the fishermen coming in there and fishing are dragging their nets around in that area, and it's just tearing their nets to ribbons -- they've even hired a civilian contractor to try to blow the thing up and get it the devil out of there -- and has evidently been raising bob with postwar fishing here for more years than I'd care to count.''</blockquote><ref>Hubbard, "Auditing Techniques - Games Conditions", lecture of 1 February 1957</ref>

==== [[Coronado Islands]] incident ====

A month later, the ''PC-815'' was assigned to guard the new escort aircraft carrier [[USS Croatan (CVE-25)]] as it proceeded to [[San Diego]], which would also become home port for ''PC-815''. She arrived there on June 2, and at the end of the month was ordered to sea for an anti-submarine training exercise. The exercise, held on [[June 28]], ended early and Hubbard took the apparent opportunity to order an impromptu gunnery exercise. Compounding what would later be revealed a huge blunder, was his choice to do this while anchored just off the [[Mexican]] territory of South Coronado Island. He would come to regret this decision as his orders included no mention of gunnery practice, staying at sea, or anchoring in Mexican waters. ''PC-815'' was expected that evening in San Diego, according to his orders. The Mexican government also sent an official protest to the US Navy, as no gunnery operations had been authorized.

On [[June 30]] a Board of Investigation was convened concerning ''PC-815'' which concluded that Hubbard had disregarded orders, by conducting gunnery practice, failing to return when expected, and by anchoring in Mexican territorial waters without proper authority. His orders stated that the PC-815 was supposed to return after completing that days training exercises, regardless of how early they ended. Hubbard argued that his crew was inexperienced, it was foggy, and he was tired so he was unable to follow his orders and return that evening. A month earlier in his after action report concerning the submarine fiasco off Cape Lookout, he had described the same men as "experienced" and "highly skilled"<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Batrep01.gif Hubbard's report].</ref> Vice Admiral Fletcher, who both chaired the board and read the prior month's after action report, rated Hubbard "below average". His fitness report by Admiral Braisted noted: <blockquote>''Consider this officer lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation. He acts without forethought as to probable results. He is believed to have been sincere in his efforts to make his ship efficient and ready. Not considered qualified for command or promotion at this time. Recommend duty on a large vessel where he can be properly supervised.''</blockquote><ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Hubbardfitrep-b.gif Image of fitness report following Coronados incident Page 2(with quote)] - Wikimedia Commons and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Hubbardfitrep-a.gif Image of fitness report following Coronados incident page 1] - Wikimedia Commons</ref>Hubbard was relieved of command effective [[July 7]], [[1943]] and given a letter of admonition.<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:430715.gif Image of Hubbard's Letter of Admonition] - Wikimedia Commons</ref><ref>Miller, p. 106</ref><ref name="Blue Sky"/> Essentially the opposite to a letter of commendation which he would later claim among other honors in a forged release form years later.
[[Image:Algol aka 54 1944.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|[[USS Algol (AKA-54)]] circa [[1944]] ]] 
This time his new post appears to have been decided after taking into account the advice of Admiral Fletcher as well as the previous officers, by placing him as a subordinate rather than commanding officer. His final ship was the attack transport [[USS Algol (AKA-54)]],<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:431125.gif Image of Hubbard's orders assigning him to the USS Algol]  - Wikimedia Commons</ref> where he served as the Navigation, Training officer, and Ship's censor until a bizarre security incident caused yet another transfer. Lt. Hubbard said he had found a [[Molotov Cocktail|firebomb]] he believed a saboteur had placed in one of the ship's holds, consisting of a coke bottle filled with gasoline and topped with a cloth wick. The circumstances surrounding the apparent discovery of this sabotage attempt, by the ship's navigation officer aroused suspicion enough that he was removed soon after. This was an unfortunate turn for Lt. Hubbard, as his C.O. had given him a mostly positive fitness report with the only issue being a tendency to be temperamental and easily offended.

==== After the war ====

The remainder of Hubbard's wartime service was spent ashore in the [[continental United States]]. He was mustered out of the active service list in late [[1945]] while still in the hospital<ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/navyhospital.html Hubbard Hospital history 1943 and 1945]</ref>. He continued to draw disability pay for [[arthritis]], his [[ulcer]], and [[conjunctivitis]] for years afterwards<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:451206a-hubarth.gif Image] of Hubbard's medical claim, page 1 from Wikimedia: Commons.</ref><ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:451206b-hubarth.gif Image] of Hubbard's medical claim, page 2 from Wikimedia: Commons.</ref><ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:460919a-arthritis.gif Image] of Navy report on Hubbard's medical claim, page 1 from Wikimedia: Commons.</ref><ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:460919b-arthritis.gif Image] of Navy report on Hubbard's medical claim, page 2 from Wikimedia: Commons.</ref>, long after he claimed to have discovered the secret of how to cure these ailments.  About the time of his discharge, Hubbard was petitioning the [[Veterans Administration]] for psychiatric care to treat "long periods of moroseness and suicidal inclinations." He was also arrested for [[petty theft]] in connection with checks. When he wrote to the FBI that communist spies were after him, an agent attached a note to one of his letters: "Make 'appears mental' card."<ref>[http://www.skeptictank.org/readdig.htm Reader's Digest May 1980 - Scientology]</ref>

In later years, Hubbard made a number of claims about his military record that do not reconcile with the government's documentation of his service years.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Lronhubbardfakedd214.gif image of Hubbard's fake DD-214]
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Lronhubbardrealdd214.gif image of Hubbard's actual DD-214]</ref> For example, Hubbard claimed he had sustained wounds "in combat on the island of [[Java (island)|Java]]",<ref>[http://www.ronthephilosopher.org/page82.htm My Philosophy by L.

However, the US Navy's copy of Hubbard's DD214 is very different, listing a much more modest record.<ref name="MBTR"/> The Scientology version, signed by a nonexistent Lt. Cmdr. Howard D. Thompson, shows Hubbard being awarded medals that do not exist, boasts academic qualifications Hubbard did not earn, and places Hubbard in command of vessels not in the service of the US Navy. The Navy has noted "several inconsistencies exist between Mr. Hubbard's DD214 [the Scientology version] and the available facts".<ref>[http://www.holysmoke.org/sdhok/war-rec.htm Navy: Official - Hubbard's "record" *is* forged]</ref><ref>[http://www.spaink.net/cos/warhero/medals.htm Ron the War Hero: Hubbard's Medal's]</ref>[[Image:Hubbard Aut.png|thumb|right|300 px|Hubbard's authorized awards per his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Lronhubbardrealdd214.gif DD-214].]]


In 1948 Hubbard was working as a "Special Officer" for the Metropolitan Detective Agency, licensed by the Los Angeles Police Department. According to Scientology, he performed the duties of an armed security guard<ref>[http://humanitarian.lronhubbard.org/human/respect5.htm Hubbard in Los Angeles], lronhubbard.org</ref>: "The guarding of particular properties, e.g., banks and warehouses, and the patrolling of a general neighborhood on behalf of local merchants. In the latter, the Special Officer’s duties were virtually the same as the regular officer, although he had no powers of arrest beyond the "citizen’s arrest." <ref>[http://humanitarian.lronhubbard.org/human/respect4.htm Hubbard in Los Angeles], lronhubbard.org</ref>.

==Dianetics==
{{main|Dianetics}}
Beginning in late 1949, Hubbard sought to publicize [[Dianetics]], the [[self-help|self-improvement]] technique. Unable to elicit interest from mainstream publishers or medical professionals,<ref>http://www.ronthephilosopher.org/phlspher/page14.htm</ref> Hubbard turned to the legendary 
science fiction editor [[John W. Campbell]], who had for years published Hubbard's science fiction. The first article on Dianetics was published in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''.  The science fiction community was divided about the merits of Hubbard's claims. Campbell's star author [[Isaac Asimov]] criticized Dianetics' unscientific aspects, and veteran author [[Jack Williamson]] described Dianetics as "a lunatic revision of [[Freudian]] psychology" that "had the look of a wonderfully rewarding scam."<ref name="Bare-faced"/><!--p.152-153--> But Campbell and novelist [[A. E. van Vogt]] enthusiastically embraced Dianetics: Campbell became Hubbard's treasurer, and van Vogt—convinced his wife's health had been transformed for the better by auditing—interrupted his writing career to run the first Los Angeles Dianetics center.<ref name="Bare-faced"/><!--p.166-->

In April 1950, Hubbard and several others established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] to coordinate work related for the forthcoming publication of a book on Dianetics. The book, entitled ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'', was published in May 1950 by [[Hermitage House]], whose head was also on the Board of Directors of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation.<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!--p. 107-9 --> With ''Dianetics,'' Hubbard introduced the concept of "[[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]", a two-person question-and-answer therapy that focused on painful memories. According to Hubbard, dianetic auditing could eliminate emotional problems, cure physical illnesses, and increase intelligence. In his introduction to ''Dianetics'', Hubbard declared that "the creation of dianetics is a milestone for man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his inventions of the wheel and arch."

''Dianetics'' was a hit, selling 150,000 copies within a year of publication.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!-- p. 113 --> Upon becoming more widely available, Dianetics became an object of critical scrutiny by the press and the medical establishment. In September 1950, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a cautionary statement on the topic by the [[American Psychological Association]] that read in part, "the association calls attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by empirical evidence", and went on to recommend against use of "the techniques peculiar to Dianetics" until such time it had been validated by scientific testing. ''[[Consumer Reports]],'' in an August 1951 assessment of Dianetics,<ref>[http://www.xenutv.com/print/consumer-review-0851.htm Dianetics Review]</ref> dryly noted "one looks in vain in ''Dianetics'' for the modesty usually associated with announcement of a medical or scientific discovery", and stated that the book had become "the basis for a new cult." The article observed "in a study of L. Ron Hubbard's text, one is impressed from the very beginning by a tendency to generalization and authoritative declarations unsupported by evidence or facts." ''Consumer Reports'' warned its readers against the "possibility of serious harm resulting from the abuse of intimacies and confidences associated with the relationship between auditor and patient", an especially serious risk, they concluded, "in a cult without professional traditions."

The Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation was incorporated in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]. Branch offices were opened in five other US cities before the end of 1950 (though most folded within a year). Hubbard soon abandoned the Foundation, denouncing a number of his former associates as [[communism|communists]] to the FBI.<ref name="Bare-faced"/><!--p.170-->

==Scientology==
{{main|Scientology}}
In mid-1952, Hubbard expanded Dianetics into a secular philosophy which he called [[Scientology]]. That year, Hubbard also married his third wife, [[Mary Sue Whipp]], to whom he remained married for the rest of his life. With Mary Sue, Hubbard fathered four more children— Diana, [[Quentin Hubbard|Quentin]], Suzette and Arthur —over the next six years.

In December 1953, Hubbard declared Scientology a religion and the first [[Church of Scientology]] was founded in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. He moved to [[England]] at about the same time, and during the remainder of the 1950s he supervised the growing organization from an office in [[London]]. In 1959, he bought [[Saint Hill Manor]] near the [[Sussex, England|Sussex]] town of [[East Grinstead]], a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] manor house owned by the [[Maharajah]] of [[Jaipur]]. This became the world headquarters of Scientology.

Hubbard claimed to have conducted years of intensive research into the nature of human existence; to describe his findings, he developed an elaborate vocabulary with many newly coined terms.<ref name="glossary">[http://www.scientology.org/gloss.htm The Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary]</ref> He codified a set of [[Scientology 0-8: The Book of Basics|Scientology axioms]] and an "applied religious philosophy" that promised to improve the condition of the human [[spirit]], which he called the "[[Thetan]]."<ref>[http://www.scientology.org/wis/WISENG/34/34-scax.htm Scientology Axioms]</ref> The bulk of Scientology focuses on the "rehabilitation" of the thetan.

Hubbard's followers believed his "technology" gave them access to their past lives, the traumas of which led to failures in the present unless they were audited. By this time, Hubbard had introduced a biofeedback device to the auditing process, which he called a "Hubbard Electropsychometer" or "[[E-meter]]." It was invented in the 1940s by a [[chiropractor]] and Dianetics enthusiast named [[Volney Mathison]]. This machine is used by Scientologists in auditing to evaluate "mental masses" surrounding the thetan. These "masses" are claimed to impede the thetan from realizing its full potential.

Hubbard claimed a good deal of physical disease was [[psychosomatic]], and one who, like himself, had attained the enlightened state of "clear" and become an "[[Operating Thetan]]" would be relatively disease free. According to biographers, Hubbard went to great lengths to suppress his recourse to modern medicine, attributing symptoms to attacks by malicious forces, both spiritual and earthly. Hubbard insisted humanity was imperiled by such forces, which were the result of negative memories (or "engrams") stored in the unconscious or "reactive" mind, some carried by the immortal thetans for billions of years. Thus, Hubbard claimed, the only possibility for spiritual salvation was a concerted effort to "clear the planet", that is, to bring the benefits of Scientology to all people everywhere, and attack all forces, social and spiritual, hostile to the interests of the movement.

Church members were expected to pay fixed donation rates for courses, auditing, books and E-meters, all of which proved very lucrative for the Church, which paid emoluments directly to Hubbard and his family.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!--p. 142--> In a case fought by the Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.C. over its tax-exempt status (revoked in 1958 because of these emoluments) the findings of fact in the case included that Hubbard had personally received over $108,000 from the Church and affiliates over a four-year period, over and above the percentage of [[gross income]] (usually 10%) he received from Church-affiliated organizations.<ref name="Foster Report">''Enquiry into the Practice and Effects of Scientology'', Report by Sir John Foster, K.B.E., Q.C., M.P., Published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London December 1971. Cited at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/fosthome.html .</ref><!--para 118--> However, Hubbard denied such emoluments many times in writing, proclaiming he never received any money from the Church.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!--p. 204-->

==Legal difficulties and life on the high seas==
[[Scientology controversy|Scientology became a focus of controversy]] across the English-speaking world during the mid-1960s, with the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], the [[Australia]]n state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]] all holding public inquiries into Scientology's activities.<ref>[http://whyaretheydead.net/Cowen/audit/ofpapers.html Official Papers on Scientology]</ref>

Hubbard left this unwanted attention behind in 1966, when he moved to [[Rhodesia]], following [[Ian Smith]]'s [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]]. Attempting to ingratiate himself with the white minority government, he offered to invest large sums in Rhodesia's economy, then hit by UN sanctions, but was asked to leave the country.

In 1967, L. Ron Hubbard further distanced himself from the controversy attached to Scientology by resigning as executive director of the church and appointing himself "[[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]]" of a small fleet of Scientologist-crewed ships that spent the next eight years cruising the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Here, Hubbard formed the religious order known as the "Sea Organization" or "[[Sea Org]]", with titles and uniforms. The Sea Org subsequently became the management group within Hubbard's Scientology empire. 

He was attended by "Commodore's Messengers", teenaged girls dressed in white [[hot pants]] who waited on him hand and foot, bathing and dressing him and even catching the ash from his cigarettes.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!-- p.245 --> He had frequent screaming tantrums and instituted brutal punishments such as incarceration in the ship's filthy chain-locker for days or weeks at a time and "overboarding", in which errant crew members were blindfolded, bound and thrown overboard, dropping up to 40 ft. into the cold sea,<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!-- p.180-1 --> hoping not to hit the side of the ship with its sharp [[barnacles]] on the way down.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!-- p.187 --><ref>Wakefield, Margery. ''Understanding Scientology'', Chapter 9. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wakefield/us-09.html Reproduced] at [[David S. Touretzky]]'s [[Carnegie Mellon]] site.</ref>  Some of these punishments, such as imprisonment in the chain-locker, were applied to children as well as to adults.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!-- p.180-1 --> He returned to the United States in the mid-1970s and lived for a while in [[Florida]].<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!-- p.209-13 -->

In 1977, Scientology offices on both coasts of the United States were raided by [[FBI]] agents seeking evidence of [[Operation Snow White]], a church-run espionage network. Hubbard's wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard|Mary Sue]] and a dozen other senior Scientology officials were convicted in 1979 of conspiracy against the [[United States federal government]], while Hubbard himself was named by federal prosecutors as an "unindicted co-conspirator."<ref name="Burglaries and Lies">{{cite news|author=Robert W.

In 1978, as part of a case against three French Scientologists Hubbard was convicted for "making fraudulent promises" and given a suspended prison sentence and a 35,000₣ fine by a French court. Hubbard - who had not been defended in the trial at all and had not been in the country during the whole time - refused to appear for the appeal. The case was then appealed by one of the convicts - in 1980 - with all fraud charges being dropped and Scientology recognized as a religion. Another convict got the case retried in 1981 and the fraud charges canceled by judgment of  November 9, 1981. Hubbard himself did not take action until the case was moot and the fine was never enforced.<ref>Reuters wire service, printed in Sunday Star (Toronto), 2 March 1980, also in [http://misou.awardspace.us/iht.html International Herald Tribune, 3 March 1980]:"The Paris Court of Appeal has recognized the U.S.-based Church of Scientology as a religion and cleared a former leader of the movement's French branch of fraud. ...

Hubbard's refusal to talk to British immigration officials about this conviction is said to have later caused the British [[Home Office]] to re-affirm an earlier decision to bar him from the UK.<ref>{{cite news |title= Scientology leader is ordered: Stay away|work= [[Daily Mail]]|date= [[1984-07-29]]}}</ref>. In 1989 however the then Home Office Minister of State, Tim Renton, confirmed in writing that from 1980 until the date of his passing, Hubbard had been free to apply for entry to the United Kingdom under the ordinary immigration rules and that any ban had been lifted on 16 July 1980.<ref>Home Office, Letter of Tim Renton, 24 Feb 1989: "I can indeed confirm that the ban on Scientologists entering this country ... was removed on 16 July 1980."</ref><ref>The Sunday Times, 13 July 1980 "Ministers to lift ban on Scientology", by Michael Jones and John Whale</ref>

==Later life==
During the 1980s, Hubbard returned to science fiction, publishing 
''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'' and ''[[Mission Earth (novel)|Mission Earth]]'', the latter being an enormous book, published as a ten volume series. He also wrote an unpublished [[screenplay]] called ''Revolt in the Stars'', which dramatizes Scientology's [[OT III]] teachings. <ref>[Bare-Faced-Messiah, "Making Movies" http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/atack/bs6-1.htm]</ref>Hubbard's later [[science fiction]] sold well and received mixed reviews, but some press reports describe how sales of Hubbard's books were  inflated by Scientologists purchasing large numbers of copies in order to manipulate the bestseller charts.<ref>McIntyre, Mike ([[April 15]], [[1990]]).

One year before the death of L. Ron Hubbard, the Sunday Times Magazine (28 October, 1984) published a  article<ref>http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/england/sundaytimes-magazine-scientology.htm</ref> on [[Scientology]], including a photo (by Nik Wheeler) of a totally exhausted Ron Hubbard.<ref>[http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/england/old-ugly-l-ron-hubbard-small.jpg] - Sunday Times Article photo</ref> Hubbard died at his ranch on [[24 January]] [[1986]], aged 74, reportedly from a [[stroke]].  Scientology attorneys arrived to claim his body, which they sought to have [[cremation|cremated]] immediately per his will. They were blocked by the [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]] [[medical examiner]], who ordered a drug toxicology test of a blood sample from Hubbard's corpse. Being a drug test, it did not look for the presence of poison. The examination revealed a trace amount of the drug [[hydroxyzine]] (brand name Vistaril).<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Toxicology_Report_Hubbard.gif] Image of Hubbard's toxicology report</ref> <ref>Supplementary Coroner Report, 30 Jan 1986</ref><ref>Letter of Sheriff-Coroner E. Williams,  4 Nov 1987</ref>Vistaril is commonly prescribed as a sedative for symptomatic treatment of anxiety or [[neurosis]] or as an adjunct in non-related diseases in which anxiety is apparent. It is also useful in treating allergic [[itch|pruritus]] such as chronic [[urticaria]] and [[Atopy|atopic]] and contact [[Dermatosis|dermatoses]].<ref>http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_vistaril.pdf; VISTARIL® (hydroxyzine pamoate) Capsules and Oral Suspension; Pfizer; accessed 2007-04-11</ref> After the blood was taken, Hubbard's remains were cremated. 

The Church of Scientology announced Hubbard had deliberately "discarded the body" to do "higher level spiritual research", unencumbered by mortal confines. In May 1987, [[David Miscavige]], one of Hubbard's former personal assistants, assumed the position of Chairman of the [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC), a corporation that owns the trademarked names and symbols of Dianetics and Scientology. Although Religious Technology Center is a separate corporation from the Church of Scientology International, Miscavige is the [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] leader of the religion. Rev.

A number of issues about L. Ron Hubbard's life are controversial, as are aspects of his philosophy, Scientology, and the Church of Scientology that he founded (see [[Scientology controversy]]). 

===Legitimacy of Scientology as a religion===

Some documents written by Hubbard himself suggest he regarded Scientology as a business, not a religion. In one letter dated [[April 10]] [[1953]], he says calling Scientology a religion solves "a problem of practical business", and status as a religion achieves something "more equitable...with what we've got to sell". In a 1962 official policy letter, he said "Scientology 1970 is being planned on a religious organization basis throughout the world. This will not upset in any way the usual activities of any organization. It is entirely a matter for accountants and solicitors."<ref>Hubbard Communications Office Policy Letter, HCOPL, 29 October 1962, as cited in {{cite journal | last = Beit-Hallahmi | first = Benjamin | authorlink = Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi | year = 2003 | month = September | title = Scientology: Religion or racket? | journal = Marburg Journal of Religion | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | url = http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/beit.html | accessdate = 2007-01-07}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ezlink.com/~perry/CoS/Theology/barwell2.htm Is Scientology a religion? Hubbard says "No".]</ref> A Reader's Digest article of May 1980 quoted Hubbard as saying in the 1940s "Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really wants to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion."<ref>[http://www.skeptictank.org/readdig.htm Anatomy of a Frightening Cult]</ref><ref>[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1276839 The Heinlein - Hubbard Wager Myth]</ref>

According to ''The Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', ed. Brian Ash, Harmony Books, 1977:

:"... [Hubbard] began making statements to the effect that any writer who really wished to make money should stop writing and develop [a] religion, or devise a new psychiatric method. [[Harlan Ellison]]'s version (''Time Out'', UK, No 332) is that Hubbard is reputed to have told [[John W. Campbell|{{interpolation|John W.}} Campbell]], "I'm going to invent a religion that's going to make me a fortune. I'm tired of writing for a penny a word." [[Sam Moskowitz]], a chronicler of science fiction, has reported that he himself heard Hubbard make a similar statement, but there is no first-hand evidence".

See additional discussion in [[Scientology controversy#|The legitimacy of Scientology as a religion]].

===Ritual magic===
One controversial aspect of Hubbard's early life revolves around his association with [[Jack Parsons]], an aeronautics professor at [[Caltech]] and an associate of the British [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]]. 

Hubbard and Parsons were allegedly engaged in the practice of ritual [[magick]] in 1946, including an extended set of sex magick rituals called the [[Babalon Working]], intended to summon a goddess or "moonchild." The Church insists Hubbard was a US government intelligence agent on a mission to end Parsons' magickal activities and to "rescue" a girl Parsons was "using" for magickal purposes. <ref>[http://www.xenu-directory.org/share/19691228-uk-sundaytimes.gif Scientology: A new light on Crowley], Sunday Times, December 28, 1969 (Article starts with "Scientology has sent us the following information:")</ref>Critics dismiss these claims as after-the-fact rationalizations. Crowley recorded in his notes that he considered Hubbard a "lout" who made off with Parsons' money and girlfriend in an "ordinary confidence trick".<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 126 --><ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 98-99 -->

Confirmed is that in 1945/46 Hubbard was for several months in contact with [[Aleister Crowley]]'s Ordo Templi Orientis chapter in Los Angeles, a group headed by John W. Parsons.<ref>http://www.xenu.net/archive/lrhbare/lrhbare08.html</ref> In a 1952 lecture series, Hubbard recommended a book of Crowley's and referred to him as "Mad Old Boy"<ref>Philadephia Doctorate Lectures, '''Lecture #40 titled "Games/Goals"''', 12 December 1952: About "Limitations on self and others": ''"Old Aleister Crowley had come interesting things to say about this. He wrote a Book of the Law. He was a mad old boy! I mean, he... You'd be surprised though that Crowley, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Aristotle -- all the boys practically along the line -- they all talked about the same thing. And actually you can find all these ideas we're talking about someplace in the writings of practically any philosopher who ever thought things over. He couldn't fail to fall headlong across the most salient facts in the case. He never organized them or was able to evaluate or use them. But he had them."''</ref><ref>'''Lecture #45 titled "Development of Scientology: Characteristics of a Living Science"''', 13 December 1952: About "Life Science":''"I was sitting there tonight trying to pretend that this had been a very brace voyage of adventure because it was -- been to dangerous and there's so many men fall on their faces doing this. As a matter of fact, it has not been a very dangerous voyage. But the point is that an awful lot of men have fallen on their faces in the last century trying to hit this track. Amongst them were Nietzsche; amongst them were Aleister Crowley. They were all trying to hit this track and they were overshooting, undershooting, round and round. Because they were looking at it as it, and trying to analyze it as itself, and trying to apply to it its own peculiarities of logic and formulation and it had no such evaluation.''</ref> and as "my very good friend".<ref>L. Ron Hubbard, "Conditions of Space/Time/Energy" Philadelphia Doctorate Course cassette tape #18 5212C05</ref>. Crowley recorded in his notes that he considered Hubbard a "lout" who made off with Parsons' money and girlfriend in an "ordinary confidence trick".<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 126 --><ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 98-99 -->
Hubbard later married the girl he said that he rescued from Parsons, [[Sara Northrup]].

===Family relations===
Hubbard married [[Margaret Grubb|Margaret "Polly" Grubb]] in 1933, with whom he fathered two children, [[Ronald DeWolf|L. Ron, Jr.]] (1934 &ndash; 1991) and Katherine May (born in 1936). They lived in [[Los Angeles, California]] and, during the late 1930s, in [[Bremerton, Washington]].

In a 1983 interview, L. Ron, Jr. said "according to him and my mother" he was the result of a failed abortion and recalls at six years old seeing his father performing an abortion on his mother with a coat hanger. In the same interview, he said "Scientology is a power-and-money-and-intelligence-gathering game" and described his father as "only interested in money, sex, booze, and drugs".<ref>[http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/penthouse-LRonHubbardJr-interview-1983.htm Inside The Church of Scientology]</ref>. DeWolf retracted most of his statements in a later sworn affidavit of July 1, 1987 (Ronald E. DeWolf v. Lyle Stuart Inc.).<ref name="retractn">[http://www.freewebtown.com/luana/rondewolf-july87.pdf United States District Court, Distric of New Jersey, page 4 and 5 of affidavit of Ronald E. DeWolf of July 1, 1987, submitted in: Ronald E. DeWolf v. Lyle Stuart Inc.]</ref>

His next marriage to [[Sara Northrup]] - Parsons former girl-friend - happened in August 1946<ref>[http://misou.awardspace.us/latimes.html L.A. Times Article, 2 May 1951]</ref>.  
It was an act of [[bigamy]], as Hubbard had abandoned, but not divorced, his first wife and children as soon as he left the Navy (he divorced his first wife more than a year after he had remarried).<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 101 --> Both women allege Hubbard [[domestic violence|physically abused]] them. He is also alleged to have once kidnapped Sara's infant, Alexis, taking her to [[Cuba]]. Later, he disowned Alexis, claiming she was actually Jack Parsons' child.<ref>{{cite book | author=Miller, Russell | authorlink=Russell Miller| title=Bare-faced Messiah, The True Story of L.

[[Sara Northrup]], filed for divorce in late 1950, citing that Hubbard was, unknown to her, still married to his first wife at the time he married Sara. Her divorce papers also accused Hubbard of kidnapping their baby daughter Alexis, and of conducting "systematic torture, beatings, strangulations and scientific torture experiments."<ref>Lattin, Don.

In March 1952 L. Ron Hubbard married [[Mary Sue Hubbard]] (born Mary Sue Whipp). Mary Sue and Ron were married from March 1952 to his death on January 24, 1986, and had four children.

Hubbard had another son in 1954, [[Quentin Hubbard]], who was groomed to one day replace him as the head of the Scientology.<ref>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/atack/bs4-6.htm A Piece of Blue Sky], pp. 213-214</ref> However, Quentin was deeply depressed, allegedly because he was homosexual and his father was [[homophobic]], and wanted to leave Scientology and become a pilot.<ref>{{cite news | title = Secret Lives: L.

===International opinions===
Hubbard has been interpreted as both a savior (Scientologists refer to him as "The Friend of Mankind") and a con-artist. These sharply contrasting views have been a source of hostility between Hubbard supporters and critics. A California court judgment in 1984 involving [[Gerry Armstrong|Gerald Armstrong]], who had been assigned the task of writing Hubbard's biography, highlights the extreme opposition of the two sides. The judgment quotes a 1970's police agency of the French Government and says in part:

:"In addition to violating and abusing its own members' civil rights, the organization [Scientology] over the years with its "[[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]]" doctrine has harassed and abused those persons not in the Church whom it perceives as enemies. The organization clearly is schizophrenic and paranoid, and the bizarre combination seems to be a reflection of its founder LRH [L. Ron Hubbard]. The evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history, background, and achievements. The writings and documents in evidence additionally reflect his egoism, greed, avarice, lust for power, and vindictiveness and aggressiveness against persons perceived by him to be disloyal or hostile. At the same time it appears that he is charismatic and highly capable of motivating, organizing, controlling, manipulating, and inspiring his adherents." -- Superior Court Judge Paul Breckinridge, ''Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong,'' [[June 20]], [[1984]].<ref>[http://www.planetkc.com/sloth/sci/breck.html Breckenridge Decision]</ref>

The accuracy of Hubbard's self-representations was also addressed in court in a 1984 judgment by Justice Latey, ruling<ref>Re: B & G (Minors) (Custody), Delivered in the High Court (Family Division), London, 23 July 1984; judgement transcript available on-line via [http://holysmoke.org/cos/latey.htm HolySmoke.org] and [http://www.xenu.net/archive/audit/latey.html Xenu.net]</ref> in the [[High Court of Justice|High court]] of London, stated in his judgment that Scientology is "dangerous, immoral, sinister and corrupt" and "has its real objective money and power for Mr. Hubbard".<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 342 -->  Justice Latey also addressed Hubbard's representation of himself:

<blockquote>
... he has made these, among other false claims:
<br/>
That he was a much decorated war hero. He was not. 
<br/>
That he commanded a corvette squadron. He did not.
<br/>
That he was awarded the Purple Heart, a gallantry decoration for those wounded in action. He was not wounded and was not decorated.
<br/>
That he was crippled and blinded in the war and cured himself with Dianetic technique. He was not crippled and was not blinded.
<br/>
That he was sent by U.S. Naval Intelligence to break up a black magic ring in California. He was not. He was himself a member of that occult group and practiced ritual sexual magic in it.
<br/>
That he was a graduate of George Washington University and an atomic physicist. The facts are that he completed only one year of college and failed the one course on nuclear physics in which he enrolled.
<br/>
There is no dispute about any of this. The evidence is unchallenged.<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 339 -->
</blockquote>

Hubbard also tended to present himself as a man who was able to speak intelligently on a variety of subjects, including medicine. The 1965 [[Anderson Report]], an inquiry on Hubbard and Scientology held in Australia found:<blockquote>Hubbard is a man of restless energy, with tremendous enthusiasm in everything he undertakes. He is constantly experimenting and speculating, and equally constantly he confuses the two. He has acquired in a frenetic but superficial way a smattering Or knowledge of many subjects. In very many instances, however, his knowledge is fragmentary and inaccurate and sometimes positively incorrect, yet it serves as the foundation for pretentious and completely misleading pronouncements on scientific matters of which he is ignorant. In other instances where he has not even "enough of learning to misquote," he gives full rein to his imagination to produce incomprehensible and absurd results.

All that he writes and says is either accepted by his followers or, at the very least, it is not rejected. They are taught that they are entitled to question his pronouncements, but they are conditioned to the belief that whatever he says is right. <ref> [http://www.xenu.net/archive/audit/ar06.html] 1965 Anderson Report biography of Hubbard</ref> </blockquote> A later finding in the report addresses his claims of medical knowledge and ability by saying:<blockquote>Hubbard's claims to have found the only known cure for atomic radiation effects is not only unsubstantiated, but, in view of its obvious military value, hardly likely to have been left uninvestigated by military authorities if it was of any value whatever.<ref>[http://www.xenu.net/archive/audit/lee.html#evaluation] 1965 Anderson Report evaluation of Hubbard as a physician </ref></blockquote>

"Fair Game" was introduced by Hubbard, and incites Scientologists to use criminal behavior, deception and exploitation of the legal system to resist "[[Suppressive Person]]s", i.e. people or groups that "actively seeks to suppress or damage Scientology or a Scientologist by Suppressive Acts". He defined it "Fair Game" as:

:''ENEMY — SP Order. Fair game. May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed''.<ref>HCO POLICY LETTER OF 18 OCTOBER 1967, Issue IV [http://www.suppressiveperson.org/hate/pubs/pl-1967-10-18-penalties-lower-conditions.html]</ref>

"Fair Game" was canceled in 1968, with Hubbard stating hat "The practice of declaring people FAIR GAME will cease. FAIR GAME may not appear on any Ethics Order. It causes bad public relations. This P/L does not cancel any policy on the treatment or handling of an SP."<ref>Hubbard, HCOPL 21 October 1968, Cancellation of Fair Game</ref>

Hubbard claimed in a 1976 affidavit that Fair Game was never intended to authorise harassment, stating that: "There was never any attempt or intent on my part by the writing of these policies (or any others for that fact), to authorise illegal or harassment type acts against anyone.
As soon as it became apparent to me that the concept of 'Fair Game' as described above was being misinterpreted by the uninformed, to mean the granting of a licence to Scientologists for acts in violation of the law and/or other standards of decency, these policies were cancelled."<ref>Hubbard, affidavit of 22 March 1976, quoted in David V Barrett, The New Believers: A Survey of Sects, Cults and Alternative Religions, p. 464 (Octopus Publishing Group, 2003)</ref>

Conflicting interpretations of Hubbard's life are presented in the online version of [http://www.spaink.net/cos/rmiller/index.html ''Bare Faced Messiah''], [[Russell Miller]]'s
biography of Hubbard. This largely critical version includes links to Scientology's official accounts of Hubbard's past, embedded within Miller's description of the same history.

=== Hubbard’s drug use ===

In ''L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?'' Corydon <ref>expanded 1992 paperback edition, page 59</ref>, mentions a letter Hubbard wrote to his third wife, Mary Sue, when he was in Las Palmas around 1967. Hubbard tells his wife: "I’m drinking lots of rum and popping pinks and greys...". Corydon also says that "John McMasters told me that on the flagship ''Apollo'' in the late sixties he witnessed Hubbard's drug supply. 'It was the largest drug chest I had ever seen. He had everything!'". This was confirmed by Gerald Armstrong through Virginia Downsborough who said she was astonished that he was existing almost totally on a diet of drugs. For three weeks Hubbard was bedridden, while she weaned him off this diet."<ref>Interview with Virginia Downsborough, Santa Barbara, October 1986,[http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/apobs/contents.htm ''A Piece of Blue Sky''] copyright (c) 1990 by [[Jon Atack]], p. 171</ref>

In a different interview, she told Russell Miller <ref>in "Bare-Faced Messiah" copyright (c) 1987 by Russell Miller, p. 266</ref>: <blockquote>''We found him a hotel in Las Palmas and the next day I went back to see if he was all right, because he did not seem to be too well.  When I went in to his room, there were drugs of all kinds everywhere.  He seemed to be taking about sixty thousand different pills.  I was appalled, particularly after listening to all his tirades against drugs and the medical profession.  There was something very wrong with him...  My main concern was to try and get him off all the pills he was on and persuade him that there was still plenty for him to do.''</blockquote>

"Messiah or Madman"<ref>copyright (c) 1987, 1992 by Bent Corydon p. 59</ref> recounted the closing quote from a letter written by Hubbard to his ex wife given special attention in the Church of Scientology v. Armstrong case,<blockquote>  ''I do love you, even if I used to be an opium addict.''</blockquote>

Virginia Downsborough said that in 1967 he returned to Las Palmas totally debilitated from drugs. This having been just after he passed through the "Wall of Fire". 

In a filmed interview from 1966, L. Ron Hubbard claimed he never touched drugs in his life. Given the testimonials above, this assertion appears to be at the very least a mistake.

===Attitudes regarding race===
[[Image:China text hubbard.gif|thumb|One of Hubbard's controversial journal entries during his visit to China in 1928]]

Hubbard sometimes displayed attitudes that were at odds with the picture his followers try to present of him.  For instance, when Hubbard visited China at the age of seventeen, he made diary entries such as: "As a [[Chinaman]] can not live up to a thing, he always drags it down."<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 41 --> and "They smell of all the baths they didnt {{sic}} take. The trouble with China is, there are too many chinks here."<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!--p. 42--><ref>[http://www.spaink.net/cos/LRH-bio/chinamen.htm The problem with Chinamen], 17-year old L. Ron Hubbard, Journal entries in 1928</ref>  Similarly, Hubbard described the Lama temples as "miserably cold and very shabby . . . The people worshipping have voices like bull-frogs and beat a drum and play a brass horn to accompany their singing (?)"<ref name="Bare-faced"/><!--p. 42--> and called them "very odd and heathenish".<ref name="MBTR"/>  He also wrote about [[colored]] people: "Unlike the yellow and brown people, the white does not usually believe he can get attention from matter or objects. The yellow and brown believe for the most part ... that rocks, trees, walls, etc., can give them attention"<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron, ''Scientology: Fundamentals of Thought''. Copenhagen: New Era Publications, 1997. ISBN 1900944979, p. 24</ref> and "...so we see the African tribesman, with his complete contempt for the truth, and his emphasis on brutality and savagery..."<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron, ''Scientology: Fundamentals of Thought''. Copenhagen: New Era Publications, 1997. ISBN 1900944979, p. 77</ref>

While such attitudes might not be especially surprising for a teenager born in 1911, they are vastly at odds with the stories he would later tell and his followers would repeat: "Among other wonders, Ron told of watching monks meditate for weeks on end, contemplating higher truths ... he took advantage of this unique opportunity to study Far Eastern culture. ... he befriended and learned ... a thoroughly insightful Beijing magician who represented the last of the line of Chinese magicians from the court of Kublai Khan.  ... Old Mayo was also well versed in China’s ancient wisdom that had been handed down from generation to generation. Ron passed many evenings in the company of such wise men, eagerly absorbing their words ... he closely examined the surrounding culture. In addition to the local Tartar tribes, he spent time with nomadic bandits originally from Mongolia ... [t]hese sojourns in Asia and the Pacific islands had a profound effect, giving Ron a subjective understanding of Eastern philosophy ... the world itself was his classroom, and he studied in it voraciously, recording what he saw and learned in his ever-present diaries, which he carefully preserved for future reference."<ref name="WiS98">{{cite book | author = Compiled by staff of the Church of Scientology International | year = 1998 | title = What is Scientology? | edition=1998 | publisher = Bridge Publications, Inc. | location = Los Angeles, California | id = ISBN 1-57318-122-6}}</ref><!--p.30-32--><ref>{{cite web| url=http://lron.hubbard.org/pg003.html |title=1923-1929: On the road to discovery |work=L.

Similarly, L. Ron Hubbard expressed support for creating [[township (South Africa)|township]]s in [[South Africa]]:  "Having viewed slum clearance projects in most major cities of the world may I state that you have conceived and created in the Johannesburg townships what is probably the most impressive and adequate resettlement activity in existence."<ref>L.

==Hubbard in popular culture==
{{main|List of Scientology references in popular culture}}

L. Ron Hubbard has been depicted in novels, motion pictures, television cartoons, video games and other cultural forms.  Though Hubbard turns up in a fellow pulp author's fiction as early as 1942,<ref> Anthony Boucher's 1942 murder mystery ''Rocket to the Morgue'' features cameos by members of the "Mañana Literary Society of Southern California", in which Hubbard makes a dual appearance as D. Vance Wimpole and Rene Lafayette (one of his pen names). </ref> his fame increased greatly after the introduction of Dianetics and Scientology, and he has continued to be a popular subject since the time of his death. 

In [[Keith Giffen]]'s [[Justice League]] International, a robot appeared aptly named [[L-Ron]]. In later issues, L-Ron's full programming code, "L-Ron H*bb*rd" was revealed. L-Ron is still a minor character in the [[DC Universe]].

Hubbard was awarded the 1994 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Literature for "his crackling Good Book, ''Dianetics,'' which is highly profitable to mankind — or to a portion thereof".<ref>http://improbable.com/ig-pastwinners.html#ig1994</ref>

==Writing career==
{{main|L. Ron Hubbard bibliography|Scientology bibliography}}

Hubbard was an unusually prolific author and lecturer. Because the majority of Hubbard's writings of the 1950s through to the 1970s were aimed exclusively at Scientologists, the Church of Scientology founded its own companies to publish his works - [[Bridge Publications]] for the US and Canadian market and [[New Era Publications]], based in [[Denmark]], for the rest of the world. New volumes of his transcribed lectures continue to be produced; that series alone will ultimately total a projected 110 large volumes. Hubbard also wrote a number of works of fiction during the 1930s and 1980s, which are published by the Scientology-owned [[Galaxy Press]]. All three of these publishing companies are subordinate to [[Author Services Inc.]], another Scientology corporation.

In 2006, [[Guinness World Records]] declared Hubbard the world's most published and most translated author, having published 1,084 fiction and non-fiction works that have been translated into 71 languages.<ref>http://www.voxmagazine.com/stories/2006/12/07/guinness-gracious/ Guinness Gracious; Vox - Columbia Missourian; Sean Ludwig;
