'''''Deinonychus''''' ({{IPA2|dai.ˈna.ni.kəs}}) meaning 'terrible claw' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''δεινος'' meaning 'terrible' and ''ονυξ/ονυχος'' meaning 'claw') was a [[genus]] of 7-10&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|foot]] (2-3&nbsp;[[metre]]) long, carnivorous [[dromaeosaurid]] [[dinosaur]] from the early [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]. Its name refers to the unusually large, sickle-shaped talon on the second toe of each hind foot, which was probably held retracted while the dinosaur walked on the third and fourth toes. It was commonly thought that ''Deinonychus'' would kick with the sickle claw to slash at its prey but recent tests on reconstructions of similar ''[[Velociraptor]]'' talons suggest that the claw was used to stab, not slash.<ref>Phillip L. Manning, David Payne, John Pennicott, Paul M. Barrett, Roland A. Ennos. "Dinosaur killer claws or climbing crampons?" ''Biology Letters Online Publishing'', October 11, 2005</ref> As in other dromaeosaurids, the tail was stiffened by a series of elongated bones and bone processes. This might have given ''Deinonychus'' greater balance and turning ability, and lends it its specific name, ''D. antirrhopus'', which means 'counterbalancing'.

Paleontologist [[John Ostrom]]'s study of ''Deinonychus'' in the late 1960s revolutionised the way scientists thought about dinosaurs, igniting the debate on whether or not dinosaurs were warm-blooded. Before this, the popular conception of dinosaurs had been one of plodding, reptilian giants. Ostrom noted lightweight bones and stiffened tendons which revealed an active, agile predator.

The remains of ''Deinonychus'' have been recovered from the [[Cloverly Formation]] of [[Montana]] in Western [[North America]]. Other dinosaurs it shared its world with include herbivorous dinosaurs including the armoured ''[[Sauropelta]]'' and two ornithopods: the smaller ''[[Zephyrosaurus]]'' and the larger ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Teeth discovered associated with ''Tenontosaurus'' specimens, imply it was hunted or at least scavenged upon by ''Deinonychus''. 

==Description==
Based on the largest known specimens, ''Deinonychus'' had a maximum skull length of 410&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]] (16.4&nbsp;[[inch|in]]), a hip height of 1.2&nbsp;m (4&nbsp;ft), a maximum weight of 80&nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]] (175&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]]), and a maximum length of 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft). Its skull was equipped with powerful jaws lined with around sixty curved, blade-like teeth. Based on studies of the skull, the eyes faced mainly to the side. Both the skull and the lower jaw had [[fenestra]]e (skull openings) which reduced the weight of the skull. In ''Deinonychus'', the [[antorbital fenestra]], a skull opening between the eye and nostril, was particularly large.

Like all dromaeosaurs, ''Deinonychus'' possessed large 'hands' with three claws on each forelimb. The first digit was shortest and the second longest. Each hind foot bore a sickle-shaped claw, which was probably used during predation. ''Deinonychus'' could swivel the toe forward and down in a slashing arc to stab or tear at its prey. These claws were unusually large for the body size of ''Deinonychus''. ''Deinonychus'' had a tail which was highly stiffened primarily by extensions of the tail [[vertebra]]e and [[chevron]]s, allowing stability and balance while turning at high speeds.

==History of discovery==
[[Image:Deinonychus_skeleton_FMNH.jpg|left|thumb|''Deinonychus'' skeleton.]]
The fossilized remains of ''Deinonychus'' were first discovered by a team led by paleontologist [[Barnum Brown]] in 1931, in the [[Cloverly Formation]] of southern [[Montana]], near the town of [[Bridger, Montana|Bridger]]. Brown was primarily concerned with excavating and preparing the remains of the [[ornithopod]] dinosaur ''[[Tenontosaurus]]'', but in his 1931 field report from the dig site to the [[American Museum of Natural History]], he reported the discovery of a small carnivorous dinosaur close to a ''Tenontosaurus'' skeleton, "but encased in lime difficult to prepare."<ref name="grellet-tinner&makovicky2006">Grellet-Tinner, G., and Makovicky, P. (2006). "A possible egg of the dromaeosaur ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'': phylogenetic and biological implications." ''Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences'', '''43''': 705-719.</ref> He informally named the animal "Daptosaurus" and made preparations for describing this animal and having the skeleton put on display, but did not finish this work.<ref name=NGD95a>{{cite book |last=Norell |first=Mark A |coauthors=Gaffney, Eugene S.; and Dingus, Lowell |title=Discovering Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |year=1995 |pages=130 |isbn=0-679-43386-4}}</ref>  Interestingly, Brown had another skeleton from a small Cloverly theropod, of a smaller animal with seemingly oversized teeth.  This he informally named "Megadontosaurus".  [[John Ostrom]], reviewing the material decades later, realized that the teeth came from ''Deinonychus'', but the skeleton came from a completely different animal.  He named this skeleton ''[[Microvenator]]''.<ref name=NGD95b>{{cite book |last=Norell |first=Mark A |coauthors=Gaffney, Eugene S.; and Dingus, Lowell |title=Discovering Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |year=1995 |pages=126-127 |isbn=0-679-43386-4}}</ref>  

Nearly forty years later, in August of 1964, paleontologists John Ostrom and Grant E. Meyer prepared and studied Brown's small carnivore in detail, and published it in 1969 with the name ''Deinonychus antirrhopus''.<ref name="ostrom1969">Ostrom, J. H. (1969) "Osteology of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'', an unusual theropod from the Lower Cretaceous of Montana." ''Peabody Museum of Natural History Bulletin'', '''30''': 1-165.</ref> Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1000 bones representing between them at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine for certain, the [[Type (zoology)|type]] specimen of ''Deinonychus'' was restricted only to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in 50 separate entries at [[Yale University|Yale]]'s [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]]. 

A skeleton of ''Deinonychus'' including bones from the original (and most complete) specimen can be seen on display at the American Museum of Natural History, with another specimen on display at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. The American Museum and Harvard specimens are from a different locality than the Yale specimens.

===Possible egg===
Following Ostrom's description of the original specimen uncovered by Brown, several small blocks of lime-encased material remained unprepared in storage at the American Museum. These consisted mostly of isolated bones and bone fragments, including the original matrix, or surrounding rock in which the specimens were initially buried. An examination of these unprepared blocks by Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky in 2000 revealed an interesting, overlooked feature. Several long, thin bones identified on the blocks as ossified tendons (structures which helped stiffen the tail of ''Deinonychus'') turned out to actually represent ''gastralia'', or "belly ribs". More significantly, a large number of previously unnoticed fossilized eggshells were discovered in the rock matrix which had surrounded the original ''Deinonychus'' specimen.<ref name="makovicky&grellet-tinner2000">Makovicky, P.J., and Grellet-Tinner, G. (2000). "Association between a specimen of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'' and theropod eggshell." In Bravo, A.M. and T. Reyes (eds.) ''1st international symposium on dinosaur eggs and babies'', pp. 123–128. Isona i Conca Dellà Catalonia, Spain, 23–26 September 1999.</ref> In a subsequent, more detailed report on the egg shells, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky concluded that the egg almost certainly belonged to ''Deinonychus'', representing the first dromaeosaurid egg to be identified.<ref name="grellet-tinner&makovicky2006"/>

===Implications===
The description in 1969 by Ostrom of ''Deinonychus'' has been described as the most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid 20th century;<ref name = "FasWeis04">{{cite book|title=The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs (2nd Edition)|year=2005|chapter=Theropoda I:Nature Red in Tooth and Claw|editor=Fastovsky DE, Weishampel DB|author=Fastovsky DE, Weishampel DB|pages=265&ndash;299|publisher=Cambridge University Press|id=ISBN 0-521-81172-4}}</ref>  the discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and open the door to speculation that dinosaurs may have been [[warm-blooded]]. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the 'hand' of ''Deinonychus'' and that of birds, which observation led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs.<ref name="ostrom1976b">Ostrom, J. H. (1976b) "''Archaeopteryx'' and the origin of birds." ''Biological Journal of the Linnean Society'', '''8''': 91-182.</ref> Thirty years later, this idea is almost universally accepted. In fact, ''Deinonychus'' and other [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]]  are so birdlike that there has been debate whether they are in fact true birds.

The discoveries of closely related dinosaurs from China, ''[[Sinornithosaurus]]'' and ''[[Microraptor]]'', bearing the remains of feather-like structures indicate that this dinosaur may have borne feathers.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Xu, X., Wang, X.L., and Wu, X.C. | date = [[16 September]] [[1999]] | title = A dromaeosaurid dinosaur with a filamentous integument from the Yixian Formation of China | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v401/n6750/abs/401262a0_fs.html | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 401 | pages = 262–266 }} ([http://www.geocities.com/earthhistory/fd.htm abstract], {{doi|10.1038/45769}})</ref> The features of these two dinosaurs suggest they were more primitive than ''Deinonychus'' on the Dromaeosaurid evolutionary tree which, coupled with their greater age (both dinosaurs predate ''Deinonychus'' by around ten million years) strongly suggest that ''Deinonychus'' may too have been feathered.<ref name ="dinosauria04"/>

==Paleobiology==
[[Image:Deinonychus-antirrhopus jconway.jpg|right|thumb|Life restoration of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus''. Plumage based on related species.]]
Geological evidence suggests that ''Deinonychus'' was found in a flood-plain or swamplike habitat.<ref name ="dinosauria04"/>
===Predatory behavior===
Based on the association of a number of ''Deinonychus'' skeletons in a single quarry, and and the fact that shed teeth of ''Deinonychus'' have been found along side skeletons of the [[ornithopod]] dinosaur ''[[Tenontosaurus]]'', indicating that ''Deinonychus'' fed on that species, and perhaps hunted it. Ostrom and Maxwell have even used this information to speculate that ''Deinonychus'' might have lived and hunted in packs.<ref name="maxwell&ostrom1995">Maxwell, W.D., and Ostrom, J.H. (1995). "Taphonomy and paleobiological implications of ''Tenontosaurus''-''Deinonychus'' associations." ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'', '''15'''(4): 707-712.</ref>

Despite being the most distinctive feature of ''Deinonychus'', the shape and curvature of the sickle-claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes.<ref name="ostrom1976">Ostrom, J. H. (1976a) "On a new specimen of the Lower Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Deinonychus antirrhopus''." ''Breviora'', '''439''': 1-21.</ref> Ostrom suggested that this difference in the size and shape of the sickle claws could be due to individual variation, sexual variation, or age-related variation.

===Speed===
Dromaeosaurids, especially ''Deinonychus'', are often depicted as unusually fast-running animals in the popular media, and Ostrom himself speculated that ''Deinonychus'' was fleet-footed in his original description.<ref name="ostrom1969"/> However, when first described, a complete leg of ''Deinonychus'' had not been found, and Ostrom's speculation about the length of the femur (upper leg bone) later proved to have been an overestimate. In a later study, Ostrom noted that the ratio of the femur to the tibia (lower leg bone) is not as important in determining speed as the relative length of the foot and lower leg. In modern, fleet-footed birds like the [[ostrich]], the foot-tibia ratio is .95. In unusually fast-running dinosaurs like ''[[Struthiomimus]]'', the ratio is .68, and in ''Deinonychus'', the ratio is a surprisingly low .48.<ref name="ostrom1976"/> Ostrom stated that the "only reasonable conclusion" is that ''Deinonychus'' was not particularly fast compared to other dinosaurs, and certainly not as fast as modern flightless birds.

The low foot to lower leg ratio in ''Deinonychus'' is due partly to an unusually short metatarsus (upper foot bones). The metatarsus of smaller individuals, while still short, are longer than those in larger individuals. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus may be related to the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features--the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.--as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the ''Deinonychus'' leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles were used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of ''Deinonychus'' represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.<ref name="ostrom1976"/>

===Reproduction===
The identification in 2000 of probable ''Deinonychus'' eggs associated with one of the original specimens allowed comparison with other theropod dinosaurs in terms of egg structure, nesting, and reproduction. In their 2006 examination of the specimen, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky examined the possibility that the dromaeosaurid had been feeding on the egg, or that the egg fragments had been associated with the ''Deinonychus'' skeleton by coincidence. They dismissed the idea that the egg had been a meal for the theropod, noting that the fragments were sandwiched between the belly ribs and forelimb bones, making it impossible that they represented contents of the animals stomach. In addition, the manner in which the egg had been crushed and fragmented indicated that it had been intact at the time of burial, and was broken by the fossilization process. The idea that the egg was randomly associated with the dinosaur were also found to be unlikely. The bones surrounding the egg had not been scattered or disarticulated, but remained fairly intact relative to their positions in life, indicating that the area around and including the egg was not disturbed during preservation. The fact that these bones were belly ribs (gastralia), which are very rarely found articulated, supported this interpretation. All the evidence, according to Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky, indicates that the egg was intact beneath the body of the ''Deinonychus'' when it was buried. It is possible that this represents brooding or nesting behavior in ''Deinonychus'' similar to that seen in the related [[troodontid]]s and [[oviraptorid]]s, or that the egg was in fact inside the [[oviduct]] when the animal died.<ref name="grellet-tinner&makovicky2006"/>

Examination of the ''Deinonychus'' eggs microstructure confirms that it belonged to a theropod, since it shares characteristics with other known theropod eggs and shows dissimilarities with [[ornithischia]]n and [[sauropod]] eggs. Compared to other [[maniraptora]]n theropods, the egg of ''Deinonychus'' is more similar to those of [[oviraptorid]]s than to those of [[troodontid]]s, despite studies which show the later are more closely related to dromaeosaurids like ''Deinonychus''. While the egg was too badly crushed to accurately determine its size, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky estimated a diameter of about 7 cm (2.7 in) based on the width of the pelvic canal through which the egg had to have passed. This size is similar to the 7.2 cm diameter of the largest ''[[Citipati]]'' (an oviraptorid) eggs--''Citipati'' and ''Deinonychus'' also shared the same overall body size, supporting this estimate. Additionally, the thicknesses of ''Citipati'' and ''Deinonychus'' eggshells are almost identical, and since shell thickness correlates with the volume of the egg, this further supports the idea that the eggs of these two animals were almost exactly the same size.<ref name="grellet-tinner&makovicky2006"/>

== In popular culture ==
[[Image:Velociraptor222.jpg|right|150px|thumb|The ''Velociraptor'' from the movie ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' were actually modeled on ''Deinonychus''.]]
While ''Deinonychus'' itself never appeared in any of the ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' books or films, the supposed ''[[Velociraptor]]'' in the films actually more closely resemble ''Deinonychus'' in size and shape. This was because [[Gregory S. Paul]], in his book ''Predatory Dinosaurs of the World'', concluded that ''Deinonychus'' was a species of ''Velociraptor'' and rechristened the species ''Velociraptor antirrhopus'', a theory that has since been largely rejected. [[Michael Crichton]] continued to [[synonymy|synonymize]] the two genera in his novels, on which the first two films were based. The depiction of ''Deinonychus'' in the original ''Jurassic Park'' film, while accurate for its time, is now known to have been inaccurate in many respects, including the lack of [[Feathered dinosaurs|feathers]] (though the sequels began to address this last oversight, most notably ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'').

''Deinonychus'' also played a major role in the TV series [[Dino-riders]], and were incorporated into the series one toy line. These figures where deemed so accurate at the time, the Smithsonian Institution re-released the figures as part of their own toy line in 1990.
