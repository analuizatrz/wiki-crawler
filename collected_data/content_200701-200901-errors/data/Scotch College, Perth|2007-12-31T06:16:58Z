'''Scotch College''', informally known as '''Scotch''' or '''SC''', is an [[independent school]] for boys, situated in [[Swanbourne, Western Australia|Swanbourne]], [[Western Australia]], [[Australia]]. The school is a member of the [[Public Schools Association]] (PSA) and is now a [[Uniting Church]] school, although it was founded in 1897 by the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]]. The school has undertaken the [[International Baccalaureate]]'s [[IB Primary Years Programme|Primary Years]] and [[MYP|Middle Years]] programmes since 2003.

Scotch has a large [[campus]] in [[Swanbourne, Western Australia|Swanbourne]] and an outdoor education centre in [[Dwellingup, Western Australia|Dwellingup]]. The campus in [[Swanbourne, Western Australia|Swanbourne]] consists of a [[high school]] for years 8-12, a [[Primary education|junior school]] for Pre-Primary to Grade 7, sports grounds, and [[boarding house|boarding facilities]] for 140 students.<ref name=seniorschool />

==History==
===Foundation===
[[Image:Rev. David Ross.JPG|thumb|200x200px|left|Rev. David Ross, a founder of Scotch College]]
Scotch College owes its foundations to a conversation at an 1896 dinner party, where the one of the parents of a 12-year-old boy, Mrs. Jane Alexander, wife of Hon. William Alexander, [[Western Australian Legislative Council|MLC]], complained that there was an absence of a Presbyterian school for boys in Perth.<ref name=JennyBookpg1>{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Jenny |editor=Amanda Curtin |title=Building a Tradition, A History of Scotch College, Perth 1897 &ndash; 1996 |origdate=1996 |origyear=1996 |edition=First |year=1996 |publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] Press |location=[[Nedlands, Western Australia]] |language=English |id=ISBN 1-875560-89-0, ISBN 1-875560-93-9 (deluxe) |pages=1 |chapter=1, Founding the Alexander Scotch College 1897 &ndash; 1904}}</ref> She offered Rev. David Ross, moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Western Australia, [[Pound sterling|£]]500 to establish Scotch College.<ref name=JennyBookpg1 /> The announcement of the college came on Monday [[January 4]], [[1897]], in the form of an advertisement.<ref name=JennyBookpg10>Gregory, page 10</ref> The advertisement included the first location of the school, Shearer Memorial Hall, which is now the [[Perth Trades Hall]].<ref name=JennyBookpg10 /> When founded, the school was originally named '''The Alexander Scotch College'''.<ref name=JennyBookpg10 /> The school would later shorten its name to Scotch College in 1908 for banking purposes.<ref>Gregory, page 4</ref>

In 1905, the college became a founding school of the Public Schools Association, showing it to be by that time a well-regarded independent school, and entitling it to take part in the most competitive schoolboy sporting competition in Western Australia.

===World War One to World War Two===
[[Image:Alexander Scotch College 1904.JPEG|300px|thumb|right|Alexander Scotch College 1904]]
During [[World War I]], 475 boys enlisted to defend the empire as part of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied forces]]. This number represented over 50% of all Scotch alumni at the time.<ref>Gregory, page 126</ref> A roll of honour is present in Collegians House, the administration building, featuring the names of all past Scotch College students who had volunteered to fight.

In 1939, the Head Masters' Conference approached the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance due to low staff salaries, the standard of the school's science facilities and the lack of money the school possessed. When gifts of money to the school became tax-deductible in 1954 (provided donations were for the purpose of either repaying debt on buildings or helping to fund new building projects), people found they had more incentive to donate to schools. This led to Scotch, among other schools around Australia, beginning fund-raising appeals within the school community.<ref name=Gregory-Building>Gregory, Jenny (1996). ''Building a Tradition, A History of Scotch College, 1897-1996'' [[University of Western Australia]] Press ISBN 1-875560-89-0</ref>

===Post War===
Even before donations were made tax-deductible, an appeal to fund an old-boys memorial for those who served in [[World War II]] raised £9,000 by 1950. When the school's council, the town in which Scotch resides in, inquired about the cost for a memorial hall to sit 650 people, they were shocked to discover it would cost around £30,000. A [[Fair|fete]] organised in 1953 raised £2,500. Another fete was arranged and appeals to both old-boys and parents increased the total raised to £17,500. Despite lack of funds, David Brisbane, a council member since 1945, laid the foundation stone for the hall in early 1957. Although donations to schools over £1 had been tax-deductible since 1954, it was not until January 1957 that the Taxation Department informed the school that all donations towards the new Scotch College Building Fund would be tax-deductible. The appeal committee launched a major appeal raising £23,000 for the Memorial Hall.<ref name=Gregory-Building />

The Memorial Hall was opened by Sir [[Charles Gairdner]], [[Governor of Western Australia]] at the time, on October 19, 1957, the same year as the school's [[Diamond Jubilee]]. The opening led to a further £30,000 in promised donations, although the actual amount received was below this figure. Eventually the cost of the hall led to the school having to be provided a £25,000 overdraft from the [[ASB Bank]]; this led to an increase in school fees. The total cost of the Memorial Hall was £48,864 and the appeal raised £45,700. Gordon Gooch, who has a sports pavilion at the school named after him, met the shortfall.<ref name=Gregory-Building />

===1970 to 1990===
In 1971, after observing the [[May 1968|May 1968 French riots]], a group of year 12 boys organised a "schoolboy strike" on the regulations of hair length, after the issue had been simmering for several months. The strike involved 60 boys refusing to return to class after the lunch bell, despite threat of expulsion, which led the headmaster to arrange an assembly for all boys after losing his temper. The ringleader of the strike, Cary Kallis informed the [[Nine Network]] newsroom to announce the strike. However, Kallis informed several students which led to news of the strike quickly spreading around the school. After being threatened by a teacher with expulsion, Kallis quickly called Channel 9 again, pretending to be a teacher, by say "The strike has been cancelled and the boys have been disciplined". As mentioned above, the strike still went ahead.<ref name=Gregory-Building />

[[Image:Retouched Collegian's House.JPG|thumb|250px|Collegians House, the administration building.]]

In 1984, Scotch acquired ''Moray'', the school's new outdoor education centre where students would be able to attend camps. This was purchased after the school had considered, for over a decade, the possibility of acquiring a site for a school camp. The Parents' Association gave support to the project and the school purchased the {{convert|164|acre|sqkm|sing=on}} property through a mortgagee sale for $220,000. It was named [[Moray]] after a province in [[Scotland]] where Clan Murray originated (the Moray camp site is adjacent to the [[Murray River (Western Australia)|Murray River]]).<ref name=Gregory-Building />

The Scotch College foundation was established in 1986 when Judge Robert Keall was chairman of the college. The foundation raised $1.1 million within six months to partly fund a new Physical Education Centre. Robert Keall opened the $2.25 million centre on [[March 29]], [[1988]].<ref name=Gregory-Building />

===Recent Years===
The school recently announced plans to construct a new hall for assemblies and other functions. This joins other new plans such as the redesign of the Arts and Technology classrooms and a new sporting oval. Building started in March 2006 and is scheduled to finish in 2007. The main new building will be a new hall, named the Dickinson Centre, after Scotch's previous headmaster, the late WR Dickinson. On [[February 20]], 2006, Headmaster Rev. Andrew Syme, announced that college was in negotiation with a builder about the final price. Construction started on Friday [[March 3]], 2006, which was the first day of the Labour long weekend.<ref>[http://www.scotch.wa.edu.au/newsite/public_html/content/NewsandNotices/HeadmasterNewsletter/2006/No2/HMNewsFeb2.htm Headmaster's Newsletter February 20 2006]. Retrieved 20 February 2006.</ref>

Over the Labour long weekend the college hosted the [[Golden Pride Children's Choir]]<ref>[http://www.goldenpridechoir.org/ Golden Pride Children's Choir website]. Retrieved 6 March 2006.</ref> from [[Tanzania]] in the boarding house and on [[March 7]], 2006, the choir performed to the year 10s and several other classes. The Choir continued to perform at [[WOMADelaide]] and then at the [[2006 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games Cultural Festival]].

A memorial service was held for the late WR Dickinson, the 5th headmaster of Scotch College, at 3pm on Wednesday the 10th of May, 2006. A pavilion was erected on the Scotch playing fields, and the School and Pipe Band formed a guard of honour for the Dickinson family members and the funeral cortege as they arrived.<ref>[http://www.scotch.wa.edu.au/newsite/public_html/content/NewsandNotices/HeadmasterNewsletter/2006/No6/HMNewsMay8.htm Headmaster's Newsletter May 8 2006].

{{rquote|right|Unfortunately, this year I have heard stories of boys lying to parents about the social events that are occurring; of parents' houses being trashed; alcohol and drugs being accessed; of gangs (from beyond the school) attacking boys; and of sexual behaviour that would be of concern to all parents| Headmaster Reverend Andrew Syme in the letter he sent to parents<ref name="Stripper1">{{cite news | first=Paige | last=Taylor | title=Principal acts after stripper story | url=http://www.news.com.au/sundaytelegraph/story/0,,20617377-5005941,00.html/ | work=Sunday Telegraph | publisher=News.com.au | date=[[2006-10-21]] | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>}}
[[Image:Scotch College The West.PNG|left|thumb|The headline of the [[2006-10-21]] edition of ''The West Australian''.]]
On [[21 October]] [[2006]], both ''[[The West Australian]]'', Perth's largest newspaper, and ''[[The Australian]]'' reported that the school's Headmaster, Reverend Andrew Syme, had called a meeting of "critical importance" to discuss recent events Year 11 students were involved in with parents.<ref name="Stripper1" /><ref>{{cite news | first=Bethany | last=Hiatt | title=Schools warn on sex, booze parties | url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=77&ContentID=10626 | work=The West Australian | date=[[2006-10-21]] | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> Events linked to boys from the school include Year 11 and 12 boys in the First XV rugby team hiring a stripper known to use vegetables in her act, "sex romps" after consuming alcohol and weekend use of recreational drugs.<ref name="Stripper1" /> Syme made clear his intention to meet with headmasters of other Perth private schools in an attempt to cut down on events which bring about bad publicity.<ref name="Stripper1" /> Syme told newspapers he was angry about boys in the rugby wind-up hiring a stripper.<ref name="Stripper1" />
{{wikinewsart|Headmaster to meet parents after student sex parties}} 

The meeting was held, with the Year 11 parents, on October 31 in the school's library, the BRC (Bunning Resource Centre).<ref>{{cite news | title=Scotch College head warns: Teen sex, drugs crisis | url=http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20061021/news/003.shtml | work= Post Newspapers Pty Ltd | date=[[2006-10-21]] | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>

On [[23 October]], the first Monday after the headlines, it was revealed by Trudi Cooper, an [[Edith Cowan University]] lecturer in youth work, that claims sexual activity and use of [[Recreational drug use|illicit drugs]] increasing in recent years are untrue. Cooper has announced that there are routine studies on sexual activity and drug usage by teens. Since the 1980s there has been no abrupt change.<ref>{{cite news | first=Sam | last=Riley | title=Parents ‘must act on sex parties’ | url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=77&ContentID=10738 | work= The West Australian | date=[[2006-10-23]] | accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref>

==Curriculum==
Scotch offers a wide range of subjects in its academic curriculum. All students in years 8-10 study one language other than English — either [[French language|French]] or [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] — through the International Baccalaureate's [[MYP|Middle Years Programme]] (MYP). The MYP also requires students in years 9 and 10 to do a year-long personal project. For this project, boys can choose a topic of their choice, provided that the topic relates to the [[List of Areas of Interaction|Areas of Interaction]].

Scotch awards several scholarships based on academic merit to students, but under agreed PSA rules no member schools may award sports scholarships. Entrance scholarships at Scotch are based on the results of scholarship [[examinations]]. In year 11 there is a scholarship open to sons of former alumni (P.C. Anderson Memorial Old Boy's Scholarship). To be considered boys must have several references and nominations from the staff and are required to sit an interview and submit a copy of their resume.

The Gordon Gooch Entrance Scholarship can be sat by any boy entering year 8. The John A. Gooch Scholarship is similar to the Gordon Gooch Entrance Scholarship, but participation is only open to boys entering the senior school via the junior school.

Students entering year 8 in 2006 are eligible for one of several music scholarships. Students entering will need to be playing at a high level as the scholarship is selected through auditions. It also takes into account the results of his most recent music examination. This includes the results in both the theory and practical section.

===Middle school structure===
In 2003, the school changed the years 8 through to 10 learning structure after the school became an International Baccalaureate certified school. Students in these years study two languages, a [[mathematics|math]], a [[science]], an arts, a technology, a humanities and [[Physical Education]] subject.
[[Image:DSC00066.JPG|thumb|220px|Boys working in the Media Studio]]

Students in Years 9 and 10 have the option of choosing which [[technology]] and [[Visual arts|arts]] classes they take for either the year or semester. There are two art classes; 2D and 3D art. The former comprises drawing and painting; the latter, pottery and other sculpture art. Drama is another class identified as an art by the MYP, and students learn many techniques, including improvisation and comedy. Music is also an art class and students can create their own music on computer programs like Super Duper Music Looper.

For technology classes there are several options. In metal work, boys will build many different metallic objects, including [[cricket]] stumps. Wood work has boys making objects out of wood. In recent years boys have made tiny [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub >2</sub >]] powered [[drag racing|dragsters]]. The 'understanding technology' class is popular, as students create electronics and dancing robots. In recent years, the technology department has talked about wanting students to create a [[solar power]]ed car. The main reason this has not been undertaken is because of cost. Information Systems and [[3D computer graphics|3D modelling]] are two different subjects. Boys are taught in the [[computer]] lab and use the computers to create architectural designs and databases.

In year 10, students have the option of doing media studies and/or business and enterprise. Media studies has boys create their own movie and critically analyse feature films in the form of essays. In business and enterprise, students will create their own share portfolio on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] website. This is an imaginary game however and no real money is involved.

In years 9 and 10, boys do a personal project, as part of their [[MYP]] education. This starts midway through year 9 and finishes a year later, midway through year 10. One year, a boy raised over $100,000 for his personal project and donated it to the local [[Women's shelter|women's refuge]]. However, parents and boys have been very critical of the personal project as boys are required to hold meetings discussing their progress during class time. They are also critical of the fact that only the [[essay]] at the end of the project is marked, not the project itself.

A similar structure was introduced to the junior school when they joined the IB [[Primary Years Programme]], becoming the only school in the [[Western Australia]] certified to teach the programme.

===Senior school curriculum===
As Scotch does not offer the [[IB Diploma Programme]] to senior students, students in Years 11 and 12 have the option of undertaking either [[Tertiary Entrance Exam]] subjects or wholly School-assessed subjects; students select these subjects in Year 10. Many choose to sit the [[Tertiary Entrance Exam]] so they can attend university to further their education. The top student for each subject is awarded a prize on speech night, and the Year 12 student who finishes top of their year is awarded ''Dux''.

Every two years, the school has a tour to France for French language students in Years 11 and 12. These tours run for around two weeks and allow boys to stay with a French family, giving them the chance to experience native French.

Scotch students have been consistently gaining high marks in their TEE exams. This was continued in 2004 with two students awarded [[General Exhibitions]] as well as three boys receiving [[Certificates of Distinction]]. A further eleven boys were awarded [[Certificates of Excellence]]. A total of ten Scotch boys were given [[Tertiary Entrance Rank]]s (TERs) of 99 or above and 29 boys received TERs of 95 or above.<ref>Scotch College (2004). ''Reporter 2004''</ref>

In 2005, Scotch graduate Adrian Khoo received the [[Beazley Medal]], which is awarded to the top student in the state, for his TEE results. As in 2004, two students were awarded [[General Exhibitions]]. [[Subject Exhibitions]] were awarded to three students for 5 overall subjects. Eleven boys received [[Certificates of Excellence]] and six boys were awarded [[Certificates of Distinction]] for 11 subjects overall. A total of nine TERs above 99 were received while 30 boys received a TER of 95 or higher.<ref>Scotch College (2005). ''Reporter 2005''</ref>

===Novell computer system===
[[Image:SC Intranet Portal.JPG|thumb|220px|right|A screenshot of the portal]]
Scotch College has not followed the trend among other Australian independent schools of making laptops compulsory for students. The school has an intranet which is available on any computer with internet access; the login page is located on the Scotch website. Students are able to use email, store files and view assignments using the intranet, as each student and teacher has their own individual account to access the intranet site. 

Over the 2005-06 summer vacation, the intranet was upgraded. The upgrade included changing the layout of the intranet to a more visually [[aesthetic]] design and making page links more prominent on the page. The school email system, was also upgraded during the same period. Like the intranet, the email system is now also more aesthetic to the eye. Teachers also have their own email and intranet accounts. The system is sometimes referred to as the "portal".

==Scotch student life==
Scotch offers a comprehensive extra-curricular activities program for students. The school also has boarding facilities for students who live in rural areas of [[Western Australia]], as well as international students. The major components of the program are sport, music and the Arts. Students in years 10-12 may participate in [[Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia|FESA Cadet]] programs.

===Boarding===
All boarding students are members of Keys House, one of the ten houses at Scotch. All of the boarders live in residential houses, including the new Keys House block, which was finished in 2001, with their house head, who lives on site. Boarders' meals are served in the Dining hall, which is in close proximity to all boarding facilities. Boarders also have 24 hour access to medical services. In 2006, international students were required to pay an extra $5,700 in lieu of ''Government Subsidies and extra administration costs''.<ref>[http://www.scotch.wa.edu.au/newsite/public_html/index.php?content=AboutScotch&page=Boarding/boarding.htm#keys Scotch College Boarding information]. Retrieved 30 January 2006.</ref>

On weekends boarders will often do a variety of activities that staff arrange. They also use the nearby [[Indian Ocean]] as well as [[Challenge Stadium]] and [[Subiaco Oval]]. Boarders in years 10, 11 and 12 will also participate in sport on a Saturday morning.

A boarding tradition at Scotch is walking the entire [[Bibbulmun Track]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/southcoast/stories/s1434733.htm An [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] article about the Bibbulmun Track]. Retrieved 31 January 2006.</ref> Boys walk sections of the track each year. This is not a compulsory event, however. In 2005, the year 12 boarders gave a presentation about the walk. The Archbishop of Perth was present and gave a memorable speech.

===Moray===
In the junior school and years 8 and 9 in the senior school, students will camp for several days, depending on their age, at Moray near [[Dwellingup, Western Australia|Dwellingup]]. Moray, close to the [[Murray River (Western Australia)|Murray River]], is set in Australian bush. Moray allows students to camp either outside, under swags, or inside cabins. Students here will learn about safety, the ecosystems and how native Aborigines lived in the area. They will also learn how to be more independent by cooking their own food and setting up their own swag. Students will also do activities on the Murray River such as kayaking or canoeing, climbing an outdoor rock wall, climbing a telephone pole, and doing a suspended ropes course.

The Cadets also use Moray for a weekend camp. The cadets do activities designed to improve self confidence like the rock wall or the [[leap of faith]] were cadets jump from a telephone pole and try and grab a plastic wire. They are suspended from falling using a wire. One night over the weekend the cadets do a "night stalker" game where the senior cadets try and prevent the junior cadets from reaching a certain point. The seniors use torches to try and identify cadets.

===House system===
The pastoral care system is based on a House structure which deals with all matters relating to a student's well-being or curriculum needs. Each student is placed in a House Tutorial Group that is overseen by a House Tutor for each of the 10 Houses. Most House Tutorial Groups have three students from each year level in that house. A House contains students from Years 8 to 12. Each House is led by one Head of House. The members of each House are led by House Captains and Co-Vice Captains. The Houses meet on a regular basis.

The House Tutor and Heads of House work as a team to monitor the academic and personal progress of each student in the House Tutorial Group and House. Generally, the House Tutor is the first and main point of contact between the parent and the School. For more serious issues a Head of House is usually contacted.

Students are either put in a randomly selected house or into the house of any [[alumni]] they are related to. Houses compete against each other in sports such as inter-house athletics and academic contests like [[debating]]. Students march to assembly on Friday mornings in their house and are marked on their performance by the cadets. 

The house that wins the most points over all inter-house competitions is awarded the staff trophy. This includes the larger inter-house events like athletics, cross-country and swimming as well as some smaller competitions like [[lightning chess]] and [[indoor soccer]].

For Year 8 and 9 Students in winter, they also have Middle School house games, in which a house can participate in 3 out of the 4 possible choices of Hockey, Football, Soccer and Touch Rugby, this usually takes place in weeks where there are byes in the Public Schools Association (PSA) sports competition. Due to the large size of Keys House, for MS games they are separated into Keys 1 and Keys 2, in order for everyone to compete.

===Sport===
Scotch College teams regularly compete in the [[Public Schools Association|PSA]] sports competitions. The students of the college play or compete in association football, athletics, Australian rules football, badminton, basketball, chess, cricket, cross country, golf, field hockey, rowing (see [[Head of the River (Australia)|Head of the River]]), rugby union, sailing, surfing, swimming, tennis, water polo and volleyball.
[[Image:IMGP2677Goochy.JPG|thumb|220px|The Gooch Pavilion on the sports fields.]]

In 2004, Scotch won two premierships for [[Public Schools Association|PSA]] competition, in [[PSA Hockey|hockey]] (co-Premiers) and in surfing. 2005 was a unsuccessful year for the college in [[Sport in the Public Schools Association|PSA sport]] winning only the [[PSA Hockey|hockey]] competition. The school managed three runner-up positions however in [[Darlot Cup (Australia)|cricket]], [[PSA Rugby|rugby union]] and [[PSA Tennis|tennis]].<ref>Scotch College (2005). ''Reporter 2005''</ref>

Sport is compulsory for all students in the high school; teams usually train twice a week. Matches are held on a Thursday for the junior school, Friday for years 8 and 9, and Saturday for years 10 to 12. 

Occasionally, tours are arranged for sports teams. Recent tours included the Australian rules football team visiting [[Melbourne]], and a hockey tour of [[South Africa]]. The most recent tour was the rugby union tour of [[France]] in April of 2006.
Athletics, cross country and swimming are all major inter-house games and almost every student competes.

===Arts===
Scotch offers students an opportunity to participate in the annual school production. Recent productions include ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'', ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[Blood Brothers]]'' and ''[[Holes]]''.

Street dance is another extra-curricular activity being offered at Scotch. It is an urban-based dance program in which students choreograph dance routines and perform them in concerts. The school regularly competes at the annual ACHPER dance festival, and has performed well in this festival in recent years, leading to an invitation to participate in the more prestigious ACHPER Gala Night.

Scotch has two poetry prizes awarded each year; the Raven Senior Poetry Prize for Years 11 and 12 and the Raven Junior Poetry Prize for Years 8, 9 and 10. The winning piece along with several other pieces of student poetry and art are published in the annual school publication, ''The Reporter''. Raven prize winners are presented an awarded on speech night. There are also two annual prose prizes; the Raven Senior Prose Prize and the Raven Junior Prose Prize. Like the poetry prizes, the winning pieces are published in ''The Reporter'' and the writer presented with an award on speech night.

===Music===
[[Image:SC Pipe Band pose.jpg|thumb|220px|left|The Pipe Band at [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]]]]
Scotch gives students the chance to learn [[Musical instrument|instruments]] during class time in the senior school. Students may also join the [[pipe band]] if their playing skills and marching skills are of a high standard. The pipe band [[traditionally]] lead the school in marching.

In recent years there have been several pipe band and music tours. In April 2006, the pipe band toured the [[United States]]. The band played in the Virginia International Tattoo in that period It was be the pipe band's fourth international tour and its second time participating in an International Tattoo of that magnitude. The first was the Nova Scotia Tattoo in 2000.

All students in the senior school are eligible to play in the school's bands.

The school's music bands are the Dixieland Band (Horns and Brass), String Orchestra, Big Band 1 (guitar, drums, brass), Big Band 2 (guitar, drums, brass), Middle School Concert Band (years 6 to 10), Chamber Strings, Concert Band (brass and drums), Wind Ensemble (with [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Perth|Presbyterian Ladies' College]]), Vocal Ensemble, Brass Ensemble, Guitar Ensemble.

The school offers several music scholarships for students in years 7 or 8. These scholarships are in Voice, Cello, Trumpet, Violin and Trombone.

The school song is ''God of Our Fathers'' which is to the tune of ''Highland Cathedral''. The song is sung at the first and last assembly each term and the music is performed by two pipers and a snare drummer from the pipeband, along with a small brass support band.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:CD8u-WB1oDkJ:www.flagaustnat.asn.au/2004FlagDayProgrammeFinal.pdf+god+of+our+fathers+scotch+college&hl=en&client=firefox-a www.flagaustnat.asn.au/2004FlagDayProgrammeFinal.pdf].

==Uniform==
[[Image:Scotch badge.JPG|100px|thumb|The school badge on a blazer worn by students from Years 8 to 11.]]
Scotch College, like most [[Australian]] independent [[schools]], requires [[students]] to wear full [[school uniform]] at all times. There are currently two school uniforms - a summer and a winter.

In summer, a [[Khaki (color)|khaki]] collared short-sleeved shirt is worn with light green shorts, house tie, green Scotch socks and black lace-up shoes. On the left breast pocket, above the school badge, a house braid is worn. In the junior school a Scotch coloured braid is worn whilst in Years 8 to 11 the braid is their house colour; Year 12 students wear both braids.

In winter a white long-sleeved collared shirt is worn, along with house tie, black belt, grey trousers, grey socks, black lace up shoes and a maroon [[blazer]]. Year 12s wear a striped blazer. A grey Scotch jumper may be worn over the shirt in both summer and winter uniforms.

In October 2005, students voted on a whether to keep the summer uniform or to change it. The results of this election have not yet been released. One of questions on the ballot was if students wanted to wear ties. It is believed many students said no to wearing ties.

The school may have fund raising "free dress" days where boys may wear what they choose to school if they donate $2 to a designated charity. Some free dress days have included "pretty in pink" and "football Friday" themes, with competitions at lunch break for best dress.

Senior School students have two ties - a house [[tie]] and a school [[tie]]. On most days, students will wear the house [[tie]]. On special occasions, such as speech night the school [[tie]] is worn. House ties contain their respective house tartans.

Students may also earn a colours tie or an honours tie. Colours ties are awarded to students who perform in an extra-curriculum activity such as making a firsts team. An honours ties are rare and are only awarded when a [[student]] performs very well in that sport and gives some voluntary service to the sport. The academic equal to an honours tie is an academic tie which is awarded to students who earn 5 academic excellence awards, with at least two being in year 11 or 12. These three ties may only be worn on a Friday.
