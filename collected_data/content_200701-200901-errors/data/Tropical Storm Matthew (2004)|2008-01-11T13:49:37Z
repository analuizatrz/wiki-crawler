'''Tropical Storm Matthew''' was a weak tropical storm in the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season]] that made landfall on [[Louisiana]]. Matthew was the thirteenth tropical storm of the season and the ninth storm to affect the [[United States]].

Matthew formed over the western [[Gulf of Mexico]] on [[October 8]] and struck south-central Louisiana two days later. The combination of this storm and an upper cyclone over the southern Plains brought heavy rains to much of the [[Gulf Coast]], with the highest amounts reported lying over 15&nbsp;inches (381&nbsp;mm) in northern Louisiana. Damage was minimal, totaling $305,000 (2004 USD), and no casualties were reported.

==Storm History==
{{storm path|Matthew 2004 track.png}}
A tropical wave moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[September 19]]. The wave moved westward, but was difficult to track due to its proximity to [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Lisa|Hurricane Lisa]] and another large tropical wave. It passed through the [[Lesser Antilles]], and slowly organized as convection increased due to an upper level low. On [[October 5]], it entered the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and developed an area of low pressure two days later. The system continued to organize, and on [[October 8]], after developing a circulation, it developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen while located 205&nbsp;miles (330&nbsp;km) to the southeast of [[Brownsville, Texas]]. <ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2004|title=Tropical Storm Matthew Tropical Cyclone Report|accessdate=2006-05-22|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004matthew.shtml?}}</ref>

The depression moved to the east-northeast, and quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Matthew. Operationally, Matthew fluctuated between tropical depression and tropical storm status, but in post-season analysis, the storm remained a tropical storm. The storm turned to the northeast while moving around the periphery of a high pressure system over [[Texas]], and attained a peak intensity of 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h) on [[October 9]]. Strong wind shear limited further strengthening, and on [[October 10]], Matthew struck [[Cocodrie, Louisiana]] as a minimal tropical storm.<ref name="tcr"/> It became an [[Extratropical cyclone]], occluding near the time of landfall.<ref>Hydrometeorological Prediction Center.

After it merged with the system, the storm moved inland over [[Arkansas]], [[Tennessee]] and the [[Ohio Valley]]. While moving inland, Matthew spun off another low pressure system that formed over [[North Carolina]] on [[October 13]]. The low moved off the [[Mid-Atlantic]] coast before hitting [[Massachusetts]] two days later, and later merged with the original low pressure system of Matthew.<ref name="Matthew's Tropical Cyclone Report">http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/matthew2004.html</ref>

==Preparations==
Initially, forecasters at the [[National Hurricane Center]] predicted that Matthew would take a more eastern track and hit the [[Florida Panhandle]]. <ref name="miaim">{{cite web|author=Miami Herald|year=2004|title=Tropical Storm Matthew expected to head for Florida|accessdate=2006-05-22|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1:123015127/Tropical+Storm+Matthew+expected+to+head+for+Florida.html?refid=SEO}}</ref> Because the track shifted westward, the National Hurricane Center issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|Tropical Storm Warning]] from the [[Florida]]/[[Alabama]] border to [[Intracoastal City, Louisiana]] on the day before landfall. <ref name="tcr"/>

==Impact==

Though damage was minor throughout its path, Matthew dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across much of the Gulf Coast, peaking at over 15 inches (381 mm) in portions of [[Louisiana]].

===Louisiana===
Upon making landfall, Matthew caused a storm surge of up to 5.85 feet (1.8 m) in [[Frenier, Louisiana]]. The storm surge and waves resulted in significant beach erosion in [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]]. Matthew produced heavy rainfall across its path, totaling to 16.23 inches (410 mm) in [[Reserve, Louisiana|Reserve]] in the southeastern portion of the state. <ref name="tcr"/> Portions of northwestern Louisiana experienced significant rainfall, including a peak of 18 inches (460 mm) in [[Haynesville, Louisiana|Haynesville]] near the Louisiana/[[Arkansas]] border. <ref name="hpc">{{cite web|author=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|year=2006|title=Rainfall Summary of Tropical Storm Matthew|accessdate=2006-05-22|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/matthew2004.html}}</ref> In addition, Matthew spawned one tornado, causing damage to the roof of a trailer in [[Golden Meadow, Louisiana|Golden Meadow]]. <ref name="tcr"/> The rainfall also caused rivers to crest higher than normal, including the [[Killian River]] which peaked at 5.7 feet (1.7 m). <ref name="nws">{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|year=2004|title=Post-Tropical Cyclone Report- Tropical Storm Matthew|accessdate=2006-05-22|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lix/html/psh_matthew.htm}}</ref>

Rainfall and storm surge flooded 20 homes in [[Terrebonne Parish]]. In addition, several homes in [[Lafouche Parish, Louisiana|Lafouche Parish]] experienced flooding, including two with over two feet of water. Numerous homes in Golden Meadow experienced flooding, as well. The flooding also forced the temporary closing of numerous roads across the state <ref name="nws"/>, including portions of [[U.S. Route 11]] and [[Interstate 10]]. Flood waters from the storm cracked a water line in [[LaPlace, Louisiana|LaPlace]], leaving nearly 30,000 residents and many businesses without tap water. The problem was expected to take little time to fix, though residents were advise to boil the water before drinking it. Matthew also left 2,500 people without power for a short period of time. The storm's impact also closed several schools, forcing school administrators to reschedule plans for making up school closings caused by [[Hurricane Ivan]] one month earlier. <ref name="report">{{cite news|author=Susan Finch & Aesha Rasheed|year=2004|title=Matthew Floods Roads, Homes|publisher=The Times Picayune|accessdate=2006-05-22|url=http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/newsrelated/matthew_flds.htm}}</ref> In all, Matthew caused no deaths and $255,000 in damage (2004 USD). <ref name="sd">{{cite web|author=Storm Data and Unusual Weather Phenomena|year=2004|title=October 2004 Summary|accessdate=2006-05-23|url=http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:130649068&ctrlInfo=Round20%3AMode20c%3ADocG%3AResult&ao=}}</ref>

===Elsewhere===
As the storm made landfall, the outer-bands of Matthew brought heavy rains in [[Florida]]. The rain was reported as far south as [[Naples]]. In [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], 30 mph (48 km/h) gusts were reported, as well rainfall totaling up to 3 to 4 inches (75 to 100 mm).<ref name="clubkayak">{{cite web|author=Ed Schessl|year=2004|title=Summer of Storms 2004|accessdate=2006-05-24|url=http://www.clubkayak.com/views/sos.html#matthew}}</ref> In [[Alabama]], wind gusts peaked at 47 mph (75 km/h) at [[Dauphin Island]]. The storm produced light rainfall across the state, totaling to 2.74 inches (70 mm) at [[Grand Bay, Alabama|Grand Bay]]. In addition, Matthew produced tides of 1 to 3 feet (.3 to .9 m) above normal, causing minor to major beach erosion. The beach erosion, which typically would have been minor for a weak storm, was greater than expected due to the passage of [[Hurricane Ivan]] just weeks before. No major damage was reported in Alabama. <ref name="alasd">{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|year=2004|title=Storm Data and Unusual Weather Phenomena (Alabama)|accessdate=2006-05-24|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/stormdat/bmxoct2004.pdf}}</ref> In [[Mississippi]], winds gusts peaked at 45 mph (72 km/h) with sustained winds of 39 mph (63 km/h) in [[Waveland, Mississippi|Waveland]]. Storm surge ranged from 2 to 4 feet (.6 to 1.2 m) along much of the coastline, though Waveland reported a peak of 5.13 feet (1.56 m). Rainfall totals were mainly between 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm). Damage in Mississippi totaled to $50,000 (2004 USD). <ref name="sd"/>

Matthew produced moderate rainfall on its west side, as well. Portions of [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]] experienced over 5 inches (127 mm) of rain, while southern [[Arkansas]] received over 10 inches (255 mm) of rainfall. <ref name="hpc"/> The rainfall was well-received due to a period of dry weather in the area. Though it slowed harvest activities, it aided pastures. <ref name="crop">{{cite web|author=National Agriculture Statistics Service|year=2004|title=Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin (October 3-9)|accessdate=2006-05-24|url=http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/reports/waobr/weather/2004/summary/weth4204.pdf}}</ref>

This was the first time a tropical storm was named '''Matthew'''. Matthew is the replacement name set in spring of [[1999]] in place of [[Hurricane Mitch]]. Because the damage was minimal, the name was not retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and will be on the list of names for the 2010 season.
