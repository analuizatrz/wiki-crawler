A '''cannon''' is a large tubular [[firearm]] that uses [[gunpowder]] to fire a heavy [[projectile]] over a long distance. They were [[History of cannon|first used]] in [[China]], and were the archetypal form of [[artillery]]. The [[Cannon in the Middle Ages|first cannon in Europe]] probably appeared in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic]] and Christian [[Spain]]. [[English cannon]]s were first used during the [[Hundred Years War]], when primitive cannon were used at the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346. The end of the [[Middle Ages]] saw the construction of larger and more powerful cannon, and their spread in warfare throughout the world. 

[[Asia]] saw the construction of some of the world's largest cannon, such as the [[India]]n [[Jaivana cannon]]. The "giant gun" trend was by then disappearing in Europe, in favor of larger numbers of lighter, more maneuverable pieces. This eventually lead to the use of modern field artillery. While the medieval [[Great Turkish Bombard|Dardanelles Gun]] had required 200 men to [[Cannon operation|operate]] it, 18th century English cannon required only a dozen men, including two gunners, while during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] five gunners were used.

Cannon fire are also sometimes used in certain pieces of music, such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]'' and [[AC/DC]]'s ''[[For Those About to Rock (We Salute You) (song)|For those about to rock, we salute you]]''.

Retired or abandoned cannons are often preserved for display in places appropriate to their use, such as battlefields, military bases, and harbors, from whence the ships that bore them set sail.  Cannon recovered from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water, and [[Extractive metallurgy|electrolytic reduction treatment]] is required to forestall the process of corrosion. <ref>{{cite web

==Etymology and terminology==
The term ''cannon'' comes through [[Old French]] from [[Italian language|Old Italian]] ''cannone'', ultimately derived from [[Latin]] ''canna''&mdash;a tube.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/5/C0070500.html American Heritage Dictionary]</ref> The Latinised word ''canon'' was used for a gun since 1326 in Italy, and 1418 in England. ''Bombardum'', or "bombard", was earliest used for "cannon", but from 1430 it came to refer only to the largest weapons.<ref name="Nitrates">[http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/cannon.htm Cannons and Gunpowder]</ref> "Cannon" serves both as the singular and plural of the noun, although the plural "cannons" can also be used. The term can apply to a modern day [[rifled]] [[machine gun]] with a [[calibre]] of 20 mm or more (see [[autocannon]]).

Any large, smooth-bored, [[muzzle-loading]] [[gun]] used before the advent of [[breech-loading]], [[rifled]] guns firing explosive [[shell (projectile)|shells]] may sometimes be referred to as a cannon, though the term specifically refers to a gun designed to fire a 42 lb shot as opposed to a "[[Demi-cannon]]" (32 lb), [[Culverin]] (18 lb) or [[Demi-culverin]] (9 lb).

When on board a warship a cannon is called a ''gun'', while a cannonball is a ''roundshot''.

The first documented battlefield use of artillery with gunpowder propellant took place on January 28, 1132 when [[Song Dynasty|Song]] General [[Han Shizhong]] used [[escalade]] and [[Huochong]] to capture a city in [[Fujian]]. The first illustration of a cannon is dated to [[1326]].<ref>''"Weapons: An International Encyclopedia from 5000 B.C. to 2000 A.D."'', by the Diagram Group, 1990 ed., p. 111</ref> In his 1341 poem ''The Iron Cannon Affair'', one of the first accounts of the use of gunpowder artillery in China, Zhang Xian wrote that a cannonball fired from an eruptor could "pierce the heart or belly when it strikes a man or horse, and can even transfix several persons at once".<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Norris|2003|p=11}}</ref>

[[Needham]] suggests that the proto-[[Shell (projectile)|shell]]s described in the ''[[Huolongjing]]'' may be among the first of their kind.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Needham|1986}}</ref> The Chinese mounted more than 3,000 bronze and iron casted cannons on the [[Great Wall of China]] in defence against the Mongols.

===Middle East===
:''Main article: [[Inventions in the Muslim world#Military technology|Muslim military technology]]''

Portable [[hand cannon]]s (''midfa'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) were first used by the [[Egypt]]ians to repel the [[Mongols]] at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in 1260, and again in 1304.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} The gunpowder compositions used for the cannons at the battles were later described in several manuscripts in the early 14th century. Four different gunpowder compositions were used at these battles, the most explosive having a gunpowder composition (74% saltpetre, 11% sulfur, 15% carbon) almost identical to the modern composition for gunpowder (75% saltpetre, 10% sulfur, 15% carbon). These gunpowder compositions were likely superior to those known in China or Europe at that time.<ref name="ArabRockets">[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%203.htm Gunpowder Composition for Rockets and Cannon in Arabic Military Treatises In Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries]</ref><ref>[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2072.htm Technology Transfer in the Chemical Industries]</ref>

===Medieval Europe===
{{main|Cannon in the Middle Ages}}
The first mention of the composition of gunpowder in express terms in Europe appeared in 1216, in [[Roger Bacon]]'s "''De nullitate magiæ''" at Oxford.<ref>{{cite book

}}; Note the [[Long s]]</ref>  Later in 1248, his "''Opus Maior''" describes a recipe and recognized military use:
[[Image:EarlyCannonDeNobilitatibusSapientiiEtPrudentiisRegumManuscriptWalterdeMilemete1326.jpg|thumb|Earliest picture of a European cannon, "De Nobilitatibus Sapientii Et Prudentiis Regum" Walter de Milemete, 1326.]]
[[Image:Arrow fireing cannon1.jpg|thumb|right|A reconstruction of the vase cannon that fired arrows.]]
{{long quotation|"We can, with saltpeter and other substances, compose artificially a fire that can be launched over long distances... By only using a very small quantity of this material much light can be created accompanied by a horrible fracas. It is possible with it to destroy a town or an army ... In order to produce this artificial lightning and thunder it is necessary to take saltpeter, sulfur, and Luru Vopo Vir Can Utriet".}}
Bacon described firecrackers, "used in certain parts of the world". Bacon's mixture resembles the assumed composition of Chinese slow-burning powder as used in fire arrows and rockets, but will probably not function well as cannon gunpowder - the saltpeter content is too low.

The first use of gunpowder in Europe was the [[Moors|Moorish]] cannon first used by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] in [[Spain]] at the siege of [[Seville]] in 1248, and the siege of [[Niebla, Huelva|Niebla]] in 1262.<ref name="ArabRockets"/>

By 1250, "coal and sulphur" had been recognised as the best weapon for [[naval warfare|ship-to-ship combat]],<ref>[http://www.mediumaevum.com/75years/mirror/sec2.html#XXXIX King's Mirror, Chapter XXXVII: The duties, activities and amusements of the Royal Guardsmen]</ref> while hand guns were probably in use at this time, such as against the [[Mongols]], and Italian ''scopettieri'' ("gun bearers") were mentioned in conjunction with crossbowmen in 1281. The Spanish Kings enlisted "the first artillery-masters on the Peninsula" in the mid-14th century.<ref>Hoffmeyer, p. 217.</ref>

Cannon saw its first real use on the European battlefield during the [[Hundred Years War]], being only used in small numbers by a few states during the 1340s. "Ribaldis", shot large arrows and simplistic grapeshot, were first mentioned in the English Privy Wardrobe accounts during preparations for the [[Battle of Crécy]] between 1345 and 1346.<ref name="Nicolle21">Nicolle, p 21</ref> The Florentine [[Giovanni Villani]] recounts their destructiveness on the field, indicating that by the end of the battle, "the whole plain was covered by men struck down by arrows and cannon balls."<ref name="Nicolle65">Nicolle, p 65</ref>
[[Image:Dardanelles Gun Turkish Bronze 15c.png|thumb|250px|left|The [[Great Turkish Bombard|Dardanelles Gun]] used at Constantinople.]] 
Similar cannon appeared also at the [[Siege of Calais]] in the same year, although it would not be until the 1380s that the "ribaudekin" clearly became mounted on wheels.<ref name="Nicolle21"/> Around the same period, the [[Byzantine Empire]] began to accumulate its own cannon to face the [[Ottoman]] threat, starting with medium-sized cannon 3 feet long and of 10" calibre.<ref name="Constantinople39">Turnbull, p 39-41</ref> The first definite use of artillery in the region was against the Ottoman siege of [[Constantinople]] in 1396, forcing the Turks to withdraw.<ref name="Constantinople39"/> The Turks acquired their own cannon by the siege of 1422, using "[[Falconet (cannon)|falcons]]", which were short but wide cannon. By 1453, the Turks used 68 Hungarian-made cannon for the 55-day bombardment of [[Walls of Constantinople]], "hurling the pieces everywhere and killing those who happened to be nearby."<ref name="Constantinople39"/> The largest of which required an operating crew of 200 men,<ref name="Trivia Library">[http://www.trivia-library.com/b/military-and-war-weapons-the-cannon.htm Military and War Weapons the Cannon]</ref> and 70 oxen and 10,000 men just to transport them.<ref name="Constantinople39"/> Gunpowder had also made the formerly devastating [[Greek fire]] obsolete, and with the final fall of what had once been the strongest walls in Europe on [[May 29]], "it was the [[Late Middle Ages|end of an era]] in more ways than one".<ref name="Constantinople43">Turnbull, p 43</ref>

[[Image:Kanon_in_het_Kremlin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1586 [[Tsar Cannon]], the largest [[howitzer]] ever made, by [[Andrey Chokhov]].]]
The end of the Middle Ages saw the construction of larger and more powerful cannon, and their spread in warfare throughout the world. The [[Tsar Cannon]], [[foundry|founded]] by Russian founding master [[Andrey Chokhov]] in 1586, was the largest [[howitzer]] ever made. The cannon, which still survives today, was intended to fire [[grapeshot]] and to defend [[the Kremlin]], but was never used. In fact, with such a large cannon, it may have been intended as a showpiece of military might and engineering from the beginning. 

Conventional siege artillery, such as [[siege tower]]s and trebuchets, became vulnerable and obsolete with the development of large cannon and changes in fortification. However, wooden "battery-towers" took on a similar role as siege towers in the [[gunpowder]] age, such as that used at [[siege of Kazan]] in 1552, which could hold ten large-calibre cannon and 50 lighter cannon.<ref name="Kazan">Nossov, p 53-55</ref>

As wheeled gun carriages became more common by the end of the 15th century, field artillery began to emerge.<ref>Sadler, p 22-23</ref> In ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] observed that "small pieces of cannon… do more damage than heavy artillery. The best remedy against the latter is making a resolute attack upon it as soon as possible…"<ref>[[Niccolò Machiavelli]], ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]]'', p.97; Quoted by Sadler, p. 61</ref> As was the case at [[Battle of Flodden Field|Flodden]] in 1513, the English [[field gun]]s outpaced the Scottish siege artillery firing twice or even thrice as many rounds.<ref name="Sadler60">Sadler, p. 60</ref>

Most notable in this period, however, is the effect of cannon on conventional fortifications. Machiavelli wrote, "There is no wall, whatever its thickness that artillery will not destroy in only a few days".<ref>[[Niccolò Machiavelli]], ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]]''</ref>  Although [[castle]]s were not immediatedly made obsolete by cannon, their importance declined.<ref name="Castles81">Wilkinson, p 81</ref> Instead of majestic [[tower]]s and [[merlon]]s, the walls of new fortresses were thicker and angulated, while towers became lower and stouter.<ref name="Castles81"/>

Forts featuring [[Artillery battery|cannon batteries]] were built during the [[Renaissance]], such as the ''[[trace italienne]]'' of [[Italy]] and the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]]s' [[Device Forts]] in England.<ref name="Castles81"/> To guard against artillery and gunfire, increasing use was made of earthen, brick and stone [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastworks]] and [[redoubt]]s, such as the geometric "[[Star fort]]s" of the 17th century French [[Marquis de Vauban]]. These soon replaced castles in Europe, and eventually castles in the Americas were superseded by bastions and forts.<ref name="SpanishMain">Chartrand, ''Spanish Main 1492-1800''</ref>

===18th and 19th century===
{{main|Naval artillery in the Age of Sail|Field artillery in the American Civil War}}
[[Image:HMS Victory 68lb Carronade.png|thumb|left|68-pounder naval carronade.]]
The lower tier of 17th century English [[Ship of the Line|ships of the line]] were usually equipped with demi-cannon — a [[navy|naval]] [[gun]] which fired a 32-pound solid shot. A full cannon at this time fired a 42-pound shot, but these were discontinued by the 18th century as they were seen as too unwieldy. By the end of the century, principles long adopted in Europe specified the characteristics of cannon of the British ship design and the types and sizes of acceptable defects.  The U.S. Navy tested guns by measurement, proof by powder (two or three firings), and using compressed water for leak detection.<ref name="NavyBarbaryI">Knox, ''Naval Documents related to the United Stats Wars with the Barbary Powers'', Volume I</ref>

The [[carronade]] was adopted by the Royal Navy in 1779, and the lower muzzle velocity of the [[round shot]] was intended to create many more of the deadly wooden [[wikt:splinter|splinter]]s when hitting the structure of an enemy vessel. It was much shorter and a third to a quarter of the weight of an equivalent [[long gun]]: for example, a 32 pounder carronade weighed less than a [[ton]], but a 32 pounder long gun weighed over 3 tons. The guns were thus easier to handle and also required less than half the gunpowder of long guns mounted on naval garrison carriages, allowing fewer men to crew them.<ref>[http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavycarronade.htm The Historical Maritime Society]</ref> Carronades were manufactured in the usual naval gun [[calibre]]s<!--12, 18, 24, 32 and 42&nbsp;[[pound (weight)#Imperial_pound|pounders]], but 6&nbsp;pdr and 68&nbsp;pdr versions are known-->, but they were not counted in a [[ship of the line]]'s rated number of guns.  As a result, the classification of Royal Navy vessels in this period can mislead, since they would often be carrying more pieces of ordnance than were listed.

The Turkish cannons of the siege of Constantinople, after being on permanent display for four centuries, were used to battle a British fleet in 1807. The artillery hit a British ship with two 700 pound cannonballs, killing 60 sailors. In 1867, Sultan Abdul Aziz gifted [[Queen Victoria]] the 17 ton "Dardanelles Gun" - one of the cannons used at the siege of Constantinople.<ref name="Trivia Library"/>
[[Image:Utah Battery San Juan Bridge.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|U.S. troops fire during the 1899 [[Battle of Manila (1899)|Battle of Manila]], [[Philippine-American War]].]]
But in contrast to these antiquated weapons, later western guns during the 19th century became massive, destructive, more accurate, and covered a very long range - such as the American 3 inch wrought-iron muzzle-loading [[howitzer]] used during the [[American Civil War]] with an effective range of over 1.1 miles (1.83Km). In the 1810s and 1820s, greater emphasis was placed on the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside. The carronade, although initially very successful and widely adopted, disappeared from the Royal Navy from the 1850s after the development of steel, jacketed cannon by [[William George Armstrong]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Nevertheless, carronades were used in the [[American Civil War]] in the 1860s.

The practice of [[rifling]], involving casting spiralling lines inside the barrel, was first applied to artillery in the 1860s, giving new cannon [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic]] stability and improving their accuracy. The cynical attitude towards recruited infantry in the face of ever more powerful field artillery is the source of the term "[[cannon fodder]]", first used by [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] in [[1814]];<ref>{{fr icon}} [[:wikisource:fr:De Buonaparte et des Bourbons|"De Buonaparte et des Bourbons"]] — full text in the French [[Wikisource]].</ref> although the concept of regarding soldiers as nothing more than "food for powder" dates back at least to [[Shakespeare]]'s time.<ref>[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]''</ref>

The superior cannon technology of Westerners in later years would bring them tremendous advantages in warfare. For example, in the [[Opium War]] in China during the 19th century, the British battleships bombarded the coastal areas and fortifications safe from the reach of the Chinese cannon. Similarly, the shortest war on the record, the [[Anglo-Zanzibar War]] of 1896, was brought to a swift conclusion by shelling from British battleships.<ref>Guinness Book of World Records, 2002 edition, p 112</ref>

===Modern cannon===<!-- This section is linked from [[Chinese Civil War]] -->
[[Image:British 39th Siege Battery RGA Somme 1916.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Royal Artillery]] [[Howitzer]]s at the [[First day on the Somme|Somme]].]]

A modern cannon is a dual-purpose weapon. It can operate as a direct fire, low trajectory, high velocity weapon, firing directly at its target like a modern main battle [[tank]]. It can also operate as a lower velocity, high trajectory, [[indirect fire]] weapon or howitzer. Since [[World War I]], the term has been used to refer to a gun of around 20 mm to 125 mm calibre, sometimes with an automatic loading [[Firearm action|action]] capable of firing explosive [[ammunition]], an ''[[auto-cannon]]''. Lower [[muzzle_velocity|muzzle velocity]] modern artillery is used almost exclusively in the [[indirect fire]] mode, while higher-velocity cannons from 20 mm up to 125 mm calibre are used in a [[direct fire]] mode. Nevertheless, tanks can fire high trajectory missions and artillery cannons can fire direct fire missions if the battlefield situation calls for it. Both tank and artillery gunners are trained for these non-typical missions.

The minimum calibre of a cannon, 20 mm, has been a ''[[de facto]]'' standard since World War II, when heavy machine guns of 12.7 mm (0.5 inches) and 13.2 mm calibre were used side by side with 20 mm and larger guns, the latter using explosive ammunition (''eg.'' [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] fighters with 20 mm Hispano cannon and [[Luftwaffe]] with 20 mm and [[30 mm caliber|30 mm]] cannon). The [[Bofors 40 mm gun]] and [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]] are two examples largely used during World War II, and still in use today.
[[Image:5-54-Mark-45-firing edit.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An American 5-inch Mark 45 gun, immediately after the shell has left the barrel.]]

Most nations use these modern cannons on their lighter vehicles; typical of the type is the [[25 mm caliber|25 mm]] [[M242|'Bushmaster']] [[chain gun]] mounted on the [[LAV 25|LAV]] and [[M2 Bradley|Bradley]] [[Infantry fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]].<ref>[http://www.army-technology.com/projects/bradley/ Bradley M2 / M3 Tracked Armoured Fighting Vehicles, USA]</ref> At the same time, the guns used aboard the [[Iowa class battleship|Iowa class]] [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|USS ''Wisconsin'']] and [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] were capable of firing projectiles a distance of 39 km.<ref>Guinness Book of World Records, 2002 edition, p 184</ref>

Significant innovations have been made regarding the cannon's place in modern warfare. "[[Supergun]]s" have been developed since the early 20th century, and the 20 cm (200mm) calibre "[[Paris Gun]]" of [[World War I]] had the greatest range of a gun, achieving 122 km.<ref>Guinness Book of World Records, 2002 edition, p 113</ref> Testing has also been carried out on [[Nuclear artillery|nuclear cannon]] in the [[1950s]], as in the [[United States]]' [[Operation Upshot-Knothole]].  Today, [[United States]] 152 mm artillery fires [[MGM-51 Shillelagh|Shillelagh missiles]], which are guided to their targets by [[infra-red]] beams, while the [[Super High Altitude Research Project]] artillery can fire shells 75.75 mi. above the earth's surface.<ref name="Trivia Library"/>

Cannon have also found peaceful application outside warfare, such as [[water cannon]], [[snow cannon]], [[hail cannon]] and [[cannon netting]].

==Operation==
{{main|Cannon operation}}
[[Image:Cannoniere_1652.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The parts of a cannon described, John Roberts, ''The Compleat Cannoniere'', London 1652.]]
Cannon operation during the 18th century is described by the 1771 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, while the left gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine and keep ready to fire the cannon at the officer's command.  Three soldiers stood on each side of the cannon, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left was charged with providing 50 bullets.<ref name="EB1771">{{cite book
 |title=Encyclopedia Britannica
 |year=1771
 |location=London
 |chapter=Gunnery
}}</ref>

Prior to loading, the cannon would be well cleaned with a wet sponge to extinguish any smoldering material from the last shot (because fresh powder was about to be poured in, and any lingering ignition sources would set it off prematurely). The powder was added, followed by a wad of paper or hay, and the ball was thrown in. After ramming the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range—about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above the horizontal line was called random-shot. The officer of artillery had to ensure the cannon was diligently served. Water was available to dip the sponges in and cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.<ref name="EB1771"/>
[[Image:CannonWithSmoke.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cannon in a Civil War [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]: The large amounts of gunpowder often affected visibility significantly. Gunners hope for a strong wind that will allow them to continue to see their target.]]
[[Image:Vereshagin.Napoleon_near_Borodino.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The smoke-filled [[Battle of Borodino]], which marked 1812 as a turning point in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and inspired the ''[[1812 Overture]]''.]]
It was said that a 24-pounder could fire 90 to 100 shots a day in summer, or 60 to 75 in winter. A 16- or 12-pounder would fire a little more, because they were easier served. The Britannica mentions "some occasions where 200 shots have been fired from these pieces in the space of nine hours, and 138 in the space of five."<ref name="EB1771"/>

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a British gun team consisted of 5 numbered gunners. The gun's "No. 1" was the gun commander, and a sergeant, who aimed the gun. The No. 2 was the "spongeman" who cleaned the bore with the sponge dampened with water between shots; the intention being to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced. The No. 3, the loader, inserted the bag of powder and then the projectile. The No. 2 then used a rammer, or the sponge reversed, to drive it in. At the same time, the No. 4 ("ventsman") pressed his thumb on the vent hole to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the No. 4 pricked the bagged charge through the vent hole and filled the vent with powder. At the No. 1's command the No. 5 would fire the piece with his slowmatch.<ref>Holmes, Richard ''Redcoat: the British Soldier in the age of Horse and Musket''</ref>

==In music==
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:For_Those_About_to_Rock_We_Salute_You.JPG|thumb|right|200px|AC/DC album [[For Those About to Rock We Salute You]]]] -->
The cannon can be used as a kind of [[percussion]] instrument in certain pieces of music. The best known example is the ''[[1812 Overture]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], which should properly be played using an artillery section together with the orchestra. It is supposed to simulate the [[Battle of Borodino]]. The version using cannon fire was first laid down on a  recording by the [[Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra]] in the 1950s. Subsequent similar recordings have been made by other groups, exploiting the advances in audio technology. Cannon fire is used annually on the [[Fourth of July]] by the [[Boston Pops]] during their annual concert on the shores of the Charles River and by the [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]] during their annual concert on the steps of the US Capitol Building.

The [[hard rock]] band [[AC/DC]] also use cannon in their song ''[[For Those About to Rock (We Salute You) (song)|For those about to rock, we salute you]]''. The [[For Those About to Rock|album of the same name]] also features a cannon on its cover. They had even used real cannons for their live shows.

Due to their impracticalities, cannon are used for only grand, theatrical pieces, often with a military theme. In the case of the ''1812'', the cannon may be replaced with [[bass drum]]s or [[timpani]]. Less frequently strongly accented snare drum diminuendos can be heard.
