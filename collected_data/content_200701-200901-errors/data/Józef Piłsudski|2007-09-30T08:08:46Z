'''Józef Klemens Piłsudski''' ({{Audio|Pilsudski.ogg|['juzɛf piw'sutski]}}, [[December 5]], [[1867]] &ndash; [[May 12]], [[1935]]), was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[revolutionary]] and [[statesman]], [[Field Marshal]], first [[Chief of State]] (1918&ndash;1922) and [[dictator]] (1926&ndash;1935) of the [[Second Polish Republic]], as well as head of its [[Polish Armed Forces|armed forces]]. Born into a family with traditions dating back to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], from the middle of [[World War I]] until his death Piłsudski was the major influence on Poland's government and foreign policy, and an important figure in European politics. He is considered largely responsible for Poland having regained her [[independence]] in 1918, 123 years after the last [[partitions of Poland|partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1795.

Piłsudski from his youth supported the cause of Polish independence, and in his early political life was an influential member—later, leader—of the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. He considered the [[Russian Empire]] to be the most formidable obstacle to Polish independence, and worked with [[Austro-Hungary]] and [[Germany]] to ensure Russia's defeat in [[World War I]]. Later in the war, he withdrew his support from the [[Central Powers]] to work with the [[Triple Entente]] for the defeat of the Central Powers. After World War I, during the [[Polish-Soviet War]], he commanded the [[1920 Kiev Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]]. From November 1918 (when Poland regained independence) until 1921, he was Poland's [[Chief of State]] (''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]'').

In 1923, as the [[Polish government]] became dominated by the ''endecja'' ([[National Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democratic Party]]), Piłsudski's opponents, he withdrew from active politics. Three years later, however, he returned to power in the [[May Coup|May 1926 ''coup d'état'']], becoming ''[[de facto]]'' [[dictator]] of Poland. From then until his death in 1935, he concerned himself primarily with [[military]] and [[foreign affairs]]. To this day, Piłsudski is held in high regard by most of the [[Poland|Polish]] public.<ref name="Roshwald">Aviel Roshwald, Richard Stites, ''European Culture in the Great War: The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda, 1914-1918'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, ISBN 0521013240, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521013240&id=uteV3ytfmqQC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=Pilsudski+hero&sig=pUTn7o9EK83j--_aOWyiwKGkgPQ Google Books, p.60]</ref>

===Early life===
[[Image:Piludski w szkole.jpg|thumb|100px|left|thumb|Piłsudski as a schoolboy.]]
Piłsudski was born in 1867 in the village of [[Zalavas]] (in [[Polish language|Polish]], ''Zułów'') —  in the former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], in a part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] that had been [[partitions of Poland|seized]] by the [[Russian Empire]], and that is now in [[Lithuania]] — to a [[Polonization|polonized]] [[szlachta|noble]] [[Lithuanian nobility|Lithuanian]]<ref name="Davies121">[[Norman Davies]], ''Heart of Europe: the Past in Poland's Present'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1982, 2001, ISBN 0-19-280126-0, p. 121.</ref> family.<ref name="Poland.gov">{{cite web | title=Józef Piłsudski (1867 - 1935) | work=Poland.gov | url=http://poland.gov.pl/Jozef,Pilsudski,(1867-1935),1972.html | accessmonthday = April 23 | accessyear=2006 | curly=In late 1918, when asked by his fellow socialists for political support, Piłsudski replied: "Comrades, I took the red tram of socialism to the stop named Independence, but that's where I got off.

In 1885 Piłsudski began studying [[medicine]] at the [[University of Kharkov]] (modern [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]]), where he became involved with ''[[Narodnaya Vola]]'', part of the Russian ''[[Narodnik]]i'' revolutionary movement.<ref name="PWN">[http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3957301 PIŁSUDSKI JÓZEF] by Andrzej Chojnowski.

In fact, Piłsudski's main connection to the plot was the involvement in it of his elder brother, [[Bronisław Piłsudski]].<ref name="BronPił">[http://www.icrap.org/pl/cv.html Kalendarium wydarzeń życia Bronisława Piłsudskiego].

Józef Piłsudski received a milder sentence than his brother's: five years' [[exile]] to eastern [[Siberia]], first at [[Kirinsk]] on the [[Lena River]], later at [[Tunka]].<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref name="Urb 50"/> As an exile, Piłsudski was allowed to work in an occupation of his choosing, although local officials decided that as a Polish noble he was not entitled to the 10-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] pension received by most other exiles.<ref name="Urb 71">Urbankowski, op.cit, p. 71</ref>

While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, he was held for several weeks at an [[Irkutsk]] prison. There he took part in a prisoners' "revolt": after one of the prisoners had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other [[political prisoner]]s were brutally beaten by the guards for their defiance;<ref name="Urb 62-66">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 62-66</ref> Piłsudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent [[hunger strike]] until the authorities reinstated [[political prisoner]]s' privileges that had been suspended after the "revolt."<ref name="Urb 62-66"/> For his involvement in this event, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment; he had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to various health problems that would plague him throughout his life.<ref name="Urb 68-69">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 68-69</ref> During his years of exile in Siberia, Piłsudski met many ''[[Sybiraks]]'', including [[Bronisław Szwarce]], who had almost become a leader of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]].<ref name="Urb 74-77">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 74-77</ref>

The loss of two teeth may have caused Piłsudski later to cultivate a prominent [[mustache]] and, while speaking before groups, to carry his head in a bowed position.

After his release in 1892, Piłsudski in 1893 joined the Lithuanian branch of the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (PPS),<ref name="Poland.gov"/> forming the Lithuanian branch of PPS.<ref name="Urb 88">Urbanowski, op.cit., Page 88</ref> Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the ostensible internationalism of the Socialist movement, he always remained a Polish nationalist.<ref name="MM-209">MacMillan, [[op cit]], p. 209.</ref> In 1894, as its [[chief editor]], he began publishing a ''[[bibuła]]'' [[socialist]] [[newspaper]], ''[[Robotnik (1894-1939)|Robotnik]]'' (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers.<ref name="Poland.gov" /><ref name="Urb 93">Urbanowski, op.cit., Page 93</ref><ref name="PWN" /> In 1895 he became a PPS leader, and took the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that [[socialist]] ideology should be merged with [[nationalist]] ideology, as that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.<ref name="PWN"/>
[[Image:Jozef Pilsudski in 1899.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Piłsudski in 1899.]]
In 1899, while an underground organizer, Piłsudski married a fellow [[Socialism|socialist]] organizer, [[Maria Piłsudska|Maria Juszkiewiczowa, ''née'' Koplewska]], but the marriage deteriorated when several years later Piłsudski began an affair with a younger socialist,<ref name="MM-209"/> [[Aleksandra Piłsudska|Aleksandra Zahorska]]. Maria died in 1921, and in October that year Piłsudski married Aleksandra. They had two daughters, Wanda (who later became a psychiatrist) and Jadwiga, but this marriage also had its troubles.<ref name="Aleksandra">{{pl icon}} [http://biografie.genealogiapolska.pl/index2.php?a=2&b=1352 Aleksandra Piłsudska], last accessed on [[30 May]] [[2006]]</ref>

In February 1900, after the Russian authorities found ''Robotnik'''s underground [[printing press]] in [[Łódź]], Piłsudski was imprisoned at the [[Warsaw Citadel]] but, after feigning [[mental illness]] in May 1901, he managed to escape from a [[mental hospital]] at [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] with the help of [[Władysław Mazurkiewicz]] and others, fleeing to [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], then a region of [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

On the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904&ndash;1905), in summer 1904 Piłsudski traveled to [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], where he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain that country's assistance for an uprising in Poland. He offered to supply Japan with [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] in support of her war with Russia and proposed the creation of a [[Polish Legion]] from Poles,<ref name="Urb 109-111">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 109-111</ref> [[conscription|conscripted]] into the Russian Army, who had been captured by Japan. He also suggested a [[Prometheism|"Promethean" project]] directed at liberating [[ethnic]] communities occupied by the [[Russian Empire]] — a goal that he later continued to pursue and that would be partly achieved only in 1991 with the disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]].

Another notable Pole, [[Roman Dmowski]], also traveled to Japan, where he argued against Piłsudski's plan, endeavoring to discourage the Japanese government from supporting at this time a Polish revolution which Dmowski felt would be doomed to failure.<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/><ref name="Urb 109-111"/> Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain Piłsudski's political arch-enemy to the end of Piłsudski's life.<ref name="Zamoyski-332">Zamoyski, [[op cit]], p. 332.</ref> In the end, the Japanese offered Piłsudski only limited assistance; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and its combat organisation, while the Japanese declined the Legion proposal. This was much less than Piłsudski had hoped for.<ref name="Urb 109-111"/><ref name="Poland.gov"/>

In fall 1904, Piłsudski founded an armed organization, the "''[[Bojówki]]''" ("combat teams"), to create an armed [[resistance movement]] against the Russian authorities.<ref name="Zamoyski-330">{{cite book | author=[[Adam Zamoyski]] | title =The Polish Way | year =1987 | pages =422 | publisher =John Murray | location =London | id =ISBN 0531150690 | quote = p. 330}}</ref> PPS organized an increasing number of demonstrations (mostly in [[Warsaw]]); on [[October 28]], [[1904]] Russian [[Cossack]] cavalry trampled one of the demonstrations, in revenge, on [[November 13]] the 'bojówki' opened fire on the Russian police and military during a new demonstration.<ref name="Urb 113-116">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 113-116</ref><ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> First concentrating on fighting the spies and informants, in March 1905 'bojówki' started using [[bomb]]s to [[assassinate]] selected members of Russian police.<ref name="Urb 117-118">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 117-118</ref>

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Piłsudski played a leading role in events in [[Congress Poland]]<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> In early 1905, he ordered the PPS to launch a general strike there. It involved some 400,000 workers, and lasted two months before it was broken by the Russian authorities.<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> In June 1905, Piłsudski ordered an uprising in [[Łódź]].<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> During the "[[June Days Łódź|June Days]]", as the Łódź uprising came to be known, armed clashes broke out between gunmen loyal to Piłsudski's PPS and those loyal to [[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[Narodowa Demokracja|National Democratic Party]] (''Endeks'').<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> On [[December 22]], [[1905]], Piłsudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; his call was widely ignored.<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> Unlike the ''Endeks'', Piłsudski ordered the PPS to boycott the elections to the [[First Duma]].<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> The decision to boycott the elections and to try to win Polish independence through uprisings caused much tension within the PPS, and, in November 1906, a faction of the party split off in protest of Piłsudski's leadership.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> Piłsudski's faction was known as ''Old Faction'' or the ''Revolution Faction'' (Starzy, [[Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Frakcja Rewolucyjna|Frakcja Rewolucyjna]]), while their opponents were known as the ''Young Faction'', ''Moderate Faction'' or the ''Left Wing'' (Młodzi, ''Frakcja Umiarkowana'', [[Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Lewica|Lewica]]). The Youngs sympathized with the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] and believed that the priority should be cooperation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the [[tsardom]] and creating a [[socialist]] [[utopia]] first, and negotiation for independence would be easier later.<ref name="PWN"/> Piłsudski with his supporters from the revolutionary faction of the PPS, continued to plan a revolution against tsarist Russia<ref name="Poland.gov"/> which would secure Polish independence first. By 1909 Piłsudski's faction would be the majority faction of PPS again, and Piłsudski would remain one of the most important leaders of PPS until the [[First World War]].<ref name="Urb 131">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 131</ref>

Piłsudski anticipated a coming European war and the need to organize the nucleus of a future Polish army that could help win Poland's independence from the three empires that had [[partitions of Poland|partitioned her out of political existence in the late 18th century]]. In 1906, Piłsudski, with the connivance and support of the Austrian authorities, founded a military school in [[Kraków]] for the training of ''Bojówki''.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> In 1906 alone, the 800-strong ''Bojówki'', operating in five-man units in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; the number of casualties declined in the coming years; while the number of its members increased (to around 2,000 in 1908).<ref name="Urb 121-122">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 121-122</ref><ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> 'Bojówki' also assaulted Russian transports of money leaving Polish territories. In April/September 1908, the ''Bojówki'' robbed a Russian mail train carrying [[tax revenues]] from [[Warsaw]] to [[St. Petersburg]].<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> Piłsudski, who took part in the [[Bezdany raid|raid at Bezdany]] near Vilna 1908, used those funds to aid his secret military organization. The loot from that single raid (200,812 [[Russian ruble|ruble]]s--or approximately $100,000) was a virtual fortune in contemporary Eastern Europe and equaled the amount 'Bojówki' looted in the two previous years.<ref name="Urb 121-122"/>

In 1908, Piłsudski transformed the "Combat Teams" to "''[[Związek Walki Czynnej]]''" (Association for Active Struggle), headed by three of his associates, [[Władysław Sikorski]], [[Marian Kukiel]], and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]].<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> One of the main purposes of ZWC was to train officers and NCOs for the future Polish army.<ref name="PWN"/> In 1910 two legal [[paramilitary]] organisations were created in the Austrian partitional zone (one in [[Lwów]] and the second in [[Cracow]]), to conduct training and lectures in military science. In 1912, Piłsudski became the Commander-in-Chief of Związek Strzelecki (under the codename 'Mieczysław').<ref name="Poland.gov"/> With the permission of Austrian authorities, Piłsudski founded a series of "sporting clubs," followed by a [[Związek Strzelecki|riflemen's association]] that served as cover for training a Polish military force that grew by 1914 to 12,000 men.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> In 1914, Piłsudski declared that "only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation".<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/>

===World War I===
[[Image:Jozef Pilsudski3.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Piłsudski in uniform.]]
{{main|World War I}}
At a meeting in [[Paris]] in 1914, Piłsudski presciently declared that in the imminent war, for Poland to regain her independence, [[Russia]] must be beaten by the [[Central Powers]] (the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[German Empire]]s), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by [[France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the [[United States]].<ref name="Roos">[[Hans Roos]], ''A History of Modern Poland, from the Foundation of the State in the First World War to the Present Day'', [[Alfred A.

[[Image:Jozef Pilsudski2.jpg|thumb|left|90px|Piłsudski in [[World War I]] (1914).]]
At the outbreak of [[World War I]], on August 3, in [[Kraków]], Piłsudski formed a small [[cadre]] military unit, the [[First Cadre Company]], from members of [[Związek Strzelecki]] and [[Polskie Drużyny Strzeleckie]].<ref name="Urb 171-172">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 171-172</ref><ref name="PolPrzem">{{pl icon}} [http://www.polityka.pl/polityka/index2.jsp?place=Lead30&news_cat_id=1409&news_id=193189&layout=16&forum_id=6303&fpage=Threads&page=text Przemówienie do I kompanii kadrowej, Kraków, Oleandry, 3 sierpnia 1914].

[[Image:MalczewskiJacek.1916.PortretJozefaPilsudskiego.jpg|thumb|150px|Piłsudski.  Painting by [[Jacek Malczewski]], 1916.]]
Within the Legions, Piłsudski decreed that personnel were to be addressed by the [[French Revolution|French-Revolution]]-inspired "Citizen," and he himself was referred to as "the Commandant" ("''Komendant''").<ref name="Zamoyski-333">Zamoyski, [[op cit]], p. 333.</ref> Piłsudski commanded an extreme respect and loyalty from his men<ref name="Zamoyski-333"/> which would remain for years to come. The Polish Legion fought with distinction against Russia at the side of the Central Powers until 1917.

Soon after forming the Legions, also in 1914, Piłsudski set up another organization, the [[Polish Military Organisation]] (''Polska Organizacja Wojskowa''), which served as a precursor [[Polish intelligence]] agency and was designed to carry out espionage and sabotage missions.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Cienciala"/>
[[Image:Kielce pilsudski.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Piłsudski and staff, [[Kielce]], 1914.]]

In mid-1916, in the aftermath of [[battle of Kostiuchnówka]] (4-6 July), where Polish Legions delayed Russian offensive at a cost of over 2000 casualties, Piłsudski demanded that Central Powers issue a guarantee of independence for Poland, he backed this demand with his [[resignation]], as well as that of many of Legion's officers.<ref name="Urb 251-252">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 251-252</ref> On [[November 5]], [[1916]], the Central Powers proclaimed the "independence" of Poland, hoping for increasing number of Polish troops sent to the eastern front against Russia, relieving German forces to bolster the Western front. Piłsudski agreed to serve in the "[[Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918)|Kingdom of Poland]]" created by the Central Powers, and served as [[minister of war]] in the newly created [[Polish Regency government]].<ref name="Zamoyski-333"/> In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the worsening situation of the Central Powers, Piłsudski increasingly took an uncompromising stance, insisting that his men not be treated as "German [[colonial troops]]" and only be used to fight [[Russia]], and expecting the Central Powers to be defeated in the war, and not wishing to be allied to the losing side.<ref name="Urb 253">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 253</ref> 
[[Image:Pilsudski and officers 1915.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Piłsudski and his officers, 1915.]]
In the aftermath of the [[Oath Crisis]] (July 1917), when Piłsudski forbade Polish soldiers to take an oath of loyalty to the Central Powers, he was arrested and imprisoned at [[Magdeburg]]; the Polish units were disbanded, and the men incorporated into the [[Austro-Hungarian army]],<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref name="Cienciala"/> while the [[Polish Military Organization]] began attacking German targets.<ref name="PWN"/> Piłsudski's arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among Poles, many of whom began to see him as the most determined Polish leader, willing to fight against all the [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning powers]].<ref name="PWN"/>

On [[November 8]], [[1918]], Piłsudski and his comrade, [[Colonel]] [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], were released from [[Magdeburg]] and soon &mdash; like [[Vladimir Lenin]] before them &mdash; placed on a private train, bound for their national capital, as the increasingly desperate Germans hoped that Piłsudski would gather forces friendly to them.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

On [[November 11]], [[1918]], in [[Warsaw]], Piłsudski was appointed [[Commander in Chief]] of Polish forces by the [[Regency Council]] and was entrusted with creating a national government for the newly independent country; on that day (which would become Poland's [[Independence Day]]), he proclaimed an independent Polish state.<ref name="Cienciala"/> In that week he also negotiated the evacuation of the German garrison from Warsaw and of other German troops from the [[Ober-Ost]] (Eastern front); over 55,000 Germans would peacefully depart Poland immediately afterwards, leaving their weapons to the Poles; over 400,000 total would depart Polish territories in coming months.<ref name="Cienciala"/><ref name="Urb 256 and 277-278">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 256 and 277-278</ref> On [[November 14]], [[1918]], he was asked to provisionally supervise the running of the country. On [[November 22]] he officially received, from the new government of [[Jędrzej Moraczewski]], the title of Provisional [[Chief of State]] (''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]'') of renascent Poland.<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

Various Polish military organizations and provisional governments (Regency Council in Warsaw, government of [[Ignacy Daszyński]] in [[Lublin]] and [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] in [[Kraków]]) bowed to Piłsudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly Socialist and immediately introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (e.g. the 8-hour day, free school education, vote for women). This was absolutely necessary to avoid major unrest. However, Piłsudski believed that as head of state he must be above political parties,<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Cienciala"/> and the day after his arrival in [[Warsaw]], he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him [[socialism|socialist]]-style as "[[Comrade]]" ("''[[Towarzysz]]''") and asked for support of their revolutionary policies; Piłsudski rebuked them with his famous remark that "I took the red tram of socialism to the stop named Independence, but that's where I got off".<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref name="MM-209"/> He declined to support any one party and did not form any political organization of his own.<ref name="PWN"/> He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.

In the days immediately after the World War I, Piłsudski attempted to build a government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%.<ref name="MM-210">MacMillan, [[op cit]], p. 210.</ref> A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: "I have nowhere seen anything like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn".<ref name="MM-210"/> In addition, the country had to unify the different systems of [[law]], [[economics]], and [[administration (government)|administration]] in the former German, Austrian and Russian partitions of Poland into one; there were nine different [[legal system]]s, five [[currency|currencies]], 66 types of [[rail system]]s (with 165 models of [[locomotive]]s), and other similar problems, which all had to be urgently consolidated.<ref name="MM-210"/>

[[Wacław Jędrzejewicz]], in ''Piłsudski: a Life for Poland'', describes Piłsudski as very deliberate in his [[decision-making]]. He collected all available pertinent information, then took his time weighing it before arriving at a final decision. Piłsudski drove himself hard, working all day and, on a [[regimen]] of tea and chain-smoked cigarettes, all night.<ref name="MM-210"/> He maintained a [[Sparta]]n lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant, and became increasingly pale and thin.<ref name="MM-210"/> Though Piłsudski was very popular with much of the Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work), of a man who distrusted almost everyone, led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.<ref name="MM-209"/>

The first Polish government and Piłsudski were also distrusted in the West because Piłsudski had cooperated with the Central Powers in 1914-17 and because he had supported the formation of a Socialist government. It was not until January 1919, when the world-famed pianist and composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] became [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] (also Foreign Minister) of a new government, that it was recognized in the West.<ref name="Cienciala"/> That still left two separate governments claiming to be the legitimate government of Poland: Piłsudski's in Warsaw, and [[Roman Dmowski]]'s in [[Paris]].<ref name="MM-210"/> To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Piłsudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Piłsudski acting as provisional [[president]] and supreme [[commander-in-chief]] while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919]].<ref name="MM-213-214">MacMillan, [[op cit]], pp. 213-214.</ref>

Piłsudski often clashed with Dmowski, at variance with the latter's vision of the Poles as the dominant nationality in reborn Poland, and irked by Dmowski's attempt to send the [[Blue Army]] back to Poland through [[Danzig]], [[Germany]] (modern [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]).<ref name="MM-211 and 214">MacMillan, [[op cit]], p. 211 and p.214.</ref><ref name="BFG">[[Manfred F.

On [[20 February]] [[1919]], Piłsudski's declared that he would return his powers to the newly elected Polish parliament ([[Sejm]]). However, the Sejm reinstated his office in the [[Small Constitution of 1919|Small Constitution]]. The word Provisional was removed from the title; and Piłsudski would hold that office until [[9 December]] [[1922]], when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] was elected the first [[President of Poland]].<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

As for foreign politics, Piłsudski aspired to create a [[federation]] (to be called ''[[Międzymorze]]'', "Between-Seas," stretching once again from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[Black Sea]]) of Poland with independent [[Baltic States]], [[Belarus]] and Ukraine,<ref name="Cienciala"/> somewhat in emulation of the [[partitions of Poland|pre-partition]] [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]],<ref name="Brzez">[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] in his introduction to Waclaw Jedrzejewicz’s ''Pilsudski A Life For Poland'' wrote: ''Some years before his death Pilsudski, in a statement which epitomises the essence of modern Polish history, stated: “To be defeated and not yield is victory. To win and to rest on laurels is defeat”. [[...]] Pilsudski’s vision of Poland, paradoxically, was never attained. He contributed immensely to the creation of a modern Polish state, to the preservation of Poland from the Soviet invasion, yet he failed to create the kind of multinational commonwealth, based on principles of social justice and ethnic tolerance, to which he aspired in his youth. One may wonder how relevant was his image of such a Poland in the age of nationalism...''</ref> but with a smaller Poland surrounded by a federation of friendly nations.<ref name="PWN"/> Piłsudski's plan was, however, to be dashed by the outcome of the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919-1921.<ref name="PWN"/>

===Polish-Soviet War===

[[Image:Pilsudski.JPG|thumb|right|100px|Piłsudski in his famous field cap.]]

In the chaotic [[aftermath of World War I]], there was unrest on all Polish borders. Speaking of Poland's future frontiers, Piłsudski said: "All that we can gain in the west depends on the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] — on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany," while in the east "there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far."<ref name="MM-211">MacMillan, [[op cit]], p. 211</ref> 

In 1918 in the east, Polish forces clashed with Ukrainian forces in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]], and Piłsudski's first orders as Commander in Chief of the Polish Army, on 12 November 1918, was to provide support for the [[Battle of Lwów (1918)|Polish struggle in Lwów]].<ref name="Urb 281">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 281</ref> However, while Ukrainians were the first clear enemy, it soon became apparent that the split Ukrainian factions were not the real power in that region. Nonetheless in 1918 Piłsudski viewed their advance west as a major issue; he also considered [[Bolshevik]]s as less dangerous for Poland than their [[White movement|Russian-civil-war contenders]],<ref name="Kenez">[[Peter Kenez]], ''A History of the Soviet Union from the Beginning to the End'', Cambridge University Press, 1999, ISBN 0521311985, [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0521311985&id=aIY9qb6iIEcC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=%22Peace+of+Riga%22&sig=DOZgge7R-dNB7KTNOVV_QWrE8KI Google Books, p.37]</ref> as the [[White movement|White Russians]] - representative of the old [[Russian Empire]], [[partitions of Poland|partitioner of Poland]] - were not willing to accept Poland's independence,{{Fact|date=August 2007}} while the Bolsheviks did proclaim the [[partitions of Poland|partitions]] null and void.<ref name="Urb 291">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 291</ref> As such, by his refusal to join the attack on [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] struggling [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government, ignoring strong pressure from the [[Entente Cordiale]], Piłsudski had likely saved the Bolshevik government in summer-fall 1919. However, in the coming months and certainly years, it became apparent that the Bolsheviks were in fact the most dangerous enemy not only of the newly reconstructed Polish nation, but also of the Ukrainians.

[[Image:Jozef Pilsudski5.jpg|thumb|left|100px|In March 1920, Piłsudski was made "First [[Marshal of Poland]]."]]
In the aftermath of [[Russian westward offensive of 1918-1919]] and a series of escalating battles, which resulted in Poles advancing east, in April 1920, [[Marshal]] Piłsudski (as his rank had been since that March) signed an [[military alliance|alliance]] with Ukraine's leader, [[Symon Petliura]], to conduct joint operations against [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]]. The goal of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Polish-Ukrainian treaty]], signed [[April 21]], was to establish an independent Ukraine in alliance with Poland. In return, Petliura gave up Ukrainian claims to [[Galicia (Central Europe)|East Galicia]], and was denounced for this by East Galician Ukrainian leaders.<ref name="Cienciala"/> The Polish and Ukrainian armies, under Piłsudski's command, launched [[1920 Kiev Offensive|a successful offensive]] against the Russian forces in Ukraine.

On 1 July in light of the advancing Soviet offensive, the [[Council for Defence of the Nation]] was formed. Chaired by Piłsudski, it was supposted to provide quick decision making and temporarily replace the unruly [[Sejm]].<ref name="Urb 341-346 and 357-358">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 341-346 and 357-358</ref> However the National Democracts argued that the string of Bolshevik victories was Piłsudski's fault, demanded his resignation and some even accused him of treason, failing however to carry a [[vote of no confidence]] in the council on 19 July (this failure led to Dmowski's withdrawal from it).<ref name="Urb 341-346">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 341-346</ref> Various factions, including the Entente, pressured Poland to surrender and enter into negotiations with the Bolsheviks, however Piłsudski was a staunch advocate of continuing the fight.<ref name="Urb 341-346"/> On [[August 12]] Piłsudski tendered his resignation to Prime Minister [[Wincenty Witos]] - agreeing to become the scapegoat if the military solution fails - but Witos however refused to accept it.<ref name="Urb 341-346"/> Over the next few weeks, Poland's risky, unconventional strategy at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] (August 1920) managed to halt the Soviet advance.<ref name="Davies_WERS"/>

Piłsudski's plan called for Polish forces to withdraw across the [[Vistula River]] and defend the bridgeheads at [[Warsaw]] and the [[Wieprz River]], while some 25% of available [[division (military)|divisions]] concentrated to the south for a strategic counter-offensive. Next the plan required that two armies under General [[Jozef Haller de Hallenburg|Józef Haller]] facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, hold their [[trench|entrenched]] positions at all costs. At the same time, an army under General [[Władysław Sikorski]] was to strike north from behind Warsaw, thus cutting off the Soviet forces attempting to envelope Warsaw from that direction. The most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small (approximately 20,000-man), newly assembled "Reserve Army" (known also as the "Strike Group" &mdash; ''Grupa Uderzeniowa''), commanded personally by Piłsudski, comprising the most determined, battle-hardened Polish units. Their task was to spearhead a lightning northern offensive, from the [[Vistula River|Vistula]]-[[Wieprz River]] triangle south of [[Warsaw]], through a weak spot identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern Fronts. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski's army and the "Strike Group" would close near the [[East Prussia]]n border, resulting in the destruction of the encircled Soviet forces.<ref name="Cisek">[[Janusz Cisek]], ''Kosciuszko, We Are Here: American Pilots of the Kosciuszko Squadron in Defense of Poland, 1919-1921'', McFarland & Company, 2002, ISBN 0786412402, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0786412402&id=hNuGZOGk6UoC&pg=PA140&lpg=PA140&q=Rozwadowski&vq=Rozwadowski&dq=Rozwadowski&sig=Gzm5trogxhMjygu0qBKsACesExw Google Books, p.140-141]</ref><ref name="Urb 346-441">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 346-441 and 357-358</ref>

At the time, Piłsudski's plan was strongly criticized, and only the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other army commanders to go along with it. Although based on fairly reliable intelligence, including intercepted Soviet [[radio]] communications, the plan was termed "amateurish" by many high-ranking army officers and military experts, who were quick to point out Piłsudski's lack of a formal military education.

In 1925, after several governments had resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Piłsudski became more and more critical of the government, eventually issuing statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet.<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref name="PWN"/> When the unpopular [[Chjeno-Piast]] coalition, which Piłsudski had strongly criticized, formed a new government,<ref name="PWN"/> on May 12-14, 1926, Piłsudski returned to power in a ''[[coup d'état]]'' (the [[May Coup]]), supported by [[Polish Socialist Party]], [[PSL Wyzwolenie]], [[Stronnictwo Chłopskie]] and even [[Communist Party of Poland]].<ref name="Urb 515">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 515</ref> During the coup, 215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed, and over 900 persons had been wounded. <ref>{{pl icon}} [[Wojciech Roszkowski]] Historia Polski 1914-1991, Warszawa, 1992 ISBN 83-01-11014-7, pg 53 section 5.1</ref> President [[Stanisław Wojciechowski]] and Prime Minister Witos stepped down. Piłsudski, however, did not accept the office of president, aware of its limited powers. Piłsudski's formal offices &mdash; apart from two terms as [[prime minister]] in 1926-28 and 1930 &mdash; were for the most part limited to those of [[minister of defence]] and [[inspector-general]] of the [[armed forces]]. He also held the offices of minister of military affairs and chairman of the council of war.<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

===Authoritarian rule===
Piłsudski had no plans for any major reforms; he quickly distanced himself from the most radical of his left-wing supporters, declaring that his coup was to be a "revolution without revolutionary consequences".<ref name="PWN"/> His goals was to stabilize the country, reduce the influence of [[political party|political parties]] which he blamed for [[corruption]] and inefficiency, and strengthen the army.<ref name="Urb 528-529">Urbanowski, op.cit., Pages 528-529</ref><ref name="PWN"/>

====Internal politics====
[[Image:5 Warszawa 083.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], [[Warsaw]], Piłsudski's official residence during his years in power.]]

In internal politics, Piłsudski's coup meant vast limitations of parliamentary government in Poland for the next 10 years, as Piłsudski's ''[[Sanacja]]'' government (1926-1939) &mdash; conducted at times by [[authoritarian]] means &mdash; directed at restoring "moral health" to public life. From 1928 Sanacja was represented by the ''[[Bezpartyjny Blok Współpracy z Rządem]]'' movement. Popular support and elegant rhetoric allowed Piłsudski to maintain his authoritarian powers, which could not be overruled by the president, who in any case had been nominated by Pilsudski, nor by Sejm, whose powers were curtailed in [[August Novelization|constitutional amendments]] introduced soon after the coup, on [[2 August]] [[1926]].<ref name="Poland.gov"/> From 1926 to 1930, Piłsudski used mostly [[propaganda]] tools to weaken the position and influence of the opposition leaders.<ref name="PWN"/> The culmination of his dictatorial and 'above the law' policies came in 1930 with imprisonment and [[Brest trial|trial]] of certain political opponents before the [[Polish legislative election, 1930]], and the establishment of the prison for [[political prisoners]] in Bereza Kartuska (today [[Biaroza]])<ref name="PWN"/> where some prisoners were brutally mistreated.<ref>{{pl icon}} Wojciech Śleszyński, [http://kamunikat.net.iig.pl/www/czasopisy/bzh/20/15.htm Aspekty prawne utworzenia obozu odosobnienia w Berezie Kartuskiej i reakcje środowisk politycznych.

Nonetheless Piłsudski's reign depended more on his [[charismatic authority]] than on [[rational-legal authority]].<ref name="PWN"/> None of his followers could claim to be his successor and after his death the ''Sanacja'' would quickly fracture, with Poland returning to the pre-Piłsudski era of parliamentary political struggles.<ref name="PWN"/>

Piłsudski's regime marked the much needed stabilization and improvements in the situation of [[ethnic minorities]], which formed almost a third of the population of the Second Republic. Piłsudski replaced ''endecja's'' '[[polonization|ethnic assimilation']] with the 'state assimilation' policy: citizens were judged by their loyalty to the state, not by their nationality.<ref name="Snyder">[[Timothy Snyder]], ''The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999'', Yale University Press, ISBN 030010586X[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030010586X&id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=stanislaw+grabski&sig=5kSKOnXipwsTitk7w_hotRTooPQ Google Books, p.144]</ref> The years 1926-1935, and Piłsudski himself, were favourably viewed by many [[Polish Jews]], whose situation improved especially under the cabinet of the Piłsudski-appointed prime minister [[Kazimierz Bartel]].<ref name="Cieplinski">[[Feigue Cieplinski]], ''Poles and Jews: The Quest For Self-Determination 1919-1934'', Binghamton Journal of History, Fall 2002, Last accessed on [[2 June]] [[2006]].</ref><ref>Paulsson, Gunnar S., '' Secret City: The Hidden Jews of Warsaw, 1940-1945'', Yale University Press, 2003, [[Special:Booksources&isbn=0300095465|ISBN 0300095465]], [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300095465&id=vjJimC--9-kC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=Pilsudski,+Jews&sig=LiJGKRzy0dm5BA9pqohB8gmvq5U Google Books, p. 37]</ref> However a combination of various reasons, from the [[Great Depression]]<ref name="Snyder"/> to the [[vicious spiral]] of terrorist attacks by [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] and government pacifications meant that the situations of minorities of Poland was less than satisfactory, despite Piłsudski's efforts.<ref name="Snyder"/><ref name="Davies_GP2-407">Davies, God's Playground, op.cit., [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0231053525&id=DMoPXktGwiUC&pg=PA407&lpg=PA407&dq=Davies+OUN+terrorism&sig=n2yftCtdccp3U4rPQL8OcBtH9_8 Google Print, p.407]</ref>

In the realm of military, Piłsudski, once a great military strategist responsible for the ''[[Miracle at Vistula]]'', had been criticized for concentrating on [[personnel management]], and ignoring development of new plans, strategies or military equipment.<ref name="PWN"/>

====Foreign policy====
[[Image:Pilsudski by Kossak portrait.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Marshal Józef Piłsudski. Painting by [[Wojciech Kossak]], ca. 1928.]]
In foreign policy, Piłsudski, as [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] was later to do in [[France]], sought to maintain his country's independence on the international scene. Ably assisted by his protégé, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Józef Beck]], he sought support for Poland in alliances with western [[powers]] — [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] — and with friendly, if less powerful, neighbors: [[Romania]] and [[Hungary]]. A supporter of the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance]] and the [[Polish-Romanian Alliance]] (part of the [[Little Entente]]), he was  disappointed by the [[France|French]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] policy of [[appeasement]] evident in those countries' signing of the [[Locarno Treaties]].<ref name"Ilya Prizel">[[Ilya Prizel]], ''National Identity and Foreign Policy: Nationalism and Leadership in Poland, Russia and Ukraine'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, ISBN 0521576970, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521576970&id=fE2quB852jcC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=Pilsudski+wealth&sig=MmY_fMN0nBIs5qFavD_godqa-0Q Google Books, p.71]</ref><ref name="JLu">[[John Lukacs]], '' The Last European War: September 1939-December 1941'', Yale University Press, 2001, ISBN 0300089155 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300089155&id=5wktT0vEYgkC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=Pilsudski+France+1933&sig=Lp1a7st1SGuMJfKpvFWzLqOtm0w Google Books, p.30]</ref><ref name="NJ">[[Nicole Jordan]], ''The Popular Front and Central Europe: The Dilemmas of French Impotence 1918-1940'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, ISBN 0521522420, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521522420&id=4iQQrESpA48C&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=Pilsudski+France+1933&sig=La39fTfAVC8dXNTUcbufCrapDTk Google Books, p.23]</ref> Piłsudski therefore aimed to also maintain good relations with the USSR and   Germany; hence Poland signed [[non-aggression pact]]s with both its powerful neighbors (the 1932 [[Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]], and the 1934 [[German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]]). 

The two  treaties were meant to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbors.<ref name="Poland.gov"/> Piłsudski himself was acutely aware of the shakiness of the [[non-aggression pact]]s, and remarked: "Having these pacts, we are straddling two stools. This cannot last long. We have to know from which stool we will tumble first and when that will be."<ref>Kipp, Jacob, ed., ''Central European Security Concerns: Bridge, Buffer, Or Barrier?'', Routledge, 1993, [[Special:Booksources&isbn=0714645451|ISBN 0714645451]], [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0714645451&id=__zem3Mlm8AC&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=Pilsudski,+which+of+the+stools&sig=5tsX1PsM3c8El1ttH3LM2tGvuJ8 Google Books, p. 95]</ref>

Under Piłsudski's direction, Poland had good relations with some of its neighbors, notably [[Romania]], [[Hungary]] and [[Latvia]]. However, relations with [[Czechoslovakia]] were strained, and with [[Lithuania]] — worse. Relations with Germany and the Soviet Union varied over time, but during Piłsudski's tenure could for the most part be described as neutral.

Piłsudski's [[Prometheism|Promethean]] program, designed to weaken [[Tsarist Russia]]                                                                  and its successor the [[Soviet Union]] by supporting [[nationalism|nationalist]] independence movements of major non-Russian peoples dwelling within Russia or the Soviet Union, was coordinated from 1927 to the 1939 outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe by the [[military intelligence]] officer [[Edmund Charaszkiewicz]].<ref name="Char">{{pl icon}} [[Edmund Charaszkiewicz]], ''Zbiór dokumentów ppłk.

[[Image:Jozef Beck.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Józef Beck]], Minister of Military Affairs, later — of Foreign Affairs. He was one of Piłsudski's "colonels," and a close associate.]]

One of the most widely remarked-on of Piłsudski's foreign-policy moves was his rumored proposal to France to declare war on Germany after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had come to power in January 1933. Piłsudski may in fact have sounded out Poland's ally regarding the possibility of joint military action against Germany, which had been openly rearming in violation of the [[Versailles Treaty]]. When France demurred, Piłsudski felt compelled to sign a [[German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] in January 1934.<ref name="TT_NGP">[[Tomasz Torbus]], ''Nelles Guide Poland'', Hunter Publishing, Inc, 1999, ISBN 3886180883 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN3886180883&id=xH6iEYILvuYC&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=Pilsudski+France+1933&sig=hV7b1WHEJzrnGCt0vGkG_Bp_OtM Google Books, p.25]</ref><ref name="GQH">[[George H.

Note that author gives a source: [[Richard M. Watt]], ''Bitter Glory'', Simon and Schuster, 1979</ref> 

However, the argument that the German-Polish non-aggression pact had been forced on Piłsudski by French refusal to wage a "preventive war" has been disputed by historians who point out that there is no evidence in either the French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal was ever advanced.<ref name="Bel">{{pl icon}} [[Dariusz Baliszewski]], [http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=70406 ''Ostatnia wojna marszałka''], Tygodnik "[[Wprost]]", Nr 1148 (28 listopada 2004)], Polish, retrieved on [[24 March]] [[2005]]</ref> They state that when in late October 1933 rumors of a Polish "preventive-war" proposal were reported in [[Paris]], their source was the Polish Embassy, which had informed French reporters that Poland had proposed a "preventive war" to [[France]] and [[Belgium]]; but by this time Poland and Germany were already secretly negotiating their non-aggression pact. It has been argued that Piłsudski had had the Polish Embassy start rumors about a "preventive war" as a way of pressuring the Germans, who were demanding that Poland abrogate its 1921 [[Franco-Polish alliance]]. In the event, the Polish-German non-aggression pact specifically excluded that alliance. 

It has been said that Piłsudski's reason for seeking a non-aggression pact with Germany was his concern over France's [[Maginot Line]]. Until 1929, French plans in the event of war with Germany had called for a French offensive into the North German plain in conjunction with offensives from Poland and [[Czechoslovakia]]. The building of the [[Maginot Line]], begun in 1929, indicated that henceforth, in the event of war with Germany, the French Army would maintain a strictly defensive stance, and that France’s eastern allies were going to be on their own. (If this is true, then Piłsudski had successfully predicted the future: that is exactly what happened in 1939 with the [[Phony War]].) Thus, from Piłsudski's viewpoint, in light of France's military plans, a non-aggression pact with Germany was the best choice for Poland.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite web | title=Józef Piłsudski | work=Encyclopædia Britannica | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-5721 | accessdaymonth = 3 June | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Hitler unceasingly proposed a German-Polish alliance against the Soviets, but Piłsudski declined, instead seeking precious time to prepare for war with Germany or the Soviet Union if need be.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/><ref name="Hildebrand">[[Klaus Hildebrand]], ''The Foreign Policy of the Third Reich'', University of California Press, 1973, ISBN 0520025288 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520025288&id=bJWegl8wnF8C&pg=PA33&lpg=PA32&dq=Pilsudski+France+1933&sig=2AztWI0oGOImsxOscknyLP4GdJ8 Google Books, p.33]</ref> Hitler also on numerous occasions hoped to meet with Piłsudski, and again was rebuffed.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/>

===Death===
[[Image:Rossa-MATKA I SERCE SYNA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grave of Piłsudski's mother in [[Vilnius]].
The huge black [[tombstone]] is inscribed: "''MATKA I SERCE SYNA''"<br> ("A mother and the heart of her son") and bears evocative lines from a poem by [[Juliusz Słowacki|Słowacki]].]]
By 1935, unbeknownst to the public, Piłsudski had for several years been in declining health. On [[May 12]], [[1935]], he died of [[liver cancer]] at [[Warsaw]]'s [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]]. His funeral turned into a national tribute to the man who had probably done more than any other to restore Poland's independence.

Piłsudski's body was laid to rest in [[St. Leonard's Crypt]] at [[Kraków]]'s [[Wawel Cathedral]], except for his brain, which was donated to science, and his heart, which was interred in his mother's grave at [[Vilnius]]' [[Rossa Cemetery]], where it remains.<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

==Legacy==
[[Image:Edward Rydz-Smigly.jpg|thumb|right|110px|[[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] was seen by some as Piłsudski's successor.]]

On [[May 13]], [[1935]], in accordance with Józef Piłsudski's last wishes, [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] was named by Poland's president and government to be [[Inspector-General]] of the [[Polish Armed Forces]], and on [[November 10]], [[1936]], he was elevated to [[Marshal of Poland]]. Rydz was now one of the most powerful people in Poland — the "second man in the state after the President." While many saw Rydz-Śmigły as a successor to Piłsudski, he never became as influential.

The Polish government became increasingly [[authoritarian]] and [[conservatism|conservative]], with [[Rydz-Śmigły|Śmigły-Rydz's]] faction opposed by that of the more moderate [[Ignacy Mościcki]], who remained President. After 1938 Rydz-Śmigły reconciled with the President, but the ruling group remained divided into the "President's Men," mostly civilians (the "Castle Group," after the President's official residence, Warsaw's [[Royal Castle (Warsaw)|Royal Castle]]), and the "Marshal's Men" ("Piłsudski's Colonels"), professional military officers and old comrades-in-arms of Piłsudski's. After the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland in 1939]], some of this political division survived within the [[Polish government in exile]].

[[Image:Pilsudski in Warsaw2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Piłsudski on [[Warsaw]]'s [[Piłsudski Square]].  One of many statuary tributes throughout Poland.]]
Piłsudski had given Poland something akin to what [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s [[Onufry Zagłoba]] had mused about: a Polish [[Oliver Cromwell]]. As such, the Marshal had inevitably drawn both intense loyalty and intense vilification.<ref name="TT_NGP"/><ref name="Goldfarb">[[Jeffrey C.

After [[World War II]], relatively little of Piłsudski's thought influenced the policies of the [[Polish People's Republic]], a ''de facto'' [[satellite state|satellite]] of the [[Soviet Union]].
Piłsudski was either ignored or condemned by the communist government — a fact that only served to increase his popularity with the people.

After the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]], Piłsudski came to be publicly acknowledged as a [[national hero]].<ref name="Roshwald"/> On the sixtieth anniversary of his death, on [[May 12]], [[1995]], Poland's [[Sejm]] issued a statement: "Józef Piłsudski will remain, in our nation's memory, the founder of its independence and the victorious leader who fended off a foreign assault that threatened the whole of Europe and its civilization. Józef Piłsudski served his country well and has entered our history forever."<ref name="Sejm1995">Translation of OŚWIADCZENIE SEJMU RZECZYPOSPOLITEJ POLSKIEJ z dnia 12 maja 1995 r. w sprawie uczczenia 60 rocznicy śmierci Marszałka Józefa Piłsudskiego.

This declaration was consonant with President [[Ignacy Mościcki|Mościcki's]] words at Piłsudski's 1935 funeral: "He was the king of our hearts and the sovereign of our will. During a half-century of his life’s travails, he captured heart after heart, soul after soul, until he had drawn the whole of Poland within the purple of his royal spirit... He gave Poland freedom, boundaries, power and respect."<ref name="Mość">Translation of Mościcki's speech from 1935. For Polish original online, see Piotr M.

After [[World War I]], about the time of the [[Polish-Soviet War]] (1919-21), [[Joseph Conrad]] had said of Piłsudski: "He was the only great man to emerge on the scene during the war [World War I]." Conrad had added, "In some aspects he is not unlike [[Napoleon]], but as a type of man he is superior. Because Napoleon, his genius apart, was like all other people and Piłsudski is different."<ref>[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Conrad under Familial Eyes'', Cambridge University Press, 1984, ISBN 052125082X, p. 239.</ref>

One of Poland's most brilliant 20th-century military commanders, Piłsudski has lent his name to several military units, including the [[Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division|1st Legions Infantry Division]] and armored train Nr. 51 ("''I Marszałek''").<ref name="PIBWL">[http://derela.republika.pl/marszal.htm Polish Armoured Train Nr. 51 ("I Marszałek")].

==Names==
As a young man, Piłsudski belonged to various underground organizations and used a variety of [[pseudonym]]s, including "''Wiktor''," "''Mieczysław''" and "''Ziuk''." Later he was often affectionately called "''Dziadek''" ("Grandpa" or "the Old Man") and "''Marszałek''" ("the Marshal"). His ex-soldiers also referred to him as "''Komendant''" ("the Commandant").

==Relatives==
Józef Piłsudski's notable relatives included his brothers: [[Adam Piłsudski]], a [[politician]]; [[Bronisław Piłsudski]], a noted [[ethnographer]]; [[Jan Piłsudski]], a [[lawyer]] and [[politician]]; and daughter [[Wanda Piłsudska]], who remained in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] after [[World War II]], working as a [[psychiatrist]].
