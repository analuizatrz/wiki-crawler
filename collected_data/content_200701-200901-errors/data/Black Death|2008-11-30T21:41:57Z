The 14th century eruption of the Black Death had a drastic effect on Europe's population, irrevocably changing the social structure. It was a serious blow to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and resulted in widespread persecution of minorities such as [[Antisemitism|Jews]], foreigners, beggars, and [[Leprosy|lepers]]. The uncertainty of daily survival created a general mood of morbidity, influencing people to "live for the moment", as illustrated by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in ''[[The Decameron]]'' (1353).

<blockquote>''"They died by the hundreds, both day and night, and all were thrown in ... ditches and covered with earth. And as soon as those ditches were filled, more were dug. And I, Agnolo di Tura … buried my five children with my own hands … And so many died that all believed it was the end of the world."''</blockquote>

==Naming==
[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] people called the 14th century catastrophe either the "Great Pestilence"' or the "Great Plague".<ref> Judith M. Bennett and C. Warren Hollister, Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), page 327{{cite book|title=|isbn=0072955155|oclc=56615921}}</ref> Writers contemporary to the plague referred to the event as the "Great Mortality".

The term "Black Death" was introduced for the first time in 1833.<ref name=ibid> Ibid. </ref> It has been popularly thought that the name came from a striking late-stage sign of the disease, in which the sufferer's skin would blacken due to subepidermal hemorrhages ([[purpura]]), and the extremities would darken with gangrene ([[acral necrosis]]). However, the term is more likely to refer to black in the sense of glum, lugubrious, or dreadful.<ref>Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, "The Biggest Epidemic of History" (''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'', in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°310, June 2006, pp.38 (article from pp.38 to 49, the whole issue is dedicated to the Black Plague, pp.38–60)</ref>

The Black Death was, according to chronicles, characterized by [[bubo]]es (swellings in lymph nodes), like the late 19th century Asian [[Bubonic plague]]. Scientists and historians at the beginning of the 20th century assumed that the Black Death was an outbreak of the same disease, caused by the [[bacteria|bacterium]] ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' and spread by [[flea]]s with the help of animals like the [[Black Rat]] (''Rattus rattus''). However, this view has recently been questioned by some scientists and historians.<ref>Kelly, John (2005).

==Plague migration==
{{main|Black Death migration}}
[[Image:Bubonic plague-en.svg|thumb|The Black Death rapidly spread along the major European sea and land trade routes.]]

The plague disease, originally thought to be caused by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', is [[enzootic]] (commonly present) in populations of ground [[rodent]]s in [[Central Asia]], but it is not entirely clear where the 14th century pandemic started. The popular theory places the first cases in the [[steppe]]s of Central Asia, although some speculate that it originated around northern India, and others, such as the historian Michael W. Dols, argue that the historical evidence concerning epidemics in the Mediterranean and specifically the [[Plague of Justinian]] point to a probability that the Black Death originated in Africa and spread to Central Asia, where it then became entrenched among the rodent population.<ref> Michael W. Dols, "The Second Plague Pandemic and Its Recurrences in the Middle East: 1347–1894" ''Journal of the Economic Social History of the Orient''vol. 22 no. 2 (May 1979), 170–171. </ref> Nevertheless, from Central Asia it was carried east and west along the [[Silk Road]], by [[Mongols|Mongol]] armies and traders making use of the opportunities of free passage within the [[Mongol Empire]] offered by the [[Pax Mongolica]]. It was reportedly first introduced to Europe at the trading city of [[Feodosiya|Caffa]] in the [[Crimea]] in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants. The [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] traders fled, bringing the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/a-b/blackdeath.html |title=Channel 4 - History&nbsp;— The Black Death |publisher=Channel4.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref> Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several preexisting conditions such as [[war]], [[famine]], and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death. In China, the thirteenth century [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol conquest]] disrupted farming and trading, and led to widespread famine.  The population dropped from approximately 120 to 60&nbsp;million.<ref>Ping-ti Ho, "An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China", in ''Études Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970) pp. 33–53.</ref> The 14th century  plague is estimated to have killed 1/3 of the population of China.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-03|url=http://chip.med.nyu.edu/course/view.php?id=13&topic=1|title=Plague |publisher=Center for Health Information Preparedness }}</ref>

In Europe, the [[Medieval Warm Period]] ended sometime towards the end of the thirteenth century, bringing harsher winters and reduced harvests. In the years 1315 to 1317 a catastrophic [[List of famines|famine]], known as the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]], struck much of [[North-West Europe]]. The famine came about as the result of a large population growth in the previous centuries, with the result that, in the early fourteenth century the population began to exceed the number that could be sustained by productive capacity of the land and farmers.<ref> Judith M. Bennett and C. Warren Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), 326{{cite book|title=|isbn=0072955155|oclc=56615921}}</ref>

In Northern Europe, new technological innovations such as the heavy plough and the [[Crop rotation|three-field system]] were not as effective in clearing new fields for harvest as they were in the Mediterranean because the north had poor, clay-like, soil.<ref name=ibid/>  Food shortages and skyrocketing prices were a fact of life for as much as a century before the plague. Wheat, oats, hay, and consequently livestock, were all in short supply, and their scarcity resulted in hunger and malnutrition. The result was a mounting human vulnerability to disease, due to weakened immune systems.

The European economy entered a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] in which hunger and chronic, low-level debilitating disease reduced the [[productivity]] of labourers, and so the grain output was reduced, causing grain prices to increase. This situation was worsened when landowners and monarchs like [[Edward III of England]] (r. 1327–1377) and [[Philip VI of France]] (r. 1328–1350), out of a fear that their comparatively high standard of living would decline, raised the fines and rents of their tenants.<ref> Ibid., 327. </ref> Standards of living then fell drastically, diets grew more limited, and Europeans as a whole experienced more health problems.

In the autumn of 1314, heavy rains began to fall, which led to several years of cold and wet winters. The already weak harvests of the north suffered and the seven-year famine ensued. The Great Famine was the worst in European history, reducing the population by at least ten percent.<ref name=ibid/>  Records recreated from [[dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] studies show a hiatus in building construction during the period, as well as a deterioration in climate.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Slice Through Time|first=Mike|last=Baillie|page=p124|year=1997|isbn=978–0713476545}}</ref>

This was the economic and social situation in which the predictor of the coming disaster, a [[typhoid fever|typhoid]] (Infected Water) epidemic, emerged. Many thousands died in populated urban centres, most significantly [[Ypres]]. In 1318  a pestilence of unknown origin, sometimes identified as [[anthrax]], targeted the animals of Europe, notably sheep and cattle, further reducing the food supply and income of the peasantry.

==Causes of the bubonic infection==
{{main|Causes of the Black Death}}
[[Image:Yersinia pestis fluorescent.jpeg|thumb|right|''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' seen at 2000x magnification.

Several possible causes exist that might have led to the Black Death; the most prevalent is the [[Bubonic plague]] theory. Plague and the ecology of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' in soil, and in rodent and (possibly and importantly) human [[parasitism|ectoparasite]]s are reviewed and summarized by Michel Drancourt in  modeling  sporadic, limited, and large plague outbreaks.<ref>{{cite web

An interesting hypothesis about the [[epidemiology]]—the appearance, spread, and especially disappearance—of plague from Europe is that the flea-bearing rodent reservoir of disease was eventually succeeded by another species. The [[Black Rat]] (''Rattus rattus'') was originally introduced from Asia to Europe by trade, but was subsequently displaced and succeeded throughout Europe by the bigger [[Brown Rat]] (''Rattus norvegicus''). The brown rat was not as prone to transmit the germ-bearing fleas to humans in large die-offs due to a different rat ecology.<ref>Appleby, Andrew B. "The Disappearance of the Plague: A Continuing Puzzle", Economic History Review 33, 2 (1980) 161–173</ref><ref>Slack, Paul. “The Disappearance of the Plague: An Alternative View.” Economic History Review 34, 3 (1981) 469–476.</ref> The dynamic complexities of rat ecology, [[herd immunity]] in that reservoir, interaction with human ecology, secondary transmission routes between humans with or without fleas, human herd immunity, and changes in each might explain the eruption, dissemination, and re-eruptions of plague that continued for centuries until its (even more) unexplained disappearance.

===Signs and symptoms===
The three forms of plague brought an array of signs and symptoms to those infected.  The septicaemic plague is a form of "blood poisoning," and pneumonic plague is an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body. The classic sign of bubonic plague was the appearance of [[bubo]]es in the groin, the neck, and armpits, which oozed pus and bled. Most victims died within four to seven days after infection. When the plague reached Europe, it first struck port cities and then followed the trade routes, both by sea and land.

The [[bubonic plague]] was the most commonly seen form during the Black Death, with a [[mortality rate]] of thirty to seventy-five percent and symptoms including [[fever]] of 38–41 °[[Celsius|C]] (101–105 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]), [[headache]]s, painful aching joints, [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], and a general feeling of [[malaise]]. Of those who contracted the bubonic plague, 4 out of 5 died within eight days.<ref>Rebecca Totaro, ''Suffering in Paradise: The Bubonic Plague in English Literature from More to Milton'', (Pittsburgh: Duquense University Press: 2005), p. 26.</ref> [[Pneumonic plague]] was the second most commonly seen form during the Black Death, with a [[mortality rate]] of ninety to ninety-five percent. Symptoms included fever, cough, and blood-tinged [[sputum]]. As the disease progressed, sputum became free flowing and bright red. [[Septicemic plague]] was the least common of the three forms, with a [[mortality rate]] close to one hundred percent. Symptoms were high fevers and purple skin patches ([[purpura]] due to [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation|DIC]]).

David Herlihy<ref>Herlihy, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'' (1997) Harvard University Press: Cambridge, MA, p. 29.</ref> identifies another potential sign of the plague: freckle-like spots and rashes.  Sources from Viterbo, Italy refer to "the signs which are vulgarly called ''lenticulae''", a word which bears resemblance to the Italian word for freckles, ''lentiggini''.  These are not the swellings of buboes, but rather "darkish points or pustules which covered large areas of the body".



==A Malthusian crisis==
In addition, various historians have adopted yet another theory for the cause of the Black Plague, one that points to social, agricultural, and sometimes economic causes.  Often known as the [[malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian limit]], scholars use this term to express, and/or explain, certain tragedies throughout history.  In his 1798 ''Essay on the Principle of Population'', [[Thomas Malthus]] asserted that eventually humans would reproduce so greatly that they would go beyond the limits of food supplies; once they reached this point, some sort of "reckoning" was inevitable.  While the Black Death may appear to be a "reckoning" of this sort, it was in fact an external, unpredictable factor and does not therefore fit into the Malthusian theory.  In his book, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'', [[David Herlihy]] explores this idea of plague as an inevitable crisis wrought on humanity in order to control the population and human resources. In the book ''The Black Death; A Turning Point in History?'' (ed. William M. Bowsky) he writes “implies that the Black Death’s pivotal role in late medieval society... was now being challenged.  Arguing on the basis of a neo-Malthusian economics, revisionist historians recast the Black Death as a necessary and long overdue corrective to an overpopulated Europe.”

Herlihy examines the arguments against the Malthusian crisis, stating “if the Black Death was a response to excessive human numbers it should have arrived several decades earlier” due to the population growth of years before the outbreak of the Black Death. Herlihy also brings up other, biological factors that argue against the plague as a "reckoning" by arguing “the role of famines in affecting population movements is also problematic.  The many famines preceding the Black Death, even the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|‘great hunger’ of 1314 to 1317]], did not result in any appreciable reduction in population levels”. Herlihy concludes the matter stating, “the medieval experience shows us not a Malthusian crisis but a stalemate, in the sense that the community was maintaining at stable levels very large numbers over a lengthy period”  and states that the phenomenon should be referred to as more of a deadlock, rather than a crisis, to describe Europe before the epidemics.

==Consequences==
{{main|Consequences of the Black Death}}

Figures for the [[infectious disease#historic pandemics|death toll]] vary widely by area and from source to source as new research and discoveries come to light. It killed an estimated 75–200 million people in the 14th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/29/2149185.htm |title=Black death 'discriminated' between victims (ABC News in Science) |publisher=Abc.net.au |author=ABC/Reuters |date=Tuesday, 29 January 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1576875.stm |title=BBC News &#124; HEALTH &#124; De-coding the Black Death |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=Wednesday, 3 October, 2001, 21:51 GMT 22:51 UK |accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2001/10/47288 |title=Black Death's Gene Code Cracked |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref> According to medieval historian [[Philip Daileader]] in 2007:<ref>[[Philip Daileader]], ''The Late Middle Ages'', audio/video course produced by [[The Teaching Company]], 2007.

<blockquote>The trend of recent research is pointing to a figure more like 45% to 50% of the European population dying during a four-year period. There is a fair amount of geographic variation. In Mediterranean Europe and Italy, the South of France and Spain, where plague ran for about four years consecutively, it was probably closer to 80% to 75% of the population. In Germany and England . . . it was probably closer to 20%.</blockquote>

[[Image:Plague victims blessed by priest.jpg|thumb|Monks, disfigured by the plague, being blessed by a priest. England, 1360–75]]

The [[government]]s of Europe had no apparent response to the crisis because no one knew its cause or how it spread. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as fifty percent of the population to die. Europeans living in isolated areas suffered less, and monasteries and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for the Black Death's victims.<ref> Judith M. Bennett and C. Warren Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), page 329{{cite book|title=|isbn=0072955155|oclc=56615921}}</ref> Because fourteenth century healers were at a loss to explain the cause, Europeans turned to astrological forces, earthquakes, and the poisoning of wells by Jews as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.<ref name=ibid/> No one in the fourteenth century considered rat control a way to ward off the plague, and people began to believe only God's anger could produce such horrific displays. There were many attacks against Jewish communities. In August of 1349, the Jewish communities of [[Mainz]] and [[Cologne]] were exterminated. In February of that same year, Christians murdered two thousand Jews in [[Strasbourg]].<ref> Ibid., 329–330.</ref> Where government authorities were concerned, most [[monarchy|monarchs]] instituted measures that prohibited exports of foodstuffs, condemned [[underground economy|black market]] [[speculators]], set [[price controls]] on grain, and outlawed large-scale fishing. At best, they proved mostly unenforceable, and at worst they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral. The hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain abroad: from France because of the prohibition, and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labour. Any grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by [[piracy|pirates]] or [[looters]] to be sold on the black market. Meanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and Scotland, had been at war, using up much of their [[treasury]] and exacerbating [[inflation]]. In 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Malnutrition, poverty, disease and hunger, coupled with war, growing inflation and other economic concerns made Europe in the mid-fourteenth century ripe for tragedy.

[[Image:Burning Jews.jpg|thumb|Jews are burnt alive.]]

As previously mentioned in reference to the plague's sociocultural impacts, renewed religious fervor and fanaticism bloomed in the wake of the Black Death. Some Christians targeted "various groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims",<ref> David Nirenberg, ''Communities of Violence'', op.cit. </ref> lepers<ref>R.I. Moore ''The Formation of a Persecuting Society'', Oxford, 1987 ISBN 0-631-17145-2</ref><ref>David Nirenberg, ''Communities of Violence'', 1998, ISBN 0-691-05889-X</ref> and [[Roma people|Roma]], thinking that they were to blame for the crisis. [[Leprosy|Lepers]], and other individuals with skin diseases such as [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or [[psoriasis]], were singled out and exterminated throughout Europe.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} Anyone with leprosy was believed to show an outward sign of a defect of the soul.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} Differences in cultural and lifestyle practices also led to persecution. Because Jews had a religious obligation to be ritually clean they did not use water from public wells and so were suspected of causing the plague by deliberately poisoning the wells. Christian mobs attacked Jewish settlements across Europe; by 1351, sixty major and 150 smaller Jewish communities had been destroyed, and more than 350 separate massacres had occurred. This persecution reflected more than ethnic hatred. In many places, attacking Jews was a way to criticize the monarchs who protected them (Jews were under the protection of the king, and often called the "royal treasure"){{Fact|date=October 2007}}, and monarchic fiscal policies, which were often administered by Jews.

[[Image:Flagellants.png|thumb|Flagellants practiced self-flogging (whipping of oneself) to atone for sins. The movement became popular after general disillusionment with the church's reaction to the Black Death]]

The Black Death led to cynicism toward religious officials who could not keep their promises of curing plague victims and banishing the disease. No one, the Church included, was able to cure or accurately explain the reasons for the plague outbreaks. One theory of transmission was that it spread through air, and was referred to as [[Miasma theory of disease|''miasma'']], or 'bad air'. This increased doubt in the [[clergy|clergy's]] abilities. Extreme alienation with the Church culminated in either support for different religious groups such as the [[flagellant]]s, which from their late 13th century beginnings grew tremendously during the opening years of the Black Death, and later to a pursuit of pleasure and hedonism. It was a common belief at the time that the plague was due to God's wrath, caused by the sins of mankind; In response, the flagellants travelled from town to town, whipping themselves in an effort to mimic the sufferings of Jesus prior to his crucifixion. Originating in Germany, several miraculous tales emerged from their efforts, such as a child being revived from the dead, and a talking cow. These stories further fuelled the belief that the flagellants were more effective than church leaders. It may have been that the flagellant's later involvement in hedonism was an effort to accelerate or absorb God's wrath, to shorten the time with which others suffered. More likely, the focus of attention and popularity of their cause contributed to a sense that the world itself was ending, and that their individual actions were of no consequence.

==Black Death in contemporary literature==
{{main|Black Death in contemporary culture}}

The Black Death dominated art and literature throughout the generation that experienced it. Much of the most useful manifestations of the Black Death in literature, to historians, comes from the accounts of its chroniclers; contemporary accounts are often the only real way to get a sense of the horror of living through a disaster on such a scale. A few of these chroniclers were famous writers, philosophers and rulers (like [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]]). Their writings, however, did not reach the majority of the European population. For example, Petrarch's work was read mainly by wealthy nobles and merchants of Italian city-states. He wrote hundreds of letters and vernacular poetry of great distinction and passed on to later generations a revised interpretation of [[courtly love]].<ref> Judith M. Bennett and C. Warren Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), page 372{{cite book|title=|isbn=0072955155|oclc=56615921}}</ref> There was, however, one [[troubadour]], writing in the [[Lyric poetry|lyric style]] long out of fashion, who was active in 1348. [[Peire Lunel de Montech]] composed the sorrowful ''[[sirventes]]'' "Meravilhar no·s devo pas las gens" during the height of the plague in [[Toulouse]].
