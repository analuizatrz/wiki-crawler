A '''chiton''' was a piece of clothing in the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] world. It was made of two sheets of light drapery and worn directly over the body. A belt, usually under the breast ("high-girded") or around the waist ("low-girded") helped contain it. Double-girded were also fashionable. The chiton was often worn in combination with the heavier [[himation]], which had the role of a cloak.

It was the outfit of [[Aphrodite]] because it was considered very feminine. Men also wore it. [[Dionysus]] is often drawn wearing it. Poets and male artists also wore it.

When used alone (without a himation), the chiton was called ''monochiton''.

A large belt, called the ''zoster'' could be worn over the chiton.

The chiton was also worn by the Romans.
