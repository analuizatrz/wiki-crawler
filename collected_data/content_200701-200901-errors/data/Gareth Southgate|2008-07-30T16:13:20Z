'''Gareth Southgate''' (born [[3 September]] [[1970]] in [[Watford]] near [[London]], [[England]]) is a former [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] player. He is currently manager of English [[Premier League]] side {{fc|Middlesbrough}}. 

His highest achievements in the sport were winning the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] with {{fc|Aston Villa}} and Middlesbrough. He also reached an [[FA Cup]] and [[UEFA Cup]] final as a player, and made 57 appearances for the [[England national football team|England national team]]. His playing career ended in May 2006 after he was appointed Middlesbrough manager.

==Club career==
===Crystal Palace===
Born in [[Watford]], [[Hertfordshire]], Southgate began his career at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], playing in central [[midfield]]. He became [[captain (football)|captain]] and led the club to the 1994 [[Football League Division One|Division One]] title. After the south-London club's relegation from the [[Premier League]], he moved to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for a fee of £2.5 million pounds, having made 151 appearances over four seasons.

===Aston Villa===
At Aston Villa, he was converted into a [[defender (football)|centre-back]] and was part of a formidable defence. In his first season, he lifted the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and Aston Villa qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]]. Southgate played in every Premier League game during the [[1998-99 in English football|1998–99]] season. He continued to play for Villa in the [[1999-00 in English football|1999–2000]] season as Villa reached the [[FA Cup Final 2000|FA Cup Final]], but handed in a transfer request just before [[Euro 2000]] citing a desire to move in order to "achieve in [his] career".<ref>{{cite news

| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/euro2000/teams/england/782259.stm
| publisher = BBC Sport
| date = [[2000-06-08]]
| accessdate = 2008-02-26}}</ref> [[John Gregory]], the then manager of Villa, attempted to keep his club captain but after a year on the transfer list he left the club in 2001.

===Middlesbrough===
Southgate did not sign for one of the major clubs as many predicted but instead became [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] manager [[Steve McClaren]]'s first signing for the club. This may have partially been due to the opportunity to reunite his defensive pairing with [[Ugo Ehiogu]] with whom he was a centre-back at Villa. Immediately he became a firm favourite at the [[Riverside Stadium|Riverside]], winning the club's Player of the Year award in his first season after a series of assured displays whilst receiving no yellow cards.

Southgate was handed the captaincy for the [[2002-03 in English football|2002–03]] season when [[Paul Ince]] left the club and became the first Middlesbrough captain to lift a major trophy when he helped them win the Carling Cup at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in February 2004. His season ended shortly after that win, when he suffered knee ligament damage. 

There were strong rumours that Southgate could be set for a move to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] following [[Rio Ferdinand]]'s ban for missing a drug test in January 2004,<ref>{{cite news

His final appearance as a professional player was in the [[UEFA Cup]] final against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], which Boro lost [[2006 UEFA Cup Final|4–0]].

==International career==
Southgate made his debut for [[England national football team|England]] as a substitute against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in December 1995. He was then named in [[Terry Venables]]' squad for [[1996 European Football Championship|Euro 1996]] on home soil. At the European championship, Southgate played a towering role in England's charge to the semi-finals. However, Southgate's saved penalty against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the semi-final sent the hosts crashing out. The song ''Southgate (Euro '96)'' by [[The Business (band)|The Business]] is a reference to this famous sporting event. Southgate managed to make light of his blunder by appearing in an advert for [[Pizza Hut]] which also featured Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle who had also missed crucial penalties. 

Southgate also played in the [[Football World Cup 1998|1998 World Cup]] and [[2000 European Football Championship|Euro 2000]]. He had won 57 England [[cap (football)|caps]] and was disappointed not to add to the figure during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] finals in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]. However, in the penultimate warm-up game ahead of the finals he captained England for the second half of a 1–1 draw with South Korea. His 50th cap came in a 1–1 draw with Portugal at [[Villa Park, England|Villa Park]] in September 2002.

==Management career==
Southgate was handed his first managerial role at Middlesbrough in June 2006 after McClaren had left to manage England. His appointment drew controversy as he did not have the required coaching qualifications (the [[UEFA Pro Licence]]) to manage a top-flight club.<ref>{{cite news
| title = Southgate appointed as Boro boss

| accessdate = 2008-02-26}}</ref> He was allowed to stay on as manager, despite not possessing the required qualifications, by the Premier League in November 2006; Middlesbrough successfully argued that, because Southgate had recently been an international player, he did not have the opportunity to undertake the coaching courses.<ref>{{cite news

In his first season in charge, Southgate guided Middlesbrough to finish 12<sup>th</sup> in the Premier League. His biggest win so far as a manager was a 8–1 victory against {{fc|Manchester City}} in May 2008. He was also rated by {{fc|Arsenal}} manager [[Arsène Wenger]] as being "good enough" to be England manager in December 2007.<ref>{{cite news

==Other roles==
During the [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] season he became an author, penning ''Woody & Nord: A Football Friendship'' with close friend and former West Ham goalkeeping coach [[Andy Woodman]]. This book describes an enduring friendship forged in the Crystal Palace youth team that has survived Southgate and Woodman's wildly differing fortunes in the professional game. The book won the Sporting Book of the Year Award for 2004 from the National Sporting Club.

Southgate was also a co-commentator for ITV at the 2006 World Cup, covering group games alongside [[Clive Tyldesley]]. His appointment as Middlesbrough manager two days before the start of the tournament meant that he left Germany before the knockout phase commenced, with [[David Pleat]] replacing him as Tyldesley's co-commentator.

In 2005 Southgate became a published poet, with a contribution to the collection ''Roary & Friends''.<ref>{{Citation

===Personal life===
Southgate is the father of two children with his wife Allison.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/sport/2006/10/16/sfnmid16.xml Southgate's new look has desired effect - Football News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title , although they have recently split.-->]</ref><ref>[http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/06/50763.htm?WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished TheFA.com - Father figure<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Controversy===

In 1998 Southgate endorsed Bull Boys Shoes in a television advertisement. The advert caused controversy by implying that Gareth had personally autographed every free football received as part of purchase, when in fact the autographs were printed. Complaints about the advert being misleading to youngsters were upheld.<ref>[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/complaints_reports/advertising_complaints/show_complaint.asp-ad_complaint_id=15.html Television Advertising Complaints Reports]</ref> The advert also claimed that Southgate was "Champion of the English National Football Team" although no criteria for why he personally held this title above other teamates was ever supplied.
