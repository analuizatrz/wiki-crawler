== History ==
===Foundation===
[[Image:PLCFernlea1888.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Fernlea, PLC's first home in Ashfield, ''c.'' 1888]]
In 1883 the [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|General Assembly]] of the Presbyterian Church of NSW formed a special committee to investigate a proposal to establish [[boarding school]]s for girls and for boys, to provide Presbyterian alternatives to the proliferating number of [[Roman Catholic]] [[secondary school]]s in the colony.<ref name="GH1"/> The Minister at [[Richmond, New South Wales|Richmond]], Rev James Cameron stated: 
"Presbyterians should take prompt action because the Popish party, seeing the want that was felt throughout the colony in regard to higher education, has stepped in to supply that want, and if Protestants did not look to the matter, the Roman Catholics would take advantage of them."<ref name="GH1"/> The General Assembly was also inspired to establish a school, particularly a Ladies' College, by less worthy motives. Other [[Protestant]] denominations in NSW had recently established their own Ladies' Colleges, and the neigbouring colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] had maintained a Presbyterian Ladies' College since 1875, and so it was felt that NSW Presbyterians should also have one.<ref name="GH1"/> At the 1884 Assembly the Committee announced that while a boys' school was not needed, the secondary education options available to girls were not satisfactory, and they recommended that a Ladies' College, similar to the [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne]], be established as soon as possible.<ref name="GH1"/>
[[Image:JohnMarden.jpg|right|thumb|150px|PLC's first Principal, Dr John Marden]]

A Ladies' College Committee was formed and by July 1887 they had leased a property in [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]]. For [[Principal (school)|Principal]], they unanimously selected [[John Marden|Dr. John Marden]], a [[science]] master from the [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies' College]] (MLC) in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]], "because of his high academic standing, his experience and success in teaching and his high Christian character".<ref name="GH9">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = p. 9| chapter = Firm Foundations 1888-1919}}</ref> Marden was a strong believer in [[equal opportunity]] in education, and has been described as an "early feminist".<ref name="SMH1988">{{cite news| title = The Girls of PLC have made history| url = http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=%22presbyterian+ladies+college%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=author&sf=headline&sf=text&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news880406_0250_8026| work = Northern Herald| publisher = ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' | page = 26| date = 1988-04-06| accessdate = 2007-09-12}}</ref> He rejected the idea that PLC was to be merely a [[finishing school]] for the daughters of the wealthy,<ref name="GH18"/> and was once quoted as saying: 
<blockquote> 
I am ... out of sympathy with the cry that education is unnecessary for girls, and that all they require is a few accomplishments. Women have also to live their life - in most cases a harder one than men have. This notion of accomplishments being sufficient for girls is surely a remnant of those barbarous days when women were looked on as the plaything of men.<ref name="GH18">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = p.18| chapter = Firm Foundations 1888-1919}}</ref> 
</blockquote> 

The Presbyterian Ladies' College was finally opened by Marden and lady [[superintendent (education)|superintendent]], Ms M. McCormick,<ref name="ADBMarden"/> on [[30 January]] [[1888]], with 39&nbsp;girls. It was modelled on the [[Public Schools Act 1868|great English Public Schools]],<ref name="GH29"/> and was the first school to be established by the Presbyterian Church of New South Wales.<ref name="GHvii"/> Together with the Committee, Marden was responsible for organising the [[curriculum]] and hiring the appropriate staff.<ref name=Principals/>
<!--[[Image:PLC1891.jpg|thumb||right|250px|Basketball Team, 1902]]-->
During the opening ceremony the Governor invited his wife, the [[Countess]] of Jersey, Margaret Child-Villiers, to speak. She made what the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' described as a "capital impromptu speech".<ref name="GH29"/> The Countess' speech was widely reported throughout Australia and elsewhere around the world, as at the time it was quite unusual for a woman to speak in public.<ref name="GH29"/> PLC's Jersey Day, an annual event in which [[Alumni|ex-students]] return to the College on the Sunday closest to [[10 March]], is named in honour of the Countess.<ref name="Jersey">{{Citation | title=Jersey Day and its Origin | newspaper=The Ex-students' Union News: The Annual Newsletter of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney Ex-students' Union| issue=75 | pages=1 | year=2006 | date=September 2006}}</ref>

===Growth===
[[Image:Croydon Shubra Hall PLC.JPG|230px|thumb|left|PLC Main School, built 1890]]
In the early years at Croydon, girls tended to be enrolled at an older age, typically over fourteen. It was apparent that despite Marden's insistence, many parents viewed the College as a finishing school. As today, it was not a requirement for students to be Presbyterians, and early school records indicate there were a number of Roman Catholic and [[Jewish]] students. By 1900 the reputation of the school had spread, and pupils were starting to come from a wider geographic area, including [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Northern Territory]], [[Western Australia]], [[Queensland]] and [[South Australia]].<ref name=GH24>{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp.24-26| chapter = Firm Foundations 1888-1919}}</ref>

[[Image:PLCSketch1935.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Sketch of PLC, featuring gardens and the Shubra Hall and Main School towers, ''c.'' 1935]]
The increase in enrolments also convinced the Council of the need to set up a branch school on another site, preferably on the [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]]. In 1913 Marden reported that many applications were being refused because of "shortness of space."<ref name="GH29"/> The Assembly approved the establishment of a branch at [[Pymble, New South Wales|Pymble]] and gave the Council of PLC Croydon Â£5,000 to erect new buildings and lay out the grounds. The [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Pymble]] was opened on [[8 February]] [[1916]] with 48 day girls and 86 boarders. Marden became the Principal of both schools. The opening of the Pymble campus necessitated a change of name for the Croydon College, from The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney to The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon.<ref name="GH29"/>

Marden retired at the end of 1919 and a Principal was appointed to each branch. [[Ewen Neil McQueen|Dr E. Neil McQueen]], a prominent educational innovator who had previously been the Vice-Principal of the two schools, became the second Principal of PLC Croydon.<ref name="GH29"/>

===Second World War===
[[Image:PLC War time 1942.jpg|260px|thumb|right|Advertisement for PLC at its temporary residence in Strathfield, 1942]]
In 1942, the new Principal, Dr Helen Wilkie, arrived to find falling enrolments, staffing problems and food shortages due to the effects of the [[Second World War]]. Word was soon received that [[Australian military]] authorities wished to inspect the school with a view to taking it over. On [[24 March]] [[1942]], it was requested that PLC be occupied by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) for the purpose of establishing a top secret [[Radar|Radar Unit]] and military [[barracks]] known as No.1 RIMU (Radio Installation and Maintenance Unit).<ref name="GH89">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 89&ndash;98| chapter =War And Disruption 1942-1945}}</ref><ref name="Radar">{{Citation | last=Bellamy |first=Craig |publication-date=March 2007 |year=2007 |title=Tributes: Frank Cooper |periodical=Radar Returns: Signals & Echoes For RAAF Radar Veterans |publication-place=Hampton, Victoria |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=p. 3 |url=http://www.radarreturns.net.au/assets/issues/rrvol12no1.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> In order to accommodate PLC's students and classes, the Council approached [[Meriden School]] in [[Strathfield, New South Wales|Strathfield]]. Meriden agreed to house the boarders and the singing, [[domestic science]], and physical education classes. PLC also purchased Lingwood, a property in Strathfield, as a centre for the school's remaining activities.<ref name="GH89"/>

At the end of 1942, the Meriden authorities indicated that they could no longer house the PLC boarders, so Lauriston (now the primary school of [[Santa Sabina College]]) and Welbeck, on The Boulevarde at Strathfield, were rented for them. In July 1944 the Council agreed to purchase Lingwood to house a Kindergarten [[feeder school]] for the College, or as a site for a permanent move. A few months later the Council decided that the future of PLC lay in Strathfield. The Croydon campus was offered to the military for Â£36,500 and plans were made to purchase Welbeck and Lauriston to form the new PLC. 
[[Image:Strathfield Santa Maria Del Monte Lauriston.JPG|220px|thumb|left|Lauriston, Part of PLC's war-time Strathfield Campus]]
The Council's preference for Strathfield as a permanent location for the school was not shared by most of the school community,<ref name="GH89"/> and after an intervention by the Education Trust of the NSW General Assembly it was decided that PLC would reopen once again at Croydon in first [[Academic term|term]] 1946. The military agreed to pay for the extensive renovations that were required, with the final cheque handed over by the government on [[21 March]] [[1949]]. Lauriston and Welbeck were disposed of in 1946, but the Lingwood property was retained as a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]]. The Council negotiated with Margaret Thompson, the owner and principal of Branxton, a [[private school]] in Strathfield, about moving her school to the Lingwood property, where it would retain the name Branxton and come under the control of the PLC Council.{{Ref_label|b|b|none}}<ref name="GH89"/>

Evidence of PLC's war-time occupation remain, with tunnels and [[bomb shelter]]s accessible from below the stage of College Hall. A [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] presented to the school by the RAAF, in commemoration of PLC's war-time involvement, can be found on the school [[Verandah]] at the entrance to the Main School.<ref name="GH89"/>

===Modern day===
In 1977, a [[Basis of Union (Uniting Church in Australia)|Union]] of the [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Methodist]] and Presbyterian Churches took place, forming the [[Uniting Church of Australia]]. Approximately half of the Presbyterian Church decided to remain Presbyterian, and consequently the property of the Church had to be divided. In May of that year it was announced that PLC Croydon was to remain Presbyterian and PLC Pymble would be transferred, with its name changed to Pymble Ladies' College. Then in 1978 it was decided that PLC Croydon should return to its original name: The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney.<ref name="GH129">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = p. 129| chapter =Preparation For Expansion 1977-1985}}</ref>

[[Image:PLCSyd120years.jpg|right|thumb|100px|PLC Sydney 120&nbsp;Year Anniversary Logo]]
In late August 2005, due to financial troubles at the [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Armidale]], it was announced that PLC Armidale and PLC Sydney would join to form an alliance, with both schools coming under the executive leadership of Dr William McKeith, the Principal of PLC Sydney. Members of the PLC Armidale Council formed part of the new joint school Council, essentially making the two PLC's true [[sister school]]s.<ref name=pcnsw>{{Citation| last=Falls| first=Jeof| publication-date=September-October| year=2005| title=New Partnership between PLC Armidale and PLC Sydney| periodical=Church Offices Newsletter| publication-place=Surry Hills| publisher=The Presbyterian Church in New South Wales| issue=288| pages=3| url=http://pcnsw.org.au/LocalSite/pdf/newsletters/SepOct2005.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> 

The aim of this alliance is to strengthen PLC Armidale through cooperative marketing, a change in management, and a stronger financial base. It is also meant to benefit both schools by providing student exchanges, accommodations for sporting events or [[excursion]]s, and an additional "country or city" option to prospective students. Both schools will maintain their separate identities in order to preserve the unique histories and traditions that both have developed over many years.<ref name=pcnsw/> PLC celebrates their 120th anniversary in 2008 and to mark the occasion the College has commissioned a limited edition commemorative coffee table book, ''PLC Sydney 1888-2008: A Photographic Essay''.<ref name=120years>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public/newsletter/pubnewsletter.pdf |title=Celebrating 120 Years of Excellence |accessdate=2008-01-29 |date =2007-11-29 |format=PDF |work=PLC Connections |publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College}}</ref>

The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney, initially opened on [[30 January]] [[1888]], at Fernlea, a 14-room gentleman's residence set on {{convert|1.21|ha|acre|0}} in Ashfield.<ref name="GH1">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = p. 1&ndash;4| chapter = Genesis 1883-1887}}</ref> But by August they had already outgrown this location, so they purchased Shubra Hall, the home of department store owner [[Anthony Hordern & Sons|Anthony Hordern III]] at Croydon, for Â£7,500. Plans were drawn up for the additional buildings required, and Marden worked closely with the [[architect]], Albert Bond. Marden was responsible for most of the ideas for the new buildings, based on those he had seen at MLC Melbourne.<ref name="GH29"/> Keenly interested in [[horticulture]], he also laid out gardens and [[playing field]]s.<ref name="ADBMarden">{{cite encyclopedia| last = Dougan| first = Alan| encyclopedia = Australian Dictionary of Biography| title = Marden, John (1855 - 1924)| url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100396b.htm?hilite=John%3BMarden| accessdate = 2007-08-10 | edition = Online| year = 1986| publisher = Melbourne University Press| volume = 10| location = Melbourne, Vic. | pages = pp.407-408}}</ref> By the beginning of the 1891 school year, the new site was complete and ready for furnishing as the permanent home of PLC.

''The Presbyterian'' reported the opening of the College on [[10 March]] [[1891]], by the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor of NSW]], the [[Victor Child-Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey|Rt Hon Victor Albert George, 7th Earl of Jersey]] at its new site: 
<blockquote>
Standing in {{convert|2.43|ha|acre|0}} of ground, laid out in lawn tennis courts, gardens, etc., in an elevated position, it forms, with its tower {{convert|84|ft|m|abbr=on}} [26&nbsp;m] high, a very conspicuous feature in the landscape. The central feature of the building is the tower, and the architectural design of the facade is classic. Altogether the effect is very imposing ... The main staircase window is a work of art well worth seeing. The central window is beautifully designed, and contains two female figures representing Literature and Music.<ref name="GH29">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 29&ndash;37| chapter = Firm Foundations 1888-1919}}</ref>
</blockquote>

By 1902 PLC was running out of space again and Marden urged that new classrooms be built. The Council reluctantly agreed and an extension was made to the Main School, with six classrooms downstairs and 18 rooms upstairs.

On [[24 March]] [[1942]], it was requested that PLC be occupied by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) for the purpose of establishing a top secret [[Radar|Radar Unit]] and military [[barracks]] known as No.1 RIMU (Radio Installation and Maintenance Unit).<ref name="GH89">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 89&ndash;98| chapter =War And Disruption 1942-1945}}</ref><ref name="Radar">{{Citation | last=Bellamy |first=Craig |publication-date=March 2007 |year=2007 |title=Tributes: Frank Cooper |periodical=Radar Returns: Signals & Echoes For RAAF Radar Veterans |publication-place=Hampton, Victoria |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=p. 3 |url=http://www.radarreturns.net.au/assets/issues/rrvol12no1.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> PLC's displaced boarders, and some of the classrooms, found a temporary home at [[Meriden School]] in [[Strathfield, New South Wales|Strathfield]]. The school purchased Lingwood, also in Strathfield, as a centre for the school's remaining activities.<ref name="GH89"/>

At the end of 1942, the Meriden authorities indicated that they could no longer house the PLC boarders, so Lauriston (now the primary school of [[Santa Sabina College]]) and Welbeck, on The Boulevarde at Strathfield, were rented for them. The PLC Council nearly kept the school at Strathfield permanently, but ultimately it was decided that PLC would reopen once again at Croydon in first [[Academic term|term]] 1946. The military agreed to pay for the extensive renovations that were required, Lauriston and Welbeck were disposed of in 1946, and the Lingwood property was retained as a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]].<ref name="GH89"/> Evidence of PLC's war-time occupation remain, with tunnels and [[bomb shelter]]s accessible from below the stage of College Hall. A [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] presented to the school by the RAAF, in commemoration of PLC's war-time involvement, can be found on the school [[Verandah]] at the entrance to the Main School.<ref name="GH89"/>

And so the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney, still sits on a {{convert|5|ha|acre|0}} [[campus]], now adjacent to [[Croydon railway station, Sydney|Croydon Railway Station]] and within 15&nbsp;minutes of the [[Sydney central business district]], [[Sydney University]], and the [[University of Technology, Sydney|University of Technology]].<ref name="AboutPLC"/> Having grown significantly since its foundation, particularly since the 1980s, the school today features a mix of 19th-century and modern buildings, historic landscaped gardens and [[playing field]]s.<ref name=AnnualReport/>

===Special education===
PLC also offers a unique [[special education]] unit catering to students with mild to moderate [[intellectual disabilities]]. The transition programme was developed in 1992 in response to a decision by academic staff to provide a special-needs stream. Through this unit, up to 20 girls between the ages of 11 and 18 are provided with an individual curriculum incorporating mainstream classes where possible.<ref name=Specialneeds>{{cite news| first = Perrie| last = Croshaw| title = Special needs met| url = http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=%22PLC+Sydney%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=10years&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=SMH0702086P6N71NB3U7| work = Supplement| publisher = ''The Sydney Morning Herald''| page = 2| date = 2007-02-08| accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref>

Senior students focus on the Board of Studies Life Skills programme. Girls spend time as residential students in the on-campus Transition House, learning to manage their lives independently. Transition students also run an outdoor cafÃ© to gain small business skills.<ref name=Specialneeds/>

=== Debating and public speaking ===      
One of the strengths of PLC Sydney is their long history of achievement in [[debate|debating]] and [[public speaking]]. The college has competed in the Independent Schools Debating Association (ISDA) for the past five years<ref name=ISDA>{{cite web |url=http://isdadebating.info/schools/schoolsfr.html |title=Participating Schools |accessdate=2007-06-21 |work=Schools |publisher=Independent Schools Debating Association}}</ref> and has had a long-standing commitment to the [[Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools#Archdale Debating Competition|Archdale Debating Competition]].

Students may also participate in the Macquarie Cup and the [[Commonwealth Bank]] Senior Debating, vying with students from a range of [[Public school|public]], [[Catholic school|Catholic]] and independent schools. There are also Social Debates with surrounding schools as well as a regular competition with [[Trinity Grammar School (New South Wales)|Trinity Grammar School]] called the PLC/Trinity Challenge.<ref name="Debating"/>

=== Aid projects ===
The PLC Overseas Aid Fund has been established to enhance the college's work with [[Aid|aid projects]] in [[Developing country|developing countries]], and is an important part of the school's [[Round Square]] membership.<ref name=OverseasAid>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/aid.asp |title=PLC Overseas Aid Fund |accessdate=2007-04-23 |work=Service Learning |publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College }}</ref> Current projects undertaken by the school include the establishment and on-going management of two Kindergartens in [[East Timor]],<ref name=EastTimor>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/east_timor.asp |title=East Timor Project |accessdate=2007-04-23 |work=Service Learning|publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College }}</ref> the management and support of Birla Children's [[Orphanage]] in [[Vietnam]], and the establishment of the "Adopt a School" programme. This programme was developed and is directed by the Principal, Dr McKeith, and matches schools in Australia with schools in [[Sri Lanka]] requiring rebuilding following the 2004 [[Tsunami]]. PLC's school, allocated through this programme, is the Senehasa Counselling, Training and Rehabilitation Centre for Girls.<ref name=AdoptaSchool>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/adopt_a_school.asp |title=Adopt a School |accessdate=2007-04-23 |work=International |publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College}}</ref>

== Fees ==
As with most Australian private schools, PLC receives government funding and therefore only international students pay full fees. For non-international students, 2008 fees range from [[Australian dollar|AU$]]11,360 to $20,150 per year, and more than $32,000 per year for boarding students.<ref name=Fees08/>

PLC Sydney offers [[scholarship]]s and bursaries that provide full or part remission of tuition fees to students who are Australian citizens, Permanent Residents of Australia or refugees. Academic scholarships are based on the results of the [[Australian Council for Educational Research|ACER]] Scholarship Examination, and are typically offered from Year&nbsp;7 onwards. In addition to those awarded for academic performance, PLC also offers music and boarding scholarships. Indigenous Bursaries are available for students of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] or [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] background, and are awarded following an interview with the Principal where the situation of the student and family is considered.<ref name=Scholarships>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/scholarships.asp |title=Scholarships and Bursaries |accessdate=2007-12-26 |work=Enrolment |publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College}}</ref>

== Motto and crest ==

The school [[Coat of arms|crest]] was adopted at a College Council meeting on [[23 August]] [[1888]]. The College Council decided to use the same crest as that used by the [[Presbyterian Church of New South Wales]], with minor modifications.<ref name="GH298"/>

The Church's crest consisted of a shield with the words ''Nec Tamen Consumebatur'' (translated from [[Latin]] as "And yet it was not consumed") surrounding it.<ref name=PresbyterianChurch>{{Citation| year=2004 | title=An Introduction to the Presbyterian Church of Australia | place= Sydney | publisher=Code Committee of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Australia | volume=1 | pages=p. 21 | url=http://www.presbyterian.org.au/PDF/AnIntroductiont%20thePCABooklet.pdf | format=PDF| accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> On the shield were the stars of the [[Southern Cross]], a [[burning bush]], and a [[Latin cross]] in outline. At the base were the [[floral emblem]]s of Scotland, England and Ireland. Surrounding the shield was a border with the words "Presbyterian Church of New South Wales", with a [[Star of David]] placed on top. Behind both shield and borders was the [[Saint Andrew's Cross|cross of St. Andrew]] in blue.<ref name="GH298"/> 
     
The School modified this crest by changing the words "Presbyterian Church of New South Wales" to "Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney", placing a [[Maltese cross]] at the top of the shield and inserting the School [[motto]] ''Sancte Sapienter''. The motto had been adopted by the school on 23 August 1888, and although no [[translation]] was given of the Latin, it may be loosely translated to "be holy wisely" or "holy, wisely."<ref name="GH298"/>

== School badge ==   
The school's highly symbolic badge was inspired by the first Principal, Dr. Marden, and designed in 1888 by the first art teacher, J.A. Bennett. The maiden on the lion represents Knowledge, which is crowned by a tower representing the home, and holding a [[trident]] representing [[Sovereignty]]. A [[laurel wreath]] represents the victory of true womanhood, while the sun symbolises light and energy, and the [[crescent moon]] stands for [[youth]]. The words "Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney" surround the badge.<ref name="GH299"/> 
[[Image:PLCBadge.jpg|left|thumb|160px|PLC Sydney school badge]]
The motto ''All'Ultimo Lavoro'' is [[French (language)|French]] and comes from [[Dante]]. It has variously been translated as: "for the crowning task", "strive for the highest", "the utmost for the highest", or "I work for the highest."<ref name="GH299"/>   
       
The badge is reproduced in the [[leadlight]] over the front door of Shubra Hall,<ref name="GH299"/> and may also be found on the recently opened Ex-Students' pathway. It was traditionally worn as part of the uniform on the [[tam-o-shanter]], until it was phased out in 1995. The badge is currently not worn on the academic uniform, partially due to its adoption by Pymble Ladies' College as their school crest in 1977.<ref name="GH299"/> It was, however, reintroduced in 2003 as an addition to the Beret of the PLC Pipes and Drums uniform, and is also used by the college's [[Alumni association|Ex-students' Union]], as it has been since 1905, with the addition of the words "Ex-students' Union" below.<ref name="GH299"/>

When the College first opened in 1888 there was no uniform, instead the girls wore long cotton dresses, gloves and hat. A straw [[Boater (hat)|boater]] was introduced in the early 20th century, worn with a red and white hat band featuring the college crest with its [[burning bush]] woven into it in red. During this time [[Prefect]]s wore red silk arm-bands embroidered with a gold crest.<ref name="GH309">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 309&ndash;311| chapter =The School Uniform}}</ref> 

The distinctive Black Watch Tartan of the college was introduced in 1918. Senior girls wore heavy box-pleated skirts and white blouses; junior girls wore pinafore dresses. All girls wore a navy blazer and heavy woollen stockings. Prefects also wore a special hat badge with a ring of bright blue enamel. A black felt Breton was introduced for winter use, and no change was made until the introduction of the green beret in 1952.<ref name="GH309"/>
 
The current uniform for Year 11 and 12 was introduced in 1966. It was designed by the senior students of 1965 and consists of a Black Watch kilt, white blouse, green blazer, green jumper or vest, black stockings for winter and bottle green knee-high socks for summer, and black leather lace-up shoes. Girls of [[Scotland|Scottish]] origin are permitted wear the [[kilt pin]] representing their family or [[Scottish clan|clan]] name, rather than the standard school pin. A green and Black Watch [[tam-o-shanter]] (known as 'the Beret') was also introduced for all grades a few years earlier.<ref name="GH309"/> 

The girls found the school's distinctive Beret difficult to wear, so it was phased out in 1995.<ref name="Aurora1995">{{Citation | title=Happenings | newspaper=Aurora Australis: The Magazine of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney | year=1995}}</ref> It was replaced by the current [[Panama hat]], but the Beret was reintroduced in 2003 as an addition to the [[Pipes and Drums]] uniform. 

The current junior (R&ndash;10) uniform was introduced in 1997. In summer, girls are required to wear a Black Watch tunic, short-sleeve white blouse, green blazer with tartan piping, short green socks and black leather shoes. The winter uniform consists of the tunic, long-sleeve white blouse, the blazer, green jumper or vest, Black Watch Tartan tie, Black Watch Tartan scarf and either green knee-high socks or black stockings.<ref name=BoardingHandbook>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public/boardinghousehandbook.pdf |title=Boarding House Handbook |accessdate=2007-06-21 |year=2006 |format=PDF |work=Boarding|publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College}}</ref> School pockets are awarded for student achievements, and are [[Embroidery|embroidered]] in red on the pockets of junior blazers (R&ndash;10 girls), and white on the left-breast of senior blazers (11&ndash;12 girls).

=== College tartan ===   
The school has adopted the [[Black Watch]] [[Tartan]] of the [[Black Watch|Royal Highland Regiment]] as its school and [[Pipe band|Pipes and Drums]] uniform. PLC was granted permission to wear the tartan after its brother school, [[The Scots College]], was issued a [[Decree|royal decree]] allowing them to use Black Watch as their Pipes & Drums and [[Cadets]] uniform. The Black Watch is the oldest of the highland regiments. The 1958 ''Aurora Australis'' (the school [[yearbook]]) explained the tartan's origin: "This tartan was specially designed for the regiment to prevent the jealousy which would have been aroused, if any existing clan tartan had been used."<ref name="Aurora1958">{{Citation | title=Tartan of the Black Watch | newspaper=Aurora Australis: The Magazine of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney | year=1958}}</ref>

== House system ==
The [[house system]] was established by Dr. John Marden, shortly after the opening of the school, with three houses: East, West and Boarders. In 1924 the senior houses were reorganised and renamed Kinross, Harper and Ferguson (with Anderson added in 1968), followed in 1926 by the introduction of junior houses, named Vicars and [[Ewen Neil McQueen|McQueen]] (with Thompson added in 1937).<ref name="GH65">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 65 & 138}}</ref>  
The school moved to four houses in 1979, from primary to secondary, and thus the junior houses disappeared.<ref name="GH65"/> 
Finally, two new houses named Pickard and Wilkie were introduced in 1995. The Houses are named after women and men who have made a significant contribution to the life of the College.<ref name=PLCHouses/>

;Anderson
Mrs E.O. Anderson (1885&ndash;1985) attended PLC from 1898 to 1902. She was an original member of the Committee of the Ex-Students' Union in 1906, then President (1927&ndash;1932), and Patroness from 1936. In 1932 she petitioned the Assembly for the appointment of women to the PLC Council. Anderson was a member of the Council (1932&ndash;1958), and a benefactor to the College all her life.<ref name=PLCHouses>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/house_system.asp |title=House System |accessdate=2007-04-23 |work=History |publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College}}</ref> 

;Ferguson
[[John Ferguson (clergyman)|Rev John Ferguson]] (1852&ndash;1925) was a [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] of St Stephen's Church, Sydney, and in 1917, Acting Principal of [[St Andrew's College, Sydney|St Andrew's Theological College]] at the [[University of Sydney]]. He was appointed Senior [[Chaplain]] and Chairman of the PLC Council in 1913, serving until 1923.<ref name=PLCHouses/> 

;Harper
[[Andrew Harper|Rev Dr Andrew Harper]] (1844&ndash;1936) was the third Principal of [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne|PLC Melbourne]] (1879&ndash;1888). He then lectured at [[Ormond College (University of Melbourne)|Ormond Theological College]], [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] before coming to Sydney, where he was Principal of St Andrew's Theological College (1902&ndash;1923). He was Chairman of the PLC Council from 1907 until 1913.<ref name=PLCHouses/>  

;Kinross
Rev Dr John Kinross (1833&ndash;1908) was a Presbyterian minister at [[Kiama, New South Wales|Kiama]] (1858&ndash;1875). He then became Principal of St Andrew's Theological College from 1875 until 1901, and Chairman of the PLC Council from 1888 until 1906.<ref name=Kinross>{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050040b.htmoffset=0&place_seq=2396 |title=Kinross, John (1833 - 1908) |accessdate=2007-04-23 |last=Dougan |first=Alan |year=1974 |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher= Melbourne University Press |pages=pp. 33&ndash;34}}</ref><ref name=PLCHouses/> 

;Pickard
Marion Pickard was appointed to the College as a teaching governess in June 1888. She was Lady [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]] from 1894 until her resignation in 1907. In 1905 Pickard was elected the first President of the Ex-Students' Union.<ref name=PLCHouses/>  

;Wilkie
Dr Helen Wilkie (1895&ndash;1984) was the second Headmistress at [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Armidale|PLC Armidale]] (1938&ndash;1941), and then the fourth Principal of PLC Sydney (1942&ndash;1946). On her appointment to Croydon she was immediately confronted with the takeover by the [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]], and organised the move of the College to Strathfield.<ref name=PLCHouses/>

==Ex-Students' Union==
'''The Ex-Students' Union''' is the school's [[alumni association]], [[Inauguration|inaugurated]] on the evening of [[9 December]] [[1905]]. At the invitation of Dr. Marden several former students discussed the proposal, elected Marion Pickard (who was at that time Lady [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]]) as their President, and formed a committee to produce a [[Constitution (corporate)|constitution]]. These actions were confirmed at a General Meeting on Jersey Day 1906, and the committee took office until 1907. 
In the beginning, the main objectives of the Union were "the accumulation of a special fund to be devoted to the erection of a [[chapel]] and library at the College, and an Ex-Students' prize to be awarded annually to the girl most proficient in work and sport."{{Ref_label|d|d|none}}<ref name="GH312">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 312&ndash;317| chapter =The Ex-Students' Union}}</ref>

The Union achieved much in its first few years: renting a building in the [[Sydney central business district|CBD]] to serve as a club and committee meeting place, making garments for [[hospital]]s, visiting [[Kindergarten]]s, the [[YWCA]], Home of Peace, Infants' Home and the [[Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children]]. An Ex-Students' [[Orchestra]] and Dramatic Club were formed, and [[Tennis]] and [[Croquet]] matches were held between current and former pupils.<ref name="GH312"/>

In 1916 the Pymble College was opened and its first Ex-Students' Union expressed an interest in joining that of PLC. Subsequently a combined Union was formed, known as the PLC Croydon and Pymble Ex-Students' Union, and an Ex-Students' prize was established at Pymble on the same conditions as at Croydon.<ref name="GH312"/>

One of the Union's most significant contributions to the school was planned following the death of Dr. Marden in 1924. With the desire to provide Marden with a "fitting and lasting memorial",<ref name="GH312"/> it was decided that a library, to be called the John Marden Memorial Library, should be built at the Croydon College. This building was opened by Mrs. Marden in 1927 and although no longer suitable as a library due its size, it remains a treasured part of the school.<ref name="GH312"/>

In 1929, it was proposed that "Pymble students should form a separate Union"<ref name="GH312"/> and that an equitable division of Union funds should be undertaken. This explains the two separate groups that exist today, however, it is still not uncommon for Pymble students to attend Croydon [[reunion]]s and events, particularly regional or interstate activities.<ref name="GH312"/>
