'''Waterlow Park''' is a 26 [[acre]] park to the south east of [[Highgate Village]], in [[North London|North]] [[London]], [[England]]. It was given to the public by Sir [[Sir Sydney Waterlow, 1st Baronet|Sydney Waterlow]], as "a garden for the gardenless" in [[1889]].

[[Lauderdale House]] is at the edge of the park, used as a tea room and for functions and arts events; none of the interior remains in its original state. It is a much modified very old timber framed house, dating back to the sixteenth century. It is surrounded by formal gardens.

Set on a hillside, the park is set amongst ponds and offers fantastic scenic views across the [[City of London]].

It is managed by the [[London Borough of Camden]]. After extensive vandalism and neglect it was restored in 2005.

It has been immortalised in a song by [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]] of [[Mott the Hoople]], who recorded it on their album "Wildlife" in 1971.
