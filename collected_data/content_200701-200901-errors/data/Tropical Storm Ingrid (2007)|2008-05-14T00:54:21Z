'''Tropical Storm Ingrid''' was a weak tropical storm that existed in [[September 2007]]. Ingrid developed on [[September 12]], as a [[tropical depression]]. The depression had become a [[tropical Storm]] on [[September 13]], and it reached its peak intensity of 45&nbsp;mph (75 km/h) that evening, over the deep tropical Atlantic. It continued westward, and on [[September 18]], it had dissipated. It remained a weak storm throughout its existence. It did not directly affect any land areas, or ships. 

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Ingrid 2007 track.png}}
The system's origins were from a large [[tropical wave]] that emerged off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[September 6]]. Strong easterly shear inhibited its development over the next three days until [[September 9]], when it developed a broad area of low pressure in the central Atlantic about midway between the coast of Africa and the [[Lesser Antilles]].<ref name="ingridtcr">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Report for Tropical Storm Ingrid|accessdate=2007-11-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL082007_Ingrid.pdf}}</ref> The wind shear began to slowly weaken, and [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] were initiated on the low on [[September 11]]. By the morning of [[September 12]], the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight about 1125&nbsp;miles (1815&nbsp;km) east of the [[Lesser Antilles]].<ref name="ingridtcr"/>

The system moved in a general west-northwest direction for nearly all of its lifespan, remaining on the southern edge of a mid-tropospheric [[Ridge (meteorology)|ridge]]. Unfavorable wind shear slowed down development significantly and the system remained a tropical depression for 24&nbsp;hours before convection increased and the storm strengthened into a weak tropical storm early on [[September 13]]. Slow strengthening continued that afternoon and the storm reached its peak intensity of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h) that evening.<ref name="ingridtcr"/> Operationally, the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm until that evening, at which point the storm was near its peak intensity.<ref name="td8adv7">{{cite web|author=Blake|year=2007|title=Tropical Storm Ingrid Advisory #7|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-11-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al08/al082007.fstadv.007.shtml?}}</ref>

Further intensification of the cyclone was halted by very strong wind shear due to the presence of a strong [[Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough|tropical upper tropospheric trough]].<ref name="ingridtcr"/> Despite the high shear, Ingrid remained a weak tropical storm until the afternoon of [[September 15]], when it weakened to a tropical depression while east of the [[Leeward Islands]].<ref name="ingridtcr"/> Gradual weakening continued afterward as it passed to the northeast of the islands, although the system remained a tropical depression as it continued to produce deep convection.<ref name="td8adv16">{{cite web|author=Franklin|year=2007|title=Tropical Depression Ingrid Advisory #16|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-11-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al08/al082007.fstadv.016.shtml?}}</ref> Ingrid briefly reorganized itself on [[September 16]] but that trend was short-lived, and it became very disorganized once again that afternoon.<ref name="td8adv16">{{cite web|author=Pasch|year=2007|title=Tropical Depression Ingrid Advisory #18|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-11-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al08/al082007.fstadv.018.shtml?}}</ref> The weakening trend continued, and the final advisory was issued early on [[September 17]] as the system degenerated into an open wave while remaining north of the Leeward Islands.<ref name="td8adv20">{{cite web|author=Franklin|year=2007|title=Tropical Depression Ingrid Advisory #20|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-10-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al08/al082007.fstadv.020.shtml?}}</ref> The remnant low turned to the northwest within the low-level steering flow, and dissipated on [[September 18]] without any redevelopment.<ref name="ingridtcr"/>

==Impact==
Ingrid's sheared circulation remained just east and northeast of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and dissipated without directly affecting any land.<ref name="ingridtcr"/> Its remnants brought heavy rainfall and thunder to [[Antigua]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Alan Scholl|year=2007|title=Unofficial Hurricane Reports from Antigua|publisher=Caribbean Hurricane Network|accessdate=2007-11-28|url=http://www.stormcarib.com/reports/current/antigua.shtml}}</ref> while on [[Saint Martin]] the system dropped 1.5&nbsp;inches (38&nbsp;mm) of rain in about an hour, which caused some roadway flooding.<ref>{{cite web|author=Barbara Cannegieter|year=2007|title=Unofficial Hurricane Reports from St. Martin|publisher=Caribbean Hurricane Network|accessdate=2007-11-28|url=http://www.stormcarib.com/reports/current/stmartin.shtml}}</ref> No damage or casualties were reported, and no ships or land stations recorded tropical storm-force winds.<ref name="ingridtcr"/>

Due to lack of any significant effects from Tropical Storm Ingrid, the name Ingrid was not retired and is on the list of names for the [[2013 Atlantic hurricane season]].
