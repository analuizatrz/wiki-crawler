==History==
In 1954, the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China (PRC) created a Committee for the Reform of the Chinese Written Language. This committee developed ''Hanyu pinyin'' based upon existing systems of that time ''([[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]]'' of 1928, ''[[Latinxua Sin Wenz]]'' of 1931, and the [[diacritic|diacritic markings]] from ''[[zhuyin]])''<ref>Zou Minglang and Sun Hongkai, ''Language Policy In The People's Republic Of China: Theory And Practice Since 1949'', 2004, p. 23</ref>. The main force behind pinyin was [[Zhou Youguang]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Branigan | first = Tania | title = Sound Principles | publisher = The Guardian | date = [[2008-02-21]] | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/21/china | accessdate = 2008-09-20}}
</ref> Zhou was working in a New York bank when he decided to return to China to help rebuild the country after the war. He became an economics professor in [[Shanghai]]. The government assigned him to help the development of a new romanization system. The switch to language and writing largely saved him from the wrath of the [[Cultural Revolution]] of [[Mao Zedong]]. 

A first draft was published on [[February 12]], [[1956]]. The first edition of ''Hanyu pinyin'' was approved and adopted at the Fifth Session of the [[1st National People's Congress]] on [[February 11]], [[1958]]. It was then introduced to primary schools as a way to teach [[Standard Mandarin]] [[pronunciation]] and used to improve the literacy rate among adults. In 2001, the Chinese Government issued the ''National Common Language Law'', providing a legal basis for applying pinyin.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hanyu Pinyin system turns 50|publisher=[[Straits Times]]|date=2008-02-11|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/The%2BStraits%2BTimes/Story/A1Story20080211-48960.html|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref>

==Usage==

Pinyin superseded older romanization systems such as [[Wade-Giles]] (1859; modified 1892) and [[Chinese Postal Map Romanization]], and replaced zhuyin as the method of Chinese phonetic instruction in [[mainland China]]. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) adopted pinyin as the standard romanization for modern Chinese in 1982 (ISO 7098:1982, superseded by ISO 7098:1991). The [[United Nations]] adopted it as an official and standardized Mandarin romanization system in 1986.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lin Mei-chun |publisher=Taipei Times |date=[[2000-10-08]] |title=Official challenges Romanization |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/2000/10/08/56460}}</ref> It has also been accepted by the [[government of Singapore]], the [[Library of Congress]], the [[American Library Association]], and many other international institutions<ref>

The spelling of Chinese geographical or personal names in pinyin has become a standard or most common way to transcribe them in English. It has also become a useful tool for [[Chinese input methods for computers|entering Chinese language text into computers]].

Chinese speaking Standard Mandarin at home use pinyin to help children associate characters with spoken words which they already know; however, for the many Chinese who do not use Standard Mandarin at home, pinyin is used to teach them the [[Standard Mandarin]] pronunciation of words when they learn them in [[elementary school]].

Pinyin has become a tool for many foreigners to learn the Mandarin pronunciation, it is used to explain the grammar and spoken Mandarin together with [[Chinese character|hanzi]]. Like zhuyin, it is used as a phonetic guide in books for children but also dialect speakers and foreign learners. Books containing both Chinese characters and pinyin are popular with foreign learners of Chinese, pinyin's role in teaching pronunciation to foreigners and children is similar to [[furigana]]-based books (with [[hiragana]] letters written above or next to [[kanji]]) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or fully [[Harakat|vocalised]] texts in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ("vocalised Arabic") but as mentioned above, pinyin is also the main romanisation method.

==Overview==

The correspondence between letter and sound does not follow any single other language, but does not depart any more from the norms of the Latin alphabet than many European languages. For example, the aspiration distinction between ''b, d, g'' and ''p, t, k'' is similar to that of English, but not to that of French. ''Z'' and ''c'' also have that distinction; however, they are pronounced as [ts], as in languages such as German, Italian, and Polish, which do not have that distinction. From ''s, z, c'' come the digraphs ''sh, zh, ch'' by analogy with English ''sh, ch;'' although this introduces the novel combination ''zh,'' it is internally consistent in how the two series are related, and represents the fact that many Chinese pronounce ''sh, zh, ch'' as ''s, z, c.'' In the ''x, j, q'' series, ''x'' rather resembles its pronunciation in Catalan, though ''q'' is more novel and its pronunciation is similar to the ''ch'' in ''China''. Pinyin [[vowels]] are pronounced similarly to vowels in [[Romance languages]]. More information on the pronunciation of all pinyin letters in terms of English approximations is given further below.

The pronunciation of Chinese is generally given in terms of [[initial (linguistics)|initials]] and [[final (linguistics)|finals]], which represent the ''segmental phonemic'' portion of the language. Initials are initial consonants, while finals are all possible combinations of [[medial (linguistics)|medials]] ([[semivowel]]s coming before the vowel), the [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] vowel, and [[syllable coda|coda]] (final vowel or consonant).

==Initials and Finals==

Unlike in European languages, initials ({{zh-stp|s=声母|t=聲母|p=shengmu}}) and finals ({{zh-stp|s=韵母|t=韻母|p=yunmu}}, or rhyming sounds) - and not consonants and vowels - are the fundamental elements in pinyin (and most other phonetic systems used to describe the Han language).  Nearly each Chinese syllable can be spelled with exactly one initial followed by one final, except in the special syllable 'er' and when a trailing 'r' is considered part of a syllable (see below).  The latter case, though a common practice in some sub-dialects, is rarely used in official publications.<ref name="trailing r">One exception is the city  [[Harbin]] ({{zh-st|s=哈尔滨|t=哈爾濱}}), which is from the [[Manchu language]].</ref>

Even though most initials contain a consonant, finals are not simple vowels, especially in compound finals ({{zh-stp|s=复韵母|t=複韻母|p=fuyunmu}}), i.e., when one "final" is placed in front of another one.  For example, [i] and [u] are pronounced with such tight openings that some native Chinese speakers (especially when singing or on stage) pronounce yī ({{zh-st|s=衣|t=衣}}, clothes, officially pronounced as {{IPA|/i/}}) as {{IPA|/ji/}}, wéi ({{zh-st|s=围|t=圍}}, to enclose, officially as {{IPA|/uei/}}) as {{IPA|/wei/}} or {{IPA|/wuei/}}.  The concepts of consonants and vowels are not incorporated in pinyin or its predecessors, despite the fact that the Roman alphabets are used in pinyin.  In the entire pinyin system, there is not a list of consonants, nor a list of vowels.

===Finals===

Other than finals modified by an -r, which are omitted, the following is an exhaustive table of all possible finals. <sup>1</sup>

The only syllable-final consonants in standard Mandarin are -n and -ng, and -r which is attached as a grammatical suffix. Chinese syllables ending with any other consonant is either from a non-Mandarin language (southern Chinese languages such as Cantonese, or minority languages of China), or it indicates the use of a non-pinyin Romanization system (where final consonants may be used to indicate tones).

<sup>1</sup> /ər/ (而, 二, etc.) is written as ''er''. For other finals formed by the suffix -r, pinyin does not use special orthography; one simply appends -r to the final that it is added to, without regard for any sound changes that may take place along the way. For information on sound changes related to final -r, please see [[Standard Mandarin]].<br />
<sup>2</sup> "ü" is written as "u" after j, q, x, or y.<br />
<sup>3</sup> "uo" is written as "o" after b, p, m, or f.<br />
<sup>4</sup> It is pronounced {{IPA|[ʊŋ]}} when it follows an initial, and pinyin reflects this difference.

In addition, ''ê'' {{IPA|[ɛ]}} is used to represent certain [[interjection]]s.

The pinyin vowel "u" is always replaced with (→) "w" whenever "u" occurs as an initial (at the beginning of a syllable). For example,  uo→wo, or uan→wan. Pronunciation of this initial "w" remains exactly as the original "u" vowel; similar to "oo" in f"oo"l. The replacement of initial u→w is always applied, but was designed to disambiguate the location of syllable breaks between affected di- or polysyllabic words.  Pronunciation of a pinyin initial "w" as an English "w" is at best an error, more obvious in some words than others, but always incorrect. {{Clarifyme|date=December 2008}}

A variation of the u→w replacement occurs when the pinyin "u" would constitute the entire morpheme (syllable); in this case, the replacement is u→wu. The pronunciation rule remains the same. {{Clarifyme|date=December 2008}}
|-
||''y''||  {{IPA|[j] / [i]}} {{Clarifyme|date=December 2008}}|| as in '''y'''es

The pinyin vowel "i" is always replaced with (→) "y", whenever "i" occurs as an initial (at the beginning of a syllable). Thus,  ie→ye, or ian→yan. Pronunciation of this initial "y" remains exactly as the original "i" vowel; similar to '''ee''' as in b'''ee'''. The replacement of initial i→y is always applied, but was designed to disambiguate the location of syllable breaks between affected di- or polysyllabic words.  Mispronunciation of a pinyin initial "y" as any English "y" (as in '''y'''es, or wh'''y''') is a significant error. For example, pronouncing  "yī" (一, one, 1, single) as "yee" would be very incorrect. {{Clarifyme|date=December 2008}}

A variation of the i→y replacement occurs when the pinyin "i" constitutes the entire syllable; in this case, the replacement i→yi is made. The pronunciation rule remains the same. {{Clarifyme|date=December 2008}}

Note the special cases of the pinyin "yü" and "yu"; an initial "ü" is replaced with "yü". Thus, üe→yüe, üan→yüan. 
When a pinyin "ü" constitutes the entire morpheme by itself, the replacement is ü→yu.  As always, pronunciation remains identical to the original vowel. {{Clarifyme|date=December 2008}}

===Pronunciation of finals===
The following is an exhaustive list of all finals in [[Standard Mandarin]].  Those ending with a final '''-r''' are listed at the end.

To find a given final:
#Remove the initial consonant. For zh-, ch-, sh-, both letters should be removed, they are single consonants spelt with two letters.
#Although y- and w- are consonants nevertheless they may be considered as part of finals and do not remove those.
##Syllables beginning with y- and w- may be considered as standalone forms of finals "i, u, ü" and finals beginning with "i-, u-, ü-".
#If a syllable begins with j-, q-, x-, or y-, and the final is -u or starts with -u-, then change -u or -u- to -ü or -ü-.

== Orthography ==
===Letters===
Pinyin differs from other romanizations in several aspects, such as the following:

* Syllables starting with ''u'' are written as ''w'' in place of ''u'' (e.g. ''ueng'' is written as ''weng''). Standalone ''u'' is written as ''wu''.
* Syllables starting with ''i'' are written as ''y'' in place of ''i'' (e.g. ''iou'' is written as ''you''). Standalone ''i'' is written as ''yi''.
* Syllables starting with ''ü'' are written as ''yu'' in place of ''ü'' (e.g. ''üe'' is written as ''yue'').
* ''ü'' is written as ''u'' when there is no ambiguity (such as ''ju'', ''qu'', and ''xu''), but written as ''ü'' when there are corresponding ''u'' syllables (such as ''lü'' and ''nü'').  In such situations where there are corresponding ''u'' syllables, it is often replaced with ''v'' on a computer, making it easier to type on a standard keyboard.
* When preceded by a consonant, ''iou'', ''uei'', and ''uen'' are simplified as ''iu'', ''ui'', and ''un'' (which do not represent the actual pronunciation).
* As in zhuyin, what are actually pronounced as ''buo'', ''puo'', ''muo'', and ''fuo'' are given a separate representation: ''bo'', ''po'', ''mo'', and ''fo''.
* The [[apostrophe]] (') is often used before ''a'', ''o'', and ''e'' to separate syllables in a word where ambiguity could arise, especially when omitting tone marks, e.g., ''pi'ao'' ({{zh-st|s=皮袄|t=皮襖}}) vs. ''piao'' (票), and ''[[Xi'an]]'' (西安) vs. ''xian'' (先).
* ''[[Eh#Similar terms in other languages|Eh]]'' alone is written as ''ê''; elsewhere as ''e''. [[Schwa]] is always written as ''e''.
* ''zh'', ''ch'', and ''sh'' can be abbreviated as ''ẑ'', ''ĉ'', and ''ŝ'' (''z'', ''c'', ''s'' with a [[circumflex]]). However, the shorthands are rarely used due to difficulty of entering them on computers.
* ''ng'' has the uncommon shorthand of ''[[ŋ]]''.
* The letter ''v'' is unused （except in spelling foreign languages, languages of minority nationalities, and some dialects), despite a conscious effort to distribute letters more evenly than in Western languages.  However, sometimes, for ease of typing into a computer, the ''v'' is used to replace a ''ü''.

Most of the above are used to avoid ambiguity when writing words of more than one syllable in pinyin.  For example uenian is written as ''wenyan'' because it is not clear which syllables make up ''uenian''; ''uen-ian'', ''uen-i-an'' and ''u-en-i-an'' are all possible combinations whereas ''wenyan'' is unambiguous because ''we'', ''nya'', etc. do not exist in pinyin. See the [[pinyin table]] article for a summary of possible pinyin syllables (not including tones).

===Capitalization and word formation===
[[Image:E7918-Dordoy-Bazaar-blankets.jpg|thumb|Many writers are not yet aware of the rules for dividing text into words by spaces, and either put a space after each syllable, or run all words together. The manufacturer of these blankets put unnecessary spaces into  'Bishikaike' (the correct pinyin for [[:zh:比什凯克|比什凯克]], '[[Bishkek]]') - but wrote the English text on top with no spaces at all.]]
Although Chinese characters represent single syllables, Mandarin Chinese is a [[polysyllabic]] language.  Spacing in pinyin is based on whole words, not single syllables.  However, there are often ambiguities in partitioning a word.  Orthographic rules were put into effect in 1988 by the National Educational Commission (国家教育委员会, pinyin: ''Guójiā Jiàoyù Wěiyuánhuì )'' and the National Language Commission (国家语言文字工作委员会, pinyin: ''Guójiā Yǔyán Wénzì Gōngzuò Wěiyuánhuì).''

== Tones ==
[[Image:Pinyin Tone Chart.svg|right|thumb|115px|Relative pitch changes of the four tones]]
The pinyin system also uses [[diacritic]]s for the four [[Standard Mandarin#Tones|tones of Mandarin]], usually above a non-medial [[vowel]].  Many books printed in China mix fonts, with vowels and tone marks rendered in a different font than the surrounding text, tending to give such pinyin texts a typographically ungainly appearance. This style, most likely rooted in early technical limitations, has led many to believe that pinyin's rules call for this practice and also for the use of a [[Latin alpha]] ("{{Unicode|ɑ}}") rather than the standard style of the letter ("{{Unicode|a}}") found in most fonts. The official rules of ''Hanyu Pinyin,'' however, specify no such practice. Note that tone marks can also appear on consonants in certain vowelless exclamations.

# The first tone (Flat or High Level Tone) is represented by a [[macron]] (ˉ) added to the pinyin vowel:
#:<br/><span style="font-size: 20pt;">{{Unicode|ā (ɑ&#772;) ē ī ō ū ǖ Ā Ē Ī Ō Ū Ǖ}}</span>
# The second tone (Rising or High-Rising Tone) is denoted by an [[acute accent]] (ˊ):
#:<br/><span style="font-size: 20pt;">{{Unicode|á (ɑ&#769;) é í ó ú ǘ Á É Í Ó Ú Ǘ}}</span>
# The third tone (Falling-Rising or Low Tone) is marked by a [[caron]]/háček (ˇ). It is not the rounded [[breve]] (˘), though a breve is sometimes substituted due to font limitations.  
#:<br/><span style="font-size: 20pt;">{{Unicode|ǎ (ɑ̌) ě ǐ ǒ ǔ ǚ Ǎ Ě Ǐ Ǒ Ǔ Ǚ}}</span>
# The fourth tone (Falling or High-Falling Tone) is represented by a [[grave accent]] (ˋ):
#:<br/><span style="font-size: 20pt;">{{Unicode|à (ɑ&#768;) è ì ò ù ǜ À È Ì Ò Ù Ǜ}}</span>
# The fifth tone (Neutral Tone) is represented by a normal vowel without any accent mark: 
#:<br/><span style="font-size: 20pt;">{{Unicode|a (ɑ) e i o u ü A E I O U Ü}}</span>
:(In some cases, this is also written with a dot before the syllable; for example, ·ma.)

These tone marks normally are only used in Mandarin textbooks or in foreign learning texts, but they are essential for correct pronunciation of Mandarin syllables, as exemplified by the following classic example of five characters whose pronunciations differ only in their tones:
{| class="wikitable" align="center"
||

Traditional characters:

{{Ruby-big|媽|mā}}
{{Ruby-big|麻|má}}
{{Ruby-big|馬|mǎ}}
{{Ruby-big|罵|mà}}
{{Ruby-big|嗎|·ma}}

Simplified characters:

{{Ruby-big|妈|mā}}
{{Ruby-big|麻|má}}
{{Ruby-big|马|mǎ}}
{{Ruby-big|骂|mà}}
{{Ruby-big|吗|·ma}}
||
{{Listen|filename=Zh-pinyin_tones_with_ma.ogg |title=mā má mǎ mà |description=A sound sample of the four tones}}
|}

The words are "mother", "hemp", "horse", "scold" and a question particle, respectively.

===Numerals in place of tone marks===
Since before the advent of computers, many fonts did not contain vowels with macron or caron diacritics, a common convention for tone is to add a [[tone number]] at the end of individual syllables.  For example, ''tóng'' is written ''tong2.'' 
The number used for each tone is as the order listed above (except the neutral tone, which is either not numbered or numbered zero, as in ''ma0'' 吗/嗎 (an [[interrogative]] marker).

===Rules for placing the tone mark===
The rules for determining on which vowel the tone mark appears when there are multiple vowels are as follows:<ref>{{cite web
  | last = Swofford
  | first = Mark
  | title = Where do the tone marks go?
  | publisher = Pinyin.info
  | url = http://www.pinyin.info/rules/where.html
  | accessdate = 2008-09-20}}
</ref>

# First, look for an "a" or an "e". If either vowel appears, it takes the tone mark. There are no possible pinyin syllables that contain both an "a" and an "e".
# If there is no "a" or "e", look for an "ou". If "ou" appears, then the "o" takes the tone mark.
# If none of the above cases hold, then the last vowel in the syllable takes the tone mark.

(''y'' and ''w'' are not considered vowels for these rules.)

The reasoning behind these rules is in the case of [[diphthong]]s and [[triphthong]]s, ''i'', ''u'', and ''ü'' (and their orthographic equivalents ''y'' and ''w'' when there is no initial consonant) are considered [[medial (linguistics)|medial]] glides rather than part of the [[syllable nucleus]] in Chinese [[phonology]]. The rules ensure that the tone mark always appears on the nucleus of a syllable.

Another way to find a proper vowel for a tone mark is to apply the tone mark in the following order: "a", "e", "o", "i", "u", except for "iu", in which case "u" takes the tone mark.

== The character "ü" ==
An [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] is placed over the letter ''u'' when it occurs after the initials ''l'' and ''n'' in order to represent the sound [y].  This is necessary in order to distinguish the front high rounded vowel in ''lü'' (e.g. 驴/驢 donkey) from the back high rounded vowel in ''lu'' (e.g. 炉/爐 oven).  Tonal markers are added on top of the umlaut, as in ''lǘ''.

However, the ''ü'' is ''not'' used in other contexts where it represents a front high rounded vowel, namely after the letters ''j'', ''q'', ''x'' and ''y''.  For example, the sound of the word 鱼/魚 (fish) is transcribed in pinyin simply as ''yú'', not as ''yǘ''. This practice is opposed to [[Wade-Giles]], which always uses ''ü'', and ''[[Tongyong pinyin]],'' which always uses ''yu''.  Whereas Wade-Giles needs to use the umlaut to distinguish between ''chü'' (pinyin ''ju'') and ''chu'' (pinyin ''zhu''), this ambiguity cannot arise with pinyin, so the more convenient form ''ju'' is used instead of ''jü''.  Genuine ambiguities only happen with ''nu''/''nü'' and ''lu''/''lü'', which are then distinguished by an umlaut diacritic.

Many fonts or output methods do not support an umlaut for ''ü'' or cannot place tone marks on top of ''ü''.  Likewise, using ''ü'' in input methods is difficult because it is not present as a simple key on many keyboard layouts.  For these reasons ''v'' is sometimes used instead by convention.  Occasionally, ''uu'' (double ''u''), ''u:'' (''u'' followed by a colon) or ''U'' (capital ''u'') is used in its place.

Although ''nüe'' written in ''nue'', and ''lüe'' written in ''lue'' won't be confusing, ''nue'' or ''lue'' is not correct according the rules. You should use ''nüe'' and ''lüe''. However, some Chinese input method (e.g. [[Microsoft Pinyin IME]]) both support ''nve''/''lve''(here ''v'' is for ''ü'') and ''nue''/lue''.

==Pinyin in Taiwan==
[[Taiwan]] adopted ''[[Tongyong pinyin]],'' a modification of ''Hanyu pinyin,'' on the national level in October 2002. This has resulted in political controversy, much of it centered on issues of national identity, with proponents of [[Chinese reunification]] favoring ''Hanyu pinyin,'' used in the People's Republic of China, and proponents of Taiwanese independence favoring the use of ''Tongyong pinyin.''{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Localities with governments controlled by the [[Kuomintang]], most notably [[Taipei City]], have overridden the 2002 administrative order and converted to ''Hanyu pinyin,'' though with a slightly different capitalization convention than the Mainland. As a result, the use of romanization on signage in Taiwan is inconsistent, with many places using ''Tongyong pinyin'' but some using ''Hanyu pinyin,'' and still others not yet having had the resources to replace older [[Wade-Giles]] or [[MPS2]] signage. This has resulted in the odd situation in Taipei in which inconsistent romanizations are shown in freeway directions, with freeway signs, under the control of the national government, using one system, but surface street signs, under the control of the city government, using the other.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Primary education in Taiwan continues to teach pronunciation using ''[[zhuyin]]'' annotation. Although the ROC government has stated the desire to use romanization rather than ''zhuyin'' in education, the lack of agreement on which form of pinyin to use and the huge logistical challenge of teacher training has stalled these efforts.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In 2008, the government announced plans to convert to ''Hanyu pinyin'' as the official romanization for Taiwan, effective January 1, 2009.<ref name="pinyin_tt"/><ref name="pinyin_cp"/>

==Other languages==
Pinyin-like systems have been devised for other variants of Chinese. [[Guangdong Romanization]] is a set of romanizations devised by the government of [[Guangdong]] province for [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] ([[Moiyen dialect]]), and [[Hainan dialect|Hainanese]]. All of these are designed to use Latin letters in a similar way to pinyin.

In addition, in accordance to the ''Regulation of Phonetic Transcription in Hanyu Pinyin Letters of Place Names in Minority Nationality Languages'' (少数民族语地名汉语拼音字母音译转写法) promulgated in 1976, place names in non-Chinese languages like [[Mongol language|Mongol]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], and [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]] are also officially transcribed using pinyin. The pinyin letters (26 Roman letters, ü, ê) are used to approximate the non-Chinese language in question as closely as possible. This results in spellings that are different from both the customary spelling of the place name, and the pinyin spelling of the name in Chinese:

Pinyin assigns some [[Roman alphabet|Roman letters]] [[phonology|phonological]] values which are quite different from that of most languages. 

Pinyin is purely a representation of the sounds of Mandarin, therefore it lacks the [[semantic]] cues that [[Chinese character]]s can provide. It is also unsuitable for transcribing some [[Chinese spoken languages]] other than Mandarin.

Simple computer systems, able only to display only 7-bit [[ASCII]] text (essentially the 26 Latin letters, 10 digits and punctuation marks), long provided the most convincing argument in favor of pinyin over hanzi.  Today, however, most computer systems are able to display characters from Chinese and many other writing systems as well, and have them entered with a Latin keyboard using an [[input method editor]]. Alternatively, some [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[Tablet pc|tablet PCs]] and [[digitizing tablet]]s allow users to input characters directly by writing with a [[stylus]].

If the following character displays as an empty square box: <span style="font-style: normal;">ǔ</span>, do the following: on the menus at the top of the window, select "Tools," then "Internet Options," then "Accessibility."  Check the box labeled "Ignore font styles specified on Web pages" and click "OK."  After that, select "Tools," then "Internet Options," then "Fonts."  In the menu at the left, select "[[Arial Unicode MS]]" (or "[[Arial]]," if this font is not available), then click "OK."  It may also be necessary to select "View" (or "Page" on more recent versions of Internet Explorer), then "Encoding," then "Unicode (UTF-8)."

=== Windows ===
Many Chinese [[input method editor|IMEs]] allow a pinyin toggle in addition to the simplified–traditional character toggle. The user can then type using pinyin with tone marks using the alphanumeric keys on a standard keyboard; the popular [[:zh:紫光拼音输入法|Ziguang Pinyin IME]] is one such example. [http://www.chinese-forums.com/showthread.php?t=13005 Pinyinput] is a Windows-based IME that allows you to type toned pinyin with ease.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}  Because it works at the system level, it will allow you to type pinyin with tones in any Windows program just as easily as you would type Chinese (in fact even easier, because you don't need to select the correct character).  Activate the IME then start typing pinyin.  Type a number from 1-4 after a pinyin syllable, and the corresponding tone will automatically be placed on the correct vowel of that syllable.

=== Mac OS X ===
Activate the "US Extended" keyboard (found in the "Input Menu" tab of the "International' section of the ''[[System Preferences]]'') and then do:
* Option-a and then <vowel> to create the first tones: ā, ē, ī, ō, ū
* Option-e and then <vowel> to create the second tones: á, é, í, ó, ú
* Option-v and then <vowel> to create the third tone: ǎ, ě, ǐ, ǒ, ǔ
* Option-` and then <vowel> to create the fourth tone: à, è, ì, ò, ù
* u and then Shift-Option-u and then Shift-Option-<a, e, v or `> gives ǖ, ǘ, ǚ or ǜ.
* v may be entered as a <vowel> to produce a ü.  For instance, Option-e v produces ǘ.  Option-u u produces a ü without tone marks.
