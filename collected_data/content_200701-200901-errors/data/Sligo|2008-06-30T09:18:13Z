==History==
Sligo's Irish name "Sligeach" - meaning shelly place - originates in the abundance of [[shellfish]] found in the river and its estuary, and from the extensive '[[midden#Shell middens|shell middens]]' or Stone Age food preparation areas in the vicinity.<ref name=FandF>

</ref><ref name=SBC/> The [[Ordnance Survey]] letters of [[1836]] state that "cart loads of shells were found underground in many places within the town where houses now stand". At that time shells were constantly being dug up during the construction of foundations for buildings. This whole area, from the river estuary at Sligo, around the coast to the river at [[Ballysadare]] Bay, was rich in marine resources which were utilised as far back as the [[Mesolithic]] period.

The significance of Sligo in the [[Early Neolithic]] period is demonstrated by the abundance of ancient sites close by, not least [[Carrowmore]], on the Cuil Irra peninsula, 3k from the town. The [[NRA]] excavation for the N4 Sligo Inner Relief Road in 2002 revealed an early Neolithic [[causewayed enclosure]] (c. 4000 B.C.) overlooking the site of Sligo town today. It would have been enclosed by a ditch and palisade, and was perhaps an area of commerce and ritual. According to Edward Danagher, who excavated there, 'Magheraboy demonstrates the early Neolithic settlement of this area of Sligo, while the longevity of the activity on the site indicates a stable and successful population during the final centuries of the fifth millennium and the first centuries of the fourth millennium BC'.<ref name=Danaher>

[[Maurice Fitzgerald]], the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland is generally credited with the establishment of the medieval town of Sligo, building the Castle of Sligo in 1245. Sligo was burned with regularity throughout the medieval period. In 1257, Geoffry O'Donnell, chief of [[Tirconnell]], marched on Sligo and burned the town. The [[Irish annals|annalists]] refer to this Sligo as a "sradbhaile"; meaning a village or town not defended by an enclosure or wall, and consisting of one street. By the mid 15th century the town and port had grown in importance. Amongst the earliest preserved specimens of written English in Connaught is a receipt for 20 marks, dated August 1430, paid by Saunder Lynche and Davy Botyller, to Henry Blake and Walter Blake, customers of “ye King and John Rede, controller of ye porte of Galvy and of Slego”. Over a century later an order is sent from the Elizabethan Government to Sir Nicholas Malby, Knight, willing him to establish ‘apt and safe’ places for the keeping of the Assizes & Sessions, with walls of lime & stone, in each county of Connaught, “judging that the aptest place be in Sligo, for the County of Sligo…”<ref name=wood-m>

</ref> [[Sligo Abbey]], the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary, is the only medieval building left standing in the town. The abbey was founded by Fitzgerald in 1253 but was accidentally destroyed by fire in 1414, and was rebuilt in its present form. When Frederick Hamilton’s soldiers sacked Sligo Town in 1642, the Abbey was burned and everything valuable in it was destroyed. Much of the structure, including the choir, carved altar and cloisters remain.

Between 1847 and 1851 over 30,000 people emigrated through the [[port]] of Sligo.<ref name=norton>

</ref> On the Quays, overlooking the [[River Garavogue|Garavogue]] River, is a memorial sculpture to those people. This is one of a suite of three sculptures commissioned by the Sligo Famine Commemoration Committee to honour the victims of the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)|Great Famine]]. A plaque in the background, headed 'Letter to America, [[January 2]], [[1850]]' tells one family's sad story: "''I am now, I may say, alone in the world. All my brothers and sisters are dead and children but yourself... We are all ejected out of Mr. Enright's ground... The times was so bad and all [[Ireland]] in such a state of poverty that no person could pay rent. My only hope now rests with you, as I am without one shilling and as I said before I must either beg or go to the poorhouse... I remain your affectionate father, Owen Larkin. Be sure answer this by return of post.''"

The poet [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] is associated with Sligo. Much of his writing is descriptive of the area around Sligo town. In particular "[[The Lake Isle of Innisfree]]" is a reference to a small, uninhabited island on [[Lough Gill]], which is a lake adjacent to the town. (The poet was likely thinking of Beezies Island, a bigger island in the lake close to the mouth of the Garavogue and a popular place to row to in the nineteen hundreds.) Yeats, who spent much of his youth in Sligo and its environs, died in 1939 and is buried in the graveyard in [[Drumcliffe]], County Sligo.<ref name=yeatsph>

==Transport==
[[Image:Border diagram 2007.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Sligo Hub & Gateway access]]
The primary arteries of Sligo's road network are: the [[N4 road (Ireland)|N4 road]] to Dublin (which is motorway on some stretches, dual-carriageway in others); the [[N15 road|N15]] (known as the [[Bundoran]] Road) to [[Lifford]] [[County Donegal]]; and the [[N16 road|N16]] (the [[Enniskillen]] road) which runs through [[Manorhamilton]], [[County Leitrim]] to the border at [[Blacklion]], [[County Cavan]]/[[Belcoo]], [[County Fermanagh]], [[Northern Ireland]].

The section of the N4 road between Sligo and Collooney, extending about 15 kilometers outside Sligo, is made up of dual carriageway. The first phase of this road was completed in 1999, bypassing the towns of [[Collooney]] and [[Ballysadare]]. An extension to this road was completed in 2005, known as The Sligo Inner Relief Road. It stretches from Carraroe in the south of Sligo to Hughes Bridge, a four lane crossing of the river at its narrowest bridging point. This bridge was opened on [[8 December]] [[1988]]. 

The Sligo County Council ‘Traffic & Transportation Plan’ identified the pedestrianisation of Sligo’s core streets as a priority following the opening of the Sligo Inner Relief Road. O'Connell Street - the main street in the town - was pedestrianised on [[15 August]] [[2006]]. 

Sligo acquired rail links to [[Dublin]] in 1862, with the opening of the [[Sligo Mac Diarmada Station|Sligo railway station]] on [[3 December]] of that year.<ref name=railscot>

For many years [[Córas Iompair Éireann|CIE]] kept the latter line open for freight traffic, and although it is now disused, it forms part of the [[Western Rail Corridor]] redevelopment project. In [[1966]] Sligo railway station was renamed [[Mac Diarmada railway station|Mac Diarmada Station]] after Irish rebel [[Seán Mac Diarmada]] from [[County Leitrim]].<ref name=MacD>

== Development ==
[[Image:Sligo garavogue river in the evening.jpg|The Garavogue River|thumb|right|250px|The Garavogue River.]]
Like many urban areas in western parts of Ireland, Sligo suffered for many years from a lack of development. However this has improved in some sectors in the past decade. The Quayside Shopping Centre opened in 2005 and Johnston's Court Shopping Centre opened in 2007. 
    
Some new development has occurred along the river Garavogue, most notably the regeneration of J.F.K. Parade, [[Kempten im Allgau|Kempten]] Promenade and the [[Crozon]] Promenade, The Riverside and Rockwood Parade, consisting of houses, bars and a number of apartments as well two new footbridges over the river itself. Work began on Rockwood Parade in 1992, and the footbridge there was opened in 1996. The most recent addition to the riverside is the regeneration and redesign of the former Silver Swan Hotel, overlooking the River Garavogue.

==Media==
There are three local newspapers in Sligo. The [[Sligo Weekender]] is published on Tuesday while [[The Sligo Champion]] and The [[Sligo Post]] are both published on Wednesday.

The locality is serviced by the local radio station, [[Ocean FM (Ireland)|Ocean FM]]. With studios located in [[Collooney]] in Co Sligo, [[Donegal]] town, and Manorhamilton in Co Leitrim, the station broadcasts into counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo.
