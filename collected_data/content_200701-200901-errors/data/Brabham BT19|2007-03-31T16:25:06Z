The '''Brabham BT19''' is a [[Formula One]] racing car designed by Ron Tauranac for the [[Brabham]] team. Jack Brabham referred to it as his 'Old Nail'. A one-off design, it was used by Australian [[Jack Brabham]] to win his third world championship in 1966. It was also the first car bearing its driver's name to win a world championship race, Brabham's two earlier wins having been taken by American [[Dan Gurney]].

For the [[1966 Formula One season]] the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) introduced a larger 3&nbsp;litre limit on engine size. The BT19, originally designed for a 1.5&nbsp;litre [[Coventry-Climax]] engine in 1965, was modified to take the new [[Repco]] V8 engine developed in Australia for the team.

BT19 is currently in Australia, where, as of 2004, it was still occasionally being driven at demonstration events by Jack Brabham, by then in his 70s.

==Concept==

'Brabham' cars were designed and built by a company called Motor Racing Developments Ltd. (MRD), owned 50-50 by Jack Brabham and Australian designer [[Ron Tauranac]]. MRD built cars for customers in several different formulae. The Brabham Formula One team, run by Jack Brabham's own 'Brabham Racing Organisation', paid for its cars like other customers and there was little connection between Tauranac at MRD and the race team between 1962 and 1965. At the end of the 1965 season, Tauranac was becoming disinterested in continuing this arrangement, reasoning that since he got no real benefit from the Formula One operation, he might as well concentrate all his efforts on the customer business. Although Jack Brabham investigated the possibility of using other chassis, the two men eventually reached an agreement, which meant that Tauranac would have a greater interest in the running of the Formula One team.

This agreement was not reached until November 1965, however, leaving no time for MRD to design a new car to take their new Australian-built 3&nbsp;litre Repco 620 engine. The BT19 chassis had originally been designed in 1965 to use Coventry Climax's stillborn 1.5&nbsp;litre [[flat-16]] engine. When Coventry Climax abandoned the project the chassis was put to one side until it was pressed into use at the end of 1965 to take the first Repco.

==Chassis and suspension==

Tauranac continued with the familiar [[spaceframe]] chassis, although Lotus had introduced the [[monocoque]] to Formula One as long ago as the [[1962 Formula One season]] and most of Brabham's competitors were by now using this approach, which offered theoretical gains in stiffness and lightness. The Brabham reputation for customer cars was in part built upon the works teams, including the Formula One team, using the same technology as the customer cars. Tauranac believed that contemporary monocoques were not usefully stiffer than a well-designed spaceframe, and were harder to repair and maintain for customers. One novel feature was the use of oval section tubing, of which Tauranac had found a supply, around the cockpit area to strengthen it. The car weighed around 1250&nbsp;lb, around 150&nbsp;lb over the minimum weight limit for the formula, although it was still one of the lightest cars in the 1966 field.

The suspension was outboard all round, Tauranac having assessed the gain in drag to be made by moving suspension inboard to be only 2%. He judged this gain to be insufficient to outweigh the extra work and inconvenience to the mechanics working on the car under pressure. At the front the suspension layout was unequal length, non-parallel [[double wishbone suspension| double wishbones]]. The front uprights were modified from the units used on the [[Triumph Herald]]. The rear suspension consisted of a single top link, a reversed lower wishbone and two [[radius rod]]s.

The car handled well, Brabham has since said: "The BT19 was beautifully balanced and I loved its readiness to [[Drifting (motorsport)|drift]] through fast curves".<ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) p.199</ref>

==Engine and transmission==

Repco's 620 unit used aluminium engine blocks obtained from an abandoned [[Oldsmobile]] engine project, as well as a selection of other off the shelf parts. The 740 unit used in the three races the car was entered for in 1967 used a different, proprietary engine block. The engine, significantly less powerful than some of the opposition, was relatively fuel efficient, which, combined with the lightweight chassis, meant that it could start a Grand Prix with only 35&nbsp;gallons of fuel on board. On the car's debut Brabham reports that the car achieved 7&nbsp;mpg, against figures of around 4&nbsp;mpg for its "more exotic rivals".<ref>Brabham, Nye (2005) p.191</ref>

The car was initially fitted with a [[Hewland]] HD (Heavy Duty) gearbox, orginally designed for the 1.5&nbsp;litre formula. This design was marginal for the more powerful 3&nbsp;litre engines, with the result that Brabham normally made very gentle starts - the start being the time the greatest loading is put through the gearbox. The HD was later replaced with the sturdier DG (Different Gearbox) design. Wheels were initially 13 inches but soon upgraded to 15 inches.

==Racing History==

The car was only driven by Jack Brabham in 1966, and at the [[1966 French Grand Prix]] at [[Reims]] he used it to take his first Formula One world championship victory in one of his own cars, the first man to do so. He went on to take four straight wins and the world championship. The car was used again at three championship races in the [[1967 Formula One season]], taking second place at the [[1967 Dutch Grand Prix]].
