The '''15th Marine Expeditionary Unit''' ('''15th MEU''') is one of seven [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s currently in existence in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. The Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is a [[Marine Air Ground Task Force]] (MAGTF) with a strength of about 2,200 personnel. The MEU consists of a command element, a reinforced infantry battalion, a composite helicopter squadron and a combat logistics battalion.<ref name="speartip">{{cite web|url=http://www.usmc.mil/meus/meu_organization.htm

== Mission ==
The mission of the MEU is to provide geographic combatant commanders with a forward-deployed, rapid-response force capable of conducting conventional [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] and selected maritime special operations at night or under adverse weather conditions from the sea, by surface and/or by air while under communications and electronics restrictions.<ref name="MEUorg">{{cite web|url=http://www.usmc.mil/meus/meu_organization.htm

== History ==
=== Early years ===
In April 1983, the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] approved the original [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force]] (MAGTF) Headquarters concept, providing for the sourcing of two Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU) headquarters from each Marine Amphibious Brigade headquarters.<ref name="mainstream"> Grant, 2004.</ref>  The Commandant directed the establishment of two additional MAU headquarters in November 1985.  As a result, the Headquarters, 15th Marine Amphibious Unit was activated [[July 1]], [[1987]] at Camp Pendleton.

The Commandant directed the replacement of the title "Headquarters" with "Command Element" in the titles of the MAGTFs in August of 1987.  The 15th MAU’s designation was further changed in February 1988 to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit.  Both changes were made to more accurately reflect the operational and [[Expeditionary maneuver warfare|expeditionary nature]] of the MAGTF.  Prior to [[World War II]], and in the period between the war and the [[Vietnam Conflict]], Marine units dispatched for overseas service were generally designated as “expeditionary brigades." 

Since its activation in July 1987, the 15th MEU has trained to meet its mission in the rotation with the [[11th Marine Expeditionary Unit|11th]] and [[13th MEU]]s to provide a continuous presence in the [[Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]], [[Indian Ocean]], and [[Persian Gulf]] and as a ready MAGTF in the continental United States. 

In October 1989, the MEU assisted in relief efforts following the [[Loma Prieta earthquake|San Francisco earthquake]], performing their assigned missions and also taking on several volunteer projects to help the victims of the disaster.

=== 1990s ===
Marines of the 15th MEU evacuated the [[Republic of the Philippines]] in June 1991 after the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]]. Assistance lasted over amonth as the Marines distributed food and medical supplies, evacuated stranded villagers and provided security to other rescue personnel.

The MEU spearheaded [[Operation Restore Hope]] on [[December 9]], [[1992]], to provide [[humanitarian assistance]] to the [[civil war]] torn and [[famine]] stricken country of [[Somalia]].<ref name="Army.mil"> JTF Humanitarian Assistance Operations.</ref>  After a predawn landing, the Marines secured the capital city of [[Mogadishu]], the international airport and maritime shipping port facilities, as well as the American Embassy, and quickly moved into other inland areas to protect food distribution convoys and patrol the streets to restore order. The MEU pushed into and secured the inland cities of Baidoa, Balidogle and the coastal town of Kismayo in order to establish relief efforts and maintain security.  The span of operations for the Battalion Landing Team was over 150 miles.  

During its deployment in 1994, the MEU provided a detachment of [[CH-53E]]s to assist in the [[Rwanda]] Relief Effort. <ref name="Navy.mil">  Navy-Marine Corps Crisis Response and Combat Actions, 2000. </ref>.  The detachment, based in [[Entebbe]], [[Uganda]], provided the only heavy lift capability to the joint task force commander.  A few weeks later the MEU assisted in the relocation of the United States Liaison Office from Mogadishu, Somalia to [[Nairobi, Kenya]]. 

In October 1994, the MEU was called on again to provide a [[Quick Reaction Force|quick reaction force]] to counter any possible [[Iraq]]i aggression against [[Kuwait]].  Within 48 hours, the MEU sent Marines ashore in [[Kuwait City]] to demonstrate U.S. resolve in maintaining peace and security in the area. 

In January 1996,  July 1997, and October 1998, [[Harrier II|AV-8B Harriers]] from the 15th MEU (SOC) participated in [[Operation Southern Watch]],  patrolling the [[No-fly zone]] over southern Iraq maintaining continuous surveillance of the Kuwait-Iraq border, and to ensure the Iraqi military did not violate any [[United Nations resolution]]s passed since the [[Gulf War]]. 

During its 2000 deployment, the 15th MEU (SOC) also participated in the [[Australia]]n-led [[INTERFET|Operation Stabilise]], providing desperately needed assistance to the people of  [[East Timor]], and again patrolled the skies over Southern Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch.

=== Global 'War on Terror' ===
[[Image:Marineshumping2001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Infantrymen from the 15th MEU at [[Camp Rhino]] on [[November 25]], [[2001]]]]
Following the [[September 11th attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]], the 15th MEU (SOC) continued their plans of humanitarian operations to assist the war-torn country of [[East Timor]], before sailing to the North [[Arabian Sea]] in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].

On [[October 7]], [[2001]], the 15th MEU participated in the United States' new  [[Global War on Terror|"War on Terrorism,"]] sending Marines and Sailors into Northern [[Pakistan]] to establish a [[Forward Operating Base|forward operating air base]] and [[Logistics#Military logistics|logistical]] hub.

On [[November 25]], [[2001]], the Marines and Sailors of the 15th MEU (SOC) conducted an [[Amphibious assault]] over 400 miles into the land-locked country of [[Afghanistan]].  The Marines and Sailors set new standards for Marine Corps amphibious doctrine. Landing at a remote airbase, 90 miles southwest of [[Kandahar]], the Marines established [[Camp Rhino]], America's first [[Forward Operating Base]] while maintaining the first significant conventional ground presence in Afghanistan.  The Marines and coalition forces later moved north to [[Kandahar International Airport]] securing a new forward operating base. With the move, the Marines and coalition forces were able to continue with new missions and build a prison camp that housed numerous [[Taliban]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] fighters. 

On [[January 6]], [[2003]], this time onboard the [[USS Tarawa (LHA-1)|USS Tarawa]] [[Amphibious Ready Group|ARG]], the 15th MEU (SOC) departed once again for another deployment. In mid-February, elements of the MEU off-loaded and established a training camp in Northern [[Kuwait]] while other members of the MAGTF &mdash; primarily the helicopter squadron &mdash; remained onboard the Tarawa ARG in the [[Persian Gulf]]. 

During February and March 2003, the MEU was assigned tactical control (TACON) to the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[3 Commando Brigade]] [[Royal Marines]] for [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. On [[March 21]], [[2003]], Marines from the 15th MEU crossed the border into Southern Iraq and secured the ports of [[Umm Qasr]] and [[Az Zubayr]] in order to destroy Iraqi resistance and enable follow-on humanitarian assistance to begin. <ref name="UmmQasarCNN.com"> Umm Qasar, CNN.com, March 2003.</ref> 

In late-March 2003, the MEU again became part of the [[I Marine Expeditionary Force]] and moved to [[An Nasiriyah]], Iraq to relieve the Marines of [[Task Force Tarawa]]. In An Nasiriyah, the 15th MEU secured the remaining sectors of the city, conducted a supporting attack during the rescue of American [[Prisoner of war]] [[Jessica Lynch]] <ref name="15thMEUCNN.com"> 15th MEU, CNN.com, 2003.</ref> and continued to establish security throughout the greater An Nasiriyah area. The MEU provided humanitarian assistance to the local population that included purifying drinking water, and doctors and corpsmen assisted medical care. The MEU began helping establish the local government to include police and other local services in addition to continuing to conduct airborne surveillance and direct-action raids on the ground to seek out and capture any [[Ba’ath Party]] or [[Fedayeen]] resistance. 

In January 2005, the 15th MEU participated in [[Operation Unified Assistance]] by providing disaster relief to survivors of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|massive tsunami]] in [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] and southern [[Sri Lanka]]. Immediately after wrapping up those operations, the 15th MEU proceeded south of [[Baghdad, Iraq]] to Forward Operating Base Falcon near [[Mahmoudiyah|Al-Mahmudiyah]], Babil province, south of for security and stability operations in between rotations of army units.  Their deployment into Iraq lasted about 30 days.

On [[September 13]], [[2006]], the 15th MEU was once again deployed to Iraq.  It left San Diego on the [[USS Boxer (LHD-4)|USS Boxer]], [[USS Dubuque (LPD-8)|USS Dubuque]], and [[USS Comstock (LHD-45)|USS Comstock]] and in mid November began operating in [[Al Anbar]] province as Task Force Bullrush,comprised of elements of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable); Bravo Company, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion; C Company, and 2d Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion.

On February 11, 2007, the unit received notice of its second extension of their deployment in support of President Bush's surge of additional forces into the critical areas of Iraq. The unit remains "an important asset for II MEF Forward, now in command of Multinational Force-West," according to Col. Brian Beaudreault, Commnding Officer. While operating in Al An Bar province much was accomplished in securing the area conducting combat operations in [[Rutbah]], [[Barwana]], [[Haditha]], [[Haqlaniyah]], [[Ramadi]] and [[Al Asad]] in support of Multinational Force-West.

"Our main mission was to defeat insurgent forces in zone, and gain and maintain security along the main supply route that links the two ports of entry with Ramadi.  Critical operations to guarantee that security included defeating insurgents in Rutbah, introducing Iraqi Police and Iraqi Highway Patrol into the area and also disrupting the flow of foreign fighters across the border areas.” said Col. Brian Beaudreault, Commanding Officer, 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable)/[[Task Force Bullrush]].  

TF Bullrush operations have contributed to a more secure, stable, self-governing Iraq, and helped to set the conditions for continued economic and infrastructure development.  Over the past four months, 15th MEU (SOC) detained over 300 suspected insurgents and discovered numerous weapons and munitions caches that included artillery shells, mortar rounds, improvised explosives, rocket launchers, machine guns, small arms, and a variety of other bomb making components.  

In conjunction with Police Transition Team 21 and Iraqi Police Liaison Officers, an aggressive recruiting effort succeeded in enlisting over 100 fully qualified police recruits now attending the Iraqi Police Academy as well as former Iraqi Police officers who volunteered to rejoin the IP force.    
 
"The Marines and sailors have done a phenomenal job out here,” said Beaudreault.  “This Task Force was loaded with talented and dedicated professionals who gave every ounce of their energy to produce the kind of success we achieved in western Anbar. 

“[[Task Force Tarawa]] will undoubtedly maintain the momentum in Rutbah and facilitate even more rapid economic growth and enhanced security as they work side-by-side with the new Iraqi Police force,” said Beaudreault.   


The 15th MEU (SOC) was instrumental in providing MNF-W Commanders with enough time and manpower for the surge in forces to take place, related [[General James T. Conway]], [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]].

“You all stepped up to the plate when we needed folks to fill the void and you’ve done it magnificently,” Conway said. “We’ve seen the difference that’s happened here on your watch and it is absolutely amazing.” The Commandant applauded the numerous successes of the 15th MEU (SOC) while conducting operations in Al Anbar, highlighting the increased cooperation from tribal and religious Iraqi leaders as significant indicators of forward progress. 

“You should be very proud of who you are and what you’ve done over the past several months,” said Conway.



The unit returned to San Diego on May 30, 2007.
