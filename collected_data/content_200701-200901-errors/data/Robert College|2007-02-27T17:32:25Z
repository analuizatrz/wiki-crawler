== History ==
[[Image:United_Flags_of_TR_US.jpeg|250px|thumb|Robert College is an American educational institution in [[Turkey]]]]
In 1863 Robert College was founded in Bebek as the oldest American high school outside the borders of the United States. The school was founded by Christopher Robert (a wealthy American and a philantrophist) and [[Cyrus Hamlin]] (a missionary devoted to education). Six years after its foundation, with the permission ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: "irade") of the [[Ottoman Sultan]], the  campus (South Campus of today's [[Bogazici University]]) was built in Bebek at the ridge of [[Rumelihisarı|Rumelia Fortress]]. The building which was built first was named "Hamlin Hall" in memory of Hamlin. After Hamlin's death, Robert College was successfully administrated by [[George Washburn]] (1877-1903) and [[Caleb Gates]] (1903-1932).
