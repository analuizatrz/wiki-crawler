'''Portugal''', officially the '''Portuguese Republic''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''República Portuguesa''; [[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[ʁɛ'publikɐ puɾtu'gezɐ]}}), located in southwestern [[Europe]] on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], is the westernmost country of mainland Europe. Portugal is bordered by [[Spain]] to the north and east and by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and south. The [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores Islands|Azores]] and [[Madeira]] are also part of Portugal.

The territory which forms the modern Portuguese Republic has witnessed a constant flow of [[civilization]]s during the past 3,100 years, since the earlier [[Pre-Roman Portugal|pre-Roman]] inhabitants, to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], and [[Moors|Moorish]] peoples who made an imprint on the country's culture, history, language, and ethnic composition. During the 15th and 16th centuries, with [[Portuguese empire|its vast transcontinental empire]], Portugal was one of the world's major economic, political, and cultural powers. A [[developed country]], Portugal is a member of the [[European Union]] (since [[1986]]), the [[United Nations]] (since [[1955]]), and a founding member of the [[Eurozone]], [[OECD]], and [[NATO]].

==History==
<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main article: "History of Portugal", your work there will be very appreciated. -->
{{Main|History of Portugal}}
[[Image:PortugueseFlag1095.svg|thumb|left|170px|First [[Flag of Portugal|Portuguese flag]]]]
The early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. The region was visited by [[Phoenicians]] and [[Carthaginians]], settled by [[Celts]], incorporated in the [[Roman empire]] (as [[Lusitania]] in [[138 BC]]), settled again by [[Suevi]], [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]] and [[Visigoths]] and conquered by [[Muslims]]. In [[868]], during the [[Reconquista]], the [[County of Portugal]] was formed. A victory over the Muslims at [[Ourique]] in [[1139]] is traditionally taken as the occasion when Portugal is transformed from a county into an [[Portuguese monarchy|independent kingdom]].

In fact, Portugal came into existence as an independent nation on [[June 24]] [[1128]], when [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]], Count of Portugal, defeated his mother, [[Teresa, Countess of Portugal|Countess Teresa]], and her lover, [[Fernão Peres de Trava]], in battle - thereby establishing himself as sole leader. Afonso Henriques proclaimed himself [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal]] on [[July 25]], [[1139]], after the [[Battle of Ourique]] and was recognized as such in [[1143]] by [[Alfonso VII of León|Alfonso VII]], king of León and Castile, and in [[1179]] by [[Pope Alexander III]]. 

Afonso and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors, as the size of Portugal covered about half of its present area. In [[1249]], this [[Reconquista]] ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present day borders, with minor exceptions.
[[Image:Pt-gmr-castelo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Castle of Guimarães]], known as the "Cradle of Portugal", [[Guimarães]]]]
In 1373, Portugal made an [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|alliance with England]], which is the longest-standing alliance in the world.

In 1383, the king of Castile, husband of the daughter of the Portuguese king who had died without a male heir, claimed his throne. An ensuing popular revolt led to the [[1383-1385 Crisis]]. A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later [[John I of Portugal|John I]]), seconded by General [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]], defeated the Castilians in the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]]. This celebrated battle is still a symbol of glory and the struggle for independence from neighboring Spain.

In the following decades, Portugal spearheaded the exploration of the world and undertook the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Age of Discovery]]. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], son of King João I, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavor.

In 1415, the [[Portuguese empire]] arose when a fleet conquered [[Ceuta]], a prosperous Islamic trade center in North [[Africa]]. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], which led to the first [[colonialism|colonization]] movements.
[[Image:Henry the Navigator.jpg|left|190px|thumb|''[[Padrão dos Descobrimentos]]'', a monument to [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] and the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Portuguese Age of Discovery]], [[Lisbon]]]]
Throughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe. In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] finally reached India and brought economic prosperity to Portugal and its then population of one million residents.

In 1500, [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] landed in [[Brazil]] and claimed it for Portugal. Ten years later, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Goa]], in [[India]], [[Ormuz]] in the Persian Strait, and [[Malacca]] in what is now [[Malaysia]]. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the [[Indian Ocean]] and South Atlantic.

Portugal's independence was interrupted between 1580 and 1640. Because the heirless King [[Sebastião of Portugal|Sebastian]] died in battle in Morocco, [[Philip II of Spain]] claimed his throne and so became Philip I of Portugal. Although Portugal did not lose its formal independence, it was governed by the same monarch who governed Spain, briefly forming a union of kingdoms; in 1640, [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king. This was the beginning of the long-lived [[House of Braganza|dynasty of Braganza]]. 

By this time, however, the [[Portuguese empire]] was already under attack from other countries, specifically Britain and the Netherlands. Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline until the 20th century. This decline was hastened by the independence in 1822 of the country's largest colonial possession, [[Brazil]]. 

In 1910, a revolution deposed the [[Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese monarchy]], but chaos continued and considerable economic problems were aggravated by the [[Portugal in the Great War|military intervention in the First World War]], which led to a [[28 May 1926 coup d'état|military coup d'état in 1926]]. This in turn led to the establishment of a right-wing dictatorship by [[António de Oliveira Salazar]].

In the early 1960s, independence movements in the colonies of [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Portuguese Guinea]] resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. In 1974, a bloodless left-wing [[Carnation Revolution|military coup]] known as the [[Carnation Revolution]] led the way for a modern democracy as well as the independence of the last colonies in Africa shortly after. Portugal joined the [[European Union]] in 1986, and ever since it has engaged in a process of convergence with its [[EU]] counterparts.

==Government and Politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
[[Image:Assembleia Republica Portugal 3.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Assembly of the Republic]], [[Lisbon]]]]
{{morepolitics|country=Portugal}}

Unlike its eastern neighbor [[Spain]], which is a [[constitutional monarchy]]; Portugal is a democratic republic ruled by the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1976|constitution of 1976]] with [[Lisbon]], the nation's largest city, as its capital. 
The four main governing components are the [[List of Presidents of Portugal|president of the republic]], the [[assembly of the republic]], the [[Government of Portugal|government]], and the courts. The constitution grants the complete separation of powers among legislative, executive, and judicial branches.

The president, who is elected to a five-year term, has a supervising, nonexecutive role. The Assembly of the Republic is a [[unicameral]] parliament composed of 230 deputies elected for four-year terms.

The government is headed by the [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|prime minister]], who chooses the Council of Ministers, comprising all the ministers and the respective state secretaries. The national and regional governments, and the [[Assembly of the Republic|Portuguese parliament]], are dominated by two political parties, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]]. Minority parties [[Unitarian Democratic Coalition|CDU]] ([[Portuguese Communist Party]] plus [[Ecologist Party "The Greens"]]), [[Left Bloc|Bloco de Esquerda]] (Left Bloc) and [[People's Party|CDS-PP]] (People's Party) are also represented in the [[Assembly of the Republic|parliament]] and local governments.

The [[courts]] are organized into categories, including judicial, administrative, and fiscal. The [[Portuguese Supreme Court|supreme court]]s are the courts of last appeal. A thirteen-member [[Portuguese Constitutional Court|constitutional court]] oversees the constitutionality of legislation.

==Foreign Relations and Military==

{{main|Foreign Relations of Portugal|Military of Portugal}}
[[Image:F16am-5z.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] of the [[Portuguese Air Force]]]]
Portugal has been a member of [[NATO]] since 1949, the [[European Union]] since 1986, and the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] since 1996. It has a friendship alliance and [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] treaty with Brazil. It has good relations with the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[PRC|China]] (due to [[Macau]]), as well as the other [[European Union]] countries.

The only international dispute concerns the municipality of [[Olivenza|Olivença]], which Spain received in 1801 under the [[War of the Oranges|Treaty of Badajoz]] and has since administered. Portugal claimed it in 1815 under the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]]. Nevertheless, diplomatic relations between the two countries are cordial.

The armed forces have three branches: [[Portuguese Army|Army]], [[Portuguese Navy|Navy]], and [[Portuguese Air Force|Air Force]]. In the 20th century, Portugal engaged in two major military interventions: the [[Portugal in the Great War|First Great War]] and the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]] (1961-1974). Portugal has participated in peacekeeping missions in [[East Timor]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] ([[Nasiriyah]]), and [[Lebanon]].

==Administrative Divisions==

[[Image:Portugal NUTS II.svg|thumb|250px|right|Map of [[Mainland Portugal]] and the two [[autonomous regions of Portugal]] (not in their actual locations)]]
{{main|Administrative divisions of Portugal}}
Portugal has an administrative structure of 308 [[municipalities of Portugal|municipalities]] (Portuguese singular/plural: ''concelho/concelhos''), which are subdivided into more than 4,000 parishes (''freguesia/freguesias''). Municipalities are grouped for administrative purposes into superior units. For continental Portugal the municipalities are gathered in 18 Districts, while the Islands have a Regional Government directly above them. Thus, the largest unit of classification are the ones established since 1976 into either [[mainland Portugal]] (''Portugal Continental'') or the [[autonomous regions of Portugal]] ([[Azores]] and [[Madeira]]).

==Geography and Climate==

{{main|Geography of Portugal|Conservation areas of Portugal}}
[[Image:Praia do Tamariz - Estoril.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tamariz beach, [[Estoril]] - Portugal is widely known in Europe for its beach resorts]]

The climate can be classified as [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] in the north and [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] in the south. One of the warmest European countries, yearly temperature averages in [[mainland Portugal]] are 13°C (55°F) in the north and 18°C (64°F) in the south. The [[Madeira]] and [[Azores]] Atlantic archipelagos have a narrower temperature range. Spring and summer are sunny, whereas autumn and winter are rainy and windy.

[[Continental Portugal|Mainland Portugal]] is split by its main river, the [[Tagus]]. The northern landscape is mountainous in interior areas, with plateaus indented by river valleys. The south, between the [[Tagus]] and the [[Algarve]] (the [[Alentejo]]), features mostly rolling plains and a climate somewhat warmer and drier than in the cooler and rainier north. The [[Algarve]], separated from the [[Alentejo]] by mountains, enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate]] like southern Spain. [[Snow]] is usual in the northern half of the country, around the 40 N parallel. It is a rare event in the south, but it does happen. 

The islands of the Azores and Madeira are located in the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. Some islands have had volcanic activity as recently as 1957. Portugal's highest point is [[Mount Pico]] on [[Pico Island]]. It is an ancient volcano measuring 2,351 m (7,713 ft).

{{main|Economy of Portugal}}
Portugal joined the [[European Union]] in [[1986]] and started a process of modernization within the framework of a stable environment. It has achieved a healthy level of growth. Successive governments have implemented reforms and privatized many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the economy. Portugal was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] in [[1999]].

Major industries include [[oil refineries]], [[automotive]], [[cement]] production, [[pulp and paper industry]], [[textile]], [[footwear]], [[furniture]], and [[cork (material)|cork]] (the world's leading producer).<ref>''Grande Enciclopédia Universal'', p. 10543, "Portugal", para. 4</ref> Agriculture no longer represents the bulk of the economy, but [[Portuguese wines]], namely [[Port Wine]] (named after the country's second largest city, [[Porto]]) and [[Madeira Wine]] (named after [[Madeira Island]]), are exported worldwide. [[Tourism]] is also important, especially in the [[Algarve]] and [[Madeira Islands]]. 

The Global Competitiveness Report for 2005, published by the [[World Economic Forum]], places Portugal on the 22nd position, ahead of countries like [[Spain]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[Hong Kong]]. This table shows that Portugal has stepped two places regarding the 2004 ranking. On the Technology index, Portugal was ranked 20th and on the Public Institutions index Portugal is the 15th best. [http://www.investinportugal.pt/MCMSAPI/HomePage/NewsRoom/PORTUGAL+IMPROVES+ITS+POSITION+IN+THE+WEF+COMPETITIVENESS+RANKING.htm]

A research about [[standard of living]] by [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] or EIU [http://www.economist.com/theworldin/international/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3372495&d=2005 Quality-of-life Survey] places Portugal as the 20th country with best quality of life in the world.

==Energy, Transportation and Communications==
<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: "Transportation in Portugal" and "Communications in Portugal", your work there will be very appreciated. -->
[[Image:Alqueva3.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Alqueva Dam]] - one of the largest Portuguese [[hydroelectric power]] generation facilities.]]
{{main|Transportation in Portugal|Communications in Portugal}}
In 2006 the world's largest [[solar power]] plant began operating in the nation's sunny south while the world's first commercial [[wave power]] farm opened in October 2006 in the [[Norte region]]. As of 2006, 55% of electricity production was from coal and fuel power plants. The other 40% was produced by [[hydroelectric]]s and 5% by [[wind energy]]. The government is channeling $3.8 billion into developing [[renewable energy]] sources over the next five years.

Portugal wants [[renewable energy]] sources like solar, wind and wave power to account for nearly half of the electricity consumed in the country by [[2010]]. "This new goal will place Portugal in the frontline of renewable energy and make it, along with [[Austria]] and [[Sweden]], one of the three nations that most invest in this sector", Prime Minister [[Jose Socrates]] said. 
[[Image:tap.a330-200.cs-toe.arp.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Airbus A330]]-200 from national airline [[TAP Portugal]].]]
Transportation was seen as a priority in the 1990s, pushed by the growing use of automobiles and industrialization. The country has a 68,732 km (42,708 mi) network of roads, of which 2,000 km (1,240 mi) are part of 44 [[motorway]]s.

The two principal metropolitan areas have subway systems: [[Lisbon Metro]] and Metro Sul do Tejo (in final stages of completion) in Lisbon and [[Porto Metro]] in Porto, each with more than 35 km (22&nbsp;mi) of lines. Construction of a high-speed [[TGV]] line connecting Porto with Lisbon and Lisbon with Madrid will begin in 2008; it will replace the [[Pendolino]]s. [[Ota Airport]] will replace the present Lisbon airport. Currently, the most important airports are in [[Portela Airport|Lisbon]], [[Faro Airport (Portugal)|Faro]], [[Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport|Porto]], [[Funchal]] ([[Madeira]]), and [[Ponta Delgada]] ([[Azores]]).

Portugal has one of the highest [[mobile phone]] penetration rates in the [[world]] (the number of operative mobile phones already exceeds the population). As of October 2006, 36.8% of households had high-speed Internet services and 78% of companies had Internet access. Most Portuguese watch television through cable (June 2004: 73.6% of households).

==Demographics==

{{main|Demographics of Portugal}}
[[Image:Lisbon10.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Lisbon]]'s downtown]]
The country is fairly homogeneous linguistically and religiously. Native [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] are ethnically a combination of pre-Roman [[Iberians]] and [[Celts|Celtics]] with some [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], and [[Moors|Moorish]] influences, among other minor contributions.

In the 2001 census, the population was 10,356,117, of which 51.7% was female. By the end of 2003, legal [[immigrants]] represented 4.2% of the population, and the largest communities were from [[Ukraine]], [[Romania]], [[Brazil]], [[Cape Verde]], and [[Angola]], with other immigrants from parts of [[Latin America]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. The great majority of Portuguese are [[Catholic Church in Portugal|Roman Catholic]]. The biggest metropolitan areas are [[Lisbon]], [[Porto]], [[Braga]], [[Coimbra]], [[Setúbal]] and [[Aveiro]].

Portugal, long a country of emigration, has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the former [[India]]n and [[Africa]]n [[Portuguese empire|colonies]]. Today, many [[Eastern Europe|Eastern Europeans]] (especially [[Ukraine|Ukrainians]], [[Moldavia|Moldavians]], [[Romania|Romanians]] and [[Russia|Russians]]), as well as [[Brazil]]ians, are making Portugal their home. There is a rapidly growing community of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and a notable number of [[Macanese people|Macanese]], who are descendants of Chinese and Portuguese settlers, with some [[Malay people|Malays]] and [[Indians]].

[[Image:Coimbra University Tower 2.jpg|right|thumb|The tower of the [[University of Coimbra]], [[Coimbra]]]]
{{main|Education in Portugal|Higher education in Portugal}}
The educational system is divided into preschool (for those under age 6), basic education (9 years, in three stages, [[compulsory]]), [[secondary education]] (3 years), and [[higher education]] ([[university]] and [[polytechnic]]).

Portuguese universities have existed since [[1290]]. The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]] was first established in [[Lisbon]] before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Universities are usually organized into [[faculty (university)|faculties]]. Institutes and schools are also common designations for autonomous subdivisions of [[list of colleges and universities in Portugal|Portuguese higher education institutions]], and are always used in the polytechnical system. The [[Bologna process]] has been adopted since 2006 by many universities and polytechnical institutes.

==Law==
<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main article: "Portuguese Legal System", your work there will be very appreciated. -->
{{main|Portuguese Legal System}}
The [[Portuguese legal system]] is part of the civil law legal system, also called the continental family legal system. Until the end of the [[19th century]], [[France|French]] law was the main influence. Since then the major influence has been [[German legal system|German law]]. The main laws include the [[Constitution]] (1976, as amended), the [[Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended). Portuguese law applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continues to be the major influence for those countries.

==Religion==

[[Image:Virgen_de_Fátima.JPG|right|110px|thumb|Image of [[Our Lady of Fatima]], [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]]]]
{{main|Religion in Portugal}}
Portuguese society is overwhelmingly [[Roman Catholic]]. Approximately 97% of the population consider themselves Roman Catholic [http://www.adherents.com/adhloc/Wh_280.html#618], but only about one-third attend mass and take the sacraments regularly. Yet a larger number wish to be baptized, married in the church, and receive last rites. 

The practice of religion shows striking [[regional]] differences. Even in the [[1990s]], 60% to 70% of the population in the north regularly attended religious services, compared with 10% to 15% in the historically [[anti-clerical]] south. In the greater [[Lisbon]] area, about 30% were regular churchgoers.

The sanctuary of [[Our Lady of Fatima]], in [[Fátima, Portugal]], has great religious significance for many [[Catholics]] around the world.

[[Image:Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian Lisboa.JPG|thumb|left|[[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]], [[Lisbon]]]]
Portugal has developed a specific culture while being influenced by various civilizations that have crossed the Mediterranean and the European continent, or were introduced when it played an active role during the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Age of Discovery]].

[[Portuguese literature]], one of the earliest Western literatures, developed through text and song. Until 1350, the [[Portuguese-Galician]] [[troubadour]]s spread their literary influence to most of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref> ''Poesia e Prosa Medievais'', p. 9, para. 4</ref> [[Gil Vicente]] (ca. 1465 - ca. 1536), was one of the founders of both Portuguese and Spanish dramatic traditions. Adventurer and poet [[Luís de Camões]] (ca. 1524-1580) wrote the epic poem ''[[The Lusiads]]'', with [[Vergil]]'s [[Aeneid]] as his main influence. Modern Portuguese poetry is rooted in neoclassic and contemporary styles, as exemplified by [[Fernando Pessoa]] (1888–1935). Modern literature is internationally known through the works of [[Almeida Garrett]], [[Camilo Castelo Branco]], [[Eça de Queirós]], [[Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen]], [[António Lobo Antunes]], and [[1998]] [[Nobel Prize for literature|Nobel Prize]] winner, [[José Saramago]], and others.

The most renowned is [[fado]], a melancholy urban music, usually associated with the [[Portuguese guitar]] and ''saudade'', or longing. [[Coimbra fado]], a unique type of fado, is also noteworthy. Internationally notable performers include [[Amália Rodrigues]], [[Carlos Paredes]], [[Mariza]], [[Mísia]], and [[Madredeus]]. One of the most notable Portuguese musical groups outside the country, and specially in [[Germany]], is the goth-metal band [[Moonspell]]. In addition to fado and folk, the Portuguese listen to pop and other types of modern music. Bands with international recognition include [[Blasted Mechanism]] and [[The Gift (band)|The Gift]], both of which were nominated for an [[MTV Music Award]]. Portugal has several summer music festivals, like ''Festival do Sudoeste'' in [[Zambujeira do Mar]], ''Festival de Paredes de Coura'' in [[Paredes de Coura]], and ''[[Rock in Rio Lisboa]]'' in [[Lisbon]]. Out of the summer season, Portugal has a large number of festivals, designed more to an urban audience, like Flowfest or Hip Hop Porto. Furthermore, one of the largest international [[Goa trance]] festivals takes place in northern Portugal every two years.

It has also a rich history in what painting is concerned. The first well-known painters date back to the XV century – like [[Nuno Gonçalves]] - were part of the Gothic painting period. 
[[José Malhoa]], known for his work ''Fado'', and [[Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro]] (who painted the portraits of [[Teófilo Braga]] and [[Antero de Quental]]) were both references in naturalist painting.

The 20th century saw the arrival of [[Modernism]], and along with it came the most prominent Portuguese painters: [[Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso]], who was heavily influenced by French painters, particularly by the [[Delaunays]]. Among his best known works is ''Canção Popular a Russa e o Fígaro''. Another great modernist painter/writer was [[Almada Negreiros]], friend to the poet [[Fernando Pessoa]], who painted his (Pessoa’s) portrait. He was deeply influenced by both [[Cubist]] and [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] trends. Prominent international figures in visual arts nowadays include painters [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Júlio Pomar]], and [[Paula Rego]].
Traditional architecture is distinctive. Modern Portugal has given the world renowned architects [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]] and [[Álvaro Siza Vieira]]. Internally, [[Tomás Taveira]] is also noteworthy.

Since the 1990s, Portugal has increased the number of public cultural facilities, in addition to the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] established in 1956. These include the [[Belém Cultural Center]] in Lisbon, [[Serralves Foundation]] and the [[Casa da Música]], both in [[Porto]].
