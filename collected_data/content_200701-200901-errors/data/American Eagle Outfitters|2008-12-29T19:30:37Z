'''American Eagle Outfitters''' ({{Nyse|AEO}}) is an [[:Category:Clothing companies of the United States|American clothing and accessories]] retailer based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. It was founded in 1977 by Mark and Jerry Silverman as a subsidiary of [[Retail Ventures|Retail Ventures, Inc.]], a company which also owned and operated [[Silverman's Menswear]]. The Silvermans sold their ownership interests in 1991.<ref>http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/American-Eagle-Outfitters-Inc-Company-History.html</ref>

==Development==
When the Silvermans first opened an American Eagle Outfitters store in 1977, they were looking to diversify their menswear business. Stores were set up in shopping malls and a catalog was established.  The chain grew for much of the 1980s.  In 1989, the owners decided to refocus their business on American Eagle Outfitters, selling their other retail chains.  At this time, there were 137 American Eagle Outfitters stores in 37 states.

Despite the plans for quick growth after the reorganization, American Eagle Outfitters opened only sixteen new stores by 1991 and the company was losing money.  Now the Schottensteins, who had been 50% owners of the chain since 1980, bought out the founding Silverman family's interest.  This change in leadership caused American Eagle to find its present niche: casual clothing for men and women selling [[private label]] clothes.

When the company began trading on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange in the second quarter of 1994, it had 167 stores and a healthy cash flow.  With the cash infusion from the IPO, the company opened more than ninety new stores within the next year.  Several new executives joined the company in 1995 and '96, leading to another change in the target [[demographic]].  The company now wanted to reach more women and focus on people between 16 and 35.

The strategy worked, and over the next five years revenues quintupled to $1bn by 2000.<ref>http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/American-Eagle-Outfitters-Inc-Company-History.html</ref>  American Eagle claimed 1101 stores across three brands (American Eagle Outfitters, Aerie, and Martin + Osa) in November 2008 and $3bn in revenues for the most recent fiscal year.<ref>http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=81256&p=irol-homeprofile</ref>

==Company growth==
American Eagle expanded internationally by entering into [[Canada]]. A second store is open in the White Oaks Mall in London, Ontario, after acquiring some [[Dylex]] divisions in 2000 (Thrifty's, Braemar, & National Logistics). There are now American Eagle stores open all across Canada.

In 2006, 42 new American Eagle stores opened and 65 remodels were completed. Together with five new MARTIN + OSA stores and three new aerie stand-alone test stores, total gross square footage increased 8% for the year. In 2007, the company plans to open 45 to 50 more American Eagle, at least 15 aerie stand-alone, and approximately 12 new MARTIN + OSA stores. Additionally, approximately 45 American Eagle store remodels are planned which, combined with new store openings, will generate total 2007 square footage growth of approximately 10%.<ref>[http://seekingalpha.com/article/45199-american-eagle-outfitters-f2q07-qtr-end-8-4-07-earnings-call-transcript American Eagle Outfitters F2Q07 (Qtr End 8/4/07) James V.
