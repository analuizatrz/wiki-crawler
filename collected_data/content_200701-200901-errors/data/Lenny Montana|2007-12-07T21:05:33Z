'''Lenny Montana''' (born '''Leonardo Passofaro''') ([[March 13]], [[1926]] â€“ [[May 12]], [[1992]]) was an [[USA|American]] [[actor]]. <!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:LucaBrasiComp.jpg|thumb|Lenny Montana meeting his end as Luca Brasi]] -->

He was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] in [[1926]] of [[Italian American]] heritage.  Prior to becoming an actor, Montana was a [[professional wrestler]] and a [[mobster]].

His wrestling carreer started in 1961, Montana came to the Tampa Bay area wrestling under a hood, The Zebra Kid was an intimidating fellow, often pinning his opponents in under one minute.

Montana also wrestled under the names of Lenny 'Bull' Montana and "Chief Chickawicki" in the 1950s and 1960s before turning to acting. 

Montana's first film appearance is probably his most memorable. He played the feared mob enforcer [[Luca Brasi]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'' and despite relatively little on-screen time his performance was quite memorable.

He starred in a number of other movies such as ''[[The Jerk]]'' (1979) and alongside [[Jackie Chan]] in ''[[The Big Brawl]]'' (1980), but retired after making his final movie, ''[[Blood Song]]'', in 1982.

He is the father to a son, [[Lenny Montana .Jr]]

Montana died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1992, 66 years of age.
