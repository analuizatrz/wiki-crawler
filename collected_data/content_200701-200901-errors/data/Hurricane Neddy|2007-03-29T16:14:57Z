==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:4f07.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Ned with Dr. Foster.]]
In midst of a lazy afternoon, the wind starts to pick up, which leads [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] to believe that a [[hurricane]] is coming. The evening news confirms that Hurricane Barbara is close. Panicked citizens invade the [[Kwik-E-Mart]] and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] battens down the Simpson home. The hurricane strikes and after a few hours, the storm ends and the family cautiously leaves their basement. They are thankful to see that their home is fine and Marge comments that everything works out if you have faith. Meanwhile, Flanders emerges from a pile of rubble and sees that his house was destroyed.

Ned is relieved that his family escaped serious injury, but that's of little solace since he does not have homeowner's [[insurance]]. The Flanders family is forced to move into the Rescue Center in the church basement. He is further discouraged after learning that his business, the Leftorium, was [[looting|looted]] following the hurricane. Flanders begins to believe that God is punishing him. Seeking answers, he goes to read the bible, but receives a [[papercut]]. Flanders sits down in the church and speaks about how he is falling apart, even after doing everything the bible says.

The next day, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] arrives at the church and takes the Flanders family back to their house, which was fixed by the people of Springfield. Overjoyed, Flanders inspects the house, but begins to become deflated after seeing how shoddy it is. The house soon collapses and Flanders snaps and begins yelling at everyone in the town, calling Homer the worst human being. Flanders jumps in his car and drives himself to Calmwood Mental Hospital to seek [[therapy]]. 

Flanders is visited by his childhood [[psychiatrist]], Dr. Foster. Dr. Foster tells Flanders of what he used to be like -  an out-of-control child who was raised by beatnik parents who didn't believe in discipline. As a result, the young Flanders went through the University of Minnesota Spankalogical Protocol, which is eight months of continuous [[spanking]]. The treatment worked so well that it rendered Flanders unable to express any anger at all and resulted in his trademark nonsensical jabbering at moments when he was particularly close to losing his temper. This caused Ned to unknowingly repress his anger, until it built up inside him and erupted in his tirade of insults at the townspeople.

Dr. Foster enlists Homer to help Flanders learn how to appropriately express emotions, as Homer is the person that Flanders harbors the most resentful feelings towards. After several failed remarks, Homer gets Flanders to admit that he hates the post office and his beatnik parents. Dr. Foster declares that Flanders is cured and he is immediately released. The entire town gathers Flanders to welcome him back and he says that he will always express his anger.<ref name=officialsite/><ref name="Simpsguide">{{cite book|last=Martyn |first=Warren|coauthors=Adrian Wood|title=I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Virgin Books|id=ISBN 0-7535-0495-2|pages=}}</ref><ref name="SNPP">[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/4F03.html Episode Capsule] at The Simpsons Archive</ref><ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00063-8898-1|pages=p. 173}}</ref>

[[Steve Young (writer)|Steve Young]], a writer for the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', was brought in as a freelance writer to do this episode.<ref name="Weinstein">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Hurricane Neddy"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The original idea for this episode came from [[George Meyer]], who wanted an episode about Flanders's faith being tested.<ref name="Meyer">{{cite video | people=Meyer, George|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Hurricane Neddy"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> One of the key story points came from his friend [[Jack Handey]], a writer for [[Saturday Night Live]]. Handey and Meyer had wanted to do a sketch about a down on his luck shoemaker who is visited by a bunch of elves who help him, but make very bad shoes. That inspired the idea that the neighbors would rebuild Flanders's house, but do a bad job and provoke an outburst.<ref name="Meyer"/> The writers had wanted to explore what made Flanders tick and examine what made him act the way he does.<ref name="Weinstein"/> Flanders's breakdown has been compared to [[Frank Grimes]]'s breakdown in "[[Homer's Enemy]]".<ref name="Weinstein"/>

[[John Swartzwelder]] can be seen shutting the door of a room in Calmwood Mental Hospital.<ref name="Weinstein"/> Later in the episode during the scene where the townfolk are welcoming Ned back, someone can be seen holding a sign that says "Free John Swartzwelder."<ref name="Meyer"/> During the the sequence where Flanders snaps and screams at the town, a man with a ponytail and wearing a white shirt who is a caricature of [[Bob Anderson (director)|Bob Anderson]] can be seen.<ref name="Anderson">{{cite video | people=Anderson, Bob|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Hurricane Neddy"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

==Reception==
A line of dialogue by Marge, "Dear God, this is Marge Simpson. If you stop this hurricane and save our family, we will be forever grateful and recommend you to all our friends," was cited by journalist Mark Pinsky as an example of how "Simpson family members are both defined and circumscribed by religion."<ref>Victoria Combe, "Praise and glory to the God-fearing Homer Simpson: Chaotic cartoon family criticized as dysfunctional is defined by religion, journalist says in book," ''Standard'', St. Catharines, Ontario: August 31, 2001, pg. A.1.FRO.</ref>  A journalist speculated some fans, whom he called "[[nerd]]s," would want an explanation of "how Barney fit through that tiny door to the 'master bedroom' in the rebuilt Flanders family home."<ref>Ben Rayner, "Offering up the goods on Springfield's finest; The Simpsons have breached the boundaries of animation. Today a director details how they do it, writes Ben Rayner," ''[[Toronto Star]]'', October 30, 2005, pg. C.06.</ref> The episode earned a 7.5/10 on [[IMDB]]<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0701131/ Hurricane Neddy] ''IMDB''.
