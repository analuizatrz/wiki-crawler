'''Tenacious D''' is an [[United States|American]] [[satirical]] [[rock music|rock]] duo formed by  musicians and actors [[Kyle Gass]] and [[Jack Black]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1994.

=== Tours ===
[[Image:Saxaboom.jpg|thumb|Tenacious D performing with the [[Sax-a-boom]]]]
In 2001, Tenacious D started their second nationwide [[Concert|concert tour]], performing at larger venues, many of which sold out.<ref name="AMG" /> Until 2006, Tenacious D usually performed only with acoustic guitars, rarely with a full band. Tenacious D has also staged two international concert tours as well as numerous domestic tours,<ref> {{cite web|url=http://tenaciousd.com/tour.html |title=Tour |accessdate=2008-04-07 |publisher=Tenacious D's official website }}</ref> though they have rarely played in non-English speaking countries. Black says this is because foreign concerts are "a little funky" because "the subtleties do get lost in translation".<ref name="Relix" /> In addition, he comments on the angst they experience before concerts saying: "We're always looking for a loophole. Pretty much every concert we've ever done, we're trying to find a way to cancel the show at the last minute."<ref name="Relix" />
[[Andy Serkis]] appeared as live show with them, as [[Gollum]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tenacious D Feat. Andy Serkis (GOLLUM) LIVE |work=[[YouTube]] |date=[[September 22]] [[2006]] |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG2FzHjzJj8 |accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref>
