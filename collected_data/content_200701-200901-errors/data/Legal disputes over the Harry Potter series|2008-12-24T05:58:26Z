Since first coming to wide notice in the late 1990s, the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book series by [[J. K. Rowling]] has engendered a number of legal disputes. Rowling, her various publishers and [[Time Warner]], the owner of the rights to the [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' films]], have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyrights, and also have fielded accusations of copyright theft themselves.<ref name="Potter author zaps court rival">{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/UK/09/19/rowling.court/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|title=Potter author zaps court rival|date=2002-07-19|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> The worldwide popularity of the ''Harry Potter'' series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them.<ref name=yemets>{{cite web|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2846105.stm|title=Rowling seeks 'Grotter' ban|publisher= [[BBC News]]|date=2003-03-13|accessdate=2006-03-31}}</ref> While these legal proceedings have countered a number of cases of outright piracy,<ref name=walkup>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2092661.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=Fake Harry Potter novel hits China|date=2002-07-04|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> other attempts have targeted not-for-profit endeavours and have been criticised as too draconian.<ref name=Claire>{{cite web|title=Warner Brothers bullying ruins Field family Xmas|author=Kieren McCarthy|publisher=The Register|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/12/21/warner_brothers_bullying_ruins_field/ |date=2000-12-21|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> 

Another area of legal dispute involves a series of injunctions obtained by Rowling and her publishers to prohibit anyone from reading her books before their official release dates. The sweeping powers of these injunctions have occasionally drawn fire from civil liberties and free speech campaigners and sparked debates over the "right to read".<ref name="Don't Buy Harry Potter Books">{{cite web|url=http://stallman.org/harry-potter.html|title=Don't Buy Harry Potter Books|year=2005|author=Richard Stallman|publisher=stallman.org|accessdate=2007-03-13|name= Richard Stallman}}</ref><ref name=geist>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter and the Right to Read|author=Michael Geist|publisher=michaelgeist.ca|url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=896|date=2005-07-17|accessdate=2007-10-12}}{{cite web|work=The [[Toronto Star]]|date=2005-07-18|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/868524161.html?dids=868524161:868524161&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jul+18%2C+2005&author=Michael+Geist&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=C.03&desc=Harry+Potter+and+the+amazing+injunction|title=Appeared in|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> The powers afforded by these injunctions have even been used in subsequent cases unrelated to publishing.<ref name=injunction>{{cite web|title=Hampshire Waste Services Ltd v.

Outside these controversies, a number of particular incidents related to ''Harry Potter'' have also led, or almost led, to legal action. In 2005 a man was sentenced to four years in prison after firing a gun at a journalist during a staged deal for stolen pages from an unreleased ''Harry Potter'' novel,<ref name=corby>{{cite web|title=Man jailed for Potter theft|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/jan/19/pressandpublishing.ukcrime|date=2006-01-19|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> while in 2007 [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] contemplated legal action against the supermarket chain [[Asda]] for libel after the company accused them of overpricing the final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite web|title=Asda barred from selling seventh Harry Potter|author=Nigel Reynolds|work=The Telegraph|date=2007-07-17|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1557690/Asda-barred-from-selling-seventh-Harry-Potter.html|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>

== Allegations of copyright and trademark infringement==
===Nancy Stouffer===
In 1999, American author Nancy Kathleen Stouffer alleged [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] [[infringement]] by Rowling of her 1984 works ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'' (ISBN 1-58989-400-6) and ''Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly''.<ref name="Potter author zaps court rival" /> The primary basis for Stouffer's case rested in her own purported invention of the word "[[Muggle]]s", the name of a race of [[mutant]] [[humanoids]] in ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'', and Larry Potter, the title character of a series of activity booklets for children. Larry Potter, like Harry Potter, is a bespectacled boy with dark hair,<ref name="Muggle Versus Wizard"/> though he is not a character in ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles''.<ref>{{cite web|title='Harry Potter' Prevails In Court|author=Hillel Italie|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/19/print/main522563.shtml|publisher=CBS News|date=2002-09-19|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref> Stouffer also drew a number of other comparisons, such as a castle on a lake, a receiving room and wooden doors.<ref name="Muggle Versus Wizard">{{cite web|url=http://discuss.washingtonpost.com/zforum/01/author_stouffer032801.htm|work = The Washington Post|title=Muggle Versus Wizard|date=2001-03-28|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Portions of ''Rah'' were originally published in booklet form by Ande Publishing Company in 1986, a company founded by Stouffer together with a group of friends and family.<ref name="opinion">Scholastic, Inc. v.

Rowling, along with [[Scholastic Press]] (her American publisher) and [[Warner Bros.]] (holders of the series' film rights), pre-empted Stouffer in 2002 with a suit of their own seeking a declaratory judgment that they had not infringed on any of Stouffer's works. The court found in their favour, stating that "no reasonable juror could find a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the two parties' works".<ref name=opinion/> During the course of the trial, it was proven "by clear and convincing  evidence, that Stouffer has perpetrated a fraud on the Court through her submission of fraudulent documents as well as through her untruthful testimony",<ref name="opinion" /> including changing pages years after the fact to retroactively insert the word "muggle".<ref name="opinion" /> Her case was dismissed with prejudice and she was fined $50,000 for her "pattern of intentional bad faith conduct" in relation to her employment of fraudulent submissions, along with being ordered to pay a portion of the plaintiffs' legal fees.<ref name="opinion" /> 

''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'' is currently out of print. In the spring of 2001, it was published by Thurman House, LLC, a Maryland publishing company.<ref name="opinion" />  Thurman House, formed by Ottenheimer Publishers to republish the works of Nancy Stouffer, was closed when Ottenheimer ceased operations in 2002 after filing for bankruptcy.<ref name="pw">{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA222465.html?pubdate=6%2F17%2F2002&display=archive|title= Ottenheimer Closing Down|work=Publishers Weekly|date=2002-06-17 June|accessdate=2008-09-19}}</ref> Stouffer later asserted that any copies of the book published by Thurman House are unauthorised because the publisher failed to honour its contractual obligations to her.<ref name= "unauth">{{cite web|title=realmuggles.com|author=Nancy Stouffer|url=http://www.realmuggles.com/action.html#notice1|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> Stouffer appealed the decision in 2004, but in 2005 the appeals court upheld the ruling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realmuggles.com/COMPLETE_RULE_60_APPEAL_FOR_REALMUGGLES.pdf|title=Nancy Stouffer: Appeal request|year=2005|publisher=realmuggles.com|accessdate=2008-11-17}}</ref> She states on her website that she is planning to republish her books and is entertaining the possibility of another lawsuit against Warner Bros., J.

===Claire Field===
In 2000, in the lead-up to the release of the first ''Harry Potter'' film, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Warner Bros., the film's distributor, sent a series of letters to owners of ''Harry Potter'' fansites, demanding that, to protect their copyright, they hand over their domain names.<ref name=Claire/> The action resulted in negative publicity for the company when Claire Field, the then 15-year-old webmaster of the British fansite harrypotterguide.co.uk, was reduced to tears by what were described by her father as unnecessary bully tactics. Eventually the corporation backed down in the face of media opposition and declared that, as the site was non-commercial, it did not violate the trademark.<ref name=Claire /><ref>{{cite web|title=Warner Bros backs down on Harry Potter Web site|author=Kieren McCarthy|publisher=The Register|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/12/15/warner_bros_backs_down/ |date= 2000-12-15|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref>

===Unauthorised Chinese ''Harry Potter'' books===
In 2002, an unauthorised [[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] sequel titled ''Harry Potter and Bao Zoulong'' (哈利波特与豹走龙) appeared for sale in the People's Republic of China. (In English-language media this was mistranslated as ''Harry Potter and Leopard-Walk-Up-to-Dragon''.)
According to translated excerpts, the book principally consists of the text of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'', but with most names changed to those of ''Harry Potter'' characters.<ref name="i">

In November 2002, the Bashu Publishing House, in the southwestern city of [[Chengdu]], agreed to pay a £1,600 (US$3,400) fine and publish an apology in China's ''Legal Times'' for printing and distributing the novel.<ref name="t">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article820428.ece Legal magic spells win for Harry in China] Oliver August and Jack Malvern, ''The Times'', 2002-11-02 Retrieved on: [[2007-09-25]]</ref> As of 2007, the identity of the anonymous "author" has not been discovered.

===Dmitri Yemets===
{{main|Tanya Grotter}}
In 2003, courts in the [[Netherlands]] prevented the distribution of a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translation of ''Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass'', the first of [[Dmitri Yemets]]' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate [[copyright]] law. Yemets and his original [[Moscow]]-based publishers, [[Eksmo]], argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright.<ref name=yemets /> The Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus were not allowed to be sold in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rowling blocks Grotter release|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2914111.stm|date=2003-04-03|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> 

Later that year, as the Dutch translation ''Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas'' was still legal in Belgium, the [[Flemish Region|Flemish]] publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was [[plagiarism]], hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue.<ref name=Dutch>[http://binnenland.nieuws.nl/40972 'Tanja Grotter' wel in België te lezen], Nieuws.nl, 2003-09-25.

===Wyrd Sisters===
In 2005, Warner Bros. offered CAD$50,000 ($49,000) to the Canadian folk band the [[Wyrd Sisters (band)|Wyrd Sisters]] for the rights to use their name in the film version of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.<ref name=chart>{{cite web|title=Winnipeg's Wyrd Sisters Still Fighting Harry Potter|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/41504/winnipegs-wyrd-sisters-still-fighting-harry-potter|date=2006-04-07|publisher=[[Chart (magazine)|''Chart'' magazine]]|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref> Rowling had written a scene in the novel in which a band called the [[The Weird Sisters (Harry Potter)|Weird Sisters]] appeared at a school dance, and the group owned the rights to the name in Canada.

In November 2007, Rowling discussed the case on her website, listing the rumours that she had targeted a non-profit organisation as "Toxic" and saying, "The defendants were not religious charities, and theirs was not a religious celebration. On the contrary, it was a large-scale, commercial, sponsored event involving corporations that included a major Indian high street bank. The event was, however, set up while a Hindu festival was going on&nbsp;... The court ruled that Warner Bros. rights had indeed been infringed, and that events such as the one in question would need Warner Bros.' permission in the future.

In August 2008, Warner Bros. filed a lawsuit against production company Mirchi Movies due to the similarity of the title of their [[Bollywood]] film ''Hari Puttar: A Comedy of Terrors'' to the ''Harry Potter'' film series. Mirchi Movies CEO Munish Purii claimed there is very little similarity between Hari Puttar and any elements in the ''Harry Potter'' franchise, and explained that Hari is a popular Indian name, while "puttar" means "son" in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], although Indian versions of ''Harry Potter'' also translate Harry's name to Hari Puttar.<ref>{{cite web|title=India's "Hari Puttar" caught in Harry Potter spell|work=NewsDaily|date=2008-08-27|url=http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/sp236913-india-potter/|accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref> The film has been delayed until late September. Warner Bros. claimed that the title was confusing, but Mirchi Movies claimed they registered the name in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Court delays Puttar film release|author=Karishma Vaswani|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7612809.stm|date=2008-09-12|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> On 24 September 2008, the court in Delhi rejected Warner Bros.' claim, saying that ''Harry Potter'' readers were sufficiently able to distinguish between the two works. They also accused Warner Bros. of delaying the action, since they were aware of the film as far back as 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harri Puttar free to cast its spell at Indian box-office|author=Anil Sinanan|work=[[The Times]]|date= 2008-09-25|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/bollywood/article4820747.ece|accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref>

==Legal injunctions==
[[Image:Harry Potter VI boxes.jpg|thumb|300 px|Boxes of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' awaiting delivery]]
Rowling and her publishers have brought a series of legal [[injunction]]s to ensure the books' secrecy before their launch. These injunctions have drawn criticism from [[civil liberties]] campaigners over their potentially sweeping powers over individual freedoms.

In 2003, in an attempt to maintain secrecy over the impending release of the fifth ''Harry Potter'' book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Rowling and her publishers sought and received a groundbreaking injunction against "the person or persons who has or have physical possession of a copy of the said book or any part thereof without the consent of the Claimants".<ref name=injunction /> The ruling obtained, for the first time  in British law, an injunction against unnamed or unknown individuals; before then, injunctions could only be obtained against named individuals. Lawyers Winterbothams noted that, "The new ''Harry Potter'' style injunction could be used if you expected a demonstration or trespass to take place, but which had not yet begun, so long as you could find a description for the people expected which the Court was satisfied identified 'those who are included and those who are not'".<ref name=injunction /> This principle was later used against a camp of [[Romani people|Roma]] travellers.<ref name=injunction /> In 2006, pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline]] employed the injunction against anonymous animal rights campaigners who had sent threatening letters to their investors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animal extremists can no longer hide behind a web of secrecy |author=Dan Tench |work=[[The Times]] |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article722258.ece |date= 2006-05-23 |accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

The series garnered more controversy in 2005 with the release of the sixth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', when a [[Real Canadian Superstore]] grocery store accidentally sold several copies before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, [[Raincoast Books]], obtained an injunction from the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] prohibiting the purchasers from reading the books in their possession. A comment by media lawyer Korieh Duodu that "there is no human right to read" led to a debate in the public sphere about whether free access to information was a human right. [[Michael Geist]], the [[Canada Research Chair]] of Internet and E-commerce Law at the [[University of Ottawa]], said in response, "The copyright law claim was particularly puzzling. While copyright law does provide copyright owners with a basket of exclusive rights, the right to prohibit reading is not among them. In fact, copyright law has very little to say about what people can do with a book once they have purchased it."<ref name=geist /><ref>{{cite web|title=Reading ban on leaked Harry Potter |author=Jack Malvern |work=[[the Times]]|date= 2005-07-13|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article543318.ece|accessdate=2007-10-11}}</ref> Free-speech activist [[Richard Stallman]] posted a statement on his blog calling for a boycott until the publisher issued an apology.<ref name="Don't Buy Harry Potter Books" /> Solicitors Fraser Milner and Casgrain, who represented Raincoast and formulated the legal argument for the embargo,<ref>{{cite web|title=Important Notice: Raincoast Books |publisher=Raincoast Books |url=http://www.raincoast.com/harrypotter/injunction-commentary.html |date= 2005-08-25|accessdate=2007-10-27}}</ref> have rebutted this, saying that the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] applies only to the government, not to private litigation, and does not offer any protection of the right to read in any case, and the innocent purchasers of the ''Harry Potter'' book had no more right to read it than if they had come into possession of someone's secret diary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Understanding the Harry Potter Injunction: Protecting Copyright and Confidential Information |author=Barbara Grossman, Aaron Milrad and Annie Na |publisher=Fraser Milner and Casgrain |url=http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/20052006/655380_HarryPotterInjunction_October21_2005.pdf |format=PDF|year=2005 |accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>  

In 2007, [[Scholastic Corporation]] threatened legal action against two booksellers, Levy Home Entertainment and DeepDiscount.com, for selling copies of the final novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', before its release date of 21 July. In an official statement, Scholastic appealed "to the ''Harry Potter'' fans who bought their books from DeepDiscount.com and may receive copies early requesting that they keep the packages hidden until midnight on 21 July."<ref>{{cite web|title=Scholastic will take action against Harry Potter distributors |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-07-18 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSWEN939320070718 |accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref> Customers who agreed not to read the book received a special ''Harry Potter'' t-shirt and a $50 coupon for Scholastic's online store.

===Blackmail===
In June 2005, Aaron Lambert, a security guard at a book distribution centre in [[Corby]], [[Northamptonshire]], England, stole a number of pages from ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' six weeks before its intended publication date. He was arrested a day later after negotiations to sell them to John Askill, a journalist from ''[[The Sun]]'', turned violent. Lambert reportedly fired a shot from his imitation [[Walther PPK]] pistol, but Askill was unharmed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guard admits to Harry Potter theft|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/4327346.stm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080124150123/http://www.jrrobertssecurity.com/security-news/security-crime-news0082.htm|archivedate=2008-01-24|date=2005-10-13|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>  At his trial the following October, Lambert pleaded guilty to threatening Askill and to attempting to blackmail ''Harry Potter'''s publishers, [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Potter book thief admits threats|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/4546164.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2005-12-20|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> In January 2006, Lambert was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.<ref name=corby/>

===Accusation of libel===
[[Image:ASDA Gosforth.jpg|thumb|300 px|The supermarket Asda]]
In July 2007, a dispute arose between ''Harry Potter'''s British publisher, [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], and [[Asda]], a British supermarket chain owned by the US corporation [[Wal-Mart]]. On 15 July, a week before the release of the final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Asda issued a press release accusing Bloomsbury of unfairly fixing their prices. Asda spokesman Peter Pritchard claimed that Bloomsbury was "holding children to ransom" and that, "[i]t seems like Bloomsbury need to do a [[Quidditch|quid-ditch]] as they have sent their prices up north on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. By setting the [[Suggested retail price|recommended retail price]] at this level can only be seen [''sic''] as blatant profiteering on their part."<ref name=telegraph /> Pritchard went on to say that Asda was acting to "champion the right of young readers", and that the recommended retail price was "twice the average child's pocket money and £5 more than the average children's bestseller".<ref name=telegraph /> Asda had planned to sell the book as a [[loss leader]] at £8.87 ($16.30), or half Bloomsbury's [[recommended retail price]] of £17.99 ($33.00) and below the [[wholesale]] price of £9.89 ($18.00).<ref>{{cite web|title=Potter book firm clashes with supermarket over price|work=[[The Times]]|date=2007-07-17|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2089458.ece|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>

Two days later, Bloomsbury responded that the claims were "potentially libellous" and that:
<blockquote>
Asda's latest attempt to draw attention to themselves involves trying to leap on the ''Harry Potter'' bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and have nothing to do with Bloomsbury Publishing or ''Harry Potter'' and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.<ref name=telegraph /> 
</blockquote>
Bloomsbury stated that the price hike of £1 from the previous ''Harry Potter'' novel was due to it having been printed on recycled paper. "There is a price to be paid by the consumer for environmental best practice", a Bloomsbury spokeswoman said.<ref name=makepeace>{{cite web|title=Bloomsbury: Asda must make peace|author=Katherine Rushton|publisher=thebookseller.com|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42122-bloomsbury-asda-must-make-peace.html|date=2007-07-17|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>

Bloomsbury CEO Nigel Newton said, "[They have] unleashed a very disingenuous, self-interested attack on us. This is complete nonsense and all they're doing is grandstanding as they've done on the price of aspirin and bread. They try to turn it into a big deal as though it's a moral crusade for them, but it's nothing of the kind."<ref name=makepeace />

That same day, Bloomsbury cancelled all Asda's orders of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', or roughly 500,000 copies, citing unpaid bills from the company totalling £38,000 ($70,000) for unauthorised returns of the sixth ''Harry Potter'' book.<ref name=makepeace /> "The two matters are completely unrelated", said a Bloomsbury spokeswoman, "We decided today that we couldn't risk having arrears with anybody."<ref name=telegraph /> The dispute had been "going on a while - going on for weeks actually."<ref name=lifestyle>{{cite web|title=Asda Apologises following Potter Book Row|publisher=UK News Lifestyle Extra|url=http://www.lifestyleextra.com/ShowStory.asp?story=BZ1739815T&news_headline=asda_apologises_following_potter_book_row__|date=2007-07-17|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Asda responded that Bloomsbury owed them £122,000 ($224,000) ("for pulping and for other book trade issues and work we have done for them"<ref name=makepeace />) and that, as one company spokesman claimed, "It just seems funny that after we expose the potty Potter price hike, Bloomsbury are trying everything they can to stop kids getting hold of ''Harry Potter'' at a price they can afford."<ref name=lifestyle /> 

Asda paid the bill within hours, and claimed that Bloomsbury would be in breach of contract if it did not allow the store to sell its books. However, Bloomsbury claimed that the block on Asda's orders was still in place as, "Unfortunately, we've now had to initiate a significant libel claim against them. That matter will have to be dealt with. If they want their 500,000 books, they'll have to come and make peace with us&nbsp;... It could be good news for all their disappointed customers, because they don't have to go to a soulless Asda shed to buy their book and they can share the magic of ''Harry Potter'' at an independent or specialist bookstore instead."<ref name=makepeace /> 

Upon receipt of Bloomsbury's legal letter, Asda responded that, "There is nothing defamatory in our press release. Everything there is factual. It is a commentary on how we see things."<ref name=makepeace /> Said another Asda spokesperson, "If they don't supply us with the books, it will have a massive implication and [be] a breach of contract - but I don't think they will do that."<ref name=makepeace />

Later that day, however, Asda released a statement retracting its original comment: "We apologise unreservedly to Bloomsbury for [our] press release dated 15 July and withdraw our statement. We look forward to a good relationship with Bloomsbury going forward, including selling the latest ''Harry Potter'' book from 00:01&nbsp;am BST on Saturday 21 July and many other Bloomsbury books in the future".<ref>{{cite web|title=Asda apologises to Bloomsbury|author= Philip Jones |publisher=thebookseller.com|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42186-asda-apologises-to-bloomsbury.html|date=2007-07-17|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> In response, Bloomsbury lifted the block and Asda was allowed to sell its books. The original press release was then expunged.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter and the Asda Apology|author=Graeme Warden|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|date=2007-07-17|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/jul/17/harrypotter.supermarkets|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> 

The rationale behind Asda's initial press release remains uncertain.  Neill Denny, commentator for thebookseller.com, opined that "the whole episode has the whiff of a badly-conceived PR stunt by ill-briefed senior executives at Asda out of touch with the subtleties of the book world."<ref name=Denny>{{cite web|title=Opinion: Asda's climbdown|author=Neill Denny|publisher=thebookseller.com|date=2007-07-17|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42197-opinion-asdas-climbdown.html|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Ralph Baxter of Publishing News concurred: "For Asda&nbsp;... it may be seen as mission accomplished, a high-risk strategy to maximise publicity for its ''Harry Potter'' offer rewarded with television, radio, Internet and newspaper coverage. And the association of Asda with low prices has no doubt been entrenched in a few more minds."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Great Stand-Off|author=Ralph Baxter|publisher=''Publishing News'' Online|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071113192945/http://www.publishingnews.co.uk/pn/pno-news-display.asp?K=e2007071912471094&TAG=&CID=&PGE=&sg9t=...|year=2007|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>
