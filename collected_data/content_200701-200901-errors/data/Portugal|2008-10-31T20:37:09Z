'''Portugal''' {{Audio-IPA|en-us-Portugal.ogg|[ˈpɔɹtʃəgəl]}}, officially the '''Portuguese Republic''' ({{lang-pt|República Portuguesa}}),<ref>{{pt icon}} [http://www.portugal.gov.pt/Portal/PT/Portugal/ Portal do Governo]</ref> is a country on the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Located in southwestern [[Europe]], Portugal is the westernmost country of mainland Europe and is bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and south and by [[Spain]] to the north and east. The Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores Islands|Azores]] and [[Madeira]] are also part of Portugal.

The land within the borders of today's Portuguese Republic has been continuously settled since [[Prehistoric Iberia|prehistoric times]]. Some of the earliest [[civilization]]s include [[Lusitanians]] and [[Celt]]ic societies. Incorporation into the [[Roman Republic]] dominions took place in the 2nd century BC. The region was ruled and colonized by [[Germanic peoples]], such as the [[Suebi]] and the [[Visigoths]], from the 5th to the 8th century. From this era, some vestiges of the [[Alans]] were also found. The [[Muslim]] [[Moors]] arrived in the early 8th century and conquered the [[Christian]] [[Timeline of Portuguese history (Germanic Kingdoms)|Germanic kingdoms]], eventually occupying most of the Iberian Peninsula. In the early 1100s, during the Christian ''[[Reconquista]]'', Portugal appeared as a kingdom independent of its neighbour, the [[Kingdom of León]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]]. In a little over a century, in 1249, Portugal would establish almost its entire modern-day borders by conquering territory from the Moors.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, with a [[Portuguese Empire|global empire]] that included possessions in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[South America]], Portugal was one of the world's major economic, political, and cultural powers. In the 17th century, the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] between Portugal and Spain ended the sixty year period of the [[Iberian Union]] (1580–1640). In the 19th century, armed conflict with [[Peninsular War|French and Spanish invading forces]] and [[Independence of Brazil|the loss of its largest territorial possession abroad]], [[Brazil]], disrupted political stability and potential economic growth. After the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] and the [[Carnation Revolution]] [[coup d'état]] in 1974, the ruling [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|regime]] was deposed in Lisbon and the country handed over its last overseas provinces in Africa. Portugal's last overseas territory, [[Macau]], was handed over to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1999.

Portugal is a [[developed country]],<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-b.html Appendix B - International Organizations and Groups: developed countries (DCs)], CIA - The World Factbook - Appendix B, [[The World Factbook]]</ref> has a high [[Human Development Index]] and has the [[Quality-of-life index|19th]] highest [[quality of life]] in the world,<ref>[http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf Quality-of-life Survey], [[The Economist]]</ref> although having the lowest [[GDP per capita]] of [[Western Europe]]an countries. It is a member of the [[European Union]] (since 1986) and the [[United Nations]] (since 1955); as well as a founding member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa ([[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], CPLP), and the European Union's [[Eurozone]]. Portugal is also a [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] state. According to the [[Global Peace Index]], Portugal is the 7th most peaceful country in the world.

==History==

{{Main|History of Portugal}}
[[Image:Ethnographic Iberia 200 BCE.PNG|thumb|left|150px|<small>Main language areas in Iberia circa 200BC.</small>]]
The early history of Portugal, whose name derives from the Roman name [[Portus Cale]], is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The region was [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|settled]] by Pre-[[Celts]] and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]], visited by [[Phoenicians]] and [[Carthaginians]], incorporated in the [[Roman Republic]] dominions (as [[Lusitania]] after 45 BC), settled again by [[Suevi]], [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]], and [[Visigoths]], and conquered by [[Moors]]. Other minor influences include some 5th century vestiges of [[Alans|Alan]] settlement, which were found in [[Alenquer]], [[Coimbra]] and even [[Lisbon]].<ref>Milhazes, José. [http://www.rtp.pt/index.php?article=264957&visual=16&rss=0 Os antepassados caucasianos dos portugueses] - [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal]] in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].</ref> In 868, during the [[Reconquista]] (by which Christians reconquered the Iberian peninsula from the Muslim and Moorish domination), the [[First County of Portugal]] was formed. A victory over the Muslims at [[Ourique]] in 1139 is traditionally taken as the occasion when Portugal was transformed from a county ([[County of Portugal]] as a fief of the [[Kingdom of León]]) into an [[Portuguese monarchy|independent kingdom]]: the [[Kingdom of Portugal]].
[[Image:CasteloGuimaraes2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|right|The [[Castle of Guimarães]], known as the cradle of Portugal.]]
On 24 June 1128, the [[Battle of São Mamede]] occurred near [[Guimarães]]. At the Battle of São Mamede, [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]], Count of Portugal, defeated his mother, [[Teresa, Countess of Portugal|Countess Teresa]], and her lover, [[Fernão Peres de Trava]], in battle—thereby establishing himself as sole leader. Afonso Henriques officially declared Portugal's independence when he proclaimed himself [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal]] on 25 July 1139, after the [[Battle of Ourique]], he was recognized as such in 1143 by [[Alfonso VII of León|Afonso VII]], king of León and Castile, and in 1179 by [[Pope Alexander III]].
Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors, as the size of Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, this [[Reconquista]] ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present day borders, with minor exceptions.
[[Image:Spanish reconquista.gif|thumb|left|170px|right|Progress of the Christian ''[[Reconquista]]''.]]
In 1373, Portugal made an [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|alliance with England]], which is the longest-standing alliance in the world.

In 1383, the king of Castile, husband of the daughter of the Portuguese king who had died without a male heir, claimed his throne. An ensuing popular revolt led to the [[1383-1385 Crisis]]. A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later [[John I of Portugal|John I]]), seconded by General [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]] defeated the Castilians in the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]]. This celebrated battle is still a symbol of glory and the struggle for independence from neighboring Spain.

In the following decades, Portugal spearheaded the exploration of the world and undertook the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Age of Discovery]]. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], son of King João I, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavor.

In 1415, Portugal gained the first of its overseas colonies when a fleet conquered [[Ceuta]], a prosperous Islamic trade center in North [[Africa]]. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], which led to the first [[colonialism|colonization]] movements.

Throughout the 15th century, [[European exploration of Africa#Portuguese explorers|Portuguese explorers]] sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for [[Economic history of Portugal#15th century|several common types of tradable commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves]], as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe. In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] finally reached India and brought economic prosperity to Portugal and its then population of one million residents.
[[Image:Henry the Navigator.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Padrão dos Descobrimentos]]'', a monument to [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] and the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Portuguese Age of Discovery]], [[Lisbon]].]]
In 1500, [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], en route to India, discovered [[Brazil]] and claimed it for Portugal.<ref>The standard view of historians is that Cabral was blown off course as he was navigating the currents of the South Atlantic, sighted the coast of South America, thereby accidentally discovering Brazil.  For an account of an alternative view of the discovery of Brazil, however, see [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]</ref> Ten years later, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Goa]], in [[India]], [[Ormuz]] in the Persian Strait, and [[Malacca]] in what is now a [[state]] in [[Malaysia]]. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the [[Indian Ocean]] and South Atlantic.  The Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe landing in such places like [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], the island of [[Timor]], and it may also have been Portuguese sailors that were the first Europeans to discover [[Australia]].<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSSYD3449720070321 Map proves Portuguese discovered Australia: new book], in [[Reuters]] (Wed Mar 21, 2007) - (see [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]])</ref>

Portugal's independence was interrupted between 1580 and 1640. Because the heirless King [[Sebastião of Portugal|Sebastian]] died in battle in Morocco, [[Philip II of Spain]] claimed his throne and so became Philip I of Portugal. Although Portugal did not lose its formal independence, it was governed by the same monarch who governed [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], briefly forming a [[Iberian Union|union]] of kingdoms, as a [[personal union]]; in 1640, [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king. The [[Portuguese Restoration War]] between Portugal and Spain on the aftermath of the 1640 revolt, ended the sixty-year period of the [[Iberian Union]] under the [[House of Habsburg]]. This was the beginning of the [[House of Braganza]], which was to reign in Portugal until 1910. On 1 November 1755, [[Lisbon]], the largest city and capital of the Portuguese Empire, was strongly shaken by [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|an earthquake]] which killed thousands and destroyed a large portion of the city.

In the autumn of 1807 [[Napoleon]] moved French troops through its allied Spain to invade Portugal. From 1807 to 1811, British-Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the [[Peninsular War|French invasion of Portugal]].

Red - true possessions; Pink - explorations, areas of influence and trade and claims of sovereignty; Blue - main sea explorations, routes and areas of influence. The [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia|disputed discovery of Australia]] is not shown.]]
Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline until the 20th century. This decline was hastened by [[Independence of Brazil|the independence in 1822]] of the country's largest colonial possession, [[Brazil]]. At the height of European [[colonialism]] in the 19th century, Portugal had lost its territory in [[South America]] and all but a few bases in Asia. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there. Portuguese territories eventually included the modern nations of [[Cape Verde]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Angola]], and [[Mozambique]].

[[Image:Portuguese colonial war map1.PNG|thumb|left|upright|Map of the Portuguese Overseas provinces in Africa by the time of the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974).]]In 1910, [[5 October 1910 revolution|a revolution]] deposed the Portuguese monarchy, but chaos continued and considerable economic problems were aggravated by the [[Portugal in World War I|military intervention in World War I]], which led to a [[28 May 1926 coup d'état|military coup d'état in 1926]]. This in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[António de Oliveira Salazar]].
In December 1961, the Portuguese army was involved in armed action in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against an [[Operation Vijay (1961)|Indian invasion]]. The operations resulted in the defeat of the isolated and relatively small Portuguese defense force which was not able to resist a much larger enemy. The outcome was the loss of the Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]].

Also in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Portuguese Guinea]], in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974).
In April 1974, a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in [[Lisbon]], known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for a modern democracy as well as the independence of the last colonies in Africa shortly after. However, Portugal's last overseas territory, [[Macau]] (Asia), was not handed over to the [[People's Republic of China]] until as late as 1999.

From the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and [[EFTA]]. In 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Union]] (then the [[European Economic Community]]). In 1999, Portugal was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[Eurozone]]. It is also a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP), established in 1996 and headquartered in Lisbon.

==Administrative divisions==

[[Image:Acores-Portugal-1-.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Sete Cidades]], [[São Miguel Island]], [[Azores]].]]
[[Image:Portuguese Districts Map With Names.svg|thumb|right|Map of [[Mainland Portugal]] and the two [[autonomous regions of Portugal]] (not in their actual locations).]]
{{main|Administrative divisions of Portugal}}
Portugal has an administrative structure of 308 [[municipalities of Portugal|municipalities]] (Portuguese singular/plural: ''concelho/concelhos''), which are subdivided into more than 4,000 [[freguesia|parishes]] (''freguesia/freguesias''). Municipalities are grouped for administrative purposes into superior units. For continental Portugal the municipalities are gathered in 18 Districts, while the Islands have a Regional Government directly above them. Thus, the largest unit of classification is the one established since 1976 into either [[mainland Portugal]] (''Portugal Continental'') or the [[autonomous regions of Portugal]] ([[Azores]] and [[Madeira]]).

The 18 district capitals of mainland Portugal are: [[Aveiro]], [[Beja]], [[Braga]], [[Bragança]], [[Castelo Branco]], [[Coimbra]], [[Évora]], [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]], [[Guarda]], [[Leiria]], [[Lisbon]], [[Portalegre]], [[Porto]], [[Santarém]], [[Setúbal]], [[Viana do Castelo]], [[Vila Real]], and [[Viseu]] - each district takes the name of the district capital.

The [[European Union]]'s system of [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] is also used. According to this system, Portugal is divided into 7 regions (''[[Açores]]'', ''[[Alentejo]]'', ''[[Algarve]]'', ''[[Centro, Portugal|Centro]]'', ''[[Lisboa, Region|Lisboa]]'', ''[[Madeira]]'', and ''[[Norte, Portugal|Norte]]''), which are subdivided into 30 subregions.

==Geography and climate==
<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: "Geography of Portugal" and "Conservation areas of Portugal", your work there will be very appreciated. -->
{{main|Geography of Portugal|Conservation areas of Portugal}}
[[Image:Montezinho 7.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Montesinho Natural Park]] in northeast Portugal.]]
The climate can be classified as [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] type ''csa'' in the south and ''csb'' in the north, according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Portugal is one of the warmest European countries, the annual temperature averages in [[mainland Portugal]] are 13 °C (55 °F) in the north and 18 °C (64 °F) in the south and it is over 20 °C (68°F) on the warmest spots, like south coast of Madeira island. The [[Madeira]] and [[Azores]] Atlantic archipelagos have a narrower temperature range. Extreme temperatures occur in the mountains of Northeastern parts of the country in winter (where they may fall to -15 °C) and Southeastern parts in summer. 
Sea coastal areas are milder. Absolute extremes registered so far have been -23 °C{{Fact|date=August 2008}} in the big mountain of [[Serra da Estrela]] and 48 °C in the [[Alentejo]] region. There are registered values  of 50,5 for Riodades.<ref>[http://www.dandantheweatherman.com/wortrivaug.html]</ref> It is very plausible that these values can be registered on the Guadiana, Douro and Tagus (Tejo) warmest valleys.
[[Continental Portugal|Mainland Portugal]] is split by its main river, the [[Tagus]]. The northern landscape is mountainous in the interior areas, with plateaus indented by river valleys. The south, between the [[Tagus]] and the [[Algarve]] (the [[Alentejo]]), features mostly rolling plains and a climate somewhat warmer and drier than in the cooler and rainier north. The [[Algarve]], separated from the [[Alentejo]] by mountains,  has a climate much like southern coastal Spain.[[Image:Portugal Exclusive Economic Zone (en).svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Portugal's Exclusive Economic Zone]] is a sea zone over which the country has special rights of exploration and use of marine resources.]]
 
[[Image:Alentejo oak on wheat field.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cork oak]] on [[wheat]] field, a typical image of the [[Alentejo]] region.]]
[[Image:Algarve-1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Praia da Marinha]], [[Lagoa (Algarve)|Lagoa]], [[Algarve]].|right]]
The islands of the Azores are located in the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] whilst the Madeira islands were formed by the activity of an [[plate tectonics|in-plate]] [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], much like the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian Islands]]. Some islands have had volcanic activity as recently as 1957. Azores have a subtropical humid climate, as well as Madeira which is warmer and more diversified. In the mountains it is possible to have a mountain temperate climate, on the lowlands subtropical humid climate with the exception of Porto Santo (Warm Inframediterranean climate) and Salvages islands (Ilhas Selvagens) with a desertic climate. Portugal's highest point is [[Mount Pico]] on [[Pico Island]] in the [[Azores]]. This is an ancient volcano measuring 2,350 meters (7,713 ft). [[Continental Portugal|Mainland Portugal]]'s highest point is [[Serra da Estrela]], measuring 1993 meters (6,558 ft).
[[Portugal EEZ|Portugal's Exclusive Economic Zone]], a seazone over which the Portuguese have special rights over the exploration and use of marine resources, has 1,727,408 km². This is the 3rd largest [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of the [[European Union]] and the 11th in the world.

[[Conservation areas of Portugal]] include one national park (Parque Nacional), 12 natural parks (Parque Natural), 9 natural reserves (Reserva Natural), 5 natural monuments (Monumento Natural), and 7 protected landscapes (Paisagem Protegida), ranging from the [[Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês]] to the [[Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela]] to the [[Paul de Arzila]]. Climate and geographical diversity shaped the Portuguese Flora. [[Image:Por AreasProtegidas-1-.jpg|thumb|Protected areas within [[Mainland Portugal]].|120px|right]] Due to economic reasons the pine tree (especially the ''[[Pinus pinaster]]'' and ''[[Pinus pinea]]'' species), the chestnut tree (''[[Castanea sativa]]''), the cork oak (''[[Quercus suber]]''), the holm oak (''[[Quercus ilex]]''), and the eucalyptus (''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]'') are very widespread.
Mammalian fauna is diverse and includes the [[fox]], [[badger]], [[Iberian lynx]], [[Iberian Wolf]], [[wild goat]] (''[[Capra pyrenaica]]''), wild cat (''[[Felis silvestris]]''), [[hare]], [[weasel]], [[polecat]], [[mongoose]], civet, brown bear (spotted near Rio Minho, close to Peneda-Gerês) and many others. Portugal is an important stopover place for migratory birds, like in Saint Vicent Cape or [[Monchique]] mountain, where it can be seen thousands of birds that fly from [[Europe]] to [[Africa]] in the Autumn or on the opposite direction, in the Spring. They congregate here, because [[Iberian Peninsula]] is the closest place in Europe to Africa. Portugal has around 600 bird species and almost every year there are new records. The islands have some species of American, European, and African origin, while the mainland shares European and African bird species.
Portugal has over 100 freshwater fish species and vary from the giant European catfish (Tejo International Natural Park) to some small and endemic species that live only in small and located lakes (West Zone, for example). Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered due to habitat loss, pollution and drought.
[[Marine fish]] species number are on the thousands mark and include the [[sardine]] (''Sardina pilchardus''), [[tuna]] and [[Atlantic mackerel]]. The marine bioluminescence is very well-represented (in different colors spectra and forms), with interesting phenomena like the glowing plankton, that is possible to observe in some beaches. In Portugal is possible also to observe the upwelling phenomena, specially on the west coast, which turns the sea extremely rich in nutrients and biodiversity. Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in biodiversity of the world.

Insect fauna has many endemic species, that are only found in some places in Portugal, others are more widespread like the [[stag beetle]] (Lucanus cervus) and the cicada. Macaronesian islands ([[Azores]] and [[Madeira]]) have many endemic species (like birds, reptiles, bats, insects, snails and slugs) that developed differently from any place in the world due to its isolated location and so evolved very unique species. Only in Madeira is possible to observe 200 species of land [[gastropods]].
[[Laurissilva]] is a unique type of subtropical rainforest in Europe and in the world. It is found in Madeira and Azores, Portugal, and also on the Canary islands, Spain.

==Government and politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
[[Image:Assembleia Republica Portugal 3.JPG|thumb|200px|left|[[Assembly of the Republic]], [[Lisbon]].]]
{{main|Politics of Portugal}}
Portugal is a democratic republic ruled by the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1976|constitution of 1976]] with [[Lisbon]], the nation's largest city, as its capital.
The four main governing components are the [[List of Presidents of Portugal|president of the republic]], the [[assembly of the republic]], the [[Government of Portugal|government]], and the courts. The constitution grants the division or separation of powers among legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Portugal like most European countries has no [[state religion]], making it a [[secular state]].
[[Image:Josesocrates2006.jpg|right|thumb|[[José Sócrates]], current [[Prime Minister of Portugal]].]]
The president, who is elected to a five-year term, has a supervising, non-executive role. The current President is [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]]. The Assembly of the Republic is a [[unicameral]] parliament composed of 230 deputies elected for four-year terms. The government is headed by the [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|prime minister]] (currently [[José Sócrates]]), who chooses the Council of Ministers, comprising all the ministers and the respective state secretaries.

The national and regional governments (those of [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]] autonomous regions), and the [[Assembly of the Republic|Portuguese parliament]], are dominated by two political parties, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]]. Minority parties [[Unitarian Democratic Coalition]] ([[Portuguese Communist Party]] plus [[Ecologist Party "The Greens"]]), [[Left Bloc|Bloco de Esquerda]] (Left Bloc) and [[Democratic and Social Center / People's Party|CDS-PP]] (People's Party) are also represented in the [[Assembly of the Republic|parliament]] and local governments.

The [[courts]] are organized into categories, including judicial, administrative, and fiscal. The [[Portuguese Supreme Court|supreme court]]s are the courts of last appeal. A thirteen-member [[Portuguese Constitutional Court|constitutional court]] oversees the constitutionality of legislation.

==Foreign relations==
<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: "Foreign Relations of Portugal" and "Military of Portugal", your work there will be very appreciated. -->
{{main|Foreign relations of Portugal}}

Portugal is a founding member of [[NATO]] (1949), [[OECD]] (1961) and [[EFTA]] (1960); it left the latter in 1986 to join the [[European Economic Community]], that would become the [[European Union]] in 1993. In 1996 it co-founded the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP). The country is a member state of the [[United Nations]] since 1955.

It has a friendship alliance and [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] treaty with Brazil. Portugal is part of  the world's oldest active alliance through its [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|treaty with the United Kingdom]].

The only international dispute concerns the municipality of [[Olivenza|Olivença]]. Under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297, the municipality of Olivença was ceded to Spain under the Treaty of Badajoz in 1801, after the [[War of the Oranges]]. Portugal claimed it back in 1815 under the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]]. Nevertheless, bilateral diplomatic relations between the two neighbouring countries are cordial, as well as within the [[European Union]].

==Military==
{{main|Military history of Portugal|Portuguese Armed Forces}}
[[Image:F16A FAP refuel KC-10.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Portuguese Air Force]] [[F-16]].]]
The armed forces have three branches: [[Portuguese Army|Army]], [[Portuguese Navy|Navy]], and [[Portuguese Air Force|Air Force]]. The military of Portugal serves primarily as a self-defense force whose mission is to protect the territorial integrity of the country and providing humanitarian assistance and security at home and abroad. As of 2002, the total armed forces of Portugal numbered 43,600 active personnel including 2,875 women. Reservists numbered 210,930 for all services. The army had 25,400 personnel with equipment including 187 main battle tanks. The navy of 10,800, including 1,580 marines, had two submarines, six frigates, and 28 patrol and coastal combatants. The air force of 7,400 was equipped with 50 combat aircraft. Paramilitary police and republican guards, the [[Guarda Nacional Republicana]] (GNR), number 40,900. GNR is a police force under the authority of the military, its soldiers are subject to military law and organization. It has provided detachments for participation in international operations in [[Iraq]] and [[East Timor]]. The United States maintains a military presence with 770 troops. Portugal participates in peacekeeping operations in several regions. Defense spending in 1999–00 was $1.3 billion, representing 2.2% of GDP.

Since the early 2000s, [[compulsory military service]] is no longer practiced. The changes also turned the forces' focus towards professional military engagements. The age for voluntary recruitment is set at 18.  In the 20th century, Portugal engaged in two major military interventions: the [[Portugal in the Great War|First Great War]] and the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974). Portugal has participated in peacekeeping missions in [[East Timor]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] ([[Nasiriyah]]), and [[Lebanon]]. The [[Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade|Portuguese Military's Rapid Reaction Brigade]], a combined force of the nation's elite [[Parachute Troops School|Paratroopers]], [[Special Operations Troops Centre]], and [[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]], is a special elite fighting force.

{{main|Economy of Portugal|Economic history of Portugal}}

[[Image:GDPgrowthPORTUGAL%.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Portuguese GDP growth since 1980.]]
Portugal's economy is based on services and industry such as software and automotive. Business services have overtaken more traditional industries<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.ft.com/reports/investportugal2008 Investing in Portugal Report], [[Financial Times]]</ref> such as textiles, clothing, footwear, cork and wood products and beverages (wine, beer, juice, soft drinks). The country has increased its role in the automotive, mold-making and software sectors. Services, particularly tourism, are playing an increasingly important role. Portugal's [[European Union]] (EU) funding will be cut by 10%, to 22.5 billion euros, during the 2007–2013 period. EU expansion into eastern Europe has erased Portugal's past competitive advantage and relative low labor costs. Portugal's [[economic development]] model has been changing from one based on [[Consumption (economics)|public consumption]] and [[public investment]] to one focused on [[exports]], [[investment|private investment]], and development of the [[high-tech]] sector. At present, Portugal is exporting more technology than it imports.<ref name="autogenerated1" />
[[Image:Vasco da Gama tower.jpg|thumb|170px|left|The [[Vasco da Gama Tower]], in [[Lisbon]], was built for the [[1998 Lisbon World Exposition]] as the European Union Pavillion. The positive impact of the exposition on the economy was felt at that time.]]
Portugal joined the [[European Union]] in 1986 and started a process of modernization within the framework of a stable environment. It has achieved a healthy level of growth. Successive governments have implemented reforms and privatized many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the economy. Portugal was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] in 1999, and therefore is integrated into the [[Eurozone]].
Major industries include [[oil refineries]], [[automotive]], [[cement]] production, [[pulp and paper industry]], [[textile]], [[footwear]], [[furniture]], and [[cork (material)|cork]] (of which Portugal is the world's leading producer).<ref>''Grande Enciclopédia Universal'', p. 10543, "Portugal", para. 4</ref> Manufacturing accounts for 33% of exports. Portugal is the world's fifth-largest producer of [[tungsten]], and the world's eleventh-largest producer of [[wine]]. [[Agriculture in Portugal|Agriculture]] and [[Fishing in Portugal|fishing]] no longer represents the bulk of the economy. However, Portugal has a strong tradition in the [[fisheries]] sector and is one of the countries with the highest fish consumption per capita.<ref>{{pt icon}} PESSOA, M.F.; MENDES, B.; OLIVEIRA, J.S.

The Global Competitiveness Report for 2005, published by the [[World Economic Forum]], placed Portugal's [[competitiveness]] in the 22nd position, ahead of countries and territories such as [[Spain]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[Hong Kong]] <!-- Portugal fall behind these countries in more recent Competitve Report so might need to update -->. This represented an increase of two places from the 2004 ranking. Portugal was ranked 20th on the Technology index and 15th on the Public Institutions index.<ref>[http://www.investinportugal.pt/MCMSAPI/HomePage/NewsRoom/PORTUGAL+IMPROVES+ITS+POSITION+IN+THE+WEF+COMPETITIVENESS+RANKING.htm http://www.investinportugal.pt/MCMSAPI/HomePage/NewsRoom/PORTUGAL+IMPROVES+ITS+POSITION+IN+THE+WEF+COMPETITIVENESS+RANKING.htm] ''Investinportugal.pt'' Retrieved on 05-16-07 </ref> However, the Global Competitiveness Index 2007-2008 placed Portugal in the 40th position out of 131 countries and territories.<ref>[http://www.weforum.org/pdf/Global_Competitiveness_Reports/Reports/gcr_2007/gcr2007_rankings.pdf Global Competitiveness Index 2007-2008]</ref>

Research about [[standard of living]] by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s [[quality of life]] survey<ref>http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf</ref> placed Portugal as the country with the 19th-best quality of life in the world for the year 2005, ahead of other economically and technologically advanced countries like [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[South Korea]]. This is despite the fact that Portugal has the lowest per capita GDP in Western Europe and among the lowest in the [[European Union]].

Major [[Government-owned corporation|State-owned companies]] include [[Águas de Portugal]] (water), [[Caixa Geral de Depósitos]] (banking), [[Comboios de Portugal]] (railways), [[CTT]] (postal services) and [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal]] (media). [[Public company|Publicly-owned companies]] like [[Energias de Portugal|EDP]], [[Galp Energia|Galp]], [[Jerónimo Martins]], [[Millennium bcp]], [[Portugal Telecom]] and [[Sonae]] are among the largest corporations of Portugal by both number of employees and [[net income]].

The major [[stock exchange]] is the [[Euronext Lisbon]] which is part of the [[NYSE Euronext]], the first global stock exchange. The [[PSI-20]] is Portugal's most selective and widely known [[stock index]].

{{main|Transportation in Portugal|Communications in Portugal|Renewable energy in Portugal|Water supply and sanitation in Portugal}}

In 2006 the world's largest [[solar energy|solar power]] plant began operating in the nation's sunny south while the world's first commercial [[wave power]] farm opened in October 2006 in the [[Norte region]]. As of 2006, 55% of electricity production was from coal and fuel power plants. The other 40% was produced by [[hydroelectric]]s and 5% by [[wind energy]]. The government is channeling $38,000,000,000 into developing [[renewable energy]] sources over the next five years.

Portugal wants [[renewable energy]] sources like solar, wind and wave power to account for nearly half of the electricity consumed in the country by 2010. "This new goal will place Portugal in the frontline of renewable energy and make it, along with [[Austria]] and [[Sweden]], one of the three nations that most invest in this sector", Prime Minister [[José Sócrates]] said.
[[Image:Alqueva dam portugal.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Alqueva Dam]], [[Alentejo]] - [[irrigation]] and [[hydroelectric power]] generation facility which created the largest artificial lake in Western Europe.]]
Transportation was seen as a priority in the 1990s, pushed by the growing use of automobiles and industrialization. The country has a 68,732 km (42,708 mi) network of roads, of which almost 3,000 km (1,864 mi) are part of a 44 [[motorway]]s system.

The two principal metropolitan areas have subway systems: [[Lisbon Metro]] and Metro Sul do Tejo in Lisbon [[Metropolitan Area]] and [[Porto Metro]] in Porto, each with more than 35 km (22&nbsp;mi) of lines. Construction of a high-speed [[TGV]] line connecting [[Porto]] with [[Lisbon]], Lisbon with [[Madrid]] and Porto with [[Vigo]] will begin in 2008.
[[Image:Metro do Porto Flexity Outlook Eurotram Trindade.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Porto Metro]] [[light rail]].]]
Lisbon's geographical position makes it a stopover point for many foreign airlines at airports all over the country. The government decided to build a new airport outside Lisbon, in [[Alcochete]], to replace Lisbon's [[Portela airport]]. Currently, the most important airports are in [[Portela Airport|Lisbon]], [[Faro Airport (Portugal)|Faro]], [[Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport|Porto]], [[Madeira Airport|Funchal]] ([[Madeira]]), and [[João Paulo II Airport|Ponta Delgada]] ([[Azores]]).
Portugal has one of the highest [[mobile phone]] penetration rates in the [[world]] (the number of operative mobile phones already exceeds the population). This network also provides wireless mobile Internet connections as well, and covers the entire territory. As of October 2006, 36.8% of households had high-speed Internet services and 78% of companies had Internet access. Most Portuguese watch television through cable (June 2004: 73.6% of households). Paid Internet connections are available at many cafés, as well as many post offices. One can also surf on the Internet at hotels, conference centres and shopping centres, where special areas are reserved for this purpose. Free internet access is also available to Portuguese residents at "Espaços de Internet" across the country.

Portugal has also modernized its [[Water supply and sanitation in Portugal|water supply and sanitation system]], in particular by increasing the rate of wastewater treated with support from EU subsidies to 80%. The country has also established a modern institutional and legal framework for the water and sanitation sector, including an autonomous regulatory agency, a national asset holding company called [[Águas de Portugal]] and a number of multi-municipal utilities. This replaced an institutionally fragemented sector structure, under which the country's 308 municipalities - many of them very small - had exclusive responsibility for water and sanitation.

The population of Portugal, the first unified national-state in Western Europe, has been extremely homogeneous for most of its history. A single religion and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity. The great majority of Portuguese are [[Catholic Church in Portugal|Roman Catholic]], though a large percentage consider themselves non-practising, especially in urban lands. Portugal was one of the last western European nations to give up its colonies and overseas territories, turning over the administration of Macau to China in 1999. Its [[Portuguese Empire|colonial history]] has been fundamental to national identity, as has its geographic position at the margin of Europe looking out to the Atlantic. The country is fairly homogeneous linguistically and religiously. Native [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] are ethnically a combination of [[Celts]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ([[Visigoths]], [[Suebi]], [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]]), [[Alans]], [[Jew]]s and [[Moors]] (mostly [[Berber people|Berber]]s and [[Arab]]s).

In the 2001 census, the population was 10,355,824 of which 52% was female, 48% was male. By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal [[Immigration to Portugal|immigrants]].<ref>[http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&xpgid=ine_main INE], [[Statistics Portugal]]</ref> Portugal, long a country of emigration, has now become a country of net immigration,<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/48.htm Portugal - Emigration]</ref> and not just from the last [[Portuguese India|India]]n (Portuguese until 1961), [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Africa]]n (Portuguese until 1975), and [[Macau|Far East Asian]] (Portuguese until 1999) [[Portuguese empire|overseas territories]]. Since the 1990s, along with a boom in [[construction]], several new waves of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Brazil]]ian, [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|people from the former Portuguese colonies in Africa]] and other Africans have settled in the country. Those communities currently make up the largest groups of immigrants in Portugal. [[Romania]]ns, [[Moldova]]ns and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] also have chosen Portugal as destination. A number of [[EU citizen]]s from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]] and other [[EU member states]], also have chosen Portugal as destination, with the British community being mostly composed of retired pensioners and the Spaniards composed of professionals (medical doctors, business managers, businesspersons, nurses, etc.).<ref>[http://embaixada-portugal-brasil.blogspot.com/2007/06/brasileiros-so-maior-colnia-estrangeira.html EMBAIXADA DE PORTUGAL NO BRASIL: Brasileiros são a maior colónia estrangeira em Portugal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Portugal's [[gypsy]] population, estimated at about 40,000,<ref>[http://criasnoticias.wordpress.com/2008/04/06/etnia-cigana-a-mais-discriminada-8-de-abril-dia-internacional-dos-ciganos/ Etnia cigana.

They can often be found at rural markets selling clothing and handicrafts. Portugal also has small [[Protestant]], [[Islam in Portugal|Muslim]] and [[Jewish]] communities, largely composed of foreigners.

The most populous cities are [[Lisbon]], [[Porto]], [[Vila Nova de Gaia]], [[Amadora]], [[Braga]], [[Almada]], [[Coimbra]], [[Funchal]] and [[Setúbal]]. There are seven Greater Metropolitan Areas ([[Grande Área Metropolitana|GAM]]s): [[Grande Área Metropolitana do Algarve|Algarve]], [[Grande Área Metropolitana de Aveiro|Aveiro]], [[Grande Área Metropolitana de Coimbra|Coimbra]], [[Grande Área Metropolitana de Lisboa|Lisbon]], [[Grande Área Metropolitana do Minho|Minho]], [[Grande Área Metropolitana do Porto|Porto]] and [[Grande Área Metropolitana de Viseu|Viseu]].

[[Image:Coimbra University Tower 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The tower of the [[University of Coimbra]], [[Coimbra]] - the university is one of the [[list of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest in continuous operation in the world]].]]The educational system is divided into preschool (for those under age 6), basic education (9 years, in three stages, [[compulsory]]), [[secondary education]] (3 years, till the 12th grade), and [[higher education]] ([[university]] and [[polytechnic]]).
Total adult literacy rate is 95%. Portuguese primary school enrollments are close to 100%. About 20% of college-age students attend one of the country's higher education institutions (compared with 50% in the United States). In addition to being a key destination for [[international student]]s, Portugal is also among the top places of origin for international students. All higher education students, both domestic and international, totaled 380,937 in 2005.

Portuguese universities have existed since 1290. The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]] was first established in [[Lisbon]] before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Universities are usually organized into [[faculty (university)|faculties]]. Institutes and schools are also common designations for autonomous subdivisions of [[list of colleges and universities in Portugal|Portuguese higher education institutions]], and are always used in the polytechnical system. The [[Bologna process]] has been adopted since 2006 by Portuguese universities and polytechnical institutes. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions.
Scientific and technological [[research]] activities in Portugal are mainly conducted within a network of [[R&D]] units belonging to [[list of universities in Portugal|public universities]] and state-managed autonomous research institutions like the [[Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inovação|INETI - Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inovação]]. The funding of this research system is mainly conducted under the authority of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education. The largest R&D units of the public universities by number of publications which achieved significant international recognition, include [[biosciences]] research institutions like the [[Instituto de Medicina Molecular]], the [[Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology]], the [[IPATIMUP]], and the [[Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular]]. Among the private universities, notable research centers include the [[Facial Emotion Expression Lab]]. Internationally notable state-supported research centres in other fields include the [[International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory]], a joint research effort between Portugal and Spain. Among the largest non-state-run research institutions in Portugal are the [[Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência]] and the [[Champalimaud Foundation]] which yearly awards one of the highest monetary prizes of any science prize in the world. A number of both national and multinational high-tech and industrial companies, are also responsible for research and development projects. One of the oldest learned societies of Portugal is the [[Sciences Academy of Lisbon]].

Portugal made agreements with several European scientific organizations aiming at full membership. These include the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[European Laboratory for Particle Physics]] (CERN), [[ITER]], and the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO). Portugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with MIT (USA) and other North American institutions]] in order to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.
[[Image:Lisbonne Expo98 03.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The [[Lisbon Oceanarium]], the largest aquarium in Europe.]]
Portugal is home to the largest [[aquarium]] in Europe, the [[Lisbon Oceanarium]], and have several other notable organizations focused on science-related exhibits and divulgation, like the state agency ''Ciência Viva'', a programme of the Portuguese Ministry of Science and Technology to the promotion of a scientific and technological culture among the Portuguese population,<ref>[http://www.cienciaviva.pt/cienciaviva/index.asp?accao=changelang&lang=en Ciência Viva]</ref> the [[Science Museum of the University of Coimbra]], the [[List_of_natural_history_museums#Portugal|Museum of Natural History]] at the University of Lisbon, and the [[Visionarium (Portugal)|Visionarium]].

With the emergence and growth of several [[science park]]s throughout the world which helped create many thousands of scientific, technological and knowledge-based businesses, Portugal started to develop several<ref>[http://www.tecparques.pt/associados.htm Tecparques - Associação Portuguesa de Parques de Ciência e Tecnologia]</ref> science parks across the country. These include the [[Taguspark]] (in [[Oeiras]]), the [[Coimbra inovação Parque]] (in [[Coimbra]]), the Madeira Tecnopolo<ref>[http://www.madeiratecnopolo.pt/ Madeira Tecnopolo]</ref> (in [[Funchal]]), Sines Tecnopolo<ref>[http://www.sinestecnopolo.org/ Sines Tecnopolo]</ref> (in [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]]) and Parkurbis<ref>[http://www.parkurbis.pt/ Parque de Ciência e Tecnologia da Covilhã (Parkurbis)]</ref> (in [[Covilhã]]). Companies locate in the Portuguese science parks to take advantage of a variety of services ranging from financial and legal advice through to marketing and technological support.

{{main|Law of Portugal|Portuguese legal system}}
The [[Portuguese legal system]] is part of the civil law legal system, also called the continental family legal system. Until the end of the 19th century, [[France|French]] law was the main influence. Since then the major influence has been [[German legal system|German law]]. The main laws include the [[Constitution]] (1976, as amended), the [[Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended). Portuguese law applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continues to be the major influence for those countries.

Portugal is a [[secular state]]. Other than the Constitution, the two most important documents relating to [[religious freedom]] are the 2001 Religious Freedom Act and the 1940 Concordata (as amended in 1971) between Portugal and the [[Holy See]].

Portuguese society is overwhelmingly [[Roman Catholic]]. 84% of the population are nominally Roman Catholic, but only about 20% attend mass and take the sacraments regularly. A larger number wish to be baptized, married in the church, and receive last rites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ateismo.net/diario/2007/01/portugal-est-mais-secularizado-do-que.php|title=Portugal está mais secularizado do que a Espanha|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=Diário Ateísta|date=18 January 2007}}</ref>

Many Portuguese holidays, festivals and traditions have a [[Christianity|Christian]] origin or connotation.  Although relations between the Portuguese state and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation, their relative power fluctuated. In the [[History of Portugal (1279-1415)|13th and 14th centuries]], the church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the [[reconquista|reconquest]] and its close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the Portuguese educational system, including the [[University of Coimbra|first university]]. The growth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese overseas empire]] made its [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]] important agents of [[Colonisation|colonization]] with important roles of [[evangelization]] and [[teaching]] in all inhabited continents.

The country has small [[Protestant]], [[Islam in Portugal|Muslim]], [[Christian Orthodox]] and [[Jewish]] communities, largely composed of foreigners.

==Language==
{{main|Languages of Portugal|Portuguese language}}
[[Image:Map-Lusophone World-en.png|thumb|right|200px|The [[Lusophone]] world.]]
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official language of Portugal. [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] is also recognized as a co-official language in several municipalities in northeastern Portugal. Portuguese is a [[Romance language]] that originated in what is now [[Galicia (Spain)]] and Northern Portugal. It is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] spoken by the [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula]] around 2000 years ago. In the 15th and 16th centuries, it spread wordwide as Portugal established a colonial and commercial empire (1415–1999). As a result, nowadays the Portuguese language is also official and spoken in [[Brazil]], [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], [[Cape Verde]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[East Timor]] and [[Macau]].

{{main|Culture of Portugal|Portuguese literature|Music of Portugal|Architecture of Portugal}}
[[Image:Evora-RomanTemple.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Roman Temple of Évora]].]]
Portugal has developed a specific culture while being influenced by various civilizations that have crossed the Mediterranean and the European continent, or were introduced when it played an active role during the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Age of Discovery]].
[[Portuguese literature]], one of the earliest Western literatures, developed through text and song. Until 1350, the [[Portuguese-Galician]] [[troubadour]]s spread their literary influence to most of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref> ''Poesia e Prosa Medievais'', p. 9, para. 4</ref> [[Gil Vicente]] (ca. 1465 - ca. 1536), was one of the founders of both Portuguese and Spanish dramatic traditions. 
[[Image:Luís de Camões por François Gérard.jpg|right|150px|thumb|right|[[Luís de Camões]], Portuguese poet of the 16th century.]]
Adventurer and poet [[Luís de Camões]] (ca. 1524–1580) wrote the epic poem ''[[The Lusiads]]'', with [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]] as his main influence. Modern Portuguese poetry is rooted in neoclassic and contemporary styles, as exemplified by [[Fernando Pessoa]] (1888–1935). Modern Portuguese literature is represented by authors such as [[Almeida Garrett]], [[Camilo Castelo Branco]], [[Eça de Queiroz]], [[Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen]], and [[António Lobo Antunes]]. Particularly popular and distinguished is [[José Saramago]], winner of the 1998 [[Nobel Prize for literature]].

[[Music of Portugal|Portuguese music]] encompasses a wide variety of genres. The most renowned is [[fado]], a melancholy urban music, usually associated with the [[Portuguese guitar]] and ''saudade'', or longing. [[Coimbra fado]], a unique type of fado, is also noteworthy. Internationally notable performers include [[Amália Rodrigues]], [[Carlos Paredes]], [[José Afonso]], [[Mariza]], [[Carlos do Carmo]], [[Mísia]], and [[Madredeus]]. One of the most notable Portuguese musical groups outside the country, and specially in [[Germany]], is the goth-metal band [[Moonspell]]. In addition to fado and folk, the Portuguese listen to pop and other types of modern music, particularly from [[North America]] and the [[United Kingdom]], as well as a wide range of Portuguese and Brazilian artists and bands.<ref>[http://euro200.eu.mialias.net/Portugese-Top50.htm Portugese-Top50 stats]</ref> Bands with international recognition include [[Blasted Mechanism]] and [[The Gift (band)|The Gift]], both of which were nominated for an [[MTV Music Award]]. Portugal has several summer music festivals, such as ''[[Festival Sudoeste]]'' in [[Zambujeira do Mar]], ''[[Festival de Paredes de Coura]]'' in [[Paredes de Coura]], ''[[Festival Vilar de Mouros]]'' near [[Caminha]], and ''[[Rock in Rio Lisboa]]'' and ''[[Super Bock Super Rock]]'' in [[Lisbon]]. Out of the summer season, Portugal has a large number of festivals, designed more to an urban audience, like Flowfest or Hip Hop Porto. Furthermore, one of the largest international [[Goa trance]] festivals takes place in central Portugal every two years, and the student festivals of ''[[Queima das Fitas]]'' are major events in a number of cities across Portugal.
In the Classical music domain, Portugal is represented by names as the pianist [[Maria João Pires]], and in the past by the great cellist [[Guilhermina Suggia]]. Notable composers include [[Luís de Freitas Branco]] and his student [[Joly Braga Santos]], and [[Fernando Lopes-Graça]].
It has also a rich history as far as painting is concerned. The first well-known painters date back to the XV century – like [[Nuno Gonçalves]] - were part of the Gothic painting period.
[[José Malhoa]], known for his work ''Fado'', and [[Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro]] (who painted the portraits of [[Teófilo Braga]] and [[Antero de Quental]]) were both references in naturalist painting.
[[Image:Casa da musica 1.JPG|thumb|200px|left|[[Casa da Música]] (Music House), [[Porto]].]]
The 20th century saw the arrival of [[Modernism]], and along with it came the most prominent Portuguese painters: [[Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso]], who was heavily influenced by French painters, particularly by the [[Delaunays]]. Among his best known works is ''Canção Popular a Russa e o Fígaro''. Another great modernist painter/writer was [[Almada Negreiros]], friend to the poet [[Fernando Pessoa]], who painted his (Pessoa’s) portrait. He was deeply influenced by both [[Cubist]] and [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] trends. Prominent international figures in visual arts nowadays include painters [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Júlio Pomar]], and [[Paula Rego]].

Traditional architecture is distinctive. Modern Portugal has given the world renowned architects like [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], [[Álvaro Siza Vieira]] and [[Gonçalo Byrne]]. Internally, [[Tomás Taveira]] is also noteworthy.

Since the 1990s, Portugal has increased the number of public cultural facilities, in addition to the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] established in 1956 in Lisbon. These include the [[Belém Cultural Center]] in Lisbon, [[Serralves Foundation]] and the [[Casa da Música]], both in [[Porto]], as well as new public cultural facilities like municipal libraries and concert halls which were built or renovated in many municipalities across the country.

{{main|Portuguese Cuisine|Portuguese Wine}}
Portuguese cuisine is diverse. The Portuguese consume a lot of dry [[cod]] (''[[bacalhau]]'' in Portuguese), for which there are hundreds of [[Bacalhau#Bacalhau dishes|recipes]]. There are more than enough ''[[bacalhau]]'' dishes for each day of the year. Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]]. Typical Portuguese meat recipes, that may take [[beef]], [[pork]], [[domestic sheep|lamb]], or [[chicken]], include [[feijoada]], [[cozido à portuguesa]], [[frango de churrasco]], and [[carne de porco à alentejana]].[[Image:Port wine.jpg||thumb|A glass of [[port wine]].|left]]
Typical [[fast food]] dishes include the [[francesinha]] from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork), ''prego'' (grilled beef) or ''leitão'' ([[pig]]let) [[sandwiches]] which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in ancient recipes of which [[pastéis de Belém]] (or ''pastéis de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and [[ovos-moles]] from Aveiro are good examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a cult for good food and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and small typical ''tascas''.

Portuguese wines have deserved international recognition since the times of the Roman Empire, which associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are: [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do Dão]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet: [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]] and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Setúbal]] and [[Favaios]].
