'''''QI''''', standing for '''''Quite Interesting''''' and a play on '''''[[IQ]]''''', is a comedy [[panel game]] television show hosted by [[Stephen Fry]] and shown on [[BBC Two]] and [[BBC Four]]. Older, syndicated episodes are shown on [[UKTV G2]].

It is distinguished by the awarding of points not necessarily for the ''correct'' answer, but rather, for an ''interesting'' one. Many of the questions and answers are extremely obscure. Points are deducted from a panellist who gives an ''obvious but wrong'' (that is to say, boring or conventional) answer, typically one that is generally accepted as true but is, in fact, false. It is therefore possible (and quite likely) that a panellist will have a negative point score at the end of the game. In the words of the QI website, regular panellist  ''"Alan Davies has turned this aspect of the game into somewhat of an art form."''

== Format and conception==
[[Image:QI_Logo.png|thumb|right|200px|The QI Logo.]]
The panel consists of four panelists, one of whom, [[Alan Davies]], appears in all episodes, except for one episode in series four (although he does appear at the beginning and through voiceover for the rest of it). He is the frequent target of jokes — mainly initiated by Stephen Fry — and is the panellist who normally offers up most of the "obvious but wrong" answers. Therefore, he usually finishes last. To date, Davies has won only three times: in episode 10 of the first series and in episodes 6 and 9 of the fourth series, which is nearly a three-year gap between the first and second victories. Most other panellists come from a [[stand-up comedy]] background, although there have also been musicians, actors, television personalities and poets including [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[Gyles Brandreth]] and [[Roger McGough]].

Providing an "obvious but wrong" answer results in a sequence of [[klaxon]]s. In the first and second series, Stephen Fry produced the answer on a card to show the panellists, while it also flashed on the large screens behind them (excepting the very first episode, when only the cards were used). In the third series and onward, Fry's answer cards were dispensed with altogether, leaving only the screens as proof that the answers given had been predicted.

Tangential discussions and even complete non-sequiturs abound on the show, for panellists are apt to branch off into frivolous conversations, give voice to train of thought, and share humorous anecdotes from their own lives.

Writer and former [[BBC]] producer [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] devised the format of the show, and it is produced by Quite Interesting Ltd., an organisation set up by Lloyd. 

The show was originally conceived as a radio show, with Lloyd as chairman. When it was decided that the show would air on television, [[Michael Palin]] was offered the job of chairman with Fry and Davies as captains of 'clever' and 'stupid' teams respectively.<ref>[http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/12/21/4850/last_among_eqials Last among eQIals]</ref>

=== Buzzers ===
[[Image:QIfront.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Stephen Fry presenting an episode of ''QI''.]]
Each of the panel has a [[buzzer]], the sound of which is often based along some sort of theme. The sounds are demonstrated at the beginning of the programme, but are sometimes changed in some way the very next time they are used. Davies' buzzer usually contradicts the others' in some amusing way, and so his is always the last to be demonstrated (except in the pilot episode, where he went first and Eddie Izzard, with a sillier buzzer, went last). Past examples have included:

*In Series 2 Episode 5, the first three panellists' buzzers were conventional nautical sounds, whilst Davies' featured a sexy-sounding woman's voice saying, "Ahoy! Hello, Sailor!".
*In Series 1 Episode 7, the first three buzzers were the electronic voice the device that directs people in queues, usually found in post offices ("Cashier number 1/2/3 please"); Davies' was someone announcing a train being delayed. However, Davies had the electronic voice ("Cashier number 4 please") in an earlier episode (Episode 4).
*Davies' buzzer had the sound of a sheep originally in an episode, but part-way through it changed to a dog barking (Alan: "Woof?!").
*Davies' buzzer once (Series 1 Episode 5) played the ignorance klaxon, allowing Fry to deduct 10 points from his score before the game had even started.
*Davies' buzzer having the sound of a woman receiving an orgasm (which he claimed to be a genuine recording).
*John Sessions' buzzer given the voice of a schoolboy saying enthusiastically, "Sir, sir, I know, sir!"
*In an episode where birds was the topic, all the buzzers were bird calls. However, before [[Phil Kay]] pressed his buzzer (third), he imitated the sound of a [[rooster]] call. His buzzer actually ''was'' a rooster's call, despite him having no idea what the buzzer would sound like (according to an amazed Fry).
*In an episode themed around [[cockney]] rhyming slang, [[Bill Bailey]] being given the song "[[Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey]]" sung by [[Patsy Cline]] (to which he responded sarcastically, "No-one's ever pointed that out before.")
*In an episode themed around death, the three guests' buzzers were ominous death- or murder-related sounds; Davies' buzzer played [[Monty Python]]'s "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]".
*In an episode based on drink, Davies' buzzer didn't function or light at all, but at his persistent pressing, it finally played [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]'s "[[Air on the G String]]" from the [[Hamlet (cigar)|Hamlet]] cigar adverts.
*In an episode about differences, Davies' buzzer was a conventional piano tune, of a similar nature to the others. However, when the panellists played them together, Davies' played a completely different tune.
*In an episode on deprivation, where the usual set had been removed, the buzzers were "hand-cranked"; Roger McGough had a bell on a pulley; Mark Steel had a slide rule; Vic Reeves had a small bell; and Alan had a toy chipmunk which, when first lifted, played a cheerful "We are the chipmunks, chipmunks are we". After this, it just squeaked.

Other buzzer sounds have been used more than once, such as:

*A humorous jingle built around the word "fruity", given to [[John Sessions]] and Alan Davies (in different episodes).
*Charles Penrose's "'[[The Laughing Policeman (song)|The Laughing Policeman]]", twice given to Davies.
*A werewolf's howl, twice given to [[Rich Hall]].
*A low-pitched moan, twice given to Davies.
*The theme tune to ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', given to [[Clive Anderson]] and [[Johnny Vaughan]].

=== General Ignorance ===
{{main|General Ignorance}}
[[Image:QI_Davies.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Alan Davies on ''QI''.]]
In a parody of ubiquitous [[general knowledge]] quizzes, the final round is off-topic and called "General Ignorance", focusing upon seemingly-easy questions which have "obvious but wrong" answers. Whereas in the main rounds of the show, the panellists' use of buzzers is not usually enforced, the "General Ignorance" questions are introduced by Fry's reminder to keep "fingers on buzzers".

=== Extra tasks ===
In some episodes, panellists are given an extra task to complete during the course of the game. Those who do the best are often awarded extra points. Extra tasks have included:

*The "Christmas Colouring Competition". Each panellist had to draw a Christmas Tree before the end of the episode. [[Phill Jupitus]] did a picture of an incredibly small tree and claimed that "It's a very long way away". Alan managed to get it completely wrong by drawing a picture with the branches facing down, so Stephen got someone to bring on an example Christmas Tree (with one bauble on it) to prove how wrong Alan was.
*Being given a set of magnetic letters and having to write something with them. [[Jimmy Carr]] astounded all by managing to use every one of his letters, forming, "Put [[Smarties]] tubes on cats legs/Make them walk like a [[robot]]." Which as Alan Davies pointed out, not only uses all the letters in a proper sentence, but a correct one, proceeding to mime a cat walking with Smarties tubes on its legs, acting uncannily like a robot.
*A "Draw A Wigwam Contest", was also staged but everyone accidentally drew [[Tipi|teepees]] instead of a [[wigwam]] (except [[Clive Anderson]], who twisted the competition by drawing the pop group [[Wham]] wearing wigs).
*Breaking a wine glass using only their voice, for which they all had to wear safety goggles (Alan wore a pilot's goggles and swimming goggles on top of them). Alan appeared to do it, but [[Doon Mackichan]] revealed that he had used a wire, as it is impossible to do. After the end credits, Doon tried again and failed, but succeeded in cracking Alan's goggles.
*Marking their own scores (with a penalty equal to the amount by which they were off). [[Alexander Armstrong (comedian)|Alexander Armstrong]] managed to get his score exactly right, and thus scored a bonus 100 points.
*A "Constellation Competition", where the panel had to join together the stars on their picture. [[Rich Hall]] drew "George Foreman delivering a powerful right hand to a Parakeet" (it was Taurus), [[Sean Lock]] drew a steam train (Aries), [[Jeremy Clarkson]] rotated the picture and drew an old woman (Sagittarius), and Alan drew a smiley face (Cancer).
*A "Pin the tastebud on the [[catfish]]" contest. Each panellist was given a cardboard cut-out of a catfish and told to paste stickers onto where they thought catfishes' tastebuds are located. Only [[Rory McGrath]] correctly identified the catfish having its tastebuds everywhere on its body.
*A "Spot The Cuttlefish Competition", where part of a cuttlefish would appear somewhere in one of the pictures in the show. It was originally missed until Andy Hamilton accidentally guessed it to be in Marie Curie's hair, and it was revealed to be the Italian name for sepia. Another picture in sepia, of Florence Nightingale, appeared, which Alan shouted "Cuttlefish!" at, and got a belated bonus for it.
*One answer in the show was "squirrel", and everyone was given a giant card qith a picture of a squirrel on it. They were to shout "Squirrel!" and hold up their card if they thought it was the answer. If they did this and it wasn't the answer, then there would be a forfeit of 10 points (a picture of a cross-looking Stephen Fry with clown makeup on would flash up, along with a chorus of "Oh no it isn't!"). Everyone eventually missed it, and it was revealed to be what Cindarella's slippers were made of in the original fairy tale.
*A "special wrinkle" whereby each panellist had a "doubt card" (the QI logo with a red circle and line through it) and whenever a fact or answer was given and was thought to be false, it would be produced. Alan correctly identified the Neil Armstrong related story about [[Mr Gorski]] as being false.
*Each panellist got given an illustration of a patent to guess. Alan had a "Santa Claus Detector", Clive Anderson had a bra that holds drink in it, [[Arthur Smith]] had the official patent for a comb-over, and [[Vic Reeves]] had a "toilet snorkel". 
*Predicting their own scores via the use of different objects. Anyone who did so correctly would score [[Number of the Beast|666]] bonus points. [[Phill Jupitus]] had teabags (upon one of which was written "You are going to die" in red ink), [[Graeme Garden]] had cheeses and [[Johnny Vaughan]] had a sieve. Davies had disappeared at the beginning of the show but had a false pair of [[buttocks]] with which to predict his score. Jupitus, after tossing his teabags into the air, didn't even try; Garden spelled out -1 with his cheeses; Vaughan sieved out +7; and Davies simply gave a voiceover shouting, "Won on penalties!" as he had earlier joked about divination through [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] (a British Football club) instead of [[Arse]]s (buttocks). Ironically, Vaughan correctly predicted Garden's score (who won), but Vaughan was not awarded the bonus points as it was not his own score that he predicted.
*The panellists got given a collection of everyday objects, each of which had been used for a prison escape, the nature of which had to be guessed. There was a green pen (used by a prisoner o colour his clothes and disguise himself as a prison doctor), dental floss (to floss the metal bars), chilli powder (thrown in a warden's eyes), and a potato (painted black and carved into the shape of a gun).

==Episodes==

{{seealso|List of QI episodes}}

The first series started on [[11 September]] [[2003]]. All of the questions (with the exception of the final "General Ignorance" round) were on subjects beginning with "a" except in the Christmas Special (e.g., "[[arthropods]]", "[[Alan (name)|Alan]]s", "[[astronomy]]", etc.) A second series of 12 programmes started on [[8 October]] [[2004]]. In a continuation of the established theme, subjects began with the letter "b" (except in two episodes, one about [[music]] and one about [[colour]]). Series three started on [[30 September]] [[2005]], and all subjects began with the letter "c" (e.g. "[[custard]], [[cheating]]"). The fourth series, Series D, began filming on [[19 April]] [[2006]] and started airing on [[29 September]] [[2006]]. ([[Danger]], [[Death]], [[Dog|Dogs]]). The fifth series, Series E, has been commissioned for [[2007]]. [http://www.qi.com/talk/viewtopic.php?t=3755&start=0]

===Most appearances===
This list contains the people who have made the most appearances.

* [[Alan Davies]] (permanent panellist, to Fry's immediate right)
* [[Rich Hall]]
* [[Jo Brand]]
* [[Phill Jupitus]]
* [[Bill Bailey]]
* [[Sean Lock]]
* [[John Sessions]]
* [[Clive Anderson]]
* [[Jimmy Carr]]

Many of the frequent participants are managed by the ''Off the Kerb Productions'' comedy group.

==Highlights==

The questions are, as in many comedy panel games, mainly created to set up jokes or discussions, rather than for any serious competition. Certain questions are purposely contradictory to established doctrine for the sake of entertainment. For example, to the question "How many planets are there in the solar system?", Alan Davies gave the answer "Nine" and lost points for an "obvious but wrong" answer, the explanation being that at the time a debate was occurring over whether [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]] was indeed a planet (see ''[[2006 redefinition of planet]]''). However, as the [[International Astronomical Union]] still defined Pluto as a planet at the time of questioning, the answer "nine" ''would'' have been a "correct" answer, if one accepted the contemporaneous IAU definition.

A further example of this purposeful contradiction occurred during the second series, when the question "How many moons does the Earth have?" was asked. Alan Davies had, in the previous series, been given negative points for answering "One" to the same question, due to the presence of the [[asteroid]] [[3753 Cruithne|Cruithne]] which has an [[orbital resonance]] with Earth (although it is not normally defined as a [[natural satellite]]). This time, he was again given negative points for answering with "two", which was counted as correct during the first series. The change in answer was attributed to the recent discovery of new satellites ([[(54509) 2000 PH5|(54509) 2000 PH<sub>5</sub>]], [[(85770) 1998 UP1|(85770) 1998 UP<sub>1</sub>]] and [[2002 AA29|2002 AA<sub>29</sub>]]) that share a similar resonance to Cruithne with respect to the Earth. In the Series 1 episode, Rich Hall returned the question when, following this, in response to the question "What man-made artifacts can be seen from the moon with the naked eye?" he said, "Which moon are we talking about?"

Another highlight came when Rory McGrath demonstrated his extensive knowledge of the elements of the Periodic Table and Latin names for birds, but by doing this he became ''too'' interesting and began to bore the other panellists, so much so that Sean Lock pretended to be dragged under the desk while Rory and Stephen were discussing bird names ("I am so sorry, there's a portal into the underworld down there! It's ridiculous!") He continued to mock Rory after that ("Do I get more points if I say the answer in another language?") but apparently in good spirit.

A "Luvvie Alarm" has on occasion sounded when a guest does a blatant name drop. It was originally used on [[John Sessions]] when he name dropped [[Robert Redford]] in series 2, and was used on Fry (when Sessions came back as a panelist in an episode of series 3), when he mentioned a party he had attended hosted by the [[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster|Duke and Duchess of Westminster]] (as pointed out by guest [[Clive Anderson]], the Duke was [at the time of recording] the second richest man in the UK after [[Roman Abramovich]]; [[as of 2006]], he is currently third-richest after Abramovich and [[Lakshmi Mittal]]).

At the end of the third series, [[Dara O'Briain]] was deducted points for having stated, in the series before, that the [[triple point]] of [[water]] is zero degrees [[Celsius]], an answer which earned him points at the time. Some viewers, however, wrote in to say that the triple point of water is in fact 0.0''1'' degrees, and so the points awarded Dara in the previous series were revoked. Dara humorously retorted with, "How many people sat at home watching that and said, 'It's just a comedy show, but I'm not letting that [[feck]]er get away with that!'?"

Some people have suggested that answers to questions are rehearsed in advance, in order to provide a more entertaining programme, an accusation also headed towards shows such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''. On the official website the makers of the show insist that this is not the case, and instead a series of "warm up" questions are asked before recording starts.

==''QI'' culture==
[[Image:QI-Book.jpg|thumb|right|''QI: The Book of General Ignorance'']]

In October 2004 a ''QI'' [[café]]/[[bar (establishment)|bar]], eclectic bookshop and private members' [[club]] opened at Quite Interesting Ltd's headquarters, on [[Turl Street, Oxford|Turl Street]] in [[Oxford]]. For the duration of the series, the bar shows the broadcast episode every Friday. The club intends to promote things that are 'quite interesting', and arranges speakers and events.

On [[14 November]] [[2005]] an interactive ''QI'' game on DVD was released by [[Warner Home Video]].

After much pressure from fans, the [[BBC]]'s DVD division, [[2 entertain]] released the first TV series on DVD on [[6 November]] [[2006]]. The DVD also contains the pilot, which has never been broadcast, and features to date the only appearance of [[Eddie Izzard]] as a panellist.

On [[5 October]] [[2006]], ''[http://www.faber.co.uk/book_detail.html?bid=37386 The Book of General Ignorance]'' was published in hardback by [[Faber and Faber]], with a [[foreword]] by Stephen Fry and "Four words by Alan Davies" - "Will this do, Stephen?". It contains a list of 200 popular misconceptions, most of which have appeared in the "General Ignorance" round of ''QI''. On [[8 December]] [[2006]], the book reached the top of [[amazon.co.uk|amazon.co.uk's]] [[best-seller]] list.

A ''QI'' feature has appeared in [[BBC MindGames Magazine|''BBC MindGames'']] magazine from its fifth issue and is based on facts and questions in the sphere of General Ignorance.  From [[10 February]] [[2007]] a weekly QI column began in ''[[The Telegraph]]''; 52 columns are planned.

==The QI Elves==
The Elves devise the questions for ''QI''. The Elves spend their time researching several topics, constantly trying to find things 'quite interesting'. Often, when a subject is brought up in the show, the Elves will contact the show mid-way to provide and even correct information given. The panellists are given the list of questions to be asked an hour or two before recording, but are forbidden to ask the Elves for preparatory materials or other help.<ref>''QI Series 1 DVD'' Factoids</ref> It is known that Alan never does any preparation at all.<ref>''QI Series 1 DVD'' Factoids</ref>

==Trivia==
*QI stands for '''Q'''uite '''I'''nteresting, and is also a play on the term IQ, short for [[intelligence quotient]]. 

*The theme tune was composed by [[Howard Goodall]], who has twice appeared on the show.

*According to [[BARB]] ''QI'' has the highest ratings of any show on [[BBC Four]]. [http://www.qi.com/tv/audience.php]

* Although considered to be the 'stupid' panellist (and described on the cover of the DVD release as Fry's favourite stud-muffin), Alan Davies has actually won three shows. The first came towards the end of Series A and the second and third time in the more recent D series.  His third win appeared at first to be due to a question that Fry made a mistake on, giving the answer before announcing that it was supposed to be the bonus question; Davies pounced on his chance. As it transpires, however, Davies finished with 54 points whilst [[Andy Hamilton]], [[John Sessions]] and [[David Mitchell (actor)|David Mitchell]] each finished in negative figures — so he would have won anyway. This third win puts him towards, if indeed not <i>at</i>, the top of the ''QI'' leaderboard in wins — though since he's been on every episode of the 40-plus so far, his win percentage is small at 6.122%<ref>3 is 6.12245% of 49. Figure correct as of December 2006.</ref>. Davies has also managed to come second three times, once in series A and twice in Series D (once joint with Phill Jupitus and [[Rory Bremner]], following [[Ronni Ancona]]).

* The highest score on ''QI'' is 200, scored by [[Helen Atkinson-Wood]]. Her high score was reached when she got a question correct about the chemical formula for the explosion in a custard factory. On the [[Children in Need]] 2006 episode, [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]] won with 3,000,000 points; however, this was merely in the spirit of comedy for charity so the scores was counted in millions.

* The lowest score on ''QI'' is -144, scored by Alan Davies in episode 7 of series D. He got a 150 point penalty, for suggesting that [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s first name was "Randy" (the correct answer is Mohandas Karamchand). Davies was leading with 6 points, and would have won if he had not got the penalty. Instead Dara O'Briain won with 3 points. In the Children in Need 2006 episode, Alan Davies got -29,000,000 points, in much the same manner as those awarded to Jonathan Ross above.

* In series D, for the first time ever, the audience won answering just one question (scoring two points on the episode on Death). The panellist with the highest score was [[Andy Parsons]] with zero.

* Series B saw Alan Davies making a stand and announcing that he didn't want to do General Ignorance questions because he always gets them wrong, and "will not ''be'' humiliated at Christmas". In turn, Fry offered to switch places with him, to the delight of the audience. Despite the seeming spontaneity of the swap, it was undoubtedly pre-planned (at least on the part of Davies and the producers), as evidenced by the fact that Davies, in turn, produced his own set of questions on loose-leaf paper, most of which he directed at Fry. At the end of the show, Fry announced that the game's loser was, in fact, he himself, as a result of his conceding to many of Davies' traps.

* Episode 10 of series D (Divination) did not feature Alan Davies as a panellist except in a pre-recorded opening sequence where he appeared to teleport out of his seat and disappear. Throughout the episode he seemed to communicate with the other members from the spirit plane (via more pre-recorded messages), providing several obvious-but-wrong answers. Thus Davies still managed to end the episode with the lowest score, despite not actually being a contestant. Davies's absence could be explained by the fact he chose to watch [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] compete in the [[UEFA Champions League]] Final in Paris on the evening of the recording.

* In episode 11 of series D (Deprivation), the show was done cheaply. The lighting director was "fired" so there was less light than normal, the desks had been removed, the audience were forced to watch on the street and the buzzers were hand-cranked.

* Although many of the facts presented on the show are correct, there have been the occasional slip-up, such as announcing the age of the oldest woman to be 125 when she died, when in fact she, [[Jeanne Calment]], only lived to be 122.
