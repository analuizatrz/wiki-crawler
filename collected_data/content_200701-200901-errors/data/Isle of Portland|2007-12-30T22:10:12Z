The '''Isle of Portland''' ({{pronEng|ˈpɔːtlənd}}) is a limestone island {{convert|6|km|mi|0}} long by {{convert|2.4|km|mi|1}} wide in the [[English Channel]]. Portland is {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} south of the resort of [[Weymouth]], forming the southernmost point of the county of [[Dorset]], in [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. [[Chesil Beach]] connects the island to the mainland, and the [[A354 road]] bridge connects to Weymouth, which together form the borough of [[Weymouth and Portland]]. The population of the island is almost 13,000.

Portland is a central part of the [[Jurassic Coast]], a [[World Heritage Site]] on the Dorset and east Devon coast, important for its geology and landforms. The name of the island is used for one of the [[British Sea Areas]], and has been [[Portland|exported]] as the name of North American and Australian towns. [[Portland limestone]] is still quarried here, and is used in British architecture, including [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and [[Buckingham Palace]].

The large, deep artificial [[Portland Harbour|harbour]] on Portland's northern shore was an important [[Royal Navy]] base during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]; the Royal Navy and [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]] trained in its waters until the 1990s. The harbour is a small civilian port and popular recreation area; the [[Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy]] will host the sailing events for the [[2012 Olympic Games]].

==History==
[[Image:Uk dor portcastle.JPG|thumb|right|Portland Castle was built to defend the island in the 16th century.]]
Portland has been inhabited since at least the [[Mesolithic]] period (the Middle [[Stone Age]])&mdash;there is archaeological evidence of Mesolithic inhabitants near [[Portland Bill]],<ref name="Mesolithic">{{cite web | year = 2002 | url = http://www.gallica.co.uk/celts/portland.htm | title =  Mesolithic Site, Portland | publisher = Association for Portland Archaeology | accessdate = 2007-07-30}}</ref> and of inhabitation of the island in ages since. The Romans occupied Portland; they reputedly called the island ''Vindelis''.<ref name="vindelis">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenaref/hofmann/hof4/s0773b.html | title =  Lexicon Universale | publisher = Universitat Mannheim | accessdate = 2007-04-03}}</ref><ref name="Portland stone" /> In 1539 [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] ordered the construction of [[Portland Castle]] to defend the island from attacks by the French; the castle cost the king £4,964.<ref name="portlandcastle">{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://www.thedorsetpage.com/locations/Place/P120.htm | title =  Portland, Dorset, England | publisher = The Dorset Page | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> It is one of the best preserved castles from this period, and is open to the public under the administration of [[English Heritage]].<ref name="englishheritage">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.15746 | title =  Portland Castle | publisher = English Heritage | accessdate = 2007-07-30}}</ref>

Sir [[Christopher Wren]], the notable architect and [[Member of Parliament]] for nearby Weymouth, used six million tons of white [[Portland limestone]] to rebuild destroyed parts of London after the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire of 1666]].

[[Image:Porland island map1937.jpg|thumb|right|220px|image|A map of the Isle of Portland from 1937, showing the railway to Easton.]]
Railway branch lines have run on Portland since the early 19th century. The Merchant's Railway was the earliest&mdash;it opened in 1826 (one year after the [[Stockton and Darlington railway]]), and ran from the quarries at the north of [[Tophill]] to the docks in [[Castletown, Dorset|Castletown]], where Portland stone was shipped around the country.<ref name="railways">{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.johnrnew.demon.co.uk/weyrails.htm | title =  Railways of the Weymouth area | publisher = Island Publishing | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> The [[Portland Branch Railway|Weymouth and Portland Railway]] was laid in 1865, and ran from a station in [[Melcombe Regis]], across the Fleet and below sea level behind Chesil Beach to Victoria Square station in [[Chiswell]].<ref name="railways2">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=351 | title =  Weymouth to Portland Railway, Construction and growth | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> The line continued as the Easton and Church Hope Railway, running through Castletown and ascending the cliffs at East Weares, to loop back north to a station in [[Easton, Dorset|Easton]].<ref name="railways" /> The line closed to passengers in March 1965, and the final goods train ran in April that year.<ref name="railways2" />

Coastal flooding has affected the island's residents and transport for centuries&mdash;the only way off the island lies below sea level on the [[lee]] of Chesil Beach, as does the village of [[Chiswell]]. In autumn and winter Chesil Beach faces severe storms and massive waves, which have a [[fetch (geography)|fetch]] across the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name="flooding">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.swgfl.org.uk/jurassic/chis10.htm | title =  Chiswell case study: The Scheme | publisher = Jurassic Coast | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref> Following two severe flood events in the 1970s, [[Weymouth and Portland]] Borough Council and [[Wessex Water]] decided to investigate the structure of the beach, and possible [[coastal management]] schemes that could be built to protect Chiswell and the beach road. In the 1980s it was agreed that a scheme to protect against a [[return period|one-in-five year]] storm would be practicable; it would reduce flood depth and duration in more severe storms.<ref name="flooding" /> [[Coastal defence#Hard construction techniques|Hard engineering]] techniques were employed in the scheme, including a [[gabion]] beach crest running {{convert|1.6|km|mi|0}} to the north of Chiswell, an extended [[sea wall]] in [[Chesil Cove]], and a [[culvert]] running from inside the beach, underneath the beach road and into [[Portland Harbour]], to divert flood water away from low lying areas.<ref name="flooding" />

The naval base closed at the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1995, and the Royal Naval Air Station closed in 1999, although the runway remained in use for [[Her Majesty's Coastguard]] Search and Rescue flights as MRCC Portland.<ref name="serepta" /> MRCC Portland's area of responsibility extends midway across the [[English Channel]], and from [[Start Point, Devon|Start Point]] in [[Devon]] to the Dorset/[[Hampshire]] border, covering an area of around {{convert|10400|sqkm|sqmi|-2}}.<ref name="coastguard">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.beercoastguard.org/coastguard_rescue_helicoper.htm | title =  Coastguard Rescue Helicopter | publisher = Beer Coastguard | accessdate = 2007-07-28}}</ref> The 12 Search and Rescue teams in the Portland area dealt with almost 1000 incidents in 2005;<ref name="mrccportland">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga-dops-regional/eastern-region/mcga-dops_rr_east_regional-eastern-region-solent.htm | title =  Eastern Region - Area South | publisher = [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] | accessdate = 2007-07-28}}</ref> most teams use lifeboats but the Portland crew use a [[Sikorsky S-61]] helicopter.<ref name="coastguard" />

==Governance==
[[Image:DorsetWeymouthPortland.png|thumb|right|Weymouth and Portland shown in Dorset.]]
Portland is an ancient [[Royal Manor]], and until the 19th century remained a separate [[Liberty (division)|liberty]] within Dorset for administration. The island was an [[urban district]] from 1894 to 1974, until the borough of [[Weymouth and Portland]] formed on [[1 April]] [[1974]], under the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. This merged the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis and the Portland urban district. The borough is divided into 15 wards for elections, and 3 of them are cover Portland.<ref name="wards">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=620 | title = Ward Map | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-12-16}}</ref>

The Mayor of Weymouth and Portland is David Harris ([[Liberal Democrats|Lib Dem]]), and Tim Munro ([[Independent politician#United Kingdom|Independent]]) is Deputy Mayor and Mayor of Portland Town Council.<ref name="weymouthcouncillors">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/Council/Councillors/home.asp?svid=586 | title = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council - councillors | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> Weymouth, Portland and the [[Purbeck (district)|Purbeck]] district are in the [[Dorset South]] [[United Kingdom constituencies|parliamentary constituency]], created in 1885.

==Geography==
[[Image:Terraced houses at fortuneswell 2.jpg|right|thumb|Terraced Portland Stone houses in Fortuneswell, Underhill.]]
The Isle of Portland lies in the [[English Channel]], {{convert|2|km|mi|1}} south of [[Weymouth]] and  {{convert|200|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west-southwest of [[London]], at {{coor dms|50|32|60|N|2|26|24|W|city}} (50.55,&nbsp;&minus;2.44). Portland is situated approximately half-way along the [[UNESCO]] [[Jurassic Coast]] [[World Heritage Site]]; the site includes {{convert|153|km|mi|0}} of the Dorset and east Devon coast that is important for its geology and landforms.<ref name="jurassiccoast">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.jurassiccoast.com/279/visiting-the-coast-31/gateway-towns-146/portland-447.html | title = Portland | publisher = [[Jurassic Coast]] | accessdate = 2007-12-29}}</ref> The [[South West Coast Path]] runs around the island, it is the United Kingdom's longest [[Long-distance footpaths in the UK|national trail]] at {{convert|1014|km|mi|0}}. Portland is unusual as it is connected to the mainland at [[Abbotsbury]] by [[Chesil Beach]], a [[tombolo]] which runs {{convert|29|km|mi|0}} north-west to [[West Bay, Dorset|West Bay]].<ref name="chesil">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/chesil.htm | title = The Chesil Beach - General Introduction | publisher = Southampton University | accessdate = 2007-08-13}}</ref> This feature is often incorrectly defined as a [[peninsula]] or a tombolo&mdash;Portland is a 'tied' island, and Chesil Beach is its tombolo.<ref name="tombolo">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.vnc.qld.edu.au/enviro/flinders/land-defns.htm | title = Coastal Landform Definitions | publisher = Villanova College | accessdate = 2007-07-29}}</ref>

There are eight settlements on Portland, the largest being [[Fortuneswell]] in Underhill and [[Easton, Dorset|Easton]] in Tophill. [[Castletown, Dorset|Castletown]] and [[Chiswell]] are the other villages in Underhill, and [[Weston, Dorset|Weston]], [[Southwell, Dorset|Southwell]], [[Wakeham]] and [[the Grove]] occupy Tophill. Older buildings on the island are built out of Portland Stone; houses have walls 30&ndash;60[[centimetre|cm]] (1&ndash;2 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) thick, and a similar layout governed by the culture and living standards at the time they were built. Most houses have not been painted and retain the yellow-grey colour of the stone, giving the island a different character to the mainland.

===Geology===
[[Image:Dorset geology.png|thumb|right|260px|The Isle of Portland lies on Upper [[Oolite]] [[limestone]].]]
Geologically, Portland is separated into two areas; the steeply sloping land at the north end of the island called [[Underhill, Dorset|Underhill]], and the larger, gently sloping land to the south, called [[Tophill]]. [[Portland stone]] lies under Tophill; the strata decline at a shallow angle of around 1.5 degrees, from a height of {{convert|151|m|ft|0}} near [[Verne (HM Prison)|the Verne]] in the north, to just above sea level at [[Portland Bill]].<ref name="geology">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/portnew.htm#cross | title = General Geology | publisher = Southampton University | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> The geology of Underhill is different to Tophill; Underhill lies on a steep [[escarpment]] composed of Portland Sand, lying above a thicker layer of [[Kimmeridge Clay]], which extends to Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour. This Kimmeridge Clay has resulted in a series of landslides, forming West Weares and East Weares.<ref name="geology" />

{{convert|2.4|km|1}} underneath south Dorset lies a layer of [[Triassic]] [[rock salt]], and Portland is one of four locations in the United Kingdom where the salt is thick enough to create stable cavities.<ref name="echogas">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/local/display.var.1881457.0.island_may_be_key_gas_supplier.php | title = Island may be key gas supplier | publisher = Dorset Echo | accessdate = 2007-12-05}}</ref><ref name="portlandgas1">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.portland-gas.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=105 | title = Portland gas storage project | publisher = Portland Gas | accessdate = 2007-12-05}}</ref> Portland Gas has applied to [[salt mine|excavate]] 14 caverns to store {{convert|1000000000|cum|cuft}} of [[natural gas]], which is 1% of the UK’s total annual demand.<ref name="echogas" /><ref name="portlandgas1" /> The caverns will be connected to the National gas grid at [[Mappowder]] via a {{convert|37|km|mi|adj=on}} pipeline, which will be laid in 2009.<ref name="echogas" /><ref name="portlandgas1" /> The surface facilities will be complete to store the first gas in winter 2010, and the entire cavern space will be available for storage in winter 2013.<ref name="portlandgas1" /> As part of the £350&nbsp;million scheme,<ref name="echogas" /> a [[Grade II listed]] former engine shed is planned to be converted into an £1.5&nbsp;million educational centre with a café and an exhibition space about the geology of Portland.<ref name="educationcentre">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/local/display.var.1881211.0.island_may_get_a_1_5m_visitor_centre.php | title = Island may get a £1.5m visitor centre | publisher = Dorset Echo | accessdate = 2007-12-05}}</ref>

===Portland Bill===
[[Image:Portland Bill Lighthouse 2.jpg|thumb|right|Portland Bill lighthouse and visitor's centre.]]
[[Portland Bill]] should not be confused with the Isle of Portland&mdash;Portland Bill is a narrow promontory of Portland stone which forms the most southerly part of Tophill. The Bill has three lighthouses; it is an important way-point for ships passing the island and its [[tidal race]]. The current lighthouse was refurbished in 1996 and became computer-controlled; a visitor's centre giving information and guided tours of the lighthouse was built nearby.<ref name="lighthouse">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/interactive/gallery/portland_bill.html | title = Portland Bill Lighthouse | publisher = Trinity House | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> Two earlier lighthouses stand further inland, one is an important observatory used by [[ornithology|ornithologists]], providing records of bird migration and accommodation for visitors.<ref name="lighthouse" /><ref name="wildlife">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=546 | title = Portland wildlife | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref>
 
Portland Ledge (the Shambles) is an underwater extension of Portland Stone into the English Channel at a place where the depth of Channel is {{convert|20|m|0}} to {{convert|40|m|0}}. Tidal flow is disrupted by the feature, at {{convert|10|m|0}} deep and {{convert|2.4|km|nmi|1}} long it causes a tidal race to the south of Portland Bill, the so-called ''Portland Race''.<ref name="shambles">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/portnew.htm#offshore | title = Offshore Geology | publisher = Southampton University | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> The current only stops for brief periods during the twelve and half hour tidal cycle and can reach {{convert|4|m/s|kn|0}} at the spring tide of {{convert|2|m|0}}.<ref name="shambles" />

===Ecology===
[[Image:Dorset pl sp 26.jpg|thumb|right|The disused Tout Quarry became a sculpture park and nature reserve. Sculptors including [[Antony Gormley]] have produced work there.]]
Due to its isolated coastal location, the Isle of Portland has an extensive range of [[flora]] and [[fauna]]; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]].<ref name="jurassiccoast" /><ref name="wildlife" /> Sea and migratory birds occupy the island in different seasons, sometimes these include rare species which draw ornithologists from around the country.<ref name="jurassiccoast" /><ref name="fauna" /> Rare visitors to the surrounding seas include dolphins, seals and basking sharks.<ref name="wildlife" /> Chesil Beach is one of only two sites in Britain where the Scaly Cricket can be found; unlike any other cricket it is wingless and does not sing or hop.<ref name="fauna">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=542 | title = Chesil Beach | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref>

The comparatively warm and sunny climate of the island allows species of plants to thrive which do not on the mainland. The limestone soil has low nutrient levels; hence smaller species of wild flowers and grasses are able to grow in the absence of larger species.<ref name="wildlife" /> Portland Sea Lavender can be found on the higher sea cliffs&mdash;unique to Portland it is one of the United Kingdom's rarest plants.<ref name="flora">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=543 | title = Coastal Flora & Fauna | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref> The wild flowers and plants make an excellent habitat for butterflies; over half of the British Isles' 57 butterfly species can be seen on the island, including varieties that migrate from mainland Europe.<ref name="jurassiccoast" /> Species live on Portland that are rare in the United Kingdom, including the unique Silver Studded Blue.<ref name="butterflies">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=541 | title = Portland Butterflies | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}</ref>

===Climate===
The mild seas which surround the island produce a [[temperate]] climate ([[Koppen climate classification#GROUP C: Temperate/mesothermal climates|Koppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') with a small variation in daily and annual temperatures. The average annual mean temperature from 1971 to 2000 was 10.2 to 12&nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]].<ref name="annualmean">{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif | title = Mean Temperature Annual Average | publisher = [[Met Office]] | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref> The warmest month is August, with an average [[temperature range]] of 13.3&nbsp;°C to 20.4&nbsp;°C, and the coolest month is February, with a range of 3.1&nbsp;°C to 8.3&nbsp;°C.<ref name="annualweather">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=1015 | title = Annual weather summary | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref>

In mid 2005 Portland's estimated population was 12,710;<ref name="estimate" /> this figure has remained around twelve to thirteen thousand since the 1970s. In 2005 there were 5,474 dwellings on the island, in an area of {{convert|11.5|sqkm|acre|0}}, giving an approximate [[population density]] of 1100 people per km².<ref name="dorsetforyou" /> The population is almost entirely native to England&mdash;96.8% of residents are of white ethnicity.<ref name="dorsetforyou" /> House prices in Weymouth and Portland are relatively high by UK standards, yet around average for most of the south of England&mdash;the average price of a detached house in 2007 was [[GBP|£]]327,569; [[semi-detached]] and Terraced houses were cheaper, at £230,932 and £190,073 respectively, and an apartment or [[maisonette]] cost £168,727.<ref name="houseprices">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/uk_house_prices/html/19uj.stm | title = UK House Prices | publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate = 2007-11-06}}</ref><ref>These figures are for July to September in 2007.</ref>

Crime rates on the island are below that of Weymouth and the United Kingdom&mdash;there were 9.1 burglaries per 1000 people in 2005 and 2006; which is higher than [[South West England]] (8.9 per 1000) but lower than [[England and Wales]] (13.5 per 1000). Unemployment levels are lower in summer than the winter&mdash;1.8% of the economically active population in July 2006 were not employed, and 5.3% were unemployed year-round,<ref name="dorsetforyou" /> the same as the United Kingdom average.<ref name="unemployment">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=12  | title = Employment | publisher = [[Office for National Statistics]] | accessdate = 2007-08-05}}</ref> The largest religion in Weymouth and Portland is Christianity, at almost 75%, followed by those with no religion, at almost 16%.<ref name="religion" />

==Culture==
===Sport and recreation===
[[Image:Uk dor sailingacademy.JPG|thumb|right|Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy]]
In 2000, the [[Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy]] was built in Osprey Quay in Underhill as a centre for sailing in the United Kingdom. [[Weymouth Bay|Weymouth and Portland's waters]] were credited by the [[Royal Yachting Association]] as the best in Northern Europe.<ref name="wpnsa">{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/London2012/home.asp?svid=14 | title = 2012 Olympic Games sailing venue | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref> Weymouth and Portland regularly host local, national and international sailing events in their waters; these include the J/24 World Championships in 2005, trials for the 2004 Athens Olympics, the ISAF World Championship 2006, the BUSA Fleet Racing Championships, and the RYA Youth National Championships.<ref name="wpnsaevents">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.wpnsa.org.uk/pressreleases.htm | title = WPNSA - press releases | publisher = Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref>

In 2005, the WPNSA was selected to host sailing events at the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games|2012 Olympic Games]]&mdash;mainly because the Academy had recently been built, so no new venue would have to be provided. However, as part of the [[South West of England Regional Development Agency]]'s plans to redevelop Osprey Quay, a new 600-berth marina and an extension with more on-site facilities will be built.<ref name="portlandmarina">{{cite web |year = 2007 | url = http://www.portlandmarina.co.uk | title = Dean and Reddyhoff Marina | publisher = Dean and Reddyhoff Limited | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}</ref> Construction is scheduled between October 2007 and the end of 2008, therefore Weymouth and Portland will be the first in the United Kingdom to finish building a venue for the Olympic Games.<ref name="wpnsaextension">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/6246176.stm | title = New Olympic marina plan approved | publisher = The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate = 2007-06-27}}</ref>

Weymouth Bay and Portland Harbour are used for other water sports&mdash;the reliable wind is favourable for [[windsurfing|wind-]] and [[kitesurfing|kite-surfing]]. Chesil beach and Portland Harbour are used regularly for angling, diving to shipwrecks, snorkelling, canoeing, and swimming.<ref name="watersports">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/Leisure/Watersports/home.asp?svid=69 | title = Watersports in Weymouth and Portland | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref> The limestone cliffs and quarries are used for [[rock climbing]]; Portland has areas for [[bouldering]] and deep water soloing, however [[sport climbing]] with bolt protection is the most common style on the island.<ref name="rock climbing">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.rockfax.com/databases/results_area.html?id=5 | title = World Rock Climbing Information: Portland | publisher = ROCKFAX | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>

===Rabbits===
[[Image:CoombefieldBlocks.jpg|thumb|right|Accidents in Portland's quarries lead to a fear of the word 'rabbit'.]]
Rabbits have been associated with bad luck for centuries on Portland; use of the name is still taboo&mdash;the creatures are often referred to as "Underground Mutton", "Long-Eared Furry Things" or just "bunnies".<ref name="wallaceandgromit">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/4318710.stm  | title = Wallace and Gromit spook island | publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> The fear of the word is believed to derive from quarry workers; they would see rabbits emerging from their burrows immediately before a rock fall and blame them for increasing the risk of dangerous, sometimes deadly, [[landslide]]s.<ref name="rabbits" /> There have been cave-ins, and in one instance a crane operator died when his crane toppled on weak ground above the burrows. If a rabbit was seen in a quarry, the workers would pack up and go home for the day, until the safety of the area had been assured.<ref name="wallaceandgromit" />

Even today older Portland residents are offended or go quiet at the mention of rabbits;<ref name="rabbits">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=784  | title = Rabbits, the Portland taboo word | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> this superstition came to national attention in October 2005 when a special batch of advertisement posters were made for the [[Wallace and Gromit]] film, [[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit|The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]. In respect of local beliefs the adverts omitted the word 'rabbit' and replaced the film's title with the phrase ''"Something bunny is going on"''.<ref name="wallaceandgromit" />

===In literature===
In ''[[The Warlord Chronicles]]'', [[Bernard Cornwell]] suggests that Portland was the [[Isle of the Dead (mythology)|Isle of the Dead]], a place of internal exile, where the causeway was guarded to keep the 'dead' (people suffering insanity) from crossing [[the Fleet]] and returning back to the mainland. However, there is no archaeological evidence of such occurrences.<ref name="isleofthedead">{{cite web | year = 1999 | url = http://www.britishdowsers.org/EEG_site/archive/articles/aua2001_issue24/isleofdead_JHarvey_m.htm | title = The Isle of the Dead | publisher = British Society of Dowsers | accessdate = 2007-07-30}}</ref>

[[Thomas Hardy]] called Portland the ''Isle of Slingers'' in his novels; the isle was the main setting of ''[[The Well-Beloved]]'', and was featured in ''[[The Trumpet-Major]]''.<ref name="slingers">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.lymeregis.com/hardy_country/ | title = Thomas Hardy County and the Hardy Trail | publisher = Lyme Regis Tourist Information | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> Islanders were expert stone-throwers in the defence of their island, and Hardy's ''Isle of Slingers'' is heavily based on Portland; the ''Street of Wells'' representing Fortuneswell and ''The Beal'' as Portland Bill. Hardy named Portland the ''Gibraltar of the North'', with reference to the island's similarities with [[Gibraltar]]; its physical geography, isolation, comparatively mild climate, and [[Underhill, Dorset|Underhill]]'s winding streets.<ref name="wellbeloved">{{cite web | authorlink = [[Thomas Hardy]] | year = 2007 | url = http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Well-Beloved1.html | title = The Well-Beloved by Thomas Hardy | publisher = Full Books | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref>
