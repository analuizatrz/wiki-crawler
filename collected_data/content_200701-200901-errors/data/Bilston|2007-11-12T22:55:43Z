'''Bilston''' is a town in [[England]]'s [[West Midlands county|West Midlands]].  It is the south-eastern corner of the Metropolitan Borough and City of [[Wolverhampton]].  Two [[Ward (politics)|wards]] of Wolverhampton City Council cover the town: [[Bilston East]] and [[Bilston North]].

==History==
Bilston was first referred to in 985 as ''Bilsatena'' when Wolverhampton was granted to Wulfrun <ref> http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=860 Charter S 860</ref> then in 996 as ''Bilsetnatun'' in the grant charter of St. Mary's (now St Peter's) church in Wolverhampton. <ref>http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&id=1380&type=charter Charter S 1380</ref> <ref>http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/wulfruna/wulfruna01.htm Lady Wulfruna</ref> It is later mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as a village called ''Billestune'', being a largely rural area until the [[nineteenth century]].  ''Bilsetnatun'' can be intrepreted as to mean the settlement (ton) of the folk (saetan) of the ridge (bill). 

Situated just two miles south-east of Wolverhampton, it was extensively developed for factories and [[coal]]mining.  Many houses were constructed in the Bilston area.  Between [[1920]] and [[1966]], the council replaced most of the nineteenth century [[terraced house]]s with rented modern houses and flats on developments like Stowlawn, The Lunt and Bunker's Hill.  Bilston has had a [[market]] in the town centre for many years.

A Bilston [[Urban District]] Council was formed in [[1894]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] covering the ancient parish of Bilston.   The urban district was granted a [[Royal Charter]] in 1933, becoming a [[municipal borough]] and the First Charter Mayor was Alderman Herbert Beach.  In 1966 the borough of Bilston was abolished, with most of its territory annexed to the [[county borough]] of Wolverhampton (see [[History of West Midlands]]).

Bilston's Town Hall is presently being refurbished.  It had been derelict since the 1990s after Wolverhampton Council discontinued its use as Housing Offices.  It is hoped that the Town Hall will be brought back into public use following the completion of its refurbishment.

Few towns were more dramatically transformed during the [[Industrial Revolution]] as Bilston was. In [[1800]], it was still a largely rural area dependant on farming. By [[1900]], it was a busy town with numerous factories and coal mines, as well as a large number of houses that had been built to house workers. 

The industry remained prolific during the interwar years, but much of the housing was now sub standard, and during the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]] many of the older houses were cleared and replaced by new council houses that featured so many modern conveniences that were previously unknown to their occupants. Many of these houses were built on new housing estates previously occupied by coalfields or farmland, though some were built on the site of older houses.

The council housing revolution in Bilston continued after the [[Second World War]] and for some time after the area became part of [[Wolverhampton]] in [[1966]]. 

By the end of the [[1970s]], almost all of the sub standard housing in Bilston had been cleared, but the area was in the early stages of an industrial decline which put hundreds of local people out of work and saw unemployment reach its highest levels in living memory. Things have improved over the last 20 years with more businesses in the service sector setting up around Bilston, but unemployment is still higher than the local average.

Other exciting modern day projects in Bilston include the [[Black Country Route]] (opened in phases between [[1986]] and [[1995]]), that gave Bilston quick road links to important towns such as [[Dudley]] and [[Walsall]], and the opening of the [[Midland Metro]] tram line in [[1999]], which gives a speedy public transport link to [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Birmingham]].

==People==
On June 6th 1862, Bilston was the birthplace of the poet [[Sir Henry Newbolt]].

[[John Wilkinson (industrialist)]], "king of the ironmasters," built a blast furnace in Bilston in 1748. He lived and died in [[Bradley, West Midlands]]. His body was returned to his home town of Cumbria.

==Transport==
From [[1850]] to [[1972]] there was a [[railway]] station in Bilston town centre, but passenger services were then withdrawn and the line via Bilston (from Wolverhampton to [[West Bromwich]]) had been almost completely abandoned within a decade. The final stub of the railway, connecting a town centre scrapyard with the [[South Staffordshire Line]] at [[Wednesbury]], closed in [[1992]], only to be re-opened [[1999|seven years later]] as the first phase of the [[Midland Metro]] [[tram]] line between Wolverhampton and [[Birmingham]]. Bilston is served by [[Bilston Central tram stop|Bilston Central]], Loxdale and [[The Crescent tram stop|The Crescent]] [[tram stop]]s.

Another significant development in the Bilston area was the [[A463 road|A463]] [[Black Country Route]]. With more and more cars on the road, the roads around Bilston town centre became increasingly congested as the [[twentieth century]] progressed. It became so severe that, by the late [[1960s]], the government had drawn up plans for a new [[dual carriageway]] bypassing Bilston (and running from the [[A4123 road|A4123]] near [[Coseley]] to Junction 10 of the [[M6 motorway]] at [[Walsall]]) which was scheduled to be completed by [[1976]]. However, the plans collapsed and Bilston was condemned to increased congestion, for another decade at least.

The plans for a new dual carriageway were revived in the early [[1980s]]. This time the planners had decided on a slightly different route which would run much closer to Bilston town centre. The first phase of the road (to be known as Black County Route) was completed in [[1986]], though initially running around half a mile east of the A4123. It was extended in [[1991]] to Oxford Street in Bilston town centre. This expansion resulted in a number of buildings being demolished and some roads having to be re-routed while one road (Market Street) was completely obliterated. This new road changed the face of Bilston town centre forever.

During [[1995]], the final phase of the Black Country Route between Bilston town centre and Junction 10 of the M6 was completed. This new road has seen a major improvement in the traffic flow around Bilston town centre.
