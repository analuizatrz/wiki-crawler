The '''toga''', a distinctive garment of [[Ancient Rome]], was a sash of perhaps twenty [[feet]] (6 [[meters]]) in length which was wrapped around the body and was generally worn over a [[tunic]].  The toga was invariably made of [[wool]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], LLD; William Wayte; G. E.

For most of Rome's history, the toga was a garment worn exclusively by men, while women wore the [[stola]].  [[Roman citizenship|Non-citizens]] were forbidden to wear the toga.

==History==
The toga was based on a dress robe used by the Native people, even though it is usually linked with the Romans. The toga was the dress clothing of the Romans; a thick woollen cloak worn over a [[loincloth]] or [[apron]]. It is believed to have been established around the time of [[Numa Pompilius]], the second King of Rome.  It was taken off indoors, or when hard at work in the fields, but it was considered the only decent attire out-of-doors. This is evident from the story of [[Cincinnatus]]: he was ploughing in his field when the messengers of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] came to tell him that he had been made [[dictator]], and on seeing them he sent his wife to fetch his toga from the house so that they could be received appropriately.<ref>[[Livy|Livius, Titus]] (ca. [[1st century BCE]])jhjhjh Decemvirate", chapter [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0026&layout=&loc=3.26 26], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]''.</ref> While the truth of the story may be doubtful, it nevertheless expresses the Roman sentiment on the subject. 

As time went on, dress styles changed. Romans adopted the shirt (''tunica'', or in [[Greece|Greek]] [[chiton (costume)|chiton]]) which the [[Greeks]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] wore, made the toga more bulky, and wore it in a looser manner. The result was that it became useless for active pursuits, such as those of war.  Thus, its place was taken by the handier ''[[sagum]]'' (woolen [[cloak]]) on all military occasions.  In times of peace, too, the toga was eventually superseded by the ''[[laena]]'', ''[[lacerna]]'', ''[[paenula]]'', and other forms of buttoned or closed cloaks.  However, the toga did remain the [[court dress]] of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].<ref>Spart. ''Sever.'' 1, 7.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>

There were many kinds of togae, each used differently.
*''Toga virilis'' (''toga alba'' or ''toga pura''): A plain white toga worn on formal occasions by most Roman men of legal age, generally about 14 to 18 years, but it could be any stage in their teens.<ref>cf. Mart. viii. 28, 11.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>

*''Toga candida'': "Bright toga"; a toga bleached by chalk to a dazzling white (Isidorus ''Orig.'' xix. 24, 6), worn by [[candidate]]s for [[public office]].<ref>cf. Polybius, x. 4, 8.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>  Thus [[Persius]] speaks of a ''cretata ambitio'', "chalked ambition".  Oddly, this custom appears to have been banned by [[plebiscite]] in 432 BC, but the restriction was never enforced.<ref>Liv. iv. 25, 13.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>  The term is the etymologic source of the  word ''candidate''.

*''Toga praetexta'': An ordinary white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border. It was worn by:
**Freeborn boys who had not yet come of age.<ref>Liv. xxiv. 7, 2. As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>
**All [[Magistratus Curulis|curule magistrate]]s.<ref>cf. Cic. ''post red. in Sen.'' 5, 12. As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref><ref>Zonar. vii. 19.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>
**Ex-curule magistrates and dictators, upon burial<ref>Liv. xxxiv. 7, 2. As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref> and apparently at festivals and other celebrations as well.<ref>cf. Cic. ''Phil.'' ii. 4. 3, 110.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>
**Some priests (e.g., the [[Flamen Dialis]], [[Pontifices]], [[Tresviri Epulones]], the [[augur]]s, and the [[Arval Brethren|Arval brothers]]).<ref>Liv. xxvii. 8, 8; xxxiii. 42.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>
**During the Empire, the right to wear it was sometimes bestowed as an honor independent of formal rank.
**According to tradition, the [[Kings of Rome]].
:Those with the right to wear a ''toga praetexta'' were sometimes termed ''laticlavius'', "having a broad crimson stripe". It also gave its name to a literary form known as [[praetexta]].
*''Toga pulla'': Literally just "dark toga".  It was worn mainly by [[mourning|mourner]]s, but could also be worn in times of private danger or public anxiety.  It was sometimes used as a protest of sorts—when Cicero was exiled, the Senate resolved to wear ''togae pullae'' as a demonstration against the decision.<ref>''post red. in Sen.'' 5, 12.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>  Magistrates with the right to wear a ''toga praetexta'' wore a simple ''toga pura'' instead of ''pulla''.

*''Toga picta'': This toga, unlike all others, was not just dyed but embroidered and decorated.  It was solid purple, embroidered with gold.  Under the Republic, it was worn by generals in their [[Roman triumph|triumph]]s, and by the [[Praetor Urbanus]] when he rode in the chariot of the gods into the circus at the [[Ludi Apollinares]].<ref>cf. Liv. v. 41, 2. As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>  During the Empire, the ''toga picta'' was worn by magistrates giving public [[gladiator]]ial games, and by the [[consul]]s, as well as by the emperor on special occasions.

*''Toga trabea'': According to [[Servius]], there were three different kinds of ''trabea'': one of purple only, for the gods; another of purple and a little white, for kings; and a third, with scarlet stripes and a purple hem,<ref>cf. Isid. ''Orig.'' xix. 24, 8.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref> for augurs and [[Salii (priests)|Salii]].<ref>''ad Aen.'' vii. 612; cf. ad vii. 188.  As cited by ''[[The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''.</ref>  [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] says that those of [[Equites|equestrian]] class wore it as well, but this is not borne out by other evidence.

==Modern usage==
[[Image:Man in toga.jpg|100px|thumb|A male's [[exomis]]|left]]
{{main|Toga party}}
In several countries, the tradition of the [[toga party]] has become popular in recent decades, generally at [[tertiary education|colleges and universities]], perhaps best illustrated in (if not inspired by) the film ''[[Animal House]]''.

This practice trades on the exaggerated legend of Roman debauchery, and participants dress in togas, which are usually makeshift garments fashioned from [[Bed sheet|bed linen]]. As such, these "togas" bear little resemblance to the Ancient Roman garment, being both flimsier and scantier.
