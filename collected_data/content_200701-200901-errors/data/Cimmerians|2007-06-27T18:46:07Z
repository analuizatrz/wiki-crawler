The '''Cimmerians''' ({{lang-el|Κιμμέριοι}}, ''Kimmerioi'') were ancient [[equestrian nomad]]s who, according to [[Herodotus]], originally inhabited the region north of the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Black Sea]], in what is now [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]], in the [[8th century BC|8th]] and [[7th century BC]].  Assyrian records, however, first place them in the region of [[Azerbaijan]] in 714 BC.

==Origins==

Their origins are obscure, but they are believed to have been [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]]. Their language is regarded as being related to [[Thracian language|Thracian]] or [[Iranian language|Iranian]], or at least to have had an Iranian ruling class.<ref>Cimmerian. (2006). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved August 30, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Premium [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9082650]. Actual quote: ''The origin of the Cimmerians is obscure. Linguistically they are usually regarded as Thracian or as Iranian, or at least to have had an Iranian ruling class.''</ref>

According to Encyclopedia Britannica:''They probably did live in the area north of the Black Sea, but attempts to define their original homeland more precisely by archaeological means, or even to fix the date of their expulsion from their country by the Scythians, have not so far been completely successful.''<ref>Cimmerian.

Very little is known archaeologically of the Cimmerians of the Northern Black Sea Coast.
They are associated with the [[Srubna culture]], which displaced the earlier [[catacomb culture]] (2000-1200 BCE).

A few [[Ukrainian stone stela|stone stelae]] found in [[Ukraine]] and the northern Caucasus have been connected with the Cimmerians. They are in a style clearly different from both the later Scythian and the earlier [[Yamna]]/[[Kemi-Oba]] stelae.

There is a theory that the Cimmerians were [[Bulgars]]. According to the ancient "History of the Monk Spiridon" and to the "History of Zograf" ([[Zograf Monastery]]), the Cimmerian king Koled had two sons — Brem and Bolg. After a war with the Scythians, part of the Cimmerians migrated to the west, where Brem conquered West European lands; the Celts and the [[Brython]]s became Brem's successors. The other part of the Cimmerians migrated to the south, where Bolg's tribe resided on the Balkan Peninsula . Bolg's capital was discovered after archaeological excavations near the town of [[Kazanlak]] in what is now central Bulgaria.

==Historical accounts==
[[Image:Urartu715-713.png|thumb|right|Cimmerian invasions of Colchis, Urartu and Assyria during the reign of King Rusas I]]
The first historical record of the Cimmerians appears in [[Assyria]]n annals in the year [[714 BC]]. These describe how a people termed the ''Gimirri'' helped the forces of [[Sargon II of Assyria|Sargon II]] to defeat the kingdom of [[Urartu]]. Their original homeland, called ''Gamir'' or ''Uishdish'', seems to have been located within the buffer state of [[Mannai|Mannae]]. The later geographer [[Ptolemy]] placed the Cimmerian city of ''Gomara'' in this region. After their conquests of [[Colchis]] and [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] in the First Millennium [[Before Christ|BC]], the Cimmerians also came to be known as ''Gimirri'' in [[Georgian language|Georgian]].  According to Georgian historians,<ref>Berdzenishvili, N., Dondua V., Dumbadze, M., Melikishvili G., Meskhia, Sh., Ratiani, P., History of Georgia (Vol. 1), Tbilisi, 1958, pp. 34-36</ref> the Cimmerians played an influential role in the development of both the [[Colchian]] and [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberian]] cultures.  The modern-day Georgian word for [[hero]] which is ''gmiri'', is derived from the word ''Gimirri'', a direct reference to the Cimmerians which settled in the area after the initial conquests. 

Some modern authors assert that the Cimmerians included [[mercenaries]], whom the Assyrians knew as ''Khumri'', who had been resettled there by Sargon. However, later Greek accounts describe the Cimmerians as having previously lived on the [[steppe]]s, between the Tyras ([[Dniester]]) and Tanais ([[Don River, Russia|Don]]) rivers. Several kings of the Cimmerians are mentioned in Greek and [[Mesopotamia]]n sources, including [[Tugdamme]] (''Lygdamis'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]; mid-[[7th century BC]]), and [[Sandakhshatra]] (late-7th century).

A mythical people also named Cimmerians are described in Book 11, 14 of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' as living beyond the [[Oceanus]], in a land of fog and darkness, at the edge of the world and the entrance of Hades; most probably they are unrelated to the Cimmerians of the Black Sea.<ref>Entry: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2357414 Κιμμέριοι] at Henry Liddell & Robert Scott.</ref>

According to the ''Histories'' of [[Herodotus]] (c. 440 BC), the Cimmerians had been expelled from the steppes at some point in the past by the Scythians. To ensure burial in their ancestral homeland, the men of the Cimmerian royal family divided into groups and fought each other to the death. The Cimmerian commoners buried the bodies along the river Tyras and fled from the Scythian advance, across the [[Caucasus]] and into [[Anatolia]] and the [[Near East]]. Their range seems to have extended from Mannae eastward through the [[Medes|Mede]] settlements of the [[Zagros Mountains]], and south of there as far as [[Elam]].

The migrations of the Cimmerians were recorded by the Assyrians, whose king, Sargon II, died in battle against them in [[705 BC]]. They are subsequently recorded as having conquered [[Phrygia]] in [[696 BC]]-[[695 BC]], prompting the Phrygian king [[Midas]] to take poison rather than face capture. In [[679 BC]], during the reign of [[Esarhaddon]] of Assyria, they attacked [[Cilicia]] and [[Tabal]] under their new ruler [[Teushpa]]. Esarhaddon defeated them near [[Hubushna]] (tentatively identified with modern [[Cappadocia]]). 

In [[654 BC]] or [[652 BC]] – the exact date is unclear – the Cimmerians attacked the kingdom of [[Lydia]], killing the Lydian king [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]] and causing great destruction to the Lydian capital, [[Sardis]]. They returned ten years later during the reign of Gyges' son [[Ardys II]] and this time captured the city, with the exception of the citadel. The fall of Sardis was a major shock to the powers of the region; the Greek poets [[Callinus]] and [[Archilochus]] recorded the fear that it inspired in the Greek colonies of [[Ionia]], some of which were attacked by Cimmerian and [[Treres]] raiders.

The Cimmerian occupation of Lydia was brief, however -- possibly due to an outbreak of [[epidemic|plague]]. Between [[637 BC]] and [[626 BC]] they were beaten back by [[Alyattes II]] of Lydia. This defeat marked the effective end of Cimmerian power. The term "Gimirri" was used about a century later in the [[Behistun inscription]] (ca. [[515 BC]]) as a Babylonian equivalent of Persian [[Saka]] (Scythians), but otherwise Cimmerians are not heard of again in Asia, and their ultimate fate is uncertain. It has been speculated that they settled in Cappadocia, known in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] as ''Gamir'' (the same name as the original Cimmerian homeland in Mannae).  However, certain [[Franks|Frankish]] traditions would locate them at the mouth of the [[Danube]] (see [[Sicambri]]).

A reference to the Cimmerians is preserved in '''[[Gomer]]''' '''גמר''' of the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Standard Hebrew]] '''Gómer''', [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''Gōmer''', ''[[Genesis]]'' 10:2, ''[[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]]'' 38:6). As the eldest son of [[Japheth]] and the father of [[Ashkenaz]], [[Riphath]] and [[Togarmah]], his descendants thus represent one of the major branches of the Japhethic race.  

The Cimmerians are also referred to in Homer's Odyssey, as well as in contemporary literature by Robert E. Howard  in his Conan series of novels.

==Language==
Of the language of the Cimmerians, only a few personal names have survived in [[Assyria]]n inscriptions:
*''Te-ush-pa'', mentioned in the annals of [[Esarhaddon]], has been compared to the [[Hurrian]] war deity ''[[Teshub]]''; others interpret it as [[Iranian language|Iranian]], comparing the [[Achaemenid]] name ''Teispes'' ([[Herodotus]] 7.11.2)
*''Dug-dam-me'' (''Dugdammê'') king of the ''Ummân-Manda'' ([[nomad]]s) appears in a prayer of [[Ashurbanipal]] to [[Marduk]], on a fragment at the [[British Museum]]. Other spellings include ''Dugdammi'', and ''Tugdammê''. Yamauchi (1982) interprets the name as Iranian, citing Ossetic "tux-domaeg" meaning "ruling with strength." The name appears corrupted to ''[[Lygdamis]]'' in [[Strabo]] I.3.21. 
*''Sandaksatru'', son of Dugdamme. This is an Iranian reading of the name, and Mayrhofer (1981) points out that the name may also be read as ''Sandakurru''. Mayrhofer likewise rejects the interpretation of "with pure regency" as a mixing of Iranian and Indo-Aryan. Ivancik suggests an association with the [[Anatolia]]n deity [[Sanda]].

Some researchers have attempted to trace various [[toponym|place names]] to Cimmerian origins. It has been suggested that [[Crimea]] is named after the Cimmerians{{Fact|date=February 2007}} as well as the Armenian city of [[Gyumri]]. This, however, seems to be a dubious premise. The name "Crimea" is traceable to the [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]] word ''qırım'' (literally "my [[steppe]]" of "my hill"), and the peninsula was known as [[Taurica]] ("peninsula of the [[Tauri]]") in antiquity (Strabo 7.4.1; Herodotus 4.99.3, Amm. Marc. 22.8.32).

The Cimmerians are now often classified as an [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] people, but based on ancient Greek historical sources, a [[Thracian]] or (less commonly) a [[Celt]]ic association is sometimes assumed. According to C. F. Lehmann-Haupt, the language of the Cimmerians could have been a "missing link" between Thracian and Iranian.

==Possible offshoots==

The Cimmerians are thought to have had a number of offshoots. The [[Thracians]] have been identified as a possible western branch of the Cimmerians. If Herodotus is to be believed, both peoples originally inhabited the northern shore of the [[Black Sea]], and both were displaced around the same time by invaders from further east. Whereas the Cimmerians would have departed this ancestral homeland by heading east and south across the Caucasus, the Thracians migrated west and south into the [[Balkans]], where they established a successful and long-lived culture. The [[Tauri]], the original inhabitants of Crimea, are sometimes identified as a people related to the Thracians.

Although the Cimmerians of historical record only appear on the stage of world history for a brief time (during the [[7th century BC]]), numerous [[Celt]]ic and [[Germanic peoples]] have traditions of being descended from the Cimmerians or Scythians, and some of their ethnic names seem to bear out this belief (e.g. [[Cymru]], [[Cwmry]] or [[Cumbria]], [[Cimbri]]). It is unlikely that either [[Proto-Celtic]] or [[Proto-Germanic]] entered Europe as late as the 7th century BC, their formation being commonly associated with the Bronze Age [[Urnfield culture|Urnfield]] and [[Nordic Bronze Age]] cultures, respectively. It is, however, conceivable that a small-scale (in terms of population) 8th century "[[Thraco-Cimmerian]]" migration triggered cultural changes that contributed to the transformation of the Urnfield culture into the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt C]] culture, ushering in the European [[Iron Age]].

The etymology of ''Cymru'' (i.e. [[Wales]]) and ''Cwmry'' (i.e. [[Cumbria]]), said in [[Welsh people|Welsh]] tradition to derive directly from the "Cimmerians", is instead considered by detractors of this theory as being Celtic ''kom-broges'' meaning "fellow countrymen", or more literally "kom-broges = com-rades".{{Fact|date=February 2007}} As for the [[Cimbri]] tribe, it is not known for certain whether they were Celtic, Germanic, or even, as a third alternative, from an earlier Western Indo-European grouping connected with the [[Ligurian language|Ligurians]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In addition, in sources beginning with the [[Royal Frankish Annals]], the [[Merovingian]] kings of the [[Franks]] traditionally traced their lineage, through a pre-Frankish tribe called the [[Sicambri]], to a group of "Cimmerians" who lived near the mouth of the [[Danube]] river.  

If the Scythians are assumed to be related to the Cimmerians, as has often been claimed, many other peoples claiming possible Scythian descent could also be added to this list. Later Cimmerian remnant groups may have spread as far as to the [[Nordic Countries]].

The association of the Cimmerians with one of the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]] plays a certain role in [[British Israelism]].

==In Pop Culture==
*[[Robert Howard]] wrote of a fictional ancient people called the [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerians]], one of whom was his hero [[Conan the Barbarian]]. Howard's Cimmerians bore little resemblance to the historical people.
*In the last book of [[A Series of Unfortunate Events]], ''[[The End (A Series of Unfortunate Events)|The End]]'', [[Lemony Snicket]] mentions the Cimmerians briefly, and holds them responsible for things done at night having a mysterious air to them.
*The Italian author [[Italo Calvino]] mentions the Cimmerians in his novel, [[If on a winter's night a traveler]]. Several chapters allude to a Cimmerian writer named [[Ukko Ahti]] and his unfinished works.
*In the Sega CD fighting game, ''[[Eternal Champions]]: Challenge from the Dark Side'', the Dark Champion's lair is titled the Cimmerian Complex, likely borrowing the imagery of the shadowy locale at the mouth of [[Hades]] found in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]].

==Archaeology==
*[[Koban culture]] (Northern Caucasus, 12th to 4th centuries BC)
*[[Cernogorovka culture]] (9th to 8th centuries)
*[[Novocerkassk culture]] (8th to 7th century, between Danube and Volga)
