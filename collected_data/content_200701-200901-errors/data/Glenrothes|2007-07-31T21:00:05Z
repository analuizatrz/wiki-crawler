'''Glenrothes''' (''Gleann Rathais'' in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]) is a town located in the heart of the ancient Kingdom of Fife, in east central Scotland. It is approximately equidistant between [[Edinburgh]] and [[Dundee]]. Glenrothes was the second [[New town#United Kingdom|new town]] to be designated in Scotland under the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1946. It was established in 1948 and was created to attract new employment and population to mid-Fife with the creation of the Rothes Colliery, a major [[coal mine]]. The pit closed in 1961, only 4 years into production because of unstemmable flooding problems and a decline in coal requirements nationwide. Today Glenrothes has a population of around 40,000 people, is the administrative centre for Fife and has been successful in attracting a high number of modern industrial companies. The town is well known for its beautiful parks and landscaping, a plethora of sculptures and artworks and one of Scotland's largest indoor shopping malls.

==History==

===Background===
[[Image:Woodside pre Glenrothes.JPG|thumb|right|200px| Housing at Woodside, built pre-Glenrothes]]
Glenrothes was designated in 1948 under the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1946. The land where Glenrothes now sits was largely agricultural and once contained a number of small farming communities. Originally the new town was going to be centred on [[Markinch]], however the village's infrastructure was deemed unable to withstand the substantial growth required to realise a new town. Leslie and Thornton were also considered but as a consequence an area of 5,370 acres that sits between all of these villages was chosen. The land taken was previously an area of great natural beauty much of which was farm land. The policies of Balbirnie House, Leslie House, Balgeddie House falling under the land ownerships of the Balfour, Rothes, Aytoun and Balgonie estates were all incorporated in the Glenrothes designated area (Ferguson 1982, 1996).

The land was sub-divided into areas or "precincts" which were named after the hamlets already established (e.g. Woodside, Cadham), the farms which once occupied the land (e.g. Rimbleton, Caskieberran, Collydean) or historical stately homes in the area (e.g. Balgeddie, [[Glenrothes#Pictures|Balbirnie]], Leslie Parks) (Ferguson 1982, 1996)(Cowling 1997). 

The name Rothes comes from the association with the north-east Scotland Earl of Rothes, family name Leslie, who owned much of the land historically and after whom the largest local settlement Leslie, pre-Glenrothes New Town, was named, and still exists to the north-west of the town. [[Glen]] (Scottish for valley) was added to prevent confusion with [[Rothes]] in [[Moray]], and because the town lies on the [[Leven, Fife|Leven]] valley (Ferguson 1982, 1996) (Cowling 1997) (Links Media 2006).[[Image:Cadham Village.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Cadham Village, built pre-Glenrothes]]

The primary reason for the designation of Glenrothes was to house miners who where to work at a new super coal mine. This was to be the most modern of the day and was built west of Thornton, an established village south of Glenrothes. The Super Pit was named the [http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/imagesCoal.html Rothes Colliery] and it was officially opened by the Queen in 1957. About 5,000 miners were to be required to produce 5,000 tonnes of coal per day, and huge railway yards were established. The pit was to have a working life of 100 years. The planned long-term benefits were to be huge, and the driver for economic regeneration for central Fife. In 1961, 4 years after opening, the huge investment was written off and the mine run down because of un-stemmable flooding. Ironically, miners who'd worked in older deep pits in the area had fore-warned against the development of the Rothes Pit for this very reason. The state-of-the art engineering and design was closed, leaving the huge enclosed concrete wheel-towers standing at Thornton for many years as a forlorn symbol of the collapse (Ferguson 1982, 1996).

Originally the main industry in the Glenrothes area was paper-making (Tullis-Russell and the other mills along the Leven Valley) and [[coal mining]]. Unlike [[East Kilbride]], [[Cumbernauld]] or [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]] Glenrothes was not originally to be a [http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSFG10 Glasgow overspill] new town, although it did later take this role. It was however populated in the early 1950s in large part by mining families moving from the West of [[Scotland]], particularly the [[Glasgow]] area, though many re-settled from the declining [[Lothian]] coalfields too (Ferguson 1982, 1996). 

[[Image:Glenrothes Offices.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Fife Council Chambers and HQ buildings, Glenrothes Town Centre]]
The pit's closure was devastating and further development of Glenrothes was almost stopped. In hindsight the loss of the pit can be seen as a blessing in disguise given the demise of Britian's coal mining industry by [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Government in the 1970's/80's. The pit's closure did however help change the fortunes of the town for the better. Central Government changed the town's role and appointed Glenrothes as one of the economic focal points for Central Scotland. As a result a plethora of modern electronics factories moved into the town. The first big overseas electronic investor was Beckmans Industries in 1959 followed by Hughes Industries in early 1960s. A number of other important companies followed and Glenrothes became a major hub in Scotland's [[Silicon Glen]] (Ferguson 1982, 1996) (Cowling 1997).  

A further boost to the town during the 1970s saw it become the centre of [http://www.fife.gov.uk Fife Council]'s operations.  This took the role from [[Cupar]] which was formally the County Town of Fife. [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/yourtown/index.cfm?fuseaction=facility.display&town=0F9DB065-BF8E-4BB7-85F9FB281784F80B&facid=29F62F6B-D048-4106-B5B486F3DBA3CF46 Fife House](the headquarters of Fife Council) and other Fife Council buildings are situated in Glenrothes' town centre. [[Fife Constabulary]] and [[Scottish Enterprise]] Fife also have their headquarters in the town. Today Glenrothes is the administrative centre for Fife (Ferguson 1982, 1996) (Cowling 1997).

===Glenrothes Development Corporation===

The planning, development, management and promotion of Glenrothes was the responsibility of the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC), a [[quango]] appointed by the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. Fife Council were responsible for implementing the [[infrastructure]] in the town such as schools, parks and roads (Cowling 1997).

The GDC was wound up in 1995, and was asked to undertake any last major works required in the town with the aid of a grant. The Leven Bridge crossing Riverside Park and the Kingdom Centre Phase 4, including the Rothes Halls were some of the last major projects undertaken. Property and assets of the town were either sold off to private companies or passed onto the responsibility of Fife Council. The winding up of the GDC meant that Glenrothes was no longer an official new town. Development and management of the town would now be undertaken by Fife Council. The development corporation left its lasting legacy on the town by overseeing the development of 15,378 houses, 480,692 sq m of industrial floorspace, 68,328 sq m of office floorspace and 53,603 sq m of shopping floorspace by [[31 December]] [[1995]] (Ferguson 1996).

===Glenrothes Today===

While much of the townscape consists of unexceptional 20th century developments, Glenrothes has many surprises. Early precincts of Glenrothes present some of the best examples of post war [[social housing]], two of which (at the time) won [http://www.saltiresociety.org.uk/housing.htm/ Saltire Society Awards]. Three of the towns earliest churches, St. Margaret's, St. Paul's and St. Columba's, are now [[listed buildings]].
[[Image:Balbirnie House.jpg |thumb|right|200px| Balbirnie House Hotel, Balbirnie Park, Glenrothes]]
The historical stately homes, Balbirnie House Hotel, Leslie House and [http://www.balgeddiehouse.com/ Balgeddie House] are all located in Glenrothes. Balbirnie House, former home of the Balfour family, was occupied by the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC) between 1981 until its wind up in 1996. The grounds of the mansion house were bought and developed in 1969 by the GDC to become Balbirnie Park and golf course. The former stable block of the house has been developed as the Balbirnie craft centre and Balbirnie House itself is now a luxury hotel. Balgeddie House, located in the northwest of the town, has also been converted into a luxury hotel (Ferguson 1982, 1996). 

Leslie House, former home of the Rothes family, was once an eventide home owned by the Church of Scotland and most recently is set to become luxury apartments. Much of the former grounds of Leslie House have been used to create Riverside Park. [[Collydean]] precinct hosts a ruin of a 17th century laird's house called [[Pitcairn House]] (Ferguson 1982, 1996).
[[Image:Concrete Hippos.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Marching Hippos, Riverside Park]]
Glenrothes was the first Scottish new town to appoint a town artist in 1968 (Ferguson 1982, 1996). Today, as a result, there is a large variety of artworks and sculptures scattered throughout the town (around 132) made from a variety of materials such as bronze, fibre glass, bricks, sandstone and concrete. The sculptures range from [[Glenrothes#Pictures|giant flowers]], [[Glenrothes#Pictures|giant hands]], a dinosaur, toadstools, [[Glenrothes#Pictures|the Good Samaritan]], a horse & chariot, [[Glenrothes#Pictures|dancing children]], a seated old couple, crocodiles and marching Hippos (Cowling 1997).

Landscaping in Glenrothes often leaves the impression that many of the housing areas have been built in parkland. Housing has generally been built to high standards, especially when compared to other social housing areas in Scotland (Cowling 1997). Glenrothes is undoubtably modern however old buildings still exist and have been carefully integrated into the modern fabric of the town. It has been described as leaving the impression of ''"pleasant modernity"''<ref> Undiscovered Scotland website, Glenrothes featurepage [http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/glenrothes/glenrothes/index.html]</ref>.

Glenrothes serves a wider area as both a service, employment and retail centre. There are a number of attractive villages surrounding the town each unique in their own respect. The surrounding villages are [[Markinch]], [[Leslie, Fife|Leslie]], [[Thornton, Fife|Thornton]], [[Coaltown of Balgonie]], [[Star of Markinch]], [[Milton of Balgonie]] (with [[Balgonie Castle]]) and [[Kinglassie]]. Slightly further afield are [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]], [[Freuchie]], [[Windygates]], [[Kennoway]], [[Muirhead]], [[Auchmuirbridge]] and [[Scotlandwell]].

==Geography==

Glenrothes lies in mid-Fife between the agricultural ''Howe of Fife'' in the north and east and Fife's industrial heartland in the south and west. It is located approximately equidistant between the cities of [[Edinburgh]] (32 miles) and [[Dundee]] (27 miles). Its OS Grid reference is NO281015.

The northern parts of the town lie upland on the southern fringes of the [[Lomond_Hills | Lomond Hills Regional Park]]. The central parts of the town lie on land between the southern lip of the River Leven Valley, a green lung which passes east west through the town, and the Warout ridge. Southern parts of Glenrothes are largely industrial and lie on land which gently slopes south towards the Lochty Burn and the village of Thornton.

===Built environment===
[[Image:South Parks Glenrothes.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Former GDC housing and mature landscaping, Willow Crescent, South Parks]]
Glenrothes' layout was based on an irregular grid. The first town masterplan set out self-contained residential precincts with their own primary schools, local shops and community facilities. Industry was to be separated from the housing areas in planned industrial estates. Traffic would bypass housing precincts by distributor roads which would connect each precinct to a purposely designed town centre and to the industrial estates. Glenrothes developed in a linear fashion starting at Woodside in the east and progressing westwards. Housing was a mixture of low-rise mixed housing and flats. The first masterplan was implemented as far as South Parks and Rimbleton housing precincts(Ferguson 1982, 1996). 

Early Glenrothes precincts, developed under the first masterplan, were based on [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s [[Garden city movement|Garden City]] principles and this is reflected in their housing styles and layouts.
[[Image:Collydean.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Compact housing and segregated pedestrian path, Collydean]]
A second town masterplan was designed in the 1960's following Glenrothes' change of role and was to accomodate an increased population target of 50,000-70,000. New areas of land in the north and south of the designated area were brought into production for new development. The irregular grid layout was retained however housing precincts were to become less self-contained and would share local facilities in a new neighbourhood centre format. The road network was to be upgraded to deal with projected increases in car ownership. New housing estates were developed in the west, south and then northern parts of the town. The precincts of the 1960s and 70's, developed under the second masterplan, were based on principles of [[Radburn]], separating as far as possible footpaths from roads. The townscape changed with a mixture of higher densities and new architectural styles. 

Housing precincts from the 1980s onwards have been developed by the [[private sector]] and more reflect today's aspirations of low density [[suburban]] living (Cowling 1997). Most of this housing was developed in the northern parts of the town.

Large portions of land in the south of the town were developed for industrial purposes. The second master plan was used until the wind-up of the Development Corporation (Ferguson 1982, 1996).

Glenrothes came late into high rise development and as a result it has only a single tower block, which is located adjacent to other tall buildings in the town centre. The townscape is largely low rise until the town centre is reached where flats and taller buildings have been used (Cowling 1997).

===Climate===

Temperatures in Glenrothes, like the rest of Scotland, are relatively moderate given its northern latitude. Fife is a peninsula, located between the [[Firth of Tay]] in the north, the [[Firth of Forth]] in the south and the [[North Sea]] in the east. Summers are relatively cool and the warming of the water over the summer results in warm winters. Average annual temperatures in Glenrothes range from a max of 18°c to a min of 9°c <ref> Weather.co.uk website ''Glenrothes Climate Stats''[http://uk.weather.com/weather/climatology/UKXX0775?from=smartlinks] </ref>.

==Demographics==

Scotland's [[United Kingdom Census 2001|Census 2001]] showed that Glenrothes has a population of 38,679. The demographic make-up of the population is much in line with the rest of Scotland, with 30-44 year olds forming the largest portion of the population (23%). Despite the aging population in Scotland, Glenrothes has 2% fewer pensioners than the Scottish average. Detailed information about Glenrothes from the Census can be [http://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Population&mainArea=Glenrothes&mainLevel=Locality obtained from this Executive website].

The [http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/ General Register Office for Scotland] estimates the 2004 population of the 'Settlement of Glenrothes' at 46,830 <ref>''General Register for Scotland, 2004 population estimates'' [http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/stats/04mid-year-estimates-settlements-table1.pdf] </ref>. This will be the total population of the town and the surrounding villages of Leslie, Markinch, Thornton and Coaltown of Balgonie.

==Economy==

Glenrothes' economy is currently strong with unemployment levels in line with the Scottish average. Glenrothes provides the highest number of jobs (approx 36,000) of any single settlement in Fife <ref>Fife Council (2006/07) ''Glenrothes Economic Profile'' [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_GlenrothesRevisedApr07.pdf] </ref> This situation is particularly evident when compared to the more deprived towns in the travel to work area, Kirkcaldy and Levenmouth <ref>Fife Council (2006/07)''Kirkcaldy Economic Profile'' [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_RevisedKirkcaldy_Apr07.pdf])</ref><ref>Fife Council (2006/07)''Levenmouth Economic Profile'' [http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_LevenmouthFinalCopy.pdf])</ref>. Employment in Glenrothes is largely concentrated in the town centre and in the industrial estates.

===Town Centre and Shopping===
[[Image:Kingdom Centre.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Kingdom Shopping Centre fourth phase, Glenrothes Town Centre]]
Glenrothes [[town centre]] is located on the southern lip of the Leven Valley. It is bounded by a ring road, has been [[town planning|purposely planned]], contains no residential element and is largely enclosed ([http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=56.196385~-3.173257&style=h&lvl=16&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000 see aerial view]).  These are all factors which distinguish it from Fife's other town centres.

The [http://www.kingdomshoppingcentre.co.uk/ Kingdom Centre] forms the main shopping element of the town centre. It is one of the largest single-level [[shopping mall|indoor shopping centres]] in Scotland with around 40,000 sq m (430,000 sq ft) of (gross) floorspace <ref>Kingdom Shopping Centre website- ''Agent Zone'' [http://www.kingdomshoppingcentre.co.uk/web/site/business/retailerssupport/agents.asp]</ref> <ref>Fife Council (2006) ''Glenrothes Town Centre Profile'' [http://www.fife.gov.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_GlenrothesTownCentreFS.pdf] </ref> <ref>Fife Council (2006) ''Fife Town Centre Audit'' [http://www.fife.gov.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_TownCentreAuditFinalReportOct2006.doc] </ref>. 
The centre is popular locally, a fact demonstrated by it having some of the highest levels of footfall in Fife <ref>Fife Council (2006) ''Fife Town Centres Footfall Study'' [http://www.fife.gov.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_TownCentreFootfallFinalReportOct2006.doc] </ref>. The shopping mall currently contains over 100 shops as well as a variety of cafes, the town's central library, the [http://www.rotheshalls.org.uk/ Rothes Halls] - the town's theatre and a ten pin bowling alley (Cowling 1997). The town's main bus station is located adjacent to the southeast end of the mall.

The shopping centre opened in 1963 and has developed with the growth of the town, being built in four main phases:

*Phase 1- Lyon Square 1963 
*Phase 2- Falkland Square 1976 
*Phase 3- Unicorn Square 1982 
*Phase 4- Rothes Square 1993 
[[Image:Ex Terra.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Ex Terra Sculpture, Glenrothes Town Centre]]

Shopping in Glenrothes is to be significantly enhanced in the near future with major expansion of the Kingdom Centre proposed at North Street. A [[Sainsbury's]] superstore (one of the largest stores proposed in Scotland) along with non-food shopping and a new multi-storey car park are proposed as part of the development <ref>Purnell, Fiona (2007) [http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/glenrothes-gazette-news?articleid=3058540 Shops plan - first look] ''Glenrothes Gazette'', 2007-07-25.

A variety of other premises including a bingo hall, a night club, offices, pubs, bars, restaurants, churches, a hotel, a post office, a vet, dentists, banks and building societies surround the outside of the Kingdom Centre.

The town centre has also been extended at Queensway where retail and leisure outlets have been developed, replacing what was once industry. Land to the north of Queensway is to be developed into a new shopping park which is to be anchored by [[ASDA]]. <ref>MacDonald Estates website ''Glenrothes- Tullis Russell Joint   Venture''[http://www.macdonaldestates.co.uk/index.php?sn=op&ssn=pr]</ref> <ref>Glenrothes Gazette (2007) ''Shopping Revolution in Glenrothes''[http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/glenrothes-gazette-news?articleid=3004366]</ref>.

Landmarks in Glenrothes vary from buildings and bridges to hills, sculptures, churches and henges. The most prominant landmarks in the town include the Leven Bridge which towers over Riverside Park and Raeburn Heights and Fife House which both sit at the western corners of the town centre. These are the most recognisable tall structures in Glenrothes which can be seen from quite a distance. 
[[Image:Riverside Park.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The River Leven Bridge towering over Riverside Park]]
The [[Lomond Hills]] form a natural backdrop to the town when looking north and can be seen from as far away as Edinburgh and the Lothians in the south, and Tayside in the north.

Glenrothes is home to the remains of ancient [[stone circles]] which can be seen at [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/403 Balbirnie] and [[Balfarg]] in the northeast of the town.

As already mentioned Glenrothes is home to a large number of artworks and sculptures, and a number of these act as landmarks at major gateways into the town, such as the Giant Irises at Leslie Roundabout, and the Glenrothes Gateway Totum at Bankhead Roundabout.
[[Image:Giant_Irises_Glenrothes.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Giant Irises, Leslie Roundabout]]
St. Columba's Church, designed by architects Wheeler & Sproson, is an A-listed structure of architectural significance. It also marks an important gateway to the town centre at St. Columba's Roundabout.

Two other gateway landmarks, located just outside Glenrothes, are also worthy of mention. The B-listed Markinch Railway Viaduct marks the town gateway from Levenmouth in the east. This structure spans the River Leven Valley carrying the main East Coast rail line. 

To the west of Glenrothes is the B-listed Cabbagehall Railway Viaduct, which once carried a branch line connecting Leslie to Markinch over the River Leven Valley. This marks a main gateway entrance to Glenrothes from Leslie and now carries a major cycle/footpath, Böblingen Way, connecting Leslie with Glenrothes.
