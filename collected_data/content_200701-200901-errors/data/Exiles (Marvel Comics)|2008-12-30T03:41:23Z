The '''Exiles''' are a group of [[fictional characters]] that feature in two [[Marvel Comics]] series, ''Exiles'' and ''New Exiles''. The Exiles consists of characters from different dimensions, or realities, which have been removed from time and space in order to correct problems (often called “hiccups") in various alternate worlds and divergent timelines in the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel Multiverse]].

Created by writer [[Judd Winick]] and artist [[Mike McKone]], Exiles features a revolving team roster with new characters introduced and others replaced when they are killed or returned to his or her home reality. The series is notable for the number of characters who stay dead, in contrast to the [[Comic book death|frequent resurrections]] that occur in the main [[Marvel Universe|Marvel]] and [[DC Universe|DC]] continuities. It often features familiar characters or settings from previous Marvel storylines such as the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' and the ''[[House of M]]''. 

The first volume of Exiles ran for 100 issues after a cross over with the members of Excalibur in ''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' and the One-Shot ''Exiles: Days of then and Now''. '''New Exiles''' began in March 2008 with Chris Claremont and artist Tom Grummett at the helm. ''New Exiles'' #1 Sold out prompting Marvel to release ''New Exiles'' #0 which collected ''Exiles'' #100 and ''Exiles: Days of then and Now''.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12607 "New Exiles" #2 sells out, second printing announced] (press release), [[Comic Book Resources]], February 20, 2008</ref>

==Publication history==
{{Expand |date=December 2008}}
Exiles was created by Judd Winick and artist Mike McKone. Chuck Austen came aboard as interim writer when Winick went to work for DC. Chris Claremont has had significant wring duties on the title and helmed New Exiles. Kev Walker, Clayton Henry and others have penciled the series.

==Fictional team biography==
{{main|List of Exiles characters}}
The Exiles team originally consisted of [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] (Clarice Ferguson, from the Age of Apocalypse, [[Mimic (comics)#Exiles|Mimic]] (Calvin Rankin), Magnus (son of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]), [[Thunderbird (comics)#Exiles|Thunderbird]] (John Proudstar), [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]] (Talia Josephine "T.J." Wagner, daughter of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Scarlet Witch]]), and [[Kevin Sydney#Exiles|Morph]]. The team has since gone through a multitude of line-ups with Morph remaining the only original Exile.

===The Tallus===

Initially the the Exiles are employed by the [[Timebroker]] to fix broken realities. The Tallus is a communications device, which is worn by the leader of the group in order to communicate with the Timebroker. Through it he would assign missions to the team and inform them of any changes, etc. Blink wears the Tallus in the beginning, but it is later transferred to Sabretooth when Blink rebels against the Timebroker (later revealed to be Hyperion). Mimic also wears the Tallus for a time in Blink's absence. It is now used as a means of communication between its wearer and whoever is operating the crystal palace on various missions. It has a slightly different appearance for each wearer. It should be noted that for the first time ever, Sabertooth has used the Tallus to transport himself back to the Crystal Palace, without anyone on the other side recalling him.

===Exiles===

When Magnus dies,<ref>''Exiles'' #2</ref> he is replaced by [[Mariko Yashida#Exiles|Sunfire]] (Mariko Yashida). [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Sasquatch]] (Heather Hudson) arrives when [[Thunderbird (comics)#Exiles|Thunderbird]] becomes comatose during a battle with the world-eating [[Galactus]].<ref>''Exiles'' #10</ref>

The Exiles then discover there is a second team conscripted by the Timebroker, [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]],<ref>''Exiles'' #12</ref> whose missions typically involve killing or maiming innocents and heroes. The two teams join forces to rescue a group of children from a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] prison camp. However, the teams are told the second stage of the mission is to kill one of the children - David Richards (son of [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Franklin Richards]]) - who will apparently grow up to become a powerful supervillain. Weapon X is willing to kill him, but the Exiles are not and the two teams fight until the Timebroker intervenes. Sabretooth (of the Weapon X team) agrees to stay behind and raise David Richards himself.

The Timebroker sends Blink home after a visit to a world plagued by a variant of the [[Legacy Virus]], since the team had repaired her personal broken chain in time<ref>''Exiles'' #22</ref> and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] (Illyana Rasputin) takes her place. Mimic then replaces Blink as leader, gaining the Tallus.

The Exiles arrive in the main [[Marvel Universe]] ([[Earth-616]]) where they meet the [[X-Men]] after [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]'s canceled wedding.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #425-426</ref> The Exiles team up with the X-Men against an evil Havok from the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' universe, who shares a body with the good Havok. After Havok is subdued, the Timebroker arrives to personally eliminate the ''Mutant X'' Havok's consciousness.<ref>''Exiles'' #28-30</ref>

After Sunfire is killed by a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]-infected Mimic,<ref name="Exiles #37">''Exiles'' #37</ref> she is replaced by the Exiles' former teammate Blink. During the next mission,<ref>''Exiles'' #43</ref> the Exiles and Weapon X are forced to battle each other until only six remain alive. Magik is killed by Hyperion when she attempts to switch sides and betray the Exiles. Hyperion is eventually defeated by Blink, who teleports his own heat vision into his back, paralyzing him. [[Alternate versions of Gambit#Exiles/Weapon X|Gambit]] (of Weapon X) is allowed to deliver the killing blow against Hyperion with Magik's sword, which actually kills them both, leaving five Exiles alive and their mission complete.

The Exiles visit the main Marvel Universe for a second time<ref>''Exiles'' #46-48</ref> where they are joined by [[Namora]], who replaces Magik, and are instructed to "leave their possessions and earn their wings". Reed Richards deduces this means they are to leave [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]] behind (whose power involves [[List of comic book superpowers#possession|possession]]) and have [[Beak (comics)|Beak]] join the Exiles, which is confirmed by the Timebroker.

===The Timebrokers===
The team are told by [[Celestial (comics)|The Celestials]] to "beware the Timebroker, he is not what he seems".<ref>''Exiles'' #53</ref> After this, the Timebroker's behavior becomes increasingly strange. Heather Hudson is removed from the team<ref>''Exiles'' #59</ref> without explanation and replaced with former [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]] member [[Sabretooth (comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles|Sabretooth]]. The Tallus orders the Exiles to kill Mimic and despite their refusal, they are allowed to move onto a new mission (normally a mission ''must'' be completed for the Exiles to move on). Next, the Timebroker replaces Beak with [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]],<ref>''Exiles'' #60</ref> which they are informed is a punishment for disobeying previous orders.

Eventually, the Exiles break free of the Timebroker and stage a raid on Panoptichron (also known as the "Crystal Palace"), home of the Timebroker and a location from which many parallel universes can be monitored. Here they discover that the Timebroker is an alien race of bug-like beings that found the Panoptichron and accidentally broke a series of timelines. Lacking the power to repair the timelines, they concocted this scheme of recruiting heroes from various worlds to do their work for them. Not only that, all previously "returned" heroes are actually in Panoptichron, frozen in blocks, along with the killed heroes. As a final twist, the evil Hyperion has broken free of his prison and has taken over Panoptichron. The Exiles defeat Hyperion, but at the cost of Namora and Holocaust's lives. Beak returns from stasis and saved the day by calling on two good versions of Hyperion for help, fulfilling his destiny as an Exile. Only Blink, Mimic, Morph, Sabretooth, Beak, and Heather Hudson remain to pick up the pieces.<ref>''Exiles'' #62-65</ref>

===World Tour===
The Exiles then return to [[Earth-616]] to take Beak home. Unfortunately, Earth-616 is dominated by the [[House of M]]. During their stay, the Exiles run afoul of the body-hopping serial killer [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]], who steals data from the Panoptichron and escapes from [[Earth-616]], leaving Beak [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]] back home.<ref>''Exiles'' #69-71</ref> The Exiles chase Proteus through several realities, including an alternate version of [[New Universe]],<ref>''Exiles'' #72-74</ref> an alternate version of [[Marvel 2099|2099]],<ref>''Exiles'' #75-76</ref> [[Squadron Supreme]],<ref>''Exiles'' #77-78</ref> [[Maestro (Marvel Comics)|Future Imperfect]],<ref>''Exiles'' #79-80</ref> and [[Heroes Reborn]],<ref>''Exiles'' #81-82</ref> before finally bringing Proteus down by trapping him in Morph’s body, which does not decay, unlike all of Proteus’s other host bodies. During the “World Tour” of hunting down Proteus, Mimic is possessed by Proteus and dies, forcing the Exiles to pick up new members [[Longshot]], [[Spider-Man 2099]], and [[Power Princess]] to restore their diminished numbers.

===Post-World Tour===
The Exiles begin cleaning out the stasis gallery of former Exiles and Weapon X members and send them back home. [[Iron Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] are sent back to their respective realities alive, while every other Earth with a missing superhuman holds a funeral. Blink, at the suggestion of [[Power Princess]], takes Mimic home to be buried with his X-Men instead of burying him in Panoptichron. [[Spider-Man]], Sabretooth, and Heather Hudson all decided to visit their home realities.<ref>''Exiles'' #83</ref> Unfortunately, the Timebreakers ditch the Exiles when the Timebreakers believe that they are not saving realities as they should be. However, after using several squads of Wolverines to complete the next mission and failing, Logan (from [[Days of Future Past]]) and young James Howlett convince the Timebreakers that the Exiles are needed.<ref>''Exiles'' #84-85</ref> The Exiles finally resume their reality-saving missions for the first time since they discovered Panoptichron when they save a reality where the [[Silver Surfer]] has already destroyed the Earth and is trying to destroy [[Galactus]], who is the restorer of worlds in this reality.<ref>''Exiles'' #86-87</ref>

Then, Heather discovers an Earth inhabited by a disturbingly close approximation of the original Exiles team, complete with their own Timebroker. After the "classic Exiles" fight "the all-new Exiles" (as Morph put it), it is later revealed that the whole thing was a scheme orchestrated by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], who seeks revenge on the Exiles for freeing [[Professor X]] on their first mission and ruining a bet. The Exiles, past and present, join forces with the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] of that Earth to defeat the Grandmaster. The current team then leaves the Earth in the hands of the approximation Exiles.

The Exiles then take three weeks to save a chain of cracked realities, injuring Blink, Morph, and [[Spider-Man]]. They also discover that Proteus is possibly immune to metal while in Morph’s body. Meanwhile, former Exile, [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], is in the stasis gallery, dreaming of what might have been had he not become comatose.

===Enter Psylocke===
Later, [[Power Princess]] leaves the team to return to the [[Squadron Supreme]] and [[Psylocke]] is brought on board to replace her.<ref>''Exiles'' #89</ref> Blink, Longshot, and Spider-Man are brainwashed by Hydra leaving only Sabretooth to pick up Morph and Psylocke. They are sent to kill Reed Richards. [[Slaymaster]]'s arrival makes them fail as Betsy faints before killing Reed. The world was erased, with the Exiles still there, but it was magically restored by Reed Richards, and [[Valeria Richards]]' amulet restores the world's population because they were being stored in the amulet. The Exiles are still there so they can help Psylocke recover from wounds inflicted by Wolverine, and to help rebuild the planet.<ref>''Exiles'' #93</ref> Meanwhile, another Slaymaster slays another Psylocke on another world.

After the Exiles return to Panoptichron, they find it empty, with no equipment, Timebreakers, or Heather. Blink and Morph eventually visit Heather, who thought the Exiles were dead and left Panoptichron. Heather is now pregnant and out of commission, so [[Psylocke]] stays behind to learn more about the Panoptichron while the other Exiles resume their missions. There she experiences visions which warn her of something bad to come, and an alternate version of [[Kitty Pryde]] appears from nowhere with no warning. The Exiles go to a seemingly perfect world led by [[Doctor Doom|Victor Von Doom]] but when Blink is caught by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] she begins to discover what hides behind this facade.<ref>''Exiles'' #96</ref> She then recruits Longshot and Morph, who also sense something amiss with this world. They flee with that world's Reed to begin a resistance. Meanwhile, [[Spider-Man 2099]] meets [[Gwen Stacy]] and Sabretooth has a [[one-night stand]] with this world's [[Invisible Woman]]. In reality, she was assigned to get close to him so Doom could copy the Tallus, which he does. He then sends a team of soldiers to Panoptichron. They take out [[Psylocke]] and assume [[Kitty Pryde]] is a freaked out child, though she appears to be faking that. Then the soldiers are attacked by [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], who is no longer comatose.<ref>''Exiles'' #97</ref> [[Kitty Pryde]] (who goes by [[Alternate versions of Kitty Pryde#Exiles|Cat]]), uses her phasing powers to make a diversion long enough to allow Thunderbird to free [[Psylocke]]. Together, they defeat the soldiers and send them home, just in time for them to see Doom's defeat, whose Earth is destroyed by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] as there is no way to turn the humans back to their normal emotional state.

As a result the Exiles are scattered to various dimensions,<ref>''Exiles'' #98</ref> much like [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] had done previously.<ref>''Exiles'' #32-34</ref> [[Psylocke]], [[Thunderbird (comics)#Exiles|Thunderbird]], and Cat are able to work on the equipment and retrieve Blink, Morph, and Sabretooth, and new members [[Mystique (comics)#Exiles|Mystiq]] and [[Rogue (comics)#Exiles|Rogue]] are brought along. [[Spider-Man 2099]] finds a girlfriend and stays on the world he landed in. Longshot, once again, got lucky and landed in the Crystal Palace after the transport went wrong.

===''Die by the Sword''===
{{seealso|X-Men: Die by the Sword}}
[[Psylocke]] and [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]] traveled to Earth-616 to visit [[Captain Britain]] and [[Nocturne]] during [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005-2007)|New Excalibur]]'s victory party.<ref>''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' #1</ref> During the party, [[Captain Britain]] is wounded by a strike force led by an armored lady called Rouge. While Betsy tries to care for her brother everybody else tries to fight, even [[Dazzler]] and [[Pete Wisdom]] who were about to have sex, but, realizing they can't win they teleport to the Panoptichron. There, Dazzler discovers that Longshot, while alive, doesn't remember her and is about to kill herself to ease her pain when Mystiq comes to talk her out of it. TJ happily reunites with her former teammates while [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] is deemed the best option to care for Brian. Meanwhile Cat, using the scanner, realizes that [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] and [[Saturnyne]] are in trouble.<ref>''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' #2</ref> The Corps then suffers a lot of losses, despite Saturnyne's intervening. While Cat checks on Brian, Blink, Morph, Sabertooth, Thunderbird, and Dazzler join the battle field.<ref>''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' #3</ref> Dazzler battles Rouge-Mort,who has badly wounded Roma, and Longshot gets concerned about her, making both himself and Sage wonder why/how, while Morph battles Jasper by morphing into the Fury but his plan is quickly foiled. Sage, Psylocke, and Wisdom recruit [[Albion (Marvel Comics)|Albion]] to their cause, who proves to be a match for James Jaspers until Jaspers turns into the Fury. Merlyn then comes to his daughter to finish the job<ref>''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' #4</ref> only to be beaten by Psylocke. Cap then makes his move on the Fury and with the help of Blink and Albion vanquishes him for now, leading to Merlyn's defeat. However, this victory comes with a price as Roma dies, though not before transferring her knowledge into Sage's mind. Saturnyn then promises to free Albion from jail to lead the Corps while Sage and TJ switch teams with Longshot who now remembers the highlights of his past.<ref>''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' #5</ref>

The events of Die by the Sword take place between Exiles #99-#100. 

===Exiles #100, ''Days of Then and Now''===
Blink, Nocturne, and Thunderbird decide to leave the team because they are physically and emotionally exhausted and need a break. They leave for Heather Hudson's reality so that Heather can keep track of Nocturne's progress as she continues to recover from her stroke. Sage struggles with her new knowledge gained from Roma and accidentally fights the other Exiles. Cat and Rogue explore the palace and almost die in a bungee-jumping accident, prompting Rogue to reveal flying powers.

Blink discovers an Earth they were supposed to save, but did not because they were chasing Proteus during the World Tour. Iron Man, Nighthawk, Wild Child, and Luke Cage from that reality died because they did not receive help from the Exiles. So, Blink decides to help an alternate [[Quentin Quire]] by acting as the Timebroker through [[Alternate versions of Gambit#Exiles/Weapon X|Gambit]]'s old Tallus, which is given to him by the [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] from the reality where the Exiles had battled [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]] after Quentin is able to transport himself there on his own. Then, he meets [[Alternate versions of Mary Jane Watson#Exiles|Mary Jane]] and [[Luke Cage#Exiles|Luke Cage]], from the [[Phalanx (comics)#Exiles|Vi-Locks]] reality, and an alternate [[Spitfire (New Universe)|Spitfire]]. Finally, he ends up in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] where he saves [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]]. Blink then sends all five heroes (Luke Cage, Quentin, Nighthawk, Spitfire, and Wild Child) to replace Iron Man, Nighthawk, Wild Child, and Luke Cage from Quentin's reality.

==New Exiles==
The team went to Earth 6706 to recruit Gambit and found themselves in a three-way war between [[Namor]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo]], and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. The team was separated with Rogue with Gambit and Namor, Mystiqe in disguise with the Panther's team, and Sabretooth and Psylocke with Ororo. They eventually reunited for a final fight against the Panther and would have died if not for Psylocke and Gambit's mother's powers. Their mission was eventually revealed to them and they left the Earth despite the fact that the Panther had taken control of it.<ref>New Exiles #1-4</ref> Meanwhile, Morph, Sage, and Cat are sucked into a world were Kitty shifts to another form. Sage regains her telepathic powers, as they defend a man who has fallen in love with a dragon. After some fighting, the parents eventually surrender against true love and the dragon becomes human, while the Exiles are brought back to the Panoptichron, where Cat reveals that Gambit was listed as a member even before he was recruited. In the mean time, [[Invisible Woman#Exiles|Hydra]] recruits a Wolverine-like-guy to her cause.<ref>New Exiles #5-6</ref> Afterwards, Sage, Psylocke, Morph, Mystiq, Rogue, and Gambit help a team of X-Men on another Earth fight off the French during a French and British war. Psylocke receives some training from that world's Ogun. Cat discovers realities upon realities coming to their end and finds she can do nothing to stop it.

New Exiles will be cancelled by Marvel Comics with issue #18 being its final issue in February 2009. <ref name=Cancellation>{{cite web | title = NEW EXILES #18 - Marvel Comics Catalogue: The Official Site | publisher = Marvel Comics | url = http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=11078 | accessdate = 2008-12-05}}</ref>

==Weapon X==
{{main|Weapon X (Exiles)}}
First seen in ''Exiles'' #5, they are a team that complete missions more ruthless than those of the Exiles. This team had various members and its roster changed more than the Exiles. Weapon X was originally composed of [[Sabretooth (comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles|Sabretooth]], [[Garrison Kane#Exiles|Kane]], [[Mesmero#Exiles|Mesmero]], [[Alternate versions of Wolverine#Exiles & Weapon X|Wolverine]], [[David North (comics)#Exiles|Maverick]], and [[Deadpool (comics)#Exiles|Deadpool]]. The team was destroyed during the "A Blink in Time" arc, when the Timebroker wanted to downsize both teams in hopes of killing off the insane [[Hyperion (comics)#Exiles|Hyperion]], who abandoned missions to try to rule worlds.

==Cameo appearences==
