'''IK Pegasi''' (or '''HR 8210''') is a [[binary star]] [[star system|system]] in the [[constellation]] [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]. A distance of about 150&nbsp;[[light year]]s from the [[Solar System]], it is just luminous enough to be seen with the unaided eye.

The primary (IK Pegasi A) is a [[main sequence]], [[spectral class|A-class]] star that displays minor pulsations in [[luminosity]]. It is categorized as a [[Delta Scuti variable]] star and it has a periodic cycle of luminosity variation that repeats itself about 22.9 times per day.<ref name="mnras267" /> Its companion (IK Pegasi B) is a massive [[white dwarf]]—a star that has evolved past the main sequence and is no longer generating energy through [[nuclear fusion]]. They orbit each other every 21.7 days with an average separation of about 31&nbsp;million [[kilometre]]s, or 0.21&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s (AU). This is smaller than the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] around the [[Sun]].

IK Pegasi B is the nearest known [[supernova]] progenitor candidate. When the primary begins to evolve into a [[red giant]], it is expected to grow to a radius where the white dwarf can [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accrete]] matter from the expanded gaseous envelope. When the white dwarf approaches the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] of 1.44&nbsp;[[solar mass]]es, it may explode as a [[Type Ia supernova]].<ref name="mnras262">{{cite journal

This star system was catalogued in the 1862 ''[[Durchmusterung|Bonn Durchmusterung]]'' ("Bonn astrometric Survey") as BD&nbsp;+18°4794B.

Examination of the [[spectrograph]]ic features of this star showed the characteristic [[absorption line]] shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a [[doppler effect|doppler shift]] in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity of at least one of the stars even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.<ref>{{cite web

In 1927, the Canadian astronomer [[William Edmund Harper|William E.

He also initially estimated the [[orbital eccentricity]] as 0.027. (Later estimates gave an eccentricity of essentially zero, which is the value for a circular orbit.)<ref name="mnras262" /> The velocity amplitude was measured as 41.5&nbsp;km/s, which is the maximum velocity of the primary component along the line of sight to the Solar System.<ref>{{cite journal

The distance to the IK Pegasi system can be measured directly by observing the tiny [[parallax]] shifts of this system (against the more distant stellar background) as the [[Earth]] orbits around the Sun.

==Component A==
The [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] (HR diagram) is a plot of [[luminosity]] versus a [[color index]] for a set of stars. IK Pegasi A is currently a [[main sequence]] star&mdash;a term is used to describe a nearly linear grouping of core hydrogen-fusing stars based on their position on the HR diagram. However, IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR diagram that is known as the [[instability strip]]. Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.<ref name="araa33">{{cite journal

The pulsations result from a process called the ''κ''-mechanism. A part of the star's outer [[atmosphere]] becomes [[Optical density|optically thick]] due to partial [[ionization]] of certain elements. When these atoms lose an [[electron]], the likelihood that they will absorb energy increases. This results in an increase in temperature that causes the atmosphere to expand. The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and loses energy, causing it to cool and shrink back down again. The result of this cycle is a periodic pulsation of the atmosphere and a matching variation of the luminosity.<ref name="araa33" />

Stars within the portion of the instability strip that crosses the main sequence are called [[Delta Scuti variable]]s. These are named after the prototypical star for such variables: [[Delta Scuti]]. Delta Scuti variables typically range from [[spectral class]] A2 to F8, and a stellar luminosity class of III ([[subgiant]]s) to V ([[main sequence]] stars). They are short-period variables that have a regular pulsation rate between 0.025 and 0.25&nbsp;days. Delta Scuti stars have an abundance of elements similar to the Sun's (see [[Population I]] stars) and between 1.5 and 2.5&nbsp;[[solar mass]]es.<ref>{{cite web

Astronomers define the [[metallicity]] of a star as the abundance of [[chemical element]]s that have a higher [[atomic number]] than helium. This is measured by a [[spectroscopic]] analysis of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasus A, the estimated metal abundance is [M/H]&nbsp;=&nbsp;+0.07&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.20. This notation gives the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of metal elements (M) to hydrogen (H), minus the logarithm of the Sun's metal ratio. (Thus if the star matches the metal abundance of the Sun, this value will be zero.) A logarithmic value of 0.07 is equivalent to an actual metallicity ratio of 1.17, so the star is about 17% richer in metallic elements than the Sun.<ref name="mnras267" /> However the margin of error for this result is relatively large.

The spectrum of A-class stars such as IK Pegasi A show strong [[Balmer line]]s of hydrogen along with absorption lines of ionized metals, including the K&nbsp;line of ionized [[calcium]] (Ca&nbsp;II) at a wavelength of 393.3&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]].<ref>{{cite web

That is, this star's atmosphere displays slightly (but anomalously) higher than normal absorption line strengths for metallic isotopes.<ref name="apj221" /> Stars of spectral type Am are often members of close binaries with a companion of about the same mass, as is the case for IK Pegasi.<ref>{{cite journal

Spectral class-A stars are hotter and more massive than the Sun. But, in consequence, their life span on the main sequence is correspondingly brief. For a star with a mass similar to IK Pegasi A (1.65 solar), the expected lifetime on the main sequence is 2&ndash;3&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;years, which is about half the current age of the Sun.<ref>{{cite web

In terms of mass, the relatively young [[Altair]] is the nearest star to the Sun that is a stellar analogue of component A&mdash;it has an estimated 1.7 times the [[solar mass]]. The binary system as a whole has some similarities to the nearby system of [[Sirius]], which has a class-A primary and a white dwarf companion. However, Sirius A is more massive than IK Pegasi A and the orbit of its companion is larger, with a semimajor axis of 20&nbsp;A.U.

==Component B==
The companion star is a dense [[white dwarf]] star. This category of stellar object has reached the end of its evolutionary life span and is no longer generating energy through [[nuclear fusion]]. Instead, under normal circumstances, a white dwarf will steadily radiate away its remaining energy, growing cooler and dimmer over the course of many billions of years.<ref>{{cite web

As the hydrogen fuel at the core of the progenitor of IK Pegasi B was consumed, it evolved into a [[red giant]]. The inner core contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium core. To compensate for the temperature increase, the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star. When the core reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a [[horizontal branch]] star. That is, it belonged to a group of stars that fall upon a roughly horizontal line on the H-R diagram. The fusion of helium formed an inert core of carbon and oxygen. When helium was exhausted in the core a helium-burning shell formed in addition to the hydrogen-burning one and the star moved to what astronomers term the [[asymptotic giant branch]], or AGB. (This is a track leading to the upper-right corner of the H-R diagram.)  If the star had sufficient mass, in time [[Carbon burning process|carbon fusion]] could begin in the  core, producing [[oxygen]], [[neon]] and [[magnesium]].<ref name="evolution">{{cite web

Some time after an inert oxygen-carbon (or oxygen-magnesium-neon) core formed, thermonuclear fusion began to occur along two shells concentric with the core region; hydrogen was burned along the outermost shell, while helium fusion took place around the inert core. However, this double-shell phase is unstable, so it produced thermal pulses that caused large-scale mass ejections from the star's outer envelope.<ref>{{cite journal

The massive, compact nature of a white dwarf produces a strong surface gravity. Astronomers denote this value by the decimal [[logarithm]] of the [[gravitational force]] in [[Centimeter gram second system of units|cgs units]], or log ''g''. For IK Pegasi B, log ''g'' is 8.95.<ref name="mnras270" />  By comparison, log ''g'' for the Earth is 2.99. Thus the surface gravity on IK Pegasi is over 900,000 times the gravitational force on the Earth.{{Ref_label|G|g|none}}

The effective surface temperature of IK Pegasi B is estimated to be about 35,500&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;1,500&nbsp;K,<ref name="pasp105" /> making it a strong source of [[ultraviolet]] radiation.<ref name="mnras270" />{{Ref_label|H|h|none}} Under normal conditions this white dwarf would continue to cool for more than a billion years, while its radius would remain essentially unchanged.<ref>{{cite web

==Future evolution==
In a 1993 paper, David Wonnacott,  Barry J. Kellett and David J. Stickland identified this system as a candidate to evolve into a [[Type Ia supernova]] or a [[Cataclysmic variable star|cataclysmic variable]].<ref name="mnras262" /> At a distance of 150&nbsp;light years, this makes it the nearest known candidate supernova progenitor to the [[Earth]]. However in the time it will take for the system to evolve to a state where a supernova could occur, it will have moved a considerable distance from Earth and will pose no threat. A supernova would need to be within about 26&nbsp;light years of the Earth to effectively destroy the Earth's [[ozone layer]], which would severely impact the planet's [[biosphere]].<ref name="apj585">{{cite journal

At some point in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the hydrogen fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the [[Roche lobe]] of its companion, a gaseous [[accretion disk]] will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.<ref>{{cite web

On the surface of the white dwarf, the accreted gas will become compressed and heated. At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a runaway reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) [[nova]] explosion &mdash;a cataclysmic variable star&mdash;and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several [[Apparent magnitude|magnitudes]] for a period of several days or months.<ref>{{cite web

It is possible that IK Pegasi B will follow a similar pattern.<ref name="vsom0501" /> In order to accumulate mass, however, only a portion of the accreted gas can be ejected, so that with each cycle the white dwarf would steadily increase in mass. Thus, even should it behave as a recurring nova, IK Pegasus B could continue to accumulate a growing envelope.<ref>{{cite journal

An alternate model that allows the white dwarf to steadily accumulate mass without erupting as a nova is called the close-binary [[supersoft x-ray source]] (CBSS). In this scenario, the mass transfer rate to the close white dwarf binary is such that a steady fusion burn can be maintained on the surface as the arriving hydrogen is consumed in thermonuclear fusion to produce helium. This category of super-soft sources consist of high-mass white dwarfs with very high surface temperatures (0.5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup> to 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;K<ref>{{cite conference

Should the white dwarf's mass approach the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] of 1.44&nbsp;[[solar mass]]es it will no longer be supported by [[electron degeneracy pressure]] and it will undergo a collapse. For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a [[neutron star]]. In this case, only a fraction of star's mass will be ejected as a result.<ref>{{cite web

Such a supernova event is not likely to pose a threat to life on the Earth, however. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future. As shown previously, the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4&nbsp;km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14,700&nbsp;years. After 5&nbsp;million years, for example, this star will be separated from the Sun by more than 500&nbsp;light years. This is outside the radius where a Type Ia supernova is thought to be hazardous.<ref name="apj585" />

Following a supernova explosion, the remnant of the donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed when it was a member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100&ndash;200 km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the [[Milky Way|galaxy]]. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star.<ref>{{cite journal
