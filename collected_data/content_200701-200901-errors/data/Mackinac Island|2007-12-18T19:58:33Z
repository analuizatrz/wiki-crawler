'''Mackinac Island''' ({{pronEng|ˈmækɨnɔː}} ''MACK-in-aw'') is an island covering 3.8&nbsp;square miles (9.8&nbsp;km²) in land area, belonging to the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. It is located in [[Lake Huron]], at the eastern end of the [[Straits of Mackinac]], between the state's [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper]] and [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsulas]].<ref name="HistplacesPDF"/> The island was home to a Native American settlement before European exploration began in the 17th century. It served a strategic position amidst the commerce of the [[Great Lakes]] [[fur trade]]. This led to the establishment of [[Fort Mackinac]] on the island by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. It was the scene of two battles during the [[War of 1812]].<ref name="High Cliffs"/>

In the late 19th century, Mackinac Island became a popular tourist attraction and [[summer colony]]. Much of the island has undergone extensive historical preservation and restoration; as a result, the entire island is listed as a [[National Historic Landmark]]. It is well known for its numerous cultural events; its wide variety of architectural styles, including the famous [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]]; and its ban on almost all motor vehicles. More than 80&nbsp;percent of the island is preserved as [[Mackinac Island State Park]].<ref name="Historic Treasure"/>

==History==
[[Image:British-Landing-Plaque.jpg|thumb|Historical Marker at British Landing]]
Archaeologists have excavated prehistoric fishing camps on Mackinac Island and in the surrounding areas. Fishhooks, pottery, and other artifacts establish a Native American presence at least 700 years before European exploration, around 900 AD. The island is a sacred place in the tradition of some of its earliest known inhabitants, the [[Anishinaabe]] ([[Ojibwa]]) tribes, who consider it to be home to the [[Gitche Manitou]], or the "Great Spirit".<ref name=".orgHistory"/> According to legend, Mackinac Island was created by the Great Hare, [[Michabou]] and was the first land to appear after the recession of the [[Deluge (prehistoric)|Great Flood]].<ref>{{cite web  | last =Zacharias 
  | first =Pat  | title =The breathtaking Mackinac Bridge  | work =Detroit News  | url =http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=156&category=locations  | accessdate =2007-07-18  }}</ref> The island was a gathering place for the local tribes where their offerings were made to Gitche Manitou and was where tribal chiefs were buried. 

The first European likely to have seen Mackinac Island is [[Jean Nicolet]], a French-Canadian [[coureur de bois]], during his 1634 explorations. The Jesuit priest [[Claude Dablon]] founded a mission for the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on Mackinac Island in 1670, and stayed over the winter of 1670-71.  Dablon's fall 1671 successor, the missionary and explorer [[Jacques Marquette]], moved the mission to St. Ignace soon after his arrival.<ref name="Hamilton">{{cite book  | last =Hamilton  | first =Raphael N., S.J  | title =Father Marquette  | publisher =William B.

Anne's Church  | date =1996  | location =Mackinac Island  | pages =14-15}}</ref> With the mission as a focus, the Straits of Mackinac quickly became an important French fur trading location. The British took control of the Straits of Mackinac after the [[French and Indian War]] and Major [[Patrick Sinclair]] chose the bluffs of the island for [[Fort Mackinac]] in 1780.<ref name="High Cliffs">{{cite web

Although the British built Fort Mackinac to protect their settlement from attack by Americans and native tribes, the fort was never attacked during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the entire Straits area was officially acquired by the United States through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783. However, much of the British forces did not leave the Great Lakes area until after [[Jay's Treaty]] established U.S. sovereignty over the entire [[Northwest Territory]] in 1794.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brinkley |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Brinkley   |title=American History: A Survey |date=2003|edition=11  |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |location=New York |isbn=0-07-242436-2 |pages=141, 173}}</ref>
During the [[War of 1812]], the British captured the fort in the first [[Battle of Mackinac Island (1812)|battle]] of the conflict because the Americans had not yet heard that war had been declared. The victorious British attempted to protect their prize by building Fort George on the [[high ground]] behind Fort Mackinac. In 1814, the Americans and British fought a second [[Battle of Mackinac Island|battle]] on the north side of the island. The American second-in-command, Major [[Andrew Holmes|Andrew Hunter Holmes]], was killed and the Americans failed to recapture the island.  

Despite this outcome, the [[Treaty of Ghent]] forced the British to return the island and surrounding mainland to the U.S. in 1815. The United States reoccupied Fort Mackinac, and renamed Fort George ''Fort Holmes'', after Major Holmes.<ref name="High Cliffs"/><ref name="Holmes">{{cite web  | last =Brennan  | first =James  | title =Fort Holmes  | publisher = The Michigan Historical Marker Web Site   | url = http://www.michmarkers.com/startup.asp?startpage=S0078.htm  | accessdate =2007-03-04}}</ref> Fort Mackinac remained under the control of the United States government until 1895 and provided volunteers to defend the Union during the [[American Civil War]]. The fort even served as a prison for three [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers.<ref name=".orgHistory"/>

[[John Jacob Astor]]'s [[American Fur Company]] was centered on Mackinac Island after the War of [[1812]] and exported [[beaver]] pelts for thirty years. By the middle of the 19th century, [[commercial fishing]] for [[Common whitefish|whitefish]] and [[lake trout]] began to replace the fur trade as the island's primary industry. As [[sport fishing]] became more popular in the 1880s, hotels and restaurants accommodated tourists coming by train or lake boat from [[Detroit]] and similar cities.<ref name="High Cliffs"/>  

Following the Civil War, the island became a popular tourist destination for residents of cities on the Great Lakes. Much of the federal land on Mackinac Island was designated as [[Mackinac National Park]] in [[1875]], just three years after [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] was designated as the first national park. To accommodate an influx of tourists in the 1880s, the boat and railroad companies built hotels, including the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]]. Souvenir shops began to spring up as a way for island residents to profit from the tourists. Many wealthy [[industrialist]]s built summer [[cottage]]s along the island's bluffs for extended stays. When the federal government left the island in 1895, all of the federal land, including Fort Mackinac, was given to the state of Michigan and became Michigan's first state park. The Mackinac Island State Park Commission appointed to oversee the island has limited private development in the park and requires leaseholders to maintain the island's distinctive Victorian architecture.<ref name="Historic Treasure">{{cite web

===Etymology===
Like many historic places in the Great Lakes region, Mackinac Island's name derives from a Native American language. Native Americans in the Straits of Mackinac region likened the shape of the island to that of a turtle. Therefore, they named it "Mitchimakinak" ([[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwe]] ''mishi-mikinaak'')<ref>Nichols, John D. and Nyholm, Earl (1995). ''A Concise Dictionary of Minnesota Ojibwe''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press</ref> meaning "big turtle". The French used a version of the original pronunciation: [[Michilimackinac]]. However, the English shortened it to the present name: "Mackinac."<ref>{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=Mackinaw |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Mackinaw |accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Ferjutz |first=Kelly |title=Broadcloth, Brocade and Buckskin -- Return to the past on Mackinac Island |publisher=FrugalFun.com |url=http://www.frugalfun.com/mackinack.html |accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref>

Every summer, Mackinac Island accommodates at least 50 Michigan [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] and [[Scouting in Michigan|Girl Scouts]] over alternate weeks. The program began in 1929, when the State Park Commission invited eight [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]s, including young [[Gerald Ford]], to serve as [[honor guard]]s for the Michigan governor. In 1974, the program was expanded to include Girl Scouts. The program is popular and selective.

==Ecology==
Mackinac Island contains a wide variety of terrain, including fields, marshes, bogs, coastline, [[boreal forest]], and limestone formations. The environment is legally preserved on the island by the State Historic Park designation. About half of the shoreline and adjacent waters off Mackinac Island, including the harbor (Haldimand Bay) and the southern and western shore from Mission Point to Pointe aux Pins, is protected as part of the [[Straits of Mackinac Shipwreck Preserve]], a state [[marine park]].<ref>{{cite news

As it is separated from the mainland by 3<!--statue-->&nbsp;miles (4.8&nbsp;km) of water, few [[mammal]]s inhabit the island, except those that traverse the ice during the winter months. [[Bat]]s are the most abundant mammals as crossing the water is no obstacle for them. There are many limestone caves serving as homes for the bats and many insects on the island for the bat to prey on. The island is frequented by migratory birds on their trips between their summer and winter habitats. [[Eagle]]s and [[hawk]]s are abundant in April and May, while smaller birds such as [[Yellow Warbler]]s, [[American Redstart]], and [[Indigo Bunting]] are more common in early summer. Near the shoreline, [[gulls]], [[herons]], [[geese]], and [[loon]]s are common. Owls, including [[Snowy Owl]]s and [[Great Grey Owl]]s, come to the island from the Arctic to hunt in the warmer climate. Other birds, such as [[Paridae|chickadee]]s, [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinal]]s, [[Blue Jay]]s, and [[woodpecker]]s, live on the island year-round. [[Toads]] have also been found. <ref name="ecology">{{cite web

Mackinac Island contains over 600 species of [[vascular plants]]. Flowering plants and wildflowers are abundant, including [[Trillium]], [[Trout Lily]], [[Spring Beauty]], [[Hepatica]], [[Buttercups]], and [[Hawkweeds]] in the forests and [[Orchids]], [[Fringed Gentian]] and [[Jack-in-the-Pulpit]] along the shoreline. The island's forests are home to many varieties of trees, such as [[maple]], [[birch]], [[elm]], [[cedar]], [[pine]], and [[spruce]].<ref name="ecology"/>

==Geology==

Mackinac Island was formed as the glaciers of the last [[Wisconsin glaciation|ice age]] began to melt around 13,000 BC. The bedrock strata that underlie the island are much older, dating to Late [[Silurian]] and Early [[Devonian]] time, about 400 to 420 million years ago. Subsurface deposits of [[halite]] (rock salt) dissolved, allowing the collapse of overlying limestones; these once-broken but now solidified rocks comprise the Mackinac [[Breccia]].

The melting glaciers formed the Great Lakes, and the receding lakewaters eroded the [[limestone]] bedrock, forming the island's steep cliffs and rock formations. At least three previous lake levels are known, two of them higher than the present shore: Algonquin lakeshores date to about 10,000 years ago, and the Nipissing shorelines formed about 12,000 years ago.<ref name="Shorelines">{{cite web  | title = Geology and Glacial Lake Shoreline Features of Mackinac Island   | publisher =American Institute of Professional Geologists   | url = http://www.mi.aipg.org/2007%20Ann%20Mtg/2007Conference-Field%20Trips.html  | accessdate =2007-05-18  }}</ref> During an intermediate period of low water between these two high-water stages, the Straits of Mackinac shrank to a narrow gorge which discharged its water into Lake Huron through [[Mackinac Falls]], located just east of Mackinac Island.<ref name="Waterfall">{{cite web  | title = Ancient Waterfall Discovered Off Mackinac Island's Shoreline  | publisher = [[Mackinac Island Town Crier]]  | url = http://www.mackinacislandnews.com/news/2007/0825/Front_page/003.html| accessdate = 2007-09-10  }}</ref>

As the Great Lakes assumed their present levels, Mackinac Island took on its current size.<ref name="HistplacesPDF"/> The steep cliffs were one of the primary reasons for the British army's choice of the island for a fortification; their decision differed from that of the French army, which had built [[Fort Michilimackinac]] about 1715 near present-day [[Mackinaw City]]. The limestone formations are still part of the island's appeal. However, tourists are attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is [[Arch Rock (Mackinac Island)|Arch Rock]], a natural limestone arch, nearly 150&nbsp;feet (45&nbsp;m) above the ground.<ref name="High Cliffs"/><ref>{{cite web  | title = Arch Rock on Mackinac Island, MI  | publisher = Vacations Made Easy  | url = http://www.vacationsmadeeasy.com/MackinacIslandAreaMI/pointsOfInterest/ArchRockonMackinacIslandMI.cfm  | accessdate =2007-03-11  }}</ref> Other popular geologic formations include [[Sugar Loaf (Mackinac Island)|Sugar Loaf]] and Skull Cave.<ref name="Historic Treasure"/>
