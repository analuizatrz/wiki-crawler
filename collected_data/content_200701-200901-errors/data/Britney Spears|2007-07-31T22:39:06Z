[[Stylus Magazine]] gave the album a D and even blamed her career choices saying, "Ultimately, In the Zone suffers greatly from Britney's uneasy transition from teen tart to sexually powerful woman.

In [[July]] [[2007]], Spears appeared for a photography and interview session with OK! Magazine but appeared disoriented with erratic behavior, taking numerous bathroom breaks and wiping food on her expensive wardrobe, making it impossible for interviewers to start a coherent conversation. Spears ultimately aborted the attempted interview after only two hours. Representatives for OK! Magazine called the Spears encounter "heartbreaking" and "an emotional cry for help." <ref>http://www.tmz.com/2007/07/23/britneys-disastrous-photo-shoot/</ref>

==Movies and television==
Spears attended NYC's [[Professional Performing Arts School]] for three summers when she was eight years old and performed in 1991's ''Ruthless!'' and other [[off-Broadway]] productions. When she was eleven, she joined the ''[[The New Mickey Mouse Club]]'' where she was featured from 1991–93. In the show she appeared in various [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] and musical videos which mostly displayed her comedic and singing abilities.<ref name=britneyearlyyears/><ref name=mickemc/>

Spears had her first starring role in the 2002 film, ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' where she played Lucy, a Louisiana high school graduate who decides she wants to find her long-lost mother in Arizona, and takes along her two friends who wish to visit California. The movie, along with Spears's performance in it, was poorly received by critics who mostly saw it as an advertisement for Britney's music and endorsments.<ref>{{cite web | author=Rotten Tomatoes | title=''Crossroads'' Reviews | publisher=rottentomatoes.com | year=2006 | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1112549-crossroads/ | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> ''Crossroads'' still managed to debut at number two on the [[box-office]] charts in its first weekend.
