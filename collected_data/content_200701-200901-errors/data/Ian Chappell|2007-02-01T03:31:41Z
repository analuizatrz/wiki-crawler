'''Ian Michael Chappell''' (born [[September 26]], [[1943]] in [[Unley, South Australia]]) is a former [[Australia]]n [[cricket]] player. He is a grandson of the famous [[Vic Richardson|Victor Richardson]] (after whom the main gates at the [[Adelaide Oval]] are named) and the eldest of three brothers, the others being [[Greg Chappell|Greg]] and [[Trevor Chappell|Trevor]].

Ian Chappell was on the board of directors for Com Tech (later Dimension Data Australia) for several years, a successful marketing exercise for the company.

After retirement from International and first class cricket Ian became a commentator. Australians hear him most often on [[Channel Nine]] during the International cricket telecasts. He also hosted the show [[Nine's Wide World of Sport|Wide World of Sports]] with [[Mike Gibson (broadcaster)|Mike Gibson]] during the 1980s (and was subsequently parodied by [[The Twelfth Man|The 12th Man]]).

As for his cricket he is widely regarded as one of the most successful captains of the Australian Test team, with the team never losing a series during his captaincy. He is considered instrumental in the formation of the Kerry Packer endorsed World Series Cricket in the [[1970s]]. Along with his brother Greg he was part of, and led, one of the most successful teams to grace the field. Though not many would agree that "grace" correctly describes the way they handled themselves, although Chappell himself strongly refutes the way the media labelled his sides "Ugly Australians".

Retiring from International cricket in [[1980]], Ian played 75 Tests and only 16 One-day Internationals. Debuting in [[1964]], his career spanned 17 years. He was named as one of the Wisden cricketers of the year in [[1976]] and inducted into the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]] in 2003.

Ian attended the prestigious South Australian Private School, [[Prince Alfred College]].
