'''Saku Antero Koivu''' (born [[November 23]], [[1974]] in [[Turku]], [[Finland]]) is a [[professional]] [[ice hockey]] player, and plays centre for the [[Montreal Canadiens]] as the [[Montreal Canadiens#Team Captains|current team captain]].

==Playing career==
===SM-liiga and NHL===
Koivu started his professional ice hockey career playing for [[TPS (ice hockey)|TPS]] in the Finnish [[SM-liiga]], in the [[1992]]&ndash;[[1993]] season. He spent three seasons with TPS, winning two Finnish championships with the team in [[1992]] and 1995, and being elected [[Kultainen kypärä|Player of the Year]] by his fellow players in the [[1994]]&ndash;[[1995]] season. He was drafted by the [[Montreal Canadiens|Canadiens]] in the [[1993 NHL Entry Draft]] as their first-round selection (21st overall), and moved to [[North America]] for the [[1995-96 NHL season|1995-96 season]].

Koivu was made leader or captain of the Canadiens in the [[1999-00 NHL season|99-00 season]] and has held the position ever since.  After six seasons in the NHL.  Koivu was diagnosed with [[Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] in September 2001 and missed practically the entire [[2001-02 NHL season]]. He made an amazing recovery and was able to return for the playoffs, leading the Canadiens to an unlikely first-round upset of the number one-ranked [[Boston Bruins]]. For his courage and off-ice team leadership while undergoing cancer treatment, he was awarded the [[Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy]] following the 2002 playoffs.  He followed up in the [[2002-03 NHL season]] by scoring his career best single-season point total with 71 (21 goals, 50 assists).

During the [[2004-05 NHL lockout]], Koivu returned to Finland to play for TPS, whose head coach at the time was his father, [[Jukka Koivu]]. He was joined in Turku by fellow Montreal Canadien, and close friend, [[Craig Rivet]]. 

The [[2005-06 NHL season]] was Koivu's sixth season as the Canadiens captain. His continued tenure seems to have ended a supposed curse of Habs captains. During a ten-year span from 1989 to 1999, six captains were traded away.

The 2006-07 NHL season has been good for Saku Koivu. In a game on January 9, 2007, in which the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Atlanta Thrashers 4-2, he registered his 500th NHL point. With 2:47 remaining, Koivu fed Michael Ryder with a pass across the slot for a power-play goal. Koivu received a standing ovation from the sellout crowd of 21,273 in Montreal.

Koivu remains a close friend of [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] forward [[Mark Recchi]], who was once a Canadien and a teammate of Koivu's before Recchi was traded to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].

===Eye injury===

On [[April 26]], 2006, during a home playoff game against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], Koivu sustained a serious injury to his left eye. Hurricanes forward [[Justin Williams]] attempted to lift Koivu's stick and struck him in the eye. "The Canadiens were dumbfounded to learn that no penalty was called as officials failed to witness the play."[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/stanleycup2006/storyview.html?/story/stanleycup2006/national/2006/04/27/Sports/koivu-eye-injury060427.html]. Koivu was rushed to the hospital where he would remain overnight and for the remainder of the playoffs. Without Koivu, the Montreal Canadiens went on to lose the series and their chances at a Stanley Cup championship. Williams, as a teammate of [[Mark Recchi]] (who played alongside Koivu as a Canadien), attempted to contact Koivu to apologize personally, but was only able to leave him a message on his cell phone.[http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=163995&hubname=] Koivu would remain out of the lineup for the rest of the series and underwent surgery to repair a detached retina in the off-season. 

Koivu has admitted to losing some degree of peripheral vision out of the injured eye which he will likely never regain. As well, a small cataract has developed on the eye, though currently he wants to wait until the conclusion of the 2006-2007 NHL season to have it removed. Therefore he is wearing a special contact lens trying to counter-act the cataract. 

Koivu's play has demonstrated that he can still complement linemates [[Christopher Higgins|Chris Higgins]] and [[Michael Ryder]] with seemingly no adverse impact to his performance.[http://www.cbc.ca/story/sports/national/2006/09/05/koivu-canadiens-eye-injury.html]. In fact, in the 2006-2007 season he was able to beat his career high 71 points with a cool 75, making the season after his eye injury the best of his career.[http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?statsId=1341]. Koivu attributes his increased scoring this year to developing a quicker release of the puck, rather than anything to do with his eye injury or other subsequent changes to his play style thereafter.

===International===
Koivu has represented [[Finnish national men's ice hockey team|Team Finland]] on several occasions and is the national team's captain. Most recently, he won a silver medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]] [[Winter Olympics]], and bronze medals at the [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]] [[Winter Olympics]]. He was also on the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey|2004]] [[World Cup of Hockey|World Cup]] team, which advanced to the final but lost against [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Canada]], thereby winning the silver medal.

Koivu's most renowned achievement with Team Finland is as first line center in the [[1995]] [[Ice Hockey World Championships#IIHF World Championships|IIHF World Championships]], where [[Finland]] won its only [[IIHF]] men's gold medal to date. Koivu played in the first line with [[Jere Lehtinen]] and [[Ville Peltonen]] (the "Huey, Dewey, and Louie" line [http://www.iihf.com/news/OG06/torino1097.htm]), who were all selected as tournament all-stars.

On [[February 23]], [[2006]], Koivu was elected by his fellow Olympic competitors as a member of the Athletes' Commission of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]].
