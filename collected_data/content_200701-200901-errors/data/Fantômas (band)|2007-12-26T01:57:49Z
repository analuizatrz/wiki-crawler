'''Fantômas''' is an [[avant-garde metal]] [[Rock band|band]] formed in [[1998 in metal|1998]] in [[California]], [[United States of America|United States]]. The band is named after [[Fantômas]], a [[villain]] featured in a series of [[crime novel]]s popular in [[France]] before [[World War I]].

==History==
The band was formed when singer [[Mike Patton]] composed a handful of [[spasm]]ic, [[avant-garde metal]] songs just before the collapse of his earlier group, [[Faith No More]]. Patton then sent the original compositions to his friends, hoping to form a performing group: [[guitarist]] [[Buzz Osborne]] (of [[The Melvins]]), [[Bass guitarist|bassist]] [[Trevor Dunn]] (also of [[Mr. Bungle]], the band he and Patton (and Trey Spruance) formed in high school) and [[drummer]] [[Igor Cavalera]] (of [[Sepultura]]). Cavalera declined the offer, but recommended who he thought would be perfect for the project: [[Dave Lombardo]] of [[Slayer]]. Lombardo accepted and thus was formed Patton's own [[supergroup]].<ref>{{cite web | last =Zulaica | first = Don| title = Even Better Than the Real Thing? - Mike Patton Puts His Faith in Fantomas and Mr. Bungle | publisher = BAM magazine| date = 5 July 1999 | url =http://members.tripod.com/~Nirrosive/articles/article10.txt | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =  Burton| first = Brent | title = Fantômas Suspended Animation Review | publisher = Decibel Magazine| date = | url = http://www.decibelmagazine.com/reviews/may2005/fantomas.aspx | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref>

In summer of [[2005]] the band toured [[Europe]] with [[Terry Bozzio]] on drums, because Lombardo was on tour with [[Slayer]]. Lombardo returned to the band for the final dates of the tour, which concluded on September 15, 2005. However, there are rumours that Bozzio will perform drumming duties on a future Fantômas album.<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | title = Patton has ideas for upcoming Fantomas albums | publisher = Caca Volante| date = September 2 2005  | url = http://www.cv.org/2005/09/02/patton-has-ideas-for-upcoming-fantomas-albums/ | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref>

On [[May 13]], [[2006]], Patton revealed to Billboard.com that a fifth Fantômas album has been planned. Of the album, Patton says "The next record is going to be an all-electronic affair. It's going to take some creative planning on how to record it and execute it, but there will be no acoustic instruments on it whatsoever. We're pretty much about to go into hibernation mode. I need to, once I have a little time, go back to the drawing board, and start writing the next one."<ref>{{cite web | last =Prato | first =Greg | title = Patton Juggling Numerous New Projects | publisher = billboard.com| date = May 12 2006 | url =http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002502020 | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref>

Though rooted in [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], their music touches on many different [[musical genre]]s, and is noted for its offbeat sense of humor; one critic dubbed their style "[[dada]]-metal".<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Fantomas | publisher = fantomas-lives.com| date =  | url =http://www.fantomas-lives.com/ | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref> Critic Greg Prato describes their music as "completely original…especially when compared to the blah and predictable [[Alternative rock|alt-rock]] of the late '90s."<ref>{{cite web | last =Prato | first = Greg| title = Fantômas Biography | publisher = allmusic| date =  | url =http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:xe2ibkr90ak0 | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref> Patton rarely sings conventional lyrics with the group, preferring his own bizarre style of [[Voice instrumental music|voice music]] or [[scat singing]]. 

Fantômas songs are often discordant and tuneless, using feedback and pure noise, and they could easily be described as [[Experimental Rock|experimental]] [[noise music|noise]]. However, they are not a pure noise band as they do have concrete beats and melodies in most of their songs. They are a unique combination of noise and progressive psychedelia.

The band arrange albums around [[concept album|concepts]] or themes: 
*''[[Fantômas (album)|Fantômas (Amenaza Al Mundo)]]'' was based on science fiction [[comic books]], with every song simply given a page number (Page 1, Page 2 etc.). The artwork was mainly taken from the Italian comic ''[[Diabolik]]''.
*''[[The Director's Cut]]'' was a series of reinterpretations of [[motion picture]] [[theme song]]s. Some versions are rather loyal to the sources (such as the eerie [[lullabye]] from ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]''), while others offer radical takes on the music (such the theme from ''[[The Godfather]]'' tackled in part as a [[thrash metal]] song).
*''[[Delìrium Còrdia]]'' was one extended song, with the concept of [[surgery]] without [[anesthesia]].
*''[[Suspended Animation (Fantômas album)|Suspended Animation]]'' (recorded in the same sessions as ''Delìrium Còrdia'') is an album of twisted [[cartoon music]], each track named after a day in the month of April 2005, and the limited-edition, first pressing of the album was itself (literally) a calendar of the month.

==Non-album Songs==
Fantômas have also performed a few songs which do not appear on their albums.
*Chariot Choogle (1:51) - A cover of the song by [[T. Rex (band)|T-Rex]], released on the album "Great Jewish Music: Marc Bolan". Mike Patton recorded this cover and attributed it to Fantômas.
*[[Masada (band)#10th Anniversary|Zemariam]] (3:36) - A version of the song which John Zorn had originally written for his band, [[Masada (band)|Masada]] but eventually never performed nor recorded. To celebrate Masada's 10th Anniversary John Zorn organised the release of an album known as "The Unknown Masada". Fantômas contributed this song to the release.
*[[Where Is the Line|Where Is The Line (Fantômas Remix)]] (5:28) - Released as a B-Side on [[Björk]]'s "Where Is The Line" Vinyl release.

*[[Trevor Dunn]] ([[Bass guitar|bass]])
