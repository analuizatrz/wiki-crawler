The '''Swedish Armed Forces''' ({{lang-sv|Försvarsmakten}}), is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Government agency]] responsible for the peacetime operation of the [[armed force]]s of [[Sweden]]. The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy [[peacekeeping|peace support forces]] abroad, while maintaining the long-term ability to refocus on the defense of the country in the event of war. The Armed Forces is branched into [[Swedish Army|Army]], [[Swedish Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Swedish Navy|Navy]]. As a Government agency, it reports to the Swedish Ministry of Defence. The head of armed forces is the [[Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Armed Forces]] (''Överbefälhavaren'', ''ÖB''), beside the Sovereign the most senior officer in the country.

Sweden's military is built on [[conscription]], and until the end of the [[Cold War]] nearly all males reaching the age of military service were conscripted. In recent years, the number of conscripted males has reduced dramatically, while the number of female [[volunteer]]s has increased slightly. Recruitment has generally shifted towards finding the most motivated recruits, rather than solely on the otherwise most fit for service, although there are exceptions. All soldiers serving abroad are by law required to be volunteers. In 1975 the total number of conscripts was 45,000. By 2003 it was down to 15,000. After the Defense Proposition 2004, the number of troops in training will decrease even more to between 5000 and 10000 each year, which emphasizes the need to recruit only the soldiers later prepared to volunteer for international service.

Currently, one of the most important tasks for the Swedish Armed Forces is to form a Swedish-led [[European Union battle groups|EU Battle Group]] to which [[Norway]], [[Finland]] and [[Estonia]] will also contribute. The [[Nordic Battlegroup]] (NBG) is to have a 10-day deployment readiness during the first half of [[2008]].

== Possible enemies ==
Usually, the adversary in tactical [[military exercise]]s and scenarios was thought to use equipment from the former [[Warsaw Pact]], although a specific country was never mentioned for political reasons but a common name for the enemy was "Stormakt Röd" (Superpower Red).<ref name="stormaktrod">For use of the term "Stormakt röd" in regular media, see for example  [http://www.ltz.se/artikel_standard.php?id=38319&avdelning_1=103&avdelning_2=0 this editorial].</ref> The majority of Swedish equipment is [[NATO]] compatible, and most scenarios include some form of cooperation with one or more of the NATO members. Recent political decisions have strongly emphasized the will to participate in international operations, to the point where this has become the main short-term goal of training and equipment acquisition.

Sweden aims to have the option of remaining [[neutral country|neutral]] in case of proximate war, and therefore is not a formal member of NATO or any other military alliance. It has a defense pact together with the [[Nordic countries]] and the [[European Union]].

== Current deployments ==
Currently, Sweden has deployed military forces in [[Liberia]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kosovo]]. [[Observer]]s from Sweden have been sent to a large number of countries, including [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[North Korea]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Since October [[2006]] the [[Swedish Navy]] is deployed in [[Lebanon]].

== Training ==
Officers are trained in the different combat schools and also at the [[Swedish Armed Forces Military Academy]] which has establishments at [[Karlberg Castle]] in [[Stockholm]], and in [[Halmstad]]. [[Conscription|Conscript]]s are trained at the different units of the three branches, the purpose of which primarily being training installations and without significant wartime importance.

== Military Ranks ==
Swedish [[military rank]]s, essentially corresponds phonetically to those used by the armed forces of the [[English language|English]] speaking world. Swedish ranks correspond even more closely to those in [[German language|German]] usage due to linguistic similarities. See [[comparative military ranks]].

There are two different systems of rank for [[professional officer]]s, depending on whether one is commissioned according to the system used in the Army, or the one in the Navy. The Air Force and the non-navy Marine Forces uses the same system as the Army.

The military introduced the rank of Brigadier General in 2001. The rank and the responsibilities associated with it existed before 2001, but all officers were commissioned as "Colonel First Class", or ''Överste av första graden'', i. e. not a General. The same goes for ''Flottiljamiral'' which used to be ''Kommendör av första graden'', or "Captain First Class". The background for this anomaly was a [[Politics of Sweden|political will]] to limit the number of Generals in the armed forces. No [[Swedish Field Marshals]] have been appointed since the [[19th century]].
