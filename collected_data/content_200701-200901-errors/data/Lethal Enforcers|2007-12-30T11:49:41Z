'''Lethal Enforcers''' was created as an [[Arcade game|arcade]] shooting [[video game]] by [[Konami]] in 1992. The game was [[Porting|ported]] to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]] and [[Sega CD]] in 1993. The game makes use of a [[revolver]]-shaped [[light gun]] known as the [[Konami Justifier]], which was included with the game. In the case of console versions, a standard controller can be used in lieu of the light gun. Lethal Enforcers also spawned a sequel: ''[[Lethal Enforcers II: Gunfighters]]'', followed by the much different (and fully computer-generated) ''[[Lethal Enforcers 3]]''.

In the late 90's, Konami released ''Lethal Enforcers I & II'' for PlayStation.  Featured emulated versions of the arcade games (with loading times between scenes).

The game puts the player into the boots of a police officer who has been assigned to stop a growing crime wave that puts the city's security in jeopardy.

Lethal Enforcers has five stages or 'assignments': 'The Bank Robbery', 'Chinatown Assault', 'The Hijackers', 'The Drug Dealers', and 'The Chemical Plant'. During each stage, the player must shoot the armed criminals without harming any innocent bystanders or fellow officers. One shot is usually enough to kill most enemies. At the end of each stage, there is a [[boss (video games)|boss]] that must be defeated in order to complete the assignment. Bosses often shoot projectiles at the player. 

In-game, the player's gun can carry up to 6 bullets. To reload, the player must aim their lightgun away from the screen and pull the trigger. In case of the console versions, if a controller is used, the player only needs to press a specific button to reload.

At the beginning of the game, three to five life units are available. In the arcade version, more can be purchased by inserting additional coins. Life units are also awarded based on how many points the player scores while playing the game. Every time the player is shot or an innocent person or officer is shot, one life unit will be lost. The game ends when all life units are gone, but continuous play is available.

There are different ranks that the player can attain, depending on how well the player performs. The ranks are: Patrolman, Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain and Commander. When the game begins, the player's rank is Detective, and after each stage the player will be promoted, provided they have not killed any innocents. If the player has killed innocents on any stage, they will either maintain their rank or will be demoted.

Additional weaponry can be found throughout the game that will gives better firepower: automatics, Magnum bullets, rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers and machine guns. The grenade launchers and machine guns can each be used only once, but the automatics, the Magnum bullets, the rifles and the shotguns can be reloaded the same way as the regular gun. If the player is shot while they have one of those weapons, however, they lose any special guns they have collected and will return to the regular gun.

In the arcade version, a [[DIP switch]] allows users to set the game to "Arcade Mode" or "Street Mode". In Arcade Mode, one assignment follows directly after the other where, between each assignment, there is a target practice session where the goal is to try to shoot all the required targets to improve the player's accuracy. Street Mode gives the player a choice of which stage they would like to go to, including a target practice stage.

== Trivia ==

* The game takes place in the city of Chicago: in the Chinatown Assault stage, the player can see the [[Chicago 'L']], and the Sears Tower is visible in the background when playing the arcade version of the game.

* According to a photograph of an opened wallet on the game's control panel, player 1's name is Don Marshall and lives in Chicago, Illinois.

*All enemies wear either ski masks, sunglasses, or gas masks.

*The Super NES version changes all bloody bullet holes and wounds on the screen to a white colour, implying normal bullet holes and scratches.
