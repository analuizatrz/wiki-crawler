==Plot==
<!-- Read this before editing: 1. This is a synopsis, try to keep it as short as possible. Tiny details do not need to be added to it. 2. The spoiler warning is not supposed to be used in sections that are clearly going to contain spoilers. --> 

The movie opens with a [[fairy tale]]. In it, Princess Moanna, whose father is the king of the [[underworld]], becomes curious about the world above. When she goes to the surface, she forgets about her life in the underworld and grows old and dies as a mortal. The king believes that her [[spirit]] will come back to the underworld someday.

The story cuts to post-[[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] Spain in 1944, after [[Francisco Franco]] has come into power. Ofelia ([[Ivana Baquero|Baquero]]), a young girl who loves fairy tales, travels with her pregnant mother Carmen ([[Ariadna Gil|Gil]]) to meet Captain Vidal ([[Sergi López i Ayats|López]]), her new stepfather and father of Carmen's unborn child. Vidal, the son of a famed commander who died in [[Morocco]], believes strongly in [[fascism]] and was assigned to root out any [[Spanish maquis|anti-fascist rebels]].

Ofelia discovers a large insect resembling a [[stick insect]] which she believes to be a [[fairy]]. It follows her to the mill where Vidal is stationed and leads Ofelia into an ancient [[labyrinth]] nearby. Before Ofelia can enter, she is stopped by Mercedes ([[Maribel Verdú|Verdú]]), one of Vidal's maids who is spying for the rebels. That night, it appears in Ofelia's bedroom, where it changes into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth where she meets the [[faun]] ([[Doug Jones (actor)|Jones]]), who believes her to be Princess Moanna and gives her three tasks to complete before the [[full moon]] to ensure that her "[[essence]] is intact". Meanwhile, Vidal kills two farmers suspected of being rebels before searching them properly. After looking in their bag it is clear that they were hunting rabbits as they had said and were not rebels.

[[Image:Panslabyrinthofelia.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The faun gives Ofelia the Book of Crossroads, which explains her tasks.]]Ofelia completes the first task of retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad, but she becomes worried about her mother whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a [[Mandrake (plant)|mandrake root]], which instantly begins to cure her mother's illness. 

Accompanied by three fairy guides, Ofelia then completes the second task of retrieving an ornate dagger from the lair of the Pale Man ([[Doug Jones (actor)|Jones]] as well), a child-eating monster who sits silently in front of a large feast.  Although she was gravely warned not to consume anything, she eats two grapes, awakening him. He eats two of the fairies and chases her, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give her the third task.

Meanwhile, Vidal becomes increasingly vicious, torturing a captured rebel and killing a doctor who [[euthanasia|euthanized]] the prisoner to stop his pain. Vidal catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root, and Carmen throws it into the fireplace, where it then begins to scream. Instantly, she develops painful contractions and dies giving birth to a son. Vidal discovers that Mercedes is a spy, and he captures her and Ofelia as they attempt to escape. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, and Mercedes is taken to be tortured; however, she frees herself, injures Vidal, and flees into the woods, where the rebels rescue her.

The faun returns to Ofelia and gives her one more chance to prove herself. He tells her to take her baby brother into the labyrinth. Ofelia steals the baby after sedating Vidal; although disoriented, Vidal continues to chase her through the labyrinth while the rebels attack the mill. The faun tells Ofelia that the [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] to the underworld will open only with an innocent's blood, so he needed a drop of her brother's blood. Ofelia refuses to harm her brother and the faun disappears. Vidal finds her, takes the baby and shoots Ofelia. 

When he leaves the labyrinth the rebels and Mercedes are waiting for him. Knowing that he will die, he calmly hands Mercedes the baby. He takes out his watch, ready to break it, and tells Mercedes to tell his son when he grows up what time his father died, reflecting his father's death. Mercedes refuses, telling him that his son will never even know his name. Pedro, one of the rebels and Mercedes' brother, draws his weapon and shoots Vidal, killing him.

As Mercedes enters the labyrinth and mourns over the dying girl, drops of Ofelia's blood spill onto the altar that is supposed to lead her into the underworld.  Ofelia is reunited with the king and queen of the underworld. She learns that by giving her life to save her brother's, she has proven herself to be Princess Moanna.

==Cast==
[[Image:Ivana Baquero in Pan's Labyrinth.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ivana Baquero with one of the magical characters]]
*'''[[Ivana Baquero]]''' as '''Ofelia''': Del Toro says he was "scared shitless" in [[casting]] the right actress for the lead role, and that finding the 11-year old Spanish actress was purely accidental. "The character I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9 and Ivana came in and she was a little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age."<ref name="DH">{{cite news |url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/deltoro.php|title=Exclusive Interview: Guillermo del Toro "Pan's Labyrinth" |accessdate=2007-01-28|date=[[2006-09-26]] |publisher=Dark Horizons |last=Fischer|first=Paul}}</ref> Baquero says that del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairytales to help her "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt." She says she thought the film was "marvelous," and that "At the same time it can bring you pain and sadness and scariness and happiness."<ref name=SF/>
*'''[[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]]''' as '''The Faun''' and '''The Pale Man''': Jones had worked with del Toro before on ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' and ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]'', and says the director sent him an email saying "You must be in this film. No one else can play this part but you". Jones read an English translation of the script and was enthusiastic but then found out the film was in Spanish, which he did not speak. Jones says he was "terrified" and del Toro suggested using a voice over actor to dub over him later, or learning Spanish phonetically, but Jones rejected both ideas preferring to learn it himself. He said "I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word and I got the pronunciation semi right before I even went in," using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up to practice the words.<ref>{{cite news |url =http://www.canmag.com/news/4/3/6216|title=Doug Jones En Espanol |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2006-12-27]] |publisher=CanMag|last=Topel|first=Fred}}</ref> Del Toro decided afterwards that he still preferred to dub Jones with the voice of "an authoritative theatre actor," but Jones's efforts remained valuable because the voice actor was able to easily match his delivery with Jones's mouth movements.<ref>{{cite news |url =http://www.straight.com/node/63731 |title= Labyrinth’s faun unmasked |accessdate=2007-01-28 |date=[[2007-01-11]] |publisher=straight.com |last=Eisner|first=Ken}}</ref>
*'''[[Sergi López (actor)|Sergi López]]''' as '''Captain Vidal''': Del Toro met with López in [[Barcelona]], a year and a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. López said of it, "For two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written.'". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he's said that "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canmag.com/nw/6255-sergi-lopez-pans-labyrinth-interview |title=Sergi Lopez on ''Pan's Labyrinth'' |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2007-01-02]]|publisher=CanMag| last=Topel |first=Fred}}</ref> In Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the producers told del Toro "You should be very careful because you don't know about these things because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance"; del Toro replied "Well, it's not that I don't know, it's that I don't care."<ref name="oscarwatch">{{cite news |url=http://www.oscarwatch.com/2007/01/pans_labyrinth_a_story_that.html |title=Pan's Labyrinth: A Story that Needed Guillermo Del Toro |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2007-01-11]]|publisher=oscarwatch.com| last=Stone|first=Sasha}}</ref>
*'''[[Ariadna Gil]]''' as '''Carmen'''
*'''[[Maribel Verdú]]''' as '''Mercedes''': Like López, Verdú was cast against type; usually playing a sex goddess, del Toro selected her to play the compassionate revolutionary because he "saw a sadness in her...he thought would be perfect for the part".<ref name="oscarwatch"/>
*'''Alex Angulo''' as '''Doctor Ferreiro'''
*'''Roger Casamajor''' as '''Pedro'''
*'''César Vea''' as '''Serrano'''

==Influences==
Del Toro has said the film has strong connections in theme to ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' and should be seen as an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there. Some of the other works he drew on for inspiration include [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''[[Ficciones]]'', [[Arthur Machen|Arthur Machen's]] ''[[The Great God Pan]]'' and ''[[The White People]]'', [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany|Lord Dunsany's]] ''The Blessing of Pan'', [[Algernon Blackwood|Algernon Blackwood's]] ''Pan's Garden'' and [[Francisco Goya|Francisco Goya's]] works. In 2004, del Toro said: "Pan is an original story. Some of my favorite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and the symbol of the labyrinth. These are things that I find very compelling (remember the labyrinth image on ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]''?) and I am trying to mix them and play with them."<ref>[http://www.deltorofilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=&sid=2e4cd823ac827248f20a4820065589d2 Del Toro message board] Retrieved [[2007]]-[[June 17|06-17]]</ref>

Guillermo Navarro, the director of photography, said that "after doing work in Hollywood on other movies and with other directors, working in our original language in different scenery brings me back to the original reasons I wanted to make movies, which is basically to tell stories with complete freedom and to let the visuals really contribute to the telling of the story."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/January2007/PansLabyrinth/page1.php|title=Fear and Fantasy|accessdate=2007-06-17|publisher=[[American Cinematographer]]}}</ref>

===Comparisons to other films===
In 2007, del Toro noted the striking similarities between his film and [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia|Chronicles of Narnia]]'': both films are set around the same time, have similar child-age principal characters, mythic creatures (particularly the fauns), and themes of "disobedience and choice."  Says del Toro: "This is my version of that universe, not only 'Narnia,' but that universe of children's literature."<ref name=del-toro-narnia>{{cite news|url=http://www.starbeacon.com/heat/local_story_363121523|title=Del Toro crafts a harrowing fairy tale|accessdate=2007-03-28|date=[[2006-12-29]] |publisher=[[Star Beacon]]}}</ref>  In fact, del Toro was asked to direct ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' but turned it down for ''Pan's Labyrinth.''<ref name=del-toro-narnia/>

In addition to ''Narnia'', ''Pan's Labyrinth'' has also been compared to films such as [[Gabor Csupo]]'s ''[[Bridge to Terabithia (2007 film)|Bridge to Terabithia]]'' and [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/83674.html |title=Pan's Labyrinth Film Review - Time Out Film |accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canmag.com/nw/6778-bridge-terabithia-review | title=Bridge to Terabithia a Pan's Labyrinth for Kids |accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> Del Toro himself has noted similarities with ''[[The Spirit of the Beehive]]''.<ref name=outsidetheframe>{{cite web|url=http://www.thephoenix.com/OutsideTheFrame/PermaLink.aspx?guid=8ae649e6-a17f-478b-993a-a6f0f791a936 |title=Outside The Frame: Guillermo Del Toro Interview Part 1 |accessdate=2007-01-28 |date=2007-01-11 |publisher=ThePhoenix.com}}</ref>
