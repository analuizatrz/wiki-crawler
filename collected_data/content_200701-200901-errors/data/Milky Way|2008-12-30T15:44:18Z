The '''Milky Way''', sometimes called simply '''The Galaxy''', is the [[galaxy]] in which our [[Solar System]] is located. It is a [[barred spiral galaxy|barred spiral]] [[galaxy]] that is part of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies. While significant to humans, it is only one of billions of galaxies in the [[observable universe]].

Its name is a translation of the [[Latin]] ''Via Lactea'', which derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Γαλαξίας'' (Galaxias), both of which refer to the pale band of light formed by the plane of the galaxy as seen from Earth (see [[Galaxy#Etymology|etymology of 'Galaxy']]). Some sources hold that, strictly speaking, the term ''Milky Way'' should refer exclusively to the band of light that the galaxy forms in the sky, while the galaxy as an astrophysical whole should receive the full name ''Milky Way Galaxy'', or alternatively ''the Galaxy''.<ref>

==Appearance from Earth==
The Milky Way galaxy, as viewed from the [[Earth]], itself situated on one of the spiral arms of the galaxy (see [[Milky Way#Sun's location|Sun's location]]), appears as a hazy band of [[white]] [[light]] in the night sky arching across the entire [[celestial sphere]] and originating from [[star]]s and other material that lie within the galactic plane. The plane of the Milky Way is inclined by about 60° to the [[ecliptic]] (the plane of the Earth's orbit), with the [[North Galactic Pole]] situated at [[right ascension]] 12h 49m, [[declination]] +27.4° ([[B1950]]) near [[beta Comae Berenices]]. The [[South Galactic Pole]] is near [[alpha Sculptoris]].

The center of the galaxy is in the direction of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], and the Milky Way then "passes" (going westward) through [[Scorpius]], [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]], [[Norma (constellation)|Norma]], [[Triangulum Australe]], [[Circinus]], [[Centaurus]], [[Musca]], [[Crux]], [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]], [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]], [[Puppis]], [[Canis Major]], [[Monoceros]], [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] & [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]], [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]] & [[Lacerta]], [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]], [[Vulpecula]], [[Sagitta]], [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], [[Ophiuchus]], [[Scutum]], and back to [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].
 
The Milky Way looks brightest in the direction of the [[constellation]] of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], toward the [[galactic center]]. Relative to the [[celestial equator]], it passes as far north as the constellation of [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] and as far south as the constellation of [[Crux]], indicating the high inclination of Earth's [[equator|equatorial plane]] and the plane of the [[ecliptic]] relative to the galactic plane. The fact that the Milky Way divides the night sky into two roughly equal [[celestial sphere|hemispheres]] indicates that our Solar System lies close to the [[galactic plane]]. The Milky Way has a relatively low [[surface brightness]], making it difficult to see from any [[Urban area|urban]] or [[suburban]] location suffering from [[light pollution]].

The Galaxy's bar is thought to be about 27,000 light-years long, running through its center at a 44 ± 10 degree angle to the line between the Sun and the center of the Galaxy. It is composed primarily of red stars, believed to be ancient (see [[red dwarf]], [[red giant]]). The bar is surrounded by a ring called the "5-[[Kiloparsec|kpc]] ring" that contains a large fraction of the molecular hydrogen present in the Galaxy, as well as most of the Milky Way's [[star formation]] activity.

===Spiral arms===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=November 2008}}
[[Image:Milky Way Arms.svg|right|thumb|Observed and extrapolated structure of the spiral arms]]
Each spiral arm describes a [[logarithmic spiral]] (as do the arms of all spiral galaxies) with a pitch of approximately 12 degrees. There are believed to be four major spiral arms which all start near the Galaxy's center. These are named as follows, according to the image at right:

|style="background-color: #ff9b00"|orange
|[[Orion Arm]] (which contains our own Solar System and [[Sun]])
|}

Outside of the major spiral arms is the [[Outer Ring]] or [[Monoceros Ring]], a ring of stars around the Milky Way proposed by astronomers Brian Yanny and [[Heidi Jo Newberg]], which consists of gas and stars torn from other galaxies billions of years ago.

As is typical for many galaxies, the distribution of mass in the Milky Way Galaxy is such that the [[orbital speed]] of most stars in the Galaxy does not depend strongly on its distance from the center. Away from the central bulge or outer rim, the typical stellar velocity is between 210 and 240&nbsp;km/s.<ref name="fn4">{{cite web

 | title=Mass of the Milky Way Galaxy
 | publisher=University of Oregon
 | accessdate=2007-05-10 }}</ref> Hence the [[orbital period]] of the typical star is directly proportional only to the length of the path traveled. This is unlike the situation within the Solar System, where two-body gravitational dynamics dominate and different orbits are expected to have significantly different velocities associated with them. This difference is one of the major pieces of evidence for the existence of [[dark matter]]. Another interesting aspect is the so-called "wind-up problem" of the spiral arms. If one believes that the inner parts of the arms rotate faster than the outer part, then the Galaxy will wind up so much that the spiral structure will be thinned out. But this is not what is observed in spiral galaxies; instead, astronomers propose that the spiral arms form as a result of a matter-density wave emanating from the galactic center. This can be likened to a moving traffic jam on a highway — the cars are all moving, but there is always a region of slow-moving cars. Thus this results in several spiral arms where there are a lot of stars and gas. This model also agrees with enhanced star formation in or near spiral arms; the compressional waves increase the density of molecular hydrogen and protostars form as a result.

While the disk contains gas and dust which obscure the view in some wavelengths, the spheroid component does not. Active [[star formation]] takes place in the disk (especially in the spiral arms, which represent areas of high density), but not in the halo. [[Open cluster]]s also occur primarily in the disk.

Similarly, with the discovery of the [[Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy]], it was found that a ring of galactic debris from its interaction with the Milky Way encircles the galactic disk.

On January 9, 2006, [[Mario Jurić]] and others of [[Princeton University]] announced that the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] of the northern sky found a huge and diffuse structure (spread out across an area around 5,000 times the size of a full moon) within the Milky Way that does not seem to fit within current models. The collection of stars rises close to perpendicular to the plane of the spiral arms of the Galaxy. The proposed likely interpretation is that a [[dwarf galaxy]] is merging with the Milky Way. This galaxy is tentatively named the [[Virgo Stellar Stream]] and is found in the direction of [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] about 30,000 light-years away.

The Apex of the Sun's Way, or the [[solar apex]], is the direction that the Sun travels through space in the Milky Way. The general direction of the Sun's galactic motion is towards the star [[Vega]] near the constellation of [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], at an angle of roughly 60 sky degrees to the direction of the [[Galactic Center]]. The Sun's orbit around the Galaxy is expected to be roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the galactic spiral arms and non-uniform mass distributions. In addition the Sun oscillates up and down relative to the galactic plane approximately 2.7 times per orbit. This is very similar to how a [[simple harmonic oscillator]] works with no drag force (damping) term. These oscillations often coincide with [[mass extinction]] periods on Earth; presumably the higher density of stars close to the galactic plane leads to more [[impact events]].<ref name="extinction">{{cite journal

{{main|Local group|Andromeda-Milky Way collision}}
The Milky Way and the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] are a [[binary system (astronomy)|binary system]] of giant spiral galaxies belonging to a group of 50 closely bound galaxies known as the [[Local Group]], itself being part of the [[Virgo Supercluster]].

Two smaller galaxies and a number of [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] in the Local Group [[orbit]] the Milky Way. The largest of these is the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] with a diameter of 20,000 light-years. It has a close companion, the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]]. The [[Magellanic Stream]] is a peculiar streamer of neutral [[hydrogen]] gas connecting these two small galaxies. The stream is thought to have been dragged from the Magellanic Clouds in tidal interactions with the Galaxy. Some of the dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way are [[Canis Major Dwarf]] (the closest), [[Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy]], [[Ursa Minor Dwarf]], [[Sculptor Dwarf]], [[Sextans Dwarf]], [[Fornax Dwarf]], and [[Leo I Dwarf]]. The smallest Milky Way dwarf galaxies are only 500 light-years in diameter. These include [[Carina Dwarf]], [[Draco Dwarf]], and [[Leo II (dwarf galaxy)|Leo II Dwarf]]. There may still be undetected dwarf galaxies, which are dynamically bound to the Milky Way. Observations through the [[zone of avoidance]] are frequently detecting new distant and nearby galaxies. Some galaxies consisting mostly of gas and dust may also have evaded detection so far.

In January 2006, researchers reported that the heretofore unexplained warp in the disk of the Milky Way has now been mapped and found to be a ripple or vibration set up by the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as they circle the Galaxy, causing vibrations at certain frequencies when they pass through its edges.<ref>{{cite press release

}}</ref> Previously, these two galaxies, at around 2% of the mass of the Milky Way, were considered too small to influence the Milky Way. However, by taking into account [[dark matter]], the movement of these two galaxies creates a wake that influences the larger Milky Way. Taking dark matter into account results in an approximately twenty-fold increase in mass for the Galaxy. This calculation is according to a computer model made by Martin Weinberg of the [[University of Massachusetts, Amherst]]. In this model, the dark matter is spreading out from the galactic disc with the known gas layer. As a result, the model predicts that the gravitational effect of the Magellanic Clouds is amplified as they pass through the Galaxy.

Current measurements suggest the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] is approaching us at 100 to 140 kilometers per second. The Milky Way may collide with it in 3 to 4 billion years, depending on the importance of unknown lateral components to the galaxies' relative motion. If they collide, individual stars within the galaxies would not collide, but instead the two galaxies will merge to form a single [[elliptical galaxy]] over the course of about a billion years.<ref>{{cite news | first=Janet | last=Wong | title=Astrophysicist maps out our own galaxy's end | publisher=University of Toronto | date=April 14, 2000 | url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bin/000414b.asp | accessdate=2007-01-11 }}</ref>

In the general sense, the absolute velocity of any object through space is not a meaningful question according to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], which declares that there is no "preferred" [[inertial frame of reference]] in space with which to compare the Galaxy's motion. (Motion must always be specified with respect to another object.)

Astronomers believe the Milky Way is moving at approximately 630&nbsp;km per second relative to the local co-moving frame of reference that moves with the [[Hubble flow]].<ref name=Jones2>{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Galaxies and Cosmology |page= 298 |isbn=0521546230 |author=Mark H.

The [[Local Group]] (a cluster of gravitationally bound galaxies containing, among others, the Milky Way and the [[Andromeda galaxy]]) is part of a [[supercluster]] called the [[Local Supercluster]], centered near the [[Virgo Cluster]]: although they are moving away from each other at 967&nbsp;km/s as part of the [[Hubble flow]], the velocity is less than would be expected given the 16.8&nbsp;million pc distance due to the gravitational attraction between the Local Group and the Virgo Cluster.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.newast.2005.08.008 | title=Mass determination of groups of galaxies: Effects of the cosmological constant | year=2006 | author=Peirani, S | journal=New Astronomy | volume=11 | pages=325}}</ref>

==History== 
===Etymology and beliefs===
{{main|List of names for the Milky Way|Milky Way (mythology)}}
There are many [[creation myth]]s around the world which explain the origin of the Milky Way and give it its name. The [[English language|English]] phrase is a translation from [[Greek language|Greek]] Γαλαξίας, ''Galaxias'', which is derived from the word for milk (γάλα, ''gala''). This is also the origin of the word ''[[galaxy]]''. Indians call it the [[Akashganga]] or a celestial form of the holy river, Ganga.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} In [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]], the Milky Way was caused by milk spilt by [[Hera]] when suckling [[Heracles]].

The term ''Milky Way'' first appeared in [[English literature]] in a poem by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].
{{Quote|"See yonder, lo, the Galaxyë<br />&nbsp;Which men clepeth the Milky Wey,<br />&nbsp;For hit is whyt."|Geoffrey Chaucer|Geoffrey Chaucer ''[[The House of Fame]]'', ''c.'' 1380.<ref>{{cite web

In a large area from [[Central Asia]] to [[Africa]], the name for the Milky Way is related to the word for [[straw]]. It has been claimed that this was spread by [[Arab]]s who in turn borrowed the word from [[Armenian language|Armenian]].<ref>{{cite journal

The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name "Silver River" (銀河) is used throughout [[East Asia]], including [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. An alternative name for the Milky Way in ancient China, especially in poems, is "Heavenly [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]]"(天汉). In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], "Silver River" (銀河 ''ginga'') means galaxies in general and the Milky Way is called the "Silver River System" (銀河系 ''gingakei'') or the "River of Heaven" (天の川 ''Amanogawa''). In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], it is called ''Vintergatan'', or "Winter Street", because the stars in the belt were used to predict time of the approaching winter.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

However, Aristotle himself believed the Milky Way to be caused by "the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars which were large, numerous and close together" and that the "ignition takes place in the upper part of the [[atmosphere]], in the [[Sublunary sphere|region of the world which is continuous with the heavenly motions]]."<ref name=Montada>{{cite web|author=Josep Puig Montada|title=Ibn Bajja|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-bajja|date=[[September 28]], 2007|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> The [[Islamic astronomy|Arabian astronomer]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]] (965-1037 AD), refuted this by making the first attempt at observing and measuring the Milky Way's [[parallax]],<ref>{{citation|title=Great Muslim Mathematicians|first=Mohaini|last=Mohamed|year=2000|publisher=Penerbit UTM|isbn=9835201579|pages=49–50}}</ref> and he thus "determined that because the Milky Way had no parallax, it was very remote from the [[earth]] and did not belong to the atmosphere."<ref>{{cite web|title=Popularisation of Optical Phenomena: Establishing the First Ibn Al-Haytham Workshop on Photography|author=Hamid-Eddine Bouali, Mourad Zghal, Zohra Ben Lakhdar|publisher=The Education and Training in Optics and Photonics Conference|year=2005|url=http://spie.org/etop/ETOP2005_080.pdf|accessdate=2008-07-08|format=PDF}}</ref>

Actual proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when [[Galileo Galilei]] used a [[Optical telescope|telescope]] to study the Milky Way and discovered that it was composed of a huge number of faint stars.<ref>{{cite web | author=J.

The resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk. Kant also conjectured that some of the [[nebula]]e visible in the night sky might be separate "galaxies" themselves, similar to our own.<ref name="our_galaxy">{{cite web | last = Evans | first = J.

The first attempt to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the [[Sun]] within it was carried out by [[William Herschel]] in 1785 by carefully counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the Galaxy with the Solar System close to the center.
[[Image:Pic iroberts1.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of the "Great Andromeda Nebula" from 1899, later identified as the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]]]
In 1845, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral-shaped nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.<ref>{{cite web | last = Abbey | first = Lenny | url = http://labbey.com/Telescopes/Parsontown.html | title = The Earl of Rosse and the Leviathan of Parsontown | publisher = The Compleat Amateur Astronomer | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}</ref>

In 1917, [[Heber Curtis]] had observed the nova [[S Andromedae]] within the "Great [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] Nebula" ([[Messier object]] [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]]). Searching the photographic record, he found 11 more [[nova]]e. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] fainter than those that occurred within our galaxy. As a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 parsecs. He became a proponent of the "island universes" hypothesis, which held that the spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Heber D.

The matter was conclusively settled by [[Edwin Hubble]] in the early 1920s using a new telescope.
