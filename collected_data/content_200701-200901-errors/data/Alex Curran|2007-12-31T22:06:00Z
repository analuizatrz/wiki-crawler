==Personal life==

A former nail technician, Alex Curran was raised in [[Maghull]], and attended Maghull High School. Curran and Steven Gerrard have been a couple since 2002.<ref name="people">Interview with Alex Curran, ''[[Sunday People]]'', [[May 13]] 2005.  Online version available [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20050313/ai_n12944334|here]</ref> Prior to her relationship with Gerrard, Curran was dating businessman Tony Richardson, while Gerrard was dating [[Jennifer Ellison]].  At some point in 2002, Curran and Ellison switched lovers; ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "who stole whom off whom is still the subject of some debate and perhaps Ellison's autobiography".<ref name="wives">[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1786728,00.html Meet the real footballers' wives], ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[June 4]] [[2006]].</ref>

Curran and Gerrard married on [[June 16]] 2007, at the Cliveden House luxury hotel in Berkshire<ref name="wedding">[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_method=full%26objectid=18732839%26siteid=89520-name_page.html Carrick in Wedding Clash], ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', [[10 March]] 2007</ref> They have two daughters, Lilly-Ella (born 23 February 2004) and Lexie (born 9 May 2006) <ref name="children">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1350448/bio IMDB page on Steven Gerrard]</ref> and live in [[Formby, Merseyside]].

On [[11 December 2007]], while husband [[Steven Gerrard]] was away playing with Liverpool, her and Steven's home was [[burglary|burgled]] while Alex and another female resident were inside. Alex was confronted by 4 masked robbers who were reportedly there for a [[GBP|£]]10,000 watch that Alex had brought for Steven for Christmas, this was on the day that she had mentioned it in ''Closer'' magazine. Gerrard was the sixth Liverpool player to be burgled while away playing football.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Football/News_Story/0,,2226584,00.html Masked raiders confront Gerrard's wife in sixth raid on Liverpool players' homes], ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[December 13]], [[2007]].</ref>

==Controversy==

On [[8 August]] [[2006]], Curran was arrested on suspicion of assault by [[Merseyside police]] following a fight at the Shangri-La restaurant in [[Liverpool]] city centre. A teenaged girl, also from Maghull, was struck in the face by a glass bottle during the altercation.<ref name="assault">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=400143&in_page_id=1770&ico=Homepage&icl=TabModule&icc=picbox&ct=5 Gerrard's WAG arrested over bottle attack], ''[[Daily Mail]]'', [[12 August]] [[2006]].</ref>  Curran was released on bail until November 2006,<ref name="assault2">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=400348&in_page_id=1770 The girl 'hit in the face with a bottle' by Gerrard's fiancee], ''Daily Mail'', [[13 August]] [[2006]].</ref> and the charges were later dropped.

Curran was also involved in disagreement with singer [[Jamelia]] (formerly a [[WAGs|WAG]] due to her engagement to footballer [[Darren Byfield]]). Jamelia described all footballer wives as "leeches," and insulted Curran specifically: "God forbid if Alex Curran split up with Steve Gerrard. Who would she be then?" Curran responded in an interview with ''[[OK!]]'' magazine, "She’ll be glad to know I don’t know her boyfriend’s name but Steven (Gerrard) thinks he’s lower than a non-league player."<ref name="wagfight">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1886971,00.html People daily comment section], ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[October 4]] [[2006]]</ref>
