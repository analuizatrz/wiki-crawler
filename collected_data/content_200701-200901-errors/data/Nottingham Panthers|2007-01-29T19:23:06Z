The '''Nottingham Panthers''' (for sponsorship reasons officially referred to as the '''[[GMB Union|GMB]] Nottingham Panthers''') are an [[ice hockey]] club based in [[Nottingham]], [[England]]. They are currently members of the [[Elite Ice Hockey League]]. The modern day Nottingham Panthers were formed in [[1980]], and were named after a club of the same name that existed between [[1946]] and [[1960]]. In [[2006]] the Panthers are celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of ice hockey's arrival in the city. They play their home games at the [[National Ice Centre (UK)|National Ice Centre]] just east of [[Nottingham City Centre|Nottingham city centre]]. Until [[2000]] the team played at the [[Nottingham Ice Stadium|Ice Stadium]] which stood on the same site as their current home.

The Panthers are one of the most financially stable and best supported ice hockey clubs<ref>Stewart Roberts, Ice Hockey Annual 2006-07</ref> in the [[United Kingdom]]. They have played at the highest level of British ice hockey throughout their history and are the only team who were founder members of the [[British Hockey League]]'s Premier Division in [[1983]] who continue to hold membership of the top flight league.<ref>{{cite web | title=Panthers 1983-84 season information| work=panthershistory.co.uk 1983-84 season information | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/83-84.htm| accessdate=November 28th | accessyear=2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Panthers 2006-07 season information| work=panthershistory.co.uk 2006-07 season information | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2006-07.htm#LEAGUE| accessdate=November 28th | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>  Despite this the Panthers have a near legendary reputation of being frustrated losers. The modern club has never succeeded in winning a [[List of British ice hockey league champions|league title]] in a [[drought (sport)|drought]] dating back to [[1956]] (or 31 playing seasons) and their sole [[British Championship|Championship]] came in [[1989]]. The club have been stronger in cup competitions, winning the [[Autumn Cup]] on six occasions and the [[Challenge Cup (UK Ice Hockey)|Challenge Cup]] once.

==History==
===1946-60: The Original Nottingham Panthers===

An initial attempt to bring a professional [[ice hockey]] team to [[Nottingham]] was made in [[1939]] following the completion of the [[Nottingham Ice Stadium|Ice Stadium]]. A team was assembled and brought to the [[United Kingdom]] from [[Canada]] to compete in the 1939-40 [[English National League]] season but were prompty sent home having not played a single game due to the outbreak of [[World War II]].<ref>Mick Holland, ''[[Nottingham Evening Post]] Football Post (November 18th 2006), No. 18, Vol. LXXXVI</ref> Seven years later after the war had been won a second effort to bring ice hockey to the city was begun and with a team of Canadians largely from [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] the Nottingham Panthers played their first competative game on [[November 22nd]] [[1946]] with a 3-2 home victory over the [[Wembley Monarchs]].

[[Image:Panthers46.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The first Nottingham Panthers team]]

During their early years the Panthers struggled finishing bottom in their first season before posting three consecutive sixth place finishes in the league and barely performing better in the [[Autumn Cup]]. In [[1948]] [[Archibald Stinchcombe|Archie Stinchcombe]] became head coach, a position he would retain until [[1954]]. Despite a lack of success in their formative years the team had a number of players who would become local heroes including [[forward (ice hockey)|forwards]] [[Les Strongman]] and [[Chick Zamick]]. Zamick became one of the most prolific scorers in the league and won the ''Nottingham Sportsman of the Year'' award on two occasions, defeating sportsmen such as the legendary [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] [[football (soccer)|footballer]] [[Tommy Lawton]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Chick Zamick| work=panthershistory.co.uk Chick Zamick Profile | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Players/zamick.htm | accessdate=November 30th | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

Success finally came in the [[1950]]-[[1951|51]] season. After a fourth place finish in the Autumn Cup the Panthers won eighteen of their thirty games in the league and with the best goalscoring and defensive record Nottingham clinched their first league title by one point ahead of the [[Brighton Tigers]]. A crucial injury to Zamick saw the Panthers fail to retain the title the following year but success returned in [[1953]]-[[1954|54]] when after finishing bottom of the Autumn Cup standings the Panthers turned their season around and clinched a second league title by another single-point margin.

During the summer of [[1954]] Stinchcombe left his position as coach and was replaced by Zamick. The league structure also underwent change with the [[England|English]] league and it's [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish National League (1932 - 1954)|counterpart]] merging to form a new [[British National League (1954 - 1960)|British National League]]. The Panthers finished second to [[Harringay Racers]] in the twelve team competition. The new league did not prove to be the success people had hoped for and after one season the league's membership fell to five with only the [[Paisley Pirates]] representing Scotland but despite these troubles the [[1955]]-[[1956|56]] season proved to be the club's most successful ever. The club won the Autumn Cup at the begining of the season before clinching their third league title by virtue of having won a single game more than the [[Wembley Lions]]. The Panthers also travelled to [[Sweden]] where they won the [[Ahearne Cup]]. This was the last occasion that the original club would claim any silverware and was the last season in which a Nottingham Panthers team were [[List of British ice hockey league champions|champions of their league]].

Over the next four years Nottingham rarely threatened the top of the table in either the Autumn Cup or the league. In [[1960]] however the Panthers took part in the first [[British Championship]] final in thirty years<ref>{{cite web | title=British Championship Winners| work=azhockey.com List of British Championship Winners| url=http://www.azhockey.com/champs/champsGB.html#British Championship | accessdate=November 30th | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> where they met the [[Brighton Tigers]]. Nottingham were defeated 3-2 in the first leg but won the second in regulation time by the same scoreline forcing the first [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] period the Panthers had ever taken part in. Here Brighton scored to tie the game at 3-3 and clinche the tie 6-5.

In the close season the British National League collapsed and the Ice Stadium decided to shut down the Nottingham Panthers. Ice hockey would not return to the venue for the next two decades.

===1980-2000: The Rebirth of the Nottingham Panthers===

The Nottingham Panthers were revived largely thanks to the efforts of Gary Keward. In [[1980]] the Ice Stadium agreed to a request by Keward to give ice hockey another chance and Keward's [[Sheffield Lancers]] relocated to Nottingham taking the name of the team that Keward and many others had supported more than twenty years earlier. On [[September 22nd]] [[1980]] the modern Panthers took to the ice for the first time defeating the [[Solihull Barons]] 7-4 at the Ice Stadium. 

[[Image:Kewardg.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Gary Keward, the man who brought the Panthers back to Nottingham]]

During their first three seasons the Panthers played in regionalised leagues, firstly in the [[English League South]] and then in Section B of the [[British Hockey League]]. In [[1983]] the British Hockey League reconstituted itself into the first truely national ice hockey league for twenty-three years and Nottingham became one of nine founder members of the league's Premier Division. The Panthers were one of the best supported teams in the league with games regularly selling out<ref>http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Players/kewardg.htm</ref> but success on the ice eluded them as the team struggled against more established opponents such as the [[Durham Wasps]] and the [[Murrayfield Racers]]. It wasn't until the appointment of [[Alex Dampier]] as coach in [[1985]] that the team's fortunes began to change and in his first season Nottingham qualified for their first post season since reforming. Unfortunately the Panthers lost each of their four of their quarter final group games and failed to advance to the Finals at [[Wembley Arena]].

In [[1986]] Nottingham secured their first trophy since reforming and their first in thiry years when they defeated the [[Fife Flyers]] 5-4 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] to win the [[Autumn Cup|Norwich Union Trophy]] at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC]] in [[Birmingham]] in front of a crowd of 5,600. Layton Eratt scored the winning goal after 01.53 of the extra session after a topsy turvy game that had seen both the Panthers and the Flyers lead the game twice.<ref>{{cite web | title=Nottingham Panthers 5-4 Fife Flyers| work=Gamesheet of the 1986 Norwich Union Trophy final| url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Gamesheets/86n15.htm | accessdate=November 30th | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> In the league Nottingham again succeeded in qualifying for the playoffs but again failed to register a win. The team repeated this in the [[British Championship|Championships]] of the following season bringing the number of consecutive playoff defeats to twelve.

In [[1988]]-[[1989|89]] the Panthers enjoyed their most successful season since reforming. Their third place finish in the league was their highest to date and in the playoffs the team were not only able a finally register a win they also qualified for the finals at Wembley. Here they defeated the [[Whitley Warriors]] 8-6 in the semi final before defeating the [[Ayr Bruins]] 6-3 in the Grand Final the following day, clinching their first and thus far only Championship title. Another Autumn Cup title followed in [[1991]] but Dampier left the club in [[1993]] to join the newly formed [[Sheffield Steelers]]. He was replaced by [[Mike Blaisdell]] who would lead the side for the next six years.

Blaisdell assembled a strong team in his second year in charge and in [[December]] [[1994]] the Panthers lifted the [[Benson & Hedges Cup (UK Ice Hockey)|Benson & Hedges Cup]] with a 7-2 vctory in the final over the [[Cardiff Devils]]. Despite going on a twenty one game beaten run Nottingham failed to claim the league title and the team were further disappointed when they were eliminated from the playoffs at the semi final stage. During the [[1995]]-[[1996|96]] season the Panthers advanced to the Benson & Hedges Cup final and Championship final but were defeated on each occasion by the Steelers.

In [[1996]] the Panthers became a founder member of the new [[Ice Hockey Superleague]]. Many of the [[United Kingdom|British]] players that had stared for Nottingham who had played for the club's youth development system were dropped in favour of [[North America|North American]] imports in a league which abolished the [[Wage cap|wage cap]] and remaining restrictions on the number of none-British trained players a club was allowed. Of Nottingham's locally trained contingent only Randall Weber, Ashley Tait and Simon Hunt were retained.<ref>{{cite web | title=1996-97 Player Stats| work=Player Statistics for Panthers players during the 1996-97 season| url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/96-97.htm#Player%20Stats | accessdate=December 4th | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> In came Trevor Robins, the club's first import goaltender since reforming and forwards Marty Dallman, Derek Laxdal and Darryl Olsen. The Panthers again started the season strongly, qualifying for the Benson & Hedges Cup final for the third straight season thanks to a strong preliminary group campain and 6-3 aggregate victory over arch rivals Sheffield in the semi final. In the final they defeated the [[Ayr Scottish Eagles]] 5-3, with Nottingham taking the lead at 00.29 and never relinquishing it.<ref>http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Gamesheets/96d7.htm</ref> After a fourth placed finish in the league the Panthers successful qualified for the Superleague's first playoff finals weekend in [[Manchester]]. In the semi finals they again faced Ayr and this time were involved in the longest game in the history of British ice hockey<ref>Mike Chambers, Nottingham Panthers Statistical Guidebook 1946-2000</ref> with the match finishing 5-5 after regulation time and each of the following five periods of ten minute [[overtime (sport)|overtime]] finishing goalless. Only in the sixth period of overtime with the two hour mark of the match beckoning, did Jeff Hoad finally score the winner for Nottingham ending the game after 115 minutes and 49 seconds.<ref>http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Gamesheets/97m22.htm</ref> In the final the Panthers met their arch rivals Sheffield where they defeated 3-1 after taking an early lead.

During the summer of [[1997]] the Panthers changed ownership when Neil Black, a [[London]] buisnessman tookover the club. Severe financial problems which lead to the sale meant that Blaisdell was unable to assemble a competitive team. In [[1998]] however the Panthers signed one of their strongest ever line-ups. In the Benson & Hedges Cup the Panthers easily qualifed from their group before memorably defeating the [[Manchester Storm]] in the semi finals despite being plagued by injuries and facing a full strength Storm side. The final saw the Panthers taking on the [[Ayr Scottish Eagles]] in a repeat of the [[1996]] final. Here Nottingham came from behind to defeat the Eagles 2-1 with [[Finland|Finn]] Pekka Virta scoring both goals.<ref>http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Gamesheets/98d5.htm</ref> In the league the Panthers finished a credible third, twelve points behind champions Manchester. The team also performed strongly in the Challenge Cup and playoffs advancing to the finals of both competitions but were defeated in each, losing 4-0 to their bitter rival Sheffield in the Challenge Cup despite outshooting their opponents 39-24 and 2-1 to Cardiff in the Championship final despite outshooting the Devils 36-24<ref>Mike Chambers, Nottingham Panthers Statistical Guidebook 1946-2000</ref> During the course of the season Paul Adey and Greg Hadden scored 141 points between them, four players scored more than twenty goals, six players earned more than thirty assists and seven players achieved thirty or more points.<ref>http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/98-99.htm#PLAYER STATS</ref>

[[Image:98b&hcup.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Panthers celebrate their 1998 Benson & Hedges Cup victory]]
In [[1999]] the club lost several players. The organisation was preparing to relocate to a new arena and chairman Neil Black wanted the team on a firm financial footing before the move. Paul Adey ended an eleven year playing career with Nottingham and left for [[Italy]], Trevor Robins was tempted away to join the [[London Knights (UK)|London Knights]] and the Panthers were unable to retain the services of many of the highest earners on the team. As a result Blaisdell could only sign a weakened side, something which clearly frustrated him. In October the Sheffield Steelers became interested in employing him as coach and Blaisdell walked out on Nottingham in acriminious circumstances ending a six year association with the Panthers which had delivered three Benson & Hedges Cups and numerous other finals.<ref>http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/99-00.htm</ref> The Panthers turned to the man who Blaisdell replaced to coach the team for the remainder of the season with Alex Dampier joining the club from the [[Newcastle Riverkings]]. Lacking the spending power of many of their rivals Nottingham could only finish sixth in the eight team league. The club faired better in the Challenge Cup where it made the final for the second successive year but the team were defeated 2-1 at [[London Arena]] by Mike Blaisdell's Steelers. In March 2000 the Panthers played their last ever game at the Ice Stadium before it's demolition hosting the Newcastle Riverkings. Jamie Leach scored Nottingham's final goal at their home of fifty-four years but the club were defeated 2-1 in [[overtime (sport)|overtime]].<ref>http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Gamesheets/2000m22.htm</ref>

===2000-Present: The Arena Era===

The Panthers moved to the brand new [[National Ice Centre (UK)|National Ice Centre]] in [[September]] [[2000]]. Although the building held more than double the capacity of their old rink and [[sports attendance|attendance]] levels increased by 72%,<ref>http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2000-01.htm#summary</ref> the team endured a terrible season. They barely scraped into the elimination rounds of the [[Benson & Hedges Cup (UK Ice Hockey)|Benson & Hedges Cup]], and were [[single-elimination tournament|knocked out]] at the semi final stage by the Steelers. In the league the Panthers suffered a dire first half of the season and, by [[Christmas]], the team were at the foot of the table, with the prospect of not qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in eleven years a distinct possibility. Form improved during the second half of the season, and the team won five of their first seven home games during [[2001]] including a 6-4 victory over the Sheffield Steelers marred by a violent bench clearance brawl.<ref>{{cite web| author = BBC | title = Brawl taints Panthers' victory | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1163606.stm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-29 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 2001 }}</ref> By the end of the season, Nottingham had given themselves a good chance of qualifying for the playoffs and in their final game faced the [[Newcastle Jesters]] in a crucial match between eighth and ninth. Panthers required a win in regulation time, something they had not done away from their own ice all season, the Jesters needed only to draw. With 10.1 seconds to go the game was locked at 2-2 with the Panthers seemingly out, but after winning a [[faceoff]] next to the Newcastle goal and with an [[extra attacker]], Robert Nordmark scored with 4.4 seconds remaining to take the Panthers into the playoffs and cruelly eliminate Newcastle.<ref>{{cite web | author = BBC | title =  Panthers progress in dramatic finale |  url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1202464.stm | year = 2006 | accessdate 2006-12-29 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 2001}}</ref> Their dramatic qualification for the playoffs failed to inspire the team and their 5-0 win over a financially troubled Sheffield Steelers was the only victory of the post season.

[[Image:The City of Nottingham - Summer 04 044.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The National Ice Centre - Nottingham's home since 2000]]

Panthers supporters hoped for better the following season as numerous changes were made to the playing staff and goalscoring legend Paul Adey returning to the club as coach. Nottingham would eventually finish in fourth place in a league now reduced to seven members, two points off the second placed [[Ayr Scottish Eagles]] but a distant twenty-three points behind champions [[Belfast Giants]]. In the Championships the Panthers won only once in the preliminary stages and finished sixth overall. The highlight of the season came in a challenge game against [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] on [[Boxing Day]] which saw the Panthers hold the [[Russia|Russian]] side to a 3-3 draw.

In [[2003]] the [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] collapsed after financial problems left it with only five members<ref>{{cite web| author = BBC | title = Eagles forced out | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/2477323.stm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-07-02 | publisher = bbc.co.uk |date = 2002 }}</ref> and facing the prospect of having only three.<ref>{{cite web| author = BBC | title  = Bees to quit Superleague | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/2535681.stm | year 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-27 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 2002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author = London Knights | title =  The Knights' Future |  url = http://www.londonknights.co.uk/archives/news_archive_knights_future.htm | year = 2006 | accessdate 2006-12-31 | publisher = londonknights.co.uk | date = 2003}}</ref>In a greatly weakened league the Panthers generally disappointed finishing the league season in third place, losing 3-2 in the [[Challenge Cup (UK Ice Hockey)|Challenge Cup]] final to the Steelers and being eliminated 4-3 in the semi finals of the playoffs by the [[London Knights (UK)|London Knights]], who scored the winning goal with just 0.2 seconds remaining.

After a turbulent summer which saw uncertainty over which league the Panthers would be taking part in<ref>{{cite web| author = Sport Focus | title = Governing Body Decline to Affiliate Elite League | url = http://www.sportfocus.com/newspub/story.cfm?id=2530 | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-06-25 | publisher = sportfocus.com |date = 2003 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author = BBC | title = Elite League "will go ahead" | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/2952464.stm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-07-02 | publisher = BBC News |date = 2003 }}</ref> and even uncertainty over the future of the club itself<ref>{{cite web| author = Panthers History | title = Nottingham Panthers 2003-04 season information | url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2003-04.htm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-29 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) |date = 2003 }}</ref>, Nottingham became a founder member of the new [[Elite Ice Hockey League]]. Changes to regulations regarding the number of non [[United Kingdom|British]] trained players and a lower [[wage cap]] necessitated numerous changes to the squad and in came a number of highly rated British players including [[forward (ice hockey)|forwards]] David Clarke and Marc Levers and several new imports including [[Finland|Finns]] Kim Ahlroos and Mikko Koivunoro and [[Canada|Canadian]] John Craighead. The new team started strongly and by the end of the year Nottingham were top of the table. However they struggled against arch rivals and chief opponents Sheffield Steelers who were able to overtake the team after a string of wins over the Panthers, before establishing a commanding lead at the top of the table. Eventually Nottingham finished in second place, their highest league finish in twelve years. The team also qualified for the Challenge Cup final after a dominating 11-5 aggregate victory over the Giants in the semi final. Their final opponent in the two-legged final was again the Steelers, a team that Nottingham had failed to beat in each of the six previous finals between the two clubs. The first leg ended as a 1-1 draw in [[Nottingham]], with David Clarke scoring for the home side. In the second leg at [[Sheffield Arena]] the Panthers raced into an early two goal lead however Sheffield dominated much of the remainder of the game and eventually levelled the score, forcing [[overtime (sport)|overtime]]. After only 00.53 of the extra session Kim Ahlroos ended years of hurt and misery by scoring the winning goal, ending an eight year wait for the Panthers to beat the Steelers in a showpiece final, and securing the club's first silverware for six seasons.<ref>{{cite web| author = Panthers History | title = Challenge Cup Final Second Leg gamesheet| url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Gamesheets/2004m17.htm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-29 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) |date = 2004 }}</ref> The Panthers followed up their trophy win with a strong playoff campain, but after a 6-1 win over the [[Manchester Phoenix]] in the semi final, the Steelers avenged their Cup defeat with a narrow 2-1 win in the Grand Final.

Their Challenge Cup success saw them earn a place in the [[Continental Cup]], the first competative foray into [[Europe|European]] competition since [[1956]]. The Panthers were placed into a group with host team [[Gothiques d'Amiens]], [[Italy|Italian]] side [[HC Milano Vipers|Milano Vipers]] and [[Slovenia|Slovenian]] side [[Olimpia Ljubljana]]. Nottingham drew their first game against Milan before recording 1-0 and 3-1 victories over the Slovenes and French respectively and narrowly missed out on a place in the second round of the competition due to Milan's better goal difference. Domestically the team struggled for much of season and only in the end of season playoffs did the Panthers replicate the form they showed in Europe where despite being depleted by injuries they qualified for the a second successive Grand Final, losing 2-1 in overtime to eventual [[Grand Slam]] winners [[Coventry Blaze]].<ref>{{cite web| author = Panthers History | title = 2004-05 Playoff summary| url = http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.walch/Years/2004-05.htm#PLAY%20OFFS | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 | publisher = Peter Walch (Panthers History) |date = 2005 }}</ref>

In the summer of [[2005]] Paul Adey left his position as coach and was suprisingly replaced by former coach [[Mike Blaisdell]]. Despite such a high profile signing of the winningest coach in [[United Kingdom|British]] ice hockey history<ref>{{cite web| author = Ice Hockey Journalists UK | title = Mike Blaisdell| url = http://www.ihjuk.co.uk/hall_of_fame/blaisdell.htm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 | publisher = Ice Hockey Journalists UK |date = 2004 }}</ref> the Panthers could only finish third in the league and failed to reach the finals weekend for the first time since [[2002]].
