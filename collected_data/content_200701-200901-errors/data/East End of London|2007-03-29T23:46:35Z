The '''East End of London''', known locally as the ''East End'', generally refers to the area of [[London]], [[England]], east of the medieval '[[City of London]]' and north of the [[River Thames]], although it is not defined by universally accepted formal boundaries.  Use of the term began in the late 19th Century.<ref>Mills, A., ''Oxford Dictionary of London Place Names'', (2000)</ref>

== Origin and scope ==
The term ''East End'' was first applied to the districts immediately to the east of, and entirely outside, the [[medieval]] walled [[City of London]] and north of the [[River Thames]]; these included  [[Whitechapel]] and [[Stepney]]. By the late 19th century, the East End roughly corresponded to the [[Tower division]] of [[Middlesex]] which from 1900 formed the [[metropolitan borough]]s of [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney|Stepney]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green|Bethnal Green]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar|Poplar]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch|Shoreditch]] in the [[County of London]].  Today it corresponds to the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] and the southern part of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]].<ref name=palmer><cite>Alan Palmer - "The East End", John Murray, London (1989)</ref> 

<blockquote>''[The] invention about 1880 of the term '''East End''' was rapidly taken up by the new halfpenny press, and in the pulpit and the music hall ... A shabby man from Paddington, St Marylebone or Battersea might pass muster as one of the respectable poor. But the same man coming from Bethnal Green, Shadwell or Wapping was an '''East Ender''', the box of Keating's bug powder must be reached for, and the spoons locked up. In the long run this cruel stigma came to do good. It was a final incentive to the poorest to get out of the '''East End''' at all costs, and it became a concentrated reminder to the public conscience that nothing to be found in the '''East End''' should be tolerated in a Christian country.''<ref><cite>The Nineteenth Century XXIV (1888) p.292; in William Fishman, East End 1888 (1998) p.1</ref></blockquote>

Parts of the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]] and [[London Borough of Waltham Forest|Waltham Forest]], formerly in an area of [[Essex]] known as ''London over the border'', are sometimes considered to be in the East End. However, the [[River Lee (England)|River Lee]] is often considered to be the eastern boundary of the East End and this definition would exclude the boroughs but place them in [[East London, England|East London]]. The common extension of the term further east is probably due to the ''diaspora'' of East Enders who moved to suburban east London, in particular the new estates at [[Becontree]] and [[Harold Hill]], or otherwise left London entirely.

== History ==
[[image:1745 Roque Map.jpg|thumb|250px|right|1745 Roque Map of the East End. London is expanding, but there are still large areas of fields to the East of the City.]]
The East End came into being as the separate villages east of London spread and the fields between them were built upon, a process which occurred in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. From the beginning, the East End has always contained some of the poorest areas of London.
The main reasons for this include
*the [[medieval]] system of [[copyhold]], that prevailed throughout the East End, into the [[19th century]]. Essentially, there was little point in developing land that was held on short leases.<ref name=palmer/>
*the siting of noxious industries, such as [[tanning]] and [[fulling]] outside the boundaries of the City, and thence beyond complaints and official controls
*the low paid employment in the [[London Docklands|docks]] and related industries; made worse by the trade practices of outwork, [[piecework]] and casual labour.
*and the relocation of the ruling court and national political epicentre to [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]], on the opposite western side of the [[City of London]].

===Politics and social reform===
[[image:1882 Reynolds Map.jpg|thumb|250px|left|1882 Reynolds Map of the East End. Development has now completely eliminated the open fields.]]
At the end of the [[17th century]] large numbers of [[Huguenot]] weavers arrived in the East End, settling to service an industry that grew up around the new estate at [[Spitalfields]], where master weavers were based. They brought with them a tradition of ''reading clubs'', where books were read, often in [[public houses]]. The authorities were suspicious of immigrants meeting, and in some ways they were right, as these grew into workers' associations and political organisations. When, towards the middle of the [[18th century]], the silk industry fell into a decline - partly due to the introduction of printed [[Calico (fabric)|calico]] cloth, riots ensued. These ''[[Spitalfield Riots]]'' of [[1769]] were actually centred to the east, and were put down with considerable force, culminating in two men being hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball public house at [[Bethnal Green]]; one was John Doyle (an [[Irish people|Irish]] weaver), the other John Valline (of Huguenot descent).<ref><cite>[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/corporation/lma_learning/schoolmate/Irish/sm_irish_stories_detail.asp?ID=246 The Spitalfields Riots 1769 at London Metropolitan Archives] accessed on 10 November 2006</ref>

[[William Booth]] began his ''Christian Revival Society'', preaching the gospel in a tent, erected in the ''Friends Burial Ground'', Thomas Street, [[Whitechapel]] in 1865. Others joined his ''Christian Mission'', and on [[August 7]], [[1878]] the [[Salvation Army]] was formed at a meeting held at 272 Whitechapel Road.<ref><cite>[http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/titles/1878_Foundation_Deed_Of_The_Salvation_Army 1878 Foundation Deed Of The Salvation Army] accessed 15 Feb 2007</ref> A statue commemorates both his mission and his work in helping the poor.

In 1884 the [[Settlement movement]] was founded, with settlements such as [[Toynbee Hall]] and Oxford House encouraging university students to live and work in the [[slums]] to experience life and try to alleviate some of the poverty and misery in the East End. In [[1888]] the matchgirls of [[London matchgirls strike of 1888|Bryant and May]], in [[Bow, London|Bow]] struck for better working conditions. This, combined with the many [[London Dock Strike of 1889|dock strikes]] in the same era, made the East End a key element in the foundation of modern [[socialist]] and [[trade union]] organisations, as well as the [[Suffragette]] movement.<ref name=fishman><cite>William Fishman, East End 1888 (1998)</ref>

Towards the end of the [[19th century]], a new wave of radicalism came to the East End, arriving both with [[Jewish]] [[émigré]]s fleeing from Eastern European persecution, and [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Germans|German]] radicals avoiding arrest. A German émigré, [[Rudolf Rocker]], began writing in [[Yiddish]] for ''[[Arbayter Fraynd]]'' (Workers' Friend); by [[1912]] he had organised a London garment workers' strike for better conditions and an end to ''[[Sweatshop|sweating]]''.<ref><cite>East End Jewish Radicals 1875-1914 - William J Fishman (2004)</ref> Amongst the Russians were such luminaries as [[Peter Kropotkin]], the anarchist. [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] all attended meetings of the socialist newspaper ''[[Iskra]]'' in [[1903]]; a few years later they met in a warehouse in [[Whitechapel]] to plot the [[October Revolution]]. [[George Gapon]], of the Assembly of Russian Workers, fled the failure of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] to seek sanctuary in [[Stepney Green]].<ref><cite>[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/battleship%20potemkin.htm The Battleship Potemkin and Stepney Green - EastLondonHistory] accessed on 10 November 2006</ref>

By the 1880s, the casual system caused Dock workers to unionise under [[Ben Tillett]] and [[John Burns]].<ref>John Burns is commemorated in the name given to a current [[Woolwich Ferry]])</ref> This lead to a demand for ''6d per hour'' (2.5p), and an end to casual labour in the docks. After a bitter struggle, the [[London Dock Strike of 1889]] was settled with victory for the strikers, and established a national movement for the unionisation of casual workers, as opposed to the [[craft union]]s that already existed. 

The philanthropist [[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Angela Burdett-Coutts]] was active in the East End, alleviating poverty by founding a sewing school for ex-weavers in [[Spitalfields]] and building the ornate [[Columbia Road Market|Columbia Market]] in [[Bethnal Green]]. She helped to inaugurate the [[NSPCC|London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]], and was a keen supporter of the [[Ragged School Union]],<ref><cite>[[Angela Georinga Burdett Coutts - National Dictionary of Biography]] accessed 3 Feb 2007</ref> and founded institutions such as the East End Dwelling Company. This latter, led to the foundation of organisations such as the ''3% Dwelling Company'', where investors received a financial return on their philanthropy.<ref><cite>[http://fathom.lse.ac.uk/Seminars/21701744/index.html Social Policy: From the Victorians to the Present Day - Susan Morris (LSE seminars)] accessed 10 Nov 2006</ref> Between the [[1890]]s and [[1903]], when the work was published, the social campaigner [[Charles Booth]] instigated an investigation into the life of London poor, much of which was centred on the poverty and conditions in the East End.<ref><cite>Life and Labour of the People in London (London: Macmillan, 1902-1903) at [http://booth.lse.ac.uk/ The Charles Booth on-line archive] accessed 10 Nov 2006</ref>

[[Image:Sylvia Pankhurst 1909.jpeg|thumb|Sylvia Pankhurst 1882-1960]]
[[Sylvia Pankhurst]] became increasingly disillusioned with the [[suffragette]] movement's inability to engage with the needs of working class women, so in [[1912]] she formed her own breakaway movement, the [[East London Federation of Suffragettes#East London Federation of Suffragettes|East London Federation of Suffragettes]] and based it at a baker's shop at [[Bow, London|Bow]], emblazoned with the famous slogan "[[Votes for Women]]" in large gold letters. The local Member of Parliament, [[George Lansbury]], resigned his seat in [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] to stand for election on a platform of women's enfranchisement. Sylvia supported him in this and Bow Road became the campaign office, culminating in a huge rally in nearby [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]], but Lansbury was narrowly defeated in the election and support for the project in the East End was withdrawn. Sylvia refocused her efforts, and with the outbreak of [[World War I]], began a nursery, clinic and cost price canteen for the poor at the bakery. A paper, the [[Women's Dreadnought]], was published to bring her campaign to a wider audience. Pankhurst spent twelve years in Bow, fighting for women's rights. During this time, she risked constant arrest and spent many months in [[Holloway Prison]], often on [[hunger strike]]. She finally achieved her aim of full adult female [[suffrage]] in [[1928]], but along the way had alleviated some of the poverty and misery, and improved social conditions for all in the East End.

The alleviation of widespread unemployment and hunger in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]] had to be funded from money raised by the borough itself under the [[Poor Law]]. The poverty of the borough made this patently unfair and lead to the [[1921]] conflict between government and the local councillors known as the [[Poplar Rates Rebellion]]. Council meetings were for a time held in Brixton prison, and the councillors received wide support.<ref><cite>"Poplarism, 1919-25: George Lansbury and the Councillors' Revolt" - Noreen Branson (1980)</ref> Ultimately, this led to the abolition of the Poor Laws through the [[Local Government Act 1929]].

===Industry and built environment===
Building on an adhoc basis could never keep up with the needs of the expanding population, and already in [[1890]] slum clearance programmes had begun.  One was  the creation of the world's first council housing, the [[London County Council|LCC]] [[Boundary Estate]], which replaced the neglected and crowded streets of Friars Mount, better known as The Old Nichol Street [[Rookery (slum)|Rookery]].<ref>Taylor, R., ''Walks Through History: Exploring the East End'', (2001)</ref>

Industries associated with the sea developed throughout the East End, including rope making and ship building. The former location of roperies can still be identified from their long straight, narrow profile in the modern streets, for instance Ropery Street near [[Mile End]]. Shipbuilding was important from the time when [[Henry VIII]] caused ships to be built at [[Rotherhithe]] as a part of his navy. A shipyard at [[Blackwall]] became the basis for the  [[British East India Company|East India Company]] dock established there. On [[January 31]], [[1858]], the largest ship of that time, the [[SS Great Eastern]] designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], was launched from the yard of Messrs Scott, Russell & Co, of [[Millwall]]. The 211 metre (692 ft) length was too wide for the river, and the ship had to be launched sideways. Due to the technical difficulties of the launch, this was the last big ship to be built on the River, and the industry fell into a decline.

The [[River Lee (England)]] was a smaller boundary than the [[Thames]], but it was a significant one. The building of the [[Royal Docks]] between [[1880]] and [[1921]] on the [[estuary]] marshes extended the continuous development of London across the Lee for the first time. Railways were driven through the East End slums at the same time, providing access to new suburbs created in [[West Ham]] and [[East Ham]]; the latter was set up to serve the new Gas Light and Coke Company and [[Joseph Bazalgette|Bazalgette's]] grand sewage works at [[Beckton]].

Traditionally the home of London's [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s and a large part of its [[industry]], especially industries based on processing foodstuffs and other imported raw materials, the area was a continuous target during the [[the Blitz|blitz]] of [[World War II]]. Post-war, specifically [[1950]]'s and [[1960]]'s, architecture dominates the housing estates of the area, such as the [[Lansbury Estate]] in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], which was built as a showpiece of the [[1951]] [[Festival of Britain]].

From the mid [[20th century]], the docks declined in use and were finally closed in [[1980]]. London's main port is now at [[Tilbury]] further down the [[Thames]] estuary, outside the boundary of Greater London.

===Population===
[[image:Brick Lane 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Brick Lane has always been a centre for new immigration, welcoming Huguenots, Jews, and Bangladeshi communities in successive centuries (Sep 2005)]]
Throughout history the area has absorbed waves of [[immigrants]] who have each added a new dimension to the culture and history of the area, most notably the French Protestant [[Huguenot]]s, the [[Irish people|Irish]], the [[Jew]]s and the [[Bangladeshi]] communities. 
 
Community tensions have been raised by racist events such as an anti-semitic [[British Union of Fascists|Fascist]] march in 1936 (blocked by residents and activists at the [[Battle of Cable Street]]), anti-Asian violence, more recently anti-white violence, a council seat win for the [[British National Party]] in 1993 (since lost) and the [[David Copeland|1999 bombing]] in [[Brick Lane]]. 

During the [[interwar period]] there was a decline in population in the East End caused by migration to the suburbs and to areas outside London. This accelerated after [[World War II]] and has only recently started to reverse. These population figures are for the area that now forms the London Borough of Tower Hamlets only:

===Criminality===
Due to the rampant poverty in the East End, crime has always been a potential career option. From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and in transit to the City warehouses. This was why, in the 17th century, the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] built high-walled, guarded docks at [[Blackwall]] to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practise led to the creation of ever larger docks throughout the area, and for large roads to be driven through the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.<ref name=palmer/>

Said to be England's first, the [[Marine Police Force]] was formed by magistrate Patrick Colquhoun and a Master Mariner, John Harriott, in [[1798]] to tackle theft and looting from ships anchored in the [[Pool of London]] and the lower reaches of the river. Its base was (and remains) in [[Wapping]] High Street, it is now known as the [[Marine Support Unit]].<ref><cite>[http://www.met.police.uk/msu/history.htm History of the Marine Support Unit (Met)] accessed 24 Jan 2007</ref>

High profile crimes in the area include the [[Ratcliff Highway murders]] (1813); the killings committed by the [[London Burkers]] (apparently inspired by [[Burke and Hare]]) in [[Bethnal Green]] (1831); the notorious serial killings of [[prostitutes]] by [[Jack the Ripper]]<ref name=fishman/> (1888); and the [[Sidney Street Siege]] ([[1911]]) (in which anarchists, inspired by the legendary [[Peter the Painter]], took on Home Secretary [[Winston Churchill]], and the army). In the [[1960s]] the East End was the area most associated with [[gangster]] activity, most notably that of the [[Kray twins]].<ref><cite>"Inside the Firm: The Untold Story of the Krays' Reign of Terror" - Tony Lambrianou (2002)</ref>
===Disasters===
[[Image:Princess alice collision in thames.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|1878 drawing. The''Bywell Castle'' bears down upon the ''Princess Alice''.]]
Many disasters have befallen the residents of the East End, both in war and in peace.
*The ''[[Princess Alice]]'' was a passenger [[steam ship|steamer]] crowded with day trippers returning from [[Gravesend]] to [[Woolwich]] and [[London Bridge]]. On the evening of [[September 3]], [[1878]], she collided with the steam [[collier]] ''Bywell Castle'' (named for [[Bywell Castle]]) and sank into the [[Thames]] in under four minutes. Of the approximately 700 passengers, over 600 were lost.
*On [[January 19]], [[1917]] 73 people died, including 14 workers, and more than 400 injured, by a [[Silvertown explosion|TNT explosion]] in the Brunner-Mond munitions factory in [[Silvertown]]. Much of the area was flattened, and the shock wave was felt throughout the city, and much of [[Essex]]. This was the largest explosion in London, and was heard in [[Southampton]] and [[Norwich]]. Andreas Angel, chief chemist at the plant, was posthumously awarded the [[Edward Medal]], for trying to extinguish the fire that caused the blast.
*On [[June 13]], [[1917]], a German bomb from a [[Gotha G|Gotha]] bomber killed 18 children in their primary school at [[Poplar, London]], East London. This is commemorated by the Poplar war memorial.
*On [[March 3]], [[1943]] at 8:27PM the unopened [[Bethnal Green tube station]] was the site of a wartime disaster. Families had crowded into the underground station due to an air raid siren at 8:17, one of 10 that day.  There was a panic at 8:27 coinciding with the sound of an anti-aircraft battery (possibly the recently installed [[Z battery]]) being fired at nearby [[Victoria Park, East London|Victora Park]].  In the wet, dark conditions, a woman slipped on the entrance stairs and 173 people died in the resulting crush. The truth was suppressed, and a report appeared that there had been a direct hit by a German bomb.  The results of the official investigation weren't released until 1946.<ref><cite>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/homeground/archive/2003/bethnal-green-tube-disaster.shtml Bethnal Green tube disaster] (BBC Homeground) accessed 15 Feb 2007</ref> There is now a plaque at the entrance to the tube station, which commemorates it as the worst civilian disaster of [[World War II]].

===Theatres===
In the 19th century the theatres of the East End rivalled in their grandiosity and seating capacity those of the [[West End]]. They are now, however, almost wholly defunct. The first of this era was the ill-fated Brunswick Theatre (1828), which collapsed three days after opening, killing 15 people. This was followed by the opening of the Pavilion (1828) in [[Whitechapel]], the [[Garrick Theatre (Leman St)|Garrick]] (1831) in Leman Street, the Effingham (1834) in Whitechapel, the Standard (1835) in [[Shoreditch]], the City of London (1837) in [[Norton Folgate]], then the Grecian and the [[Britannia Theatre]] in [[Hoxton]]. Though very popular for a time, from the 1860s onwards these theatres, one by one, began to close, the buildings were demolished and their very memory began to fade.<ref>Michael Booth (1991) ''Theatre in the Victorian Age'': 4-6. CUP</ref>

===Music halls===
The once popular [[music hall]]s of the East End have mostly met the same fate as the theatres. Prominent examples included the London Music Hall, 95-99 Shoreditch High Street, (1856-1935) and the Royal Cambridge Music Hall, 136 [[Commercial Street]] (1864-1936). [[Wilton's Music Hall]] has, however, been restored and still survives. The music-hall artiste the "one and only" [[Marie Lloyd]], born in [[Hoxton]] is still an East End legend, and the songs she made popular are still, occasionally, sung in local pubs.

== Today ==
[[image:Canary Wharf complex.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Redevelopment of Isle of Dogs]]
Some parts of the East End have been subject to a number of [[urban renewal|urban regeneration]] projects, most notably [[Canary Wharf]], a huge commercial and housing development on the [[Isle of Dogs]]. Many of the [[1960s]] tower blocks have been demolished or have been renovated. The area around [[Old Spitalfields market]] and [[Brick Lane]] has been extensively regenerated and is famous, amongst other things, as London's curry capital, as well as being the home of a number of London's art galleries, including the famous [[Whitechapel Gallery]].

Much of the area remains, however, one of the poorest in Britain and contains some of the capital's worst deprivation. This is in spite of rising property prices, and the extensive building of luxury apartments, centred largely around the dock areas and alongside the Thames. With rising costs elsewhere in the capital, the East End has become a desirable place for business.
