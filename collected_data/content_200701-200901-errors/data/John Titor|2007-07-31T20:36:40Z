'''John Titor''' is the name used by the person or persons claiming to be a [[time travel]]er from the year 2036 who posted on several time-travel–related [[bulletin board]]s during 2000/2001. In these posts he made numerous ambiguous predictions about events in the near future, starting with events in 2004.

Whether John Titor was a [[hoax]] or not has been a topic of controversy on web-based [[Anomalous phenomenon|paranormal]] [[Internet forum|discussion board]]s and has never been proven or disproven. He has also been discussed occasionally on the radio show [[Coast to Coast AM]]<ref>[http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2004/08/06.html John Titor, Recap]</ref>.

==Titor's claims==
Most of the [[BBS|electronic bulletin board posts]] made by "John Titor" no longer exist. Titor posts appeared at ''Time Travel Institute,'' ''Anomalies Net'', and ''Time Travel Portal'', among other places. Darby @ Anomalies Network has copied the Titor-related threads from these bulletin boards. Titor made his first post there as "TimeTravel_0". More recently the story has been collected into a number of more "narrative" web sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johntitor.com|title=John Titor - Time Traveler|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

===Origins===
When asked if John Titor was his real name, he responded that John Titor is ''a'' real name.
    
In his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from the year 2036, based in [[Tampa, Florida]] in [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]], who was assigned to a [[government]]al time travel project. He was supposedly sent back to the year of 1975 to retrieve an [[IBM 5100]] computer which he claimed was needed to "[[debug]]" various legacy computer programs in 2036. [[UNIX]] will, according to him, have a timeout error in [[2038 problem|2038]]. The 5100 has the ability to easily translate between the old IBM code, [[APL]], and [[BASIC]] programming languages.

Titor had been selected for this mission specifically due to the fact his paternal grandfather was directly involved with the building and programming of the 5100.

Titor claimed to be on a stopover in the year 2000 for 'personal reasons', which may have involved warning his family of impending disasters; Titor spoke of his family often. Titor also claimed he had been, for a few months, trying to alert anyone that would listen about the threat of CJD spread through beef products and about the possibility of civil war in the [[United States]] that would begin with rising [[civil unrest]] in the year 2004. However Titor did state that all-out civil war would not occur until 2008.

Titor also had expressed an interest in unexplained mysteries when questioned about it by an online poster, such as [[UFO|UFOs]] (which in his time were still as yet unexplained).  Titor suggested that UFOs and alien visitors may well be time travelers from much further into the future than his own time, and with much more accurate time machines than his own.

===Predictions===

The postings also described various future events between 2004 and 2037, including [[World War III]] (predicted for 2015) followed by two decades of recovery.

One such entry cited escalating conflict between [[Arab]]s and [[Jew]]s as a harbinger of World War III:

:"Real disruptions in world events begin with the destabilization of [[Western world|the West]] as a result of degrading US [[foreign policy]] and consistency. [...] The Jewish population in [[Israel]] is not prepared for a true offensive war. They are prepared for the ultimate defense. Wavering western support for Israel is what gives Israel's neighbors the confidence to attack. The last resort for a defensive Israel and its offensive Arab neighbors is to use [[weapons of mass destruction]]. In the grand scheme of things, the war in the [[Middle East]] is a part of what's to come, not the cause."

Along with this report of World War III's approach, another notable claim was that of a civil war in America, which was slated to begin in 2004, around the time of the presidential election, and would escalate until 2008 which, according to Titor, is "a general date by which time everyone will realize the world they thought they were living in was over." Another claim was that 2004 would be the last year in which the [[Olympic Games]] would occur.

These are taken from [http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/the_john_titor_project.html John Titor's original statements] and summarized.
* The [[2004 Olympics]], will be the last held. All others will be cancelled due to rising global tensions.
* In the United States, civil unrest will begin mounting in 2004/2005. The people of the countryside avoid open conflict with the [[federal police]] and [[national guard]], whilst the people of the cities abandon civil liberties willingly under the guise of national security.
* A Second [[American Civil War]], lasting from 2008 to 2015, will manifest itself in a violent division between the large cities/[[urban area]]s against the countryside/[[rural areas]]. As a 13-year old, in 2011, Titor himself fought with the "Fighting Diamondbacks", a [[shotgun]] [[militia|infantry]] of [[Florida]], for at least four years. However, the ferocity of the civil war meant that Titor spent most of this time in hiding instead. Titor personally saw many die horrific deaths. Still, he had killed, yet he never shot anyone "that wasn't trying to kill him". 
* The Second American Civil War has a knock-on effect which destablises all [[Western Civilization]], both in economics and politics. This in turn assists the escalation of global conflict.
* When asked if there is about significance to the year 2012 (as equated with the ancient [[Mayan calendar]] which ends and then restarts in 2012), Titor confirmed this. An event similar to the "[[Passage of the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]]" will occur in this year, although exactly what Titor meant by this is deliberately obscure as he didn't want to "spoil the surprise" (Titor claimed he was a [[Christian]], to whom religion was greatly significant, throughout his postings).
* [[World War III]] breaks out in 2015; a gradual global political escalation that was ended by [[Russia]] bombing American, European, and [[China|Chinese]] cities. 
** Sometime before this point (referred to as "N-Day"), China forcefully annexes [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Taiwan]].
** [[Australia]] successfully repels a Chinese invasion.
** [[Russia]] declares war on at least three other [[world power]]s; these include the United States, the [[European Union]] and [[China]]. However it is not made clear whether this was in response to some form of aggression, nor is clear at what point all four powers enter the war except that China is one of the primary aggressors.
** Titor was somewhere near [[Jacksonville]] in [[Florida]] when a Russian [[nuclear warhead]] fell on it. Soon after a "loved one" contracted [[brain cancer]], a direct result of the [[nuclear fallout]], and Titor expressed his regret at "not acting soon enough".
** [[Chemical weapons|Chemical]] and [[biological weapons]] are used, and some [[Less-lethal weapons|"non-lethal" weapons]] turn out to be quite lethal.
** The political and economic structure of the European Union is utterly destroyed in the bombardment, as is also the case in China.
** Almost all major US cities are destroyed (although the only cities specifically named as being ruined are the capital [[Washington DC]], and [[Jacksonville, Florida]]). The only city stated as surviving is [[Omaha, Nebraska]].
** By the end of the war, almost 3 billion people are dead.
* Post-war 
** Communities of survivors gather and grow around [[university|universities]], renamed to "Forts" due to the prescence of army garrisons that are placed there to protect the populations.
** The United States splits into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives.
** The [[US Constitution]] is changed by a Constitutional Convention.
*** A President is elected for each of the five major areas of the US on a rotating schedule.
*** The powers of the union government are more defined and reside at the county and state level. 
*** The Vice President is elected separately.
*** The US Capital is in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].
* Life in 2036:
** [[Society]]
*** [[Military service]] plays a large part in day-to-day life.
*** [[Capital punishment]] is still implemented.
*** Communities have returned to a family/community centred state.
*** Spanish becomes more common in Texas.
** [[Economy]]
*** US [[exports]] have restarted by 2036. The main trader with the US is their old enemy, [[Russia]].
** [[Religion]] and [[Beliefs]]
*** Religion is far more personal and plays a major part in day-to-day life.
*** The [[Ten Commandments]] have been restored to the "10" that God gave [[Moses]].
*** [[Sabbatarianism]], or worship on Saturday, is a common practice. 
** [[Technology]]
*** [[Wireless network|Wireless internet]] is ubiquitous.
*** [[Television]] and [[telephony]] are delivered via the Web.
*** [[Book]]s and other hard media are now distributed online and printed from local hubs.
*** Electric power is generated on a local level with vast improvments in hydrogen and solar power production
** [[Natural environment|Environment]]
*** The environment is heavily affected by [[radiation]]. The lack of safe drinkable water is the biggest environmental issue.
*** [[Global warming]] has had little effect. Temperature is about a few degrees cooler world wide.
** [[Health]]
*** The [[birth rate]] is much lower, due to a high number of birth defects and [[stillbirth]]s.
*** Mad Cow disease, or [[vCJD]] in humans, is a devastating public health problem. Titor stated that even in the year 2000, he would not eat [[processed meat]].
*** A cure for [[AIDS]] had not been found, although large progress in the areas of curing cancer had taken place.

==Evidence of hoaxing==

An examination of the claims suggests several problems with the story.

For instance, he claims that money is widely used and they still have [[credit card]]s.  In another post he speculated that today's money would be usable in his time, but this would be after the reorganization of the federal government according to his own history, which would make the money worthless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/hoaxes/90359.html|title=Tackling John Titor, Time Traveller|date=2003-11-25|accessdate=2007-03-15}} {{Verify source|date=June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Brown|year=2003|url=http://communities.anomalies.net/forum/ubbthreads.php/ubb/showflat/Number/13443/page/1#Post13443|title=Dr. Robert Brown's Replies to Darby RE. Titor|publisher=The Anomalies Network Forums|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

The images posted by Titor are likewise problematic. The image of the [[laser pointer]]'s beam being "bent" has the obvious problem that objects around the beam are not bent. For instance, the framing of the window visible in the background shows no distortion, which would not be the case if there was a large gravity gradient in the area. Some have speculated the "beam" is a [[fiber optic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread62046/pg1|title=John Titor: Hoax|date=2004-06-26|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

Titor claimed that he was sent back to obtain an IBM 5100 because it could translate several types of computer code as well as execute some functions that IBM never informed the public about. Supporters have implied that this capability was a "secret" that was not known in 2000/1 when the posts were being made. However, this capability was actually widely known in the industry, and commented on in depth in numerous publications, both about the 5100 and APL in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/304/ibmsj3004C.pdf|year=1991|title=The IBM Family of APL Systems, IBM Systems Journal|accessdate=March 15|accessyear=2007}}</ref> References to this fact were also available on the internet as early as 1999. This is a fairly obscure bit of trivia, however, which suggests whoever was making the posts was familiar with the machine, or had an interest in [[retrocomputing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johntitor.strategicbrains.com/|title=John Titor's Story|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

Other predictions have simply proven not to be true. For instance, he stated that the [[Olympics Games]] would end with the [[2004  Olympics]], but this proved contrary to subsequent real-world events as the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] were successfully held, though some people argue that he was only talking about the Summer Games.

In light of such predictive failings supporters have speculated, ''[[logical fallacies|ex post facto]]'', that the history relayed by Titor could have referred to ''one possible'' course for the future, suggesting that humans may have since created an [[alternate future]] by going about things differently. On the other hand, any statement can be supported by this idea; therefore this is precisely the sort of unfalsifiable claim that [[Karl Popper]] noted when he developed his thoughts on [[falsifiability]]; when faced with evidence that contradicts a claim, that claim is simply modified or removed outright to fix the problem. There is no limit to the modifications that could be carried out, thereby rendering it impossible to state that the facts disagree with the claims.
In May 2007, Seattle-based dentist and time travel expert Dr. Bruce Goldberg, on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory, brought up that Titor never tipped the world off regarding September, 11 2001.

Some have stated that Titor has been proved a hoax<ref>http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread62046/pg1</ref> due to the fact that a Second American Civil War never broke out in 2004&ndash;2005. Titor claimed that these years would see the rise of great civil unrest (whether this has occurred is debatable in itself), and that actual civil war would not break out until 2008. Titor also claimed that "Waco"-like events (referring to the [[Waco Siege]] in 1993) would become commonplace<ref>http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/john_titor_archive_page7.html</ref>. In earlier posts John Titor is almost unambiguously suggesting that physical violence would begin in 2005<ref>http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/john_titor_archive_page2.html</ref>

At least one amateur author has claimed John Titor was a marketing hoax for a failed novel.<ref>http://shaunwagner.com/writings.html</ref>

==Supporters' evidence==

Some who advocate Titor's predictions have believe:

According to [[IBM]] [[engineer]] Bob Dubke, Titor's statements regarding the IBM 5100's little-known ability to [[emulation|emulate]] and debug [[mainframe]] systems were correct. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20051210175724/http://www.postbulletin.com/magazine/2004/08/index.shtml|title=Time traveller most likely to be spotted in Rochester, IBM 5100 Engineer Bob Dubke on hidden features|publisher=''Rochester Magazine''|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> It has been stated that this information was not publicly available when Titor made his declaration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johntitor.com/Pages/5100.html|year=2005|title=News about the 5100 Computer|accessdate=March 15|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

The [[2004 Summer Olympics]], held in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], will be the last held according to Titor, who predicted that there would be "no official Olympics after 2004"<ref>http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/john_titor_archive_page7.html</ref>. All others will be cancelled due to rising global tensions. If correct, this means that the projected [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]] and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] planned for [[London]], [[England]], will not take place, and would mean that John Titor was referring only to the [[Summer Olympics]], since the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] were successfully held in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. Titor never specified whether he meant the [[Summer Olympics]] or the [[Winter Olympics]], or both, using only the word [[Olympics]], however, the Olympics starting and finishing in Athens by chance would probably be sufficiently serendipitous for many to quote this about the games, casually ignoring the Winter Olympics.

This from John Titor's post dated Feb 25th 2001 at 8:00 am
"None of the things I have said will be a surprise. They were set in motion ten, twenty, even thirty years ago. Are you really surprised to find out that Iraq has nukes now or is that just BS to whip everyone up into accepting the next war?"

This made 6 months prior to 9-11 attacks, the war on terror or the US invading Iraq.
