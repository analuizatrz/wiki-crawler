The '''Wheatbelt''' region is one of the nine [[regions of Western Australia]].  It partially surrounds the [[Perth metropolitan area]], extending north from Perth to the [[Mid West (Western Australia)|Mid West]] region, and east to the [[Goldfields-Esperance]] region.  It is bordered to the south by the [[South West (Western Australia)|South West]] and [[Great Southern (Western Australia)|Great Southern]] regions, and to the west by the [[Indian Ocean]], the Perth metropolitan area, and the [[Peel (Western Australia)|Peel]] region.  Altogether, it has an area of {{convert|154862|sqkm|sqmi|0|lk=on}} (including islands), and a population of about 72,000 people.  The population is widely distributed, with only about 16,000 people living in the main towns of [[Northam, Western Australia|Northam]], [[Narrogin, Western Australia|Narrogin]], [[Merredin, Western Australia|Merredin]] and [[Moora, Western Australia|Moora]].

The Wheatbelt encompasses a range of environments and industries.  Near the coast, it receives relatively high rainfall and mild temperature, and its {{convert|150|km|mi|0|lk=on}} of coastline is a significant [[tourism|tourist]] area.  In contrast, the eastern fringe is very arid, and is mainly used for [[mining]] of minerals including [[gold]], [[nickel]] and [[iron ore]].  The remainder to the region is highly suited to [[agriculture]], and is the source of nearly two thirds of the state's [[wheat]] production, half of its [[wool]] production, and the majority of its [[lamb]] and [[sheep|mutton]], [[oranges]], [[honey]], cut flowers and a range of other agricultural and pastoral products.
