:''This article is about the Australian car manufacturer. For other uses, see [[Holden (disambiguation)]].''

'''Holden''' is an [[Australia]]n [[automaker]] based in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], originally independent but now a subsidiary of [[General Motors]]. They are the largest vehicle automaker and distributor in the Asia-Pacific region. Holden is one of GM's "alpha" brands, taking charge of vehicles and operations for General Motors in Australasia. In addition, Holden has responsibility within GM for [[GM Daewoo]] in Korea.

Over the years, Holden has offered a broad range of vehicles, the vast majority being the locally produced Holden range, with supplementary models sourced from various other parts of the General Motors empire, including [[Chevrolet]], [[Pontiac]], [[Opel]], [[Daewoo]], [[Isuzu]], [[Vauxhall]] and [[Suzuki]]. Some of these cars have been assembled locally; others have been fully imported. In addition, Holden has in the past offered rebadged [[Nissan]] and [[Toyota]] models in sharing arrangements. 

[[Holden]] cars are manufactured at [[Elizabeth]] [[South Australia]], while engines are manufactured at [[Fishermen's Bend]] in [[Melbourne]]. Historically, Holden had production or assembly plants in all mainland states of [[Australia]], including [[Pagewood]] in [[New South Wales]] and [[Acacia Ridge]] in [[Queensland]]. Consolidation of car production at [[Elizabeth]] was completed in 1986.

==Early History==
James Alexander Holden immigrated to [[South Australia]] from [[England]] in 1852 and in 1856 established J.A Holden & Co, a saddlery business in [[Adelaide]]. In 1905, Edward Wheewall Holden, James' son, entered the firm and was interested in automobiles. The firm evolved through various partnerships and in 1908, as Holden and Frost, moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery and manufacturing hoods and side curtains. In 1913 the firm began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies, and Edward Holden experimented with fitting bodies on different types of carriages. From 1917, wartime trade restrictions led to Holden & Frost commencing large scale production of car bodies. H.J Holden incorporated a new company in 1919, ''Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd'' (HMBB). Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd made bodies to suit a number of [[chassis]] imported from different manufacturers, but particularly [[Chevrolet]]. They also built Buicks. In 1931 General Motors purchased the business and formed ''General Motors–Holden's Ltd''. In 1998, it was renamed ''Holden Ltd'' and in May 2005, it became known as ''GM Holden Ltd''.

==Australia's own car==
[[Image:48-215 launch.jpg|thumb|Launch of the first Holden in November 1948 by Prime Minister [[Ben Chifley]]]]
After the end of [[World War II]], the Australian government took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry. General Motors was the only automobile manufacturer to accept the challenge to build "Australia's own car". 

Holden's managing director - [[Laurence (Larry) Hartnett]] - was particularly enthusiastic about developing and building an Australian car. 

The Holden 48/215 (also unofficially called the FX), introduced in 1948, was a medium-sized vehicle fitted with a 132&nbsp;in³ (2.15&nbsp;L) engine, and based on a design proposed for a more compact post World War II Chevrolet, that had been rejected as being too small for the US market. 

Although not particularly mechanically or stylistically sophisticated, it was simple, rugged, more powerful than most competitors, and offered exceptional performance and [[fuel economy]] in an affordable package. Better suited to Australian conditions than its competitors, and assisted by tariff barriers, it rapidly became Australia's best-selling car (from 1950 onwards), as the production capacity grew. [[Lord Nuffield]] the founder of [[Morris]], was particularly impressed by the Holden, and purchased one for examination.

==Holden in the 1950s: domination of the Australian market==

During the 1950s, Holden dominated the Australian marketplace, offering buyers a unique combination of style, comfort, performance, economy and value for money that no competitor could match. Less expensive 4 cylinder cars such as the Austin (their A40 was Australia's top selling car in 1949) did not offer Holden's rugged ability in country areas, while larger cars such as Standard's Vanguard and Ford's Zephyr were more expensive.

Another factor in Holden's success was the large investment in production capacity, which allowed Holden to take advantage of post-war demand for motor cars.

The 48/215 was produced with minor running changes until 1953, when it was replaced by the facelifted "FJ" model.

In 1950, the Holden Utility (Model 50-216) was introduced as an additional body style to supplement the 4 door sedan. The "Ute" became a ubiquitous sight in Australian rural areas, as the workhorse of choice for a generation of primary producers.

Besides providing faithful service to thousands of working people, the "ute" went on to become ingrained in Australia's identity.

The FJ was the first major change to the Holden since its 1948 introduction. Over time it gained iconic status, and remains one of Australia's most recognised and loved automotive symbols. In 2005, Holden paid homage to the FJ, when they introduced the [[Holden Efijy]] concept car at the Sydney Motor Show.

Prior to its introduction, speculation and excitement surrounded the new car.

FJ featured a new radiator grille and changes to other trim features. No changes were made to the car's body panels. The most significant mechanical change was the introduction of telescopic shock absorbers.
 
A new model, the "Special", was introduced and became the most popular model. 

While the FJ was little changed from the 48-215/FX, shrewd marketing - including strategic price cuts - kept Holden on top in the market.

The FJ was followed by a completely redesigned new model - the FE - in 1956.

FE was a very attractive car, with an entirely modern contemporary appearance. It continued to use the same mechanical components as the FJ. A station wagon model called the "Station Sedan" joined the Holden range. 

The new model cemented Holden's dominance in Australia. The FE continued until 1958, when it was lightly facelifted to become the FC.

During the 1950s, Holden achieved the remarkable feat of over 50% market share. 

In addition to manufacturing the Holden, they assembled the British [[Vauxhall]] and North American [[Chevrolet]] and [[Pontiac]].

==Holden in the 1960s: responding to the challenge of competition==
  
The 1960s marked a time of change for Holden. For the first time, they faced serious competition, as their major competitors finally sourced cars and built production capacity which allowed them to make a serious challenge to Holden's dominance.

The decade opened with Holden offering their third major new model: the FB.

Compared with the FE at the time of its introduction, the FB was a disappointment. Although its styling was inspired by the classic 1957 Chevrolet, with tailfins and a wrap around  windscreen with "dog leg" A pillars, this appearance was dated by the time the Holden was released in 1960. Also, while the 1957 Chevy was a classic, its styling did not translate well to the more compact Holden, and the styling features which were fashionable in 1957 rapidly dated.

FB also was the first model available with left-hand drive, enhancing its export potential.

In 1960, Holden faced its most serious challenge: [[Ford]]'s new [[Falcon]], which was released in Australia shortly after its introduction in the [[USA]], and only months after the FB. Side by side, the Falcon had a far more modern appearance than the FB - the Ford competitor was low and wide, with headlights incorporated in the radiator grille. Also, it was available with automatic transmission (the [[Fordomatic]] two speed).

However, the Falcon had an Achilles heel - serious durability weaknesses, particularly in the front suspension, which Holden soon exploited. Holden ran an early Falcon around their [[Lang Lang]] proving ground, then displayed the car to Holden dealers. They saw that the car was worn out by rugged use, and Falcon customers soon discovered the same problems.

While the Holden appeared dated, it had an important virtue the Falcon lacked: solid dependability.

In 1961, Holden introduced their first response to Falcon: the EK, a facelifted version of the FB. The major new feature was the availability of an automatic transmission, the US 3 speed [[Hydramatic]]. New two tone paint treatments and chrome trim could not disguise the outdated appearance of the car.

1962 saw Holden's substantive response to the Falcon challenge: the new EJ. This car had a much more modern contemporary appearance.

In 1963, Holden released a facelifted version of the EJ: the EH. The major feature of the new car was the new seven main bearing "red" engine, available in two sizes: 149 CID and 179 CID. The performance of the car was improved dramatically.

EJ and more particularly EH met the Falcon challenge in the best way possible - they were good cars - significantly better in every way than their predecessor, as well as the Falcon.

The Ford challenge dissipated, and by 1965, they were in serious trouble. Holden were well and truly on top again.

Then, two things happened in 1965 to change both Holden's and Ford's fortunes.

First, Ford presented their "back to the wall" XP. While it looked little changed from earlier Falcons, Ford Australia's Deputy Managing Director [[Bill Bourke]] introduced the new model with the "70,000 mile Durability Run". This demonstrated that Ford had improved Falcon, and it was awarded the 1965 "Wheels" Car of the Year award.

Second, Holden's momentum stumbled, when they introduced one of their least popular new models: the HD. This car's styling did not resonate favourably with the market, and it was soon facelifted in 1966, when the HR was introduced.

The HR had new front and rear styling, and larger engines (161 CID and 186 CID). HR was much more popular, with over 250,000 sales over its production run.

In 1968, Holden introduced its next major new model, the HK. This was Holden's most ambitious new model programme yet.

HK firsts included: the first Holden V-8 (the 307 CID and 327 CID [[Chevrolet]] engines was imported for the car), the first full size 2 door Holden (the [[Monaro]]), a "prestige" model - the [[Brougham]] - and the ability to "build your own" Holden through an extensive options list. Also, HK was the first Holden available with 4 headlights.

The most popular model was renamed the [[Kingswood]] (instead of the [[Special]])and the basic fleet model was renamed [[Belmont]].

1969 saw the introduction of the HT: a facelifted version of the HK. The exterior changes included a new radiator grille (the first Holden grille to be manufactured from plastic), new rear doors on sedans (with larger windows) and new rear styling, with a larger rear window, boot lid and tail lights.

A major engineering innovation was the introduction of the first Australian designed and mass produced V8 engine, available in 2 sizes: 253 CID and 308 CID. The 253 engine was marketed as Australia's first "small V8". Holden predicted that the V8 would become as popular in the Australian market as in the US. 

The following year, Holden offered the HG: a lightly facelifted car, with revised radiator grille, tail lights, interior trim and colours.

The HG's major selling point was the introduction of the new [[Tri-Matic]] 3 speed automatic transmission, which Holden commenced manufacturing at their [[Woodville]] factory in [[South Australia]] in 1969.

Despite the arrival of serious competitors in the 1960s (the [[Ford Falcon]] and [[Chrysler Valiant]] and the introduction of Japanese cars, Holden's locally-produced large six and eight-cylinder cars remained Australia's top-selling vehicles during the 1960s. 

The [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]] sedan, wagon and [[Pickup truck|ute]] (utility or pickup truck) were exported and assembled abroad, including [[New Zealand]] along with [[South Africa]] (badged as the [[Chevrolet Kommando]]), [[Indonesia]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

==Torana: the compact Holden==

Another notable Holden offering was the mid-size [[Holden Torana|Torana]], introduced in 1967, and initially based on the British HB series [[Vauxhall Viva]]. The name 'Torana' was an [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] word meaning 'to fly'.

The first Torana replaced the [[Vauxhall Viva]]. From 1964, Holden had assembled the HA series Viva, marketing the car as "Viva - the GMH small car" (de-emphasising the [[Vauxhall]] brand). 

In 1969, Holden offered a new Torana: the LC, with distinctive new styling. This was the first compact (100 inch wheelbase) six cylinder in the Australian marketplace, and it inspired a new category of cars on Australian roads. LC Torana won the 1969 "Wheels" Car of the Year award. Later, on the racetrack and in rallies around the country, it was a consistent winner, and launched the careers of talented drivers - foremost amongst these being Peter Brock.

The next development of the Torana was the LH series, which was introduced in 1974. Initially LH was offered as a 4 door sedan, with a 3-door hatchback variant offered later. LH and its successor the LX series (manufactured between 1974 and 1978) were unusual in that they were offered with a choice of four (1.9&nbsp;litre [[overhead cam|OHC]]), six (2.8&nbsp;litre, 3.3&nbsp;litre [[pushrod engine|OHV]]) or eight cylinder (4.2&nbsp;litre, 5.0&nbsp;litre OHV) engines. At the time, Torana was the only car in the world to be offered with such a choice of engines (although the US Chevy II offered this choice in the 1960s).  The four, later renamed Sunbird, was underpowered; the eight-cylinder version alarmingly fast: the six was the most popular option. 

The Torana departed from Holden's line-up in 1980. After the 1978 introduction of the new Commodore, the Torana became an "in between" car - squeezed out by the smaller and more economical Gemini and the larger, more sophisticated Commodore.

The closest successor to the Torana was the JB Camira, released in 1982. This was Australia's version of GM's medium-sized international "[[GM J platform|J-Car]]". Bodywork for the Camira wagon was engineered in Australia, and the wagon pressings were  exported to the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] estate car.

==The 1970s==
The 1970s were a period of dramatic change for Holden.

The decade opened with the launch of the new HQ series- the most important new model since the 1948 48-215.

When HQ was introduced, Holden produced all of its range of passenger cars in Australia, and every model in the range was a unique Australian design.

By the end of the decade, Holden was in transition- producing cars based on overseas designs.

'''The 1971 HQ series'''

HQ was thoroughly re-engineered- it featured a perimeter frame and semi-monocoque construction. This provided a level of refinement not seen in this class of vehicle before.

Other firsts included wide (5 foot) track, all coil suspension, an extended wheelbase for wagons, utes and panel vans and a new prestige model- the [[Statesman]], which also had the benefit of the longer wheelbase.

The HQ Monaro 2 door hardtop was acclaimed as the best looking Australian car ever produced.

HQ was intended to keep Holden at the top of the sales charts, and it did just that, despite new [[Falcon]] and [[Valiant]] models.

'''Gemini- Holden's first world car'''

In 1975, Holden introduced the [[Gemini]]- its version of the first GM [[world car]] (based on the Opel Kadett C, introduced in 1973).
Not only was Gemini an overseas design, but it was also developed jointly with [[Isuzu]], GM's Japanese affiliate. This was recognised with a badge on the rear of the car stating it was a "Holden- Isuzu". The new car was powered by the Isuzu 1.6 litre OHC engine. Styling of the Gemini was based on the Kadett, with several changes- a new radiator grille, more substantial bumpers, different tail lights and a substantially different dashboard.

Gemini was a popular car, and rapidly attained sales leadership in its class. Also, it was awarded [[Wheels]] Car of the Year. With several facelifts, it continued in production until 1985.

'''The arrival of Commodore'''

1978 saw the arrival of yet another Holden revolution- the [[Commodore]], which became Holden's new full-size car. Hitherto, each full-size Holden model was a unique design for Australia- and over many years, Holden had cultivated the image of building "Australia's own car''.

Commodore was a complete reversal of this strategy- it was based on the European [[Opel Commodore]], albeit significantly re-engineered and powered by Holden engines.

Initially, Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia. However, some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered Commodore's acceptance. In particular, Commodore was narrower than its predecessor and the [[Falcon]] rival, which meant that it was less accommodating for 3 rear seat passengers. Commodore was perceived as being smaller than [[Falcon]], which cost sales. The width problem was not resolved until the introduction of the wider [[VN Commodore]] in 1988.
==The 1980s==

The 1980s were challenging for Holden.

The Australian car industry was experiencing difficulties- and the Australian Government intervened to endeavour to revive the industry, with the establishment of the "Button Plan" (named after [[John Button]] the Federal Industry Minister. The Button Plan aimed to improve viability by encouraging the industry to focus on producing larger (and more economic) volumes of fewer models, as well as providing incentives for exports. 

'''Tough times for Holden'''

Holden experienced financial challenges as profitability fell in the face of declining sales of the [[Commodore]] and [[Gemini]].

The competition from [[Ford]] intensified, with a popular new {{Falcon]] and a new model- the [[Laser]], a compact car based on the [[Mazda 323]]. Also, the other local manufacturers- Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi- were gaining ground on Holden.

Holden released the [[Holden Camira]] in 1982- its version of the GM J car. After a good sales start, [[Camira]] faltered, as buyers considered the 1.6 litre engine to have inadequate power, and the car's reputation was tarnished by miscellaneous problems.

'''Rescuing Holden'''   

In 1985, Holden's parent- General Motors- reorganised and recapitalised the business. At this time, the engine manufacturing and car manufacturing divisions were separated.

Holden's revival had several elements.

'''Building an engine business'''

The engine manufacturing business was successful- building 4 cylinder GM Family II engines for use in cars built overseas. Holden became the source of engines for the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] and the [[Opel Ascona]] built in Europe.

'''The Nissan connection'''

An alliance was made with [[Nissan]], which saw Holden offer a rebadged [[Pulsar]] hatchback in 1985- the original [[Holden Astra]]. When Nissan released a new model Pulsar (with an Astra clone) in 1987, it was powered by the [[GM Family II]] engine which powered the Camira. This arrangement ceased in 1988, when Holden entered a new alliance with [[Toyota]]. 

'''Resuscitating the Commodore'''

Next, the Commodore was given resuscitation.

The first step was the introduction of the 1984 VK series, which featured new models within the range- the [[Executive]], [[Berlina]] and [[Calais]]. The styling was significantly changed with the adoption of the [[Opel Senator]] roofline with an additional side window.

The next step was the 1986 VL series, which had new front and rear styling. Controversially, VL was powered by the Nissan RB30 3 litre 6 cylinder engine (in normally aspirated and turbochaged versions). This was the first time the standard version of Holden's full-size car was powered by an imported engine.

The change to the Nissan engine was necessitasted by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia from 1986 had to run on unleaded petrol. It was not feasible to convert Holden's 6 cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, and the Nissan engine was chosen as representing the best engine available. 

Buyers agreed that the VL had a good engine, and Commodore sales recovered. However, Holden found a new problem- due to exchange rate changes, over the life of the VL, the cost of the Nissan engines doubled.

The final phase in the Commodore recovery strategy was the 1988 introduction of the [[VN Commodore]], which was significantly wider and significantly redesigned. It was powered by a US built [[Buick]] OHV 3.8 litre V6. VN set the stage for Holden's susccess in the 1990s.

'''Joint venture and model sharing with Toyota'''

In 1988, Holden entered a joint venture alliance with [[Toyota]] in Australia, forming a [[joint venture]] company called United Australian Automobile Industries (UAAI). In 1989, Holden began selling rebadged versions of Toyota's [[Toyota Corolla|Corolla]] and [[Toyota Camry|Camry]], as the [[Holden Nova]] and [[Holden Apollo|Apollo]], while Toyota sold the Commodore as the Toyota Lexcen, named after the late [[America's Cup]] yacht designer, [[Ben Lexcen]]. This [[badge engineering]] did not resonate with buyers, even though rival Ford had been successful with its [[Ford Laser|Laser]] and [[Ford Telstar|Telstar]] models, which were facelifeted versions of [[Mazda|Mazda of Japan's]] [[Mazda 323|323]] and [[Mazda 626|626]]. (Mazda is a member of the Ford Automotive Group).

==The 1990s==
In 1995, UAAI was dissolved, and Holden was able to source product offerings from GM rather than from other manufacturers in Australia. Between 1996 and 1997, Holden replaced the Toyota-based Nova and Apollo with the Astra and Vectra, imported from Opel in [[Europe]]. The [[Opel Corsa]] was sold in Australia as the [[Holden Barina]], replacing another model of that name, originally introduced in 1986, based on the [[Suzuki Swift]]. The Vectra was briefly assembled locally for export to neighbouring countries, but this was dealt a severe blow by the Asian economic crisis in 1997. It has subsequently been imported from Europe.

==2000s==
[[Image:Holden blimp.jpg|thumb|The Holden Airship]]
To increase profitability, Holden has now looked to the GM owned [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo]] in [[South Korea]] for replacements. Holden has already established close research and design links with Daewoo, with which it provides the large Statesman model. The 2006 model Holden Barina is based on the [[Daewoo Kalos]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carsguide.news.com.au/story/0,20384,17835536-27286,00.html|title=Holden's Korean sourced Barina|work=Carsguide.news.com.au|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> and the entry-level Astra Classic was replaced by the Holden Viva, based on the [[Daewoo Lacetti]], however the Astra badge is continued with the CD model Astra. Holden have also begun selling the [[Holden Captiva]], a new five or seven seater SUV, which is manufactured by Daewoo with an Australian built engine.

Due to tariffs and exchange rates, various Vectra models are more expensive than the larger Commodore in Australia and New Zealand. Holden have stated that the European model will be replaced by the new [[Daewoo Tosca]] which will be sold by Holden in Australia as the [[Holden Epica]] from April 2007.
In August 2006, Holden released the [[Holden VE Commodore|VE Commodore]] receiving increased power upgrades, performance, handling and appearance.
In October 2006, Holden announced the intention to sell the [[Hummer H3]] in Australia, to be released in either May or June 2007.

==New Zealand==
{{main|Holden (New Zealand)}}

==Export markets==
The Holden Commodore is as popular in New Zealand (where it has hit the number-one slot in the sales' charts from time to time) as it is in Australia, often being used as a police car. It is also sold in South Africa, [[Thailand]], and parts of the [[Middle East]] badged as a [[Chevrolet Lumina]], and in [[Brazil]] as the [[Chevrolet Omega]]. Holden's exports to the Middle East and Brazil were the first [[left hand drive]] cars built since the 1960s, when it sold cars in [[Hawaii]]. A modified version of the Holden Monaro (in turn a modified Commodore) has been sold in the [[United States]] as the [[Pontiac GTO]] and its model name through [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] dealerships in the United Kingdom. Vauxhall plans on importing V8 and V6 Commodores to the UK, but Opel has not yet made any announcement on imports of Commodores. Holden also exports its Statesman sedan to the Middle East as the [[Chevrolet Caprice]], to South Korea as the [[Daewoo]] Statesman, and the [[People's Republic of China|China]] as the [[Buick]] Royaum. [[Fiji]], [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]] and Indonesia have also been Holden export markets. In the near future, Holden will be exporting [[Holden VZ Commodore|VZ Commodore]] utes and the VE Commodore Sedan to the United States, where they will be sold as the [[Pontiac G8|G8]] under the Pontiac nameplate, whilst rumours indicate the Ute may be rebadged as the El Camino SS/GT depending on the specification (SS or Maloo)

==Sports vehicles==
Between 1968 and 1976, GMH sold a two-door variant of their full-size Holden sedan as the [[Holden Monaro|Monaro]], a car popular with the general public and in the hearts of many - although it did not quite set the sales charts alight. A revived Monaro, based on the previous model Commodore, has attracted wide attention since being shown as a [[concept car]] at Australian [[motor show]]s, and a large waiting list after it was put into production. The revived Monaro was released in the Australian market in October 2001 and starting with the 2004 model year, the Monaro has been exported to the United States, rebadged as the Pontiac GTO, and the Middle East as the Chevrolet Lumina Coupe. It is sold in limited numbers in the UK as the Vauxhall Monaro.

[[Holden Special Vehicles]] ('''HSV'''), formed in 1987 in partnership with Tom Walkinshaw, is a company that manufactures extensively modified, high-performance Commodore variants (including the Monaro and the Statesman). Holdens have been a staple of domestic [[touring car racing]] since the 1960s, and the quasi-factory Holden Racing Team (HRT) has successfully participated in [[V8 Supercar]] racing. To further reinforce the brand, HSV introduced the 'HSV Dealer Team' into the V8 Supercar fold in 2005, under the naming rights of HSV Toll Racing.
