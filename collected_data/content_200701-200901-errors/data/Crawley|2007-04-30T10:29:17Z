{{GBthumb|140|218|TQ2736}}
'''Crawley''' is a town and [[Districts of England|local government district]] in [[West Sussex]], [[England]]. It covers an area of 44.97 km² and has a population of 99,744 people (2001 census). It is bordered by the Sussex Local Authorities of [[Mid Sussex]] and [[Horsham]] Districts; and by the [[Surrey]] authorities of [[Mole Valley]] and [[Tandridge (district)|Tandridge]] Districts, and the Borough of [[Reigate & Banstead]]. Crawley is the nearest large town to the United Kingdom's second largest airport, [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]], which has a major influence on the economy and development of the town.

==Administration==
The town is an unparished [[borough]], a two-tier area, also coming under the remit of West Sussex County Council. It encompasses the original West Sussex parishes of [[Ifield, Crawley|Ifield]] and part of [[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]]. The borough is divided into fifteen wards for local government purposes.
The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] group are the largest party in the Borough Council. The status of the council is currently no overall control following the defection late in 2006 of a Conservative councillor to the Liberal Democrats.

As a [[parliamentary constituency]] Crawley has traditionally been a solid [[Labour]] seat. However, during the 2005 [[General Election]] Labour held the seat with just 37 votes, making it the most marginal constituency in the UK.

==History==
The area now known as Crawley was peopled by [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] settlers, as remains show. During the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times the [[iron]] industry flourished. The [[Saxons]] first named the settlement ''craw leah'' (crow infested clearing); both Ifield and Worth are mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]]; Worth church is Saxon. A weekly market [[charter]] was granted in 1203.<ref name="cbcsite">{{cite web | title = History | work = Crawley Borough Council website  | publisher = Crawley Borough Council | url = http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=221&strCSS=PB1_SS_MAIN  | accessdate = 2007-01-06}}</ref>

Crawley's position on the [[Toll road|turnpike]] to [[Brighton]] helped to boost its population. It was, however, the coming of the railway in 1848, when the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] opened the line from [[Three Bridges railway station|Three Bridges]] (on the [[Brighton Line|line to Brighton]]) to [[Horsham railway station]] that started the real town growth. Some 900 houses were added between the two world wars<ref name= "cbcsite"/>, bringing the population to around 10,000 people by [[World War II]], mainly clustered around the main London to Brighton road (by then the [[A23 road|A23]]).

Other local developments included the opening of Gatwick [[Race track|Racecourse]] in 1891; and an [[Airport|aerodrome]], later to become [[Gatwick Airport]], opened in the 1930s.<ref name= "cbcsite">

===Second World War===

Crawley area was considered far enough away from [[London]] to be a safe place; hence a few children and some businesses moved into the town. Later in the war, Crawley suffered only two fatal attacks:

* [[4 February]] [[1943]] a line of bombs fell on the town centre killing two people.  "They were straight luckily." said James Crawley. This area has yet to be rebuilt.
* [[10 July]] [[1944]] two [[V-1 flying bomb]]s landed on the town. One caused seven deaths, but the other failed to explode. The seven killed were women (yuck) and the one failed to explode when '''a gay man told it not to blow him.'''

Nearby [[Gatwick Airport]] was requisitioned by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and mainly used for aircraft maintenance and repair.<ref name= "gatwick">{{cite web | title = Our History | work = Gatwick Airport Website  | publisher = BAA plc | url = http://www.baa.com/portal/controller/dispatcher.jsp?CiID=6f666da45a282010VgnVCM100000147e120a____&CtID=448c6a4c7f1b0010VgnVCM200000357e120a____&Ct=B2C_CT_GENERAL&RootCh=About%20BAA&Ch=Our+history&ChID=4b7e3de26aa32010VgnVCM100000147e120a____&ChPath=Corporate%5EAbout+BAA%5EOur+history&ChIDPath=2292ea0bb0022010VgnVCM100000147e120a____%5E446597dc2eb12010VgnVCM100000147e120a____%5E4b7e3de26aa32010VgnVCM100000147e120a____ |accessdate = 2007-01-06}}</ref>

===Development as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]]===
In 1947, Crawley was designated as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] area under the New Towns Act of 1946.[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=18414] Its development then ballooned during the 1950s and 1960s, bringing it to a population of around 60,000. Crawley New Town was based around three communities: Crawley itself, Ifield and [[Three Bridges]]. The Act allowed expansion as required: and since its beginnings, the town has continued to grow, incorporating neighbouring settlements. <ref>{{cite book | last = Hudson  | first = T.P. (ed.) | title = A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 3: Bramber Rape (North-Eastern Part) including Crawley New Town | origyear = 1987 | url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/source.asp?pubid=68 | accessdate = 2007-01-06 | publisher = Institute of Historical Research by Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 0197227686 | pages = pp74-75 | chapter = Crawley New Town | chapterurl = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=18414}}</ref>

Six square kilometres were added to the authority's area in 1983; and a further neighbourhood to the north-east of the town is planned.<ref name= "cbcsite"/>

During the boom of the 1980s the town boasted the lowest level of unemployment in the UK.<ref  name="hansard">{{cite web | title = Debates for 9 Feb 1989  | work = House of Commons Hansard | publisher = HMSO | date = 1989   | url =http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm198889/cmhansrd/1989-02-09/Debate-4.html  | accessdate =  6 Jan 2007 }}</ref>
