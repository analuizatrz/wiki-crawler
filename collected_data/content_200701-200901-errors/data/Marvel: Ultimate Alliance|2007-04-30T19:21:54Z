'''''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance''''' is an [[action role-playing game]] released by [[Raven Software]] and [[Activision]] in October 2006 in U.S. Previously referred to as '''Marvel Legends''', this game features more than 20 characters which are available to players and 140 character appearances in total. 

==Story==
{{spoiler}}
[[Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]] has formed a new [[Masters of Evil]] in pursuit of an unknown goal. They then launch an attack on a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]]. [[Nick Fury]] sends out a distress call to all available meta-humans. [[Captain America]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] respond and proceed to eliminate Doom's forces led by [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Bucky|Winter Soldier]], [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]], [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], and [[Fin Fang Foom]]. After saving the helicarrier, Nick is given the OK by the government to create a special task force of superhumans to counter the Masters of Evil.

Their first mission is to investigate a mysterious message from [[Dum Dum Dugan]] on the Omega Base, which is under siege by [[MODOK|M.O.D.O.K.]], alongside him are [[Crimson Dynamo]] and [[Mysterio]]. The team bests the three.

Their next mission takes them to Atlantis, where the rioting inhabitants have ripped [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] off his throne, and [[Attuma]] takes his place under the influence of 3 Sonic Emitters placed in Atlantis and guarded by [[Krang (comics)|Warlord Krang]] and [[Byrrah]]. After the Sonic Emitters are destroyed, the team fights and beats Attuma and [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]], and see The [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] deep in the catacombs, working for the Masters of Evil. He escapes with the Tome of Asarius, but unleashes the [[Kraken (Marvel Comics)|Kraken]]. The heroes defeat it and pursue the Mandarin.

The team travels to The Valley of Spirits, and defeats Mandarin. But, Mandarin claims he quit the Masters' weeks ago. He suggests that the Mandarin they saw in the catacombs was [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], God of Mischief.

Nick Fury moves the base to [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]]'s Sanctum Sanctorum, since Loki is now involved. The team learns that [[Jean Grey]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] of the [[X-Men]] have been kidnapped. [[Professor X]]avier uses Cerebro to track them in Castle Doom in Latveria. The team teleports there, but learns that [[Baron Mordo]] has disrupted Dr. Strange's Orb of Teleportation, which sends them to Murderworld, run by [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]]. The team rescues Jean Grey, defeats [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], and defeats Arcade, who says that Doom has used the Mutant Amplifier, stolen from the Omega Base, on Nightcrawler, so he can go to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s Realm.

The team travels to Mephisto's Realm, but [[Blackheart]]'s minions kidnap Jean Grey, and puts them in separate cages above the Infinity Vortex. The team beats some Fire Giants and Blackheart, but is faced with a difficult choice; Nightcrawler or Jean Grey? After an X-Man is sacrificed, the team takes on Mephisto, who reveals that he traded his Twilight Sword for leading the heroes into his realm, saying that the Masters of Evil have "unique plans for Asgard."

Loki uses the Super Soldier Serum, stolen from the Omega, to create a massive army of Super Soldiers to attack Asgard, and steal [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]]'s throne. The team travels to Valhalla to use it as a new base. The team travels to Niffleheim to save Odin, who has gone to battle Loki's forces. They find the Twilight Sword shattered. [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] claims that the only way it could have broken is that it was used on Odin. The team travels up to Raven's Spire, and defeat Loki, and travel back to Valhalla to free the Destroyer Armor. Loki reveals that he created a land of his making, and made the team free the armor. The team beats Loki, and the Destroyer, but Dr. Doom appears, and reveals he stole Odin's power, and uses it to kill the team...

...Or so it seems. [[Uatu]] the Watcher saves them at the last second and trasports them to the base of the [[Inhumans]] on the Moon. Uatu reveals the only way to beat Doom; find the M'Kraan Crystal: proprety of the [[Shi'ar]]. Then, steal the Muonic Inducer from [[Galactus]] who is attacking the [[Skrull]]'s homeworld.

The team goes back to Latveria, and confronts Dr. Doom, using the two devices. Doom is weakened, making the team powerful enough to defeat him. Doom is struck by a bolt of lightening, sent by a rejuvenated Odin. Nick Fury congratulates the team on a job well-done, but is forced to disband the team. Galactus, meanwhile, is angered by the theft of his property, and vows to destroy the planet.(hence a hint for a sequel)

===Future===
After the game, Uatu tells the player of how his/her actions in the game (such as not completing missions the right way, or not completing side missions) have changed the future. For example:

* If the player saves the S.H.I.E.L.D. Omega Base computer that contains info on the [[Legacy Virus]] cure, the mutant race is saved from extinction. If not, the mutant race will be extinct.
* If the player succeeds in finding rare seaweed as one of the ingredients to a medicine that will heal Namor, he will begin to trust surface-dwellers and join an organization of superheroes. Otherwise, war between Atlantis and the surface world may ensue.
* If the player succeeds in saving [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] from Arcade, he would sponsor the Mutant Aid bill and funding schools similar to Professor X's school to train young mutants how to control their powers. However, if he is not rescued, Kelly will instate a bill where all mutants are forced to go to re-educational camps so they will be educated to NOT use their powers.
* If the player chooses to save Jean Grey from being dropped into the Infinity Vortex, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] will avenge Nightcrawler by infiltrating the [[X-Mansion]] at night to vent her frustration on Professor X where he will die in a coma and the X-Men will be forever disbanded. If the player saves Nightcrawler from being dropped into the Infinity Vortex, Jean Grey will return with a vengeance as the Dark Phoenix against those who did not save her.
* If the player finds Valkyrie's sword, the Asgardians have won [[Ragnar√∂k|Ragnarok]] and Loki is imprisoned. If the player doesn't find her sword, Valkyrie falls in the battle during Ragnarok and the people of Asgard refuse contacting Earth for a century.
* If the player finds [[Volla (Marvel Comics)|Volla]]'s ring, she will warn Odin about an attempt on his life orchestrated by [[Surtur (comics)|Surtur]]. If not, then Odin will be killed and Thor will rule Asgard as the greatest of the gods. 
* If the player saves [[Lilandra Neramani]] from [[Deathbird]], the Shi'ar would use their advance technology to wipe out diseases and hunger on Earth and later technology that will enable the people of Earth to build colonies on other planets. If the player doesn't succeed, the Shi'ar will refuse to help the heroes when an asteroid came to destroy the Western coast of the United States.
* If the player saves the Skrull homeworld from Galactus, the Skrulls will come to the aid of Earth's heroes when the [[Kree]] plan an invasion upon Earth.
* If the player saves Odin from imprisonment in one of Doctor Doom's machines, he will help Thor prevent [[Thanos]] from taking over Earth. If the player doesn't, he won't help Thor fight Thanos and Earth will be enslaved.
* If the player successfully finds the damaged [[Ultimate Nullifier]] in Castle Doom, [[Mister Fantastic]] will repair it and use it to prevent Mephisto from entering Earth and invading it before all is lost. If the Nullifier is not found, Mephisto is still repelled, but only after heavy casualties.

===Subplot===
During the game a subplot takes place where [[Weasel (comics)|Weasel]] attempts to find proof that the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] is a double agent, and the player needs to obtain various pieces of information to aid his efforts. Ultimately the players call Nick Fury with information of Black Widow's apparent betrayal, it is revealed that Black Widow is innocent and her suspicious activities were part of an operation to try and retrieve plans that Dr. Doom had stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. The plan, Operation: All Father was created for if the Asgardians became threats to humans and involved stealing Odin's power with the Twilight Sword, which is exactly what Doom does. After the closing credits, there is also a dialogue between Weasel and Black Window, with Weasel going into S.H.I.E.L.D. records for her. During this it is revealed that Black Widow is indeed some kind of double agent, and she has set up Weasel for the fall.

==Features==
The game features over 140 characters from the Marvel Universe. Players are able to create teams, and have online and co-operative play, for up to 4 players. In arcade mode players will have to fight for the most kills in order to get the experience points at the end of the level. There are also special comic book missions, revisiting a moment in a character's past and facing a classic arch rival. Characters may have up to four costumes, which can alter the stats of the character.

Players will fight in mid air, underwater and on the ground, with fully destructible and interactive environments in over 17 locations, traveling around different locales on planet Earth, different dimensions, and even the depths of space by the end of the game. The game has alternative endings, affected by the decisions the player(s) make throughout the game. These endings are based on whether or not the player chooses to complete optional missions.

The game is quite rewarding for fans of Marvel's characters, providing lots of bonuses and nods to knowledgeable fans who know their comic history. Putting together teams of characters who have a shared history together, for example, may give team bonuses (ex. using [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Ms. Marvel]] on the same team would yield you the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], giving you a boost in attack damage for all team members). Using particular characters to interact with other NPCs can also yield additional dialogue, and villains will also react accordingly when met with their nemeses (for example, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] will talk directly to [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] or [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] upon seeing those characters in the first chapter). The game also features trivia games, artwork and many more references to the Marvel Universe.

While many characters in the game by default are rendered with the appearance they have in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of comics, the world of the game is predominantly based upon that of the [[Earth 616|original Marvel Universe]], with many villains, character designs and references to events that exist only in that continuity (for example, [[Galactus]] is the original Marvel Universe's version, not Ultimate Marvel's hive-minded robotic version), and Shocker's design is the classic one, rather than his Ultimate (and considerably weaker)one.

==Versions==
The game is available for the [[Xbox]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Wii]] and PC. The graphical engine and looks differ between the various platforms. For the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], [[Xbox]], and [[Wii]], characters models are similar to ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse|X-Men Legends II]]'' style. The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions feature more detailed character models and environments. The PC version vary depending on the customization of a user's settings, at maximum settings and shaders with premium hardware, the PC graphics will be similar to or better than the 7th gen. The PC version also features "intuitive mouse controls" <ref>[http://www.marvelultimatealliance.com/game_info.php Marvel: Ultimate Alliance official site]</ref> and works with a gamepad. 

There are exclusive characters on the GBA, PSP, Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3. The PSP has four exclusive characters, the GBA has two exclusive characters, and the three next-gen systems share two exclusive characters. [[Moon Knight]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (the next-gen exclusive characters) are now playable on the PC and Xbox versions as well with a game mod.

===GBA===
"Marvel: Ultimate Alliance" is drastically altered for the Game Boy Advance Port.

==Characters==
While ''Ultimate Alliance'' follows in the footsteps of Raven Software's ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' games, it has a broader scope of inclusion, adding playable heroes from [[Marvel Comics]]' other popular comics, including [[Spider-Man]], many different members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the entire [[Fantastic Four]]. In addition, each character has four different costumes. Most of these extra costumes are different costumes characters have had in their comics appearances; for example, Spider-Man has his black symbiote costume and his red and gold [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Stark Armor|"Iron Spider"]] costume, as well as his classic red and blue costume. Some of the costumes are alternate versions of the same character or even entirely separate characters with similar powers or appearance: for example, many characters appear in their [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] versions, and both versions of the character [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] as well as the [[MC2]] character [[Spider-Girl]] are available via the costume change feature.

One major thing to note is that the version of Nick Fury used for Alliance is not the same as previously appeared in the X-Men Legends game, instead being the classic original Nick Fury. However, the [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]] model that was previously used is still available as an alternate costume for Fury, with both Nick Fury versions having two costumes each.

While all versions of ''Ultimate Alliance'' share a common core of initially-available and unlockable characters, many of the different versions have exclusive characters. The PC, [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Xbox]] versions have only the basic core, while the PlayStation Portable version adds four characters, the Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and Wii versions share a pair of exclusive characters, and the Game Boy Advance version has two exclusive characters while lacking some of the core unlockable characters, and most of the base selection.

The [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] was going to be the final playable character, but as the rights to use the character are held by [[Sierra Entertainment]], this was not possible. However, the player meets Bruce Banner in the Omega Base & sees a defeated Hulk in a cinematic prior to the final mission. The character will be made available for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace soon(see [[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance#Versions|above]]).

As of March 23rd, it has been announced that the 360 version of the game will feature new content with 8 characters that updates them with costumes, special powers, and voice dialog for the game.  The new expansion pack will include 4 heroes The Hulk, Cyclops, Hawkeye, and Nightcrawler as well as 4 villans Doctor Doom, Magneto, Venom, and Sabretooth.  It was announced on the 23rd April 2007 that the DLC would be available sometime during the week.  After much delay, the Playable Hero and Villains Packs were released on April 26.

There is currently no word on if these characters will be made available for the PS3, Wii or PC.

{{spoiler}} 
Characters that appear as alternate costumes are listed under the original character.<br>
:''All playable characters have four different costumes, except [[Moon Knight]], who has three.''.<br>
:''In the case of [[Nick Fury]], Two of his four represent [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]]''.
:''In the case of [[Silver Surfer]], all of his alternate costumes look the same.''
All characters in italics are costume changes for other characters that are of different personas altogether. Daredevil, Black Panther, Nick Fury, Silver Surfer, Dr Strange, Ghost Rider and Blade are not available at the beginning of the game; some of them have to be unlocked by completing/collecting specific items whereas the rest are unlocked as you meet the characters in the game.

===Sequel===
It is speculated, that due to the ending of the game, a sequel will be released featuring Galactus as the main villain. However, the game has yet to be officially announced, and as such, no details have been confirmed but due to Galactus's status as a planet killer, some speculate that like ''X-Men Legends II'', villains will be playable.

However, due to SEGA now owning the rights to produce video games based on Captain America, Iron Man, Thor & the Hulk, and 2K Games owning the rights to Ghost Rider & the Fantastic Four, it is possible that these characters would not return for the sequel. Thus far, 2K Games & SEGA have only talked about video games based on the movies, and Activision have (in addition to the rights to Spider-Man and the X-Men) a blanket licence for the Marvel universe, meaning they can produce games for any character/team not licenced out individually, and if terms can be agreed, those that are.

"April 18, 2007 - Avengers, assemble! It took him getting assassinated for the world to start talking about Captain America again, but SEGA and Marvel want to change all that. The two powerhouse companies came out of their secret lairs today to announce an exclusive, multi-year deal to put out '''solo'''-videogame adventures featuring Iron Man, Captain America, the Incredible Hulk and Thor. The initial announcement speaks only of movie-based games"
