Throughout the '''History of Raëlism''', members of the [[Raelian Church]] have advocated the use of [[sex-positive feminism]], [[condoms]], [[birth control]], [[masturbation]], [[meditation]], [[genetically modified organisms]], and [[human cloning]].<ref name="Promise of as much sex as you want and everlasting life">Broughton, Philip D.

==History of Raël==
{{Main article|History of Raël}}
The '''History of Raël''' concerns the origins of Raël, his personage, and his works, which developed from [[Claude Vorilhon]].  The personage purportedly began as the result of encounters described in Raelian Messages, mainly from ''The Book Which Tells the Truth'' (1974) and ''Extraterrestrials Took Me to their Planet'' (1975).

==Religion and politics==
In 1978, Raëlians had a conference for the French press announcing their vision for a worldwide movement for [[Geniocracy]].  March 1978, they managed get one their members onto the city council of [[Sarlat]].  However the authoritarian nature of the [[Geniocracy|Geniocratic]] model of government, the Raëlian being sect, and the swastika in the logo prompted the governments to seize documents in Raël's home as well as the homes of other Raëlians.<ref name="Palmer, p. 56.">Palmer, p. 56.</ref>

During an evening in 1986, in a restaurant next to Villa Pamphilli park—just outside [[Vatican City]]—Raël began claiming to members that he was the true pope.  By two the next morning, Raël played a guitar hymn about extraterrestrials.<ref name="Palmer, p. 91.">Palmer, p. 91.</ref>  In October 7, 1994, Raëlians began implementing their own version of baptism in front of a baptismal font inside [[St. Peter's Basilica]].  They were later escorted to the exit gates of the city.  In the same week, Raël purportedly handed a copy of his book ''Le Livre'' to [[Pope John Paul II]].<ref name="Palmer, p. 91.">Palmer, p. 91.</ref>

The Raelian Movement promoted 2004 as the year of atheism.<ref name="ThereIsNOGod.info">[http://thereisnogod.info/English/Intro.php ThereIsNOGod.info], ''The International Raelian Movement''.  Retrieved [[25 November]] [[2006]]</ref> They have also participated in the [[Blasphemy Challenge]] in denial of the [[Holy Spirit]]. However, Raëlians still believe that a trained mind can achieve [[telepathy]] with extraterrestrial [[Elohim]].<ref name="Book 1">Book 1 of 2 in the following compilations: ''The Message Given to me by Extraterrestrials'' (1986), ''The Message Given by Extraterrestrials'' (1998), ''The Final Message'' (1998), ''True Face of God'' (1998). Book 1 of 3 in the compilation ''Intelligent Design'' (2006).</ref>

In 2006, IRM vocally advocated of the concept of a "United States of Africa" following a more honest and complete "decolonization" involving the disbanding of corrupt rulerships as a result of Africans returning to their non-Christian religious and territorial roots which existed before colonization by Europeans.<ref name="AFRICA, THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY">[http://raelafrica.org/e107v2/download.php?view.1 AFRICA, THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY], ''The International Raelian Movement''.

==Technology==
In 1994, rich Japanese Raëlians rented a race car and showed it to [[Claude Vorilhon]].  They believed that it would generate publicity for the movement.  Claude accepted the offer on the condition that the funding must not come from member tithes or embassy funding.  So the funding of Raël's races which took place in the 1990s and early 2000s came mostly from well funded European and Japanese people.<ref name="Susan J.

According to the ''[[Japan Today]]'' of [[February 10]], [[2003]], that Sunday, about sixty Raëlians celebrated with banners the purported birth of the first cloned babies: 1) a baby girl named Eve, 2) a daughter and clone of a Dutch lesbian, 3) a son and clone of Japanese male.  The small parade event began at [[Hiroshima Station]] and ended at [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]].  In the article, figures by the observers and a representative of the movement suggest that one percent of [[Japan]]'s Raëlians participated in the event.<ref name="Japan's Raelians hold parade to celebrate human clone births">[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=12216&sec=42&cont=4 Japan's Raelians hold parade to celebrate human clone births], ''Worldwide Religious News, Japan Today''.

The movement gave vocal support in response to the company's support for [[genetically modified organism]]s particularly in their country.  Brazilian farmers have been using Monsanto's genetically engineered soy plant as well as the [[Roundup]] herbicide to which it was artificially adapted.  The Raëlians spoke against the Brazilian government's ban on GMOs.<ref name="With friends like these, Monsanto needs no enemies">[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/2003-08-06-raelians-biotech_x.htm With friends like these, Monsanto needs no enemies], ''USATODAY.com''.

In [[December 26]], [[2002]], [[Brigitte Boisselier]], a Raëlian Bishop and CEO of a biotechnology company called Clonaid, announced the birth of baby Eve, a human clone, which at that point ignited much media attention, ethical debate, doubt, critics, and claims of a hoax.  Spokespeople for the movement, such as [[Raël|Claude Vorhilon]], have suggested that this is only first step in achieving a more important agenda, saying that that accelerated growth process and [[mind transfer]],  in combination with [[cloning]] are mechanisms by which [[eternal life]] may be achieved.<ref name="THE CLONING DEBATE">[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec02/cloning_12-27.html THE CLONING DEBATE], ''MacNeil/Lehrer Productions''.
