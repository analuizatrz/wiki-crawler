'''Heraldry''' in its most general sense encompasses all matters relating to the duties and responsibilities of [[officer of arms|officers of arms]].<ref>Stephen Friar, Ed. ''A Dictionary of Heraldry''. (Harmony Books, New York: 1987), 183.</ref> To most, though, heraldry is the practice of designing, displaying, describing, and recording [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] and [[heraldic badge|badges]]. Historically, it has been variously described as "the shorthand of history"<ref>[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies|Fox-Davies]], ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', (Thomas Nelson, 1925).</ref> and "the floral border in the garden of history."<ref>[[Iain Moncreiffe|Moncreiffe]] & [[Don Pottinger|Pottinger]], ''Simple Heraldry'' (Thomas Nelson, 1953).</ref> The origins of heraldry lie in the need to distinguish participants in combat when their faces were hidden by iron and steel [[helmet]]s.<ref>[[John Brooke-Little]]. ''An Heraldic Alphabet''. (Macdonald, London: 1973),2.</ref> Eventually a system of rules developed into the modern form of heraldry.

The system of [[blazon]]ing arms that is used today was developed by the officers of arms since the dawn of the art. This includes a description of the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] (shield), the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], and, if present, [[supporters]], [[motto]]es, and other insignia. An understanding of these rules is one of the keys to sound practice of heraldry. The rules do differ from country to country, but there are some aspects that carry over in each jurisdiction.

Though heraldry is nearly 900 years old, it is still very much in use. Many cities and towns in [[Europe]] and around the world still make use of arms. Personal heraldry, both legally protected and lawfully assumed, has continued to be used around the world. Heraldic societies strive to promote education and understanding about the subject.

==Origins and history== 
[[Image:Raneb-Stela MetropolitanMuseum.png|thumb|100px|''serekh'' emblem of Pharaoh [[Raneb]], whose name appears between the falcon and the palace symbols]]

As early as [[predynastic Egypt]], an emblem known as a ''[[serekh]]'' was used to indicate the extent of influence of a particular regime, sometimes carved on ivory labels attached to trade goods, but also used to identify military allegiances and in a variety of other ways, even leading to the development of the earliest [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]].  This practice seems to have grown out of the former use of animal mascots literally affixed to staves or standards, as depicted on the earliest [[cosmetic palette]]s of the period.  Some of the oldest ''serekhs'' consist of a striped or cross-hatched box, representing a palace or city, with a crane, scorpion, or other animal drawn standing on top. Before long, the Horus-falcon became the norm as the animal on top, with the individual Pharaoh's symbol usually appearing in the box beneath the falcon, and above the stripes representing the palace.

[[Image:PraesentalisII2.png|thumb|left|Shields of ''Magister Militum Praesentalis II''. Page from the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', a medieval copy of a Late Roman register of military commands]]

Ancient warriors often decorated their shields with patterns and mythological motifs. These symbols could be used to identify the warriors bearing them when their faces were obscured by helmets. Army units of the [[Roman Empire]] were identified by the distinctive markings on their shields, although these were not heraldic in the medieval and modern sense, as they were associated with units, not individuals or families.<ref>Notitia Dignitatum, Bodleian Library</ref>[[Image:Harold dead bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|right|Three soldiers on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] bearing pre-heraldic shields.]] At the time of the [[Norman conquest of England]], modern heraldry had not yet been developed. The [[knight]]s in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] carry shields, but there appears to have been no system of [[Heredity|hereditary]] [[coat of arms|coats of arms]]. The beginnings of modern heraldic structure were in place, but would not become standard until the middle of the 12th century.<ref>Beryl Platts. ''Origins of Heraldry''. (Procter Press, London: 1980), 32.</ref> By this time, coats of arms were being inherited by the children of [[armiger]]s (persons entitled to use a coat of arms) across Europe. Between 1135 and 1155, seals show the general adoption of heraldic devices in [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], and [[Italy]].<ref>[[Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|Woodcock, Thomas]] & [[John Martin Robinson]]. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 1.</ref> In [[Great Britain|Britain]] the practice of using marks of [[cadency]] arose to distinguish one son from another, and was institutionalized and standardized by [[John Writhe]] in the 15th century.
[[Image:Geoffrey of Anjou Monument.jpg|left|thumb|The tomb of [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou]] is one of the first recorded examples of hereditary armory in Europe. The same shield shown here is found on the tomb [[effigy]] of his grandson, [[William de Longespee, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William Longespee]].]]
In the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], heraldry became a highly developed discipline, regulated by professional officers of arms. As its use in [[jousting]] became obsolete, coats of arms remained popular for visually identifying a person in other ways—impressed in [[seal (device)|sealing wax]] on documents, carved on family tombs, and flown as a banner on country homes. The first work of [[Law of Arms|heraldic jurisprudence]], ''De Insigniis et Armiis'', was written in the 1350s by [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato]], a professor of law at the [[University of Padua]].<ref>Squibb, George. (Spring 1953). "The Law of Arms in England". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''II''' (15): 244.</ref>

From the beginning of heraldry, coats of arms have been executed in a wide variety of media, including on paper, painted wood, [[embroidery]], [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], stonework and [[stained glass]]. For the purpose of quick identification in all of these, heraldry distinguishes only seven basic [[tincture (heraldry)|colors]]<ref>Jack Carlson. ''A Humorous Guide to Heraldry''. (Black Knight Books, Boston: 2005), 22</ref> and makes no fine distinctions in the precise size or placement of [[charge (heraldry)|charges]] on the [[Field (heraldry)|field]].<ref>David Williamson. ''[[Debrett's]] Guide to Heraldry and Regalia''. (Headline Books, London: 1992), 24.</ref> Coats of arms and their accessories are described in a concise [[jargon]] called [[blazon]].<ref>Arthur Fox-Davies. ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'' (Grammercy Books, New York: 1993), 99.</ref> This technical description of a coat of arms is the standard that must be adhered to no matter what artistic interpretations may be made in a particular depiction of the arms.

The idea that each element of a coat of arms has some specific meaning is unfounded. Though the original armiger may have placed particular meaning on a charge, these meanings are not necessarily retained from generation to generation. Unless the arms incorporate an obvious pun on the bearer's name, it is difficult to find meaning in them.

Changes in military technology and tactics made [[plate armour]] obsolete and heraldry became detached from its original function. This brought about the development of "paper heraldry" that only existed in paintings. Designs and shields became more elaborate at the expense of clarity. The 20th century's taste for stark [[icon]]ic emblems made the simple styles of early heraldry fashionable again.

==The rules of heraldry==
===Shield and lozenge===

The focus of modern heraldry is the armorial achievement, or the [[coat of arms]], the central element of which is the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]. <ref>William Whitmore. ''The Elements of Heraldry''. (Weathervane Books, New York: 1968), p.9.</ref> In general, the shape of the shield employed in a coat of arms is irrelevant, because the fashion for the shield-shapes employed in heraldic art has evolved through the centuries, of course, there are occasions when a blazon specifies a particular shape of shield. These specifications mostly occur in non-European contexts, such as the [[coat of arms of Nunavut]] <ref>Government of Nunavut. n.d. About the Flag and Coat of Arms. Government of Nunavut, Iqaluit, NU, Canada. Accessed October 19, 2006. Available [http://www.gov.nu.ca/Nunavut/English/about/symbols.shtml here]</ref> and the former [[Bophuthatswana|Republic of Bophuthatswana]], <ref>Hartemink R. 1996. South African Civic Heraldry-Bophuthatswana. Ralf Hartemink, The Netherlands. Accessed October 19, 2006. Available [http://www.ngw.nl/int/zaf/prov/bophutsw.htm here]</ref> with [[North Dakota]] providing an even more unusual example, <ref>[http://usheraldicregistry.com/pmwiki.php?n=Registrations.20060825L US Heraldic Registry]</ref> while the State of [[Connecticut]] specifies a "[[rococo]]" shield. <ref>[http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=State.Connecticut American Heraldry Society - Arms of Connecticut]</ref>—mostly in a non-European context, but not completely, as the Scottish Public Register records an escutcheon of oval form for the Lanarkshire Master Plumbers' and Domestic Engineers' (Employers') Association, and a shield of square form for the Anglo Leasing organisation.

Traditionally, as women did not go to war, they did not bear a shield, instead, women's coats of arms were shown on a [[lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]]—a [[rhombus]] standing on one of its acute corners. This continues true in much of the world, though some heraldic authorities, such as Scotland's, with its ovals for women's arms, make exceptions. <ref>Stephen Slater. ''The Complete Book of Heraldry''. (Hermes House, New York: 2003), p.56.</ref> In Canada, the restriction against women bearing arms on a shield was eliminated. Non-combatant [[clergy]] also have used the lozenge and the [[cartouche]] &ndash; an [[Oval (geometry)|oval]] &ndash; for their display.

====Tinctures====
[[Image:tinctures.svg|left|thumb|]]
{{main|Tincture (heraldry)}}

Tinctures are the colors used in heraldry, though a number of patterns called "[[Tincture (heraldry)#Furs|furs]]" and the depiction of charges in their natural colors or "proper" are also regarded as tinctures, the latter distinct from any color such a depiction might approximate. Since heraldry is essentially a system of identification, the most important convention of heraldry is the [[rule of tincture]]. To provide for contrast and visibility, metals (generally lighter tinctures) must never be placed on metals, and colors (generally darker tinctures) must never be placed on colors. Where a [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] overlays a partition of the field, the rule does not apply. There are other exceptions - the most famous being the gold crosses on white chosen as the arms of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] when he was made [[kingdom of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]].<ref>Bruno Heim. ''Or and Argent'' (Gerrards Cross, Buckingham: 1994).</ref>

The names used in English blazon for the colors and metals come mainly from [[French language|French]] and include [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] (gold), [[Argent]] (white), [[Azure]] (blue), [[Gules]] (red), [[Sable (heraldry)|Sable]] (black), [[Vert]] (green), and [[Purpure]] (purple). A number of other colors are occasionally found, typically for special purposes.<ref>Michel Pastoureau. ''Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition''. (Henry N Abrams, London: 1997), 47.</ref>

Certain patterns called "furs" can appear in a coat of arms, though they are (rather arbitrarily) defined as tinctures, not patterns. The two common furs are [[ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] and [[vair]]. Ermine represents the winter coat of the [[stoat]], which is white with a black tail. Vair represents a kind of squirrel with a blue-gray back and white belly. Sewn together, it forms a pattern of alternating blue and white shapes.<ref>[[Thomas Innes of Learney]]. ''Scots Heraldry'' (Johnston & Bacon, London: 1978), 28.</ref>

Heraldic charges can be displayed in their natural colors. Many natural items such as plants and animals are described as ''proper'' in this case. Proper charges are very frequent as crests and supporters. Overuse of the tincture "proper" is viewed as decadent or bad practice.

====Divisions of the field====
[[Image:Divisions of the field.png|right|thumb|Divisions of the field.]]
[[Image:Ordinaries.png|thumb|left|Ordinaries.]]
{{main|Division of the field}}

The [[field (heraldry)|field]] of a [[shield]] in heraldry can be divided into more than one [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]], as can the various [[charge (heraldry)|heraldic charge]]s. Many coats of arms consist simply of a division of the field into two contrasting tinctures. Since these are considered divisions of a shield the rule of tincture can be ignored. For example, a shield divided azure and gules would be perfectly acceptable. A line of partition may be straight or it may be varied. The variations of partition lines can be wavy, indented, embattled, engrailed, [[nebuly]], or made into myriad other forms.<ref>Stephen Friar and John Ferguson. ''Basic Heraldry''. (W.W. Norton & Company, New York: 1993), 148.</ref>

====Ordinaries====
{{main|Ordinary (heraldry)}}

In the early days of heraldry, very simple bold rectilinear shapes were painted on shields. These could be easily recognized at a long distance and could be easily remembered. They therefore served the main purpose of heraldry—identification.<ref>[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. ''Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles''. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), 18.</ref> As more complicated shields came into use, these bold shapes were set apart in a separate class as the "honorable ordinaries." They act as charges and are always written first in [[blazon]]. Unless otherwise specified they extend to the edges of the field. Though ordinaries are not easily defined, they are generally described as including the [[cross]], the [[fess]], the [[pale (heraldry)|pale]], the [[bend (heraldry)|bend]], the [[chevron (insigne)|chevron]], the [[saltire]], and the [[Pall (heraldry)|pall]].<ref>Stephen Friar, Ed. ''A Dictionary of Heraldry''. (Harmony Books, New York: 1987), 259.</ref>

There is a separate class of charges called sub-ordinaries which are of a geometrical shape subordinate to the ordinary. According to Friar, they are distinguished by their order in blazon. The sub-ordinaries include the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]], the [[Ordinary (heraldry)#Subordinaries|orle]], the [[tressure]], the double tressure, the [[bordure]], the [[chief (heraldry)|chief]], the [[Canton (heraldry)|canton]], the [[label (heraldry)|label]], and [[flaunch]]es.<ref>Stephen Friar, Ed. ''A Dictionary of Heraldry''. (Harmony Books, New York: 1987), 330.</ref>

Ordinaries may appear in parallel series, in which case blazons in English give them different names such as pallets, bars, bendlets, and chevronels. French blazon makes no such distinction between these diminutives and the ordinaries when borne singly. Unless otherwise specified an ordinary is drawn with straight lines, but each may be indented, embattled, wavy, engrailed, or otherwise have their lines varied.<ref>Woodcock, Thomas & John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 60.</ref>

====Charges====
{{main|Charge (heraldry)}}
A charge is any object or figure placed on a heraldic shield or on any other object of an armorial composition.<ref>John Brooke-Little. ''Boutell's Heraldry''. (Frederick Warne & Company, London: 1973), 311.</ref> Any object found in nature or technology may appear as a heraldic charge in armory. Charges can be animals, objects, or geometric shapes. Apart from the ordinaries, the most frequent charges are the [[cross]]—with its hundreds of variations—and the [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] and [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]]. Other common animals are [[Deer|stag]]s, [[boar]]s, [[martlet]]s, and [[fish]]. [[European dragon|Dragons]], [[unicorn]]s, [[griffin]]s, and more exotic monsters appear as charges and as [[supporters]].

Animals are found in various stereotyped positions or attitudes. [[Quadruped]]s can often be found [[rampant]]—standing on the left hind foot. Another frequent position is [[Charge (heraldry)#Attitude of animals|passant]], or walking, like the lions of the [[coat of arms of England]]. Eagles are almost always shown with their wings spread, or displayed.

In [[English heraldry]] the [[crescent]], [[mullet (heraldry)|mullet]], [[martlet]], [[annulet (ring)|annulet]], [[fleur-de-lis]], and [[rose (heraldry)|rose]] may be added to a shield to distinguish [[cadency|cadet]] branches of a family from the senior line. These cadency marks are usually shown smaller than normal charges, but it still does not follow that a shield containing such a charge belongs to a cadet branch. All of these charges occur frequently in basic undifferenced coats of arms.<ref>[[Ian Moncrieffe]] and [[Don Pottinger]]. ''Simple Heraldry, Cheerfully Illustrated''. (Thomas Nelson and Sons, London: 1953), 20.</ref>

====Marshalling====
[[Image:Grenville Diptych edit2.jpg|thumb|right|An extravagant example of marshalling—the 719 quarterings of the [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham|Grenville]] [[Roll of arms|Armorial]] at [[Stowe House|Stowe]]]]
Marshalling is the art of correctly arranging armorial bearings.<ref>David Williamson. ''Debrett's Guide to Heraldry and Regalia''. (Headline Books, London: 1992), 128.</ref> Two or more coats of arms are often combined in one shield to express inheritance, claims to property, or the occupation of an office. Marshalling can be done in a number of ways, but the principal mode is [[Impalement (heraldry)|impalement]], which replaced the earlier [[dimidiation]] which simply halves the shields of both and sticks them together. Impalement involves using one shield with the arms of two families or corporations on either half. Another method is called [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartering]], in which the shield is divided into [[Cartesian coordinate system#Two-dimensional coordinate system|quadrant]]s. This practice originated in Spain after the 13th century.<ref>Thomas Woodcock & John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 14.</ref> One might also place a small [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] of a coat of arms on the main shield.

When more than four coats are to be marshaled, the principle of quartering may be extended to two rows of three (quarterly of six) and even further. A few lineages have accumulated hundreds of quarters, though such a number is usually displayed only in documentary contexts.<ref>Edmundas Rimša. ''Heraldry Past to Present''. (Versus Aureus, Vilnius: 2005), 38.</ref> Some traditions, like the Scottish one, have a strong resistance to allowing more than four quarters, and use instead grand quartering and counter quartering (quarterly quarterly).

===Helm and crest===
{{Main|Helmet|Crest (heraldry)}}
In [[English language|English]] the word "crest" is commonly used to refer to a coat of arms—an entire heraldic achievement. The technical use of the heraldic term [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] refers to just one component of a complete achievement. The crest rests on top of a [[helmet]] which itself rests on the most important part of the achievement: the shield.

The modern crest has evolved from the three-dimensional figure placed on the top of the mounted knights' helms as a further means of identification. In most heraldic traditions a woman does not display a crest, though this tradition is being relaxed in some heraldic jurisdictions, and the stall plate of Lady Marion Fraser in the Thistle Chapel in St Giles, Edinburgh, shows her coat on a lozenge but with helmet, crest and motto.
[[Image:Wappen Deutsches Reich - Herzogtum Sachsen-Altenburg (Grosses).png|thumb|German heraldry has examples of shields with numerous crests, as this arms of [[Saxe-Altenburg]] featuring a total of seven crests.]]

The crest is usually found on a [[torse|wreath]] of twisted cloth and sometimes within a [[coronet]]. Crest-coronets are generally simpler than coronets of rank, but several specialized forms exist; for example, in [[Canada]], descendants of the [[United Empire Loyalists]] are entitled to use a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] military coronet (for descendants of members of Loyalist regiments) or Loyalist civil coronet (for others).

When the helm and crest are shown, they are usually accompanied by a [[mantling]]. This was originally a cloth worn over the back of the helmet as partial protection against heating by sunlight. Today it takes the form of a stylized cloak hanging from the helmet.<ref>[[Peter Gwynn-Jones]]. ''The Art of Heraldry''. (Parkgate Books, London: 1998), 124.</ref> Typically in British heraldry, the outer surface of the mantling is of the principal color in the shield and the inner surface is of the principal metal, though peers in the United Kingdom use standard colourings regardless of rank or what the colourings of their arms. The mantling is sometimes conventionally depicted with a ragged edge, as if damaged in combat, though the edges of most are simply decorated at the emblazoner's discretion.

Clergy often refrain from displaying a helm or crest in their [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|heraldic achievements]]. Members of the clergy may display appropriate head wear. This often takes the form of a small crowned, wide brimmed hat, sometimes, outwith heraldry, called a [[galero]]  with the colors and tassels denoting rank; or, in the case of [[Papal coat of arms|Papal arms]] until the inauguration of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2005, an elaborate triple crown known as a [[tiara]]. Benedict broke with tradition to substitute a [[mitre]] in [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|his arms]]. Orthodox and Presbyterian clergy do sometimes adopt other forms of head gear to ensign their shields. In the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition, clergy members may pass crests on to their offspring, but rarely display them on their own shields.

===Mottoes===
An armorial [[motto]] is a phrase or collection of words intended to describe the motivation or intention of the armigerous person or corporation. This can form a pun on the family name as in [[Thomas Nevile]]'s motto "Ne vile velis." Mottoes are generally changed at will and do not make up an integral part of the armorial achievement. Mottoes can typically be found on a scroll under the shield. In [[Scottish heraldry]] where the motto is granted as part of the [[blazon]], it is usually shown on a scroll above the crest, and may not be changed at will. A motto may be in any language.

===Supporters and other insignia===
[[Image:Greater Coat of Arms of Ukraine.svg|thumb|right|The [[coat of arms of Ukraine]] uses a lion and a [[Cossack]] as supporters.]]
[[Supporters]] are human or animal figures or, very rarely, inanimate objects, usually placed on either side of a coat of arms as though supporting it. In many traditions, these have acquired strict guidelines for use by certain social classes. On the [[Continental Europe|European continent]], there are often fewer restrictions on the use of supporters.<ref>Ottfried Neubecker. ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols, and Meaning''. (Tiger Books International, London: 1997), 186.</ref> In the United Kingdom only [[Peer of the realm|peers of the realm]], a few baronets, senior members of orders of knighthood, and some corporate bodies are granted supporters. Often these can have local significance or a historical link to the armiger.

If the armiger has the title of [[baron]], hereditary [[knight]], or higher, he or she may display a coronet of rank above the shield. In the United Kingdom this is shown between the shield and helmet, though it is often above the crest in Continental heraldry.

Another addition that can be made to a coat of arms is the insignia of a baronet or of an order of knighthood. This is usually represented by a collar or similar band surrounding the shield. When the arms of a knight and his wife are shown in one achievement, the insignia of knighthood surround the husband's arms only, and the wife's arms are customarily surrounded by a meaningless ornamental garland of leaves for visual balance.<ref>Julian Franklyn. ''Shield and Crest''. (MacGibbon & Kee, London: 1960), 358.</ref>

==National styles==
[[Image:Jesus Coat of Arms 1.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an [[attributed coat of arms]]. Medieval officers of arms attributed this coat to [[Jesus]], though he lived a good millennium before the development of heraldry.]]
The emergence of heraldry occurred across [[western Europe]] almost simultaneously in the various countries. Originally, heraldic style was very similar from country to country.<ref>Davies, T.R. (Spring 1976). "Did National Heraldry Exist?". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''NS II''' (97): 16.</ref> Over time, there developed distinct differences between the heraldic traditions of different countries. The four broad heraldic styles are German-Nordic, Gallo-British, Latin, and Eastern.<ref>von Warnstedt, Christopher. (October 1970). "The Heraldic Provinces of Europe". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''XI''' (84): 128.</ref> In addition it can be argued that later national heraldic traditions, such as [[South Africa]]n and Canadian have emerged in the twentieth century.<ref>Alan Beddoe, revised by Strome Galloway. ''Beddoe's Canadian Heraldry''. (Mika Publishing Company, Belleville: 1981).</ref> In general there are characteristics shared by each of the four main groups.

===German-Nordic heraldry===
Coats of arms in Germany, the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Czech lands]] and northern [[Switzerland]] generally change very little over time. Marks of difference are very rare in this tradition as are heraldic furs.<ref>von Warnstedt, Christopher. (October 1970). "The Heraldic Provinces of Europe". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''XI''' (84): 129.</ref> One of the most striking characteristics of German-Nordic heraldry is the treatment of the crest. Often, the same design is repeated in the shield and the crest. The use of multiple crests is also common.<ref name="OGH-15">Thomas Woodcock & John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 15.</ref> The crest cannot be used separately as in British heraldry, but can sometimes serve as a mark of difference between different branches of a family.<ref>Neubecker, Ottfried. ''Heraldry. Sources, Symbols and Meaning'' (London 1976), p. 158 </ref> [[Torse]] is optional.<ref>Pinches, J.H: European Nobility and Heraldry . (Heraldry Today, 1994, ISBN 0-900455-45-4, p. 82 </ref> [[Heraldic courtoisie]] is observed.<ref>[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 88. </ref>
[[Image:Dambaek arms.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Danish coat of arms in the German-Nordic tradition]]

===Dutch heraldry===
Coats of arms in the [[Netherlands]] were not controlled by an official heraldic system like the two in the United Kingdom, nor were they used solely by [[Nobility|noble families]]. Any person could develop and use a coat of arms if they wished to do so. As a result, many merchant families had coats of arms even though they were not members of the nobility. These are sometimes referred to as ''[[burgher arms]],'' and it is thought that most arms of this type were adopted while the Netherlands was a [[republic]] (1581-1806).<ref name="AHS">[http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=President.Roosevelt Roosevelt Coats of Arms: Theodore and Franklin Delano] at [[American Heraldry Society]]. Accessed January 20, 2007.</ref>

===Gallo-British heraldry===
The use of cadency marks to difference arms within the same family and the use of [[wiktionary:semy|semy]] fields are distinctive features of Gallo-British heraldry. It is common to see heraldic furs used.<ref>von Warnstedt, Christopher. (October 1970). "The Heraldic Provinces of Europe". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''XI''' (84): 129.</ref> In United Kingdom, the style is notably still controlled by royal officers of arms.<ref>[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. ''Heraldry of the World''. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1979), 192.</ref> French heraldry experienced a period of strict rules of construction under the Emperor [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]].<ref>Thomas Woodcock & John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 21.</ref> English and Scots heraldries make greater use of supporters than other European countries.<ref name="OGH-15"/>

===Latin heraldry===

The heraldry of southern France, Portugal, Spain, and Italy is characterized by a lack of crests, and uniquely-shaped shields. <ref>von Warnstedt, Christopher. (October 1970). "The Heraldic Provinces of Europe". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''XI''' (84): p.129.</ref> Portuguese and Spanish heraldry occasionally introduce words to the shield of arms, a practice disallowed in British heraldry. Latin heraldry is known for extensive use of quartering, because of armorial inheritance via the male and the female lines. Moreover, Italian heraldry is dominated by the Roman Catholic Church, featuring many shields and achievements, most bearing some reference to the Church. <ref>Thomas Woodcock & John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), pp.24-30.</ref>

===Central and Eastern European heraldry===

Eastern European heraldry is in the traditions developed in [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Russia]]. Eastern coats of arms are characterized by a pronounced, territorial, [[clan]] system — often, entire villages or military groups were granted the same coat of arms irrespective of family relationships. In Poland, nearly six hundred unrelated families are known to bear the same [[Jastrzębiec coat of arms]]. Marks of cadency are almost unknown, and shields are generally very simple, with only one charge. Many heraldic shields derive from ancient house marks. At the least, fifteen per cent of all Hungarian personal arms bear a decapitated Turk's head, referring to their wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. <ref>von Warnstedt, Christopher. (October 1970). "The Heraldic Provinces of Europe". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''XI''' (84): pp.129-30.</ref><ref>Thomas Woodcock & John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 28-32.</ref>

==Modern heraldry==

Heraldry flourishes in the modern world; institutions, companies, and private persons continue using coats of arms as their pictorial identification. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the English [[Kings of Arms]], Scotland's [[Lord Lyon]], and the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]] continue making grants of arms.<ref> See the [http://college-of-arms.gov.uk/#newsletter College of Arms newsletter] for quarterly samplings of English grants and the [http://www.nli.ie/h_arms1999.htm Chief Herald of Ireland's webpage] for recent Irish grants.</ref> There are heraldic authorities in [[Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada|Canada]], <ref>See the [[Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada]] at [http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/main.asp?lang=e&welcome=true this page]</ref> South Africa, Spain, and Sweden that grant or register coats of arms.

Heraldic societies abound in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Australasia]], the [[Americas]], and Europe. Heraldry aficionados participate in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], medieval revivals, [[micronation]]alism, et cetera. People see heraldry as a part of their national and personal heritages, and as a manifestation of civic and national pride. Today, heraldry is not a worldly expression of aristocracy, merely a form of identification. <ref>Stephen Slater. ''The Complete Book of Heraldry''. (Hermes House, New York: 2003), p.238.</ref>

[[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|Military heraldry]] continues developing, incorporating blazons unknown in the medieval world. Nations and their subdivisions — provinces, states, counties, cities, etc. — continue building upon the traditions of civic heraldry. The [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Church of England]], and other Churches maintain the tradition of [[ecclesiastical heraldry]] for their high-rank prelates, holy orders, universities, and schools.
