'''''Parasaurolophus''''' (meaning "near crested lizard", in reference to ''[[Saurolophus]]'') was a genus of [[hadrosaurid]] (duck-billed) [[dinosaur]] from the [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] (about 76-65 million years ago) of what is now [[North America]]. Three species are currently recognized: ''P. walkeri'' (the [[type species]]), ''P. tubicen'', and ''P. cyrtocristatus''.  Remains of this dinosaur are known from [[Alberta]] ([[Canada]]), and [[New Mexico]] and [[Utah]] ([[USA]]).  It was an [[herbivore]] that walked both as a [[bipedalism|bipedal]] and a [[quadruped]].

''Parasaurolophus'' is known for its large, elaborate cranial crest, which at its largest forms a long curved tube projecting upwards and back from the skull.  This structure has inspired much discussion in the scientific literature, but the modern consensus is that major functions included visual recognition and sound amplification. This striking feature has made ''Parasaurolophus'' one of the more common dinosaurs in [[pop culture]] applications.  Despite its cultural presence, it is one of the rarer duckbills, known from a handful of good specimens.

==Description==
The skeleton of ''Parasaurolophus'' is only partially known; the size of the [[type specimen]] of ''P. walkeri'' is estimated at about 9.5&nbsp;[[metre|meters]] (31&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length|ft]]) long. However, its skull and crest are only ~1.6&nbsp;meters (5.2&nbsp;ft) long, whereas the type specimen of ''P. tubicen'' is a skull with crest over 2.0&nbsp;meters (6.6&nbsp;ft) long.<ref name=LW42a>{{cite book |last=Lull |first=Richard Swann |authorlink=Richard Swann Lull |coauthors= and Wright, Nelda E. |title=Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America |year=1942 |publisher=Geological Society of America |series=Geological Society of America Special Paper '''40''' |pages=229 }}</ref>  Its weight is estimated at 2.5&nbsp;[[tonnes]] (2.7&nbsp;[[short ton|tons]]).<ref name=DFG97>{{cite book|chapter=Parasaurolophus |last=Glut |first=Donald F. |authorlink=Donald F.

Like other hadrosaurs, it was facultatively [[bipedal]], being able to alternate between two legs and four. It probably preferred a [[quadrupedal]] gait while foraging for food and assumed a bipedal mode for faster running.<ref name=HWF04>{{cite book |last=Horner |first=John R. |authorlink=Jack Horner (paleontologist) |coauthors=Weishampel, David B.; and Forster, Catherine A |editor=Weishampel, David B.; Osmólska, Halszka; and Dodson, Peter (eds.)|title=The Dinosauria |edition=2nd |year= 2004|publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-24209-2 |pages=438-463 |chapter=Hadrosauridae }}</ref> [[Integumentary system|Skin]] impressions are known for ''P. walkeri'', showing uniform "tubercle" scales but no larger structures.<ref name=WAP22>{{cite journal |last=Parks |first=William A. |authorlink=William Parks |year=1922 |title=''Parasaurolophus walkeri'', a new genus and species of crested trachodont dinosaur |journal=University of Toronto Studies, Geology Series |volume=13 |pages=1-32}}</ref>

The most noticeable feature would have been the cranial crest, protruding from the rear of the head and made up of the [[premaxilla]] and [[nasal bone|nasal]] bones. In the [[vertebra]]e of the ''P. walkeri'' type specimen, there is a notch where the horn would hit the back, but this may be a [[pathology]] peculiar to this individual.<ref name=DFG97/> The crest is hollow, with distinct tubes leading from the nostrils to the end of the crest, then flipping around and heading back down the crest and into the skull.

==Classification==

==Discovery and species==
{{Expand|date=March 2007}}
''Parasaurolophus'' is [[holotype|based on]] [[Royal Ontario Museum|ROM]] 768, a skull and partial skeleton missing the hind legs below the knees, and most of the tail.  It was found by a field party from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1920, near Sand Creek along the [[Red Deer River]] in Alberta, Canada.<ref name=WAP22/> This specimen, which William Parks named ''P. walkeri'', was found in rocks of what is now known as the [[Campanian]]-age [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]. No additional remains from Alberta that can be definitely assigned to ''Parasaurolophus'' have yet been described.<ref name=RE05>{{cite book |last=Ryan |first=Michael J. |coauthors=and Evans, David C. |editors=Currie, Phillip J., and Koppelhus, Eva |title=Dinosaur Provincial Park: A Spectacular Ancient Ecosystem Revealed |chapter=Ornithischian Dinosaurs |year=2005 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |pages=312-348 |isbn=0-253-34595-2 }}</ref> At about the same time (1921), [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg|Charles H. Sternberg]] recovered a partial skull from what is now known as the slightly younger [[Kirtland Formation]] in [[San Juan County]], New Mexico.  These remains were sent to [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]], where [[Carl Wiman]] described them as second species ''P. tubicen'' in 1931.<ref name=CW31>{{cite journal |last=Wiman |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Wiman |year=1931 |title=''Parasaurolophus tubicen'', n. sp. aus der Kreide in New Mexico |journal=Nova Acta Regia Societas Scientarum Upsaliensis, series 4 |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=1-11}}</ref> 

==Paleobiology==
''Parasaurolophus'' probably lived in large herds and inhabited flood plains. They were [[herbivores]] but they were not, as was once thought, aquatic. They were fully terrestrial animals, as evidenced by footprints. They could possibly swim but they lived their entire lives on land. ''Parasaurolophus'' may have been prey for large [[carnivorous]] [[theropod]]s, such as ''[[Daspletosaurus]]''.

===Cranial crest===
Numerous [[hypotheses]] have been put forward as to what functions the crest performed, including a weapon, acting as a [[snorkel]], supporting a [[proboscis]], housing [[salt gland]]s, and acting as an air trap or reservoir for diving.  Most of these have been discredited.<ref name=DFG97/> One unusual speculation, put forward by [[creationist]] [[Duane Gish]], is that the crest housed chemical glands that allowed it to throw jets of chemical "fire" at enemies, analogous to the modern-day [[bombardier beetle]].<ref name=DG92>{{cite book |last=Gish |first=Duane T. |authorlink=Duane Gish |year=1992 |title=Dinosaurs by Design |publisher=Master Books |location=Green Forest |pages=82 |isbn=0890511659}}</ref>  The most likely uses for the crest are multiple: it could have been used for amplifying sound for communication, and it could also be for visual display purposes.<ref name=HWF04/> It could have also improved the animal's sense of smell.  ''Parasaurolophus'' is often depicted with a flap of skin running from the bottom of the crest to the base of the neck, though there is no evidence of this.

==In popular culture==
[[Image:Parasaurolophus skull FMNH.jpg|thumb|200px|''Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus''.]]
* The character "[[Ducky (The Land Before Time)|Ducky]]" from ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' is identified as a ''Parasaurolophus'', though she more closely resembles its relative ''[[Saurolophus]]''.
* ''Parasaurolophus'' appeared in all three ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' films. During the ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' scene in the first film, when the camera trails to a full view of the park, a herd is seen near the lake. ''Parasaurolophus'' appeared again in ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' when [[InGen]] tries to capture [[dinosaur]]s for the [[San Diego]] [[Jurassic Park]]. This dinosaur appears again in ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''. The people on the island run into a herd of ''Parasaurolophus'' and ''[[Corythosaurus]]'' to escape ''[[Velociraptor]]''. 
* ''Parasaurolophus'' was featured in various moments of Disney's [[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]] and in the much older ''[[Rite of Spring]]'' sequence of ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'', featured with a flap of skin under the crest.
* ''Parasaurolophus'' also appeared in Episode 6 of ITV's documentary series ''[[Prehistoric Park]]''.
* ''Parasaurolophus'' appeared as a dinozord (Parazord) in [[Power Rangers: Dino Thunder]] and in the Japanese [[Super Sentai]] program [[Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger]] which Power Rangers Dino Thunder was based on.
* ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' featured a race called the Voth, who evolved from ''Parasaurolophus'' and  left Earth when they developed space technology (see "[[Distant Origin (Voyager episode)|Distant Origin]]").
* Likewise, the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe depicts a ''Parasaurolophus''-like species called the [[List of Star Wars races (U-Z)#Vurk|Vurk]], the species to which [[Jedi Master]] [[List of minor Star Wars Jedi masters#Trebor, Coleman|Coleman Trebor]] belongs to.
