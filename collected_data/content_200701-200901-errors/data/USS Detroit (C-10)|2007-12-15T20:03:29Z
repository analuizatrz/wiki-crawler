The '''USS ''Detroit'' (C-10)''', a [[protected cruiser]] of the [[United States Navy]], was launched [[28 October]] [[1891]] by [[Columbian Iron Works]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; sponsored by Miss F. Malster; and commissioned [[20 July]] [[1893]]; Commander W. H. Brownson in command. It was the third ship to be named for [[Detroit, Michigan]].

''Detroit'' sailed from Norfolk [[5 October]] [[1893]] for [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]], and lay at anchor in the harbor to protect American citizens and interests during revolutionary disturbances in [[Brazil]] until returning to [[Norfolk, Virginia]] [[24 April]] [[1894]]. She sailed 16 October to serve on the [[Asiatic Station]] for 2 years, cruising along the Chinese coast, and visiting ports in Japan and Korea. ''Detroit'' returned to [[New York City]] [[17 May]] [[1897]], and after overhaul, sailed for Key West where she was based from [[16 October]] [[1897]], in view of the increasingly tense situation in the Caribbean.

''Detroit'' returned to the [[Caribbean]] in February 1899. She protected American interests in [[Nicaragua]], and then in September during the revolutionary movements in [[Venezuela]]. She remained at anchor at [[La Guaira]] during October and November, then returned to her base at Key West [[21 December]] [[1899]]. Except for two short cruises in 1900 into the Caribbean, she remained at Key West until May when she sailed to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] and was placed out of commission [[23 May]] [[1900]].

Recommissioned [[23 September]] [[1902]] ''Detroit'' sailed for the Caribbean in November for squadron maneuvers at Culebra and San Juan. She joined ''Fortune'' at [[Port of Spain, Trinidad]], in January 1903, and towed her around the coast of [[South America]] to [[Talcahuana, Chile]]. ''Detroit'' operated between [[Montevideo, Uruguay]], and Bahia and [[Santos, Brazil]], until January 1904 when she arrived at [[Puerto Plata, Santo Domingo]], to protect American interests in the revolution-torn island. Her diplomatic offices resulted in a peace conference in June, followed by a capitulation by the insurgent army at Monte Cristi.

Except for a brief cruise to Boston and on to [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] in the summer of 1904, ''Detroit'' remained off troubled [[Santo Domingo]]. She returned to Boston in July 1905, was placed out of commission [[1 August]] [[1905]], and sold [[22 December]] [[1910]].
