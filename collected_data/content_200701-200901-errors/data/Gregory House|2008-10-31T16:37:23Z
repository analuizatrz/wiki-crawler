'''Gregory House''', [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], is a [[fictional character]] and [[protagonist]] of the American [[medical drama]] ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. Portrayed by [[Hugh Laurie]], the character is a [[wiktionary:maverick|maverick]] medical [[genius]] who heads a team of [[diagnosis|diagnosticians]] at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital. House's character has been described as a "[[misanthropy|misanthrope]]", a "[[cynic]]" and a "[[wiktionary:curmudgeon|curmudgeon]]", the last of which was named one of the top television words of 2006 in honor of the character.<ref>{{cite web |   title=TeleWORDS - 'Refugee' Tops 'Desperation' and 'Camp Cupcake' as Top Television Buzzword of the 2005 |  publisher= Global Language Monitor | date=[[2006-12-18]] | url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/?page_id=20 |  accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> 

On the series, the character's unorthodox diagnostic approaches, radical therapeutic motives, and stalwart rationality has resulted in much conflict between himself and his colleagues.<ref>{{Citation | last=Kristine | first=Diane | publication-date=[[2005-04-23]] | title=Ending Season Three With a Bang?

The character is partly inspired by [[Sherlock Holmes]].<ref name="Holmes">{{Citation | last=O'Hare| first=Kate | publication-date=[[2005-01-05]] | title=Building 'House' Is Hard Work| periodical=Zap2It| url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C92770%7C1%7C,00.html| accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref><ref name="radio">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/house/house-and-holmes-parallels/|title=House and Holmes parallels - Radio Times, January 2006|publisher=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref>

A large portion of the show's plot centers on House's use of [[Vicodin]] to manage pain stemming from an [[infarction]] in his [[Quadriceps femoris muscle|quadriceps muscle]] some years earlier, an injury that forces him to walk with a cane. Although his colleagues, doctors [[James Wilson (House)|James Wilson]] and Lisa Cuddy, have encouraged him to go to [[drug rehabilitation]] several times, so far, no attempts have successfully gotten House off the drug. This addiction is one of the many parallels to Sherlock Holmes, who is addicted to [[cocaine]].<ref name="Season5predictwithHolmes">{{cite news|url=http://holmes.spontaneousderivation.com/2008/05/31/a-house-md-and-sherlock-holmes-special-predicting-house-season-five-based-on-the-sherlock-holmes-canon/|title=A House, MD and Sherlock Holmes Special: Predicting House Season Five Based On the Sherlock Holmes Canon|first=Arachne|last=Jericho|date=2008-05-31|publisher=Holmesian Derivations, ''A 21st century look at Sherlock Holmes.''|accessdate=2008-09-27}}</ref>

[[Image:HouseRightDamagedLeg.JPG|thumb|left|House's thigh, scarred from infarction surgery]]
Dr. House loves his mother but hates his father, who he claims has an "insane moral compass", and deliberately attempts to avoid both parents.<ref name="daddy's boy" /> At one point, House tells a story of his parents leaving him with his grandmother or 'oma' whose punishments constituted [[Child abuse|abuse]].

About ten years before the series began, House entered into a relationship with [[List of House characters#Stacy Warner|Stacy Warner]] ([[Sela Ward]]), a [[constitutional law]]yer, after she shot him during a "Lawyer vs. Doctors" paintball match. Five years later, during a game of golf, he suffered an [[infarction]] in his right leg, which went misdiagnosed for three days due to doctors' concerns that he was exhibiting drug seeking behavior (House eventually diagnosed the infarction himself). An [[aneurysm]] in his thigh had clotted, leading to an infarction and causing his [[Quadriceps femoris muscle|quadriceps]] muscles to become [[necrosis|necrotic]]. House had the dead muscle bypassed in order to restore circulation to the remainder of his leg, risking organ failure and cardiac arrest. He was willing to endure excruciating post operative pain to retain the use of his leg. After House was put into a chemically-induced [[coma]] to sleep through the worst of the pain, Stacy, House's medical proxy, acted against his wishes and authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure between [[amputation]] and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle. This resulted in the partial loss of use in his leg, and left House with a lesser, but still serious, level of pain for the rest of his life. House could not forgive Stacy for making the decision, so she left him.<ref name="threestories">{{cite episode | title = Three Stories| episodelink = Three Stories (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2005-05-17| season = 1| number = 21}}</ref> House now suffers [[chronic pain]] in his leg, and uses a [[cane]] to aid his walking and takes [[Vicodin]] frequently to relieve his pain. 

At the beginning of season three, House temporarily regains his ability to walk and run after receiving [[ketamine]] treatment. However, the chronic pain in his leg comes back and House takes Vicodin and uses his cane once again.  The other doctors speculate that his cane and Vicodin re-usage are due to his psychological tendencies.

When Stacy makes her first appearance in the series, she is married to a high school guidance counselor named Mark Warner.<ref name="honeymoon" /> Although House and Stacy grow closer together and reunite briefly during the second season, House tells Stacy to go back to her husband, which devastates her.

==Characterization==
House's character frequently shows his cunning and biting wit, enjoys picking people apart, and often mocks their weaknesses.<ref name="scorn"/> House accurately deciphers people's motives and histories from aspects of their personality and appearance.<ref>{{cite web| last=Holland | first =Roger | title =House: Season Four Premiere| work = | publisher = PopMatters| date =[[2006-05-01]] | url =http://www.popmatters.com/pm/tv/reviews/48955/house/| accessdate =2007-09-27}}</ref> [[James Wilson (House)|Dr. James Wilson]] says that while "some doctors have the [[Messiah complex (self-concept)|Messiah complex]] &mdash; they need to save the world", House has "a [[Rubik's Cube|Rubik's]] complex" &mdash; he needs "to solve the puzzle".<ref name="romantic">{{cite web

However, he impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses after seemingly not paying attention. This skill is demonstrated in a scene where House diagnoses an entire waiting room full of patients in little over one minute on his way out of the hospital clinic.<ref name="sports">{{cite episode | title = Sports Medicine| episodelink = Sports Medicine (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2005-02-22| season = 1| number = 12}}</ref>

His crankiness is commonly attributed to the chronic pain in his leg (as a result of the [[infarction]]) for which he requires the aid of a cane. According to Stacy Warner, his former girlfriend, <!-- Stacy was not his wife, before changing this, please see [http://www.usanetwork.com/series/house/theshow/characterprofiles/ward/index.html] or [http://www.fox.com/house/recaps/121.htm]-->he was "pretty much the same" before the infarction, and his boss Lisa Cuddy claimed that after the surgery he was "an egomaniacal, narcissistic pain in the ass &mdash; same as before".<ref name="honeymoon">{{cite episode | title = Honeymoon| episodelink = Honeymoon (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2005-05-24| season = 1| number = 22}}</ref><ref name="needtoknow">{{cite episode | title = Need to Know| episodelink = Need to Know (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2005-02-07| season = 2| number = 11}}</ref> For his chronic leg pain, House takes Vicodin every day, and as a result has developed an addiction to the drug.<ref>{{Citation | last=Kristine | first=Diane | publication-date=[[2005-10-24]] | title=Constructing House: An Interview With House, M.D. Writer Lawrence Kaplow | periodical=Blog Critics| url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2005/10/24/213107.php| accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> He concedes that he has an [[drug addiction|addiction]], but says that the addiction is not a problem because it does not interfere with his work.<ref name="Detox">{{cite episode | title = Detox| episodelink = Detox (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2005-02-15| season = 1| number = 11}}</ref>

A [[polyglot]], House speaks [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Hindi]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. He is an [[Atheism|atheist]], openly mocking colleagues or patients who express any level of belief in any aspect of religion.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogcritics.org/archives/2007/11/12/111004.php|title= The Church of House|accessdate=2008-02-09 |last= Kristine|first= Diane|date= [[2007-11-12]]|publisher=[[Blogcritics]]}}</ref><ref name="church">{{cite web

House frequently says "Everybody lies", but jokingly remarked that he was [[Liar paradox|lying when he said that]] in the first season finale.<ref name="fullhouse">{{cite online journal | last = Jensen | first = Jeff | year = 2007 | month = April | title = Full 'House' | journal = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | volume = 928 | url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20016394,00.html | accessdate = 2007-09-12}}</ref> House criticizes social etiquette for lack of rational purpose and usefulness. In one episode, he explains how he envies an [[Autism|autistic]] patient because society allows the patient to forgo the niceties that he must suffer through.  Later in the same episode, Dr. Wilson suggests that House might have [[Asperger syndrome]], which is characterized by a number of traits found in House, such as difficulty accepting the purpose of social rules, lack of concern for his physical appearance, and resistance to change.

House is a strong [[Nonconformism|nonconformist]] and gives little regard to how others perceive him.<ref name="badmood" /> Throughout the series, he displays [[Sardonicism|sardonic]] contempt for authority figures. House shows an almost constant disregard for his own appearance, possessing a permanent stubble and dressing informally in jeans and a t-shirt. He avoids wearing the standard white lab coat to avoid patients recognizing him as a doctor.<ref name="pilot">{{cite episode | title = Pilot | episodelink = Pilot (House)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2004-11-16| season = 1| number = 1}}</ref>

House has quietly admitted, at several instances, that he is grateful for Wilson's presence, including referring to Wilson as his best friend. When Wilson resigns and moves away from both New Jersey and House's friendship during season 5, House obviously is desperate to have his friend back, hiring a private investigator to spy on him. They finally reconcile at House's father's funeral.

==Concept and creation==
Hugh Laurie describes House as a character who refuses to "obey the usual pieties of modern life" and expects to find a rare diagnosis when he is treating his patient.<ref name="fullhouse" /><ref name="badmood" /> As a protagonist, many aspects of his personality are the antithesis of what might be expected from a [[physician|doctor]].<ref name="scorn">{{Citation

Despite his sardonic personality, [[Lisa Edelstein]] says House is a character who is reliant on people surrounding him.<ref name="fullhouse" /> Edelstein says this characteristic is portrayed on several occasions in the third season, during which House's medical career is in jeopardy due to investigations by Detective Michael Tritter, who arrests him for possessing narcotics. House's legal trouble ends when Edelstein's character Lisa Cuddy commits [[perjury]] during his hearing.

Adopting an American accent for his role has been difficult for Laurie, who says words such as "coronary artery" are particularly tricky to pronounce.<ref>{{cite web| last =Mann | first =Dennis | title =Hugh Laurie Makes a House Call |  publisher = ''WebMD''| date =[[2006-12-18]] | url =http://men.webmd.com/features/hugh-laurie-interview?page=1|  accessdate =2007-10-12}}</ref> The cane tricks that are seen throughout the series are created by Laurie himself.<ref name="messed up">{{cite web| last =Ryan | first =Maureen | title ='House'-a-palooza: On Omar Epps' Emmy bid, Wilson's messed-up life and stupid cane tricks | work = The Watcher| publisher = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''| date =[[2006-05-01]] | url =http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/05/house_isnt_wait.html |  accessdate =2007-10-12}}</ref>

Holmes lives at 221B Baker Street, and House also lives at 221B.<ref name="fullhouse" /> The name of House's shooter in "[[No Reason (House)|No Reason]]", Jack Moriarty, coincides with Sherlock Holmes' adversary, [[Professor Moriarty|Professor James Moriarty]].<ref name="radio" /><ref>{{Citation | last=Kristine | first=Diane | publication-date=[[2006-05-24]] | title=TV Review: House Season Finale - "No Reason"| periodical=Blog Critics |url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/24/011244.php | accessdate=2007-10-09

===Casting===
Before Hugh Laurie auditioned for the role of Gregory House, he was filming ''[[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|Flight of the Phoenix]]'' in [[Namibia]]. Laurie planned to audition for the roles of both James Wilson and Gregory House. When Laurie read that Wilson was a character with a "handsome open face", he decided to audition solely for the role of House.<ref>{{Citation | last=Byrne | first=Bridget| publication-date=[[2004-11-23]] | title=British actor set for U.S. fame with offbeat M.D. role| periodical=[[The Press Enterprise]] | publication-place= [[Riverside, California]] | publisher= Press-Enterprise Company| url=http://www.pe.com/entertainment/stories/PE_Fea_Ent_housestar.a1444.html | accessdate=2007-10-09
