{{TopicTOC-Geography}}

'''[[Geography]]''' is the study of the [[earth]] and its features, inhabitants, and phenomena.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geography |work=The American Heritage Dictionary/ of the English Language, Fourth Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/geography |accessmonthday=October 9|accessyear=2006 }}</ref> A literal translation would be "to describe or write about the Earth". The first person to use  the word "geography" was [[Eratosthenes]] (276-194 B.C.). Four historical traditions in geographical research are the [[spatial analysis]] of natural and human phenomena (geography as a study of distribution), area studies (places and regions), study of man-land relationship, and research in [[earth sciences]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pattison |first=W.D. |year=1990 |title=The Four Traditions of Geography |journal=Journal of Geography |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=pp. 202–6 |url=http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~kclarke/G200B/four_20traditions_20of_20geography.pdf |id={{ISSN|0022-1341}} |doi=10.1080/00221349008979196 }} Reprint of a 1964 article.</ref> Nonetheless, modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that foremost seeks to understand the world and all of its human and natural complexities – not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. As "the bridge between the human and physical sciences," geography is divided into two main branches – [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]].<ref>web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf.</ref>

The following outline is provided as an overview of and introduction to geography:

== Branches of geography ==

Geography is divided into two main branches: [[physical geography]] and [[human geography]]. Each of these branches is divided into a number of subfields:<br clear=both>

=== Geography, earth science, and Earth's spheres ===

: ''Main articles: ''[[Earth science]] and [[Earth's spheres]]''

Geography is a key component of [[earth science]], used along with [[physics]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]] to build a quantitative understanding of the principal areas or interactive ''[[Earth's spheres|spheres]]'' of the Earth system, including its:

* [[Hydrosphere]] - all water found on, under, and over the surface of Earth
* [[Biosphere]] - all life on Earth
* [[Lithosphere]] - the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and the uppermost [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] of Earth
* [[Earth's atmosphere|Atmosphere]] - the gases that surround the Earth (its air)

Other interpretations of this model of the Earth include the following additional spheres:
* [[Pedosphere]] - the outermost layer of the [[Earth]] that is composed of [[soil]] and subject to [[pedogenesis|soil formation processes]]
* [[Geosphere]] - solid parts of Earth (which consist mostly of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and [[regolith]])
* [[Anthroposphere]] - all parts of Earth modified by humans
* [[Cryosphere]] - sometimes included in the hydrosphere, the ice on Earth ([[ice cap]]s, [[glacier]]s, etc.)

== Regions of the world ==

: ''Main articles: [[Region]], [[Subregions]], [[Location (geography)|Location]], and [[Lists of places]]''

''Regions'' are areas, and can be defined by physical characteristics, human characteristics, and functional characteristics. The term is used in various ways among the different branches of geography. A region can be seen as a collection of smaller units, such as a country and its political divisions, or as one part of a larger whole, as in a country on a continent.  

=== The Continents ===
: ''Main article: [[Continent]]''

A ''continent'' is one of several large [[landmass]]es on [[Earth]].  They are generally identified by [[convention]] rather than any specific criteria, but seven areas are commonly regarded as continents. They are:

==== Ecozone ====
: ''Main article: [[Ecozone]]''

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) developed a system of eight biogeographic realms (ecozones):
* [[Nearctic]] 22.9 mil. km² (including most of [[North America]])
* [[Palearctic]] 54.1 mil. km² (including the bulk of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]])
* [[Afrotropic]] 22.1 mil. km² (including [[Sub-Saharan Africa]])
* [[Indomalaya]] 7.5 mil. km² (including the [[Indian subcontinent|South Asian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]])
* [[Australasia ecozone|Australasia]] 7.7 mil. km² (including [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], and neighbouring islands).  The northern boundary of this zone is known as the [[Wallace line]].
* [[Neotropic]] 19.0 mil. km² (including [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]])
* [[Oceania ecozone|Oceania]] 1.0 mil. km² (including [[Polynesia]], [[Fiji]] and [[Micronesia]])
* [[Antarctic ecozone|Antarctic]] 0.3 mil. km² (including [[Antarctica]]).

==== Ecoregions ====
: ''Main article: [[Ecoregion]]''

Ecozones are further divided into ecoregions.  The World has over 800 [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s.  ''See [[Lists of ecoregions by country]].''

=== Countries of the World ===
: ''Main article: [[Political division]]''

A '''political division''', usually a [[country]], is a region under the control of a [[government]].  Countries are further divided into [[administrative division]]s including [[state (subnational)|states]], [[county|counties]], [[city|cities]], etc.

== Geographical features ==
Regions are further differentiated by virtue of being geographical features, or by the geographical features in them (or both).  A geographical feature is a [[landform]], a [[body of water]], or an artificial creation large enough to show up on a regional map.

=== Natural geographical features ===
Features of the World that are naturally occurring''':

==== Landforms ====
: ''Main article: [[Landform]]''

A ''landform'' is part of the [[terrain]], defined by its shape and location in the landscape, and is typically an element of [[topography]].  Landforms are characterized by aspects such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type.  Examples of landforms''':

==== Bodies of water ====
: Main article: [[Body of water]]''

A ''body of water'' is any significant accumulation of [[water]] on a geographical scale.  Some bodies of water can be man-made, but most are naturally occurring.  Some bodies of water collect and move water, such as rivers and streams, and others primarily hold water, such as lakes and oceans. Bodies of water that are [[navigation|navigable]] are known as [[waterways]].

''Demography'' is the statistical study of [[populations]]. It is an applied science used to analyze [[population dynamics|dynamic populations]], that is, those that change over time or space.  It encompasses the study of the size, structure and distribution of populations, and spatial and/or temporal changes in them in response to [[birth]], [[death]], [[Migration (human)|migration]]  and [[aging]].

A ''geographer'' is a [[scientist]] who studies [[Earth]]'s physical [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[human]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Geographers are historically known for making [[map]]s, the subdiscipline of geography known as [[cartography]].  But they are not only capable of studying the physical details of the environment but also its impact on human and [[wildlife]] [[ecology|ecologies]], [[weather]] and [[climate]] patterns, [[economics]], and [[culture]]. Geographers especially focus on the spatial relationships between these elements.

* [[List of basic astronomy topics]] - while geography studies and maps the [[World]], astronomy is the study of the rest of the universe, and maps the stars and galaxies.
* [[Earth]] - there's a lot more to a planet than its geography.  Some fields closely related to geography are:
** [[Geology]] - while geography studies the surface of the Earth and the location of things on it, geology is the study of the Earth itself, that is, its solid matter: the ground, what it is made of, and what is beneath it.
** [[Oceanography]] - while geography names and maps bodies of water, oceonography studies the large ones, the water they contain, and the life they contain.
* [[Universe]] - the place where the World exists.
