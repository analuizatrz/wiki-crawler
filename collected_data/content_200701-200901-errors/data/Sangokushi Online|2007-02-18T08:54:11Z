'''Sangokushi Online''' (三國志 Online) is KOEI's 3rd online Romance of the Three Kingdoms game for PC platform.

[[Koei]] announced the development of the latest [[MMORPG]] in mid-2006.  Koei plans on releasing Sangokushi Online in Japan in the first quarter of 2007 followed by the rest of Asia (Koei [http://www.koei.co.jp/flash/financial/pdfs/20061121_2.pdf]).  Additionally, these plans do not reference a possible North American or European release even though the game is developed in a multilingual country.  Although this follows in Koei's tradition for Asia-only releases such as  [[Nobunaga's Ambition Online]] and [[Uncharted Waters Online]].
