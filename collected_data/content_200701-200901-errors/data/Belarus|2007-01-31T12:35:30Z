'''Belarus''' ({{lang-be|Беларусь}}, [[Łacinka]]: Biełaruś; {{lang-pl|Białoruś}}; {{lang-ru|Белару́сь}}) is a [[landlocked]] [[country]] in [[Eastern Europe]], bordering [[Russia]] to its East, [[Ukraine]] to its South, [[Poland]] to its West, [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]] to its North. Its capital is [[Minsk]], and other important cities include [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], [[Hrodna|Grodno]], [[Homyel|Gomel]], [[Mogilev]] and [[Vitebsk]]. One third of the country's surface is forest.

At different points in history, today's territory of Belarus has been part of several countries including the [[Duchy of Polatsk]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. Belarus became a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] republic in 1922 (see [[Byelorussian SSR]]). The republic officially declared its sovereignty on [[27 August]] [[1990]], and following the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse]] of the Soviet Union, declared independence on [[25 August]] [[1991]]. Since 1994, [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the country's president. Belarus is currently in negotiations with Russia to unify into a single state; the [[Union of Russia and Belarus]].

==History of the name==
Historically, the country was referred to in [[English language|English]] as "[[White Russia]]". Although this is not exactly correct &ndash; the correct translation is  "White [[Ruthenia]]," which either describes the area of Eastern Europe populated by Slavic people or the various states that occupied the area.<ref>http://www.halgal.com/ruthenian.html</ref> Despite this, the practice of using the term White Russia continues as of 2006 with the following languages: "Weißrussland" in [[German language|German]], "Beyaz Rusya" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or "Λευκορωσία" (Leukorosía) in [[Greek language|Greek]] (see [[wiktionary:Belarus]] for the full list). <!-- Please don't insert any other languages' translations of Belarus; they belong on the [[White Russia]] page.  Thanks! --> The first known use of "White Russia" to refer to Belarus was in the late 16th century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]]. He used the term to describe the areas of [[Ivan IV|Ivan the Terrible's]] empire.  During the 17th century the Russian tsars used "White Ruthenia", asserting that they were trying to recapture their heritage from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. After the Commonwealth broke up, the lands that now make up Belarus were officially referred to as "Belarus" and "Belarusi", instead of the then-banned terms of "Litwa" and "Licwiny."<ref name="name">Belarus Gudie [http://www.belarusguide.com/history1/belname.html Nomen?... -"Litva","Belaja Rus'"?...]</ref>

The spellings '''Belorussia''' and '''Byelorussia''' are transliterations of unofficial alternative names of the country in [[Russian (spelling)|Russian]]. Officially, its Russian name is ''the Republic of Belarus'' (Республика Беларусь).<ref>http://www.gsnti-norms.ru/norms/common/doc.asp?0&/norms/stands/7_67.htm</ref> Belarus was named "Belorussia" in the days of [[Imperial Russia]], and the Russian [[tsar]] was usually styled "Emperor of [[All the Russias]] — [[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Russia|White]]". This practice continued throughout the [[Soviet era]], with the country taking the official name of the "[[Byelorussian SSR|Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]". Some Belarusians object to the name "Byelorussia", as it is an unwelcome reminder of the days under Russian and Soviet rule.<ref name="byelorussia">Pravapis.org [http://www.pravapis.org/art_belarusian_adjective.asp Uses and spellings of the word ''Belarusian''].

By using Google, the website looked up various terms and it found that "Belarus", the official short form of the name, was used on 93% of websites checked.

==History==
{{main|History of Belarus}}

[[Image:Rzeczpospolita 1920.png|thumb|Belarus and Poland after the result of the [[Polish-Soviet War]] in 1920.]]
[[Image:Minsk ww2.jpg|thumb|Minsk after the recapture of the city by the Red Army during the [[Great Patriotic War]].]]
Between the 6th and 8th centuries, what is now known as Belarus was settled by the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], who still dominate the country. The [[Early East Slavs]] gradually came into contact with the [[Varangians]] and were organized under the state of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']], mainly in the area around modern-day [[Polatsk]] in the northern part of the country. In the 13th century, the state was badly affected by a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion, and eventually parts of Rus' were swallowed up by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref>http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/grandduchy.htm</ref> The core lands of the duchy were territories around [[Kernavė]], [[Trakai]], [[Vilnius]] cities and [[Samogitia]]. During this time, the Belarusian territories were largely at peace, but duchy itself was often at war and had famous victories against [[Mongols]] in the east, [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] in the south and [[Teutonic Knights]] in the west. By the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania stretched across much of [[Eastern Europe]], from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]]. 

On [[February 2]] [[1386]], [[Grand Duke]] of Lithuania [[Władysław II Jagiełło|Jogaila]] was crowned King of Poland, and allied the Grand Duchy with [[Poland]] in a [[personal union]] under one monarch. This personal union eventually resulted in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a new state created in 1569. However, by 1795, the state was divided and annexed by [[Imperial Russia]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]] in the course of the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Belarus territories remained part of the Russian Empire until being occupied by [[Imperial Germany|Germany]] during [[World War I]].  Belarus first declared independence on [[25 March]] [[1918]], forming the [[Belarusian National Republic|Belarusian People's Republic]]. The Republic, however, was short-lived, and the regime was overthrown soon after the German withdrawal. In 1919 Belarus became the [[Byelorussian SSR|Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (BSSR), and after Russian occupation of eastern Lithuania merged into the [[Lithuanian-Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. After the [[Polish-Soviet War]] ended in 1921, Byelorussian lands were split between Poland and the recreated Byelorussian SSR, which became a founding member of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] in 1922. <ref>http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~MidLink/belarus/belarus.history.html</ref> In September 1939, the Soviet Union annexed the Polish-held Byelorussian land as a result of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]].<ref>http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/nazsov/addsepro.htm</ref>

In 1941, [[Nazi Germany]] launched [[Operation Barbarossa]], invading the Soviet Union. Belarus was captured soon afterwards, and [[Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany|remained in Nazi hands]] until 1944. Much of the country's infrastructure was destroyed and a large portion of its population was killed in the German invasion. The Jewish population of Belarus was also devastated during [[The Holocaust]]. It took until 1971 for the population of Belarus to reach the pre-war level. The Jewish population, however, never recovered.<ref name="warpop">{{cite web| url=http://countrystudies.us/belarus/11.htm| title=Country Studies - Belarus - Stalin and Russification| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> After the war ended, Byelorussia was among the 51 signatories to the founding of the [[United Nations]], in 1945. The reconstruction that took place in Belarus after the war brought comparative prosperity to the Soviet Republic. During this time, Belarus became a major center of manufacturing in the western region of the USSR. The increase in jobs brought in a huge immigrant population from the [[Russian SFSR|Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]].<ref name="Soviet-era">{{cite web| url=http://www.iexplore.com/dmap/Belarus/History|title=iExplore - Belarus History and Culture| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> During [[Joseph Stalin]]'s era, a policy of [[russification]] was started to "protect" Byelorussian SSR from influences by the West. <!--The plan was to have any trace of Belarus's cultural identity to be replaced by those of Russia. -->This policy involved sending Russians from various parts of the Soviet Union and placing them in key positions in the Belorussian SSR government. The official use of the [[Belarusian language]] and other cultural aspects were also limited by [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Moscow]]. After Stalin died in 1953, his successor [[Nikita Khrushchev]] continued the Russification program, stating in the Byelorussian SSR capital of [[Minsk]] that "The sooner we all start speaking [[Russian language|Russian]], the faster we shall build [[communism]]."<ref name="warpop"/>

In 1986, a section of Belarus was affected by the fallout from the [[Chernobyl]] power plant [[Chernobyl accident|accident]] in neighboring [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]]. When Soviet premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] began pushing through his [[Perestroika]] plan, the Belarusian people delivered a petition to him in December of 1986 explaining the loss of their culture. This event has been coined by historians as the "cultural Chernobyl".<ref name="Gorby">{{cite web| url=http://countrystudies.us/belarus/12.htm| title=Country Studies - Belarus - Perestroika| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref>

In June of 1988, [[mass graves]] were discovered at the city of [[Kurapaty]]. The graves allegedly contained about 250,000 of Stalin's victims. Some contend that this discovery was proof that the Soviet government was trying to erase the Belarusian people and caused some to seek independence.<ref name="massgraves">{{cite web| url=http://www.district87.org/staff/gordonr/russia/belarus.htm| title=Belarus Backgrounder| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref><ref name="Gorby"/> Belarus declared itself sovereign on [[27 July]] [[1990]], and the BSSR formally became the Republic of Belarus on [[25 August]] [[1991]], attaining full independence.  Around that time, [[Stanislav Shushkevich]] became Chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet]] of Belarus, the top leadership position in Belarus. Shushkevich, along with [[Boris Yeltsin]] of Russia and [[Leonid Kravchuk]] of [[Ukraine]] met on [[December 8]] [[1991]] in [[Belavezhskaya Pushcha]] to formally declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Since 1994, the country has been led by [[Alexander Lukashenko]], who has been criticized by Western governments, [[Human Rights Watch]], and other Western [[NGO]]s for his Soviet-style domestic policies. 

As of 2005, there appears to be a movement in Belarus towards reuniting with [[Russia]].  In November 2005, a draft constitution was sent to both [[Vladimir Putin]] and Lukashenko for approval.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20051114-102844-6237r.htm|title=Belarus union moves forward| first=Michael| last=Mainville| journal=The Washington Times| month=November 15| year=2005}}</ref> This move, along with others, is part of the 1996 plan created by Lukashenko and former Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] to create a [[Union of Russia and Belarus|union between the two nations]].

Belarus is a [[republic]], governed by a [[Leaders of Belarus|President]] and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]]—the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus|National Assembly]]—comprising a lower house, the 110 member [[House of Representatives of the Republic of Belarus|House of Representatives]], and an upper house, the 64 member [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]]. The House of Representatives has the power to appoint the Prime Minister of Belarus, make constitutional amendments, call for a vote of confidence on the prime minister and make suggestions on the foreign and domestic policy of Belarus. The Council of the Republic has the power to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president and the ability to accept or reject the bills passed from the House of Representatives.  Each chamber has the ability to veto any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the [[Constitution of Belarus]]. The Belarusian President since 1994 has been [[Alexander Lukashenko]]. The government is a [[Council (government)|Council]] of Ministers, headed by a [[Prime Minister of Belarus|prime minister]]; the members of the Council of Ministers need not be members of the legislature, and are appointed by the President. The judiciary comprises the [[Supreme Court of Belarus|Supreme Court]] and various specialized courts, such as the [[Constitutional Court of Belarus|Constitutional Court]], which deal with specific issued related to the constitution or business law. The judges of the Constitutional Court are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic.

In Belarus, while there are [[political party|political parties]] that either support or oppose President Lukashenko, the majority of the seats in the National Assembly are filled by those not affiliated with any political parties ("non-partisans"). However, there are three political parties who hold seats in the House of Representatives: the [[Communist Party of Belarus]] (8 seats), the [[Agrarian Party of Belarus]] (3 seats), and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus]] (1 seat). The other two parties that pledged their support to Lukashenko, the [[Belarusian Socialist Sporting Party]] and the [[Republican Party of Labour and Justice]], did not secure any seats in October 2004 election. Opposition parties, such as the [[Belarusian People's Front]] and the [[United Civil Party of Belarus]] did not gain any seats. The UCPB and the BPF are some of the parties that comprise the [[People's Coalition 5 Plus]], a group of political parties who oppose Lukashenko. Several organizations, including as the [[OSCE|Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe(OSCE)]], declared the election un-free due to opposition parties negative results and the bias of the Belarusian media in favor of the government.<ref name="OSCE">{{cite web| url=http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2004/12/3951_en.pdf| format=PDF| title=OSCE Report on the October 2004 parliamentary elections| year=December 2004| accessdate=2006-03-26}} - 404 error as of last access date</ref> However, in constitutional as well as political terms, the House is of marginal importance. At the 2000 election, it took four rounds of voting before all the seats were filled; in the end, 86% of the elected deputies were independents, and the remainder were the representatives of parties traditionally loyal to the president (OSCE, 2000). The [[Belarusian presidential election, 2006|next round of elections]] took place on March 19, 2006, and this election also included selecting the President. Lukashenko was opposed in the election by [[Alexander Milinkevich]], a candidate representing a coalition of oppositional parties. Another opposition candidate, [[Alaksandar Kazulin]] of the Social Democrats was detained and beaten by police during protests surrounding the Lukashenko sponsored event, the [[All Belarusian People's Assembly]]. This event, among others, have caused for concern that the 2006 elections had irregularities.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4766024.stm| year=2 March 2006| title=Belarus rally marred by arrests| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> The President won a landslide victory, over 80% of the vote.

==Administrative Divisions==
{{main|Subdivisions of Belarus}}
[[Image:Belarus.geohive.png|thumb|320px|right|[[Subnational|Administrative division]].]]
Belarus is divided into six [[province]]s ("[[voblast]]s"), named after the cities that serve as their administrative centers. The city of Minsk, located in the Minsk province, has the special status of being a national subordinate as it isn't included in any voblast. Subdivision into ''voblasts'' is inherited from the Soviet era.  Voblasts are further subdivided into ''[[raion]]s'' (commonly translated as "[[district]]s" or "regions"). Local legislative authorities (''raisovet'', "raion council") are elected by the raion's residents; local executive authorities (''raion administration'') are appointed by higher executive authorities. In the same way, each voblast has its own legislative authority (''oblsovet''), elected by residents, and an  executive authority (''voblast administration''), whose leader is appointed by the President.

(Administrative centers are given in parentheses.)

{{main|Geography of Belarus}}

Belarus is [[landlocked]], relatively flat, and contains large tracts of [[marsh]]y land. Lakes and rivers punctuate the country. The largest marsh territory is [[Polesia]], which is also amongst the largest marshes in Europe. There are 11,000 lakes in Belarus, but the majority of the lakes are smaller than 0.5&nbsp;[[square kilometre]]s (124&nbsp;[[acre]]s). Three major rivers run through the country, the [[Neman River]], the [[Pripyat River]], and the [[Dnepr River]]. Belarus' highest point is [[Dzyarzhynskaya Hara]] (Dzyarzhynsk Hill), 345&nbsp;[[metre]]s (1,132&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), and its lowest point is on the Neman River, 90&nbsp;metres (295&nbsp;ft). 

The [[climate]] ranges from harsh [[winter]]s (average January temperatures are in the range −8&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]](18&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) to −2&nbsp;°C (28&nbsp;°F)) to cool and moist [[summer]]s (average temperature 15&nbsp;°C (59°F) to 20&nbsp;°C(68°F)). On average, 15 to 30 [[centimeter]]s of snow falls in the country, mostly in the northeast. Belarus experiences an average [[rainfall]] of 600 to 700 [[millimeter]]s with over 70 percent of the rain falling during the warmer periods of the year. Due to the weather patterns, [[natural disaster]]s such as [[drought]]s and [[flood]]s occasionally occur in Belarus. Between the period of 1881 until 2005, the average temperature of Belarus rose 1 degree Celsius with the temperatures rising significantly during the winter and spring months. It has been projected that Belarus will face a 3 to 4 degree rise of the average temperature when the twenty first century ends.<ref>http://www.belarustourist.minsk.by/belarus/climate.html</ref>

Forest covers about 34% of the total landscape, making forestry products one of the most abundant natural resources in Belarus. Other natural resources to be found in Belarus include [[peat]] deposits, small quantities of [[petroleum|oil]] and natural gas, [[granite]], dolomite [[limestone]], [[marl]], [[chalk]], [[sand]], [[gravel]], and [[clay]]. About one fifth of the territory, mostly in the South-Eastern provinces of [[Homyel voblast|Homyel]] and [[Mahilyow voblast|Mahilyow]], continues to be affected by fallout from the 1986 [[nuclear power plant]] disaster in [[Chernobyl]], [[Ukraine]]. While the amount of radiation has decreased since the disaster, most of the area is considered uninhabitable.<ref name="Chernobyl">{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4485003.stm| publisher=BBC News| title=Belarus cursed by Chernobyl| first=Sarah| last=Rainsford| year=April 26 2005| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref>

Belarus is bordered by the following nations: Latvia (north), Lithuania (northwest), Poland (west), Russia (north and east) and Ukraine (south). Since the departure from the Soviet Union, Belarus signed a treaty with Latvia and Lithuania to [[demarcate]] the boundaries between the three countries. Ukraine signed a similar agreement with Belarus, though ratification on the Belarusian side is pending.<ref>http://www.gkpv.gov.by/en/state_border_en/delim_history</ref> As of 2006, Belarus and Lithuania began to demarcate their border using water boueys while 15 percent of the border between Belarus and Latvia has been demarcated.<ref>http://www.gkpv.gov.by/en/state_border_en/bord_dem</ref>

{{main|Economy of Belarus}}
The Belarusian [[Economic system|economy]] remains mostly [[state intervention|state-controlled]], as it has been since Soviet times. Over half of the business are state controlled and foreign ownership is under 4 percent.<ref>http://www.belstat.gov.by/homep/en/indicators/labor.htm</ref>  The country is relatively stable, economically, but depends to a large extent on raw material supplies, such as oil, from its close ally [[Russia]]. [[Industry]] and [[agriculture]] remain largely in state hands. Belarus is therefore one of the very few state-capitalistic national economies remaining. Agriculture is dominated by collective farming, with the major sub-sectors the [[cultivation]] of [[potato]]es and [[Animal husbandry|cattle breeding]]. 
Historically important branches of industry include [[textile]]s and wood processing. After 1965, creation of heavy industry and [[mechanical engineering]] ([[tractor]]s, [[refrigerator]]s) significantly strengthened the country's development. Within the Soviet Union, Belarus was one of the most industrially developed republics. Economically, Belarus engages itself in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], [[Eurasian Economic Community]] and [[Union of Russia and Belarus|Union with Russia]]. After 1990, with the introduction of free market structures into the former Soviet Union, industrial production plunged. Economic growth returned in 1996 and in 2001 Belarus was first of CIS countries to reach 1990 levels of industrial production and agricultural production, however the Belarusian economy is heavily subsidized by Moscow in exchange for political submission and the suppression of a Belarusian national revival. <ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d78317fc-a04f-11db-9059-0000779e2340.html]</ref>
Gross domestic product (GDP) for 2005 was $79.13 billion (estimate), which equates to an annual income of approximately $7,700 dollar per head. In 2005 [[gross domestic product|GDP]] increased by about 8-9%, with the inflation rate averaging about 8%.  According to the [[United Nations|UN]], average monthly income grew from 20 [[United States dollar]]s to 225 USD during the last 10 years.

Over four million people comprise the labor force in Belarus, with the females holding slightly more jobs than males. In 2005, nearly a quarter of the population were employed in industrial factories. Agriculture, manufacturing sales, trading goods and education are other sectors where employment is high. The [[unemployment]] rate, according to Belarusian government statistics, was about 1.5% in 2005. The number of unemployed persons totaled 679,000 with approximately two-thirds being women. The rate of unemployment has been decreasing since 2003, the overall rate has been lower since stastics were first taken in 1995.<ref>http://www.belstat.gov.by/homep/en/indicators/labor.htm</ref> 

The currency of Belarus is the [[Belarusian ruble]] (BYR). The currency was introduced in May of 1992, replacing the [[Soviet ruble]]. The ruble was reintroduced with new values in 2000 and have been in use since.<ref>http://www.nbrb.by/Natiobank/Banknotes/ENG/index.html</ref> As part of the [[Union of Russia and Belarus]], there has been discussion between both states to use a single currency along the same lines as the [[Euro]]. This has led to the suggestion for the Belarusin ruble to be discontinued in favor of the [[Russian ruble]] (RUB), starting on [[January 1]] [[2008]], according to Russian news agency [[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia|ITAR-TASS]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.naviny.by/ru/content/rubriki/2-ya_gruppa/inter/29-01-06-01/| title=Russia-Belarus Union to have common currency starting from 2008| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> The banking system of Belarus comprises with thirty state owned banks and one privitized bank.<ref>http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/country.cfm?id=Belarus</ref>

The Belarusian economy is impacted by the political situations inside the republic. The impact is mostly felt in the form of sanctions against the country or the leadership of Belarus. For example, the European Union adopted Council Regulation (EC) No 765/2006 on 18 May 2006. The Regulation provided for a freeze on the funds of President Lukashenko and between 30 to 35 high-level officials of Belarus. The sanctions also provided for travel bans for the aforementioned leaders. The sanction was imposed by the EU after the nation-block declared that the 19 March 2006 elections were fraudulent and for the crackdown on opposition groups. <ref>Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/05/F70F8119-C1B0-410C-A9BF-790C0034F3C9.html website]</ref>

==Demographics==
[[Image:Belarus-demography.png|thumb|230px|Change in the population of Belarus (1992-2003).]]
{{main|Demographics of Belarus}}
The majority of the [[population]] of Belarus are native [[Belarusians]], who comprise 81.2% of the total population of 10,293,011 people. [[Russians]] are the second largest group making up 11.4% of the population. The [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]] account for 3.9% and 2.4% of the population, respectively. 

Languages commonly spoken in Belarus are [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], which are both official languages of Belarus. 

The population density is about 50 persons per [[square kilometer]] (127/sq.&nbsp;mi) and 71.7% of the total population lives in [[Urbanization|urban]] areas. Of the urban population, 24% live in [[Minsk]], the national capital and largest city.<ref name="demographics">{{cite web| url=http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bo.html#People| title=CIA World Factbook (2005) - Belarus - People| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref>

Most of the population, 69.7%, are between the ages of 14 and 64. Sixteen percent of the population is under 14 years, while 14.6% are age 65 or older. The median age of the population is 37. The average life expectancy for Belarusian citizens is 68.72 years; for males it is 63.03 years and for females it is 74.96 years.

Most demographic indicators for Belarus resemble other European countries, notably with both the population growth rate and the natural growth rate in the negative. The population growth is currently at −0.06%{{inote|CIA Factbook}} in 2005, with a fertility rate of 1.43. The population is also growing older, and by the year 2050, the majority of the population will be over the age of 50.<ref name="census">{{cite web| url=http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/idbpyrs.pl?cty=BO&out=s&ymax=250| publisher=US Census Bureau| title=Population Pyramid Summary for Belarus| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> The migration rate is +2.3 for every 1 000 people in Belarus.

According to the [[Save the Children]] international organization report (comparing 167 countries) Belarus has the highest rating among all ex-USSR countries. It has 16 place for Mothers' index rank, 14 for Women's index rank and 20 for Children's index rank. Closest ex-USSR countries are [[Estonia]] (18 for Women's rank), [[Ukraine]] (21/31/26) and [[Russia]] (27/34/64)<ref name="savethechildren">{{cite web| url=http://www.savethechildren.org/publications/SOWM_2006_final.pdf| publisher=Save The Children| title=State Of The Worlds Mothers 2006| accessdate=2006-06-22}}</ref>

Traditional Belarusian dress originates from the time of [[Kievan Rus]] and over time was under the influence of cultures of neighbors: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Aside from its predominantly Ruthenian roots, [[Belarusian cuisine]] is very close to Lithuanian. It is sometimes considered as somewhat less rich and impressive than those of its imposing neighbors. In fact, however, this may result from the general lack of national identity which still continues to hold back the development of a nation and also led to the loss of many culinary traditions in the last 100 years. 

Certain aspects of the Belarusian culture have been lost over time because of the [[Russification]] period. President Lukashenko has introduced laws that force [[radio]] and [[television]] stations to showcase a percentage of Belarusian talent daily, but it does not specify whether the performance has to be in the Belarusian or Russian language. <ref>http://www.data.minsk.by/belarusnews/052005/17.html</ref> The said radio and television stations are state-owned, mostly controlled by the [[National State Teleradiocompany]] (TVR).

Musically, Belarus has a mixture of artists and styles, based on what language they sing. On the radio, Belarusian artists can be heard alongside Russian artists. Belarusian TV shows concerts, usually state run, showing the same performers along with military bands from Belarus. Famous rock bands from the country include NRM, Neurodubel, Ulis, Nowaje Nieba and Krama. Several Belarusian acts perform in Poland and Lithuania, where the population of Belarusian speakers are very high. Lithuania is also the host of the Belarusian alternative music festival Basowiszcza.<ref>http://www.freemuse.org/sw12630.asp</ref> Belarus, since 2004, has been sending artists to the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].<ref>http://www.tvr.by/eng/konkurs.asp</ref>

The Belarusian government sponsors many annual cultural festivals: "[[Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk]]"; "Minsk Spring"; "Slavonic Theatrical Meetings"; International Jazz Festival; National Harvesting Festival; "Arts for Children and Youth"; the Competition of Youth Variety Show Arts; "Muses of Niesvizh"; "Mir Castle"; and the National Festival of the Belarusian Song and Poetry. These events showcase talented Belarusian performers, whether it is in [[music]], [[art]], [[poetry]], [[dance]] or [[theater]]. At these festivals, various prizes named after Soviet and Belarusian heroes are awarded for excellence in music or art. Several state holidays, like [[Independence Day]] or [[Victory Day]] draw big crowds and include various displays such as [[fireworks]] and [[Military of Belarus|military]] parades. Most of the festivals take place in Vitebsk or Minsk.<ref name="festivals">{{cite web| url=http://www.belarusembassy.org/belarus/culture.htm| title=Belarusian National Culture| publsher=Embassy of the Republic of Belarus in the United States of America| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref>

Belarus has four [[World Heritage Sites]], two of them shared between Belarus and its neighbors. The four are: the [[Mir Castle Complex]]; the [[Niasvizh Castle]]; the [[Belovezhskaya Pushcha]] (shared with [[Poland]]); and the [[Struve Geodetic Arc]] (shared with [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Norway]], [[Moldova]], Russia, [[Sweden]] and Ukraine).<ref name="UNSECO">{{cite web| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/by| title=Belarus - UNESCO World Heritage Centre| accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref>
