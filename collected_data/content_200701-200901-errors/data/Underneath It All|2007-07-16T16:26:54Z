The song features [[reggae]] production, vocals from deejay [[Lady Saw]], and received mixed reviews from pop music critics. "Underneath It All" was released as the album's third [[single (music)|single]] in mid-2002 (see [[2002 in music]]) and was moderately successful. It was nominated for a [[Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Award]] in 2003 and received a [[Grammy Award]] for "[[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]" in 2004.

==Background and writing==
The song was originally written by Stefani and Stewart during Stefani's visit to boyfriend [[Gavin Rossdale]] in [[London]].  The two used backward string [[sampling (music)|samples]] to write the song in only ten minutes.<ref name="singles">"Underneath It All".  Montoya, Paris and Lanham, Tom.  ''[[The Singles 1992-2003]]''.  [[Interscope Records]].  [[November 25]], [[2003]].</ref>  The song describes Stefani's relationship with Rossdale, and the line "You're really lovely underneath it all" comes from journal entry that Stefani made after spending a day in the park with Rossdale.<ref>Strauss, Neil.  [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939747/no_doubts_anniversary_party/ "No Doubt's Anniversary Party"].  ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.  [[January 31]], [[2002]].  Retrieved [[July 14]], [[2007]].</ref>  Producers [[Sly and Robbie]] later added guest vocals from [[dancehall]] artist [[Lady Saw]],<ref name="singles"/> who wrote and recorded her part on the spot.<ref>"Deeper with No Doubt".  [[VH1]].  [[January 24]], [[2002]].</ref>

The song is a [[love song]] composed in the key of [[E major]].  It is written in [[common time]] and moves slowly at 69 [[beats per minute]].  The song is backed with a simple I-ii chord progression, alternating between a [[second inversion]] E major chord and a first inversion [[F sharp minor|F# minor]] chord.  Stefani's vocal range spans under an octave and a half during the song, from F#<sub>3</sub> to B<sub>4</sub>.<ref>Sheet music for "Underneath It All".  [[Hal Leonard Corporation]].  2001.</ref>

==Chart performance==
"Underneath It All" peaked at number three on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and number two for ten non-consecutive weeks on the [[Adult Top 40]] format. Although it was very successful in the U.S., reaction elsewhere was generally less enthusiastic. In Canada the song debuted on the [[Canadian Singles Chart|singles chart]] at number thirty-six and descended from the top fifty the following week. It became No Doubt's second-least successful Canadian single after "[[Ex-Girlfriend (song)|Ex-Girlfriend]]" (2000).

In the UK "Underneath It All" debuted at number eighteen and fell off the chart five weeks later. This feat echoed in Australia, where it peaked at number twenty-eight, but saw more success by remaining on the chart for seven weeks. In New Zealand it peaked at number eight for two consecutive weeks and garnered substantial [[airplay (radio)|airplay]].

The song reached the top thirty in [[Austria]] and [[Sweden]], the top forty in [[Brazil]] and [[Germany]], and the top sixty in [[Switzerland]]. It peaked at number eleven on the [[United World Chart]] for the week of [[November 23]] [[2002]].

A scene from the video was used for the cover of the song's [[CD single]].

"Underneath It All" peaked at number two on [[MuchMusic]]'s ''[[Countdown (MuchMusic TV series)|Countdown]]'' in late 2002.  The video received nominations for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the 2003 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].<br clear=all>
