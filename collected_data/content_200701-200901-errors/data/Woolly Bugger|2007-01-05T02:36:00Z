A Woolly Bugger is regarded as a very usefull fly pattern most fly fisherman. It's a popular wet fly for all [[game fish]].  The '''Wooly Bugger 's''' history is unknown. However it was said to have come from the Old English fly the [[Woolly Worm]], another productive fly. Most credit [[Russell Blessing]] with the actual invention
of the Woolly Bugger in the early 1970's in Pennsylvania. ([http://www.livingnow.info/story/3332/The_Ubiquitous_Woolly_Bugger Cameron Larsen])

The 'Bugger's popularity comes from its versatility, it can be tied in many color variations, in all sizes. It is commonly thought that it mimics [[leeches]], [[damselfly]] (or [[dragonflies]]) [[nymphs]], and [[stoneflies]], as well as some [[baitfishes]].    

For [[trout]] and [[steelhead]], common [[fish hook]] sizes are 6-14, with occasional use into size 2, which are quite large.  Larger gamefish prefer sizes 2-10, often in wild, often [[fluorescence|fluorescent colors]].  
    
The woolly bugger can be [[drifted]], to mimic a leech, "[[swung]]" to mimic a [[nymph]], or [[stripped]], to mimic a [[baitfish]]. Typically, a fisherman will use a woollybugger as a [[searching pattern]] or when fish turn finnicky.

Basic instructions for tying the woolly bugger include a large [[streamer hook]], a body of [[chenille]], a [[marabou tail]], and a full-body wrap of [[hackle]], grouped near the head.  Some tyers will include a strand of '[[flashabou]]' or [[tinsel]] for some extra flash.
