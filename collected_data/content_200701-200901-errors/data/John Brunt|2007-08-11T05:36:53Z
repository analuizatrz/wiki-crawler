'''John Henry Cound Brunt [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Military Cross|MC]]''' ([[6 December]] [[1922]]-[[10 December]] [[1944]]) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces. He served in Italy during the [[Second World War]] and was twice decorated for bravery in action before being killed by [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire. 

As a young man, he had a reputation for mischief and daring, but was always respected due to his consideration for others--traits that continued in his military career and would earn him the respect of his comrades and superiors. The actions that won him the Victoria Cross exemplified this behaviour, as despite being wounded he single-handedly held off enemy troops, allowing his men to reach safety.

==Early life==
John Henry Cound Brunt was born on Wednesday [[6 December]] [[1922]], in [[Priest Weston]], [[Shropshire]] to Thomas Henry Brunt and Nesta Mary Brunt ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Cound).  He had an elder sister named Dorothy (born [[13 May]] [[1920]]) and a younger sister Isobel (born [[5 October]] [[1923]].  When Dorothy was eight, the family moved to a farm near [[Whittington, Shropshire]] where John grew up. As he became older, his fearless nature became more apparent; every week, he read the comic ''"Tiny Tots"'', which featured instructions on "How to teach yourself to swim".  One day, he asked Dorothy to take him to the Shropshire [[Canal]] which went through the farmland.  Before his sister could stop him, John had taken off all his clothes and jumped into the canal!  When they finally arrived home, their mother wanted to know why he had no clothes on, and John responded that he had been teaching himself to swim.  As he got older, his daredevil attitude became even more serious; on one occasion, he was found swinging himself along the guttering of a [[dutch barn]] sixty feet above the farmyard.<ref name = "All for Valour">{{cite book|last=Snow|first=Richard|title=All for Valour (The Story of Captain John Brunt V.C., M.C.)|year=2006|month=September|publisher=The Marketing Solution|location=Paddock Wood, Kent}}</ref>

When old enough, John was enrolled at [[Ellesmere College]] where his mischievous streak became quickly apparent through pranks and dares; once, while in the [[sanatorium]] with [[mumps]], he even slipped a laxative into the matron's tea. Nevertheless, he is fondly remembered at the school.  It was while he was at Ellesmere that he contracted [[measles]], resulting in his need to wear glasses.<ref name = "All for Valour" /> An enthusiastic sportsman, John played [[cricket]], [[field hockey|hockey]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[water polo]] and [[wrestling]].  He was the only pupil at the school to tackle the headmaster while playing rugby, injuring the older man's knee in the process.<ref name = "All for Valour" />

In 1934, the Brunt family moved to [[Paddock Wood]] in [[Kent]] and, in his school holidays "Young John" (as he was known in the village) would come home.  While he was still a reckless individual, he was thought of very highly, and helped train the Paddock Wood [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] between 1940 and 1943, assisted by his father.  He spent his last days in Paddock Wood helping with the [[Hops|hop]] harvest.<ref name = "All for Valour" />

==Military career==
{{Rquote|right|John was one of the most popular officers in this Battalion, his light, energetic personality was a delight to all who met him... he carried out feats of daring that will long live in our memory.|Lt. Col. F.C.L. Bell|Letter to John Brunt's parents}}

John joined the army when he left school, training as a Private with the [[Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment]] in 1941, and got his [[Officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|commission]] on the 1st February 1943 and was posted to North Africa.  Although he was commissioned in the [[Sherwood Foresters]], he never served with them, instead being posted to the 6<sup>th</sup> Battalion of the [[Royal Lincolnshire Regiment]], having become friendly with Captain Alan Money, an officer in the Lincolns, on the boat to Africa.<ref name = "All for Valour" />

On [[9 September]] [[1943]], John's regiment landed at [[Salerno]] in Italy and Lieutenant Brunt commanded No.9 Platoon in A Company. The unit subsequently moved South East to establish a base in a farm near the river Asa.<ref name = "All for Valour" />

===Military Cross===
Between December 1943 and January 1944, Lieutenant John Brunt commanded a Battle Patrol and saw near-constant action.  In the early hours of [[15 December]], they received orders to destroy an enemy post based in some houses 200 yards North of the [[River Peccia]].  In efforts to break the enemy line, he crossed and re-crossed the river so many times that the troops took to calling it "Brunt's Brook".  After an intense five-minute bombardment, Lieutenant Brunt led a section into an assault.  The first two houses contained two enemy soldiers, but it was the third house that provided the most resistance.  Using grenades and [[Thompson submachine gun|Tommy guns]], they managed to kill eight enemy troops outside the house, as well as those inside, all belonging to the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion, 2<sup>nd</sup> [[Herman Goering Panzer Grenadier Regiment]].  After thirty minutes of intense fighting, the patrol withdrew, having had one man killed and six wounded.  While the rest of the section pulled back, Lieutenant Brunt remained behind with his Sergeant and a Private to retrieve a wounded soldier.  For his actions, John was awarded the [[Military Cross]].<ref name = "All for Valour" /><ref>[http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/archiveViewFrameSetup.asp?webType=0&PageDuplicate=n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&issueNumber=36394&pageNumber=0&SearchFor=john%20henry%20cound%20brunt&selMedalType=&selHonourType= The London Gazette, 24th February, 1944], Retrieved on the [[28 May]] [[2007]]</ref>

On the [[5 January]] [[1944]], Lieutenant Brunt was in a sick bed in a rear hospital.  He pleaded with doctors to be allowed to leave to take part in an attack, and was given permission, leading his patrol under heavy fire.  He was back in the hospital twenty-four hours later with concussion after a piece of shrapnel almost split his helmet, but would have carried on fighting if it had not been for an [[Non-commissioned officer|N.C.O.]] who forcibly led him away from the front line.<ref name = "All for Valour" /> At the end of the campaign, Brunt is said to have commented to his friends, "I've won the [[Military Cross|M.C.]], now for the [[Victoria Cross|V.C.]]!"<ref name = "All for Valour" />

===Victoria Cross===
After resting in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]], John Brunt returned to Italy on [[3 July]] [[1944]], having been promoted to temporary [[Captain (UK)|Captain]] and second in command of "D" Company.  By early December 1944, the regiment was operating near [[Ravenna]] fighting German troops who were retreating North through Italy and on the night of [[3 December]], the regiment began their attack on the town of [[Faenza]].  On the evening of [[6 December]], they took the village of [[Ragazzina]] near Faenza, and after heavy fighting the Lincolns had established defensive positions in Faenza itself.<ref name = "All for Valour" />

Early on the morning of [[9 December]] [[1944]], the German 90<sup>th</sup> Light Division delivered a heavy concentration of artillery fire against the Lincolns.  Despite an Allied artilley bombardment and airborne attacks, the German tanks continued to advance.  They overran Brunt's platoon, whose withdrawal was covered by Captain Brunt himself. Brunt proceeded to fire every weapon he could lay his hands on, including a Bren gun and an abandoned mortar, and he single-handedly killed 14 enemies and held up the infantry in front of his position before withdrawing in good order.<ref name = "Arthur VC">{{cite book|last=Arthur|first=Max|title=Symbol of Courage|year=2004|month=|publisher=Pan McMillan|location=London}}</ref>  By 11:00 the enemy's first effort had faltered, giving the Lincolns the opportunity to redeploy.<ref name = "All for Valour" />

Later in the day, a further counter-attack was launched by the enemy on two axes.  Captain Brunt armed himself with a spare [[Bren gun]] and rallied his men.  Leaping onto a [[M4 Sherman|Sherman Tank]] that was supporting his company, he ordered the commander to drive from one fire position to another while he sat or stood on the turret directing fire at the advancing enemy.<ref name = "Arthur VC"/>  When he noticed small enemy squads advancing with [[bazooka]]s, he jumped from the tank and, armed with his Bren gun, stalked the enemy parties, killing many of them personally and forcing the remainder to finally withdraw.<ref name = "All for Valour" /> Wherever the fighting was heaviest, Captain Brunt would be found, moving from one position to another, making use of whatever weapons came to hand, and encouraging the troops.<ref name = "All for Valour" />

The next morning, having won the battle and the acclaim of his regiment, Captain Brunt was as eager to return to the offensive, keeping alert for more trouble as breakfast was being prepared for the men, their first meal in 48 hours.  He was standing in the doorway of the platoon headquarters, having a mug of tea and chatting with friends, when a stray German mortar bomb landed at his feet, killing him outright.  He had celebrated his 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday just four days before.<ref name = "All for Valour" />

He was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] on 8<sup>th</sup> February 1945.<ref name = "All for Valour" /> John Brunt is buried at Faenza War Cemetery in Italy under a [[Commonwealth War Grave]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=2237026|title=Commonwealth War Graves Commision}}</ref>

==Victoria Cross Presentation==
On Tuesday [[18 December]] [[1945]], [[King George VI]] presented John's M.C. and V.C. to his parents at [[Buckingham Palace]].  John's father met Viscount General Alexander at the ceremony and said to him "I expect that you know many men who should have been awarded this medal", to which the General replied "No, because there is always only one who will do the unexpected and that day it was your son."<ref name = "All for Valour" />
