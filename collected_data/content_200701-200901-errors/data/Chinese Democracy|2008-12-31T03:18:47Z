'''''Chinese Democracy''''' is the sixth studio album by American rock band [[Guns N' Roses]]. It was released on November 23, 2008, worldwide and in the [[United Kingdom]] on November 24, 2008.<ref name="rs 22 october">{{cite web

Retail store chain [[Best Buy]] is the exclusive retailer of the album in the United States.

In a 2007 interview, [[Axl Rose]]'s close friend [[Sebastian Bach]] stated that ''Chinese Democracy'' will be the first installment in a trilogy of new albums. Bach also remarked that Rose had told him the third, as yet untitled, album has been slated for 2012.<ref name="Metal Edge article">{{cite web|url=http://aycu35.webshots.com/image/32634/2005390166215235814_rs.jpg

==Background==
{{main|History of Chinese Democracy}}
{{seealso|Chinese Democracy Tour}}
Guns N' Roses began to write and record new music in 1994. Ex-bassist [[Duff McKagan]] is quoted as saying, "[the] band was so splintered at that point that nothing got started".<ref name="time off">{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoff.com.au/index.php?area=Interviews&pg=38&subarea=38&sel=6127&PHPSESSID=b1255c323c0977e85e64fe287a9f7654=|title=Armed to the Teeth|publisher=''Time Off''|author=Condon, Dan|date=2005-03-06|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] has criticized Rose for making the band seem "like a dictatorship".<ref name="NY Times">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/06/arts/music/06leed.html?ei=5090&en=a13c0fac87670850&ex=1267851600&adxnnl=1&partner=rssuserland&pagewanted=all&adxnnlx=1195322585-YcO/12l8xR/GIod6+bXFQA|title=The Most Expensive Album Never Made|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|author=Leeds, Jeff|date=2005-03-06|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> Slash quit the band in 1996 with drummer [[Matt Sorum]] and McKagan both leaving soon afterwards.<ref name="slash autobiography">{{cite web| url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=84502| title = SLASH: AXL Quit GUNS N' ROSES To Gain Control Of Band | accessdate = 2007-11-18| date=  2007-11-09| publisher = Blabbermouth.net}}</ref> Slash was replaced by [[Nine Inch Nails]] touring guitarist [[Robin Finck]], ex-[[The Replacements|Replacements]] bassist [[Tommy Stinson]] replaced McKagan, and [[Josh Freese]] joined as the drummer. In early 1998, the band — which comprised Rose, Finck, Stinson and Freese along with long-time Guns N' Roses associate [[Paul Tobias]], keyboardists [[Dizzy Reed]] and [[Chris Pitman]] — began recording at Rumbo Recorders, a state-of-the-art studio in the [[San Fernando Valley]] where Guns N' Roses had partially recorded parts for their debut album, ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]''. During this time, [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] paid Rose [[United States dollar|$]]1 million to try to finish the album, with a further $1 million if he handed it in to them by March 1, 1999.<ref name="NY Times" />

In 2000, Rose hired [[avant-garde metal]] guitarist [[Buckethead]], and drummer [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan "Brain" Mantia]] to replace the departed Freese. Later on in 2000, Finck rejoined the band as the third guitarist. On January 1, 2001, Guns N' Roses played their first concert in over seven years at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. This was followed by their headlining performance at [[Rock in Rio|Rock in Rio III]] on January 14, 2001 in front of 190,000 people.<ref name="Rio review">{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1437951/20010115/story.jhtml|title = Guns N' Roses Kick Out The Jams At Rock In Rio|accessdate = 2007-12-02 |author=Loder, Kurt |date=  2001-01-15|publisher = MTV}}</ref> On August 29, 2002, the band made a surprise visit to the MTV [[Video Music Awards]], playing old songs along with a new "Madagascar" to an ecstatic New York crowd.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457257/20020829/ludacris.jhtml?headlines=true|title =Guns N' Roses Cap Night Of Spectacles From Diddy, Eminem, Timberlake|accessdate = 2008-11-21 |author=Jon Wiederhorn |date=  2002-08-29|publisher = MTV}}</ref>

[[Image:Download Feastival 2006 -1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Guns N' Roses on the ''[[Chinese Democracy Tour]]'' in 2006.]]
On December 14, 2006, Rose published an open letter to the band's fans on their website, claiming that remaining tour's shows were taking up time the band needed to finish recording ''Chinese Democracy''. Rose also revealed that the band had parted company with their manager Merck Mercuriadis, implying that the reason the album was not released in 2006 was Mercuriadis's fault (many times throughout 2006, Rose had said the album would be released that year). In the letter, Rose announced a tentative release date of March 6, 2007 for the album, however, the album was once again delayed.<ref name="Axl's open letter" /><ref name="Merck's letter">{{cite web| url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=84502| title =  Former Guns N' Roses Manager: 'I Believe In Axl Rose' | accessdate = 2007-12-22| date=  2006-12-15| publisher = Mercuriadis, Merck}}</ref>

On February 22, 2007, the band's road manager, Del James, announced that all recording for the album had been completed and it was in the mixing process, James stated that there was no release date for the album but that things appeared to be moving on after a number of delays.<ref name="DelJames" />

On September 14, 2008, "Shackler's Revenge" was released on the [[music video game]] ''[[Rock Band 2]]'', making it the band's first official release of new material since 1999's "Oh My God".<ref name="shackler's">{{cite web| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/08/14/guns-n-roses-shacklers-revenge-hits-the-web/| title = New Guns n’ Roses Leak: “Shackler’s Revenge”| accessdate = 2008-08-14| date=  2008-08-14| publisher = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''}}</ref> "Shackler's Revenge" was shortly followed by another release, "If the World", which, according to ''Rolling Stone'', plays during the closing credits of ''[[Body of Lies (film)|Body of Lies]]''.

===Sound===
{{seealso|History of Chinese Democracy#Leaks}}
In 1999, the [[industrial metal]] song "[[Oh My God (Guns N' Roses song)|Oh My God]]" was released on the ''[[End of Days (1999 film)|End of Days]]'' soundtrack. It featured current Guns N' Roses members [[Axl Rose]], [[Dizzy Reed]], [[Robin Finck]], [[Chris Pitman]], and [[Tommy Stinson]], along with  former members [[Paul Tobias]] and [[Josh Freese]]. [[Dave Navarro]] and Gary Sunshine also recorded guitar parts for the song. "Oh My God" was unpopular upon its release and was described by [[Allmusic]] as "a less than satisfying comeback".<ref name="NY Times" /><ref name="AMG-EoD">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:fxfrxqwkld0e|title=Allmusic: End of Days - Overview|accessdate=2006-11-17|author=Erlewine, Stephen|publisher=''[[All Media Guide]]''}}</ref> The sound of ''Chinese Democracy'' was often reported to be industrial rock music similar to [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], a style of which Rose had long been a fan. However, in a 2001 interview with an Argentine radio station, Rose stated the album wasn't industrial, and would vary in styles:
{{cquote|It is not industrial, the closest thing to that was perhaps "Oh My God", but there are some songs that won't be on the album that were this way.

In 2003, DJ [[Eddie Trunk]] spoke about the demo of "I.R.S.", which was leaked on his radio show:
{{cquote|It reminded me of Use Your Illusion-era stuff, with some modern flairs to it. The song had a loop track in the beginning, but then, when it kicked in, it was that same dramatic Guns N' Roses hard rock.<ref name="MTV Trunk">{{cite web

During the launch party for [[Korn]]'s 2006 tour, Rose conducted an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and told the magazine:
{{cquote|It's a very complex record, I'm trying to do something different. Some of the arrangements are kind of like [[Queen (band)|Queen]].

In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article in 2006, former [[Skid Row (heavy metal band)|Skid Row]] frontman [[Sebastian Bach]] described the album as "epic" and "mind-blowing" and added:
{{cquote|It’s a very cool album - it’s badass with killer screams, killer guitar riffs, but it’s got a totally modern sound. The word for it is ‘grand.’ It’s fucking epic.

Bach has also described the album as having "the rawness and the power of ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'', but it also has the grandiosity of '[[November Rain]]'."<ref name="RS-2007-09-26">{{cite web| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/09/26/proof-axl-rose-does-go-to-the-studio-photo-with-sebastian-bach/| title = Proof Axl Rose Does Go to the Studio: Photo With Sebastian Bach| accessdate = 2007-11-17| date=  2007-09-26| work = Rolling Stone}}</ref> He went on to describe the song "Sorry", which he sings backing vocals on:

{{cquote|There’s this one song called ‘Sorry’ that’s almost like [[doom metal]] with Axl singing really clean over this grinding, slow beat that is fucking mean, I cannot get it out of my head.<ref name="DiS-Bach" />}}

==Delays==
According to a March 2005 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article, production costs for the album have reached $13 million, making it probably the most expensive recording "never made."<ref name="NY Times"/> Then-Guns N' Roses manager Merck Mercuriadis, however, rejected the claims made by the article in a letter and claimed that the newspaper's sources had not been involved with the project for "six to nine years".<ref name="merck article">{{cite web| url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=33807| title = Guns N' Roses' Manager Manager Slams NY Times Over 'Rubbish' 'Chinese Democracy' Article| accessdate = 2007-11-17| date=  2005-03-06| work = Blabbermouth.net}}</ref> 

Rose issued a press release on Guns N' Roses' official website on December 14, 2006. Entitled "An open letter to the fans from Axl", Rose announced the cancellation of four concerts that were scheduled for January 2007. He stated that if the band fulfilled the concerts, "valuable time needed by the band and record company for the proper setup and release of the album ''Chinese Democracy'' would have been lost". Also in the letter, he confirmed that Guns N' Roses had parted company with Mercuriadis. Rose blamed much of the album's delay on Mercuriadis. Rose also announced a tentative release date for ''Chinese Democracy'' of March 6, 2007, and remarked that it was the first time the band had publicly named a release date for the album.<ref name="Axl's open letter">{{cite web|url=http://www.newgnr.com/articles/axlletter121506.html|title=An open letter from Axl Rose|publisher=GunsNRoses.com|author=Rose, Axl|date=2006-12-14|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>

Despite Rose's announcement, the album was once again delayed. On February 22, 2007, the band's road manager, [[Del James]], issued a press release definitively stating that all recording for the album had been completed. James elaborated, "There is no official release date, as the band is currently mixing, but after some delays and scheduling difficulties, things appear to be moving along."<ref name="DelJames">{{cite web|url=http://web.gunsnroses.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070222&content_id=a1&vkey=news&fext=.jsp
|title=''Chinese Democracy'' update|date=2007-02-22|author= James, Del|accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref>

In a 2007 interview, Sebastian Bach claimed Rose had planned to have the album released by Christmas 2007: "I know Axl was very serious about putting something out before Christmas. He was talking to me about it. He was talking about finishing liner notes." Bach also said that ''Chinese Democracy'''s delay might be because of business problems: "I think there's a lot of business shit that goes on with him. It's just not as easy. It's a little more complicated than people think."<ref name="Bach interview - RMM">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockmymonkey.com/interviews/07/11/SebastianBach.php|title=Rock My Monkey - Sebastian Bach Interview|publisher=Rock My Monkey|accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> Little was said about the record after this, and 2007 saw no official release of the new material.

In January 2008, rumors arose that ''Chinese Democracy'' had been handed over to Geffen Records, but had been delayed because the label and Rose could not agree on the marketing of the album.<ref name="antimusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/08/jan/10GNR_Finish_CD.shtml|title=GNR Finish CD?|publisher=antiMusic|accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref> [[Eddie Trunk]] also claimed Geffen might have the album: "I hear the new G&R CD is actually done, but the delay in release is not the bands{{sic}} issues but the label. There is so much money tied up in this record that in todays{{sic}} business it will be virtually impossible to be profitable, meaning the label might want to sell it off but can not find a buyer since nobody buys CDs anymore. Problem might not be Axl this time around and might keep this CD in limbo for more years to come. Hopefully it gets resolved."<ref name="Eddie Trunk blog">{{cite web|url=http://www.eddietrunk.com/blog.php|title=Eddie Trunk - Trunk Blog|author=Trunk, Eddie|publisher=Eddietrunk.com|accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref> However, in a February 2008 interview with Classic Rock Magazine, Rose's personal manager, Beta Lebeis, debunked Trunk's suggestion and was quoted as saying, "We're currently in negotiations with the record label".<ref name="Classic Rock article 2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/page/classicrock?entry=it_s_a_fact|title=It's a Fact|publisher=Classic Rock Magazine|accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref>

==Controversy and lawsuits==
===Title conflict with The Offspring===
On April 1, 2003, [[The Offspring]] announced that they would be naming their upcoming album ''Chinese Democrazy<!-- Note: This is the correct title - see the ref.. --> (You Snooze, You Lose)''. The Offspring's lead singer [[Dexter Holland]] elaborated, "You snooze, you lose. Axl ripped off my braids, I ripped off his album title."<ref name="offspring">{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470891/20030401/story.jhtml | title = Guns N' Roses' ''Chinese Democracy'' Snatched By Offspring | accessdate = 2007-01-08 | last = D'Angelo | first = Joe | date=  2003-04-01 | work = MTV.com}}</ref> However, it turned out to be an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke and The Offspring album was eventually released under the title ''[[Splinter (The Offspring album)|Splinter]]'' instead.

===Greatest Hits release===
In 2004, Geffen Records released ''[[Greatest Hits (Guns N' Roses album)|Greatest Hits]]''. Rose, along with former members Slash and Duff McKagan, attempted to block the album's release. They filed a lawsuit against Geffen, claiming the album was unauthorized and would damage the band's reputation. Rose also claimed it would distract the band from completing ''Chinese Democracy''. A week before the scheduled release, a judge denied their request for an injunction and the album was released.<ref name="AMG-GH">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:8iazqjkwojha=

===Dr Pepper promotion===
On March 26, 2008, various media outlets reported that [[Dr Pepper]] would offer a free can of Dr Pepper to everyone in America—excluding former Guns N' Roses guitarists Buckethead and Slash—if the band released ''Chinese Democracy'' in 2008.<ref name="Dr Pepper - NY Post">{{cite web|url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/03262008/gossip/pagesix/doctors_orders_103529.htm|title = Doctor's Orders|accessdate = 2008-03-27 |author=Johnson, Richard; Froelich, Paula; Hoffmann, Bill; Garvey, Marianne |date=  2008-03-26|publisher = The ''New York Post''}}</ref><ref name="Dr Pepper - Billboard">{{cite web|url = http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003741826|title = Dr Pepper Sweetens Pot For 'Chinese Democracy'|accessdate = 2008-03-27 |author=Cohen, Jonathan |date=  2008-03-26|publisher = Billboard.com}}</ref> Later on March 26, Rose replied to Dr Pepper on Guns N' Roses' official website and spoke of his surprise at Dr Pepper's support. Rose also said he would share his Dr Pepper with Buckethead as "some of Buckethead's performances are on [''Chinese Democracy'']".<ref name="Axl responds to Dr Pepper">{{cite web|url = http://www.gunsnroses.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080326&content_id=a1&vkey=news&fext=.jsp|title = Press Release From Axl Regarding Dr Pepper|accessdate = 2008-03-27 |author=Rose, Axl |date=  2008-03-26|publisher = GunsNRoses.com}}</ref> After it was announced that the album would be released in 2008, Dr Pepper confirmed that it would uphold its pledge.<ref name="bbc dr pepper">{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7688232.stm| title = Drinks firm to keep Roses pledge| accessdate = 2008-10-24| date=  2008-10-24| publisher = ''[[BBC]]''}}</ref> However, Dr Pepper's online distribution of free coupons upon the album's release November 23, 2008 proved less than adequate. Lawyers for the band threatened Dr Pepper's parent company with a lawsuit just two days after the album's release, calling the promotion an, "unmitigated disaster which defrauded customers."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3iac81cb9ace3320f872e011ed508fb2e8 |title=Guns N' Roses' Lawyer Blasts Dr Pepper |publisher=Billboard.biz |date= |accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> In a letter to Dr Pepper, Rose's lawyer Alan Gutman said "The redemption scheme your company clumsily implemented for this offer was an unmitigated disaster which defrauded consumers and, in the eyes of vocal fans, ruined ''Chinese Democracy'''s release." Rose's lawyer also demanded that the company make a full-page apology that would appear in [[The Wall Street Journal]], [[USA Today]], [[The New York Times]] and [[The Los Angeles Times]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7751919.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; Entertainment &#124; Rose angry over drinks giveaway |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/axl-rose-files-lawsuit-against-dr-pepper-asks-for-apology-payment_article_12375 |title=Axl Rose Files Lawsuit Against Dr. Pepper; Asks For Apology, Payment &#124; Access Hollywood - Celebrity News, Photos & Videos |publisher=Accesshollywood.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref>

===Censorship in the People's Republic of China===
The album is banned in the [[People's Republic of China]], reportedly due to supposed criticism in its [[Chinese Democracy (song)|title track]] about the [[Government of the People's Republic of China]] and a reference to the [[Falun Gong]].<ref> {{cite news

Record executives at Geffen have been upset with Rose for not doing any promotion or publicity work for ''Chinese Democracy'', feeling that the album would have sold better had Rose promoted it.<ref name="The Sun"/> It was reported that he had been missing for at least two months, and had not returned any phone calls or other requests.<ref>[http://entertainment.aol.ca/article/axl-rose-missing-for-two-months/440928/ Axl Rose Missing for Two Months]</ref> Rose broke his silence on the Guns N' Roses message boards on December 11th, addressing topics concerning the status of his relationships with former members of the band and stated that a video for the song "[[Better (Guns N' Roses song)|Better]]" would be released shortly.<ref>Cohen, Jonathan.
