'''Interstate 355''' (abbreviated '''I-355'''), also known as the '''Veterans Memorial Tollway''', is an [[interstate highway]] and [[toll road|tollway]] in the western and southwest suburbs of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]]. Like other tollways in northeastern [[Illinois]], it is run by the [[Illinois State Toll Highway Authority]] (ISTHA). I-355 runs from [[Interstate 80]] in [[New Lenox, Illinois|New Lenox]] north to [[Interstate 290 (Illinois)|Interstate 290]] in [[Itasca, Illinois|Itasca]],<ref name="t2" /> a distance of {{convert|32.5|mi|km|1}}.<ref name="length_note" /> The highway is six lanes wide for its entire length.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=I-355&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=28.611123,59.765625&ie=UTF8&ll=41.900999,-88.041&spn=0.20954,0.692139&t=h&z=11&om=1|title=General satellite view of the 3-laned I-355 (hybrid view to indicate where the highway is)|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref>

I-355 was opened in 1989 as the '''North-South Tollway''' to ease congestion on [[Illinois Route 53]], a north-south two-lane state highway in central [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]]. The highway, initially running from I-55 to I-290, cut travel times along the [[Schaumburg, Illinois|Schaumburg]]-[[Wheaton, Illinois|Wheaton]]-[[Bolingbrook, Illinois|Bolingbrook]] corridor. The opening of the tollway also opened the western suburbs of Chicago to commercial and industrial development.<ref name="hausner_1989" />

On [[November 11]],&nbsp;[[2007]], a southern extension to I-355 opened from I-55 to I-80, a distance of {{convert|12.5|mi|km|1}}; on opening the southern extension, the highway was renamed to the Veterans Memorial Tollway. The extension was built through [[Will County, Illinois|Will County]] and a small portion of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], one of the fastest-growing regions in Illinois. ISTHA expects the extension to cut travel times in the region by 20 percent.<ref name="tollway_I355_south_extension" />

== History ==
=== Early history ===
From 1923 through 1963, the north-south transportation corridor including eastern portions of [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] was serviced via Rohlwing Road (also known as SBI Route 53,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/LandingPage.aspx?type=nlp&img=16617569|title=The Daily Herald - Thursday, April 25, 1963|publisher=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|The Daily Herald]]|work=Newspaper Archive|accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> and later Illinois 53), a major north-south two-lane arterial that still exists in the county today.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/LandingPage.aspx?type=nlp&img=16645488|title=The Daily Herald - Friday, June 21, 1929|publisher=The Daily Herald|work=Newspaper Archive|accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> From 1963 to 1970, a new expressway was built north from [[Army Trail Road]] through Schaumburg to the Northwest Tollway (now the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway). When it was completed, Illinois 53 was moved onto this new expressway from Rohlwing Road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/LandingPage.aspx?type=nlp&img=16616628|title=The Daily Herald - Thursday, March 14, 1963|publisher=The Daily Herald|work=Newspaper Archive|accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref><ref name="rand_mcnally_1967">{{cite web|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midwest/Illinois/Chicago/gousha_ra_1967_041.html|title=1967 Chicago Vicinity Map|work=Boermapsonline|publisher=[[Rand McNally|Rand McNally & Company]]|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/LandingPage.aspx?type=nlp&img=16575449|title=The Daily Herald - Friday, January 16, 1970|publisher=The Daily Herald|work=Newspaper Archive|accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref>

The original alignment of I-355 was defined in the Chicago Area Transportation Study (abbreviated CATS) Transportation Plan of April&nbsp;1962. The plan called for a supplemental system of limited-access expressways to be built in the Chicago metropolitan area by 1980, and defined corridors where the expressways were to be located. Of these corridors, the vast majority, including the [[Des Plaines River]] expressway, the [[Crosstown Expressway (Chicago)|Crosstown Expressway]] running north-south along the west side of Chicago, and most of a proposed northern extension of Illinois 53 ran into intense local opposition and were never built.<ref name="cats_history">{{cite web |url=http://www.catsmpo.com/pub/reports/history/cats_1954-62.pdf |title=The Chicago Area Transportation Study: Creating the First Plan (1955-1962) |date=2007 |accessdate=2007-12-27 |author=Plummer, Andy}}</ref>

Initially, the state's plans for the limited access expressway south of Army Trail Road were for a freeway, similar to the existing freeway north of Army Trail Road. In 1979, Chicago mayor [[Jane Byrne]] canceled proposed plans for the Crosstown Expressway. DuPage County acquired the rights to half of the [[USD|US]]$200&nbsp;million (1979, [[USD|US]]$568&nbsp;million in 2007) that had been [[earmark]]ed for the expressway. The $100&nbsp;million (1979, $284&nbsp;million in 2007) remaining was then earmarked for the new freeway to replace Illinois&nbsp;53. However, this amount was found to be insufficient for construction. The project was then converted into a tollway, and the money spent on other projects in the county.<ref name="tribune_19850306">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FF631DCAC71B6FD&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Buzzard highway |date=1985-03-06 |author=Chicago Tribune Editorial Board |publisher=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>

Construction of the new highway was not without its share of legal problems. In June&nbsp;1984, Republican minority leader of the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] [[James Philip|James "Pate" Philip]] helped push through legislation authorizing the construction the tollway, then referred to as simply the '''DuPage Tollway'''.<ref name="tribune_19850129">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FF63074C2D99424&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title="Sox, DuPage batting stadium idea around" |author=Chicago Tribune |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=1985-01-29}}</ref> Officials at the [[Morton Arboretum]], one of the nation's premier woodland research centers, promptly filed a federal lawsuit to block construction of the tollway.

The conflict was resolved in late April of 1985, when the two agencies came to an agreement regarding construction of the new tollway. To protect the arboretum from salt spray and other pollutants caused by cars on the tollway, ISTHA agreed to build I-355 below grade around the perimeter of the arboretum. A water collection system would be built by the tollway to divert runoff from the arboretum. In addition, earthen berms would be built along the tollway to prevent salt spray from damaging arboretum plants, which had already been affected by salt spray from the then East-West Tollway, which itself was {{convert|0.25|mi|m|0}} away. In exchange, the DuPage County Forest Preserve District agreed to a 99&ndash;year lease providing 189&nbsp;acres&nbsp;(79.5&nbsp;hectares) of its land to the arboretum for the development of an "urban vegetation laboratory". Under the agreement, Morton Arboretum would charge DuPage County residents a lower prices for admission one day of the week, built a bicycle path connecting the arboretum to nearby forest preserves, and begin a joint clean-streams program to improve the water quality of DuPage County's lakes and streams.<ref name="schmeltzer_1985" /> In January 1986, the tollway paid out $2.5&nbsp;million (1986, $4.7&nbsp;million in 2007) to a trust fund as a part of the settlement to help finance the arboretum's new programs.<ref name="schmetlzer_19860129">{{cite news |title=Tollway gives $2.5 million to arboretum |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FF66DF9A24634AB&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Schmeltzer, John |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=1986-01-29}}</ref>

The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] released a preliminary [[environmental impact statement]] on [[March 13]], [[1986]]. At a public hearing a month later, the report was strongly criticized by arboretum executives and [[Woodridge, Illinois|Woodridge]] officials as "fatally flawed" and a repeat of tollway-provided research, including typographical errors. Opposition to the tollway also cited outdated and inaccurated data regarding wetlands replacement, salt dispersion, and the lack of compensation to residents for lowered property values.<ref name="schmeltzer_19860410">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FF67134D778B245&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Toll road impact report blasted |author=Schmeltzer, John |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=1986-04-10}}</ref> Concerns were somewhat alleviated when the tollway agreed to run the road below-grade at 75th&nbsp;Street instead of as a {{convert|28|ft|m}} high elevated highway.

The Corps of Engineers issued a permit for the tollway on [[October 8]],&nbsp;[[1986]], rejecting last-minute concerns by the [[Sierra Club]] to reroute the toll road around sections of Churchill prairie, between [[Glen Ellyn, Illinois|Glen Ellyn]] and [[Lombard, Illinois|Lombard]]. The permit allowed the first two earth moving contracts issued by the tollway authority to move foward.<ref name="schmeltzer_19861009">{{cite news |author=Schmeltzer, John |title=Bulldozers rev up for a tollway |date=1986-10-09 |publisher=Chicago Tribune |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FF679AB9F4933BE&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2}}</ref> The total cost of building the first {{convert|17.7|mi|km|1}} of new pavement was $450&nbsp;million (1987, $817&nbsp;million in 2007).

By April&nbsp;1988, the expressway was into its second year of construction. Because the tollway was experiencing problems with pavement on other roads in the system and anticipating heavy traffic on the new Interstate, the Tollway Authority decided to pave I-355 with pavement expected to last 20&nbsp;years. The concrete on the tollway was {{convert|12|in|cm|0}} thick and an {{convert|8|in|cm|0}} sub-base. The new pavement also incorporated [[fly ash]] and less cement, allowing the pavement to achieve maximum strength faster than pure concrete.<ref name="mehler_19880426">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FF7DE3D48534006&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Tollway tries to get rock-solid pavement |date=1988-04-26 |author=Mehler, Neil H. |publisher=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>

Governor [[James R. Thompson]] and U.S. [[Secretary of Transportation]] [[Samuel K. Skinner]] dedicated the tollway on [[December 22]],&nbsp;[[1989]]. At the time it was opened, officials estimated travel times from Schaumburg to Oak Brook would be reduced from 55&nbsp;minutes to 34&nbsp;minutes, and from Wheaton to [[Darien, Illinois|Darien]] from 60 to 34&nbsp;minutes. Tollway officials also estimated that 200,000&nbsp;cars per day would use I-355.<ref name="hausner_1989">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB36E9125B5C3D7&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Hausner, Les |publisher=Chicago Sun Times |date=1989-12-22 |title=Opening of I-355 will put some zip in Du Page traffic}}</ref> This figure has since been shown to be slightly optimistic, with maximum average daily traffic values approaching 170,200 only at the northern end of the Interstate.

=== Opening ===
I-355 opened at the stroke of midnight on [[December 24]],&nbsp;[[1989]]. As a Christmas "gift," the first two days of operation were free.<ref name="hausner_1989" /> Due to lower traffic counts at the north and south ends of the highway and lack of construction money, the road was built with four lanes from [[Illinois Route 64]] (North Avenue) to [[Interstate 88 (west)|Interstate 88]] ([[Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway]]) on the north end, and around I-55 on the south end. As early as 1991, tollway officials had drawn up plans to widen the highway to three lanes in each direction.<ref name="szymczak">{{cite news |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=1991-12-25 |author=Szymczak, P.

After the tollway opened, congestion decreased considerably on nearby north-south arteries. The DuPage County Division of Transportation calculated that congestion had decreased on Illinois&nbsp;53 by 20%, and the volume of cars on nearby north-south roads Illinois&nbsp;53, [[Illinois Route 59|Illinois&nbsp;59]] and [[Illinois Route 83|Illinois&nbsp;83]] had decreased. On Illinois&nbsp;53 between Ogden Avenue and Roosevelt Road, traffic counts sank from 21,400 to 11,800&nbsp;vehicles per day. In addition, traffic on the exit ramp from [[Interstate 294]] ([[Tri-State Tollway]]) to I-55 dropped 10% in 12&nbsp;months.

A construction project in the summer months of 1990 widened I-290 just north of the tollway, at a cost of $2&nbsp;million to $2.5&nbsp;million (1990, $3&nbsp; to $&nbsp;million in 2007).<ref name="kamin_1990" />

In spite of the apparent success of the tollway opening, traffic counts and projected toll revenues were initially lower than projected, with an estimated 65,000&nbsp;motorists per day traveling along the tollway, generating $55,000 to $65,000 (1990, $87,000 to $103,000 in 2007) in daily toll revenues. In addition, a spate of lawsuits were filed regarding the payment of contractors and subcontractors.

As one of the newer tollways in the system, the Veterans Memorial Tollway has also seen considerable toll-collection related improvements earlier than the other tollways. [[I-PASS]], the tollway system's electronic payment method, was tested on the entire stretch of I-355 in 1993 at various tollbooths; by September&nbsp;1994, every plaza on I-355 accepted I-PASS.<ref name=gillis_1993>{{cite news |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |date=1993-11-18 |author=Gillis, Michael |title=On I-355, change is no longer a constant - new device collects tolls automatically |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB42164F69DDC5B&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2}}</ref> By 1998, the toll barriers were remodeled to have dedicated [[I-PASS]] lanes (lanes specifically set aside for electronic toll collections) installed.<ref name=presecky_1997>{{cite news |publisher=Chicago Tribune |author=Presecky, William |date=1997-08-13 |title=Tollbooth to nowhere put to the test: vacant Lemont tract a proving ground for new I-PASS technology |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB4289D13E9D4DF&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2}}</ref> In 1999, it became the first tollway to receive I-PASS Express Lanes (also known as [[open road tolling]], or ORT).

Unlike all the other tollways in the tollway system, no [[Illinois Tollway Oasis|oases]] were constructed on the Veterans Memorial Tollway. This is primarily due to the widespread access to food and fuel throughout the western suburbs when construction began in the late&nbsp;1980s.<ref name=kemp_jan>{{cite web |url=http://www.beepcentral.com/discussions/thread.aspx?bctid=410&bcgid=13 |author=Kemp, Jan |title=Why isn't there an oasis on the North-South tollway? |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2007-11-15}} Via an interview/response through the Daily Herald.</ref> When the southern extension was opened in Will County in 2007, that segment of road also did not have any oases.

In addition to the original alignment of I-355, the Transportation Plan of April&nbsp;1962 included the concept of a route that ran from Bolingbrook south to Joliet. After the northern portion of I-355 opened in 1989, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] authorized the tollway authority to begin studying the southern extension of I-355.<ref name=herald_timeline>{{cite news |title=Tollway timeline |date=2007-11-11 |author=The Herald News |publisher=The Herald News (Joliet, IL) |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:JHNB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=11D34AA8AA1B9250&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2}}</ref>

The discovery of the [[Hine's Emerald Dragonfly]], an endangered species, and related concerns for the environmental health of the Des Plaines River wetlands in 1995, ignited a series of legal challenges that delayed construction of the I-355 extension for several years. The [[Sierra Club]] filed a lawsuit in 1996 to block planning of the southern extension. In January&nbsp;1997, a federal judge sided with the Sierra Club, halting construction of the southern extension while the state appealed. In 1999, the state dropped its appeal and amended the [[environmental impact study]] (EIS) to meet the Sierra Club's concerns.<ref name=herald_timeline /> The supplemental EIS was released in 2000, and in 2002 the FHWA issued a Record of Decision, allowing construction of the tollway to proceed after six years of delays. Land acquisition and utility relocation took place in 2004. Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]]'s $5.6&nbsp;billion Congestion-Relief Program for the Illinois Tollway was passed in September&nbsp;2004, with $729.3&nbsp;million being set aside for the extension.<ref name=congestion-relief>{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoistollway.com/pls/portal/url/ITEM/125BFC01743142A898A446A31484DAE1 |title=Congestion-Relief Program SUMMARY |publisher=Illinois State Toll Highway Authority |author=Illinois State Toll Highway Authority |date=2007 |accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref> Bidding on an excavation contract passed on [[November 18]],&nbsp;[[2004]] with construction beginning several days later.<ref name=tribune_may07>{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1191C375AFE907A8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |publisher=Chicago Tribune |work=NewsBank Inc|title=Bridge to southwest around the corner |author=Ziemba, Stanley |date=2007-05-13 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1191C375AFE907A8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2}}</ref> 

To document and reduce the impact of construction on the dragonfly's habitat, construction crews agreed to keep carcasses of any dragonfly kills.

Another controversy erupted in February&nbsp;2006, when the Tollway Authority threatened to build the tollway with no interchanges unless the suburbs through which the new extension ran contributed $20&nbsp;million for construction of the interchanges.

One of "the most impressive engineering feats on the state's 274 miles of toll roads"<ref name="tribune_may07" /> is the [[Des Plaines River Valley Bridge]], a bridge over the [[Des Plaines River]], the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]], the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]], Bluff Road, New Avenue, numerous railroads, and a major Commonwealth Edison utility corridor. The bridge is {{convert|1.3|mi|km|1}} long, and constituted $125&nbsp;million of the cost. Work on the bridge included the construction of 34&nbsp;piers and elevation of existing high-voltage electricity lines to accommodate the highway.<ref name="tollway_I355_south_extension"/> To limit the number of piers in the valley, the bridge was built with both {{convert|170|ft|m|0}} pre-stressed bulb tee girders and {{convert|270|ft|m|0}} post-tensioned segmental concrete girders. This was $12&nbsp;million less expensive than the concrete box girder design option, and $50&nbsp;million less expensive than the steel plate girder design option. A [[design-build]] clause in the original contract for the bridge, in addition to success in the design-build contracts on the [[Tri-State Tollway]] widening and reconstruction, allowed project managers to redesign and build the new bridge.<ref name="concrete_products">{{cite web |url=http://concreteproducts.com/mag/concrete_prairie_passage/ |title=Prairie Passage |publisher=Concrete Products |author=Marsh, Don |date=2007-10-01 |accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref>

== Route description ==
The southern terminus of I-355 is northeast of [[New Lenox, Illinois|New Lenox]], where the highway intersects I-80. I-355 is routed north and slightly west through rural, hilly portions of Will County. Just after the [[U.S. Route 6]] interchange (mile 1.0), tollway drivers pay a toll at Spring Creek Toll Plaza, the only toll plaza on the southern extension of I-355. It continues north through the rural sections of Will County, having exits that serve the towns of [[Homer Glen, Illinois|Homer Glen]] and [[Lockport, Illinois|Lockport]]. At 135th Street in [[Lemont, Illinois|Lemont]], Interstate 355 briefly enters [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]]. After an interchange at 127th Street (mile 9.0), I-355 crosses over the Des Plaines River on the [[Des Plaines River Valley Bridge]] before returning to Will County. Shortly north of the bridge, I-355 intersects I-55 at [[Bolingbrook, Illinois|Bolingbrook]]. Multiple [[flyover ramp]]s connect all directions of both highways.<ref name="current_tollway_map" />
[[Image:I-355 at the Illinois Prairie Path.jpg|thumb|I-355 at the [[Illinois Prairie Path]], looking south towards [[Downers Grove, Illinois|Downers Grove]] in the distance]]
North of I-55, I-355 continues to run almost due north through the established western suburbs of Chicago in [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]]. Travelers pay another toll just north of Boughton Road, at the Boughton Road Toll Plaza. Continuing north, I-355 has another multiple flyover interchange with [[Interstate 88 (west)|I-88]], commonly called the [[Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway]]. On the southern end of the interchange, northbound I-355 has exits to both directions of I-88. I-355 then swings below I-88 and runs side-by-side with the other tollway for {{convert|1|mi|km|0}}. Southbound exits to both directions of I-88 are at the northern end of the interchange. At the Army Trail Road Toll Plaza, through traffic pays the last toll of the tollway. I-355 has no tolls north of the Army Trail Road exit (mile 30) in [[Addison, Illinois|Addison]]. There is one untolled exit (mile 31.5) at [[U.S. Route 20]] (Lake Street) north of the tollway. I-355 terminates at the I-290 interchange near the border of the villages of [[Itasca, Illinois|Itasca]] and [[Addison, Illinois|Addison]].<ref name="current_tollway_map" />

The northernmost two toll plazas (Boughton Road and Army Trail Road) charge $1.00 cash and $0.50 for cars with I-PASS and [[E-ZPass]].
