{{Crusade}}
{{Campaignbox First Crusade}}
{{Campaignbox Seljuk-Crusader War}}

The '''First Crusade''' was launched in 1095 by [[Pope Urban II]] with the dual goals of reconquering the sacred city of [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]] and freeing the [[Eastern Christians]] from [[Islam]]ic rule. What started as an appeal by [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Alexius I Comnenus]] for western mercenaries to fight the [[Seljuk Turks]] in [[Anatolia]]  quickly turned into a wholescale Western [[Mass migrations|migration]] and conquest of territory outside of [[Europe]]. Both [[knight]]s and peasants from many nations of [[Western Europe]] travelled over land and by sea towards [[Jerusalem]] and captured the city in July 1099, establishing the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and other [[Crusader states]]. Although these gains lasted for less than two hundred years, the First Crusade was part of the Christian response to the [[Islamic conquests]], as well as the first major step towards reopening international trade in the West since the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. 

==Background==

===Background===

The origins of the [[crusades]] in general, and of the First Crusade in particular, are varied and are widely debated among historians. They are most commonly linked to the political and social history of eleventh-century Europe, the rise of a reform movement within the Papacy, and the political and religious situation of Christianity and Islam in Europe and the Middle East.

Christianity, which had spread throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East in the early Middle Ages, was by the early eighth century limited to Europe and Asia Minor after the rapid spread of Islam. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] had [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] from the predominantly Christian [[Byzantine Empire]], and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Spain]] from the Christian [[Visigothic Spain|Visigothic Kingdom]].<ref>[[Christopher Tyerman]], ''God's War: A New History of the Crusades'' (Penguin Books, 2006), pp. 51&ndash;54</ref> In North Africa, the Ummayad empire eventually collapsed and a number of smaller Muslim kingdoms emerged, such as the [[Aghlabid|Aghlabids]], who entered [[Italy]] in the 9th century, and the [[Kalbid]]s, who became prey to the [[Normans]] capturing [[Sicily]] by 1091.  [[Pisa]], [[Genoa]], and [[Aragon]] began to battle other Muslim kingdoms for control of the [[Mediterranean]], exemplified by the [[Mahdia campaign]] and battles at [[Majorca]] and [[Sardinia]].<ref>See H.E.J. Cowdrey, "The Mahdia campaign of 1087" ([[The English Historical Review]] 92 (1977), pp. 1-29.</ref>

At the western edge of Europe, and of Islamic expansion, the [[Reconquista]] in Spain was well underway by the eleventh century; it was intermittently ideological, as evidenced by the ''[[Epitome Ovetense]]'' written at the behest of [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] in 881, but it was not a proto-crusade.<ref>R. A. Fletcher (1987) "Reconquest and Crusade in Spain c. 1050&ndash;1150," ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Fifth Series'', '''37''', 34, quotes the pertinent passage: They [the Saracens] take the kingdom of the Goths, which until today they stubbornly possess in part; and against them the Christians do battle day and night, and constantly strive; until the divine fore-shadowing orders them to be cruelly expelled from here. Amen.</ref> Increasingly in the eleventh century foreign knights, mostly from France, visited Spain to assist the Christians in their efforts.<ref>The [[Normans|Norman]] [[Roger I of Tosny]] went in 1018. Lynn H. Nelson (1978), "The Foundation of Jaca (1076): Urban Growth in Early Aragon," ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', '''53'''(4), 697n27, lists some foreign ventures into Aragon: the [[War of Barbastro]] in 1063, [[Moctadir]] of [[Zaragoza]] feared an expedition with foreign assistance in 1069, [[Ebles II of Roucy]] planned one in 1073, [[William VIII of Aquitaine]] was sent back from Aragon in 1080, a French army came to the assistance of [[Sancho Ramírez]] in 1087 after [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] was defeated at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]], [[Centule I of Bigorre]] was in the valley of [[Tena]] in 1088, and there was a major French component to the "crusade" launched against Zaragoza by [[Peter I of Aragon and Navarre]] in 1101.</ref> Shortly before the First Crusade, [[Pope Urban II]] had encouraged Spanish Christians to reconquer [[Tarragona]], near Barcelona, using much of the same symbolism and rhetoric that was later used to preach the crusade.<ref>[[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], ''The Crusades: A History'', 2nd ed. (Yale University Press, 2005), pg. 7.</ref>

In the east was the [[Byzantine Empire]], fellow Christians who had long followed a separate [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] rite. Since 1054 the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches had been [[East-West Schism|in schism]], and the imposition of Roman church authority in the east may have been one of the causes of the crusade.<ref>[[Thomas Asbridge]], ''[[The First Crusade: A New History]]'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2004), pg. 17.</ref> Under Emperor [[Alexius I Comnenus]], the empire was largely confined to Europe and the western coast of [[Anatolia]], and faced many enemies: the [[Normans]] in the west and the [[Seljuk Turks]] in the east. The Seljuks invaded Byzantium in 1071, and in response, in 1074, [[Pope Gregory VII]] called for the ''milites Christi'' ("soldiers of Christ") to go to their aid. This call, while largely ignored and even opposed, nevertheless focused a great deal of attention on the east.<ref>Asbridge, pp. 15-20.</ref>

[[Image:Age of Caliphs.png|350px|thumb|left|Umayyad Caliphate at its greatest extent.]]
The Seljuks and Byzantines continually fought for control of Anatolia and Syria. The Seljuks, who were orthodox [[Sunni]] Muslims, formerly ruled a large empire ("[[Great Seljuk]]") but by the time of the First Crusade it had divided into many smaller states after the death of [[Malik Shah I]] in 1092. Malik Shah was succeeded in the Anatolian [[Sultanate of Rüm]] by [[Kilij Arslan I]], and in Syria by his brother [[Tutush I]], who died in 1095. Tutush's sons [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan|Radwan]] and [[Duqaq]] inherited [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] respectively, further dividing Syria amongst emirs antagonistic towards each other, as well as [[Kerbogha]], the [[atabeg]] of [[Mosul]].<ref>Peter M. Holt, ''The Age of the Crusades: The Near East from the Eleventh Century to 1517'' (Longman, 1986), pp. 11, 14-15.</ref>

Egypt and much of Palestine were controlled by the [[Arab]] [[Shi'ite]] [[Fatimids]], whose empire was significantly smaller since the arrival of the Seljuks. Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuks caused great disruption for the local Christians and for western pilgrims. The Fatimids, at this time ruled by [[caliph]] [[al-Musta'li]], with the [[vizier]] [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]] holding actual power, had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuks in 1076, but recaptured it from the [[Ortoqids]], a smaller Turkic tribe associated with the Seljuks, in 1098, just before the arrival of the crusaders. <ref>Holt, pp. 11-14.</ref> 

The heart of western Europe itself had been relatively stabilized after the [[Christianization]] of the [[Saxons]], [[Vikings]], and [[Magyars]] by the end of the tenth century. However, the breakdown of the [[Carolingian Empire]] gave rise to an entire class of warriors who now had little to do but fight among themselves.<ref>Asbridge, pp. 3-4.</ref> The random violence of the knightly class, and often knighthood itself, were regularly condemned by the church, and the [[Peace and Truce of God|Peace of God]] was established to prohibit fighting on certain days of the year. At the same time, the reform-minded Papacy came into conflict with the secular world, resulting in the [[Investiture Controversy]], and popes such as Gregory VII needed theological justification for the subsequent warfare. It became acceptable for the Pope to utilize knights in the name of Christendom, not only against political enemies of the Papacy, but also against Muslim Spain, or, theoretically, against the Seljuks in the east.<ref>[[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], ''The First Crusade and the Idea of Crusading'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986), pp. 5-8.</ref> 

===Historiography===
All these events are claimed by historians to have contributed to the origin of the crusades. According to the "Erdmann thesis", developed by German historian [[Carl Erdmann]], the origin was directly linked to the eleventh-century reform movements. Exportation of violence to the east, and assistance to the struggling Byzantine Empire were the primary goals, with Jerusalem a secondary, popular goal.<ref>Riley-Smith, ''The First Crusade and the Idea of Crusading'', pg. 1. Erdmann's ''Die Entstehung des Kreuzzugsgedankens'' was published in 1935 and was translated into English as ''The Origin of the Idea of Crusade'' by [[Marshall W. Baldwin]] and [[Walter Goffart]] in 1977.</ref> 

Generally, historians have either followed Erdmann, with further expansions upon his thesis; more recently, they have also considered the influence of the rise of Islam. According to [[Steven Runciman]], there was no immediate threat from Islam, for "in the middle of the eleventh century the lot of the Christians in Palestine had seldom been so pleasant."<ref>[[Steven Runciman]], ''A History of the Crusades'', vol. I, ''The First Crusade'' (Cambridge University Press, 1951; reprint Folio Society, 1994), pg. 31.</ref> The crusade was a combination of theological justification for holy war and a "general restlessness and taste for adventure", especially among the Normans and the "younger sons" of the French nobility who had no other opportunities.<ref>Runciman, pg. 76. Runciman is both vividly readable and widely read; it is safe to say that most popular conceptions of the crusades are based on his account, though the academic world has long moved past him.</ref> [[Thomas Asbridge]] argues that the crusade was simply Pope Urban II's attempt to expand the power of the church, and to reunite the churches of Rome and Constantinople, which had been [[East-West Schism|in schism]] since 1054. The spread of Islam was unimportant, because "Islam and Christendom had coexisted for centuries in relative equanimity."<ref>Asbridge, pg. 17; for Urban's personal motives, see pp. 19-21.</ref> [[Thomas Madden]] represents the opposite view; while the crusade was certainly linked to church reform and attempts to assert papal authority, it was most importantly a pious struggle, waged by faithful idealists, to liberate fellow Christians who "had suffered mightily at the hands of the Turks." This argument distinguishes the relatively recent violence and warfare that followed the arrival of the Turks from the general advance of Islam which is dismissed by Runciman and Asbridge.<ref>[[Thomas Madden]], ''The New Concise History of the Crusades'' (Rowman and Littlefield, 2005), pg. 7. </ref> [[Christopher Tyerman]] incorporates both arguments; the crusade developed out of church reform and theories of holy war as much as it was a response to conflicts with Islam throughout Europe and the Middle East.<ref>Tyerman, pp. 56-57.</ref> For [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], poor harvests, overpopulation, and a pre-existing movement towards colonising the frontier areas of Europe also contributed to the crusade; he also notes, however, that "most commentators then and a minority of historians now have maintained that the chief motivation was a genuine idealism." <ref>Riley-Smith, ''The Crusades: A History'', pg. 17.</ref>

The idea that the crusades were a response to Islam dates back as far as twelfth-century historian [[William of Tyre]], who began his chronicle with the fall of Jerusalem to [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]].<ref>[[William of Tyre]], ''A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea'', trans. E.A. Babcock and A.C. Krey (Columbia University Press, 1943), pg. 60.</ref> Although the original Islamic conquests took place centuries before the First Crusade, there were more recent events that European Christians still remembered. In 1009 the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] was destroyed by the Fatimid Caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]]; [[Pope Sergius IV]] supposedly called for a military expedition in response, and in France, many Jewish communities were even attacked in misplaced retaliation. Nevertheless, the Church was rebuilt after al-Hakim's death, and pilgrimages resumed, including the [[Great German Pilgrimage of 1064&ndash;1065]], although those pilgrims also suffered attacks from local Muslims.<ref>Riley-Smith, ''The Crusades: A History'', pp. 10-12. William of Tyre also mentions the destruction of the Holy Sepulchre as a cause of the First Crusade, pp. 65-66.</ref> 

==Chronological sequence of the Crusade==
===Council of Clermont===
{{Main|Council of Clermont}}

Whatever the ultimate causes of the crusade, the most immediate factor was a request for assistance from Byzantine emperor [[Alexius I Comnenus]]. Alexius was worried about the advances of the Turks, who had reached as far west as [[Nicaea]], not far from [[Constantinople]]. In March of 1095, Alexius I sent envoys to the [[Council of Piacenza]] to ask Pope Urban II for aid against the Turks.  Urban responded favourably, perhaps hoping to heal the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] of 40 years prior and re-unite the Church under [[papal primacy]] as "chief bishop and prelate over the whole world" (as he referred to himself at Clermont),<ref>Fulcher of Chartres, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/urban2-5vers.html#Fulcher "Speech of Urban"], ''Gesta Francorum Jerusalem Expugnantium''.</ref> by helping the Eastern churches in their time of need.<ref>Asbridge, pg. 15.</ref>

In July of 1095, Urban turned to his homeland of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the [[Council of Clermont]] in November, where, according to the various speeches attributed to him, he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy, graphically detailing the fantastic atrocities being committed against pilgrims and eastern Christians. He summoned the audience to wrest control of Jerusalem from the hands of the Muslims. France, he said, was overcrowded and the land of [[Canaan]] was overflowing with milk and honey. He spoke of the problems of noble violence and the solution was to turn swords to God's own service: "Let robbers become knights."<ref>Fulcher of Chartres, ibid.</ref> He spoke a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards both on earth and in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking.<ref>Asbridge, pp. 31-39.</ref> The crowd was stirred to frenzied enthusiasm and interrupted his speech with cries of ''[[Deus lo volt]]!'' ("God wills it!").<ref>Tyerman, pg. 65.</ref>

There are at least five versions of the speech on record, but all were written after Jerusalem had been captured, and it is difficult to know what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.<ref>Asbridge, pg. 32. The accounts can be read online at [[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/urban2-5vers.html The Internet Medieval Sourcebook].</ref> However, it is clear that the response to the speech was much larger than even the Pope, let alone Alexius, expected. For the rest of 1095 and into 1096, Urban spread the message throughout France, and urged his bishops and legates to preach in their own dioceses elsewhere in France, Germany, and Italy as well. Urban's speech had been well-planned; he had discussed the crusade with [[Adhemar of Le Puy|Adhemar, Bishop of Le Puy]], and [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]], and instantly the expedition had the support of two of southern France's most important leaders. Adhemar himself was present at the Council and was the first to "take the cross." During his tour of France, Urban tried to forbid certain people (including women, monks, and the sick) from joining the crusade, but found this nearly impossible. In the end most who took up the call were not knights, but peasants who were not wealthy and had little in the way of fighting skills, in an outpouring of a new emotional and personal piety that was not easily harnessed by the ecclesiastical and lay aristocracy.<ref>Asbridge, pp. 46-49.</ref>

===People's Crusade===
{{Main|People's Crusade}}
[[Image:PeoplesCrusadeMassacre.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The defeat of the People's Crusade]]

Urban planned the departure of the crusade for 15 August 1096, the [[Feast of the Assumption]], but months before this a number of unexpected armies of peasants and petty nobles set off for Jerusalem on their own. They were led by a charismatic priest named [[Peter the Hermit]] of [[Amiens]]. The response was beyond expectations: while Urban might have expected a few thousand knights, he ended up with a migration numbering up to 40,000 Crusaders&mdash; albeit mostly unskilled fighters, including women and children.<ref name="AD-1096p33">Norwich, John Julius. ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall''. New York: Alfred Knopf, 1995, p. 33 ISBN 0-6794-1650-1.</ref> 

Lacking military discipline, and in what likely seemed to the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), they quickly landed in trouble, in Christian territory. The problem faced was one of supply as well as culture: the people needed food, and they expected host cities to give, or at least sell it to them at a reasonable price. Unfortunately for the Crusaders, the locals did not always agree, and this quickly led to fighting. Following the [[Danube River|Danube]], Peter's supporters looted the surrounding territory and were attacked by the Hungarians, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and even a Byzantine army near [[Nish]]. Ten-thousand, around a quarter  of Peter's followers, were killed,{{Fact|date=November 2008}} but the rest arrived largely intact at [[Constantinople]] in August. Cultural and religious differences and a reluctance to supply such a large number of incoming people led to further tensions. Moreover, Peter's followers soon joined with other crusaders from France and Italy. Alexius, not knowing what else to do with such a large assembly of people, quickly ferried all 30,000 crusaders across the [[Bosphorus]].<ref name="AD-1096p33"/>

After crossing into Asia Minor, the Crusaders began to quarrel and the armies broke up into two separate parties.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The experience of the Turks was overwhelming; most of the People's Crusade —exhibiting their supreme lack of any practical knowledge in battle — were massacred upon entering Seljuk territory.<ref name="AD-1096p35">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'', p. 35.</ref> Peter survived, however, and would later join the main Crusader army.<ref name=Lock247>Lock ''Companion to the Crusades'' p. 247</ref> Another army of [[Bohemia]]ns and [[Saxony|Saxons]] did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.

====Persecution of the Jews====
{{main|Persecution of Jews in the First Crusade}}
[[Image:FirstCrusade.jpg|thumb|200px|1250 French Bible illustration depicts Jews (identifiable by [[Judenhut]]) being massacred by Crusaders]]

The First Crusade ignited a long tradition of organized violence against [[Jew]]s in [[Culture of Europe|European culture]].{{Fact|date=November 2008}} While [[anti-Semitism]] had existed in Europe for centuries, the First Crusade marked the first mass organized violence against Jewish communities.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} In Germany, certain leaders understood this war against the infidels to be applicable not only to the Muslims in the Holy Land, but also against Jews within their own lands.<ref name=Tyerman100>Tyerman ''God's War'' pp. 100&ndash;106</ref> Setting off in the early summer of 1096, a German army of around 10,000 Crusaders led by Gottschalk, Volkmar, and [[Emicho]], proceeded northward through the [[Rhine river|Rhine]] valley, in the opposite direction of Jerusalem, and began a series of [[pogrom]]s which some historians call "the first [[Holocaust]]".<ref>Riley-Smith, Jonathan, ''The First Crusade and the Idea of Crusading'', 1986, p. 50.</ref> This understanding of the idea of a Crusade was not universal, however, and Jews found some refuge in sanctuaries, with one example being the Archbishop of Cologne's attempts to protect the Jews of the city from the slaughter carried on by the city's population.<ref name=Tyerman100/>

The preaching of the crusade inspired further anti-Semitism.<ref name=Lock398>Lock ''Companion to the Crusades'' p. 398</ref> According to some preachers, Jews and Muslims were enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The general public apparently assumed that "fought" meant "fought to the death", or "killed".{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The Christian conquest of Jerusalem and the establishment of a Christian emperor there would supposedly instigate the [[End Times]], during which the Jews were supposed to convert to Christianity.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} In parts of France and Germany, Jews were thought to be responsible for the [[crucifixion]], and they were more immediately visible than the far-away Muslims. Many people wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The crusaders moved north through the Rhine valley into well-known Jewish communities such as [[Cologne]], and then southward. Jewish communities were given the option of converting to Christianity or being slaughtered. Most would not convert and, as news of the mass killings spread, many Jewish communities committed mass suicides in horrific scenes.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Hundreds of Jews were massacred, despite attempts by local clergy and secular authorities in some places to shelter them.<ref name=Lock398/> The massacres were justified by the claim that Urban's speech at Clermont promised reward from God for killing non-Christians of any sort, not just Muslims.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Although the papacy abhorred and preached against the purging of Muslim and Jewish inhabitants during this and future crusades, there were numerous attacks on Jews following every crusade movement.

===Princes' Crusade===<!-- [[Princes' Crusade]] redirects here -->

[[Image:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Route of the leaders of the first crusade]]

The Princes' Crusade, also known as the Barons' Crusade, set out later in 1096 in a more orderly manner{{Fact|date=November 2008}}, led by various nobles with bands of knights from different regions of Europe. The four most significant of these were [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]], who represented the knights of [[Provence]], accompanied by the [[papal legate]] [[Adhemar of Le Puy]]; [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], representing the Normans of southern Italy with his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; The [[Lorraine (province)|Lorrainers]] under the brothers [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], [[Eustace III|Eustace]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]]; and the Northern French led by Count [[Robert II of Flanders]], [[Robert Curthose|Robert of Normandy]] (older brother of King [[William II of England]]), [[Stephen, Count of Blois]], and [[Hugh of Vermandois]] the younger brother of King [[Philip I of France]], who bore the papal banner.<ref name=Tyerman106>Tyerman ''God's War'' pp. 106&ndash;118</ref> King Philip himself was forbidden from participating in the campaign as he had been [[excommunication|excommunicated]].<ref name=Tyerman107>Tyerman ''God's War'' p. 107</ref> The entire crusader army consisted of about 30,000-35,000 crusaders, including 5,000 cavalry.<ref name="army">D.

====March to Jerusalem====
Leaving Europe around the appointed time in August, the various armies took different paths to Constantinople and gathered outside its city walls between November 1096 and May 1097.<ref name=Tyerman106/> Accompanying the knights were many poor men (''pauperes'') who could afford basic clothing and perhaps an old weapon. Peter the Hermit, who joined the Princes' Crusade at Constantinople, was considered responsible for their well-being, and they were able to organize themselves into small groups, perhaps akin to military companies, often led by an impoverished knight.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} One of the largest of these groups, comprising of the survivors of the People's Crusade, named itself the "[[Tafur]]s."<ref>Tyerman ''God's War'' p. 150</ref>

The Princes arrived in Constantinople with little food and expected provisions and help from Alexius I. Alexius was understandably suspicious after his experiences with the People's Crusade, and also because the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} At the same time, Alexius harbored hopes of exercising control over the crusaders, who he seems to have regarded as having the potential to function as a Byzantine [[proxy]].<ref name=Tyerman118>Tyerman ''God's War'' pp. 118&ndash;122</ref> The gates of the city where not open to them as friends for their army was large enough to take the city.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Only the leaders of the crusaders were allowed to come in. Thus, in return for food and supplies, Alexius requested the leaders to swear [[fealty]] to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Without food or provisions, they eventually had no choice but to take the oath, though not until all sides had agreed to various compromises, and only after warfare had almost broken out in the city.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Only Raymond avoided swearing the oath, cleverly pledging himself to Alexius if the emperor would lead the crusade in person. Alexius refused, but the two became allies, sharing a common distrust of Bohemond.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

[[Image:Byzantium1st-crusade.PNG|thumb|right|Byzantine Empire and Crusader States after the First Crusade]]

Alexius agreed to send out a Byzantine army under the command of [[Taticius]] to accompany the crusaders through Asia Minor. Their first objective was [[Iznik|Nicaea]], an old Byzantine city, but now the capital of the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rüm]] under [[Kilij Arslan I]]. Meanwhile, Arslan was campaigning against the [[Danishmends]] in central [[Anatolia]] having left behind his treasury and his family having underestimated the Crusaders.<ref name="Runciman121">Runciman, ''The First Crusade'', p. 121.</ref> The city was subjected to [[siege of Nicaea|a lengthy siege]], which was somewhat ineffectual as the crusaders could not blockade the lake on which the city was situated, and from which it could be provisioned. When Arslan heard of the siege, he rushed back to Nicaea and attacked the Crusader army on the 23 May but was driven back with heavy losses being suffered on both sides.<ref name="Runciman131"/> Seeing that he would not be able to save the city, he advised the garrison to surrender if their situation became untenable.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Alexius, fearing the crusaders would sack Nicaea and destroy its wealth, secretly accepted the surrender of the city; the crusaders awoke on the morning of 19 June 1097 to see Byzantine standards flying from the walls. The crusaders were forbidden to loot it, and were not allowed to enter the city except in small escorted bands.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} This caused a further tension between the Byzantines and the crusaders.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The crusaders now began the journey to Jerusalem and Stephen of Blois writing home to his wife [[Adela]], stated he believed it would take five weeks.<ref>Tyerman ''God's War'' p. 122</ref> In fact, the journey would take two years.<ref name="Runciman123">Runciman, ''The First Crusade'', p. 123.</ref>

The crusaders, still accompanied by some Byzantine troops under [[Taticius]], marched on towards [[Dorylaeum]], where Bohemond was pinned down by Kilij Arslan. At the [[Battle of Dorylaeum]] on 1 July, Godfrey broke through the Turkish lines, and with the help of the troops led by the legate Adhemar - who attacked the Turks from the rear - defeated the Turks and looted their camp.<ref name="Runciman131">Runciman, ''The First Crusade'', p. 131.</ref> Kilij Arslan withdrew and the crusaders marched almost unopposed through Asia Minor towards [[Antioch]], except for a battle, in September, in which they again defeated the Turks.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Along the way, the Crusaders were able to capture a number of cities such as [[Sozopolis, Pisidia|Sozopolis]], [[Iconium]] and [[Kayseri|Caesarea]] although most of these were lost to the Turks by 1101.<ref name="Runciman135">Runciman, ''The First Crusade'', p. 135.</ref><ref>Geoffrey Parker, ''Compact History of the World'', p. 48-9.</ref>

The march through Asia was unpleasant. It was the middle of summer and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men died, as did many horses.<ref name=Tyerman131>Tyerman ''God's War'' p. 131</ref> Christians, in Asia as in Europe, sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often the crusaders looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command; still, Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} After passing through the [[Cilician Gates]], Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the [[Armenia]]n lands around the [[Euphrates]]. In [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by King [[Thoros of Edessa|Thoros]], an [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian]] [[Greek Orthodox]] ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his religion. Thoros was soon [[assassin]]ated and Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the [[County of Edessa]], the first of the crusader states.<ref name="Runciman149">Runciman, ''The First Crusade'', p. 149.</ref>

====Siege of Antioch====
{{Main|Siege of Antioch}}
[[Image:Adhémar de Monteil à Antioche.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|A mitred [[Adhémar de Monteil]] carrying the [[Holy Lance]] in one of the battles of the First Crusade]]

The crusader army, meanwhile, marched on to [[Antioch]], which lay about half way between Constantinople and Jerusalem. On 20 October 1097 the crusader army set Antioch to a siege which lasted almost eight months,<ref>Asbridge. ''The First Crusade'', pp. 163-187.</ref> during which time they also had to defeat two large relief armies under [[Duqaq|Duqaq of Damascus]] and [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan|Ridwan of Aleppo]].{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Antioch was so large that the crusaders did not have enough troops to fully surround it, and thus it was able to stay partially supplied.<ref name=Tyerman135>Tyerman ''God's War'' p. 135</ref> 

In May 1098, [[Kerbogha]] of [[Mosul]] approached Antioch to relieve the siege. Bohemond bribed an Armenian guard named Firuz  to surrender his tower, and in June the crusaders entered the city and killed most of the inhabitants.<ref>Runciman. ''History of the Crusades'', p. 231.</ref> However, only a few days later the Muslims arrived, laying siege to the former besiegers.<ref name=Tyerman142>Tyerman ''God's War'' pp. 142&ndash;143</ref> At this point a minor monk by the name of [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed to have discovered the [[Holy Lance]] in the city, and although some were skeptical, this was seen as a sign that they would be victorious.<ref>Asbridge. ''The First Crusade'', pp. 163-187.</ref> 

[[Image:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] alone mounts the rampart of Antioch'', in an engraving by [[Gustave Doré]].]]

On 28 June 1098 the crusaders defeated Kerbogha in a pitched battle outside the city, as Kerbogha was unable to organize the different factions in his army.<ref name=Tyerman137>Tyerman ''God's War'' p. 137</ref> While the crusaders were marching towards the Muslims, the Fatimid section of the army deserted the Turkish contingent, as they feared Kerbogha would become too powerful if he were to defeat the Crusaders.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} According to legend, an army of Christian [[saint]]s came to the aid of the crusaders during the battle and crippled Kerbogha's army.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

Bohemond argued that Alexius had deserted the crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, but not everyone agreed, notably Raymond of Toulouse, and the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} It is a common [[historiography|historiographical]] assumption that the Franks of northern France, the Provençals of southern France, and the Normans of southern Italy considered themselves separate "nations" and that each wanted to increase its status.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} This may have had something to do with the disputes, but personal ambition was just as likely to blame.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Meanwhile, a plague broke out, killing many, including the legate Adhemar, who died on 1 August.<ref name=Lock23>Lock ''Companion to the Crusades'' p. 23</ref> There were now even fewer horses than before, and Muslim peasants refused to give them food.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} In December, the [[Arab]] town of [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]] was captured after [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan|a siege]], which saw the first occurrence of [[cannibalism]] among crusaders.<ref>Runciman. ''History of the Crusades'', p. 261.</ref> The minor knights and soldiers became restless and threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Finally, at the beginning of 1099, the march was renewed, leaving Bohemond behind as the first [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]].

====Siege of Jerusalem====
{{Main|Siege of Jerusalem (1099)}}
{{See also|Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon}}
[[Image:Byzantium after the First crusade.PNG|thumb|Path of the First Crusade]]

Proceeding down the coast of the [[Mediterranean]], the crusaders encountered little resistance, as local rulers preferred to make peace with them and give them supplies rather than fight.<ref name=Tyerman150>Tyerman ''God's War'' p. 150</ref> On 7 June the crusaders reached Jerusalem, which had been recaptured from the Seljuks by the [[Fatimid]]s of Egypt only the year before.<ref name=Tyerman153>Tyerman ''God's War'' p. 153&ndash;157</ref>  Many Crusaders wept on seeing the city they had journeyed so long to reach.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

As with Antioch, the crusaders put the city to a siege, in which the crusaders themselves suffered many casualties, due to the lack of food and water around Jerusalem.<ref name=Tyerman153/> By the time the Crusader army reached Jerusalem, only 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained.<ref name="crusadearmy">A. Konstam, ''Historical Atlas of the Crusades'', 133.</ref> Faced with a seemingly impossible task, their morale was raised when a priest, by the name of [[Peter Desiderius]], claimed to have had a divine vision instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the [[Bible|Biblical]] example of [[Joshua]] at the siege of [[Jericho]].<ref name=Tyerman153>Tyerman ''God's War'' p. 156</ref> On 8 July 1099 the crusaders performed the procession as instructed by Desiderius. The Genoese troops, led by commander [[Guglielmo Embriaco]], had previously dismantled the ships in which the Genoese came to the [[Holy Land]]; Embriaco, using the ship's wood, made some [[siege engines|siege towers]] and seven days later on 15 July, the crusaders were able to end the siege by breaking down sections of the walls and entering the city. Some Crusaders also entered through the former pilgrim's entrance.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

Over the course of that afternoon, evening and next morning, the crusaders murdered almost every inhabitant of Jerusalem.<ref name=Tyerman157>Tyerman ''God's War'' pp. 157&ndash;158</ref> Muslims, Jews, and even eastern Christians were all massacred.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Although many Muslims sought shelter in [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and the Jews in their [[synagogue]] by the [[Western wall]], the crusaders spared few lives.<ref name=Tyerman157/> According to the anonymous ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'', "''...the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles...''" According to Raymond of Aguilers "''men rode in blood up to their knees and bridle reins.''" However, scholars John and Laurita Hill discovered in 1969 that this line was taken directly from biblical passage [[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Revelation#Chapter 14|Apocalypse 14:20]].<ref>Kedar, Benjamin Z. "The Jerusalem Massacre of July 1099 in the Western Historiography of the Crusades." in The Crusades ( Vol. 3). ed. Benjamin Z. Kedar and Jonathan S.C. Riley-Smith. Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2004 (ISBN 075464099X), p. 65</ref> The chronicle of [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]] states the Jewish defenders sought refuge in their synagogue, but the "Franks burned it over their heads", killing everyone inside.<ref name=gibb>[[Hamilton Gibb|Gibb, H. A. R.]] ''The Damascus Chronicle of the Crusades: Extracted and Translated from the Chronicle of Ibn Al-Qalanisi''. Dover Publications, 2003 (ISBN 0486425193)</ref> Tancred claimed the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple quarter]] for himself and offered protection to some of the Muslims there, but he was unable to prevent their deaths at the hands of his fellow crusaders.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} According to [[Fulcher of Chartres]]: "Indeed, if you had been there you would have seen our feet coloured to our ankles with the blood of the slain. But what more shall I relate? None of them were left alive; neither women nor children were spared".<ref name=fulcher_siege>Fulcher of Chartres, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/cde-jlem.html#fulcher1 "The Siege of the City of Jerusalem"], ''Gesta Francorum Jerusalem Expugnantium''.</ref>

The [[Gesta Francorum]] states some people managed to escape the siege unharmed. Its anonymous author wrote, "''When the pagans had been overcome, our men seized great numbers, both men and women, either killing them or keeping them captive, as they wished.''"<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/gesta-cde.html#jerusalem2 Medieval Sourcebook: Gesta Francorum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Later it is written, "[''Our leaders'']'' also ordered all the [[Saracen]] dead to be cast outside because of the great stench, since the whole city was filled with their corpses; and so the living Saracens dragged the dead before the exits of the gates and arranged them in heaps, as if they were houses. No one ever saw or heard of such slaughter of pagan people, for funeral pyres were formed from them like pyramids, and no one knows their number except God alone.''" <ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/gesta-cde.html#jerusalem3 Medieval Sourcebook: Gesta Francorum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On 22 July, a council was held in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Raymond of Toulouse at first refused to become king,<ref name=Tyerman159>Tyerman ''God's War'' pp. 159&ndash;160</ref> perhaps attempting to show his piety but probably hoping that the other nobles would insist upon his election anyway. Godfrey, who had become the more popular of the two after Raymond's actions at the siege of Antioch, did no damage to his own piety by accepting a position as secular leader. Raymond was incensed at this development and took his army out into the countryside. The exact nature and meaning of Godfrey's title is somewhat of a controversy. Although it is widely claimed that he took the title ''Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri'' ("advocate" or "defender" of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]]), this title is only used in a letter which was not written by Godfrey. Instead, Godfrey himself seems to have used the more ambiguous term ''princeps'', or simply retained his title of ''dux'' from back home in Lower Lorraine. According to [[William of Tyre]], writing in the later 12th century when Godfrey was already a legendary hero in crusader Jerusalem, he refused to wear "a crown of gold" where Christ had worn "a crown of thorns".<ref>William of Tyre, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/9.html#9 Book 9, Chapter 9].</ref>[[Robert the Monk]] is the only contemporary chronicler of the crusade to report that Godfrey took the title "king".<ref>[[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], "The Title of Godfrey of Bouillon", ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research'' 52 (1979), 83-86, and Alan V. Murray, "The Title of Godfrey of Bouillon as Ruler of Jerusalem", ''Collegium Medievale'' 3 (1990), 163-78.</ref>  In the last action of the crusade, Godfrey defeated an invading Fatimid army at the [[Battle of Ascalon]]. He died in July 1100, and was succeeded by his brother, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] of Edessa, the first to take the title [[Kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]].

===Crusade of 1101 and the establishment of the kingdom===
{{Main|Crusade of 1101}}
[[Image:Crusade of 1101 v1.svg|right|225px|thumb|A map of western [[Anatolia]], showing the routes taken by Christian armies during the [[Crusade of 1101]].]]
Having captured Jerusalem and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], the crusading vow was now fulfilled.<ref name=Lock141>Lock ''Companion to the Crusades'' p. 141</ref> However, there were many who had gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at all.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} When the success of the crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the clergy.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Many crusaders who had remained with the crusade all the way to Jerusalem also went home; according to Fulcher of Chartres there were only a few hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

In 1101, another crusade set out, including Stephen of Blois and Hugh of Vermandois, both of whom had returned home before reaching Jerusalem. This crusade was almost annihilated in Asia Minor by the Seljuks, but the survivors helped reinforce the kingdom when they arrived in Jerusalem.<ref name=Lock142>Lock ''Companion to the Crusades'' pp. 142&ndash;144</ref> In the following years, assistance was also provided by [[Italy|Italian]] merchants who established themselves in the Syrian ports, and from the religious and military orders of the [[Knights Templars]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] which were created during Baldwin I's reign.

==Analysis of the First Crusade==
===Aftermath===

The success of the First Crusade was unprecedented.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Newly achieved stability in the west left a warrior aristocracy in search of new conquests and patrimony, and the new prosperity of major towns also meant that money was available to equip expeditions.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The Italian maritime city states, in particular Venice and Genoa, were interested in extending trade. The Papacy saw the Crusades as a way to assert Catholic influence as a unifying force, with war as a religious mission.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} This was a new attitude to religion: it brought religious discipline, previously applicable only to monks, to soldiery&mdash;the new concept of a religious warrior and the chivalric ethos.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

The First Crusade succeeded in establishing the "[[Crusader State]]s" of [[County of Edessa|Edessa]], [[Principality of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], and [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]] in [[Palestine]] and [[Syria]] (as well as allies along the Crusaders' route, such as the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]).

Back at home in western Europe, those who had survived to reach Jerusalem were treated as heroes.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert of Flanders]] was nicknamed "Hierosolymitanus" thanks to his exploits.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The life of Godfrey of Bouillon became legendary even within a few years of his death.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} In some cases, the political situation at home was greatly affected by crusader absences: while [[Robert Curthose]] was away, England had passed to his brother [[Henry I of England]], and their conflict resulted in the [[Battle of Tinchebrai]] in 1106.

Meanwhile the establishment of the crusader states in the east helped ease Seljuk pressure on the Byzantine Empire, which had regained some of its Anatolian territory with crusader help, and experienced a period of relative peace and prosperity in the 12th century. The effect on the Muslim dynasties of the east was gradual but important.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} In the wake of the death of [[Malik Shah I]] in 1092 the political instability and the division of [[Great Seljuk]], that had pressed the [[Byzantine]] call for aid to the [[Pope]], meant that it had prevented a coherent defense against the aggressive and expansionist Latin states.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Cooperation between them remained difficult for many decades, but from Egypt to Syria to Baghdad there were calls for the expulsion of the crusaders, culminating in the recapture of Jerusalem under [[Saladin]] later in the century when the [[Ayyubid]]s had united the surrounding areas.

Pope Urban II’s reasons for calling for a Crusade to the Holy Land were to regain Papacy supreme spiritual authority in Latin Christendom while expanding his realpolitik power.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} He failed to bridge the growing schism between the East and West and inadvertently, with the sacking of Constantinople during the later crusades, actually solidified the schism.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The Crusades also militarily assisted the weakening Byzantine Empire by repulsing the growing Seljuk menace from the Holy Lands and setting up small individual kingdoms.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

===Pilgrims===

Although it is called the First Crusade, no one saw himself as a "crusader".{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The term ''crusade'' is an early 13th century term that first appears in Latin over 100 years after the first crusade.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Nor did the crusaders see themselves as the first, since they did not know there would be later crusades. They saw themselves simply as pilgrims (''peregrinatores'') on a journey (''iter''), and were referred to as such in contemporary accounts.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

Taking an oath to the church to complete the journey, and punishment by excommunication if one failed to do so, were the solidifying factors of making the crusade an official pilgrimage.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}  Crusaders were to swear that their journey would only be complete once they set foot inside the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Pilgrimages were open to all those who wished to take part; undesirable candidates, women, the elderly and the infirm, were discouraged from joining but there was no way to stop them.

===Popularity of the Crusade===

The first Crusade attracted the largest number of peasants and what started as a minor call for military aid turned into a mass migration of peoples.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The call to go on crusade was very popular.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Two medieval roles, holy warrior and pilgrim, were merged into one.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Like a holy warrior in a holy war, one would carry a weapon and fight for the Church with all its spiritual benefits, including the privilege of an [[indulgence]] or [[martyrdom]] if one died in battle.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

Just like a pilgrim on a pilgrimage, a crusader would have the right to hospitality and personal protection of self and property by the Church.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The benefits of the indulgence were therefore twofold, both for fighting as a warrior of the Church and for traveling as a pilgrim. Thus, an indulgence would be granted regardless of whether one lived or died.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} But the crusade was not an indulgence in the medieval sense, medieval indulgences were bought and sold. The crusade was not an easy absolution of sins but a form of penitence because it was undertaken voluntarily and was a type of self-inflicted punishment. This crucial difference separates the medieval indulgence and the original crusade idea.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

In addition there were [[feudal]] obligations because many crusaders went because they were required to do so by their lord. The poorer classes looked to local nobility for guidance and a powerful aristocrat could motivate others to join the cause as well. The connection to a wealthy leader allowed the average peasant to contribute and have some sort of protection on the journey, unlike those who undertook the vow alone.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}  There were also family obligations, with many people joining the crusade in order to support relatives who had also taken the crusading vow.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Some nobility, including several kings and heirs, were prohibited to join because of their position.  All of these factors motivated different people for different reasons and contributed to the popularity of the crusade.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

===Spiritual versus earthly rewards===

The call to crusade came at a time when years of good harvests had increased the Western European population allowing larger armies of Christendom to initiate the reconquista and this Crusade.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Nonetheless, the attraction of trying to start a new life in the far more successful East caused many people to leave their lands.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The expanding population meant that Europe was not a place of great opportunity anymore and the possibility of gaining something, whether spiritual, political or economic, was tempting to countless participants.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

Older scholarship on this issue asserts that the bulk of the participants were likely younger sons of nobles who were dispossessed of land and influenced by the practise of [[primogeniture]], and poorer knights who were looking for a new life in the wealthy east.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Many had fought in order to drive out the Muslim armies in Southern Spain, or had relatives who had done so.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The rumours of treasures that were discovered there may have been an attractive feature, for if there was such treasure in Spain there must have been even more in Jerusalem.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Most didn't find this type of treasure, mostly insignificant relics were uncovered.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} While this is true in some respect it cannot be the only motivation for so many.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

However, current research suggests that although Urban promised crusaders spiritual as well as material benefit, the primary aim of most crusaders was spiritual rather than material gain.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Moreover, recent research by [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] instead shows that the crusade was an immensely expensive undertaking, affordable only to those knights who were already fairly wealthy, such as [[Hugh of Vermandois]] and [[Robert Curthose]], who were relatives of the French and English royal families, and [[Raymond IV of Toulouse|Raymond of Toulouse]], who ruled much of southern France.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Even then, these wealthy knights had to sell much of their land to relatives or the church before they could afford to participate.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Their relatives, too, often had to impoverish themselves in order to raise money for the crusade.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} As Riley-Smith says, "there really is no evidence to support the proposition that the crusade was an opportunity for spare sons to make themselves scarce in order to relieve their families of burdens".<ref>Riley-Smith, Jonathan, ''The First Crusade and the Idea of Crusading'', p. 47.</ref>

As an example of spiritual over earthly motivation, [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and his brother Baldwin settled previous quarrels with the church by bequeathing their land to local clergy.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The charters denoting these transactions were written by clergymen, not the knights themselves, and seem to idealize the knights as pious men seeking only to fulfill a vow of pilgrimage.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

Further, poorer knights (''minores'', as opposed to the greater knights, the ''principes'') could go on crusade only if they expected to survive off [[alms]]giving, or if they could enter the service of a wealthier knight, as was the case with [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]], who agreed to serve his uncle Bohemond. Later crusades would be organized by wealthy kings and emperors, or would be supported by special crusade taxes.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

==In arts and literature==

The success of the crusade inspired the literary imagination of poets in France{{Fact|date=November 2008}}, who, in the 12th century, began to compose various ''[[chansons de geste]]'' celebrating the exploits of Godfrey of Bouillon and the other crusaders. Some of these, such as the most famous, the [[Chanson d'Antioche]], are semi-historical, while others are completely fanciful, describing battles with a dragon or connecting Godfrey's ancestors to the legend of the [[Swan Knight]]. Together, the ''chansons'' are known as the [[crusade cycle]].

The First Crusade was also an inspiration to artists in later centuries. In 1580, [[Torquato Tasso]] wrote ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', a largely fictionalized [[epic poem]] about the capture of Jerusalem. [[George Frideric Handel]] composed music based on Tasso's poem in his opera, ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]''. The 19th century poet [[Tommaso Grossi]] also wrote an epic poem, which was the basis of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[I Lombardi alla prima crociata]]''. 

[[Gustave Doré]] made a number of engravings based on episodes from the First Crusade.

Stephen J Rivelle has written a largely fictional account of the First Crusade, in his book A Booke of Days, as has [[Stephen R Lawhead]], with the first of a trilogy, named 'The Celtic Crusades: Book 1: The Iron Lance'

According to [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasty stone monuments, a [[Kehilla|Jewish community]] has existed in [[China]] since the [[Han Dynasty]], but a majority of scholars cite the early [[Song Dynasty]] (roughly a century before the First Crusade).<ref>Weisz, Tiberiu. ''The Kaifeng Stone Inscriptions: The Legacy of the Jewish Community in Ancient China''. New York: iUniverse, 2006 (ISBN 0-595-37340-2).</ref> A legend common among the modern-day descendants of the [[Kaifeng Jews]] states they reached China after fleeing [[Bodrum]] from the invading crusaders.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} A section of the legend reads, “The Jews became merchants and traders in the region, but new troubles came in the 1090s. Life became difficult and dangerous. The first bad news was heralded by a word they had never heard before: 'Crusade,' the so-called Holy War...Jews were warned; "Convert to Christianity or die!"<ref>Xu, Xin, Beverly Friend, and Cheng Ting.
