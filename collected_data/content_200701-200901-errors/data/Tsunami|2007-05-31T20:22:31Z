A '''tsunami''' (soo-nah-mee; [[IPA]]: {{IPA|/tsʊˈnɑːmi/}}) is a series of [[Ocean surface wave|waves]] created when a body of water, such as an [[ocean]], is rapidly displaced on a massive scale. [[Earthquake]]s, [[mass movement]]s above or below water, [[volcanic eruption]]s and other [[underwater explosion]]s, [[landslides]], large [[impact event|meteorite impacts]] and testing with [[nuclear weapon]]s at sea all have the potential to generate a tidal wave.  The effects of a tidal wave can range from unnoticeable to devastating.  
The term tsunami comes from the [[Japanese language|Japanese words]](津波、つなみ) meaning ''[[harbor]]'' ("tsu", [[wikt:津|津]]) and ''[[Ocean surface wave|wave]]'' ("nami", [[wikt:波|波]]).  [a. Jap. tsunami, tunami, f. tsu harbour + nami waves. - Oxford English Dictionary] Although in Japanese tsunami is used for both the singular and plural, in English ''tsunamis'' is often used as the plural. The term was created by fishermen who returned to port to find the area surrounding their [[harbor]] devastated, although they had not been aware of any [[Ocean surface wave|wave]] in the [[open water]].  Tsunami are common throughout [[Japanese history]]; approximately 195 events in Japan have been recorded. 

A tsunami has a much smaller [[amplitude]] (wave height) offshore, and a very long [[wavelength]] (often hundreds of kilometers long), which is why they generally pass unnoticed at sea, forming only a passing "hump" in the ocean. Tsunami have been historically referred to as ''[[tidal wave]]s'' because as they approach land, they take on the characteristics of a violent onrushing [[tide]] rather than the sort of cresting waves that are formed by wind action upon the ocean (with which people are more familiar).  Since they are not actually related to tides the term is considered misleading and its usage is discouraged by [[oceanographer]]s.  [http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learning/topics/canit.php]  Since not all tsunami occur in harbors, however, that term is equally misleading, although it does have the benefit of being misleading in a different language.

== Causes ==

[[Image:Tsunami comic book style.png|right|thumb|Generation of a tsunami]] 
A tidal wave can be generated when the [[plate boundaries]] abruptly deform and vertically displace the overlying water. Such large vertical movements of the Earth’s crust can occur at [[plate boundaries]]. [[Subduction]] earthquakes are particularly effective in generating tidal waves. 

Tsunami are [[gravity wave|surface gravity waves]] that are formed as the displaced water mass moves under the influence of [[gravity]] and radiates across the ocean like ripples on a pond. 
 
In the 1950s it was discovered by that larger tidal waves than previously believed possible could be caused by [[landslides]], explosive volcanic action, and [[impact event]]s when they contact water. These phenomena rapidly displace large volumes of water, as energy from falling debris or expansion is transferred to the water into which the debris falls. Tidal waves caused by these mechanisms, unlike the ocean-wide tidal waves caused by some earthquakes, generally dissipate quickly and rarely affect coastlines distant from the source due to the small area of sea affected. These events can give rise to much larger local [[shock wave]]s ([[solitons]]), such as the landslide at the head of [[Lituya Bay]] which produced a water wave estimated at 50&nbsp;&ndash; 150&nbsp;m and reached 524&nbsp;m up local mountains. However, an extremely large landslide could generate a “[[megatsunami]]” that might have ocean-wide impacts.

The geological record tells us that there have been massive tidal waves in Earth's past.  <!-- These tsunami were so large that they caused landslides on the opposite coast triggering another massive tidal wave, or "bounce back" tsunami.  An example today would be a landslide equivalent to everything west of [[Portland, Oregon]] falling into the [[Pacific Ocean]], resulting in a tidal wave that would then hit the Chinese coast with enough force to erode the coast, triggering a landslide large enough to send a tidal wave that would in turn inundate the U.S. West Coast and would wipe out Portland. --> <!-- This section sounds mightily implausible to me, needs reference - see talk page -->

== Signs of an approaching tsunami ==
There is often no advance warning of an approaching tidal wave. However, since earthquakes are often a cause of tsunami, an earthquake felt near a body of water may be considered an indication that a tsunami will shortly follow.

When the first part of a tidal wave to reach land is a trough rather than a crest of the wave, the water along the shoreline may recede dramatically, exposing areas that are normally always submerged.  This can serve as an advance warning of the approaching crest of the tidal wave, although the warning arrives only a very short time before the crest, which typically arrives seconds to minutes later.[http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tsunami/PNG/Upng/Davies020411/]
In the 2004 tsunami that occurred in the Indian Ocean the sea receding was not reported on the African coast or any other western coasts it hit, when the tsunami approached from the east.

== Warnings and prevention ==

|}
Tidal waves cannot be prevented or precisely predicted, but there are some warning signs of an impending tsunami, and there are many systems being developed and in use to reduce the damage from such tidal waves.

In instances where the leading edge of the tidal wave is its trough, the sea will recede from the coast half of the wave's period before the wave's arrival. If the slope is shallow, this recession can exceed many hundreds of meters. People unaware of the danger may remain at the shore due to curiosity, or for collecting fish from the exposed seabed.

[[Image:Kamakura_tsunami.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Tsunami warning sign on [[seawall]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], Japan, 2004. In the [[Muromachi period]], a tsunami struck Kamakura, destroying the wooden building that housed the colossal statue of [[Amitabha|Amida]] [[Buddha]] at [[Kotokuin]]. Since that time, the statue has been outdoors.]]

Regions with a high risk of tsunami may use [[tsunami warning system|tsunami warning systems]] to detect tsunami and warn the general population before the wave reaches land. In some communities on the west coast of the United States, which is prone to Pacific Ocean tsunami, warning signs advise people where to run in the event of an incoming tsunami.  [[Computer model]]s can roughly predict tsunami arrival and impact based on information about the event that triggered it and the shape of the seafloor ([[bathymetry]]) and coastal land ([[topography]]). [http://www.tsunami.noaa.gov/tsunami_story.html]

One of the early warnings comes from nearby animals. Many animals sense danger and flee to higher ground before the water arrives. The Lisbon quake is the first documented case of such a phenomenon in Europe. The phenomenon was also noted in [[Sri Lanka]] in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4381395.stm] Some scientists speculate that animals may have an ability to sense subsonic [[Rayleigh waves]] from an earthquake minutes or hours before a tsunami strikes shore (Kenneally, [http://www.slate.com/id/2111608]).  More likely, though, is that the certain large animals (e.g., elephants) heard the sounds of the tsunami as it approached the coast.  The elephants reactions were to go in the direction opposite of the noise, and thus go inland.  Humans, on the other hand, head down to the shore to investigate.

While it is not possible to prevent tsunami, in some particularly tsunami-prone countries some measures have been taken to reduce the damage caused on shore. Japan has implemented an extensive programme of building [[tsunami wall|tsunami walls]] of up to 4.5 m (13.5 ft) high in front of populated coastal areas. Other localities have built floodgates and channels to redirect the water from incoming tsunami. However, their effectiveness has been questioned, as tsunami are often higher than the barriers. For instance, the tsunami which struck the island of [[Hokkaidō]] on [[July 12]], [[1993]] created waves as much as 30 m (100 ft) tall - as high as a 10-story building. The port town of [[Aonae]] was completely surrounded by a tsunami wall, but the waves washed right over the wall and destroyed all the wood-framed structures in the area. The wall may have succeeded in slowing down and moderating the height of the tsunami, but it did not prevent major destruction and loss of life. 

The effects of a tsunami can be mitigated by natural factors such as tree cover on the shoreline. Some locations in the path of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami escaped almost unscathed as a result of the tsunami’s energy being sapped by a belt of trees such as [[coconut palm]]s and [[mangrove]]s. In one striking example, the village of Naluvedapathy in India's [[Tamil Nadu]] region suffered minimal damage and few deaths as the wave broke up on a forest of 80,244 trees planted along the shoreline in 2002 in a bid to enter the [[Guinness Book of Records]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4269847.stm] Environmentalists have suggested tree planting along stretches of seacoast which are prone to tsunami risks. While it would take some years for the trees to grow to a useful size, such plantations could offer a much cheaper and longer-lasting means of tsunami mitigation than the costly and environmentally destructive method of erecting artificial barriers.

{{see also|List of natural disasters by death toll#Tsunamis}}

Tsunami occur most frequently in the Pacific Ocean, but are a global phenomenon; they are possible wherever large bodies of water are found, including inland lakes, where they can be caused by landslides. Very small tsunami, non-destructive and undetectable without specialized equipment, occur frequently as a result of minor earthquakes and other events. 

Japan is the nation with the most recorded tsunami in the world.  The earliest recorded disaster being that of the A.D. 684  [[Kakuho Earthquake]]. The number of tsunami in Japan totals 195 over a 1,313 year period, averaging one event every 6.7 years, the highest rate of occurrence in the world.  These waves have hit with such violent fury that entire towns have been destroyed. 
 
On [[December 26]], [[2004]], an undersea earthquake measuring 9.3 on the Earthquake Magnitude scale occurred 160&nbsp;km (100 mi) off the western coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. It was the second largest earthquake in recorded history and generated massive tsunamis, which caused widespread devastation when they hit land, leaving an estimated 230,000 people dead in countries around the Indian Ocean.<sup> [http://www.rekihaku.ac.jp/e_news/index75/index.html] </sup>

[[Bristol Channel]] floods resulted in the drowning of an estimated 2,000 or more people, with houses and villages swept away, farmland inundated and livestock destroyed, wrecking the local economy along the coasts of the Bristol Channel, UK. Some churches have plaques up to 8ft above sea level to show how high the waters rose.  

The cause of the flood is not yet proven, but a research paper published in the journal ''Archaeology in the Severn Estuary'' [http://www.bathspa.ac.uk/schools/science-and-the-environment/geography/Tsunami/Archaeology%20in%20the%20Severn%20Estuary%202002%20paper.pdf] in [[2002]] following investigations by Professor Simon Haslett, from [[Bath Spa University]], and Australian geologist Ted Bryant, from the [[University of Wollongong]], proposed that the flooding was caused by a tsunami. 

The [[British Geological Survey]] has suggested an earthquake on a known unstable [[Geologic fault|fault]] off the coast of [[Ireland]] causing the vertical displacement of the sea floor as the possible cause.

=== 1700 - Vancouver Island, Canada ===
[[January 26]], [[1700]] - The [[Cascadia Earthquake]], one of the largest earthquakes on record (estimated MW 9 magnitude), ruptured the [[Cascadia subduction zone]] ([[Cascadia subduction zone|C]][[subduction zone|SZ]]) offshore from [[Vancouver Island]] to northern California, and caused massive tsunami across the [[Pacific Northwest]] logged in Japan and oral traditions of the Native Americans. [[Brian Atwater|Brian F. Atwater]], Musumi-Rokkaku Satoko, Satake Kenji, Tsuji Yoshinobu, Ueda Kazue, and David K. Yamaguch prepared a "scientific detective story" investigating this tsunami entitled ''The Orphan Tsunami of 1700—Japanese Clues to a Parent Earthquake in North America''. This document is downloadable and available [http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1707/ online].

=== 1755 - Lisbon, Portugal ===
Tens of thousands of Portuguese who survived the '''[[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Great Lisbon Earthquake]]''' on [[November 1]] were killed by a tsunami which followed a half hour later. Many townspeople fled to the waterfront, believing the area safe from fires and from falling debris from aftershocks. Before the great wall of water hit the harbour, waters retreated, revealing lost cargo and forgotten [[shipwreck]]s. These people did not know that a Tsunami is a succession of waves, rather than just a single one.

The earthquake, tsunami, and many forest fires killed between 60,000 and 100,000 of Lisbon's pre-quake population of 275,000. Historical records of explorations by [[Vasco da Gama]] and other early navigators were lost, and countless buildings were destroyed (including most examples of Portugal's [[Manueline]] architecture). Europeans of the 18th century struggled to understand the disaster within [[religion|religious]] and [[rationality|rational]] belief systems. Philosophers of the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], notably [[Voltaire]], wrote about the event. The [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], as described by philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in the ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'', took inspiration in part from attempts to comprehend the enormity of the Lisbon quake and tsunami.

The tsunami took just over 4 hours to travel over 1,000 miles to [[Cornwall#Tsunami in 1755|Cornwall]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. An account by [[Arnold Boscowitz]] (a century later) claimed "great loss of life."

=== 1771 - Yaeyama Islands, Okinawa, Japan ===
An undersea earthquake of estimated magnitude 7.4 occurred near [[Yaeyama Islands]] in [[Okinawa]], [[Japan]] on [[4 April]], [[1771]] at about 8 [[ante meridiem|A.M.]]. The earthquake is not believed to have directly resulted in any deaths, but a resulting tsunami is thought to have killed about 12,000 people, (9313 on the Yaeyama Islands and 2548 on Miyako Islands according to one source([http://www3.pref.okinawa.jp/site/view/contview.jsp?cateid=41&id=3360&page=1]). Estimates of the highest seawater runup on [[Ishigaki Island]], range between 30 meters and 85.4 meters. The tsunami put an abrupt stop to population growth on the islands, and was followed by [[malaria]] epidemics and crop failures which decreased the population further. It was to be another 148 years before population returned to its pre-tsunami level.

=== 1792 - Tsunami in Kyūshū, Japan ===
Tsunami were the main cause of death for Japan's worst-ever volcanic disaster, due to an eruption of [[Mount Unzen]] in [[Nagasaki Prefecture]], [[Kyūshū]], [[Japan]]. It began towards the end of 1791 as a series of earthquakes on the western flank of Mount Unzen which gradually moved towards ''Fugen-daké'', one of Mount Unzen's peaks. In February 1792, ''Fugen-daké'' started to erupt, triggering a lava flow which continued for two months. Meanwhile, the earthquakes continued, shifting nearer to the city of [[Shimabara, Nagasaki|Shimabara]]. On the night of 21st May, two large earthquakes were followed by a collapse of the eastern flank of Mount Unzen's Mayuyama dome, causing an avalanche which swept through Shimabara and into Ariake Bay, triggering a tsunami. It is not known to this day whether the collapse occurred as a result of an eruption of the dome or as a result of the earthquakes. The tsunami struck [[Higo Province]] on the other side of [[Ariake Bay]] before bouncing back and hitting Shimabara again. Out of an estimated total of 15,000 fatalities, around 5,000 is thought to have been killed by the landslide, around 5,000 by the tsunami across the bay in Higo Province, and a further 5,000 by the tsunami returning to strike Shimabara.

=== 1868 - Hawaiian Islands local tsunami generated by earthquake ===
On [[April 2]], [[1868]], a local earthquake with a magnitude estimated between 7.25 and 7.75 rocked the southeast coast of the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii (state)|Hawai’i]].  It triggered a landslide on the slopes of the [[Mauna Loa]] volcano, five miles north of [[Pahala]], killing 31 people.  A tsunami then claimed 46 additional lives.  The villages of [[Punaluu]], Ninole, Kawaa, Honuapo, and Keauhou Landing were severely damaged.  According to one account, the tsunami "rolled in over the tops of the coconut trees, probably 60 feet high .... inland a distance of a quarter of a mile in some places, taking out to sea when it returned, houses, men, women, and almost everything movable."  This was reported in the 1988 edition of Walter C. Dudley's book "Tsunami!" (ISBN 0-8248-1125-9).

=== 1883 - Krakatoa explosive eruption ===
The island volcano of '''[[Krakatoa]]''' in Indonesia exploded with devastating fury on August 26-27, 1883, blowing its underground [[magma]] chamber partly empty so that much overlying land and seabed collapsed into it. A series of large tsunami waves was generated from the collapse, some reaching a height of over 40&nbsp;meters above sea level. Tsunami waves were observed throughout the [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Pacific Ocean]], the American West Coast, South America, and even as far away as the [[English Channel]]. On the facing coasts of [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]] the sea flood went many miles inland and caused such vast loss of life that one area was never resettled but went back to the [[jungle]] and is now the [[Ujung Kulon]] [[nature reserve]].

[[Image:Burnintsunami.jpg|thumb|250px|The aftermath of the tsunami that struck [[Newfoundland]] in [[1929]].]]

=== 1896 - Sanriku coast, Japan ===
On [[15 June]], [[1896]], at around 19:32 local time, a [[Richter scale|magnitude]] 8.5 undersea earthquake off the Sanriku coast of northeastern [[Honshū]], [[Japan]], triggered tsunami waves which struck the coast about half an hour later. Although the earthquake itself is not thought to have resulted in any fatalities, the waves, the highest recorded measurement of which reaching 38.2 meters, killed approximately 20,000 people.

=== 1917 - Halifax Explosion and tsunami ===
The [[Halifax Explosion]] occurred on Thursday, [[December 6]], [[1917]] at 9:04:35 A.M. local time in [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] in [[Canada]], when the French munitions ship ''Mont-Blanc'', bound for [[World War I]] France, collided with the Norwegian ship ''Imo'', chartered to carry Belgian relief supplies. In the aftermath of the collision, ''Mont-Blanc'' caught fire and [[explosion|exploded]]. The explosion caused a tsunami, and a [[shock wave|pressure wave]] of air.

=== 1923 - The Great Kanto Earthquake, Japan ===
The [[Great Kanto Earthquake]], which occurred in Eastern [[Japan]] on [[1 September]], [[1923]], and devastated [[Tokyo]], [[Yokohama]] and the surrounding areas, caused tsunami which struck the [[Shonan]] coast, [[Boso Peninsula]], [[Izu Islands]] and the east coast of [[Izu Peninsula]], within minutes in some cases. In [[Atami]], waves reaching 12 meters were recorded. Examples of tsunami damage include about 100 people killed along [[Yui-ga-hama]] beach in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] and an estimated 50 people on the [[Enoshima]] causeway. However, tsunami only accounted for a small proportion of the final death toll of over 100,000, most of whom were killed in fire.

=== 1929 - Newfoundland tsunami ===
On [[November 18]], [[1929]], an [[1929 Grand Banks earthquake|earthquake of magnitude 7.2]] occurred beneath the [[Laurentian Slope]] on the [[Grand Banks]]. The quake was felt throughout the Atlantic Provinces of [[Canada]] and as far west as [[Ottawa]] and as far south as [[Claymont, Delaware]]. The resulting tsunami measured over 7 meters in height and took about 2½ hours to reach the [[Burin Peninsula]] on the south coast of [[Newfoundland]], where 29 people lost their lives in various communities. It also snapped telegraph lines laid under the Atlantic.

=== 1933 - Sanriku coast, Japan ===
On [[March 3]], [[1933]], the Sanriku coast of northeastern [[Honshū]], [[Japan]] which had already suffered a devastating tsunami in 1896 (see above) was again stuck by tsunami waves as a result of an offshore magnitude 8.1 earthquake. The quake destroyed about 5,000 homes and killed 3,068 people, the vast majority as a result of tsunami waves. Especially hard hit was the coastal village of Taro (now part of [[Miyako, Iwate|Miyako city]]) in [[Iwate Prefecture]], which lost 42% of its total population and 98% of its buildings. Taro is now protected by an enormous tsunami wall, currently 10 meters in height and over 2 kilometers long. The original [[seawall|wall]], constructed in 1958, saved Taro from yet another destruction from the 1960 Chilean tsunami (see below).

=== 1944 - Tonankai Earthquake, Japan ===
A magnitude 8.0 earthquake on [[7 December]], [[1944]], about 20 km off the  [[Shima Peninsula]] in [[Japan]], caused tsunami which struck the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of central Japan, mainly [[Mie Prefecture|Mie]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], and [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]s. News of the event was downplayed by the authorities in order to protect [[World War II|wartime]] [[morale]], and as a result the full extent of the damage is not known, but the quake is estimated to have killed 1223 people, the tsunami being the leading cause of the fatalities.

=== 1946 - Nankai Earthquake, Japan ===
The Nankai earthquake, a periodic earthquake of around magnitude 8.0 which occurs off the southern coast of [[Kii Peninsula]] and [[Shikoku]], Japan every 100 to 150 years, last struck on [[21 December]], [[1946]]. The resulting tsunami hit the Pacific coast of western Japan. Particularly hard hit were the coastal towns of [[Kushimoto, Wakayama|Kushimoto]] and [[Kainan, Wakayama|Kainan]] on the Kii Peninsula. The quake led to more than 1400 deaths, tsunami being the leading cause .

=== 1946 - Pacific tsunami ===
[[Image:Tsunami large.jpg|thumb|250px|Residents run from an approaching tsunami in [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo, Hawai’i]]]]
The April 1 [[Aleutian Island earthquake]] tsunami that killed 159 people on [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai’i]] and five in [[Alaska]] (the [[lighthouse]] keepers at the [[Scotch Cap Light]] in the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutians]]) resulted in the creation of a [[tsunami warning system|tsunami warning system]] known as the Pacific Tsunami Warning System (specifically the [[Pacific Tsunami Warning Center|PTWC]]), established in 1949 for [[Pacific Ocean]] area countries. The tsunami is known as the ''[[April Fools Day]] Tsunami'' in Hawai’i due to people thinking the warnings were an April Fools prank.

=== 1958 - Lituya Bay megatsunami ===
On July 9, 1958, an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.3 on the [[Richter scale]] rocked a small [[inlet]] in [[Alaska]] called [[Lituya Bay]]. It then caused part of a mountain at the back of the bay to collapse, causing a monstrous tsunami (an [[Megatsunami|''iminami'']]) to fly headlong through the bay. At a mountain at the mouth of the bay, the run was measured to be 524 [[Metre|m]] (about 1742 [[foot (unit)|ft]]) making it the largest wave in recorded history. It swept up three boats; one managed to ride the wave, but the other two were swept into the [[Pacific Ocean]], where they were completely destroyed and four people aboard them were killed.

=== 1960 - Chilean tsunami ===
The magnitude 9.5 '''[[Great Chilean Earthquake]]''' of [[May 22]], [[1960]] is the strongest earthquake ever recorded. Its [[epicenter]], off the coast of South Central [[Chile]], generated one of the most destructive tsunami of the 20th Century. 

It spread across the entire Pacific Ocean, with waves measuring up to 25 meters high. The first tsunami arrived at [[Hilo, Hawai'i|Hilo]] approximately 14.8 hrs after it originated off the coast of South Central Chile. The highest wave at Hilo Bay was measured at around 10.7 m (35 ft). 61 lives were lost allegedly due to people's failure to heed warning sirens. 

Almost 22 hours after the quake, the waves hit the ill-fated Sanriku coast of Japan, reaching up to 3 m above high tide, and killed 142 people. Up to 6,000 people died in total worldwide due to the earthquake and tsunami.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.em-dat.net|accessdate=2006-05-30|publisher=CRED|title="Emergency & Disasters Data Base"}}</ref>

The 200-250 metre wall of water (megatsunami) that over-topped the dam would have obscured virtually all of the sky in this picture.]]
=== 1963 Vajont Dam Megatsunami ===

The [[Vajont Dam]] was completed in 1961 under [[Monte Toc]], 100 km north of [[Venice]], [[Italy]]. At 262 metres, it was one of the highest dams in the world. On October 9, 1963 an enormous landslide of about 260 million cubic metres of forest, earth, and rock, fell into the reservoir at up to 110 km per hour (68 mph). The resulting displacement of water caused 50 million cubic metres of water to overtop the dam in a 250-metre high wave. The flooding destroyed the villages of [[Longarone]], [[Pirago]], [[Rivalta]], [[Villanova]] and [[Faè]], killing 1,450 people. Almost 2,000 people (some sources report 1,909) perished in total.

=== 1964 - Good Friday tsunami ===
After the magnitude 8.6 '''[[Good Friday Earthquake]]''' (Friday, [[March 27]], [[1964]]), tsunami struck [[Alaska]], [[British Columbia]], [[California]], and coastal [[Pacific Northwest]] towns, killing 121 people.  The waves caused by the Tsunami were up to 23 m tall, and killed 11 people as far away as [[Crescent City, California]].

=== 1976 - Moro Gulf tsunami ===
On [[August 16]], [[1976]] at 12:11 A.M., a devastating earthquake of 7.9 hit the island of [[Mindanao]], [[Philippines]]. It created a tsunami that devastated more than 700 km of coastline bordering Moro Gulf in the [[North Celebes Sea]]. An estimated number of victims for this tragedy left 5,000 dead, 2,200 missing or presumed dead, more than 9,500 injured and a total of 93,500 people were left homeless. It devastated the cities of [[Cotabato City|Cotabato]], [[Pagadian City|Pagadian]], and [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], and the and provinces of [[Basilan]], [[Lanao del Norte]], [[Lanao del Sur]], [[Maguindanao]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Sulu]], and [[Zamboanga del Sur]].

=== 1979 - Tumaco tsunami ===
A magnitude 7.9 earthquake occurred on [[December 12]], [[1979]] at 7:59:4.3 [[UTC]] along the Pacific coast of [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]]. The earthquake and the resulting tsunami caused the destruction of at least six fishing villages and the death of hundreds of people in the Colombian province of [[Nariño Department|Nariño]]. The earthquake was felt in [[Bogotá]], [[Cali]], [[Popayán]], [[Buenaventura]], and several other cities and towns in Colombia and in [[Guayaquil]], [[Esmeraldas (city)|Esmeraldas]], [[Quito]], and other parts of Ecuador. When the '''Tumaco Tsunami''' hit the coast, it caused huge destruction in the city of [[Tumaco]], as well as in the small towns of El Charco, San Juan, Mosquera, and Salahonda on the Pacific coast of Colombia. The total number of victims of this tragedy was 259 dead, 798 wounded and 95 missing or presumed dead.

=== 1983 - Sea of Japan tsunami ===
On [[May 26]], [[1983]] at 11:59:57 local time, a magnitude-7.7 earthquake occurred in the [[Sea of Japan]], about 100 km west of the coast of [[Noshiro, Akita|Noshiro]] in [[Akita Prefecture]], [[Japan]].  Out of the 107 fatalities, all but four were killed by the resulting tsunami, which struck communities along the coast, especially [[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]] and [[Akita Prefecture]]s and the east coast of [[Noto Peninsula]]. Footage of the tsunami hitting the fishing harbor of [[Wajima]] on Noto Peninsula was broadcast on TV. The waves exceeded 10 meters in some areas. Three of the fatalities were along the east coast of [[South Korea]] (whether [[North Korea]] was affected is not known).

=== 1993 - Okushiri, Hokkaido tsunami ===
[[Image:1993 Okushiri EB NHK.jpg|frame|right|Map of [[Hokkaidō]] shown on [[NHK]] during an emergency broadcast.]]A devastating ''tsunami wave'' occurred along the coasts of [[Hokkaidō]] in Japan as a result of a magnitude 7.8 earthquake, 80 miles offshore, on [[July 12]], [[1993]].<br /> 
Within minutes, the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]{{Fact|date=March 2007}} issued a tsunami warning that was broadcast on [[NHK]] in English and Japanese (archived at [[YouTube]][http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCgFjjDWJ3w]). However, it was too late for [[Okushiri, Hokkaido|Okushiri]], a small island near the epicenter, which was struck with extremely big waves, some reaching 30 meters, within two to five minutes of the quake. Aonae, a village on a low-lying peninsula at the southern tip of the island, was devastated over the course of the following hour by 13 waves of over two meters’ height arriving from multiple directions, including waves that had bounced back off Hokkaidō—despite being surrounded by tsunami barriers. Of 250 people killed as a result of the quake, 197 were victims of the series of tsunamis that hit Okushiri; the waves also caused deaths on the coast of Hokkaidō. While many residents, remembering the 1983 tsunami (see above), survived by quickly evacuating on foot to higher ground, it is thought that many others underestimated how soon the waves would arrive (the 1983 tsunami took 17 [[minute]]s to hit Okushiri) and were killed as they attempted to evacuate by car along the village’s narrow lanes. The highest wave of the tsunami was a staggering 31 meters (102 feet) high.

=== 1998 - Papua New Guinea ===
On [[17 July]], [[1998]], a [[Papua New Guinea]] tsunami killed approximately 2200 people [http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/tsunami/PNG.html]. A 7.1 magnitude earthquake 24 km offshore was followed within 11 minutes by a tsunami about 12 m tall. While the magnitude of the quake was not large enough to create these waves directly, it is believed the earthquake generated an undersea landslide, which in turn caused the tsunami. The villages of Arop and Warapu were destroyed.

=== 2004 - Indian Ocean tsunami ===
[[Image:2004-tsunami.jpg|right|thumb|305px|The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake; Tsunami strikes [[Ao Nang]], Thailand.]]
The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], which had a [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] of 9.0[http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/spotlight/tsunami/tsunami.html], triggered a series of lethal tsunami on [[December 26]], [[2004]] that killed approximately 300,000 people (including 168,000 in Indonesia alone), making it the deadliest tsunami as well as one of the [[List of natural disasters by death toll|deadliest natural disasters]] in recorded history. It also had the second largest earthquake in recorded history. The initial surge was measured at a height of approximately 108 feet, making it the largest earthquake-generated tsunami in recorded history. The tsunami killed people over an area ranging from the immediate vicinity of the [[epicenter|quake]] in [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]] and the northwestern coast of [[Malaysia]] to thousands of kilometers away in [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], the [[Maldives]], and even as far away as [[Somalia]], [[Kenya]], and [[Tanzania]] in eastern [[Africa]]. This is an example of a [[teletsunami]] which can travel vast distances across the open ocean, in this case, it is an inter-continential tsunami. Tsunami waves 2.6 meters tall were reported even in places such as [[Mexico]], nearly 13,000 km away from the epicenter. The energies for these waves travel along fault lines and becoming concentrated therefore traveling further.

Unlike in the [[Pacific Ocean]], there was no organized alert service covering the [[Indian Ocean]]. This was in part due to the absence of major tsunami events since 1883 (the [[Krakatoa]] eruption, which killed 36,000 people). In light of the 2004 [[Indian Ocean]] tsunami, [[UNESCO]] and other world bodies have called for an international [[tsunami warning system|tsunami monitoring system]].

=== 2006 - South of Java Island tsunami ===
A 7.7 [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] earthquake rocked the Indian Ocean seabed on [[July 17]],[[2006]], 200&nbsp;km south of [[Pangandaran]], a beautiful beach famous to surfers for its perfect waves. This earthquake triggered tsunami whose heights varied from 2 meters at [[Cilacap]] to 6 meters at [[Cimerak]] beach, where it swept away and flattened buildings as far as 400 meters away from the coastline. More than 800 people were reported missing or dead.   See [[July 2006 Java earthquake]].

=== 2006 - Kuril Islands tsunami ===
On [[November 15]], [[2006]], an 8.1 magnitude quake struck an area claimed by both [[Russia]] and Japan, but the waves near Japan did not swell higher than 23 inches. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Six hours later, tsunami waves up to nearly 5 feet high caused by the quake crashed into [[Crescent City, California]] and [[Santa Cruz, California]] causing considerable damage. See [[2006 Kuril Islands tsunami|2006 Kuril Islands tsunami]].

=== 2007 - Solomon Islands tsunami ===
{{main|2007 Solomon Islands earthquake}}
On [[April 2]], [[2007]], a powerful magnitude 8.1 (initially 7.6) earthquake hit the East Pacific region about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of the Solomon Islands at 7:39 a.m., resulting in a tsunami that was up to 17 feet (5 meters) tall.  The wave, which struck the coast of Solomon Islands (mainly Gizo), triggered region-wide tsunami warnings and watches extending from Japan to New Zealand to Hawaii and the eastern seaboard of Australia.  So far, at least 39 people are confirmed dead with the toll expected to rise. Dozens more have been injured with entire towns inundated by the sweeping water which travelled 300 meters inland in some places. Simbo, Choiseul and Ranunga islands were also affected. A state of national emergency was declared for the Solomon Islands. On the island of Choiseul, a wall of water reported to be 30 feet high swept almost 400 meters inland destroying everything in its path. Officials estimate that the tsunami displaced more than 5000 residents all over the archipelago.

=== European tsunami ===
* [[6100 BC]] - [[Storegga Slide]], [[Norway]]
* [[16 October]] [[1979]] - 23 people died when the coast of [[Nice]], [[France]], was hit by a tsunami. This may have had a man-made cause:  construction at the new Nice airport creating an undersea landslide. [http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/(v5vg3l2tc4kfq2m223kj2l45)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,3,4;journal,18,26;linkingpublicationresults,1:102476,1] [http://www.azurseisme.com/Tsunamis.htm] [http://www.lamouettelaurentine.com/st_laurent_du_var/port/tsunami.htm] [http://cdf.u-3mrs.fr/~lepichon/2006col_fichiers/livret.pdf]

=== Other historic tsunami ===
Other tsunami that have occurred include the following:
* ca. 1600 B.C.: The Israelite [[passage of the Red Sea]] has been linked by some researchers to a tsunami following the volcanic explosion of the Greek island of [[Santorini]].
* ca. 500 B.C.: [[Poompuhar]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]], [[Maldives]]
* ca. 450 B.C.: The Greek historian [[Thucydides]] in his book ''History of the Peloponnesian Wars'', speculated about the causes of tsunami. He argued that it could only be explained as a consequence of ocean earthquakes, and could see no other possible causes for the phenomenon.
* 1541: a tsunami struck the earliest European settlement in Brazil, [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]]. There is no record of deaths or injuries, but the town was almost completely destroyed.
* [[January 20]], [[1606]]/[[1607]]: along the coast of the [[Bristol Channel]] thousands of people were drowned, houses and villages swept away, farmland was inundated and flocks were destroyed by a flood that might have been a tsunami. While it is quite possible that it was caused by a combination of [[meteorology|meteorological extremes]] and [[tide|tidal peaks]], recent evidence points more strongly towards a tsunami.
