'''Absinthe''' (also '''absinth, absenta''') ([[IPA chart for English|IPA]] English: {{IPA|[ˈæbsɪnθ]}}; [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] French: {{IPA|[ap.sɛ̃t]}}) is a [[distillation|distilled]], highly [[ethanol|alcoholic]] (usually 68-80%) beverage  [[anise]]-[[Flavored liquor|flavored spirit]] derived from [[herb]]s including the flowers and leaves of the medicinal plant ''[[Absinth Wormwood|Artemisia absinthium]]'', also called grand [[wormwood]] or [[Absinth wormwood]]. Absinthe is typically green (either naturally or with added color) or clear and is often referred to as ''la Fée Verte'' ('The Green [[Fairy]]'). Although it is sometimes mistakenly called a [[liqueur]], absinthe is not bottled with added [[sugar]] and is therefore classified as a [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] or spirit.<ref>'Traite de la Fabrication de Liqueurs et de la Distillation des Alcools' Duplais (1882 3rd Ed, Pg 249)</ref> Absinthe is uncommon among spirits in that it is bottled at a high proof but consumed diluted with water to the strength of wine (see Drink Preparation/Ritual). 

Absinthe originated in [[Val-de-Travers]], [[Switzerland]] as an [[elixir]]/[[tincture]]. However, it is better known for its popularity in late 19th and early 20th century [[France]], particularly among [[Paris]]ian artists and writers whose romantic associations with the drink still linger in popular culture. At the peak of its popularity, over 2 million litres of absinthe were consumed annually in France alone. <ref> http://www.thujone.info/thujone-absinthe-1.html </ref> Further, absinthe was portrayed as a dangerously [[Addiction|addictive]], [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|psychoactive]] drug; the chemical [[thujone]] was blamed for most of its deleterious effects. The [[Jean Lanfray|Lanfray murders]] of 1906 caused a petition to the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] government leading to its prohibition in [[Switzerland]], and subsequently other countries. By 1915, it was prohibited in a number of European countries and the [[United States]]. 

Though it was vilified, no evidence shows it to be any more dangerous or psychoactive than ordinary alcohol.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Padosch | first = Stephan A. | coauthors = Dirk W.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionarypar|absinthe}}
The French word ''absinthe'' can refer either to the alcoholic beverage or to the actual wormwood plant (''grande absinthe'' being ''[[Absinth Wormwood|Artemisia absinthium]]'', and ''petite absinthe'' being ''[[Artemisia pontica]]''). The word derives from the [[Latin]] ''absinthium'', which is in turn a stylization of the [[Greek language|Greek]] '''αψίνθιον''' (apsínthion), wormwood. Some claim that the word means 'undrinkable' in Greek, but it may instead be linked to the [[Persian language|Persian]] root ''spand'' or ''aspand'', or the variant ''esfand'', which may have been, rather, ''[[Harmal|Peganum harmala]]'', called Syrian Rue although it is not actually a variety of [[rue]], another famously bitter herb. That this particular plant was commonly burned as a protective offering may suggest that its origins lie in the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*spend'', meaning 'to perform a ritual' or 'make an offering'. Whether the word was a borrowing from Persian into Greek, or rather from a common ancestor, is unclear.<ref>[http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/engl/Arte_vul.html#absinthe Absinthe etymology] Retrieved 30 March 2006</ref>

Absinth (without the 'e') is a spelling variation of absinthe often seen in central Europe. Because so many Bohemian-style products use it, many groups see it as synonymous with bohemian absinthe, even though that is not always the case.

==Drink Preparation/Ritual==
[[Image:Preparing absinthe.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Preparing absinthe the traditional way.]]
Traditionally, absinthe is poured into a glass over which a specially designed slotted spoon is placed. A sugar cube is then deposited in the bowl of the spoon.  Ice-cold water is poured or dripped over the sugar until the drink is diluted 3:1 to 5:1. During this process, the components that are not soluble in water, mainly those from anise, fennel and star anise, come out of solution and cloud the drink. The resulting milky [[opalescence]] is called the ''louche'' (''Fr.'' 'opaque' or 'shady', IPA [luʃ]).  The addition of water is important, causing the herbs to 'blossom' and bringing out many of the flavors originally overpowered by the anise. For most people, a good quality absinthe should not require sugar, but it is added according to taste and will also thicken the mouth-feel of the drink.  The major Swiss, French, and Spanish distillers recommend their absinthes without the addition of sugar. 
{{main|Absinthiana}}

Originally a waiter would bring out a dose of absinthe, ice-water in a [[carafe]] and sugar separately and the drinker would prepare his own glass to taste.  With increased popularity, the absinthe fountain, a large jar of ice water on a base with spigots, came into use.  It allowed a number of drinks to be prepared at once, and with a hands-free drip patrons were able to socialise while louching a glass.

Although many bars served absinthe in standard glasses, a number of glasses were specifically made for absinthe, having a dose line, bulge, or bubble in its lower portion to mark how much absinthe should be poured into it; one "dose" of absinthe is around 1 oz (30 ml), and most glasses used this as the standard amount, but some drinkers would use as much as 1 1/2 oz (45 ml).

In addition to being drunk with water poured over sugar, absinthe was a common cocktail ingredient in both Great Britain and the United States<ref>[http://realabsinthe.blogspot.com/2007/05/long-list-of-absinthe-cocktails_30.html List of 104 cocktails including absinthe from the 1930 Savoy Cocktail Book]. The Real Absinthe Blog. Retrieved 11 June 2007.</ref>, and continues to be a popular ingredient today. One of the most famous of these is Hemingway's "Death in the Afternoon" cocktail, a concoction he contributed to a 1935 collection of celebrity recipes.  His directions are as follows: "Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness.  Drink three to five of these slowly." <ref> http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/dining/03curi.html ex=1325480400&en=3fb2c549f0334e97&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss </ref>

==Production==
[[Image:Koehler1887-PimpinellaAnisum.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Anise, one of the three main herbs used in production of absinthe]]
[[Image:Koeh-164.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Grande Wormwood, one of the three main herbs used in production of absinthe]]
[[Image:Koeh-148.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Fennel, one of the three main herbs used in production of absinthe]]
The main herbs used to produce absinthe are green [[anise]], florence [[fennel]] and [[Absinth Wormwood|grande wormwood]], often called the 'holy trinity'. Many other herbs may be used as well, such as [[hyssop]], [[Lemon balm|melissa]], [[star anise]], petite wormwood (''Artemisia pontica'' or Roman wormwood), [[angelica]] root, [[Sweet Flag]], [[dittany]] leaves, [[coriander]], [[veronica (plant)|veronica]], [[juniper]], [[nutmeg]], and various mountain herbs.

The simple [[maceration (wine)|maceration]] of wormwood in alcohol (as called for in absinthe kits) without distillation produces an extremely bitter drink because of the presence of the water-soluble absinthine, one of the most bitter substances known to man. Authentic recipes call for [[distillation]] after a primary maceration and before the optional secondary or 'coloring' maceration. The distillation of wormwood, anise, and Florence fennel first produces a colorless distillate that leaves the [[alembic]] at around 72% [[ethanol|alcohol]]. 

The distillate can be bottled clear, to produce a ''Blanche'' or ''la Bleue'' absinthe, or it can be colored using artificial or natural coloring. Traditionally the natural coloring step is done by [[steeping]] petite wormwood, [[hyssop]], and [[melissa (plant)|melissa]], among other herbs, in the liquid. [[Chlorophyll]] from these herbs give it its famous green color and this green absinthe is known as a ''verte''.  After this process, the resulting product is reduced with water to the desired percentage of alcohol. 

In at least one documented case it can be naturally colored red, called a ''rouge'' or ''rose'', by using a red flower/herb. Since the color is achieved by steeping herbs, it is theoretically possible to create a 'naturally colored' absinthe of any color by using the correct plant material, although only one historical rouge brand has been discovered thus far<ref>http://www.oxygenee.com/absinthe/posters1.html</ref>

Absinthe can also be produced by mixing steam-distilled oils in high-proof alcohol, called an oil-mix.

Historically, most absinthes contain between 60% and 75% alcohol. It is said to improve materially with storage, and many pre-ban distilleries aged their absinthe in neutral barrels before bottling. In the late 19th century, cheap brands of absinthe were occasionally [[Adulterant|adulterated]] by profiteers with [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[indigo plant]], or other [[dye]]s to impart the green color, and with [[antimony trichloride]] to produce or enhance the ''louche'' effect (see below). It is also thought that the use of cheaper industrial alcohol and poor distillation technique by the manufacturers of cheaper brands resulted in contamination with [[methanol]], [[fusel alcohol]], and similar unwanted distillates. This addition of toxic chemicals is likely to have contributed to absinthe's reputation as a hallucination-inducing or otherwise harmful beverage.

===Absinthe kits===
There are numerous recipes for homemade absinthe floating around on the Internet, many of which revolve around soaking or mixing a kit or store-bought herbs and wormwood extract with high-proof liquor such as [[vodka]] or [[Everclear (alcohol)|Everclear]]. Even though these do-it-yourself kits have gained in popularity, it is simply not possible to produce absinthe without distillation. Absinthe distillation, like the production of any fine liquor, requires expertise and care to properly manage.

Besides being unpleasant to drink<ref>[http://wormwoodsociety.org/ABSfaq.html#swill About absinthe kits]</ref> and not authentic distilled absinthe, these homemade concoctions do contain thujone and can sometimes be poisonous, especially when using wormwood extract<ref>[http://www.gumbopages.com/nejm.html Evolution in Action!] Gumbo Pages.  Dangers of drinking wormwood extract.  Retrieved 26 August 2007</ref>. Many of these recipes call for the usage of liberal amounts of wormwood extract or essence of wormwood in the hopes of increasing the believed [[Hallucinogen|psychoactive]] effects. Consuming essential oils will not only fail to produce a high, but can be very dangerous. Wormwood extract can cause [[renal failure]] and death from excessive amounts of [[thujone]], which in large quantities acts as a [[Seizure|convulsive]] [[neurotoxin]]. Essential oil of wormwood should never be consumed straight.

==Absinthe Styles==

Most alcoholic beverages have regulations that govern their classification and labeling. Modern absinthe is not governed in this way and subsequently classification is difficult and by nature inaccurate. Historically, there were five grades of absinthe: ''ordinaire'', ''demi-fine'', ''fine'', ''supérieure'' and ''Suisse'' (which does not denote origin), in order of increasing alcoholic strength and production quality. While a supérieure and Suisse would always be naturally colored and distilled; ordinaire and demi-fine could be artificially colored and made from oil extracts. These terms are no longer used as an industry standard. However some brands in production today still use the ''Suisse'' designation on their labels. Many contemporary absinthe critics use two classifications to denote quality; Distilled and Mix Absinthe. Within these two process based classifications exist substantial variations in production quality due to variations in the raw materials used. They should not be viewed as complete measures of quality. 

===Blanche/la Bleue=== 
Blanche absinthe (also referred to as la Bleue in Switzerland) is bottled directly following distillation and is unaltered. It is a clear liquid which contains the distilled oils of the herbs used in its production. The name la Bleue was originally a term used for bootleg Swiss absinthe. However it has become a popular term for Swiss absinthe in general.

===Verte===
Verte (green in French) absinthe begins as a blanche. The distillate is further altered in process known as the 'coloring step' whereby a new mixture of herbs are left in contact with the clear distillate. This process greatly alters the color and flavor of the drink giving it a characteristic emerald green hue and a heavier more intense flavor. This type of absinthe was most commonly consumed in the 19th century and is what is generally thought of as absinthe. {{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Artificially colored green absinthe is still called a "verte" although it often lacks the additional herbal characteristic that come from the natural coloring step.

===Bohemian style Absinth===
[[Image:Oliva.jpg|thumb|right|225px|'Absinthe Drinker' by [[Viktor Oliva]]]]
Often called Bohemian-style, Czech-style, anise-free absinthe or just absinth (without the 'e'), it is best described as a wormwood bitters and is produced mainly in the [[Czech Republic]] where it gets its [[Bohemian]] and Czech designations, although not all absinthe from the Czech Republic is Bohemian style. <ref name="WSC">[http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/04/26/worthy-of-their-name.php Worthy of their name] The prague post April 26, 2006 Retrieved 20 May 2007</ref> It contains little to no anise, fennel or other herbs normally found in traditional absinthe that was popular in the 19th century, and is often more bitter from chemicals such as absinthine. Often the only similarities with its traditional counterpart are the use of wormwood and a high alcohol content; for all intents and purposes, it should be considered a completely different product.<ref>[http://www.wormwoodsociety.org/czech.html Wormwood society's 'What's Wrong With Czech 'Style' Absinth?']. Retrieved 20 May 2007.</ref> In most cases, Bohemian-style absinths are not processed by distillation, but are rather high-proof alcohol which has been cold-mixed with herbal extracts and artificial coloring.<ref>[http://www.absint.net/absinth About L'Or absinth] How L'or's bohemian style absinth is made Retrieved 20 May 2007</ref>

Contemporary Czech producers claim absinth has been produced in the Czech Republic since the 1920s<ref>[http://www.hillsabsinth.com/history-thennow.htm Hills absinth history] History of Hills absinth. Retrieved 20 May 2007.</ref>, but there is no independent evidence to support these claims.<ref name="WSC"/> Since there are currently few legal definitions for absinthe, producers have taken advantage of its romantic 19th century associations and psychoactive reputation to market their products under a similar name. Many Bohemian-style producers heavily market thujone content<ref>[http://www.absinthesupply.net/products/zele-premium.html Zele absinth] A thujone content beyond EU regulations. Retrieved 20 May 2007.</ref>, exploiting the many myths and half truths that surround thujone even though none of these types of absinth appear to contain enough thujone to cause any noticeable effect.

Bohemian-style absinth lacks many of the oils in absinthe that create the louche <ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070315212417/http://www.lafeeabsinthe.com/acatalog/lafeeabsinthbohemian.htm La Fee bohemian description] Bohemian absinth doesn't louche (internet archive) Retrieved 31 August 2007.</ref>, and a modern ritual involving fire is often used that takes this into account. In this ritual, absinth is added to a glass and a sugar cube on a spoon is placed over it. The sugar cube is soaked in absinth then set on fire. The cube is then dropped into the absinth setting it on fire, and water is added until the fire goes out, normally a 1:1 ratio.<ref>[http://www.lafeeabsinthe.com/bohemian.php Fire ritual] Demonstration of the fire ritual. Retrieved 20 May 2007.</ref> The crumbling sugar can provide a minor simulation of the louche seen in traditional absinthe, and the lower water ratio enhances effects of the high-strength alcohol.

It is sometimes claimed that this ritual is old and traditional; however, there is no evidence to support this. It was first included in marketing after being observed in a prague bar in the late 1990s<ref>[http://www.feeverte.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=2880&st=0&p=100509&entry100509 Origin of the fire ritual] Alan Moss explains the origins of the Czech ritual at Feeverte.net Retrieved 11 May 2006</ref> and incorporated into its history as the classic method, which has been accepted by many as historical fact, largely because this method has filtered its way into several contemporary movies <ref>Ex. The flaming scene in [[From hell]]</ref>. Amongst many of the more traditional absinthe enthusiasts, this method of preparing absinthe is looked down upon, and it can negatively affect the flavor of traditional absinthe. <ref>[http://www.feeverte.net/faq-absinthe.html Fee Verte FAQ] 19.

There is no historical basis for a thujone level this high.

==Storage==
Absinthe that is artificially colored or clear is relatively stable and can be bottled in a clear container. However if naturally colored absinthe is exposed to light, the chlorophyll breaks down, changing the color from emerald green to yellow green to brown. Pre-ban and vintage absinthes are often of a distinct amber color as a result of this process. Though this color is considered a mark of maturity with vintage absinthes it is regarded as an undesirable change when dealing with contemporary absinthe. Due to this fragility naturally colored absinthe is typically bottled in dark UV resistant wine bottles. 

Absinthe should be stored in a cool, room temperature, dry place away from light and heat.  They should also be kept out of the refrigerator and freezer as anethole can crystalize inside the bottle, creating a 'scum' in the bottle which may or may not dissolve back into solution as the bottle warms.  When properly stored, absinthes not only maintain their quality but many actually improve in aroma, flavor, and complexity as they age.

==History==

[[Image:Pernodad.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A vintage [[Pernod Fils]] absinthe advertisement.]]
The precise origin of absinthe is unclear. The medical use of wormwood dates back to ancient Egypt and is mentioned in the [[Ebers Papyrus]], circa 1550 BCE. Wormwood extracts and wine-soaked wormwood leaves were used as remedies by the ancient Greeks.<ref>[http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/1/1/14 Absinthism: a fictitious 19th century syndrome with present impact] Retrieved 20 November 2006</ref> The first clear evidence of absinthe in the modern sense of a distilled spirit containing green anise and fennel, however, dates to the 18th century but may be older.  According to popular legend, absinthe began as an all-purpose patent [[remedy]] created by Dr. Pierre Ordinaire, a French doctor living in [[Couvet]], [[Switzerland]], around 1792 (the exact date varies by account). Ordinaire's recipe was passed on to the Henriod sisters of Couvet, who sold absinthe as a medicinal [[Tincture|elixir]]. In fact, by other accounts, the Henriod sisters may have already been making the elixir before Ordinaire's arrival. In either case, one Major Dubied in turn acquired the formula from the sisters and, in 1797, with his son Marcellin and son-in-law Henry-Louis Pernod, opened the first absinthe distillery, Dubied Père et Fils, in Couvet. In 1805 they built a second distillery in [[Pontarlier|Pontarlier, France]], under the new company name Maison Pernod Fils.<ref>[http://www.oxygenee.com/absinthe-faq/faq3.html 'Oxygénée's Absinthe History & FAQ III'] Retrieved 16 September 2006</ref>

Absinthe's popularity grew steadily until the 1840s, when absinthe was given to French troops as a [[malaria]] treatment [http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-04-07/news/behind-the-green-door/print]. When the troops returned home, they brought their taste for absinthe with them, and it became popular at [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] and [[Bistro|bistros]].

By the 1860s, absinthe had become so popular that in most [[Cafe|cafés]] and [[Cabaret|cabarets]], 5 p.m. signaled ''l’heure verte'' ('the green hour'). Still, it remained expensive and was favored mainly by the [[bourgeoisie]] and eccentric Bohemian artists. By the 1880s, however, the price had dropped significantly, the market expanded, and absinthe soon became ''the'' drink of France; by 1910 the French were consuming 36 million [[liter|litres]] of absinthe per year.

Absinthe (with anise) has been consumed in [[Czech lands]] (then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]) since at least 1888, notably by Czech artists, some of whom had an affinity for France, frequenting [[Prague]]'s Cafe Slavia.<ref>[http://www.reflex.cz/Clanek13219.html Cafe Slavia]</ref> Its wider appeal is uncertain, though it was sold in many shops in and around Prague.  There is evidence that at least one local liquor distillery in Bohemia was making absinthe at the turn of the 20th century.<ref>[http://www.olivaabsinth.com/history-of-absinthe-buy-absinthe-pg-11.html 'Oliva Absinth's History of Absinthe page'] Retrieved 16 March 2007</ref>

===Ban===
Spurred by the [[temperance movement]] and wine makers' associations, absinthe was publicized in connection with several violent crimes supposedly committed under the influence of the drink. This, combined with rising hard-liquor consumption caused by the [[Phylloxera|wine shortage in France]] during the 1880s and 1890s, effectively labeled absinthe a social menace.

Its critics said that <blockquote>
Absinthe makes you crazy and criminal, provokes epilepsy and tuberculosis, and has killed thousands of French people. It makes a ferocious beast of man, a martyr of woman, and a degenerate of the infant, it disorganizes and ruins the family and menaces the future of the country.
</blockquote><ref>Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). 

Absinthe History in a Bottle. Chronicle books. ISBN 0-8118-1650-8 Pg. 116</ref> [[Edgar Degas]]' 1876 painting [[L'Absinthe]] (''Absinthe'') (now at the [[Musée d'Orsay]]) epitomized the popular view of absinthe 'addicts' as sodden and benumbed.  Although he mentioned it only once by name, [[Émile Zola]] described their serious intoxication in his novel ''[[L'Assommoir]]''.  

<blockquote>Boche had known a joiner who had stripped himself stark naked in the rue Saint-Martin and died doing the polka—he was an absinthe-drinker. (page 411 of the 1970 Penguin Classics English edition)</blockquote>

In 1905, it was reported that a man named [[Jean Lanfray]] murdered his family and attempted to kill himself after drinking absinthe. The fact that he was an alcoholic who had drank considerably after the two glasses of absinthe in the morning was overlooked, and the murders were blamed solely on absinthe.<ref>Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). Absinthe History in a Bottle. Chronicle books. ISBN 0-8118-1650-8 Pg. 1–4</ref> The Lanfray murders were the last straw, and a petition to ban absinthe in Switzerland was quickly signed by over 82,000 people.

Soon thereafter (in 1906), [[Belgium]] and [[Brazil]] banned the sale and redistribution of absinthe, although they were not the first. Absinthe was banned as early as 1898 in the [[Congo Free State]] (later Belgian Congo).<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/27/wbdrink_ed3_.php Fans of absinthe party like it's 1899] International Herald Tribune. Retrieved 19 January 2007</ref> In [[Switzerland]], the prohibition of absinthe was even written into the constitution in 1907, following a popular initiative. [[The Netherlands]] came next, banning absinthe in 1909, followed by the United States in 1912 and [[France]] in 1915. Around the same time, [[Australia]] banned the liquor too.<!--Exact date unknown. should be added if found.--> The prohibition of absinthe in France led to the growing popularity of ''[[pastis]]'' and ''[[ouzo]]'', anise-flavored liqueurs that do not use wormwood. Pernod moved their absinthe production to [[Catalonia]] [[Spain]] [http://www.avenuevine.com/archives/2007_07.html], where absinthe was still legal,[http://www.feeverte.net/guide/historic-absinthe-brands/pernod_fils_tarragona_circa_19/] slow sales in the 1960s eventually caused it to close down.  However, a few small micro distilleries still exist in the area [http://www.absinthebuyersguide.com/Articles/finespirits_peterverte.html]. In Switzerland, it drove absinthe underground. Evidence suggests small home clandestine distillers have been producing absinthe since the ban, focusing on [[Les Blanches]] or [[Les Bleues]] as it was easier to pretend at that time that a clear product was not absinthe. Many countries never banned absinthe, notably the United Kingdom (where absinthe had not been as popular as in mainland Europe), which eventually led to its revival.

===Modern revival===
[[Image:Modern-absinthe-bottles.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Modern absinthe.  Left Vertes, middle blanches, right Bohemian-style, with a prepared glass in front of each.]]
In the 1990s an importer, [[George Rowley (entrepreneur)|BBH Spirits]], realized that there was no [[United Kingdom|UK]] law prohibiting the sale of absinthe (as it was never banned there) other than the standard regulations governing [[alcoholic beverage]]s. [[Hill's Liquere]], a [[Czech Republic]] distillery founded in 1920, began manufacturing Hill's Absinth, a Bohemian-style absinth, which sparked a modern resurgence in absinthe's popularity.

It had also never been banned in [[Spain]] or [[Portugal]], where it continues to be made. Likewise, the former Spanish and Portuguese New World colonies, especially [[Mexico]], allow the sale of absinthe and it has retained popularity through the years.

France never repealed its 1915 law, but in 1988 a law was passed to clarify that only beverages that do not comply with [[European Union]] regulations with respect to [[thujone]] content, or beverages that call themselves 'absinthe' explicitly, fall under that law. This has resulted in the re-emergence of French absinthes, now labeled ''spiritueux à base de plantes d'absinthe'' ('wormwood-based spirits'). Interestingly, as the 1915 law regulates only the sale of absinthe in France but not its production, many manufacturers also produce variants destined for export which are plainly labeled 'absinthe'. [[La Fée Absinthe]], released in 2000, was the first brand of absinthe distilled and bottled in France since the 1915 ban, initially mainly for export from France, but now one of over twenty French 'spiritueux ... d'absinthe' available in Paris and other French cities.

Absinthe has never been totally illegal to import or manufacture in Australia. Importation requires a permit under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation 1956 due to a restriction on importing any product containing "oil of wormwood".<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_reg/cir1956432/sch8.html Schedule 8] ''[[Commonwealth of Australia]]'' [[Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956]] [[Schedule 8]].

[[Belgium]], as part of an effort to simplify its laws, removed its absinthe law on [[1 January]] [[2005]], citing (as did the Dutch judge) European food regulations as sufficient to render the law unnecessary (and indeed, in conflict with the spirit of the Single European Market).

In Switzerland, the constitutional ban on absinthe was repealed in 2000 during a general overhaul of the national constitution, but the prohibition was written into ordinary law instead. Later that law was also repealed, so from [[1 March]] [[2005]], absinthe is again legal in its country of origin, after nearly a century of prohibition. Absinthe is now not only sold in Switzerland, but is once again distilled in its [[Val-de-Travers (district)|Val-de-Travers]] birthplace, with [[Kübler Absinthe|Kübler]] and [[La Clandestine Absinthe]] among the first new brands to emerge, albeit with an underground heritage.

It is once again legal to produce and sell absinthe in practically every country where alcohol is legal, the major exception being the United States. It is not, however, illegal to possess or consume absinthe in the United States.

===''Hausgemacht'' absinthe===
German for home-made (often abbreviated HG), also called clandestine (not to be confused with the brand), hausgemacht absinthe is home distilled by hobbyists. Mainly for personal use and not for sale, clandestine absinthe is produced in small quantities allowing experienced distillers to select the best herbs and fine tune each batch. Clandestine production got a major boost after the ban of absinthe when small producers went underground, especially in Switzerland. Although the Swiss produced both vertes and blanches before the ban, clear absinthe (known as La Bleue) became popular as it was easier to hide. Though the Swiss ban was recently lifted, many clandestine distillers have yet to become legal; the authorities believe high taxes on alcohol and the mystique of being underground has kept many from seeking a license.<ref>[http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/swissinfo.html?siteSect=107&sid=6586791&cKey=1143621269000 Absinthe bootleggers refuse to go straight]. Swiss info. Retrieved 11 May 2006.</ref> Those that have become legal often still use the 'clandestine' moniker on their products. HG absinthe should not be confused with absinthe kits.

===Cruise ship mystery===
In January 2006, a widely published [[Associated Press]] [[wire service]] article echoed the press' sensational absinthe scare of a century earlier. It was reported that on the night he disappeared, [[George Allen Smith]] (a [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], man who in July 2005 vanished from aboard the [[Royal Caribbean]]'s ''[[Brilliance of the Seas]]'' while on his [[honeymoon]] cruise) and other passengers drank a bottle of absinthe. The story noted the modern revival and included quotes from various sources suggesting that absinthe remains a serious and dangerous hallucinogenic drug:
<blockquote>
"In large amounts, it would certainly make people see strange things and behave in a strange manner," said Jad Adams, author of the book 'Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle'. "It gives people different, unusual ideas that they wouldn't have had of their own accord because of its stimulative effect on the mind."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Absinthe is banned in the United States because of harmful neurological effects caused by a toxic chemical called thujone," said Michael Herndon, spokesman for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration<ref>Christoffersen, John. [http://www.greenwichtime.com/news/scn-sa-ct-cruise.1.23jan23,0,1307244.story 'Banned liquor latest twist in cruise disappearance'].

''Boston Globe'', 22 January 2006. Two slightly different edits of the same Associated Press wire service story. Retrieved 5 March 2006.</ref>
</blockquote>
The story also noted: "Defenders of the drink say it is safe and its harmful effects a myth." Jad Adams and [[Jade Liqueurs|Ted Breaux]] were interviewed on [[MSNBC]] about this issue. Ted Breaux had this to say:
<blockquote>
One thing we know is that absinthe, old and new, does not contain a lot of [[thujone]]. And what we know, from certain scientific studies, which have been published in the past year or so, is that, first of all, thujone is not present in any absinthe in sufficient concentration to cause any type of deleterious effects in humans.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11007598/ "'Rita Cosby Live & Direct' for [[23 January]]" (transcript)]. MSNBC, 23 January 2006. Retrieved 5 March 2006.</ref>
</blockquote>
As with sensationalism a hundred years ago, the fact that a bottle of absinthe contains more alcohol than that of standard liquor was ignored.

==Controversy==
[[Image:Edouard Manet 001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Edouard Manet]], ''The Absinthe Drinker'']]
It was thought that excessive absinthe drinking had worse effects than those associated with overindulgence in other forms of alcohol, which was bound to be true for those consuming cheaper adulterated products, and led to the disease of 'absinthism'.  One of the first vilifications of Absinthe was an 1864 experiment in which Dr. Magnan exposed a guinea pig to large doses of pure wormwood oil vapor and another to alcohol vapors. The guinea pig exposed to wormwood had seizures while the other did not.  He would later blame the chemical [[thujone]] for these effects. Based on this he concluded absinthe was more dangerous than alcohol, disregarding the small amounts of wormwood oil likely to be consumed by drinkers.<ref>Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). Absinthe History in a Bottle. Chronicle books. ISBN 0-8118-1650-8 Pg. 101</ref>

Past reports estimated thujone levels in absinthe as high — up to 350 mg per kg of absinthe. More recent studies have shown that very little of the thujone present in wormwood actually makes it into a properly distilled absinthe, even one recreated using historical recipes and methods. Most proper absinthes, both vintage and modern, are within the current EU limits.<ref>Hutton, Ian. [http://www.absintheonline.com/myth_reality_absinthe.pdf Myth, Reality and Absinthe]</ref><ref>[http://www.emmert-analytik.de/DLR_100_9_S352-356.pdf Determination of a/ß Thujone and Related Terpenes in Absinthe using Solid Phase Extraction and Gas Chromatography]. Retrieved 5 March 2006.</ref> A recent French distiller has had to add pure [[essential oil]] of wormwood to make a 'high thujone' variant of his product. It can remain in higher amounts in oils produced by other methods than distillation, or when wormwood is macerated and not distilled, especially when the plant stems are used, where thujone content is the highest. Tests on mice show an [[LD50]] of around 45 mg thujone per kg of body weight,<ref name="thujone">[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/8/3826 Thujone Gamma-Aminobutyric acid type A receptor modulation and metabolic detoxification.] Hold K., Sirisoma N., Ikeda T., Narahashi T. and Casida J.

The deleterious effects of absinthe as well as its hallucinogenic properties are a persistent myth often repeated without support in modern books and scientific journals.

===Effects===
Absinthe has long been believed to be hallucinogenic, but no evidence supports this.  Ten years after Dr. Magnan's experiments with wormwood oil, he studied 250 cases of alcoholism and claimed that those who drank absinthe were worse off than those who just drank alcohol, and that they experienced, among other things, rapidly brought-on hallucinations.<ref>[http://www.thujone.info/thujone-absinthe-13.html The Lancet 1874, ON THE COMPARATIVE ACTION OF ALCOHOL AND ABSINTHE] By Dr. Magnan Retrieved 29 November 2006</ref>  Few descriptions of these hallucinations exist from actual absinthe drinkers beyond a few quotes from poets after a long night of drinking.  In one of the most famous, [[Oscar Wilde]] describes the feeling of tulips on his legs after leaving a bar at closing.<ref>Baker, Phil; (2001). The Book of Absinthe a Cultural History. Grove Press books. ISBN 0-8021-3993-0 Pg. 32</ref> These beliefs got a boost in the 1970s when a scientific paper mistakenly reported [[thujone]] was related to [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] and most likely had similar hallucinogenic properties based on its shape.<ref name="thc">Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). Absinthe History in a Bottle. Chronicle books. ISBN 0-8118-1650-8 Pg. 152</ref>  With the advent of usenet and web recipes 'trip reports' have been circulating for many years. These home recipes sometimes call for known hallucinogenic herbs in a mistaken attempt to recreate Absinthe's supposed hallucinogenic effects.

Today it is known that absinthe does not cause hallucinations, especially those described in the old studies.  Thujone, the supposed active chemical in absinthe, is a GABA antagonist and while it can produce muscle spasms in large doses there is no evidence it causes hallucinations.

The effects of absinthe have been described by artists as mind opening and even [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] and by prohibitionists as turning "good people" "mad and desolate". Sometimes called 'secondary effects', the most commonly reported experience is a 'clear-headed' feeling of inebriation - a 'lucid drunkenness', said to be caused by the thujone and other compounds.  Some, such as chemist/absinthe historian Ted Breaux, say that these effects may be caused by the fact that some of the compounds act as stimulants, others as sedatives, overall creating a neutral effect.<ref>[http://wired-vig.wired.com/wired/archive/13.11/absinthe.html The Mystery of the Green Menace - Wired Magazine (see page 3 of article)]</ref>  Most others feel that the [[placebo effect]] and individual reaction to the herbs make these secondary effects subjective and minor compared to the [[psychoactive]] effects of alcohol.

A study in the ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol''<ref>[http://alcoholstudies.rutgers.edu/journal/september04/abstract.shtml Absinthe: Attention Performance and Mood under the Influence of Thujone] Journal of Studies on Alcohol, DETTLING, A. et al. Retrieved 21 May 2006.</ref> concluded that a high concentration of thujone in alcohol has negative effects on attention performance. It slowed down [[reaction time]], and subjects concentrated their attention in the central field of vision. Medium doses did not produce an effect noticeably different from plain alcohol. The high dose of thujone in this study was larger than what one can get from current beyond-EU-regulation 'high thujone' absinthe before becoming too drunk to notice, and while the effects of even this high dose were statistically significant in a double blind test, the test subjects themselves could still not reliably identify which samples were the ones containing thujone. As most people describe the effects of absinthe as a more lucid and aware drunk, this suggests that thujone alone is not the cause of these effects.

==Cultural impact==
{{main|Absinthe in popular culture}}
[[Image:Absinthe.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|''[[L’Absinthe]]'', by [[Edgar Degas]].]]
The legacy of absinthe as a mysterious, addictive, and mind-altering drink continues to this day. Absinthe has been seen or featured in fine art, movies, video, music and literature. The modern absinthe revival has had an effect on its portrayal. It is often shown as an unnaturally glowing green liquid which is set on fire before drinking, even though traditionally neither is true.  In addition, it is most commonly known in the media for over the top hallucinations.

===Historical===
Numerous artists and writers living in France during the late 19th and early 20th centuries were noted absinthe drinkers and featured absinthe in their works. These include [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Paul Verlaine]]. Later authors and artists would draw from this cultural well including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]].

===Modern===
The mystery and illicit quality surrounding the popular view of absinthe has played into modern music, movies and television shows. These depictions vary in their authenticity, often applying [[dramatic license]] to depict the drink as everything from [[aphrodisiac]] to [[poison]].

==Regulations==
Currently, most countries do not have a legal definition of absinthe (unlike, for example, [[Scotch whisky]] or [[cognac (spirit)|cognac]]). Therefore, manufacturers can label a product 'absinthe' or 'absinth', regardless of whether it matches the traditional definition. Due to many countries never banning absinthe, not every country has regulations specifically governing it.

===Australia and New Zealand===
[[Bitters]] can contain a maximum 35 mg/kg thujone, other alcoholic beverages can contain a maximum 10 mg/kg<ref>[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/fsc_1_4_1_Contaminants_v78.pdf Standard 1.4.1 Contaminants and Natural Toxicants.] Food Standards Australia New Zealand. Retrieved 25 May 2006.</ref> of thujone. In Australia, import and sales require a special permit although absinthe is readily available in many [[bottle shop]]s.

Absinthe containing wormwood cannot be sent through the Australian postal system. There is an unresolved question as to whether it is permitted in passenger's luggage on arrival in Australia in non-commercial quantities for personal use.  While the legislation would appear to be clear, it is currently stocked by duty-free alcohol retailers at 'Arrivals' at Australian international airports such as Kingsford Smith.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], liquor laws are under the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. [[British Columbia]] has no limits on thujone content, although several associations are petitioning for bans{{Fact|date=August 2007}}; [[Alberta]], [[Ontario]] and [[Nova Scotia]] allow 10 mg/kg thujone; [[Québec]] allows 15 mg per kg (according to the [[SAQ]]){{Fact|date=April 2007}}; and all other provinces do not allow the sale of absinthe containing thujone (although, in [[Saskatchewan]], one can purchase any liquor available in the world upon the purchase of a minimum of one case, usually 12 bottles x 750 ml or 8 x 1L). The individual liquor boards must approve each product before it may be sold on shelves, and currently, only Hill's Absinth, Czech Absinth s.r.o., Elie-Arnaud Denoix, Pernod, Absente, Versinthe and, in limited release, La Fée Absinthe are approved. Other brands may appear in the future.

===European Union===
The [[European Union]] permits a maximum thujone level of 10 mg/kg in alcoholic beverages with more than 25% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]], and 35 mg/kg in alcohol labeled as bitters.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out162_en.pdf Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on Thujone], European Commission. SCF/CS/FLAV/flavor/23 ADD2 Final [[6 February]] [[2003]].</ref> Member countries regulate absinthe production within this framework. Sale of absinthe is permitted in all EU countries unless they further regulate it.
[[Image:Affiche absinthe.jpg|thumb|200px|''The end of the Green Fairy'' (1910): Critical poster by [[Albert Gantner]] illustrating the absinthe ban in Switzerland.]]

===France===
In addition to EU standards, products explicitly called 'absinthe' cannot be sold in France, although they can be produced for export. Absinthe is now commonly labeled as ''spiritueux à base de plantes d'absinthe'' ('wormwood-based spirits'). France also regulates [[fenchone]], a chemical in the herb [[fennel]], to 5 mg/l.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/ADHJA.htm Décret n°88-1024 du 2 novembre 1988]. Retrieved 5 March 2006.</ref> This makes many brands of Swiss absinthe illegal without reformulation.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, the sale and production of absinthe was prohibited from 1908 to 2005; however, the ban was lifted on March 1, 2005.  To be legally made or sold in Switzerland, absinthe must be distilled and either uncolored or naturally colored.

===United States===
According to [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] literature, "The importation of Absinthe and any other liquors or liqueurs that contain ''Artemisia absinthium'' is prohibited."<ref>[http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/vacation/kbyg/prohibited_restricted.xml#AbsintheAlcohol Prohibited and Restricted Items]. US Customs and Border Protection. Retrieved 5 March 2006.</ref> This runs contrary to FDA regulations, which allow Artemisia species in foods or beverages, but those that contain Artemisia species, white cedar, oak moss, tansy or Yarrow, must be thujone free.<ref>[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/FCF172.html Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Chapter 1, Part 172 - Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food for Human Consumption]. US Food and Drug Administration. Retrieved 5 March 2006.</ref> Other herbs that contain [[thujone]] have no restrictions. For example, sage and sage oil (which can be almost 50% thujone<ref name="sage oil"/>) are on the FDA's list of substances generally recognized as safe.<ref>[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fcf182.html Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Chapter 1, Part 182 - Substances Generally Recognized as Safe]. US Food and Drug Administration. Retrieved 5 March 2006.</ref>

The prevailing consensus of interpretation of [[law of the United States|United States law]] and regulations among American absinthe connoisseurs is that it is probably legal to purchase such a product for personal use in the U.S. It is prohibited to sell items meant for human consumption which contain thujone derived from ''Artemisia'' species. (This derives from a [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulation, as opposed to a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] regulation.) Customs regulations specifically forbid the importation of 'absinthe'. Absinthe can be and occasionally is seized by United States Customs if it appears to be for human consumption and can be seized inside the U.S. with a warrant.<ref>[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode19/usc_sec_19_00001595----000-.html US CODE: Title 19,1595.

So will I get arrested for possession of absinthe in the U.S.?" Retrieved 12 May 2006.</ref>

A faux-absinthe liquor called [[Absente]], made with ''southern wormwood'' (''[[Artemisia abrotanum]]'') instead of grande wormwood (''[[Artemisia absinthium]]''), is sold legally in the United States and does not contain Grande Wormwood.  This was the first US approval referring to "absinthe" on the front label; the front label says "Absinthe Refined" but TTB classified the product as Liqueur.

[[Malört]], a wormwood-based liqueur, has been sold legally in Chicago for more than 70 years.  The makers of Malört, however, state that the variety of wormwood they use contains no thujone.

In 2004 [[Kübler Absinthe]] secured US formula approval for an authentic absinthe made in [[Val-de-Travers]], [[Switzerland]], with thujone.<ref>{{cite web

It took three more years to get the label approved and bring Kubler to the US, because it contains Artemesia absinthium and thujone.
