[[Image:WoW_Flying_Gnomes.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An image from ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', one of the largest commercial MMORPGs as of 2006, based on active subscriptions.<ref>[http://mmogchart.com/Chart1.html Chart from MMOGchart.com]</ref>]]
'''''MMORPGs''''' ('''Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game''') is a genre of [[online game|online]] [[computer role-playing game]]s (RPGs) in which a large number of [[player (game)|players]] interact with one another in a [[virtual world]]. As in all [[role-playing game|RPGs]], players assume the role of a [[fictional character]] (most commonly in a fantasy setting) and take control over many of that character's actions. MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player RPGs by the number of players, and by the game's [[persistent world]], usually hosted by the game's [[video game publisher|publisher]], which continues to exist and evolve while the player is away from the game.

MMORPGs are very popular throughout the world, with combined global memberships in subscription and non-subscription games exceeding 15 million as of 2006.<ref name="subscribers">Chart of Subscriber Growth, http://www.mmogchart.com</ref>  Overall, revenues for MMORPGs exceeded half a billion dollars in 2005 and are expected to reach over a billion dollars by 2009.<ref name="revenue">Parks Associates (2005), Online Gaming Revenues to Triple by 2009 http://www.parksassociates.com/press/press_releases/2005/gaming-1.html</ref>

<!--Please do not squeeze in a mention of your favorite MMORPG in this section. If it is a notable product or part of history, please add it to a later, appropriate section-->

== Common features ==
Though MMORPGs have evolved considerably, many of them share some basic characteristics.

* Traditional ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' style gameplay, including [[quest (gaming)|quests]], [[Mob (computer gaming)|monsters]], and [[Looting (gaming)|loot]].
* A system for character development, usually involving levels and [[experience points]].
* An [[economy]], based on the trade of items such as weapons and armor, and a regular currency.
* [[Clan (computer gaming)|Guilds or clans]], which are organizations of players, whether or not the game actively supports them.
* Game Moderators or Game Masters (frequently abbreviated to GM), which are sometimes-compensated individuals who attempt to supervise the world.
* A client-server model, in which the "world" software runs continuously on a server, and players connect to it via client software.
* Large communities of players, and [[social network]]s.

The majority of popular MMORPGs require players to either purchase the client software for a one-time fee or pay a monthly subscription to play. Most major MMORPGs require players to do both. By nature, "massively multiplayer" games are always online, and require some sort of continuous revenue (such as monthly subscriptions and advertisements) for maintenance and development.  Games that feature massively-multiplayer functionality, but do not include roleplaying elements, are referred to as [[MMOG]]s.

== History ==
The term "MMORPG" emerged in 1996 after [[Trip Hawkins]] frequently made use of the term "massively multiplayer" when explaining early graphical products to the media.<ref>Kent, Steven (September 23, 2003), GameSpy, "Alternate Reality: The history of massively multiplayer online games", http://archive.gamespy.com/amdmmog/week1/</ref> Although MMORPGs as defined today have only existed since the early 1990s, their history begins as early as the late 1970s.

=== The first gameworlds ===
[[Image:MUDscreen.jpg|thumb|260px|right|[[MUD]], the world's oldest multi-user roleplaying game]]
The beginning of the MMORPG genre can be traced to text-based (entirely non-graphical) [[MUD]]s, with the first being developed by [[Richard Bartle]] and [[Roy Trubshaw]] in 1978.  These games ran on private servers, usually at a university, and sometimes without the knowledge of the system's administrators. Players would typically connect to the games using a [[TELNET]] client, and gameplay was similar to [[role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.  By typing commands into a parser, players would enter a dungeon, fight monsters, gain experience, and acquire loot.<ref>[[Richard Bartle|Bartle, Richard A.]] (2003). ''Designing Virtual Worlds''. Indianapolis: New Riders. ISBN 0-13-101816-7.</ref>

Similar games quickly surfaced during that period for the [[PLATO]] System.  MUDs (and later their descendants such as [[MUSH]]es and [[MOO]]s) were sometimes wildly different from one another, but shared many basic interface elements. An example of this would be a player's means of navigating  his or her character around the gameworld by typing in compass directions ("n", "se", etc.).

Many MUDs are still active and a number of influential MMORPG designers, such as [[Raph Koster]], [[Brad McQuaid]], [[Mark Jacobs (video game designer)|Mark Jacobs]], [[Brian Green (game developer)|Brian "Psychochild" Green]] and [[Damion Schubert]], began as MUD developers and/or players.

=== Early commercial development===

<!-- Please DO NOT ADD a game to the history section unless you intend to assert notability AND provide a source to support its release dates and/or other assertions. -->

The first commercial MMORPG (although what constitutes "massive" requires qualification when discussing mid-1980s [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]s) was ''[[Islands of Kesmai]]'' designed by [[Kelton Flinn]] and John Taylor. Still text-based (or, more accurately, [[roguelike]]), this game became available to consumers in [[1984]] for $12.00 per hour via the [[CompuServe]] online service.<ref name="Online World Timeline">Koster, Raph (2002) "Online World Timeline," http://www.raphkoster.com/gaming/mudtimeline.shtml</ref>

The first graphical character-based interactive environment, though not actually an RPG, was ''[[Club Caribe]]''.  Although first released as ''[[Habitat (video game)|Habitat]]'' in 1988, Club Caribe was introduced by [[LucasArts]] for [[Quantum Link|Q-Link]] customers on their [[Commodore 64]] computers. Users could interact with one another, chat and exchange items.<ref>Ferrell, Keith. (November 1987), "The Future Of Computer Games: Ten Industry Leaders Speak Out," http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue90/Future_Of_Computer_Games.php". [[COMPUTE!]]</ref> Although very basic, its use of online [[Avatar (icon)|avatars]] (already well established off-line by [[Ultima]] and other games) and combining [[chat]] and graphics was revolutionary. 

[[Image:NeverwinterNightsAOL.gif|thumb|260px|right|''Neverwinter Nights'' on AOL, the first graphical MMORPG.]]
The first graphical MMORPG was ''[[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|Neverwinter Nights]]'' by designer [[Don Daglow]] and programmer [[Cathryn Mataga]] (not to be confused with ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' by [[BioWare]]). "Neverwinter Nights" went live on AOL for [[Personal computer|PC]] owners in 1991 and ran through 1997. This project was personally championed and green-lighted by AOL President [[Steve Case]]. Both ''Club Caribe'' and ''Neverwinter Nights'' cost $6.00 per hour to play.

During the early-[[1990s]], commercial use of the internet was limited by [[NSFNET]] acceptable use policies.  Consequently, early online games like ''[[Legends of Future Past]]'', ''Neverwinter Nights'', ''[[GemStone IV|GemStone III]]'', ''[[Dragon's Gate]]'', and ''[[Federation II]]'' relied heavily on proprietary services such as [[CompuServe]], [[America Online]], and [[GEnie]] for distribution.  

Following ''Neverwinter Nights'' was ''[[The Shadow of Yserbius]]'', a MMORPG on [[The Sierra Network]] (TSN), which ran from 1992 through 1996. The game was produced by [[Joe Ybarra]]. ''The Shadow of Yserbius'' was an hourly service, although it also offered unlimited service for $119.99 per month, until [[AT&T]] acquired TSN and rendered it strictly an hourly service. The name was then changed from TSN to the [[ImagiNation Network]].

=== Commercial MMORPGs on the Internet ===
[[Image:UOPlayerInteraction.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Players interacting in ''[[Ultima Online]]''.]]
As [[NSFNET]] restrictions were relaxed, traditional game companies and online services began deploying games on the [[internet]]. The first commercial text-based MMORPG to make this transition to the Internet from a proprietary network provider (CompuServe, in this case) was ''[[Legends of Future Past]]'', designed by [[Jon Radoff]] and Angela Bull.  The game utilized a staff of professional [[Game Master]]s who conducted online events, and was originally offered at $6.00 per hour in 1992.<ref name="1992pricing">Lombardi, Chris (1992) "Legends in their Own Minds," Computer Gaming World, http://static.filefront.com/cgw/1992_08_issue97.pdf</ref>

Access to the Internet, forming a global playerbase, caused game companies to grow in popularity and accumulate truly massive numbers.  With this global access to paying customers, there also came a surge in profitability for game companies.

In 1995, Starwave Corporation (an early internet company funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen) launched [[Castle Infinity]].  It was a fully graphic side-scrolling world with persistent visitors and events.  Players would create their own 3-piece avatars called "SCHTICK Figures" which stood for 'Simplified Character Heuristic Technology Integrating Cartoon Kinematics.'  Just a few months into its commercial launch, Starwave was acquired by the Disney Corporation.  Disney made an exploratory effort to transform the project into "Castle Hercules" based on the current major animated feature.  Ultimately, the Castle Infinity project was abandoned.  However, there have been several attempts to salvage it, and the entire online world is still free and available to this day.

''[[Meridian 59]]'', launched  by [[The 3DO Company|3DO]] in late 1996, was one of the first Internet MMORPGs.  It was the first Internet game from a major publisher, the first to be covered in the major game magazines, and the first to introduce the flat monthly subscription fee. Most significantly, however, and another first for online RPGs, was its [[Game engine|3D engine]], allowing players to experience the game world through the eyes of their characters. A cult following quickly grew for ''Meridian 59'' that still exists today.

''[[The Realm Online]]'' was another successful early Internet MMORPG, launched by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra Online]]. Although released just after ''Meridian 59'', the [[Development stage|beta]] was active several months before.  ''The Realm Online'' had fully animated 2D graphics, both in and out of combat situations, which made it accessible to a wider audience compared to more text-based games or the graphical MUDs on which it was based.  Also, its gameplay and interface were already familiar to those accustomed to the graphical adventure games earlier popularised by Sierra.  Like many of its predecessors, ''The Realm Online'' only featured simple turn-based combat, however, it did feature a huge number (for the time) of visual character customization options.  It, too, is still running.

''[[Ultima Online]]'', released in September 1997, is now credited with popularizing the genre.<ref>[http://pc.ign.com/objects/850/850380.html Article from IGN.com]</ref> It featured 3D [[isometric]]/third-person graphics, and was set in the already popular ''Ultima'' universe.  It was also a more involved, complex game than many of its predecessors.

Meanwhile, commercial online gaming was becoming extraordinarily popular in [[South Korea]]. ''[[Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds]]'', designed by [[Jake Song]], was commercially released in 1996 and eventually gained over one million subscribers. Song's next game, ''[[Lineage (computer game)|Lineage]]'' ([[1998]]), enjoyed even greater success gaining millions of subscribers in Korea and [[Taiwan]].  This helped to secure developer [[NCsoft]]'s dominance in the global MMORPG market for several years.<!--This would be a good place to throw 1 or 2 sentences listing NCSoft's other MMORPG achievements and the years they went live-->

[[Image:EverQuest - The Temple of Solusek Ro.jpg|thumb|260px|left|''[[EverQuest]]'' drove MMORPGs into the Western mainstream.]]

''[[EverQuest]]'', launched in March [[1999]] by Verant Interactive (later acquired by [[Sony Online Entertainment]]), brought fantasy MMORPGs into the Western mainstream. It was the most commercially successful MMORPG in the [[United States]] for five years, and was the basis for 13 expansions (as of February 2007) and several [[EverQuest universe|derivative games]].  In 1999, following ''Ultima Online'' and ''EverQuest'', was another hit, ''[[Asheron's Call]]''. Together, these three games are sometimes referred to as the original "big three" of the late 1990s.

=== Second-generation Commercial MMORPGs ===
By the turn of the century, game companies were eager to capitalize on the new market.  The concept of [[massively multiplayer online game]]s expanded into new [[video game genre]]s around this time, though RPGs, with their ability to "suck in" the player, were (and still are) the most financially promising.

The next generation of MMORPGs, following the "big three" of the previous decade, was to include the medieval [[player versus player|PvP]]-oriented ''[[Dark Age of Camelot]]'', the sci-fi ''[[Anarchy Online]]'', and ''[[Ultima Worlds Online: Origin|Ultima Online 2]]''. ''Anarchy Online'', released first in June 2001, was saddled with crippling technical problems upon its release, mostly due to an inability to handle the huge playerbase.  ''Dark Age of Camelot'' launched smoothly four months later, introducing "Realm vs. Realm" [[player versus player|PvP]] and other innovations, but still never attained the media attention or fame garnered by the previous "big three", which were still running strongly.  ''Ultima Online 2'' was cancelled by [[Electronic Arts]] in March 2001, as they had decided that the market was becoming saturated and that it would be more profitable to divert resources to the original ''Ultima Online''.
Runescape by Jagex was also released in 2001.

Other producers thought otherwise, and dozens of new MMORPGs were developed in the new millennium.

[[Image:ffxi_birdnm_fight.jpg|thumb|260px|right|''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', the first MMO to allow console and PC gamers to play together]]
In 2002, ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' was released, which hoped to bring in fans of the extremely popular (but mostly single-player) ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, which was particularly popular in Japan.  Like the previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, this one was playable on a console, using a handheld controller, though it bore little resemblance to gameplay in prior Final Fantasy titles. Though not the first MMORPG played on a console (which was ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]''<ref>Tony Peters (2006), ''AceGamez,'' "Phantasy Star Universe Preview Microsoft Xbox 360," http://www.acegamez.co.uk/reviews_x360/Phantasy_Star_Universe_Preview_X360.htm</ref>), it was the first to allow console and PC users to play together.<ref>{{cite web |author =Adams, David| title=Final Fantasy XI Hits Subscriber Milestone| publisher=IGN.com | year=January 7, 2004 | url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/449/449458p1.html|accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref>  It was also notable for randomly selecting servers for new player-characters (instead of letting players pick for themselves), a practice which was highly criticized, but resulted in game worlds in which players would regularly interact with both English and Japanese speakers.  The game persists as one of the leading MMORPGs on the market to date.

Also released in 2002 was the sprite-based MMO ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'', produced by Korean company [[Gravity Corp]].  Unknown to many Western players, the game took Asia by storm as ''Lineage'' had done.  The publisher has claimed in excess of 25 million subscribers of the game, although this number is based upon a quantity of registered users (rather than active subscribers, as typically used by Western game publishers).<ref>Michael Kanellos (2004), "Gaming their Way to Growth," [http://news.com.com/Consumers+Gaming+their+way+to+growth+-+Part+3+of+South+Koreas+Digital+Dynasty/2009-1040_3-5239555.html CNET News]</ref>

May 2003 saw the release of ''[[Eve Online]]'', produced by [[Crowd Control Productions]], which had players taking the role of spaceship pilots and had gameplay similar to the series ''[[Star Control]]''.  Though not the first space MMORPG (''[[DarkSpace]]'' was released in 2001), ''Eve'' was able to achieve lasting success.  One of the reasons for its success may have been the game's design, in which all subscribers play in one unshared universe as a result the natural partitioning of the game universe into solar systems connected by stargates. This partitioning allows the world to be divided up in such a way that one or more solar systems run on different servers,while still maintaining a single coherent world.

In October 2003, ''[[Lineage II]]'' (NCsoft's sequel to ''Lineage'') became the latest MMORPG to achieve huge success across Asia. It received the Presidential Award at the 2003 Korean Game awards, and is now the second most popular MMORPG in the world. As of the first half of 2005 Lineage II counted over 2.25 million subscribers worldwide, with servers in Japan, China, North America, Taiwan, and Europe, once the popularity of the game had surged in the West.

In April 2004, NCSoft produced another significant title, ''[[City of Heroes]]''.  Though it introduced no major innovations in gameplay, it featured an extreme number of possible visual character appearances, and its comic-book [[superhero]] theme made it stand out.

===Modern MMORPGs===
[[Image:Horderaid.jpg|thumb|260px|right|''World of WarCraft'' is currently the most-widely played commercial MMORPG on the market. Here, a group of Horde-factioned players can be seen riding their mounts, preparing for a large raid against the Alliance.]]
The most recent generation of MMORPGs, based on arbitrary standards of graphics, gameplay, and popularity, is said to have launched in November 2004 with [[Sony Online Entertainment]]'s ''[[EverQuest II]]'' and [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard Entertainment's]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' (WoW).  At the time, Sony expected to dominate the market, based on the success of the first ''Everquest'', and decided to offer a flat monthly rate to play all of their MMORPGs including ''EverQuest'', ''EverQuest II'', and ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', to keep from competing with itself.  However, ''World of Warcraft'' immediately overtook all of these games upon release, and indeed became so popular that it dwarfed all previous monthly-fee MMORPGs. At present, [[World of Warcraft|''WoW'']] is one of the most played games in North America, and the most played MMORPG worldwide, with a total of over 8 million customers. With the release of these newer games, subscriptions began to decline for many older MMORPGs, even the year-old ''[[Lineage II]]'', and in particular ''Everquest 1''.  The current MMORPG market has World of Warcraft in a position similar to the position of [[Dungeons & Dragons]] in the tabletop RPG market, with both games' market share being greater than 50% of the overall market. 

In April 2005, [[ArenaNet]] (a subsidiary of NCSoft) successfully launched ''[[Guild Wars]]'', introducing a new financial model which might have been partly responsible for the game's success.  Though definitely an online RPG, and technically having a persistent world (despite most of the game's content being [[instance dungeon|instanced]]), it required only a one-time purchasing fee.  It was also designed to be "winnable", more or less, as developers wouldn't profit from customers' prolonged playtime.  Other differences compared to traditional MMORPGs included strictly PvP-only areas, a relatively short playtime requirement to access end-game content, instant world travel, and strategic PvP.  For these differences it was termed instead a "Competitive/Cooperative Online Role-Playing Game" ([[CORPG]]) by its developers, and is now seen by some as occupying a new niche in the MMORPG market.  With three million games purchased as of  December '06,<ref>[http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3155878 News story from 1up.com]</ref> Guild Wars is still continuously profitable (due to several [[Expansion pack|expansions]]) and can be seen as a serious competitor to WoW.

Finally, there has been significant competition (and potential for profit) among free-to-play MMORPGs.  Two of the most successful of these are ''[[Silkroad Online]]'', by the publisher [[Joymax]], and [[MapleStory]] by [[Wizet]].  Both of these games are by Korean publishers and generate revenue by selling in-game "enhancements", and due to their free nature have accumulated huge numbers of registered accounts over the years, with a majority of them from East Asia.  Another good example is the [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based ''[[RuneScape]]'', developed by British developer [[Jagex]], which allows for players to sign up for a member's account for extra content, in addition to the ad-supported free accounts.

== Economics of MMORPGs ==
{{see also|Real-money trading}}
Many MMORPGs feature living economies, as virtual items and currency have to be gained through play and have definite value for players.  Such a [[virtual economy]] can be analyzed (using data logged by the game) and has value in economic research; more significantly, these "virtual" economies can have an impact on the economies of the real world.

One of the early researchers of MMORPG was Edward Castronova, who demonstrated that a supply-and-demand market exists for virtual items and that it crosses over with the real world.<ref name="poo">Castronova, Edward. Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games. ISBN 0-226-09626-2, University Of Chicago Press</ref>  This crossover has some requirements of the game:

* The ability for players to sell an item to each other for in-game (virtual) currency.
* Bartering for items between players for items of similar value.
* The purchase of in-game items for real-world currency.
* Exchanges of real-world currencies for virtual currencies.

The idea of attaching real-world value to "virtual" items has had a profound effect on players and the game industry, and even the courts.  Castronova's first study in 2002 found that a highly liquid (if illegal) currency market existed, with the value of the in-game currency exceeding that of the Japanese yen.<ref name="CurrencyExchange">Online Game Economies Get Real (2002), http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,55982,00.html</ref>  Some people even make a living by working these virtual economies; these people are often referred to as [[gold farmers]], and may be employed in [[game sweatshop]]s.

Game publishers usually prohibit the exchange of real-world money for virtual goods. However, a number of products actively promote the idea of linking (and directly profiting from) an exchange.  Some players of [[Second Life]] have generated revenues in excess of $100,000.<ref name="SecondLifeEconomy">My Virtual Life, Business Week (May 1, 2006) http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982001.htm</ref>

However, in the case of ''[[Entropia Universe]]'',  the virtual economy and the real-world economy are directly linked.  This means that real money can be deposited for game money and vice versa.  Real-world items has also been sold for game money in Entropia.<ref name="EntropiaUniverseEconomy"> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropia_universe#Partnerships</ref>

Some of the issues confronting online economies include:

* The use of "bots" or automated programs, that assist some players in accumulating in-game wealth to the disadvantage of other players.<ref name="bots">Robert Shapiro (2003), How online games teach us about economics, http://www.slate.com/id/2078053/</ref>
* The use of unsanctioned auction sites, which has led publishers to seek legal remedies to prevent their use based on intellectual-property claims.<ref name="stopauctions">Blizzard Goes to War, http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2004/12/blizzard_goes_t.html</ref>
* The emergence of [[virtual crime]], which can take the form of both fraud against the player or publisher of an online, and even real-life acts of violence stemming from in-game transactions.<ref>BBC News (2005), Game Theft led to Fatal Attack, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4397159.stm</ref>

===Private servers===
One reaction to the virtual economies has been the phenomena of "private servers," which are servers operated by individuals and groups who have reverse-engineered commercial MMORPG products.  Anyone who sets up their own private server has complete control over the virtual world existing on that server.  Typically, these servers operate in violation of publisher's end-user license agreements.  In November 2006, [[NCSoft]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] shutdown a prominent private ''Lineage II'' server that had claimed 50,000 active users.<ref name="fbi">FBI, NCSoft drop hammer on MMORPG pirates, http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061120-8258.html</ref>

Private servers are mostly run by volunteers, and most of them are free. However, some private servers may wish for people to donate money, sometimes in exchange for a bonus in the game. Private servers remain markedly less popular than the official servers, with player numbers usually in the hundreds, though popular private servers may reach up to one or two thousand online players and even up to ten thousand in terms of player registrations. ''[[EQEmu]]'' is a server emulator for ''[[EverQuest]]''; others exist for ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[Lineage II]]'', ''[[Ultima Online]]'', ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'', and many other MMORPGs.

== Psychology of MMORPGs ==

Since the interactions between MMORPG players are real, even if the environments are not, [[psychologist]]s and [[sociologist]]s are also able to use MMORPGs as tools for academic research.

[[Sherry Turkle]], a clinical psychologist, has conducted interviews with computer users including game-players.  Turkle found that many people have expanded their emotional range by exploring the many different roles (including gender identities) that MMORPGs allow a person to explore.<ref name="turkle">Sherry Turkle (1997), Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet, ISBN 0-684-83348-4</ref>

[http://www.nickyee.com/ Nick Yee], a Ph.D student, has surveyed more than 35,000 MMORPG players over the past few years, focusing on psychological and sociological aspects of these games. His research can be found at [http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus The Daedalus Project].  Recent findings included that 15% of players become a guild-leader at one time or another, but most generally find the job tough and thankless;<ref name="yee1">Nick Yee (2006), Life as a Guild Leader, http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001516.php</ref> and that players spend a considerable amount of time (often a third of their total time investment) doing things that are directly-related to, but outside of the game itself.<ref name="yee2">Nick Yee (2006) Time Spent in the Meta Game, http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001535.php</ref>

Many players report that the emotions they feel while playing an MMORPG are very strong, to the extent that 8.7% of male and 23.2% of female players in a statistical study had had an [[online wedding]].<ref>Yee (2003), An Ethnography of MMORPG Weddings, http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/000467.php</ref>

Other researchers have found that the enjoyment of a game is directly related to the social organization of a game, ranging from brief encounters between players to highly organized play in structured groups.<ref name="nardi harris">Nardi, Harris (2006), Strangers and Friends: Collaborative Play in World of Warcraft, Proceedings of the 2006 20th anniversary conference on Computer supported cooperative work</ref>

Also, [[Richard Bartle]] has classified multiplayer RPG-players into four primary psychological [http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm groups].  His classifications were then expanded upon by Erwin Andreasen, who developed the concept into the thirty-question [[Bartle Test]] that helps players determine which category they are associated with.  With over 200,000 test responses as of 2006, this is perhaps the largest ongoing survey of multiplayer game players.<ref name="bartletest">Bartle Test of Gamer Psychology, http://www.guildcafe.com/bartle.php</ref> 

== Developing MMORPGs ==

In general, the cost of developing a commercial MMORPG title exceeds ten million dollars.<ref name="devcost">Adam Carpenter (2003), Applying Risk-Based Analysis to Play Balance RPGs, Gamasutra, http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20030611/carpenter_01.shtml</ref>  These projects require multiple disciplines within  software engineering, art design and network infrastructure:

* The front-end (or client) component of a commercial, modern MMORPG features 3D graphics.  As with other modern 3D games, the front-end requires expertise with implementing [[3D engine]]s, real-time [[shader]] techniques and physics simulation.  The actual visual content (areas, creatures, characters, weapons, spaceships and so forth) is developed by artists who typically begin with two-dimensional concept art, and later convert these concepts into animated 3D scenes, models and texture maps.<ref name="3d game design">Frank Luna (2006), "3D Game Programming with DirectX 9.0c, a Shader Approach," Worldware Publishing, ISBN 1-59822-016-0</ref>

* Developing an MMOG server requires expertise with client/server architecture, network protocols, security and relational database design.  MMORPGs include reliable systems for a number of vital tasks.  The server must be able to handle and verify a large number of connections; prevent [[Cheating in online games|cheating]]; and apply changes (bug fixes or added content) to the game.  A system for recording the game's data at regular intervals, without stopping the game, is also important.<ref name="game server">Jay Lee (2003), Gamasutra, Relational Database Guidelines for MMOGs, http://www.gamasutra.com/resource_guide/20030916/lee_01.shtml</ref>

* Maintenance requires sufficient [[Server (computing)|server]]s and [[bandwidth]], and a dedicated support staff.  Insufficient resources for maintenance lead to [[lag]] and frustration for the players, and can severely damage the reputation of a game, especially at launch.  Care must also be taken to ensure that player population remains at an acceptable level by adding or removing servers ("shards").  [[Peer-to-peer]] MMORPGs could theoretically work cheaply and efficiently in regulating server load, but practical issues such as asymmetrical network bandwidth and CPU-hungry rendering engines make them a difficult proposition. Additionally, they would probably become vulnerable to other problems including new possibilities for [[cheating in online games|cheating]].  The hosted infrastructure for a commercial-grade MMORPG requires the deployment of hundreds (or even thousands) of servers.  Developing an affordable infrastructure for an online game requires developers to scale to large numbers of players with less hardware and network investment.<ref name="architecture">GDC Proceedings 2005, Online Game Architecture: Back-End Strategies, http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050310/esbensen_01.shtml</ref>

* If a MMORPG is to remain profitable in the long run, a developer should be prepared to continue to devote resources to it.  This is so for two reasons: first, players will demand new content to keep the game exciting, and second, players will always be developing new ways to cheat which need to be dealt with.

* In addition, the team will need to have expertise with the fundamentals of game design: world-building, lore and game mechanics,<ref name="game fundamentals">Chris Crawford (2003), Chris Crawford on Game Design, New Riders Games, ISBN 0-13-146099-4</ref> as well as what makes games fun.<ref name="fun games">Koster and Wright (2004), "A Theory of Fun for Game Design," Paraglyph Press, ISBN 1-932111-97-2</ref>

===Current trends in MMORPGs===
As there are a number of wildly different titles within the genre, and since the genre develops so rapidly, it is difficult to definitively state that the genre is heading in one direction or another.  Still, there are a few obvious developments.

One of these developments is the raid group quest, or "raid",<ref name="raid trend"> http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/1028</ref> which is an adventure designed for large groups of players (often twenty or more).

Another is the use of [[instance dungeons]].<ref name="instance trend"> http://www.blogtimesherald.com/entertainment/index.php?ArticleID=40&ShowMore=NO</ref>  These are game areas that are "copied" for individual groups, which keeps that group separated from the rest of the game world.  This reduces competition, and also has the effect of reducing the amount of data that needs to be sent to and from the server, which reduces lag.  ''World of Warcraft'''s "raids", mentioned above, are often instance dungeons, as are all of the combat areas in ''Guild Wars''.

Increased amounts of "Player-created content" may be another trend.  Some non-combat-based MMORPGs do already rely heavily on player-created content, including everything from simple animations to complete buildings using player-created textures and architecture.  Examples of these games include [[Second Life]] and [[A Tale in the Desert]].  However, these games are very different from the far more popular "standard" MMORPGs revolving around combat and limited character tradeskills.  Player-created content in these games would be in the form of areas to explore, monsters to kill, quests to carry out and specific in-game items to obtain. [[The Saga of Ryzom]] was the first of these "standard" MMORPGs to offer players the ability to create this type of content.  Again, whether or not this becomes mainstream is anyone's guess.

The production of movie "tie-in" games, common in other video game genres, may also begin to appear more frequently in MMORPGs.  The most recent example of this is ''[[The Matrix Online]]'', based on the Matrix trilogy of films; the earliest possibly was ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''.  Neither of these titles was a great financial success, probably due to their divergence from the original property. In addition to movie-license MMORPGs, there may be games produced on licenses from television; for example, ''[[Stargate Worlds]]'', based on the popular [[Stargate SG-1]] and [[Stargate Atlantis]] television series, is currently under development.  The process is also apparently being applied in reverse, with [[James Cameron]] designing a MMORPG that will ''precede'' a film (''[[Project 880]]'') it is tied to.<ref name="Cameron">James Cameron's Game Theory, Business Week (Feb. 13, 2006) http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_07/b3971073.htm</ref>

Free content is also a popular trend in MMORPGs.  ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and ''[[EVE Online]]'' both incorporated a free trial to the game, while others, like ''[[Anarchy Online]]'' and ''[[Shadowbane]]'', became completely free and available to download.

Another popular trend that has shown great presence in MMORPGs is "player-driven" gameplay.  Player-driven gameplay relies on the players themselves for events and wars.  In this kind of setting, the NPCs or game world is affected by the players instead of the game company.  A great example of a player-driven MMORPG is ''[[Shadowbane]]'', where quests, and dungeons are non-existent in the world.  Shadowbane also relies on the players to wage war on other nations, rather than having the game company decide the war.

===Independent development===
[[Image:Daimonin Stoneglow night indexedto256.png|thumb|260px|right|''[[Daimonin]]'' is one of the independent efforts to create a free MMORPG.]]

Many small teams of programmers and artists have tried to create their own MMORPGs. As shown above, the average MMORPG development project requires enormous investments of time and money, and running the game can be a long-term commitment.  Independent development, or game development not run by any company, is therefore less common than corporate development.  Still, many independent MMORPGs do exist, representing a wide spectrum of genres, gameplay types, and revenue systems.

Some of the best-established independent projects are ''[[RuneScape]]'', ''[[AWplanet]]'', ''[[Crossfire (computer game)|Crossfire]]'', ''[[Daimonin]]'', ''[[Endless Online]]'', ''[[Star Wars Combine]]'', ''[[Eternal Lands]]'', ''[[Dream Blue Online]]'' and ''[[PlaneShift (game)|Planeshift]]''. Some independent MMORPG projects are completely [[open source]], such as ''[[Daimonin]]'', while others like ''Planeshift'' feature proprietary content made with an open-source game engine. The developers of ''Endless Online'' have also released [http://www.endless-online.com/information.html development information] with details about their coding.

The [[WorldForge]] project has been active since 1998 and formed a community of independent developers who are working on creating framework for a number of open-source MMORPGs.  The [[Multiverse Network]] is also creating a network and platform specifically for independent MMOG developers.

===Browser-based MMORPGs===

{{seealso|List of text-based MMORPGs}}

[[Image:LotGD.png|right|thumb|200px|''[[Legend of the Green Dragon]]'' is an example of a text-based MMORPG accessible with a web browser.]]

With the success of the MMORPG genre in recent years, several multiplayer games played in [[web browser]]s have also begun using the MMORPG moniker. This [[browser game]] sub-genre developed from old [[bulletin board system|BBS]] games and pre-dates the modern idea of an MMORPG. Browser-based MMORPGs are usually simpler games than their stand-alone counterparts, typically involving turn-based play and simple strategies (e.g. "build a large army, then attack other players for gold"), though there are many interesting variations on the popular themes to be found. Many browser-based MMORPGs are more like [[Turn-based MMORPG|turn-based]] [[strategy game]]s or [[wargame]]s than [[role-playing game]]s.

One of the earliest examples of a browser-based MMORPG is ''[[Archmage (computer game)|Archmage]]'', which dates back to early [[1999]]. More recently, faster computers and the [[Java platform|Java]] programming language have allowed the introduction of graphical browser-based MMORPGs such as ''[[RuneScape]]'', which are more similar to standalone MMORPGs.  Adobe's Flash Player 8 also provides functionality for a full function MMORPG such as [[Horse Isle RPG|Horse Isle]] and [[Dofus]]. Macromedia's introduction of Shockwave 3D and the MUS Multiuser Server in 2001 makes it possible to create 3D browser-based MMORPGs based on the Shockwave plug-in.
