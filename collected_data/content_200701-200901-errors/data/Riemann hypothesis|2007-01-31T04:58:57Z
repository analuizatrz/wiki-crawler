{{unsolved|mathematics|Is the [[real part]] of a non-trivial [[root (mathematics)|zero]] of the [[Riemann zeta function]] always &frac12;?}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''Riemann hypothesis''' (also called the '''Riemann zeta-hypothesis'''), first formulated by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1859, is one of the most famous unsolved problems. It has been an open question for well over a century, despite attracting concentrated efforts from many outstanding mathematicians. Unlike some other celebrated problems, it is more attractive to professionals in the field than to amateurs.

The Riemann hypothesis is a [[conjecture]] about the distribution of the [[Root (mathematics)|zero]]s of the [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann zeta-function]] &zeta;(''s''). The Riemann zeta-function is defined for all [[complex number]]s ''s'' &ne; 1. It has zeros at the negative even integers (i.e. at ''s'' = &minus;2, ''s'' = &minus;4, ''s'' = &minus;6, ...). These are called the '''trivial zeros'''. The Riemann hypothesis is concerned with the non-trivial zeros, and states that:

:The real part of any non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is &frac12;.

Thus the non-trivial zeros should lie on the so-called '''critical line''' &frac12; + ''it'' with ''t'' a [[real number]] and ''i'' the [[imaginary number|imaginary unit]]. The Riemann 
zeta-function along the critical line is sometimes studied in terms of the [[Z function|Z-function]], whose real zeros correspond to the zeros of the zeta-function on the critical line.

The Riemann hypothesis is one of the most important open problems of contemporary mathematics; a $1,000,000 prize has been offered by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] for the first correct proof. Most mathematicians believe the Riemann hypothesis to be true. ([[J. E. Littlewood]] and [[Atle Selberg]] have been reported as skeptical. Selberg's skepticism, if any, waned, from his young days. In a 1989 paper, he suggested that an analogue should hold for a much wider class of functions, the [[Selberg class]].)

==History==
Riemann mentioned the conjecture that became known as the Riemann hypothesis in his 1859 paper ''[[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude]]'', but as it was not essential to his central purpose in that paper, he did not attempt a proof. Riemann knew that the non-trivial zeros of the zeta-function were symmetrically distributed about the line ''s'' = ½ + ''it'', and he knew that all of its non-trivial zeros must lie in the range 0 ≤ Re(''s'') ≤ 1.

In 1896, [[Jacques Hadamard|Hadamard]] and [[de la Vallée-Poussin]] independently proved that no zeros could lie on the line Re(''s'') = 1. Together with the other properties of non-trivial zeros proved by Riemann, this showed that all non-trivial zeros must lie in the interior of the critical strip 0 < Re(''s'') < 1. This was a key step in the first complete proofs of the [[prime number theorem]].

In 1900, [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] included the Riemann hypothesis in his famous list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems]] — it is part of Problem 8 in Hilbert's list, along with the [[Goldbach conjecture]]. When asked what he would do if awakened after having slept for five hundred years, Hilbert famously said his first question would be whether the Riemann hypothesis had been proven (Derbyshire 2003:197; Sabbagh 2003:69; Bollobas 1986:16).  The Riemann Hypothesis is the only one of Hilbert's problems on the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] Millennium prize problems. 

In 1914, [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] proved that an infinite number of  zeros lie on the critical line Re(''s'') = ½. However, it was still possible that an infinite number (and possibly the majority) of non-trivial zeros could lie elsewhere in the critical strip. [[critical line theorem|Later work]] by Hardy and [[J.E. Littlewood|Littlewood]] in 1921 and by Selberg in 1942 gave estimates for the average density of zeros on the critical line.

Recent work has focused on the explicit calculation of the locations of large numbers of zeros (in the hope of finding a counterexample) and placing upper bounds on the proportion of zeros that can lie away from the critical line (in the hope of reducing this to zero).

==The Riemann hypothesis and primes==
The traditional formulation of the Riemann hypothesis obscures somewhat the true importance of the conjecture. The zeta-function has a deep connection to the distribution of [[prime number]]s and [[Helge von Koch]] proved in 1901 that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the following considerable strengthening of the [[prime number theorem]]: there exists a constant ''C'' such that

:<math>\left|\pi(x) - \int_2^x \frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\ln(t)}\right|\leq C\,\sqrt x\,\ln(x)</math>  

for  all  sufficiently large ''x'', where &pi;(''x'') is the [[Prime counting function|prime-counting function]], and ln(''x'') is the [[natural logarithm]] of ''x''. By a strengthening due to [[Lowell Schoenfeld]], we may take ''C'' = 1/(8&pi;) for all ''x'' &ge; 2657.

The zeros of the Riemann zeta-function and the prime numbers satisfy a certain duality property, known as the [[explicit formulae]], which shows that in the language of [[Fourier analysis]] the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function can be regarded as the [[harmonic frequencies]] in the distribution of primes.

The Riemann hypothesis can be generalized by replacing the Riemann zeta-function by the formally similar, but much more general, global [[L-function]]s. 
In this broader setting, one expects the non-trivial zeros of the global ''L''-functions to have real part 1/2, and this is called the 
[[generalized Riemann hypothesis]] (GRH).  It is ''this conjecture'', rather than the classical Riemann hypothesis only for the single Riemann zeta-function, which accounts for the true importance of the Riemann hypothesis in mathematics.  In other words, the importance of 'the Riemann hypothesis' in mathematics today really stems from the importance of the generalized Riemann hypothesis, but it is simpler to refer to the Riemann hypothesis only in its original special case when describing the problem to people outside of mathematics. 

For many global ''L''-functions of [[function field]]s (but not [[number field]]s), the Riemann hypothesis has been proven.  For instance, the fact that the [[quadratic Gauss sum|Gauss sum]], of the quadratic character of a finite field of size ''q'' (with ''q'' odd), has absolute value 

:&radic;''q''

is actually an instance of the Riemann hypothesis in the function field setting.

==Consequences and equivalent formulations of the Riemann hypothesis==
The practical uses of the Riemann hypothesis include many propositions which
are stated to be true under the Riemann hypothesis, and some which can be
shown to be equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.
One is the rate of growth in the error term of the prime number theorem given above.

===Growth rate of Möbius function===
One formulation involves the [[Möbius function]] &mu;.  The statement that the equation

:<math>\frac{1}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}</math>

is valid for every ''s'' with real part greater than &frac12;, with the sum on the right hand side converging, is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. From this we can also conclude that if the [[Mertens function]] is defined by

:<math>M(x) = \sum_{n \le x} \mu(n)</math> 

then the claim that 

:<math>M(x) = O(x^e) \,</math> 

for every exponent 

:''e'' > &frac12; 

is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. This puts a rather tight bound on the growth of ''M'', since even with no hypothesis we can conclude 

:<math>M(x) \ne o(x^\frac{1}{2})</math> 

(For the meaning of these symbols, see [[Big O notation]].)

===Berry Conjecture===

Berry (1999) proposed the Hamiltonian operator H=xp so 

:<math> \hat H =-i\hbar \Big( x \frac{\partial}{\partial x} +1/2 \Big) </math> 

so 

:<math> \zeta (1/2+i\hat H)\, |\Phi \rangle =0 </math>

===Growth rates of multiplicative functions===
The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to certain conjectures about the rate of growth of other [[multiplicative function]]s aside from &mu;(''n''). For instance, if &sigma;(''n'') is the [[divisor function]], given by 

:<math>\sigma(n) = \sum_{d\mid n} d </math>

then 

:<math>\sigma(n) < e^\gamma n \ln \ln n \,</math>

for  ''n'' > 5040. This is known as [[Robin's theorem]] and was given by [[Guy Robin]] in 1984. A related bound was given by [[Jeffrey Lagarias]] in 2002, who proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that 

:<math> \sigma(n) \le H_n + \ln(H_n)e^{H_n}</math>

for every [[natural number]] ''n'', where <math>H_n</math> is the [[harmonic number]].

Other functions, such as the [[Riesz function]], have conjectured rates of growth equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis as well.

===Relation to Farey sequence===
Two other equivalent statements to the Riemann hypothesis involve the [[Farey sequence]]. If ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> is the Farey sequence of order ''n'', beginning with 1/''n'' and up to 1/1, then the claim that

:<math>\sum_{i=1}^m|F_n(i) - i/m| = O(n^e)</math>

is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. Here <math>m = \sum_{i=1}^n\phi(i)</math> is the number of terms in the Farey sequence of order ''n'', and e>&frac12;. Similarly, equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis is
:<math>\sum_{i=1}^m(F_n(i) - i/m)^2 = O(n^e),</math>
where now 

:''e'' > &minus;1.

===Relation to group theory===
The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to certain conjectures of [[group theory]]. For instance, if ''g''(''n'') is the maximal order of elements of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> of degree ''n'', known as [[Landau's function]], then the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the bound, for all ''n'' greater than some ''M'', of

:<math>\ln g(n) < \sqrt{\operatorname{Li}^{-1}(n)}.</math>

===Critical line theorem===
The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that <math>\zeta'(s)</math>, the derivative of <math>\zeta(s)</math>, has no zeros in the strip 

:<math>0 < \Re(s) < \frac12</math>. 

That &zeta; has only simple zeros on the critical line is equivalent to its derivative having no zeros on the critical line, so under the usual hypotheses on the Riemann zeta-function we can extend the zero-free region to <math>0 < \Re(s) \le \frac12</math>. This approach has been fruitful; refining it allowed [[Norman Levinson]] to prove his strengthening of the [[critical line theorem]].

===Li's criterion===
[[Li's criterion]] is a statement that the positivity of a certain sequence of numbers is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.

===Disproven conjectures===
Stronger conjectures than the Riemann hypothesis have also been formulated, but they have a tendency to be disproven. [[Paul Turan]] showed that if the sums 

:<math>\sum_{n=1}^M n^{-s}</math> 

have no zeros when the real part of ''s'' is greater than one then the Riemann hypothesis is true, but Hugh Montgomery showed the premise is false. Another stronger conjecture, the [[Mertens conjecture]], has also been disproven.

===Lindelöf hypothesis===
The Riemann hypothesis has various weaker consequences as well; one is the '''Lindelöf hypothesis''' on the rate of growth of the zeta function on the critical line, which says that, for any ''e'' > 0,

:<math>\zeta\left(\frac12 + it\right) = O(t^e),</math>

as ''t'' tends to infinity.

Denoting by ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> the ''n''-th prime number, a result by [[Albert Ingham]], shows that the Lindelöf hypothesis implies that, for any ''e'' > 0,

:''p''<sub>''n+1''</sub> - ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> < ''p''<sup>1/2+''e'',</sup>

if ''n'' is [[sufficiently large]]. However, this result is worse than that of the large prime gap conjecture, stated below.

===Large prime gap conjecture===
Another conjecture is the large prime gap conjecture. [[Harald Cramér|Cramér]] proved that,
assuming the Riemann hypothesis, the [[prime gap|gap]] between the prime ''p'' and its successor is <math>O(\sqrt{p} \ln p)</math>. On average, the gap is
merely <math>O(\ln p)</math> and numerical evidence does not suggest it
can grow nearly as fast as the Riemann hypothesis seems to allow, much less
as fast as the best that can at present be shown without it.

==Attempted proofs of the Riemann hypothesis==	 
Several teams of mathematicians have addressed RH over decades, and a few purported proofs go unverified [[as of 2006]]. However, these have been received with scepticism by the mathematical community, and professionals at large do not believe them to be true. Matthew R. Watkins from the [[University of Exeter]] has a compilation of such claims (serious and ludicrous alike)[http://secamlocal.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/zeta/RHproofs.htm].

==Possible connection with operator theory==
{{main|Hilbert-Pólya conjecture}}

It has long been speculated that the ''correct'' way to derive the Riemann hypothesis has been to find a [[self-adjoint operator]], from the existence of which the statement on the real parts of the zeroes of &zeta;(''s'') would follow when one applies the criterion on real [[eigenvalue]]s. This has led to many investigations; but has not yet proven fruitful.

Amazingly using V. Mangoldt formula and Semiclassical approach we reach to the conclusion that if H (Hermitian operator) exists then  :

1)  :<math> \sum_{n}e^{iu E_{n}}=Z(u)=e^{u/2}-e^{-u/2} \frac{d\psi _{0}}{du}-\frac{e^{u/2}}{e^{3u}-e^{u}}=Tr(e^{iu\hat H }) </math>

(Trace formula for the exponential of H )

2) Iff H is a Hamiltonian so H=T+V then the potential Must satisfy the constraint:

:<math> \frac{Z(u)u^{1/2}}{\sqrt \pi }\sim \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dxe^{i (uV(x)+ \pi /4 )} </math>

for further reference see [[Chebyshev function]] article, and the section dedicated to Riemann Hypothesis.

==Searching for ζ-function zeroes==
[[Image:Riemann zeta function absolute value.png|thumb|250px|Absolute value of the ζ-function]]
There is a long history of computational attempts to explore as many zeroes of the ζ-function as possible. One notable such attempt was [[ZetaGrid]], a [[distributed computing]] project, which checked over a billion zeros a day when it was running. The project was shut down in November 2005 however. [[As of 2006]], no computational project has succeeded in finding a counterexample to the Riemann hypothesis.

In 2004, [[Xavier Gourdon]] and [[Patrick Demichel]] verified the Riemann hypothesis through the first ten trillion non-trivial zeros using the [[Odlyzko-Schönhage algorithm]].

[[Michael Rubinstein]] has made public an [http://pmmac03.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mrubinst/l_function_public/CODE/ algorithm] for generating the zeros.
