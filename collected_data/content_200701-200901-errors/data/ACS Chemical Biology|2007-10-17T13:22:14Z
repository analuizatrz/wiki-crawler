'''''ACS Chemical Biology''''' is a [[peer-review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] published since [[2006]] by the [[American Chemical Society]]. The aim of ''ACS Chemical Biology'' is to disseminate significant original research at the interface between [[chemistry]] and [[biology]]. In doing so, the scope of ''ACS Chemical Biology'' spans the rapidly-emerging field known as [[chemical biology]]. ''ACS Chemical Biology'' is available in both printed and online versions and is indexed in a number of [[database|databases]] including [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], the [[Institute for Scientific Information|ISI's]] [[Web of Knowledge]] database, and the U.S. [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] [[MEDLINE]] database.<ref>{{cite journal

==Types of content==
''ACS Chemical Biology'' publishes [[Scientific_journal#Types_of_articles|research letters]], [[Scientific_journal#Types_of_articles|articles]], and [[Scientific_journal#Types_of_articles|reviews]] that are all peer-reviewed. In addition, specially commissioned articles that describe journal content are solicited. Letters describe findings of broad interest and are generally five printed pages or shorter in length. Articles, on the other hand, are comprehensive reports of research of "immediate, broad, and lasting impact".<ref name="Instructions">{{cite web

==Interactive features==
Scientific societies including the American Chemical Society are interested in the dissemination of information via [[Web 2.0]] technologies such as [[Wikipedia]].<ref name="Reactive reports">{{cite web

The stated goal of this journal club is to allow any user to write a spotlight of a scientific paper or website that is perceived to be of broad interest to the chemical biology community. Once a month a spotlight is chosen for publication in the journal.<ref>{{cite journal
