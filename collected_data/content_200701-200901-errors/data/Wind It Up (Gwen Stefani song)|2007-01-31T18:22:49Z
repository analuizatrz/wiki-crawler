"'''Wind It Up'''" is a [[pop music|pop]] song written by [[Gwen Stefani]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] originally for inclusion on Stefani's [[Harajuku Lovers Tour 2005]]. Because of favorable reception, the song was rerecorded for her second solo album ''[[The Sweet Escape]]'' (2006). "Wind It Up" was released as the album's first [[single (music)|single]] in late 2006 (see [[2006 in music]]) and has charted highly across the world. 

==Background and writing==
The lyrics of "Wind It Up" include references to Stefani's clothing line, [[L.A.M.B.]], and chronicles Stefani's feelings on how boys are infatuated with staring at her. The song  features [[yodelling]] and [[interpolation (music)|interpolates]] "The Lonely Goatherd" from ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965), from which it takes heavy influence.<ref>Collis, Clark.

==Critical reception==
"Wind It Up" received generally negative reviews by contemporary pop music critics, and many criticized the inclusion of the ''The Sound of Music'' sample. [[All Music Guide]] said that the song's producers (The Neptunes) forced the sampling "into one of their typical minimalist tracks, over which Gwen spouts off clumsy material-minded lyrics touting her fashion line and her shape".<ref>[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas]].

==Music video==
[[Image:WindItUpVideo.png|left|thumb|The music video features a key motif and incorporations of ''The Sound of Music''.]]

The song's [[music video]] was directed by [[Sophie Muller]] and filmed in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[United States]] and neighboring towns. Although it does not follow a substantial plot, it features outfits and scenery inspired by ''The Sound of Music''. Stefani and her [[Harajuku Girls]] are often dancing in front of fields of flowers and a background of key-like symbols comprised of two G's placed back to back. Throughout the video, Stefani is portrayed as a seamstress and submerged escape artist accompanied by dancers and the Harajuku Girls. In another scene everyone is dressed in pajamas. The song's title is visualized by a colorful sign that reads "wind it up".

"Wind It Up" premiered on [[MTV]]'s top-ten chart program ''[[Total Request Live]]'' on [[November 10]] [[2006]], where it reached number two. After its [[November 17]] debut on [[MuchMusic]]'s ''[[Countdown (MuchMusic TV series)|Countdown]]'', it peaked at number seven. On [[VH1]]'s ''[[VSpot Top 20 Countdown|Top 20 Video Countdown]]'', it reached number ten.

==Chart performance==
"Wind It Up" was released to Canadian and U.S. radio on [[October 31]] [[2006]]. It debuted on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] at number forty, Stefani's career-highest debut (with and without [[No Doubt]]). In Canada "Wind It Up" debuted at number eighty-eight on the [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|BDS]] Airplay Chart.
