'''Historically black colleges and universities''' ('''HBCUs''') are institutions of [[higher education in the United States]] that were established before [[1964]] with the intention of serving the [[African American]] community.

==Overview==
There are [[List of historically black colleges of the United States|114 historically black colleges]] in the [[United States]] today, including public and private, two-year and four-year institutions.  Many are [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] or [[universities]].

Other educational institutions currently have large numbers of African Americans in their student body, but as they were founded (or opened their doors to African Americans) after the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (the court decision which outlawed [[racial segregation]] of public education facilities), by definition they are not historically black colleges, but have been termed predominantly black.
