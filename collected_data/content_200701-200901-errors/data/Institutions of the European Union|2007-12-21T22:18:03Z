{{Politics of the European Union}}
There are currently five '''institutions of the [[European Union]]''' which govern the Union. They are outlined in the [[treaties of the European Union]] in the following order: the [[European Parliament]], the [[Council of the European Union]] (the Council); the [[European Commission]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Communities]] and the [[European Court of Auditors]].<ref name="Consolidated Treaty">{{cite web|title = Consolidated versions of the treaty on European Union and of the treaty establishing the European Community|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)|Eur-lex]]|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

==History==
{{see|History of the European Union}}
Most EU institutions were created with the establishment of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) in the 1950s. Much change since then has been in the context the shifting of the power balance away from the Council and towards the Parliament. The role of the Commission has often been to mediate between the two or tip the balance.<ref name="Hoskyns">{{cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine | coauthors = Michael Newman | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | date = 2000 | isbn = 978-0719056666 }}</ref> However the Commission is becoming more accountable to the Parliament: in 1999 it forced the resignation of the [[Santer Commission]]<ref>{{cite web|last = Topan|first=Angelina|title = The resignation of the Santer-Commission: the impact of 'trust' and 'reputation' |date=[[2002-09-30]]|publisher=European Integration Online Papers|url=http://eiop.or.at/eiop/pdf/2002-014.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> and forced a reshuffle of the proposed [[Barroso Commission]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tobais|first=Troll|title =“We have to democratise procedures”|date=[[2004-11-02]]|publisher=Café Babel|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=2620|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> The development of the institutions, with incremental changes from treaties and agreements, is testament to the evolution of the Union's structures without one clear "master plan".

===Establishment===
The first institutions were created at the start of the 1950s with the creation of the ECSC, based on the [[Schuman declaration]], between [[European Union member state|six states]]. The ECSC was designed to bring the markets of [[Coal]] and [[Steel]], the materials needed to wage war, under the control of a [[supranational]] authority with the aim of encouraging peace and economic development. It established the first institutions. At its core was an independent [[executive]] called the "High Authority" with supranational powers over the Community. The laws made by the Authority would be observed by a Court of Justice in order to ensure they were upheld and to arbitrate.<ref name="Europa ECSC">{{cite web|title = Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, ECSC Treaty|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/treaties/ecsc_en.htm|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref>

During the negotiations, two supervisory institutions were put forward to counter balance the power of the High Authority. The "Common Assembly" proposed by [[Jean Monnet]] to act as a monitor, counterweight and to add democratic legitimacy was composed of 78 national parliamentarians.<ref name="ENA Parliament"/> The second was the Council of Ministers, pushed by the smaller states also to add an [[intergovernmental]] element and harmonise national polices with those of the authority.<ref name="ENA Council"/>

===Changes===
In 1957 the [[Treaties of Rome]] established two, similar, communities creating a common market ([[European Economic Community]]) and promoting atomic energy co-operation ([[Euratom]]). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however they had a separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in these Communities. The reason for this is the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.<ref name="ENA Merger"/><ref name="ENA Council">{{cite web|publisher = [[European NAvigator]]|title = Council of the European Union|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=5604|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref><ref name="ENA Commission">{{cite web|title = European Commission|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3202|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>

The three communities were later merged in 1967, by the [[Merger Treaty]], into the European Communities. The institutions were carried over from the European Economic Community (making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor of the current Commission).<ref name="ENA Merger">{{cite web|title = Merging of the executives|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=473|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Under the Treaties of Rome, the Common Assembly (which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly, and then the European Parliament) was supposed to become elected. However this was delayed by the Council until 1979. Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties.<ref name="Hoskyns"/><ref name="ENA Parliament">{{cite web|title = European Parliament|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3998|accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> The [[Maastricht Treaty]] also gave further powers to the Council by giving it a key role in the [[Three pillars of the European Union|two new pillars]] of the EU which were based on intergovernmental principles.<ref name="ENA Council"/>

==Political institutions==
There are three political institutions which hold the executive and legislative power of the Union. The Council represents governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest.<ref name="Europa Institutions Commission"/> Essentially, the Council, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the Commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Parliament and Council, where in most cases both must give their assent. Although the exact nature of this depends upon the [[European Union legislative procedure|legislative procedure]] in use. Once it is approved and signed by both chambers it becomes law.<ref name="Parliament's powers"/> The Commission's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply.<ref name="Europa Institutions Commission"/>

===Parliament===
{{main|European Parliament}}
[[Image:EP Strasbourg hemicycle l-gal.jpg|thumb|The Parliament is the only directly elected body]]

The ''European Parliament'' shares the [[legislative branch|legislative]] and budgetary authority of the Union with the Council. The Parliament's [[President of the European Parliament|President]] (its [[speaker (politics)|speaker]]) is [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]] ([[European People's Party|EPP]]), who was elected from the Parliament's members in 2007.<ref name="Parliament's powers">{{cite web|title = Parliament's powers and procedures|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=46|accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref>

Its 785 [[Members of the European Parliament|members]] are elected every five years by [[universal suffrage]] and sit according to the [[Political spectrum|political allegiance]]. They represent nearly 500 million [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizens]] (the world's second largest democratic electorate) and form the only directly elected body in the Union. Despite forming one of the [[bicameral|two legislative chambers]] of the Union, it has weaker powers than the Council in some areas, and does not have [[legislative initiative]]. It does however have powers over the Commission which the Council does not. It has been said that its democratic nature and growing powers have made it one of the most powerful legislatures in the world.<ref name="Parliament overview">{{cite web|title = Parliament - an overview.

===Council===
{{main|Council of the European Union}}
[[Image:Open day 2007.JPG|thumb|The Council is the main decision making body]]

The ''Council of the European Union'' (informally known as the Council of Ministers or just the Council) is a body holding legislative and executive powers and is thus the main decision making body of the Union. Its [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]] rotates between the [[European Union member state|states]] every six months, but every three Presidencies now cooperate on a common programme. This body is separate from the [[European Council]] which is a similar but is composed of national leaders: see below.<ref name="Europa Institutions Council">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

The Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic but essentially it is one national [[Minister (government)|minister]] per state. For example, if agriculture is being discussed, the Council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems. Votes are taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population. In these various forms they share the legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament, and also lead cooperation in the second and third [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillars]]: the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] along with [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]].<ref name="Europa Institutions Council"/>

===Commission===
{{main|European Commission}}
[[Image:European Commission outside.jpg|thumb|The Commission forms the executive]]

The ''Commission of the European Communities'' is the executive arm of the Union. It is a body composed of one appointee from each state, currently twenty-seven, but is designed to be independent of national interests. The body is responsible for drafting all [[law of the European Union]] and has a monopoly over [[legislative initiative]] within the [[European Community]] [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillar]]. It also deals with the day-to-day running of the Union and has a duty to uphold the law and [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]] (in this role it is known as the "Guardian of the Treaties").<ref name="Europa Institutions Commission">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: The European Commission|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

The Commission is led by a [[President of the European Commission|President]] who is nominated by the Council (in practice the [[European Council]]) and approved by Parliament. The remaining Commissioners are proposed by member states, in consultation with the President, and then have to be approved by the Parliament as a whole before the Commission can take office. The current President is [[José Manuel Barroso]] ([[European People's Party|EPP]]), [[Barroso Commission|his commission]] was elected in 2004 and has a mandate until 2009.<ref name="Europa Institutions Commission"/>

===Acts and procedures===
{{main|European Union legislative procedure}}
There are a number of types of [[legislation]] which can be passed. The strongest is a [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]], an [[Act of Parliament|act]] or [[Statutory law|law]] which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A [[European Union decision|decision]] is an instrument which is focused at a particular person/group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue [[European Union recommendation|recommendations and opinions]] which are merely non-binding, declarations.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Community legal instruments|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/community_legal_instruments_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

For these acts, there are three [[European Union legislative procedure|EU legislative procedures]] which are commonly used. They alter the power balance between the Parliament and Council. The [[assent procedure]] and the [[consultation procedure]] give the Parliament less control over the legislation providing for a more [[unicameral]] system centred on the Council. Under assent, the Parliament need only accept or reject the proposal. Under consultation the Parliament, and the other advisory bodies, are asked for their opinion and the Parliament may proposed amendments but it cannot block the proposal.<ref name="decision making">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Decision-making in the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://www.europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

The most common system used is the [[codecision procedure]] which provides an equal footing between the two bodies. Under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council. They then send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a "common position". That proposal may either be approved or further amendments may be tabled by the Parliament. If the Council does not approve those, then a "Conciliation Committee" is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a common position. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament again by an [[absolute majority]].<ref name="decision making"/><ref name="Parliament's powers"/>

==Non-political institutions==
===Court of Justice===
{{main|European Court of Justice}}
[[Image:EUCoJ.jpg|thumb|The Court of Justice has the last word on Union law]]

The ''Court of Justice of the European Communities'' (commonly known as the European Court of Justice) is the [[supreme court|highest court]] of the Union on matters of [[Law of the European Union|Union law]] and is composed of 27 judges (one per state) with a President elected from among them (currently [[Vassilios Skouris]]). Its role is to ensure that Union law is allied in the same way across all states and to settle legal disputes between institutions or states. It has become a powerful institution as Union law overrides national law. In 2001 it ruled that parts of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]] were illegal according to the treaties and had to be amended. This related to the ban on women participating in military combat.<ref name="BBC DE CONST">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Germany votes for women in combat|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2000-10-27]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/994676.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref><ref name="Europa Institutions Justice">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: Court of Justice|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/justice/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

The Court of Justice is assisted by a lower court called the ''[[Court of First Instance|Court of First Instance of the European Communities]]'' (CFI) and a [[Civil Service Tribunal]] which are designed to reduce the workload of the main court.<ref name="Europa Institutions Justice"/>

===Court of Auditors===
{{main|European Court of Auditors}}
The fifth institution is the ''European Court of Auditors'', which despite its name has no judicial powers like the Court of Justice. Instead, it ensures that [[taxpayer]] funds from the [[budget of the European Union]] have been correctly spent. Notably the court provides an [[audit report]] for each financial year to the Council and Parliament. The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission's handling of the budget. The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.<ref name="Europa Institutions Auditors">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: Court of Auditors|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

It is the only institutions not mentioned in the original treaties, being set up in 1975. It was created as an independent institution due to the sensitivity of the issue of fraud in the Union (the anti-fraud agency, [[OLAF]], is also built on its independence). It is composed of one member from each state appointed by the Council every six years. Every three years one of them is elected to be the president of the court, who is currently [[Hubert Weber]].<ref name="Europa Institutions Auditors"/>

==Lisbon Treaty changes==
{{see|Lisbon Treaty}}

The Lisbon Treaty outlines a number of changes to the institutional structure of the Union. Largely following the changes proposed in the [[European Constitution]], it brings nearly all policy areas (including the budget) under the codecision procedure (renamed "''ordinary legislative procedure''"), hence increasing the power of the [[European Parliament|Parliament]]. The rules for the distribution of seats in the parliament will also be changed to a formula system.<ref name="Reform Draft Open">{{cite web|title =Draft treaty modifying the treaty on the European Union and the treaty establishing the European community|date=[[2007-07-24]]|publisher=[[Open Europe]]|url=http://www.openeurope.org.uk/research/translation.pdf|accessdate = 2007-07-28 }}</ref><ref name="CONST INST">{{cite web|title =The Institutions of the Union|date=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/institutions_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-09-18 }}</ref>

The size of the Commission (dropping its extended "''of the European Communities''" name) will shrink and include the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy|High Representative]] with the appointment of the President more dependent upon the last [[Elections in the European Union|EU elections]]. The [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] (now just the "Council") will adopt more [[Voting in the Council of the European Union#Reform Treaty (proposed)|Qualified majority voting]]. There will also be some minor changes in configurations and some powers will be transferred to the [[European Council]] (see below). The Court of Justice of the European Communities will become the "''Court of Justice of the European Union''" when referring to the whole judicial institution, while the court itself (excluding the Court of First Instance) will be simply the Court of Justice. The [[Court of First Instance]] of the European Communities will be renamed the "General Court", and specialised courts may be attached to this body by legislation. In addition, the following bodies will become full institutions:<ref name="Reform Draft Open"/><ref name="CONST INST"/>

===European Council===
{{main|European Council}}
[[Image:Euro Tower Frankfurt am Main.jpg|thumb|The Central Bank and European Council would become institutions under the new treaty]]

The ''European Council'' would become an institution.<ref name="Reform Draft Open"/> At present it is an informal body linked to the Council; it being composed not of ministers but of state leaders together with the Commission President. It meets four times a year to define the Union's policy agenda and give impetus to integration. Its presidency works in the same basis as that of the Council, rotating between each member every six months. The holder of the Presidency has no formal powers, but has influence over agenda and representation. The body as a whole has been described as the highest political body of the [[European Union]].<ref name="nbiz">{{cite web|last=van Grinsven|first=Peter|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The European Council under Construction|work=|publisher=Netherlands Institution for international Relations|date=September 2003|url=http://www.nbiz.nl/publications/2003/20030900_cli_paper_dip_issue88.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-16}}</ref>

Under the proposed treaty, it would be made more formal and have its own, permanent, ''[[President of the European Council]]'' - but it would still be an administrative position. The European Council would gain the executive powers of the Council (now called the Council of Ministers) such as the power to appoint the Commission President and [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]].<ref name="Reform Draft Open"/>

===European Central Bank===
{{main|European Central Bank}}
The ''European Central Bank'', is the second body set to become an institution. It is the [[central bank]] for the [[eurozone]] (the 13 states which have adopted the [[euro]]) and thus controls [[monetary policy]] in that area with an agenda to maintain [[price stability]]. It is at the centre of the [[European System of Central Banks]] which comprises all EU national banks. The bank is governed by a board comprising of national bank governors and a President, currently [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], appointed by the Council. This power of appointment will pass to the European Council.<ref name="Reform Draft Open"/><ref name="ECB org">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=ECB, ESCB and the Eurosystem|work=|publisher=[[European Central Bank]]|date=|url=http://www.ecb.eu/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-02}}</ref>

From the start the bank was designed to be independent of political influences, which has been questioned by figures such as [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. With the agreement to make the bank an institution, Trichet has expressed concern that it could undermine the bank's independence. He fears that the bank would be bound by the same code as the other institutions, to cooperate and pursue a common agenda. This may encourage leaders to put political pressure on the banks decisions.<ref name="FT ECB">{{cite web|last=Buck|first=Tobias|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Central bank chief urges change to EU treaty|work=|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=[[2007-08-11]]|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2129d4a0-4775-11dc-9096-0000779fd2ac,dwp_uuid=70662e7c-3027-11da-ba9f-00000e2511c8.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-02}}</ref>

==Comparisons==
[[Image:Bundeshaus - Nationalratsratssaal - 001.jpg|thumb|The EU's institutions bears a resemblance to the Swiss government]]
While the EU's system of governance is largely unique, elements can be compared to other models. The EU's institutional set up are somewhat similar to the [[Politics of Switzerland|government of Switzerland]]. The Swiss consensus-driven system is seen as successfully uniting a state divided by language and religion, although the EU was not directly modelled on the Swiss system despite bearing a number of similarities. The [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|double majority]] system in the Council means that for legislation to be passed, a vote of approval must represent both a majority of states and a majority of the EU's population. This system is also used in Switzerland where legislation requires a majority in the [[National Council of Switzerland|National Council]], representing the people, and a majority of the [[Swiss Council of States|Council of States]], representing the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]. The same is true for [[referenda]], although none are held Union-wide in the EU.<ref name="Swiss Comparison">{{cite web|last=Meyer-Resende|first=Michael|title =Comment: Making the EU democratic is desirable but risky|publisher=EU Observer|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25015|date=[[2007-06-18]]|accessdate = 2007-10-26}}</ref>

The European Commission also has a similarity to the [[Swiss Federal Council]] in that both have [[National government|all-party representation]]. The President of the Federal Council rotates between its members each year, in a fashion similar to that of the EU's Council Presidency or the future [[President of the European Council|presidency of the European Council]]. Due to this system of presidency Swiss leaders, like those of the EU, are relatively unknown with national politics viewed as somewhat [[technocratic]] resulting in low [[voter turnout]], in a similar fashion to that of the European Parliament. Other parallels include the jealously guarded powers of [[European Union member state|states]], the considerable level of [[Languages of the European Union|translation]] and the choice of a lesser city as the [[Capital city|capital]].<ref name="Swiss Comparison"/>

Further more, [[President of the European Union|executive power in the EU]] isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with the division of the European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the duel executive system found in the [[Government of France|French republic]] where there is a [[President of France|President]] (the Council President) and [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power, it would lack the prestige of the former.<ref name="FG Plan">{{cite web|last=Hix|first=Simon|last2=Roland|first2=Gérard|publisher = [[Foreign Policy Centre]]|title = Why the Franco-German Plan would institutionalise 'cohabitation' for Europe|url=http://fpc.org.uk/articles/201|accessdate = 2007-10-01 }}</ref>

==Locations==
{{main|Location of European Union institutions}}
[[Image:European Parliament Distance modified.jpg|thumb|Brussels hosts many institutions, with debate on the Parliament's seat]]

The institutions are not concentrated in a single [[capital city]], they are instead based across three cities, [[Brussels]], [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] and [[Strasbourg]]. The current arrangement was agreed in 1992 and attached to the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]].<ref name="ENA seats">{{cite web|first=|title=The seats of the institutions of the European Union|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=20822|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref> The treaty states that the Commission and Council would be based in Brussels, the Courts in Luxembourg and the Parliament in Strasbourg. However some departments of the Commission and meetings of the Council take place in Luxembourg, while the Parliament has its committees and some sessions in Brussels and its [[Secretariat of the European Parliament|secretariat]] in Luxembourg. Of the new institutions, the Central Bank is based in [[Frankfurt]]<ref name="p8">{{cite web|first=|title=Protocol (No 8) on the location of the seats of the institutions and of certain bodies and departments of the European Communities and of Europol (1997)|date=|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|accessdate=2007-07-15}}</ref> while the European Council is based in Brussels (but has some extraordinary meetings elsewhere).<ref name="Dragoman">{{cite web|last=Stark|first=Christine|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Evolution of the European Council: The implications of a permanent seat|work=|publisher=Dragoman.org|date=|url=http://www.dragoman.org/ec/belfast-2002.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref>

==Other bodies and agencies==
[[Image:EU Committees building.jpg|thumb|The EESC and CoR advise the other institutions]]
There are a number of other bodies and agencies of note that are not formal institutions. There are two advisory committees to the institutions which in some cases must be consulted: the [[Economic and Social Committee]] (EESC) advises on economic and social policy (principally relations between workers and employers) being made up of representatives of various industries and work sectors.
