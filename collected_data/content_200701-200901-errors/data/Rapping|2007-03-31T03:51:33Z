'''Rapping''', the [[rhythm]]ic delivery of [[rhyme]]s, is one of the central elements of [[hip hop music]] and [[hip hop culture|culture]].

It can be delivered over a [[beat (music)|beat]] or without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a grey area among speech, prose, poetry, and song.  Derived from [[African music|African]], [[Caribbean Music|Caribbean]], and [[American music|American]] roots, rap has developed both inside and outside of hip hop since the early 1970s.

The best rap of today's hip hop is delivered with complex [[rhythmic cadence|cadences]], intricate [[poetic|poetic form]], and inventive [[wordplay]]. In addition to dealing with the subjects associated with traditional [[poetry]], rap lyrics also convey the street life from which hip hop originally emerged.  Although rap has become an international phenomenon, some tensions concerning race, [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic class]], and gender remain among rappers and their listeners.

=== Roots ===
{{seealso|Roots of hip hop|Talking blues|Jazz rap}}
Rapping in [[hip hop music]] can be traced back in many ways to its African roots. Centuries before the [[United States]] existed, the [[griot]]s (folk poets) of [[West Africa]] were rhythmically delivering stories over [[drums]] and sparse instrumentation. Because of the time that has passed since the griots of old, the connections between rap and the African griots are widely established, but not clear–cut. However, such connections have been acknowledged by rappers, modern day "griots", [[spoken-word]] artists, mainstream news sources, and academics.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3622406.stm| title = BBC NEWS: Africa| accessdate = December 21| accessyear = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://rap.about.com/mbiopage.htm| title = About.com: Rap| accessdate = December 21| accessyear = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.pbs.org/theblues/classroom/deftradition.html| title = PBS lesson plan on the blues| accessdate = December 21| accessyear = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/2001/3/01.03.08.x.html#b| title = Yale University Teachers Association| accessdate = December 21| accessyear = 2005}}</ref>

[[Blues music]], [[Origins of the blues|rooted]] in the [[work songs]] and [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]] of [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] and influenced greatly by West African musical traditions, was first played by blacks (and some whites) in the [[Mississippi Delta]] region of the United States around the time of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. Grammy-winning blues musician/historian [[Elijah Wald]] and others have argued that the blues were being rapped as early as the 1920s.<ref name="r12">{{cite web| url = http://www.elijahwald.com/hipblues.html| title = Hip Hop and Blues| accessdate = December 21| accessyear = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.yazoorecords.com/2018.htm| title = The Roots of Rap| accessdate = December 21| accessyear = 2005}}</ref> Wald went so far as to call hip hop "the living blues."<ref name="r12" /> 
[[Image:Memphis_jugband.jpg|frame|left|The [[Memphis Jug Band]], an early blues group, whose lyrical content and delivery was comparable to rapping.]]
[[Jazz]], developed from the blues and other African-American musical traditions, originated around the beginning of the [[20th century]].  According to [[John Sobol]], the jazz musician and poet who wrote ''[[Digitopia Blues]]'', rap "bears a striking resemblance to the evolution of jazz both stylistically and formally."<ref name="digitopia">[[John Sobol]]'s ''[[Digitopia]]''</ref>  

During the mid-20th century, the musical culture of the [[Caribbean]] was constantly influenced by the concurrent changes in [[American music]]. In the 1950s through the 1970s, the descendants of Caribbean slaves in [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] were mixing their traditional folk music styles of [[mento]] and [[Calypso]] music with the [[jazz]], [[soul]], [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[blues]] of America.. In Jamaica this influenced the creation of [[Reggae]] music (and later [[Dancehall]]), while in Trinidad, this influenced the creation of [[Soca]].  As early as 1969, [[Deejay]]s were [[toasting]] (an African tradition of "rapped out" tales of heroism) over [[dub music|dubbed]] Jamaican beats.  It was called ''rap'', expanding the word's earlier meaning in the African-American community&mdash; "to discuss or debate informally."<ref name="r0">The earlier meaning being "a usage well established among African-Americans by the 1960s.", according to the ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary]]'', 4th Edition.</ref>

=== The '70s ===
{{seealso|Jamaican music|Caribbean music}}
The dubbed [[dancehall]] toasts of Jamaica, as well as the [[disco]]-rapping and jazz-based spoken word [[beat poetry]] of the United States set the template for the rapping in hip hop music.  One of the first rappers in hip hop was also hip hop's first [[DJ]]&mdash; [[Kool Herc]].  Herc, a Jamaican immigrant, started delivering simple raps at his parties in the early 1970s.  As Herc would explain in a 1989 interview, "[t]he whole chemistry came from Jamaica.  I was listening to American music in Jamaica, and my favorite artist was [[James Brown]].  When I came over here I just had to put it in the American style."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.daveyd.com/interviewkoolherc89.html| title = Davey D's Hip-Hop Corner| accessdate = December 20| accessyear = 2005}}</ref>  Although rapping in hip hop began with the DJs, most rappers today don't DJ or [[hip hop product|produce]] on a regular basis; [[Coke La Rock]] is cited by [[Kool Herc]] as the first example of such a rapper.<ref>[http://www.daveyd.com/koolherc.html Davey D's Hip-Hop Corner] - Interview with Kool DJ Herc.  Retrieved on January 9th, 2007.</ref>

By the end of the 1970s, hip hop had spread throughout New York, and was getting some radio play. Rappers were increasingly writing songs that fit [[pop music]] structures and featured continuous rhymes.  [[Melle Mel]] (of [[The Furious Five]]) stands out as one of the earliest rap innovators.

=== The '80s ===
{{Expand-section|date=January 2007}}
{{seealso|Old school hip hop|Golden age hip hop}}

From the 1970s to the early 1980s, Melle Mel set the way for future rappers through his sociopolitical content as well as his creative wordplay.

Hip hop lyricism saw its biggest change with the popularity of [[Run-DMC]]'s ''[[Raising Hell]]'' in the mid-1980s, known especially for the [[rapcore|rap/rock]] collaboration with [[rock band]] [[Aerosmith]] in the song "[[Walk This Way]]".  This album helped set the tone of toughness and lyrical prowess in hip hop;  Run-DMC were almost yelling their aggressive lyrics. 

The 80s saw  a huge wave of commercialized rap music, that with it brought success and international popularity. Rap music transcended its original demographic and passed in to the suburbs. Rap music in this time kept its original fan base in the '[[ghetto]]' while attracting interest from mainstream consumers. 
This decade also saw the emergence of what we now know as [[old school hip hop]] talented artists such as [[Run DMC]], [[LL Cool J]] and [[Public Enemy]]. This decade is also referred to as the [[Golden age hip hop]] by modern music historians.
Rap in this era was more commercially driven, centered mostly around light hearted topics - LL Cool J: ''going back to Cali''.

===The 90s===
{{seealso|Golden age hip hop|Gangster rap}}
{{Cleanup-section|March 2007}}
Rap in the 90s saw a substantial change in direction in the style of rapping. Where the 80s were characterized by verses mostly constrained to straightforward structures and rhyme schemes, rappers in the 90s explored deviations from those basic forms, freeing up the lyrical flow and switching up the patterns to create a much more fluid and complex style overall. More specifically, the style on the east coast became more aggressive and on point, a style pioneered by MCs like Ghostface Killah and Notorious B.I.G., while west coast hip-hop became more laid-back, funky, and smooth, as made popular by Dr. Dre and 2pac. In terms of subject matter, the 90s saw a shift from personal promotion and glorification to narratives of street experience and darker social observation, although this shift was more pronounced on the east coast than it was on the west. Rappers like the Guru of Gang Starr and Raekwon the Chef of the Wu-Tang Clan weaved a new hip-hop lexicon out of Five Percenter terminology and personal experience that continues to dominate the lyrics of many MCs to this day.

The 90s were marked by a tense rivalry between MCs of the east and west coast. More specifically, this conflict was a feud between Sean "Puffy" Combs' Bad Boy Records in the east, including the Notorious B.I.G., and Dr. Dre and Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had such artists as 2pac and Snoop Dogg. Freestyling became central to the art, as a skill that demonstrates an MC's versatility and creativity, but also as a verbal "duel" or "spar".

As the beginning of the 90's was a New trend for Hip-Hop the mid 90's became dangerous as an MC with the deaths of [[Tupac Shakur|Tupac]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Notorious Big]], [[Freaky Tah]], and [[Big L]]. The end of the 90's became more of a corporate mode for Hip-Hop since it became widely accepted in Mainstream music. Once what was referred to as a trend had everyone from Madonna to Pepsi using Rap as a medium.

=== Rhyme styles ===
{{seealso|Rhyme scheme}}
Aside from 'flow' (the voice and tone of a particular MC), and rhythmic delivery, the only other central element of rapping is [[rhyme]]. In classical poetry, rhymes that span many syllables are often considered whimsical, but in hip hop the ability to construct raps with large sets of rhyming syllables is valued. Rap can contain any and all forms of rhyme found in classical poetry such as [[consonance]], [[assonance]], [[half rhyme]], or [[internal rhyme]]. Rappers are known for their style of rhyming. [[Juelz Santana]] often avoids full rhymes in favor of assonance, consonance, half rhymes, and internal rhymes. [[Eminem]], on the other hand, often focuses on complex and lengthy rhyme schemes.

=== Literary technique ===
{{main|Literary technique}}
Rappers use [[double entendre]]s, [[alliteration]], and all other forms of wordplay that are also found in classical poetry. [[Simile]]s and [[metaphor]]s are used extensively in rap lyrics; rappers such as [[Paul Wall]] and [[Lloyd Banks]] have written entire songs wherein every line contains a simile or metaphor.

Hip hop lyrics often make passing references to popular culture and other topics. Such [[allusion]]s serve to illustrate or exaggerate a song's message. Some of these reference are overtly political, while others simply acknowledge, credit, or show dismay about aspects of the rapper's culture and life.

=== Word choice and slang ===
Many hip hop listeners believe that a rapper's lyrics are enhanced by a complex vocabulary. [[Kool Moe Dee]] claims that he appealed to older audiences by using a complex vocabulary in his raps.<ref name="r1" /> Rap is famous, however, for having its own vocabulary&mdash; from international hip hop slang to local/regional slang. Some artists, like the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], develop an entire lexicon among their clique. [[African American Vernacular English]] has always had a significant effect on hip hop slang, and vice-versa. Certain regions have introduced their unique regional slang to hip hop culture, such as the [[Oakland, California|Bay Area]] ([[Mac Dre]], [[E-40]]), [[Atlanta]] ([[OutKast]], [[Lil Jon]]), and [[Kentucky]] ([[Nappy Roots]]). [[The Nation of Gods and Earths]], a religious/spiritual group spun off from the [[Nation of Islam]], has influenced mainstream hip hop slang with the introduction of phrases such as "word is bond" that have since lost much of their original spiritual meaning.

Preference toward one or the other has much to do with the individual; [[GZA]], for example, prides himself on being very visual and metaphorical but also succinct, where underground rapper [[Daniel Dumile|MF DOOM]] is known for heaping similes upon similes. In still another variation, [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]] was known for saying exactly what he meant, literally and clearly.

=== Subject matter ===
{{seealso|Concept rap}}
[[Hip hop music]] originated in [[New York City]] in the 1970s, and continues to focus largely on metropolitan centers in the [[East Coast hip hop|East]] and [[West Coast hip hop|West]] coasts of America. Many rappers use urban culture as the backdrop for their raps, focusing on the hardships of inner-city life. One element that has always existed in rapped rhymes, dating back to hip hop's inception, is "the struggle". This struggle was originally financial or personal in nature; getting a girlfriend, or paying the rent. With "[[The Message (song)|The Message]]," a [[concept rap]] written by [[Melle Mel]] and performed by [[Grandmaster Flash#Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five|Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]], the idea of "the struggle" was put in another context: the shared hardships of the ghetto.

The roots of these sociopolitical raps are in the [[beat poetry]] of [[The Last Poets]] and [[Gil Scott Heron]]. "The Message" pioneered the inclusion of political content in hip hop rhymes, expanding beyond basic personal issues and party raps. In the [[golden age of hip hop]], [[Public Enemy]] emerged, with a focus on political and social issues. Modern East Coast hip hop artists such as [[Mos Def]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[Nas]], and [[dead prez]] are known for their sociopolitical subject matter.

Other rappers take a less critical approach to urbanity, sometimes even embracing such aspects as crime. [[Schoolly D]] was the first notable MC to rap about crime.<ref name="r10">{{cite web|last=Blow |first=Kurtis |authorlink=Kurtis Blow |coauthors=|date= |url=http://rhino.com/Features/liners/72851lin.html|title=Kurtis Blow Presents: The History of Rap, Vol. 1: The Genesis (liner notes)|work=Kurtis Blow Presents: The History Of Rap, Vol. 1: The Genesis|accessdate=May 14|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Several years later, he would go on to influence [[Ice T]], who had more overtly "gangsta" lyrics. [[Gangsta rap]], made popular largely because of [[N.W.A.]] and "proto-gangsta rapper" [[KRS-One]], celebrates crime and a hedonistic "gangsta" lifestyle.  With the death of his DJ, [[Scott La Rock]], KRS–ONE went on to speak out against violence in hip hop.  Various politicians, journalists, and religious leaders, have accused rappers of fostering a culture of violence and hedonism among hip hop listeners through their lyrics.<ref name="criticism1">{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2088-2272091,00.html|title=The hoodie needs a daddy, not a hug|accessdate=July 22|accessyear= 2006|first=Jill|last=Kirby|date=2006-07-16|publisher=The Times}}</ref><ref name="criticism2">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,61546,00.html|accessdate=July 22|accessyear=2006|first=Bill|Last=O'Reilly|date=2002-08-28|publisher=Fox News}}</ref><ref name="criticism3">{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1824848,00.html|title='We need heroes'|accessdate=July 22|accessyear= 2006|first=Dorian|last=Lynskey|date=2006-07-21|publisher= The Guardian}}</ref>

In contrast to the hedonistic approach of the gangsta rappers, some rappers have a spiritual or religious focus. [[Christian rap]] is currently the most commercially successful form of religious rap. Aside from [[Christianity]], the [[The Nation of Gods and Earths|Five Percent Nation]], a [[gnostic]] religious/spiritual group, has been represented more than any religious group in popular hip hop. Hip-hop artists such as [[Rakim]], the members of the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Brand Nubian]], [[X Clan]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Nas]], have had success in spreading the [[theology]] of the Five Percenters.

"Party rhymes," meant to pump up the crowd at a [[party]], were nearly the exclusive focus of [[old school hip hop]] (with the exception of [[The Furious Five]]). Party raps remain a staple of hip hop music to this day. In addition to Party raps, rappers also tend to make references to love and sex. Love raps were first popularized by [[Spoonie Gee]] of the [[Treacherous Three]], and later, in the golden age of hip hop, [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Heavy D]], and [[LL Cool J]] would continue this tradition. [[2 Live Crew]], a [[Miami bass]] group, were among the first hip hop act to be temporarily banned in the United States, for the overtly sexual and profane content of their raps.

== Performance ==
=== Flow ===
Rap delivery, or ''flow'', is defined by [[prosody (music)|prosody]], [[rhythmic cadence|cadence]], and [[tempo|speed]].  Cadence deals with the dynamics and patterns of the rhythm.  In addition to ''rubato'' (changes in tempo for the purpose of expression), cadence can also serve to reinforce  song structure through ''ritardando'' (the gradual slowing down of [[tempo]]).  [[Old school hip hop|Old school]] rappers generally maintained a simple cadence, without much deviation,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=73:1|title = allmusic| accessdate = December 22| accessyear = 2005}}</ref> while [[the golden age of hip hop|golden age]] rappers such as [[Rakim]] experimented extensively with cadence.<ref name="r1" /> Present day popular rappers like [[Method Man]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[André 3000]] are considered to have a versatile cadence because of their ability to rap over disparate beats equally well. 

A rap's prosody, as in classical poetry, is the [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] and the [[foot (prosody)|foot]]. The [[hardcore rap]]ping style pioneered by [[Run-DMC]] and [[KRS-ONE]] is an inverse of [[iambic pentameter]], in other words, [[trochaic]] [[pentameter]]. Iambic pentameter, which was [[William Shakespeare]]'s meter of choice, is known for its resemblance to natural, conversational [[speech]].  For this reason, rapping often sounds like talking "turned upside down."

A common way MCs judge how to flow in a verse is by writing a rhyme so that the most stressed words coincide with the beat's [[percussion]], in a way that makes the rhyming sound more musical (as opposed to spoken word) and that better combines the MC's voice with the musical backdrop.  Rakim -- whom many credit with changing the way most rappers flow on a song -- experimented not only with following the percussion, but also with complementing the song's melody with his own voice, making his flow sound like that of an instrument (a saxophone in particular{{Fact|date=January 2007}}).

The ability to rap quickly and clearly is sometimes regarded as an important sign of skill. In certain [[list of genres of hip hop|hip hop subgenres]] such as [[chopped and screwed]], slow-paced rapping is often considered optimal. The current record for fastest rapper is held by [[MC Ricky Brown]], who rapped 723 syllables in 51.27 seconds (14.1 syllables per second) on his track "[[No Clue]]" at [[B&G Studios]] on [[January 15]], [[2005]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50916 | title = Guinness World Records | accessdate = December 17 | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref>

To successfully deliver a nicely ''flowing'' rap, a rapper must also develop vocal presence, [[enunciation]], and [[breath control]]. Vocal presence is the distinctiveness of a rapper's voice on record. Enunciation is essential to a flowing rap; some rappers choose also to exaggerate it for comic and artistic effect. Breath control, taking in air without interrupting one's delivery, is an important skill for a rapper to master, and a must for any MC. An MC with poor breath control can't deliver difficult verses without making unintentional pauses. 

Raps are sometimes delivered with melody. West Coast rapper [[Egyptian Lover]] was the first notable MC to deliver "sing-raps."<ref name="r10" /> Popular rappers such as [[50 Cent]] and [[Ja Rule]] add a slight melody to their otherwise purely percussive raps whereas some rappers, such as [[Cee-Lo]], are able to [[harmony|harmonize]] their raps with the beat. The Midwestern group [[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]] was one of the first groups to achieve nation-wide recognition for using the fast-paced, melodic and harmonic raps that are also practiced by [[Do or Die]], another Midwestern group.

=== Rap groups ===
{{seealso|list of hip hop groups}}
[[Image:Wu-tangclan.jpg|right|thumb|220px|The [[Wu-Tang Clan]]]]
Synchronization is common among rap groups. Synchronization refers to the organization of several rappers into one song either by overlapping or through [[call and response]]. [[Grandmaster Flash]]'s MCs, the [[Furious Five]], were the first to make five rappers sound as one through synchronization.<ref>Some rappers take the role of two different characters that are talking to each other in the song.  Examples include "Warning" by Notorious BIG and "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]" by [[Eminem]].</ref>

=== Freestyle rapping ===
{{seealso|Freestyle rap}}
There are two kinds of [[Freestyle rapping]]: one is scripted (recitation), but having no particular overriding subject matter, the second
typically referred to as ''freestyling'' or ''spitting'', is the improvisation of rapped lyrics.  When freestyling, some rappers inadvertently reuse old lines, or even "cheat" by preparing segments or entire verses in advance. Therefore, freestyles with proven spontaneity are valued above generic, always usable lines.{{Fact|date=January 2007}}  Rappers will often reference places, objects in their immediate setting, or specific (usually demeaning) characteristics of opponents, to prove their authenticity and originality.

=== Battle rapping ===
{{seealso|Battle rap|Diss track}}
[[Battle rap]]ping, which can be freestyled, is the competition between two or more rappers in front of an audience.  The tradition of insulting one's friends or acquaintances in rhyme goes back to [[the dozens]], and was portrayed famously by [[Mohammed Ali]] in his boxing matches. The winner of a battle is decided by the crowd and/or preselected judges. According to [[Kool Moe Dee]], a successful battle rap focuses on an opponents weaknesses, rather than one's own strengths.<ref name="r1" /> [[Television show]]s such as [[BET]]'s ''[[106 and Park]]'' and [[MTV]]'s ''DFX'' host weekly freestyle battles live on the air. Battle rapping gained widespread public recognition outside of the African-American community with rapper [[Eminem]]'s movie, ''[[8 Mile]].''  One of the most prolific battle rappers of recent years is former ''106 and Park'' [[Freestyle Friday]] champion [[Jin (rapper)|Jin]].

The strongest battle rappers will generally perform their rap fully freestyled (not pre-written).  This is the most effective form in a battle as the rapper can comment on the other person, whether it be what they look like, or how they talk, or what they wear.  It also allows the rapper to reverse a line used to 'diss' him/her if they are the second rapper to battle.

By the [[United States 2000 Census]], three-quarters of the United States' population is white, while one-eighth is black.

Wealth and class are significant issues in hip-hop, a culture which was developed mainly among the lower and lower-middle class blacks of inner-city New York.  Any view of money that can be seen in real life can also be seen in the lyrics of rap-- just as there are rappers who often brag about their extravagant wealth, or more specifically, their "rags to riches" stories, there are political militants who decry materialism. Although most of hip hop's famous and influential rappers have come from inner-city ghettos{{Fact|date=January 2007}}, hip-hop has always represented a variety of economic backgrounds.  For example, [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[The Beastie Boys]], [[Rakim]], [[Black Sheep (hip hop group)|Black Sheep]], and [[Kanye West]]<ref name=Kanye">{{cite web| last = Tyrangiel | first = Josh | url = http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1096499,00.html | title = Why You Can't Ignore Kanye | format = | work = [[Time Magazine]] | publisher = | accessdate = May 21|accessyear = 2006}}</ref> were middle-class when they began rapping.

Race issues often intersect with class issues.  [[Vanilla Ice]], a white [[pop rap]]per, went so far as to lie about his place of origin, claiming that he came from the inner-city of [[Miami, Florida]], when he was actually from [[suburb]]an [[Texas]]. According to Vanilla Ice, he was encouraged to lie by his record company, to increase their profits.<ref name="Vanilla Ice">{{cite web| last = Austen | first = Jake | url = http://www.roctober.com/roctober/greatness/vanilla.html | title = Vanilla Ice: The Ice Is Right | format = | work = Rocktober Roctober #24, 1999| publisher = | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> In juxtaposition to Vanilla Ice stand the [[Beastie Boys]], a rap group composed of white [[Judaism|Jewish]] teenagers. The Beastie Boys didn't lie about their middle-class and suburban upbringing, and managed to sell millions of records while maintaining the respect of the hip hop community.{{Fact|date=January 2007}}

The most notable exception to the skin color trend in rappers is [[Eminem]], who is of mainly [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, who grew up in the primarily black city of [[Detroit]].<ref>http://music.yahoo.com/ar-289114-bio--Eminem</ref> According to the [[Guinness World Records 2005]], Eminem is the highest selling rapper of all time.{{Fact|date=January 2007}}  In his song "[[White America]]", Eminem attributes his selling success to his being more easily digestible by a white audience, because he "looks like them."

Despite so many rappers being black, most hip hop record purchasers tend to be white, reflecting demographics and economics. According to [[musicology|musicologist]] [[Arthur Kempton]], "Today 70 percent of hip-hop is bought by white kids".<ref>{{cite news|title=HIP-HOP SETTING THE BEAT IN FIRST, BLACK ARTISTS HOLD BILLBOARD'S TOP 10|first=Joan|last=Anderman|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2003-10-04|url=http://hsan.org/content/main.aspx?pageid=21|accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref>

According to political rapper Zion of [[Zion I]], socially conscious hip hop has a mainly white audience: "...so many Black people don't want to hear it. They want that thug shit."

== Derivatives and influence ==
{{section-stub}}
Throughout hip hop's history, new musical styles and genres have developed that contain rapping. Entire genres, such as [[rapcore]] ([[rock music|rock]]/[[metal music|metal]]/[[punk music|punk]] with rapped vocals) and [[hip house]] have resulted from the fusion of rap and other styles. All popular music genres with a focus on percussion have contained rapping at some point&mdash; be it [[disco]] ([[DJ Hollywood]]), [[jazz]] ([[Gangstarr]]), [[New Wave music|new wave]] ([[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]), [[funk]] ([[Fatback Band]]), [[contemporary R&B]] ([[Mary J. Blige]]), [[Reggaeton]] ([[Daddy Yankee]]), or even Japanese dance music, such as ([[Soul'd Out]]). [[UK garage]] music has begun to focus increasingly on rappers in a new subgenre called [[grime]], pioneered and popularized by the MC, [[Dizzee Rascal]].[[Bhangra]], a widely popular style of music from [[Punjab (India)]] has been mixed numerous times with [[reggae]] and hip-hop music. The popular song of this mix was "mundian to bach ke" or "Beware the boys" by [[panjabi mc]] and [[Jay-Z]]. Although mundian to bach ke was already a song inspired by [[knight rider]],the mixing with Jay-Z popularized the genre further.
