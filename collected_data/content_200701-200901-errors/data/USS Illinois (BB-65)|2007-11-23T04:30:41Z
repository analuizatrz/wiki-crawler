'''USS ''Illinois'' (BB-65)''' was to be the fifth {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}} constructed for the [[United States Navy]]; she was the fourth ship to be [[ship naming and launching|named]] in honor of [[Illinois|the 21st state]]. Like her sister ship {{USS|Kentucky|BB-66}}, ''Illinois'' was still under construction at the end of [[World War II]] and was caught up in the post-war drawdown of the armed services. Her construction was canceled in August 1945, but her hulk remained until 1958 when it was broken up.

==Background==
{{main|Iowa class battleship}}
''Illinois'' was one of the "[[fast battleship]]" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]]. She was to be the fifth of the six authorized ships of the {{sclass|Iowa|battleship|4}} of battleships. Like her Iowa class sisters Illinois was to cost $125 million and take roughly 30 to 40 months to complete.<ref name="gs design">{{citeweb |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/bb-61-design.htm |title=BB-61 Iowa-class Design |accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref> Her [[keel]] was laid down at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] on [[15 January]] [[1945]]. Like ''Kentucky'', ''Illinois'' differed from her earlier sisters in that her design called for an all welded construction. This would have saved weight and increased strength over a combination riveted/welded hull of the type used on the four completed ''Iowa''-class ships. Engineers considered redesigning the hull to incorporate the {{sclass|Montana|battleship|0}} type armor for added [[torpedo]] protection; however, this was rejected and ''Illinois'' was being built along the regular ''Iowa'' class hull design.<ref name="math">{{cite web |url=http://web.umr.edu/~rogersda/american&military_history/World%27s%20Fastest%20Battleships.pdf |title=Development of the World's Fastest Battleships |accessdate=2007-04-28 |format=pdf |last=Rogers |first=J. David}}</ref>

Like her ''Iowa''-class sisters, ''Illinois''’s construction began in response to the need for fast escorts for the {{sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier}}s. She was conceived in 1935, when the United States Navy initiated design studies for the creation of an extended [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota'' class]] that was not restricted by the [[Second London Naval Treaty]]. The latter four ''Iowa'' class battleships ({{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}, {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}}, ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'') were not cleared for construction until 1940,<ref name="math"/> when the [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] demand that the [[United States Congress]] fund a two ocean navy to meet the threats posed in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Concern over the German invasion of France prompted Congress to respond by allotting enough money to complete the last four ''Iowa''-class battleships (''Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois,'' and ''Kentucky'').<ref name="gs design"/> At the time ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'' were to be larger, slower battleships mounting twelve 16&nbsp;inch Mark 7 guns,<ref name="Mark 7">{{cite web | last =DiGiulian | first =Tony | title =United States of America 16"/50 (40.6 cm) Mark 7 | work = Unofficial U.S. Navy site | date = Last updated [[12 November]] [[2006]] | url =http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-50_mk7.htm | accessdate =2007-01-16}}</ref><ref> This was not the first time that changes to the ''Iowa'' class had been proposed: at the time the battleships were cleared for construction some policymakers were not sold on the U.S. need for more battleships, and proposed turning the ''Iowa''-class ships into aircraft carriers by retaining the hull design but switching their decks to carry and handle aircraft (This had already been done on the battlecruisers {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}). This proposal was countered by [[Admiral]] [[Ernest King]], the Chief of Naval Operations.{{cite web | title =BB-61 Iowa-class Aviation Conversion | url =http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/bb-61-av.htm | accessdate =2007-05-19}}</ref> but by late 1939, it had become apparent that the navy needed as many fast battleships as possible and it was decided that BB-65 and BB-66 would follow the same design as their sisters.<ref>At the time, the {{sclass|Montana|battleship|0}} was planned to begin with hull number BB-65, rather than BB-67 as it became after two more ''Iowa''s were ordered as BB-65 and BB-66. {{cite web | title =Iowa Class (BB-61 through BB-66) Drawings | url =http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/usnshtp/bb/bb61cl-d.htm | accessdate =2007-11-07}}</ref><ref> It is possible that the design originally intended for BB-65 and BB-66 was to be implemented in the {{sclass|Montana|battleship}}s. The ''Montanas'' would have had twelve 16 inch guns and heavier armor and were intended to have a slower top speed than the ''Iowa''-class.</ref>

==Construction==
{{main|Iowa class battleship|Armament of the Iowa class battleship}}
''Illinois''’s main battery would have consisted of nine [[16 inch (406 mm)/50 caliber Mark 7 naval gun]]s, which could hurl 2,700 lb armor piercing shells some 24 nautical miles. Her secondary battery would have consisted of ten turrets armed with [[5 inch (127 mm)/38 caliber gun]]s, which could fire at targets up to 9 nautical miles away. With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain [[air superiority]] came a need to protect the growing fleet of Allied aircraft carriers; to this end, ''Illinois'' was to be fitted with an array of [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20 mm]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm]] [[anti-aircraft artillery|anti-aircraft guns]] to defend allied carriers from enemy airstrikes.<ref name="The Battleships I">{{cite book  | last =Johnston, Ian & McAuley, Rob  | title =The Battleships | publisher =Channel 4 Books (an imprint of Pan Macmillian, LTD) | date =2002 | location =London | pages =page 120 | url = http://www.panmacmillan.com/ | id =ISBN 0752261886}}</ref><ref name="Discovery">{{cite episode | title = The 10 Greatest Fighting Ships in Military History | network = The Discover Channel}}</ref>

The keel of ''Illinois'' was laid at [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] on [[15 January]] [[1945]]. Construction was canceled on [[12 August]] [[1945]] when the battleship was about 22 percent complete. Nothing was done with ''Illinois'' after cancellation, and the incomplete hulk was sold for scrapping in September 1958.<ref name="NIP History">Naval Institute Press. (December 1985).

''Illinois'' was canceled after the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and it became evident that her completion would occur after the expected [[Operation Downfall|invasion]] of the [[Japanese Archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]]. She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on [[12 August]] [[1945]], but her incomplete hulk was retained along with her sister ''Kentucky'' until 1958 when both incomplete ships were broken up. She was scrapped in her drydock on the builders ways starting in September 1958.<ref name="NIP History">Naval Institute Press. (December 1985). U.S. Battleships: An Illustrated Design History.

Although the University of Illinois records are unclear as to whether the bell was donated to the University in general or the NRTOC at the University specifically, the bell has found a new home with the Fighting Illini football team, and is traditionally rung by [[NROTC]] members in a culmulative manner when the football team scores points in a game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oc.uiuc.edu/OnOurWatch/infocus/102007.html |title=Illinois On Our Watch |accessdate=2007-11-14 |author=Chancellor Richard Herman |publisher=Public Affairs for the Office of the Chancellor and the University of Illinois Alumni Association }}</ref>
