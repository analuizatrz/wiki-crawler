The '''37mm Gun M3''' was the first dedicated [[anti-tank gun]] fielded by the [[United States]] forces. Introduced in 1940, it became the standard anti-tank gun of the U.S. [[infantry]]. The evolution of [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[tank]]s quickly rendered the 37 mm piece ineffective though and in 1943–44 the M3 was gradually replaced in European theaters by the more powerful British design [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|57mm Gun M1]]. In the Pacific, where the armor threat was less significant the M3 remained in service until the end of the war. Like many other light anti-tank guns, the M3 was widely used as infantry support and an anti-personnel weapon, firing [[Shell (projectile)#High-explosive (HE)|high-explosive]] and [[canister shot|canister]] rounds.

The M5 and M6 tank mounted variants were used in several models of armored vehicles most notably in the [[Stuart tank|Light Tank M3/M5]], the [[M3 Lee|Medium Tank M3]] and the [[M8 Greyhound|Light Armored Car M8]]. In addition, the M3 in its original version was mated to a number of other self-propelled carriages.

==Development history==
In the mid-1930s the [[United States Army]] had yet to field a dedicated anti-tank artillery piece; anti-tank [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of infantry [[regiment]]s were armed with .50-cal [[machine gun]]s. Although were some consideration had been given to replacing the machine guns with more a powerful [[anti-tank gun]], the situation only began to change after the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Combat experience from Spain suggested that a light anti-tank gun, such as the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[3.7 cm PaK 36|PaK 35/36]], was capable of neutralizing the growing threat posed by tanks.<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7">Zaloga - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941–45'', p. 3–7.</ref>

In January 1937, the [[Ordnance Corps|Ordnance Committee]] recommended development of a such a weapon;<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7">Zaloga - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941–45'', p. 3–7.</ref> two PaK 36 guns were acquired for study.<ref name="HOGG149">Hogg - ''Allied Artillery of World War Two'', p 149.</ref> As the projected main user of the weapon the Infantry branch was chosen to oversee the work. They wanted a lightweight gun which could be moved around by the crew, so any ideas of using a larger caliber then that of the German gun were discarded.<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7"/>

Development and testing continued until late 1938. Several variants of gun and carriage were proposed until on [[15 December]] a combination of the T10 gun and T5 carriage was officially adopted as the 37mm Gun M3 and Carriage M4.<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7"/> Although the weapon followed the concept of the PaK 36 and often referred to as a copy of it,<ref>E.g. see Rottman - ''The US Marine Corps 1941–45'', p 17: "M3A1 ... was copied from the standard German AT gun".</ref> the M3 differed significantly from the German design and used different ammunition.

The gun was manufactured by [[Watervliet Arsenal]] and the carriage by [[Rock Island Arsenal]]. The first pieces were delivered early in [[1940]],<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7"/> the production continued until [[1943]].

Some minor changes in the gun construction were introduced during the production period. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on [[29 January]] [[1942]]). Although Ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed.<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7"/> Another change was a threaded [[Gun barrel|barrel]] end to accept a big five-port [[muzzle brake]] (gun M3A1, adopted on [[5 March]] [[1942]]). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust under dry ground conditions. However it turned out to be a safety problem when firing [[Case shot|canister ammunition]] and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without muzzle brake.<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7"/> Other sources mention the muzzle brake was intended to soften a recoil and they say that it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures weren't really needed.<ref name="HOGG149"/><ref name="CHAMBERLAINGANDER47">Chamberlain, Gander - ''Anti-Tank Weapons'', p 47.</ref>

In an attempt to increase the armor penetration of the M3 several squeeze bore adapters (including the British [[Littlejohn adaptor]]) were tested; none were adopted. Experiments with rocket launchers on the M4 carriage (e.g. 4.5in rocket projector T3) did not produce anything practical either.<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7"/>

==Description==
The barrel was of one-piece forged construction, with uniform rifling (12 grooves, right-hand twist, one turn in 25 calibers). The breech end of the barrel was screwed into a breech ring. The breech mechanism was of vertical sliding block type. The barrel was fitted with a hydrospring recoil system.<ref name=TM-9-2005>''Technical Manual TM 9-2005 volume 3, Infantry and Cavalry Accompanying Weapons'', p 11-15.</ref>

The carriage was of split trail type, with pneumatic tires.<ref name=TM-9-2005/> Mounted on the axle next to the wheels were the "wheel segments" -  segment-shaped supports that could be lowered to provide more stability in the firing position or raised so that they would not impede movement of the gun.

The telescopic sight on the M6 and both elevation and traverse controls were located on the left side, so one gunner was able to aim the gun. The traverse gear had a release mechanism which allowed free movement of the barrel in case a quick traverse was needed.<ref name=TM-9-2005/>

==Organization==
[[Image:Front line of Kwajalein.jpg|thumb|right|Men of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Division, US Army]] move a gun up to the front line on [[Kwajalein]].]]
===US Army===
Early in World War II, each infantry [[battalion]] had an anti-tank [[platoon]] with four 37 mm guns and each [[regiment]] an anti-tank [[Company (military unit)|company]] with twelve.<ref name="ANDERSON">Anderson - ''US Army in World War II; Cavalry and Infantry''.</ref> 3/4 ton trucks were assigned as [[Artillery tractor|prime movers]], but many units received the [[Willys MB|1/4 ton truck]] (better known as the jeep) instead. Two companies of 37 mm guns were initially a part of the divisional anti-tank battalion (along with one company of [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897|75 mm guns]]); however in December 1941 AT battalions were removed from divisional structure and reorganized as independent tank destroyer battalions; their towed guns were replaced with self-propelled ones as soon as the latter became available.<ref name="ZALOGADELF9to12">Zaloga - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 9-12.</ref>

In 1942 the first airborne divisions were formed. According to their organizational structure of October 1942, an airborne division had 36 37 mm anti-tank guns: four in divisional artillery, eight in [[glider]] infantry regiment and 24 in AA/AT battalion.<ref name="ZALOGADELF23to24">Zaloga - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 23, 24.</ref>

37 mm guns were also issued to the infantry regiments of the only mountain division formed in the United States - the [[10th Mountain Division]].<ref name="ANDERSON"/>

===US Marine Corps===
Under the D-series Tables of Organization (TO) from [[1 July]] [[1942]], the role of AT weapons in [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] service was officially entrusted to 20 mm automatic guns, in regimental weapon company (three platoons) and battalion weapon company (one platoon). In practice units used the World War I era [[Canon d'Infanterie de 37 modèle 1916 TRP|37mm M1916]] for training. They were equipped with the M3 (four in each platoon) before being sent to the frontline. Additionally, a divisional special weapons battalion was equipped with self-propelled [[M6 Fargo|37mm GMC M6]].<ref>Rottman - ''US Marine Corps Pacific Theater of Operations 1941-43'', p 25-30.</ref>

Under the E-series TO from [[15 April]] [[1943]], self-propelled guns in the divisional special weapons battalion were replaced with 18 37 mm towed guns in three batteries of six; an infantry regiment had a weapons company with 12, in three platoons of four. The battalion-level AT guns were removed. In total, a division possessed 54 pieces. The F-series Table of Organization (TO) from [[5 May]] [[1944]] removed the special weapons battalion from the divisional organization, resulting in a total of 36 guns per division. The subsequent G-series TO reduced regimental weapon companies to two platoons, meaning 24 pieces per division. Although the G-series TO was only adopted on [[4 September]] [[1945]], in practice in some divisions this change was introduced early in 1945.<ref>History of U.S. Marine Corps Operations in World War II, Vol II: Table of Organization E-100, p 571, 572; Vol III: Table of Organization F-100, p 618, 619; Rottman - ''The US Marine Corps 1941-45'', p 5-8; ww2gyrene: The Marine Division; ww2gyrene: M3A1 37mm Antitank Gun.</ref>

===Other operators===
The only major [[lend lease]] recipient of the M3 was the Chinese [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang Army]] (1,669 pieces). The gun was also supplied to [[Bolivia]] (4), [[Canada]] (3), [[Chile]] (198), [[Colombia]] (4), [[Cuba]] (1), [[El Salvador]] (9), [[France]] (130), [[United Kingdom]] (78), [[USSR]] (63) and other countries (100).<ref>Zaloga - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 44.</ref> Some nations still had it in service in early 1970s.<ref name="CHAMBERLAINGANDER47"/>

==Combat Service==

The M3 saw action for the first time during the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941-42)|defense of the Philippines]] in December 1941.<ref name="ZALOGADELF9to12"/> It went on to become a factor in the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]], where it was successfully employed  against both [[Japan]]ese armor and infantry.<ref>History of U.S. Marine Corps Operations in World War II, Vol I: The Battle of the Tenaru, p 290; Vol I: Japanese Counteroffensive, p 330, 332.</ref> Throughout the war it remained effective against Japanese vehicles, which were thinly armored and were rarely committed in large groups. The light weight of the gun made it easy to move through difficult terrain; for example, when attacked by Japanese tanks on Betio during the [[Battle of Tarawa]], Marines were able to heave the M3 over the five-foot-high seawall<ref name="ROTTMANCHAPELL12">Rottman - ''The US Marine Corps 1941-45'', p 12-13.</ref>. While canister ammunition proved useful in stopping Japanese infantry attacks, against enemy fortifications the M3 was only somewhat effective because of its small high explosive projectile. Its overall effectiveness and ease of use meant the gun remained in service with the Marine Corps and with some Army units in the Pacific until the end of the war.<ref name="ZALOGADELF9to12"/> Unhappy with the unusually low shield of the M3, some Marine Corps units extended it to provide better protection. A standard kit was tested in 1945, but was never issued.<ref>Zaloga - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 6, 46.</ref>

The experience of the M3 in the [[North African Campaign]] was completely different. The gun was not powerful enough to deal with late production [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]]. After the nearly disastrous [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]] in February [[1943]], reports from some of the involved units mentioned 37 mm projectiles "bouncing off like marbles" from the turret and front armor of German medium tanks and proclaimed the gun "useless unless you have gun crews with the guts to stand and shoot from 100 yards". The Army was initially uncertain if these reports reflected the obsolescence of the weapon, or whether unrefined tactics and lack of experience were to blame. Yet on [[26 May]] 1943 a new organization had the M3 replaced by the ''57mm Gun M1'' (the US-produced version of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6 pounder]]), with Dodge 1 1/2 ton trucks as prime movers. But only by spring [[1944]] did the 57mm gun reach the battlefield in large numbers.<ref name="ZALOGADELF9to12"/>

Meanwhile, the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]] was launched, and M3 guns saw action from the day of the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily landing]] on [[10 July]] [[1943]]. That day the 37 mm guns demonstrated once again both their effectiveness against pre-war tanks &ndash; when they helped to repel an attack by Italian [[Renault R 35]]s &ndash; and inability to cope with modern threats in a subsequent encounter with [[Tiger I|Tigers]] from the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring|Herman Göring division]]. The Italian theater had a lower priority for reequipment than Northwest Europe, and some M3s were still in use in Italy in late 1944.<ref>Zaloga - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 21, 22.</ref>

By mid-1944 the M3 had fallen out of favor even with airborne troops, despite their strong preference for compact and lightweight weapon systems. The Airborne Command had rejected the 57 mm M1 in the summer of 1943 claiming its unfitness for airlifting<ref>Zaloga - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 14.</ref> and the organization of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keeping their 37 mm guns. Nevertheless, the [[U.S. 82nd Airborne Division|82nd]] and the [[101st Airborne Division|101st]], were reequipped with a version of the British-manufactured 6 pounders designed to fit into the [[Airspeed Horsa|Horsa glider]] for the [[Battle of Normandy#Airborne landings|Normandy airdrops]].<ref name="ZALOGADELF23to24"/>

The M3 was phased out of US service soon after the end of the war.<ref name="CHAMBERLAINGANDER47"/>

[[Image:M6-37mm-GMC.jpg|right|thumb|37mm GMC M6 with improvised machine gun mount.]]
Two tank gun variants were developed based on the barrel of the M3. The first, initially designated M3A1 but renamed M5 on [[13 October]] [[1939]], was shortened by 5.1 inches (3.5 calibers) to avoid damage to the tube in wooden areas. Later a variant with a semi-automatic breech (with empty cartridge ejection) was developed. This variant - initially designated M5E1, adopted as M6 on [[14 November]] 1940 - received a full length barrel. The tubes were interchangeable, but replacing M5 with M6 and vice versa would result in an unbalanced mount and was therefore prohibited.<ref name="HUNNICUTT-STUART-118and143"/> These guns were mounted on several models of tanks and other armored vehicles:
*[[M2 Light Tank|Light Tank M2A4]]: M5 in mount M20. The recoil mechanism, protruding beyond the gun mask, had to be protected by an armored casing.<ref>Hunnicutt - ''Stuart: A History of the American Light Tank'', p 119, 143.</ref>
*[[Stuart tank|Light Tank M3]]: M5 in mount M22, in late production vehicles M6 in mount M23. These mounts were fitted with more compact recoil mechanism, eliminating the need for the protective casing.<ref>Hunnicutt - ''Stuart: A History of the American Light Tank'', p 127, 143.</ref>

==Ammunition==
The M3 utilized fixed ammunition. Projectiles were fitted with a 37x223R cartridge case, designated Cartridge Case M16. Available projectiles included armor piercing, high explosive and canister.
