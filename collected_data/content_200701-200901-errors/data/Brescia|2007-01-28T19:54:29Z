'''Brescia''' ([[Lombard language|Lombard]]: ''Breha'') is a city in the region of [[Lombardy]] in northern [[Italy]], between the Mella and the Naviglio, with a population of around 190,000. It is the second largest city in [[Lombardy]], after the capital Milan.
The city is the administrative capital of the [[Province of Brescia]], one of the largest in Italy, with about 1,200,000 inhabitants. The ancient city of [[Brixia]], Brescia has been an important regional centre since pre-Roman times and a number of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[medieval]] monuments are preserved, among which is the prominent castle.

The city is at the centre of the third-largest Italian industrial area, concentrating on mechanical and automotive [[engineering]] and machine tools. Its companies are typically small or medium- sized enterprises, often with family managements. The financial sector is also a major employer, and the tourist industry is important as well, given the proximity of [[Lake Garda]], [[Lake Iseo]]  and the [[Alps]].

===Ancient history===
Different mythological versions of the foundation of Brescia exist: one assign it to [[Hercules]], while another says that it was created as ''Altilia'' ("the other Ilium") by a fugitive from the siege of [[Troy]]. According to a further one, the founder was the king of the [[Ligures]] Cidnus, who had invaded the [[Po River|Padan Plain]] in the late [[Bronze Age]]. Other scholars attribute the foundation to the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]s.

Invaded by the [[Gauls]] [[Cenomani]], allied of the [[Insubres|Insubri]], in the [[4th century BC]]E, it became their capital. During the [[Carthaginian Wars]] '''''Brixia''''' was usually allied of the Romans: in [[202 BC]]E it was part of a Celt confederation against them, but, after a secret agreement, changed side and attacked by surprise the Insubri, destroying them. Subsequently the city and the tribe entered peacefully in the Roman world as a faithful allied, maintaining a certain administrative freedom. In [[89 BC]]E it was recognized as ''civitas'' ("city") and in [[41 BC]]E received the Roman citizenship. The Roman Brixia had at least three temples, an aqueduct, an [[amphitheater]], a forum with a further temple built under [[Vespasianus]], and some baths.

When [[Constantine]] advanced against [[Maxentius]] in 312, an engagement took place at Brescia in which the enemy was forced to retreat as far as [[Verona]]. In 402 the city was ravaged by the [[Visigoth]]s of [[Alarich I]]. During the invasion of the [[Huns]] under [[Attila]], the city was again besieged and sacked (452) while, some forty years later, it was one of the first conquests of the Goth general [[Teoderich the Great]] in his war against [[Odoacer]].

===Medieval history===
In 568 or 569 Brescia was occupied by the [[Lombards]], who made it the capital of one of their semi-independent duchies. First duke was one Alachis, who died in 573. Later dukes included the future king [[Rotharis]] and [[Rodoald]], and Alachis II, a fervent anti-Catholic who was killed in the batte of [[Cornate d'Adda]] (688). The last king of the Lombard, [[Desiderius]], had been also duke of Brescia. In 774 [[Charlemagne]] captured the city and ended the existence of the Lombard kingdom in northern Italy. 

Notingus was the first (prince-)bishop (in 844) who bore the title of [[Count]] (see [[Bishopric of Brescia]]). Later the power of the bishop as imperial representative was gradually defied by the local citizens and nobles, Brescia becoming a free commune around the early 12th century. Subsequently it expanded in the nearby countryside, first at the expenses of the local landholders, and later against the neighbouring communes, notably [[Bergamo]] and [[Cremona]]. Brescia defeated the latter two times at [[Pontoglio]], and then at the Grumore (mid-12th century) and in the battle of the Malamorte (1192).
 
In the successive struggles between the Lombard cities and the emperors, Brescia was implicated in some of the leagues and in all of the uprisings against them. In the [[Battle of Legnano]] the contingent from Brescia was the second in size after that of [[Milan]]. The [[Peace of Constance]] (1183) that ended the war with [[Frederick Barbarossa]] confirmed officially the free status of the commune. Memorable is also the [[siege of Brescia|siege]] laid to Brescia by the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in 1238 on account of the part taken by this city in the [[battle of Cortenova]] ([[27 November]], [[1237]]). Brescia came through this assault victorious. After the fall of the [[Hohenstaufen]], republican institutions declined at Brescia as in the other free cities and the leadership was contested between powerful families, chief among them the Maggi and the Brusati, the latter of the (pro-imperial, anti-papal) [[Ghibelline]] party. 

In 1311 [[Emperor Henry VII]] laid siege to Brescia for six months, losing three-fourths of his army. Later the [[Scaligeri]] of Verona, aided by the exiled Ghibellines, sought to place Brescia under subjection. The citizens of Brescia then recoursed to John of Luxemburg, but [[Mastino II della Scala]] expelled the governor appointed by him. His mastery was soon contested by the Visconti of Milan, but not even their rule was undisputed, as [[Pandolfo Malatesta]] in 1406 took possession of the city, but in 1416 bartered it to [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], who in 1426 sold it to the Venetians. The Milanese nobles forced Filippo to resume hostilities against the Venetians, and thus to attempt the recovery of this city, but he was defeated in the battle of [[Maclodio]] (1427), near Brescia. In 1439 Brescia was once more besieged by [[Francesco Sforza]], captain of the Venetians, who defeated [[Niccolò Piccinino]], Filippo's [[condottiero]]. Thenceforward Brescia acknowledged the authority of Venice, with the exception of the years between 1512 and 1520, when it was occupied by the French armies. It subsequently shared the fortunes of the Venetian republic until 1796.

===Modern history===
{{sect-stub}}
After the end of the [[Napoleon]]ic era, Brescia was annexed to the Austrian puppet state called [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]. It distinguished for the revolt called the [[Ten Days of Brescia]] (march 1849), for which the poet [[Giosuè Carducci]] called it "Leonessa d'Italia" ("Italian Lionesse").

Brescia was annexed to Italy in 1859.

The city was awarded a Gold Medal for its resistance against Fascism, in the late [[World War II]]. 

On [[May 28]], [[1974]], it was the seat of the bloody [[Piazza della Loggia bombing]].
