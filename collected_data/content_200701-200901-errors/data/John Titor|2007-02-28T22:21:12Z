'''John Titor''' is the name used by the person or persons claiming to be a [[time travel]]er from the year [[2036]] who posted on several time-travel–related [[bulletin board]]s during 2000/2001, making many ambiguous predictions about events in the near future — all [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] due to restrictions forwarded in Titor's framing narrative — and giving an account of a supposed native time period. Proponents of Titor believe his claims cannot be substantiated due to the complex nature of the 'multiple time-line' theory. Whether or not John Titor was a [[hoax]] has been a topic of controversy on web-based [[Anomalous phenomenon|paranormal]] [[Internet forum|discussion board]]s. He has also been discussed occasionally on the radio show [[Coast to Coast AM]].

==Information about his life==
He was supposedly born in [[1998]] (as indicated in [[2000]]
when he said he saw his 2-year-old self). He is allegedly a soldier in a military group of the [[USA]].

When asked if John Titor was ''his'' real name, he responded that John Titor is ''a'' real name. 

At one point, Titor stated that he was a 13 year old soldier in 2015 during WWIII. On another occasion, however, he stated that he was a frightened 14 year old  boy in 2012 hiding during the 7th year of the USA civil war.

==Predictions and contradictions==
In his online postings, Titor claimed to be a serving [[soldier]] who was assigned to a government time travel project. He was supposedly sent from 2036 back to 1975 to retrieve an [[IBM 5100]] computer which he claimed was needed to "debug" various legacy computer programs in 2036. The postings also described various future events between 2004 and 2037, including [[World War III]] (predicted for [[2015]]) followed by two decades of recovery.

One such entry cited escalating conflict between Arabs and Jews as a harbinger of [[World War III]]:

:"Real disruptions in world events begin with the destabilization of the West as a result of degrading US foreign policy and consistency. [...] The Jewish population in Israel is not prepared for a true offensive war. They are prepared for the ultimate defense. Wavering western support for Israel is what gives Israel's neighbors the confidence to attack. The last resort for a defensive Israel and its offensive Arab neighbors is to use weapons of mass destruction. In the grand scheme of things, the war in the Middle East is a part of what's to come, not the cause."

Along with this report of World War III's approach, another notable claim was that of a [[Civil war]] in America, which was slated to begin in 2004, around the time of the presidential election, and would escalate until 2008, which, according to Titor, "[is] a general date by which time everyone will realize the world they thought they were living in was over."

Another claim was that 2004 would be the last year in which the [[Olympic Games]] would occur — this proving contrary to subsequent real-world events as the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] were successfully held in February, 2006. In light of such predictive failings, some have speculated ''[[logical fallacies|ex post facto]]'' that the history relayed by Titor could have referred to one possible course for the future, suggesting that humans may have since created an alternate future by going about things differently; this [[apologist|apologetic]] approach is exemplary of the more forgiving interpretations for Titor's specific errors. 

According to IBM engineer Bob Dubke, Titor's statements regarding the [[IBM 5100]]'s ability to emulate and debug mainframe systems were correct. This information was not publicly available when Titor made his declaration, which has led to speculation that the person posing as Titor must have been linked somehow to the development of this system. (see "Secrets of the City" in external links for more information.)

When questioned about the mechanisms of time travelling, Titor answered that he was no engineer. When asked to provide a better picture of his time machine, he replied that he wasn't a photographer. When asked to use the time machine to perform some paradoxical action (e.g., [[Grandfather Paradox|kill his grandfather]]), he replied that that would only affect this universe, but not his. He appeared to imply that there were many worldlines, and his time machine could not control its outgoing destination exactly, but could return to a worldline exactly similar to his own home. (It would be a different "[[Worldline]]" but would be exactly the same in his perspective as when he left). His originating "worldline" would, in turn, receive a John Titor exactly similar to the original. Therefore, his original "worldline" would indeed receive the benefit of his mission.

The "worldline" theory resembles the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]], although his use of the term is different from physicists' use of [[worldline]], which refers to the path of an object through four-dimensional [[spacetime]], not to an entire universe or history (what the many-worlds interpretation would just call a 'world').

==Summary==
These are taken from [http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/the_john_titor_project.html John Titor's original statements] and summarised.
* 2004 would be the last official Olympics due to global conflicts.
* A Second American Civil War from 2004 to 2018 dividing the large cities against the rural areas
* An event similar to the "[[Passage of the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]]" will occur in 2012.
* [[Association Football]] ([[Soccer]]) becomes the most popular sport in the [[United States]]. 
* Third World War in 2015, a gradual global escalation that was ended by [[Russia]] bombing American, European, and Chinese cities.
** Sometime before this point (referred to as "N-Day") China forcefully annexes [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Taiwan]].
** [[Chemical weapons|Chemical]] and [[Biological weapons]] are used, and some "[[non-lethal]]" weapons turned out to be quite lethal.
** [[Australia]] successfully repels a Chinese invasion.
** The war kills almost 3 billion people.
* Post-war 
** Communities of survivors gather and grow around [[library|libraries]] and [[university|universities]].
** The [[United States]] splits into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives.
** The [[US Constitution]] is changed by a Constitutional Congress.
*** A [[President]] is elected for each of the five major areas of the US.
*** The powers of the union government are more defined and reside at the county and state level. 
*** The [[Vice President]] is elected separately.
*** The US Capital is in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]].
* Life in 2036:
** [[Society]]

*** [[Capital Punishment]] is still implemented.
*** Communities have returned to a family/community centred state, advised by elders.
*** [[Texas]] is Hispanicized.
** [[Religion]] and [[Beliefs]]
*** Religion is far more personal and plays a major part in day-to-day life.
*** The [[Ten Commandments]] have been restored to the "10" that God gave [[Moses]].
*** [[Sabbatarianism]], or worship on Saturday is a common practice. 
** [[Technology]]
*** [[Wireless network|Wireless internet]] is ubiquitous.
*** [[Television]] and [[Telephony]] are delivered via the Web.
*** Books and other hard media are now distributed online and printed from local hubs.
*** [[Microsoft]] and [[Yahoo!]] no longer exist. [[Napster]] still distributes music via the web.
*** [[Electricity|Power]] is not distributed over long distances. [[Alternate energy#Renewable energy|Alternate forms]] of generation are common, the most prevalent being [[Solar power|solar]].
** [[Natural environment|Environment]]
*** The environment is heavily affected by [[radiation]]. The lack of [[potable water]] is the biggest environmental issue.
*** [[Global Warming]] has had little effect. [[Temperature]] is about the same although there were anomalies after the war.
** Health
