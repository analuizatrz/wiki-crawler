The '''International Space Station''' ('''ISS''') is a research facility currently being [[ISS assembly sequence|assembled]] in [[space]]. The station is in a [[low Earth orbit]] and [[ISS#Sightings|can be seen from earth]] with the [[Naked_eye#Naked_eye_in_astronomy|naked eye]]: its altitude varies from 319.6 km to 346.9 km above the surface of the [[Earth]] (approximately 199 miles to 215 miles). It travels at an [[Velocity|average speed]] of 27,744 km (17,240 miles) per hour, completing 15.7 orbits per day. The ISS is a joint project between the space agencies of the [[United States]] ([[NASA]]), [[Russia]] ([[Russian Federal Space Agency|RKA]]), [[Japan]] ([[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]]), [[Canada]] ([[Canadian Space Agency|CSA]]) and several [[Europe]]an countries ([[European Space Agency|ESA]]).<ref>10 of its member states are currently participating; [[Austria]], [[Finland]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Portugal]], and the [[United Kingdom]] chose not to participate; [[Greece]] and [[Luxembourg]] joined ESA later.{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html|title=ESA - Human Spaceflight and Exploration - European Participating States|accessdate=2005-07-03|publisher=ESA|language=English}}</ref>

The [[Brazilian Space Agency]] (AEB, [[Brazil]]) participates through a separate contract with NASA. The [[Italian Space Agency]] similarly has separate contracts for various activities not done in the framework of ESA's ISS works (where [[Italy]] also fully participates).  [[China]] has reportedly expressed interest in the project, especially if they are able to work with the RKA.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.spacedaily.com/news/china-01zd.html | title = China Eyes Entry to ISS Project| date = May 1, 2001 | accessdate = 2007-06-26 | publisher = Space Daily}}</ref>  They have not been invited to become involved, however. 

The ISS is a continuation of what began as the U.S. [[Space Station Freedom]], the funding for which was cut back severely. It represents a merger of Freedom with several other previously planned space stations: Russia's [[Mir-2|Mir 2]], the planned European [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] and the Japanese [[Japanese Experiment Module|Experiment Module]]. The projected completion date is 2010, with the station remaining in operation until around 2016.   As of 2007, the ISS is already larger than any previous space station.

The ISS has been continuously inhabited since [[Expedition 1|the first resident crew]] entered the station on [[November 2]] [[2000]], thereby providing a permanent human presence in space. The crew of [[Expedition 15]] are currently aboard. The station is serviced primarily by Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] and [[Progress spacecraft]] and by U.S. [[Space Shuttle]] orbiters. At present the station has a capacity for a crew of three. Early crewmembers all came from the Russian and U.S. space programs.  German ESA astronaut [[Thomas Reiter]] joined the [[Expedition 13]] crew in July 2006, becoming the first crewmember from another [[List of space agencies|space agency]]. The station has, however, been visited by [[List of International Space Station visitors|astronauts from 14 countries]], and the [[Expedition 16]] crew will include members from all five space agencies that form the ISS partnership. The ISS was also the destination of the first five [[Space tourism|space tourist]]s.

==Origins==
[[Image:Unity-Zarya-Zvezda STS-106.jpg|thumb|left|170px|ISS configuration as of 2000: from top to bottom, the Unity, Zarya, and Zvezda modules.]]
In the early 1980s, NASA planned [[Space Station Freedom]] as a counterpart to the Soviet [[Salyut]] and [[Mir]] space stations. It never left the drawing board and, with the end of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Cold War]], it was cancelled. The end of the [[Space race]] prompted the U.S. administration officials to start negotiations with international partners Europe, Russia, Japan and Canada in the early 1990s in order to build a truly international space station. This project was first announced in 1993 and was called Space Station Alpha.<ref name="gao">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/151975.pdf |title=''Space Station: Impact of the Expanded Russian Role on Funding and Research''|accessdate=2006-11-03 |author=GAO |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=1994 |month=June |format=PDF |work= |publisher=GAO |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> It was planned to combine the proposed space stations of all participating space agencies: NASA's [[Space Station Freedom]], Russia's [[Mir-2]] (the successor to the [[Mir Space Station]], the core of which is now [[Zvezda (ISS)|Zvezda]]) and ESA's [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] that was planned to be a stand-alone spacelab.

The first section, the [[Zarya|Zarya Functional Cargo Block]], was put in orbit in November 1998 on a Russian [[Proton rocket]]. Two further pieces (the [[Unity Module]] and [[Zvezda (ISS)|Zvezda service module]]) were added before the first crew, [[Expedition 1]], was sent. [[Expedition 1]] docked to the ISS on [[November 2]], [[2000]], and consisted of U.S. [[astronaut]] [[William Shepherd]] and two Russian cosmonauts, [[Yuri Gidzenko]] and [[Sergei Krikalev]].

==Assembly==
{{see also|ISS assembly sequence}}

[[Image:ISSMockupHouston.JPG|thumb|right|250px|International Space Station [[mockup]] at [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]]]]

''Zarya'', the first ISS module, was launched by a [[Proton rocket]] in November 1998. The [[STS-88]] shuttle mission followed two weeks after ''Zarya'' was launched, bringing ''Unity'', the first of three node modules, and connecting it to ''Zarya''. This bare 2-module core of the ISS remained unmanned for the next one and a half years, until in July 2000 the Russian module ''Zvezda'' was added, allowing a minimum crew of two astronauts or cosmonauts to be  on the ISS permanently. Since 2000, the only main pressurized module delivered to the ISS was the [[Destiny Laboratory Module]] by [[STS-98]] in 2001. 

When assembly is complete, the ISS will have a pressurized volume of approximately 1,000 cubic meters, a mass of approximately 400,000 kilograms, approximately 100 kilowatts of power output, a truss 108.4 meters long, modules 74 meters long, and a crew of six. Building the complete station will require more than 40 assembly flights. Of these flights, currently 33 are planned to be Space Shuttle flights, with 21 ISS-shuttle flights currently flown and 13 more planned between 2007 and 2010. Other assembly flights consist of modules lifted by the Russian [[Proton rocket]] or in the case of the [[ISS docking compartment|Pirs Airlock]] by a [[Soyuz launch vehicle|Soyuz]] rocket.

In addition to the assembly and utilization flights, approximately 30 [[Progress spacecraft]] flights are required to provide logistics until 2010. Experimental equipment, fuel and consumables are and will be delivered by all vehicles visiting the ISS: the Shuttle, the Russian Progress, the European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] (prospectively from January 2008 onwards) and the Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]]. 

The [[space station]] is located in [[orbit]] around the [[Earth]] at an altitude of approximately 360 [[kilometre|km]] (220 miles), a type of orbit usually termed [[low Earth orbit]] (the actual height varies over time by several kilometers due to [[atmospheric drag]] and re-boosts). It orbits Earth in a [[Orbital period|period]] of about 90 minutes; by November 2006 it had completed more than 45,500 orbits since launch of the [[Zarya|Zarya module]] on [[November 20]] [[1998]].

The ISS, when completed, will be essentially made of a set of communicating pressurized modules connected to a [[Integrated Truss Structure|truss]], on which are attached four large pairs of [[photovoltaic]] modules (solar panels). The pressurized modules and the truss will be perpendicular: the truss spanning from [[starboard]] to [[Port (nautical)|port]] and the habitable zone extending on the [[aft]]-forward axis. Although during the construction the station [[Attitude control|attitude]] may vary, when all four photovoltaic modules are in their definitive position the aft-forward axis will be parallel to the velocity vector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/flash/iss_attitude.html|title=What are the ISS attitudes?|accessdate=2006-09-11|format=Flash|publisher=NASA|language=English}}</ref>

A total of 10 main pressurized modules (''[[Zarya]]'', [[Zvezda (ISS)|''Zvezda'']], [[Destiny Laboratory Module|''Destiny'']], [[Unity Module|''Unity'']] (previously called Node 1), [[Harmony Module|''Harmony'']] (previously called Node 2), [[Node 3]], [[Columbus Laboratory Module|''Columbus'']], [[Japanese Experiment Module|''Kibo'']], the [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module|MLM]] and the [[Russian Research Module|RM]]) are currently scheduled to be part of the ISS by its completion date in 2010.<ref name="launch manifest">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/iss_manifest.html|title=NASA - Consolidated Launch Manifest|accessdate=2006-07-15|language=English|publisher=NASA}}</ref> A number of smaller pressurized sections will be adjunct to them ([[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] spacecrafts (permanently 2 as lifeboats - 6 months rotations), [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] transporters (2 or more), the [[Joint Airlock|Quest]] and [[Pirs docking compartment|Pirs]] airlocks, as well as periodically the [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]], the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] and the [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]]).

<!-- Do functional descriptions belong in the assembly section?
''Destiny'' was the first science module delivered to the ISS, whereas Zarya provides electrical power, storage, propulsion, and guidance functions and [[Zvezda (ISS)|Zvezda]] provides living quarters, a life support system, a communication system, electrical power distribution, a data processing system, a flight control system, and a propulsion system. Node 1's primary function is to link different modules together; however, fluids, environmental control and life support systems, and electrical and data systems are also routed through Node 1 to supply work and living areas of the station.

===Columbia disaster and changes in construction plans===
[[Image:STS-107 launch.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] lifting off on its [[STS-107|final mission]].]]

====Disaster and consequences====
After the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] on [[February 1]] [[2003]], and the subsequent two and a half year suspension of the U.S. [[Space Shuttle program]], followed by problems with resuming flight operations in 2005, there was some uncertainty over the future of the ISS until 2006.

The Space Shuttle program resumed flight on [[July 26]] [[2005]], with the [[STS-114]] mission of [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']]. This mission to the ISS was intended both to test new safety measures implemented since the Columbia disaster, and to deliver supplies to the station. Although the mission succeeded safely, it was not without risk; foam was shed by the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]], leading NASA to announce future missions would be grounded until this issue was resolved. 

Between the Columbia disaster and the resumption of Shuttle launches, crew exchanges were carried out solely using the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]]. Starting with [[Expedition 7]], two-astronaut caretaker crews were launched in contrast to the previously launched crews of three. Because the ISS had not been visited by a shuttle for an extended period, a larger than planned amount of waste accumulated, temporarily hindering station operations in 2004. However [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] transports and the [[STS-114]] shuttle flight took care of this problem.

====Changes in construction plans====
[[Image:STS-116 spacewalk 1.jpg|right|thumb|300px| Upgrading the International Space Station over New Zealand]] 

ISS construction is now far behind the original planned schedule for completion in 2004 or 2005. This is mainly due to the halting of all NASA Shuttle flights following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]] in early 2003 (although there had been prior delays due partly to Shuttle problems, and partly to delays stemming from the Russian space agency's budget constraints). During the shuttle stand-down, construction of the ISS was halted and the science conducted aboard was limited due to the crew size of two.

As of the beginning of 2006, many changes were made to the originally planned ISS, even before the Columbia disaster.  Modules and other structures were cancelled or replaced and the number of Shuttle flights to the ISS was reduced from previously planned numbers. Still, the newest ISS Shuttle launch manifest and the current ISS design scheme reveal that more than 80% of the hardware intended to be part of the ISS in the late 90s is still planned to be orbited to the ISS by its scheduled completion date in 2010.

In March 2006, a meeting of the heads of the five participating space agencies accepted the new ISS construction schedule that plans to complete the ISS by 2010.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 3 March 2006 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/03/03/Navigation/177/205237/NASA+commits+to+Shuttle+missions+to+International+Space.html flightglobal.com | title = NASA commits to Shuttle missions to International Space Station | format = | work = International Space Station | publisher = FlightGlobal | accessmonthday = 16 September | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> A crew of six is expected to be established in 2009, after the Shuttle's next 12 construction flights following the second [[Return to Flight]] mission [[STS-121]]. Requirements for stepping up the crew size include enhanced environmental support on the ISS, a second Soyuz permanently docked on the station to function as a second 'lifeboat', more frequent Progress flights to provide double the amount of consumables, more fuel for orbit raising maneuvers, and a sufficient supply line of experimental equipment.

===Current assembled components===
[[Image:NASA-Krikalev-inside-ISS.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Cosmonaut [[Sergei Krikalev]] inside the [[Zvezda (ISS)|Zvezda Service Module]], November 2000]]

The ISS currently consists of four main pressurized modules: two Russian modules [[Zarya | ''Zarya'']] and [[Zvezda (ISS) | ''Zvezda'']], and two US modules [[Destiny Laboratory Module|''Destiny'']] and [[Unity Module|''Unity'']]. Other pressurized sections of the current configuration are the [[Quest Joint Airlock]] and the [[Pirs docking compartment]]. Spacecraft docked to the ISS also extend the pressurized volume. At least one Soyuz spacecraft is always docked as a 'lifeboat' and is replaced every six months by a new Soyuz as part of crew rotation.

[[Image:mplm in shuttle.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|[[March 10]] [[2001]] - The Leonardo [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]] rests in [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'s payload bay during [[STS-102]].]]
Although not permanently docked with the ISS, a [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]] (MPLM) forms part of the ISS during Shuttle missions that include an MPLM. The MPLM is attached to ''Unity'' and is used for resupply and logistics flights.

As of June 2007 the station consists of several modules and elements:

===Components to be launched===
{{main|Future components of the ISS}}
Nearly all already built pressurized modules are planned to be launched by the Space Shuttle. By the time the ISS is completed in 2010, it will have, in addition to the modules already in orbit:

* Two more node modules ([[Node 2|Harmony]] and [[Node 3]]).
* Three more laboratory modules (The [[Columbus Laboratory Module]], [[Japanese Experiment Module]] and [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module]]s).
* A [[Cupola (ISS)|cupola]].
* A [[Docking Cargo Module]] to assist in the docking of [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] and [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] spacecraft to the station.

In addition, there is also a large unpressurized [[Integrated Truss Structure|truss]] system partially in place that will eventually support the prominent [[ISS Solar Arrays|solar arrays]], as well as external experiments like the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] and the [[Plasma Contactor Unit]] [http://space-power.grc.nasa.gov/ppo/projects/iss/plasmacontactor.html].
An addition to unpressurized experiment accommodations on ISS is being developed by the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], called [[EXPRESS Logistics Carrier]], or ELC (formerly EXPRESS Pallet). "EXPRESS" stands for "EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to the Space Station". Several ELC units will be installed on the exterior of ISS to provide a home for space science experiments. ELC units provide not just a berth for experiments, but also provide power, heat, and command & [[telemetry]] links to experiments.

===Cancelled modules===
* [[Centrifuge Accommodations Module]] - would have been attached to Node 2, now named Harmony
* [[Universal Docking Module]] - replaced by [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module]]
* [[Docking and Stowage Module]] - replaced by [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module]]

==Major ISS Systems==

===Power supply===
{{main|Electrical system of the International Space Station}}
The source of [[Electric power|electrical power]] for the ISS is the sun: light is converted into electricity through the use of [[solar panels]]. Before assembly flight 4A (shuttle mission [[STS-97]], [[November 30]], [[2000]]) the only power source was the Russian solar panels attached to the [[Zarya]] and [[Zvezda (ISS)|Zvezda]] modules: the Russian segment of the station uses 28 [[volt]]s [[direct current|dc]] (like the [[Space Shuttle program|Shuttle]]). In the rest of the station, electricity is provided by the solar panels attached to the truss at a [[voltage]] ranging from 130 to 180 volts dc. The power is then stabilized and distributed at 160 volts dc and then converted to the user-required 124 volts dc. Power can be shared between the two segments of the station using converters, and this feature is essential since the cancellation of the Russian [[Science Power Platform]]: the Russian segment will depend on the U.S. built solar arrays for power supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/solar_arrays.htm|title=Boeing: Integrated Defense Systems - NASA Systems - International Space Station - Solar Power|accessdate=2006-06-05|publisher=Boeing|language=English}}</ref>

[[Image:Cycle.gif|thumb|left|250px|Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)]]
Using a [[High voltage|high-voltage]] (130 to 160 volts) distribution line in the so-called U.S. part of the station led to smaller power lines and thus weight savings.

===Life support===
The ISS [[Environmental Control and Life Support System]] provides or controls elements such as atmospheric pressure, oxygen levels, water, and fire extinguishing, among other things. The [[Elektron (ISS)|Elektron]] system generates oxygen aboard the station. The highest priority for the life support system is the ISS atmosphere, but the system also collects processes and stores water and waste used and produced by the crew. For example, the system recycles fluid from the sink, shower, urine, and condensation. [[Activated carbon|Activated charcoal]] filters are the primary method for removing byproducts of human metabolism from the air.

===Attitude control===
The attitude (orientation) of the station is maintained by either of two mechanisms. Normally, a system using several [[control moment gyroscope]]s (CMGs) keeps the station oriented, i.e. with ''Destiny'' forward of ''Unity'', the P truss on the port side and ''Pirs'' on the earth-facing (nadir) side. When the CMG system becomes saturated, it can lose its ability to control station attitude. If this happens, the Russian Attitude Control System can take over, using thrusters to maintain station attitude and allowing the CMG system to desaturate. This has happened automatically as a safety measure, as happened for example during [[Expedition 10]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2005/iss05-7.html | title = International Space Station Status Report #05-7 | date = Feb. 11, 2005 | publisher = NASA}}</ref> When a shuttle orbiter is docked to the station, it can also be used to maintain station attitude. This procedure was used during [[STS-117]] as the S3/S4 truss was being installed.

==Scientific research==
One of the main goals of the ISS is to provide a place to conduct experiments that require one or more of the unusual conditions present on the station.  The main fields of research include [[biology]] (including [[biomedical research]] and [[biotechnology]]), [[physics]] (including [[fluid physics]], [[materials science]], and [[quantum physics]]), [[astronomy]] (including [[cosmology]]), and [[meteorology]].<ref name="NASA Fields of Research">{{cite web | url = http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/A-fieldsresearch/index.html | title = Fields of Research | date = June 26, 2007 | publisher = NASA}}</ref>   <ref name="NASA ISS Goals">{{cite web | url = http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/B-gettingonboard/index.html | title = Getting on Board | date = June 26, 2007 | publisher = NASA}}</ref>  As of 2007, little experimentation other than the study of the long-term effects of microgravity on humans has taken place.  With four new research modules set to arrive at the ISS by 2010, however, more specialized research is expected to begin.
[[image:ESA Columbus module.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Columbus'' will be one of the most prominent research laboratories when it is completed.]]

===Scientific ISS modules===
The [[Destiny Laboratory Module]] is the main research facility currently aboard the ISS.  Produced by [[NASA]] and launched in February 2001, it is a research facility for general experiments.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/destiny.html | title = NASA - U.S. Destiny Laboratory | date = March 26, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-06-26 | publisher = NASA}}</ref> The [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus module]] is another research facility, though it was designed by the [[European Space Agency|ESA]] for the ISS.  Its purpose is to facilitate scientific experiments and is set to be launched into space with the [[STS-122]] shuttle launch on [[December 6]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts122/ | title = NASA - STS-122 | accessdate = 2007-06-26 | date = June 26, 2007 | publisher = NASA}}</ref> It should provide a [[European Drawer Rack|generic laboratory]] as well as ones specifically designed for [[Biolab|biology]], [[European Physiology Modules|biomedical research]], and [[Fluid Science Laboratory|fluid physics]].  There are also a number of planned expansions that will be implemented to study [[quantum physics]] and [[cosmology]].  The [[Japanese Experiment Module]], also known as ''Kibō'', is scheduled to be in space after the [[STS-127]] launch in or around January, 2009.  It is being developed by [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]] in order to function as an observatory and to measure various astronomical data.  The [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]], developed by [[NASA]], is set to be launched for the ISS with the [[STS-129]] mission, which is expected to take place no earlier than [[September 11]], [[2009]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sworld.com.au/steven/space/shuttle/manifest.txt | title = Unofficial Space Shuttle Manifest | accessdate = 2007-06-26 | date = June 25, 2007 | publisher = Small World Communications}}</ref> It will allow experiments to be deployed and conducted in the vacuum of space and will provide the necessary electricity and computing to locally process data from experiments.  The [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module]], created by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency|RKA]], is expected to launch for the ISS in late 2009.  It will supply the proper resources for general microgravity experiments.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.khrunichev.ru/khrunichev_eng/live/full_mks.asp?id=13190
| title = KHRUNICHEV STATE RESEARCH AND PRODUCTION SPACE CENTRE | accessdate = 2007-06-26 | date = 2006 | publisher = Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center}}</ref>

A couple of planned research modules have been cancelled, including the [[Centrifuge Accommodations Module]] (used to produce varying levels of [[artificial gravity]]) and the [[Russian Research Module]] (used for general experimentation).  Several planned experiments, such as the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]], have been cancelled as well.

===Areas of research===
<!-- http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/index.html and http://www.scipoc.msfc.nasa.gov/factchron2.html have more specific data on experiments that could be added here or on another page dedicated to the different experiments done. -->
There are a number of plans to study biology on the ISS. One goal is to improve our understanding of the effect of long-term space exposure on the human body.  Subjects such as [[muscle atrophy]], [[bone loss]], and fluid shifts are studied with the intention to utilize this data so [[space colonization]] and lengthy [[space travel]] can become feasible.  The effect of near-weightlessness on [[evolution]], development and growth, and the internal processes of plants and animals are also studied.  In response to recent data suggesting that microgravity enables the growth of three-dimensional human body-like tissues and that unusual protein crystals can be formed in space, NASA has indicated a desire to investigate these phenomena.<ref name="NASA Fields of Research" />

NASA would also like to study prominent problems in physics. The physics of fluids in microgravity are not completely understood, and researchers would like to be able to accurately model fluids in the future.  Additionally, since fluids in space can be combined nearly completely regardless of their relative weights, there is some interest in investigating the combination of fluids that would not mix well on Earth.  By examining reactions that are slowed down by low gravity and temperatures, scientists also hope to gain new insight concerning [[state of matter|states of matter]] (specifically in regards to [[superconductivity]]).<ref name="NASA Fields of Research" />

Additionally, researchers hope to examine [[combustion]] in the presence of less gravity than on Earth.  Any findings involving the efficiency of the burning or the creation of byproducts could improve the process of energy production, which would be of economic and environmental interest.  Scientists plan to use the ISS to examine [[aerosol]]s, [[ozone]], [[water vapor]], and [[oxide]]s in Earth's atmosphere as well as [[cosmic rays]], [[cosmic dust]], [[anti-matter]], and [[dark matter]] in the Universe.<ref name="NASA Fields of Research" />

The long-term goals of this research are to develop the technology necessary for human-based space and planetary exploration and colonization (including [[life support system]]s, safety precautions, environmental monitoring in space, etc.), new ways to treat diseases, more efficient methods of producing materials, accurate measurements with a precision impossible if done on Earth, a fuller concept of the Universe, and a new understanding from all experiments undertaken.<ref name="NASA Fields of Research" /> <ref name="NASA ISS Goals" />

==Major incidents==

===2003 Columbia disaster===
After the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] on [[February 1]] [[2003]], and the subsequent two and a half year suspension of the U.S. [[Space Shuttle program]], followed by problems with resuming flight operations in 2005, there was some uncertainty over the future of the ISS until 2006.  Between the Columbia disaster and the resumption of Shuttle launches, crew exchanges were carried out solely using the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]]. Starting with [[Expedition 7]], two-astronaut caretaker crews were launched in contrast to the previously launched crews of three. Because the ISS had not been visited by a shuttle for an extended period, a larger than planned amount of waste accumulated, temporarily hindering station operations in 2004. However [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] transports and the [[STS-114]] shuttle flight took care of this problem.

===2006 Smoke problem===
On [[September 18]] [[2006]], the [[Expedition 13]] crew activated a smoke alarm in the Russian segment of the International Space Station when fumes from one of three oxygen generator triggered momentary fear about a possible fire. Flight engineer [[Jeffrey Williams]] reported an unusual smell, but officials said there was no fire and the crew was not in any danger.

The crew reported at first smoke in the cabin and a smell. It turns out what was happening was a leak of potassium hydroxide from an oxygen vent. The equipment was turned off. [[Potassium hydroxide]] is odorless and the smell reported by Williams more likely was associated with an overheated rubber gasket in the [[Elektron (ISS)|Elektron]] system.

In any case, the station's ventilation system was shut down to prevent the spread of smoke or contaminants through the rest of the lab complex. A charcoal air filter was put in place to help scrub the atmosphere of any lingering potassium hydroxide fumes. The space station's program manager said the crew never donned gas masks, but as a precaution puts on surgical gloves and masks to prevent contact with any contaminants.<ref>

===2007 computer failure===
On [[14 June]] [[2007]] during [[Expedition 15]] and on flight day 7 of [[STS-117]]'s visit to ISS, a computer malfunction on the Russian segments at 06:30 UTC left the station without thrusters, oxygen generation, carbon dioxide scrubber, and other environmental control systems, which caused temperatures to rise.  A successful restart of the computers resulted in a false fire alarm which awakened the crew at 11:43 UTC.<ref>

Without the computer that controls the oxygen levels, the station had only 56 days of oxygen available.<ref name="wikinews computer failure">[[Wikinews:Shuttle mission may be extended further due to ISS computer failure]], [http://en.wikinews.org/w/index.php?title=Shuttle_mission_may_be_extended_further_due_to_ISS_computer_failure&oldid=444337 oldid=44437], 01:29, 16 June 2007</ref>  

By the afternoon of [[16 June]], ISS's program manager [[Michael Suffredini]] confirmed that all six computers governing command and navigation systems, including two thought to have failed, for Russian segments of the station were back online and will be tested within the next day or two.  The cooling system was the first system brought back online.  NASA believes the overcurrent protection circuits designed to safeguard each computer from power spikes were at fault and that the leading theory is that they were tripped due to increased interference, or "noise," from the station's plasma environment related to the addition of massive new [[Integrated Truss Structure#P3/P4, S3/S4 truss assemblies|starboard trusses and solar arrays]].<ref name="space.com 070616"/>  Analysis of the failure continues for both the Station itself and by [[ESA]] for the [[Columbus (ISS)|Columbus Laboratory Module]] and the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]], which use the same computer systems that were supplied by EADS [[Astrium Space Transportation]].<ref name="ISS computer woes concern Europe">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6763173.stm ISS computer woes concern Europe], Irene Klotz, [[BBC]], Last Updated: Monday, 18 June 2007, 10:29 GMT 11:29 UK</ref>  According to NASA's Michael Suffredini, evidence suggests the plasma field shifted when the station's shape changed with the addition of the new truss segment and that "As the station gets bigger, this potential will continue to grow" and that "the Russians have noted some changes in their systems as we have grown."<ref name="ISS computer woes concern Europe"/>

The number of distinct visitors of the ISS is 124 (see [[list of International Space Station visitors]]).

{{International Space Station}}

==Legal aspects==
===Agreement===
[[Image:ISS Agreements hi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover page of the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement signed on January 28, 1998]]

The legal structure that regulates the space station is multi-layered. The primary layer establishing obligations and rights between the ISS partners is the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA), an international treaty signed on [[January 28]] [[1998]] by fifteen governments involved in the Space Station project. The ISS consists of the United States, Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, and eleven Member States of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom). Article 1 outlines its purpose:

''This Agreement is a long term international co-operative framework on the basis of genuine partnership, for the detailed design, development, operation, and utilisation of a permanently inhabited civil Space Station for peaceful purposes, in accordance with international law''.<ref name = "legal framework">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 20 July 2001 | url = http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAH7O0VMOC_iss_0.html | title = International Space Station Legal Framework | format = | work = International Space Station | publisher = European Space Agency | accessmonthday = 16 September | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

The IGA sets the stage for a second layer of agreements between the partners referred to as 'Memoranda of Understanding' (MOUs), of which four exist between NASA and each of the four other partners. There are no MOUs between ESA, Roskosmos, CSA and JAXA due to the fact that NASA is the designated ''manager'' of the ISS. The MOUs are used to describe the roles and responsibilities of the partners in more detail.

A third layer consists of bartered contractual agreements or the trading of the partners' rights and duties, including the 2005 commercial framework agreement between NASA and [[Roskosmos]] that sets forth the terms and conditions under which NASA purchases seats on Soyuz crew transporters and cargo capacity on unmanned [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] transporters.

A fourth legal layer of agreements implements and supplements the four MOUs further. Notably among them is the ISS code of conduct, setting out [[criminal jurisdiction]], anti-harassment and certain other behavior rules for ISS crewmembers.<ref>{{cite web | last = Farand | first = Andre | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://portal.unesco.org/shs/en/file_download.php/785db0eec4e0cdfc43e1923624154cccFarand.pdf| title = Astronauts’ behaviour onboard the International Space Station: regulatory framework | format = pdf | work = International Space Station | publisher = UNESCO | accessmonthday = 16 September | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

===Utilization===
[[Image:Helms.window.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The nadir window in the Destiny lab]]
[[Image:Interior of Zarya ISS mudule.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Zarya module]]

There is no fixed percentage of ownership for the whole space station. Rather Article 5 of the IGA sets forth that ''each partner shall retain jurisdiction and control over the elements it registers and over personnel in or on the Space Station who are its nationals''.<ref name = "legal framework"/> Therefore, for each ISS module only one partner retains sole ownership. Still, the agreements to use the space station facilities are more complex.

The three planned Russian segments [[Zvezda (ISS)|Zvezda]], the [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module]] and the [[Russian Research Module]]s are made and owned by Russia, which, as of today, also retains its current and prospective usage ([[Zarya]], although constructed and launched by Russia, has been paid for and is officially owned by NASA). In order to use the Russian parts of the station, the partners use bilateral agreements (third and fourth layer of the above outlined legal structure). The rest of the station, (the U.S., the European and Japanese pressurized modules as well as the truss and solar panel structure and the two robotic arms) has been agreed to be utilized as follows (% refers to time that each structure may be used by each partner): 

# [[Columbus Laboratory Module|Columbus]]: 51% for ESA, 49% for NASA and [[Canadian Space Agency|CSA]] (CSA has agreed with NASA to use 2.3% of all non-Russian ISS structure) 
# [[Japanese Experiment Module|Kibo]]: 51% for [[JAXA]], 49% for NASA and CSA (2.3%)
# [[Destiny Laboratory Module|Destiny Lab]]: 100% for NASA and CSA (2.3%) as well as 100% of the truss payload accommodation
# Crew time and power from the solar panel structure, as well as rights to purchase supporting services (upload/download and communication services) 76.6% for NASA, 12.8% for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA and 2.3% for CSA

==Costs==
The ISS has been, as of today, far more expensive than originally anticipated. The ESA estimates the overall cost from the start of the project in the late 1980s to the prospective end in 2010 to be in the region of [[United States dollar|$]]130 billion ([[Euro|€]]100 billion).<ref name = "costs">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 9 August 2005 | url = http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAQHA0VMOC_iss_0.html | title = How Much Does It Cost? | format = | work = International Space Station | publisher = European Space Agency | accessmonthday = 18 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Giving a precise cost estimate for the ISS is, however, not straightforward; it is, for instance, hard to determine which costs should actually be contributed to the ISS program or how the Russian contribution should be measured, as the Russian space agency runs at considerably lower USD costs than the other partners.

===NASA===
====Overview====
[[Image:Nasabudget.gif|thumb|right|250px|NASA's budget projections currently see an end to ISS funding in 2017 in order to free funds for the [[Vision for Space Exploration]]]]
The overall majority of costs for NASA are incurred by flight operations and expenses for the overall management of the ISS. Costs for initially building the U.S. portion of the ISS modules and external structure on the ground and construction in space as well as crew and supply flights to the ISS do account for far less than the general operating costs ''(see [[#2005 ISS budget allocation|annual budget allocation below]])''. 

NASA does not include the basic Space Shuttle program costs in the expenses incurred for the ISS program, despite the fact that the Space Shuttle has been nearly exclusively used for ISS construction and supply flights since December 1998. 

NASA's 2007 budget request lists costs for the ISS (without Shuttle costs) as $25.6 billion for the years 1994 to 2005.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/about/budget/index.html | title = NASA 2007 Budget and 2006 Strategic Plan | format = | work = International Space Station | publisher = NASA | accessmonthday = 16 September | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> For each of 2005 and 2006 about $1.7 to 1.8 billion are allocated to the ISS program. The annual expenses will increase until 2010 when they will reach $2.3 billion and should then stay at the same level, however inflation-adjusted, until 2016, the defined end of the program. NASA has allocated between $300 and 500 million for program shutdown costs in 2017.

====2005 ISS budget allocation====
[[Image:STS-114 Steve Robinson on Canadarm2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|NASA allocates about 125 million US dollars annually to EVAs]]
The $1.8 billion expensed in 2005 consisted of:<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2005 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/55411main_28%20ISS.pdf | title = International Space Station Major Events FY 2005 | format = | work = International Space Station | publisher = NASA | accessmonthday = 16 September | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>
*'''Development of new hardware''': $70 million were allocated to core development, for instance development of systems like navigation, data support or environmental.
*'''Spacecraft Operations''': $800 million consisting of $125 million for each of software, extravehicular activity systems, and logistics and maintenance. An additional $150 million is spent on flight, avionics and crew systems. The rest of $250 million goes to overall ISS management.
*'''Launch and Mission operations''': Although the Shuttle launch costs are not considered part of the ISS budget, mission and mission integration ($300 million), medical support ($25 million) and Shuttle launch site processing ($125 million) is within the ISS budget.
*'''Operations Program Integration''': $350 million was spent on maintaining and sustaining U.S. flight and ground hardware and software to ensure integrity of the ISS design and the continuous, safe operability.
*'''ISS cargo/crew''': $140 million was spent for purchase of supplies, cargo and crew capability for Progress and Soyuz flights.

====Shuttle costs as part of ISS costs====
[[Image:Upgrading Hubble during SM1-2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The only non-ISS related Shuttle flight between 2006 and 2010 will be a [[Hubble Space Telescope]] servicing mission in 2008]]
Only costs for mission and mission integration and launch site processing for the 33 ISS-related Shuttle flights are included in NASA's ISS program costs. Basic costs of the Shuttle program are, as mentioned above, not considered part of the overall ISS costs by NASA, because the Shuttle program is considered an independent program aside from the ISS. Since December 1998 the Shuttle has, however, been used nearly exclusively for ISS flights (since the first ISS flight in December 1998, until December 2006 only 5 flights out of 25 flights have not been to the ISS, and only the planned [[Hubble Space Telescope]] servicing mission (see [[STS-125]]) in 2008 will not be ISS-related out of 14 planned missions until the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2010). 

Shuttle program costs during ISS operations from 1999 to 2005 (disregarding the first ISS flight in December 1998) have amounted to approximately $24 billion (1999: $3,028.0 million, 2000: $3,011.2 million, 2001: $3,125.7 million, 2002: $3,278.8 million, 2003: $3,252.8 million, 2004: $3,945.0 million, 2005: $4,319.2 million). In order to derive the ISS-related costs, expenses for non-ISS flights need to be subtracted, which amount to 20% of the total or about $5 billion. For the years 2006-2011 NASA projects another $20.5 billion in Space Shuttle program costs (2006: $4,777.5 million, 2007: $4,056.7 million, 2008: $4,087.3 million, 2009: $3,794.8 million, 2010: $3,651.1 million and 2011: $146.7 million). If the Hubble servicing mission is excluded from those costs, ISS-related costs will be approximately $19 billion for Shuttle flights from 2006 until 2011. In total, ISS-related Space Shuttle program costs will therefore be approximately $38 billion.

====Overall ISS costs for NASA==== 
Assuming NASA's projections of average costs of $2.5 billion from 2011 to 2016 and the end of spending money on the ISS in 2017 (about $300-500 million) after shutdown in 2016 are correct, the overall ISS project costs for NASA from the announcement of the program in 1993 to its end will be about $53 billion (25.6 billion for the years 1994-2005 and about 27 to 28 billion for the years 2006-2017).

There have also been considerable costs for designing [[Space Station Freedom]] in the 1980s and early 1990s, before the ISS program started in 1993. Plans of Space Station Freedom were reused for the International Space Station. 

To sum up, although the actual costs NASA views as connected to the ISS are only half of the $100 billion figure often cited in the media, if combined with basic program costs for the Shuttle and the design of the ISS' precursor project Space Station Freedom, the costs reach $100 billion for NASA alone.

===ESA===
ESA calculates that its contribution over the 30 year lifetime of the project will be €8 billion.<ref> [http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAQHA0VMOC_iss_0.html ESA: ISS Human Spaceflight and Exploration] </ref> The costs for the Columbus Laboratory total more than €1 billion already, costs for [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] development total several hundred million and considering that each [[Ariane 5]] launch costs around €150 million, each ATV launch will incur considerable costs as well. In addition ESA has constructed a [[ground control station]] in the South of Germany in order to control the Columbus Laboratory.

===JAXA===
The development of the Kibo Laboratory, JAXA's main contribution to the ISS, has cost about 325 billion yen (about $2.8 billion)<ref>[http://www.cnes-tv.net/cnes_fr/cnesmag/cnesmag24_etranger.pdf Etranger World: Major Changes for Japan's space sector]</ref> In the year 2005, JAXA allocated about 40 billion yen (about 350 million USD) to the ISS program.<ref>[http://www.space.com/spacenews/archive04/budgetarch_090704.html Space News: Japan Seeking 13 Percent Budget Hike for Space Activities]</ref> The annual running costs for Kibo will total around $350 to 400 million. In addition JAXA has committed itself to develop and launch the HTV-Transporter, for which development costs total nearly $1 billion. In total, over the 24 year lifespan of the ISS program, JAXA will contribute well over $10 billion to the ISS program.

===Roskosmos===
A considerable part of the [[Russian Space Agency]]'s budget is used for the ISS. Since 1998 there have been over two dozen Soyuz and Progress flights, the primary crew and cargo transporters since 2003. The question of how much Russia spends on the station (measured in [[United States dollar|USD]]), is, however, not easy to answer. The two modules currently in orbit are derivatives of the [[Mir]] program and therefore development costs are much lower than for other modules. In addition, the exchange rate between ruble and USD is not adequately giving a real comparison to what the costs for Russia really are.

===CSA===
Canada, whose main contribution to the ISS is the [[Mobile Servicing System|Canadarm2]], estimates that through the last 20 years it has contributed about [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1.4 billion to the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/iss/facts.asp |title= International Space Station facts and figures |accessdate=2007-01-28 |format= |work= }}</ref>

==Criticism==
{{quote|"NASA must complete the ISS so it can be dropped into the ocean on schedule in finished form."|[[Robert L. Park]]|[http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN07/wn060707.html]}}
The ISS and NASA have been the targets of varied criticism over the years. Critics believe that the time and money spent on the ISS could be better spent on other projects -- whether they be [[robotic spacecraft]] missions, space exploration, investigations of problems here on Earth, or just tax savings. <ref>{{cite news |title=A waste of space |url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=262429&area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__international_news/ |publisher= Mail & Guardian |accessdate=2007-01-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceprojects.com/iss/ |title=A "Station" in Space and NASA's Deceptions on Earth |accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref> Some critics, like Bob Park, argue that very little [[Scientific method|scientific]] [[research]] was convincingly planned for the ISS in the first place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN04/wn092404.html |title=Space Station: Maybe They Could Use It to Test Missile Defense|accessdate=2007-01-28 |last=Park |first=Bob}}</ref> They also argue that the primary feature of a space-based laboratory is its [[microgravity environment]], which can usually be more-cheaply studied with a [[Vomit Comet|vomit comet]] -- that is, an [[aircraft]] which flies in [[parabolic]] arcs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN06/wn091506.html |title=Space: International Space Station Unfurls New Solar Panels|accessdate=2007-06-15 |last=Park |first=Bob}}</ref>

[[Image:ISS Centrifuge Accommodations Module.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The (cancelled) ISS Centrifuge Accommodations Module]]
Two of the most ambitious ISS projects to date -- the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] and the [[Centrifuge Accommodations Module]], have both been cancelled due to the prohibitive costs NASA faces in simply completing the ISS. As a result, the research done on the ISS is generally limited to experiments which don't have a specialized apparatus. For example, in the first half of 2007, ISS research dealt primarily with human biological responses to being in space, covering topics like [[kidney stones]]<sup>[http://exploration.nasa.gov/programs/station/Renal-Stone.html]</sup>, [[circadian rhythm]]<sup>[http://exploration.nasa.gov/programs/station/Sleep-Long.html]</sup>, and the effects of [[cosmic rays]] on the [[nervous system]]<sup>[http://exploration.nasa.gov/programs/station/ALTEA.html]</sup>. Critics tend to believe that this sort of research is of little pragmatic value, since space exploration is today almost universally done by robots.

Other critics have attacked the ISS on some technical design grounds:
# [[Jeff Foust]] argued that the ISS requires too much maintenance, especially by risky, expensive [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]];<ref>[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/453/1 The trouble with space stations] [[Jeff Foust]], [[The Space Review]], [[12 September]] [[2005]]. Retrieved [[10 September]] [[2006]]. </ref>
# The Astronomical Society of the Pacific has mentioned that its orbit is rather highly inclined, which makes Russian launches cheaper, but US launches more expensive.<ref Name=astrosociety>[http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/34/space2.html Up, Up, and Away] www.astrosociety.org. Retrieved [[10 September]] [[2006]]. </ref> This was intended as a design point, to encourage Russian involvement with the ISS -- and Russian involvement saved the project from abandonment in the wake of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] -- but the choice may have increased the costs of completing the ISS substantially.

In response to some of these criticisms, advocates of manned space exploration say that criticism of the ISS project is short-sighted, and that manned space research and exploration have produced billions of dollars' worth of tangible benefits to people on Earth. Jerome Schnee estimates that the indirect economic return from spin-offs of [[human spaceflight|human space exploration]] has been many times the initial public investment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.jsc.nasa.gov/er/seh/economics.html |title=The Economic Impacts of the U.S. Space Program  |accessdate=2007-01-28 |author=Jerome Schnee |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> However, this can be a rather contentious point: a review of the claims by the Federation of American Scientists argued that NASA's rate of return from spinoffs is actually very low, except for aeronautics work that has led to aircraft sales.<ref>[http://www.fas.org/spp/eprint/jp_950525.htm NASA Technological Spinoff Fables] www.fas.org. Retrieved [[17 September]] [[2006]].</ref>

Critics also say that NASA is often casually credited with "spin-offs" (such as [[Velcro]] and portable computers) that were developed independently for other reasons.<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Park |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Virtual Astronaut |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/4/park.htm |work= |publisher=The New Atlantis |date= |accessdate=2007-01-28 }}</ref>  NASA maintains a list of spin-offs from the construction of the ISS, as well as from work performed on the ISS.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/ISSspin.html| title = International Space Station Spinoffs| accessdate = 2006-09-14| author = NASA Center for AeroSpace Information (CASI) | date = | year = | month = [[2005-21-05]]| format = HTML| publisher = NASA| language = English}}</ref>  However, NASA's official list is much narrower and more arcane than dramatic narratives of billions of dollars of spin-offs.

It is therefore debatable whether the ISS, as distinct from the wider space program, will be a major contributor to society. Some advocates argue that apart from its scientific value (or lack thereof), it is an important example of international cooperation.<ref>[http://www.spacetoday.org/SpcStns/FirstAnnivOccupy.html International Space Station: Human Residency Third Anniversary] Space Today Online, 2003. Retrieved [[17 September]] [[2006]]. </ref> Others claim that the ISS is an asset that, if properly leveraged, could allow more economical manned Lunar and Mars missions.<ref>[http://www.marstoday.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=18482  Interview with Niolai Sevostianov, President, RSC Energia: The mission to Mars is to be international] MarsToday.com, [[2005-12-11]]. Retrieved [[2007-01-16]].</ref> Either way, advocates argue that it misses the point to expect a hard financial return from the ISS; rather, it is intended as part of a general expansion of spaceflight capabilities.

==Sightings==
Due to the size of the International Space Station, and particularly the large reflective area offered by its [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]], ground based observation of the station is possible with the [[Naked eye#Naked eye in astronomy|naked eye]]; indeed, it is one of the brightest naked-eye objects in the sky on such occasions. Since the station is in low earth orbit, and the sun angle and observer locations also need to coincide, it is only visible for brief periods of time.

NASA provides data on forthcoming opportunities for viewing the ISS (and other objects) via their [http://spaceflight1.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/ Sightings] web page, and so does the [[European Space Agency]] [http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA0I6KE43D_iss_0.html].

==Miscellaneous==
[[Image:YuriMalenchenko.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Yuri Malenchenko]] was the first person to be married in space]]

===Space tourism and weddings===
As of 2007 there have been five [[Space tourism#List of flown spaceflight participants|space tourists]] to the ISS, each spending around US$25 million; they all went there aboard Russian supply missions. There has also been a space wedding when cosmonaut [[Yuri Malenchenko]] on the station married Ekaterina Dmitrieva, who was in Texas.

''[[Expedition 14#EVA 1|Golf Shot Around The World]]'' was an event in which, on an [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]], a special golf ball, equipped with a tracking device, was hit from the station and sent into its own [[low Earth orbit]] for a fee paid by a Canadian golf equipment manufacturer to the Russian Space Agency. The task was supposed to be performed on [[Expedition 13]], but the event was postponed, and took place on [[Expedition 14]].<ref>http://www.e21golf.com/</ref><ref>http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1093</ref>

===Microgravity===
At the ISS altitude, the gravity from the Earth is still 88% of that at sea level. The state of [[weightlessness]] is a result of the fact that the ISS is in constant free fall, which according to the [[equivalence principle]] is indiscernible from being in a state where all forces, including gravity, are absent. However, due to (1) the drag resulting from the residual atmosphere, (2) vibratory acceleration due to mechanical systems and the crew on board the ISS, (3) orbital corrections by the on-board gyroscopes or thrusters, and (4) the spatial separation from the real [[Center of mass|centre of mass]] of the ISS, the environment on the station is often described as [[microgravity]], with a level of gravity on the order of 2 to 1000 millionths of ''g'' (the value varies with the frequency of the disturbance; the low value occurs at frequencies below 0.1 Hz, the higher value at frequencies of 100 Hz or more).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/downloads/userguides/physenv.pdf|title=European Users Guide to Low Gravity Platforms|accessdate=2006-05-16|format=PDF|publisher=European Space Agency|language=English}}</ref>
