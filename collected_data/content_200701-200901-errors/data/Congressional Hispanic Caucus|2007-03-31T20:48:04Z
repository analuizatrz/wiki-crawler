'''The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC)''' is comprised of 21  [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Members of the [[United States Congress]] of [[Hispanic]] descent. The [[Caucus]] is dedicated to voicing and advancing, through the legislative process, issues affecting Hispanics in the [[United States]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. The CHC was founded in December 1976 as a legislative service organization of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Today, the CHC is organized as a Congressional Member organization, governed under the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives.

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus aims to address national and international issues and the impact these policies have on the Hispanic community. The function of the Caucus is to serve as a forum for the Hispanic Members of Congress to coalesce around a collective legislative agenda. In addition to covering legislative action, the CHC also monitors [[Executive (government)|Executive]] and [[Judicial]] issues.

CHC legislative priorities cover all areas that have a direct impact on the Hispanic community. In order to best address these diverse issues, members work in a smaller [[task force]] that draws on their expertise and develops priority [[legislation]] within each area. The Caucus is composed entirely of Democrats. The Cuban-American Republican delegation from Florida (Senator [[Mel Martinez]], and Reps. [[Lincoln Diaz-Balart]], [[Mario Diaz-Balart]], and [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]]) are not members; these congressional members are all part of the [[Congressional Hispanic Conference]]. Senator [[Bob Menendez]], a Cuban-American Democrat from [[New Jersey]], is a member. Senator [[Ken Salazar]] (D-CO) is not a member of either of these organizations.

On January 31, 2007, a story on the [[Politico.com]] website reported that Rep. Baca had called Rep. Loretta Sanchez a "whore" prompting her to resign from the CHC.  Rep. Baca has denied this charge. <ref>http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0107/2572.html Politico.com</ref>
