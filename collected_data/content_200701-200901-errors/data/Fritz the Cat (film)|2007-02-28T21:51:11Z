'''''Fritz the Cat''''' is a 1972 [[animated film]] written and directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]]. Based on the [[comic book]]s by [[Robert Crumb]], the film was the first animated feature film to receive an [[X-rated|X rating]] in the United States. The film is a [[satire]] on [[United States of America|American]] college life of the 1960s: while Fritz does not attend any classes during the film, he participates in major social upheavals based around the popular college protest movement of the time.

''Fritz the Cat'' was the first independent animated film to gross more than $100 million at the box office.<ref name="Variety">{{cite web

==Plot overview==
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:In the Park With Fritz.jpg|left|thumb|240px|"Sheesh, what a mob in the park today."]]
The film begins with three [[construction]] workers on their [[Lunch|lunch break]]. They complain that they spend so much money to send their children to college, only to instead find out that the kids instead spend all of their time drinking [[Alcoholic beverage|booze]], smoking [[marijuana]], and having [[sex]] with each other. One construction worker gets up to [[urinate]] off of the scaffold, the [[urine]] landing on the head of a [[hippie]] with a [[guitar]]. 

In a [[New York City]] park, various hippies are gathered with guitars to sing [[protest song]]s. Fritz and his buddies show up in an attempt to meet girls. At first, they stand around commenting about how the place is "crawling with phonies" (when in fact, that's exactly what they are). 

When a trio of attractive females walk by, they exhaust themselves trying to get their attention, but find that they're more interested in the [[crow]] standing a few feet away. Fritz tells the guys that he's going to "split." The girls attempt to flirt with the crow, making some condescending remarks about [[black (people)|black]]s, while Fritz looks on in annoyance. 

One asks "Why does a great actor like [[James Earl Jones]] always have to play ''black men''?" Another tells the crow "I had a black girlfriend once who told me that [[Jew]]ish people are the closest to black people. I'm Jewish, you know." Suddenly, the crow rebukes the girls with a snide remark ("I ain't no jive ass black [[nigger]], honey. Who do you think I am? Geraldine?") and walks away. Fritz silently laughs at the stunned girls. After a beat, Fritz catches the girls' attention by lamenting: 

<blockquote>"My soul is tormented! I've been up and down the four corners of this big old world! I've seen it all! I've done it all! I've fought many a good man, and laid many a good woman! I've had riches and fame and adventure...I've tasted life to the fullest, and still my heart cries out, yes, cries out in this hungry, tortured, wrecked quest: 'More!'"</blockquote>
[[Image:Naked Closeness.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Fritz and three girls "seek the truth."]]
Fritz invites one the girls to his "pad" so they can "seek the truth." When the others complain, "what about my soul, you fink?" Fritz silently comments "Hmm, four in a bed. That's a kick I haven't tried yet." He brings all three of them up to a friend's apartment where a wild party is taking place. Fritz drags the girls into the bathroom and the four of them have [[group sex]] in the tub. 

Meanwhile, two incredibly dimwitted [[pig]] [[police|officers]] (one of which is voiced by director Ralph Bakshi) show up to raid the place. As the pigs walk up the stairs, one of the partygoers finds Fritz and the girls in the bath tub. Several others show up and jump in, pushing Fritz to the side where he takes solace in [[marijuana]]. The two officers break into the apartment, but find that it's empty, as everyone has moved into the bathroom. 

Fritz takes refuge in the toilet as one of the pigs busts into the bathroom and begins to beat up the various hippies. Very stoned, Fritz jumps out, grabs the pig's gun, and shoots out the toilet, breaking the water main, flooding everybody out of the apartment.

The pigs chase Fritz all the way down the street into a [[synagogue]], where we hear dialogue from three [[rabbi]]s (taken from an audio recording of Bakshi's father and two uncles<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=10816#10816 |title=Bakshi Board Exclusive Interview #6 |accessdate=2006-12-29 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Ralph Bakshi Forum |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>). Fritz manages to get out when the various Jews get up to celebrate the United States' decision to send more weapons into [[Israel]].

Fritz makes it back to his [[Dormitory|dorm]], where his [[roommates]] ignore him. He winds up setting all of his notes and books on [[fire]]. When he tries to put the fire out with a blanket, the blanket catches on fire. The fire spreads throughout the dorm, finally setting the entire building ablaze. 

On the run from the law, Fritz finds himself in a bar in Harlem. He meets Duke the crow at a [[Pocket billiards|billiard]] table. After narrowly avoiding getting into a fight with the bartender, Duke invites Fritz to "bug out." The other crows in the bar laugh at Fritz's apparent non-understanding of what the phrase means. 
[[Image:Fritz Duke cop.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Fritz and Duke have a run in with the law after stealing a car.]]
When Duke begins to steal a car, Fritz is eager to join in on performing an illegal activity ("shove over, Jack, let me drive this goddamn thing"). Fritz winds up driving it off a bridge. Before the [[Car accident|car crashes]] into the waters and rocks below, Duke winds up saving Fritz's life. 

The two arrive at an apartment owned by Bertha, a former prostitute-turned [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]]. When Fritz arrives, she shoves several joints into his mouth. His use of marijuana increases his [[Libido|sex drive]], and so he rushes off into an alley to have sex with Bertha the crow.

While having sex with her, he comes to a supreme realization that he "must tell the people about the revolution!" He runs off into the city street and incites a riot, during which Duke is shot and killed, and winds up being chased by several cops. 

He hides in an alley where his girlfriend, Winston, shows up to find him. She drags him out on a road trip to [[San Francisco]], stopping at a [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurant along the way, and disenchanting Fritz with her refusal to go to unusual places. The car runs out of gas in the middle of the desert, and Fritz decides to abandon her.

Fritz meets up with a [[heroin]]-addicted [[Neo-Nazi]] biker who tells Fritz that "the revolution could use a man like you." Along with the biker's horse girlfriend, Harriet, they take a ride to an underground hide-out where several other revolutionaries tell Fritz of their plan to blow up a [[Power station|power plant]]. 

When Harriet tries to get Blue to leave and "go get some [[chinese food|chinks]]," he hits her several times, and ties her down with a chain. The [[terrorist]] group's leader, a [[sadist]]ic lizard, grabs a candle. When Fritz objects to their treatment of her, he is hit in the face with the candle. The group throws Harriet on the bed. Although it is not shown, it is implied that she is [[rape]]d by the members of the group.

The next scene shows Harriet sitting in a graveyard, naked, traumatized. Fritz puts a coat over her and gets into a car. He and the lizard drive out to the power plant. After planting the dynamite, Fritz suddenly has a change of heart. The lizard sets the fuse on fire and drives off as Fritz tries to get the dynamite out of its tight spot and fails. The dynamite explodes, blowing up both the power plant and Fritz. 

At a [[Los Angeles]] hospital, the girls that Fritz picked up in the park earlier in the film show up to comfort him, but are refused entrance by a sherrif guarding Fritz's hospital room while he's under house arrest. A robed woman, praying for Fritz, walks past the sherrif into Fritz's room. The girls follow her with their hands together. 

In Fritz's room, the woman takes off her hood, revealing herself to be Harriet. Fritz speaks what appear to be his final words ("I've been up and down the four corners of this big old world...") before suddenly regaining his strength. Fritz grabs each of the three girls and throws them onto the bed, once again having sex with each of them as Harriet watches in surprise.

==Production==
===Background===
Producer [[Steve Krantz]] saw potential in Bakshi's vision for animated films specifically for adults. Having sold Krantz the production and distribution for what was to become the 1973 Bakshi feature, ''[[Heavy Traffic]],'' Krantz told Bakshi to make a film adapted from another author's work before moving on to his original work. Bakshi agreed, and the two searched for the perfect project. In 1969, Krantz discovered a large [[Paperback|paperback book]] containing three stories feature Robert Crumb's [[anthropomorphic]] 1960s comic book character [[Fritz the Cat]], whom Crumb partially based on himself. Later that year, Krantz and Bakshi got in touch with Crumb and paid his way from his home north of San Francisco to New York, in order to talk with him about getting the film rights to the characters.<ref name="Funnyworld">{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartOne/FritzOne.htm |title=The Filming of <i>Fritz the Cat</i> |accessdate=2006-12-29 |author=[[Michael Barrier|Barrier, Michael]] |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=1972/73 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=<i>Funnyworld</i>, Nos. 14 and 15 |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> 

After several meetings, Krantz received a contract, signed by Crumb, in the mail, and that in return Crumb received twelve thousand five hundred dollars, which was supplemented by a percentage of the film's gross proceeds.<ref name="Funnyworld"/> However, Crumb claims that Krantz and Bakshi "rolled over me like a freight train when they wanted to make ''Fritz the Cat'' into a movie. I couldn't cope with their aggressiveness. I ran away. My first wife, Dana, signed the contract and got ten thousand dollars on the spot. On two other occasions, we received large sums of money from the film's producers, Steve Krantz Productions."<ref name="Crumbhandbook">{{cite book | title = The R. Crumb Handbook | first = Robert | last = Crumb| coauthors = Poplaski, Peter | year =  | publisher = M Q Publications | location =  | id = ISBN: 978-1840727166}}</ref> 

The first part of the film's story was adapted from a self-titled story first published in a 1968 issue of ''R. Crumb's Head Comix'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Crumb |first=Robert |author= |coauthors= |title=Fritz the Cat |year=1968 |publisher=R.

===Distribution and funding===

With the rights to the character, Krantz and Bakshi set out to find a distributor. "When I say that every major distributor turned it down, this is not an exaggeration," remembers Krantz. In the spring, [[Warner Bros.]] agreed to distribute the film and to provide money for making the picture.<ref name="Funnyworld"/> Late in November, Bakshi and Krantz had made a presentation reel containing a few minutes of finished animation, pencil tests, and shots of some of Bakshi's storyboards made to show to the studio, who wanted film stars' voices for the characters and also wanted Bakshi to tone down the material, removing the explicit sex in a scene with Fritz and Bertha. Bakshi and Krantz left, taking their project with them.<ref name="Funnyworld"/> The distribution and financing problems were cleared up late in 1970, when Cinemation Industries attached themselves to the project and [[Fantasy Records]] agreed to help fund the film.<ref name="Funnyworld"/>

===Music===
{{main|Fritz the Cat (soundtrack)}}
The film's score was performed by [[Ed Bogas]] and [[Ray Shanklin]]. The [[Fritz the Cat (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] was released on [[Fantasy Records]] in 1972.

==Response==
[[Image:Fritz the Cat promo.jpg|right|thumb|Promo for the ''Fritz the Cat'' [[Fritz the Cat (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] showing the film as the second-highest grossing film in the week of June 7, 1972, behind ''[[The Godfather]]''.]]

Critical reaction to the film was positive. Film website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 67%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fritz_the_cat/ |title=Fritz the Cat |accessdate=2006-12-29 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> The film was also a box office success, and the first independent animated film to gross more than $100 million at the box office.<ref name="Variety"/> The film, however, did not go without its share of controversy. Robert Crumb disliked the film. Crumb drew a comic in which the character was killed off, and claimed that he "wrote them a letter telling them not to use any more of my characters in their films."<ref name="Funnyworld"/> Crumb later said of the film:

<blockquote>"I barely remember the movie. It's one of those experiences I sort of block out. The last time I saw it was when I was making an appearance at a [[Germany|German]] art school in the mid-1980s, and I was forced to watch it with the students. It was an excruciating ordeal, a humiliating embarrassment. I recall [[Victor Moscoso]] was the only one who warned me, 'if you don't stop this film from being made, you are going to regret it for the rest of your life'—and he was right."<ref name="Crumbhandbook"/></blockquote>

Of Crumb, Bakshi said:

<blockquote>"R. Crumb is a funny guy. We’ve spoken over the years and he was always nice to me on the phone and I’m always nice to him. I love R. Crumb, but when he does an interview he can’t help taking a dig at me. If you notice he takes a dig at everybody his mother, his father, his brother, his sister. In other words, I don’t take it seriously. That’s what R. Crumb s all about. He’s always pointing a finger. He did [[Crumb (film)|a movie]] that I thought that was more embarrassing to him than my ''Fritz the Cat'' was to him. I think that taught him a lesson. He took a camera to his house and shot his poor brothers and his dysfunctional family."<ref name="Newsarama">{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=46252 |title=Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-21 |author=Epstein, Daniel Robert |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=October 13, 2005 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref></blockquote>

Meanwhile, the film sparked some negative reactions from viewers who were turned off by the film's content. Bakshi remembers, "A lot of top animators in the business took a full page ad out in [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] telling me to take my garbage back east. It was 'We of the [[Walt Disney|Disney]] tradition resent you coming here.' This really hurt and confused me - I couldn't understand other artists telling any artists what you should or should not do. I remember not wanting to leave my office because I felt the guys animating for me felt the same way. But Irv Spence - great [[Metro-Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]] [[Tom & Jerry (MGM)|Tom & Jerry]] animator - walked in my office at the end of the day and told me what I was doing was absolutely on the money, and he was having the best time of his life. Irv was as great as anyone on that Variety ad. From that moment on it became us against them. Irv was about 30 years my senior."<ref name="VarietyFritz">{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3832#3832 |title=biography |accessdate=2007-01-02 |author=Bakshi, Ralph |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Ralph Bakshi Forum |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> 

"A lot of people got freaked out," says Bakshi. "The people in charge of the power structure, the people in charge of magazines and the people going to work in the morning who loved Disney and [[Norman Rockwell]], thought I was a pornographer, and they made things very difficult for me. The younger people, the people who could take new ideas, were the people I was addressing. I wasn't addressing the whole world. To those people who loved it, it was a huge hit, and everyone else wanted to kill me."<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1841791,00.html |title=Who flamed Roger Rabbit? |accessdate=2006-12-29 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=August 11, 2006 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Before the film's release, American distributors attempted to cash in on the publicity garnered from ''Fritz the Cat'' receiving an X rating from the MPAA by rushing out dubbed versions of two [[adult animation]]s from [[Japan]], applying an X rating to the advertising material: ''Senya ichiya monogatari'' and ''Kureopatora'', retitled ''[[One Thousand and One Arabian Nights (film)|One Thousand and One Arabian Nights]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra: Queen of Sex]]''. However, neither film had been actually submitted to the MPAA, and it is believed that neither feature would have received an X rating if they had been.<ref name="Funnyworld"/>

''Fritz the Cat'' is currently available on DVD in [[DVD region code|region 1]] countries from [[MGM Home Entertainment]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/Fritz-Cat-Skip-Hinnant/dp/B00003CWQI/ |title=ASIN: B00003CWQI |accessdate=2006-12-29 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> and from [[Arrow Films]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fritz-Cat-Nine-Lives/dp/B000EMTJP6/ |title=ASIN: B000EMTJP6 |accessdate=2006-12-29 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> In 2003, the film was ranked at number 51 on the [[Online Film Critics Society]]'s list of the top 100 greatest animated films of all time,<ref name="OFCS"/> and was placed at number 56 on [[Channel 4]]'s list of the ''[[100 Greatest Cartoons]]''.<ref name="Channel4"/>
