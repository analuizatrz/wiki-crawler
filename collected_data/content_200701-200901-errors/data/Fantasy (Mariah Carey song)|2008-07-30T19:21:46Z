"'''Fantasy'''" is a song co-written and co-produced by American singer [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Dave Hall (record producer)|Dave Hall]], and recorded for Carey's sixth album ''[[Daydream (album)|Daydream]]'' (1995). It is built around a sample of the [[Tom Tom Club]]'s single "[[Genius of Love]]" (1982), which was written by [[Tina Weymouth]], [[Chris Frantz]], [[Steven Stanley]] and [[Adrian Belew]]. It was released as the album's first [[single (music)|single]] in [[1995]] (see [[1995 in music]]). The urban remix of "Fantasy" features [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. The album version of the song was nominated for the 1996 [[Grammy Award]] for "[[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]", losing to "No More 'I Love Yous'" by [[Annie Lennox]].

==Release and reception==
"Fantasy" became Carey's ninth number-one single on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart. It was the first single by a female artist to debut at number one in the U.S., and only the second single to do so after "[[You Are Not Alone]]" by [[Michael Jackson]]. It spent eight weeks at the top of the chart, from [[September 24]] to [[November 18]] [[1995]], Carey's longest stay at the time alongside "[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]" (1993). It replaced "[[Gangsta's Paradise (song)| Gangsta's Paradise]]" by [[Coolio]], and was replaced by [[Whitney Houston]]'s "[[Exhale (Shoop Shoop)]]". "Fantasy" spent twenty-three weeks in the top forty and was successful on other ''Billboard'' formats, including the [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[dance music|dance]] charts. Its strong sales led it to be certified double [[platinum single|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], Carey's first single to do so. It was ranked seventh on the Hot 100 year-end charts for 1995 and forty-ninth on the 1996 year-end charts.

The single topped the charts in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] and while reaching the top five  in the [[United Kingdom]]. It remained at the top of the Canadian Singles Chart for twelve weeks, a record it shared with six other singles until the release of "[[I'll Be Missing You]]" (1997) by [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]] featuring [[Faith Evans]].<ref>[http://www.mariah-charts.com/chartdata/Canada.htm Mariah Carey - Canada Chart Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "Fantasy" also reached the top ten in most countries across [[Continental Europe]], and the top twenty on the [[Oricon|official singles chart]] in [[Japan]].

The single's [[music video|video]] was the first that Carey directed entirely on her own. She can be seen exploring an amusement park ([[Playland (New York)|Playland]], located in [[Rye, New York]]), on roller blades and riding on a [[roller coaster]], before joining a group of [[hip hop dance]]rs after nightfall. The video also contains a scene involving an [[overweight]] young girl who tries to emulate Carey and whose character reappears in the video for Carey's single "[[Shake It Off]]" (2005).

==Remixes==
Carey worked with producer Sean Combs (Puff Daddy) to create the "[[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]]" remix of Fantasy. The "Bad Boy" remix used guest raps from the late [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] (ODB). Some of the song's pop elements were removed for the remix, while the [[bassline]] and "Genius of Love" sample were emphasised.   
 
Carey re-recorded vocals for club remixes of the song by [[David Morales]]. One of these remixes won the Winter Music Conference National Dance Award for "Dance Record of the Year".
