'''''Verbascum thapsus''''' ('''Common''' or '''Great Mullein''') is a species of [[mullein]], native to [[Europe]], northern [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and introduced in the [[Americas]] and [[Australia]]. 

Common mullein is a hairy [[biennial plant]] that can grow up to 2&nbsp;meters. Its small yellow flowers are densely grouped on the stem, which bolts from a large rosette of leaves. It grows in a wide variety of habitats, but favors well-lit disturbed soils, where it can grow suddenly thanks to its long-lived seeds. Common Mullein is a common weedy plant that spreads by way of its large seed production, but rarely is an aggressively invasive species since its seed require open ground to [[germination|germinate]]. This species of mullein is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops since it is not a very competitive plant, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. However, it hosts many insects, such as the [[tarnished plant bug]], that can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to destroy by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently since Common mullein, with its heavy seed production, has seeds that persist in the [[soil seed bank]] for many years, and may reappear when the ground is disturbed. 

''V. thapsus'' is widely used as an herbal remedy with [[emollient]] and [[astringent]] properties. It is especially recommended for coughs and related problems, but also used in [[topical]] applications against a variety of skin problems. The plant was also used to make [[dye]]s and [[torch]]es.

Common Mullein is a [[dicotyledon]]ous biennial that produces a [[rosette (botany)|rosette]] of  leaves in its first year of growth.<ref name="remaley"/><ref name="davis"/> The leaves are large up to  50 cm long and lay flat over the ground and are covered with wholly, silver-gray colored hairs.  The second year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem 1–2&nbsp;m tall with some plants  reportedly having stems reaching up to and exceeding 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) tall.<ref>[http://www.purplesage.org.uk/profiles/mullein.htm Purple Sage Herbs: ''Verbascum thapsus''], retrieved on [[December 29]] [[2006]].</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Jacobson| first=Arthur Lee| title=Mullein| url=http://www.arthurleej.com/a-mullein.html| work=The Weed of the Month| publisher=arthurleej.com| month=January| year=1992| accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref> The tall pole-like stems end in a dense [[raceme|spike]] of flowers,<ref name="remaley"/> that can occupy up to half the stem length.

On blooming plants the leaves are alternately arranged up the stem. The leaves are thick and [[decurrent]], with much variation especially between the upper and lower leaves on the stem, with leaf shape ranging from between [[leaf shape|oblong to oblanceolate]] and ranging in size up to 14&nbsp;cm across and 50&nbsp;cm long (5&nbsp;inches wide and 19&nbsp;inches long).<ref name="huxley">Huxley, A., ed.

==Taxonomy and nomenclature==
[[Image:Vthapsus sheet.JPG|thumb|right|The dried type specimen (LINN 242.1) of ''Verbascum thapsus''.]]
For the purpose of [[botanical nomenclature]], the species was first described by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in his 1753 ''[[Species Plantarum]]''. The [[specific epithet]] ''thapsus'' had been first used by [[Theophrastus]] (as ''θάψος'', "thapsos")<ref name="carnoy"/> for an unspecified herb from the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] settlement of Thapsos, near modern [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Sicily]],<ref>{{sv icon}} [http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/scrophularia/verba/verbtha.html Den virtuella Floran: ''Verbascum thapsus''], retrieved on [[December 29]] [[2006]].</ref><ref name="carnoy">{{fr icon}}{{cite book| last=Carnoy| first=A. |title=Dictionnaire étymologique des noms grecs de plantes| year=1959|location=Louvain| publisher= Publications Universitaires| oclc=3284108}}</ref> though it is often assimilated to the ancient [[Tunisia]]n city of [[Thapsus]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Charters|first=Michael L.|title=Plant name: T| work= California Plant Names: Latin and Greek Meanings and Derivations| url=http://www.calflora.net/botanicalnames/pageT.html|publisher=Calflora.net| accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref> Within ''[[Verbascum]]'', it classified under section ''Bothrosperma'' subsect.

At the time, no [[type specimen]] was specified, as the practice only appeared later, in the 19th century. When a lectotype (type designed amongst original material) was designated, it was assigned to specimen 242.1 of Linnaeus' herbarium, the only ''V. thapsus'' specimen. The species had previously been designated as [[type species]] for ''Verbascum''.<ref>{{cite web| title=''Verbascum thapsus''| url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/research-curation/projects/linnaean-typification/detail.dsml?ID=925400| work=Linnaean Plant Name Typification Project| publisher=Natural History Museum| accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> European plants exhibit much more [[phenotype|phenotypical]] variation than the American ones,<ref name="BoCW"/> which has lead to the plant acquiring many [[synonymy|synonyms]] over the years.<ref>{{Cite web| title=''Verbascum thapsus'' synonymy| url=http://www.northernontarioflora.ca/chklst.cfm?speciesid=1004482| publisher=Northern Ontario Plant Database|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=''Verbascum thapsus'': synonyms| url=http://www.plantatlas.usf.edu/synonyms.asp?plantID=1757| work=Atlas of Florida vascular Plants | publisher=Institute for Systematic Botany |accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref>

===Subspecies and hybrids===

There are three [[subspecies]]:
*''V. thapsus'' subsp. ''thapsus''; type, widespread.
*''V. thapsus'' subsp. ''crassifolium'' (Lam.) Murb.; Mediterranean region and to 2000 metres in southwestern Austria.<ref name=schmeil/> (syn. subsp. ''montanum'' (Scrad.) Bonnier & Layens)
*''V. thapsus'' subsp. ''giganteum'' (Willk.) Nyman; Spain, endemic.
In all subspecies but the type, the lower stamens are also pilose (having scattered straight long soft hairs).<ref>{{es icon}} {{cite web|title=''Verbascum thapsus'' L. subsp. ''montanum'' (Schrad.)

===Common names===

''V. thapsus'' is known by a variety of names. In the 19th century it had well over 40 different common names in English alone. Some of the more whimsical ones included "Hig candlewick," "Bullicks lungwort," "Adams-rod," "Feltwort," "Hare's-beard" and "Ice-leaf."<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| last=Britton| first=Nathaniel A.| coauthors=Addison Brown| encyclopedia=An illustrated flora of the northern United States and Canada |volume=V. 3.

Some names refer to the plant's size and shape: "Shepherd's Club(s)" or "Staff," "[[Aaron's Rod]]" (a name it shares with a number of other plants with tall, yellow inflorescences), and a plethora of other "X's Staff" and "X's Rod."<ref name="grieve"/><ref name="Rickett"/><ref>Watts, ''Elsevier's dictionary of plant names'', pp.774-775, 819-820. p.866: "A tall plant like Mullein attracts 'staff' and 'rod' names."</ref> The plant is still called "Velvet" or "Mullein Dock"—"Dock" is a British name applied to any broad-leaved plant.<ref>Watts, ''Elsevier's dictionary of plant names'', pp.302, 634.</ref>

==Ecological aspects==

[[Image:Starr 040723 0074 verbascum thapsus.jpg|thumb|right|''V. thapsus'' grows best where there is little competition]]
The Common Mullein most frequently grows as a colonizer of bare and disturbed soil. This is in part due to its intolerance of shade and the very long periods during which the seeds can remain dormant before [[germination]]. It is not an agricultural [[weed]], although its presence can be very difficult to completely eradicate, and is especially problematic in [[overgrazing|overgrazed]] pastures.<ref name="Hoshovsky">Hoshovsky (2001)</ref><ref name="remaley"/><ref name="davis">{{Cite web|last=Pitcairn|first=Michael|title=Verbascum thapsus |url=http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/datastore/detailreport.cfm?usernumber=87&surveynumber=182 |work=|publisher=[[University of California Davis]]|accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref> The species is considered a [[noxious weed]] in [[Colorado]] (Class C),<ref>{{cite web|title=Colorado State-listed Noxious Weeds|url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/noxious?rptType=State&statefips=08| work=PLANTS Database| publisher=USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service| accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref> Hawaii<ref>{{cite web|title=Hawaii State-listed Noxious Weeds|url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/noxious?rptType=State&statefips=15| work=PLANTS Database| publisher=USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service| accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref> and [[Victoria, Australia]] (regionally prohibited in the [[West Gippsland]] region, and regionally controlled in several others).<ref>{{cite web|last=Faithful| first=Ian| title=Great mullein| url=http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/nreninf.nsf/LinkView/D2FE171D9ECA1CC9CA256BCF000AD563ECC844336D72F0634A256DEA00293F8A | publisher=Victoria Department of Primary Industries |accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref>

''V. thapsus'' favors dry, sandy or gravelly soils, although it can grow in a variety of habitats: meadows, roadsides, forest clearings and pastures. It germinates almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10&nbsp;[[°C]] and 40&nbsp;°C.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> This ability to grow in a wide range of habitats has been linked to strong [[phenotype]] variation rather than [[adaptation]] capacities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Ingrid M.|coauthors=Joseph Rodriguez, Michael E.

===Life cycle===

Common Mullein is a biennial and generally requires [[vernalization]] before it can flower.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> This vernalization or dormancy is linked to [[starch]] degradation in the root activated by low temperatures, and [[gibberellin]] application bypasses this requirement.<ref name="phyt"/> Seeds germinate in spring and summer most often when exposed to light, those that germinate in autumn produce plants that overwinter if they are large enough with rosettes less than 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;in) across dying in winter. After flowing the entire plant usually dies at the end of its second year<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> but some individuals, especially in the northern parts of the species' range, require a longer growth period and flower in their third year. Under longer growing conditions, some individuals flower in the first year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reinartz|first=James A.|title=Life History Variation of Common Mullein (''Verbascum Thapsus''): I.

[[Image:Common Mullein closeup.jpg|right|thumb|The hairy leaves are resistant to grazing and contact herbicides.]]

Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via mechanical means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably followed by sowing of native plants. Animals rarely [[grazing|graze]] it because of its irritating hairs, and liquid [[herbicide]]s require [[surfactant]]s to be effective, as the hair causes water to roll off the plant, much like the [[lotus effect]]. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for [[seedling]]s to colonize.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/><ref name="remaley"/><ref name="davis"/> ''G. tetrum'' and ''Cucullia verbasci'' usually have little effect on ''V. thapsus'' populations.<ref name="remaley"/> Goats and chickens have been proposed to control Mullein.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include [[glyphosate]],<ref name="remaley"/><ref name="davis"/> [[triclopyr]]<ref name="remaley"/> and [[sulfurometuron-methyl]].<ref name="davis"/> Ground herbicides, like [[tebuthiuron]], are also effective, but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent regrowth.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/>

==Uses==
Common Mullein has been used since ancient times as a remedy for skin, throat and breathing ailments. It has long had a medicinal reputation, especially as an [[astringent]] and [[emollient]]. It contains [[mucilage]], several [[saponin]]s, [[coumarin]] and [[glycoside]]s. [[Dioscorides]] recommended it for diseases of the [[lung]] and it is nowadays widely available in health and herbal stores. Non-medical uses have included [[dye]]ing and making [[torch]]es.

===Medical uses===

Leaf [[decoction]]s or [[herbal tea]]s were used for [[expectoration]], consumption, dry cough, [[bronchitis]], sore throat and [[hemorrhoid]]s.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Great Mullein is called ''Gordolobo''. ''[[Gnaphalium]] conoideum'' was used in a fashion similar to Mullein by the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Aztec]]s, which caused confusion in naming, and both are sold under the name "Gordolobo," (although ''V. thapsus'' is not found in Mexico).

The flowers provide dyes of bright yellow or green, and have been used for [[hair coloring]].<ref name="grieve"/><ref name="pfaf"/> The dried leaves and hair were made into [[candle wick]]s, or put into shoes to help with insulating them. The dried stems were also dipped into [[suet]] or [[wax]] to make torches.<ref name="grieve"/><ref name="hanrahan"/> For obvious reasons, the plant, unlike other species of the genus, is not often cultivated.
