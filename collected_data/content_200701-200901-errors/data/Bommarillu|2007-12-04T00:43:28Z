The film primarily revolves around a father and son relationship with the father's dote on his son ironically leaving a bitter taste with the latter. The son's choices and his wants to achieve something in life are always subdued by his father's. The father has a justification in the form of his dream, that is to build a dream house - ''Bommarillu''. When it comes to his son's marriage, the son breaks his shackles of respect only to experience the newly found independence. The film concludes with the father's repentance on his foolishness and the happy marriage of the protagonists.

== Plot ==
[[Image:bommarillu12.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Blossoming love between Hasini and Siddhu]]The film begins with a baby taking his initial steps on a beach while the father is supporting him. The narrator in the background ([[Murali Mohan]]) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child’s hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddhu ([[Siddharth Narayan|Siddharth]]) begins uttering abuses at all the fathers in the world. When inquired about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind ([[Prakash Raj]]), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairdo and many others are stashed away by his father’s. However, he vows that the two things that will be of his choice would be, his career and the woman he would marry.

Post-[[credits]], Satti ([[Sunil]]), the Arvind dutiful household’s servant wakes up Siddhu in the morning. In the background, we see Siddhu’s mother, Lakshmi ([[Jayasudha]]) singing a [[devotional]] [[Telugu language|Telugu]] song while cooking. At the dining table, Arvind, [[Managing Director]] of their construction company, inquires if Siddhu will join their office for managing their business. When Siddhu deliberates, his father doesn’t stand any longer and instead plans for his [[marriage]] despite Siddhu's silent protest. The next week, he returns home to realize that he is going to get [[engagement|engaged]] to Subbulakshmi ([[Neha Bamb|Neha]]) against his wishes. He speaks with her only to realize that she is a ''daddy’s girl'' ([[Tanikella Bharani]] being the father) and she not being to his liking. However, with Arvind’s final say, they eventually get engaged. 

[[Image:bommarillu09.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Arvind, Siddhu and Lakshmi listen while Hasini tells the family why she's leaving the house]]While contemplating on his options in a temple, Siddhu accidentally meets Hasini ([[Genelia D'Souza]]), an [[engineering]] student. Seeing her chirpy nature and vibrance, Siddhu begins to like her. He makes attempts to know her by meeting her on a regular basis. In the process, he starts liking her cherubic and ever-friendly nature and as someone who does what she loves. As days go by, he realizes about so many small things in her company that gave him happiness. He realizes that he has fallen in love with her. 

Alongside this, Siddhu applies for a bank loan to start out on his dream of building his career. When his love for Hasini deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses to her that he is engaged to get married to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but what he really wants is her. On knowing of him being engaged, Hasini gets dejected, but comes back a day later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Siddhu is seen by a furious Arvind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marriage with Subbulakshmi. When asked for his reason to like Hasini, Siddhu replies saying that if Hasini can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Hasini to stay at his house after seeking permission from her father, Kanaka Rao ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]).

[[Image:bommarillu10.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Siddhu's confrontation with Arvind about his choices and wants]]When Hasini is introduced to Siddhu’s family, she gets a lukewarm welcome. As she settles down in the house, one after the other begins to like her. Even though getting used to the living habits of the authoritarian Arvind's household was difficult, Hasini stayed put for Siddhu's sake. In the meanwhile, Arvind reprimands Siddhu when he knows of his bank loan and his plans, only to further enrage Siddhu. One day the entire family along with Hasini attends a marriage ceremony. A cheerful Hasini cheers up the ceremony with her playful nature. Coincidentally, Kanaka Rao who happens to be around, recognizes Siddhu as the drunken young man whom he encountered on an earlier occasion. Hasini realizes her father's presence and quickly exits to avoid his attention. After saving their grace, Siddhu admonishes Hasini for her antics at the marriage. A sad and angry Hasini moves out of the house saying that she does not find Siddhu the same and that she cannot put on an act if she stays in their house. After getting back to her house, she rebuilds the trust her father has in her while Siddhu is left forlorn. Lakshmi confronts Arvind on Siddhu’s choices and wants. In the process, Siddhu opens up his heart and leaving Arvind to repent on his foolishness. Siddhu requests Subbulakshmi and her parents to call off the impending marriage. While they relent, Arvind manages to convince Kanaka Rao about Siddhu and Hasini's marriage. In return, Kanaka Rao wants to know more about Siddhu by having him live in house for a week. Arvind agrees with this and as the story returns to the pre-credits scene, the viewers are left to assume about the happy marriage of the protagonists.

== Production ==
=== The key elements ===
[[Image:bommarillu11.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Hasini and Siddhu dancing to a duet at the film's sets, Ramanaidu Studios]]The entire production of the movie took about three and a half months to be completed.<ref name="ID_Cinematography">{{cite web|work=Idlebrain.com|accessdate=2007-10-15|title=Interview with Vijay C Chakravarthy|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/vijaycchakravathy.html}}</ref> Prior to ''Bommarillu'', [[Bhaskar]] assisted [[Dil Raju]] in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] movies such as ''[[Arya (2004 film)|Arya]] (2004)'' and ''[[Bhadra (film)|Bhadra]] (2005)''. 

On the sets of the film ''Arya'', Raju offered Bhaskar a movie to direct. Eventually on the sets of ''Bhadra'', Bhaskar narrated the story to Raju and the saga began.<ref name="rediff1">{{cite web|work=Rediff.com|first=Radhika|last=Rajamani|accessdate=2007-10-15|title=The man behind Telugu hit Bommarillu|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2006/sep/06bomma.htm}}</ref> Thus, ''Bommarillu'' became the first directorial venture for Bhaskar.<ref name="rediff1">{{cite web|work=Rediff.com|title=The man behind Telugu hit Bommarillu|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2006/sep/06bomma.htm}}</ref> In an interview, he said that the story for the film began taking shape in as early as 1997 when he wrote about a father and a son's relationship. However, when the plans of making the film arose, an element of love between the protagonists was added. In the interview, he said that the script, up to and extent, is autobiographical.<ref name="rediff1">{{cite web|work=Rediff.com|title=The man behind Telugu hit Bommarillu|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2006/sep/06bomma.htm}}</ref> He cites personal examples of some scenes from the movie such as the choice of clothes for ''Siddhu'' by ''Arvind'', the head-bump between the lead actors and ''Lakshmi'' singing in the kitchen.<ref name="ID_PostMortem">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-16|work=Idlebrain.com|title=Postmortem - Bommarillu by Bhaskar|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/movie/postmortem/bommarillu.html}}</ref>

In an interview, [[Vijay C Chakravarthy]], the eventual [[cinematography|cinematographer]] for the movie, said that Dil Raju offered him the position in November 2005. For the film, Vijay said that he made use of [[Arriflex 435]] camera and Hawk lenses.<ref name="ID_Cinematography">{{cite web|work=Idlebrain.com|title=Interview with Vijay C Chakravarthy|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/vijaycchakravathy.html}}</ref> In another interview, Bhaskar said working with [[Abburi Ravi]], his co-writer, was unique. They used to converse in a closed room with a voice recorder, allowing the dialogues in the script to be natural.<ref name="ID_PostMortem">{{cite web|work=Idlebrain.com|title=Postmortem - Bommarillu by Bhaskar|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/movie/postmortem/bommarillu.html}}</ref> He also heaped praise on [[Marthand K. Venkatesh]], the film's [[Film editing|editor]]. After filming, the length of the movie reel came to 16200 feet which amounted to a runtime of 3 hours and 15 minutes. The presence of Marthand brought this down to 15100 feet. This meant a reduction of the runtime by 25 minutes.<ref name="ID_PostMortem">{{cite web|work=Idlebrain.com|title=Postmortem - Bommarillu by Bhaskar|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/movie/postmortem/bommarillu.html}}</ref>

=== Casting, location and music ===
The choice of [[Siddharth Narayan|Siddharth]] was because of the sheer relevance to the character in real life. However, they finalized the choice of the actor only after the script was ready.<ref name="rediff1">{{cite web|work=Rediff.com|title=The man behind Telugu hit Bommarillu|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2006/sep/06bomma.htm}}</ref><ref name="hinduhome">{{cite web|work=Hindu.com|last=Narasimhan|first=M.
