'''Christmas tree cultivation''' is an [[agriculture|agricultural]], [[forestry]], and [[horticulture|horticultural]] occupation which involves growing [[pine]], [[spruce]], and [[fir]] trees specifically for use as [[Christmas tree]]s. The first Christmas tree farm was established in 1901, but most consumers continued to obtain their trees from forests until the 1930s and 1940s. Christmas tree farming was once seen only as a viable alternative for low-quality farmland, but that perception has changed within the agriculture industry. For optimum yield and quality, land should be flat or gently rolling and relatively free of debris and undergrowth.

A wide variety of pine and fir species are grown as Christmas trees, although a handful of varieties stand out in popularity. In the United States, [[Douglas-fir]], [[Scots Pine]] and [[Fraser Fir]] all sell well. [[Nordmann Fir]] and [[Norway Spruce]] sell well in the [[United Kingdom]], the latter being popular throughout Europe. Like all [[conifer]]s, Christmas trees are vulnerable to a range of [[pest (organism)|pests]]. [[Aphid]]s and [[Adelgidae|adelgids]] are the most common problems among insect pests, and [[sudden oak death]] is a recent development in Californian tree farms. Christmas tree farming has also raised criticism from environmentalists due to the use of [[pesticide]]s and the possible effects of farming on biodiversity.

The final stage of cultivation, [[harvest]]ing, is carried out in a number of ways; one of the more popular methods is the pick-your-own tree farm, where customers are allowed to roam the farm, select their tree, and cut it down themselves. Other farmers cultivate potted trees, with balled roots, which can be replanted after Christmas and used again the following year. In the United States, research into Christmas tree [[genetics]] has produced better strains of tree seed, which has resulted in higher yields of quality Christmas trees. Jurisdictions in Canada and the United States have established quality grades for cut Christmas trees.

==History==
{{Main article|History of Christmas tree cultivation}}
The practice of cultivating evergreens specifically to sell as Christmas trees dates back to 1901, when a 25,000&nbsp;tree [[Norway Spruce]] farm was sown near [[Trenton, New Jersey]].<ref name=faber>Faber Harold.

The Christmas tree market burgeoned through the 1960s and 1970s, but from the late 1980s onward prices and the market for natural Christmas trees declined. In the early 21st century nearly 98&nbsp;percent of all natural (non-artificial) Christmas trees sold worldwide were grown on tree farms.<ref name=uofi/>

==Cultivation==
===Land and climate===
[[Image:Southern Virginia Christmas tree farm.jpg|thumb|right|This Christmas tree farm in southern [[Virginia]] is situated in a gently rolling valley.]]
Christmas tree farms are best located on relatively level land which is free of obstructions. In the past, Christmas tree farmers established their plantations on less desirable agricultural plots or "wastelands of agriculture".<ref name=osu/> However, emphasis in modern Christmas tree farming has shifted toward the production of higher-quality trees, increasing land quality expectations as well.<ref name=osu/> Indeed, some species of tree, such as the [[Fraser Fir]], are unable to grow on low-quality, marginal farmland.<ref name=leutyfraser>Leuty, Todd. [http://www.omaf.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/info_fir.htm Fraser Fir for Christmas Trees and Landscape Transplants], ''Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs'' (Ontario), [[May 1]] [[2005]]. Retrieved [[September 6]] [[2007]].</ref> Flat or gently rolling land is preferred to that with steep slopes and inclines, which is prone to [[erosion]] and fluctuations in fertility. Noticeable obstructions, such as rocks, fences or significant underbrush, are also undesirable.<ref name=osu>Brown, et al., Bulletin 670: Choice of Lands for Christmas Trees.</ref>
[[Image:Christmas tree farm IA.JPG|thumb|right|This Christmas tree farm in [[Iowa]] is located on flat ground and has well-mowed rows between the trees.]]
Like all crops and plants, Christmas trees require a specific set of nutrients to thrive.<ref name=hart/> There are 16&nbsp;elements crucial for growth; of those, three are obtained through air and water: [[hydrogen]], [[carbon]], and [[oxygen]]. [[Nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[sulfur]], [[boron]], [[copper]], [[chlorine]], [[manganese]], [[molybdenum]], [[iron]], and [[zinc]] are obtained from the soil. If the necessary elements are not available in the local soil, nutritious fertilizers are used.<ref name=hart>Hart, et al., ''Christmas Tree Nutrient Management Guide for Western Oregon and Washington''.</ref> Other important soil considerations include [[pH]] and [[drainage]].<ref name=johnson>Johnson, et al., ''Tree Crops for Marginal Farmland: Christmas Trees With a Financial Analysis''.</ref> Certain types of soil are preferable, depending on the type of tree. [[Pine tree]]s are usually better adapted to a sandy or sandy loam soil,<ref name=melvin/> while [[White Spruce]] trees and fir trees, such as the [[Douglas-fir]], prefer fine-texture [[loam]]s and clay loam soils.<ref name=melvin/> Some trees grow well in all types of soil, but in any case, the land must be well-drained for a Christmas tree farm to have a chance of thriving.<ref name=melvin>Koelling and Dornbush, ''Growing Christmas Trees in Michigan''.</ref>

The weather, as with other agricultural endeavors, plays a key outcome in the yield of a Christmas tree farm. Severe cold in the winter and extreme hot and dry conditions during and after harvest can cause irreparable damage to the crop.<ref name=barney/> Early snow can make both harvesting and shipping trees difficult or impossible.<ref name=barney>Barney and Finnerty, ''Christmas trees is this the crop for you?''.</ref>

===Labor and equipment===
Christmas tree farming is a labor-intensive process. Depending on the quality of the land, [[bulldozing]] may need to be undertaken prior to planting, in order to remove obstacles such as large trees or rocks.<ref name=bull670OH2>Brown, et al., Bulletin 670: ''Plantation Establishment and Management: Preplanting Land Preparation''.</ref> If the volume of undergrowth requires it, the soil may be [[tilling (agriculture)|tilled]]; tilling can help remove any debris remaining after tree or weed removal. Both [[woody plant]]s and [[weed|herbaceous weed]]s must be controlled prior to planting; this is most often done by application of a chemical [[herbicide]].<ref name=bull670OH2/> In addition, some types of [[fertilizer]]s must be introduced into the soil prior to planting.<ref name=bull670OH2/> The work done prior to planting tree [[seedling]]s plays an important role in the overall success of a Christmas tree crop.<ref name=barney/>

After the trees are in the ground, work on the crop continues. Animal pests (especially insects) and diseases must be monitored and controlled, and weed growth must also be minimized. Many species of pine and fir require pruning and shearing two to four years after planting to maintain the trademark Christmas tree shape.<ref name=barney/> Late or omitted pruning can result in trees that are unmarketable due to large gaps in needle coverage. Some species of pine, such as the [[Scots Pine]], are susceptible to dormant season "yellowing", which is generally countered with a green dye or paint.<ref name=barney/><ref name=iowa>Lane, Pirjetta, et al.

Retrieved [[September 6]] [[2007]].</ref>

The outlay of money on equipment varies greatly. Some items commonly found on Christmas tree farms are [[insecticide]] sprayers, [[tractor]]s, and shaper sheers.<ref name=preston>Preston, For a Very Merry Christmas, Invest in Trees for the Season. ''International Herald Tribune''.</ref> Mechanized planters, at a cost of about [[United States dollar|US$]]4,000, are not essential but a work-saving luxury for farmers.<ref name=preston/> Farmers can purchase seedlings, the lifeblood of a Christmas tree farm, from nurseries. One farmer in Oregon purchased seedlings for between [[United States dollar|US$]]200–300 per 1,000&nbsp;plants. The farmer, a wholesaler, sold his final products for about $20&nbsp;each; after the cost of the trees and other expenses, a profit of $2–3&nbsp;per tree.<ref name=preston/>

===Harvest===

{{see also|Christmas tree production}}
Christmas trees can be [[harvest|harvested]] and marketed in different ways. Some operations are known as "choose-and-cut" or pick-your-own farms, which allow customers to walk through the planted land, select their Christmas tree and cut down themselves.<ref name=johnson/> Wholesale operations are more labor-intensive because they usually require the farmer to complete tasks such as [[baling]], cutting, moving the trees to a roadside pick-up, and loading the harvest. In addition, this work must be completed during a very short period in November.<ref name=johnson/> Growers also harvest trees by digging and balling the root and selling the trees as nursery stock or as live, reusable Christmas trees. This last option allows trees to be harvested earlier than the usual six to ten year period required to grow a mature Christmas tree.<ref name=johnson/>

Christmas tree farming affects the surrounding environment in a number of ways, and groups differ as to which effect to protest. In the United States, the National Christmas Tree Association (NCTA) touts the environmental benefits of live Christmas trees, especially over the competing artificial alternative.<ref name=ncta2/> The NCTA stated that every acre of Christmas trees in production produced the daily [[oxygen]] requirement for 18&nbsp;people; with 500,000&nbsp;acres (2,000&nbsp;km²) in production in the U.S. alone, that amounts to oxygen for 9&nbsp;million people per day.<ref name=ncta2/> The NCTA also stated that the farms help to stabilize the soil, protect water supplies and provide wildlife habitat.<ref name=ncta2>''National Christmas Tree Association'', "Real Christmas Trees are a Benefit to the Environment".</ref> In addition, the industry points to the reduction of carbon dioxide through Christmas tree farming.<ref name=guardian>Hickman, "Is it OK . . . to get a Christmas tree?"</ref>

A 1998 report from the [[Michigan State University]] [[Agricultural Experiment Station]] predicted increasing environmental concerns about tree production and use as one possible reason people may favor artificial trees in the future.

When the Census of Agriculture authority was shifted to the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in 1997&nbsp;the differences in definition were resolved and the Census of Agriculture included Christmas tree farms.<ref name=hoppe>Hoppe.

In the United Kingdom, Christmas trees do not fall into the category of enterprises included in farm profits.<ref name=bimuk>''HM Revenue & Customs'', ''Nurseries and Market Gardens - definition''.</ref> Instead, Christmas tree farms are classified as "[[market garden]]s".<ref name=bimuk/> Market gardens are defined separately from farming and are nurseries or gardens used for the sale of produce other than [[hops]].<ref name=bimuk/> However, in [[Northern Ireland]], some Christmas trees are cultivated and harvested by the Forest Service.<ref name=niff>[http://www.forestserviceni.gov.uk/index/whats-on/new_on_this_site-christmas.htm Forest Fresh Christmas Trees], ''Forest Service'' (Northern Ireland), United Kingdom Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.
