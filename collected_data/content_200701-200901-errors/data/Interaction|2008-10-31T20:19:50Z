'''Interaction''' is a kind of [[action (philosophy)|action]] that occurs as two or more objects have an [[effect]] upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way [[causal]] effect. A closely related term is [[interconnectivity]], which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising [[Emergence|emergent]] phenomena. ''Interaction'' has different tailored meanings in various [[science]]s.  
All systems are related and interdependent. Every action has a consequence.

Casual examples of interaction outside of science include: 

* [[communication]] of any sort, for example two or more people talking to each other, or communication among [[Group (sociology)|group]]s, [[organisation]]s, [[nation]]s or [[state]]s: [[trade]], migration, [[foreign relations]], [[transport]]ation,
* the [[feedback]] during the operation of [[machine]]s such as a computer or tool, for example the interaction between a driver and the position of his or her car on the road: by steering the driver influences this position, by observation this information returns to the driver.

== Chemistry and medicine ==

In [[medicine]], most [[medication]]s can be safely used with other [[medicine]]s, but particular [[combination]]s of medicines need to be monitored for interactions, often by the [[pharmacist]]. In [[molecular biology]], the knowledge on [[gene]]/[[protein]] interaction among themselves and with their [[metabolite]]s is referred to as [[molecular pathway]]s.

Interactions between medications ([[drug interaction]]s) fall generally into one of two main categories: 
# [[pharmacodynamic]] : Involving the actions of the two interacting drugs.
# [[pharmacokinetic]] : Involving the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of one or both of the interacting drugs upon the other.

In terms of efficacy, there can be three types of interactions between medications: additive, synergistic, and antagonistic. Additive interaction means the effect of two chemicals is equal to the sum of the effect of the two chemicals taken separately. This is usually due to the two chemicals acting on the body in the same way. Examples would be Aspirin and Motrin, Alcohol and Depressant, Tranquilizer and Painkiller. Synergistic interaction means that the effect of two chemicals taken together is greater than the sum of their separate effect at the same doses. An example is Pesticide and Fertilizer, the biological effect is devastating. Antagonistic interaction means that the effect of two chemicals is actually less than the sum of the effect of the two drugs taken independently of each other. This is because the second chemical increases the excretion of the first, or even directly blocks its toxic actions. Antagonism forms the basis for antidotes of poisonings. An example is Asparagus and birth control
pills.

== Communications ==
{{main|Interactivity}}

In [[communication]]s, interactive communication occurs when [[communication source|sources]] take turns [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmit]]ting [[message]]s between one another. This should be distinguished from [[transactive communication]], in which sources transmit messages simultaneously. Included in this category are all new modes of communication such as cable video, teletext, videotext, teleshopping, video on demand, computers, Internet, tele-conferencing etc. Tele-communication also falls under this category. so cell phones, pagers, mobile phones, and electronic mail are interactive communications. these can be classified under three headings: 
# Interpersonal : Telephone and its allied services.
# Group : Tele-conference. video-conference.
# Mass : Internet, world wide web

== Media art==<!-- This section is linked from [[Electronic learning]] -->
In [[Mass media|media]], [[interactivity]] is a feature of the media in question and as digital technology becomes more accessible to the masses interest in interactivity is increasing and becoming a cultural trend especially in the arts.

== Physics ==
{{main|Fundamental force}}

In [[physics]], an '''interaction''' or [[force]] specifically refers to the action of one physical object upon another and results in a [[potential energy]] - the physical objects under consideration may range from [[Point (geometry)|point]] [[Elementary particle|particle]]s to [[quantum field theory|quantum field]]s. For example, the interaction of [[electric charge|charge]]d particles takes place through the mediation of [[electromagnetic field]]s, whereas [[beta decay]] occurs by means of the [[weak interaction]]. There are believed to be four [[fundamental force|fundamental interactions]] in Nature.

== Sociology ==
{{main|Social interaction}}

In [[sociology]], [[social interaction]] is a dynamic, changing sequence of [[social action]]s between individuals (or groups) who modify their actions and reactions due to the actions by their interaction partner(s). Social interactions can be differentiated into accidental, repeated, regular, and regulated. Social interactions form the basis for [[social relation]]s.

==Statistics==

{{main|Interaction (statistics)}}

In [[statistics]], an '''interaction''' is a term in a [[statistical model]] in which the effect of two, or more, variables is not simply additive.

=== An example from statistics applied to psychology ===
If we were examining the effect of two variables, sex and [[premature birth]], on health outcomes we would describe any difference in health outcome scores between sexes as a [[main effect]]. Similarly any difference in scores of full term/premature birth would be described as a [[main effect]]. The presence of an interaction effect implies that the effect of sex on health outcome varies as a function of premature birth status.

== Genetic interactions ==
[[Geneticist]]s work with a number of different genetic interaction modes to characterize how the combination of two [[mutation]]s affect (or does not affect) the [[phenotype]]:<ref>{{Cite journal

noninteractive, synthetic, asynthetic, suppressive, epistatic, conditional, additive, single-nonmonotonic and double-nonmonotonic.
Further characterizations is enhancement interaction and nonadditive interaction.

The word [[epistasis]] is also used for genetic interaction in some contexts.
