{{Clan Fraser}}

The '''Clan Fraser''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] - ''Clann Frisealach,'' [[French Language|French]] ''"Clan Frasier"'') is a [[Scottish clan]] of [[French people|French]] origin. The Clan Fraser has been strongly associated with [[Inverness]] and the surrounding area for many centuries, ever since the founder of the Clan gained lands there in the [[13th century]]. Since, the Clan has dominated local politics and society. The Clan has been active in every major military conflict to involve Scotland over the centuries since it's founding, and has played a considerable role in most major political turmoils.

The Clan's current chief is [[Simon Fraser, 16th Lord Lovat|Simon Fraser]], the 16th [[Lord Lovat]], and 25th [[Chiefs of Clan Fraser|Chief of the Clan]]. The arms of Clan Fraser are ''Quarterly: 1st and 4th Azure, three fraises Argent, 2nd and 3rd Gules, three antique crowns Or,'' or in [[layman's terms]], the traditional three cinquefoils, or Fraises (strawberry flowers), as they have come to be known, in the first and fourth positions and three crowns in the second and third positions. Only the Lord Lovat is allowed use of these arms plain and undifferenced.<ref name=tartans>* Neil Grant. ''Scottish Clans and Tartans.'' Crescent Books, New York, 1987. ISBN 0-517-49901-0.</ref>

== History ==
=== Appearance and early movement in Scotland ===
The [[French language|French]] word for [[Strawberry]] is ''fraise'' and the plants are called ''fraisiers''. This is the most probable orgin for the name of the Clan.<ref name="tartans"/> The Frasers probably come from [[Anjou]], in [[France]], and it has even been suggested that they descend from a tribe called Friselii in [[Roman Gaul]], whose badge was a [[strawberry]] plant. In his [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Bello Gallico]], [[Julius Caesar]] mentions this tribe, wearing red checked pants. This is reminiscent of the Red & Black tartan in use by many Frasers today.<ref name="tartans"/> It should be noted, however, that any connection between the Gaulish tribe and the Gaelic Clan is purely speculative.

One story, favoured by [[Archibald Campbell Fraser of Lovat]], and Sir [[George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie|George MacKenzie]], [[Lord Advocate|Lord Advocate of Scotland]], derives their descent from Pierre Fraser, Seigneur de Troile, who came to Scotland with the ambassadors of [[Charlemagne]], around [[807]], mentioning the arms of the family, which are to this day, '''a field azure, semi,''' with strawberries flowers, or ''fraises.'' The only difference is that the arms once contained more strawberry flowers. Pierre was made [[Thegn]] of the [[Isle of Man]] in 814, and one group of Frasers still live there today under the Gaelic name of Frisael. His direct descendants were to become the lords of [[Oliver Castle]].<ref name="annals">Fraser, Archibald Campbell. ''Annals... of the Frasers of Loveth.''

Scottish-Heirloom.com</ref> The stories of [[Julius de Berry]] were regarded by Archibald Campbell Fraser to have been of a second group of Frasers.<ref name="annals"/>

In [[1160]], another Simon Fraser of Keith held lands in [[East Lothian]] at [[Keith Marischal|Keith]]. In that same year, he made the gift of a church to the [[Tironensian]] monks at [[Kelso Abbey]], the first recorded appearance of the Frasers in [[Scotland]]. This is our earliest written record of Frasers in Scotland.<ref name=tartans/> The Frasers moved into [[Tweeddale]] in the [[12th century|twelfth]] and [[13th century|thirteenth]] centuries and from there into the counties of [[Stirlingshire|Stirling]], [[Angus]], [[Inverness-shire|Inverness]] and [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeen]].<ref name=annals>Fraser, Archibald Campbell.

[[Image:Scotlan Beauly Priory.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The remains of [[Beauly]] Priory.]]
Sir [[Simon Fraser (d. 1306)|Simon Fraser]] of Oliver acquired the Bisset Lands around [[Beauly]] when he won the hand of its heiress, a young Bissett. [[Alexander III of Scotland|King Alexander III]] granted the right of the ''"Lordship of Loveth, vulgo Morich,"'' in the [[Aird, Inverness|Aird]], in [[1253]].<ref name=annals/><ref>A copy of this charter may be found at [[:wikisource:Charter of the right of the Lordship of Lovat|Charter of the right of the Lordship of Lovat]] from Wikisource.</ref>These lands were given to, '''Simon Fraser of Lovat''', either his son or cousin, from whom the Clan Fraser claims descent.<ref name=annals/> Sir Simon held other lands in Aberdeen, which were given to his eldest son (or cousin), Sir [[Alexander Fraser of Cowie]]. It is from Alexander that the [[Frasers of Philorth]] descend. In [[1336]], Thomas Fraser, of the [[Frasers of Muchalls]], gained the estates of Stonywood and Muchalls in [[Kincardineshire]], and soon erected a [[tower house]] stronghold overlooking the [[North Sea]]. This tower house was later expanded, and became known as [[Muchalls Castle]].<ref>[http://www.baronage.co.uk/bphtm-03/fraser04.html Frasers of Muchalls]. Baronage Press. Retrieved [[14 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

=== Wars of Scottish Independence ===
During the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], Sir [[Simon Fraser (d. 1306)|Simon Fraser]], known as "the Patriot," fought first with the [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|Red Comyn]], and later with Sir [[William Wallace]] and [[Robert the Bruce]].<ref name="annals"/>

Sir Simon is celebrated for having defeated the [[England|English]] in three separate engagements at the [[Battle of Roslin]] in [[1303]], with just 8,000 men under his command. Along with the Clan Fraser, the [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|Red Comyn]]'s [[Clan Comyn]], and the [[Clan Sinclair]] are known to have fought at the battle, which took place on [[24 February]] 1303.<ref name="annals"/> At the [[Battle of Methven]] in [[1306]], Sir Simon leads troops along with Bruce, saving the King's life in three separate instances. Simon was allegedly awarded the 3 Crowns which now appear in the [[Frasers of Lovat|Lovat Arms]] for these three acts of bravery. At the end of the day, he was captured by the [[England|English]] and executed with great cruelty by [[Edward I of England|King Edward]] in [[1306]], in the same barbaric fashion as Wallace.<ref name="annals"/> At the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in [[1314]], Sir Simon's cousin, Sir [[Alexander Fraser of Cowie]], was much more fortunate. He fought at Bannockburn, married Bruce's sister, and became [[Chamberlain]] of Scotland. The Frasers of Philorth trace their lineage from Alexander.<ref name="annals"/> At the [[Battle of Halidon Hill]] in [[1333]], Alexander Fraser's three younger brothers, Simon Fraser of Lovat, Andrew, and James, were killed while fighting the English.<ref name="annals"/>

=== Clan wars ===
[[Image:Fraser lands 1587.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Fraser lands are shown in blue. This map is accurate to the [[Parliament of Scotland#The_Sixteenth_Century|acts]] of [[Parliament of Scotland|parliament]] [[1587]] & [[1594]]. Click to enlarge.]]
As most all Highlanders, the Frasers have been involved in countless instances of Clan warfare, particularly against the Macdonalds.<ref name="tartans"/> Two Fraser war cries have been largely recognized, both in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]. The first, '''''"Caisteal Dhuni"''''' (Castle Dounie/Downie) refers to the ancestral Castle and Clan seat, which once existed near the present [[Beaufort Castle]]. The second is '''''"A Mhòr-fhaiche"''''' (The Great Field).<ref name="tartans"/>

The Frasers fought a great clan battle against the [[Clan MacDonald of Clan Ranald]] in 1544, ''Blar-ne-Léine,'' in Gaelic, the [[Battle of the Shirts]], over the disputed chiefship of Clan Ranald. The Frasers, as part of a large coalition, backed a son of the 5th Chief, Ranald ''Gallda'' (the Stranger), which the MacDonalds found unacceptable. The [[Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll|Earl of Argyll]] intervened, refusing to let the two forces engage. But on their march home, the 300 Frasers were ambushed by 500 MacDonalds. Only five Frasers and eight MacDonalds are said to have survived the bloody engagement. Both the Lovat Chief, [[Hugh Fraser, 3rd Lord Lovat|Hugh Fraser]], and his son were amongst the dead and were buried at [[Beauly Priory]]. Despite this, the Frasers were stronger than ever before within a hundred years.<ref name=tartans/>

Robert Mor Munro, 15th chief of [[Clan Munro]] , was a staunch supporter of [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary, Queen of Scots]], and he consequently was treated favourably by her son, [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]]. Robert was also a faithful friend of Mary. Buchanan states, when the unfortunate princess went to [[Inverness]] in [[1562]], that: "as soon as they heard of their sovereign's danger, a great number of the most eminent Scots poured in around her, especially the '''Frasers''' and Munros, who were esteemed the most'' 'valiant of the clans inhabiting those countries in the north.' ''" These two clans took [[Inverness Castle]] for the Queen.. The Queen later hanged the governor, a [[Clan Gordon|Gordon]] who had refused her admission.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/m/munro2.html Munro]. Electric Scotland. Retrieved on 11 February 2007.</ref>

In 1571 the Clan Fraser joined forces with the [[Clan Forbes]] in their feud against the [[Clan Gordon]]. The Forbes were also joined by [[Clan Keith]] and [[Clan Crichton]]. The Gordons were also joined by [[Clan Leslie]], [[Clan Irvine]] and [[Clan Seton]]. The feud between the Gordons and Forbes which had gone on for centuries culminated in two full scale battles: The Battle of Tillieangus and the Battle of Craibstone. It was at the Battle of Tillieangus that the 6th Lord Forbes's youngest son known as Black Aurther Forbes was killed. Legend has it that "''he stooped down to quench his thirst and one of the Gordons gave him his death blow through an open joint in his armour''".<ref name="tartans"/> A battle took place between the Clan Fraser (with help from the [[Clan Macrae]]) and the [[Clan Logan]] at [[North Kessock|Kessock]] where Gilligorm, the Chief of the [[Clan Logan]], was killed.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/htol/logan2.html Clan Logan].

=== Call to arms & civil war ===
[[Image:Illustration Taxus baccata0.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Traditionally, Frasers wear small branches of ''Iubhar'' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]), or [[Taxus baccata|Yew]], in their caps.]]
During the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] of [[1644]]–[[1650]], the Clan Fraser were as active as ever and supported the cause of the [[Covenanter]]s.

*In [[1645]], at the [[Battle of Auldearn]], in [[Nairnshire]], the Clan Fraser opposed the Royalist leader [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]], and fought under a Fraser of Struy (from a small village at the mouth of [[Glen Strathfarrar]]). The battle left Eighty-seven Fraser Widows, from which we can only guess how many Frasers actually fell.<ref>[http://www.fraser-clan.org/update/fraser_connections_5.htm Clan Fraser Society of Scotland and the UK] Retrieved on 07 March 2007</ref>. On this battle, a poem was composed:
<blockquote>
''"Here Fraser Fraser kills, a Browndoth kills a Browndoth.''
''A Bold a Bold, and Lieth's by Lieth overthrown.''
''A [[Clan Forbes|Forbes]] against a Forbes and her doeth stand,''
''And [[Clan Drummond|Drummonds]] fight with Drummonds hand to hand.''
''There dith Magill cause a Magill to die,''
''And [[Clan Gordon|Gordon]] doth the strenth of Gordon try.''
''Oh! Scotland, were though Mad? Off thine own native gore.''
''So Much till now thou never shedst before."''
</blockquote>

*In [[1649]], the Clan Fraser was again joined by the [[Clan Munro]] to take Inverness Castle. This time, they were also joined  by the [[Clan Urquhart]] and the [[Clan MacKenzie]], who they had recently made peace with. They were all opposed to the authority of the current [[parliament]]. They assaulted the town and took the castle. They then expelled the garrison and raised the [[fortifications]]. However, on the approach of the parliamentary forces led by [[David Leslie (Scottish general)|General Leslie]], all of the clans retreated back into [[Ross-shire]]. Over the next year, several skirmishes took place between these parties.

*In [[1650]], at the [[Battle of Dunbar]], the Clan Fraser fought on the side of the Scottish Covenanters who were opposed the forces of [[Oliver Cromwell]]. However, they were defeated by Cromwell's forces. 

*In [[1651]], the Clan Fraser joined joined the King's army at Stirling. They fought at the [[Battle of Worcester]] where the King's army was defeated by Oliver Cromwell's [[New Model Army]].

=== Jacobite risings ===
[[Image:Simon Fox.gif|thumb|left|[[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Simon "the Fox" Fraser]], 
11th Lord Lovat, [[1668]]. The Fox was Chief during the second and third [[Jacobite Risings]].]]
In [[1689]], the [[Glorious Revolution]] deposed the [[Roman Catholic]] King [[James II of England|James VII]] as monarch of England, replacing the King with his [[Protestant]] daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her husband and cousin [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. Swiftly following in March, a Convention of the Estates was convened in Edinburgh, which supported William & Mary as joint monarchs of Scotland. However, to much of Scotland, particularly in the Highlands, James was still considered the rightful, legitimate King.

==== Bonnie Dundee ====
On [[16 April]] [[1689]] [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee|John Graham of Claverhouse]], [[Viscount Dundee]], raised the royal standard of the recently deposed King [[James II of England|James VII]] on the hilltop of [[Dundee Law]] with fewer than 50 men in support. Being fierce patriots all, the Clan Fraser rallied swiftly to his side, along with many of the Highland clans. Their chief, [[Thomas Fraser, 10th Lord Lovat|Thomas Fraser]], tried to hold his clan from joining the uprising, to no avail. The Clan marched without him, in support of the Stewarts, and fought at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]]. The following year, in [[1690]],  Thomas finally joined them.<ref name=harper>J.R. Harper. ''The Fraser Highlanders.'' The Society of The Montreal Military & Maritime Museum, Montreal, 1979.</ref>

==== The Fifteen ====
The Clan Fraser was split during [[Jacobite rising#the .27fifteen|The Fifteen]]. While some supported the Jacobite cause, Simon "the Fox" Fraser, Chief at the time, supported the British Government. In [[1715]] Simon (who had been outlawed and in exile, by Stewarts), put pressure on the Jacobite garrison in Inverness. The Jacobites at Inverness were trapped by Fraser. The [[Clan MacDonald of Keppoch]] did attempt to relieve them, but their path was blocked by the Frasers, and Keppoch was forced to retreat.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/mackenzie/images/CHAPT.10.pdf Chapter 10] of the History of the Clan MackKenzie. Electric Scotland. Retrieved on 11 February 2007</ref> Inverness was delivered up to Fraser on the very day when the [[Battle of Sheriffmuir]] was fought and another Jacobite force was defeated at the [[Battle of Preston]]. Soon after this 31 year old Chief Colonel Robert Munro of Foulis marched into the town of Inverness with 400 Munros and took over control as governor from Fraser. In [[1719]] the Clan Fraser fought for the British government at the [[Battle of Glenshiel]] where they helped defeat the Jacobites and [[Clan MacKenzie|MacKenzies]] alike.<ref name=harper/>

==== The Forty-Five ====
On [[2 August]] [[1745]], a frigate successfully landed [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]], grandson of [[James VII]] with his ''seven men of [[Moidart]]'' on the island of [[Eriskay]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]]. He would go on to raise the royal standard at [[Glenfinnan]], and lead the second Jacobite rising in Scotland. The by-now-infamous Simon "the Fox" Fraser supported the Jacobites and [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]] during [[Jacobite rising#the .27forty-five|The '45]]. One very strong reasoning for this was that Simon had been created [[Duke of Fraser]], [[Marquess of Beaufort]], [[Earl of Stratherrick and Abertarf]], [[Viscount of the Aird and Strathglass]] and Lord Lovat and [[Beauly]] in the [[Jacobite Peerage of Scotland]] by James Francis Edward Stuart in [[1740]]. Frasers were on the front lines of the Jacobite army at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1746)]], and the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746.<ref name=harper/>

===== Culloden =====
At the [[Battle of Culloden]], Frasers made up the largest Centre Regiment of the Front line, with 400 men under [[Charles Fraser of Inverallochy|Charles Fraser]] of [[Inverallochy]], and [[General Simon Fraser of Lovat|Simon Fraser]], Master of Lovat (the Fox was, conveniently, not present at the battle, reportedly trying to gather dispersed Clansmen to fight). Being on the front line, the Frasers were one of the few units to actually close with Government forces, breaking through Barrell’s regiment with 800-900 other Highlanders ([[Atholl]] men, [[Clan Cameron|Camerons]], [[Clan Stewart of Appin|Stewarts of Appin]]), the ferocious Frasers were massacred by the Government second line. Shortly after the [[Battle of Culloden]], Simon the Fox watched his castle go down in flames.<ref name=harper/>

==== Aftermath ====
[[Image:Fraser Grave at Culloden Moor.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Fraser gravestone at Culloden Moor. Frasers who fell at the [[Battle of Culloden]] were buried in a mass grave underneath this stone. Hundreds may lie underneath it. Each clan had its own grave.]]In [[1746]] Castle Dounie was burnt to the ground, while the Fox was on the run. He was tried for treason and executed in [[London]] on 9 April [[1747]], and his estates and titles were forfeited to the Crown. Many noted that the man possessed the utmost dignity to the end.<ref name=harper/>

The Fox's son, Simon Fraser escaped punishment, and was pardoned - later raising a Fraser regiment for the British army which fought in Canada in the [[1750s]], including [[Quebec]].<ref name=harper/> Charles Fraser was mortally wounded and found by [[Henry Hawley|General Hawley]] on the field, who ordered one of his aides, a young [[James Wolfe]] to finish him off with a pistol. Wolfe refused, so Hawley got a common soldier to do it.<ref name=harper/> We also know the fate of some of the clansmen. David Fraser of Glen Urquhart, who was a deaf-mute had, it was said, charged and killed seven redcoats, but was captured and died in prison. John Fraser, also called ‘MacIver’ was shot in the knee, taken prisoner and put before a firing squad, but was then rescued by a British officer, [[Lord Boyd]], who was sick of the slaughter. Another John Fraser, who was [[Provost]] of [[Inverness]] tried to get fair treatment for the prisoners.<ref name=harper/>

Castle Dounie was replaced by a small square building costing £300 in which the Royal Commissioner resided until [[1774]], when some of the forfeited Lovat estates were granted by an [[Act of Parliament]] to his son, Simon Fraser ([[1726]]-[[1782]]), by then a major general, in recognition of his military service to the Crown and the payment of some £20,000.<ref name=harper/> Later, two modest wings were added. On the death of General Fraser’s younger half-brother, [[Colonel]] [[Archibald Campbell Fraser of Lovat]] (1736-1815), without legitimate surviving male issue, the Lovat estates were transferred, by entail, to [[Thomas Alexander Fraser]] of [[Strichen]]([[1802]]-[[1875]]), a distant cousin who was descended from Thomas Fraser of Knockie & Strichen ([[1548]]-[[1612]]), second son of [[Alexander Fraser, 4th Lord Lovat]] ([[1527]]-[[1557]]). Knockie was sold about [[1727]] to [[Hugh Fraser of Balnain]] ([[1702]]-[[1735]]).<ref name=harper/>

=== Frasers in the New World ===
[[Image:General Simon Fraser of Lovat.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sir [[General Simon Fraser of Lovat|General the Hon. Simon Fraser of Lovat]], 19th MacShimidh, [[1726]]-[[1782]].]]

==== Seven Years War ====
Under the chief, Simon (who had led the Frasers in the '45 as the Master of Lovat) a regiment of Frasers, the [[78th Fraser Highlanders]], numbering fourteen hundred were raised and fought the [[Seven Years War|French and Indians]] in the [[Thirteen colonies|colonies]] and in [[Canada]], from [[1757]]-[[1759]]. Interestingly, the 78th fought under General Wolfe, who had previously fought at the Battle of Culloden, against Simon and perhaps some of the 78th. It was one of the 78th, possibly Simon, possibly one of his men, whose familiarity with the [[French language]] saved the first wave of British troops at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], which led to the capture of [[Quebec City|Quebec]].<ref name=harper/>

==== American rebellion ====
Fighting against [[American Revolutionary War|American independence]], Simon, by this time a General, raised twenty-three hundred men, the [[71st Fraser Highlanders]]. He recruited two battalions, raised at [[Inverness]], [[Stirling]] and [[Glasgow]]. Mostly men were not of the name, for the number of Frasers thirty years after Culloden and the end of the clan system, had been substantially reduced.<ref name=harper/>

==== Diaspora ====
Many Frasers settled in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] after the [[Seven Years' War|war against the French]] in [[Quebec]]. Many others later emigrated to those countries and to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] (with a Fraser [[Prime Minister]] in both). Frasers in the [[United States of America|U.S.]] have continued their proud military tradition, fighting on both sides of the [[American Civil War]]. Frasers from both sides of the Atlantic fought in the [[World War I|Great War]], and the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref name=fraserchief>Saltoun, Lady Flora Fraser.

Frasers have always been known for their fighting spirit, and their skill in the arts of war. Frasers fought in many, many wars, from the defending of Scottish lands against invading Danes and Norse, to the Scottish Wars of Independence, to the Jacobite risings, both World Wars, and continue to serve today. Among the organized regiments, were an Independent Highland Company in 1745 that fought at the Battle of Culloden,<ref name=harper/> and The [[2nd Highland Battalion]], formed in January of 1757.<ref name=harper/>. The [[62nd Regiment of Foot]], formed 1757,<ref name=harper/> was soon redesignated as the [[78th Fraser Highlanders]] in 1758, and retired as a fighting unit in 1763, but the unit is still active as a fund raising organization under the authority of the [[Lord Lovat]].<ref name=harper/> The [[71st Fraser Highlanders]] formed in October of [[1775]], consisted of two battalions raised at [[Inverness]], [[Stirling]] and [[Glasgow]] for service in North America.

== The modern Clan ==
[[Image:Saltoun Lovat.jpg|thumb|left|The Lady Saltoun and the Lord Lovat together at Castle Fraser for the 1997 Fraser Gathering.]]
Today the Clan Fraser is composed of thousands upon thousands of the descendants of those Frasers who ventured out into the world in the name of King and Country. Large Fraser populations exist in the United States and Canada, as well as smaller populations in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In [[1951]], the Lord Lovat [[Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat|Simon Chrsitopher Joseph Fraser]] was able to muster some 7,000 Frasers to the family seat at Beaufort Castle,<ref>[http://www.scottishthemes.com/clan/clan_fraser+of+lovat.html Scottish Themes.com] Retrieved on 11 February 2007.</ref> and in [[1997]], some 30-40,000 Frasers from 21 different countries came to [[Castle Fraser]] over a period of four days.<ref>[http://www.clanfraser.ca/scotland.htm Clan Fraser Society of Canada] Retrieved 11 February 2007.</ref>

On [[May 1]], [[1984]], by [[decree]] of the [[Lyon Court|Court]] of the [[Lord Lyon]], the [[Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun|21st Lady Saltoun]] was made'' "Chief of the name and arms of the whole Clan Fraser"''. The late Lord Lovat, Simon Christopher Joseph Fraser, was reported to have not given any heed to the decision, dismissing the matter as being beneath him.<ref name=FraserCal>[http://www.fraserclan-cal.net/philorth.html "The Frasers of Philorth, Now Saltoun"]. Clan Fraser Association for California. Retrieved 11 February 2007.</ref> Since this decree, there has been much confusion as to the Chiefship of the Clan Fraser. 

Many are led to believe that this decree made the Lady Saltoun the chief of the Clan, however this is not true. One of the most important things to remember in this debate, is that the Lord Lyon did not grant the Chiefship of the Clan Fraser, simply a description of "Chief of the name and arms." The Lord Lyon does not have power over the Chiefship of a Highland Clan.<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/lyondocs.htm#Maclean%20of%20Ardgour Maclean of Ardgour v. Maclean 1941 S.C. 613] from Documents of the Lord Lyon, from Heraldica.org</ref> What the decree did do, is reinforce the Lady Saltoun's claim to being the head of the senior branch of the wider Fraser family, and granted her the use of the plain and undifferenced Fraser arms (three strawberry flowers on a field of blue).<ref name=fraserchief/> Regardless, the chiefship still rests firmly in the hands of the current Lord Lovat, [[Simon Fraser, 16th Lord Lovat|Simon Fraser]].<ref name=FraserCal/>

== Distinguished Frasers ==
[[Image:Simon Fraser.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Simon Fraser the explorer.]]

Many Frasers have earned wide renown over the years. In military service, [[General Simon Fraser of Balnian]], of [[Battle of Saratoga|Saratoga]] fame, [[General Simon Fraser of Lovat]] (who also fought in the [[Seven Years War|war against the French]], and commanded Fraser at Culloden), [[Admiral of the Fleet]] the Lord Fraser of Northcape [[Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat|Simon Christopher]], the 17th [[Lord Lovat]], served in the [[Scots Guards]] and was an outstanding [[British Commando]] leader in the [[Second World War]], noted for his service during the D-Day landings of the [[Battle of Normandy]]. In the political realm, the Rt. Hon. [[Peter Fraser]], [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] 1940-1949, and the Rt. Hon. [[John Malcolm Fraser]], [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[1975]]-[[1983]]. [[William Fraser, 1st Baron Strathalmond]], [[BP|Chairman B.P.]], [[Hugh Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of Allander|Hugh Fraser III]], grandson of the founder of the [[House of Fraser]], and at one time owner of [[Harrods]] have made names for themselves in the business world.
