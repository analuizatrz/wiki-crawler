'''Nightwish''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[symphonic metal|symphonic]] [[power metal]] band formed in 1996 in the town of [[Kitee]]. Nightwish is considered responsible for the rise in popularity of the [[symphonic metal]] genre, and the foundation of [[symphonic power metal]].

Although the band has been prominent in their home country since the release of their first [[Single (music)|single]], "''[[The Carpenter]]''" (1997), they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums ''[[Oceanborn]]'' and ''[[Wishmaster (album)|Wishmaster]]'', which were released in 1998 and 2000 respectively. Their 2004 album, ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'', led to Nightwish video clips being shown on [[MTV]] in the [[United States]] and inclusion of their music in U.S. movie soundtracks. Their biggest U.S. hit single, "''[[Wish I Had an Angel]]''" (2004), made it onto two U.S. film soundtracks as a means to promote their North American tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for the album, as well as "[[Sleeping Sun]]", from the 2005 "[[Greatest hits|best of]]" compilation album, ''[[Highest Hopes]]'', prior to vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]]'s departure.

The extensive search for Turunen's replacement, during the course of which anyone could have been considered by submitting a [[demo (music)|demo]], ended in early 2007. Recently, the band declared that the new vocalist will be announced on [[May 30]], [[2007]], together with the release of a new single called "[[Eva (song)|Eva]]"<ref>[http://www.nightwish.com/en/news "The auditions for the new vocalist have ended"]</ref>. On [[September 26]], [[2007]], [[Nightwish's sixth studio album|the album]] on which "Eva" will be featured will be released.

==Band history==
===''Angels Fall First'' (1996–1997)===
[[Image:Nightwish2.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Nightwish's ''[[Angels Fall First]]'' line-up. From left to right: [[Emppu Vuorinen]], [[Jukka Nevalainen]], [[Tuomas Holopainen]] and [[Tarja Turunen]]]]
Nightwish was the brainchild of [[Tuomas Holopainen]], conceived after spending a night around a campfire with friends. The band formed shortly after, in July 1996. Holopainen invited guitarist [[Emppu Vuorinen|Erno "Emppu" Vuorinen]], who was a fairly new acquaintance, and vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]] to the project, as she was gaining renown around the school they attended for her excellent vocal skills.

Their style at the time was based on the experimentations of Holopainen with using [[Synthesizer|keyboards]], [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]]s and the operatic vocals of Tarja Turunen. The three musicians then recorded an [[Acoustic instrument|acoustic]] [[Demo (Nightwish)|demo album]] from [[October]] to [[December]] of 1996. There were three songs on this demo: "[[Nightwish (song)|Nightwish]]" (of which the band derived its name), "[[The Forever Moments]]" and "[[Etiäinen (song)|Etiäinen]]". The first idea of the band was to create music much alike the music played around campfires. However, Holopainen decided that Turunen's voice was too powerful for a project like this one, and decided to add in metal elements.

In early 1997, [[Drum|drummer]] [[Jukka Nevalainen]] joined the band. At the same time the acoustic guitar was replaced by an [[electric guitar]]. In April the band went into the studio in order to record seven songs, including an improved version of the demo-song "Etiäinen". These songs can be found on the limited edition of the album ''[[Angels Fall First]]''.

In May of the same year, they signed with the Finnish record label [[Spinefarm Records]] for two albums. ''Angels Fall First'' was released in November and reached number 31 on the Finnish album charts. A previously released single, "[[The Carpenter]]", reached number 3 on the Finnish singles chart.

The critical reception of ''Angels Fall First'' has been mixed. [[All Music Guide]] rated the album 2 out of 5<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | title=allmusic | work=Angels Fall First | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:lza9qj1qojfa | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and sources like ''The Metal Observer'' stated that Nightwish's debut album paled drastically in comparison to their later work.<ref name="metalobsv">{{cite web | title=The Metal Observer | work=Review – Nightwish – Angels Fall First | url=http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&sid=1&id=2621 | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>. However, on [[Encyclopaedia Metallum]], which features listener reviews, the album scored an average rating of 91%.<ref name="TMA">{{cite web | title=Encyclopaedia Metallum | work=Entry: Nightwish – Angels Fall First | url=http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=133 | accessmonthday=February 23 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

December 1997 marked their first concert, which was played in their hometown. During the winter of 1997–98, the band performed only seven more times because Nevalainen and Vuorinen were fulfilling their obligatory military service and Turunen had not yet finished her studies.

===''Oceanborn / Wishmaster'' (1998–2000)===
[[Image:Nightwish-deepsilentcomplete.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cover for the ''[[Deep Silent Complete]]'' single, released in 2000]]
In 1998, [[Bass guitar|bassist]] [[Sami Vänskä]], an old friend of Holopainen, joined the band. After shooting a video clip for the song "The Carpenter", they released ''[[Oceanborn]]'', the follow-up to ''Angels Fall First''. This album was more technical and progressive than their first release in terms of songwriting and arrangements.<ref name="jamesbyrd">{{cite web | title=James Byrd Tribute | work=Nightwish – Oceanborn | url=http://www.geocities.com/byrdtribute/nightwishocean.html | accessmonthday=December 27 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> The album also featured [[Tapio Wilska]] (ex-[[Finntroll]]) on two songs ("Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean" and "The Pharaoh Sails to Orion"). It reached number 5 on the Finnish album charts. The first single from that album, ''[[Sacrament of Wilderness]]'', went straight to number 1 on the Finnish single charts. ([[Media:Nightwish-sacramentofwilderness.ogg|sample]]).

The second single to come out was "[[Walking in the Air (Nightwish)|Walking in the Air]]", a cover of [[Howard Blake]]'s piece, part of ''[[The Snowman]]'s'' [[soundtrack]].

In 1999, they recorded the single "[[Sleeping Sun (Four Ballads of the Eclipse)]]", for the [[solar eclipse]] in [[Germany]]. This single sold 15,000 copies during the first month in Germany. ''Oceanborn'' was a certified [[Gold album|gold]] in August.<ref name="rockdetector">{{cite web | title=Rockdetector | work=Nightwish Official Biography | url=http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,6372.sm | accessmonthday=December 28 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

In 2000, Nightwish participated in the Finnish qualification for the [[2000 Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[Sleepwalker (song)|Sleepwalker]]". They finished the contest in second place. They won the public televoting, but the jury overruled ([[Media:Nightwish-sleepwalker.ogg|sample]]). As [[Lordi]] won both the Finnish qualification and the whole [[2006 Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision Song Contest]] in [[2006 in music|2006]], Holopainen was asked in an interview if he felt that they could have done it better (since they both are in the [[metal]] genre). Holopainen answered that he wasn't sorry; Lordi are great guys, and he's proud of them showing what Finland can do<ref>[http://www.tuomasholopainen.net/int-thnet2.html "TuomasHolopainen.net: Interview"]</ref>.

In May they released the album ''[[Wishmaster (album)|Wishmaster]]'' which went straight to number 1 on the Finnish album charts, and remained there for three weeks. During those three weeks it was certified gold. ''Wishmaster'' was, despite long-awaited releases from [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Bon Jovi]], which happened simultaneously, declared album of the month by the German magazine ''[[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]]''.

===''Over the Hills and Far Away / Century Child'' (2001–2003)===
[[Image:Overhillsfarawayvideo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The band in the video clip for "[[Over the Hills and Far Away (album)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]"]]

In 2001 Nightwish recorded a cover of [[Gary Moore]]'s "Over the Hills and Far Away" together with a few new songs and a remake of an old one. This was released as the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Over the Hills and Far Away (album)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]''. The record counted with guest performances by [[Tony Kakko]] (from the [[power metal]] band [[Sonata Arctica]]) and [[Tapio Wilska]]. They also released a [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Compact disc|CD]] with live material recorded in a show in [[Tampere]], on [[December 29]] 2000. All of these were entitled ''[[From Wishes to Eternity]]''. Shortly afterwards, Sami Vänskä was asked to leave the band by Tuomas, and [[Marco Hietala]] ([[Tarot (band)|Tarot]], ex-[[Sinergy]]) joined the band, effectively leaving Sinergy. The bassist would, apart from playing his instrument, also perform male vocals. Tuomas has afterwords said that he and Sami still keep in touch, killing off rumours saying that they haven't met since. Though, they are not interested in making another project together.

In 2002 Nightwish released ''[[Century Child]]'', and the singles "[[Ever Dream]]" and "[[Bless the Child (song)|Bless the Child]]". The main difference from previous albums is the use of a live [[orchestra]] from Finland on "Bless the Child", "Ever Dream", "Feel For You" and "The Beauty of the Beast", to get a more present feeling of [[European classical music|classical music]].  An enduring favorite of fans, though, is the band's version of "Phantom of the Opera", from the famous musical of the same name by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.  ''Century Child'' was certified gold two hours after its release, and platinum two weeks afterwards. It set a record on the Finnish album charts as well; never before had the second been so distant from the first place. After the "[[Bless the Child (song)|Bless the Child]]" video, a second one was recorded, without any single support. The chosen track was "[[End of All Hope]]". The clip contains pieces from the Finnish movie, ''[[Kohtalon kirja]]'' (English: ''The Book of Fate'').<ref name="kohtalon">{{cite web | title=Kohtalon Kirja | work=Kohtalon Kirja DVD | url=http://www.kohtalonkirja.com/dvd | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

In 2003, Nightwish released a second DVD, entitled ''[[End of Innocence]]'' that tells the story of the band in Holopainen and Nevalainen's words for two hours. The documentary also features bits of live concerts, exclusive footage, etc. Tarja also got married during the summer of 2003, and there were rumours that the band was about to be dissolved. These rumours were, at the time, proven to be false, as the band continued on to play concerts for another year and released another album.

===''Once'' (2004–2005)===
{{main|Once (Nightwish album)}}
[[Image:Tuska_wed_nw.jpg|right|thumb|190px|A poster advertising Nightwish's concert]]
A new album entitled ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'' was released on [[June 7]], [[2004]], along with their first single, "[[Nemo (song)|Nemo]]" (Latin for "nobody"), from that album. The single topped the charts in Finland and [[Hungary]], and reached the top ten in five additional countries. "Nemo" therefore remains their most successful single release to date.

''Once'' utilizes a full orchestra in nine of the eleven songs on the album. Unlike ''Century Child'', Nightwish decided to look for an orchestra outside of Finland this time, choosing the [[London Session Orchestra]]. It is also their second album to feature a full-length song in Finnish, "[[Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan|Kuolema tekee taiteilijan]]" (English: "Death Creates an Artist"). ''Once'' has sold triple platinum in Finland, platinum in [[Germany]], gold in [[Sweden]] and reached #1 in the [[Greece|Greek]], [[Norway|Norwegian]] and Hungarian album charts. The following singles were: "[[Wish I Had an Angel]]" (featured on the soundtrack of the ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'' film), "[[Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan]]" (released only in Finland and [[Japan]]) and "[[The Siren (song)|The Siren]]". Besides the commercial success, ''Once'' was also accepted by critics, with many positive reviewers (such as ''Metalfan.nl''<ref name="metalfan">{{cite web | title=Metalfan.nl | work=Nightwish – Once | url=http://www.metalfan.nl/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=1168 | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and ''RockReport.be'')<ref name="rockreport">{{cite web | title=RockReport.be | work=Nightwish – Once | url=http://www.rockreport.be/review.asp?id=711 | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> drawing comparisons with ''Oceanborn''.

The success of the album allowed them to perform the ''Once World Tour'', which enabled them to play in many countries the band had never visited before. Nightwish performed at the opening ceremony of the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]], held in [[Helsinki]],<ref name="helsingin">{{cite web | title=Helsingin Sanomat | work=Helsinki skies open as World Championships get under way | url=http://www.helsinginsanomat.fi/english/article/Helsinki+skies+open+as+World+Championships+get+under+way%0D%0A/1101980518329 | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> highlighting acclaim the band has recently gained.

A "best of" album was released in September 2005, containing songs from their whole discography. 
The compilation is entitled ''[[Highest Hopes]]'', also featuring a live cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s song "[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]" (from the ''[[The Division Bell]]'' album).

This song was the first in which Hietala performs the vocals by himself ([[Media:Nightwish-highhopes.ogg|sample]]). Besides ''High Hopes'', a remake of "[[Sleeping Sun]]" (from ''Oceanborn'') was put on the album, which was also released as a single. A new video for "Sleeping Sun" was shot, featuring a [[medieval]] battle, and can be found on the German release of the single and as a separate DVD released by Spinefarm.

===''End of an Era'' (2005–2006)===
[[Image:Nw_helsinki_0048.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Playing ''[[Creek Mary's Blood]]'' with [[John Two-Hawks]] at the [[Hartwall Areena]]]]
{{main|End of an Era}}
After the recording in the [[Hartwall Areena]] (Helsinki) on the 21st of October, 2005, of the new live DVD ''[[End of an Era]]'' (released June 2006), the four other members of Nightwish decided that it was best to continue Nightwish without Tarja Turunen,<ref name="wikisource">{{cite web | publisher=Wikisource | title=Open letter from Tuomas Holopainen | url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Open_Letter_To_Tarja_Turunen | accessmonthday=October 23 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> a feeling they expressed through an [[open letter]] which was given to Turunen by Tuomas Holopainen after the concert, and afterwards posted on the band's website.  The main justification of Turunen's dismissal given in the letter was that the band felt that her husband Marcelo Cabuli, an Argentinian businessman, and [[Commercialism|commercial]] interests had changed her attitude towards the band. 

Turunen responded to the incident, saying that her dismissal came entirely as a shock to her, given that she had not been notified before the letter was given to her. She felt that the personal attacks on her husband were unwarranted, and that playing the issue out to the public was "senselessly cruel". She expressed these feelings through her own open letter, which was published on her personal website,<ref name="tarjaturunena">{{cite web | publisher=METALYOU.COM | title=Tarja Turunen Letter to the band, fans and media | url=http://www.metalyou.com/band/nightwish/news/nightwish_tarja_turunen_letter_to_the_band_fans_and_media/ | accessmonthday=August 16 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and through various TV, magazine, and newspaper interviews.

===Recording the sixth studio album (2006—)===
{{main|Nightwish's sixth studio album}}
[[Image:Nightwish-2006.jpg|thumb|200px|Vuorinen and Hietala practicing newly-written material]]
The band entered the studio on [[September 15]], [[2006]] to record their [[Nightwish's sixth studio album|sixth full-length studio album]]. The process began with drum recordings, with guitar, bass and demo keyboards, followed by orchestral/choir recordings. After those, the final synthesizers and vocals will be recorded.

To find a replacement for Turunen as the female vocalist of the band, on March 17, 2006 the band allowed vocalists interested for the position to send in demo tapes as an audition for the spot. The band stated that it was looking for a vocalist with the ability to sing with good dynamics and versatility. However, to the surprise of some fans, the band did not specifically ask for a classically trained singer, but were open to a variety of styles and backgrounds. By the time auditions were over on January 15, 2007, the band had received over 2,000 demo tapes.<ref>[http://www.nightwish.com/en/news "The auditions for the new vocalist have ended"]</ref>

During this time, speculation began to emerge as to who would eventually succeed Turunen as the female vocalist for the band. In response to these and other rumors, the band stated on their website that fans should not believe any source other than the band itself for information regarding the new vocalist.

"[[Eva (song)|Eva]]" will be the first single released for their upcoming 2007 album. It will be the first to feature their new vocalist, who will be revealed simultaneously in a press statement and on the band's website on May 30, 2007.

==Music==
===Influence===
Tuomas Holopainen, writer of most of the band's lyrics and [[Sheet music|musical score]]s, says that he gets most of the inspiration for Nightwish's songs from [[Film score|film music]]. Songs like "''[[Beauty of the Beast]]''" (from ''[[Century Child]]'') and "''[[Ghost Love Score]]''" (from ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'') are examples of this influence. Other songs, such as "''[[Romanticide]]''" and "''[[Wish I Had an Angel]]''" (both from ''Once'') have elements reminiscent of [[techno]] music. Holopainen has also said that film music is the music he is listening to sitting back home. He likes for example the musical scores to ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'' and ''[[Crimson Tide]]'', and practically everything written by [[Hans Zimmer]]. 

On the other hand, Nightwish has also been noted as a source of inspiration for other bands. [[Simone Simons]], lead singer of [[Epica (band)|Epica]], stated that she began singing due to Nightwish.<ref name="epica">{{cite web | title=Epica Online | work=Profile Simone | url=http://www.epica.nl/index.php?id=45&section=band | accessmonthday=December 28 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Ex-singer of [[Visions of Atlantis]] [[Nicole Bogner]] also acknowledged that Nightwish had greatly inspired them for their first album.<ref name="musdiscvisions">{{cite web | title=Musical Discoveries | work=Visions of Atlantis (Nicole Bogner) | url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/voa.htm | accessmonthday=December 30 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> [[Sander Gommans]] of [[After Forever]] said that Nightwish "will certainly influence us in creating new songs"<ref name="musdiscafter">{{cite web | title=Musical Discoveries | work=After Forever | url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/aftfor.htm | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>. [[Power metal]] band [[Sonata Arctica]]'s lead singer [[Tony Kakko]] has several times explained how much of an influence Nightwish is to him<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Kakko Wikipedia - Tony Kakko]</ref>.

===Musical style===
A precise definition for Nightwish's musical style is disputed. The band has been suggested as being part of the genres [[gothic metal]], [[symphonic metal]], and [[power metal]].

The definition [[symphonic metal]] is based on Nightwish's inclusion of instruments and vocal styles of [[classical music]] and [[film scores]]. The uplifting [[fantasy]] themes, epic atmospheres, high vocals, guitar and keyboard solos and fast mellodic musical style of Nightwish's music, especialy the first 3 albums, places them in the [[power metal]] genre similar to other Finnish bands such as [[Sonata Arctica]] and [[Stratovarius]]. The [[gothic metal]] tag is usual used by magazines such as [[Kerrang]], as many Nightwish songs, especialy those on the more recent albums, have a dark feel unusual for [[power metal]] and their fanbase includes those perceived as [[goths]] as well as [[metalheads]]. [[Soprano]] vocals are also rare in power metal compared to the usual male [[falsetto]], and are more common in [[gothic metal]] bands such as [[Tristania (band)|Tristania]] and [[Theatre of Tragedy]].

Tuomas Holopainen once described their music as "melodic heavy metal with a female vocalist".<ref name="nightfall">{{cite web | title=Nightfall | work=Nightfall interview with: Tuomas Holopainen from Nightwish | url=http://www.nightfall.co.nz/interview_detail.php?interviewID=52 | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

A new era for Nightwish's musical style began with ''Century Child'' and was developed further with ''Once''. The guitars were downtuned and simplified to a lower rythmical sound closer to modern [[hard rock]] than the old melodic [[power metal]] style leads and Tarja's vocals lost some of their operatic edge, becoming closer to standard [[rock music|rock]] female singing. Male vocals from new bassist [[Marco Hietala]] added a new, rougher dimension to certain songs. The escapist fantasy themes of older Nightwish was gradualy replaced with more [[gothic]] imagery. Lead band member [[Tuomas Holopainen]] has in an interview said that [[Nightwish's sixth studio album|the new album]] will have a lot in common with the last album (''[[Once]]''). For example, the band will keep the new kind of harder songs (such as "[[Nemo (song)|Nemo]]", "[[Wish I Had an Angel]]" and "[[Planet Hell]]"), but there will as well be softer ballads. The new album includes lots of guest musicians and orchestral parts - in the same interview, Tuomas said that as they recorded ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'' they had 18 people in the [[choir]], and still this wasn't enough.
