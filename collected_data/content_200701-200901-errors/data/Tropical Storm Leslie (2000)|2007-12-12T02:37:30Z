'''Tropical Storm Leslie''' was the costliest [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2000 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The twelfth named storm of the season, Leslie formed out of a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure on [[October 4]] to the east of [[Florida]]. Initially a [[subtropical cyclone]], it strengthened and attained enough [[tropical cyclogenesis|tropical characteristics]] to be reclassified as Tropical Storm Leslie on [[October 5]]. Leslie reached peak winds of 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h) before [[wind shear]] weakened it, and on [[October 7]] it transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] over the open [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It lasted three more days before losing its identity.

Leslie had little impact as a tropical cyclone. The precursor trough of low pressure produced torrential rainfall across Florida, peaking at 17.5&nbsp;inches (440&nbsp;mm). The flooding damaged thousands of houses and caused three indirect deaths. Damage in southern Florida totaled $950&nbsp;million (2000&nbsp;USD, $1.1&nbsp;billion 2006&nbsp;USD), of which around half was from agricultural damage. After the flooding, portions of south Florida were declared a disaster area.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Leslie 2000 track.png}}
On [[September 27]], a tropical wave entered the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]], likely the same wave that spawned [[2000 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Isaac|Hurricane Isaac]]. It moved generally westward, and remained weak with only sporadic thunderstorm activity. The wave traversed around the periphery of [[Hurricane Keith]], and developed a mid-level circulation just south of western [[Cuba]] by [[October 2]]. It continued to organize as it moved to the northwest, prompting a [[Hurricane Hunters|Reconnaissance Aircraft]] into the area. However, the system lacked a surface circulation center, and remained an elongated trough of low pressure. The tropical wave interacted with an approaching frontal trough, while its mid-level center turned to the northeast and made landfall near [[Sarasota, Florida]] on [[October 4]]. While over land, a surface circulation developed near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and the National Hurricane Center designated the system as [[Subtropical cyclone|Subtropical Depression]] One. The subtropical designation occurred due to deep convection far removed from the center,<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=James L. Franklin and Daniel P. Brown|year=2000|title=Tropical Storm Leslie Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-06-19|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2000leslie.html}}</ref> as well as an upper level trough instead of an anticyclone providing support for the system.<ref name="lesdis1">{{cite web|author=James L.

[[Image:Pre-Leslie Trough.JPG|right|thumb|Precursor Trough over Florida]]
The subtropical depression moved to the east-northeast, and steadily organized as deep convection developed closer to the center. Peak winds in the system, which were 175&nbsp;miles (280&nbsp;km) from the center when it first formed, were only 85&nbsp;miles (135&nbsp;km) from the center by the morning of [[October 5]]. Based on its organization and winds of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h), the system was redesignated as Tropical Storm Leslie. As Leslie moved to the east-northeast, it strengthened slightly to reach winds of 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h). The storm interacted with an approaching cold front, and became extratropical on [[October 7]] while 375&nbsp;miles (600&nbsp;km) north of [[Bermuda]]. The extratropical storm accelerated to the northeast and passed over [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] on the 8th. It turned to the east then southeast, strengthening to near hurricane-force winds before losing its identity near [[Ireland]] on the 10th.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
The [[National Hurricane Center]] predicted the trough of low pressure to drop very heavy rainfall across western [[Cuba]] and [[Florida]].<ref name="two">{{cite web|author=Franklin/Brown|year=2000|title=October 2, 2000 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=National hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-06-20|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2000100215.ABNT20}}</ref> The National Weather Service in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] issued a flood watch for southern Florida, stating that the system could produce flooding on roads and low-lying areas.<ref name="nws">{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|year=2000|title=FLOOD WATCH FOR MOST OF SOUTH FLORIDA THROUGH TUESDAY|accessdate=2006-06-20|url=http://flhurricane.com/cgi-bin/cfhcnews?talkback+127+1+38+2000}}</ref> As a pre-emptive measure, water managers moved water out of canals.<ref name="sofla">{{cite web|author=Miami-Dade Emergency Management|year=2005|title=Local Mitigation Strategy|accessdate=2006-06-21|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/eoc/library/LMS_strategy.pdf}}</ref> In general, however, there was little warning for the flooding in Florida.<ref name="prep">{{cite web|author=South Dade Conveyance System|title=Pre-Storm / Storm / and Storm Recovery Operations for the South Dade Conveyance System|accessdate=2006-06-21|url=http://hpm.saj.usace.army.mil/issueweb/Sparrow/fiopeis/Appendices/Appendix%20A/IOP%20Pre-storm%20Ops.doc}}</ref> While Leslie was moving east-northeastward, it posed a threat to [[Bermuda]], prompting officials to issue a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|Tropical Storm Warning]].

The precursor disturbance of Leslie dropped heavy rainfall across central and western [[Cuba]], peaking at 8.25&nbsp;inches (210&nbsp;mm) in the province of [[Havana]].

Flood waters in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] covered about 40,000&nbsp;acres (160 km²) of agricultural land, causing severe problems for farmers. The flooding occurred at the beginning of the planting period for the winter season.

As an extratropical storm, Leslie produced winds of around 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) while making landfall in Newfoundland. It also produced waves of up to 16&nbsp;feet (5&nbsp;m) in height, along with rainfall totals of around 1&nbsp;inch (30&nbsp;mm). The overall impact in this region was minor.<ref name="chc">{{cite web|author=Canadian Hurricane Centre|year=2000|title=2000 Tropical Cyclone Season Summary|accessdate=2006-06-22|url=http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/storm00.html}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
In the immediate aftermath, cleanup workers could not work until the floodwaters receded. In addition, abandoned cars blocked the path of utility workers.<ref name="rcreport"/> Following the storm, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] declared [[Broward County, Florida|Broward]], [[Collier County, Florida|Collier]], [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] and [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe Counties]] as disaster areas, allowing for the use of federal funds for the disaster victims.<ref name="fldeclar">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2000|title=President Orders Disaster Aid For Florida Storm Victims|accessdate=2006-06-22|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=7854}}</ref> In addition, Miami-Dade and Broward Counties were declared eligible for Federal Infrastructure Assistance, including providing 75% of the debris removal cost and repairing or replacing public roads, buildings, parks, and treatment plants.<ref name="fldeclar2">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2000|title=Miami-Dade, Broward Declared Eligible For Federal Infrastructure Assistance|accessdate=2006-06-22|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=7850}}</ref> By 10 days after the storm, government agencies distributed 105,000 meals, 141,000&nbsp;gallons (534,000&nbsp;l) of water, and 357,000&nbsp;pounds (162,000&nbsp;kg) of ice.<ref name="relief">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2000|title=Florida Flood Disaster Update|accessdate=2006-06-22|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=7848}}</ref> Thousands visited five Disaster Recovery Centers, where information on disaster-related issues was given.<ref name="drc">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2000|title=Mobile Disaster Recovery Center Moves To North Miami Beach; Broward County Disaster Recovery Center To Close Saturday|accessdate=2006-06-22|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=7848}}</ref> By around two months after the flooding, over 51,000 applied for federal aid, with assistance totaling to more than $170&nbsp;million (2000&nbsp;USD, $199&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).<ref name="totalass">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2000|title=South Florida Disaster Update: More Than $170 Million Approved; Applications Top 51,000 Mark as Dec. 4 Deadline Approaches|accessdate=2006-06-22|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=7848}}</ref>

Because the storm caused little damage as a tropical cyclone, the name '''Leslie''' was not retired, and is on the list for the [[2006 Atlantic hurricane season|2006 season]].
