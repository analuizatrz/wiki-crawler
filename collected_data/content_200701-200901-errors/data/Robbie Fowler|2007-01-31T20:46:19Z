'''Robert Bernard 'Robbie' Fowler''', born [[9 April]] [[1975]], and commonly known as "God" by Liverpool F.C. supporters, is an [[England|English]] [[Football (soccer)|footballer]] who currently plays as a [[striker]] for [[Liverpool F.C]].

Fowler's career began with Liverpool, with whom he made his debut in 1993. Fowler scored 120 premiership goals for Liverpool in an eight year period. He subsequently played for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Manchester City F.C.]], before returning to Liverpool in January 2006. As of May [[2006]], Fowler is the [[FA Premier League#Top scorers|fourth highest goalscorer]] in [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] history, behind [[Thierry Henry]], [[Andy Cole]] and [[Alan Shearer]]. 

He has been [[cap (football)|capped]] for [[England national football team|England]] twenty-six times, scoring seven goals. The most recent of these appearances came in the [[FIFA World Cup 2002|2002 World Cup]].

==Early life==
Fowler was born in [[Liverpool]] and brought up in the [[Toxteth]] area. As a youngster he was an ardent [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] supporter, regularly travelling to [[Goodison Park]]. He was selected for Liverpool Schoolboys from the age of 11 and was spotted by Liverpool scout Jim Aspinall. He began training with Liverpool once a week and signed schoolboy forms with the club. Two years later he signed on as a YTS trainee and he turned professional in April 1992 on his seventeenth birthday.

==Football career==
===Liverpool===
Fowler's first involvement with the Liverpool first team came on [[13 January]] [[1993]], when he was an unused substitute in an [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton]]. In the following close season, Fowler helped the England Under-18 team to win the 1993 European Championship, before making a scoring first-team debut in Liverpool's 3&ndash;1 win in a first round Coca Cola Cup tie at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on [[22 September]] [[1993]]. Fowler scored all five goals in the second leg at Anfield two weeks later, making him the fourth player in Liverpool's history to score five in a senior fixture. He scored his first league [[hat-trick]] against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in only his fifth league game. His first thirteen games for the club yielded twelve goals., He was rewarded with an England Under-21 debut against [[San Marino national under-21 football team|San Marino]] in November 1993, in which he scored England's opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio throughout the season, but finished his first season as the club's leading scorer with eighteen goals in all competitions. 

In the [[1994-95 in English football|1994-95]] season, Fowler was an ever-present for Liverpool, playing in all of their 57 matches, including the victory in the 1995 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final, and a match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]  in which he scored a hat-trick in four minutes and thirty-three seconds,<ref>{{cite book |author=Robbie Fowler and David Maddock |title=Fowler: My Autobiography |d=ISBN 1-4050-5132-9 | publisher=Macmillan |year=2005 |pages=128 }}</ref> a Premiership record. Fowler was voted the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] in two consecutive years (in 1995 and 1996), a feat equalled only by [[Ryan Giggs]] and [[Wayne Rooney]]. In 1996, he scored four against [[Middlesbrough F.C.]], reaching a century of goals one game quicker than his mentor, [[Ian Rush]]. Fowler received a call-up to the full England squad for the first time in 1996, winning his first cap on [[27 March]] against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] as a substitute, and making his first start at international level in England's next match, against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. Fowler was part of the England squad for [[1996 European Football Championship|Euro 96]], making two appearances in the tournament.  

Throughout the mid and late 1990s, Fowler was widely considered to be the most natural finisher playing in England.<ref>{{cite web|authorlink= |coauthors= |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/11/19/sfntal20.xml |title=
Gripping battle of the red predators |format= |pages= |publisher=The Telegraph | language= |accessdate=19 June |accessyear=2006 }}</ref> Fowler sealed this reputation as he scored more than thirty goals for three consecutive seasons, up to 1997. [[Stan Collymore]], Fowler's old strike partner, said in his autobiography that Fowler was the "best player he has ever played with". 

In 1997, after scoring a goal in a [[Cup Winners' Cup]] game, he lifted his Liverpool shirt to reveal a T-shirt supporting sacked [[Liverpool Dockers' Strike|Liverpool dockers]] for which he picked up a fine, but greatly increased his popularity on [[Merseyside]]. That year, he also won a [[UEFA]] [[UEFA Fair Play ranking|Fair Play]] award for admitting that he had not been fouled by [[David Seaman]] at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] after a penalty had been given. After unsuccessfully trying to convince the referee to change his decision about the penalty Fowler took it tamely and Seaman saved, the ball rebounded however and [[Jason McAteer]] tucked it home.

Fowler was part of a group of Liverpool players from the mid-1990s who were nicknamed "The Spice Boys" by the press following a series of off-field controversies. The term was coined by the [[Daily Mail]], and arose due to rumours that Fowler was dating [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Emma Bunton]], which turned out not to be true.<ref>Fowler: My Autobiography, p171-173</ref> The term was subsequently used in a derogatory manner, implying Fowler and colleagues such as [[Jamie Redknapp]], [[Stan Collymore]], [[David James (footballer)|David James]] and [[Steve McManaman]] were underachieving playboys.

Fowler's downturn in fortunes began in 1998, after a knee ligament injury kept him out of action for half the season and caused him to miss a chance to go to the [[Football World Cup 1998|1998 World Cup]]. This also coincided with the rise of [[Michael Owen]] whose debut came in 1997, Owen firmly established himself in Fowler's absence. 

In 1999, Fowler was fined £60,000 by Liverpool and the [[FA Premier League]] for bringing the game into disrepute after he had mimed snorting [[cocaine]] off the white line of the [[Penalty area (football)|penalty area]] while celebrating his goal against [[Everton F.C.]]. Defending himself, he said that he was getting back at Everton fans who had insulted him with false accusations of [[Recreational drug use|drug abuse]]. Fowler also received a four match suspension from the [[The Football Association|the FA]] for this incident. At the same FA disciplinary hearing, Fowler received a further two match suspension due to a separate incident in which he had taunted [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] defender [[Graeme Le Saux]] over rumours of the other player's sexuality, by waving his backside at him. The FA imposed a £32,000 fine for the two incidents.

When the team came under review by new coach [[Gérard Houllier]], Fowler refocussed himself and won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], [[FA Cup]] and [[UEFA Cup]] with the Reds in 2001, he captained the side in the league cup final scoring the first goal and a penalty in the shootout; he scored Liverpool's fourth in the 5&ndash;4 UEFA Cup win. 

In October [[2001]], he scored his first league hat-trick for three years, helping Liverpool beat [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] 4&ndash;1, but was dropped for the following game. His last appearance in his first period at Liverpool was against [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] when he was substituted at half-time.

===Leeds United===
Despite his popularity with Liverpool fans, a combination of off-field controversy, disputes with Gérard Houllier and training ground arguments with then Assistant Manager [[Phil Thompson]],<ref>{{cite web | title= Robbie Fowler| work=ESPN Soccernet | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7956&cc=5739| accessdate=September 10| accessyear=2006 }}</ref> led to Fowler's departure to [[Leeds United F.C.]] Fowler maintains that Houllier forced him out of Liverpool, and has accused Houllier of pressuring the [[Liverpool Echo]] newspaper to use its influence to turn opinion against him.<ref name="Observer">{{cite web | title= 	
Don't look back in anger | work=Observer Sport Monthly profile | url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,6903,1560059,00.html| accessdate=May 21| accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

The transfer went ahead just one month after his hat-trick at Leicester with a fee of £11 million. He made his Leeds debut in an away game against Fulham, the same venue as his Liverpool debut. Fowler scored 12 goals in the remainder of the season, helping Leeds to a [[UEFA Cup]] qualifying place. Fowler was included in the England squad for the 2002 World Cup, but only made one appearance, coming on as substitute in a second round win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. 

Fowler suffered an aggravation of a pre-existing hip injury in the 2002-03 pre-season, and did not recover until December. Struggling to gain fitness, and seeing team-mates sold off due to a financial crisis, Fowler's form and market value dimished. However, in total he scored 15 goals in 31 appearances for Leeds; a goal every two games.

===Manchester City===
In the [[2002-03 in English football|2002-03 season]], Fowler was transferred to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] following a protracted transfer saga. Fowler initially turned down the move, and dispute between Manchester City manager [[Kevin Keegan]] and chairman [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] over whether the transfer should take place due to medical concerns resulted in Bernstein leaving the club. Following encouragement from Keegan, Fowler finally signed for Manchester City on [[16 January]] [[2003]] for an initial fee of £3 million and a further £3 million dependent upon appearances. Bizarre transfer conditions meant Leeds United still paid a significant proportion of Fowler's wages. Fowler made his Manchester City debut against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on [[1 February]] [[2003]], but made a poor start to his Manchester City career, scoring just two goals in the remainder of the season. 

Fowler continued to struggle with fitness problems in the 2003-04 season, completing the full 90 minutes only nine times. The arrival of close friend [[Steve McManaman]] from [[Real Madrid]] gave hope, but the pair failed to rekindle their prolific partnership of yesteryear, and received much criticism from the fans and tabloids for their salaries and alleged excesses.<ref>{{cite web | title= Spice Boy grows up| work=Guardian | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1308935,00.html| accessdate=June 21| accessyear=2006 }}</ref> In 2004 Fowler, depressed by his lack of form and fitness, considered retiring, but was persuaded to carry on by Kevin Keegan and [[Stuart Pearce]].<ref>Fowler: My Autobiography, p354-355</ref> He then showed a marked improvement in the second half of the [[2004-05 in English football|2004–2005]] season, scoring his 150th Premiership goal in the 3&ndash;2 win over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich]] on [[28 February]] [[2005]]. However, his failure to convert a 90th minute penalty kick against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the final game of the season prevented Manchester City from entrance into the [[UEFA Cup]]. Fowler ended the season as the club's joint top goal scorer, and gained the approval of the fans, finishing in the top three in the fans' Player of the Year poll, described by Fowler as "one of the proudest achievements of my career".<ref>Fowler: My Autobiography, p347</ref>

Fowler had injury problems at the start of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005-06]] season, and rarely featured when fit, making just two substitute appearances in the first four months of the season. His first start of the season came against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe]] in the FA Cup on [[7 January]] [[2006]], in which he scored a hat-trick. The following week he scored Manchester City's third goal in their 3&ndash;1 win against local rivals [[Manchester United F.C.]] after coming on as substitute. His goal celebration against United would prove to have added significance in the following weeks. After scoring, he ran to the United supporters, holding up five fingers in reference to Liverpool's five [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] wins, in comparison to United's two. However, Fowler made only one more appearance for Manchester City before returning to Liverpool on a free transfer.

===Return to Liverpool===
On [[27 January]] [[2006]], Fowler rejoined Liverpool from Manchester City, signing a contract until the end of the season. His return was warmly welcomed amongst Liverpool fans, who still hold Fowler in high regard. Fowler remained a Liverpool fan after he initially left the club; he was in the [[Istanbul]] crowd when Liverpool won the Champions League in 2005. Upon his return to the club, he was unable to take the [[shirt number]] 9 (with which he had become so firmly associated in his first spell at Liverpool after inheriting it from the legendary [[Ian Rush]]), as it was then registered to [[Djibril Cissé]]; instead, he was given the number 11 shirt leading to the memorable banner "Fowler, God, 11, welcome back to heaven". However, for the 2006-07 season, with the departure of Cissé, he made the shirt his own once again.

Fowler's return against [[Birmingham City F.C.]] in February [[2006]] was labelled by the press as the stuff of fairytales, and he came on to a rapturous reception in his first appearance for Liverpool in four years. He almost claimed a shock goal to his name in that very match only for the referee to disallow the goal for offside. Since his return, he had three goals ruled out for [[Offside law (football)|offside]], but finally scored on [[15 March]] [[2006]] in a home game against [[Fulham]], the same opponent club he scored his first ever goal against while on his Liverpool debut 13 years earlier. Fowler's next Liverpool goal, against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], meant he overtook [[Kenny Dalglish]] in the club's all time top scorers, while he marked his 31st birthday with a goal against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. He made it four goals in five games when he scored the only goal in a 1-0 victory over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on [[April 16]] [[2006]].

One concern has been the striker's fitness. In March 2006, Rafael Benitez commented on how pleased he was with Fowler's work and progress adding, "to buy a Robbie Fowler who is fit and scoring goals would cost a lot, maybe £10m or more". Despite these concerns about his fitness, Fowler has been scoring on a far more consistent basis than Liverpool's other strikers. In May 2006 he was offered a new one year contract with the club,<ref> {{cite web | title= Fowler to sign new Liverpool deal| work=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4977356.stm| accessdate=May 21| accessyear=2006 }}</ref> and celebrated by scoring the first goal in Liverpool's last league game of the season in a 3-1 away win at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. It was his final game of the 2005-6 season, as he was unable to take part in the club's later [[2006 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] success due to being [[cup-tied]].

With the departure of both Cissé and [[Fernando Morientes]] to [[Olympique de Marseille]] and [[Valencia CF]] respectively, Fowler regained the number 9 shirt he wore during his first spell. 

On [[5 December]] , [[2006]], Robbie Fowler scored his first ever [[UEFA Champions League]] goal which came against [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray]]. Fowler then scored his second of the night in the 90th minute as Liverpool lost 3-2.

==Outside football==
Outside football, the Official British Horseracing website lists Fowler as a major celebrity [[horse racing|race horse]] owner, citing his and best friend [[Steve McManaman]]'s company, The Macca and Growler Partnership. In 2005, Fowler was listed as one of the 1,000 wealthiest Britons by the ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]''. Business interests including a large property portfolio have resulted in Fowler becoming the third wealthiest footballer,<ref>{{cite web |title=Beckham tops football's rich list |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6212696.stm|accessdate=December 6 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> in Britain, and led to the affectionate Manchester City chant; 'We all live in a Robbie Fowler house'.<ref name="Observer" /> 

On [[2 September]] [[2005]] he released 'Fowler: My Autobiography', about his time as a footballer and the issues surrounding him. Since his transfer to Liverpool he has updated it and included a section about his return to [[Anfield]]. Excerpts published in newspapers included criticism of the England management. 

Fowler married on [[9 June]] [[2001]].
