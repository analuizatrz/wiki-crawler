Almost a century later, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], which had been brought under English control between 1541 and 1691, joined the Kingdom of Great Britain with the passing of the [[Act of Union 1800]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.actofunion.ac.uk/actofunion.htm#act | title=The Act of Union |publisher=Act of Union Virtual Library |accessdaymonth=15 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Although England and Scotland had been separate states prior to 1707, they had been in [[personal union]] since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[James I of England|James VI King of Scots]] had inherited the throne of the Kingdoms of England and Ireland and moved his [[royal court|court]] from Edinburgh to London.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chronology of Scottish History|publisher=Geddes & Grosset|isbn=1855343800|last=Ross|first=David|date=2002|quote=''1603:'' James VI becomes [[James I of England]] in the [[Union of the Crowns]], and leaves Edinburgh for London|page=56}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Claiming Scotland: National Identity and Liberal Culture|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=1902930169|last=Hearn|first=Jonathan|date=2002|quote=Inevitably, James moved his court to London|page=104}}</ref>

[[Image:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|left|The [[British Empire]] in 1897. By 1920 it had become the [[list of largest empires|largest empire in history]].]]

In its first century, the United Kingdom played an important role in developing [[Western world|Western]] ideas of the [[parliamentary system]] as well as making significant contributions to literature, the arts and science.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Niall |authorlink=Niall Ferguson |year=2003 |title=Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0465023282}}</ref> The UK-led [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed the country and fuelled the growing [[British Empire]]. During this time, like other [[great power]]s, the UK was involved in [[Colonialism|colonial]] exploitation, including the [[Atlantic slave trade]], although the passing of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] in 1807 made it the first country to prohibit [[Slave trade|trade in slaves]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml Sailing against slavery.

After the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the UK emerged the principal naval power of the 19th century and remained an eminent power into the mid-20th century. The British Empire expanded to its maximum size by 1921, gaining the [[League of Nations]] mandate over former German and Ottoman colonies after [[World War I]].

Long simmering tensions in Ireland led to the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|partition]] of the island in 1920, followed by independence for the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 with Northern Ireland remaining within the UK. As a result, in 1927, the formal name of the UK was changed to its current name, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.<ref name="CAIN">{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm |title=The Anglo-Irish Treaty, 6 December 1921 |publisher=CAIN |accessdaymonth=15 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref> 

[[Image:Supermarinespitfire.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Britain]]. The UK was the only [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Europe]]an country to remain free from occupation during [[World War II]].]]

During the  1920s, the [[BBC]], the world's first large-scale international broadcasting network, was created. The UK fought  [[Nazi Germany]] as  one of the major Allied powers of  [[World War II]]  and helped plan the postwar world. World War II left the United Kingdom  financially damaged.  [[Marshall Plan|Marshall Aid]] and costly loans taken from both Canada and the United States  helped the UK on the road to recovery.

The immediate post-war years saw the establishment of the British [[Welfare State]], including one of the world's first and most comprehensive public [[National Health Service|health services]], while the demands of a recovering economy brought people from all over the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] to create a [[Immigration to the United Kingdom (1922-present day)|multiethnic Britain]].  Although the new postwar limits of Britain's [[decolonisation|political]] role were confirmed by the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956,  the international spread of the [[English language]] meant the continuing influence of its  [[British literature|literature]] and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|culture]], while  from the 1960s its [[popular culture]] also found influence abroad.

Following a period of global economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the 1980s saw the inflow of substantial [[North Sea oil]] revenues and economic growth. The premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] marked a significant change of direction from the post-war political and economic consensus; a path that has continued under the [[Labour Party (UK)#New Labour|New Labour]] governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] since 1997.

The United Kingdom was one of the 12 founding members of the [[European Union]] at its launch in 1992 with the signing of the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Prior to that, it had been a member of the EU's forerunner, the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), from 1973.

The United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as head of state; the monarch of the UK also serves as head of state of fifteen other [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth countries]], putting the UK in a [[personal union]] with those other states. The Crown has sovereignty over the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]]. Collectively, these three territories are known as the [[Crown Dependencies]] which are lands owned by the British monarch but not part of the United Kingdom, though the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate for them and the UK government manages their foreign affairs and defence.

The [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]] governs the legal framework of the country and consists mostly of written sources, including [[statute]]s, judge made [[case law]], and international treaties. As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and [[law]] considered to be "constitutional law," the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] can perform "constitutional reform" simply by passing [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] and thus has the [[political power|power]] to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution. However, no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/sovereignty.cfm|title=Official UK Parliament web page on parliamentary sovereignty}}</ref> The United Kingdom is one of the three countries in the world today that does not have a codified [[constitution]] (the other two being [[New Zealand]] and [[Israel]]).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.llrx.com/features/uk2.htm#UK%20Legal%20System |title=A Guide To the UK Legal System |author=Sarah Carter |publisher=[[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]] |accessdaymonth=16 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

[[Image:Location of the BOTs.png|thumb|right|The UK's remaining [[British overseas territories|overseas territories]]]]

The UK has a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary government]] based on the [[Westminster system]] that has been emulated around the world — a legacy of the [[British Empire]]. The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that meets in the [[Palace of Westminster]] has two houses: an elected [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and an appointed [[House of Lords]], and any Bill passed requires [[Royal Assent]] to become law. It is the ultimate legislative authority in the United Kingdom since the devolved parliament in [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]] and devolved assemblies in [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]], and [[National Assembly for Wales|Wales]] are not sovereign bodies and could be abolished by the UK parliament despite being established following public approval as expressed in [[Referendum|referenda]].
[[Image:Westminster palace.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]]]
The position of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], the UK's [[head of government]], belongs to the Member of Parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in the House of Commons, usually the current leader of the largest political party in that chamber. The Prime Minister and Cabinet are formally appointed by the Monarch to form [[Her Majesty's Government]]. Though the Prime Minister chooses the Cabinet, and by convention HM The Queen respects the Prime Minister's choices. The [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] is traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister's party in both legislative houses, and mostly from the House of Commons, to which [[Responsible government|they are responsible]]. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, all of whom are sworn into [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council]], and become [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]]. ''The Rt Hon'' [[Gordon Brown]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]], leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], has been Prime Minister, [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Minister for the Civil Service]] since 27 June 2007.<ref name="npm">{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6245682.stm | title= Brown is UK's new prime minister | daymonth=27 June|year=2007 | accessdaymonth= 23 January|accessyear=2008| work= BBC News | publisher= [[BBC News|news.bbc.co.uk]] }}</ref>

For elections to the House of Commons, the UK is currently divided into [[United Kingdom constituencies|646 constituencies]], with 529 in England, 18 in Northern Ireland, [[Scottish Westminster constituencies from 2005|59 in Scotland]] and 40 in Wales,<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/westminster.asp Westminster Parliamentary Constituencies] statistics.gov.uk, accessed 10 October, 2008</ref> though this number will rise to 650 at the [[Next United Kingdom general election|next General Election]]. Each constituency elects one Member of Parliament by [[Plurality voting system|simple plurality]]. General Elections are called by the Monarch when the Prime Minister so advises. Though there is no minimum term for a Parliament, the [[Parliament Act 1911|Parliament Act (1911)]] requires that a new election must be called within five years of the previous general election.

The UK's three [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom#Major political parties in the United Kingdom|major political parties]] are the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and the [[Liberal Democrats]], who won between them 616 out of the 646 seats available in the House of Commons at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]]. Most of the remaining seats were won by parties that only contest elections in one part of the UK such as the [[Scottish National Party]] (Scotland only), [[Plaid Cymru]] (Wales only), and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], [[Ulster Unionist Party]], and [[Sinn Féin]] (Northern Ireland only, though Sinn Féin also contests elections in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]). In accordance with party policy, no elected Sinn Féin Member of Parliament has ever attended the House of Commons to speak in the House on behalf of their constituents as Members of Parliament are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Monarch.<ref>However, the current five Sinn Féin MPs have since 2002 made use of the offices and other facilities available at Westminster.{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1771635.stm |title=Sinn Fein moves into Westminster|publisher=BBC|date=21 January, 2002|accessdaymonth=17 October|accessyear=2008}}</ref>

The [[history of local government in the United Kingdom]] is marked by little change in the arrangements that preceded the Union until the 19th century, after which there has been a constant evolution of role and function.<ref name=barlow>Barlow, I., ''Metropolitan Government'', (1991)</ref> Change did not occur in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales in a uniform manner and the devolution of power over local government to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland means that future changes are unlikely to be uniform either.

The organisation of [[local government in England]] is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to the local arrangements. Legislation concerning local government in [[England]] is decided by the UK parliament and the [[Her Majesty's Government|government of the United Kingdom]], because England does not have a devolved parliament. The upper-tier [[subdivisions of England]] are the nine [[Regions of England|Government office regions]] or European Union government office regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gos.gov.uk/national/|publisher=gos.gov.uk|accessdaymonth=31 July|accessyear=2008|title=Welcome to the national site of the Government Office Network}}</ref> One region, [[Greater London Authority|Greater London]], has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a [[Greater London Authority referendum, 1998|referendum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/history.jsp|title=A short history of London government|publisher=www.london.gov.uk|accessdaymonth=4 October|accessyear=2008}}</ref> It was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assemblies]] but a rejection by a [[Northern England devolution referendums, 2004|referendum in 2004]] of a proposed assembly in the [[North East England|North East]] region stopped this idea in its tracks.<ref>"The Government is now expected to tear up its twelve-year-old plan to create eight or nine regional assemblies in England to mirror devolution in Scotland and Wales."{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article503255.ece|title=Prescott's dream in tatters as North East rejects assembly|accessdaymonth=15 February|accessyear=2008|publisher=The Times}}</ref> Below the region level, London consists of 32 [[London borough]]s and the rest of England has either [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|county councils]] and district councils or [[unitary authorities]].

[[Local government in Scotland]] is divided on a basis of [[subdivisions of Scotland|32 council areas]] with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of [[Glasgow]], Edinburgh, [[Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee]] are separate council areas as also is [[Politics of the Highland council area|Highland Council]] which includes a third of Scotland's area but just over 200,000&nbsp;people.

Elections are conducted by [[single transferable vote]] in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors.

=== England, Wales and Northern Ireland ===
{{main|English law|Northern Ireland law}}
Both [[English law]], which applies in [[England and Wales]], and [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland law]] are based on [[common law|common-law]] principles. The essence of common-law is that law is made by [[judge]]s sitting in [[court]]s, applying their common sense and knowledge of [[precedent]] (''[[stare decisis]]'') to the facts before them. The [[Courts of England and Wales]] are headed by the Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] (for civil cases) and the [[Crown Court]] (for criminal cases). The Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] (usually just referred to, as "The House of Lords") is presently the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil cases in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]] and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the hierarchy.

Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995 though, since that peak, there has been an overall fall of 48% in crime from 1995 to 2007/8.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7511192.stm |title=Police-recorded crime down by 9% |publisher=BBC News |date=17 July 2008|accessdaymonth=21 October|accessyear=2008}}</ref> Despite the fall in crime rates, the [[prison population of England and Wales]] has almost doubled over the same period, to over 80,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7235438.stm|title=New record high prison population|publisher=BBC News|date=8 February 2008|accessdaymonth=21 October|accessyear=2008}}</ref> [[Her Majesty's Prison Service]], which reports to the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], manages most of the [[prison]]s within England and Wales.

{{main|Geography of the United Kingdom|Climate of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:uk topo en.jpg|thumb|UK's topography]]
The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately {{convert|245000|km2|sqmi|-1}} comprising of the island of Great Britain, the northeastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland) and smaller islands.<ref name=factbook/> It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, coming within {{convert|35|km|mi|0}} of the northwest coast of France, from which it is separated by the [[English Channel]].<ref name=factbook/> Great Britain lies between latitudes 49° and 59° N (the Shetland Islands reach to nearly 61° N), and longitudes 8° W to 2° E. The Royal Greenwich Observatory, near London, is the defining point of the [[Prime Meridian]]. When measured directly north-south, Great Britain is a little over {{convert|1100|km|mi|-2}} in length and is a fraction under {{convert|500|km|mi|-2}} at its widest, but the greatest distance between two points is {{convert|1350|km|mi|-1}} between [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]] (near [[Penzance]]) and [[John o' Groats]] in [[Caithness]] (near [[Thurso]]). Northern Ireland shares a {{convert|360|km|mi|0|adj=on}} land boundary with the [[Republic of Ireland]].<ref name=factbook/>

The United Kingdom has a temperate [[climate]], with plentiful rainfall all year round.<ref name=factbook/> The temperature varies with the seasons but seldom drops below {{convert|-10|C|lk=on}} or rises above {{convert|35|C}}. The prevailing wind is from the southwest, bearing frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=factbook/> Eastern parts are most sheltered from this wind and are therefore the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]], bring mild winters, especially in the west, where winters are wet, especially over high ground. Summers are warmest in the south east of England, being closest to the European mainland, and coolest in the north. Snowfall can occur in winter and early spring, though it rarely settles to great depth away from high ground.

[[Geography of England|England]] accounts for just over half of the total area of the UK, covering {{convert|130410|km2|sqmi|-1}}. Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, with mountainous terrain north-west of the [[Tees-Exe line]] including the [[Lake District|Cumbrian Mountains]] of the Lake District, the [[Pennines]] and [[limestone]] hills of the [[Peak District]], [[Exmoor]] and [[Dartmoor]]. Lower ranges include the [[limestone]] hills of the [[Isle of Purbeck]], [[Cotswolds]] and [[Lincolnshire Wolds]], and the [[chalk]] downs of the [[Southern England Chalk Formation]]. The main rivers and estuaries are the [[River Thames|Thames]], [[River Severn|Severn]] and the [[Humber]]. England's highest mountain is [[Scafell Pike]], which is in the [[Lake District]] {{convert|978|m|ft|0}}. England has a number of large towns and cities and, in terms of [[Larger Urban Zones]], has six of the top 50 Zones in the European Union.

[[Geography of Scotland|Scotland]] accounts for about a third of the total area of the UK, covering {{convert|78772|km2|sqmi|-1}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.org/about/fact-file/index.html |title=Scotland Facts |publisher=www.scotland.org |accessedaymonth=16 July|accessyear=2008}}</ref> including nearly eight hundred [[List of islands of Scotland|islands]], mainly west and north of the mainland, notably the [[Hebrides]], [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland|Shetland Islands]]. The topography of Scotland is distinguished by the [[Highland Boundary Fault]]{{ndash}} a [[Fault (geology)|geological rock fracture]]{{ndash}} which traverses the Scottish mainland from [[Helensburgh]] to [[Stonehaven]]. The faultline separates two distinctively different regions; namely the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] to the north and west and the [[Scottish Lowlands|lowlands]] to the south and east. The more rugged Highland region contains the majority of Scotland's mountainous terrain, including [[Ben Nevis]], which at {{convert|1343|m|ft|0}} is the highest point in the [[British Isles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bennevisweather.co.uk/index.asp |title=Ben Nevis Weather |publisher=www.bennevisweather.co.uk |accessedaymonth=26 October|accessyear=2008}}</ref> Lowland areas, especially the narrow waist of land between the [[Firth of Clyde]] and the [[Firth of Forth]] known as the [[Central Lowlands|Central Belt]], are flatter and home to most of the population including [[Glasgow]], Scotland's largest city, and [[Edinburgh]], the capital and political centre of the country.

[[Geography of Wales|Wales]] accounts for less than a tenth of the total area of the UK, covering {{convert|20758|km2|sqmi|-1}}. Wales is mostly mountainous, though [[South Wales|south Wales]] is less mountainous than [[North Wales|north]] and [[Mid Wales|mid Wales]]. The main population and industrial areas are in south Wales, consisting of the coastal cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport and the [[South Wales Valleys]] to their north. The highest mountains in Wales are in [[Snowdonia]], and include [[Snowdon]] ({{lang-cy|Yr Wyddfa}}), which, at 1,085&nbsp;m (3,560&nbsp;ft) is the highest peak in Wales. The 14 (or possibly 15) Welsh mountains over 3,000&nbsp;feet (914&nbsp;m) high are known collectively as the [[Welsh 3000s]]. Wales has over 1,200&nbsp;km (750&nbsp;miles) of coastline. There are several [[island]]s off the Welsh mainland, the largest of which is [[Anglesey]] (''Ynys Môn'') in the northwest.

[[Geography of Ireland|Northern Ireland]] accounts for just {{convert|14160|km2|sqmi|-1}} and is mostly hilly. It includes [[Lough Neagh]], at {{convert|388|km2|sqmi|0}}, the largest body of water in the UK and [[Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/geog.htm |title=Geography of Northern Ireland |publisher=University of Ulster |accessdaymonth=22 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The highest peak is [[Slieve Donard]] at {{convert|849|m|ft|0}} in the province's [[Mourne Mountains]].

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom and the countries that preceded it have long traditions of [[Christianity]] and a link between [[Separation of church and state|church and state]] still remains. Research suggests that 38% of the population have a belief in a [[God]] with a further 40% believing in a 'spirit or life force'.<ref name=Eurobarometer>{{PDFlink|[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf Eurobarometer poll conducted in 2005]|1.64&nbsp;MB}}.

==== Christianity ====
[[Image:Westminster abbey west.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Westminster Abbey]] is used for the [[coronation]] of [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarchs]], when they are also made the head of the [[Church of England]].]]

The [[Church of England]], which split from [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]] in 1534 (see [[English Reformation]]) is, today, the '[[Established church|established']] Church in England: the church retains a [[Lords Spiritual|representation]] in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] is a member of the Church (required under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]]) as well as its [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]]. Though the direct influence of the [[Church of England]] has been on the decline for years, it retains the right to draft legislative measures (related to religious administration), through the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]], that can then be passed into law by Parliament.

The [[Church of Scotland]] (known informally as the [[Kirk]]), which broke with Rome in 1560 (see [[Calvinism]] and [[Scottish Reformation]]) is a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, recognised as the [[national church]] of Scotland, and not subject to state control. The British monarch is an ordinary member, and is required to swear an oath to "defend the security" of the Church at the coronation. The [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], which is now part of the Anglican Communion, dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690, when it split from the Church of Scotland, and is not a 'daughter church' of the Church of England. Further splits in the Church of Scotland, especially in the nineteenth century, led to the creation of various other Presbyterian churches in Scotland, including the [[Free Church of Scotland (post-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].

In the 1920s, the [[Church in Wales]] was separated from the Church of England and became '[[Disestablishmentarianism|disestablished']]. The Church in Wales remains in the [[Anglican Communion]]. [[Methodism]] and other independent churches are traditionally strong in Wales.

The Anglican [[Church of Ireland]] was disestablished in the nineteenth century. It covers the entire island of [[Ireland]] (both [[Northern Ireland]] and the state of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]). In Northern Ireland, [[Protestantism|Protestants]] are in the majority overall.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=980 Communities in Northern Ireland] statistics.gov.uk, accessed 29 October 2008</ref> though the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Roman Catholic Church of Ireland]] is the largest single denomination. The [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]], closely linked to the Church of Scotland in terms of theology and history, is the largest Protestant denomination. 

The [[Roman Catholicism in the United Kingdom|Roman Catholic Church]] is the second largest denomination of Christianity in the UK. After the [[Protestant Reformation]], strict laws were passed against Catholics; these were removed by the [[Catholic Emancipation]] laws in 1829. There are separate Catholic hierarchies for [[Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Ireland]].

Other large Christian groups include [[Methodism|Methodists]], founded by [[John Wesley]] in London and [[Baptist]]s. There are also growing [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches, many of which have flourished with [[Immigration to the United Kingdom (1922-present day)|immigration]] from around the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and beyond. Pentecostal churches are now third after the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in terms of church attendance.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article757934.ece 'Fringe' Church winning the believers] Timesonline, 19 December 2006</ref>

The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in the United Kingdom with an initial concentration on heavy industries such as [[shipbuilding]], [[coal mining]], [[steel]] production, and [[textile]]s. The empire created an overseas market for British products, allowing the UK to dominate international trade in the 19th century. However, as other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. Manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy, but accounted for only one-sixth of national output in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/ministers/speeches/hewitt150704b.html |title=TUC Manufacturing Conference |author=Patricia Hewitt |publisher=Department for Trade and Industry |date=2004-07-15 |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> The [[British motor industry]] is a significant part of this sector, although it has diminished with the collapse of the [[MG Rover Group]] and most of the industry is foreign owned. Civil and defence aircraft production is led by the United Kingdom's largest aerospace firm, [[BAE Systems]], and the continental European firm [[EADS]], the owner of [[Airbus]]. [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] holds a major share of the global aerospace engines market. The chemical and pharmaceutical industry is strong in the UK, with the world's second and sixth largest pharmaceutical firms ([[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[AstraZeneca]], respectively)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/sectors/biotech/pharmaceutical/page10219.html |title=The Pharmaceutical sector in the UK |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=Department of Trade and Industry}}</ref> being based in the UK.

[[Education in the United Kingdom]] is a devolved matter with England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales having separate systems.

[[Education in England]] is the responsibility of the [[Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]] and the [[Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills]], though the day to day administration and funding of state schools is the responsibility of [[Local Education Authority|Local Education Authorities]]. Universal state education in England and Wales was introduced for primary level in 1870 and secondary level in 1900.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.humana.org/Article.asp?TxtID=223&SubMenuItemID=183&MenuItemID=43 |title=United Kingdom |publisher=Humana |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> Education is mandatory from ages five to sixteen (15 if born in late July or August). The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, only a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. Despite a fall in actual numbers, the proportion of children in England attending [[private school]]s has risen to over 7%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2007/nov/09/schools.uk |title=Private school pupil numbers in decline] |publisher=Guardian |date=2007-11-09}}</ref> Just over half of students at the leading universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] had attended state schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6905288.stm |title=More state pupils in universities |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-07-19}}</ref> State schools which are allowed to select pupils according to intelligence and academic ability can achieve comparable results to the most selective private schools: out of the top ten performing schools in terms of GCSE results in 2006 two were state-run [[grammar school]]s.

[[Education in Scotland]] is the responsibility of the [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning]], with day to day administration and funding of state schools the responsibility of Local Authorities. Two [[Scottish public bodies|non-departmental public bodies]] have key roles in Scottish education: the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] is responsible for the development, accreditation, assessment and certification of qualifications other than degrees which are delivered at secondary schools, [[Tertiary education|post-secondary]] colleges of [[further education]] and other centres;<ref>[http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/5656.html About SQA] sqa.org.uk, accessed 7 October, 2008</ref> and [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]] provides advice, resources and staff development to the education community to promote curriculum development and create a culture of innovation, ambition and excellence.<ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/aboutlts/index.asp About Learning and Teaching Scotland] ltscotland.org.uk, accessed 7 October, 2008</ref> Scotland first legislated for compulsory education in 1496.<ref>[http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/education/e_brain_drain.html Brain drain in reverse] scotland.org, accessed 7 October, 2008</ref> The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4%, although it has been rising slowly in recent years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6563167.stm |title=Increase in private school intake |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-17}}</ref> Scottish students who attend Scottish universities pay neither tuition fees nor graduate endowment charges as the fees were abolished in 2001 and the graduate endowment scheme was abolished in 2008.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7268101.stm MSPs vote to scrap endowment fee] BBC News, 28 February 2008</ref>

[[Education in Northern Ireland]] is the responsibility of the [[Minister for Education (Northern Ireland)|Minister for Education]], currently [[Caitríona Ruane]] ([[Sinn Féin]]),<ref name="northernireland1"/> although responsibility at a local level is administered by five Education and Library Boards, covering different geographical areas.

The [[National Assembly for Wales]] has responsibility for [[education in Wales]]. A significant number of Welsh students are taught either wholly or largely in the [[Welsh language]]; lessons in Welsh are compulsory for all until the age of 16. There are plans to increase the provision of Welsh Medium schools as part of the policy of having a fully bi-lingual Wales.

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] ranked the UK 14th in science, which was higher than the OECD average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf|title=Range of rank on the PISA 2006 science scale}}</ref>

[[Healthcare in the United Kingdom]] is a [[devolution|devolved matter]] and England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have separate systems with different policies and priorities<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7586147.stm 'Huge contrasts' in devolved NHS] BBC News, 28 August 2008 </ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems] [[BBC]] 2 January 2008</ref> though the degree of co-operation usually conceals the difference from cross-border users of the services. The four systems provide [[publicly-funded health care|public healthcare]] to all [[British nationality law|UK permanent residents]] that is free at the point of need and paid for from [[taxation in the United Kingdom|general taxation]]. A much smaller private medical system also exists. Various regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the [[General Medical Council]], the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] and non-governmental-based (e.g. [[Royal College]]s). Across the UK, there is a large number of [[medical school]]s and [[dentistry|dental schools]], and a considerable establishment for training [[nurse]]s and professions allied to medicine.

[[Healthcare in England]] is mainly provided by the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] which today covers just England though originally it covered England and Wales. It was set up by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] that came into effect on 5 July 1948. The [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] exists to improve the health and wellbeing of people in England,<ref>[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Aboutus/index.htm About the Department of Health] dh.gov.uk, accessed 5 October, 2008</ref> and the [[Secretary of State for Health]] is answerable to the UK Parliament for the its work and for the work of the NHS. England's NHS is one of the largest cohesive organisations of any type in the world employing over 1.3&nbsp;million people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6450303.stm |title=NHS workforce 'falls by 11,000' |publisher=BBC News, |date=2007-03-14}}</ref> Public sector healthcare delivery consists of primary ([[General practitioner|general practice]]), secondary ([[hospital|district general hospital]]) and tertiary ([[teaching hospital]]) levels of service. There is considerable interaction and cross-flow between the various levels. The [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]], or NICE, advises on whether drugs or treatments should be provided by the NHS in England and Wales.

[[Healthcare in Scotland]] is mainly provided by [[NHS Scotland]], Scotland's public healthcare system. The service was founded by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947 (later repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) that took effect on 5 July 1948 to coincide with the launch of the NHS in England and Wales. However, even prior to 1948, half of Scotland's landmass was already covered by state funded healthcare, provided by the [[Highlands and Islands Medical Service]].<ref>[http://www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk/history/birth-of-nhs-scotland/highlands-and-islands-medical-service.html Highlands and Islands Medical Service (HIMS)] www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk, accessed 28 July 2008</ref> In 2006, NHS Scotland employed around 158,000 staff including more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. In addition, there were also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS in return for fees and allowances.<ref>[http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/introduction.aspx About the NHS in Scotland] NHS Scotland</ref> The [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing]] is responsible to the Scottish Parliament for the work of NHS Scotland.

[[NHS Wales|Healthcare in Wales]] is mainly provided by [[NHS Wales]]. Originally formed as part of the same NHS structure created by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]], power over the NHS in Wales was transferred to the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969.<ref>[http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?pid=11595&orgid=452 Introduction to NHS Wales 1960s] www.wales.nhs.uk </ref> In turn, responsibility for NHS Wales was passed to the Welsh Assembly and Executive under devolution in 1999.

There are a further {{convert|213750|km|mi|0}} of paved roads. The [[Network Rail|rail network]] of 16,116&nbsp;km (10,072&nbsp;miles) in Great Britain and 303&nbsp;route&nbsp;km (189 route&nbsp;mi) in [[Northern Ireland]] carries over 18,000 passenger trains and 1,000 freight trains daily. Urban rail networks are well developed in London and other cities. There was once over 48,000 route&nbsp;km (30,000 route&nbsp;mi) of rail network in the UK, however most of this was reduced over a time period from 1955 to 1975, much of it after a report by a government advisor [[Richard Beeching]] in the mid 1960s (known as the [[Beeching Axe]]).

Major [[sport]]s including [[association football]], [[rugby football]], [[cricket]], [[tennis]] and [[golf]] originated in the United Kingdom. A 2006 poll found that football is the most popular [[sport in the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsospublicaffairs.co.uk/content/crowded-summer-of-sport.ashx |title=Crowded Summer Of Sport|publisher=Ipsos Mori|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref>

Internationally, [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]] compete separately in most team sports, as well as at the [[Commonwealth Games]], and in sporting contexts the four can be referred to collectively as the [[Home Nations]]. There are national sports teams representing the United Kingdom, including [[Great Britain national basketball team]] and [[Great Britain at the Olympics]].

Each of the [[Home Nations]] has their own Football Association, national team and [[league system]], though a few clubs play outside their country's respective systems for a variety of historical and logistical reasons. [[Association football|Football]] was developed in the UK and is comfortably the most popular sport.

[[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] compete as separate countries in international competition and, as a consequence, the UK does not compete as a single team in football events at the [[Olympic Games]]. There are [[United Kingdom national football team|proposals to have a UK team]] take part in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] but the [[Scottish Football Association|Scottish]], [[Football Association of Wales|Welsh]] and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Irish]] football associations have declined to participate, fearing that it would undermine their independent status - a fear confirmed by FIFA president Sepp Blatter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/football/7286011.stm|title=Blatter against British 2012 team|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-03-09|accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref> England has been the most successful of the home nations, winning the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] [[1966 FIFA World Cup|on home soil in 1966]], although there has historically been a close-fought [[England and Scotland football rivalry|rivalry between England and Scotland]].

The [[English football league system]] includes hundreds of inter-linked leagues, consisting of thousands of divisions. The [[Premier League|Premiership]] at the top, is the most-watched football league in the world<ref>[http://www.watch-football.net/articles/premier_league.html Premier and Champions League history] watch-football.net, accessed 1 October, 2008</ref> and is particularly popular in [[Asia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3207829.stm |title=Chinese phone maker's fancy footwork |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-10-27 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> Below this, [[The Football League]] has three divisions and then the [[Football Conference]] has a national division and two feeder regional leagues. Thereafter the structure becomes increasing regional. England is home to world-renowned football clubs such as [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. English teams have been successful in European Competitions including some who have become European Cup/UEFA Champions League winners: [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (five times), [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (three times), [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (twice) and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. More clubs from England have won the European Cup than any other country (four compared to three from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands). Moreover, England ranks second in the all time list of European club trophies won with 35, one behind Italy's 36. The European Cup competition itself came about as the result of the success of another English club, [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], against top European sides<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071001212711/http://galeb.etf.bg.ac.yu/~mirad/archive.html|title=Archive}}</ref> in the 1950s. The 90,000-capacity [[Wembley Stadium]] is England's principal sporting stadium.

The [[Scottish football league system]] has two national leagues: the [[Scottish Premier League]], the top division of play, and the [[Scottish Football League]], which has three divisions. Below this, but not connected to the national leagues, are three regional leagues; the [[Highland Football League]], the [[East of Scotland Football League]] and the [[South of Scotland Football League]]. One English club, [[Berwick Rangers F.C.|Berwick Rangers]], plays in the Scottish system. Scotland is home to two world-renowned football clubs in the [[Old Firm]] of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Scottish teams that have been successful in European Competitions include [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] ([[European Cup 1966–67|European Cup in 1967]]), [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] ([[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1971–72|European Cup Winners' Cup in 1972]]) and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] ([[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1982–83|European Cup Winners' Cup]] and [[1983 UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup in 1983]]). Celtic were the first British club to win the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]].

The [[Welsh football league system]] includes the [[Welsh Premier League]] and regional leagues. Welsh Premiership club [[The New Saints F.C.|The New Saints]] play their home matches on the English side of the border in [[Oswestry]]. The Welsh clubs of [[Cardiff City F.C.]], [[Colwyn Bay F.C.]], [[Merthyr Tydfil F.C.]], [[Newport County A.F.C.]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.]] and [[Wrexham F.C.]] play in the English system. Cardiff's 76,250 seater [[Millennium Stadium]] is the principal sporting stadium of Wales.

The [[Northern Ireland football league system]] includes the [[IFA Premiership]]. One Northern Irish club, [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]], play their football outside of the UK in the [[FAI League of Ireland|Republic of Ireland football league system]].

Team members are drawn from the main county sides, and include both English and Welsh players. Cricket is distinct from Football and Rugby where Wales and England field separate national teams. [[Sport in Ireland|Irish]] and [[Cricket in Scotland|Scottish]] players have played for England because neither [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]] nor [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] have Test status and have only recently started to play in [[One Day International]]s. Scotland, England (and Wales), and Ireland (including Northern Ireland) have competed at the [[Cricket World Cup]], with England reaching the Final three times. There is a professional [[County Championship|league championship]] in which clubs representing 17 English counties and 1 Welsh county compete.

[[Snooker]] is also one of Great Britain's sporting exports. A game similar to [[cue sports|billiards]], the world championships are held annually in [[Sheffield]]. The sport continues to expand worldwide, with huge growth in China.

The game of [[tennis]] first originated from the City of [[Birmingham]] between 1859 and 1865. [[The Championships, Wimbledon]] are international [[tennis]] events held in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] in south London every summer and are regarded as the most prestigious event of the global tennis calendar.

[[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred racing]] is popular throughout the UK. It originated under [[Charles II of England]] as the "Sport of Kings" and is a royal pastime to this day. World-famous horse races include the [[Grand National]], the [[Epsom Derby]] and [[Ascot Racecourse#Royal Ascot|Royal Ascot]]. The town of [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] is considered the centre of English racing, largely due to the famous [[Newmarket Racecourse]].

The UK has proved successful in the international sporting arena in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. It is widely considered that the sport's most successful rower is [[Steve Redgrave]] who won five gold medals and one bronze medal at five consecutive [[Olympic Games]], as well as numerous wins at the [[World Rowing Championships]] and [[Henley Royal Regatta]].

The UK is closely associated with [[motorsport]]. Many teams and drivers in [[Formula One]] (F1) are based in the UK and drivers from Britain have won more world titles than any other country. The country hosts legs of the F1 and [[World Rally Championship]] and has its own [[touring car racing]] championship, the [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC). The [[British Grand Prix]] takes place at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] each July.

[[Dancesport]] or competitive Ballroom dancing has its origins in the UK when popular dancing at the time was codified by British dance schools from the 1920s onwards. For example, the Slow Waltz is still known as the English Waltz which is now as distinct from its original roots as its name, the Viennese Waltz. The UK remains a major centre for the sport and Ballroom dancing in general with the Empress Ballroom at the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool|Winter Gardens]] in [[Blackpool]] being a popular venue for major competitions.

== Culture ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=July 2008}}
{{main|Culture of the United Kingdom}}
The [[culture of the United Kingdom]]&mdash;British culture&mdash;is informed by the [[History of the United Kingdom|UK's history]] as a [[Developed country|developed]] [[island country]], [[monarchy]], [[Imperialism|imperial power]] and, particularly, as a [[political union]] of four countries, which each have their own preserved and distinctive heritage, customs and symbolism. As a result of the [[British Empire]], British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies such as [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[India]], and the [[United States]].

{{main|Cinema of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom has been influential in the development of cinema, with the [[Ealing Studios]] claiming to be the oldest studios in the world. Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry is characterised by an ongoing debate about its identity, and the influences of American and European cinema. Particularly between British and American film, many films are often co-produced or share actors with many British actors now featuring regularly in Hollywood films. The [[BFI Top 100 British films]] is a poll conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] which ranks what they consider to be the 100 greatest British films of all time.

'British literature' refers to [[literature]] associated with the United Kingdom, the [[Isle of Man]] and the Channel Islands as well as to literature from England, Wales and Scotland prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. Most British literature is in the [[English language]].

The English playwright and poet [[William Shakespeare]] is widely regarded as the greatest dramatist of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/537853/William-Shakespeare |title=Encyclopedia Britannica article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562101/Shakespeare.html |title=MSN Encarta Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Shakespeare%2c+William |title=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref> Among the earliest English writers are [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] (12th century), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (14th century), and [[Thomas Malory]] (15th century). In the 18th century, [[Samuel Richardson]] is often credited with inventing the modern novel. In the 19th century, there followed further innovation by [[Jane Austen]], the [[Brontë|Brontë sisters]], the social campaigner [[Charles Dickens]], the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] [[Thomas Hardy]], the visionary poet [[William Blake]] and romantic poet [[William Wordsworth]]. Twentieth century writers include the science fiction novelist [[H. G. Wells]], the controversial [[D. H. Lawrence]], the [[modernism|modernist]] [[Virginia Woolf]], the prophetic novelist [[George Orwell]] and the poet [[John Betjeman]]. Most recently, the children's fantasy [[Harry Potter]] series by [[J. K. Rowling]] has recalled the popularity of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

[[Scottish literature|Scotland's contribution]] includes the detective writer [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], romantic literature by Sir [[Walter Scott]] and the epic adventures of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. It has also produced the celebrated poet [[Robert Burns]], as well as [[William McGonagall]], regarded by many as one of the world's worst.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/31/AR2007073101696.html How to Celebrate 'The World's Worst Poet'?] washingtonpost.com, 1 August, 2007</ref> More recently, the modernist and nationalist [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] and [[Neil M. Gunn]] contributed to the [[Scottish Renaissance]]. A more grim outlook is found in [[Ian Rankin]]'s stories and the psychological horror-comedy of [[Iain Banks]]. Scotland's capital, Edinburgh, is UNESCO's first worldwide city of literature.<ref>[http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=27852&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html Edinburgh, UK appointed first UNESCO City of Literature] unesco.org, accessed 20 August 2008</ref>

In the early medieval period, Welsh writers composed the [[Mabinogion]]. In modern times, the poets [[R. S. Thomas]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] have brought Welsh culture to an international audience.

Authors from other nationalities, particularly from Ireland, or from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, have lived and worked in the UK. Significant examples through the centuries include [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]], and more recently British authors born abroad such as [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] and Sir [[Salman Rushdie]].

In theatre, Shakespeare's contemporaries [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]] added depth. More recently [[Alan Ayckbourn]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Michael Frayn]], [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] have combined elements of surrealism, realism and radicalism.

=== Media ===
{{main|Media in the United Kingdom}}
The prominence of the English language gives the UK media a widespread international dimension.

==== Broadcasting ====
{{main|Television in the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:BBC Television Centre.JPG|thumb|[[BBC Television Centre]]. The BBC is the largest and oldest broadcaster in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC website: ''About the BBC - What is the BBC'' |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/purpose/what.shtml |accessdate=2008-06-14}}</ref> ]]
[[Image:Channel 4 Building - Horseferry Road - London - 310504.jpg|thumb|The Channel 4 building.]]

There are five major nationwide television channels in the UK: [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Five (channel)|Five]] - currently transmitted by analogue terrestrial, free-to-air signals with the latter three channels funded by commercial advertising. In Wales, [[S4C]] the Welsh Fourth Channel replaces Channel 4, carrying Welsh language programmes at peak times. It also transmits Channel 4 programmes at other times.

The [[BBC]] is the UK's publicly funded [[radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world. It operates several [[BBC Television|television channels]] and [[BBC Radio|radio]] stations in both the UK and abroad. The BBC's international television news service, [[BBC World News]], is broadcast throughout the world and the [[BBC World Service]] radio network is broadcast in thirty-three languages globally, as well as services in Welsh on [[BBC Radio Cymru]] and programmes in Gaelic on [[BBC Radio nan Gàidheal]] in Scotland and Irish in Northern Ireland.

The domestic services of the BBC are funded by the [[television licence]], a legal requirement for any British household with a television receiver that is in use to receive broadcasts, regardless of whether or not the householders watch BBC channels. Households which are the principal residence of any person over 75 are exempt<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/information/agedover74s.jsp|title=TV licensing: aged over 74}}</ref> and the requirement does not extend to radio listeners. The BBC World Service Radio is funded by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] and the television stations are operated by [[BBC Worldwide]] on a commercial subscription basis over cable and satellite services. It is this commercial arm of the BBC that forms half of [[UKTV]] along with [[Virgin Media]].

The UK now has a large number of digital terrestrial channels including a further six from the BBC, five from ITV and three from Channel 4, and one from S4C which is solely in Welsh, among a variety of others.

The vast majority of digital [[cable television]] services are provided by [[Virgin Media]] with [[satellite television]] available from [[Freesat]] or [[British Sky Broadcasting]] and [[free-to-air]] digital terrestrial television by [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]. The entire country [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom#Digital switchover|will switch to digital]] by 2012.

[[Radio in the United Kingdom|Radio in the UK]] is dominated by [[BBC Radio]], which operates ten national networks and over forty local radio stations. The most popular radio station, by number of listeners, is [[BBC Radio 2]], closely followed by [[BBC Radio 1]]. There are hundreds of mainly local commercial radio stations across the country offering a variety of music or talk formats.

Traditionally, [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British newspapers]] could be split into ''quality'', serious-minded newspaper (usually referred to as "[[broadsheet]]s" due to their large size) and the more populist, ''[[tabloid]]'' varieties. For convenience of reading, many traditional broadsheets have switched to a more [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]]-sized format, traditionally used by [[tabloid]]s. ''[[The Sun]]'' has the highest circulation of any daily newspaper in the UK: 3.1 million, approximately a quarter of the market.<ref name=paper>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/table/2008/oct/10/abcs-pressandpublishing|title=ABCs: National daily newspaper circulation September 2008|publisher=Audit Bureau of Circulations|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> Its sister paper, the ''[[News of the World]]'' has the highest circulation in the Sunday newspaper market, and traditionally focuses on celebrity-led stories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/table/2008/oct/10/abcs-pressandpublishing1|title=ABCs: National Sunday newspaper circulation September 2008 |publisher=Audit Bureau of Circulations |date=2008-10-10|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', a [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] broadsheet paper, is the highest-selling of the "quality" newspapers.<ref name=paper/> ''[[The Guardian]]'' is a more [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|liberal]] "quality" broadsheet and the ''[[Financial Times]]'' is the main business newspaper, printed on distinctive salmon-pink broadsheet paper.

First printed in 1737, ''[[The News Letter]]'' from Belfast, is the oldest known English-language daily newspaper still in publication today. One of its fellow Northern Irish competitors, ''[[The Irish News]]'', has been twice ranked as the best regional newspaper in the United Kingdom, in 2006 and 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newspaperawards.co.uk/default.htm |title=The Newspaper Awards |accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>

Aside from newspapers, British magazines and journals have achieved worldwide circulation including ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.

Scotland has a distinct tradition of newspaper readership (see [[list of newspapers in Scotland]]). The tabloid ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' has the highest circulation of any daily newspaper outselling the ''[[The Sun#The Scottish Sun|Scottish Sun]]'' by four to one while its sister paper, the ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' similarly leads the Sunday newspaper market. The leading "quality" daily newspaper in Scotland is ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', though it is the sister paper of ''[[The Scotsman]]'', the ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', that leads in the Sunday newspaper market.<ref>[http://www.business7.co.uk/business-news/breaking-business-news/2008/02/11/scottish-newspaper-readership-falls-97298-20316075/ Scottish newspaper readership falls] Business7, 11 February 2008</ref>

=== Music ===
{{main|Music of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:The Fabs.JPG|thumb|[[The Beatles]] are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the [[history of music]], selling over a billion records internationally.<ref name="uktvrecording">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://uktv.co.uk/history/gallery/aid/601378/multipageid/5823 |title=In This Month: June |publisher=uktv |accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref>]]

Various styles of music are popular, from the indigenous [[Folk music of England|folk music of England]], Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, to [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]]. [[Glasgow]]'s contribution to the music scene was recognised in 2008 when it was named a United Nations City of Music, one of only three cities in the world to have this honour.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7570915.stm Glasgow gets city of music honour] bbc.co.uk, accessed 20 August 2008 </ref>

Prominent among the UK contributors to the development of [[rock music]] in the 1960s and 1970s were [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Status Quo]],<ref>[http://www.statusquo.co.uk/factsheet.htm Quo Facts] statusquo.co.uk, accessed 14 October 2008</ref> [[Slade]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2245820.stm Honorary award for glam rockers] BBC News, 9 September, 2002 </ref> [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Who]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and [[Black Sabbath]]. Heavy metal, [[hard rock]], [[punk rock]] and [[New Wave music|New Wave]] were among the variations that followed. In the early 1980s, UK bands from the [[New Romantic]] scene such as [[Duran Duran]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Spandau Ballet]], [[Soft Cell]] and [[Ultravox]] were prominent. In the 1990s, [[Britpop]] bands and [[electronica]] music attained international success. More recent pop acts, including [[The Smiths]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Coldplay]], and the [[Spice Girls]], have ensured the continuation of the UK's massive contribution to popular music.

Notable composers of Classical music from the United Kingdom and the countries that preceded it have included [[William Byrd]], [[Henry Purcell]], Sir [[Edward Elgar]], Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]] (most famous for working with librettist Sir [[W. S. Gilbert]]), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], and [[Benjamin Britten]], pioneer of modern British [[opera]].

=== Philosophy ===
The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of "British Empiricism", a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid. The most famous philosophers of this tradition are [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]]. Britain is notable for a theory of moral philosophy, Utilitarianism, first used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and later by [[John Stuart Mill]], in his short work ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]''. Other eminent philosophers from the UK and the countries that preceded it include [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Adam Smith]] and [[Alfred Ayer]]. Foreign-born philosophers who settled in the UK include [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

The [[flag of the United Kingdom]] is the [[Union Flag]]. It was created by the superimposition of the [[Flag of England]], the [[Flag of Scotland]] and [[Saint Patrick's Flag]] in 1801. Wales is not represented in the Union Flag as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. However, the possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7114248.stm|title=Welsh dragon call for Union flag|publisher=BBC|date=27 November 2007|accessdaymonth=17 October|accessyear==2008}}</ref> The [[national anthem]] of the United Kingdom is "[[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]]", with "King" replaced with "Queen" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a woman. The anthem's name remains "God Save the King".

[[Britannia]] is a [[national personification]] of the United Kingdom, originating from [[Roman Britain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html |title=Britannia on British Coins |publisher=Chard |accessdaymonth=25 June|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair, wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]] and white robes. She holds [[Poseidon]]'s three-pronged trident and a [[shield]], bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as riding the back of a lion. At and since the height of the British Empire, Britannia has often associated with maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]''. The [[lion]] symbol is depicted behind Britannia on the [[British fifty pence coin]] and one is shown crowned on the back of the [[British ten pence coin]]. It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the [[British Army]]. The [[bulldog]] is sometimes used as a symbol of the United Kingdom and has been associated with [[Winston Churchill]]'s defiance of Nazi Germany.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Steve|title=Picturing the Beast|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date=2001|pages=p.52|isbn=0252070305}}</ref>

There is no official National [[flag of Northern Ireland]] following the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]] or any unofficial flag universally supported in Northern Ireland. The use of various flags in Northern Ireland is contentious. However, the [[Ulster Banner]] is often used for sporting events.
