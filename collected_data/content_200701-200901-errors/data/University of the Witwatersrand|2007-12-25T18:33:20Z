The '''University of the Witwatersrand''' (pronounced ''vit-vaters-rant'', with flat vowels; see [[South African English]]) is a leading [[South Africa|South African]] [[university]] situated in [[Johannesburg]].  It is often referred to as "Wits" (pronounced ''vits'').

Due to the 1959 Extension of University Education Act the school was only allowed to register a small number of black students for most of the [[apartheid]] era, even though several notable black anti-apartheid leaders graduated from the university. It became desegregated again in the last few years of apartheid.
It is the home of the [[Witwatersrand University Press]], one of [[Africa]]'s leading academic publishers, and also the oldest and largest [[university press]] in Africa.

== History ==
[[Image:The Wits University Great Hall.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Great Hall is on East Campus and is where [[graduation|graduation ceremonies]] and other functions are held.]]
The school was founded in [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]] in [[1896]] as the "South African School of Mines".  Eight years later, in [[1904]] the school moved to [[Johannesburg]] and changed its name to the "Transvaal Technical Institute".  The school changed its name in [[1906]] to the "Transvaal University College" and in [[1910]], the school again changed its name to the "South African School of Mines and Technology".  Finally, in [[1922]], the school was granted full university status after incorporating the College as the "University of the Witwatersrand".  The area of Milner Park was identified as the location for the new university [[campus]], and construction began in the same year.  There were to be six faculties that offered degrees at the University: Arts, Science, Medicine, Engineering, Law, and Commerce.

The school experienced significant growth after its incorporation as a university, growing from a mere 6,275 students in [[1963]] to over 16,400 in [[1985]].  In [[1964]], the Medical Library of the Faculty of Medicine moved to Esselen Street, in the [[Hillbrow]] section of Johannesburg.  During the course of the [[1960s]], the university opened many new schools and buildings, and acquired a limestone cave renowned for its archaeological material located at [[Sterkfontein]]. The Graduate School of Business was established later in [[1968]] in [[Parktown]].  A farm next to Sterkfontein named [[Swartkrans]] rich in archaeological material was purchased in 1968, and excavation rights were obtained for archaeological and palaeontological purposes at Makapansgat, located in [[Limpopo province]].  The next year, the Ernest Oppenheimer Residence opened next to the Business school in Parktown, and later in the same year, clinical departments at the new Medical School opened.  In [[1976]], Lawson's Corner was renamed University Corner.  Senate House, the university's main administrative building, was occupied in [[1977]].  The university underwent a significant expansion programme in [[1984]], acquiring the [[Milner Park Showgrounds]] and renaming it the West Campus.  In [[1984]], the Chamber of Mines building opened.  A walkway "The Amic Deck" was constructed across the motorway bisecting the campus, linking the East and West Campuses.

== Campuses ==

The University has 5 academic campuses. The Main campus is divided, by the [[M1 (Johannesburg)|M1]] and Yale Road, into East and West Campuses. The East Campus specialises primarily with the Faculties of Science and Humanities, and the University [[Senate]] and administration. The West Campus houses the Commerce, Law, Management, [[Engineering and the Built Environment (Witwatersrand)|Engineering and the Built Environment]] Faculties. The Main Campus is home to 6 [[Dormitory|residences]], namely Sunnyside and Jubilee Halls (female residences), Men's Res (College and Dalrymple Houses), Barnato Halls, David Webster, West Campus Village and International House.

Off the Main Campus are three academic campuses, all in [[Parktown]]. The Wits Education Campus (WEC) specialises with Education which is a school within the Faculty of Humanities. WEC boasts three female residences, Girton, Medhurst and Reith Halls. East of WEC (across York Road), lies the Medical School which is the administration and academic centre for the Faculty of Health Sciences.

West of WEC (across Victoria Avenue), lies the Wits Business School. It is the leading and most acclaimed [[Business School]] in South Africa <ref>http://www.wbshost.co.za/content/view/222/127/</ref>. Within the Business School borders are the Ernest Oppenheimer Halls (male residence) and Parktown Village I.

There are centres that are not academic but residential and referred to by the University as campuses. These are Graduate Lodge, Campus Lodge, South Court and Braamfontein Centre; all next to the Main Campus in [[Braamfontein]]. Then Paktown Village II and Knockando Halls (a male residence) in Parktown, and Esselen Residence in [[Hillbrow]].
