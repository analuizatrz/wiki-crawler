'''Paramore''' ({{IPAEng|ˈpærəmɔər}}) (often stylyzed as '''paramore''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band that formed in [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]], [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], [[Tennessee]] in 2004 consisting of Hayley Williams ([[lead vocals]]/[[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]]), Josh Farro ([[lead guitar]]/[[backing vocals]]), Jeremy Davis ([[Bass Guitar|bass guitar]]), and Zac Farro ([[Drum kit|drums]]). The group released their debut album ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'' in 2005, and their second album ''[[Riot!]]'' in 2007, which was certified [[RIAA Certification|platinum]] in the US and gold in the UK and Ireland.

==History==
===Formation and ''All We Know Is Falling'' (2002–2005)===
In 2002, at the age of 13, vocalist Hayley Nichole Williams (born December 27, 1988) moved from her hometown [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]], [[Lauderdale County, Mississippi|Lauderdale County]], [[Mississippi]] to [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]], [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], [[Tennessee]] USA where she met brothers Josh and Zac Farro while attending private school.<ref name="AP 08">{{citation| last= Bayer| first= Jonah| title= Born for This| magazine= [[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]| year= 2008| month= February| issue= 235}}</ref><ref name="AMG">{{cite web| title= Biography| publisher= All Music| url= http://wc06.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0pfrxq8sldae~T1 | accessdate= 2007-08-16}}</ref> Shortly after arriving, she began taking vocal lessons with [[Brett Manning]].<ref name="siren">{{cite interview| subject= [[Hayley Williams]]| interviewer= David Walter| title= Youth Gone Wild| date= 2007-10-17| url= http://www.soundthesirens.com/articles/index.php?id=8,334,0,0,1,0| accessdate= 2007-10-14}}</ref> Prior to forming Paramore, however, Williams and bassist Jeremy Davis took part in a [[funk]] cover band called the Factory, while the Farro brothers had practiced together after school.<ref name="AP 08"/><ref name="funk">{{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| subject2= Josh Farro| interviewer= Joshua Martin| title= ASL's Exclusive Interview With Paramore| date= 2007-06-26| url= http://www.socialitelife.com/2007/06/26/asls_exclusive_interview_with_paramore.php| accessdate= 2007-10-12}}</ref> The other members of what was soon to be Paramore had been "edgy about the whole female thing" of having Williams as vocalist/tambourine/accordian, but, because they were really good friends, she started writing for them and it eventually worked out.<ref name="Euro"/> The band was officially formed by Josh Farro ([[lead guitar]]/[[backing vocals]]), Zac Farro ([[Drum kit|drums]]), Jeremy Davis ([[Bass Guitar|bass]]) and Hayley Williams ([[lead vocals]]) in 2004,<ref>{{cite web| title= History| publisher= paramore.net| url= http://www.paramore.net/about#band_history| accssdate= 2007-12-31}}</ref> with the later addition of Williams' neighbor<ref name="AP 08"/> Jason Bynum ([[Rhythm Guitar]]). They took the name Paramore, which is derived from the maiden name of one of the group's former bassists during the time in which they were "still playing in the garage"<ref>{{cite video| people= Paramore | title= Hello My Name is Paramore| medium= Website| publisher= paramore.net| url= http://www.paramore.net/video| accessdate= 2007-12-14}}</ref>; once the group learned the meaning of the homonym ''[[paramour]]'' ("secret lover"), they decided to adopt the name, using the ''Paramore'' spelling.<ref name="Euro">{{cite interview |subject=Josh Farro |subject2=Hayley Williams |subject3= Jeremy Davis| interviewer=cathyreay |title= Interview With Paramore |date=2007-07-14| url=http://www.europunk.net/interviews.php?id=173 |accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> The band's first song written together was "Conspiracy", which was later used on their debut album.

Over the following years, Paramore performed at venues outside the greater Nashville area, including the concert festivals [[Purple Door]] and [[Warped Tour]]. [[John Janick]], CEO and co-founder of the music label [[Fueled by Ramen]], got a hold of Paramore's demos and went to a [[Taste of Chaos]] performance in [[Orlando, Florida]] to see the band perform live. After a smaller private performance at a warehouse, the band was signed to the label in April 2005.<ref name="Trades">{{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| subject2=Josh Farro| interviewer= Tony Pascarella |title= Interview: Hayley Williams and Josh Farro of Paramore| date= 2005-08-08| url= http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=3440 | accessdate= 2007-08-16}}</ref>

Paramore traveled back to Orlando to record their debut album ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'', but, shortly after arriving, Davis opted to leave the band citing personal reasons. The remaining four members of Paramore continued with the album, writing "[[All We Know]]" about his departure, and later deciding to base ''All We Know Is Falling'' around the concept. The album artwork also reflected Paramore's grief as Williams explains, "The couch [on the cover of ''All We Know is Falling''] with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space."<ref name="Trades"/> Recording for ''All We Know is Falling'' had taken three weeks, and promotional material for the album had only featured the four of the remaining members. Before touring, the band added John Hembree ([[Bass Guitar|bass]]) to their line up to replace Davis.<ref>{{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| interviewer= Jason Schleweis| title= Paramore Interview| date= 2005-07-14| url= http://www.crushmediamagazine.com/paramoreinterview.html| accessdate= 2007-10-12}}</ref> During that summer, Paramore was featured on the Shira Girl Stage of the 2005 Warped Tour.<ref name="Trades"/> After being asked by the band, Davis returned to Paramore, after five months apart, as Hembree left.<ref>{{citation| title= Paramore Kerrang!

Paramore released "[[Pressure (Paramore song)|Pressure]]" as its first single, with a video directed by [[Shane Drake]], but the song had failed to place on the charts. The video featured the band performing in a warehouse, eventually getting sprayed with water sprinklers as the storyline of a conflicted couple occurs. "Pressure" is also featured on the soundtrack to the [[EA Games]] video game ''[[The Sims 2]]'' for the [[Playstation 2]] and [[Xbox]]. In July, "[[Emergency (song)|Emergency]]" was released as the second single, the video again reuniting the band with director Shane Drake and featuring Hunter Lamb, who replaced Bynum on guitar.<ref name="AMG"/> The video for "Emergency" showcased Paramore in another performance, this time fixing the members bloody and in worn costumes. The third single "All We Know", was released with limited airtime, and the video consisting of a collection of live performances and backstage footage.

===''Riot!'' (2007–2008)===
In January 2006, they were a part of the Winter Go West Tour where they played alongside Seattle bands [[Amber Pacific]] and [[The Lashes]], and in February, Williams' vocals were featured on "Keep Dreaming Upside Down" by [[October Fall]].<ref name="Oct Fall">{{cite web| title= October Fall - A Season in Hell| publisher= AbsolutePunk.net| url= http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=118240 | accessdate= 2007-08-18}}</ref> In the spring 2006, Paramore was an opening act on headlining tours for both [[Bayside (band)|Bayside]] and soon afterwards, [[The Rocket Summer]].

==Musical style and influences==
The majority of Paramore's recordings come from collaborations between lead vocalist Hayley Williams and lead guitarist Josh Farro&nbsp;— Farro first writes the music, afterwards taking it to Williams for a melody and lyrics, and from that point the song worked out between the two.<ref name="Trades"/> Once the foundation is laid out, the remaining band members help to work on sound and arrangement.

Joshua Martin had written after an interview with Williams, "The band isn't just a short pop-punk girl with red hair and a spunky attitude. Their music is like them, it's aged differently.
