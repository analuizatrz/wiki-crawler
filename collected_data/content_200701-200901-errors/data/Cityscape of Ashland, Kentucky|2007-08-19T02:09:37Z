The '''Kitchen Building''' was constructed in 1916 as an office building on the corner of 15th Street and Winchester Avenue. <ref name="PRESERVE_1978"/> The ''Second National Bank'', then known as the ''Ashland Day and Night Bank'' which was later renamed in 1922, occupied the first floor beginning in 1915 with other offices occupying the other levels.

In 1923, the '''Ashland Bank Building''' was constructed at the corner of Winchester Avenue and 16th Street. <ref name="HIS_ASHLAND_1954"/> The 11-story, 116 ft. (35 m.) <ref name="HIS_ASHLAND_1954"/> tall building was one of the city's tallest structures.

Constructed in 1926, the '''Camayo Arcade''' was considered the "finest in the south" by the ''Paintsville Hearald''. <ref name="PRESERVE_1978">{{ cite book | last=Chappell | first=Edward A. | title="A historic preservation plan for Ashland, Kentucky." | publisher=City of Ashland | date=April 1978 }}</ref> It is a four-story structure between Winchester Avenue and the alley, and two-stories between the alley and Carter Avenue. The arcade functioned with numerous shops on the first and second levels, and offices on the upper floors. The façade features a three-bay classical arch design and included bronze marquees at each entrance.

Completed on May 14, 1928 <ref name="HIS_ASHLAND_1954"/>, the 11-story brick '''Henry Clay Hotel''' features classical and renaissance details. <ref name="PRESERVE_1978"/> Two years later, a five-story <ref name="HIS_ASHLAND_1954">{{ cite book | title="A history of Ashland, Kentucky, 1786-1954." | publisher=Ashland Centennial Committee | date=1954 }}</ref> structure replaced the existing ''Kitchen Building'', featuring a Beux-Arts inspired classical façade. In 1932, the bank moved to the former ''Ashland Bank Building'' <ref name="PRESERVE_1978"/>; the building became home of the ''Stecklers Department Store''.

In 1949, [[Sears]] purchased the former ''Field Furniture Building'' and operated a major department store until 1991. <ref name="HIS_ASHLAND_2004">{{ cite book | title="A history of Ashland, Kentucky, 1854-2004." | publisher=Ashland Bicentennial Committee | date=2004 }}</ref>

On March 8, 1984, ground breaking took place for a new $8.3 million '''Quality Royale Hotel''' at the corner of Winchester Avenue and 15th Street. <ref name="CITYDIR_1985"/> Envisioned originally in 1980 as a hotel, retail and visitors center at 6th Street where the [[Ashland Town Center]] resides today, developers instead chose a downtown location. The ten-story, 160-room structure was completed in September 1985 and was renamed [[Clarion Hotels|Quality Inn]] upon opening. The hotel features 112,500 sq. ft. of conference space, a 180-seat restaurant, 100-seat lounge, three ballrooms/dining rooms, two seminar rooms, an indoor pool and sauna and a two-story atrium. <ref name="CITYDIR_1985"/> It is now known as the '''Ashland Plaza Hotel'''.

== Streetscape Improvements ==
[[Image:Ashland Kentucky Streetscape.jpg|right|thumb|A renovated streetscape, looking east along Winchester Avenue.]]
On November 11, 2004, Ashland's [[Main Street]] program revealed plans for a streetscape project in the central business district. <ref name="DI_111204">{{ cite news | last=Crace | first=Beth | title="Main Street lays out downtown revitalization plan" | publisher=[[The Independent (Ashland)]] | date=[[2004-11-04]] | accessdate=2006-12-31 | url=http://commentsengine.cnhi.zope.net/archives/dailyindependent/story_detail?story_id=23010 }}</ref> Billed as an economic development that would spur further revitalization of the downtown, the Kentucky's Main Street's initiative is to utilize state funds to restore business districts. The main focus in the plan is on Winchester Avenue which includes,
* Narrowing Winchester Avenue between 13th Street and 18th Street to two-lanes,
* Constructing new sidewalks and removing basements under city right-of-way,
* Burying utilities,
* Installing new traffic-signal mast-arms,
* Installing new period street lights,
* Retrofitting existing street lights with period street lamps,
* Planting new trees and vegetation in "pocket parks."

Tinted concrete was to be used at crosswalks, but this was changed to brick due to concerns about future maintenance concerns. <ref name="DI_050305">{{ cite news | last=Moses | first=Emily B. | title="Work begins on Streetscape plan" | publisher=[[The Independent (Ashland)]] | date=[[2005-05-03]] | accessdate=2006-12-30 | url=http://commentsengine.cnhi.zope.net/archives/dailyindependent/story_detail?story_id=36788 }}</ref>

The city received $850,000 in state grants in 2004 to jump start construction on a segment from 13th to 14th Streets along Winchester Avenue. <ref name="DI_111204"/> In 2005, construction extended to 15th Street. An additional $3 million from state and federal grants is required for completion to 18th Street; completion is scheduled for 2008.

Along with the streetscape project, a Judd Plaza renovation is also being planned. <ref name="DI_102504">{{ cite news | last=Crace | first=Beth | title="Mayor advocates Judd Plaza upgrades" | publisher=[[The Independent (Ashland)]] | date=[[2004-10-25]] | accessdate=2006-12-31 | url=http://commentsengine.cnhi.zope.net/archives/dailyindependent/story_detail?story_id=21795 }}</ref> More green space, recreational and seating areas, and a stage are envisioned for the brick-lined plaza at the corner of 16th Street and Winchester Avenue. It would be home to concerts, speeches and plays and would tie into the [[Country Music Highway]] which runs through the city. In the immediate future, a clock at the plaza may be installed that would honor the city's recent sesquicentennial celebration.
