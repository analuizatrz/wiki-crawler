'''''Hairspray''''' is a 2007 film adaptation of the [[57th Tony Awards|Tony Award]]-winning (2003) [[Hairspray (musical)|musical]], which is based on [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' [[Hairspray (1988 film)|1988 film]] of the same name. The cast includes [[John Travolta]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Amanda Bynes]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[James Marsden]], [[Brittany Snow]], [[Zac Efron]], and introducing [[Nikki Blonsky]]. The 2007 film is produced by Zadan/Meron Productions in the [[United States]] and will be distributed by [[New Line Cinema]].

The film has been rated PG by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] for "language, some suggestive content and momentary teen smoking."<ref>[http://www.filmratings.com/ filmratings.com/]</ref>

==Plot summary==
In [[1962]] [[Baltimore]], "pleasantly plump" teenager [[Tracy Turnblad]] ([[Nikki Blonsky]]) has only one passion – dancing. Her dream is to appear on ''The Corny Collins Show'', Baltimore's hippest dance party on TV. Tracy seems a natural fit for the show except for the problem that she doesn’t fit in. Her plus-sized figure has always set her apart from the cool crowd, which she is reminded of by her loving but overly protective plus-sized mother, [[Edna Turnblad|Edna]] ([[John Travolta]]). That doesn’t stop Tracy because if there is one thing she knows, it's that she was born to dance. As her father Wilbur ([[Christopher Walken]]) tells her, "Go for it! You’ve got to think big to be big."

After wowing Corny Collins ([[James Marsden]]) at her high school dance, Tracy wins a spot on his show and becomes an instant on-air sensation, much to the chagrin of the show’s reigning princess, [[Amber von Tussle]] ([[Brittany Snow]]), and her scheming mother, [[Velma von Tussle|Velma]] ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), who runs the WYZT television station. Even worse for Amber is the fact that it's not just the audience who loves the new girl in town; Amber's sweetheart [[Link Larkin]] ([[Zac Efron]]) seems to be smitten with Tracy's charms as well. This dance party gets personal as a bitter feud erupts between the girls as they compete for the coveted "Miss Teenage Hairspray 1963" crown.

At school, however, a short stint in detention and raised-eyebrows caused by the budding relationship between her best friend [[Penny Pingleton]] ([[Amanda Bynes]]) and [[Seaweed J. Stubbs]] (Elijah Kelley), opens Tracy's eyes to a bigger issue: racial inequality. Throwing caution to the wind, she leads a march with [[Motormouth Maybelle]] ([[Queen Latifah]]) to fight for integration and winds up with an arrest warrant instead. Tracy is on the run now and - literally - goes underground to Penny’s basement.

The majority of the filming was done in Canada rather than Baltimore because of lower costs in Canada and because Toronto was better equipped with the soundstages needed to film a musical. They will also do some of the post-production, including some of the musical numbers, in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Lord Landsdowne P.S was a location where the movie was filmed. Scenes in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] were shot between [[November 22]] to [[December 2]] at the old Queen Victoria School.
