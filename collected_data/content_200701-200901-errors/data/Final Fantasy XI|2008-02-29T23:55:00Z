{{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy XI'''''|ファイナルファンタジーXI|Fainaru Fantajī Irebun}}, also known as ''Final Fantasy XI: Online'', is a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) developed and published by [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) as a part of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' video game series. It debuted in [[Japan]] on the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2) [[video game console]] on [[May 16]], [[2002]] and was released for [[Microsoft Windows]]-based [[personal computer]]s on November 5 of the same year. It was then localized and released for the North American market on [[October 28]], [[2003]], and for the European market on [[September 17]], [[2004]]. An [[Xbox 360]] version was released worldwide in April 2006 as the system's first [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] and also the first cross platform [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]].<ref>{{cite web |author =Tor Thorsen | title=Shippin' Out 4/17-4/21: Final Fantasy XI Online, Brain Age | publisher=GameSpot | year=April 17, 2006 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/longestjourney2wt/news.html?sid=6147765 | accessdate=2006-12-20}}</ref>

The story is set in [[Vana'diel]], a [[fantasy world]] created specifically for ''Final Fantasy XI'', where various tasks can be performed to improve a character's powers or to complete [[quest]]s. Players are able to choose from five races as they progress through the storyline of the three nations and 4 expansion packs. There are also numerous sub-plots that players can experience while playing the hundreds of quests available in the game and even competing against other players.

In January 2004, Square Enix announced that a total of over 500,000 users using more than 1 million characters were playing the game. As of 2006 there are currently between 200,000 and 300,000 active players logging in per day and the game is the dominant MMORPG in the Japanese market.<ref name="edge">{{Cite book | year=2006 | editor=Future Publishing | title=Edge June 2006; issue 163 | pages=28–29 | language=English | publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref> Four expansions for the game have been released since 2002, capitalizing on the game's success. Square Enix, as well as other sources, have reported that the number of users continues to grow at a steady pace.

==Gameplay==
{{main|Gameplay of Final Fantasy XI}}
''Final Fantasy XI'' is unlike [[List of Final Fantasy media|previous titles in the series]] in many ways. The player is able to customize their characters in limited ways, including race, gender, face, hair color, body size, job, and allegiance. Unlike previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, all battles occur in real time, and enemies are no longer randomly encountered.<ref name="official">{{cite web | title=Welcome to Vana'diel| publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Website| year=January 1, 2006| url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/intro/about/welcom.html?pageID=about | accessdate=2006-07-16}}</ref>

There are 32 worlds (a cluster of servers) available for play, and one world used by Square-Enix. Server names use names of summons from previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles such as [[Ifrit]] and [[devil|Diabolos]]. PC, PS2, and [[Xbox 360]] players from across all geographic locations play together on the same servers. There are no region-specific servers, unlike other online games, and players of different languages can interact through automatic language translation.<ref>{{cite web |author=Zonk| title=Protecting Final Fantasy XI From the Gil-Sellers| publisher=Slashdot| year=September 7, 2007| url=http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/09/07/1336213 | accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref>

===Interface===
Players have the option of using any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and [[Game controller|controller]] to play ''Final Fantasy XI''. If a player using [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] or Xbox 360 does not have a keyboard, the game also provides a method for him or her to communicate within the game (although it would be significantly slower than having a hardware keyboard input). The [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]] in ''Final Fantasy XI'' consists of a log window, menus, and several game information elements. The log window at the bottom of the screen displays system messages, battle messages, and text input by other players. Players may choose to filter what appears in the log window. "Menus" allow the player to access different commands, status windows, and configuration options. As well as the main menu, which contains the majority of the options for the game, the "action command menu" appears just above the log window and gives the player several options to interact with the game world. Several menu options are available through the use of keyboard shortcuts as well.<ref name="manual">{{Cite book | year=2001 | editor=Square Enix| title=Final Fantasy XI instruction manual| pages=81–83 | language=English | publisher=Square Enix}}</ref> Square Enix also announced their intention to let players communicate by text messaging with people playing the game online.<ref>{{cite web |author = IGN Staff| title=Final Fantasy XI Goes Wireless| publisher=IGN.com | year=July 26, 2004 | url=http://wireless.ign.com/articles/533/533357p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref>

===Basic gameplay===
[[Image:IngameimageFinalFantasyXI.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A player engaged in a text-based conversation with other players online]]
Gameplay in ''Final Fantasy XI'' consists of two major components: [[Quest (gaming)|quests]], which do not advance the main storyline but fill out the game's fantasy world, and missions, through which the main storyline of the game is told.<ref>{{cite web |author =| title= Quests, Missions, Conquest | publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Site | year=January 1, 2007 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/guide/system/quests.html?pageID=system| accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref> Quests may be undertaken for various rewards. At release, over 100 quests were available to play and new quests are added frequently.<ref name="IGNreview">{{cite web |author =Onur Komili| title=Final Fantasy XI Review| publisher=IGN.com | year=December 1, 2003 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/380/380011p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> Missions are undertaken to advance in rank, to access new areas and gain new privileges and to advance the various storylines in the game. Each nation and expansion has its own set of missions, which a player must complete to advance in rank; a player may only complete missions for his home country.

Battles in ''Final Fantasy XI'' take place in the same world in which players move around, unlike previous ''Final Fantasy'' games in which a battle would take place in a new screen. Monsters within the game operate under a system of "claim" and "enmity". A monster is "claimed" the moment a player performs any offensive action upon it, including but not limited to attacks, usage of offensive job abilities and casting an (offensive) spell. With some exceptions, once a monster is claimed it can only be attacked by players in the party or alliance of the player that claimed it. A monster will focus its attention on whoever has built up the most enmity. Players have a number of means at their disposal, from spells to abilities to items, to both build up enmity and shed it.

Although there was originally no system allowing players to compete in battle with each other, it was eventually added to the game.
In April of 2004, Ballista, the first form of player versus player was released,<ref>{{cite web | title=Conflict: Rules of Ballista | publisher=Play Online | year=April, 2004 | url=http://www.playonline.com/comnewsus/200404225213.html | accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> followed by Brenner, a second form of player versus player, in February of 2006. The Player vs. Player (PvP) system is known as ''Conflict''. Players may only compete directly against one another under very specific circumstances. Conflict happens only in "matches" that players enter by their own consent; players cannot attack one another outside of these circumstances. There are two types of Conflict matches. In ''Ballista'', the objective is to score points by throwing a rock, or "Petra," into a castle-like construction called a "Rook."<ref>{{cite web |author =| title=Chapter 2: Event Name Ballista| publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Site | year=January 1, 2006 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/guide/conflict/ballista02.html?pageID=conflict| accessdate=2006-08-17}}</ref> In ''Brenner'', a newer PvP type, players must steal the opposing team's flame and place them in "Flammen-Brenner" on their side. By maintaining these flames, points are awarded. The team with the most points by the end of the round is announced the winner. With the expansion [[Expansions_of_Final_Fantasy_XI#Treasures_of_Aht_Urhgan|Treasures of Aht Urhgan]], two other modes known as "Assault" and "Besieged" were added.<ref>{{cite web |author = Gerald Villoria| title=Preview: Final Fantasy XI: Treasures of Aht Urhgan (X360)| publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Site | year=March 14, 2006 | url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/final-fantasy-xi/695864p1.html| accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref>

===Crafting and hobbies===
[[Image:ChocoboridersFFXI.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The raising and racing of [[Chocobo]]s was a much requested feature]]
In addition to completing quests and missions, players can participate in several side activities or minigames.<ref name="official" /> Various means of item collection allow the player to retrieve items from the world. Harvesting produces items from plants, excavating produces bone items, logging produces varying kinds of wood and mining produces metal ores and uncut gemstones. Players can fish and measure their characters strength against the strength of fish that bite at their line. Gardening allows players to raise plants in their residence (known in-game as a "mog house").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/442/442564p1.html|title=Final Fantasy XI|publisher=[[IGN]]|last=Komili|first=Onur |date=2003-12-01|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> Clamming is a [[minigame]] where players collect as many fish or sea creatures as possible without going over a limit predetermined by the size bucket they're carrying. [[Chocobo]] digging is when a player commands a bird called a chocobo to dig up items from random spots on the ground.
The summer 2006 update has allowed for the long requested ability for players to raise and breed [[chocobo]]s.<ref>{{cite web | author=Douglass C. Perry|title=It's Chocobo Breeding Time| publisher=IGN.com | year=June 1, 2006 | url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/710/710971p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> As of [[March 28]], [[2007]], players can now experience the first installment of the Chocobo Racing system.<ref>{{cite web | author=Jim Cordeira|title=FINAL FANTASY XI: Chocobo Racing to launch this week| publisher=Gaming Age.com | year=March 27, 2007| url=http://www.gaming-age.com/news/2007/3/27-44 | accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref> Players are allowed to enter their home-grown chocobos into races against NPCs. 

Players can win Chocobucks used to buy prizes, such as items to assist in breeding. As of [[June 6]], [[2007]], Square Enix performed a version update which consisted of many things including: a new Aht Urghan Mission being added, Einherjar being introduced, and Mog Locker capacity increased to 80 slots.<ref>{{cite web | author=|title=Jun. 6, 2007 (JST) Version Update| publisher=Play Online | year=June 6th, 2007| url=http://www.playonline.com/pcd/update/ff11us/20070606TsVPr1/detail.html |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> As of [[June 12]], [[2007]], The mercenary rank "Second Lieutenant" was introduced. Square Enix has also addressed several issues such as the amount of damage inflicted by the weaponskill "Catastrophe" was unintentionally reduced, and if users had set their time to "12 hour time" the game would display the time as 10 minutes early.<ref>{{cite web | author=|title=Final Fantasy XI Update (June 12)| publisher=Play Online | year=June 12th, 2007| url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/polnews/news10584.shtml | accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy XI'' has a fairly complex item creation system, in which players use elemental crystals obtained by fighting the various monsters to turn specific combinations of items into other items in a process called "synthesis". <ref>{{cite web |author =| title= Crystals and Synthesis | publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Site | year=January 1, 2007 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/guide/system/item.html?pageID=system | accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref> Also, unlike ''World of Warcraft'', each synthesis has a chance of failure (which can be reduced by increasing the skill related to the recipe but cannot be eliminated) while most recipes have a small chance to produce a high-quality item (this chance is increased by increasing the skill related to the recipe; high quality items generally have better stats), which also means that the risk-reward factor on certain items are extremely high. Different recipes, using different classes of ingredients and different [[craft]] skills, will produce different types of items. There are nine types of crafting skills; some recipes requires a player to have two or even three skills at certain levels for the player to be able to even attempt to synthesize the item. Other recipes also call for additional key items that a player must possess in order to be able to create certain items. n [[July 8]], [[2002]], Square also shut down the item auction system due to some players exploiting the system.<ref>{{cite web |author =IGN Staff| title=Final Fantasy XI Cheats Exposed| publisher=IGN.com | year=July 8, 2002 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/364/364168p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref>

===Game economy===
''Final Fantasy XI'' has an almost entirely player-based economy with a heavy reliance on "Auction Houses" in each of the major cities of Vana'diel. The only monsters in the game that drop any in-game currency known as [[Common elements of Final Fantasy#Currency|gil]] when defeated are the Beastmen, humanoids which fight against player characters. However, Beastmen drop very small amounts of gil, meaning that unlike other games in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, it is very difficult to make much money merely by slaughtering monsters. Various items used in crafting, as well as sometimes extremely rare items, may drop off the monsters that are defeated. Although the game economy is mostly in the hands of the players, there are certain economic controls in place. Money may go to a [[non-player character]] (NPC), as when players purchase items from NPC merchants or rent certain forms of transportation.  Fees are also levied by certain NPC's to store sets of armor or holiday event items.  A fee is charged to place items up for auction at the Auction House and in certain cities. Players making purchases from player-run "bazaars" within some of the cities are taxed a percentage of the item's set price. Since transportation, auction house, item storage, and tax fees do not go to players, these [[Gold sink|gilsinks]] effectively remove money from the economy. [[Square Enix]] has attempted to increase the opportunity for players to find rare items in order to equalize the game and stop the practice of "gil selling", or exchanging real money for in-game items.<ref>{{cite web | author=ELLIOT GUISINGER|title=Final Fantasy XI Economy to be Upgraded| publisher=RPGamer| year=December 6th, 2004| url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2004/120604a.html | accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref> In early 2006, Square Enix discovered that a group of players had found a way to generate the game currency and exchange it for real currency, which in turn drove up prices for all items across the game. In response, 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300 billion Gil was removed from circulation. This effort is an attempt to stop the interaction between real and [[virtual economy]] in the online game.<ref>{{cite web |author =IGN Staff| title=Final Fantasy XI Smacks Down Cheaters| publisher=IGN.com | year=February 10, 2006 | url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/687/687847p1.html|accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> Square Enix has stated that the trade of items for real currency is officially a violation of the [[Terms of Service]] for ''Final Fantasy XI''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Terms and Conditions | publisher=PlayOnline | year=December 8, 2004 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/polnews/news3374.shtml | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> In July 2006, Square Enix banned or suspended over 8,000 other accounts for similar manipulation and commerce.<ref>{{cite web | title=Square Enix bans more FFXI accounts| publisher=Gamespot.com | year=July 24, 2006 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6154572.html |author = Patrick Caldwell|accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref> Since the update, Square Enix has been regularly banning players' accounts found in violation of the terms, some of them using third-party tools, effectively removing billions of gil from the in-game economy.

==Setting==
{{main|Vana'diel}}
{{seealso|List of Final Fantasy XI characters}}
The world of ''Final Fantasy XI'' is known as "[[Vana'diel]]". It consists of two main landmasses with two smaller islands flanking them, which in turn are surrounded by small islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the northern glaciers to the southern deserts.<ref>{{cite web | title=Locations| publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Website | year=January 1, 2006 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/intro/world/index.html | accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref> The four main cities in Vana'diel are Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno. The expansion ''Treasures of Aht Urhgan'' added the large Aht Urhgan Whitegate/Al Zahbi city area. The rest of Vana'diel is made up of a number of outdoor, dungeon, and minor town areas split into various regions. While most areas are accessible by walking, various modes of transportation, ranging from the classic ''Final Fantasy'' [[chocobo]] and [[Common elements of Final Fantasy#Airships|airships]] to special spells, facilitate movement across the game world.

The five playable races in ''Final Fantasy XI'' are Elvaan, strong [[melee]] fighters, reasonable healers but weak in [[black magic]]; Hume, a race resembling humans, with no notable strengths or weaknesses; Galka, an all-male race, strong and tough, but weak with magic; Mithra, agile and dexterous, but physically weak, cat-like humanoids of which only the females of the race are playable characters and Tarutaru, tiny humanoids with incredible power over black magic, but physically weak.<ref name="official" /> In addition to the player races, there are two primary non-playable races known as the Zilart, an ancient race which is the focus of the first two game expansions, and the Kuluu, a race of beings similar to the Zilart and thought to be inferior to it. There is also a huge supporting cast of NPCs who give quests and missions and appear in the game's storylines. The game features several typical [[Monsters of Final Fantasy|''Final Fantasy'' monsters]] as well as Beastmen, which includes races such as the Goblin, Orc, Yagudo, and Quadav. Some of these creatures follow the Shadow Lord, one source of the game's conflict.<ref>{{cite web | title=Adversaries: The Beastmen Forces| publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Website | year=January 1, 2006 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/intro/monster/tribe.html?pageID=monster | accessdate=2006-08-17}}</ref>

There are nine major plotlines in ''Final Fantasy XI'', including the storylines of the 3 nations (San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst), the four expansion packs (Rise of the Zilart, Chains of Promathia, Treasures of Aht Urhgan, and Wings of the Goddess) and 2 sets of Dynamis realms. The Dynamis storylines are unique in that the storyline progresses through clearing special Dynamis zones, not through completing missions as with the other storylines in the game (although due to the nature of the Dynamis storyline, players must have other storylines advanced to a certain point in order to start it). There are also numerous sub-plots that players can experience while solving the hundreds of quests available in the game.

On [[June 14]], [[2002]], the game server was down for four hours for maintenance to the database servers, bug fixes on the text interface and a new patch for the game client.<ref>{{cite web |author = IGN Staff| title=Final Fantasy XI Server Downtime | publisher=IGN.com | year=June 12, 2002 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/362/362009p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> This is thought to be the first patch ever released for a console game.<ref>{{cite web |author = IGN Staff| title=Final Fantasy XI First Patch| publisher=IGN.com | year=June 11, 2002 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/361/361927p1.html|accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> New servers were added, allowing American players to start on fresh servers without far more experienced players. With new expansions and updates, the size of the game has greatly increased, however, the Vana'diel Collection DVD has greatly reduced install time.  Developers have also reduced the amount of experience needed to fully level a character end game, as well as included new ways to gain experience such as easily obtainable items which grant increased experience for defeating enemies. As of December 2006, the [[PlayStation 2]] versions of PlayOnline and Final Fantasy XI install and run on [[PlayStation 3]]. A download from the PlayStation Store and ten gigabytes of available disk space (for the PS2 drive image) are required to enable support for the software on PlayStation 3. The new Vana'diel Collection 2008 discs for PlayStation 2 had installation issues on the [[PlayStation 3]] causing them to be unuseable without the original installs.  This problem was fixed on [[December 18]], [[2007]], however, when [[firmware]] update 2.10 allowed the disc to work properly. As of March 2007, the PC version of Final Fantasy XI is compatible with [[Windows Vista]]. After working with Microsoft to resolve Final Fantasy XI's incompatibility issues with Windows Vista, Square Enix released a downloadable version of the PlayOnline client which is compatible with the [[operating system]], fixing the main incompatibility issue. While smaller bugs are still known to exist, such as the client not launching correctly through [[Windows Media Center]], the new client allows Final Fantasy XI to run correctly on Windows Vista.<ref>{{cite web | title=Support for Microsoft Windows Vista | publisher=PlayOnline | year=March 22, 2007 | url=http://www.playonline.com/homeus/headline/news01.html | accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>

==Audio==
{{main|Music of Final Fantasy XI}}
Unlike ''Final Fantasy X'', ''Final Fantasy XI'' does not have any [[voice acting|voice actors]] for cutscenes, only for battle cries and related sounds. The only voice acting is the opening CGI to the game, none of the non-player characters speak during gameplay. Instead text descriptions are used to indicate what they are communicating to the players. The opening CGI also features choral music with lyrics in [[Esperanto]].<ref>{{cite web |author =Tim Van| title=Final Fantasy XI OST| publisher=RPGfan.com | year=January 01, 2007 | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff11/index.html | accessdate=2006-02-24}}</ref> According to its composer, [[Nobuo Uematsu]], the choice of language was meant to symbolize the developers' hope that their online game could contribute to cross-cultural communication and cooperation.

The music of ''Final Fantasy XI'' was [[video game music|scored]] by [[Nobuo Uematsu]], [[Naoshi Mizuta]], and [[Kumi Tanioka]]. The expansion packs were scored by Mizuta alone after Tanioka left to pursue other projects and Uematsu left Square Enix. A holiday score titled ''Jeuno -Starlight Celebration-'' could be heard in the city of Jeuno during mid to late December. It was first introduced on December 2004 and has been played each December since then. The music can also be heard while in the area known as Dynamis—Tavnazia. A vocal, ''Distant Worlds'', performed by Izumi Masuda, composed by Uematsu and arranged by Mizuta, was later released in a July 2005 patch and was released on the Japan [[iTunes]] Music Store of [[13 September]] [[2005]].

Nobuo Uematsu noted the increased difficulty of scoring a game for which there was no linear plotline, a major change from the previous ten ''Final Fantasy'' games. It was also the first game in the series for which he composed while he was no longer a Square employee.<ref>{{cite web |author =Rob Fahey| title=Focus On: Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu| publisher=gamesindustry.biz | year=February 25, 2005 | url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=7033 | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> The 2004–2005 concert series, [[Dear Friends -Music from Final Fantasy-]], featured "Ronfaure" from ''Final Fantasy XI''.
