'''William Alfred Brown''' (born [[July 31]] [[1912]] in [[Toowoomba]], [[Queensland]]) is a former  [[Australian]] [[Test cricket]]er who played for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] and [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]], later serving as a Test selector.

He was a member of [[Don Bradman]]'s [[1948]] '''''[[The Invincibles (cricket)|Invincibles]]''''' team and is Australia's oldest living Test cricketer.

Brown was named as a [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]] in [[1939]] and in [[2000]] awarded the
Medal of the [[Order of Australia]] for services to cricket. 

In September [[2005]], he commented on [[English cricket team|England]]'s victory in [[The 2005 Ashes|the Ashes]] by saying: ''"A strong England side is the best thing that could have happened for the Ashes and world cricket"''.

==Early years==
Brown was born in [[Toowoomba]] in [[Queensland]], the son of a dairy farmer and hotel owner. When business failure hit the family, they moved to [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]] in inner [[Sydney]] when Brown was three.<ref name="az">{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =p. 67}}</ref> He was educated at Dulwich Hill and Petersham High Schools in [[Sydney]], and started as a wicket-keeper, before becoming an opening batsmen.<Ref name="wisden"/> He left high school after two years but in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], was unable to find regular full time work.<ref name="az"/> In 1929&ndash;30 he joined the Marrickville in [[Sydney Grade Cricket]], but unable to hold down a regular place, he had almost decided to leave Sydney. An innings of 172 for his Shire team reinvigorated him, progressing through the grades until he reached his first XI, where steady performances saw him selected in 1932&ndash;33 he appeared for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] team.<Ref name="wisden">{{cite web|title= Wisden 1939 - Bill Brown |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/154647.html| publisher=[[Wisden]] |year=1939|accessdate=2007-11-30}}</ref>

==Career==
On his first-class debut for New South Wales in a [[Sheffield Shield]] match against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] on [[November 11]] [[1932]] he was run out for a [[Duck (cricket)|diamond duck]] without facing a ball in an opening partnership with [[Jack Fingleton]]. <Ref name="az"/>  The highlight of his debut season was a 79 against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]], and a 69 against [[Douglas Jardine]]'s touring [[England cricket team|England]] as part of the [[Bodyline]] tour. The following season, in November 1933, Brown made 154 at [[Brisbane]] and shared in a partnership of 294 with [[Don Bradman]]. <Ref name="wisden"/>  He followed this with a big opening stand with Fingleton against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]], scoring 205. His performances secured him selection for the 1934 tour of England. He had put in similar performances to his opening partner Fingleton, with only one opening spot available on the tour with the presence of incumbent Victorian pair [[Bill Ponsford]] and captain [[Bill Woodfull]]. The selectors asked [[Don Bradman]], Australi’s leading batsman and state team-mate to Brown and Fingleton, for advice. Bradman nominated Brown, believing that his style was better suited to English pitches.<ref name="p175">Perry, p. 175.</ref> A 119 against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] early in the tour saw him break into the Test XI. <Ref name="wisden"/>  Playing in all five Tests, he made his debut at [[Trent Bridge]], [[Nottingham]], scoring 73, in the second innings after Australia had lost three early wickets to help secure a winning lead. He made his maiden Test century, 105 in the first innings of the Second Test at [[Lord’s]], the home of cricket, but was unable to help Australia avoid the follow-on and an innings defeat. He was promoted to open with [[Bill Ponsford]] in the Third Test, where he made 72. Brown was unable to pass 20 in the final two Tests and ended the series with 300 runs at 33.3. Despite not making a substantial contribution, Australia won the Fifth Test to take the series 2&ndash;1, reclaiming the Ashes.<ref name="testlist"/> 

With the retirement of Woodfull and Ponsford at the end of the tour, Brown and his state partner Fingleton became Australia’s opening pair for the 1935&ndash;36 tour of South Africa. Brown started the tour consistently with three consecutive half centuries in the first two Tests in [[Durban]] and [[Johannesburg]].<ref name="testlist"/> In the Third Test at [[Cape Town]], the pair set a new Australian opening record of 233 which laid the foundation for a large Australian total and an innings victory.<ref name="az"/> He posted 121, a new highest score. He scored 34 and 84 in the only Australian innings of the Fourth and Fifth Test  in Johannesburg and Durban, making solid opening partnerships with Fingleton, who scored three centuries consecutively. They laid the platform for two further innings victories as Australia took the series 4&ndash;0. His compiled 417 runs at 59.57 for the series.<ref name="testlist"/> 

In 1936 Brown took a coaching position for Queensland, representing the side from 1936&ndash;37 onwards and being appointed captain the following season. His 1936&ndash;37 season was interrupted by injury and he appeared in only two Tests against England.<ref name="az"/> They were relatively unsuccessful, netting 95 runs at 23.75 in four innings without passing fifty on any occasion.<ref name="testlist"/>

His form started to deteriorate in 1937&ndash;38, and his selection for the 1938 tour to England was criticised in some quarters. He scored an unbeaten 196 against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]].<ref name="wisden"/> He scored a century of 133 in the first Test at Nottingham after Australia were forced to follow on, helping Bradman (144*) to save the Test with a draw. 

Brown’s most celebrated innings came at Lord’s in the Second Test, where he scored 206 as he carried his bat. England had batted first and amassed 494, largely on the back of 240 by [[Wally Hammond]]. Brown put on an opening stand of 69 before his partner Fingleton was dismissed.<ref>Perry, p. 173.</ref> Bradman was bowled for 18 by [[Hedley Verity]], leaving the score at 101, before [[Stan McCabe]] was dismissed after a quick 38 with the score at 3/152. Brown’s innings was highlighted by his driving on both sides of the wicket as he reached his century in 193 minutes. After [[Lindsay Hassett]] was dismissed for 56 after a 134 run partneship, Australia closed at 5/299 with Brown on 140. The following day, Brown continued past his double century and ended on 206 from 375 minutes when his last partner fell and Australia were all out for 422. They went on to draw the match.<Ref name="p174">Perry, p. 174.</ref>

Brown missed the Third Test due to injury, but was the top Australian scorer in both innings with 69 and 15 at Fifth Test at [[The Oval]] where [[Len Hutton]] scored a world record 364 and England compiled 903. In the Tests he aggregated 512 runs at 73.14.<ref name="testlist"/> He also recorded his highest first class score of 265* against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]] to compile 1854 runs at 59.57 for the tour, second only to Bradman in aggregates and average.<ref name="az"/> He was named as one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] for his 1938 performances, who described him as a "cricketer of remarkable powers" who batted with "a charming skill, coolness, thoughtfulness and certainty".<ref name="wisden"/>

Upon returning to Australia, he scored 1057 runs in the 1938&ndash;39 Australian season, 990 of these in six Shield matches. He combined with Geoff Cook in a Queensland first wicket partnership of 265 in a run chase to secure an eight wicket victory over New South Wales.<ref name="az"/> He also made an unbeaten 174 against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]], carrying his bat at the [[Adelaide Oval]].<ref name="p176"/> 

In 1940, Brown married Barbara Hart, a receptionist.<ref name="p176"/>

== World War II and post-war career ==

Brown served with the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] as a flight lieutenant during [[World War II]], losing his prime years between the ages of 27 to 33.<ref name="az"/> During the pre-war years, he had averaged 49.02 in Test cricket.<ref name="testlist"/> 
Brown returned to captain the Australian side for Australia’s inaugural Test against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in [[Wellington]], a match that was retrospectively given Test status. With regular captain [[Don Bradman]] missing, Brown led a team that included seven debutants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62661.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-11-28|title=Only Test:New Zealand vs Australia at Wellington, March 29-30, 1946}}</ref> Brown lost the toss and the home side elected to bat first on a [[sticky wicket]]. [[Leg spin]]ner [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O’Reilly]] in his last Test and [[Ernie Toshack]] on debut, took 5/14 and 4/12 as New Zealand were bowled out for only 42. In reply, Brown top-scored with 67 as Australia took a substantial lead with a score of 8/199 declared. Australia then removed New Zealand for 54 in the second innings and took vitory by an innings and 54 runs in just two days.<ref name="p176"/>

In the 1946&ndash;47 season, he missed the Test series against England due to a thumb injury.<ref name="az"/>  This allowed young New South Wales opener [[Arthur Morris]] to make his debut. Morris’ performance in the series eventually saw Brown displaced from his position as a first-choice opening batsman.<Ref name="morris"/>

== Mankad ==
Brown returned to the Test team for the 1947&ndash;48 for the Indian tour of Australia. Apart from the two Tests that Brown had played during the 1936&ndash;37 season against England, Brown had not played Test cricket on Australian soil.<ref name="testlist"/> He only had one opportunity in the First Test in Brisbane, making 11 as India fell to an innings defeat.<ref name="testlist"/> Brown’s participation in the series was overshadowed when he was controversially [[run out]] by Indian [[left arm orthodox spin]]ner [[Vinoo Mankad]] in the Second Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] for 18. Brown was run out by Mankad when, in the act of delivering the ball, Mankad held on to it and whipped the bails off at the non-striker’s end with Brown well out of his crease while he was backing-up the striker. This was the second time Mankad had dismissed Brown in this fashion on this tour - he had done it in an earlier match against an Australian XI. On that occasion Mankad had warned Brown once before running him out. The Australian press strongly accused Mankad of being unsportsmanlike, though some Australians, including [[Don Bradman]] defended Mankad's actions. After this incident, if a batsman is given out this way, he is said to have been Mankaded. The dismissal saw another low scoring innings and Brown was dropped from the team for the next two Tests.<ref name="p176">Perry, p. 176.</ref> [[Arthur Morris]], who had established himself as one of Australia’s first-choice opening batsmen during Brown’s injury layoff during the previous season, was rested for the Fifth Test as the Australian Board trialled potential candidates for the upcoming tour of England in 1948.<Ref name="morris">{{cite web| title= Wisden 1949 - Arthur Morris |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/234445.html| year= [[1949]] |accessdate=2007-05-21| publisher= [[Wisden]]}}</ref>} Brown was recalled and made 99 in the first innings, before being run out.<ref name="p176"/> India fell to another innings defeat so Brown did not have another opportunity to score a Test century on home soil. His Test aggregate in Australia stood at 223 runs at only 33.86 in contrast to his away average of 1369 runs at 50.70.<Ref name="testlist"/>
In any case, Brown had done enough to be chosen to tour England with the "Invincibles" in 1948.<ref name="az"/> He played in the first two Tests in the middle order as [[Sid Barnes]] and [[Arthur Morris]] were the preferred openers, before losing his place to 19 year old [[Neil Harvey]].<ref name="p176"/> His final Test was in the Second Test at Lord’s, where he was unable to replicate the centuries he made in the preceding tours, making 24 and 32.<ref name="testlist"/> He made eight centuries and totaled 1448 runs on the tour. With his opportunities diminishing, he retired at the end of the 1949&ndash;50 season after captaining the Australian second team to New Zealand while the first choice Test team toured [[South Africa]].<ref name="az"/> He had been less effective in his later years, averaging 38.29 in Test cricket following the resumption after the Second World War.<ref name="testlist">{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=636;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1934-06-08;start=1934-06-08;enddefault=1948-06-29;end=1948-06-29;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype| accessdate=2007-11-30| title=Statsguru - WA Brown - Tests - Innings by innings list |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref>

He was a Queensland selector from 1950&ndash;51 to 1959&ndash;60 and an Australian selector in 1952&ndash;53. His brief tenure as a national selector was marked by abuse and harassment from parochial Queenslanders who were upset that he did not include his fellow statesmen in the Test team.<ref name="p177">Perry, p. 177.</ref> In 1992 the [[Queensland Cricket Association]] elected him a life member.<ref name="az"/>

== Style ==
In addition to his batting, Brown was a highly regarded fieldsman. He developed his skills with persistent training with professional sprinters in order to learn anticipation and quickness off the mark. Brown was regarded as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He was known for his trademnark leg glancing and placement of the ball.<ref name="az"/><ref name="wisden"/> Johnnie Moyes saud theat "even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults."<Ref name="p177"/> Moyes felt that Brown’s superior performance on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. Moyes felt that the more serene gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hurrying himself to placate impatient spectators. "A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic."<ref name="p175"/>
