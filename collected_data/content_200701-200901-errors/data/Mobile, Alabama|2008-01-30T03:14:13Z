===Colonial===
The settlement of Mobile, then known as [[Old Mobile Site|''Fort Louis de la Louisiane'']], was first established in 1702, at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff on the [[Mobile River]], as the first capital of the [[French colonial empires|French colony]] of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. It was founded by [[French Canadian]] brothers [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]], in order to establish control over France's Louisiana claims with Bienville having been made governor of French Louisiana in 1701.  Mobile’s [[Roman Catholic]] parish was established on 20 July 1703, by [[Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de Chevrières de Saint-Vallier]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]].<ref name="oldmobile1">Higginbotham, Jay. ''Old Mobile: Fort Louis de la Louisiane, 1702-1711'',pages 106-107. Museum of the City of Mobile, 1977. ISBN 0914334034.</ref> The parish was the first established on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]].<ref name="oldmobile1"/>  The year 1704 saw the arrival of 23 women to the colony aboard the ''Pélican'', along with [[yellow fever]] introduced to the ship in [[Havana]].<ref name="pelican">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 20-21. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>  Though most of the "''Pélican'' girls" recovered, a large number of the existing colonists and the neighboring Native Americans died from the illness.<ref name="pelican"/> This early period also saw the arrival of the first [[African]] [[slaves]] aboard a French supply ship from [[Saint-Domingue]]. <ref name="pelican"/> The population of the colony fluctuated over the next few years, growing to 279 persons by 1708 yet descending to 178 persons two years later due to disease.<ref name="oldmobile1"/> 

[[Image:Mobile1725.jpg|thumb|left|Mobile and Fort Condé in 1725.]]
These additional outbreaks of disease and a series of floods caused Bienville to order the town relocated several miles downriver to its present location at the confluence of the [[Mobile River]] and [[Mobile Bay]] in 1711.<ref>Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 17-27. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>  A new earth and palisade ''Fort Louis'' was constructed at the new site during this time.<ref name=MoMfort>"Other Locations: Historic Fort Conde" (history),Museum of Mobile, Mobile, Alabama, 2006, webpage:[http://www.museumofmobile.com/html/other_museums.php MoM-Other]</ref>  By 1712, when [[Antoine Crozat]] took over administration of the colony by royal appointment, the colony boasted a population of 400 persons. In 1713 a new governor was appointed by Crozat, [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac]], founder of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]].<ref name="cadillac">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 30-32. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>  He did not last long due to allegations of mismanagement and a lack of growth in the colony, and he was recalled to France in 1716.  Bienville again took the helm as governor, serving the office for less than a year until the new governor, [[Jean-Michel de Lepinay]], arrived from France.<ref name="cadillac"/> Lepinay, however, did not last long either due to Crozat's relinquishing control of the colony in 1717 and the shift in administration to [[John Law (economist)|John Law]] and his [[Compagnie Perpetuelle des Indes|Company of the Indies]].<ref name="cadillac"/> Bienville found himself once again governor of Louisiana and in 1719 decided to move the capital elsewhere.<ref name="cadillac"/>  

The capital of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] was moved to [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] in 1720,<ref name=MoMfort/> leaving Mobile relegated to the role of military and trading outpost.  In 1723 the construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began<ref name=MoMfort/> and it was renamed [[Fort Conde|Fort Condé]] in honor of [[Louis Henri, Duc de Bourbon]] and [[Princes of Condé|prince of Condé]].<ref name="conde1"|>{{cite web|title="Historic Fort Conde"|work="Museum of Mobile"|url=http://www.museumofmobile.com/html/other_museums.php|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> Mobile would maintain the role of major trade center with the Native Americans throughout the French period, leading to the almost universal use of [[Mobilian Jargon]] as the simplified trade language with the Native Americans from present-day [[Florida]] to [[Texas]].<ref name="mobilianpid"/>

[[Image:West Florida Map 1767.jpg|thumb|The expanded West Florida territory in 1767.]]
In 1763, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed, ending the [[French and Indian War]]. The treaty [[ceded]] Mobile and the surrounding territory to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and it was made a part of the expanded British [[West Florida]] colony.<ref name="setmob1">{{cite web|title="Early European Conquests and the Settlement of Mobile"|work="Alabama Department of Archives and History"|url=http://www.alabamamoments.state.al.us/sec02qs.html|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref>   The British changed the name of Fort Condé to Fort Charlotte, after [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III's]] queen.<ref name="setmob2">{{cite web|title="Mobile: Alabama's Tricentennial City"|work="Alabama Department of Archives and History"|url=http://www.archives.state.al.us/mobile/mobile3.html|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref>  The British were eager not to lose any useful inhabitants and promised religious tolerance to the French colonists, ultimately 112 French Mobilians remained in the colony.<ref name="britmob1">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 44-45. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001.

''The Story of Mobile'', page 45. Mobile, Alabama: Gill Press, 1953. ISBN 0940882140</ref>  The Spanish captured the town in 1780 during the [[Battle of Fort Charlotte]].  The Spanish wished to eliminate any British threat to their Louisiana colony, which they had received from France in 1763s Treaty of Paris.<ref name=storymobile1/>  Their actions were also condoned by the revolting American colonies due to the fact that [[West Florida]] remained loyal to the [[British Crown]].<ref name=storymobile1/> The fort was renamed [[Fort Conde|Fortaleza Carlota]], with the Spanish holding Mobile and the surrounding [[Mobile District]] as a part of Spanish [[West Florida]] until 1810 when the Mobile District became part of the briefly independent [[Republic of West Florida]].  The Spanish continued to hold onto the town of Mobile itself until 1813, when the weakly defended port was seized by the U.S. General [[James Wilkinson]] during the [[War of 1812]].<ref name="wilkinson">{{cite web|title="James Wilkinson"|work="War of 1812"|url=http://www.galafilm.com/1812/e/people/wilkinson.html|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref>

When Mobile was captured by the [[United States]] and made a  part of the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1813 the population had dwindled to roughly 300 people.<ref name="antebellum1">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 65. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>   The city was included in the [[Alabama Territory]] in 1817, after [[Mississippi]] gained statehood. Alabama was granted statehood in 1819 and Mobile's population had increased to 809 by that time.<ref name="antebellum1"/> As the inland areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by farmers and the slave-based [[plantation]] economy became established, Mobile came to be settled by merchants, attorneys, mechanics, doctors and others seeking to capitalize on trade with these upriver areas.<ref name="antebellum1"/>  With its location at the mouth of the Mobile River, a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi, Mobile was well situated for this purpose.  By 1822 the population was 2800.<ref name="antebellum1"/>  

From the 1830s onward Mobile expanded into a city of commerce with a primary focus on the cotton trade.<ref name="antebellum1">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 69-71. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>  The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fire-proof brick warehouses.<ref name="antebellum1"/>  The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] and by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation.<ref name="antebellum1"/>  With the economy so focused on this one crop, Mobile's fortunes were always tied to those of cotton and the city weathered many financial crises during this period.<ref name="antebellum1"/>  Though Mobile had a relatively small slave owning population itself compared to the inland areas, it was the slave-trading center of the state until surpassed by [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] in the 1850s.<ref name="antebellum2">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 79-80. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>  By 1860 Mobile's population within the city limits had reached 29,258 people, it was the 27th largest city in the United States and 4th largest in what would soon be the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref name="1860cen">{{cite web|title="Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places:  1860"|work="U.S. Bureau of the Census

During the [[American Civil War]], Mobile was a Confederate city.  The first [[submarine]] to successfully sink an enemy ship, the [[Hunley|''H. L. Hunley'']], was built in Mobile.<ref name="Hunley">{{cite web|title="H. L.

''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 113. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>  On 12 April 1865, 3 days after the surrender of [[Robert E. Lee]] at [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse|Appomattox Courthouse]], the city of Mobile surrendered to the [[Union army]] to avoid destruction following the Union victories at the [[Battle of Spanish Fort]] and the [[Battle of Fort Blakely]].<ref name="newhist1"/>  Ironically, on 25 May 1865, the city suffered loss when some three hundred people died as a result of an [[Mobile magazine explosion|explosion]] at a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[ammunition depot]] on Beauregard Street.  The explosion left a {{convert|30|ft|m|0|sing=on}} deep hole at the depot's location, sunk ships docked on the Mobile River, and the resulting fires destroyed the northern portion of the city.<ref>Delaney, Caldwell. ''The Story of Mobile'', pages 144-146. Mobile, Alabama: Gill Press, 1953. ISBN 0940882140 </ref>  

Federal [[Reconstruction]] after the war saw the economy in near total ruin and widespread racial and class resentment develop.<ref name="reconstruction1">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'', pages 123-125. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>   Reconstruction in Mobile effectively ended in 1874 when the local [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]s gained control of the city government.<ref name="reconstruction1"/>  The last quarter of the 19th century was a time of economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile.  One example can be provided by the value of Mobile's exports during this period of depression.  The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3&nbsp;million in 1882.<ref name="exports1878">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',page 145. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001.

===20th century===
[[Image:Mobile1909A.jpg|thumb|400px|The Mobile waterfront in 1909.]]
The turn of the century brought the [[Progressive Era]] to Mobile and saw Mobile's economic structure evolve along with a significant increase in population.<ref name="progress1">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 154-169. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0817310657</ref>  The population increased from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920.<ref name="progress1"/>  During this time the city received $3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements, which drastically deepened the shipping channels in the harbor.<ref name="progress1"/>  During and after [[World War I]] manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile's economic health with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important.<ref name="progress1"/>  During the Progressive Era social equality and race relations in Mobile worsened.<ref name="progress1"/>  In 1902 the city government passed Mobile's first [[racial segregation|segregation]] ordinance, one that segregated the city streetcars.<ref name="progress1"/>  Mobile's African American population responded to this with a two-month boycott which was ultimately unsuccessful.<ref name="progress1"/>  After this, Mobile's [[de facto]] segregation would increasingly be replaced with legislated segregation.<ref name="progress1"/>  

[[World War II]] led to a massive military effort causing a considerable increase in Mobile's population, largely due to the huge influx of workers coming into Mobile to work in the shipyards and at the [[Mobile Downtown Airport|Brookley Army Air Field]].<ref name="thomason2">Thomason, Michael.

ISBN 0817310657</ref>  Between 1940 and 1943, over 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries.<ref name="thomason2"/>  Mobile was one of eighteen U.S. cities producing [[Liberty ships]] at its [[Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company]] to support the war effort by producing ships faster than the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] could sink them.<ref name="thomason2"/>  [[Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation]], a [[subsidiary]] of [[Waterman Steamship Corporation]], focused on building [[freighter]]s, [[Fletcher class destroyer]]s, and [[minesweeper]]s.<ref name="thomason2"/>  

The years after World War II brought about changes in Mobile's social structure and economy. Instead of shipbuilding being a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to take over and most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses.  This period  saw the end of racial segregation with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Though many in Mobile had considered the city to be tolerant and racially accommodating compared to other cities in the [[Southern United States|South]], with the police force and one local college becoming integrated in the 1950s and the voluntary desegregation of buses and lunchcounters by 1963, [[Caucasian race |Caucasian]] Mobilians came to realize that Mobile's African American citizens were not nearly as content with the [[status quo]] as they had previously believed when in 1963 three African American students brought a case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to [[Murphy High School]].<ref name="murphy1">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 260-261. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001.

Some [[racial equality]] issues and [[hate crime]]s continued to occur in Mobile as late as the early 1990s.<ref name="hate1">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'',pages 271-275 Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001.

This and the subsequent civil lawsuit filed by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] on behalf of Michael Donald's mother effectively put the Ku Klux Klan out of business in Alabama.<ref name="hate1"/>  A fatal police shooting of an African American man in 1992 sparked violence and unrest in Mobile, leading to the formation of a Human Relations Commission by the city in 1994.<ref name="hate1"/>

==Culture==
Mobile is home to an array of cultural influences with its French, British, Spanish, African, Creole and Catholic heritage distinguishing it from all other cities in the state of Alabama. The annual [[Carnival]] celebration is perhaps the best illustration of this.  Carnival in Mobile has evolved over the course of 300 years from a sedate French Catholic tradition into a mainstream multi-week celebration across the spectrum of cultures.<ref name="carnival4">{{cite web|title="History of Mardi Gras"|work="Mobile Bay Convention & Visitors Bureau"|url=http://www.mobile.org/vis_mardigras_history.php|accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref>
