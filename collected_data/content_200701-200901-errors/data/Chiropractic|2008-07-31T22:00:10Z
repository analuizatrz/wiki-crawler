'''Chiropractic''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chiro-'' χειρο- "hand-" + ''praktikós'' πρακτικός "concerned with action") is a [[complementary and alternative medicine]] [[health care profession]] that focuses on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mechanical disorders of the [[musculoskeletal system]] and their effects on the [[nervous system]] and general health, with special emphasis on the spine.<ref name=Nelson/> It emphasizes [[manual therapy]] including [[spinal manipulation]] and other joint and [[soft-tissue]] manipulation, and includes exercises and health and lifestyle counseling.<ref name=ccestandards/> Traditionally, it assumes that a [[vertebral subluxation]] or [[Vertebral column|spinal joint]] dysfunction can interfere with the body's function and its innate ability to heal itself.<ref name=History-PPC/>

[[Daniel David Palmer|D. D. Palmer]] founded chiropractic in the 1890s and his son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|B.J. Palmer]] helped to expand it in the early 20th century.<ref name=Martin/> It has two main groups: "straights", now the minority, emphasize [[vitalism]], [[innate intelligence]], [[spinal adjustment]]s, and subluxation as the leading cause of all disease; "mixers" are more open to mainstream and alternative medical techniques such as exercise, massage, nutritional supplements, and [[acupuncture]].<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/> Chiropractic is well established in the U.S., Canada and Australia.<ref name=global-strategy/>

For most of its existence chiropractic has battled with [[mainstream medicine]], sustained by ideas such as subluxation that are significant barriers to scientific progress within chiropractic.<ref name=History-Primer/> [[Vaccination]] remains controversial among chiropractors.<ref name=Busse/> In recent decades chiropractic has gained more legitimacy and greater acceptance among physicians and [[health plan]]s and has had a strong political base and sustained demand for services,<ref name=Cooper/> and [[evidence-based medicine]] has been used to review research studies and generate [[Medical guideline|practice guidelines]].<ref name=Villanueva-Russell/> Opinions differ as to the [[efficacy]] of chiropractic treatment<ref name=DeVocht/> and the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care are unknown.<ref name=Leboeuf-Yde-C/> Although spinal manipulation can have serious [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] in rare cases,<ref name=Ernst-adverse/> chiropractic care is generally safe when employed skillfully and appropriately.<ref name=WHO-guidelines/>

Although a wide diversity of belief exists among chiropractors,<ref name=Keating05/> they share the principle that the [[Vertebral column|spine]] and health are related in a fundamental way, and this relationship is mediated through the nervous system.<ref>{{cite book |author= Gay RE, Nelson CF |chapter= Chiropractic philosophy |chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=altrehab.section.336 |editor= Wainapel SF, Fast A (eds.) |title= Alternative Medicine and Rehabilitation: a Guide for Practitioners |date=2003 |isbn=1-888799-66-8 |location= New York |publisher= [[Demos Medical Publishing]]}}</ref> Chiropractors pay attention to the [[biomechanics]], structure and function of the spine, its effects on the [[Nervous system|nervous]] and [[musculoskeletal system]]s, and the role these systems play in preventing disease and restoring health.<ref name=ACA-history>{{cite web |title= History of chiropractic care |author= [[American Chiropractic Association]] |accessdate=2008-02-21 |url=http://acatoday.org/level2_css.cfm?T1ID=13&T2ID=62}}</ref>

Chiropractic philosophy goes beyond manipulating the spine. Like [[naturopathy]] and several other forms of [[complementary and alternative medicine]], chiropractic assumes that all aspects of a patient's health are interconnected, which leads to the following perspectives:<ref name="Chiro Beliefs">{{cite book |chapterurl=http://chiroweb.com/archives/ahcpr/chapter2.htm |chapter= Chiropractic belief systems |author= Mootz RD, Phillips RB |date=1997 |title= Chiropractic in the United States: Training, Practice, and Research |pages=9–16 |editor= Cherkin DC, Mootz RD (eds.) |accessdate=2008-02-14 |version= AHCPR Pub No. 98-N002 |location= Rockville, MD |publisher= [[Agency for Health Care Policy and Research]] |oclc=39856366}}</ref>

*'''[[Holism]]''' treats the patient as a whole, and appreciates the multifactorial nature of influences (structural, chemical, and psychological) on the nervous system, recognizing dynamics between lifestyle, environment, and health.

*'''Conservativism''' considers the risks of clinical interventions when balancing them against their benefits. It emphasizes [[noninvasive]] treatment to minimize risk, and avoids [[surgery]] and [[medication]].<ref name=ACA-history/>

*'''[[Homeostasis]]''' emphasizes the body's inherent self-healing abilities. Chiropractic's early notion of [[innate intelligence]] can be thought of as a metaphor for homeostasis.<ref name=Keating05/>

*A '''patient-centered''' approach focuses on the patient rather than the disease, preventing unnecessary barriers in the doctor-patient encounter. The patient is considered to be indispensable in, and ultimately responsible for, the maintenance of health.<ref name=Keating05/>

Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in spiritual inspiration and [[rationalism]]. A philosophy based on deduction from irrefutable doctrine helped distinguish chiropractic from medicine, provided it with legal and political defenses against claims of practicing medicine without a license, and allowed chiropractors to establish themselves as an autonomous profession. This "straight" philosophy, taught to generations of chiropractors, rejected the inferential reasoning of the scientific method,<ref name=Keating05/> and relied on deductions from [[vitalistic]] principles rather than on the [[materialism]] of science.<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/>

As chiropractic has matured, most practitioners accept the importance of scientific research into chiropractic.<ref name=Keating05>{{cite book |author= Keating JC Jr |chapter= Philosophy in chiropractic |pages=77–98 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |date=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref> Balancing the dualism between the metaphysics of their predecessors and the materialistic reductionism of science, their belief systems blend experience, conviction, critical thinking, open-mindedness, and appreciation of the natural order. They emphasize the testable principle that structure affects function, and the untestable metaphor that life is self-sustaining. Their goal is to establish and maintain an organism-environment dynamic conducive to functional well-being of the whole person.<ref name="Chiro Beliefs"/>

Common themes to chiropractic care include holistic, conservative and non-medication approaches via [[manual therapy]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://chiroweb.com/archives/21/19/10.html |title=Surveys now and then |journal= [[Dyn Chiropr]] |volume=21 |issue=19 |author=Keating J Jr. |date=2003}}</ref> Still, significant differences exist amongst the practice styles, claims and beliefs between various chiropractors.<ref name=Healey>{{cite journal |url=http://chiroweb.com/archives/08/21/13.html |title= It's where you put the period |journal= Dyn Chiropr |volume=8 |issue=21 |author= Healey JW |date=1990}}</ref>

''Straight'' chiropractors adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by D. D. and B. J. Palmer, and retain [[metaphysical]] definitions and [[vitalistic]] qualities. Straight chiropractors believe that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an "[[Innate Intelligence]]" within the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for almost any disease. Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the "secondary effects" of subluxations) to be unnecessary for treatment. Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not "mix" other types of therapies.<ref name=History-Primer/> Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon (i.e. perform spinal analysis, detect subluxation, correct with adjustment, etc.). They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care.

''Mixer'' chiropractors "mix" diagnostic and treatment approaches from naturopathic, osteopathic, medical, and chiropractic viewpoints. Unlike straight chiropractors, mixers believe subluxation is one of the many causes of disease, and they incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ myriad treatments including joint and soft tissue manipulation, electromodalities, physiotherapeutic modalities, exercise-rehabilitation and various complementary and alternative approaches such as [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]] and [[applied kinesiology]]. Mixers tend to be open to mainstream medicine,<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg>{{cite journal |journal= [[Arch Intern Med]] |date=1998 |volume=158 |issue=20 |pages=2215–24 |title= Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions |author= Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM |pmid=9818801 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/158/20/2215 |doi= 10.1001/archinte.158.20.2215}}</ref> and are the majority group.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Cult Med Psychiatry]] |date=1985 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=353–82 |title=Adjustment, the hands and healing |author=Coulehan JL |pmid=2934224}}</ref>

=== Vertebral subluxation ===
{{main|Vertebral subluxation}}
Palmer hypothesized that vertebral joint misalignments, which he termed ''vertebral subluxations'', interfered with the body's function and its inborn (innate) ability to heal itself.<ref name=History-PPC>{{cite book |author= [[Joseph C. Keating, Jr.|Keating JC Jr]] |chapter= A brief history of the chiropractic profession |pages=23–64 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition= 3rd ed. |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref> D.D. Palmer repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone (health) of the end organ. D.D. Palmer, using a [[vitalism|vitalistic]] approach, imbued the term ''subluxation'' with a metaphysical and [[philosophical]] meaning. He qualified this by noting that knowledge of innate intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf |format=PDF |title= D.D. Palmer's forgotten theories of chiropractic |author= Keating JC Jr |publisher= [[Association for the History of Chiropractic]] |date=1995 |accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> This concept was later expanded upon by his son, B.J. Palmer and was instrumental in providing the legal basis of differentiating chiropractic medicine from conventional medicine. In 1910, D.D. Palmer theorized that the nervous system controlled health:

:"Physiologists divide nerve-fibers, which form the nerves, into two classes, afferent and efferent. Impressions are made on the peripheral afferent fiber-endings; these create sensations that are transmitted to the center of the nervous system. Efferent nerve-fibers carry impulses out from the center to their endings. Most of these go to muscles and are therefore called motor impulses; some are secretory and enter glands; a portion are inhibitory their function being to restrain secretion. Thus, nerves carry impulses outward and sensations inward. The activity of these nerves, or rather their fibers, may become excited or allayed by impingement, the result being a modification of functionality—too much or not enough action—which is disease."<ref name=Palmer1910>{{cite book |author= Palmer DD |title= The Chiropractor's Adjuster: Text-book of the Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic for Students and Practitioners |location=Portland, OR |publisher= Portland Printing House Co |date=1910 |oclc=17205743}}</ref>

The concept of subluxation remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and a debate about whether to keep it in the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades.<ref name=Keating-subluxation/> In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, [[dogmatic]] beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community.<ref name=Keating-subluxation>{{cite journal |journal= [[Chiropr Osteopat]] |date=2005 |volume=13 |pages=17 |title= Subluxation: dogma or science? |author= Keating JC Jr, Charlton KH, Grod JP, Perle SM, Sikorski D, Winterstein JF |doi=10.1186/1746-1340-13-17 |pmid=16092955 |url=http://chiroandosteo.com/content/13/1/17}}</ref> This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic (for example, [[Palmer College of Chiropractic]]<ref name=Palmer-edu>{{cite web |url=http://www.palmer.edu/general_content.aspx?id=2630 |title=Palmer College of Chiropractic, General Information |accessdate=2008-03-24}}</ref>) still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others (for example, [[Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cmcc.ca/PDF/2006/CMCC_Calendar06to07.pdf |format=PDF |title= Undergraduate and graduate programs 2006–2007 |publisher= [[Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College]] |date=2006 |accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref>) have moved towards an [[evidence-based]] chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[The Journal of Chiropractic Education]] |date=2000 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=71–7 |title=A Survey of the Use of Evidence-Based Health Care in Chiropractic College Clinics |author=Kevin A.

[[Spinal manipulation]] is the most common treatment used in chiropractic care<ref name=NBCE_techniques/> and is most frequently employed by chiropractors.<ref name=Vohra/> It is a passive manual maneuver during which a three-joint complex is taken past the normal physiological range of movement without exceeding the anatomical boundary limit; its defining factor is a dynamic thrust, a sudden force that causes an audible release and attempts to increase a joint's range of motion.<!-- <ref name=ACA-SMP/> --> More generally, [[spinal manipulative therapy]] (SMT) describes techniques where the hands are used to manipulate, massage, mobilize, adjust, stimulate, apply traction to, or otherwise influence the spine and related tissues; in chiropractic care SMT most commonly takes the form of spinal manipulation.<ref name=ACA-SMP>{{cite web |url=http://acatoday.org/pdf/spinal_manipulation_policy.pdf |format=PDF |title= Spinal manipulation policy statement |author= Winkler K, Hegetschweiler-Goertz C, Jackson PS ''et al.'' |accessdate=2008-05-24 |date=2003 |publisher= American Chiropractic Association}}</ref> The medicinal use of spinal manipulation can be traced back over 3000 years to ancient Chinese writings.

== History ==
{{main|Chiropractic history}}

[[Image:ddpalmer3.jpg|thumb|D.D. Palmer]]

Chiropractic was founded in the 1890s by [[Daniel David Palmer|Daniel David (D.D.) Palmer]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]]. Palmer, a [[Magnetic healing|magnetic healer]], hypothesized that manual manipulation of the spine could cure disease. Although initially keeping the theory a family secret, in 1898 he began teaching it to a few students at his new [[Palmer School of Chiropractic]]. One student, his son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|Bartlett Joshua (B.J.) Palmer]], became committed to promoting chiropractic, took over the Palmer School in 1906, and rapidly expanded its enrollment.<ref name=Martin>{{cite journal |journal= [[Technol Cult]] |author= Martin SC |date=1993 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=808–34 |title= Chiropractic and the social context of medical technology, 1895-1925 |doi=10.2307/3106416 |pmid=11623404}}</ref> Prosecutions and incarcerations of chiropractors for practicing medicine without a license grew common, and to defend against medical statutes B.J. argued that chiropractic was separate and distinct from medicine, asserting that chiropractors "analyzed" rather than "diagnosed", and "adjusted" subluxation rather than "treated" disease.<ref name=History-Primer/> Early chiropractors believed that all disease was caused by interruptions in the flow of [[innate intelligence]], a [[Vitalism|vital]] nervous energy or life force that represented God's presence in man; chiropractic leaders often invoked religious imagery and moral traditions. D.D. and B.J. both seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, which might have provided [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|legal protection under the U.S. constitution]], but decided against it partly to avoid confusion with [[Christian Science]].<ref name=Martin/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Religion-of-Chiro.pdf |format=PDF |author= Palmer DD |title= Letter to P.W. Johnson, D.C. |date=1911-05-04 |accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref> Early chiropractors also tapped into the [[Populism|Populist]] movement, emphasizing craft, hard work, competition, and advertisement, aligning themselves with the common man against intellectuals and [[Trust (19th century)|trusts]], among which they included the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA).<ref name=Martin/>

[[Image:BJPalmer2.jpg|thumb|left|141px|B.J. Palmer]]
Although D.D. and B.J. were "straight" and disdained the use of instruments, some early chiropractors, whom B.J. scornfully called "mixers", advocated use of instruments. In 1910 B.J. changed course and endorsed [[X-rays]] as necessary for diagnosis; this resulted in a significant exodus from the Palmer School of the more conservative faculty and students. The mixer camp grew until by 1924 B.J. estimated that only 3,000 of the U.S.'s 25,000 chiropractors remained straight.<!-- <ref name=Martin/> --> That year, B.J.'s promotion of the neurocalometer, a new temperature-sensing device, was another sign of chiropractic's gradual acceptance of medical technology, although it was highly controversial among B.J.'s fellow straights.<!-- <ref name=Martin/> --> Despite heavy opposition by organized medicine, by the 1930s chiropractic was the largest alternative healing profession in the U.S.<ref name=Martin/> The longstanding feud between chiropractors and medical doctors continued for decades. Until 1983, the AMA labeled chiropractic "an unscientific [[cult]]" and held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with an "unscientific practitioner".<ref>{{cite journal |journal= [[Am J Public Health]] |date=1989 |volume=79 |issue=11 |pages=1569–70 |title= AMA policy on chiropractic |author= Cherkin D |pmid=2817179 |pmc=1349822}}</ref> This culminated in a landmark 1987 decision, [[Wilk v. American Medical Association|''Wilk v. AMA'']], in which the court found that the AMA had engaged in unreasonable restraint of trade and conspiracy, and which ended the AMA's de facto boycott of chiropractic.<ref name=Cooper/>

Serious research to test chiropractic theories did not begin until the 1970s, and was hampered by the chiropractic philosophy that sustained the profession in its long battle with organized medicine.<!-- <ref name=History-Primer/> duplicate of next ref --> By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic, which helped efforts to improve service quality and establish clinical guidelines that recommended manual therapies for acute low back pain.<ref name=History-Primer>{{cite web |title= Chiropractic history: a primer |author= Keating JC Jr, Cleveland CS III, Menke M |url=http://data.memberclicks.com/site/ahc/ChiroHistoryPrimer.pdf |format=PDF |date=2005 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |publisher= Association for the History of Chiropractic}}</ref> In recent decades chiropractic gained legitimacy and greater acceptance by physicians and [[health plan]]s, and enjoyed a strong political base and sustained demand for services. However, its future seemed uncertain: as the number of practitioners grew, [[evidence-based medicine]] insisted on treatments with demonstrated value, [[managed care]] restricted payment, and competition grew from [[massage therapist]]s and other health professions. The profession responded by marketing natural products and devices more aggressively, and by reaching deeper into [[alternative medicine]] and [[primary care]].<ref name=Cooper>{{cite journal |journal= [[Milbank Q]] |date=2003 |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=107–38 |title= Chiropractic in the United States: trends and issues |author= Cooper RA, McKee HJ |doi=10.1111/1468-0009.00040 |pmid=12669653}}</ref>

=== Safety ===

Chiropractic care in general is safe when employed skillfully and appropriately. Manipulation is regarded as relatively safe, but as with all therapeutic interventions, complications can arise, and it has known adverse effects, risks and contraindications. <!-- <ref name=WHO-guidelines/> --> Absolute [[contraindication]]s to spinal manipulative therapy are conditions that should not be manipulated; these contraindications include [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and conditions known to result in unstable joints. Relative contraindications are conditions where increased risk is acceptable in some situations and where low-force and soft-tissue techniques are treatments of choice; these contraindications include [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=WHO-guidelines/> Although most contraindications apply only to manipulation of the affected region, some neurological signs indicate referral to [[emergency medical services]]; these include sudden and severe [[headache]] or [[neck pain]] unlike that previously experienced.<ref name=CCA-CFCREAB-CPG>{{cite journal |journal= J Can Chiropr Assoc |date=2005 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=158–209 |title= Chiropractic clinical practice guideline: evidence-based treatment of adult neck pain not due to whiplash |author= Anderson-Peacock E, Blouin JS, Bryans R ''et al.'' |url=http://www.jcca-online.org/Client/cca/jcca.nsf/objects/jcca-v49-3-158/$file/jcca-v49-3-158.pdf |format=PDF}}<br/>&nbsp;• {{cite journal |journal= J Can Chiropr Assoc |date=2008 |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=7–8 |title= A clinical practice guideline update from The CCA•CFCREAB-CPG |author= Anderson-Peacock E, Bryans B, Descarreaux M ''et al.'' |url=http://www.jcca-online.org/Client/cca/JCCA.nsf/objects/JCCA_March_2008_52_1/$file/jcca-v52-1-007.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>
