{{HurricaneIsabel}}
The '''effects of Hurricane Isabel in Maryland and Washington, D.C.''', were among the worst from a [[tropical cyclone]] in the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area]], [[United States]]. [[Hurricane Isabel]] formed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[September 6]] [[2003]], in the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters, it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165&nbsp;mph (265&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 11]]. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 18]]. It quickly weakened over land and became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] over western [[Pennsylvania]] the next day.

On [[September 19]], Tropical Storm Isabel passed through extreme western [[Maryland]], though its large circulation produced tropical storm force winds throughout the state.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven & Hugh Cobb|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2006-12-26|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003isabel.shtml}}</ref> About 1.24&nbsp;million people lost power throughout the state. The worst of its effects came from its [[storm surge]], which inundated areas along the coast and resulted in severe beach erosion. In [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Maryland]], hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed, primarily in [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland|Queen Anne's County]] from tidal flooding. Thousands of houses were affected in Central Maryland, with severe storm surge flooding reported in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]. Washington, D.C., sustained moderate damage, primarily from the winds. Throughout Maryland and Washington, damage totaled about $820&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $915&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD),<ref name="tcr"/> with only one fatality due to flooding.

While Isabel was still over the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] as a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5 hurricane]], forecasters predicted the storm would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 130&nbsp;miles (210&nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Ocean City, Maryland]] as a 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h) major hurricane.<ref name="lawrence32">{{cite web|author=Lawrence|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Discussion Thirty-Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-12-26|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al132003.discus.032.shtml?}}</ref> By four days before Isabel made landfall, most [[Global climate model|computer models]] predicted Isabel to make landfall between [[North Carolina]] and [[New Jersey]].<ref name="avila33">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Discussion Thirty-Three|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-26|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al132003.discus.033.shtml?}}</ref><ref name="archive">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Advisory Archive|accessdate=2006-12-26|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/ISABEL.shtml?}}</ref> On [[September 16]], about two days before the hurricane struck land, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] for the southern region of the Maryland coastline on the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Later that day, a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern Maryland coastline, which was upgraded to a tropical storm warning by about 24&nbsp;hours before landfall.<ref name="tcr"/>

Officials recommended the citizens on [[Smith Island, Maryland|Smith Island]] to evacuate on the day prior to the hurricane making landfall, the only evacuations for the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland]]. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for low-lying and other specific areas in [[Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert]] and [[Charles County, Maryland|Charles counties]], and the residents in six homes were asked to leave in [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]]. Officials recommended residents in flood areas of [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]] to evacuate, and some in the city of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] left spontaneously due to flooding. Evacuation rates were low throughout the Maryland coastline, with the highest rate being in the southernmost counties on the western shore. The primary reason for people staying was due to the track of the hurricane. Between 20% and 33% of those who participated in an evacuation survey said they had concerns about being caught on roadways while trying to evacuate as the storm arrived, with similar numbers expressing concern about being able to return to their homes if they evacuated. Of those who left, most went to the house of a friend or family member, with two-thirds to three-fourths going to destinations in their own neighborhood or county. Most did not evacuate until the day before or the day of landfall. In most areas, the public response to the evacuation orders was normal to fast, with traffic during the evacuation described as light to normal. The most significant problems experienced during the evacuation were downed trees, inadequate signage, flooded roads, or stalled cars. In all, 3,080&nbsp;people evacuated their homes in preparation for Hurricane Isabel.<ref name="assess">{{cite web|author=Post, Buckley, Schuh and Jernigan|year=2005|title=Hurricane Isabel Assessment, a Review of Hurricane Evacuation Study Products and Other Aspects of the National Hurricane Mitigation and Preparedness Program (NHMPP) in the Context of the Hurricane Isabel Response|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2006-12-27|url=http://www.csc.noaa.gov/hes/docs/postStorm/Isabel_PostStorm_Summary.pdf}}</ref> Boats, trucks, and school buses helped more than 1,000&nbsp;people evacuate the [[Inner Harbor]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], as well.<ref name="news">{{cite web|author=Various|year=2003|title=News Stories of Hurricane Isabel|accessdate=2007-01-24|url=http://www.greatdreams.com/isabel-2003.htm}}</ref>

==Impact==
===Eastern Shore===
[[Image:Isabel2003filledrainblk.gif|right|thumb|250px|Rainfall from Hurricane Isabel]]
In the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland]], Hurricane Isabel produced a [[storm surge]] peaking at 8&nbsp;feet (2.4&nbsp;m) on the [[Chesapeake Bay]] side in [[List of islands in Maryland|Hoopers Island]] and 6.5&nbsp;feet (2&nbsp;m) on the Atlantic coast in [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]].<ref name="wakefield">{{cite web|author=Wakefield, Virginia National Weather Service|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Prelinary Storm Report|accessdate=2006-12-27|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/akq/wx_events/hur/isabel_2003.htm}}</ref> The track of the hurricane to the west funneled into the bay and was so strong it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay. [[Kent County, Maryland|Tolchester Beach]] recorded a record-breaking [[storm tide|high tide]] of 7.91&nbsp;feet (2.4&nbsp;m) above mean low water.<ref name="esncdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for Eastern Maryland|accessdate=2006-12-27|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~504931}}</ref> Rainfall in the Maryland portion of the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] reached 3.2&nbsp;inches (81&nbsp;mm) in [[Vienna, Maryland|Steeles Neck]]. The large circulation of the hurricane produced strong winds across the area, including maximum sustained winds of 52&nbsp;mph (84&nbsp;km/h) and a gust of 66&nbsp;mph (106&nbsp;km/h) in [[Cambridge, Maryland|Cambridge]].<ref name="wakefield"/>

Tidal flooding from the storm surge forced several residents to evacuate near the bay.  Tidal flooding was reported in and around [[Rock Hall, Maryland|Rock Hall]], [[Chestertown, Maryland|Chestertown]], [[Skinners Neck, Maryland|Skinners Neck]], [[Piney Neck, Maryland|Piney Neck]], and [[Cliffs City, Maryland|Cliffs City]], and was carried along the [[Chester River]] slightly inland. The flooding destroyed or damaged over 100 homes, vehicles, and boats, and also destroyed the [[Romancoke, Maryland|Romancoke]] pier, one of the pre-[[Chesapeake Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] [[ferry]] landings which was still in use as a fishing pier at the time.  The flooding also severely damaged eleven marinas, three restaurants, four hotels, one boat-building business, and one marine railway. In [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland|Queen Anne's County]], the hurricane destroyed 37&nbsp;homes, greatly damaged 151, and moderately damaged 192, with damage totaling $37&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $40&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD). The damage was mainly due to the tidal flooding, though four homes were destroyed due to falling trees. Moderate wind gusts knocked down numerous trees, tree limbs, and power lines, leaving about 65,750&nbsp;homes and businesses without power, half of which occurred in [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]]. The resulting power outage was described as one of the worst in the history of [[Pepco Holdings|Conectiv Energy]]. Damage in the eastern shore of Maryland totaled about $50&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $55&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).<ref name="esncdc"/>

===Central Maryland===
Wind gusts in central [[Maryland]] peaked at 83&nbsp;mph (134&nbsp;km/h) in [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], with a location along the [[Patuxent River]] recording sustained winds of 55&nbsp;mph (88&nbsp;km/h). Unofficially, rainfall reached 7&nbsp;inches (178&nbsp;mm) in portions of Maryland, though the highest precipitation amount totaled 3.21&nbsp;inches (82&nbsp;mm) at the [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport|Baltimore-Washington International Airport]]. Swells from the hurricane produced high [[storm surge]]s along the [[Western Shore]] which peaked at 8.2&nbsp;feet (2.5&nbsp;m) in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] also reported a surge of 7.2&nbsp;feet (2.2&nbsp;m).<ref name="tcr"/> In many locations, the storm surge was higher than the previous record set by the [[1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane]]. Throughout central Maryland, 472&nbsp;buildings and homes were destroyed, with 3,260 greatly damaged and another 3,600 affected in general. Strong storm surge from the hurricane washed 43,000&nbsp;tons (39,000 t) of salt, millions of pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus, and millions of gallons of raw sewage into the [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref name="midncdc">{{cite web|author=NCDC|year=2003|title=Event Report for Central Maryland|accessdate=2007-01-20|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~505248}}</ref> One person died as a result of a traffic death in the state.<ref name="scot">{{cite web|author=Stuart Reid|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel claims six lives|publisher=Scotsman.com|accessdate=2007-01-24|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=980&id=1038782003}}</ref> Property damage totaled $530.5&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $581.5&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD), with an additional $190,000 (2003&nbsp;USD, $208,000 in 2006&nbsp;USD) in crop damage.<ref name="midncdc"/> The crop damage was primarily limited to minor damage to livestock buildings and sheds, though the winds destroyed a hay barn and a dairy barn at one farm in [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]]. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] estimated the winds of the hurricane destroyed 15–30% of the field corn and 10–15% of the soybean crop. Excess amounts of water led to the closure of many crab processing plants and crab house restaurants, and officials restricted harvest on shellfish for eleven days due to unsafe impurities in the water.<ref name="agri">{{cite web|author=R.D.

Most coastal areas under 10&nbsp;feet (3&nbsp;m) above sea level experienced severe wave damage.<ref name="midncdc"/> The Maryland Geological Survey estimates the waves removed 20&nbsp;acres (8&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]]) of sand along the coastline, based on an estimate of losses in [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]]. The 20&nbsp;acres of lost in single day represent about 15% of the total beach loss in an average year. The average location lost about 5&nbsp;feet (1.5&nbsp;m) of beach, and throughout the [[Chesapeake Bay]] the erosion deposited about 81,000&nbsp;tons (73,500&nbsp;t) of sediment into the bay. The erosion was irregular, however; some locations were unaffected, while others experienced greater losses, despite that the two locations were similar. The erosion and storm surge damaged many bulkheads, and after the storm surge retreated into the bay it washed away freestanding structures.<ref name=”erosion>{{cite web|author=Lamere Hennessee and Jeffrey Halka|year=2004|title=Hurricane Isabel and Shore Erosion - Chesapeake Bay, Maryland|publisher=Maryland Geological Survey|accessdate=2007-01-24|url=http://www.mgs.md.gov/coastal/pub/isabel_erosion_poster.pdf}}</ref> The passage of Isabel resulted in an unusual increase in [[phytoplankton]] in the middle portion of the Chesapeake Bay, followed by an abrupt return to normal conditions by early October.<ref name="plankton">{{cite web|author=W.

====Effects by county====
[[Image:Isab damage bridge.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Damage to the ferry bridge in Hoopersvile, MD]]
Six foot (2&nbsp;m) waves along the coastline of [[Saint Mary's County, Maryland|Saint Mary's County]], with [[Point Lookout, Maryland|Point Lookout State Park]] suffering $3&nbsp;million in damages (2003&nbsp;USD, $3.3&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD). In the county, 2,500&nbsp;wharves and piers were destroyed, with another 1,000&nbsp;moderately damaged, resulting in $10.25&nbsp;million in monetary damage (2003&nbsp;USD, $11.2&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD). The storm surge destroyed the bridge to [[Saint George Island]] by a few hours after the hurricane made landfall, and the flooding covered much of the island for a week. There, 20&nbsp;homes were destroyed. Shore [[revetment]]s experienced $53.4&nbsp;million in damage (2003&nbsp;USD, $62.5&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD). Throughout Saint Mary's County, residential damage amounted to about $17&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $18.6&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD) with about $1.5&nbsp;million to commercial buildings (2003&nbsp;USD, $1.6&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD). The damage was caused primarily by the storm surge, though the winds produced minor to moderate damage, the worst effects in the state from winds. In the county, the winds blew off the roof of a home and downed 70&nbsp;trees, leaving 27,092 without power.<ref name="midncdc"/>

In [[Charles County, Maryland|Charles County]], the passage of the hurricane resulted in about $2&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $2.2&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD) in damage to roads. Two homes were destroyed with several others damaged on [[Cobb Island, Maryland|Cobb Island]]. Elsewhere in the county, [[Chigger City, Maryland|Chigger City]], [[Port Tobacco, Maryland|Port Tobacco]], [[Woodland Point, Maryland|Woodland Point]], [[Swan Point, Maryland|Swan Point]], and [[Morgantown, Maryland|Morgantown]] also reported damage from Hurricane Isabel, with 52&nbsp;houses damaged<ref name="midncdc"/> and eight homes destroyed or severely damaged. Seven businesses were also destroyed or greatly damaged. Many piers along the shore were damaged or lost, and two private community wells were contaminated.<ref name="char">{{cite web|author=Charles County Government|year=2003|title=Newsletter for November, 2003|accessdate=2007-01-24|url=http://www.charlescounty.org/pgm/planning/publications/demotrends/vol7_4.pdf}}</ref> The winds downed several trees and power lines, leaving about 32,000 people without power. Residential damage totaled $1.1&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $1.2&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD), with another $600,000 (2003&nbsp;USD, $658,000 in 2006&nbsp;USD) to commercial buildings.<ref name="midncdc"/>

Four to five&nbsp;foot (1.2 to 1.5&nbsp;m) waves hit the eastern portion of [[Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert County]], causing a home to be knocked off its foundation in [[North Beach, Maryland|North Beach]]. The storm surge destroyed the pier and greatly damaged buildings along the shoreline at [[Solomons, Maryland|Solomons Island]]. Power was lost to 22,400&nbsp;residents as a result of the passage of the hurricane.<ref name="midncdc"/>

The storm surge produced higher than usual tides in along the [[Patuxent River|Patuxent]], [[Potomac River|Potomac]], and [[Anacostia River]] coastlines. Much of the shoreline of [[Prince Georges County, Maryland|Prince Georges County]] possessed adequate rise of terrain to prevent significant flooding, though the high waters closed three roads where the shoreline was not high enough. The passage of the hurricane created about 5,000&nbsp;tons (4,500&nbsp;t) of debris to be removed. Fifteen buildings sustained major damage, with another 53&nbsp;buildings affected to some degree. Nearly 200,000 residents in the county lost power.<ref name="midncdc"/> When two of the largest sewage treatment plants in the state lost power, 96&nbsp;million gallons (365,000&nbsp;m³) of hazardous sewage overflowed to mix with storm water into two waterways in the county. The wastewater combined with rainwater, making it less threatening. No humans or animals were known to have become sick due to the overflows.<ref name="pgc">{{cite web|author=Dan Wilcock|year=2003|title=WSSC to Install Generators After Huge Sewage Overflows in Prince George's|publisher=Capital News Service|accessdate=2007-01-24|url=http://www.journalism.umd.edu/cns/wire/2003-editions/12-December-editions/031222-Monday/PGPollution_CNS-UMCP.html}}</ref>

In [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] in [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]], the storm surge surrounded many of the buildings at the [[United States Naval Academy]], resulting in about $116&nbsp;million in damage (2003&nbsp;USD, $127&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).<ref name="midncdc"/> The Annapolis Maritime Museum suffered severe damage as well, though volunteers moved artifacts to a safer location. There, the storm surge flooded the building in 6&nbsp;feet (1.8&nbsp;m) of water, causing great damage to the floor, drywall, and electricity.<ref name="ama">{{cite web|author=Elvia H. Thompson|year=2003|title=The Unsinkable Maritime Museum|publisher=Annapolis Maritime Museum|accessdate=2007-01-24|url=http://www.annapolismaritimemuseum.org/isabel.htm}}</ref> About 93% of the 211,000 power customers in the county were left without electricity after the storm. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] estimated a damage total of up to $500&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $548&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD) in the county.<ref name="midncdc"/>

[[Image:Hurricane Isabel flood damage Maryland.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Storm surge flooding caused by Isabel in [[Bowleys Quarters, Maryland]]]]
Moderate wave action produced severe beach erosion along the shore of [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]] at a loss of $3&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $3.3&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD). Residential areas of [[Millers Island, Maryland|Millers Island]], [[Edgemere, Maryland|Edgemere]], [[North Point, Maryland|North Point]], [[Bowleys Quarters, Maryland|Bowleys Quarters]] and [[Turners Station, Maryland|Turners Station]] suffered severe damage from the hurricane, with over 400&nbsp;people needing to be rescued. Over 300&nbsp;buildings were destroyed. The storm surge flooding killed a man in [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]], and either destroyed or greatly damaged most marinas. Strong winds downed 118&nbsp;trees on school grounds and hundreds of others elsewhere, some of which fell on power lines which resulted in leaving 220,000&nbsp;customers without power. The passage of Hurricane Isabel left 3,189&nbsp;tons (2,893&nbsp;t) of debris across the county.<ref name="midncdc"/>

The storm surge flooded [[Fells Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]] and the [[Inner Harbor]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], causing millions of dollars of damage to waterfront properties.<ref name="midncdc"/> As the Inner Harbor began to flood, boat owners helped evacuate 35&nbsp;people in flooded homes. Winds from Isabel destroyed at least three buildings in the city.<ref name="news"/> The [[Baltimore Museum of Industry]] alone suffered $1.5&nbsp;million in damage (2003&nbsp;USD, $1.6&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD). 70,000 were left without power in the city.<ref name="midncdc"/>

In [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]], high waves and the storm surge caused moderate flooding in areas, forcing 55 to evacuate along the [[Bush River]] and 12 to evacuate along the waterfront to [[Havre de Grace]]. The promenade boardwalk in Havre de Grace was destroyed. Moderate winds left 51,600&nbsp;residents in the county without power. Damage in the county totaled at least $12.5&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $13.7&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).<ref name="midncdc"/>

===Western Maryland===
The center of Tropical Storm Isabel passed over [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]] on [[September 19]], with its unusually large and powerful wind field producing 50 to 60&nbsp;mph (80 to 95&nbsp;km/h) wind gusts across western Maryland. Some [[rainband]]s produced up to 70&nbsp;mph gusts (113&nbsp;km/h), and in some areas isolated streaks of damage were described as being caused by tornadoes. Rainfall varied between 2 to 4&nbsp;inches (50 to 100&nbsp;mm) across the area, resulting in the [[Potomac River]] overflowing its banks. At [[Point of Rocks, Maryland|Point of Rocks]], the river crested at 23.12&nbsp;feet (7&nbsp;m), 7.12&nbsp;feet (2.2&nbsp;m) above [[flood stage]]. Moderate flooding occurred there, and minor flooding occurred in [[Paw Paw, West Virginia]] where the river crested at 2.91&nbsp;feet (0.9&nbsp;m). The flooding closed a portion of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]].<ref name="wmdncdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for Western Maryland|accessdate=2006-12-28|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~504928}}</ref>

The gusty winds from the passage of the hurricane resulted in widespread and extensive tree damage. Due to previous rainfall, moist grounds easily allowed for trees to be uprooted. Wind damage to structures was minor, however, with one house in [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll County]] being damaged when a tree fell on it. Trees fell onto cars, roads, homes, and power lines, leaving 358,000 without power after the storm. 600&nbsp;traffic signals were without power in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], and about 70&nbsp;roads were closed due to fallen trees. Isabel destroyed 94&nbsp;buildings and damaged 87, including 33&nbsp;homes, six of which were severely impacted with one losing a portion of its roof. Fallen trees injured two in [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]]. In western Maryland, damage totaled $2.07&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $2.27&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).<ref name="wmdncdc"/>

===Washington, D.C.===
[[Image:Washington D.C. Damage (Isabel).jpg|right|thumb|250px|Tree and power line damage in Washington, D.C.]]
In [[Washington, D.C.]], sustained winds remained below tropical storm force, though gusts reached 71&nbsp;mph (114&nbsp;km/h) as recorded by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Science]].<ref name="tcr"/> Hurricane force winds existed several hundred feet in the air, with wind sensors on the top of tall buildings recording winds of 70 to 85&nbsp;mph (115 to 135&nbsp;km/h). Rainfall was minimal, amounting to around two inches across the district. A gauge on [[Wisconsin Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Wisconsin Avenue]] recorded a storm surge of 11.3&nbsp;feet (3.4&nbsp;m), and a gauge on a pier in the southwest portion of the district recorded a storm surge of 10.25&nbsp;feet (3.1&nbsp;m). Both observations were records, surpassing the previous observation set by the [[1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane]].<ref name="dcncdc"/>

Moderate winds blew down about 1,600&nbsp;trees in the district,<ref name="femtre">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2003|title=Trees Bear The Brunt Of Hurricane Isabel's Winds|accessdate=2007-01-24|url=https://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=6635}}</ref> 23 of which fell onto houses.

The strong winds and storm surge of the hurricane dislodged and damaged a large number of home heating oil tanks, releasing thousands of gallons of oil onto yards and into the environment. The Maryland Department of the Environment and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] worked together to recover more than 50,000&nbsp;gallons (189,000&nbsp;l) of oil from the tanks. Five hundred properties were contaminated by the oil, causing the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] to provide 75% of the funding for cleaning the properties, with the government of Maryland providing for the remainder of the cost.<ref name="mde1">{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Welsh, Dyer Bell, Jim Pettit, and Quentin Banks|year=2003|title=Maryland Acts to Remove Contaminated Soil in the Aftermath Of Hurricane Isabel|publisher=Maryland Department of the Environment|accessdate=2007-01-24|url=http://www.mde.state.md.us/PressReleases/565.html}}</ref>
