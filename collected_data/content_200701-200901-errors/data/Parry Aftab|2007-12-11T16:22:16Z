'''Parry Aftab''' is a [[lawyer]] specializing in Internet privacy and security law, and is the Executive Director of WiredSafety.org, a volunteer organization dedicated to online safety. Aftab shut down her law practice in 2000 and now only takes a limited number of consulting cases a year. She was featured in [[Chris Hansen]]'s book, ''To Catch a Predator'' as one of two advocates in the area of online safety, in his chapter "The Tale of Two Advocates". In this chapter, Hansen highlights the reasons Parry gave up her law firm and donates her time running WiredSafety.org (an all-volunteer organization, including Parry). The first was the result of her having encountered an online image of a toddler being sexually molested. The second was because she recognized that "all children can walk, talk and see" online.(see Hansen's book.)

Parry began working in the area of online safety in 1997, after appearing on CNN and other shows defending the Internet from regulations designed to censor it. Her work quickly expanded to helping educators <ref name="teachers">http://www.teachers.net/releases/aftab.html</ref>

Aftab was involved in a dispute surrounding the domain [[katie.com]] in 2004. In 2000, [[Penguin Group|Penguin Putnam]] had planned to release a book titled ''Katie.com''; the domain was owned by [[Katie Jones (web entrepreneur)|Katie Jones]], which resulted in a dispute between her and the publisher.<ref name = "penguin">{{cite news

Four years later, Aftab contacted Jones and, in an effort to address concerns relating to young people visiting Jones' site, thinking it was the official book site, asked Jones to consider either donating the site or redirecting traffic from the young readers to the official site. When Jones refused, Aftab accused her of having a hidden agenda, which Jones considered to be cyberbullying in itself.<ref name = "host">{{cite news

In an interview, Jones stated that she was being emotionally blackmailed and that Aftab told her that "things would only get worse [for Jones]" if she did not hand over the domain.<ref name = "interview">{{cite web
