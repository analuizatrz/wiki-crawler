'''John F. Babcock''' (born [[July 23]], [[1900]]) is the only known surviving veteran of the [[Canada|Canadian]] military to have served in [[World War I|the First World War]].  

Babcock was born in [[Ontario]], and he was 15 when he joined the 146th Battalion of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]]. A few months later, he arrived in [[England]]. John was transferred to reserve battalions, and in August 1917 he ended up with the Boys' Battalion (also known as the "Young Soldiers' Battalion"), waiting until he was old enough to go to the front lines. Before he could leave for the front, the war ended. 

Babcock emigrated to the [[United States|US]] in the [[1920s]], and served briefly in the [[United States Army]] as well. He currently lives with his wife Dorothy in [[Spokane, Washington]] at the age of 106. [http://kxly.com/news/?sect_ranks=26&section_id.=560&story_id=10901]

Following the death of fellow Canadian veteran [[Dwight Wilson]] on [[May 9]], [[2007]], Babcock became the sole remaining Canadian Veteran of the First World War, and is entitled to a State Funeral when he dies, in honour of the 600,000 Canadians who fought during the war.
