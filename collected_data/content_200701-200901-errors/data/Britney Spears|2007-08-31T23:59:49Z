November 2003 saw the release of Spears's fourth studio album, 
''[[In the Zone]]'', jettisoning the [[Max Martin]]-produced [[synthpop]] of her earlier releases. The album took in lesser-known producers such as [[Christopher Stewart (music producer)|RedZone]] and big names including [[Moby]] and [[R. Kelly]]. Spears co-wrote eight of the album's thirteen songs and co-produced several pieces of her material for the first time. ''In the Zone'' topped the U.S. charts in its debut week, selling over 609,000 copies.

[[Stylus Magazine]] gave the album a D and even blamed Spears' career choices by stating, "Ultimately, ''In the Zone'' suffers greatly from Britney's uneasy transition from teen tart to sexually powerful woman.
