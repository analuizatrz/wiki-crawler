==Shuichi Minamino and Youko Kurama==

Shuichi and Yoko may share a body, but they are two different beings. Yoko existed in the past and was reborn when Shiori gave birth to him after he was severely wounded by a hunter in the Demon World and escaped in the Human World.

==Youko Kurama==
 
Yoko Kurama (妖狐 蔵馬 ''Yōko Kurama'', literally "Spirit Fox Kurama") was a Demon Thief and was known as the King of Thieves. Yoko has been noted to have lived for over 1,000 years and has gained much wisdom. As his alias tells implies, Yoko was a great thief and thus,a large bounty had been placed on his head. On one of his thieving expeditions, however, Yoko was attacked by a bounty hunter and nearly killed. 

Attacked by the enemies, Yoko was badly injured and escaped to Ningenkai, in the Human World. There, Yoko's spirit nestled into a woman's unborn child; the woman was named Shiori. As the child developed over time, and eventually was born, Yoko began to regain some of his strength. No real separation of the two personalities occurred to him until years later. 

When Yoko became conscious of his state, he planned to leave Ningenkai and Shiori, and return to Makai once he became strong enough; he estimated that he would be ten years old by then. Yoko waited for his chance. This is the point where his personality began to change. He received so much love and care from his human mother that he began changing into a very kind, gentle, and noble young boy. He was still able to turn into his demon form in cases of extreme anger or other emotions; his personality did not change in the process.

When Kurama was younger, he was standing on a stool to reach a high shelf when he accidentally dropped some of the glass dish ware. He slipped and fell off the stool, headed for the broken glassware. Shiori was able to get her arms under little Kurama in time to save him from the broken glass, but she herself fell onto the glass. Her arms were slashed by the glass in result. 

Guilt engulfed Kurama when he thought of all the pain he had caused Shiori while growing up. He vowed to protect and care for Shiori, but ultimately still wanted to be free of Ningenkai. Years passed, and Kurama realized that he actually loved his human mother like every other little boy. Ten years passed since his birth, and Kurama found that he was unable to leave Shiori; he loved her too much to just leave her, and the day of that incident was still fresh in his mind. Ten years came and went, and still he did not leave.

===In the Past===

Yoko was, and still is, extremely wise and intelligent. He is over 1,000 years old, and retains all that he has learned in that time. He still continues to gain more knowledge. (Foxes are also symbols of wisdom in Japan)   

Yoko Kurama was a cold hearted and ruthless [[Kitsune]] thief and the most feared bandit in Makai (Demon World), but was not without any care whatsoever. In [[Yu Yu Hakusho: Poltergeist Report]], it is revealed that during Yoko's previous life in Makai, he had an old friend and partner named Kuronue. Kuronue was Yoko's right hand man and went with Yoko on many of his thieving expeditions. 

However, on one of these expeditions, Yoko and Kuronue robbed a house that, unbeknownst to them, was filled with traps. Kuronue sacrificed his life when he attempted to recover a pendant that was precious to him. He then ordered Yoko to flee, before he too was killed. 

One of the Netherworld Gods impersonated Kuronue and accused Kurama that he had betrayed him. During their second encounter, Kurama knew that this Kuronue was a fake, because the fake threw the pendant that was precious to Kuronue and attacked Kurama from behind; both things the real Kuronue never did. Kurama was able to use part of a [[bamboo]] plant to kill the fake Kuronue in the same way his friend died.

==Additional Information==

Kurama is sometimes portrayed as a vain character, but throughout the series he is humble about his own beauty. The only vanity he has ever been noted as showing in the series is of his own strength. In the Dark Tournament after the fight against Urashima and his transformation back to his demon form, he shows a bit of vanity while deciding who would take the next fight. He tells Hiei and Kuwabara he wants to take the fight against Shishiwakamaru, but all of them want to fight against him. So, they decide it with a game of [[janken]]. In the scene where Kurama meets Karasu and Bui in the corridor, the bomb demon Karasu points out that Kurama doesn't take care of his hair, though it seems Kurama doesn't care about his appearance. He also shows no reaction when girls at school speak of about how little he cares about having the highest marks in the exams, and shows himself to be relaxed and uninterested on the subject.

It is implied that he behaves differently from the other teenagers. He shows serenity and calmness on romantic subjects when his peers are often flustered and emotional about the same issues. Much of the series he behaves like a calm adult surrounded by kids, which may influence his preference to be around youkai as opposed to humans of his own physical age.

Much of Kurama's wit and wisdom comes from Youko Kurama. Although Kurama is a brilliant strategist, he has a "bad habit", received from Youko, of playing around during a fight while devising a strategy to use against his opponent after studying their nature, and has also on a few occasions underestimated his opponent as well. 

Youko Kurama had reached the level of an A-class apparition in his previous life, but when he was attacked by the bounty hunter that nearly killed him and forced him to Human World, he lost almost all of his energy. Kurama stunningly transforms back to Youko the following three times during the series: 

The first time is during the battle with Uraurashima when the Reverse Magic Box, meant to send him back to embryonic state. It actually forces him back into his previous form, Youko Kurama, King of Thieves. He is then essentially the Youko he once was in mind, body, and soul. When Shishiwakamaru breaks the barrier keeping in the magic from the Box, he transforms back into Shuichi. 

The second time is during the finals of the Dark Tournament when he takes the potion made from the Fruit of the Past Life (Debatably from either Spirit World or Demon World, depending on the English or Japanese version). This sent him back again into his pre-human state and gave him nearly the full strength he had before the incident that sent him to the human world. Once again he is Youko through and through, the arrogance of the Spirit Fox in full play, when it only peeps out occasionally with Shuichi. 

The third time he transforms is during the Sensui Seven arc when Yusuke takes a fatal hit on purpose. Yusuke dies to evoke the emotional power needed for Kuwabara to call upon his Dimension Sword and rescue himself, Hiei and Kurama from Itsuki's Dimensional Trap and give them the boost they would need to stand a chance against Sensui and close the gate between the Human World and Demon World. During the battle with Sensui, his anger over the death of Yusuke propels him once again to A-class levels, transforming his body to that of his former self in the process. When he transforms, he gains all the powers endowed to Youko Kurama, but retains the mind of Kurama, the human/demon hybrid. 

He transforms several other times during that last arc of the series "Three Kings" in which he works with Lord Yomi for a brief time until Yusuke, risen from the dead as a half-demon, shakes things up. At this point, Youko is close to the surface of Shuichi's mind, where he is usually more of a pseudo-personality rather than a driving force. He seems to want to live the life he lost when the bounty hunter shot him, so in moments of duress or battle, Shuichi or Kurama (who retained the A-class powers after Sensui was defeated), would transform into Youko Kurama and his ruthless personality would return( now at the level of an S-class). Finally, after the new Lord of Demon World is selected via a Yusuke-instituted tournament, Kurama makes the choice to not transform again into Youko and live in Human World.

==History==

When Kurama turned fifteen, he was already extremely educated and powerful for a human, very mature, and spoke with sophistication and a wide vocabulary, all thanks to Youko inside. When his mother, Shiori, falls fatally ill, Kurama teams up with Hiei and Gouki (a demon who likes to eat the spirits of others, especially children) to steal the three Spirit World artifacts. With Kurama's/Youko's excellent mind, the three succeed. Kurama, still acting partially with Youko's mind, though there is a somewhat conscious separation between the two persona, takes the Forlorn Hope for himself. This magical mirror will grant any wish in exchange for the user's life.

Yusuke is sent after the three thieves to retrieve the artifacts. Upon meeting Kurama, Yusuke finds out that Kurama has no intention of destroying the world with the Forlorn Hope, but only wishes to use its power to save his mother from death. Kurama, although knowing the price for his wish, does not seem to hesitate one second when activating the Forlorn Hope. As the mirror begins to take his life in return for sparing his mother's, Yusuke also jumps in, exclaiming that he knew what it was like to see a mother crying for her dead son and does not wish to witness an event such as that again. Much to Kurama's surprise and horror, Yusuke offers his own life to be taken instead, so that Kurama can live with his mother peacefully and happily.

Through the selflessness shown by both boys, the Forlorn Hope decides not to take either life, and still grants Kurama's wish. (This is what happens in the English Anime and varies slightly from the English manga version where Yusuke splits the difference between him and Kurama so neither will die and Shiori will still live.) After that, Kurama along with Hiei are forced to join Yusuke and Kuwabara on Yusuke's third case and Team Urameshi is formed. 

During the Dark Tournament saga, Kurama first faced Roto, from Team Rokuyokai, who threatened to end the life of his human mother if Kurama attacked. To defeat this opponent Kurama planted a Death Seed on Roto's body without him noticing and killed him with it. Kurama then faced Gama and Touya, of Team Masho. Gama magically chained Kurama's arms and legs, making him unable to move and then attacked him, but at the last moment Kurama was able to use his Rose Whip to finish Gama. Before dying, Gama sealed Kurama's youki (demon energy) within his body. Then Kurama fought Touya and because Gama's spells were still in effect, Kurama was forced to plant a Death Seed into his own body in order to access its power to defeat his opponent. After that Kurama became completely unconscious, but he had fainted while he was still standing, and was forced to face a third opponent named Bakken. Bakken inflicted heavy blows on Kurama, nearly killing him. He was stopped by Yusuke, who was ready to shoot Bakken with his spirit gun, and his boss, who ordered him to stop. His boss pointed out that if he continued, Yusuke would kill him. Instead of finishing Kurama, he knocked him out of the ring, and prepared for a fight with Yusuke.

Later in the tournament, when fighting Uraurashima, Kurama was turned into his fox form with The Reverse Treasure Box (Reverse Magic Box in English Manga) (Idun Box in the English Dub). Originally it was supposed to turn Kurama into a baby, but instead transformed him into Youko Kurama.

The last opponent Kurama faces in this tournament is Karasu. Karasu has a strange crush on Kurama, and because of that, wants to kill him. (He says that taking away the things he likes gives him a thrill like pondering unanswerable questions.) Kurama becomes desperate to know what caused his transformation into Yoko Kurama during his fight with Uraurashima, because he knows that he cannot defeat Karasu while in his human form. Suzuki gives Kurama the potion that he used to make the Idun Box, telling him he is unsure of its effects in this concentrated form. After testing it, Kurama finds out that it will make him transform into Youko, but only for fifteen minutes. 

Kurama takes some of the potion before his battle with Karasu, but its effect does not take place right away, and Kurama is badly injured. Finally, just before Karasu inflicts a lethal blow on Kurama, the transformation happens. Yoko is able to trap Karasu in his Ojigi Plant, and believes to have defeated him. But Karasu is still alive. Unfortunately for Kurama, the effects of the potion wear off before the fifteen minutes are up. After being almost blown to bits, Kurama decides to sacrifice himself to kill Karasu. As he releases a blood sucking plant on Karasu, he gives the last of his life energy and, therefore, intends to die. Surpisingly, Kurama does not die. He realizes that each time he takes the potion, the effect does not last as long because he gains some of his demon strength back, enabling him to survive. After this fight Kurama only needs to feel extreme emotions such as hatred or anger to revert back to Youko Kurama.

During the Chapter Black saga, after Yusuke was kidnapped, Kurama fought against Yuu Kaito, a fellow student from the same private school that he attended in a word game. After Kurama's suspicions confirmed that Genkai was behind the kidnapping, Kaito revealed that although he agreed to Genkai's plan, he went after Kurama seriously to prove that just once he could beat Kurama at his own game. Kurama then fought against Shinobu Sensui (Dark Angel) and his six companions alongside Yusuke, Hiei, Kuwabara, Genkai, and his other friends. He encountered Tsukihito Amanuma (Game Master) and was forced to kill him during a video game competition. After that, he fought Sadao Makihara (Gourmet), cutting his head off tp confirm that Elder Toguro was controlling his body. Kurama defeats Toguro by trapping him in one of his plants for eternity.

Shiori Minamino is later re-married to Hatanaka, the president at a company where Shiori works, after the events of the Chapter Black Saga. Kurama also gains a new stepbrother, coincidentally named '''Shuichi''' (whose name was changed to '''Kokota''' in the English Dub).

During the Three Kings saga, Kurama is forced to re-live his past as he's called to Yomi's side. Yomi is Yoko Kurama's old partner-in-crime. A thousand years ago, Yomi was sent on a raid, but it was a set-up. Yoko had arranged for an assassin to kill Yomi. "Life is greater than the reward," were the only things the assassin spoke during the fight. In the fight, the assassin makes Yomi blind instead of killing him. Meeting again after a thousand years, Kurama is forced to advise Yomi, who has threatened to kill his mother and step-father. Kurama predicts that in half a year, every second in command in the three realms will have been replaced. Promising to return with strong fighters, Kurama returns to the Human World and calls for a group of old friends and former opponents from the Dark Tournament; Rinku, Chu, Jin, Touya, Shishiwakamaru and Suzuki. They train under Genkai in her temple and become a very strong team, even stronger than Yomi's entire army. Kurama then brings his new team to Yomi. Yomi is so impressed that he removes his second in command and appoints Kurama instead. Enraged by this, he attacks Kurama and tries to kill him. In response, Kurama turns into Youko and kills the former general with ease. 

After the death of Raizen, Yusuke comes to Yomi's territory with a proposition; a new tournament which will determine the ruler of whole Makai. Yomi accepts and the tournament begins. Kurama's team qualifies easily in the preliminary round but after that the team faces stronger opponents and each member is defeated one by one. Then, Kurama fights Shigure, "The Demon Surgeon." During a fierce battle he manages to defeat Shigure and destroy his Ring Sword. Unable to accept this, Shigure commits suicide. Kurama is qualified to the next round but is unable to continue fighting due to severe injuries.

Kurama's internal struggles become more apparent during this part of the series. He holds three personalities: Kurama (with Yusuke and the others), Youko Kurama, and Shuichi Minamino. He is now forced to choose which one he will remain as. After his fight with Shigure, he decides to give up his Yoko side and live as Shuichi Minamino from now on. With loyalty to his human mother and support of his friends, he is able to make the choice to stop living a lie. After the end of the Demon Tournament, Kurama goes back to the Human World and gets a job at his stepfather's company. He lives like a normal human being from then on alongside Yusuke, Kuwabara, and his other friends.

==Attacks==
Kurama's special ability is that he can turn plants into deadly weapons by manipulating his youki into that plant. Kurama has complete control over any Human Realm plant and has some control over Demon Realm plants. However Yoko Kurama has complete control over Demon Realm Plants and has more power than regular Kurama. The strength of Kurama's moves depends on how much youki Kurama uses. This is a list of Kurama's known moves from the show.

* '''Rose Whip/Bara Shibenjin''' (ローズ ワップ/薔薇棘鞭刃 ''Rose Thorny Whip-blade''): With this technique, Kurama uses his yōki to grow a rose from its seed state to its flowering state and then into a long thorny whip. With Kurama's skill the Rose Whip is truly a deadly weapon. The Rose Whip is so deadly it can cut even through steel. This weapon was first introduced during Kurama's battle against Genbu of the Four Beasts. This is Kurama's most common weapon.

** '''Kagon Retsuzanshi''' (華厳裂斬枝 ''Splendid Limb-Severing'') or '''Rose Whiplash''' in the English Dub. Kurama uses this technique against Genbu of the Four Beasts, severely slashing in multiple directions with his whip to break apart Genbu's body. This is his primary attack with his whip, particularly when he's going in for the kill.

** '''Fūka Enbu Jin''' in the Japanese version, ''''Rose Whip Thorn Wheel''' in the English Dub, or '''Petal Whirlwind''' in the English Manga. This is an offensive move, using the petals of a single flower, which looks somewhat like a carnation, as flying kunai and ripping the opponents to shreads. There is also the '''"Wind Petal Waltz Configuration"''' or '''"Petals and Thorns"''' in the English dub. This is a defensive technique seen when Kurama fights against Karasu. Kurama uses it to buy time before he transforms into Youko Kurama under the effect of the potion he took. It is essentially a whirlwind of rose petals hovering around him and if the opponent/attacker gets within a certain range the petals attack and rip them to shreds. 

* '''Shimaneki Sō''' (死招き草 ''Deathbringer Weed'') or '''Seed of the Death Plant''' in the English Dub. This is a small seed which once planted on his opponent's body, Kurama can manipulate his youki and after it had enough time to take root the Shimaneki can kill the victim. This attack was only used in the Dark Tournament Saga and was first used against Roto of the Jolly Devil Six/Team Rokuyukai who threatened to kill Kurama's human mother Shiori with a messenger Youkai if he attacked him. Kurama was skillfully able to plant the Shimaneki on Roto and fought Roto long enough for the seed to take root. During his match against [[Toya (YuYu Hakusho)|Toya]] (Touya) of the Team Mashotsukai/Team Masho/Shadow Channelers with his youki sealed away from a curse brought on from his previous match Kurama was forced to place the seed in his body to use the youki in his body and was able to use the Shimaneki as a sword-like weapon to render Touya unconscious.

* '''Shoku Yō Shokubutsu''' (食妖植物 ''Devourer Demon Plant'') or '''Death Tree''' in the English Dub: Used by Youko Kurama during his match against Reverse Urashima/Ura Urashima of Team Uratogi/Fractured Fairy Tales in the Dark Tournament. This is a giant redwood carnivorous tree with an acidic saliva that strikes anything that moves. Youko Kurama used this to force Ura to tell him the secret of the Reverse Treasure Box. This would have worked if Ura hadn't been killed by his teammate Shishiwakamaru for trying to give away their secrets.

* '''Makai Ojigi Sō''' (魔界オジギ草 ''Demon Realm Bow Weed'') or '''Ojigi Plant''' in the English Dub: Used during his match against Karasu this is where Youko Kurama was able to use this plant to counter Karasu's bombs. This deadly plant is from South America where it responds to movements or flammables by closing its leaves around its prey and crushes it to death. Although this plant managed to bind Karasu, he was able to create an explosion from within destroying this plant.

* '''Kyūketsu Shokubutsu''' (吸血植物 ''Bloodsucking Plant'')("Vampire Plant in VIZ Media Dub"): A blood sucking Demon Realm plant that also was used against Karasu in the Team Toguro Match. When Youko Kurama reverted back to Kurama and with his youki running low, Kurama deliberately placed a Shimaneki seed on Karasu's chest knowing that he would find it so it would expose his blood. Kurama intended to sacrifice himself in this kamikaze attack to kill Karasu who thought that Kurama could only control Human Realm plants. Kurama was narrowly able to survive by using this technique.

* '''Janenju''' (邪念樹 ''Tree of Depravity'') or '''Sinning Tree''' in the English Dub: This plant was used by Kurama in the Chapter Black Saga in the fight against Gourmet aka Sadao Makihara. Knowing that Elder Toguro was now in control of Gourmet's body, Kurama placed this seed on his Rose Whip, which was planted on Gourmet's body when Kurama Decapitated him. The tree would send its victim their worst fears until they die, but since Elder Toguro was incapable of dying, it would prey on him forever.

* '''Juryō Yōzan Ken''' (樹霊妖斬拳 ''Wood Spirit Demon Beheading Technique'') or '''The Binding Fist of the Demonic Vine''' in the English Dub: Used by Youko Kurama during his battle against Shinobu Sensui. This is where by growing the Rose Whip around his arm, Youko Kurama can use the vines as a sword-based weapon.

* '''Okunenju Ueki''' (''Okunenju Trees'') or '''Okunenju Roots''' in the English Dub: Used during Kurama's battle against Shigure in the Three Kings Saga to show that using Youko Kurama was not his ace card. Kurama is able to grow this tree in order to surround the fighting arena and the roots were able to render Shigure's ring sword useless.

*'''Bamboo Plant''': Not officially named, this plant was used in Yu Yu Hakusho: Poltergeist Report to kill a Netherworld God that had impersonated Kuronue, an old friend of Yoko Kurama.

===Other Plants===
Other than the plants that Kurama regularly uses, there are some plants that he uses in special cases.

* '''Akaru Zassou''' (''Akaru Weed'') or '''Lamp Weed''' in the English Dub: These weeds were used as markers by Kurama to help identify their way for traveling the maze-like Irma Cave (Demon Door's Cave in the English Dub) in the Chapter Black Saga. Kurama planted a few of these just before their encounter with Game master aka Tsukihito Amanuma. Koenma was later able to use these to help him move in the cave for the part of the way when he was one his way to join up with the others to see Sensui.  

* '''Fuyouka no Makai Shokubutsu''' (浮葉科の魔界植物 ''Floating Leaves from Demon Realm Plant'') or '''Leaf of a Plant''' in the English Dub: doubling as a glider, this plant is where Youko Kurama placed this on his back to sprout Butterfly Wings to help him, Hiei and Kuwabara, level their descent after falling in midair from the portal to Makai (Demon World) during their pursuit of Sensui to avenge Yusuke Urameshi's death.

==Trivia==
*Kurama's name in the [[Philippines]] dub is Dennis. Filipino dubbers originally mistook him for a girl, and dubbed her as a woman named "Denise", with an unmistakable female voice. Upon discovering this mistake, "Denise" became "Dennis" during the events of the Suzaku mission, his voice changing from a woman's to that of a man's. Lines were then added to the series' dialogue by the dubbers, explaining that Kurama only pretends to be a girl when in the human world. Later episodes however, show Kurama being voiced as a male despite being in the human world. 
*Like [[Hiei (YuYu Hakusho)|Hiei]], Kurama's name comes from the [[Mount Kurama]], in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. It is the location of a famous [[Buddhist]] temple. [[Mt. Hiei]] stands right beside it.
*Kurama's human name translates in two parts: the given (Shūichi) means "excellence first", while the surname (Minamino) means "Southern Field" and is also the name of a famous Japanese warrior. To this day, the surname is only allowed to families of nobility or higher social standing.
*Kurama is the name of a rural town in the northern mountains of Kyoto City, less than one hour from the city center. Kurama town is best known for its temple Kurama-dera and its hot spring, one of the most easily accessible hot springs from Kyoto. 
*Kurama's image songs:
**"Kurayami ni Akai Bara" (Soldier of Love) 
**"Kyou no Sayonara wa Mirai no Hajimari" (Today's Goodbye is the Start of Tomorrow) 
**"Nightmare"  
**"Koori no Naifu wo Daite" (Embracing the Ice Knife) 
*Kurama's group/duet songs:
**"Mienai Mirai" - Kurama, Yusuke, Hiei, Kuwabara, Yukina, Keiko, Botan, and Koenma
**"Yasei no Kaze no Youni" (Wild Wind) - Hiei and Kurama
**"Yasashisa Wa Nemuranai" - Kurama, Yusuke, Hiei, and Kuwabara
**"EYE TO EYE" - Kurama, Hiei, and Kuwabara
**"Hikari no Naka de" - Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei
**"Dark Side Stories" - Yoko Kurama & Hiei
**"Boku-tachi no Kisetsu" - Yusuke, Kurama, Kuwabara, Hiei
*The artifact ''Forlorn Hope'' is named after a [[Forlorn hope|military term]] for the first soldiers to attack the defensive wall in a siege, in an attempt to create a breach the rest of the army could exploit. These soldiers usually suffered horrendous casualties, thus providing the inspiration for the artifact's name: the wisher sacrifices himself for the benefit of others.
