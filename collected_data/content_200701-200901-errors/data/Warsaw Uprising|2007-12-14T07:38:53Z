{{Warsaw Uprising}}
The '''Warsaw Uprising''' (''Powstanie Warszawskie'') was a [[World War II]] struggle by the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] (''Armia Krajowa'') to liberate [[Warsaw]] from [[Germany|German]] occupation. The Uprising began on [[August 1]], [[1944]], as part of a nationwide rebellion, [[Operation Tempest]]. It was intended to last for only a few days until the Soviet Army would reach the city. The Soviet advance stopped short, however, while Polish resistance against the German forces continued for 63 days (until October 2).

The Uprising began at a crucial juncture as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Soviet Army|Army]] [[Lublin-Brest Operation|was approaching Warsaw]]. The Uprising's chief objective was to drive the German occupiers from the city, helping with the larger fight against the Axis.  Secondary political objectives were to liberate Warsaw before the [[Red Army]] arrived, so as to underscore Polish [[sovereignty]], and to undo the Allied division of [[Central Europe]] into [[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish authorities]] were to reappear in liberated Warsaw and challenge the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation|Soviet puppet government]] that was to rule Poland.

By [[September 16]], [[1944]], Soviet forces had reached a point a few hundred metres from the city, across the [[Vistula River]], but they made no further headway during the Uprising leading to allegations that [[Joseph Stalin]] had wanted the insurrection to fail.

Polish losses amounted to 18,000 soldiers killed and 25,000 wounded, in addition to between 120,000 and 200,000 civilian deaths, mostly from mass murders conducted by retreating German troops. German casualties totalled over 17,000 soldiers killed and over 9,000 wounded. During the [[urban combat]] approximately 25% of Warsaw's buildings were destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces on October 2, German troops systematically burned the city block by block. Together with earlier damage suffered in 1939 and during the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] (1943), over 85% of the city had been destroyed. By January 1945, when the Soviets finally entered the city, Warsaw had practically ceased to exist.

The Warsaw Uprising, or at least some form of insurrection in Poland, had been planned long in advance.<ref name="Sanford">[[George Sanford]], ''Katyn and the Soviet Massacre of 1940: Truth, Justice and Memory'', Routledge, 2005, ISBN 0415338735, [http://books.google.com/books?id=PZXvUuvfv-oC&pg=PA205&ots=_1uozjQZ1d&dq=Zygmunt+Berling+Warsaw+Uprising&sig=vU_pSvVej_0VQQdSNfwAB4_O85E Google Print, p.205–206]</ref> From its inception, the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] was planning a national uprising against the German forces. Initial plans created by the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in 1942 assumed that the [[Allies|Allied]] invasion of Europe would lead to the withdrawal of considerable German forces from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] for the defence of the [[Third Reich]]. The Home Army would act to prevent troop transfer to the west and to allow the British and American forces to seize Germany by breaking all communication links with the majority of the German forces massed in the Soviet Union.
[[Image:Flaga PPP.png|thumb|left|70px|[[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] with "[[Kotwica|anchor]]" device.]]
The [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army's]] initial plans for a national uprising, [[Operation Tempest]], which would link up with [[Western Allies]] forces, changed in 1943 when the situation on the Eastern Front made it apparent that the [[Red Army]], rather than the Western Allies, would force the Germans from Poland. By 1943 it was clear that the allied invasion of Europe would not come in time, and that in all probability the Red Army would reach the pre-war borders of Poland before the invasion could make notable headway. In February 1943, General [[Stefan Rowecki]] amended the plan. The Uprising was to be started in three phases, the first being in the East (with main centres of resistance in [[Lwów]] and [[Wilno]]), before the advancing Red Army. The second part was to include armed struggle in the belt between the [[Curzon Line]] and the [[Vistula]] river, while the third phase was to be a nationwide uprising throughout Poland. [[Warsaw]] was chosen, partially, because of its status as a pre-war capital and partly because it was assumed that the Germans would wish to hold onto the city for as long as possible, as a tool for morale boosting, and as a base for communications, supply, and troop movements.

The Polish government-in-exile carried out frantic diplomatic efforts to gain support from their allies prior to the start of [[Military description of the Warsaw Uprising|battle]]. However the Allies support for the Polish resistance was not high on the priority list. The Polish government in London asked the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) and the [[Foreign Office]] several times for an allied mission to be sent to Poland;<ref name="Soviets_and_AK"/> since such missions had already been dispatched to all other resistance movements in Europe, such as [[Albania]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Yugoslavia]]. However, the Polish pleas were not heeded until December 1944.
[[Image:Rowecki Stefan.jpg|thumb|left|70px|[[Stefan Rowecki|Rowecki]], early 1930s.]]
For the Soviets, this represented more of a hindrance than a help. Polish-Soviet relations were broken off on [[April 25]], [[1943]] as a result of the [[Katyn massacre]] and [[Soviet partisans in Poland|Soviet partisans often clashed with Polish partisans]].<ref name="Soviets_and_AK"/> It became obvious that the advancing Red Army might not come to Poland as a liberator but rather, as General [[Stefan Grot-Rowecki]] put it, as "our Allies' ally." On [[November 26]], [[1943]], the Polish government-in-exile issued an instruction to the effect that if diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union were not resumed before the Soviet entry into Poland, Home Army forces were to remain underground pending further decisions. However, the Home Army commander took a different approach, and on [[November 30]], [[1943]], the final version of the plan, which became known as Operation Tempest, was devised.  Although doubts existed about the military wisdom of a major uprising, planning continued nonetheless.
 
The situation came to a head on [[13 July]] as [[Operation Bagration]], the Soviet offensive, crossed the old [[Polish border]]. At this point the Poles had to make a decision: either initiate the uprising in the current difficult political situation and risk problems with Soviet support, or fail to rebel and face [[Soviet propaganda]] describing ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' as collaborators and ineffective cowards. The plan was intended both as a political manifestation of the influence of Polish Government in Exile and as a direct operation against German occupiers.<ref name="wufaq"/> The fear was that in the aftermath of the war the Allies would ignore the legal London-based government. It was clear both that Poland would be 'liberated' by the Red Army, and that the Soviet Union did not recognise the Government-in-Exile. The urgency for this decision increased as it became clear that after any successful Polish-Soviet co-operation in the liberation of various towns (for example, in the [[Operation Ostra Brama]]), the Soviet [[NKVD]] units who followed behind would either shoot or arrest most Polish officers and those Polish soldiers who could not or would not join the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East|Soviet controlled forces]].<ref name="Soviets_and_AK">[http://www.polandinexile.com/rising.htm The Warsaw Rising], polandinexile.com</ref> Following a flood of reports from the eastern territories about forced demilitarisation, trials and execution of Home Army soldiers by the Soviets, on [[21 July]] [[1944]] the High Command of the Home Army decided to expand the scope of Operation Tempest to include Warsaw itself. The date for the Warsaw Uprising was set as [[1 August]]. On [[25 July]] the Polish government in exile in [[London]] approved the planned uprising in Warsaw. 

In the early summer of 1944, German planning required Warsaw to serve as [[Festung Warschau|the defensive centre of the area]] and to be held at all costs. The Germans had fortifications constructed and built up their forces in the area. This process slowed after the failed [[July 20 Plot]] to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]], but by late July 1944, German forces had almost reached their full strength again. On [[July 27]], the head of the General Government, [[Hans Frank]], called for 100,000 Polish men between the ages of 17–65 to present themselves at several designated meeting places in Warsaw the following day,<ref name="wufaq"/> as part of the plan which envisaged the Poles constructing fortifications for the [[Wehrmacht]] in and around the city. The Home Army viewed this move as an attempt to neutralise the underground forces, and the underground urged Warsaw inhabitants to ignore it.<ref name="wufaq"/> Fearing German reprisals following the ignored order, and believing that time was of the essence, General [[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]] ordered full mobilisation of Home Army forces in the Warsaw area on [[1 August]], [[1944]].<ref name="wufaq"/>

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Tadeusz Bor Komorowski.jpg|left|thumb|80px|[[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]].]] -->
This mobilization decision had some key ramifications for the Soviet Union. Stalin decried for not being officially consulted on the uprising and thus suspected subterfuge from his Western allies. In retrospect, both sides were jockeying for regional political alignment, with the Polish Home Army's desire for a pro-Western Polish government and the Soviet's intention of establishing a Polish Communist regime.

The official Soviet propaganda line tried to portray the Polish underground as "waiting with their arms at ease" and not fighting the common enemy.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} As the Soviet forces approached Warsaw in June and July 1944, Soviet radio stations demanded a full national uprising in Warsaw to cut the communication lines of German units still on the right bank of the Vistula; just two days prior to the uprising, Soviet-controlled radio ''Kosciuszko''  had called for the Polish people to rise in arms.<ref name="wufaq"/> On [[July 29]][http://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/kosciuszko.htm], 1944, the first Soviet armoured units reached the outskirts of Warsaw, but were counter-attacked by [[German 39th Panzer Corps]], comprising [[4th Panzer Division]], [[5th SS Panzer Division]], [[19th Panzer Division]], and the [[Hermann Goering Panzer Division]].<ref name="Glants">[[David M.

{{main|List of military units in the Warsaw Uprising}}

=== Poles ===
The Home Army forces of the Warsaw District numbered about 45,000 soldiers, of which 23,000 were equipped and combat-ready; about 2,500 further soldiers came from the ranks of other formations like the far-right [[Narodowe Siły Zbrojne]] and the communist [[Armia Ludowa]].<ref name="WUmuseumcom"/> Most of them had trained for several years in [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] and [[urban guerrilla]] warfare, but lacked experience in prolonged daylight fighting. The forces lacked equipment,<ref name="WUmuseumcom"/> especially since the Home Army had shuttled weapons and men to the east of the city before the decision on [[21 July]] to include Warsaw in Operation Tempest. A number of other partisan groups also subordinated themselves to Home Army command for the uprising. Many volunteers, including some [[Polish Jews|Jews]] freed from the concentration camp in the ruins of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], joined during the fighting.<ref name="Jews"> The exact number of Poles of Jewish ancestry and Jews to take part in the uprising is a matter of controversy. General [[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]] estimated the number of Jewish Poles in Polish ranks at 1,000, other authors place it at between several hundred and 2,000. See for instance: {{pl icon}} {{cite paper | author =Edward Kossoy | title =Żydzi w Powstaniu Warszawskim | publisher =Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research | url =http://www.historiazydow.edu.pl/biblioteka/czytelnia/h_pw002.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2007-05-09 }}</ref>

General [[Antoni Chruściel]], codename 'Monter', commanded the Polish forces in Warsaw. Initially he divided his forces into eight areas:
*Area I ([[Śródmieście]], Old Town)
*Area II ([[Żoliborz]], [[Marymont]], [[Bielany]])
*Area III ([[Wola]])
*Area IV ([[Ochota]])
*Area V ([[Mokotów]])
*Area VI (Praga)
*Area VII ([[Powiat Warszawski]])
*[[Kedyw|Zgrupowanie Kedywu Komendy Głównej]]
On [[September 20]] a re-organisation of this structure took place to align with the structure of Polish forces fighting with the Western Allies. The entire force, renamed the Warsaw Home Army Corps (''Warszawski Korpus Armii Krajowej'') and commanded by General Antoni Chruściel (''Monter''), formed into three [[infantry division]]s.

As of [[August 1]] their military supplies consisted of:
*1,000 rifles
*1,700 pistols
*300 machine pistols
*60 submachine guns
*7 machine guns (medium or light, such as the [[MG 42]])
*35 [[anti-tank gun]]s and [[anti-tank rifle]]s (including several [[PIAT]]s)
*25,000 [[hand grenade]]s (mainly of the 'stick' variety).
In the course of the fighting the Poles obtained further supplies through [[airdrop]]s and by capture from the enemy (including several [[armoured vehicle]]s). Also, the insurgents’ workshops worked busily throughout the uprising, producing 300 [[automatic pistol]]s, 150 [[flame-thrower]]s, 40,000 grenades, a number of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]], and even an [[armoured car]] (''[[Kubuś]]'').

=== Germans ===
In late July the German units stationed in and around Warsaw were divided into three categories. The first - and the most numerous - was the garrison of Warsaw. As of [[July 31]], [[1944]], it numbered some 11,000 troops under General [[Rainer Stahel]].<ref name="Borkiewicz">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =Adam Borkiewicz | coauthors = | title =Powstanie Warszawskie 1944 | year =1957 | editor = | pages =40 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Wydawnictwo PAX | location =Warsaw | isbn= | url = | format = | accessdate = }}</ref> These forces included:
* Approximately 5,000 regular troops
* 4,000 [[Luftwaffe]] personnel (1,000 at [[Okęcie airport]], 700 at [[Bielany]], 1,000 in [[Boernerowo]], 300 at [[Służewiec]] and 1,000 in [[anti-air artillery]] posts throughout the city
* Approximately 2,000 men of the ''Wachtregiment Warschau'' ({{lang-de|Sentry Regiment Warsaw}}), including four infantry battalions (''Patz'', ''Baltz'', No.996 and No.997), an [[SS]] reconnaissance squadron (ca. 350 men), factory guards, [[Andrey Vlasov]]'s men, Turkmmen<!--Turkmen?--> and other auxiliary troops.

These well-equipped German forces had been prepared for the defence of the city's key positions for many months. Several hundred concrete [[bunker]]s and [[barbed wire]] lines protected the buildings and areas occupied by the Germans.

Apart from the garrison itself, there were numerous units stationed on both banks of the Vistula or moving through the city in both directions. These comprised some 15,000 to 16,000 [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers{{Fact|date=May 2007}}. Also, at least 90,000 additional German troops were available from occupation forces in the surrounding area{{Fact|date=May 2007}}.

The second category was formed by police and [[SS]] under Col. [[Paul Otto Geibel]], numbering initially 5,710 men.<ref name="Borkiewicz-41">Borkiewicz, op.cit., p.41</ref> These included three [[Schutzpolizei]] battalions (1,000 men) and two [[Sauferkaserne]] SS battalions (1,000 men), as well as reserve companies (300 men), an [[SA]] battalion (400 men), military police, [[Ordnungspolizei]], [[Sicherheitspolizei]], training units and many smaller units up to 400 men strong. 

The third category was formed by various sentry and guard units, altogether some 3,500 men strong. Among them were detachments of the [[Bahnschutz]] (rail guard), [[Werkschutz]] (factory guard) and a transport protection battalion.

In the course of the uprising the German side received reinforcements on a daily basis. As of [[August 23]], [[1944]], the German units directly involved with fighting in Warsaw included:
*Battle Group Rohr (commanded by Major General Rohr)
*Battle Group Reinefarth (commanded by SS-Gruppenführer [[Heinz Reinefarth]])
** Attack Group [[Dirlewanger Brigade]]
** Attack Group Reck (commanded by Major Reck)
** Attack Group Schmidt (commanded by Colonel Schmidt)
** Various support and backup units
*Warsaw Garrison (''Group of Warsaw Commandant'') commanded by Lieutenant General Stahel

== The rising ==
{{Main|Military description of the Warsaw Uprising}}
[[Image:Uprising kotwica.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Postwar ''[[Kotwica]]'' sculpture before bullet-riddled Bank of Poland Redoubt. The "[[Kotwica|anchor]]" combines the letters "''P''" and "''W''," initials of "''Polska walcząca''" — "Poland fights."]]

=== W-hour ===
After days of hesitation, at 17:30 on July 31st, the Polish headquarters scheduled "W-hour" (from the Polish ''wybuch'', "outbreak"), the moment of the start of the uprising, for 17:00 of the following day.<ref name="wutime">[http://www.warsawuprising.com/timeline.htm Warsaw Uprising - Timeline]</ref> The decision proved to be a costly strategic mistake as the under-equipped Polish forces were prepared for a series of coordinated surprise night attacks and the daylight exposed them to German machine gun fire. Although a large number of the partisan units were already mobilized and waiting at assembly points throughout the city, the mobilization of thousands of young men and women was hard to conceal and fighting started in advance of "W-hour",<ref name="wutime"/> notably in the boroughs of [[Żoliborz]], [[Mokotów]] and [[Czerniaków]], around [[Napoleon Square]], in the vicinity of the [[Hale Mirowskie]] and [[Plac Kercelego]] marketplaces, and at [[Okopowa]] street.

Until "W-hour" these incidents were not generally perceived as part of a larger plan. However, at around 16:00, SS-Standartenfuhrer [[Paul Otto Geibel]], chief of police and SS in the Warsaw District, received a warning about the uprising from an anonymous 'lieutenant of the Luftwaffe', who had in turn been warned about it by a Polish woman.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} He alerted the units under his command, which thus were prepared for the assault at 17:00. This drastically reduced the element of surprise for the insurgents. On the other hand, while the Germans had been considering the possibility of an uprising, they had no operational plans to meet such an occurrence.

Under these circumstances the coordinated attacks on the German outposts and garrisons were largely successful. The first two days were crucial in establishing the battlefield for the rest of the fight. Most successes were achieved in the city centre ([[Warszawa-Śródmieście|Śródmieście]]) and the old town ([[Warsaw Old Town|Stare Miasto]]) and the nearby boroughs of [[Wola]], where most objectives were captured, although several major German strongholds remained, and in some areas of Wola Poles sustained heavy losses that forced them to retreat early on. In other areas such as [[Mokotów]] the attackers almost completely failed to secure any of their objectives and controlled only the residential areas. In [[Praga]], on the eastern bank of the Vistula river, the concentration of German forces was so high that the Poles fighting there were quickly forced back into hiding.<ref name="Bartelski">{{pl icon}} {{Cite book | publisher = Fundacja "Wystawa Warszawa Walczy 1939–1945" | isbn = 8387545333 | pages = 182 | last = Bartelski
| first = Lesław M. | title = Praga | location = Warsaw | date = 2000 }}</ref> Most crucially, the fighters in different areas failed to link up, either with each other or with areas outside Warsaw, leaving each section of the city isolated from the others.

After the first hours of fighting many units adopted a more defensive strategy while the civilian population started erecting barricades throughout the city. Despite all the problems, by [[August 4]] most of the city lay in Polish hands.

[[Image:Barykada.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Poles erected barricades, such as this one on [[Napoleon Square (Warsaw)|Napoleon Square]], throughout Warsaw, making it difficult for German infantry and tanks to operate. In background: captured [[Hetzer]] [[tank destroyer]].]]

=== First four days ===
The uprising was intended to last a few days until Soviet forces arrived;<ref name="Madajczyk">{{pl icon}} {{de icon}} {{cite book |author=various authors |coauthors=[[Czesław Madajczyk]] |editor=Stanisława Lewandowska, Bernd Martin |others= |title=Powstanie Warszawskie 1944 |origmonth= |url= |format= |year=1999 |publisher=Wydawnictwo Polsko-Niemieckie |location=Warsaw |language= |isbn=8386653086 | pages=613 |chapter=Nie rozwiązane problemy powstania warszawskiego |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref> however, this never happened, and the Polish forces had to fight with little outside assistance. The results of the first two days of fighting in different parts of the city were as follows:
* ''Area I'' (city centre and the Old Town): Units captured most of their assigned territory, but failed to capture areas where there were strong German pockets of resistance (the [[Warsaw University]] buildings, [[PAST]] skyscraper, or the headquarters of the German garrison in the [[Saxon Palace]]). They thus failed to create a central stronghold and secure communication links to other areas. The main failures were in not establishing a secure land connection with the northern area of Żoliborz through the northern railway line and the [[Cytadela]] fortress, as well as not capturing the bridges over the Vistula. The forces mobilized in the city centre also failed to capture the [[Nur für Deutsche|German-only]] area near the Szucha avenue.
* ''Area II'' (Żoliborz, [[Marymont]], [[Bielany]]): Units here failed to secure the most important military targets in the area of Żoliborz. Many units retreated outside of the city, into the forests. Although most of the area was captured, the soldiers of Colonel ''[[Mieczysław Niedzielski|Żywiciel]]'' failed to capture the Cytadela fortress area and break through German defences at [[Warszawa Gdańska]] railway station.
* ''Area III'' ([[Wola]]): Units here initially succeeded in securing most of the territory, but sustained heavy losses (up to 30%). Some units retreated into the forests, while others retreated to the eastern part of the area. In the northern part of Wola the soldiers of Colonel ''[[Jan Mazurkiewicz|Radosław]]'' managed to capture the German barracks, the German supply depot at [[Stawki|Stawki Street]], and the flanking position at the [[Warsaw Jewish Cemetery|Jewish cemetery]].
* ''Area IV'' ([[Ochota]]): The units mobilized in this area did not capture either the territory or the military targets (the ''[[Gęsiówka]]'' [[concentration camp]], SS and [[Sipo]] barracks located in former Students' House on ''[[Gabriel Narutowicz|Narutowicz]] Square''). After suffering heavy casualties most of the forces of the [[Armia Krajowa]] retreated to the forests west of Warsaw. Only two small units of approximately 200 to 300 men under Lieut. [[Andrzej Chyczewski|Gustaw]] remained in the area and managed to create strong pockets of resistance. They were later reinforced by units from the city centre. Elite units of the [[KeDyw]] managed to secure most of the northern part of the area and captured all of the military targets there. However, they were soon tied down by German tactical counter-attacks from the south and west.
* ''Area V'' ([[Mokotów]]): The situation in this area was very serious from the start of the hostilities. The partisans were to capture the heavily-defended and fortified so-called Police Area (''Dzielnica policyjna'') on [[Rakowiecka]] Street. They were also to establish a connection with the city centre through open terrain at the former airfield of [[Pole Mokotowskie]]. As both of the areas were heavily fortified and could be approached only through open terrain, the assaults failed. Some units retreated into the forests, while others managed to capture parts of Dolny Mokotów, which was, however, severed from most communications routes to other areas.
* ''Area VI'' ([[Praga]]): The Uprising was also started on the right bank of the Vistula. The main task of the ''Area VI'' (''Obwód VI'') was to seize the bridges on the river and secure the bridgeheads until the arrival of the [[Red Army]]. It was clear that, since the location was far worse than that of the other areas, there was no chance of any help from the outside. After some minor initial successes, the forces of Lt.Col. [[Antoni Żurowski]] were badly outnumbered by the German forces concentrated there. The fights were halted, and the Home Army forces located in the Praga area were forced back into the underground.<ref name="wutime"/> After the Soviets finally reached the right bank of the Vistula on [[September 10]], the officers proposed recreating the pre-war [[36th Infantry Regiment (Poland)|36th ''Academic Legion'' Infantry Regiment]]; however, they were all arrested by the [[NKVD]] and sent to Russia for interrogation.
* ''Area VII'' (''[[Powiat]] warszawski''): this area consisted of territories outside Warsaw city limits. Actions here mostly failed to capture their targets.

An additional area within the Polish command structure was formed by the units of the [[Kedyw]] (''Directorate of Sabotage and Diversion''), an elite formation that was to guard the headquarters and was to be used as an ''armed ambulance'', thrown into the battle in the most endangered areas. These units secured parts of Śródmieście and Wola; along with the units of ''Area I'', they were the most successful during the first few hours.

Among the most notable primary targets that were not taken during the opening stages of the uprising were the airfields of [[Okęcie]] and [[Pole Mokotowskie]], as well as the PAST sky-scraper overlooking the city centre and the [[Warszawa Gdańska]] guarding the passage between the centre and the northern borough of Żoliborz.

=== Wola massacre ===
{{details|Wola massacre}}
The Uprising reached its apogee on [[August 4]] when the Home Army soldiers managed to establish front lines in the westernmost boroughs of [[Wola]] and [[Ochota]]. However, the moment of greatest gains was also the moment at which the German army stopped its retreat westwards and began receiving reinforcements. On the same day SS General [[Erich von dem Bach]] was appointed commander of all the forces employed against the Uprising,<ref name="wutime"/> and began to counter-attack with the aim of linking up with the remaining German pockets and then cutting off the Uprising from the Vistula river. Among the units to arrive at the city at that time were forces of [[Oskar Dirlewanger]],<ref name="wutime"/> [[Willy Schmidt]] and [[Heinz Reinefarth]].<ref name="wutime"/>

On [[August 5]] the three German groups started their advance westward along ''Wolska'' and ''Górczewska'' streets toward the main East-West communication line of [[Aleje Jerozolimskie]] Avenue. Their advance was halted, but the Reinefarth and Dirlewanger regiments began carrying out [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s orders: behind the lines, special SS, police and Wehrmacht groups went from house to house, shooting the inhabitants and burning their bodies.<ref name="wutime"/> By [[August 8]], some 40,000 civilians had been killed in Wola alone,<ref name="BBC">{{pl icon}} {{Cite news | publisher = BBC Polish edition | title = Muzeum Powstania otwarte | date = 2004-10-02 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/polish/domestic/story/2004/10/041002_uprising_warsaw_museum.shtml }}</ref> though some estimates cite numbers as high as 100,000.<ref name="Kłoczowski">{{pl icon}} {{Cite news | edition = Warsaw | author = Jerzy Kłoczowski | title = O Powstaniu Warszawskim opowiada prof.

Despite the loss of Wola, the Polish resistance stiffened. ''Zośka'' and ''Wacek'' battalions managed to capture the ruins of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and liberate the [[Gęsiówka]] concentration camp, freeing about 350 Jews.<ref name="wutime"/> The area became one of the main communication links between the insurgents fighting in Wola and those defending the Old Town. On [[August 7]] German forces were strengthened by the arrival of tanks with civilians being used as [[human shield]]s.<ref name="wutime"/> After two days of heavy fighting they managed to bisect Wola and reach the [[Bankowy Square]]. However, by then the net of barricades, street fortifications and tank obstacles was already well-prepared and both sides reached a stalemate, with heavy house-to-house fighting.

Between [[August 9]] and [[August 18]] pitched battles raged around the Old Town and nearby Bankowy Square, with successful attacks by the Germans and counter-attacks from the Poles. Once again, the Germans used demoralizing tactics: targeted attacks against clearly marked hospitals (reminiscent of Luftwaffe attacks against hospitals in September, 1939). German tactics hinged on bombardment through the use of [[heavy artillery]] (including the [[Schwerer Gustav]] super-heavy mortar) and [[tactical bomber]]s, against which the Poles were unable to effectively defend, as they lacked anti-aircraft artillery weapons.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Although the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] had already shown the danger which a city can pose to armies which fight within it and the importance of local support, the Warsaw Uprising was probably the first demonstration that in an urban terrain, a vastly under-equipped force supported by the civilian population can hold its own against better-equipped professional soldiers— though at the cost of considerable sacrifices on the part of the city's residents.

[[Image:Warszawa Powstanie 1944-09-10.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Polish-controlled area after the fall of the Old Town, around September 10th]]
The Old Town was held until the end of August when diminished supplies made further defence impossible. On [[September 2]]<ref name="wutime"/> the defenders of the Old Town withdrew through the [[sewer]]s, which at this time were becoming a major means of communication between different parts of the Uprising.<ref name="wutime"/> More than 5,300 men and women were evacuated in this way.

[[Image:Uprising sewers.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Warsaw [[sewers|sewer system]] (map) was used to move insurgent forces, unseen, between the Old Town and the Downtown (''Śródmieście'') and ''[[Żoliborz]]'' districts.]]
The Soviet army captured Eastern Warsaw and arrived on the eastern bank of the Vistula in mid-September. When they finally reached the right bank of the Vistula on [[September 10]], the officers of the Home Army units stationed there proposed recreating the pre-war [[36th 'Academic Legion' infantry regiment]]; however, the [[NKVD]] arrested them all and sent them to the Soviet Union.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.<!--repeated from further up-->

Soviet attacks on 4th SS Panzer Corps east of Warsaw were renewed on [[August 26]], and forced the Germans to retreat into Praga, and then across the Vistula. The Soviet army included<!--what?--> the [[1st Polish Army]] (''1 Armia Wojska Polskiego''), and some of them landed in the [[Czerniaków]] and [[Powiśle]] areas and made contacts with Home Army forces. Their initiative was however not supported by the Soviet High Command. With inadequate artillery, air support, and numbers, the landing troops sustained heavy casualties and were forced to retreat. After the failure of repeated attempts by the 1st Polish Army to link up with the insurgents, the Soviets limited their assistance to sporadic artillery and air support. Plans for a river crossing were suspended "for at least 4 months", since operations against the five [[panzer]] divisions on 9th Army's order of battle were problematic at that point, and the commander of the 1st Polish Army, General [[Zygmunt Berling]], who ordered the crossing of the Vistula by his units, was relieved of his duties by his Soviet superiors.<ref name="Soviets_and_AK"/>

From this point on, the Warsaw Uprising can be seen as a one-sided war of attrition or, alternatively, as a fight for acceptable terms of surrender. Fighting ended on [[2 October]] when the Polish forces were finally forced to capitulate.

== Life behind the lines ==
[[Image:Warsaw Uprising boyscouts.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Polish Boy Scouts fighting in the Warsaw Uprising]]
In 1939 Warsaw had roughly 1,350,000 inhabitants. Over a million were still living in the city at the start of the Uprising. In Polish-controlled territory, during the first weeks of the Uprising, people tried to recreate the normal day-to-day life of their free country. Cultural life was vibrant, both among the soldiers and civilian population, with theatres, post offices, newspapers and similar activities.<!--similar activities?--><ref name="Nawrocka">{{pl icon}} {{Cite book | edition = 1 | publisher = Czytelnik | pages = 169 | last = Nawrocka-Dońska

=== Food shortages ===
As the Uprising was supposed to be relieved by the Soviets in a matter of days, the Polish underground did not predict food shortages would be a problem. However, as the fighting dragged on, the inhabitants of the city faced hunger and starvation. Soon horses, dogs and cats disappeared from the city's streets. The situation was improved by the Home Army units who captured several German army depots and started distribution of food through the net of public eateries. A major break-through took place on August 6, when the Polish units recaptured the [[Haberbusch i Schiele]] brewery complex at Ceglana Street. From that time on the Varsovians lived mostly on barley from the brewery's warehouses. Every day up to several thousand people organized into cargo teams reported to the brewery for bags of barley and then distributed them in the city centre. The barley was then ground in coffee grinders and boiled with water to form a so-called spit-soup ({{lang-pl|pluj-zupa}}). The "Sowiński" Battalion managed to hold the brewery until the end of the fighting.

Another serious problem for civilians and soldiers alike was a shortage of water.<ref name="wutime"/> By mid-August most of the water conduits were either out of order or filled with corpses. In addition, the main water pumping station remained in German hands.<ref name="wutime"/> To prevent the spread of epidemics and provide the people with water, the authorities ordered all janitors to supervise the construction of water wells in the backyards of every house. On September 21 the Germans blew up the remaining pumping stations at Koszykowa street and after that the public wells were the only source of potable water in the besieged city.<ref name="Mączewski">{{pl icon}} {{cite web | author=Ryszard Mączewski | title=Stacja Filtrów | publisher=warszawa1939.pl | year= | work=Architektura przedwojennej Warszawy | url=http://www.warszawa1939.pl/index.php?r1=koszykowa_filtry&r3=0 | accessdate=2007-05-08 }}</ref> By the end of September, the City Centre district had more than 90 functioning wells.<ref name="wutime"/>

== Lack of outside support ==
{{main|Lack of outside support in the Warsaw Uprising}}
According to many historians, a major cause of this was the almost complete lack of outside support and the late arrival of the support which did arrive.<ref name="wufaq"/><ref name="Glants"/> The only support operation which ran continuously for the duration of the Uprising were night supply drops by long-range planes of the [[Royal Air Force]], other [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] air forces, and units of the [[Polish Air Force]], which had to use distant airfields in Italy and so had very limited effect.

=== Western Allies ===
[[Image:Uprising airmen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monument to Allied airmen lost over Warsaw.]]
Limited support in terms of [[airdrop]]s came from the Western allies; particularly the [[Royal Air Force]], in which a number of Polish, Australian, Canadian and South African pilots flew, made 223 sorties and lost 34 aircraft. However the effect of these airdrops was mostly psychological, as they delivered much smaller number of supplies than was needed by the insurgents, and many air drops landed outside insurgent-controlled territory.

American support was also limited. After Stalin's objections to supporting the uprising, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] telegrammed U.S President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on [[August 25]] and proposed sending planes in defiance of Stalin, to "see what happens". Unwilling to upset Stalin before the [[Yalta Conference]], Roosevelt replied on [[August 26]] with: ''I do not consider it advantageous to the long-range general war prospect for me to join you in the proposed message to Uncle Joe''.<ref name="CNNS">''[http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/presents/shows/warsaw.rising/interactive/timeline.warsaw/frameset.exclude.html Warsaw Uprising CNN Special]'' - August 26. Last accessed on 11 April 2007.</ref>

Also of significant note was the existence of an American airbase at [[Poltava]] in Ukraine, from which an airdrop was made during the "Frantic Mission" in mid-September. However, this action infuriated Stalin, who immediately forbade all Allied presence in Soviet airspace{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. Thus all but one Allied airdrops had to be carried out from faraway [[Brindisi]] in [[Italy]].

From [[August 4]] the Western Allies begun supporting the Warsaw Uprising with [[airdrop]]s of munitions and other supplies.<ref name="WUairdrops2">[http://www.1944.pl/index.php?a=site_text&id=12440&se_id=12506 AIRDROPS FOR INSURGENTS] at Warsaw Rising Museum</ref> Initially the air raids were carried out mostly by the ''1568th Polish Flight'' of the [[Polish Air Force]] stationed in [[Bari]] and [[Brindisi]] in [[Italy]], flying [[B-24 Liberator]], [[Handley Page Halifax]] and [[C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakota]] planes.

The Soviet Union did not give permission to the Allies for use of its airports for those supply operations<ref name="wufaq"/> and thus the planes were forced to use bases in the [[United Kingdom]] and Italy which reduced their carrying weight and number of sorties. The Allies' specific request for the use of landing strips made on [[20 August]] was denied by Stalin on [[22 August]]<ref name="Fairly"/> (he referred to the insurgents as 'a handful of criminals'<ref name="times04">Kamil Tchorek, [http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/times_online.htm Escaped British Airman Was Hero of Warsaw Uprising]</ref> and stated that the uprising was inspired by 'enemies of the Soviet Union'<ref name="WUairfields">[http://www.1944.pl/index.php?a=site_text&id=12440&se_id=12445 STALIN’S PRIVATE AIRFIELDS], Warsaw Rising Museum</ref>).

Finally on [[September 18]] the Soviets allowed one [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] flight of 107 [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the 3 division [[Eighth Air Force]] to re-fuel and reload at Soviet airfields used in [[Operation Frantic]], but it was too little too late. USAAF 107 bombers (and 1000 airman) dropped 100 tons of supplies (only 20 was recovered by the insurgent due to wide spread).<ref name="WUairfields"/> The planes then landed in Soviet-held territory, and on their return flight to [[Foggia]] and then back to England the B-17's bombed the rail yards in [[Budapest]], Hungary.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Although German air defence over the Warsaw area itself was almost non-existent about 12% of the 296 planes taking part in the operations were lost because they had to fly 1,600 km out over heavily defended enemy territory and then back over the same route (112 out of 637 Polish and 133 out of 735 British and South African airman were shot down).<ref name="WUairfields"/> Most of the drops were made during night, at no more than 100–300 feet altitude, and poor accuracy left many parachuted packages stranded behind German-controlled territory (only about 50 tones of supplies, less than 50% delivered, was recovered by the insurgents).<ref name="WUairdrops2"/>

From [[September 14]]<ref name="WUairdrops2"/> to 28 on the Soviets began their own airdrop raids with supplies, and dropped about 55 tons in total. The drops continued until [[September 28]]. Since the Soviet airmen did not equip the containers with [[parachute]]s<ref name="WUairdrops2"/> the majority of recovered packages were damaged.

=== Soviet stance ===
{{cquote|''Contrary to our expectations, the enemy has halted all of their offensive actions alongside the entire front of the 9th Army.''<br />- from operations journal of German 9th Army on 16 August 1944}}{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The role of the Red Army during the Warsaw Uprising remains controversial and is still disputed by some historians.<ref name="Glants"/> The Uprising started when the Red Army appeared on the city's doorstep, and the Poles in Warsaw were counting on Soviet aid coming in a matter of days. This basic scenario of an uprising against the Germans launched a few days before the arrival of Allied forces played out successfully in a number of European capitals, notably [[Liberation of Paris|Paris]] and [[Prague uprising|Prague]]. However, the Red Army did not extend effective aid to the desperate city despite standing less than 10 km from Warsaw's city center for about 40 days, and then moving even closer to the right bank of the Vistula river a few hundred meters away from the main battle of the uprising during its last two weeks. Some Western historians, as well as the official line of the Communist regime in Poland before 1989, claimed that the Red Army, exhausted by its long advance on its way to Warsaw, lacked sufficient fighting power to overcome the German forces around Warsaw and extend effective aid to the Uprising. However, it is also speculated that Stalin did not want to aid the Home Army, made up of likely opponents of the Soviet regime in Poland after the war.<ref name="Glants"/>

One of the reasons given as to why the Warsaw uprising failed, was the failure of the Soviet Red Army to aid the Resistance. The Red Army, which was ordered to halt and therefore positioned just a short distance away on the right bank of the Vistula, was ordered not to link up with or in any way assist the Resistance forces. Post-war political considerations and malice by Stalin are seen as the reason for the Red Army's failure to act.<ref name="Soviets_and_AK"/> Another possible reason was the 4–5 Panzer Divisions in the 46th Panzer Corps and 4th SS Panzer Corps on the order of battle of German 9th Army holding positions east of Warsaw.<ref name="Glants"/>

It is possible that Stalin ordered his forces to halt right before entering the city so that the Home Army would not succeed. Had the Home Army triumphed, the Polish government-in-exile in London would have increased their political and moral legitimacy to reinstate a government of its own, rather than accept a Soviet regime. By halting the Red Army's advance, Stalin guaranteed the destruction of Polish resistance (which would undoubtedly also have resisted Soviet occupation), that it would be the Soviets who "liberated" Warsaw, and that Soviet influence would prevail over Poland.<ref name="Soviets_and_AK"/> The Soviet military gave a shortage of fuel as the reason why they could not advance. Soviet and Polish sources disagree.

One explanation which has been given for the lack of outside support is that the [[Lead up to the Warsaw Uprising|uprising began]] too early and so the nearby Soviet forces were not ready to support. This explanation, however, appears to be contradicted by the fact that, at times during the uprising the [[NKVD]] was actively arresting [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] forces in the East of Warsaw and that a large proportion of RAF losses were caused by Soviet anti-aircraft fire. Two further explanations have been given for the failure of Allied support. The first is that the Soviets misunderstood the circumstances of the uprising, though, again this cannot easily explain their attacks on their own ''allies'', the British, without some further complication. The second is that the Soviet forces deliberately blocked the Western Allies from providing support to the Polish forces to support their desire to have Warsaw and any independent-minded Polish forces destroyed before their arrival.

An alternative explanation is that, regardless of Stalin's political intentions, the Red Army was simply exhausted and hence unable to extend effective support to the Uprising. In support of this thesis, it is often claimed that since the opening of [[Operation Bagration]] many of Red Army units had covered several hundred miles in a far-ranging offensive, and their advance elements were at the very end of their logistical tether. This, coupled with the presence of several fresh SS and Panzer divisions around Warsaw which administered a sharp reverse to the Soviet 2nd Tank Army in the final days of July, was, according to this view, sufficient to stop the Red Army in its tracks on the Warsaw front. However, it must be kept in mind that the units which reached Warsaw in late July 1944 were not part of Bagration, but instead advanced from Western Ukraine as part of the [[Lublin-Brest Operation]], covering a much smaller distance. Those units were in fact able to operate quite effectively against German forces to the south and north of Warsaw during August and September, successfully securing bridgeheads over the Vistula and Narew rivers in those sectors. Given that Soviet success, the apparent inactivity on the most direct route of approach towards Warsaw, through the suburb of Praga, lasting through August and the first half of September, is to say the least puzzling. Furthermore, once the Soviet forces seized Praga in mid-September 1944, only poorly supported units of the inexperienced [[1st Polish Army]] were assigned to attempt the crossing of the river Vistula to aid the insurgents. Those crossings failed to establish a durable foothold on the left bank of the river, and caused considerable casualties among the Polish units involved. It is an open question whether an earlier Soviet effort using more experienced units with adequate support would have been able to reach and cross the Vistula in the Warsaw sector, and provide timely and effective support to the Polish units fighting in the main part of the city. The continued difficulty in accessing the Soviet documents of the time presently located in the Russian archives makes it difficult for historians to answer this question with any degree of certainty.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The Red Army reached the outskirts of Warsaw in the final days of July, 1944.

The Soviets retained their positions to the south-east of Warsaw along the Vistula river, barely 10 km away from the city centre, at the outskirts of the Warsaw right bank suburb [[Praga]]. The Poles fighting in the Uprising were counting that the Soviet forces would seize Praga in a matter of days and then be in a position to have Red Army units cross to the left bank where the main battle of the Uprising was occurring and come to its aid.

However, on that line along the outskirts of Praga, on the most direct route of advance towards Warsaw, the Soviets stopped their advance and the front line did not move for the next 45 days. The sector was held by the understrength German [[German 73rd Infantry Division|73rd infantry division]], destroyed many times on the Eastern Front and recently reconstituted.<ref>''SS: The Waffen-SS War in Russia 1941–45'' Relevant page viewable via [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&id=HAMd81LJJs4C&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=73rd+infantry+division&prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3D73rd%2Binfantry%2Bdivision%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&sig=k-va3MBk58jCUKatCmNi6UU10BQ Google book search]</ref> The division, though weak, did not experience significant Soviet pressure during that period. At the same time, the Red Army was fighting intense battles to the south of Warsaw, to seize and maintain bridgeheads over the Vistula river, and to the north, to gain bridgeheads over the river [[Narew]]. It was on those sectors that the best panzer and armored divisions that the Germans had were fighting. Despite that, both of these objectives have been mostly secured by early September. 

Finally, on [[September 11]], the Soviet 47th army began its advance into Praga. The resistance by the German 73rd division was weak and collapsed quickly, with the Soviets gaining control of the suburb by [[September 14]]. With the taking of Praga, the Soviet forces were now directly across the river from the Uprising fighting in left-bank Warsaw. If the Soviets had reached this stage in early August, the crossing of the river would have been easy, as the Poles then held considerable stretches of the riverfront. By mid-September a series of German attacks have reduced the Poles to holding one narrow stretch of the riverbank, in the district of [[Czerniakow]]. Nevertheless, the Soviets now made an attempt to aid the Uprising, but not by using Red Army units. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

In the [[Praga]] area Polish units under command of General [[Zygmunt Berling]] (thus sometimes known as 'berlingowcy' - 'the Berling men'), the [[1st Polish Army]] (''1 Armia Wojska Polskiego'') were in position. On the night of 14/15th of September three patrols from landed on the shore of Czerniaków and Powiśle areas and made contacts with Home Army forces. Under heavy German fire only small elements of main units made it ashore (I and III battalions of 9th infantry regiment, 3rd Infantry Division).<ref name="Berling landings"/>

The Germans intensified their attacks on the Home Army positions near the river to prevent any further landings, which could seriously compromise their line of defense, but weren't able to make any significant advances for several days, while Polish forces held those vital positions in preparation for new expected wave of Soviet landings. Polish units from the eastern shore attempted several more landings, and from 15 to 23 September sustained heavy losses (including destruction of all landing boats and most of other river crossing equipment).<ref name="Berling landings"/> [[Red Army]] support was negligible.<ref name="Berling landings"/>

Shortly after the Berling landings, the Soviets decide to postpone all plans for a river crossing in Warsaw "for at least 4 months" and soon afterwards general Berling was relieved of his command.<ref name="PHD-Ber">Richard J.

===After the war===
{{main|After effects of the Warsaw Uprising|Cultural representations of the Warsaw Uprising}}
[[Image:Uprising Grob.png|thumb|right|151px|After the Uprising, one grave was left in the streets of Warsaw.]]
Due to a lack of cooperation and often the active aggressive moves on the part of the Soviets and several other factors, the Warsaw Uprising and Operation Tempest failed in their primary goal: to free part of the Polish territories so that a government loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]] could be established there instead of a Soviet [[puppet state]]. There is no consensus among historians as to whether that was ever possible, or whether those operations had any other lasting effect. Some argue that without Operation Tempest and the Warsaw Uprising, Poland would have ended as a Soviet republic, a fate definitely worse than that of an "independent" puppet state, and thus the Operation succeeded at least partially in being a political demonstration to the Soviets and Western Allies.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} In addition, the Warsaw Uprising compelled the Soviets to stop their offensive in Poland to let the Germans suppress the uprising. Some historians speculate that if they had not stopped their march, they would have occupied all of Germany rather than just the eastern section. {{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Warsaw was liberated from the Nazis on [[17 January]] [[1945]] by the Red Army and the 1st army of [[Ludowe Wojsko Polskie]] during the [[Vistula-Oder Offensive]].<ref name="wutime"/>

[[Image:Warsaw wwII 1.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Warsaw]] monument to the heroes of the Warsaw Uprising.]]
Most soldiers of the Home Army (including those who took part in the Warsaw Uprising) were persecuted after the war: captured by the [[NKVD]] or [[Urzad Bezpieczenstwa|UB]] political police, interrogated and imprisoned, awaiting trials on various charges.<ref name="Paczkowski"/><ref name="polraddlaza">Michał Zając, ''[http://www.polskieradio.pl/zagranica/dokument.aspx?iid=39960 Warsaw Uprising: 5 pm, August 1, 1944]'', Retrieved on 4 July 2007.</ref> Many of them were sent to [[Gulag]]s, executed or just "disappeared".<ref name="Paczkowski">Andrzej Paczkowski. Poland, the "Enemy Nation", pp. 372–375, in ''[[Black Book of Communism]]. Crimes, Terror, Repression''. Harvard University Press, London. See [http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/nkvd_print.htm online excerpt].</ref> 

In addition, members of the Polish Air Force flying supplies to the Home Army, were likewise persecuted after the war and many others "disappeared" after their return to Poland. Once word got back to the Polish flyers still in England, many decided not to return to Poland. Many insurgents, captured by the Germans and sent to POW camps in Germany were later liberated by British, American and Polish forces and remained in the West. Among those were the leaders of the uprising: [[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]] and [[Antoni Chruściel]] (in [[London]] and the United States, respectively).

Factual knowledge of the Warsaw Uprising, inconvenient to Stalin, was twisted by propaganda of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], which stressed the failings of the Home Army and the Polish government-in-exile, and forbade all criticism of the Red Army or the political goals of Soviet strategy.<ref name="Sawicki">{{pl icon}} {{Cite book| publisher = Wydawnictwo "DiG"| isbn = 837181366X| pages = 230| last = Sawicki| first = Jacek Zygmunt| title = Bitwa o prawdę: Historia zmagań o pamieć Powstania Warszawskiego 1944-1989| location = Warsaw| year = 2005 }}</ref> Until the late [[1960s|sixties]] the very name of the Home Army was censored, and most films and novels covering the 1944 Uprising were either banned or modified so that the name of the Home Army did not appear.<ref name="Sawicki"/> Further, the official propaganda of both communist Poland and the [[USSR]] suggested that the Home Army was some sort of a group of right-wing collaborators with Nazi Germany. From 1956 on, the image of the Warsaw Uprising in Polish propaganda was changed a little bit to underline that the soldiers were indeed brave, while the officers were treacherous and the commanders were characterised by disregard of the losses.<ref name="Sawicki"/> The first serious publications on the topic were not issued until the late [[1980s|eighties]]. In Warsaw no monument to the Home Army could be built until 1989. Instead, efforts of the Soviet-backed [[Armia Ludowa]] were glorified and exaggerated.
[[Image:Warsaw wwII.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Warsaw monument to the heroes of the Warsaw Uprising.]]
In the West, the story of the Polish fight for Warsaw with little support was an embarrassment, as was the shock of Home Army soldiers as Western Allies recognised the Soviet controlled pro-Communist regime installed by Stalin; as a result, the story was not publicised for many years.

The courage of soldiers and civilians involved in the Warsaw Uprising, and its betrayal by the Soviet Union, contributed to keeping anti-Soviet sentiment in Poland at a high level throughout the [[Cold War]]. Memories of the Uprising helped to inspire the Polish labour movement [[Solidarity]], which led a peaceful opposition movement against the Communist government during the 1980s, leading to the downfall of that government in 1989 and the emergence of democratic political representation.

After [[fall of communism]] in 1989, the censorship of the facts of the Uprising ceased, and [[1 August]] has now become a celebrated anniversary. On [[1 August]] [[1994]], Poland held a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Uprising. Germany and Russia were invited to the ceremony, although there was opposition to Russia's invitation. Moreover, a joke making the rounds suggested that "[[Yeltsin]] should be given a pair of binoculars so he can observe the ceremony from across the Vistula river." On [[July 31]], [[2004]], a [[Warsaw Uprising Museum]] opened in Warsaw.

Research into the Warsaw Uprising has been boosted since the 1990s, particularly due to abolition of censorship and opening of state archives in Poland, however research into the lack of support of the Warsaw Uprising is (according to historians such as [[Norman Davies]])is still very difficult due to lack of access to archives in both UK and Russia. For records related to the period, currently both the [[United Kingdom]] archives and [[Russia]]n archives (where the majority of Soviet archives are kept) remain mostly closed to the public. Further complicating the matter is the United Kingdom's claim that they accidentally destroyed the archives of the [[Polish Government in Exile]].<ref>''[[Rising '44. The Battle for Warsaw]]'', [[Norman Davies]], Pan Books, 2004, ISBN 0-330-48863-5, Chapter VII: Stalinist Repression, Page 528, <small>"[[the post Communist Polish Government was]] ''told that the files had been <nowiki>'inadvertently destroyed'</nowiki>''"</small>; Davies refers to http://www.archiwa.gov.pl/kronika as the place a report on the subject should be delivered in 2003, but that link appears dead.</ref>

Swedish [[black metal]] merchants [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]] treated the subject of the Warsaw uprising in their song [[Warschau (song)|Warschau]] (Warsaw spelt in German), featured on the album [[Plague Angel]] focusing on the harsh nazi reprisals and the devastation of the city via weapons like the [[Karl Mortar]]. The title was also used for the subsequent album, simply titled [[Warschau (album)|Warschau]] whose cover pictured a scene of urban desolation.

German [[metalcore]] band [[Heaven Shall Burn]] paid a tribute to the Warsaw Uprising fighters in the song "Armia" from their album [[Deaf to Our Prayers]].

French [[post-punk]] band Varsovie was named after Warsaw city and the influence of the Warsaw Uprising is visible in its creation. The song "Varsovie" is directly related to the insurrection.
