'''Glass-reinforced plastic''' ('''GRP'''), is a [[composite material]] or [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] made of a [[plastic]] reinforced by fine [[glass fibre|fiber]]s made of [[glass]]. Like [[carbon fiber reinforced plastic]], the composite material is commonly referred to by the name of its reinforcing fibers ([[fiberglass]]). The plastic is thermosetting, most often [[polyester]] or [[vinylester]], but other plastics, like [[epoxy]] (GRE), are also used. 

The manufacturing process for fiber glass uses large furnaces to gradually melt the sand/chemical mix to liquid form, then extrude it through bundles of very small orifices (typically 17-25 microns in diameter for E-Glass, 9 microns for S-Glass).  These filaments are then 'sized' with a chemical solution. The individual filaments are then bundled together in large numbers to provide a 'roving'.  The diameter of the filaments, as well as the number of filaments in the roving determine its 'weight'.  This is typically expressed in yield-yards per pound (how many yards of fiber in one pound of material, thus a smaller number means a heavier roving, example of standard yields are 225yield, 450yield, 675yield) or in tex-grams per km (how many grams 1 km of roving weighs, this is inverted from yield, thus a smaller number means a lighter roving, examples of standard tex are 750tex, 1100tex, 2200tex).

These rovings are then either used directly in a composite application such as pultrusion, filament wounding (pipe), gun roving (automated gun chops the glass into small lengths and drops it into a jet of resin, projected onto the surface of a mold), or used in an intermediary step, to manufacture fabrics such as chopped strand mat (CSM) (made of randomly oriented small cut lengths of fiber all bonded together), woven fabrics, knit fabrics or uni-directional fabrics. 

An individual structural glass fiber is both stiff and strong in tension and compression -- that is, along its axis. (Although one might intuitively imagine the fiber to be weak in compression, it is actually only the long aspect ratio of the fiber which makes it seem so; i.e., because a typical fiber is long and narrow, it buckles easily.) On the other hand, the glass fiber is unstiff and unstrong in shear -- that is, across its axis. Therefore if a collection of fibers can be arranged permanently in a preferred direction within a material, and if the fibers can be prevented from buckling in compression, then that material will become preferentially strong in that direction. 

Furthermore, by laying multiple layers of fiber on top of one another, with each layer oriented in various preferred directions, the stiffness and strength properties of the overall material can be controlled in an efficient manner. In the case of glass-reinforced plastic, it is the plastic matrix which permanently constrains the structural glass fibers to directions chosen by the designer. With chopped strand mat, this directionality is essentially an entire two dimensional plane; with woven fabrics or unidirectional layers, directionality of stiffness and strength can be more precisely controlled within the plane. A glass-reinforced plastic component is typically of a thin "shell" construction, sometimes filled on the inside with structural foam, as in the case of surfboards. The component may be of nearly arbitrary shape, limited only by the complexity and tolerances of the mold used for manufacturing the shell.

==Sizing==
A sort of coating, or primer, which both helps protect the glass filaments for processing/manipulation as well as ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix, thus allowing for transfer of shear loads from the glass fibers (which would buckle) to the thermoset plastic (which is quite good at handling shear loads), whithout this 'bonding', the fibers can 'slip' in the matrix and localised failure will ensue.

==Applications==
GRP was developed in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] during the [[Second World War]] as a replacement for the molded plywood used in aircraft [[radome]]s (GRP being [[Transparency (telecommunication)|transparent]] to [[microwaves]]). Its first main civilian application was for building of [[boat]]s, where it gained acceptance in the 1950s. Its use has broadened to the automotive and sport equipment sectors, although its use there is being taken over by [[carbon fiber]] which weighs less per given volume and is stronger both by volume and by weight. GRP uses also include [[hot tub]]s, pipes for drinking water and sewers, office plant display containers and flat roof systems.

Advanced manufacturing techniques such as pre-pregs and fiber rovings extend the applications and the tensile strength possible with fiber-reinforced plastics.

GRP is also used in the [[telecommunications]] industry for [[shroud]]ing the visual appearance of [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]], due to its [[radio frequency|RF]] permeability and low signal [[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]] properties. It may also be used to shroud the visual appearance of other equipment where no signal permeability is required, such as equipment cabinets and [[steel]] support structures, due to the ease with which it can be molded, manufactured and painted to custom designs, to blend in with existing structures or brickwork. Other uses include sheet form made electrical insulators and other structural components commonly found in the power industries.

===Storage tanks===
A wide variety of [[storage tank]]s are made of GRP with capacities up to about 300 tonnes. The smaller tanks can be made with [[chopped strand mat]] cast over a [[thermoplastic]] inner tank which acts as a [[preform]] during construction. Much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fibre with the fibre orientation at right angles to the [[hoop stress]] imposed in the side wall by the contents. They tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner (often [[polypropylene]]) is resistant to a  wide range of strong chemicals. GRP tanks are also used for [[septic tank]]s.

===House building===
Glass reinforced plastics are also used in the house building market for the production of roofing laminate, door surrounds, over-door canopies, window canopies & dormers, chimneys, coping systems, heads with keystones and cills.  The use of GRP for these applications provides for a much faster installation and due to the reduced weight manual handling issues are reduced. With the advent of  high volume manufacturing processes it is possible to construct GRP brick effect panels which can be used in the construction of composite housing. These panels can be constructed with the appropriate insulation which reduces heat loss.

===Piping===

GRP and GRE pipe systems can be used for a variety of applications,
underground as well as above.

==Construction Methods==
===Fiberglass Hand Lay-Up Operation===
First, resin is mixed with a catalyst (e.g. butanox LA) or hardener if working with [[epoxy]], otherwise it won't cure (harden) for days/ weeks. Next, the mold is wetted out with the mixture. The sheets of fiberglass are placed over the mold and rolled down into the mold using steel rollers. The material must be securely attached to the mold, air must not be trapped in between the fiberglass and the mold. Additional resin is applied and possibly additional sheets of fiberglass. Rollers are used to make sure the resin is between all the layers, the glass is wetted throughout the entire thickness of the laminate, and any air pockets are removed. The work must be done quickly enough to complete the job before the resin starts to cure. Various curing times can be achieved by altering the amount of catalyst employed.

===Fiberglass Spray Lay-Up Operation===
The [[fiberglass spray lay-up process]] is similar to the hand lay-up process but the difference comes from the application of the fiber and resin material to the mold. Spray-up is an open-molding composites fabrication process where resin and reinforcements are sprayed onto a mold. The resin and glass may be applied separately or simultaneously "chopped" in a combined stream from a chopper gun. Workers roll out the spray-up to compact the laminate. Wood, foam or other core material may then be added, and a secondary spray-up layer imbeds the core between the laminates. The part is then cured, cooled and removed from the reusable mold.

===Pultrusion Operation===
[[Pultrusion]] is a manufacturing method used to make strong light weight [[composite material]]s, in this case fiberglass.  Fibers (the glass material) are pulled from spools through a device that coats them with a resin.  They are then typically heat treated and cut to length.<ref>http://libertypultrusions.com/pulProcess.htm</ref>  Pultrusions can be made in a variety of shapes or cross-sections such as a W or S cross-section.  The word pultrusion describes the method of moving the fibers through the machinery.  It is pulled through using either a hand over hand method or a continuous roller method.  This is opposed to an [[extrusion]] which would push the material through dies.

==Chopped strand mat==
'''Chopped strand mat''' or '''CSM''' is a form of reinforcement used in glass-reinforced plastic. It consists of [[glass-fibre|glass-fiber]]s laid randomly across each other and held together by a binder. 

It is typically processed using the hand lay-up technique, where sheets of material are placed in a mold and brushed with resin. Because the binder dissolves in resin, the material easily conforms to different shapes when wetted out. After the resin cures, the hardened product can be taken from the mold and finished.

Using chopped strand mat gives a glass-reinforced plastic with [[isotropic]] in-plane material properties.
