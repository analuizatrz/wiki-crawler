'''Acrobatic Rock'n'Roll''' refers to a very sporty, competitive form of [[dance]] that originated from [[lindy hop]]. Unlike lindy hop, however, it is a [[choreographed]] dance designed for performance. It is danced by both couples and groups, either all-female or 4-8 couples together.

== History==

During the development of the musical [[genre]] [[rock and roll]], [[dance]]s to go with the music were also created. From [[swing (dance)|swing]], which came into being around 1920, [[Lindy Hop]] emerged, the first [[partner dance]] ever to feature [[Acrobatics|acrobatic]] elements. Lindy Hop was modified around 1940 to suit faster music, creating the style known as [[boogie woogie (dance)|boogie woogie]]. With rock and roll music coming into fashion around 1955, its adherents converted boogie woogie to the even more athletic rock and roll dance.

A 1959 dance book describes "ROCK-AND-ROLL" as "performed without undue tension, the body and legs being flexible, so that there may be a physical rhythmic expression of co-ordination with the beats of music." "...a dance which leaves much scope for personal expression and interpretation in style, movement, rhythm, and even in the manner in which the figures are constructed." The basic rhythm is Slow, Slow, Quick, Quick. The Slow steps "will be taken first on to the ball of the foot, the heel then lowering".<ref>The Girl's Book of Ballroom Dancing. Vera Wilson. Roy Publishers. 1959. pages 117. 118. LoC# 59-12926</ref>

== Technique and basics ==

The most obvious feature of rock and roll dance are its '''kicks''' (into thin air) and its acrobatic elements like ''lifts'', ''jumps'', ''throws'' and ''flips''. Today's rock and roll is focused on [[show dance|show]] and [[competition dance]] and - with the exception of its name - has nearly nothing in common with the former rock and roll movement. It is danced in pairs or in [[formation dancing|formation]]. Over the years rock and roll dancing has experienced several important changes: the former 6-basic step was converted into the modern tournament's 9-basic step with its typical [[kick ball change]]. Other characteristics are techniques such as the man's [[body wave (dance move)|body wave]] movement, that he uses to fling his partner from a sitting position upwards, and the [[throwing basic]] movement, where she steps onto his hands and is catapulted upwards into neck breaking jumps. Because of its demanding technique, high speed, and acrobatics, rock and roll is a straining high-performance dance and is most often performed by young dancers.

The name of the basic comes from the number of separate actions. With the 6-basic one counts ''(1)step (2)step (3)kick (4)settle (5)kick (6)settle'' or ''(1)kick (2)settle (3)kick (4)settle (5)kick (6)settle'', with the 9-basic it is ''(1)kick (2)ball (3)change (4)kick (5)settle (6)settle (7)kick (8)settle (9)settle.'' This means that a correct rock and roll kick will have the [[ballroom glossary#Supporting foot|supporting foot]] settling on the floor a tiny moment before the kicking foot settles.

== Dance categories==

Dance categories
Youth: No acrobatics allowed. Couples are 12 years old or younger.
Juniors: A maximum of three acrobat moves are allowed under the category's safety regulations. Couples are between 12 and 17 years of age.
B-Class: Two competitions per couple. One is a dance program with no acrobatics allowed. The acrobatic program requires six acrobatic moves. The male may throw the female into the air, but no flips are allowed.
Main Class: Two dances as well, with the dance program allowing no acrobatics. The acrobatic program requires six acrobatics as well, though lifts, jumps, throws and flips are allowed.

== Rhythm and music ==

Rock and roll dance works on the 4/4 measure. One basic comprises six beats and therefore one and a half measures. Differently than the offbeat of rock and roll music, the dance puts stress on the first and third beats of each measure. The music is very fast, between 176 to 208 [[bpm]]. Due to non-offbeat stressing and speed traditional rock and roll music has been replaced by modern disco and pop music.

== Clothes ==

Currently advanced tournament rock and roll dancers don't wear [[petticoats]] and [[jeans]] - as the original rock and roll dancers did - but rather multi-colored costumes that are made of elastic artificial [[fibre]] and can only be purchased as individual pieces by special [[tailor]]s. One reason for that is that acrobatic elements have grown more and more dangerous, requiring both freedom of movement and enough durability to avoid tearing. The most common footwear are light jazz shoes for the dance programs, while the acrobatic programs require more support for the female so sneakers made for aerobic dancers are usually chosen.

== Organization ==

The ''[[World Rock ’n’ Roll Confederation|World Rock’n’Roll Confederation]]'' is the organization that takes care of national and international rules and guidelines for tournaments. They organize the World Cups, European championships and World championships that occur every year for couples and formations. All international competitors are ranked according to points acquired during competitions.

== Famous dancers ==
*[[Roman Kolb]]: The most successful Rock'n'Roll dancer in the history of WRRC, from the [[Czech Republic]]. He holds five World Champion titles (1994-1996; 2001-2002) together with former partners Michaela Vecerova and Katerina Fialova. He has retired from his career as an active dancer and now works as a trainer. During his time as a dancer Kolb combined excellent dancing with groundbreaking acrobatic routines.

*[[Miguel Angueira]]: One of the best Rock'n'Roll dancers of all time from [[France]]. Angueira holds three World Champion titles (1990-1992) together with his former partner Dorothée Blanpain. He has set the standard for aesthetics of Rock'n'Roll for over a decade and still excels due to his elegant dancing and impeccable acrobatic routines. His current partner is Natasha Quoy.
