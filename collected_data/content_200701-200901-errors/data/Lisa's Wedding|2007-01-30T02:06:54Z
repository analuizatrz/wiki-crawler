"'''Lisa's Wedding'''" is the [[Emmy Award]] winning 19th episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 6)|sixth season]].

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
While attending a [[medieval]] festival with the family, Lisa follows a rabbit, which Chief Wiggum refers to as an "esquilax", into the forest and finds a fortune teller. There, Lisa learns of her first love in the year [[2010]]. As a [[university]] student, she meets a [[United Kingdom|British]] man named Hugh St. John Alastair Parkfield and they both fall in love suddenly. While she visits England to meet Hugh's family, Hugh asks Lisa to marry him, and she agrees. When Lisa brings him to meet her family, he is disgusted by their way of life. At the wedding, Hugh tells Lisa that they will return to England and never see her family again after they are wed; "Well, possibly your mother will come when the children are born." Unable to accept the prospect of leaving her family, Lisa calls off the wedding suddenly. Back in the present once more, Lisa returns to the fair and meets up with Homer excitedly, realizing how much she loves him. 

==In the year 2010==
*Homer still works at his old station in sector 7G at the nuclear plant, which now has four [[cooling tower]]s. Milhouse has become Homer's supervisor and the plant is operated mainly by [[robot]]s. Lenny and Carl have advanced into executive positions. (Who seem to be in a meeting with the Germans who bought the plan in [[Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk|Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk]].)
*Bart has married twice and is considering marrying once again. He also has a receding hairline, [[beard|stubble]], just like his father, and works a [[blue-collar]] job (operating a [[wrecking ball]]). He mentions that he's "just getting all his aggression out before I go to law school." (Apparently he fulfills this promise, as in "[[Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie]]" it is revealed he eventually becomes [[Chief Justice of the United States]]). He also apparently frequents [[strip club]]s.
*Blinky now has six eyes. Also there are two new fish additions, one of which is a the head of a horse and the other is the head of Professor Frink.
*Mr. Burns is [[cryogenics|cryogenically-frozen]] while his doctors work on a cure for seventeen stab wounds to the back. The doctors, led by [[Professor Frink]], are currently up to fifteen. (At the [[wedding]], [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] breaks in half due to [[melting|thawing]] too quickly.)
*[[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] is now a digital clock, though apparently stuck on 12:00.
*[[World War III]] occurred, in which [[Great Britain]] saved the [[United States]] from defeat.
*[[Ralph Wiggum]] is a "sideshow" (presumably to [[Krusty the Klown]] in the same manner as [[Sideshow Bob]] and [[Sideshow Mel]]) and was [[arrest]]ed for being a [[celebrity]]. Most celebrities are being arrested and are presumed dangerous. This is seen on a very fast scroll down, and is hard to see unless the viewer slows down the frames. Aside from this, Ralph's fate is quite ambiguous.
*The Simpson house has an additional bedroom built by Homer, who claims it is a window box to the building inspector.
*Mayor Quimby was [[Indictment|indicted]] and has become a [[taxicab|taxi]] driver, using the alias "Mohammed Jafar". He works for a taxi company founded by [[Otto Mann|Otto]] (Established [[2003]]).
*[[Martin Prince]] is presumed dead after a [[science fair]] explosion. He is actually in a lair deep underground and has become akin to [[The Phantom of the Opera]]. He apparently is also in love with Ms. Hoover.
*Early airplane designs (ones with multiple wings) are being used for commercial flights.
*[[Kent Brockman]] works for [[CNN|CN]][[NBC|NB]][[CBS]] (a division of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]).
*[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] has turned into a hard-core [[sexual intercourse|sex]] channel (so slowly that Marge did not notice).
*The [[Rolling Stones]] are still performing, even though they are now in [[wheelchair]]s.
*[[University]] [[campus]]es have [[holographic]] images of [[tree]]s, in memory of real ones. Trees may no longer exist. 
*A new snack called "[[Soy]] Pops" now has more gag suppressant.
*It is hinted that Lisa has lost her [[virginity]] to [[Milhouse van Houten|Milhouse]] (although Marge says this doesn't count, because it was Milhouse).
*Maggie is a teenager with an apparent wild side, as suggested by her [[grunge]]-like style of dress and a [[motorcycle]] trophy on her shelf. Dr. Hibbert refers to her as a "hellion" but says she has a remarkable singing voice (which the audience does not get to hear). Lisa also asks her if she would like to come to her wedding dress fitting that afternoon but Maggie starts trying to talk with her mouth full but Marge prevents her. She still wears her pacifier, as a pendant around her neck.
*Grampa Simpson is not mentioned, and as he is not present at Lisa's wedding it can be assumed that he either died or is unable to attend the wedding.
*Moe now has an [[eyepatch]], possibly from serving during World War III, or a bar fight.
*Both virtual darts and virtual pool exist (as well as many other new technologies), as well as human androids whose heads explode if they begin to cry.
*Nelson has a son who looks a lot like him and has the same characteristic "Ha, ha".
*[[Maude Flanders]] is alive, even though she was killed off in the later episode, "[[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily]]". Some fans [[wikt:postulate|postulate]] that she is a robot. Other explanations could be that the fortune teller isn't '''showing''' Lisa her future, she is '''telling ''' her about it and Lisa is imagining it; when this episode was aired Maude was not dead yet and Lisa was imagining her wedding with everyone she knows present (including Maude). And, that Maude wasn't originally meant to be killed at all in future episodes, as it did all stem from a contract dispute with Maude's voice actress [[Maggie Roswell]].
*Lisa is a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] due to her belief that eating animals is wrong. She would convert to vegetarianism in the episode, "[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]".
*Patty, Selma and Mrs. Krabappel are all still single.

==Trivia==

{{ListGenBot-SourceStart|SimpsonsTrivia|SimpsonsTriviaS06}}
*The first of (to date) three future-themed episodes. The second was "[[Bart to the Future]]" in the 11th season, and "[[Future-Drama]]" in the 16th. 
**While both "Lisa's Wedding" and "Future-Drama" were nominated for an Emmy, [[Entertainment Weekly]] named "Bart to the Future" the worst episode ever.
*[[BBC]] viewers voted for this episode to be shown on "Simpsons Night", broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on [[23 June]], [[2000]]. The other options were "[[Life on the Fast Lane]]", "[[Bart of Darkness]]", "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]", and "[[Homer the Great]]".
*In "[[The Way We Weren't]]", Homer recounts various stupid things he has done in previous episodes, including "ruining Lisa's wedding in the future".
*It is important to note that all the future depictions' canon relevancy should be treated lightly, as they are events that have yet to happen. "[[Future-Drama]]" depicts Bart and Lisa in their final year of [[high school]], but this supposedly takes place three years after 2010. By this, one may speculate that Future-Drama takes place ''before'' this episode. Milhouse´s job at the nuclear plant otherwise wouldn´t make sense.
*Two events are established in the future, that are later shown in later, present time episodes. Lisa becomes a vegetarian ("[[Lisa The Vegetarian]]") and Milhouse's crush on Lisa ("[[Lisa's Date with Density]]").
*There is a running gag throughout the episode that whenever Maggie is about to talk, someone (or something) interrupts her
**When Homer tries to make a call on the videophone, it's busy, and he says "Maggie! won't that girl EVER shut up?!"
*Although Marge tells Lisa that in England a mile is called a kilometer, the vast majority of the English population still use the word mile. Almost all road signs and car [[speedometer]]s in England use miles as their measurement.

*When Hugh proposes to Lisa using the pyrotechnic words, it states "''Lisa, will you do the honor...''", although in England it is spelt ''Honour''.
*There is a deleted scene where Hugh and Lisa talk about the Rolling Stones and don't know if [[Keith Richards]] is alive or dead.
*This episode first aired in [[syndication]] on [[February 26]], [[1996]]. Interestingly, two cut scenes include [[Troy McClure]] and [[Maude Flanders]] in 2010; neither character is still active on the show, but they weren't "killed off" until later.
*Another scene cut for syndication involves a "virtual fight" in the future [[Moe's Tavern]]. A man throws a virtual dart at Bart, who is playing virtual pool. Bart hits the man with his virtual cue; the man hits Bart with a virtual chair. Moe then stops the fight by emitting a high-pitched tone into their headsets.

==Cultural references==

{{ListGenBot-SourceStart|SimpsonsCultural|SimpsonsCulturalS06}}
*Lisa's romance with Hugh is largely based on ''[[Love Story]]''.
*Martin Prince's fate is a parody of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''. The song that he plays on the organ is ''[[A Fifth of Beethoven]]'' by [[Walter Murphy]], a disco version of Beethoven's ''[[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]]'' in C Minor.
*The physical appearance and behavior of Hugh is reminiscent of [[Hugh Grant]], as well as some of his character portrayals in various films.
*The title of the episode may be a title parody of a 1994 Australian film [[Muriel's Wedding]], starring [[Toni Collette]].
*Lisa quotes "I'll tell them to pump in ye old stomach pump" is a reference to an urban legend about [[Mick Jagger]] being rushed to hospital and getting his stomach pumped out of sperm. Other rockstars that may or may not have this procedure done include [[Elton John]], [[Rod Stewart]] and [[Britney Spears]].
