{{Wikipedia:Translation/Hesselberg}}

The '''Hesselberg''' (689 m above sea level) is the highest elevation of [[Middle Franconia]] and the [[Franconian Jura]] and is situated 60 km south western of [[Nuremberg]]. The mountain stands isolated and far away from the center of the Franconian Jura, in its southwestern border region, 4 km to the north west of [[Wassertrüdingen]]. The first traditional name was ''Öselberg'', which derived probably from ''öder Berg'' (bleak mountain). This name later changed to ''Eselsberg'' and finally to the actual name ''Hesselberg''. As an old ''[[Zeugenberg]]'' the mountain provides an informative insight into [[Jurassic]] geology. It is also witness of an eventful history. Many incidents were handed down from generation to generation and — mixed with facts — have become legends. Nowadays many people visit the Hesselberg in order to enjoy nature and the wonderful vista, which — during clear air — enables looking onto the [[alps]] that are 150 km away.

==Shape, location, and dimension==
The mountain has a length of approximately 6 km and an average width of 1 to 2 km. All slopes — excepting the southern side — are covered with [[coniferous forest|coniferous]] or [[mixed forest]]. In the upper part, and especially at the eastern slope of the ''Röckinger mountain'', there are large areas of [[deciduous forest]]. The upper part of the prominent southern side is free of forest. In the southern and in the north eastern slope there are large areas of neglected grassland with their typical [[Juniper]] bushes. The Hesselberg can be divided into 5 sections by its center-line (see panorama image).

*In the western slope there is mainly coniferous forest. Here is the starting point for the geological [[nature trail]].
*The western [[plateau]], also called ''Gerolfinger mountain'', with its [[sinkhole]]-like depressions, [[hedge (barrier)|hedges]] and [[shrub]]s, and a few vistas, has an especially natural appearance. But the depressions are not natural, they are the result of former [[excavation]]. The material was used for road construction and lime burning.
*since 1994 the middle part, the so-called ''Ehinger mountain'', with the main peak and the transmitter tower is accessible again; before there was a restricted military area of the [[United States Army]].
*The touristically most important part is the woodless eastern plateau, which is called ''Osterwiese'' or ''Röckinger mountain''. This section serves as starting place for [[model plane]]s and [[hang-glider]]s, it is also an observation platform, ideal for strolling. On days with especially clear air one can see the alps with the [[Zugspitze]].
*The eastern foothills, that are shrouded in legends, are highly aforested; this section has the name ''Schlössleinsbuck''. This small hill top is also called ''Small Hesselberg''. The ''Röckinger mountain'' and the ''Schlössleinsbuck'' are separated by the ''[[Druid]]'s valley''.

==Origin and geological structure== 
The Hesselberg is among the most important [[geotopes]] in [[Bavaria]]. On September 24<sup>th</sup> 2005 it was awarded the cachet ''Bayerns schönste Geotope'' (Bavarian's most beautiful geotopes) by Georg Schlapp (director of the Bavarian Environmental Protection Office) in the course of a ceremony.

===Jurassic origin===
200 million years ago the [[Jurassic]] sea extended from the [[North Sea]] basin far to the South and covered the [[late Triassic]] land. At that time the Hesselberg region was on the border of that sea. Many [[afflux]]es brought huge masses of [[rubble]] from the eastern mainland and formed a multilayer seafloor, which had a rich [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. During more than 40 million years the different layers of Jurassic rock consecutively deposited: the Black Jurassic ([[early Jurassic|Lias]]) at the bottom, the Brown Jurassic ([[middle Jurassic|Dogger]]) above, and the White Jura ([[late Jurassic|Malm]]) at the top. Each of these layers is characterised by the typical rock and the embedded [[fossil]]s, which are specific for each era. Due to the fact that certain fossils are solely found in certain layers, they are referred to as [[index fossil]]s. In Jurassic rock [[ammonite]]s are the index fossils. In the course of time the Jurassic sea silted up completely. Due to the fact that the Hesselberg is located in the sheltering basin of the Early Jurassic, it was not that much corroded by wind and water as the plain between the mountain and the [[Hahnenkamm (Altmühltal)|Hahnenkamm]]. The hard rock resisted and left the Hesselberg as a distinctive [[Zeugenberg]] rising above the landscape like an island. This kind of mountain-formation is called [[relief inversion]] in [[geology]].

===The rock layers of the mountain===
The information signs of the geological nature trail are descriptivly explaining the origin of the mountain. Each of the three main parts of the Jurassic era is divided into six sub-divisions, which are numbered with [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] [[alpha]] to [[zeta]] ([[Friedrich August Quenstedt|Quenstedt]]'s classification). The rocks that are found in the different layers are assigned to this classification.

====The layers of the Early Jurassic (Lias)====
The dark colors of [[clay]] and [[marl]] give name to the Black Jurassic. This layer is approximately 50 m thick and forms the fertile hilly vicinity of the mountain. Its lowest sub-layers (Lias alpha to gamma) are beneath the surface. The [[Amaltheenton]] (Lias delta) with its 35 m is the thickest sub-layer of the Lias. A special feature is the Posidonia [[schist]] (Lias epsilon), which is 10 m thick. In this sub-layer there are fossils from bigger animals too; for example [[ichthyosaur]]s were found. The cavity of the Posidonia schist, which is at the starting point of the nature trail, is unique and a geological natural monument. Therefore it is prohibited to search for and to collect fossils. On these well visible schist layers lies the Jurassic marl (Lias zeta), which is 2.7 m thick.

====The layers of the Middle Jurassic (Dogger)====
The dark brown colors of the [[weathering|weathered]] upper layers give name to the Brown (or Middle) Jurassic. The colors are a result of high concentrated [[iron]]. The layer of the Dogger with its 135 m forms the main part of Hesselberg's slopes. The lowest sub-layer (Dogger alpha) is the Opalinus-clay, which is 75 m thick. The unevenness of the meadows is the result of landslides; the soil of these part is very susceptible to slides. On top of Opalinus-clay lies a layer of iron [[sandstone]] (Dogger beta), which is 40 m thick. This layer is very distinctive due to its steep climb. Due to the fact that the Opalinus-clay is impervious to water, a [[spring horizon]] has formed at the transition to the iron sandstone. The layers of Dogger gamma ([[Sowerby]] layers) (1 m), Dogger delta ([[Ostreen]]-lime) (4 m), and Dogger epsilon ([[Oolith]]-lime) (2 m) are summarized under the term "ooliths". These layers contain a lot of fossils. On the very top of the Middle Jurassic layers is the Ornate's clay (Dogger zeta), which is only 2 m thick. This small layer forms a terrace around the Hesselberg. On its southern side the buildings of the [[folk high school]] were constructed.

====The layers of the Late Jurassic (Malm)====
The topmost Jurassic layer is named after its light color (White Jurassic). These layers can gain an thickness of 400 m in the Franconian Jura, but at the Hesselberg they are ablated for the most part; only 85 m are conserved. The rocks of the Malm partly are [[sediments]] of the sea, partly they are [[coral reef|reefs]] of ancient [[sea sponge]]s. This rock is widely distributed on the main peak. The light-colored [[lime]] of the White Jurassic was a popular building material for houses ([[Calcium oxide|burnt lime]]) and for road construction ([[rubble]]). The depressions on the western plateau are caused by these excavations. The lowest layers form the [[Impressa]]-layers (low Malm alpha), which are approximately 25 m thick, and the [[Bimammatum]]-lime (high Malm alpha). The old name of the [[Planula]]-lime (Malm beta) is factory lime, which indicates the use as building material. This layer, which is 15 m thick and interspersed with sponge reefs, sets up the plateau of the ''Osterwiese''. The small [[quarry]] below of the main peak consists of Planula-lime in its lower part, and its upper part is showing the [[Ataxiocerate]]'s layer (Malm gamma), which builds up the main peak and is 20 m thick. The top layer of Malm gamma and the layers of Malm delta to Malm zeta are already ablated on the Hesselberg.

==History of colonization and important incidents in the Hesselberg region==
On some parking lots of the touristic region the responsible municipalities mounted illustrated charts, which provide an insight into the history of colonization.

===Pre- and early history===
The first settlers frequented the Hesselberg and used it as shelter and dwelling already in prehistorical ages. Archeological artefacts from the [[Stone Age]] (approx. 10,000 to 2000 [[B.C.]]) were found mainly on the ''Osterwiese''. In the [[Bronze Age]] (approx. 2000 to 1300 B.C.) constant settlement took place. In the [[Urnfield culture|Urnfield time]] (approx. 1200 to 750 B.C.) the colony at the plateaus was surrounded with [[curtain wall]]s, [[moat]]s, and walls. Even today the remains of the border walls, which were 5 km long, around the ''Osterwiese'', the ''Ehinger mountain'', and the ''Gerolfinger mountain'' provide an idea of the importance of these fortifications. Behind of the sheltering brickwork an important political, economic, and religious center evolved. For a long time these constructions were thought to be of [[celt]]ic origin, but only one artefact (the weapons of a warrior) from the [[La Tène culture|La Tène period]] (500 to 15 B.C.) indicates a short visit of the Celts. In the restless [[Migration Period]] and during the [[Middle Ages]] people used the walls of Hesselberg as a shelter and for defensive purposes. In the city museum of [[Oettingen in Bayern|Oettingen]] and in the museum for pre- and early history in [[Gunzenhausen]] there are a lot of exhibits like tools and weapons.

===The Romans===
Under the rules of emperors [[Domitian]] (81 - 96 [[A.D.]]) and [[Hadrian]] (117 - 138 A.D.) the Romans pushed the border of their province [[Raetia]] farther to the North. They expanded the wall of [[Limes Germanicus|Limes]] in order to protect against the [[Germanic peoples]] and equipped it with a lot of watchtowers. In direct vicinity of the Hesselberg big [[Castellum|Castella]] were built. Under the rule of emperor [[Caracalla]] (around 213 A.D.) the last and widest extension of the Limes took place. To the west of the mountain the wall crossed the rivers [[Wörnitz]] and [[Sulzach]] in north-south direction. A few [[kilometer]]s to the north of [[Wittelshofen]] it turned eastward. Due to this sharp bend the strategically important Hesselberg was included in the [[Roman empire]]. There were Castella at [[Aufkirchen]], [[Ruffenhofen]], [[Dambach (Ehingen)|Dambach]], and [[Unterschwaningen]]. The [[Castellum Ruffenhofen]] was the biggest one in the Hesselberg area. [[Archeologist]]s could not prove Roman buildings on the mountain itself. Remains of the Limes can be found as stone ridges hidden in the woods. Nowadays most of the civil and military wall remains are hidden in the ground of meadows and fields. On top of the Castellum Ruffenhofen a Roman park is built. In the local museum of [[Weitlingen]] there are a few Roman exhibits.

===The Alamanni and Franks===
Around 260 A.D. [[Alamanni]]c and Germanic groups entered the region and destroyed the fortifications of the Limes, Castelli, and settlements. The Romans had to shift the border back to the [[Danube]]. The Alamanni founded their first [[grange]]s and farmed the land as farmers and ranchers. Besides town names ending with "''-ingen''" the '''Langstreifengewannflur''' indicates Alamannic foundation. The villages Röck''ingen'', Eh''ingen'', Gerolf''ingen'', Weilt''ingen'', and Irs''ingen'' have their seeds in that period. At the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> century the [[Franks]] emerged from the lower [[Main]] valley and initiated the second wave of colonization. In the years 496 to 506 and under the rule of [[Merovingian]] king [[Clovis I]]. they defeated the [[Swabia]]n Alamanni, which lost their northern territories that formerly reached into the Neuwieder basin, and which were pushed back behind the line [[Oos]]-[[Hornisgrinde]]-[[Asperg]]-Hesselberg; to date this line almost corresponds to the boundary of the Franconian and the Swabian/Alamannic dialect. In spite of the fact that the Franks overrode the Alamanni in a partly violent fashion, mixed settlements (e.g. Ehingen and Röckingen) — with almost always a Franconian mayor — developed in the Hesselberg region. Amongst others the Franks founded the villages Lenters''heim'', Obermögers''heim'', Geils''heim'', Franken''hofen'', and Königs''hofen''. The Franconian peasants established the three-field crop rotation with its [[Flurzwang]], which was practiced until the modern consolidation of farming. In the 7<sup>th</sup> century — under the rule of Merovingian king [[Dagobert I]]. — [[christianization]] started in [[Augsburg]]. In the 8<sup>th</sup> century [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[missionary|missionaries]] founded the monastery of [[Heidenheim (middle Franconia)|Heidenheim]] under Franconian [[Carolingian]] rule.

===Middle Ages===
In early [[Middle Ages]] the Hesselberg region was part of the king's forests. Sparse remains of castles are found on Ehinger mountain and on Schlössleinsbuck. The construction on Ehinger mountain has its seeds in the [[Carolingian]]-[[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] period (8<sup>th</sup>-9<sup>th</sup> century). Discovered tombs are pointing towards a violent end caused by Hungarian soldiers at the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. The [[Hungary|Hungarians]] burnt down the whole castle. The building on Schlössleinsbuck was intended for use as a refuge. In the 11<sup>th</sup> or 12<sup>th</sup> century it was expanded by the [[lord]]s of Lentersheim and adapted as a well-fortified [[knight]]'s castle. One can read about the castle's destruction in the [[family tree]] of the lords of Lentersheim: ''When Conrad of Lentersheim returned from the northern Italian campaigns of king Frederick II. in 1246, his castle was completely destroyed. Thereupon he began building a new castle in Neuenmuhr.'' In fact, soldiers from the Hesselberg region accompanied the mentioned [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] king [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. to Italy in 1239 in order to fight against [[pope Gregory IX]]. Until they died off at the beginning 19<sup>th</sup> century, the lords of Lentersheim lived at their castles in Alten- and Neuenmuhr, today's [[Muhr am See]].

Afterwards direct colonization of the Hesselberg ended. [[Aufkirchen]], which was fortified during medieval times, has a [[city wall]] and four [[city gate]]s. At that time Aufkirchen had [[town privileges]].

===Age of burgraves and margraves===
The age of [[burgrave]]s in Middle Franconia has its origin in [[High Middle Ages]] when king [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]]. feoffed [[Frederick I, Burgrave of Nuremberg|Frederick III.]], who originated from Swabia, with the heritable fiefdom of the [[Nuremberg]] burgrave office in [[1192]]. Frederick III. founded the Frankish line of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] under the name "Burgrave Frederick I. of Nuremberg". Due to clever marriages and trade-offs the Frankish Zollern gained more and more wealth and influence.

In [[1331]] the burgraves moved to Ansbach. In [[1363]] they were elevated to [[sovereign]]s and in [[1417]] they were feoffed with the [[margrave]] of [[Brandenburg]]. Expensive holding of court and persistent conflicts with the imperial city Nuremberg lead to a high level of debt of the young [[principality]]. Therefore they imposed an unbearable burden of taxes upon their subjects. As a consequence, on the 6<sup>th</sup> of May [[1525]] the [[peasant's war]] broke out in southern Franconia as well. On this day rebellious peasants gathered on Hesselberg's peak. Thence they went to [[Wassertrüdingen]] and captured the margrave [[vogt]]. Afterwards they plundered the monastery of [[Auhausen]]. On their way to [[Heidenheim]] the peasants were captured  or killed by margrave soldiers from [[Gunzenshausen]].

During the [[Thirty Years' War]] ([[1618]] - [[1648]]) large areas of today's Middle Franconia were devastated and depopulated. Not until the end of the 17<sup>th</sup> century the economic and financial situation of the margraves improved. They nationalized [[Austria]]n and [[France|French]] religious [[refugee]]s and supported [[Jew]]ish merchants in building up an existence, therefore a lot of Jews settled down in villages around the Hesselberg. Further they ran [[mercantilism|mercantilistic]] politics and expanded the agricultural education. The last margrave [[Christian Frederick Charles Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|Alexander]] handed over the principality — now out of debt — to the [[Prussia]]n in [[1791]].

===The 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> century===
An important date in the mountain's history was the 10<sup>th</sup> of June [[1803]], when the Prussioan king [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick Wilhelm III.]] climbed the Hesselberg during his visit of his Frankish estates. In memory of this event the king endowed the ''Hesselberg-Mass''. In [[1806]] the Hesselberg region was handed over to [[Bavaria]] in the course of an exchange of lands between Bavaria and Prussia: Bavaria received the Prussian principality Ansbach with its Hesselberg and in return Prussia obtained the [[Wittelsbach]]'s [[earldom]] of [[Berg (state)|Berg]] (capital city [[Düsseldorf]]), located at the [[Niederrhein]] (Bavarian-Prussian Contract of Paris, 15<sup>th</sup> of February 1806). In [[1808]] the first [[local code]] provided the basis for the municipal autonomy, which was expanded by the second Bavarian municipal [[edict]] in [[1818]]. Due to that fact a lot of small villages obtained their own administration and received the status of a municipality — by the means of law as juristic persons.

Previous to [[World War II]] Jewish life and culture played an important role in the whole Hesselberg region. Jewish settlers were mentioned in writs already in the 14<sup>th</sup> century. A lot of Jews achieved eminence as merchants and scholars. But the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] raged in villages around the Hesselberg too, they destroyed [[synagoge]]s and expelled or displaced them to [[internment]] camps. [[Julius Streicher]], the head of Frankish Nazi district, established the Hesselberg as a meeting place of the Nazis. After the [[NSDAP]] had taken over in [[1933]] the annual ''Frankish Days'' (held until [[1939]] developed from party manifestations, which were attended by [[Adolf Hitler]] in [[1930]]. Those were the largest manifestations in Franconia besides of the [[Nuremberg rally]]. [[Hermann Göring]] attended the Frankish Days twice as a speaker. Up to 100,000 visitors on the Osterwiese listened to the [[antisemitic]] speeches of Julius Streicher, who aimed at the annihilation of the Jews. At that time the Hesselberg was named ''Heiliger Berg der Franken'' (Holy Mountain of the Franks). No marks of this dark age are left on Hesselberg. The lofty Nazi plans were never put into practice. The construction of the Adolf-Hitler-School was not realised as well as the Julius-Streicher-[[Mausoleum]]. Previous to World War II the Nazis could only finish a administration building with garage. Later this garage was used as a chapel by the refugees that were placed on Hesselberg.

Since [[1951]] the Hesselberg is in the grip of [[Protestant]]s. In this year the Protestant adult education center was founded and the Bavarian Protestant Church Congress took place for the first time. Since then thousands of [[Christians]] gather on [[Whit Monday]] to celebrate this ceremony of faith. Between [[1945]] and [[1992]] the area around the main peak served as a [[radar]] station for the [[US Army]]. In [[1972]] the [[Landkreis]] (district) Dinkelsbühl with the Hesselberg municipalities was closed in the course of the district reform and incorporated into the [[Ansbach (district)|Landkreis Ansbach]]. In the course of latter reforms a lot of small autonome municipalities changed to today's municipalities.

==Hesselberg region today==
===Facilities and events===
The ''Protestant-Lutheran Adult Education Center Hesselberg'' was founded on 14<sup>th</sup> of May 1951; it was the first Bavarian adult education center. The main task is the adult education for the rural [[deaconry]] (family nursing, village assistant, business assistant). On the 15<sup>th</sup> of September [[2005]] it was renamed to ''Protestant Education Center Hesselberg'' (''EBZ Hesselberg'' - ''Evangelisches Bildungszentrum Hesselberg''). The background are the expansion of the education range with its emphases ''"Faith, Rural Space, and Development of Personality"'', according to [[Reverend]] Bernd Reuther, chairman of the new education center. Furthermore guest groups should be addressed with their own education program.

The Protestant-[[Luther]]an deaconry [[Ansbach]] has made a popular youth center out of the old Hesselberg house near the peak.

The most important event is the Bavarian Protestant Church Congress that is well known beyond the region. Each year on [[Whit Monday]] it attracts thousands of Protestants. Traditionally since 1803 the Hesselberg Mass is held on the Osterwiese on the first Sunday in July; at that time king [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and his wife Luise visited the mountain.

The afar visible [[television]] tower with its 119 m is a [[terrestric]] transmitter of the [[ZDF]] and of the ''Bayerisches Fernsehen'' (Bavarian television) for the Franconian region. This tower, which is located at 49° 4' 12" N and 10° 31' 37" E, has an unusual construction: It is a so-called "hybrid tower" and consists of a free-standing steely [[skeleton framing]] base and a wired transmittion tower on top. It also broadcasts the [[very high frequency|UKW]] radio program ''Radio 8''.

Further radio amateurs maintain a small [[relay]] station for [[voice radio]], [[packet radio]], and amateur television. The energy for this station is supplied by [[solar cell]]s and [[wind power]].

===The four municipalities around the mountain===
The borderlines of the four municipalities are crossing the mountain. It is a noteworthiness that the main villages of these municipalities are located at the mountain'S foot, whereas the other municipal parts are starlike situated around these centers. In the north is [[Ehingen]] (approx. 2,100 inhabitants/4,700 [[ha]]). A trail leads through meadows with fruit trees and the aforested northern slope towards the peak. Information signs tell about [[beekeeping]]. In the east is the small municipality [[Röckingen]] (approx. 800 inhabitants/1,091 ha). The predominantly sunny trail towards the Osterwiese leads through a picturesque, umbrageous [[linden]] avenue on its last part. On the southern slope lies [[Gerolfingen]] (approx. 1,100 inhabitants/1,300 ha) with a road to the parking lots on Hesselberg. A trail leads from Gerolfingen through meadows with fruit trees and a beautiful [[chestnut]] avenue, whose older part was complemented with new plantations in autumn [[2004]]. To Gerolfingen belongs the village [[Aukirchen]] with its historical town-hall and the afar visible [[St. John]]s Church. In the west is [[Wittelshofen]] (approx. 1,300 inhabitants/2,422 ha), at the confluence of [[Wörnitz]] and [Sulzach]] rivers. The town is the starting point of the geological nature trail.

Together with the municipality [[Unterschwaningen]] these four municipalities build up the administrative collectivity Hesselberg.

===Recreational region Hesselberg===
The Hesselberg municipalities [[Ehingen]], [[Gerolfingen]], [[Röckingen]], and [[Wittelshofen]] aligned with the municipalities [[Dürrwangen]], [[Langfurth]], [[Mönchsroth]], [[Unterschwaningen]], [[Wassertrüdingen]], [[Weiltingen]], and [[Wilburgstetten]] on 31<sup>st</sup> of January [[1973]] to form the ''Fremdenverkehrsverband Hesselberg e.V.'' (Tourist Association Hesselberg e.V.). Since then Dürrwangen has left the association. On the occasion of its 30 year existence the ''Fremdenverkehrsverband Hesselberg e.V'' changed its name to ''Touristikverband Hesselberg e. V.''. Its headquarter is in Wassertrüdingen. The term ''recreational region Hesselberg'' refers to the area of these member municipalities. The German Limes road leads through this region from the West to the East. The ''Entwicklungsgesellschaft Region Hesselberg mbH'' (Development Incorporation of Hesselberg Region) was founded on 5<sup>th</sup> of October [[1999]]. It is a federation of further municipalities, which extends far beyond the borders of the Hesselberg region. The tasks and spheres of influences of the incorporation are very global and contain amongst others economy, culture, and tourism. The main office resides at castle Unterschwaningen.

The huge amount of meadows with fruit trees leads to the formation of the ''Interessengemeinschaft Moststraße'' (Community of Interest [[Must]]-Road) by several [[commune]]s. For better marketing of products obtained from fruit and as a new tourist attraction the Must-Road around Hesselberg is planned for the next years.

On and around Hesselberg are a lot of trails. The two most important ones inform the hiker with the use of many information signs. The geological nature trail, which is 3 km long, leads from its starting point near Wittelshofen to the mountain's peak. It tells about the geological origin of the mountain and its structure. The Hesselberg-trail is a loop road on Hesselberg heights and informs about general noteworthinesses. Both trails are well combinable. The Osterwiese is meeting point for [[model plane]]rs. The starting points for [[hang-glider]]s and [[paraglider]]s can be found there too. In nearby Irsingen is the regional [[gliding]] airfield. The [[sporting clays]] was inhibited by the Nature Conservation Agency due to the [[lead]] exposure. The Tourist Office Hesselberg , the ''Bund Naturschutz in Bayern'' (Bavarian Nature Conservation Alliance) (district group Ansbach), and the ''Landesbund für Vogelschutz in Bayern'' (Bavarian State Bird Conservation Alliance) (district group Ansbach) organise guided excursions and walking tours. At the mountain's foot anglers can indulge their passion at rivers Wörnitz and Sulzach. The [[German Alpine Association]] (Hesselberg section with office in [[Bechhofen]]) built a small hut on the northern slope in order to support winter sports.

===Landscape conservation===
[[Pasturing]] with sheep (herding areas) is inevitable for the conservation of the semidry and dry meadows. However, scrub encroachment with [[blackthorne]], [[rose]], [[juniper]], and [[ash]] is strongly increased at many places of the mountain in spite of working sheep herding by two sheep farms (northern side: approx. 600 [[ewe]]s, southern side: approx. 1000 ewes). Without additional mechanical maintenance the worthwhile open space of the mountain cannot be left open for a long term. Since [[1997]] the municipality Ehingen strikes out in new directions to deal with the conservation of these vast herding areas on Hesselberg's northern slope. As a collaboration with the ''Landschaftspflegeverband Mittelfranken'' (Landscape Conservation Association Middle Franconia) and the shepherd Hans Goth important "descrubbing" and maintenance tasks are performed in the course of annual civil campaigns. Under the phrase "One day for the mountain" a lot of teenagers, seniors, farmers, and non-farmers pilgrimage to the mountain on a certain day in autumn and work together. Within four hours of working time, interrupted by a short snack and finished with lunch, the work is done together. On average there are voluntarily working 40 people in Ehingen. This active support of the sheep farm by the citizen (by the means of the "descrubbing" the pasturing conditions are significantly improved) has manifold functions:
*Novel working methods in the field of landscape and nature conservation
*Active support of the sheep farm Goth by the community (board cost, use of the municipal tractors, etc.) and by the citizen encourages vicinity and reduces prejudices.
*Exemplary activity for conservation of flora and fauna (=active landscape and nature conservation) within the close-by cultural landscape (reinforcement of the identification with the homeland)
*Social-communicative aspects: The participants are farmers and non-farmers. With their participation awareness of the problems of land use is raised also within people that have nothing to do with agriculture.
*Shared work, shared snack and lunch bring together the participants.
*Participants of different age groups (the participants are 16 to 70 years old) are brought together and prejudices are reduced ("Today's youth isn't interested in anything").
*With its volunteers the municipality is independent from state subventions.
*Since [[2001]] Hesselberg municipalities Röckingen and Gerolfingen are following this positive and successful example. They also hold activity days under the flag of "One day for the mountain".

==Flora and Fauna==
Due to its multilayer condition concerning rock, soil, climate, and cultivation, the Hesselberg has bred a very versatile [[vegetation]] with some partly particular plant communities.

===Vegetation of the neglected grassland===
An important task of the landscape maintenance is the conservation of the dry and non-forest neglected meadows and dry meadowy slopes. Botanists named this type of vegetation ''Magerrasen'' (neglected grassland). There the ground is covered with thin dry grass. A typical feature are the irregularly widespread [[juniper]] bushes. Far more than 40 different species of flowering plants are growing on this nutrient-poor, non-fertilized soil. Often different small species of [[gentian]] can be found. In late summer [[pasque flower|pasqueflower]] and [[Carlina acaulis|Carline thistle]] show their most beautiful bloom. From April until June [[orange tip]]s fly over the sunny slopes. One of the most important tasks for conservating the neglected grassland is traditional [[herding]]. Pasturing with [[sheep]] is a prerequisite for long-lasting conservation of this grassland. If herding would be (partly) dismissed, initially more thorny and needle-bearing shrubs would grow, because they are eschewed by sheep. This is also the reason why there are a lot of juniper bushes. Under cover of these thornbushes and hedges other groves and the first trees could develop. In the final stage the mountain would become mostly overgrown with forest. In contrast, the healthy herbs and grasses of the neglected grassland have a positive influence on the quality of the sheep's meat. Due to this fact the gastronomy of Hesselberg region offers more and more dishes of the ''Hesselberg lamb''.

===Meadows, hedges, and wells===
[[Image:Jynx torquilla.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Eurasian Wryneck|wryneck]]]]
Really the opposite of the nutrient-poor neglected grassland are the fruitful meadows and fields of the Early Jurassic soil in Hesselberg's vicinity. This region is traditionally agriculturally used. On its fields [[wheat]], [[rye]], [[oat]], [[root vegetable|beetroot]], and [[Maize|corn]] are cultivated. On the farms [[Domestic pig|Pigs]] and [[cattle]] are raised and [[dairy farming]] is performed.

In the lower and middle parts of the slopes old and non-fertilized meadows with fruit trees offer a blaze of color of different flowers. With their high trunks the fruit groves provide the optimal habitat for a diversity of small animals, birds, and plants. The [[Eurasian Wryneck|wryneck]] is one of the typical inhabitants of these meadows, because he avoids bleak areas as well as dense forests. Just of the same importance for the small animals, birds, and plants are the various hedges and shrubs, which can be found everywhere on and around Hesselberg. In our cultural landscape hedges have the largest variety of microstructures. In addition to the groves there are a herb layer — rich of species —, a sunny herb fringe, [[coarse woody debris]], and maybe special [[biotop]]s, e.g. a huddle of stones. Because of the transition from water-permeable to inpermeable rock layers several spring horizons have emerged, explaining the richness of the springs. On Hesselberg there are several falling wells, but most springs appear in the form of flat [[swamp]]s. The special flora and fauna of the wells is not offhand obvious, because most of the organisms are only visible in the [[microscopic]]al range. A very rare plant of these wetlands is the [[sundew]].

===Biodiversity of the forest===

On Hesselberg all forms ([[high forest]], [[coppice-with-standards]], [[coppice]]) and types ([[temperate coniferous forest]], [[mixed forest]], [[deciduous forest]]) of forests can be found. The strangest appearance has the coppice in the upper regions of the northern slope. After [[coppicing]] a lot of light is shed on the ground, then thermophile animals, e.g. the [[Sand Lizard]], feel specially good. Later, when the roof of leaves closes again, a lot of other specialized animals (e.g. the [[Eurasian woodcock]]) find a suitable habitat. All forms of [[game]] that are typical for German forests (amongst others [[European hare|hare]], [[Roe deer|roe]], [[red fox]], and [[Tree squirrel|squirrel]]) are present in Hesselberg's woods. The drumming of [[Picidae|woodpeckers]] and the crying of [[Common cuckoo|cuckoos]] contribute to the mood of the wood as well as the singing of numberless birds. Various [[Ranunculaceae]] — like [[Hepatica|liverworts]] and [[Anemone nemorosa|wood anemones]] — are signs of spring of Hesselberg's forests. In May [[ramsons]] turn the ground of the deciduous forest into a green and white bloomy carpet. After its bloom the intense odor of garlic fills the air. The various species of [[orchid]]s, like the [[Red Helleborine]], became more rare. The [[Lilium martagon|Turk's-cap lily]], which belongs to the [[Liliaceae|Lily family]], can relatively often be found yet. Of special interest is the diversity of that flower, which is in need of protection. The [[erica]] and the [[Cytisus scoparius]] prefer the iron sandstone layers of the lower parts of the slopes.
