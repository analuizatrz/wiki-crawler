The '''FIFA World Cup''', occasionally called the '''Football World Cup''' or '''Soccer World Cup''', but usually referred to simply as the '''World Cup''', is an international [[association football]] competition contested by the [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] of the members of ''Fédération Internationale de Football Association'' ([[FIFA]]), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]], except in 1942 and 1946, due to [[World War II]].

The tournament consists of two parts, the [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification phase]] and the final phase (officially called the ''World Cup Finals''). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely-viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the [[2006 FIFA World Cup#Final|2006 tournament final]].<ref name="2006coverage">[http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/ffprojects/ip-401_06e_tv_2658.pdf 2006 FIFA World Cup TV Coverage] (PDF), FIFA.com. Retrieved on [[June 6]], [[2007]].</ref>

In the eighteen tournaments held, only seven nations have won the title. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] is the most successful World Cup team, having won the tournament five times. The current World Champions, [[Italy national football team|Italy]], follows with four titles, while [[Germany national football team|Germany]] holds three. The other former champions are [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] (who won the inaugural tournament) and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] with two titles each, and [[England national football team|England]] and [[France national football team|France]] with one title each.

The [[2006 FIFA World Cup|most recent World Cup Finals]] were held in [[Germany]], where [[Italy national football team|Italy]] was crowned champion after beating [[France national football team|France]] in the final. The [[2010 FIFA World Cup|next World Cup Finals]] will be held in [[South Africa]], from [[June 11]] [[2010]] to [[July 11]] [[2010]], and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 Finals]] will be held in [[Brazil]].

==History==
{{main|History of the FIFA World Cup}}

===Previous international competitions=== 
The world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]],<ref>[http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html England National Football Team Match No. 1], England Football Online. Retrieved on [[November 19]], [[2007]].</ref> with the first international tournament, the inaugural edition of the [[British Home Championship]], taking place in 1884.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.soccerway.com/news/2007/November/22/british-pm-backs-return-of-home-nations-championship | title = British PM backs return of Home Nations championship | publisher = Agence France-Presse| accessdate =December 16 |accessyear=2007}}</ref>  At this stage the sport was rarely played outside [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. As football began to increase in popularity in other parts of the world at the turn of the century, it was held as a [[demonstration sport]] (with no medals awarded) at the [[Football at the 1900 Summer Olympics|1900]] and [[Football at the 1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Summer Olympics]], and at the [[Football at the 1906 Summer Olympics|1906 Intercalated Games]]; football became an official competition at the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Summer Olympics]]. Planned by [[The Football Association]] (FA), the event was for [[amateurism|amateur]] players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the [[England national amateur football team]]) won the event in both 1908 and [[Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912]].

After [[FIFA]] was founded in 1904, there was an attempt made by FIFA to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside of the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/historyfifa2.html History of FIFA - FIFA takes shape], FIFA.com. Retrieved on [[November 19]], [[2007]].</ref>

With the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, [[Thomas Lipton|Sir Thomas Lipton]] organized the [[Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy]] tournament in [[Turin]] in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as ''The First World Cup'',<ref>[http://www.shrewsbury.gov.uk/Public/news/thomaslipton.htm 'The First World Cup'. The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy]. Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council (10 October 2003). Retrieved on [[April 11]], [[2006]].</ref> and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]], but [[The Football Association]] of [[England]] refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited [[West Auckland Town F.C.|West Auckland]], an amateur side from [[County Durham]], to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title, and were given the trophy to keep forever, as per the rules of the competition. 

In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic tournament]] as a "world football championship for amateurs", and took responsibility for managing the event.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/historyfifa3.html History of FIFA &mdash; More associations follow], FIFA.com. Retrieved on [[November 19]], [[2007]].</ref> This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition, at the [[Football at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Summer Olympics]], contested by [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] and thirteen European teams. The [[gold medal]]s were won by [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].<ref>Reyes, Macario (18 October 1999). [http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/ol1920f-det.html VII.

In 1928 FIFA made the decision to stage their own international tournament outside of the Olympics. With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions (as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era) and to celebrate their [[centenary]] of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country.

The [[1932 Summer Olympics]], held in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], did not plan to include football as part of the schedule due to the low popularity of [[Soccer in the United States|football in the United States]], as [[American football]] had been growing in popularity. FIFA and the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] also disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the Games.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=8229/news/newsid=92851.html The Olympic Odyssey so far...

The national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/historyfifa4.html History of FIFA - The first FIFA World Cup], FIFA.com.

In total 13 nations took part — seven from [[South America]], four from [[Europe]] and two from [[North America]]. 

The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by [[France national football team|France]] and [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], who beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 4&ndash;1 and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] 3&ndash;0 respectively.

===Growth===
The issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] tournaments, with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] the only South American team to compete in both. The [[1942 FIFA World Cup|1942]] and 1946 competitions were cancelled due to [[World War II]] and its aftermath.

The [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] was the first to include British participants. [[Home Nations|British teams]] withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against a foreign influence on football,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0001/index.shtml |title=Scotland and the 1950 World Cup |publisher=BBC |accessdate=May 13 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> but rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation.<ref>{{cite book |last= Glanville|first= Brian| title= The Story of the World Cup | page=44|publisher= Faber |date= 2005 |id= ISBN 0-571-22944-1}}</ref> The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again in one of the most famous matches in World Cup history, which was later called the "[[Maracanazo]]".

[[Image:World cup appearances.png|250px|right|thumb|Map of countries' number of appearances]]

In the tournaments between 1934 and [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], 16 teams competed for each finals tournament, except in 1938, when [[Austria national football team|Austria]] were absorbed into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when [[India national football team|India]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams.<ref>Glanville, p45</ref> Most of the participating nations were from [[Europe]] and [[South America]], with a small minority from [[North America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], semi-finalists in 1930; [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]], quarter-finalists in 1938; [[Korea DPR national football team|Korea DPR]], quarter-finalists in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]; and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], quarter-finalists in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]].

The finals were expanded to 24 teams in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]],<ref>Glanville, p238</ref> then to 32 in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]],<ref>Glanville, p359</ref> allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. The one exception is Oceania, who have never had a guaranteed spot in the finals. In recent years, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, and those who have reached the quarter-finals include: [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], quarterfinalists in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]; [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], quarter-finalists in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]]; [[Korea Republic national football team|Korea Republic]], finishing in fourth place in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]; and [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] and [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], both quarter-finalists in 2002. However, European and South American teams have remained the stronger forces. For example, the quarter-finalists in 2006 were all from Europe or South America.

198 nations attempted to qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], and a record 204 will attempt to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/organisation/media/newsid=122766.html#record+number+teams+enter+preliminary+competition Record number of 204 teams enter preliminary competition], FIFA.com.

===Other FIFA tournaments===
An equivalent tournament for [[women's football (soccer)|women's football]], the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]], was first held in [[FIFA Women's World Cup 1991|1991]] in the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/womenworldcup/index.html FIFA Women's World Cup], FIFA.com. Retrieved on [[December 22]], [[2007]].</ref> The women's tournament is smaller in scale and profile than the men's, but is growing; the number of entrants for the 2007 tournament was 120, more than double that of 1991.

Unlike many other sports (and even women's football), the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|men's football tournament at the Olympics]] is not a top-level tournament, but an under-23 tournament with each team allowed three overage players since 1992.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/regulations_olympics_beijing_2008_en_6198.pdf Regulations Men's Olympic Football Tournament 2008] (PDF), FIFA.com.

The [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] is a tournament held one year before the World Cup Finals at the World Cup host nation(s) as a dress-rehearsal for the upcoming World Cup. It is contested by the winners of each of the six FIFA confederation championships, along with the FIFA World Cup champion and the host country.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/confederationcup/index.html FIFA Confederations Cup], FIFA.com.

FIFA also organizes international tournaments for youth football ([[FIFA U-20 World Cup]], [[FIFA U-17 World Cup]], [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]], [[FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup]]), club football ([[FIFA Club World Cup]]), and football variants such as [[futsal]] ([[FIFA Futsal World Cup]]) and [[beach soccer]] ([[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]]).

==Trophy==
:{{main|FIFA World Cup Trophy}}
[[Image:Wohlfahrtsbriefmarke-fifa.jpg|right|thumb|The [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] on a German [[Postage stamp|stamp]]]]
From 1930 to 1970, the ''[[FIFA World Cup Trophy#Jules Rimet Trophy|Jules Rimet Trophy]]'' was awarded to the World Cup winner. It was originally simply known as the ''World Cup'' or ''Coupe du Monde'', but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president [[Jules Rimet]] who set up the first tournament. In [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983, and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/worldcup/julesrimettrophy.html Jules Rimet Trophy], FIFA.com. Retrieved on [[November 19]], [[2007]].</ref>

After 1970, a new trophy, known as the ''[[FIFA World Cup Trophy#FIFA World Cup Trophy|FIFA World Cup Trophy]]'', was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven different countries, evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer [[Silvio Gazzaniga]]. The new trophy is {{convert|36|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} high, made of solid 18 [[carat (purity)|carat]]  (75%) gold and weighs {{Convert|6.175|kg|1|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The base contains two layers of semi-precious [[malachite]] while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]]. The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: "The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory."<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/worldcup/trophies.html FIFA World Cup Trophy], FIFA.com. Retrieved on [[November 19]], [[2007]].</ref>

This new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently, irrespective of how many World Cups they win. World Cup winners retain the trophy until the next tournament and are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/marketingtv/marketing/fifaassets/trophy.html FIFA Assets – Trophy], FIFA.com. Retrieved on [[November 19]], [[2007]].</ref> Argentina, Germany (as West Germany), Italy and Brazil have all won the second trophy twice, while France has won it once. It will not be retired until the name plaque has been entirely filled with the names of winning nations in 2038.

For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams, but also subject to lobbying from the confederations.   
 
The qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental [[play-off]]s. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone will enter a play-off for a spot in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/print?id=468907&type=story&cc= | title=2010 World Cup Qualifying | work=ESPN | date=[[November 26]], [[2007]] | accessdate=December 23 |accessyear=2007 }}</ref> From the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] onwards,<ref>{{cite web |

===Final tournament===
{{for|the various formats used in previous tournaments|History of the FIFA World Cup#Format of each final tournament}}

The current finals tournament features 32 national teams competing over a month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: a ''group stage'' followed by a ''knockout stage''.

In the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeded]] (including the hosts, with the other teams selected using a formula based on both the [[FIFA World Rankings]] and performances in recent World Cups) and drawn to separate groups. The other teams are assigned to different "pots", usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4356050.stm |title=England seeded for 2006 World Cup |work=BBC |date=[[December 6]], [[2005]] |accessdate=December 24|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Each group plays a [[round-robin tournament]], guaranteeing that every team will play at least three matches. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among the teams.  The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage.  Points are used to rank the teams within a group.  Since [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[Three points for a win|three points have been awarded for a win]], one for a draw and none for a loss (prior to this, winners received two points rather than three).  If two or more teams end up with the same number of points, [[tiebreaker]]s are used: first is [[goal difference]], then total goals scored, then head-to-head results, and finally drawing of lots (i.e. determining team positions at random).<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/fifa%5fwc%5fsouth%5fafrica%5f2010%5fregulations%5fen%5f14123.pdf Regulations of the 2010 FIFA World Cup] (PDF), (page 40&ndash;41), FIFA.com. Retrieved on [[November 19]], [[2007]].</ref>

The knockout stage is a [[single-elimination tournament]] in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with [[extra time]] and [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the "round of 16" (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the [[third place playoff|third-place match]] (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.<ref name="FIFAformat">{{cite web |

Early World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The choice of location gave rise to controversies, a consequence of the three-week boat journey between [[South America]] and [[Europe]], the two centres of strength in football. The decision to hold the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|first World Cup]] in [[Uruguay]], for example, led to only four European nations competing.<ref>{{ cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632201.stm |title=Uruguay 1930 |publisher=BBC |date=[[April 11]], [[2002]] |accessdate=May 13 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these, the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], in [[France]] was controversial, as the American countries had been led to understand that the World Cup would rotate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the tournament.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632206.stm France 1938], BBC. ([[April 17]], [[2002]]). Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref> 

Since the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]], to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the [[Americas]] and Europe, which continued until the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. The [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], hosted jointly by [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]], was the first one held in [[Asia]], and the only tournament with multiple hosts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/news/2002/06/03/au_asia_rb/ |title=Asia takes World Cup center stage |date=[[June 3]], [[2002]] |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 1 |accessyear=2008}}</ref> In [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[South Africa]] will become the first [[Africa]]n nation to host the World Cup.

The host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Executive Committee. This is done under a [[single transferable vote]] system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a "Hosting Agreement" from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the Cup is currently made six or seven years in advance of the tournament.

For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament is rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the [[FIFA World Cup hosts#2006 FIFA World Cup|controversy]] surrounding [[Germany]]'s victory over South Africa in the vote to host the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 tournament]]. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/administration/releases/newsid=625122.html#rotation+ends+2018 |title=Rotation ends in 2018 |publisher=FIFA.com |accessdate=October 10 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.

Mascots for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] were ''[[Goleo]]'', a [[lion]], and ''[[Pille]]'', a [[football (ball)|football]].<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/marketingtv/marketing/fifaassets/mascots.html FIFA Assets – Mascots], FIFA.com.

|<ref name="wc1950">There was no official World Cup final match in 1950. The tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). However, Uruguay's 2-1 victory over Brazil (a match known as [[Maracanazo]]) was the decisive match (and also coincidentally one of the last two matches of the tournament) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is often considered the "final" of the 1950 World Cup. [http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-301_09a_wc-finals_alltime_8864.pdf] (PDF) Likewise, Sweden's 3-1 victory over Spain (played at the same time as Uruguay vs Brazil) ensured that they finished third.</ref>

[[Image:World cup winners.png|250px|right|thumb|Map of winning countries]]
In all, 78 nations have [[National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup|appeared at least once in the World Cup finals tournament]].<ref>If the records of the national teams of Czechoslovakia/Czech Republic, Yugoslavia/Serbia and Montenegro/Serbia, and USSR/Russia are combined together respectively, 75 national teams have appeared in at least one World Cup. {{cite web|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/NATIONS/maraton.html|title = Planet World Cup - All time table|publisher=Planet World Cup|accessdate=January 26|accessyear=2008}}</ref> Of these, only 11 have made it to the final match, and only seven have won. The seven national teams that have won the World Cup have added [[Star (football crest)|stars to the crest]], located on their shirt, with each star representing a World Cup victory.

With five titles, Brazil is the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have [[National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup#Ranking of teams by number of appearances|participated in every World Cup finals tournament]] to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/teams/brazil/|title=Brazil |publisher=CNN |accessdate=December 29 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> Italy follows with four titles, including the most recent one in 2006. Brazil and Italy are also the only nations to have won consecutive titles.

Below is a list of the 11 teams that have played in a World Cup final. Brazil and Germany each finished as either winners or runners-up seven times.

===Performances by host nations===
{{seealso|National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup#Results of host nations}}

Six of the seven champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland, the exception being [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], who lost the deciding match (known as [[Maracanazo]]) when they hosted the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] tournament.

[[England national football team|England]] ([[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]) and [[France national football team|France]] ([[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]) won their only titles while playing as host nations. [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] ([[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]), [[Italy national football team|Italy]] ([[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]) and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] ([[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]]) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again, while [[Germany national football team|Germany]] ([[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]]) won their second cup title on home soil.

Other nations have also been successful when hosting the tournament. [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] (runners-up in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]), [[Chile national football team|Chile]] (third place in [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]]), [[Korea Republic national football team|Korea Republic]] (fourth place in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]), [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] (quarterfinals in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]) and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] (second round in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]) all have their best results when serving as hosts. All host nations have progressed beyond the first round.

===Best performances by continental zones===
{{seealso|National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup#Results by confederation}}

To date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by [[UEFA|European]] and [[CONMEBOL|South American]] teams. The two continents have won nine titles apiece. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]] ([[CONCACAF|North, Central America and Caribbean]]) in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] and [[Korea Republic national football team|Korea Republic]] ([[Asian Football Confederation|Asia]]) in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]. The best result of an [[Confederation of African Football|African]] team is reaching the quarter-finals: [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] in 2002. [[Oceania Football Confederation|Oceania]] has only been represented in the World Cup three times, and an Oceanian team has reached the second round on only one occasion, when [[Australia national football (soccer) team|Australia]] progressed beyond the group stage in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]].

All World Cups won by European teams have taken place in Europe. The only non-European team to win in Europe is [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]. Only twice had consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent &mdash; when [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and Brazil successfully defended their titles in [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] and [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]] respectively.
