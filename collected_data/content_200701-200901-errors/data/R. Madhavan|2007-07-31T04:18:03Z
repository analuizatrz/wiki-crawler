==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Madhavan was born in Jamshedpur, India, to a private-firm owner Ranganathan and bank worker Saroja. In [[1988]], Madhavan was chosen to represent India as its cultural ambassador from his college after his graduation. At 22, he was awarded the [[Maharashtra]] Best Cadet, allowing him to make a trip with three others as NCC Cadets to [[Papua New Guinea]]. Because of this honour, he received training with the Royal Army, the Navy and the Air Force, which he previously planned to join. However he was rejected from the opportunity, as he missed the age cut-off by six months. After he lost out on the place, he began taking courses in public speaking which eventually helped him venture into the film industry.

===Early career=== 
In early [[1997]], Madhavan did an underwear advertisement for [[Santosh Sivan]], who later recommended him to [[Mani Ratnam]] for a screen test for a role in ''[[Iruvar]]''. Later in the same year, Mani Ratnam called Madhavan for the screen test, but left him out of the project citing that he thought his eyes looked too funny for a senior role. As his film career, failed to take off, Madhavan reverted to act in Hindi television serials. He appeared in minor roles in serials titled ''Saaya'', ''Sea Hawks'', ''Banegi Apni Baat'' and ''Ghar Jamai''.

In [[1998]], Madhavan appeared in his first film role as an Indian police officer in [[Fred Olen Ray]]'s ''[[Inferno (1997 film)|Inferno]]'' alongside [[Don Wilson]]. His first chance in [[Indian]] movies came in the form of ''[[Relax (film)|Shanti Shanti Shanti]]'', a [[Kannada]]n film, in which he acted in the second lead role to [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]], an established actor. However the film failed to make an impact, and went unnoticed.

Bollywood director, Vinod Pandey launched Madhavan as a [[Bollywood]] hero, with a project titled ''Lakheli'', however the film was abandoned by the producers soon after production began and the film was cancelled.

===Critical success===
''[[Alaipayuthey]]'', Madhavan's second [[India]]n film became a blockbuster upon release and earned positive reviews from critics. Several critics branded Madhavan as lucky, for being launched as an actor under one of [[Tamil cinema]]'s finest directors, [[Mani Ratnam]]. In ''[[Alaipayuthey]]'', paired with [[Shalini Kumar]], he portrayed to role of "Karthik", Karthik (Madhavan) is frantic after the disappearance of his wife Shakti (Shalini). Told in flashbacks, the film traces their brief marriage as the couple's dreamy romance runs through the usual gamut of highs and lows. Karthik and Shakthi fall in love against the backdrop of Madras and its suburban trains and get married against the wishes of their parents. Most of the second half of the film deals with the tensions and discontent of married life as contrasted with the exuberance of romantic love.  Madhavan's performance was well-received by critics and the film became a [[cult]] hit, leaving way to several spoofs of his character. A critic, Balaji Balasubramaniam of ''BBreviews.com'' claimed that "Madhavan is promising in his debut feature and his character is designed to set hearts aflutter", praising Madhavan and his characterization.

After the success of his first [[Tamil film]], the producers of his previous [[Kannada]]n film, ''Shanti Shanti Shanti'', dubbed the film into Tamil and released it as ''[[Relax (film)|Relax]]'', to capitulate on Madhavan's new found success. Madhavan's second lead role was in ''[[Ennavale]]'', a film ignored by critics and audience alike. Madhavan's choice to be a part of this film, was unappreciated and one critic claimed, "With Madhavan being hot property in [[Kodambakkam]] ever since ''[[Alaipayuthey]]'', his second movie was highly anticipated. But unless he selects stories and scripts that are much better than Ennavale, his stay might be a short-lived one." Madhavan had more success starring opposite [[Reema Sen]] in ''[[Minnale]]'', which was later remade into [[Hindi]] as ''[[Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein]]'' marking Madhavan's debut in [[Bollywood]]; he also played in [[Madras Talkies]]' ''[[Dumm Dumm Dumm]]'' with [[Jyothika Saravanan]]. Both films became successes and Madhavan became established as a bankable actor in [[South India]]. Madhavan later starred in ''[[Parthale Paravasam]]'', the hundreth venture of veteran director, [[K. Balachandar]]. Madhavan, in the film, acted as a husband in troubling marriage, again, after ''[[Alaipayuthey]]''. Despite being highly anticipated, the film flopped at the box-office, with critics labelling that Madhavan looked "rather bored" with the proceedings.

Following ''Parthale Paravasam'', Madhavan starred opposite [[Simran Bagga]] in his third [[Mani Ratnam]] production, ''[[Kannathil Muthamittal]]''. He portrayed the role of a father of a girl, who wishes to return to her native homeland amid a [[civil war]]. The film, became a trend-setting film in [[Tamil cinema]] and managed to six [[National Film Awards|National Awards]] as well as over ten awards at various International Film Festivals around the world. Madhavan gained a particular praise for putting in a mature display. Madhavan's next large success came in ''[[Run (film)|Run]]'', a film recognized for its screenplay, Madhavan appeared as an action hero for the maiden time in his career.

The success of ''Run'', became Madhavan's final major hit for a while, several films of his were critically acclaimed but failed to perform commercially. ''[[Anbe Sivam]]'', co-starring [[Kamal Haasan]], was critically praised but failed to become a grosser. Several critics claimed that Madhavan's performance as a frustrated ad-maker, lived up to the title role of [[Kamal Haasan]]'s. [[Kamal Haasan]]'s home production, ''[[Nala Damayanthi]]'' and [[Vikraman]]'s ''[[Priyamana Thozhi]]'', failed to live up to their anticipated values but Madhavan's performance in the films were appreciated. A guest role followed in ''[[Lesa Lesa]]'', and two more average films in ''[[Jay Jay]]'' and ''[[Aethiree]]'' followed. Madhavan's career as an actor, became even more distraught after his English film, ''[[Nothing But Life]]'', also failed to become a grosser.

===''Aayitha Ezhuthu'' and the future===
2004, despite starting poorly, was a very prolific year for Madhavan, who starred in the films ''[[Aethiree]]'', ''[[Nothing But Life]]'', and the critically acclaimed ''[[Aayitha Ezhuthu]]''.  After ''Aethiree'' failed, Madhavan banked upon ''Nothing But Life'', an English film, to divert him back into a career of stardom. But it also failed, leaving Madhavan offerless. However, [[Mani Ratnam]] selected Madhavan to play a lead role in his forthcoming bilingual. The film was made as ''[[Aayitha Ezhuthu]]'' in Tamil and ''[[Yuva]]'' in Hindi, with only [[Esha Deol]] reprising her role in both versions. Apart from Deol, others in the multi-starrer were also actors who had been going through a rough patch. [[Surya Sivakumar]], [[Siddharth Narayan]], [[Meera Jasmine]] and [[Trisha Krishnan]] made up the rest of the cast. His character, Inba Sekhar, was a hitman living in the slums of [[Chennai]], who eventually went on to help a [[politician]] gain power. However Inba Sekhar's wife, Sasi, desperately tried to claw him away from his profession only to be beaten, thrown out and then come back crawling again. Madhavan has stated that the role he played,was the role he had experienced and enjoyed the most. He received praise from critics, claiming he outplayed [[Abhishek Bachchan]]'s interpretation of the character in the other version, ''[[Yuva]]''. Madhavan was short listed for the [[National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor|Indian National Film Award for the Best Supporting Actor]] and won the [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award (Tamil)|South Indian Filmfare Award for the Best Supporting Actor]].

''[[Priyasakhi]]'' followed in 2005, co-starring [[Sadha]] - with the pair playing an estranged husband and wife. The film received praise for the lead actors and became the first [[Tamil language]] to be dubbed into [[Zulu]]. ''[[Ramji Londonwaley]]'', the remake of ''[[Nala Damayanthi]]'' was released in [[Bollywood]] and became an average grosser.

In [[2006]], Madhavan recorded three hits in [[Rang De Basanti]], [[Thambi]] and [[Rendu]]. His appearance in vital cameo role, in ''Rang De Basanti'', was appreciated by film critics, earning him his first major hit in [[Bollywood]]. ''Thambi'', was shot for over an year and was abdly delayed, however despite a poor opening, the film managed to make a remarkable comeback and prove to be a big hit in town and village centres. Madhavan's portrayal of the do-gooder, received mixed reviews from critics. In ''[[Rendu]]'', Madhavan appeared in his first dual role in his career. The film became one of Madhavan's biggest successes. ''[[Guru (2007 film)|Guru]]'', Madhavan's fifth film under [[Mani Ratnam]]'s production, portrayed him in the role of real life journalist, [[S. Gurumurthy]]. ''Guru'', which is currently [[Bollywood]]'s biggest hit of 2007, was a bio-pic of the life of business tycoon, [[Dhirubhai Ambani]].

Madhavan has three films ready for release, with the earliest being ''[[Arya (film)|Arya]]''. The film is set for released in early [[August 2007]]. The second film, ''[[Evano Oruvan]]'', is expected to be released by [[September]]. The film is a remake of acclaimed film, ''Dombvili Fast''. The third film completed, is a [[Hindi]]-[[Bengali]] bilingual ''[[Sunglass (film)|Sunglass]]'', directed by [[Rituparno Ghosh]]. Madhavan has two films in the production stage, the first being ''[[Leelai]]'', known as ''Adi Oka Idhile'' for it's Telugu language bilingual. The second being ''[[Vaazhthukal]]'' alongside [[Bhavana Balachandran|Bhavana]], directed by Seeman who had directed, ''[[Thambi]]''. Several other films have been announced by Madhavan, including a bio-pic of painter, [[Raja Ravi Verma]]; a film on the [[2006 Mumbai Bombings]] and an [[English language|English]] film with [[Deepa Mehta]] as director.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Ranganathan and Saroja, parents of Madhavan, disliked their son's foray into teledramas and adverts, however were forgiving after his election in [[Mani Ratnam]]'s ''[[Alaipayuthey]]''. Despite Madhavan's ambition of wanting to join the army, his parents insisted he went to management school and do a degree on [[electronics]]. After completing the degree, he went on to teach communication and public speaking at workshops around [[India]]. At the [[Maharashtra]] workshop, he encountered his wife, Sarita, whom he married in [[1999]].

Their first son, Vedant was born in [[2006]], which eventually lead to relocating towards to the boat-club area in [[Chennai]] from [[Kilpauk]]. Madhavan's parents continue to live with him as do his parents-in-law.

===Relationships===
Madhavan, despite coming into the film industry after marriage, has a huge following of female fans. However, he constantly confirms his love and passion for his wife, Sarita.

After having his first on-screen kiss in ''Guru'' with [[Vidya Balan]], the pair have been romantically linked. Originally she was first picked for Madhavan's ''Run'', only to be turned away for [[Meera Jasmine]]. After establishing herself as a leading actress, she starred opposite Madhavan in ''Guru''. Other films such as ''[[Suryamukhi]]'', ''[[Stella (film)|Stella]]'', ''Once More'' and ''[[Oru Naal Podhuma]]'' were announced with the pair of them in the lead roles only to cancelled or for either actor to be replaced. Neither have them have denied it, however Madhavan has claimed that the kiss will be his first and last on-screen.

Another actress, [[Bhavana Balachandran]], is a self acclaimed fan of Madhavan's.  Despite making a statement that she will refuse to act with the same actor twice to avoid romantic links, she has signed up two films with Madhavan. He is also known for his recommendations of other actresses to directors, refering [[Govinda]] and [[Prosenjit]].
