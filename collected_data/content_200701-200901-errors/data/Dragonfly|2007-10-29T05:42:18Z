A '''dragonfly''' is an [[insect]] belonging to the order [[Odonata]], the suborder [[Epiprocta]] or, in the strict sense, the infraorder '''Anisoptera'''. It is characterized by large [[compound eye|multifaceted eyes]], two pairs of strong transparent [[insect wing|wings]], and an elongated body.

Dragonflies typically eat [[mosquito]]es, [[midges]] and other small insects like [[fly|flies]], [[bee]]s, and [[butterfly|butterflies]]. They are usually found around lakes, ponds, streams, and [[wetland]]s because their [[larva]]e, known as "[[nymph (biology)|nymphs]]", are aquatic. Dragonflies do not normally bite or sting humans (though they will bite in order to escape, if grasped by the abdomen); in fact, they are valued as a [[predation|predator]] that helps control the populations of harmful insects, such as mosquitoes. It is because of this that dragonflies are sometimes called "mosquito hawks" in North America, along with [[Tipulidae|crane flies]] (which, in fact, do not eat mosquitoes).

Female dragonflies lay [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in or near water, often in or on floating or [[emergent]] plants. Some species when laying eggs will submerge themselves completely just to lay their eggs in a suitable place. Most of the dragonflies life is spent in the [[larva]]l, ([[naiad (biology)|naiad]], aka nymph) form, beneath the water surface, using internal [[gill]]s to breathe, and using extendable [[jaw]]s to catch other [[invertebrate]]s or even [[vertebrate]]s such as [[tadpole]]s and [[fish]]. The larvae of large dragonflies may live as long as five years, or two months to three years in smaller species. When the the larva is ready to metamorphose into an adult, it climbs up a [[reed]] or other emergent plant at night, and when it does the breathing pattern changes inside the larvae's body. Then the skin splits at a weak spot behind the head and the adult dragonfly crawls out of its old larval skin, waits for the sun to rise, pumps up its wings and flies off to feed on [[midge]]s and [[flies]]. In the adult stage, larger species of dragonfly can live as long as four months.

==Classification==
===Ancient dragonflies ("Anisozygoptera")===
Conventionally, the Anisoptera were given suborder rank beside the ''ancient dragonflies'' ("Anisozygoptera", two living species and numerous fossil ones), but it has been determined recently that the Anisozygoptera form a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] assemblage of primitive relatives of the Anisoptera. Thus, the Anisoptera are reduced to an [[infraorder]], forming the new suborder Epiprocta (dragonflies in a general sense). The artificial grouping Anisozygoptera is disbanded, its members being recognized as largely extinct offshoots at various stages of dragonfly [[evolution]].

[[Image:IC Gomphidae wing.jpg|thumb|200px|Wing structure of a dragonfly]]

The oldest known species of dragonfly is the 320 million year old ''[[Delitzschala bitterfeldensis]]''. Another old genus is ''[[Namurotypus]]''.

===Dragonflies vs. damselflies===
[[Damselfly|Damselflies]] (Suborder Zygoptera) are often confused with dragonflies, but the two insects are distinct: most damselflies at rest hold their wings together above the body or held slightly open above (such as in the family Lestidae), whereas dragonflies at rest hold their wings horizontally or occasionally slightly down and forward. Also, the hindwing of the dragonfly broadens near the base, caudal to the connecting point at the body, while the hindwing of the damselfly is essentially similar to the forewing. The eyes on a damselfly are separated; in most dragonflies the eyes touch, with notable exceptions to this being in the Petaluridae (Petaltails) and the Gomphidae (Clubtails). Both are members of the Odonata, making their life cycles similar.

==Dragonflies in culture==
In Europe, dragonflies have often been viewed as sinister.  Some English vernacular names, such as "[[devil]]'s needle" and "ear cutter", link them with evil or injury.<ref name="Corbet-559">

"troll's spindle") as well as sending them to poke out the eyes of their enemies.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} The [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] name for dragonflies is "Øyenstikker", which literally means Eye Poker. They are often associated with [[snake]]s, as in the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name ''gwas-y-neidr'', "[[adder]]'s servant".<ref name="Corbet-559"/>  The [[Southern United States]] term "snake doctor" refers to a folk belief that dragonflies follow snakes around and stitch them back together if they are injured.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hand | first = Wayland D. | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = From Idea to Word: Folk Beliefs and Customs Underlying Folk Speech | journal = American Speech | volume = 48 | issue = 1/2 | pages = 67-76 | publisher =  | date = 1973 | url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-1283(197321%2F22)48%3A1%2F2%3C67%3AFITWFB%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Y | doi =  | id = | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}</ref>  The Lithuanian word "[[:lt:Laumė|Laum]][[:lt:Žirgas|žirgis]]" is a composite word meaning "the [[Lauma]]'s horse", while in Dutch, ''Aeshna mixta'' is called "[[:nl:Paardenbijter|Paardenbijter]]" or "horse biter". In some South American countries, dragonflies are also called ''matacaballo'' (horse killer), or ''caballito del diablo'' (devil's horse), since they were perceived as harmful, some species being quite large for an insect.

In East Asia and among Native Americans, dragonflies have a far better reputation, one that can also be said to have positively influenced modern day views about dragonflies in most countries.

For some Native American tribes they represent swiftness and activity, and for the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] they symbolize pure water.  Dragonflies are a common motif in [[Zuni]] pottery; stylized as a double-barred cross, they appear in [[Hopi]] rock art and on [[Pueblo people|Pueblo]] necklaces.<ref name="Mitchell-20">Mitchell and Lasswell, 20-26.</ref>  It is said in some Native American beliefs that dragonflies are a symbol of renewal after a time of great hardship.

In [[Japan]] dragonflies are symbols of courage, strength, and happiness, and they often appear in art and literature, especially [[haiku]].  In ancient mythology, Japan was known as ''Akitsushima'', which means "Land of the Dragonflies". The love for dragonflies is reflected by the fact that there are traditional names for almost all of the 200 species of dragonflies found in and around Japan.<ref>{{cite book | last = Waldbauer | first = Gilbert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Handy Bug Answer Book| publisher = Visible Ink Press | date = 1998 | location = Detroit | page = 91 | id = ISBN 1-57859-049-3 }} </ref>  Japanese children catch large dragonflies as a game, using a hair with a small pebble tied to each end, which they throw into the air.  The dragonfly mistakes the pebbles for prey, gets tangled in the hair, and is dragged to the ground by the weight.<ref name="Mitchell-38">Mitchell and Lasswell, 38.</ref>

They also have traditional uses as medicine in Japan and China. In some parts of the world they are a food source, eaten either as adults or larvae; in [[Indonesia]], for example, they are caught on poles made sticky with [[birdlime]], then fried in oil as a [[delicacy]].<ref name="Corbet-559"/>  

[[Vietnamese]] people have a traditional way to forecast [[rain]] by seeing dragonflies: "''Chuồn chuồn bay thấp thì mưa, bay cao thì nắng, bay vừa thì râm''" (Dragonflies fly at low level, it is rainy; dragonflies fly at high level, it is sunny; dragonflies fly at medium level, it is shadowy).  

Images of dragonflies were common in [[Art Nouveau]], especially in jewelry designs.<ref>{{cite news | last = Moonan | first = Wendy | coauthors = | title = Dragonflies Shimmering as Jewelry | work = New York Times | pages = E2:38 | date = [[August 13]], [[1999]] | ID = ProQuest document ID 43893085}}</ref>  They have also been used as a decorative motif on fabrics and home furnishings.<ref>{{cite news | last = Large | first = Elizabeth | coauthors =  | title = THE LATEST BUZZ; In the world of design, dragonflies are flying high  | work = The Sun (Baltimore, MD) | pages = 6N | date = [[June 27]], [[1999]] | ID = ProQuest document ID 42880564 }}</ref>
