'''Helium''' ('''He''') is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, [[inert]] [[monatomic]] [[chemical element]] that heads the [[noble gas]] group in the [[periodic table]] and whose [[atomic number]] is 2. Its [[boiling point|boiling]] and [[melting point|melting]] points are the lowest among the elements and it exists only as a [[gas]] except in extreme conditions.

An unknown yellow [[spectroscopy|spectral line]] signature in light was first observed from a [[solar eclipse]] in 1868 by French astronomer [[Pierre Janssen]] who is jointly credited with the [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery of the element]] with [[Norman Lockyer]] who observed the same eclipse and was the first to propose this was a new element which he named helium.  In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in the [[natural gas field]]s of the [[United States]], which is by far the largest supplier of the gas. The substance is used in [[cryogenics]], in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool [[superconducting magnet]]s, in [[helium dating]], for inflating balloons, for providing lift in [[airship]]s and as a protective gas for many industrial uses (such as [[arc welding]] and growing [[silicon wafer]]s). Inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two fluid phases, helium&nbsp;I and helium&nbsp;II, is important to researchers studying [[quantum mechanics]] (in particular the phenomenon of [[superfluidity]]) and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near [[absolute zero]] have on [[matter]] (such as [[superconductivity]]).

Helium is the second lightest element and is the second most [[chemical abundance|abundant]] in the observable Universe. Most helium was formed during the [[Big Bang]], but new helium is being created as a result of the [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in [[star]]s. On Earth, helium is relatively rare and is created by the natural [[radioactive decay]] of some elements, as [[alpha particle]]s that are emitted consist of helium [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. This radiogenic helium is trapped with [[natural gas]] in concentrations up to seven percent by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called [[fractional distillation]].

===Scientific discoveries===
The first evidence of helium was observed on August 18, 1868 as a bright yellow line with a [[wavelength]] of 587.49&nbsp;nanometers in the [[Emission spectrum|spectrum]] of the [[chromosphere]] of the [[Sun]]. The line was detected by French astronomer [[Pierre Janssen]] during a total [[solar eclipse]] in [[Guntur]], [[India]].<ref name="frnch">{{cite journal | title = French astronomers in India during the 17th - 19th centuries |journal =  Journal of the British Astronomical Association | volume =101 | issue = 2 | pages = 95&ndash;100 | url = http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1991JBAA..101...95K/0000100.000.html | author = Kochhar, R. K. |accessdate=2008-07-27|year=1991}}</ref><ref name="nbb"/> This line was initially assumed to be [[sodium]]. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer [[Norman Lockyer]] observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D<sub>3</sub> [[Fraunhofer line]] because it was near the known D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> lines of sodium.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements'', p. 256</ref> He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth.

On March 26, 1895 British chemist [[William Ramsay|Sir William Ramsay]] isolated helium on Earth by treating the mineral [[cleveite]] (a variety of [[uraninite]] with at least 10% [[rare earth elements]]) with mineral [[acid]]s. Ramsay was looking for [[argon]] but, after separating [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] from the gas liberated by [[sulfuric acid]], he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the D<sub>3</sub> line observed in the spectrum of the Sun.<ref name="Encyc 257">''The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements'', p. 257</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = On a Gas Showing the Spectrum of Helium, the Reputed Cause of D3 , One of the Lines in the Coronal Spectrum.

In 1907, [[Ernest Rutherford]] and Thomas Royds demonstrated that [[alpha particle]]s are helium [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] by allowing the particles to penetrate the thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube to study the spectra of the new gas inside. In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] by cooling the gas to less than one [[kelvin]].<ref>{{cite journal |title = Little cup of Helium, big Science |author = van Delft, Dirk |journal = Physics today |url = http://www-lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/cold/VanDelftHKO_PT.pdf |format=PDF|pages = 36&ndash;42 |year = 2008 |accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not have a [[triple point]] temperature at which the solid, liquid, and gas phases are at equilibrium.

In 1938, Russian physicist [[Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa]] discovered that [[helium-4]] has almost no [[viscosity]] at temperatures near [[absolute zero]], a phenomenon now called [[superfluidity]].<ref>{{cite journal |title = Viscosity of Liquid Helium below the λ-Point |author = [[Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa|Kapitza, P.]] |journal = [[Nature]] |volume = 141 |pages = 74 |doi = 10.1038/141074a0 |year = 1938}}</ref> This phenomenon is related to [[Bose-Einstein condensation]]. In 1972, the same phenomenon was observed in [[helium-3]], but at temperatures much closer to absolute zero, by American physicists [[Douglas D. Osheroff]], [[David M. Lee]], and [[Robert Coleman Richardson|Robert C. Richardson]]. The phenomenon in helium-3 is thought to be related to pairing of helium-3 [[fermion]]s to make [[boson]]s, in analogy to [[Cooper pairs]] of electrons producing [[superconductivity]].<ref>{{cite journal |title = Evidence for a New Phase of Solid He<sup>3</sup> |author = Osheroff, D.

===Extraction and use===
After an oil drilling operation in 1903 in [[Dexter, Kansas|Dexter]], [[Kansas]] produced a gas geyser that would not burn, Kansas state geologist [[Erasmus Haworth]] collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the [[University of Kansas]] at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists [[Hamilton Cady]] and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% [[nitrogen]], 15% [[methane]] (insufficient to make the gas [[combustible]]), 1% [[hydrogen]], and 12% an unidentifiable gas.<ref name="nbb"/><ref>{{cite journal |author = McFarland, D.

This put the United States in an excellent position to become the world's leading supplier of helium. Following a suggestion by Sir [[Richard Threlfall]], the [[United States Navy]] sponsored three small experimental helium production plants during [[World War I]]. The goal was to supply [[barrage balloon]]s with the non-flammable, lighter-than-air gas. A total of 200 thousand cubic feet (5,700&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of 92% helium was produced in the program even though only a few cubic feet (less than 100&nbsp;liters) of the gas had previously been obtained.<ref name="Encyc 257"/> Some of this gas was used in the world's first helium-filled [[airship]], the U.S. Navy's C-7, which flew its maiden voyage from [[Hampton Roads, Virginia|Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]] to [[Bolling Field]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on December 1, 1921.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Emme, Eugene M. comp. |title=Aeronautics and Astronautics: An American Chronology of Science and Technology in the Exploration of Space, 1915&ndash;1960 |year=1961 |pages=11&ndash;19 |chapter=Aeronautics and Astronautics Chronology, 1920–1924 |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Timeline/1920-24.html |publisher=[[NASA]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2008-07-20 }}</ref> 

Although the extraction process, using low-temperature gas liquefaction, was not developed in time to be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a [[lifting gas]] in lighter-than-air craft. This use increased demand during World War II, as well as demands for shielded arc [[welding]]. The [[helium mass spectrometer]] was also vital in the atomic bomb [[Manhattan Project]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Leak Detection|author=Hilleret, N.|publisher=[[CERN]]|title=CERN Accelerator School, vacuum technology: proceedings: Scanticon Conference Centre, Snekersten, Denmark, 28 May &ndash; 3 June 1999 |editor=S.

The [[government of the United States]] set up the [[National Helium Reserve]] in 1925 at [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], [[Texas]] with the goal of supplying military [[airship]]s in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime.<ref name="ECE"/> Due to a US military embargo against Germany that restricted helium supplies, the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] was forced to use hydrogen as the lift gas. Helium use following [[World War II]] was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen [[rocket fuel]] (among other uses) during the [[Space Race]] and [[Cold War]]. Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Williamson, John G.| title = Energy for Kansas| journal = Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science| volume = 71| issue = 4| pages = 432–438| publisher = Kansas Academy of Science| location = | date = Winter 1968| url =  http://www.jstor.org/pss/3627447| accessdate = 2008-07-27}}</ref>

After the "Helium Acts Amendments of 1960" (Public Law 86–777), the [[United States Bureau of Mines|U.S. Bureau of Mines]] arranged for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas. For this ''helium conservation'' program, the Bureau built a 425&nbsp;mile (684&nbsp;km) pipeline from [[Bushton, Kansas|Bushton]], [[Kansas]] to connect those plants with the government's partially depleted Cliffside gas field, near Amarillo, Texas. This helium-nitrogen mixture was injected and stored in the Cliffside gas field until needed, when it then was further purified.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Federal Register | date = [[2005-10-06]] | volume = 70 | issue = 193 | pages = 58464 | url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2005/pdf/05-20084.pdf | format=PDF| title = Conservation Helium Sale |accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref> 

By 1995, a billion cubic meters of the gas had been collected and the reserve was US$1.4&nbsp;billion in debt, prompting the [[Congress of the United States]] in 1996 to phase out the reserve.<ref name="nbb"/><ref name="stwertka">Stwertka, Albert (1998).

Helium produced between 1930 and 1945 was about 98.3% pure (2% [[nitrogen]]), which was adequate for airships. In 1945, a small amount of 99.9% helium was produced for welding use. By 1949, commercial quantities of Grade A 99.95% helium were available.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Bureau of Mines / Minerals yearbook 1949|year=1951|author=Mullins, P.V. |coauthors = R. M.

For many years the United States produced over 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in [[Arzew]], [[Algeria]] producing 600&nbsp;million cubic feet (1.7{{e|7}}&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the US had risen to above 15,000&nbsp;[[tonne|metric tons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/ds/2005/140/helium-use.pdf|format=PDF| title= Helium End User Statistic | accessdate = 2008-07-12 | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref> In 2004–2006, two additional plants, one in Ras Laffen, [[Qatar]] and the other in [[Skikda]], Algeria were built, but as of early 2007, Ras Laffen is functioning at 50%, and Skikda has yet to start up.

==Characteristics==
===Gas and plasma phases===

Helium is the least reactive [[noble gas]] after [[neon]] and thus the second least reactive of all elements; it is [[inert]] and [[monatomic]] in all standard conditions. Due to helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, in the gas phase its [[thermal conductivity]], [[specific heat]], and [[Speed of sound|sound speed]] are all greater than any other gas except [[hydrogen]]. For similar reasons, and also due to the small size of helium atoms, helium's [[diffusion]] rate through solids is three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.<ref name="Encyc 261">''The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements'', p. 261</ref> 

Helium is less water [[solubility|soluble]] than any other gas known,<ref>{{cite journal|title = Solubility of helium and neon in water and seawater | author = Weiss, Ray F.| year = 1971| journal = J. Chem. Eng. Data | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 235&ndash;241  |doi = 10.1021/je60049a019 }}</ref> and helium's [[index of refraction]] is closer to unity than that of any other gas.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Using helium as a standard of refractive | author = Stone, Jack A. |coauthors = Alois Stejskal| year = 2004| journal = Metrologia  | volume = 41 | pages = 189&ndash;197 |doi =10.1088/0026-1394/41/3/012}}</ref> Helium has a negative [[Joule-Thomson coefficient]] at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its [[Joule-Thomson inversion temperature]] (of about 32 to 50&nbsp;K at 1&nbsp;atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion.<ref name="ECE"/> Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.
[[Image:HeTube.jpg|thumb|left|Helium discharge tube shaped like the element's atomic symbol]]

Most extraterrestrial helium is found in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] state, with properties quite different from those of atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the [[solar wind]] together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] giving rise to [[Birkeland current]]s and the [[Aurora (phenomenon)|aurora]].<ref>{{cite journal|title = Helium isotopes in an aurora | author = Buhler, F. |coauthors = W.

===Solid and liquid phases===
{{main|Liquid helium}}

Unlike any other element, helium will remain liquid down to [[absolute zero]] at normal pressures. This is a direct effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the [[zero point energy]] of the system is too high to allow freezing. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1&ndash;1.5&nbsp;K (about &minus;272&nbsp;°C or &minus;457&nbsp;°F) and about 25&nbsp;bar (2.5&nbsp;MPa) of pressure.<ref>{{cite web |date = 2005-10-05 |url = http://www.phys.ualberta.ca/~therman/lowtemp/projects1.htm |title = Solid Helium |publisher = Department of Physics [[University of Alberta]]|accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref> It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the [[refractive index]] of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp [[melting point]] and has a [[crystal]]line structure, but it is highly [[Compressibility|compressible]]; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%.<ref name="LANL.gov">{{cite web |publisher = Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL.gov): |title = Periodic Table: Helium |url = http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/2.html |accessdate = 2008-07-23}}</ref> With a [[bulk modulus]] on the order of 5×10<sup>7</sup> [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]<ref>{{cite journal |author = Malinowska-Adamska, C. |coauthors = P.

Solid helium has a density of 0.214&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.006&nbsp;g/ml at 1.15&nbsp;K and 66&nbsp;atm; the projected density at 0&nbsp;K and 25&nbsp;bar is 0.187&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.009&nbsp;g/ml.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Henshaw, D.

====Helium I state====
Below its [[boiling point]] of 4.22&nbsp;Kelvin and above the [[lambda point]] of 2.1768&nbsp;kelvin, the [[isotope]] helium-4 exists in a normal colorless liquid state, called ''helium&nbsp;I''.<ref name="ECE"/><!-- page 262 & 263 --> Like other [[cryogenic]] liquids, helium&nbsp;I boils when it is heated and contracts when its temperature is lowered. Below the lambda point, however, helium doesn't boil, and it expands as the temperature is lowered further. <!-- clarifyme / The rate of expansion decreases below the lambda point until about 1&nbsp;K is reached; at which point expansion completely stops and helium&nbsp;I starts to contract again. / if it is below the lambda point, should not it be helium II?-->

Helium&nbsp;I has a gas-like [[index of refraction]] of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of [[styrofoam]] are often used to show where the surface is.<ref name="Encyc Chem Elem">''The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements'', p. 262</ref> This colorless liquid has a very low [[viscosity]] and a density one-eighth that of water, which is only one-fourth the value expected from [[classical physics]].<ref name="Encyc Chem Elem"/> [[Quantum mechanics]] is needed to explain this property and thus both types of liquid helium are called ''quantum fluids'', meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion ([[thermal energy]]) from masking the atomic properties.<ref name="Encyc Chem Elem"/>

====Helium II state====
Liquid helium below its lambda point begins to exhibit very unusual characteristics, in a state called ''helium&nbsp;II''. Boiling of helium&nbsp;II is not possible due to its high [[thermal conductivity]]; heat input instead causes [[evaporation]] of the liquid directly to gas. The isotope helium-3 also has a [[superfluid]] phase, but only at much lower temperatures; as a result, less is known about such properties in the isotope helium-3.<ref name="ECE"/> 
[[Image:helium-II-creep.svg|thumb|right|200px|Unlike ordinary liquids, helium&nbsp;II will creep along surfaces in order to reach an equal level; after a short while, the levels in the two containers will equalize. The [[Rollin film]] also covers the interior of the larger container; if it were not sealed, the helium&nbsp;II would creep out and escape.<ref name="ECE"/><!-- pg 263 -->]]

Helium&nbsp;II is a superfluid, a quantum-mechanical state of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries as thin as 10<sup>−7</sup> to 10<sup>−8</sup>&nbsp;m it has no measurable [[viscosity]].<ref name="nbb"/> However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity comparable to that of gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the ''two-fluid model'' for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a [[ground state]], which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.<ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1006/aphy.2000.6019  |title = Microscopic Theory of Superfluid Helium |journal = Annals of Physics |volume = 281 |issue = 1&ndash;2 |year = 2000 |month = October |pages = 636&ndash;705 12091211 |author = Hohenberg, P.

In the ''fountain effect'', a chamber is constructed which is connected to a reservoir of helium&nbsp;II by a [[sintering|sintered]] disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If the interior of the container is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.<ref>{{cite web |author=Warner, Brent|url=http://cryowwwebber.gsfc.nasa.gov/introduction/liquid_helium.html |title=Introduction to Liquid Helium |publisher=NASA|accessdate=2007-01-05 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050901062951/http://cryowwwebber.gsfc.nasa.gov/introduction/liquid_helium.html |archivedate=2005-09-01}}</ref> 

The thermal conductivity of helium&nbsp;II is greater than that of any other known substance, a million times that of helium&nbsp;I and several hundred times that of [[copper]].<ref name="ECE"/><!-- pg 263 --> This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum-mechanical mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a [[valence band]] of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. Helium&nbsp;II has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The [[heat transfer|flow of heat]] is governed by equations that are similar to the [[wave equation]] used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20&nbsp;meters per second at 1.8&nbsp;K through helium&nbsp;II as waves in a phenomenon known as ''[[second sound]]''.<ref name="Encyc 263"/>

Helium&nbsp;II also exhibits a creeping effect. When a surface extends past the level of helium&nbsp;II, the helium&nbsp;II moves along the surface, seemingly against the force of [[gravity]]. Helium&nbsp;II will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]]-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a [[Rollin film]] and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin.<ref name="Encyc 263">''The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements'', p. 263</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.76.1209 |title = Rollin Film Rates in Liquid Helium |journal = Physical Review |volume = 76 |issue = 8 |pages = 1209&ndash;1211 |month = October | year = 1949 |author = Fairbank, H.

==Isotopes==
{{main|Isotopes of helium}}
There are eight known [[isotope]]s of helium, but only [[helium-3]] and [[helium-4]] are [[stable isotope|stable]]. In the Earth's atmosphere, there is one He-3 atom for every million He-4 atoms.<ref name="nbb">{{cite book| author = Emsley, John| title = Nature's Building Blocks| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2001| location = Oxford| pages = 175–179| isbn = 0-19-850341-5 }}</ref> Unlike most elements, helium's isotopic abundance varies greatly by origin, due to the different formation processes. The most common isotope, helium-4, is produced on Earth by [[alpha decay]] of heavier radioactive elements; the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized helium-4 nuclei.

It was also formed in enormous quantities during [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].<ref name="bigbang" />

Liquid helium-4 can be cooled to about 1&nbsp;kelvin using [[evaporative cooling]] in a [[1-K pot]]. Similar cooling of helium-3, which has a lower boiling point, can achieve about 0.2&nbsp;kelvin in a [[helium-3 refrigerator]]. Equal mixtures of liquid He-3 and He-4 below 0.8&nbsp;K separate into two immiscible phases due to their dissimilarity (they follow different [[quantum statistics]]: helium-4 atoms are [[boson]]s while helium-3 atoms are [[fermion]]s).<ref name = "zxqubv">''The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements'', p. 264</ref> [[Dilution refrigerator]]s use this immiscibility to achieve temperatures of a few millikelvins.

It is possible to produce [[exotic helium isotopes]], which rapidly decay into other substances. The shortest-lived heavy helium isotope is helium-5 with a [[half-life]] of 7.6×10<sup>&minus;22</sup>&nbsp;seconds. Helium-6 decays by emitting a [[beta particle]] and has a half life of 0.8&nbsp;seconds. Helium-7 also emits a beta particle as well as a [[gamma ray]]. Helium-7 and helium-8 are created in certain [[nuclear reaction]]s.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements'', p. 260</ref> Helium-6 and helium-8 are known to exhibit a [[nuclear halo]].

===Modern extraction===
For large-scale use, helium is extracted by [[fractional distillation]] from natural gas, which contains up to 7% helium.<ref>{{cite web| author = Winter, Mark| title = Helium: the essentials| publisher = Univeristy of Sheffield | year = 2008| url = http://www.webelements.com/helium/| accessdate = 2008-07-14}}</ref> Since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly [[nitrogen]] and [[methane]]).

==Applications==
Helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties, such as its low [[boiling point]], low [[density]], low [[solubility]], high [[thermal conductivity]], or [[inert]]ness. Helium is commercially available in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, it can be supplied in small containers called [[Dewar flask|Dewars]] which hold up to 1,000&nbsp;liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 11,000&nbsp;gallons (41,637&nbsp;liters). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high pressure cylinders holding up to 300 standard cubic feet, while large quantities of high pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities of up to 180,000 standard cubic feet.

[[Image:Goodyear-blimp.jpg|thumb|left|Because of its low density and incombustibility, helium is the gas of choice to fill airships such as the [[Goodyear blimp]].]]
; Airships, balloons and rocketry
Because it is [[lighter than air]], [[airship]]s and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is approximately 7% more buoyant, helium has the advantage of being non-flammable (in addition to being fire retardant).<ref name="stwertka"/>  In [[rocketry]], helium is used as an [[ullage motor|ullage]] medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make [[rocket fuel]]. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in [[space vehicle]]s. For example, the [[Saturn V]] booster used in the [[Apollo program]] needed about 13 million cubic feet (370,000&nbsp;m³) of helium to launch.<ref name="LANL.gov"/>

However, inhaling it from a typical commercial source, such as that used to fill balloons, can be dangerous due to the risk of [[asphyxiation]] from lack of oxygen, and the number of contaminants that may be present. These could include trace amounts of other gases, in addition to aerosolized lubricating oil.

The use of helium reduces the distorting effects of temperature variations in the space between [[lens (optics)|lenses]] in some [[telescope]]s, due to its extremely low [[index of refraction]].<ref name="ECE"/><!-- pg 261 --> This method is especially used in solar telescopes where a vacuum tight telescope tube would be too heavy.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Jakobsson, H. |title = Simulations of the dynamics of the Large Earth-based Solar Telescope |journal = Astronomical & Astrophysical Transactions |volume = 13 |issue = 1 |pages = 35&ndash;46 |year= 1997 |doi = 10.1080/10556799708208113}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1983ApOpt..22...10E&amp;db_key=AST | title = Tests of vacuum VS helium in a solar telescope | author = Engvold, O. |coauthors = R.B.

The age of rocks and minerals that contain [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] can be estimated by measuring the level of helium with a process known as [[helium dating]].<ref name="nbb"/><ref name="ECE">{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements|author=Brandt, L.

Liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to the extremely low temperatures required for [[superconductivity]], such as in [[superconducting magnet]]s for [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. The [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] uses 96&nbsp;tonnes of liquid helium to maintain the temperature at 1.9&nbsp;Kelvin.<ref name="CERN-LHC">{{cite web|url=http://visits.web.cern.ch/visits/guides/tools/presentation/LHC_booklet-2.pdf LHC Guide booklet|title=CERN - LHC: Facts and Figures|publisher=[[CERN]]|accessdate=2008-04-30}}</ref> Helium at low temperatures is also used in [[cryogenics]].

==Safety==
Neutral helium at standard conditions is non-toxic, plays no biological role and is found in trace amounts in human blood. If enough helium is inhaled that oxygen needed for normal [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] is replaced [[asphyxia]] is possible. The safety issues for cryogenic helium are similar to those of [[liquid nitrogen]]; its extremely low temperatures can result in [[cold burn]]s and the liquid to gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed.

Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant [[thermal expansion]] that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is warmed to [[room temperature]].<ref name="LANL.gov"/>

==Biological effects==
{{Listen|right|filename=Helium article read with helium.ogg|title=Effect of helium on a human voice|description=The effect of helium on a human voice|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The voice of a person who has inhaled helium temporarily changes in timbre in a way that makes it sound high-pitched. The [[speed of sound]] in helium is nearly three times the speed of sound in air; because the [[fundamental frequency]] of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to the speed of sound in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]] of the [[vocal tract]].<ref name="nbb"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ackerman MJ, Maitland G |title=Calculation of the relative speed of sound in a gas mixture |journal=Undersea Biomed Res |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=305–10 |year=1975 |month=December |pmid=1226588 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2738 |accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref> (The opposite effect, lowering frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as [[sulfur hexafluoride]].)

Inhaling helium can be dangerous if done to excess, since helium is a simple [[asphyxiant]] and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration.<ref name="nbb"/><ref name="Grass">{{de icon}} {{cite journal | title = Suicidal asphyxiation with helium: Report of three cases Suizid mit Helium Gas: Bericht über drei Fälle | journal = Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift| volume = 119 | issue =9&ndash;10 | year =  2007 | doi = 10.1007/s00508-007-0785-4 | author = Grassberger, Martin |coauthors = Astrid Krauskopf | pages = 323&ndash;325 |language=German & English}}</ref> Breathing pure helium continuously causes death by [[asphyxiation]] within minutes.

At high pressures (more than about 20&nbsp;atm or two&nbsp;[[MPa]]), a mixture of helium and oxygen ([[heliox]]) can lead to [[high pressure nervous syndrome]], a sort of reverse-anesthetic effect; adding a small amount of nitrogen to the mixture can alleviate the problem.<!--<ref>{{cite web| last = Campbell| first = Ernest S.| title = High Pressure Nervous Syndrome| work = Physics and Problems With Gases | date = 2008-05-13| url = http://www.scuba-doc.com/HPNS.html| accessdate = 2008-07-16}}</ref>--><ref>{{cite journal |author=Rostain JC, Lemaire C, Gardette-Chauffour MC, Doucet J, Naquet R |title=Estimation of human susceptibility to the high-pressure nervous syndrome |journal=J Appl Physiol |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=1063–70 |year=1983 |month=April |pmid=6853282 |doi= |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6853282 |accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Hunger Jr |first=W.
