'''Barbara Ann Deeks''' [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born [[6 August]] [[1937]]) is an [[England|English]] [[actor|actress]] known as '''Barbara Windsor'''. She is sometimes known as Babs Windsor, and is best known for her part in the [[Carry On films|''Carry On'' films]] and as [[Peggy Mitchell]] in [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', and is now known as something of a 'national institution'.

==Early life==
Born in [[Shoreditch]], [[London]] as the only child of a [[costermonger]] and [[dressmaker]], John and Rose Deeks, Barbara Windsor passed the [[Eleven plus|11 plus]] exam with a high mark, and her mother paid for her to have elocution lessons. Her first film appearance was in ''[[The Belles of St Trinian's]]'' in 1954. She joined [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]], coming to prominence in their stage and film production of ''[[Sparrows Can't Sing]]'' in 1963, achieving a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award for Best British Film Actress. She also appeared in the sitcoms ''[[The Rag Trade]]'' and ''[[Wild, Wild Women]]''.

==''Carry On'' films==
However, Windsor came to real prominence with her portrayals of a good time girl in nine [[Carry On films]] and several TV specials between 1964 and 1978. Her first Carry On film was ''[[Carry On Spying]]'' and the last one ''[[Carry On Dick]]''. She refused to take part in any more ''"because she thought they had gone beyond the innocent sauciness which initially drew her to the series"''. Her most famous piece was in ''[[Carry On Camping]]'' in a scene during which she was doing outdoor aerobic exercises and her bikini top flew off. 

She also starred on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the Theatre Workshop's ''[[Oh! What a Lovely War]]'' and received a 1968 [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.

Barbara Windsor was the recipient of the inaugural [[Rear of the Year]] title in [[1976]].

==''EastEnders''==
After a gradual fall from the top, which also saw her first husband, Ronnie Knight, flee to [[Spain]] on bank robbery charges, she considered quitting acting. Windsor once claimed that her biggest professional regret was that they only wanted unknown faces in TV's ''[[EastEnders]]''.<ref>Hibbin, Sally and Nina Hibbin. ''What a Carry On: The Official Story of the Carry On Film series'', Hamlyn, 1988. ISBN 0-600-55819-3 p 43</ref> However in [[1994]], Windsor was offered the role of [[Peggy Mitchell]] in the series. This role saw her return to the limelight where she has remained since.

==Recent years==
In [[1999]], she released a duet with [[Mike Reid (entertainer)|Mike Reid]] called ''[[The More I See You]]''. This reached #44 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]s. In [[2000]], she was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in the [[2000]] Queen's New Year's Honours List

After a debilitating case of the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] saw her take a two year long absence from ''EastEnders'' from 2003 to 2005, with just a brief return for two episodes in 2004, she rejoined the cast on a full-time basis in the summer of 2005 and signed a one year contract. She appeared briefly in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode ''[[Army of Ghosts]]'' as Peggy Mitchell in a fictional episode of ''EastEnders''.

Windsor examined her family tree in the first episode of the third series of the documentary series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are?]]'', which aired on [[6 September]] [[2006]], in which she traced her family tree back eleven generations to John Golding, the great-great-grandfather of the famous painter [[John Constable]], making him Windsor's fourth cousin six times removed.  

==Marriages==
Barbara Windsor has married three times.
#Ronnie Knight (married [[2 March]] [[1964]], divorced [[January]] [[1985]])
#Stephen Hollings (married [[12 April]] [[1986]], divorced [[1995]])
#Scott Mitchell (married [[8 April]] [[2000]])
During her first marriage, she had an affair with her ''Carry On'' co-star, [[Sid James]]. She was also romantically linked to the gangster [[Kray twins|Reggie Kray]] in the [[1960s]]. In her autobiography, ''All of Me'', Windsor openly talks about her five [[abortion]]s. The first three of which took place before the age of 21, and the last occurring when she was 42.
