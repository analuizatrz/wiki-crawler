'''Zionism''' is an international [[Jewish political movements|political movement]] that supports a [[homeland for the Jewish People]] in the [[Land of Israel]].<ref>Zionism On The Web, [http://www.zionismontheweb.org/zionism_definitions.htm "Definitions of Zionism"], a compiled collection, Accessed January 22, 2007.</ref>
Although its origins are earlier, the movement was formally established by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] journalist [[Theodor Herzl]] in the late [[19th century]]. The movement was eventually successful in establishing the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948, as the world's first and only modern [[Jewish State]]. It continues primarily as support for the state and government of Israel and its continuing status as a homeland for the Jewish people.<ref>"An international movement originally for the establishment of a Jewish national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of modern Israel."

==Terminology==

The word "Zionism" itself is derived from the word "[[Zion]]" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ציון, ''Tzi-yon''), one of the names of [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Land of Israel]], as mentioned in the [[Bible]]. 
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:1892 Self Emancipation by Birnbaum.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1892 issue of ''Self Emancipation'' by N. Birnbaum describing the principles of Zionism]] -->
It was coined as a term for Jewish [[nationalism]] by [[Austria]]n [[Jew]]ish publisher [[Nathan Birnbaum]], founder of the first nationalist Jewish students' movement ''Kadimah'', in his journal ''Selbstemanzipation'' (''Self Emancipation'') in 1890. (Birnbaum eventually turned against political Zionism and became the first secretary-general of the anti-Zionist [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] movement [[Agudat Israel]].)<ref>De Lange, Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Judaism'', Cambridge University Press (2000), p. 30.  ISBN 0-521-46624-5.</ref>

Since the founding of the State of Israel, the term "Zionism" is generally considered to mean support for Israel as a Jewish [[nation state]]. However, a variety of different, and sometimes competing, [[ideologies]] that support Israel fit under the general category of Zionism, such as [[Religious Zionist Movement|Religious Zionism]], [[Revisionist Zionism]], and [[Labor Zionism]]. Thus, the term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the programs of these ideologies, such as efforts to encourage [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration to Israel]].

Certain individuals and groups have used the term "Zionism" as a pejorative to justify attacks on Jews. According to historians [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Howard Sachar]] and [[Jack Fischel]] among others, in some cases, the label "Zionist" is also used  as a [[euphemism]] for Jews in general by apologists for [[antisemitism]].<ref>Misuse of the term "Zionism":
*"... behind the cover of "anti-Zionism" lurks a variety of motives that ought to be called by their true name. When, in the 1950s under Stalin, the Jews of the Soviet Union came under severe attack and scores were executed, it was under the banner of anti-Zionism rather than anti-Semitism, which had been given a bad name by Adolf Hitler. When in later years the policy of Israeli governments was attacked as racist or colonialist in various parts of the world, the basis of the criticism was quite often the belief that Israel had no right to exist in the first place, not opposition to specific policies of the Israeli government. Traditional anti-Semitism has gone out of fashion in the West except on the extreme right. But something we might call post-anti-Semitism has taken its place. It is less violent in its aims, but still very real. By and large it has not been too difficult to differentiate between genuine and bogus anti-Zionism. The test is twofold. It is almost always clear whether the attacks are directed against a specific policy carried out by an Israeli government (for instance, as an occupying power) or against the existence of Israel. Secondly, there is the test of selectivity. If from all the evils besetting the world, the misdeeds, real or imaginary, of Zionism are singled out and given constant and relentless publicity, it can be taken for granted that the true motive is not anti-Zionism but something different and more sweeping." ([[Walter Laqueur|Laqueur, Walter]]: ''Dying for Jerusalem: The Past, Present and Future of the Holiest City'' (Sourcebooks, Inc., 2006) ISBN 1-4022-0632-1. p. 55)
*"In late July 1967, Moscow launched an unprecedented propaganda campaign against Zionism as a "world threat." Defeat was attributed not to tiny Israel alone, but to an "all-powerful international force." ... In its flagrant vulgarity, the new propaganda assault soon achieved Nazi-era characteristics. The Soviet public was saturated with racist canards. Extracts from Trofim Kichko's notorious 1963 volume, ''Judaism Without Embellishment'', were extensively republished in the Soviet media. Yuri Ivanov's ''Beware: Zionism'', a book essentially replicated ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', was given nationwide coverage." ([[Howard Sachar]]: ''A History of the Jews in the Modern World'' (Knopf, NY. 2005) p.722

Zionism should be distinguished from [[Territorialism]] which was a Jewish nationalist movement calling for a Jewish homeland, but not necessarily in [[Palestine]].  During the early history of Zionism, a number of proposals were made for settling Jews outside of Europe but these all ultimately were rejected or failed.  The debate over these proposals helped define the nature and focus of the Zionist movement.

==History of Zionism==
{{main |History of Zionism}}

Since the first century CE most Jews have lived in exile, although there has been a constant presence of Jews in the [[Eretz Israel|Land of Israel]], which was known to most non-Jews as [[Palestine]]. According to Judaism the Jews would return to Eretz Israel with the coming of the Messiah. However in the nineteenth century the current in Judaism supporting an earlier return got more support. Even before 1882, which is generally seen as the year in which practical Zionism started, some Jewish immigration into Palestine occurred.<ref>C.D. Smith, 2001, 'Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict', 4th ed., ISBN 0-312-20828-6, p. 1-12, 33-38</ref>

In 1882 immigration, called Aliyah (ascent) by Jews, started in earnest. Most immigrants came from Eastern Europe, where anti-semitism was rampant. They founded a number of agricultural settlements, or moshava, with financial support from Jewish philanthropists in Western Europa.
In the 1890s [[Theodor Herzl]] infused Zionism with a new and practical urgency. He brought the [[World Zionist Organization]] into being and, together with Nathan Birnbaum, planned its First Congress at [[Basel]] in 1897.<ref>[http://fusion.dalmatech.com/%7Eadmin24/files/zionism_in-britishpalestine.pdf Zionism & The British In Palestine], by [[Arjun Sethi|Sethi,Arjun]] (University of Maryland) January 2007, accessed May 20, 2007.</ref> This current in Zionism is known as political Zionism because it aimed at reaching a political agreement with the Power ruling Palestine. Up to 1917 this was the Ottoman Empire, and then until 1948 it was Britain on behalf of the League of Nations. The WZO also supported small scale settlement in Palestine.

In 1917 [[Chaim Weizmann]] was successful in gaining the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] from the British. This declaration endorsed a Jewish Homeland in Palestine and became the basis of the Mandate the League of Nations gave to Britain. Subsequently Britain supported Jewish immigration in principle, but in reaction to Arab violence it did impose restrictions on immigration. 

At the beginning of the twentieth century the [[Labor Zionism]] movement in Palestine began to develop. Although it consisted of several parties, in 1920 these parties together founded the Histadrut. The Histadrut did a lot of things for Jewish workers, like offering a Labor Exchange and health services, improving labor and living conditions. It was also the largest employer of the [[Yishuv]], the Jewish community in Palestine. An important task of the Histadrut was also the absorption of immigrants by offering them shelter, jobs and other necesitties. Under the leadership of [[David Ben-Gurion]] in the 1930s the dominant party of the labor movement, Mapai, also became the dominant party in the WZO. 

Among Palestinian Arabs there was a lot of popular resistance against Zionism. They felt threatened by the Zionist aim to have a Jewish majority in Palestine. There were riots in 1920, 1921 and 1929, sometimes accompanied by massacres of Jews. From 1936 to 1939 a general Revolt broke out. This revolt was suppressed by the British, but in a reaction they restricted further Jewish immigration to an absolute limit of 75,000, and in principle they stuck to this limit untill the end of the Mandate.

The Zionist goal of a Jewish state in all of Palestine, as demanded at the Biltmore Conference of 1942, conflicted with the interests of the Palestinian Arabs. After WWII and the Holocaust the support for Zionism among Jews and the general public worldwide increased. The British, who were attacked in Palestine by Zionist groups because they didn’t allow further Jewish immigration, didn’t know how to solve the matter and gave it to the United Nations. In 1947 the UN decided for a two-state solution, a Jewish and an Arab state in Palestine. Since the Arabs rejected partition, saying they wanted one state with an Arab majority, a war became inevitable. During this war the Yishuv first defeated the Palestinian Arabs and their foreign auxiliaries in April and early May 1948, withstood the invasion of armies of Arab states in May and June and subsequently went on to defeat those armies and conquer 78 percent of Palestine. During the war the military offensives of the Yishuv caused an exodus of over 700,000 Palestinians.

On 14 May 1948, after the last British troops had left, the Jewish Agency, led by [[Ben-Gurion]] declared the creation of the State of Israel. After the creation of the State of Israel the WZO continued to exist as an organisation that supported Israel.

==Types of Zionism==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=May 2007}}

===Labor Zionism===
{{main|Labor Zionism}}
{{see also|Kibbutz Movement|Kibbutz}}

Around 1900 the chief rival to Zionism among young Jews in Eastern Europe was the [[socialist movement]]. Many Jews were abandoning Judaism in favour of [[Communism]] or supported the [[Bund]], a Jewish socialist movement which called for [[Jewish Autonomism|Jewish autonomy]] in Eastern Europe and promoted [[Yiddish]] as the Jewish language.

Opposition to this led to the emergence of a new Zionist movement, the socialist Zionists, who believed that the Jews' centuries of being oppressed in anti-Semitic societies had reduced Jews to a meek, vulnerable, despairing existence which invited further anti-Semitism. They argued that Jews should redeem themselves from their history by becoming farmers, workers, and soldiers in a country of their own. These socialist Zionists rejected religion as perpetuating a "[[Diaspora]] mentality" among the Jewish people and established rural communes in Israel called "[[Kibbutzim]]". Major theoreticians of Socialist Zionism included [[Moses Hess]], [[Nahum Syrkin]], [[Ber Borochov]] and [[Aaron David Gordon]], and leading figures in the movement included [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Berl Katznelson]]. Most Socialist Zionists rejected [[Yiddish]] as a language of exile, embracing Hebrew as the common Jewish tongue. A major exception was Borochov, committed Yiddishist and Yiddish philologist who wrote extensively on the importance of the language. Socialist and Labor Zionism was ardently secularist with many Labor Zionists being committed atheists or opposed to religion. Consequently, the movement often had an antagonistic relationship with [[Orthodox Judaism]].

Labor Zionism was the dominant force in the political and economic life of the [[Yishuv]] during the period of the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] - partly as a consequence of its role in organizing Jewish economic life through the [[Histadrut]] -  and was the dominant ideology of the political establishment in Israel until the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 election]] when the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]] was defeated.

===General Zionism===
{{mainarticle|General Zionists}}
General Zionism (or Liberal Zionism) was initially the dominant trend within the Zionist movement from the first Zionist Congress in 1897 until the First World War, after which Labour Zionism was ascendant and the Zionist movement was becoming polarized between the Labour Zionists on the left and Revisionists on the right. The General Zionist movement identified with the liberal European Jewish middle class (or [[bourgeois]]) from which many Zionist leaders such as Herzl and [[Chaim Weizmann]] came and believed that a Jewish state could be accomplished through lobbying the Great Powers of Europe and influential circles in European society. The decline of General Zionism within the Zionist movement and the growing polarization within the movement was reflected in 1922 by the need of General Zionists to officially declare themselves a tendency in the Zionist Congress where, previously, they enjoyed such hegemony over the movement that it was not necessary to organize themselves as a formal faction.

===Religious Zionism===
{{main|Religious Zionism}}
In the 1920s and 1930s, a small but vocal group of religious Jews began to develop the concept of [[Religious Zionism]] under such leaders as Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] (the first [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi of Palestine]]) and his son Zevi Judah, and gained substantial following during the latter half of the 20th century.  Kook was concerned that growing secularization of Zionism and antagonism towards it from the Orthodox Jews would lead to a schism.  He therefore sought to create a brand of Judaism which would serve as a bridge between Orthodoxy and secular Jews.

===Revisionist Zionism===
{{main|Revisionist Zionism}}
The Revisionist Zionists were a group led by [[Jabotinsky]] who advocated pressing Britain to allow mass Jewish emigration and the formation of a Jewish Army in Palestine.  The army would force the Arab population to accept mass Jewish migration and promote British interests in the region. 

Revisionist Zionism was detested by the Socialist Zionist movement which saw them as being influenced by [[Fascism]] and the movement caused a great deal of concern among Arab Palestinians. After the [[1929 Palestine riots|1929 Arab riots]], the British banned Jabotinsky from entering Palestine. 

Revisionism was popular in Poland but lacked large support in Palestine. In 1935 the Revisionists left the [[Zionist Organization]] and formed an alternative, the [[New Zionist Organization]]. They rejoined the ZO in 1946.

==The negation of the Diaspora==  
{{main|The "Negation of the Diaspora" in Zionism}}
According to Eliezer Schweid the rejection of life in the Diaspora is a central assumption in all currents of Zionism.<ref>E. Schweid, ‘Rejection of the Diaspora in Zionist Thought’, in ‘’Essential Papers onZionsm, ed. By Reinharz & Shapira, 1996, ISBN 0-8147-7449-0, p.133</ref> Underlying this attitude was the feeling that the Diaspora restricted the full growth of Jewish national live. For instance the poet Bialik wrote:
:''And my hart weeps for my unhappy people ...''
:''How burned, how blasted must our portion be,''
:''If seed like this is withered in its soil. ...''
According to Schweid Bialik meant that the “seed” was the potential of the Jewish people, which they preserved in the Diaspora, where it could only give rise to deformed results. However once conditions changed the “seed” could still give a plentifull harvest.<ref>E. Schweid, ‘Rejection of the Diaspora in Zionist Thought’, in ‘’Essential Papers on Zionism, ed. By Reinharz & Shapira, 1996, ISBN 0-8147-7449-0, p.157</ref> 

In this matter Sternhell distinguishes two schools of thought in Zionism. One was the liberal or utilitarian school of Herzl and Nordau. Especially after the [[Dreyfus Affair]] they held that anti-Semitism would never disappear, and saw Zionism as a rational solution for Jewish individuals. The other was the organic nationalist school. It was prevalent among the Zionists in Palestine, and saw Zionism as a project to rescue the Jewish nation and not as a project to rescue Jewish individuals. Zionism was as a matter of the "Rebirth of the Nation".<ref>Z. Sternhell, 'The founding myths of Israel', 1998, p. 3-36, ISBN 0-691-01694-1, p. 49-51</ref>

==Anti-Zionism and post-Zionism==<!-- This section is linked from [[Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs]] -->
{{main|Anti-Zionism|Post-Zionism}}
There are a number of critics of Zionism, ranging from Jewish anti-Zionists to pro-Palestinian activists. Some of the most vocal critics of Zionism have tended to be Palestinians and other [[Arabs]],{{Fact|date=August 2007}} many of whom view Israel as wrongfully occupying what they view as the Arab land of [[Palestine]].<ref>El-Nawawy, Mohammed (2002).

"Zizek seems observant enough, in another essay, to note that Zionist Jews are employing anti-Semitic notions to describe the Palestinians.

While most Jewish groups are pro-Zionist, some liberal and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jewish communities (most vocally the [[Satmar]] Hasidim and the [[Neturei Karta]] group), oppose Zionism on religious grounds.<ref>Neturei Karta, Satmar and various left wing anti-Zionist groups make up a tiny fraction of the Jewish population and do not represent main stream thinking, [http://www.zionismontheweb.org/antizionism/Against_Zionists_not_Jews.htm Again Zionists Not Jews], Anti-Zionist Resource Center, Zionism On The Web.</ref>  Other non-Zionist Israeli movements, such as the [[canaanites (movement)|Canaanite]] movement led by poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] in the 1930s and 1940s, have argued that "Israeli" should be a new pan-ethnic [[nationality]].  A related modern movement is known as [[post-Zionism]], which asserts that Israel should abandon the concept of a "state of the Jewish people" and instead strive to be a state of all its citizens.<ref>[http://www.meforum.org/article/469 Can Israel Survive Post-Zionism?] by Meyrav Wurmser. Middle East Quarterly, March 1999</ref> Another opinion favors a [[binational solution|binational state]] in which Arabs and Jews live together while enjoying some type of autonomy, as in Belgium.

In defense of criticism, Zionists reject the charges that Zionism is racist, insisting it is no different than any other national liberation movement of oppressed peoples, and argue that since criticism of both the state of Israel and Zionism is often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, much of it can be attributed to [[antisemitism]].<ref name=Taguieff>Taguieff, Pierre-André.

==Non-Jewish Zionism==
===Marcus Garvey and "Black Zionism"===
Zionist success in winning British support for formation of a "Jewish National Home" in Palestine helped inspire the African-American Nationalist [[Marcus Garvey]] to form a movement dedicated to returning Americans of African origin to Africa. During a speech in [[Harlem]] in 1920 Garvey stated that

other races were engaged in seeing their cause through---the Jews through their Zionist movement and the Irish through their Irish movement---and I decided that, cost what it might, I would make this a favorable time to see the Negro's interest through.<ref>[[Negro World]] 6, March 1920 cited in http://www.international.ucla.edu/africa/mgpp/lifeintr.asp (accessed 29/11/2007).</ref></blockquote>
Garvey established a shipping company, the [[Black Star Line]], to ship Black Americans to Africa, but for various reasons failed in his endeavour. His ideas helped inspire the [[Rastafarian]] movement in Jamaica, the [[Black Jews]] <ref> http://www.blackjews.org/RabbiBios/RabbiFord.html</ref> and the [[The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem|Black Hebrews]] who initially moved to Liberia before settling in Israel.

===Christian Zionism===
{{main|Christian Zionism}}
In addition to Jewish Zionism, there was always a small number of [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionists]] that existed from the early days of the Zionist movement. According to Charles Merkley of Carleton University, Christian Zionism strengthened significantly after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], and many [[Dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] Christians, especially in the United States, now strongly support Zionism.

Throughout the entire 19th century and early 20th century, the return of the Jews to the Holy Land was widely supported by such eminent figures as [[Queen Victoria]], [[King Edward VII]], [[John Adams]], the second President of the [[United States]], [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]] of [[South Africa]], [[Tomáš Masaryk|President Masaryk]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], British Prime Ministers Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour, President [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Benedetto Croce]], [[Italy|Italian]] philosopher and historian, [[Henry Dunant]], founder of the [[Red Cross]] and author of the [[Geneva Conventions]], [[Fridtjof Nansen]], [[Norway|Norwegian]] scientist and humanitarian. The [[France|French]] government through Minister M. Cambon formally committed itself to “the renaissance of the Jewish nationality in that Land from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries ago". In [[China]], Wang, Minister of Foreign Affairs, declared that "the Nationalist government is in full sympathy with the Jewish people in their desire to establish a country for themselves."<ref> Palestine: The Original Sin , Meir Abelson [http://www.acpr.org.il/ENGLISH-NATIV/issue1/Abelson-1.htm] </ref>
