'''Devin Hester''' (born [[November 4]], [[1982]]) is an [[American Football|American football]] [[cornerback]] and [[punt returner|return specialist]] for the [[Chicago Bears]] of the [[National Football League]]. Hester, dubbed the '''Windy City Flyer''', currently holds the all-time NFL record for the most return touchdowns in a single season.

==Early life==
Devin Hester was born to Juanita Brown and Lenorris Sr. Hester in [[Riviera Beach, Florida]].  His early life was full of many obstacles; his father, who had recently [[divorce]]d his mother, died while Hester was an infant. Later in his life, his mother was severely injured in a car accident, leading Hester to become [[depressed]]. His [[stepfather]], Derrick Brown, eased Hester’s emotions by introducing him to football. With the additional aid of his older brother, Lenorris Jr., Hester was able to excel in football and academics.<ref name="Hester_Pilot">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/cs-060917haugh,1,5287462.column?coll=chi-sportstop-hed|title=Pilot episode is prime-time|language=English}}</ref>

Hester attended [[Suncoast High School]]. During his high school career, he played football as a [[cornerback]], [[wide receiver]], and [[running back]]. He was also a precious [[punt returner|return specialist]], earning honors from ''SuperPrep.com'' as the nation’s sixth best high school prospect in Florida, and being named as a  ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' [[All-American]]. Hester also participated in the 2002 CaliFlorida Bowl, where he returned a kick for an 80-yard touchdown. <ref name="Hester_Early">{{cite web |url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/hester_devin00.html|title=Player Bio:Devin Hester::Football|language=English}}</ref>

During his youth, Hester was a fan of the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. He especially idolized [[Deion Sanders]], [[Emmitt Smith]] and [[Michael Irvin]]. He was also a fan of the [[Chicago Bulls]] during the [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Phil Jackson]] era. <ref name="Hester_Q/A">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/chi-0612040196dec04,1,2133943.story?coll=chi-sportsbears-hed|title=Q&A: Devin Hester|language=English}}</ref>

==College career==
After completing high school, Hester enrolled into the [[University of Miami]]. As a [[sophomore]],  He earned national recognition after being named onto the "Walter Camp All-America Team" and “''The Sporting News''' All-America team”. Hester’s recognition was influenced by his prodigious success as a [[Punt returner|Punt]] and [[Kick returner]].  Hester’s ability to thrust laterally and breakaway from pursuers made him one of the nation’s most dangerous return specialists. <ref name="Hester_Early">{{cite web |url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/hester_devin00.html|title=Player Bio:Devin Hester::Football|language=English}}</ref>

During his freshman year, Hester returned an opening kick for a 97-yard touchdown against the [[University of Florida]]. In a game against [[Duke University]] in 2005, Hester broke six tackles while returning an 81-yard punt. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=252812390
|title=Duke Blue Devils at Miami (FL) Hurricanes|language=English}}</ref> Ultimately, Hester completed his college career with a total of six touchdowns from kick returns, including one blocked field goal return. He also scored one rushing and receiving touchdown, and recorded five interceptions as a defensive back. Hester became the first football player in [[Miami Hurricanes]]' history to play as member of the [[American football positions|special, offensive, and defensives teams]]. <ref name="Hester_Early">{{cite web |url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/hester_devin00.html|title=Player Bio:Devin Hester::Football|language=English}}</ref> 

In addition to his productive tenure at the University of Miami, Hester befriended [[Deion Sanders]] through [[Ed Reed]], one of Sanders’ teammates who was an [[alumni]] of the University of Miami. Sanders counseled and advised Hester, and also provided him with encouragement. Hester was also known as “Anytime” in college, which is a tribute to Sanders’ [[nickname]], “Prime Time”. He also adopted Sanders’ signature touchdown dance, and [[taunt|showboating]] maneuvers, which he carried to his future [[NFL]] career. <ref name="Hester_Pilot">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/cs-060917haugh,1,5287462.column?coll=chi-sportstop-hed|title=Pilot episode is prime-time|language=English}}</ref>

==Professional career==
The [[Chicago Bears]] drafted Hester in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]]. Although he was drafted as a cornerback, [[Lovie Smith]] intended to use Hester as a return specialist, due to his collegiate exploits. Hester’s rookie season was eventful and record breaking. In only thirteen weeks as professional football player, Hester returned six touchdowns, including a record tying 108-yard touchdown from a missed field goal. He also returned a punt for a clutch 83-yard game-winning touchdown against the [[Arizona Cardinals]], and two kickoff returns in one game against the [[Saint Louis Rams]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://rightwingnuthouse.com/archives/2006/10/16/phoenix-rising/|title=PHOENIX RISING

<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2887|title= Hester named player of month for December |language=English}}</ref> He was also voted onto the [[Associated Press]]’s 2006 All-Pro team with 48 and a half votes, finishing second behind [[LaDainian Tomlinson]], [[Champ Bailey]], and  [[Jason Taylor (American football player)|Jason Taylor]] who all received 50 votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AqMbR3et8MEKS6ALAZcsdTlDubYF?slug=ap-nflall-proteam&prov=ap&type=lgns|title= Tomlinson, Taylor and Bailey unanimous All-Pros |language=English}}</ref>

Following his record-breaking game during week fourteen, opposing teams exercised additional caution when allowing Hester to return kicks. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tbo.com/sports/bucs/MGB03UILOVE.html|title= A Force Of Nature |language=English}}</ref> Hester did not score another touchdown or engineer any big returns after the game. His only big break came in the Divisional Playoff round against the [[Seattle Seahawks]], where he returned 63-yard punt for a touchdown that was eventually called back on account of a penalty. <ref name="Hester_Rams">{{cite web |url= http://www.thenewstribune.com/sports/seahawks/story/6324359p-5513197c.html|title= Seahawks’ special teams do their job|language=English}}</ref> The Bears won both NFC playoff rounds and will advance to [[Super Bowl XLI]], which will be coincidentally held near Hester’s hometown.  

Hester finished the 2006 season by accumulating three touchdowns for 600 yards on 47 punt returns, and two touchdowns for 528 yards on 20 kick returns, thus making him one of the league’s most productive return specialists.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/stats?playerId=9643 ESPN.com – NFL – Devin Hester]</ref> He also became the sixth person in history to return two kicks for touchdowns in one game.<ref name="Hester_Rams">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2796|title=Hester wins second straight player of week award|language=English}}</ref> Even without taking an offensive snap prior to week fourteen, Hester was the Bears' second leading scorer, behind kicker [[Robbie Gould]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/106084/dante_hall_has_passed_the_torch_to.html |title= Dante Hall Has Passed the Torch to Devin Hester |language=English}}</ref> On a negative note, Hester struggled to control the football at times, having games with multiple turnovers on at least two separate occasions. <ref>[http://www.suburbanchicagonews.com/couriernews/sports/176684,3_2_EL18_BEARSNOTES_S1.article Offensive Hester a downer]</ref><ref> [http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/cs-061105isaacson,1,7180508.column?page=2&coll=cs-columnists Precision drill team]</ref>

Many fans speculated that Hester’s speed and prior experience as a wide receiver would earn him a spot on the Bears' offense team, similar to teammate [[Rashied Davis]]. While Lovie Smith dismissed the speculation, he played Hester as a wide receiver for one play against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on [[December 17]], [[2006]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2802

Hester attributes his talent to his mentor, [[Deion Sanders]], whom Hester claims helped him perfect his return prowess. <ref name="Hester_Rams">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2796|title=Hester wins second straight player of week award|language=English}}</ref><ref name="Hester_Q/A">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/chi-0612040196dec04,1,2133943.story?coll=chi-sportsbears-hed|title=Q&A: Devin Hester|language=English}}</ref> Sanders, a former cornerback and return specialist, compliments Hester after every productive performance. However, Sanders also berated Hester for taunting another player en route to his second touchdown return against the Saint Louis Rams.  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2806|title= Electrifying Hester enjoying wild ride with humility
