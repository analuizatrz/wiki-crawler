The '''Ideal Home Show''' (formerly called the '''Ideal Home Exhibition''') is an annual event run by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in [[London]]. 

Its goal is to bring together everything associated with having an "ideal home", such as the latest inventions for the modern house. 

The first [[trade fair|exhibition]] was held in [[1908]] at the [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] exhibition centre, with sections dedicated to "phases of home life" such as construction, food and cookery, furniture and decoration. Demonstrations and  contests included an Arts and Crafts competition and a competition to design the "Ideal Home". [[Wareham Smith]], advertising manager of the Daily Mail, founded the exhibition as a marketing event for the newspaper. It was often visited by celebrities and royalty.

By the late [[20th century]] the event was criticised for having dropped its educational aims in favour of a solely commercial purpose. Attendance declined but recovered again from the mid 1990s.
