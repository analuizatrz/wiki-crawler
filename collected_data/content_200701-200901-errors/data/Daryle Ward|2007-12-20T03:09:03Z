'''Daryle Ward''' (born [[June 27]], [[1975]] in [[Lynwood, California]]) is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[outfielder]] and [[first baseman]] for the [[Chicago Cubs]]. He bats and throws left-handed. The 6-foot-2, 240 pound (109 kg) Ward was drafted by the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the [[1994 in sports|1994]] amateur draft. He is the son of former major leaguer [[Gary Ward]]. As of 2006, he was one of six active major leaguers (along with [[Moises Alou]], [[David Bell (baseball player)|David Bell]], [[Barry Bonds]], [[Prince Fielder]], and [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]]) to hit 20 home runs in a season whose fathers had also hit 20 home runs in a MLB season.

==Professional career==
Ward came to the [[Houston Astros]] in December [[1996 in sports|1996]] as part of a ten-player trade with Detroit. He debuted in [[1999 in baseball|1999]], hitting 8 home runs in 150 at bats.  In 2000, he hit 20 [[home run]]s in just 264 [[At bat|at-bats]]. In his third season for the Astros, Ward [[Batting average|batted]] .263 with 9 home runs and 39 [[run batted in|RBI]] in 95 games. The next year he went for .276, 12, 72 in 136 games. After the season he was traded to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. 

Ward spent [[2003 in baseball|2003]] in a part-time role, hitting .183 with one [[extra base hit]] (a [[double (baseball)|double]]) in 109 at-bats. After the season, the Dodgers released Ward, and the Pirates signed him as a minor league [[free agent]]. Ward played better in 2004, and the Pirates re-signed him for [[2005 in sports|2005]] as their part-time first baseman. Ward has signed on to become a member of the Chicago Cubs bench for 2007. In 549 career games played, Ward has batted .259 (384-1485), with 65 HRs, 254 RBI, 155 [[Run (baseball statistics)|runs]], 80 doubles and four [[triple (baseball)|triples]], with an [[on base percentage]] (OBP) of .306 and [[slugging percentage]] (SLG) of .447.

===2004 season===
After being called up from the Triple-A [[Nashville Sounds]] to replace [[Raúl Mondesí]], Ward got off to a torrid start. On [[May 26]], [[2004]], Ward, recalled from the Triple-A [[Nashville Sounds]] two weeks before, hit for the cycle and tied his career high with six RBI in the Pirates' 11-8 victory over the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Ward hit a two-run [[Double (baseball)|double]] in the first, an RBI [[Triple (baseball)|triple]] in the fourth, golfed a three-run [[Home run|homer]] in the fifth and [[Hit (baseball statistics)|singled]] in the ninth. He was the first Pittsburgh player to hit for the cycle since [[Jason Kendall]] on [[May 19]], [[2000]], against the Cardinals. It has been done 23 times in club history and 243 times since [[1882 in baseball|1882]].

Ward joined his father, Gary, to become the first father-son combination in major league history to hit for the cycle. The older Ward accomplished the feat on September 18, [[1980 in baseball|1980]], for the [[Minnesota Twins]]. Ward slumped later in the season, slowed down by a wrist [[injury]], and finished hitting .249 with 15 HR and 57 RBI, with a .306 OBP and .474 SLG. Ward, along with [[Valerio de los Santos]], signed a deal to play with the Nationals, .

===2006 season===
On [[August 31]], [[2006]], Ward was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for minor-league pitcher [[Luis Atilano]].

===2007 season===
Ward was signed on [[December 7]], [[2006]] by the [[Chicago Cubs]] to a one-year deal worth $1.05 million after hitting .308 with a .380 OBP in 2006 for Washington and Atlanta in 150 combined plate appearances. He replaced [[John Mabry]] as a backup at 1st base to [[Derrek Lee]]. On [[May 6]], Ward hit a game winning single against his former team, the [[Washington Nationals]]. He was also called to replace [[Derrek Lee]] on [[May 13]], after Lee left the game with neck [[spasms]]. Ward also saw time as an [[pinch hitter]] in close game situations.  On [[August 18]] Ward hit a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] in the third inning off of [[St. Louis Cardinals]] pitcher [[Anthony Reyes]], the third of his career and his first home run as a member of the Cubs.

==Trivia==
* Ward is the only player to hit a home run out of Pittsburgh's [[PNC Park]] and into the [[Allegheny River]] on the fly—a truly "[[Willie Stargell|Stargellesque]]" blast—in a regular season game, a feat he accomplished in 2002 as a member of the [[Houston Astros]].  Many Home Runs have made the river on the bounce, and several home runs hit during the 2006 Major League Baseball [[Home Run Derby]] made the river on the fly as well, creating speculation of juiced balls.
