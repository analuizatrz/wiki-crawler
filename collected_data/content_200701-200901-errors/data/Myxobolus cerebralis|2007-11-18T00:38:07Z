'''''Myxobolus cerebralis''''' is a [[myxosporea]]n [[parasite]] of [[salmonidae|salmonid]]s ([[salmon]], [[trout]], and their allies) that causes '''whirling disease''' in [[fish farming|farmed]] salmon and trout and also in [[fish stocks|wild fish populations]]. It was first described from [[rainbow trout]] in [[Germany]] a century ago, but its range has spread and it has appeared in most of [[Europe]] (including [[Russia]]), the [[United States]], [[South Africa]]<ref name="Barth">Bartholomew, J.L. and Reno, P.W. (2002). The history and dissemination of whirling disease. American Fisheries Society Symposium 29: 3–24.</ref> and other countries.  In the 1980s, it was discovered that ''M. cerebralis'' needs to infect a [[tubificidae|tubificid]] [[oligochaete]] (a kind of [[segmented worm]]) to complete its life-cycle.<ref name="Markiw">Markiw, M.E. (1992). Salmonid Whirling disease. Fish and Wildlife Leaflet 17: 1–3. [http://www.lsc.usgs.gov/FHB/leaflets/Salmonid.asp]</ref>  The parasite infects its hosts with its cells after piercing them with [[polar filament]]s ejected from [[nematocyst]]-like capsules.

Whirling disease afflicts juvenile fish (fingerlings and fry) and causes [[skeleton|skeletal]] deformation and [[neural|neurological]] damage. Fish "whirl" forward in an awkward corkscrew-like pattern instead of swimming normally, find feeding difficult, and are more vulnerable to [[predator]]s. The mortality rate is high for fingerlings, up to 90% of infected populations, and those that do survive are deformed by the parasite residing in their [[cartilage]] and [[bone]]. They act as a reservoir for the parasite, which is released into water following the fish's death. ''M. cerebralis'' is one of the most economically important myxozoans in fish as well as one of the most pathogenic. It was the first myxosporean whose pathology and symptoms were described scientifically.<ref name="Gilbert">Gilbert, M. A. & Granath, W.O. Jr. (2003). Whirling disease and salmonid fish: life cycle, biology, and disease. Journal of Parasitology 89: 658–667.</ref> The parasite is not transmissible to humans.

==Taxonomy==
The [[taxonomy]] and naming of both ''M. cerebralis'' and of myxozoans in general have complicated histories.  It was originally thought that this parasite infected fish brains (hence the [[specific epithet]] ''cerebralis''), however it quickly became apparent that while it can be found in the [[nervous system]], it primarily infects [[cartilage]] and [[skeleton|skeletal tissue]].  Attempts to change the name to ''Myxobolus chondrophagus'', which would more accurately describe the organism, failed because of [[binomial nomenclature|nomenclature rules]].<ref name="Barth" />  Later, it became apparent that organisms previously called ''Triactinomyxon dubium'' and ''T. gyrosalmo'' ([[class (biology)|class]] [[Actinosporea]]) were in fact triactinomyxon stages of ''M. cerebralis,'' whose life cycle was expanded to include the triactinomyxon stage.<ref>Kent, M. L., Margolis, L. & Corliss, J.O. (1994). The demise of a class of protists: taxonomic and nomenclatural revisions proposed for the protist phylum Myxozoa Grasse, 1970. Canadian Journal of Zoology 508: 932–937.</ref>  Similarly, other actinosporeans were folded into the life cycles of various myxosporeans.

Today, the myxozoans, previously thought to be multicellular [[protozoans]] are considered [[animal]]s by many scientists, though their status has not officially changed.  Recent molecular studies suggest that they are related to [[Bilateria]] or [[Cnidaria]], with Cnidaria being closer morphologically because both groups have extrusive filaments,<ref name="Hedrick">Hedrick, R. P. & El–Matbouli, M. (2002). Recent advances with taxonomy, life cycle, and development of Myxobolus cerebralis in the fish and oligochaete hosts. American Fisheries Society Symposium 29: 45–53.</ref> but with Bilateria being somewhat closer in some genetic studies.<ref>Monteiro, A. S., Okamura, B., and P. W. H. Holland. (2002). Orphan worm finds a home: Buddenbrockia is a Myxozoan. Molecular Biology and Evolution 19: 968–971. [http://mbe.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/19/6/968]</ref>

==Morphology==
[[Image:Actinomyxon.png|thumb|150px|right|Diagram of the structure of a triactionmyxon stage spore of ''Myxobolus cerebralis'']]''M. cerebralis'' has many diverse stages ranging from single [[cell (biology)|cells]] to relatively large spores, not all of which have been studied in detail. 

===Triactinomyxon stage=== 
The stages that infect fish, called [[triactinomyxon]] spores, are made of a single style that is about 150 [[micrometre|micrometers]] (µm) long and three processes or "tails" that are each about 200 micrometers long. A [[sporoplasm]] packet at the end of the style contains 64 germ cells surrounded by a cellular envelope.<ref name="Hedrick" />  There are also three [[polar capsule]]s, each of which contains a coiled [[polar filament]] between 170 and 180 µm long.<ref name="Markiw" />  Polar filaments in both this stage and in the [[myxospore]] stage (see picture above) rapidly shoot into the body of the host, creating an opening through which the sporoplasm can enter.

===Sporoplasm stage===
Upon contact with fish hosts and firing of the polar capsules, the sporoplasm contained within the central style of the triactinomyxon migrates into the epithelium or gut lining. Firstly, this sporoplasm undergoes [[mitosis]] to produce more [[amoeboid]] cells, which migrate into deeper tissue layers, in order to reach the cerebral cartilage.<ref name="Markiw" />

===Myxosporean stage===
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Myxospore.jpg|thumb|right|Myxospore drawn by Dr. Thomas L. Wellborn, Jr.  Note the coiled polar filaments.]] -->
Myxospores, which develop from [[sporogonic]] cell stages inside fish hosts, are lenticular.  They have a diameter of about 10  micrometers and are made of six cells.  Two of these cells form polar capsules, two merge to form a binucleate sporoplasm, and two form protective valves.<ref name="Hedrick" />  Myxospores are infective to oligochaetes, and are found among the remains of digested fish cartilage.  They are often difficult to distinguish from related species because of morphological similarities across [[genus|genera]].  Though ''M. cerebralis'' is the only myxosporean ever found in salmonid cartilage, other visually similar species may be present in the skin, [[nervous system]], or [[muscle]].<ref name="Markiw" />

==Life cycle==
[[Image:LifeCycle(Myxobolus cerebralis).jpg|thumb|260px|Life cycle of ''M. cerebralis.'' Click to enlarge.]]
''Myxobolus cerebralis'' has a two-host life-cycle involving a salmonid fish and a tubificid oligochaete. So far, the only worm known to be susceptible to ''M. cerebralis'' infection is ''[[Tubifex tubifex]]'',<ref name="Markiw" /> though what scientists currently call ''T. tubifex'' may in fact be more than one species.<ref name="Gilbert" />  First, myxospores are ingested by tubificid worms. In the [[gut]] [[lumen]] of the worm, the spores extrude their [[polar capsule]]s and attach to the gut [[epithelium]] by [[polar filament]]s. The shell valves then open along the suture line and the binucleate germ cell penetrates between the intestinal epithelial cells of the worm. This cell multiplies, producing many [[amoeboid]] cells by an asexual cell [[Binary fission|fission]] process called [[merogony]]. As a result of the multiplication process, the intercellular space of the epithelial cells in more than 10 neighbouring worm segments may become infected.<ref>El-Matbouli, M., and Hoffmann, R.W. (1998). Light and electron microscopic studies on the chronological development of Myxobolus cerebralis to the Actinosporean stage in Tubifex Tubifes. International Journal For Parasitology 28: 195–217.</ref>

Around 60&ndash;90 days post-infection, sexual cell stages of the parasite undergo [[sporogenesis]], and develop into [[pansporocyst]]s, each of which contains eight triactinomyxon-stage spores. These spores are released from the oligochaete anus into the water.<ref name="Hedrick" />  Alternatively, a fish can become infected by eating an infected oligochaete.<ref name="Hedrick" /> Infected tubificids can release triactinomyxons for at least 1 year.<ref>El-Matbouli, M., and Hoffmann, R.W. (1998). Light and electron microscopic studies on the chronological development of Myxobolus cerebralis to the Actinosporean stage in Tubifex Tubifes. International Journal For Parasitology 28: 195–217.</ref> The triactinomyxon spores swim through the water to infect a salmonid through the skin.  Penetration of the fish by these spores takes only a few seconds. Within five minutes, a sac of germ cells called a [[sporoplasm]] has entered the fish [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], and within a few hours, the sporoplasm splits into individual cells that will spread through the fish.<ref name="Hedrick" />

Within the fish, there are both intracellular and extracellular stages that reproduce in its cartilage by asexual [[endogeny]], meaning that new cells grow from within old cells.  The final stage within fish is the myxospore, which is formed by [[sporogony]].  They are released into the environment when the fish decomposes or is eaten.<ref name="Hedrick" />  Some recent research indicates that some fish may expel viable myxospores while still alive.<ref>Nehring, R. B. Thompson, K. G. Taurman, K. A. & Shuler, D.L. (2002). Laboratory studies indicating that living brown trout Salmo trutta expel viable Myxobolus cerebralis myxospores. American Fisheries Society Symposium 29: 125–134.</ref>

Myxospores are extremely tough: "it was shown that ''Myxobolus cerebralis'' spores can tolerate freezing at ­-20°C for at least 3 months, aging in mud at 13°C for at least 5 months, and passage through the guts of [[northern pike]] ''Esox lucius'' or [[mallard]]s ''Anas platyrhynchos'' without loss of infectivity" to worms.<ref>El-Matbouli, M., and Hoffmann, R.W. (1991). Effects of freezing, aging, and passage through the alimentary canal of predatory animals on the viability of Myxobolus cerebralis spores. Journal of Aquatic Animal Health 3: 260–262.</ref>  Triactinomyxons are much shorter lived, surviving 34 days or less, depending on temperature.<ref name="Markiw2">Markiw, M.E. (1992).

==Pathology==
[[Image:Deformed_Brook_Trout.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Skeletal deformation in a mature [[Brook trout]] caused by ''M. cerebralis'' infection.  Photo by Dr. Thomas L. Wellborn, Jr.]]

''M. cerebralis'' infections have been reported from a wide range of salmonid species: 8 species of "Atlantic" salmonids, ''[[Salmo]]''; 4 species of "Pacific" salmonids, ''[[Oncorhynchus]]''; 4 species of Char, ''[[Salvelinus]]''; the Grayling, ''[[Thymallus thymallus]]''; and the Huchen, ''[[Hucho hucho]]''.<ref>Lom, J. & Dyková, I. (1992). Protozoan Parasites of Fishes, Elsevier, Amsterdam. ISBN 0-444-89434-9.</ref> ''M. cerebralis'' causes damage to its fish hosts through attachment of triactinomyxon spores and the migrations of various stages through tissues and along nerves, as well as by digesting cartilage.<ref name="Hedrick" />  The fish's tail may darken, but aside from lesions on cartilage, internal organs generally appear healthy.<ref name="Markiw" />  Other symptoms include skeletal deformities and "whirling" behavior (tail-chasing) in young fish, which was thought to have been caused by a loss of equilibrium, but is actually caused by damage to the spinal cord and lower brain stem.<ref name="Gilbert" />  Experiments have shown that fish can kill ''Myxobolus'' in their skin (possibly using [[antibodies]]), but that the fish do not attack the parasites once they have migrated to the central nervous system.  This response varies from species to species.<ref name="Gilbert" />

In ''T. tubifex'', the release of triactinomyxon spores from the [[intestine|intestinal]] wall damages the worm’s [[mucosa]]; this may happen thousands of times in a single worm, and it is believed that this can impair nutrient absorption.<ref name="Hedrick" />  Also, infected worms have lower body mass and may be discolored.<ref name="Gilbert" />  Spores are released from the worm almost exclusively when the temperature is between 10°C and 15°C, so fish in warmer or cooler waters are less likely to be infected, and infection rates vary seasonally.<ref name="Gilbert" />

===Susceptibility===
Fish size, age, concentration of triactinomyxon spores, and water temperature all affect infection rates in fish, as does the species of the fish in question.<ref>Vincent, E. R. (2002). Relative susceptibility of various salmonids to whirling disease with emphasis on rainbow and cutthroat trout.. American Fisheries Society Symposium 29: 109–115.</ref>  The disease has the biggest impact on fish less than five months old because their skeleton has not [[ossification|ossified]].  This makes young fish more susceptible to deformities<ref>Halliday, M.M. (1976). The Biology Of Myxosoma cerebralis: The Causative Organism Of Whirling Disease Of Salmonids. Journal of Fish Biology 9: 339–357.</ref> and provides ''M. cerebralis'' more cartilage on which to feed.<ref name="Gilbert" />  In one study of seven species of many strains, [[brook trout]] and [[rainbow trout]] (except one strain) were far more heavily affected by ''M. cerebralis'' after two hours of exposure than other species were, while [[bull trout]], [[Chinook salmon]], [[brown trout]], and [[arctic grayling]] were least severely affected.<ref>Vincent, E. R. (2002). Relative susceptibility of various salmonids to whirling disease with emphasis on rainbow and cutthroat trout.. American Fisheries Society Symposium 29: 109–115.</ref>  While brown trout may harbor the parasite, they typically do not show any symptoms, and this species may have been ''M. cerebralis''' original host.<ref>Hoffmann, G. (1962). Whirling Disease Of Trout. U.S. Department Of The Interior, Fishery Leaflet 508: 1–3.</ref>  This lack of symptoms in brown trout meant that the parasite was not discovered until after nonnative rainbow trout were introduced in Europe.<<ref name="Gilbert" />  The susceptibility of various salmonids is listed in [[Salmonid susceptibility to whirling disease]].

===Diagnosis===
[[Image:Whirling disease pathology.jpg|thumb|The normally uniform trout cartilage is scarred with lesions in which ''M. cerebralis'' spores develop, weakening and deforming the connective tissues.]]

Moderate or heavy clinical infection of fish with whirling disease can be presumptively diagnosed on the basis of changes in behavior and appearance about 35 to 80 days after initial infection, though "injury or deficiency in dietary [[tryptophan]] and [[ascorbic acid]] can evoke similar signs," so conclusive diagnosis may require finding myxospores in the fish's cartilage.<ref name="Markiw" />  In heavy infections, examining cartilage microscopically may be all that is needed to find spores.<ref name="Markiw" /> In less severe infections the most common test involves digestion of the cranial cartilage with the [[protease]]s [[pepsin]] and [[trypsin]] (the pepsin-trypsin digest&mdash;PTD) before looking for spores.  The head and other tissues can be further examined using [[histopathology]] to confirm that the location and morphology of the spores matches what is known for ''M. cerebralis''. Serological identification of spores in tissue sections using an [[antibody]] raised against the spores is also possible.  Parasite identity can also be confirmed using the [[polymerase chain reaction]] to amplify the 415 base pair [[18S rRNA]] [[gene]] from ''M. cerebralis''.<ref>Andree, K.B., MacConnell, E. and Hedrick, R.P. (1998). A nested polymerase chain reaction for the detection of genomic DNA of Myxobolus cerebralis in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Diseases of Aquatic Organisms 34: 145–54.</ref> Fish should be screened at the life stage most susceptible to the parasite. Routine screening using these techniques is carried out in countries where the parasite occurs and in countries like [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] that are not known to have the parasite but where its introduction could threaten local fish.

==Impact==
[[Image:Worldwide distribution of Mcerebralis.png|right|thumb|300px|''M. cerebralis'' has been reported in [[Germany]] (1893), [[Italy]] (1954), [[USSR]] (1955), including [[Sakhalin]] Island (1960), [[USA]] (1958), [[Bulgaria]] (1960), [[Yugoslavia]] (1960), [[Sweden]] (1966), [[South Africa]] (1966), [[Scotland]] (1968), [[New Zealand]] (1971), [[Ecuador]] (1971), [[Norway]] (1971),  [[Colombia]] (1972), [[Lebanon]] (1973), [[Ireland]] (1974), [[Spain]] (1981) and [[England]] (1981)]]
Although originally a mild pathogen of [[Brown trout|''Salmo trutta'']] in central Europe and other salmonids in north east Asia, the spread of the [[Rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'') has greatly increased the impact of this parasite. Having no innate immunity to ''M. cerebralis'', rainbow trout are particularly susceptible, and can release so many spores that even more resistant species in the same area, like ''S. trutta'', can become overloaded with parasites and incur 80%&ndash;90% mortalities.  Where ''M. cerebralis'' has become well-established, it has caused decline or even elimination of whole cohorts of fish.<ref>Nehring, R.B. (1996). Whirling Disease In Feral Trout Populations In Colorado. In E.P. Bergersen And B.A.Knoph (eds.), Proceedings: Whirling Disease Workshop––where Do We Go From Here? Colorado Cooperative Fish And Wildlife Research Unit, Fort Collins.: pp.159.</ref><ref>Vincent, E.R. (1996). Whirling Disease—the Montana Experience, Madison River.. In, E.P. Bergersen And B.A.Knoph (eds.), Proceedings: Whirling Disease Workshop—where Do We Go From Here? Colorado Cooperative Fish And Wildlife Research Unit, Fort Collins.: pp.159.</ref>

===Impact in Europe===
The impact of ''M. cerebralis'' in Europe is somewhat lessened by the fact that the species is endemic to this region, giving native [[fish stocks]] a degree of [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. [[Rainbow trout]], the most susceptible species to this parasite, are not native to Europe; successfully reproducing [[feral]] populations are rare, so there are few wild rainbow trout that are young enough to be susceptible to infection.  On the other hand, they are widely reared for restocking [[fishing#Recreational fishing|sport-fishing]] waters and for [[aquaculture]], where this parasite has its greatest impact. Hatching and rearing methods designed to prevent infection of Rainbow trout fry have proved successful in Europe. These techniques include hatching eggs in spore-free water and rearing fry to the "ossification" stage in tanks or raceways. These methods give particular attention to the quality of water sources in order to guard against spore introduction during water exchanges.<ref>Ghittino, P. (1970). Present Status Of Whirling Disease In Italian Trout Farms. Riv. It. Piscic. Ittiopat 5: 89–92.</ref> Fry are moved to earthen ponds only when they are considered to be clinically resistant to the parasite, after skeletal ossification occurs.<ref>Halliday, M.M. (1976). The Biology Of Myxosoma cerebralis: The Causative Organism Of Whirling Disease Of Salmonids. Journal of Fish Biology 9: 339–357.</ref>

===Impact in New Zealand===
''M. cerebralis'' was first found in [[New Zealand]] in 1971. The parasite has only been found in rivers in the South Island, away from the most important aquaculture sites.  Additionally, salmonid species commercially aquacultured in New Zealand have low susceptibility to whirling disease, and the parasite has also not been shown to affect native salmonids.<ref>Stone M A B, MacDiarmid S C, Pharo H J. (1997). Import health risk analysis: salmonids for human consumption. Ministry of Agriculture Regulatory Authority, New Zealand.[http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/pests-diseases/animals/risk/salmonids-ra.pdf]</ref> An important indirect effect of the parasites presence is [[quarantine]] restriction placed on [[export]]s of salmon products to [[Australia]].

===Impact in the United States===
[[image:US_Range_of_Mcerebralis.png|right|thumb|''M. cerebralis'' has been reported in nearly two dozen (green) states in the United States, according to the [http://whirlingdisease.montana.edu/ Whirling Disease Initiative]]]

''M. cerebralis'' was first recorded in North America in 1956 in [[Pennsylvania]], having been introduced via infected trout imported from Europe, and has spread steadily south and westwards.<ref>Bergersen, E.P., and Anderson, D.E. (1997). The distribution and spread of Myxobolus cerebralis in the United States. Fisheries 22 (8): 6–7.</ref> Until the 1990s, whirling disease was considered a manageable problem affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries. However, it has recently become established in natural waters of the Rocky Mountain states ([[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], [[New Mexico]]) where it is causing heavy mortalities in several sportfishing rivers. Some streams in the western United States have lost 90% of their trout.<ref>Tennyson, J. Anacker, T. & Higgins, S. (January 13, 1997). Scientific breakthrough helps combat trout disease. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Whirling Disease Foundation News Release.[http://www.r6.fws.gov/pressrel/97-01.HTM]</ref> In addition, whirling disease threatens recreational fishing, which is important for the tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states. For example, "the [[Montana]] Whirling Disease Task Force estimated that trout fishing generated US $300,000,000 in recreational expenditures in Montana alone".<ref name="Gilbert" /> Making matters worse, some of the fishes that ''M. cerebralis'' infects ([[bull trout]], [[cutthroat trout]], and [[steelhead]]) are already threatened or [[endangered species|endangered]], and the parasite could worsen their already precarious situations.<ref name="Gilbert" />  For reasons that are poorly understood, but probably have to do with environmental conditions, the impact on infected fish has been greatest in Colorado and Montana and least in [[California]], [[Michigan]], and [[New York]].<ref>Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. Division of Animal Health. (October 2001). "Fish Health Advisory: Whirling Disease in Trout." [http://www.datcp.state.wi.us/ah/agriculture/animals/aqua/health/pdf/whirlingdisease.pdf] (.pdf).</ref>

==Prevention and control==
Some biologists have attempted to disarm triactinomyxon spores by making them fire prematurely.  In the laboratory, only extreme [[acidity]] or [[basicity]], moderate to high concentrations of salts, or electrical current caused premature filament discharge; neurochemicals, cnidarian [[chemosensitizer]]s, and trout mucous were ineffective,<ref>Wagner, E. J. Cannon, Q. Smith, M. Hillyard, R. & Arndt, R. (2002). Extrusion of Polar Filaments of the Myxobolus cerebralis Triactinomyxon by salts, electricity, and other agents. American Fisheries Society Symposium 29: 61–76.</ref> as were anesthetized or dead fish.<ref>El-Matbouli, M., Hoffmann, R.W., Shoel, H., McDowell, T. S., & Hedrick, R.P. (1999). Whirling disease: host specificity and interaction between the actinosporean stage of Myxobolus cerebralis and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) cartilage. Diseases of Aquatic Organisms 35: 1–12.</ref>  If spores could be disarmed, they would be unable to infect fish, but it is unclear whether any of the methods that worked in the laboratory could be employed in the wild.

Some strains of fish are more resistant than others, even within species<ref>Vincent, E. R. (2002). Relative susceptibility of various salmonids to whirling disease with emphasis on rainbow and cutthroat trout.. American Fisheries Society Symposium 29: 109–115.</ref>; using resistant strains may help reduce the incidence and severity of whirling disease in aquaculture.  There is also some circumstantial evidence that fish populations can develop resistance to the disease over time.<ref>Whirling Disease Foundation News. July, 2003. [http://www.whirling-disease.org/newsletters/wdf_newsletter2003_07.htm Research on whirling disease resistant rainbow trout]</ref>  Additionally, [[aquaculture|aquaculturists]] may avoid ''M. cerebralis'' infections by not using earthen ponds for raising young fish; this keeps them away from possibly infected tubificids and makes it easier to eliminate spores and oligochaetes through filtration, chlorination, and ultraviolet bombardment.<ref name="Markiw" /> To minimise tubificid population techniques include periodic disinfection of the hatchery or aquaculture ponds and the rearing of small trout indoors in pathogen-free water. Smooth-faced concrete or plastic-lined raceways that are kept clean and free of contaminated water keep aquaculture facilities free of the disease.<ref name="Markiw" />

Lastly, some drugs such as [[furazolidone]], [[furoxone]], [[benomyl]], [[fumagillin]], [[proguanil]] and [[clamoxyquine]] have been shown to impede spore development, which reduces infection rates.<ref name="Markiw" />  For example, one study showed that feeding Fumagillin to ''[[Oncorhynchus mykiss]]'' reduced the number of infected fish from between 73% and 100% to between 10% and 20%.<ref>El-Matbouli, M., and Hoffmann, R.W. (1991). Effects of freezing, aging, and passage through the alimentary canal of predatory animals on the viability of Myxobolus cerebralis spores. Journal of Aquatic Animal Health 3: 260–262.</ref>  Unfortunately, this treatment is considered unsuitable for wild trout populations,<ref>El-Matbouli, M., and Hoffmann, R.W. (1998). Light and electron microscopic studies on the chronological development of Myxobolus cerebralis to the Actinosporean stage in Tubifex Tubifes. International Journal For Parasitology 28: 195–217.</ref> and no drug treatment has ever been shown to be effective in the studies required for [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] approval.<ref name="Gilbert" />

Recreational and sports fishers can help to prevent the spread of the parasite in a number of ways. Cleaning fishing equipment between fishing trips and never transporting fish from one body of water to another should protect against cross contamination of waterways. Spores are particularly persistent in felt soled wading shoes, which can be treated with 10% chlorine [[bleach]] and water for at least 15 minutes and then rinsed thoroughly. Fish [[bone]]s or entrails should never be disposed of in any body of water, since spores from the carcass will be released into the waterway. Salmon and trout should not be used as [[bait (luring substance)|bait]].
