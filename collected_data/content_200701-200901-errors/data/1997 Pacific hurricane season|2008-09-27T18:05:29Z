The '''1997 Pacific hurricane season''' was an annual event in [[tropical cyclone]] [[meteorology]]. It was one of the most active seasons. With hundreds of deaths and billions of dollars in damage, this season was the costliest and one of the deadliest [[list of Pacific hurricane seasons|Pacific hurricane seasons]].

Hurricanes Linda, Pauline, and Nora were the most notable storms in 1997. [[Hurricane Linda (1997)|Linda]] became the most intense east Pacific hurricane in recorded history. [[Hurricane Pauline]] killed several hundred people in [[Mexico]] due to heavy flooding, while [[Hurricane Nora (1997)|Hurricane Nora]] caused flooding and damage in the [[Southwestern United States]]. In addition, Super Typhoons Oliwa and [[Typhoon Paka|Paka]] originated in region before crossing the International Date Line and causing significant damage in the western Pacific.

==Season summary==
{{Saffir-Simpson small}}

The 1997 Pacific hurricane season officially started on [[May 15]], [[1997]] in the eastern Pacific, and on [[June 1]], [[1997]] in the central Pacific, and lasted until [[November 30]], [[1997]]. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name=Dorst>{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html|title=Subject: G1) When is hurricane season?|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|author=Neal Dorst|work=FAQ: Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Tropical Cyclones|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref> This season exceeded these boundaries appreciably, as Tropical Storm Paka formed [[December 2]], and dissipated nineteen days later after moving into the Western Pacific.<ref name="best track">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2007_epa.txt|format=plain text|date=2008-03-21|title=Eastern North Pacific Tracks File 1949-2007|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref>

The 1997 Pacific hurricane season was fairly active, due to the strong [[El Niño]] that was occurring at the time. El Niño causes wind shear to be reduced and water temperatures to increase, resulting in conditions more favourable for tropical cyclones in the East Pacific.

There were 24 cyclones in total, including five unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 19 were in the east Pacific (east of 140° W). Of these, eight peaked at tropical storm intensity, while ten reached hurricane status. Seven of these reached Category&nbsp;3 intensity or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale]], including central Pacific cyclones Super Typhoons Oliwa and [[Typhoon Paka|Paka]], which became typhoons after crossing into the western Pacific.<ref name="best track"/>

Activity in the central Pacific was also above average. Two tropical storms formed, as did several tropical depressions. A number of storms moved in from the east. With a total of nine tropical cyclones entering or forming there, this was the fourth highest number since satellite observations began.<ref name="CPHCCycloneTotal">{{cite web|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1997.php|publisher=[[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]]|title=The 1997 Central Pacific Tropical Cyclone Season|accessdate=2005-10-24|author=Benjamin C. Hablutzel, Hans E. Rosendal, James C. Weyman, & Jonathan D. Hoag}}</ref>

The first storm formed on June 1. The last storm dissipated December 21, which gives this season the latest known end. However, if December 6, the date the last storm crossed the dateline is taken to be the end, this season has the second latest end, behind the [[1983 Pacific hurricane season|1983 season]] and tied with [[1950-1969 Pacific hurricane seasons#1957 season|1957 season]].<ref name="best track"/>

Andres originated as a disturbance that had slowly organized formed into Tropical Depression One-E on June 1. The next day, it reached tropical storm status. After a brief period of a normal track to the northwest, Andres was picked up by westerly winds and became the first named storm to threaten [[Central America]]. Initially forecast to cross the isthmus and enter the [[Caribbean Sea]], Andres instead turned to the southeast and paralleled the coast. This was the first time since record-keeping began that any East Pacific storm had taken such a path. Andres then turned back to the northeast. It weakened to a depression and made landfall near [[San Salvador, El Salvador|San Salvador]] on June 7 and dissipated shortly thereafter.<ref name="NHCAndres">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1997andres.html|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|title=Preliminary Report Tropical Storm Andres|accessdate=2005-10-24|author=[[Edward Rappaport]]|date=1997-06-18}}</ref>

Tropical Depression Eight-E, the storm that would become Felicia, formed south of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] port of [[Manzanillo, Colima]], on July 13. Its development was delayed by [[wind shear]] due to its proximity to Enrique. It became a tropical storm late July 15 as it moved west-northwestward. It became a hurricane July 17. Its development was again stalled by shear. After the shear let up, Felicia’s winds reached {{convert|215|km/h|mph}} and its pressure fell to 948&nbsp;mbar (948&nbsp;hPa), making it the second major hurricane of the season and the first Category&nbsp;4.

Tropical Storm Olaf was a weak but persistent tropical storm that made two landfalls and took an erratic path. A tropical depression formed September 26, was upgraded a tropical storm at the next advisory. The cyclone immediately moved north. Instead of strengthening into a hurricane as forecast, Olaf unexpectedly weakened. On September 29, Olaf made landfall near [[Salina Cruz]], [[Oaxaca]].<ref name="NHCOlaf">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1997olaf.html|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|title=Preliminary Report Tropical Storm Olaf|date=1997-11-05|accessdate=2005-10-24|author=[[Lixion Avila]]}}</ref>

Olaf, as a tropical depression, moved westward, far out to sea. Restrengthening, Olaf moved southeast on October 5 due to the influence of [[Hurricane Pauline]]. Olaf then turned north, and on October 12 made a second landfall near [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], [[Colima]], as a tropical depression. Olaf's surface circulation weakened, and its remnants moved back out to sea, not to return.<ref name="NHCOlaf"/>

Olaf resulted in some reports of damage and flooding in Mexico and Guatemala. Several people were reported missing.

{{hurricane main|Hurricane Pauline}}
Tropical depression Eighteen-E formed October 5. In a favourable environment, the cyclone to rapidly intensified, reaching Category&nbsp;4 intensity. After twice peaking at that intensity, interaction with land weakened Pauline to a Category&nbsp;2 by the time it made landfall on October 9. It accelerated to the northwest, and passed over a mountainous region. The mountains disrupted Pauline's circulation, and squeezed the moisture from the hurricane. Pauline dissipated on October 10 while over [[Jalisco]].<ref name="NHCPauline">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1997pauline.html|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Pauline|date=1997-11-07|author=Miles Lawrence|accessdate=2005-10-24}}</ref>

Hurricane Pauline was the deadliest storm of the season. Landslides and flooding caused by heavy rain caused tragic loss of life and left thousands homeless. There were at least 230 casualties. The [[Red Cross]] reported that 400&nbsp;people died, but this was disputed by Mexican officials. Pauline was Mexico's deadliest hurricane since [[Hurricane Liza (1976)|1976's Liza]].<ref name="NHCPauline"/> In addition, the hurricane caused $7.5&nbsp;billion in damage (1997&nbsp;USD; $10&nbsp;billion 2008&nbsp;USD), making it the costliest Pacific hurricane in recorded history.<ref name="pauldam">[http://www.cofemermir.gob.mx/uploadtests/4054.66.59.1.STAD%C3%8DSTICAS-RIESGOS-ATENUAR.DOC Estadísticas sobre los Riesgos a atenuar de Fenómenos Perturbadores]</ref><!--Source gives 80,000,000,000 pesos in damage. -->

Hurricane Rick was the first case of November [[tropical cyclogenesis]] in this basin since the [[1991 Pacific hurricane season|1991 season]].<ref name="best track"/> A [[tropical wave]] acquired enough organization to be called a tropical depression on November 7. It moved north before a trough of [[low pressure area|low pressure]] turned it to the northeast. It was named on November 8, and was upgraded to a hurricane the next day. It reached its peak intensity of {{convert|160|km/h|mph}} and 973&nbsp;mbar (973&nbsp;hPa).

<!-- ===Other storms===
In addition to the named storms, there were also five tropical depressions that did not reach storm strength. Two of the depressions were in the eastern Pacific while three formed in the central Pacific. None of them threatened land.

Tropical Depression Three-E formed [[June 21]]. Moving rapidly westward, it never strengthened and dissipated early on [[June 24]]. Several days later, on [[June 29]], Five-E formed at midday and erratically moved to the west. After slowing down greatly, the depression dissipated on [[July 4]].

Tropical Depression One-C formed on [[July 26]] from a disturbance that had been showing signs of development for three days. It moved west to southwest through an unfavorable environment. On the morning of [[July 27]], it was destroyed by wind shear caused by an upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. Tropical Depression Three-C was formed when a tropical disturbance organized into a depression on [[October 6]]. It moved slowly moved westward without intensifying, and dissipated the next day. Nearly a month later, Tropical Depression Four-C formed at night on [[October 30]] and in a similar location to where One-C formed. Moving westward, it weakened gradually when it encountered a large [[air mass|mass]] of dry air, and dissipated late on [[October 31]]. -->

The season began with the formation of Tropical Depression One-E on [[June 1]] and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Depression Paka on [[December 22]]. The season can alternatively be considered to end on [[December 6]], the day Tropical Storm Paka crossed the [[international dateline]]. No named storms formed in May, three in June, four in July, four in August, five in September, one in October, and one in November. Very unusually, a tropical storm formed in December, after the season ended. The only other time this happened since the [[weather satellite|satellite]] era began was in [[1983 Pacific hurricane season|1983]].

[[Accumulated Cyclone Energy]] (ACE) is a measure of how active a hurricane season is. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 10<sup>4</sup>. This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher ACE than Linda. It was not as strong as that storm, but because it was above tropical storm force for a longer time, it reached a higher ACE level. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three [[significant figures]]. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the international dateline to 140°W) is given in brackets.

The table includes the ACE for Oliwa and Paka only during those storm's time east of the dateline. Their ACE west of the dateline is part of the totals of the [[1997 Pacific typhoon season|1997 typhoon season]].

The Nation Hurricane Center uses ACE to rank hurricane seasons as above-normal, near-normal, and below-normal. It defines below-normal as having an ACE less than 95*10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;kt<sup>2</sup> kt<sup>2</sup>; It defines above normal as having an ACE above 150*10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;kt<sup>2</sup> along with the numbers of any two of the following above average: tropical storms (15), hurricanes (9), or major hurricanes (4); It defines near-normal as having an ACE between 100*10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;kt<sup>2</sup> and 150*10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;kt<sup>2</sup>, or an ACE above 150*10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;kt<sup>2</sup> with fewer than two of the numbers of the following above average: tropical storms (15), hurricanes (9), or major hurricanes (4).<ref name="NOAAACE">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Epac_hurr/background_information.html|author=Climate Prediction Center|title=Background Information: East Pacific Hurricane Season|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>

This season has a total of 17 tropical storms, 9 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes. The total ACE of this season is 160*10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;kt<sup>2</sup> in the east Pacific proper. This qualifies this season as above-normal.<ref name=Graph>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Epac_hurr/figure2.gif|author=Climate Prediction Center|title=East Pacific Hurricane Season Activity NOAA's Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>

==Storm names==
The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1997. Names that were not assigned are marked in <font color="gray">gray</font>. The names not retired from this list were used again in the [[2003 Pacific hurricane season|2003 season]]. This is the same list used for the [[1991 Pacific hurricane season|1991 season]] except for Felicia, which replaced [[Hurricane Fefa|Fefa]]. A storm was named Felicia for the first time in 1997. Also, the name "Dolores" was misspelled "Delores" in the 1991 season; in this and subsequent seasons, the typo was corrected.<ref name="ATWCMispelling">{{cite web|url=http://www.atwc.org/pachist.txt|format=plain text|publisher=Atlantic Tropical Weather Center|title=Pacific hurricane name history|accessdate=2005-10-24.</ref>
