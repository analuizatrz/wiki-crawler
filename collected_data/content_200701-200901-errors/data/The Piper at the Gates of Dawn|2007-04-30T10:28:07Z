'''''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn''''' is [[Pink Floyd]]'s debut album and the only one made under [[Syd Barrett]]'s leadership, although he made some contributions to the follow-up, ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]''. It has been regarded as one of the most influential LPs ever made, being a tremendous influence on the [[psychedelic rock]] scene of the time, and much of what followed. The album has whimsical lyrics about [[space]], [[scarecrow]]s, [[gnome]]s, [[bicycle]]s and [[fairytale]]s, along with [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] [[instrumental rock|instrumental]] passages. 

In 2000 [[Q magazine|''Q'' magazine]] placed ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'' at number 55 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. {{RS500|347}}[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6599401/347_the_piper_at_the_gates_of_dawn]

== Recording history ==
The album was recorded during [[February]] [[1967]] in studio three of [[Abbey Road Studios]] at the same time [[The Beatles]] were recording ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. The album was produced by [[Norman Smith]], an [[EMI]] staff member who had previously engineered all of The Beatles recordings up to [[1965]]s ''[[Rubber Soul]]''. Smith would go on to produce Pink Floyd's follow up album, ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]''. "[[Interstellar Overdrive]]" and "[[Matilda Mother]]" were two of the first tracks recorded, as the latter was viewed as a potential single. "Interstellar Overdrive"s kinetic and spacey production, came from the insistence of the normally conservative Norman Smith, whose work on the record is often criticised because it is seen that he tried to make the album more pop orientated. At some point during the album's creation, [[Nick Mason]] recalled that they were "ushered" into studio 2 where The Beatles were recording "[[Lovely Rita]]". Several conflicting views surrond how efficiently the [[recording]] of the album actually went. In his book ''[[Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd]]'', Nick Mason recalled that the sessions went smoothly and that the whole process was extremely efficient. Norman Smith however, condemned both the albums recording and the band members musical ablities. Smith would later state that the sessions were "sheer hell". However, both "[[The Gnome]]" and "[[The Scarecrow (Pink Floyd song)|The Scarecrow]]" were recorded in one take. Unlike subsequent Pink Floyd albums, Roger Waters contribution to Piper is minimal, with the song "[[Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk]]" being his sole writing credit. Indeed a large proportion of the album is credited solely to Barrett, with tracks such as "[[Bike (song)|Bike]]" having been written in late 1966 before the album was even started.

== Album Cover and Title ==
[http://www.vicsingh.co.uk/pinkfloyd.htm Vic Singh] photographed and designed the album cover, unlike subsequent Pink Floyd albums. The album's title comes from the title of the seventh chapter of [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s ''[[Wind in the Willows|The Wind in the Willows]]'', where Water Rat and Mole, while searching for a lost animal, have a spiritual experience. ''"This is the place of my song-dream, the place the music played to me," whispered the Rat, as if in a trance. "Here, in this holy place, here if anywhere, surely we shall find Him!"''. The ''Piper'' referred to is the Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].

==Release history==
The [[gramophone record|LP]] (with a [[monaural]] mix) was released on [[August 5]], [[1967]], and one month later it was released in [[Stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] mix. It reached #6 on the UK charts, and its US version (entitled simply ''Pink Floyd'' and featuring a re-arranged and abbreviated tracklisting) reached #131 on the US charts. "See Emily Play" substituted "Astronomy Domine", "Flaming" and "Bike" on the original US vinyl issue. The stereo mix of the album was first released on [[compact disc|CD]] in 1987, and re-released as a digitally re-mastered CD in 1994 and then in June of 1995 in the US. Three years later, EMI released a re-mastered, limited-run mono mix version in a hefty [[digipak]] with [[Three-dimensional space|3-D]] box art for continental Europe and the world outside America. This was however not the same mix as the now ultra-rare mono LP.
