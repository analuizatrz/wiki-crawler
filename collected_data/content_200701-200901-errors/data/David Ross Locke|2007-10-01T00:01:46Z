'''David Ross Locke''' (also known by his [[pseudonym]] '''Petroleum V. Nasby''') ([[September 20]], [[1833]] &ndash; [[February 15]], [[1888]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[journalist]] and early political commentator during the [[American Civil War]]. 

Locke's most famous work, the "Nasby Letters," was written in the character of, and over the signature of "Rev. Petroleum V(esuvius) Nasby" a [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] and [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]. They have been described as "The Civil War written in sulphuric acid." 

Locke was originally from Vestal, [[Broome County, New York]]. He edited, and wrote for, the [[Toledo, Ohio]] newspaper the ''[[Toledo Blade]]''. He was apprenticed at age 10 to the newspaper, the ''Democrat'' in [[Cortland County, New York]]. Following a seven-year apprenticeship, he tramped around until his next protracted stay being with the ''Pittsburgh Chronicle.'' Around 1855, Locke started, with others, the [[Plymouth, Ohio]] ''Herald.'' On [[March 20]] [[1856]], became the editor of the ''Bucyrus Journal.'' Locke was in [[Bucyrus, Ohio|Bucyrus]], when the Civil War broke out.

"Nasby" loudly championed the cause of the [[Confederate States of America]] from [[secession]] onward, but did little to actively abet it. After being [[conscripted]] into the [[Union Army]] he deserted to the Confederates, joining the fictional "Pelican Brigade."  However, he found life in the [[Confederate Army]] "tite nippin" and soon deserted again. By the end of the Civil War he was back in civilian life.

The "Nasby Letters", written in the semi-literate spelling used by other humorists of the time, were intended to rally support for the Union cause, since "Nasby" himself was portrayed as a thoroughly detestable character - a supreme opportunist, bigoted, work-shy, often half-drunk, and willing to say or do anything to get a [[Postmaster]]'s job. At the time the Letters were written, Postmasterships were political plums, offering a guaranteed federal salary for little or no real work. Until the glorious day when he received a "Post Orfis" from [[Andrew Johnson]] "Nasby" worked, when he worked, most frequently as a preacher. His favorite Biblical texts, unsurprisingly, were the ones that were used by Southern ministers to "prove" that [[slavery]] was ordained by the [[Bible]].  

[[Abraham Lincoln]] loved the "Nasby Letters," and quoted them frequently. He is quoted as saying, "...I intend to tell him if he will communicate his talent to me, I will swap places with him!" ([http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2517]).

After the Civil War, "Nasby" went on to comment on [[Reconstruction]]. He settled in several different places, most notably "Confedrit X Roads, which is in the Stait of Kentucky", a fictional town full of idle, whisky-loving, scrounging ex-Confederates, and a few hard-working, decent folk, who by an amazing coincidence were all strong Republicans. He travelled frequently, sometimes not entirely voluntarily ("Nasby's" habit of borrowing money he never repaid, and running up tabs at the local [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] often made him unpopular) and continued to comment on the issues of the day.  

Locke discontinued the "Nasby Letters" a few years before his death, since the times had changed and "Nasby" was no longer topical.  While the semi-literate spelling in which they are written has often discouraged modern readers, it can also be seen as a point of characterizing "Nasby."

Several collections of the "Letters" came out in book form, some illustrated by [[Thomas Nast]], who was a friend and political ally of Locke.
