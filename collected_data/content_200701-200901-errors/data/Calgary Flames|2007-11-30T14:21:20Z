The '''Calgary Flames''' are a [[professional]]  [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] and play out of the [[Pengrowth Saddledome]]. They are members of the [[Northwest Division (NHL)|Northwest Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).

The Flames arrived in the city of Calgary in 1980 after spending their first eight seasons in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as the [[Atlanta Flames]].  The Flames are the third major-professional team to represent the city of Calgary, following the [[Calgary Tigers]] (1921-26) and [[Calgary Cowboys]] (1975-77).  In [[1985-86 Calgary Flames season|1986]], the Flames became the first Calgary team since the [[1923-24 WCHL season|1924 Tigers]] to compete for the [[Stanley Cup]].  In [[1988-89 Calgary Flames season|1989]], the Flames captured the Cup for the first time.

The Flames are the only NHL club to relocate from the [[United States]] to Canada, and are also the only NHL club to retain its nickname after a relocation. (The [[Dallas Stars]] shortened their name after moving from [[Minneapolis]] as the [[Minnesota North Stars|North Stars]].)  The Flames spent their first three seasons playing in the [[Stampede Corral]], during which they lost only 32 games,<ref>{{cite book |title=2006-07 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames |pages=pg. 4}}</ref> before moving into the [[Pengrowth Saddledome|Olympic Saddledome]] in 1983.

Calgary's top rival are their Alberta cousins, the [[Edmonton Oilers]].  The two teams have often feuded in what is known as the [[Battle of Alberta]], an always feisty event.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |author= |title=The uncivil war...Edmonton...April 23, 1988...Oilers 4 Flames 2 |url=http://www.slam.ca/Slam030917/col_francis-sun.html |publisher=[[Calgary Sun]] |date=2003-09-17 |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |author= |title=The uncivil war...Calgary...January 20, 2003...Flames 3 Oilers 2 |url=http://fun.canoe.ca/Slam030921/col_francis-sun.html |publisher=[[Calgary Sun]] |date=2003-09-21 |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}</ref>

==Franchise history==
===Atlanta years (1972-80)===
{{details|Atlanta Flames}}

The Flames were the result of the NHL's first preemptive strike against the upstart [[World Hockey Association]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Boer |first=Peter |authorlink= |title=The Calgary Flames |year=2006 |pages=12 |publisher=Overtime Books |isbn=1-897277-07-5 }}</ref>  In December [[1971-72 NHL season|1971]], the NHL hastily granted a team to [[Long Island]] &mdash; the [[New York Islanders]] &mdash; in order to keep the WHA's [[New York Raiders]] out of the brand new [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]]. Needing another team to balance the schedule, the NHL awarded a team to an [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]-based group that owned the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Atlanta Hawks]], headed by prominent local real estate developer [[Tom Cousins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/nyi/nylsanders.html|title=History of the New York Islanders|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Cousins named the team the "Flames" after the [[fire]] resulting from the [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] in the [[American Civil War]] by [[General William Tecumseh Sherman]], in which Atlanta was nearly destroyed.<ref name="atlflames">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/atlflames/aflames.html|title=History of the Atlanta Flames|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>

The Flames were relatively successful early on.  Under head coaches [[Bernie Geoffrion|Bernie “Boom Boom” Geoffrion]], [[Fred Creighton]] and [[Al MacNeil]], the Flames made the playoffs in six of eight seasons in Atlanta. In marked contrast, their expansion cousins, the Islanders, compiled two of the worst seasons in NHL history during their first two years in the league.  This relative success would not translate in the playoffs, however, as the Flames won only two post season games during their time in Atlanta.<ref>Playoff history, ''2006-07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pg. 219</ref>

Despite the on-ice success, the Atlanta ownership was never on sound financial footing. Part of the reason was that the Flames' home arena, [[The Omni]], was one of the last arenas to be built without revenue-producing luxury boxes.  Also, Cousins' initial calcuations did not account for the WHA entering the picture.<ref name="fletcher">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/halloffame/fletcher110304.html |title=Building a franchise is Flether's forte |accessdate=2006-11-28 |last=McGourty |first=John |date=2004-11-03 |publisher=nhl.com}}</ref>  The Flames were also victims of their own early success, which resulted in several low draft picks. At the same time, the Islanders used high draft picks resulting from their first two wretched seasons to put together the core of a team that would win four [[Stanley Cups]] in a row in the early [[1980s]].

In 1980, Cousins was in considerable financial difficulty, and was forced to sell the Flames to stave off bankruptcy. With few serious offers from local groups, he sold the Flames to a group of Calgary businessmen fronted by Canadian entrepreneur, and former owner of the Oilers, [[Nelson Skalbania]].<ref name="atlflames">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/atlflames/aflames.html|title=History of the Atlanta Flames|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>  The price of US$16 million was the highest price paid for an NHL franchise at the time. Skalbania promptly moved the team to Calgary, but kept the Flames name since he figured it would be appropriate for an oil town like Calgary. The flaming "A" logo was replaced by a flaming "C" (the "A" was later brought back as the "A" on the alternate captains' jerseys). Skalbania sold his interest in 1981, and the Flames have been locally owned since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/legacy/contributions_owners_nelsonskalbania2.html|title=Nelson Skalbania|work=Edmonton Oilers Heritage|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>

===Early Years in Calgary (1980-85)===
[[Image:Calgary Flames logo 1980-1994.png|150px|left|thumb|The original Flames logo, used from 1980-94. A black outline was added in 1995.]]
Led by [[Kent Nilsson]]'s 49-goal, 131-point season, the Flames stormed into the playoffs in their first season in Calgary with a 39-27-4 record, good for third in the [[Patrick Division]]. The team found much greater playoff success in Calgary than it did in Atlanta, winning their first two playoff series over the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] and [[Philadelphia Flyers]] before bowing out to the [[Minnesota North Stars]] in the semi-finals.<ref>1980-81 season, ''2006-07 Calgary Flames Media Guide, pg. 131</ref>  This early success was not soon repeated. After a losing record in [[1981-82 NHL season|1981-82]], General Manager [[Cliff Fletcher]] jettisoned several former Atlanta players unused to a higher-pressure hockey environment and rebuilt the roster.<ref>Boer, pg. 51</ref> Over the next three seasons, he put together a core of players that would remain together through the early [[1990s]]. His efforts to match the Oilers, led him to draw talent from areas previously neglected by the NHL. The Flames were one of the first teams to sign large numbers of U.S. college players, including [[Joel Otto]], [[Gary Suter]], and [[Colin Patterson]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Fletcher also stepped up the search for European hockey talent, acquiring [[Hakan Loob]] and other key players. He was among the first to [[NHL Entry Draft|draft]] players from the [[Soviet Union]], including [[HC CSKA Moscow]] star [[Sergei Makarov]], but Soviet players were not released to Western teams until 1989.<ref name="soviet">Dolezar, John A., [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2002/09/27/soviet_legacy/ Sweeping changes], cnnsi.com, September 27, 2002</ref> Still, the team was sufficiently improved to challenge the Oilers, who required the maximum seven games to defeat the Flames en route to their [[1983-84 NHL season|1984]] [[Stanley Cup]] Championship.

===Glory years (1985-89)===
Fletcher's roster moves in 1982 allowed the Flames to become one of the NHL's best teams during the mid-[[1980s]] and early [[1990s]]. They failed to earn 90 points in the regular season only once from 1984 to 1991, but were usually unable to transfer that success into a deep playoff run. The NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in the conference finals. Many observers thought that during the mid-1980s, the Oilers and Flames were far and away the two best teams in the Campbell Conference, and possibly the two best teams in the league.  For example, the Flames had their first 100-point season in [[1987-88 NHL season|1987-88]], earning the [[Presidents' Trophy]] for having the league's best record, and ended the Oilers' six-year reign atop the Smythe Division in the process.  However, they were swept by the Oilers in the second round of the playoffs.  The two teams' bitter rivalry mirrored the longstanding rivalry between their two cities. 

By [[1985-86 NHL season|1986]] the Flames had landed forwards [[Doug Risebrough]], [[Lanny McDonald]], [[Dan Quinn]], defenceman [[Al MacInnis]], and goalie [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]]. They beat the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in the first round, beat the Oilers in the second round, with the series winning goal scored when Edmonton's [[James Stephen Smith|Steve Smith]]'s accidentally shot the puck off of [[Grant Fuhr]]'s leg and into his own net in the deciding game, and also won in seven games over the [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]], shaking off the famous "Monday Night Miracle" at [[St. Louis Arena|The Arena]] - where [[Doug Wickenheiser]] scored in overtime to cap off a comeback from 5-2 down with 10 minutes to play - winning the deciding game at home. They were, however, no match for the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the finals, losing in five games.  Montreal [[rookie]] goaltender [[Patrick Roy]], was nearly unstoppable in the last two games, allowing only four goals. 

On [[March 7]], [[1988]], the Flames traded away young future superstar [[Brett Hull]] along with [[Steve Bozek]] to the Blues for [[Rob Ramage]] and [[Rick Wamsley]].  Nonetheless, the Flames dominated the [[1988-89 NHL season|1988-89 season]].  They won their second straight President's Trophy with 117 points--still a franchise record.  They ran away with their second straight Smythe Division title, finishing 26 points ahead of the [[Los Angeles Kings]]. In the playoffs, the Flames were stretched to seven games in the first round by the Canucks, relying on several key saves by goaltender [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]], before finally eliminating the Canucks in overtime. The Flames then made short work of the Kings, sweeping Los Angeles in four straight before defeating the Blackhawks in five to set up a rematch of the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals against Montreal.  This time, the Flames won in six games, the last being a 4-2 win in Montreal. This victory was especially significant in that it marked the only time that an opposing team defeated the Canadiens to win the Stanley Cup on [[Montreal Forum]] ice.<ref name="lanny">McGourty, John, [http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/cup/mcdonald052301.html Lanny, Stanley into the sunset], nhl.com, May 23, 2001</ref> Longtime captain Lanny McDonald retired at the end of the season.

In 1989, thanks in part to Cliff Fletcher's diplomatic efforts, the Soviets finally gave permission for a select group of Soviet hockey players to sign with NHL teams. The first of these players was [[Sergei Pryakhin]]. Although Pryakhin never became an NHL regular, his arrival blazed a trail for the large numbers of Russian players who entered the NHL beginning in [[1989-90 NHL season|1989-90]].<ref name="soviet" /> Sergei Makarov joined the Flames that season and, though already in his thirties, became the fifth Flame to win the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as the league's Rookie of the Year. The selection would prove controversial, prompting the league to amend the rules to exclude any player over the age of 26 from consideration.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DA103EF933A15755C0A966958260 New Rules for Rookies], New York Times, June 20, 1990, accessed June 10, 2007</ref>

===Decline (1990-2003)===
In 1991, Fletcher left the Flames to become the General Manager of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] after 18 years at the head of the organization.<ref>Shea, Kevin, [http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/spot_oneononeb200401.htm One on One with Cliff Fletcher], legendsofhockey.net, accessed May 14, 2007</ref>  He was succeeded by Doug Risebrough, and the two quickly completed a ten player mega trade that saw disgruntled forward [[Doug Gilmour]] dealt to Toronto with four other players for former 50-goal scorer [[Gary Leeman]] and four others.<ref name="gilmourtrade">Dolezar, Jon A., [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/news/2001/08/08/sayitaintso_flames/ Say it aint so: Calgary Flames], cnnsi.com, August 8, 2001, Accessed May 14, 2007</ref>  The trade transformed both clubs.  The formerly inept Leafs turned into a contender almost immediately, while the deal is widely believed to have been the beginning of the Flames' long decline.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/03/13/leafs_flames030313.html Gilmour begins again with Leafs in Calgary], cbc.ca, March 13, 2003, accessed May 14, 2007</ref>   Despite the blossoming of [[Theoren Fleury]] into an NHL star, the Flames missed the playoffs entirely in [[1991-92 NHL season|1992]], only a year after finishing with their third 100-point season in franchise history.  It was the first time the Flames had missed the playoffs since [[1974-75 NHL season|1975]], while they were still in Atlanta.  It was also only the third time out of the playoffs for the franchise.

[[Image:Calgary Flames horse head logo.png|left|thumb|150px|Calgary's alternate logo 1999-2007; Horse Head]]
They rebounded to make the playoffs for the next three seasons, including two consecutive division titles. However, they failed to get out of the first round in either year. More importantly, the Flames found it increasingly difficult to hold onto their best players as salaries escalated in the 90s. The NHL's Canadian teams (with the notable exceptions of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver) found it difficult to compete in the new environment. As a result, the collapse was sudden, swift and total. In [[1996-97 NHL season|1997]], a year after winning their second consecutive division title, the Flames missed the playoffs and would not return for seven years. 

In [[1998-99 NHL season|1999]], the Flames traded Fleury rather than lose him to free agency.  The deal occurred only a few days after he became the franchise's all-time leading scorer.  One of the few bright spots in this stretch was [[Jarome Iginla]]. Iginla won the [[Rocket Richard Trophy|Rocket Richard]] and [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross]] Trophies in 2001-02 after scoring 52 goals and 96 points, his greatest point total to date. Iginla again won the Rocket Richard Trophy, tied with [[Rick Nash]] and [[Ilya Kovalchuk]] with 41 goals in [[2003-04 NHL season|2003-04]]. Another bright spot for the team during this time was defenceman [[Robyn Regehr]], who became the youngest nominee ever for the [[Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy]], which recognizes perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey, in [[1999-2000 NHL season|his rookie year]], despite suffering two broken legs in a car accident the previous summer.<ref>Robyn Regehr player profile, ''2006-07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pg. 61</ref>

===2004 playoff run===
{{main|2003-04 Calgary Flames season}}
After seven consecutive seasons out of the playoffs, the Flames finally returned to the post-season in 2004.  The Flames stunned the hockey world by defeating the three Western Conference division champions to become the first Canadian team in a decade to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/05/19/sharks_flames040519.html |title=Flames reach Stanley Cup finals |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2004-05-20 |publisher=cbc.ca}}</ref> The 
Flames' first victim was the Northwest Division champion Vancouver Canucks, whom they defeated in seven games. It was the Flames' first playoff series win since they won the 1989 final.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/recap?gid=2004041922 |title=Recap: Calgary 3, Vancouver 2, OT |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2004-04-20 |publisher=Yahoo! Sports}}</ref>

The Flames then upset the [[Detroit Red Wings]], who had garnered the league's best record that season, in six games. After eliminating the Pacific Division champs, the [[San Jose Sharks]], in six games in the Western Conference finals, the Flames earned a trip to the [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals]] to face the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]]. The Canadian Embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]] flew the Flames flag beside the Maple Leaf,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_hwang/20040528.html |title=Cheering for the home team |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2004-05-28 |last=Hwang |first=Rosa |publisher=cbc.ca}}</ref>
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Iggy_dude.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Calgary Flames [[Jarome Iginla]] Trys to score on [[Alex Auld]] In The 2003-2004 Playoffs.]] -->The final series went to seven games, with the Flames suffering a controversial non-goal in game six at home.  Replays showed that [[Martin Gelinas]] came close to scoring what would have been the go-ahead goal late in the third period, however the referees ruled it a non-goal, and later replays were ruled inconclusive.  The Lightning would go on to win in [[overtime (hockey)|double overtime]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Damian |last=Cristodero |title= One last shot |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/06/06/Lightning/One_last_shot.shtml |publisher=St. Petersberg Times |date=2004-06-06 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> before winning game seven at home to capture the Stanley Cup.  Interestingly, all of Calgary's series-winning goals during the playoffs were scored by Gelinas, including two in overtime.

Despite the loss, 30,000 fans packed into [[Olympic Plaza]] to celebrate the Flames run.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Bergman  |title=The Flames nearly brought the Stanley Cup home, and grateful Calgary gave thanks |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0012618 |format=Reprint |publisher=Maclean's Magazine |date=2004-06-21 |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}</ref>  The Flames would not raise their Western Conference championship banner for nearly 15 months, as the [[2004-05 NHL season|2004-05 season]] was wiped out by a [[2004-05 NHL lockout|labour dispute]].

===Post lockout (2006-present)===
[[Image:WeaverLankow.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Calgary]]'s [[Daymond Langkow]] moves in on [[Mike Weaver (hockey)|Mike Weaver]] of the [[Los Angeles Kings]], December 21, 2005]]
The Flames roared through the [[2005-06 NHL season|2005-06 season]], finishing with 103 points &mdash; their best total since the 1989 Cup-winning season &mdash; and their first division title in 12 years. However, they lost to the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in seven games during the first round of the playoffs. Star goaltender [[Miikka Kiprusoff]] captured both the [[Vezina Trophy]] and the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]], while rookie defenceman [[Dion Phaneuf]] set a franchise record for goals by a rookie blueliner with 20.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/news/2006/05/271296.html |title=NHL announces 2005-06 trophy finalists |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2006-05-04 |publisher=nhl.com}}</ref>

The 2006 Off-Season began with the surprising trade for [[Alex Tanguay]], formerly of the [[Colorado Avalanche]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.calgaryflames.com/cgi-bin/news/comments.cgi?type=newsroom&file_num=0000000883 |title=Flames acquire Alex Tanguay |accessdate=2006-11-28 |last=Board |first=Mike |publisher=Calgary Flames}}</ref> and with [[Darryl Sutter]] relinquishing his head coaching position to assistant [[Jim Playfair]] to focus on his duties as General Manager.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=171090&hubname=nhl |title=Sutter steps down as Flames coach |accessdate=2006-11-28 |author=Canadian Press |publisher=tsn.ca}}</ref>. On [[12 December]], [[2006]], the Flames broke a new franchise record for the most consecutive home wins, with 10 straight home wins. The Flames finished the year with 96 points, netting them an 8th-place finish in the tough Western Conference (seven teams finished with 100 or more points). The Flames fell in six games to the top-seeded [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the first round.  The series essentially ended in Game 5, in which the Flames were assessed several penalties for stick-related infractions during a 5-1 loss.  Most notably, backup goalie [[Jamie McLennan]] slashed Red Wings forward [[Johan Franzen]] in the stomach only 18 seconds after relieving Kiprusoff.  McLennan was abruptly ejected from the game, causing Kiprusoff to return to the net, and suspended five games. Playfair and the Flames organization were also heavily fined, in part because the NHL made actions late in games that were out of hand a particular point of emphasis.  <ref>http://www.cbc.ca/cp/hockey/070422/h042208A.html</ref>The Flames were eliminated the next night when the game winning overtime goal was scored, coincidentally, by Johan Franzen. Because the Flames lost, McLennan had to sit out the first four games of the [[2007-08 NHL season|2007-08 season]].

The Flames named [[Mike Keenan]] their head coach on [[June 14]], [[2007]], while former coach Jim Playfair was retained as associate coach.

==Noteworthy Events==
===The "Red Mile"===
{{main|Red Mile}}

During the Flames' run to the Stanley Cup finals of 2004, the city of Calgary essentially became the host of a "non-stop party". The 17th Avenue SW entertainment district, which runs West from the Pengrowth Saddledome, flooded with as many as 80,000 red-clad fans after games. Similar celebrations had occurred during Flames celebrations during the 1980s and primarily took place along 11th Ave SW, then known as "Electric Avenue".

The Red Mile party became world-famous and received worldwide coverage in newspapers. The Red Mile was notable in that incidents were minimal, the crowds were positive, and only one arrest was made after a police officer was injured by a celebrant.

In April 2006, the [[Calgary Police Service]] announced that the Red Mile gatherings of 2004 would not be encouraged, and that measures would be taken to discourage it, including traffic diversions, a zero-tolerance policy on noise and rowdy behaviour, and the presence of plainclothed officers among the crowd to ticket offenders. After meeting with the Chief of Police, Mayor [[Dave Bronconnier]] convinced the Calgary Police Service to relax their ban on the "Red Mile" and encouraged people to make their way to 17th Ave. The police retained their zero tolerance policy on public nudity and drunkenness.

===The "C of Red"===
During the Flames' run to the Stanley Cup finals of 2004, most of the Flames fans attending the hockey games at the Saddledome wore a red jersey with the Flames' famous flaming C on it. Many of those who did not have a red jersey wore a red shirt instead. Thus, the "C" of Red became the nickname for the fans at the Saddledome during the Flames' playoff run, and the trend of an attendance dressed almost entirely in red continued throughout the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. The tradition of the C of Red dates back to the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Oilers. Oiler fans were donning hats promoting "Hat Trick Fever" in their quest for [[three-peat|three straight Stanley Cups]]. Flames fans countered by wearing red. In the 1987 playoffs against the [[Winnipeg Jets]], the Jets responded to the C of Red by encouraging fans to wear white, creating the [[Winnipeg White Out]].

==Team Information==
[[Image:Calgary-flames-07-jerseys.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Current jerseys]]
===Jerseys===
The Calgary Flames like all NHL teams updated their jerseys for the 2007-08 NHL season to new Rbk Edge jerseys. The Flames updated their jersey design, adding [[Alberta]] and [[Canada]] flags as shoulder patches.
===Mascot===
'''[[Harvey the Hound]]''' is the Flames mascot. Created in 1983, to serve both with the Flames and the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[Canadian Football League]], Harvey was the first mascot in the NHL.<ref name="cbcmascots">[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/top10/mascots.html Mascot Madness], cbc.ca, accessed February 24, 2007</ref>  Harvey is most famous for an incident in January 2003, where he had his tongue ripped out by [[Edmonton Oilers]] head coach, [[Craig MacTavish]] as he was harassing the Oilers bench.<ref>Pyette, Ryan, [http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam030123/col_pyette-sun.html MacTavish leaves Harvey the Hound speechless ], [[London Free Press]], January 23, 2003</ref>  The incident made headlines throughout North America, and led to many jokes, including having many other NHL team mascots arrive at the [[53rd National Hockey League All-Star Game|2003 All-Star Game]] with their tongues hanging out.<ref>Francis, Eric, [http://www.slamsports.com/Slam030921/col_francis-sun.html, The uncivil war], [[Calgary Sun]], September 21, 2003</ref>

''Hall of Famers'':Several members of the Flames organization have been honoured by the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] during the team's 27 year history in Calgary.  [[Lanny McDonald]] was the first Flame player inducted, gaining election in 1992.  McDonald recorded 215 goals in 492 games for the Flames, including a team record 66 goals in [[1982-83 NHL season|1982-83]].  He was joined in 2000 by a fellow member of the 1989 [[Stanley Cup]] championship team, [[Joe Mullen]].  Mullen spent five seasons with the Flames, recording 388 points and capturing two [[Lady Byng Trophy|Lady Byng Trophies]].  [[Grant Fuhr]] became the third former Flames player to enter the Hall, having been elected in 2003.  Fuhr played only one season in Calgary, however he recorded his 400th career win in a Flames uniform with a victory over the [[Florida Panthers]] on [[October 22]], [[1999]].<ref name="hhof">Hockey Hall of Fame, ''2006-07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pts. 20-21</ref>

Former head coach "Badger" [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey)|Bob Johnson]] joined McDonald in the class of 1992, gaining election as a builder. Johnson coached five seasons with the Flames from 1982-87, and his 193 wins remains a team record.

During that time, the Flames qualified for the playoffs sixteen consecutive times between 1976 and 1991. Fletcher was inducted in 2004.  [[Harley Hotchkiss]] became the third builder to gain election in 2006.  Hotchkiss is an original member of the ownership group that purchased and brought the Flames to Calgary in 1980. He has served many years as the chairman of the NHL Board of Directors, during which he played a significant role in the resolution of the [[2004-05 NHL lockout|2004-05 lockout]].<ref name="hhof" />
