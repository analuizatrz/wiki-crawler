'''Muawiyah I''' ({{Lang-ar-at|a=معاوية بن أبي سفيان|t=Muˁāwīya ibn ˁAbī Sufyān}}; 602-680) was a [[Sahaba]] (companion) of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]] and later the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] in [[Damascus]]. He engaged in a [[First Fitna|civil war]] against the fourth and final [[Rashidun]] (Rightly Guided [[Caliph]]s), [[Ali]] (Ali ibn Abi Talib) (Muhammad's son-in-law) and met with considerable military success, including the seizure of [[Egypt]]. He assumed the [[caliphate]] after Ali's assassination in 661 and led until 680.

Because of his involvement in the [[Battle of Siffin]] against Ali, whom the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Muslim]]s believe was Muhammad's true successor (see [[Succession to Muhammad]]), the belief that he broke the treaty he made with [[Hasan ibn Ali]] by appointing his son [[Yazid I|Yazid]] as ruler and the belief that he was responsible for the deaths of various companions, Mu'awiyah has been hated and reviled by generations of Shi'a. 

==Early life==
Mu'awiyah ibn Abi-Sufyan was born (602 C.E.) into a powerful clan, the [[Banu Abd-Shams]], of the  [[Quraysh]] tribe. The Quraysh controlled the city of [[Mecca]], in what is now western [[Saudi Arabia]], and the Banu Abd-Shams were among the most influential of its citizens. His father, [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], opposed Muhammad before becoming a Muslim after Muhammad conquered Mecca. 

In 630 CE, Muhammad and his followers conquered Mecca, and most of the Meccans, including the Abd-Shams, formally submitted to Muhammad and accepted [[Islam]]. General consensus among early Islamic historians is that Muawiyah, along with his father Abu Sufyan, became Muslims at the conquest of Mecca when further resistance to Muslims became an impossibility.<ref> The History of al-Tabari, Volume IX, The Last Years of the Prophet, p32, SUNY Press</ref><ref> Life of Muhammad, Ibn Hisham, Volume 2, p597 (Urdu) </ref> According to some historians Muāwiyya accepted Islam at an earlier date in defiance of his relatives.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

Muhammad welcomed his former opponents, enrolled them in his army and gave them important posts in what was to become the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. After Muhammad's death in 632, he served in the Islamic army sent against the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] forces in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]. He held a high rank in the [[Rashidun army]] which was led by his brother [[Yazid ibn Abu Sufyan]].

== Governor of Syria ==
Caliph [[Umar]] (Umar ibn al-Khattab) had appointed Yazid Ibn Abu Sufyan as governor of Syria. In the year 640, Umar appointed Muawiyah as governor of Syria when his brother died in an outbreak of plague. Muawiyah gradually gained mastery over the other areas of Syria, instilling remarkable personal loyalty among his troops and the people of the region. By 647, Muawiyah had built a Syrian army strong enough to repel a Byzantine attack and, in subsequent years, to take the offensive against the Byzantines in campaigns that resulted in the capture of [[Cyprus]] (649) and [[Rhodes]] (654) and a devastating defeat of the Byzantine navy off the coast of [[Lycia]] (655). At the same time, Muawiyah periodically dispatched land expeditions into [[Anatolia]].

According to the chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]], Muawiyah I, after capturing Rhodes sold the remains of the [[Colossus of Rhodes]] to a traveling salesman from [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. The buyer had the statue broken down, and transported the bronze scrap on the backs of 900 camels to his home. Pieces continued to turn up for sale for years, after being found along the caravan route. 

All these campaigns came to a halt with the accession of Ali to the caliphate, when a new and decisive phase of Muawiyah's career began.

== Conflict with Ali ==
Muawiyah fought a protracted campaign against [[Ali]], allegedly seeking justice for the assassinated caliph [[Uthman Ibn Affan]]. [[Aisha]] (Aisha bint Abu Bakr) (Muhammad's widow), [[Talhah]] (Talha ibn Ubayd-Allah) and [[Al-Zubayr]] (Abu ‘Abd Allah Zubayr ibn al-Awwam) were all in agreement with Muawiyah that those who assassinated Uthman should be brought to justice. However, Ali refused to apprehend and punish Uthman's murderers, citing rebel infiltration of the Muslim ranks, resulting in Muawiyah's refusal to acknowledge Ali's caliphate. 

Muawiyah did not participate in the campaign by Aisha, Talhah and Al-Zubayr against Ali that ended in the [[Battle of Bassorah|Battle of the Camel]].<ref> The Early Caliphate, Maulana Muhammad Ali, Al-Jadda Printers, pg. 169-206, 1983 </ref> The city of Basrah went over to them but they were defeated in battle by Ali. Talhah and Al-Zubayr were killed. Ali pardoned Aisha and had her escorted back to [[Medina]]. 

Ali then turned towards Syria, where Mu'awiyah was in open opposition. He marched to the [[Euphrates]] and engaged Mu'awiyah's troops at the famous Battle of Siffin (657). Accounts of the clash vary – however, it would seem that neither side had won a victory, since the Syrians called for arbitration to settle the matter, arguing that continuing civil war would embolden the Byzantines.<ref>pg.22 Mu'awiyah: Restorer of the Muslim Faith, Aisha Bewley, Dar al Taqwa Ltd. 2002.</ref> There are several conflicting accounts of the arbitrations. 

In the meantime, dissension broke out in Ali's camp where some of his former supporters, later known as [[Kharijites]], felt that Ali had betrayed them by entering into negotiations. Ali set out to quell the Kharijites. At about the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt. The governor of Egypt, Qais, was recalled, and Ali had him replaced with [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] (the brother of Aisha and the son of Islam's first caliph [[Abu Bakr]]). Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr's rule resulted in widespread rebellion in Egypt. Mu'awiyah ordered [['Amr ibn al-'As]] to invade Egypt and 'Amr did so successfully. Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was killed. 

When Alī was assassinated in 661, Mu'awiyah, as commander of the largest force in the Muslim Empire, had the strongest claim to the Caliphate. Ali's son Hasan ibn Ali, after an initial defiance of Mu'awiyah, gave up and retired to private life in Medina.

== Rule ==
After giving himself the title [[Amir al-Mu'minin]] (Commander of the Faithful) in the year 661, Mu'awiyah governed the geographically and politically disparate Caliphate, which now spread from Egypt in the west to [[Iran]] in the east, by strengthening the power of his allies in the newly conquered territories. Prominent positions in the emerging governmental structures were held by [[Christian]]s, some of whom belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious tolerance that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, especially in Syria itself. This policy also boosted his popularity and solidified Syria as his power base.
 
Mu'awiyah instituted several Byzantine-style bureaucracies, called ''[[divan]]s'', to aid him in the governance and the centralization of the Caliphate and the empire. Early Arabic sources credit two ''diwan''s in particular to Mu'awiyah: the ''Diwan al-Khatam'' ([[Chancellor|Chancellery]]) and the ''Barid'' (Postal Service), both of which greatly improved communications within the empire.  

To have an insight into Mu’awiyah’s character, we may mention what Ibn Katheer reports in his history book Al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah.
<blockquote>"At the height of tension when fighting was about to erupt at Siffin between Imam Ali and Mu’awiyah, Mu’awiyah was informed that the Byzantine Emperor raised a very large army and was drawing very close to the borders of the Muslim state. He wrote to him, giving him a very clear warning, 'By God, if you do not stop your designs and go back to your place, I will end my dispute with my cousin and will drive you out of the entire land you rule, until I make the earth too tight for you.' The Byzantine Emperor was scared off and abandoned his plans"</blockquote>

Mu'awiyah died May 6, 680. He was succeeded by his son Yazid I. Mu'awiyah had held the expanding empire together by force of his personality, through personal allegiances, in the style of a traditional [[Arab]] [[sheikh]]. However Mu'awiyah's attempt to start a dynasty failed because both Yazid and then his grandson [[Muawiya II]] died prematurely. The caliphate eventually went to [[Marwan I]] a descendant of another branch of Mu'awiya's clan.

== Legacy ==
Mu'awiyah greatly beautified Damascus and developed a court to rival that of [[Constantinople]]. He expanded the frontiers of the empire, reaching the very gates of Constantinople at one point, though failing to hold any territory in Anatolia. [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] credit him with saving the fledgling Muslim nation from post civil war anarchy. 

One of Muawiyah's most controversial and enduring legacies was his decision to designate his son Yazid as his successor, thereby creating a [[dynasty]]. According to Shi'a doctrine, this was a clear violation of the treaty he made with Hasan ibn Ali, in which he said he would not make his son his successor.

==Sunni View==
Many Sunni historians see him as a companion of Muhammad, worthy of respect, and many Sunni revere him as such, taking issue with the Shia vilification of him.<ref>[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/1897.htm  Leader of the Jundallah Movemement, Abd Al-Malek Al-Rigi: We Train Fighters in the Mountains and Send Them into Iran. October 17, 2008 ]</ref>  However, Muawiyah is seen, not as a ''hazret'' (a title of utmost respect; used only for prophets, saints and the ''Rashidun''), but as a king. Sunnis believe that the legacy of Muawiyah was shadowed by his ambition -he fought against the Rightly Guided Caliph of the time, Ali; and he transformed the regime from an elective monarchy into a hereditary one by designating his son Yezid as his successor.

A Sunni hadith says: <blockquote>
"..Muawiyah who was really the best of the two men said to him, "O 'Amr! If these killed those and those killed these, who would be left with me for the jobs of the public, who would be left with me for their women, who would be left with me for their children?" Then Muawiya sent two Quraishi men from the tribe of 'Abd-i-Shams called 'Abdur Rahman bin Sumura and Abdullah bin 'Amir bin Kuraiz to Al-Hasan saying to them, "Go to this man (i.e. Al-Hasan) and negotiate peace with him and talk and appeal to him." So, they went to Al-Hasan and talked and appealed to him to accept peace..."<ref>
Muhammad Muhsin Khan "The Translation of the Meanings of Salih al-Bukhari, volume 3" 1984 ISBN 81-7151-016-7, item 867 </ref> </blockquote>

Sunni scholars interpret Hasan's willingness to abandon his claims in favor of Mu'awiyah as proof that Hasan did not view Muawiyah as an apostate, renegade and hypocrite. Hasan, they say, did so for the sake of peace and ending the civil war.

==Shi'a View==
The Shi'a tend to vilify Mu'awiyah. His supposed conversion to Islam before the conquest of Mecca is dismissed as a fable, or mere hypocrisy. He opposed [[Ali]], the rightful [[Imam]], out of sheer greed for power and wealth. His reign opened the door to unparalleled disaster, marked by the persecution of [[Ali]], slaughtering of his followers,<ref>Tarikh Tabri Volume 18 page 201 ; al Istiab, Volume 1 page 49, Chapter: Busar; al Isaba Volume, 1 page 289, Translation No. 642, Busar bin Irtat; Asadul Ghaba, Volume 1 page 113, Topic: Busar bin Irtat; Tarikh Ibn Asakir, Volume 3 page 225 ; Tarikh Asim Kufi, page 308.</ref> and unlawful imprisonment of his supporters,<ref>al Bidaya wa al Nihaya, Volume 8 page 52 ; Asad'ul Ghaba Volume, 1 page 846, Dhikr Umro bin Hamiq; Tarikh Yaqubi, volume 2 page 200, 50 H; Al Bidayah wal Nihayah, Volume 8 page 52, death of Amro bin al-Hamiq al-Khazai.</ref> which only worsened when Yazid come into power and the [[Battle of Karbala]] ensued. Mu'awiya is alleged to have killed many of Muhammad's companions (Sahaba), either in battle or by poison, due to his lust for power. A few historical figures killed by Mu'awiya include: the [[Sahaba]] Amr bin al-Hamiq,<ref>al Bidaya wa al Nihaya, Volume 8 page 48, Dhikr 50 Hijri; al Istiab, Volume 1 page 363 ; al Isaba, Volume 4 page 623, Translation No. 5822 ; Asadul Ghaba, Volume 1 page 846, Amr bin al-Hamiq al-Khazai; Tabaqat al Kubra, Volume 6 page 25 ; Tarikh Kamil, Volume 3 page 240 Dhikr 51 Hijri; Risala Abu Bakr Khawarzmi, page 122 ; Tarikh ibn Khaldun, Volume 3 page 12 ; al Maarif, page 127 ; History of Tabari, Volume 18 page 137</ref> [[Malik al-Ashtar]],<ref>Tadhirathul Khawwas, page 64 ; Muruj al Dhahab, Volume 3 page 420 ; Tarikh ibn Khaldun, Volume 2 page 191 ; Tarikh Kamil, Volume 3 page 179 ; Tarikh Tabari, English translation Volume 18 pages 144-146 ; Habib al Sayyar, Volume 1 page 72 ; Tabaqat al Kubra, Volume 6 page 213</ref> [[Hujr ibn Adi]]<ref>al Bidaya wa al Nihaya, Volume 8 page 53 Dhikr 51 Hijri; Tarikh Kamil, Volume 3 page 249 Dhikr 51 Hijri; Tarikh ibn Asakir, Volume 12 page 227 Dhikr Hujr ibn Adi; Tarikh ibn Khaldun, Volume 3 page 13 Dhikr 51 Hijri; al Isaba, Volume 1 page 313 Dhikr Hujr ibn Adi; Asad'ul Ghaba, Volume 1 page 244 Dhikr Hujr ibn Adi; Shadharat ul Dhahab, Volume 1 page 57 Dhikr 51 Hijri; Tabaqat al Kubra, Volume 6 page 217 Dhikr Hujr ibn Adi; Mustadrak al Hakim, Volume 3 page 468-470 Dhikr Hujr ibn Adi; Akhbar al Tawaal, page 186 Dhikr Hujr ibn Adi; Tarikh Abu'l Fida, page 166 Dhikr 51 Hijri; Muruj al Dhahab, Volume 3 page 12 Dhikr 53 Hijri; Tarikh Yaqubi, Volume 2 page 219</ref> (to which the families of [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]] condemned Mu'awiyah for,<ref>al-Bidaya wa al-Nihaya, Volume 8 page 55 ; Kanz al Ummal, Volume 3 page 88 ; Tarikh al Islam by Dhahabi Volume 2 page 217 ; Tarikh ibn Khaldun, Volume 3 page 12 ; al Isaba, page 355 Dhikr Hujr; al-Istiab, Volume 1 page 97.</ref> and the [[Sahaba]] deemed his killer to be cursed<ref>Qadhi Abi Bakar al-Arabi.
