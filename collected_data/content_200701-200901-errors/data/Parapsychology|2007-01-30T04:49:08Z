'''Parapsychology''' is the study of certain types of [[paranormal phenomena]].
The term is based on the Greek [[para]] (beside/beyond), [[psyche]] (soul/mind), and  [[logos]] (account/explanation) and was coined by psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] in or before 1889. Its first appearance was in an article by Dessoir in the June 1889 issue of the German publication ''Sphinx''.<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref> [[J. B. Rhine]] later popularized "parapsychology" as a replacement for the earlier term "psychical research", during a shift in methodologies which brought experimental methods to the study of psychic phenomena.<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref>

In contemporary parapsychology, the term refers to the study of [[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]], indicating psychic phenomena.<ref>http://www.medicalglossary.org/psychological_phenomena_and_processes_parapsychology_definitions.html Medical Glossary.org</ref><ref>http://www.mdani.demon.co.uk/para/paraglos.htm#P Psychic Science.com</ref><ref>http://www.parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#p The Parapsychological Association, Inc. (PA) is the international professional organization of scientists and scholars engaged in the study of ‘psi’</ref>

The scientific reality of parapsychological phenomena and the validity of scientific parapsychological research is a matter of frequent dispute and criticism. It is regarded by some critics as a [[pseudoscience]], but proponents claim that parapsychology [[research]] results are [[science|scientifically]] rigorous. Despite criticisms, a number of academic institutions now conduct research on the topic, employing laboratory methodologies and statistical techniques, such as [[meta-analysis]]. The [[Parapsychological Association]] has been a member of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] since 1969.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>. Nevertheless, in over one hundred years of research there has not been a single reproducible study demonstrating paranormal effects. 

==Scope of parapsychological study==

According to the [[Parapsychological Association]], parapsychology is limited in its scope to the study of three main classes of paranormal phenomena.<ref>Parapsychological Association. [http://parapsych.org/mission_statement.html "What is the PA? Mission Statement"]</ref> These classes include:

* Mental phenomena: often described as [[extrasensory perception]], this class includes unusual mental states or abilities, such as [[telepathy]], [[clairvoyance]], [[precognition]], [[retrocognition]], [[remote viewing]], [[psychometry]], [[xenoglossy]], [[medium (spirituality)|mediumism]], [[channeling (mediumistic)|channeling]], [[clairaudience]], [[clairsentience]], and [[possession]]. This class involves some type of information transfer occurring outside the confines of one's [[five senses]].<ref>http://www.parapsych.org/faq_file1.html#6</ref><ref name=PA_GLOSSARY>http://www.parapsych.org/glossary_a_d.html</ref><ref>http://www.sheldrake.org/papers/Staring/JCSpaper1.pdf ''The Sense of Being Stared At And Other Unexplained Powers of the Human Mind'' ''Part 1: Is it Real or Illusory?''

* Physical phenomena: this class includes unusual physical occurrences, such as [[psychokinesis]] (often referred to as telekinesis), [[poltergeist]]s, [[stigmata]], [[paranormal vanishing]], [[reality shifts]], [[materialization (parapsychology)|materializations]], [[psychic]] healing, [[faith healing]], [[morphic field]]s<ref>''The Presence of the Past'':
''Morphic Resonance & the Habits of Nature'' By Rupert Sheldrake</ref>, and [[synchronicity]]. These types of phenomena often involve the mind influencing its physical surroundings.<ref name=PA_GLOSSARY/><ref>http://www.parapsych.org/faq_file1.html#6</ref><ref>http://www.parapsych.org/faq_file1.html#10</ref>

* Survival phenomena: this class deals with the survival of consciousness after physical death and includes [[ghost]]s, [[out-of-body experience]]s (OBEs) (also known as [[astral projection]]s), [[reincarnation]] and [[near-death experience]]s (NDEs)

Other reported phenomena which are thought to be paranormal, but which are outside these classifications, are often considered outside the current scope of parapsychology.

== History==
{{main|History of parapsychology}}

Although parapsychology has its roots in earlier research, it began using the experimental approach in the 1930s under the direction of [[J. B. Rhine]] (1895 – 1980).<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref> Rhine popularized the now famous methodology of using card-guessing and dice-rolling experiments in a laboratory in an attempt to find a statistical validation of [[extra-sensory perception]].<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref>

In 1957, the [[Parapsychological Association]] was formed as the preeminent society for [[parapsychologists]]. In 1969, they became affiliated with the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. That affiliation, along with a general openness to psychic and occult phenomena in the 1970s, led to a decade of increased parapsychological research.<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref> During this time, other notable organizations were also formed, including the Academy of Parapsychology and Medicine (1970), the Institute of Parascience (1971), the Academy of Religion and Psychical Research, the Institute for Noetic Sciences (1973), and the International Kirlian Research Association (1975). Each of these groups performed experiments on paranormal subjects to varying degrees. Parapsychological work was also conducted at the [[Stanford Research Institute]] during this time.<ref name="EncyOccult">Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology edited by J. Gordon Melton Gale Research, ISBN 0-8103-5487-X</ref>

== Experimental results ==
{{main|Research results in parapsychology}}

It is accepted in the field that at least a small amount of data from properly controlled experiments can be trusted for a small number of psi phenomena.<ref name="Edinburgh">http://moebius.psy.ed.ac.uk/FAQ.php3#Nonsense ''It's All Nonsense, Isn't It?'' From the website of the Koestler Parapsychology Unit part of the Psychology Department (School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences) at the University of Edinburgh, Retrieved December 31, 2006</ref> Some parapsychologists hold that this evidence is not definitive, but suggestive enough to warrant further research. Others believe that a great deal of evidence has been collected, which, if it addressed more conventional phenomena, would be sufficient to provide proof.<ref name="Edinburgh"/>  

Some experiments have tested the ability to use [[ESP]] to get above-average scores when guessing targets such as cards, pictures, or videos. There have also been many [[psychokinesis]] experiments testing the ability to influence [[random number generator|random number generators]], and many [[telepathy]] experiments, for instance those using the [[ganzfeld]] procedure. Many of these experiments have had positive results, with subjects scoring significantly above chance. This significance, when analyzed using statistics, has often been very high.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>(Radin 1997:84)  Some studies have returned results which are not significantly above chance, which is usually defined as a 95% confidence interval.<ref>http://www.surveysystem.com/signif.htm ''Statistical Significance'' Definition of statistical significance from Creative Research Systems, Retrieved January 1, 2007</ref><ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>(Radin 1997:78-84)  However, when results of positive, negative, and inconclusive studies are combined in [[meta-analyses]], they tend to return highly significant results in favor of the existence of psi (or some unknown factor). Although [[statistics|statistical]] significance is high, the results do not seem impressive to many, because the effect size is often only a few percentage points above chance. For instance, where in a four choice task chance = 25%, a psychic may score between 33% and 37%.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>(Radin 1997:83-88)

Controlled parapsychological laberatory research, often useing meta-analyses of many experiments performed by different researchers, have returned results such as the following:

* [[Clairvoyance]] and telepathy experiments: several categories of experiments ranging from [[ESP]] card tests, to dream and ganzfeld telepathy studies, to [[remote viewing]] and [[Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab|PEAR]] precognitive remote perception studies, all normalized for chance hit rate of 50%, the categories range from about 54% to 67% hit rate, averaging about 60%.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>

* Dice tossing: 51.2% hit rate (vs. chance = 50%) over 148 experiments from 1935 to 1987, involving thousands of participants and millions of tosses.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>

* [[Random number generator|Random Number Generator]] (RNG) studies: 51% hit rate (vs. chance = 50%) over 832 studies from 1959 to 1987 (1989 analysis).<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>

* The on-going [[Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab|PEAR]] program, started at Princeton University in 1979, analyzed millions of random bits. They found a small deviation from the 50% chance expectation, of the order of 0.01%. While this effect is tiny, it is [[statistically significant]]: with 7 standard deviations, the probability that the origin of the effect is a statistical oddity (odds against chance) is around 10<sup>-12</sup>.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>

* Distant mental influence on human electrodermal activity: 53% (vs. chance = 50%), over 400 sessions as of 1997.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>

* Feeling of being stared at: 63% (vs. chance = 50%) over studies from 1913 to 1996.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>

* Some experiments have tested the ability to foretell future events, both consciously, and unconsciously by using electrodes to measure [[galvanic skin response]]s to future stimuli, and have obtained positive results.<ref>http://www.boundaryinstitute.org/articles/tri2.pdf ''Evidence for a retrocausal effect in the human nervous system'' Dean Radin & Edwin May Boundary Institute, Retrieved Dec 15, 2006</ref><ref>http://www.boundaryinstitute.org/articles/presentiment99.pdf ''Evidence for an anomalous anticipatory effect in the autonomic nervous system'' By Dean I. Radin, Boundary Institute, Retrieved Dec 15, 2006
</ref><ref>http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/timereversed.pdf ''Time-reversed human experience: Experimental evidence and implications'' By Dean Radin, Boundary Institute, Los Altos, California, Retrieved Dec 15, 2006</ref>. These precognitive effects are unrelated to current research in mainstream neuropsychology which indicates that conscious choice is not necessary to initiate behavior.<ref>Bechara, A. Damasio, H., Tranel, D., & Damasio A.R. (1997) Deciding advantageously before knowing the advantageous strategy, ''Science, 275,'' 1293-1295</ref>  

The odds against chance of many of these statistical outcomes are extremely high, often ranging from one in thousands to one in trillions.  This is so even when common statistical tools are used to rule out "file drawer" cases which might occur when non-significant results are not reported. Therefore, the results of parapsychology studies cannot reasonably be explained by chance alone.

Other experiments aimed at detecting psi, especially those performed by experimenters or subjects who disbelieve in psi, have scored significantly below chance.  This is called [[psi-missing]], and is considered further evidence for the existence of psi, since any deviation from chance may be evidential.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>(Radin 1997:108-109)  

Despite the positive results of psi experiments, parapsychology remains highly controversial, partially due to the lack of a theory which explains its results.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/><ref name="EntangledMinds">Entangled Minds by Dean Radin, Simon & Schuster, Paraview Pocket Books , 2006</ref>

==Fraud==  	 
{{main|Fraud in parapsychology}}

Some critics say that the positive results of [[parapsychological]] experiments are probably due to fraud, though they may sometimes be due to design flaws. This is partly because fraud is a simpler explanation of the phenomena of [[psi]] than the hypothesis that psi is real.

==Skeptical view==
{{main|The skeptical view of parapsychology}}

Some critics say that the positive results of [[parapsychological]] experiments are probably due to errors such as design flaws, experimenter effects, and sometimes fraud, etc. This is partly because error is a simpler explanation of the phenomena of [[psi]] than the hypothesis that psi is real. Critics also say that a review of the history of parapsychology reveals that parapsychologists prefer to remain popular rather than reveal malfeasance within their field.
It is generally believed that in social psychology people try to maintain their social standing.<ref>''Betrayers of the Truth'' by William J. Broad, Oxford University Press, 1985 </ref> <ref> ''The Psychology of Conviction: A Study of Beliefs and Attitudes'' by [[Joseph Jastrow]], Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918 </ref> <ref> ''Social Psychology'' by Elliot Aaronson, Timothy D.

==Status of the field==

Many professional scientists study parapsychology.  It is an interdisciplinary field, attracting [[psychology|psychologists]], [[physics|physicists]], [[engineer]]s, and [[biology|biologists]], as well as those from other sciences.  One organization involved in the field, the [[Parapsychological Association]] is an affiliate of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS). [http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/affiliates/#P]. At present (2006) there are about two hundred and seventy five members in the Parapsychological Association.

Parapsychology is a frequently deprecated subject in science and the academy. Individuals who show an interest in studying psychic phenomena, even from a skeptical point of view, often have difficulty  finding or keeping sustained employment. They may be denied funding or the chance to publish, but it is difficult to be sure of the cause, as so many funding proposals are denied anyway. Parapsychologists frequently believe, however, that they have been the objects of discrimination due to their field of study.<ref>DISCIPLINING HETERODOXY, CIRCUMVENTING DISCIPLINE: PARAPSYCHOLOGY, ANTHROPOLOGICALLY By David J. Hess In David Hess and Linda Layne (eds.), Knowledge and Society Vol. 9: The Anthropology of Science and Technology. Greenwich, Ct.: JAI Press. Pp. 191-222. Electronic version available at  http://www.davidjhess.org/DiscHet.pdf</ref>

For example, Cambridge physicist Brian Josephson who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1973 told [http://observer.guardian.co.uk ''The Observer''] "'Yes, I think telepathy exists,' [...] 'and I think quantum physics will help us understand its basic properties.' [...] 'I think journals like Nature and Science are censoring such research,' he said. 'There is a lot of evidence to support the existence of telepathy, for example, but papers on the subject are being rejected - quite unfairly.'"<ref>http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,560604,00.html ''Royal Mail's Nobel guru in telepathy row'' by Robin McKie, science editor of ''The Observer'' Sunday September 30, 2001, Retrieved December 17, 2006</ref>

As a general rule, while trained scientists may not be as likely to believe in parapsychological phenomena as the general public, they are far from monolithic in their disbelief.  Surveys of this group are rare, but in their 1994 paper in the Psychological Bulletin entitled [http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/psy1.html ''Does psi exist? Replicable evidence for an anomalous process of information transfer''] Daryl J. Bem and Charles Honorton quote a 1979 survey:

<blockquote>A survey of more than 1,100 college professors in the United States found that 55% of natural scientists, 66% of social scientists (excluding psychologists), and 77% of academics in the arts, humanities, and education believed that ESP is either an established fact or a likely possibility. The comparable figure for psychologists was only 34%. Moreover, an equal number of psychologists declared ESP to be an impossibility, a view expressed by only 2% of all other respondents (Wagner; Monnet, 1979).<ref>http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/psy1.html 1979 survey quoted in ''Does Psi Exist? Replicable Evidence for an Anomalous Process of Information Transfer'' By Daryl J. Bem and Charles Honorton in the Psychological Bulletin 1994, Vol. 115, No. 1, 4-18</ref>
</blockquote>

A number of [[Nobel Laureate]]s have been of the belief that the field of parapsychology is worthy of funding and study.  Among these are  [[Brian Josephson]], [[Kary Mullis]],<ref>National Public Radio Scienc Friday, May 1999.  See http://lkm.fri.uni-lj.si/xaigor/slo/znanclanki/Wildey2.pdf</ref> and [[Wolfgang Pauli]].<ref>Lindorff, D. (2004). Pauli and Jung: The Meeting of Two Great Minds. Wheaton, IL: Quest Books.</ref> Many eminent scientists from a variety of fields also support parapsychology research, such as [[Hans Eysenck]],<ref>Eysenck, H. J. (1998). Intelligence: A new look.  New Jersey: Transaction Publishers.</ref> [[Robert G Jahn]],<ref>Dunne, J. B. and Jahn, R. G. (2003).

(2003). The sense of being stared at: And other unexplained powers of the human mind.  New York: Random House.</ref>  Despite such support, other eminent scientists have expressed their disapproval of parapsychology.  For instance, physicist John Archibald Wheeler wrote to the AAAS requesting that the affiliate status of the Parapsychology Association be reconsidered<ref>J. A. Wheeler, 'A Decade of Permissiveness', cited in Martin Gardner, ''Science Good, Bad and Bogus'', Prometheus Books, 1981, p193-194</ref>
 
=====State of the controversy=====
Proponents of parapsychology claim that their subject is not controversial because it lacks valid scientific results, but rather because parapsychology touches on areas of profound human ignorance such as in [[physics]] and in the nature of [[consciousness]], and also areas of deep meaning such as [[religion]], [[superstition]], and [[tradition|traditional beliefs]].<ref>http://www.parapsych.org/faq_file3.html FAQ of the 
Parapsychological Association, Why is parapsychology so controversial?</ref>

Skeptics and parapsychologists have both noted that parapsychology could be a [[protoscience]], one ahead of its time. However, science historian [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] has stated that scientific revolution resulting in a '[[paradigm]] shift' in our knowledge occurs usually when pressure comes from within orthodox science itself because acknowledged anomalies generate pressure for their reduction or removal<ref>T.S. Kuhn, The structure of scientific revolutions, University of Chicago Press, 1962</ref>. About this, physicist M. A. Rothman has written:

{{quotation|"The major difficulty with the notion that parapsychology is going to produce a paradigm revolution in physics is the fact that most physicists are ''not'' unhappy with basic laws." <ref>M. A. Rothman, The new perpetual motion, ''The Humanist'', XXXVIII(4), p.42-45</ref>}}
 
Parapsychologists claim that their findings to date are significant and are generating pressure for change, but they argue that the real importance of this pressure is not being acknowledged within mainstream science because of scientific dogmatism.

Some skeptics have accused scientists involved in parapsychology of being [[fraud]]s and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientists]] who [[bias]] their results to fulfill their emotional needs.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>

{{quotation|There are at least half a dozen peer-reviewed journals of parapsychology. However, research in this area has been characterized by deception, fraud, and incompetence in setting up properly controlled experiments and evaluating statistical data (Alcock 1990; Gardner 1981; Gordon 1987; Hansel 1989; Hines 1990; Hyman 1989; Park 2000; Randi 1982)."<ref>http://skepdic.com/parapsy.html Skeptics Dictionary on Parapsychology</ref>}}

Proponents of parapsychology have responded that the skeptics are promoting "[[scientism]]"<ref>http://www.enlightenment.com/media/interviews/tartall/tart.html#Anchorpsi An Enlightenment Interview with Professor Charles T. Tart</ref> rather than real science by acting as if results which contradict established knowledge cannot be real.  Even [[Marcello Truzzi]], a founder of the Society for Scientific Exploration,<ref>http://www.scientificexploration.org/founding-members.html</ref> director for the Center for Scientific Anomalies Research and founding co-chairman of the skeptical organization [[Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] (now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry<ref>http://www.csicop.org/about/csi.html</ref>), said that

{{quotation|A characteristic of many scoffers is their pejorative characterization of proponents as "promoters" and sometimes even the most protoscientific anomaly claimants are labelled as "pseudoscientists" or practitioners of "pathological science." In their most extreme form., scoffers represent a form of quasi-religious Scientism that treats minority or deviant viewpoints in science as heresies ([[Marcello Truzzi|Truzzi]], 1996).<ref>http://skepticalinvestigations.org/anomalistics/perspective.htm Anomalistics ''The Perspective of Anomalistics''  By [[Marcello Truzzi]]</ref>}}

Truzzi also stated that

{{quotation|Over the years, I have decried the misuse of the term "skeptic" when used to refer to all critics of anomaly claims.[...]Since "skepticism" properly refers to doubt rather than denial--nonbelief rather than [dis]belief--critics who take the negative rather than an agnostic position but still call themselves "skeptics" are actually pseudo-skeptics and have, I believed, gained a false advantage by usurping that label.  In science, the burden of proof falls upon the claimant; and the more extraordinary a claim, the heavier is the burden of proof demanded. The true skeptic takes an agnostic position, one that says the claim is not proved rather than disproved.[...]Critics who assert negative claims, but who mistakenly call themselves "skeptics," often act as though they have no burden of proof placed on them at all, though such a stance would be appropriate only for the agnostic or true skeptic.[...]Thus, if a subject in a psi experiment can be shown to have had an opportunity to cheat, many critics seem to assume not merely that he probably did cheat, but that he must have, regardless of what may be the complete absence of evidence that he did so cheat and sometimes even ignoring evidence of the subject's past reputation for honesty. Similarly, improper randomization procedures are sometimes assumed to be the cause of a subject's high psi scores even though all that has been established is the possibility of such an artifact having been the real cause.[...]Evidence in science is always a matter of degree and is seldom if ever absolutely conclusive.<ref>''On Pseudo-Skepticism A Commentary by Marcello Truzzi'' by Marcello Truzzi in the ''Zetetic Scholar'', #12-13, 1987</ref><ref>http://www.anomalist.com/commentaries/pseudo.html ''On Pseudo-Skepticism A Commentary by Marcello Truzzi'' Read the article here</ref>(''On Pseudo-Skepticism'' by Marcello Truzzi)}}

Skeptics have responded to criticism by saying, in the words of [[Carl Sagan]], that "…extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence".<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/ok/TheDeepSkies/SaganQuotes.html Carl Sagan Quotes</ref> Parapsychologists riposte that they have attained levels of proof which are more than sufficient to prove their results in any other field of science.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>

Another factor which makes parapsychology highly controversial is that there is no theory which can account for parapsychological results.<ref>http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/1996/subtle.html  ''Subtle Connections: Psi, Grof, Jung, and the Quantum Vacuum''   By [[Ervin Laszlo]]</ref><ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>  [[Psi (parapsychology)|Psi]] seems to be able to establish informational links both to the past and the future.  Its effects do not seem to drop off according to the [[inverse square law]], as with other physical forces.  And information gathered using psi does not seem to require [[energy]] to facilitate its transfer.  Also, there may not be any limit on the complexity of information gained by psi.<ref>http://jeksite.org/psi/jp01.pdf J. E. Kennedy in ''The Journal of Parapsychology'', Vol. 65, September 2001 (pp. 219-246)</ref>

Parapsychology is also disturbing to those who believe that to admit that psi exists would encourage religion, [[superstition]], and psychic frauds, as all these are based either on manifestations of psi, or on reports which are hard to distinguish from it.  Skeptics wonder if this would undermine the foundations of science and reason.<ref name="para3"/>

There have been a huge number of parapsychological experiments performed under controlled laboratory conditions. According to [[Dean Radin]] Ph.D, Senior Scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences,<ref>http://www.noetic.org/research/faculty.cfm The institute's research and education faculty, Retrieved January 5, 2007</ref> in Petaluma, California, and former President of the [[Parapsychological Association]]<ref>http://parapsych.org/history_of_pa_presidents.html History of the PA Presidency Retrieved January 5, 2007</ref>,

{{quotation|In 1993, the parapsychologist Charles Honorton, from the University of Edinburgh, considered what skeptics of psi experiments used to claim, and what they no longer claimed. He demonstrated that virtually all the skeptical arguments used to explain away psi over the years had been resolved through new experimental designs. This does not mean the experiments conducted today are “perfect,” because there is nothing perfect in the empirical sciences. But it does mean that the methods available today satisfy the most rigorous skeptical requirements for providing “exceptional evidence.” As we’ve seen, such experiments have been conducted, with successful results.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>(Radin 1997:208-209)}}

Many of these experiments have been done with the aid of skeptics of parapsychology, and also with the aid of professional [[Magic|conjurors]], in order to eliminate as much as possible all controversies concerning the [[Scientific method|analysis]] of the data gathered, and to prevent fraud on the part of the subjects. Dean Radin quotes parapsychologist George Hansen as saying that 	 

{{quotation|Although the public tends to view magicians as debunkers, the opposite is more the case. Birdsell (1989) polled a group of magicians and found that 82 percent gave a positive response to a question of belief in ESP. Truzzi (1983) noted a poll of German magicians that found that 72.3 percent thought psi was probably real. Many prominent magicians have expressed a belief in psychic phenomena. …. It is simply a myth that magicians have been predominantly skeptical about the existence of psi.<ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>(Radin 1997:207)}}

Concerning a series of computer-controlled [[ganzfeld]] experiments done by the parapsychologist Charles Honorton in the 1980s, magician Ford Kross, an officer of the Psychic Entertainers Association wrote that

{{quotation|In my professional capicity as a mentalist, I have reviewed Psychophysical Research Laboratories' automated ganzfeld system and found it to provide excellent security against deception by subjects.<ref>http://www.metapsychique.org/Does-Psi-Exist-Replicable-Evidence.html Bem, D.J., and C. Honorton. 1994.  ''Does psi exist?  Replicable evidence for an anomalous process of information transfer.'' Psychological Bulletin 115:4-18</ref><ref name="ConsciousUniverse"/>(Radin 1997:86)}}

Another major reason that psi has remained controversial is that parapsychologists have sometimes been fooled by hoaxes. Some parapsychological studies have been badly designed, in such a way as to permit fraud.  In the case of [[Project Alpha]], magician James Randi planted magicians as subjects of a parapsychological experiment, and they were able to fool the researchers over a prolonged period. Such methodological failures have been cited by skeptics as evidence of the probability that most if not all parapsychological results derive from error or fraud.<ref>http://www.banachek.org/nonflash/project_alpha.htm Project Alpha, The Skeptical Inquirer Summer 1983 ''The Project Alpha Experiment: Part one. The First Two Years'' by James Randi</ref>

Andrew Greeley, a Catholic priest and a sociologist from the [[University of Arizona]], studied surveys on belief in ESP from 1978 through 1987, and he also studied the mental health of believers in ESP.  The surveys he studied showed that from 1978 through 1987, the number of American adults who reported psychic experiences rose from 58% to 67% (clairvoyance and contacts with the dead were reported by 25% of his respondents).  According to Greeley, the elderly, women, widows and widowers, and the conventionally religious report a higher incidence of such experiences. He also tested the psychological well-being of people reporting mystical experiences with the "Affect Balance Scale" and found that people reporting mystical experiences received top scores.  Greeley summarized his findings by writing:

{{quotation|People who've tasted the paranormal, whether they accept it intellectually or not, are anything but religious nuts or psychiatric cases. They are, for the most part, ordinary Americans, somewhat above the norm in education and intelligence and somewhat less than average in religious involvement.<ref>http://www.skepticalinvestigations.org/guide/field_guide.htm</ref>}}

A few parapsychologists are [[scientific skepticism|skeptics]], for example [[Chris French]] and his colleagues at the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at [[Goldsmiths College|Goldsmiths College in London]], and [[Richard Wiseman]] and his colleagues at the Perrott-Warrick Research Unit in the [[Psychology]] Department of the [[University of Hertfordshire]], both of which units include individuals who are members of the Parapsychological Association. These researchers do not approach the field with a belief in the paranormal, but are rather interested in the purely psychological aspects of those who report paranormal experiences, along with the study of the psychology of deception, hallucination, etc. These researchers also have provided their own guidelines and input to other parapsychologists for the design of experiments and how to properly test those who claim psychic abilities. While some of these guidelines have been useful, many have suffered from a naive understanding of scientific practice in general and in parapsychology in particular, from a distorted view of the methodology actually in use in the field, and the unfortunate habit of some skeptics of making sweeping statements about the applicability of counter-hypotheses to lines of research without actually investigating the appropriateness of those counter-hypotheses to the details at hand. (See, for example a mostly-positive review of one of these guidelines written by skeptics[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_3_63/ai_60054226].)

==Criticism and response==
{{main|Criticism and response in parapsychology}}

Skeptics of parapsychology hold that the entire body of evidence to date is of poor quality and not properly controlled; in their view, the entire field of parapsychology has produced no results whatsoever. They cite instances of fraud, flawed or potentially flawed studies, and the psychological need for mysticism as ways to explain parapsychological results.

Proponents of parapsychology argue that those who hold these views have not had sufficient contact with the published literature of the field such as that which can be found in the [[Journal of Parapsychology]], the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research, the [[Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research]], or in the proceedings of the annual convention of the [[Parapsychological Association]].
