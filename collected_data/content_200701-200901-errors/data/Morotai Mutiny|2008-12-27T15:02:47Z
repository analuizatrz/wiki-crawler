The "'''Morotai Mutiny'''" was an incident in April 1945 involving members of the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] based on the island of [[Morotai]], in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Eight senior pilots, including Australia's leading [[flying ace]], [[Group Captain]] [[Clive Caldwell]], tendered their resignations to protest what they perceived as the relegation of [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] squadrons to strategically unimportant [[close air support|ground attack]] missions. 

A government investigation vindicated the "mutineers", and three high-ranking officers at First Tactical Air Force Headquarters, including the [[Air Officer Commanding]], were relieved of their posts. [[George Odgers]] summed up the cause of the incident in [[Australia in the War of 1939–1945|the official history]] of the RAAF in [[World War II]] as "the conviction of a group of young leaders that they were engaging in operations that were not militarily justifiable – a conviction widely shared also by many Australian soldiers and political leaders."  Odgers concluded that the ensuing inquiry "made it clear that almost everyone concerned acted from the highest motives, and was convinced that, in the crisis, he acted wisely".<ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 450.]</ref>

==Background==
[[Australian First Tactical Air Force|First Tactical Air Force]] (1TAF), commanded by [[Air Commodore]] [[Arthur Henry Cobby|Harry Cobby]], was the main frontline unit of the RAAF in 1944–45. It fell under the operational control of [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George C. Kenney]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air forces commander in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]] under [[General of the Army|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]. Initially made up of one [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]] and two [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] wings, 1TAF was augmented in 1945 by No. 80 Wing, commanded by Group Captain Caldwell. This wing comprised three [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] squadrons, whose pilots included veterans of the [[North African campaign]] and the [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|defence of Northern Australia against Japanese air raids]].<ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/17.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 297–99.]</ref><ref name="Cleaning the Augean stables">Alexander, "Cleaning the Augean stables".</ref>

[[Image:AWM008314Arthur.jpg|thumb|right|Group Captain Arthur (in 1941 here) commissioned a "balance sheet" of 1TAF losses vs. results.]]
By early 1945, Japanese air power in the South West Pacific had been virtually destroyed. [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] forces were focused on completing the [[Philippines campaign (1944–45)|recapture of the Philippines]] as a stepping stone to an invasion of Japan. During this time, 1TAF was increasingly assigned to garrison duties and harassing Japanese bases on islands bypassed by MacArthur's forces.<ref name="Stephens">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 123–24.</ref> The [[Chief of Air Force|Chief of the Air Staff]], [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], would later contend that the RAAF, in the words of Air Force historian Alan Stephens, "was 'side-stepped' out of the final victory over Japan by MacArthur, who wanted all the glory for himself".<ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 109.</ref>  [[United States Marine Corps]] aviators from the [[AirSols|Air North Solomons]] command also believed that MacArthur's headquarters was favouring the USAAF in the assignment of combat duties.<ref>Garand & Strobridge, ''History of U.S. Marine Corps'', p. 389.</ref>

The overall situation led to dissatisfaction and poor morale among 1TAF personnel based on [[Morotai]], particularly the Spitfire pilots who had little opportunity for the air-to-air combat they specialised in and whose aircraft were ill-suited to ground attack missions.<ref name="Helson">Helson, ''"Ten Years at the Top"'', pp. 207–15.</ref> Group Captain [[Wilfred Arthur]], former [[Officer Commanding]] [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No. 81 Wing]] and now in charge of [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No. 78 Wing]], became concerned that his units' expenditure in terms of men, machines and ordnance was not justified by the damage inflicted on enemy targets or by the relative importance of those targets. In December 1944 he asked his Intelligence staff to produce a "balance sheet" to quantify losses versus results. Arthur presented the balance sheet to Air Commodore Cobby, who reviewed it and disseminated it to his headquarters staff, but took no further action.<ref name="Alexander">Alexander, ''Clive Caldwell'', pp. 185–203.</ref><ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/23.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 386–90.]</ref><ref name="Air War Against Japan">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 443–50.]</ref>

==Prelude to the resignations==
In March 1945, frustrated by the lack of response from Cobby and his staff and convinced that operations were becoming yet more wasteful, Arthur began discussing his concerns with other senior 1TAF pilots. First, he spoke to [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Kenneth Ranger, a senior staff officer who had served with [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF]] and had made allegations regarding the leadership of its commander, Air Commodore Joe Hewitt, who was eventually dismissed from his post. Arthur sought out Ranger as someone  with "moral guts", who would take "a stand against the type of operations we were engaged in".<ref name="Cleaning the Augean stables"/>  Next, he enlisted Caldwell's support, although Caldwell was, at the time, facing charges from Cobby over liquor trafficking which made it a risk that his involvement in a protest over operations would be misconstrued as an attempt to divert attention from the charges. Arthur believed, however, that Caldwell "would go as far as he possibly could to back up his opinions [which] were worth a lot more than the opinions of most other people in the area".<ref name="Cleaning the Augean stables"/> 

[[Image:Caldwell spitfire pilots.jpg|thumb|left|Group Captain Caldwell (fourth from left) talking to [[No. 452 Squadron RAAF|No. 452 Squadron]] Spitfire pilots at Morotai in January 1945]]
Through Caldwell more officers joined the protest, including two other celebrated aces, Wing Commander [[Bobby Gibbes]] and [[Squadron Leader]] John Waddy, as well as Squadron Leader Bert Grace, Squadron Leader Douglas Vanderfield, and later, Squadron Leader Stuart Harpham.<ref>Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 125. Caldwell's official tally for the war was 28½ kills, Waddy's 15½, Gibbes' 10¼, and Arthur's 10.</ref> During a series of meetings early in April 1945, Caldwell proposed that the eight resign ''en masse'', and the others agreed.<ref name="Air War Against Japan"/> Arthur later stated that, "I meant to make as big a fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected ... All the same, we realised that, to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny, we might lessen the force of what we were doing, which was the reason we put the things in as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up."<ref name="Cleaning the Augean stables"/>

Arthur also attempted to secure Cobby's support for the protest. The commander of 1TAF had been the [[Australian Flying Corps]]' leading ace in [[World War I]], as Caldwell was the RAAF's in [[World War II]].<ref name="Stephens"/> Arthur reasoned that, although Cobby was partly to blame for the morale issue, "we felt that his value to our move, because of his name with the Public, together with Group Captain Caldwell, would give us a very considerable amount of public support ... he was the prima donna of one war, and ... arm-in-arm with the prima donna of the next war, we would put up a reasonable front and attract a lot of attention in the headlines of the newspapers." Cobby, however, refused to join in and later claimed to be unaware of the depth of feeling among the pilots.<ref name="Cleaning the Augean stables"/>

}}
On 20 April 1945, the eight pilots presented Cobby with identically-worded letters under the heading, "APPLICATION FOR RESIGNATION OF COMMISSION."  The letters read, "I hereby respectfully make application that I be permitted to resign my Commission as an officer in the Royal Australian Air Force, forthwith." Cobby appeared taken aback and would not accept the resignations. He spoke to seven of the pilots individually, but not Caldwell, as he was already under charge.<ref>Alexander, "Cleaning the Augean stables". Bostock and Jones also left Caldwell out of their subsequent interviews with the pilots on Morotai.</ref> When the men refused to withdraw the letters or elaborate on their reasons, Cobby contacted his immediate superior, [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[William Bostock]], head of RAAF Command, the air force's main operational formation. Bostock arrived on Morotai the next day and interviewed the pilots, asking them to tear up the letters, without success.<ref name="Helson"/> His methods were construed as an attempt to "make the situation go away or to at least cover it up".<ref name="Cleaning the Augean stables"/> The pilots' only concession was to resubmit their resignations with the word "forthwith" replaced by "at the end of current operations".<ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 445.]</ref>

[[Image:Jones Kenney (AWM VIC1638).jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Jones (left) and Lieutenant General Kenney (right), in July 1945]]
Following these interviews, Bostock signalled Air Vice Marshal Jones to advise him that morale in 1TAF was at a "dangerously low level" and recommend that Jones fire Cobby and replace him with Air Commodore [[Frederick Scherger]].<ref name="Helson"/><ref name="Odgers">Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 122–23.</ref> Jones considered the pilots' action "absurd", because an officer could not legally resign during wartime, but travelled to Morotai from his headquarters in [[Melbourne]] to investigate the matter personally. He also interviewed the pilots, later declaring, "I believed them all to be sincere in what they were stating and what they had attempted to do ... Yes, sincerely held beliefs, no matter how ill-founded, coupled possibly with a rather exaggerated sense of national duty."<ref name="Helson"/>

Lieutenant General Kenney also became embroiled in the affair, having been informed by Bostock, and insisted on speaking directly to the pilots himself over Jones' protest that this was an internal RAAF disciplinary matter. During a visit to Morotai from his [[Manila]] headquarters, Kenney tried to persuade the officers to reconsider their positions, but again they refused.<ref name="Air War Against Japan"/> He agreed with Bostock that Cobby should be replaced by Scherger, and declared that if the pilots were [[court-martial]]led he would appear in their defence.<ref name="Stephens"/> The commander of the [[I Corps (Australia)|Australian Army's I Corps]], Lieutenant General [[Leslie Morshead]], who was at Morotai preparing for the Borneo campaign, also supported Cobby's removal. Morshead and other senior army officers were concerned that the dispute could disrupt preparations for the Australian landings in Borneo and consulted with Kenney on the matter.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coombes|title=Morshead. Hero of Tobruk and El Alamein|pages=p. 196}}</ref> Jones resolved to dismiss not only Cobby but also his staff officers, Group Captains Gibson and Simms.  Scherger took over as Air Officer Commanding 1TAF on 10 May.<ref name="Air War Against Japan"/><ref name="Air War Against Japan Ch.27">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/27.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 456–59.]</ref><ref name="ADB_Cobby">Isaacs, ''Cobby, Arthur Henry''</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[Image:John Vincent Barry.jpg|thumb|left|Justice John Vincent Barry]]
Ultimately, no court-martial took place for any actions directly related to the "mutiny", and all the pilots except Caldwell continued on operations until the end of the war. An RAAF investigation found that Jones's removal of Cobby, Gibson and Simms was justified.<ref name="Stephens"/> Upon Jones' request, the Australian government also set up an inquiry into events on Morotai which was headed by Justice [[John Vincent Barry]]. Beginning on 16 May 1945, the inquiry focused on both the resignations and the reports of illegal trafficking in alcohol between RAAF and U.S. service personnel on the island.<ref name="Air War Against Japan"/><ref name="Watson1">Watson, ''Killer Caldwell'', pp. 228–39.</ref> While Barry's terms of reference encompassed only 1TAF, the inquiry also heard evidence of shortcomings in the Air Force's higher command that may have contributed to structural and morale problems on Morotai, particularly the bitter and long-running [[George Jones (RAAF officer)#Divided command|feud between Jones and Bostock]] over the division of operational and administrative control of the RAAF in the Pacific.<ref name="Cleaning the Augean stables"/>

The complete report of the inquiry was released in October, preceded by a summary of findings issued on 14 September 1945.<ref name="Alexander"/><ref name="Watson1"/> Judge Barry vindicated Arthur's "balance sheet" and the stand taken by the pilots, finding that their motives in tendering their resignations were sincere.<ref name="Helson"/><ref name="Air War Against Japan"/> No further action was taken against them over the "mutiny" itself, but Caldwell and Gibbes were subsequently court-martialled for their involvement in the alcohol racket and reduced to the rank of [[Flight Lieutenant]].<ref name="Stephens"/><ref>{{cite journal

Unfortunately, it was not within the power of 1st T.A.F. to give them that more important or more interesting work..."<ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 449.]</ref> The incident did not change the RAAF's role in the dying days of the war in the Pacific and may have hindered 1TAF's preparations for the upcoming [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|Battle of Tarakan]].<ref name="Air War Against Japan Ch.27"/> It did however improve the situation on Morotai, as Air Commodore Scherger was successful in restoring morale.<ref name="Helson"/> The "mutineers" considered that they had achieved most of their goals by effecting a change of command in 1TAF and instigating a governmental inquiry.<ref name="Cleaning the Augean stables"/>

News of the resignations, the alcohol racket, and Caldwell's court-martial were widely reported in Australia. Following publication of Barry's findings, ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' in Sydney commented that "the RAAF should have a complete new deal. It is a badly run show and the fault is high up."<ref name="Watson1"/> The same paper later called Caldwell’s court-martial a "witch hunt".<ref>Alexander, ''Clive Caldwell'', pp. 211–15.</ref> Despite this publicity, the action did not become popularly known as the "Morotai Mutiny" until years later. The phrase dated back to the earliest days of the incident, Group Captain Arthur having written it at the top of an ''[[aide-mémoire]]''. He later said that "the alliteration must have appealed to me".<ref name="Cleaning the Augean stables"/> Shortly after writing it, he crossed out "Morotai" and added a question mark following "Mutiny". The term did not catch on with the public at the time, but Arthur's original words have been credited as the source of the name by which the incident eventually became known.<ref name="Alexander"/>
