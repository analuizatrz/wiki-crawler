The '''Radom Air Show''' (referred to in Polish as "[[Air Show]]") is a biannual celebration in the city of [[Radom]], [[Poland]], which began in 2000 (to continue in 2001, 2002, 2003 and then 2005). Every other year during the last weekend of August, military planes from the [[Air Forces]] of [[Europe]] and [[Russia]] are gathered in Radom for the show, which entertains visitors through elaborate stunts and performances from the planes. According to the authorities behind the show, its aim is to entertain the citizens of Radom and all of Poland, as well as to bring much needed investors to the city.

Since its founding, the Radom Air Show has become the most popular and attended air show in all of Poland.

On [[1 September]] [[2007 in aviation|2007]], a mid-air collision claimed the life of two Polish pilots from the AZL Å»elazny aerobatics team, during their aerial acrobatic display.  The two pilots were Piotr Banachowicz and the founder of the acrobatics group, Lech Marchelewski. The incident happened as three [[Zlin Z-526]]s were performing a cross-over manoeuvre. Two of the aircraft collided at right angles and disintegrated in mid-air, killing the pilots instantly.
