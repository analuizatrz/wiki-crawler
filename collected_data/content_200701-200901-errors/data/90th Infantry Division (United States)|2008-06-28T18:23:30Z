===Combat Chronicle=== 
The 90th Infantry Division landed in [[England]], 5 April 1944, and trained from 10 April to 4 June. 

First elements of the division saw action on [[D-Day]], 6 June, on [[Utah Beach]], [[Normandy]], the remainder entering combat 10 June, cutting across the [[Merderet|Merderet River]] to take [[Pont l'Abbe]] in heavy fighting. After defensive action along the river [[Douve]], the division attacked to clear the Foret de Mont-Castre (Hill 122), clearing it by 11 July, in spite of fierce resistance. An attack on the island of [[Saint-Germain-sur-Sèves]] failing, 23 July, the 90th bypassed it and took [[Périers, Manche|Périers]], 27 July. 

On 12 August, the division drove across the [[Sarthe River]], north and east of [[Le Mans]], and took part in the closing of the [[Falaise Gap]], by reaching [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Polish Armored Division]] in [[Chambois]], 19 August. 

It then raced across France, through [[Verdun]], 6 September, to participate in the siege of [[Metz]], 14 September-19 November, capturing [[Maizières-lès-Metz]], 30 October, and crossing the [[Moselle River]] at [[Kœnigsmacker]], 9 November. 

On 6 December 1944, the division pushed across the [[Saar River]] and established a bridgehead north of [[Saarlautern]] (present-day [[Saarlouis]]), 6-18 December, but with the outbreak of the [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]'s (Army Group A) drive, the [[Battle of the Bulge]], withdrew to the west bank on 19 December, and went on the defensive until 5 January 1945, when it shifted to the scene of the [[Ardennes]] struggle. It drove across the [[Our River]], near [[Oberhausen]], 29 January, to establish and expand a bridgehead. In February, the division smashed through [[Siegfried Line]] fortifications to the [[Prüm River]]. 

After a short rest, the 90th continued across the Moselle River to take [[Mainz]], 22 March, and crossed the rivers [[Rhine]], the [[Main]], and the [[Werra]] in rapid succession. Pursuit continued to the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] border, 18 April 1945, and into the [[Sudetes]] mountain range. The division was en route to [[Prague]] when the [[European Theatre of World War II|war in Europe]] ended, 8 May 1945.
