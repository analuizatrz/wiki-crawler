The '''[[Most Serene Republic]] of San Marino''' ({{lang-it|Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino}}) is the third smallest nation in Europe (after [[Monaco]] and [[Vatican City]]). Located in southern [[Europe]], it is an [[enclave]] surrounded by [[Italy]], and is one of the [[European microstates]]. According to legend, San Marino is the oldest constitutional [[republic]] in the world still in existence today.<ref>http://www.loc.gov/law/guide/sanmarino.html</ref> It was founded in AD &nbsp;[[301]] by [[Saint Marinus|Marinus]] of [[Rab]], a Christian [[stonemason]] fleeing the religious persecution of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]].

San Marino is the fifth least-populous sovereign country in the world (larger only than the [[Vatican City]], <!--[[Monaco]], -->[[Tuvalu]], [[Nauru]], and [[Palau]]). It is the smallest member, in terms of population, of the [[Western European and Others Group]] (WEOG) unofficial political-geographical grouping of the [[United Nations]]. It is also the smallest non-[[English language|English]] speaking member of the [[United Nations]] in terms of population. It is the smallest country or other jurisdiction participating in European football competitions.

== History of San Marino ==  
According to legend, Marino left the Adriatic island of [[Rab]] (Italian Arbe) with his lifelong friend Leo and went to the town of [[Rimini]] as a stone worker. After persecution because of his [[Christian]] sermons, he escaped to the nearby [[Monte Titano]], where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and the state of San Marino. The official date of foundation of the Republic is [[3 September]] [[301]].

By the mid-5th cent., a community was formed; because of its relatively inaccessible location and its poverty, it has succeeded, with a few brief interruptions, in maintaining its independence. In 1631 its independence was recognized by the papacy.

During the early phase of the Italian unification process of the 19th century, San Marino served as a haven of refuge for numerous persons who were persecuted because of their support for [[Italian unification]]. In memory of this support, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] accepted the wish of San Marino not to be incorporated into the new Italian state.

During [[World War II]] San Marino was able to officially remain neutral. [[Axis forces]] retreated through the country and were pursued by the US and Great Britain. The allied troops left the country a few weeks later.

The [[head of state]] is a committee (council) of two captains-regent. San Marino also holds the record for the world's first democratically elected [[Communism|communist]] government, which held office between [[1945]] and [[1957]].

San Marino was the world's smallest republic from [[301]] to [[1968]], losing the title to the newly independent [[Nauru]].

San Marino became a member of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1988 and of the [[UN]] in 1992. It is not a member of the [[European Union]].

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=San Marino}}

The ''Consiglio Grande e Generale'' ("Grand and General Council") is elected by popular vote every five years. This [[parliament]] selects two of its members to serve as ''Capitani Reggenti'' ("Captains Regent") for periods of six months. The ''Capitani Reggenti'' and the cabinet form the [[executive branch]] of the government.

The Council also elects the ''Consiglio dei XII'' (Council of Twelve), which forms the [[judicial branch]] during the period of legislature of the Council.

== Municipalities ==
San Marino is divided into the following nine municipalities, known locally as ''castelli'' or ''castles'' (sing. ''castello'', each on a different hill, as depicted on the republic's coat of arms), that are also towns to the world. 

*[[San Marino, San Marino|The City of San Marino]] (''Città di San Marino'') is the eponymous capital. There are also eight minor municipalities: 
*[[Acquaviva, San Marino|Acquaviva]]
*[[Borgo Maggiore]]
*[[Chiesanuova]]
*[[Domagnano]]
*[[Faetano]]
*[[Fiorentino]]
*[[Montegiardino]]
*[[Serravalle, San Marino|Serravalle]]
[[Image:San Marino.png|thumb|280px|[[Subnational|Administrative division]].]]
:*The largest town of the Republic is [[Dogana]], which is not an autonomous castello but rather belongs to the castello of Serravalle.

Each castello, like Italian [[comune|''comuni'']], includes a main town that is the seat of the castello, called ''capoluogo'', and some even smaller localities known as ''[[frazione|frazioni]]''.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of San Marino}}
[[Image:San-Marino-vista-1282.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Much of the Republic can be seen from the top of Mount Titano]]

San Marino is an [[enclave]] in Italy, on the border between the [[Regions of Italy|''regioni'']] of [[Emilia Romagna]] and [[Marche]]. Its topography is dominated by the [[Apennines]] mountain range, and it has a rugged terrain. The highest point in the country, [[Monte Titano]], is situated at 749&nbsp;metres (2,457&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above sea level. There are no bodies of water of any significant size.

The [[climate]] is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], with warm summers and mild winters.

San Marino is the third-smallest country in Europe, with only [[Vatican City]] and [[Monaco]] being smaller.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of San Marino}}

Although San Marino is not an official [[European Union]] member, it is allowed to use the [[euro]] as its [[currency]] by virtue of arrangements with the council of the [[European Union]]; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the [[euro coins]]. Before the Euro, the [[Sammarinese lira]] was coupled to and exchangeable with the [[Italian lira]]. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to [[coin collecting|coin collectors]].

The [[tourism|tourist]] sector contributes over 50% of San Marino's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], with more than 3.3 million tourists visiting in [[1997]]. Other key [[industry|industries]] are [[bank]]ing, [[electronics]], and [[ceramic]]s. The main [[agriculture|agricultural]] products are [[wine]] and [[cheese]].

San Marino's [[postage stamp]]s, which are only valid for mail posted within the country, are mostly sold to [[philately|philatelists]] and also form a source of income. San Marino is a member of the [[Small European Postal Administration Cooperation]].

The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of Italy, which supplies much of its food.
