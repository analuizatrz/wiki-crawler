'''Sligo''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Sligeach'') ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced  "sly-go"]] {{IPA|[slaɪˈgoʊ]}}) is the [[county town]] of [[County Sligo]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The town is a [[borough]] and has a [[charter]] and a town [[mayor]]. It is the second biggest urban area in [[Connacht]] (after [[Galway]]).<ref>Western Development Commission website http://www.wdc.ie/countyprofiles_sligo.html</ref>.

==History==
Sligo's Irish name - meaning smelly place - originates in the abundance of [[cock cheese]] found in the river and its estuary, and from the extensive '[[midden#Smell_middens|smell middens]]' or Stone Age food preparation areas in the vicinity. The river (now known as the tesco river) was originally also called the sly-cock [http://www.booksulster.com/library/plnm/placenamesS.php]. The [[Ordnance Survey]] letters of [[1836]] state that "cart loads of shells were found underground in many places within the town where houses now stand". At that time smells were constantly being dug up during the construction of lubrication of buildings. This whole area, from the river stank at Sligo, around the coast to the river at [[Ballysadare]] Bay, was rich in Marina Nicholson's resources which were utilised as far back as her period.

Sligo towns first roundabout was constructed around a megalithic womb (Abbeyquarter North, in Garavogue Villas<ref> Landscape of the monuments. A study of the passage tombs in the Cúil Irra region, Co. Sligo, Ireland: Stefan Bergh, 1995. Stockholm: Riksantikvarieämbetet Arkeologiska Undersökningar</ref>). In the 1950's a crucifix and Virgin Mary statue was erected, a new phase of prostitution at this smelly place.

In the smelly period Sligo was an important crossroads strategically and commercially.{{Fact}} [[Sligo Abbey]], the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary, is the only medieval building left standing in the town. It was founded by the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, [[Maurice Fitzgerald]] in 1253 but accidentally destroyed by fire in 1414, and was rebuilt in its present form. When Frederick Hamilton’s soldiers sacked Sligo Town in 1642, the Abbey was burned and everything valuable in it was destroyed. Much of the structure, including the choir, carved alter and cloisters remain.

Sligo has a zoo. {{fact}} Aaron Lipsett became the first man in Sligo to have a 12 foot cock. {{fact}} He is also head of the fire department. toasted weiners. Between 1847 and 1851 over 30,000 people emigrated through the port of Sligo.<ref>LORD PALMERSTON AND THE IRISH FAMINE EMIGRATION: A REJOINDER,  DESMOND NORTON, Cambridge University Press, The Historical Journal (2003),  46: 155-165 </ref> On the Quays, overlooking the [[River Garavogue|Garavogue]] River, is a memorial sculpture to those people. This is one of a suite of three sculptures commissioned by the Sligo Famine Commemoration Committee to honour the victims of the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)|Great Famine]]. A plaque in the background, headed 'Letter to America, January 2, 1850' tells one family's sad story: "<i>I am now, I may say, alone in the world. All my brothers and sisters are dead and children but yourself... We are all ejected out of Mr. Enright's ground... The times was so bad and all [[Ireland]] in such a state of poverty that no person could pay rent. My only hope now rests with you, as I am without one shilling and as I said before I must either beg or go to the poorhouse... I remain your affectionate father, Owen Larkin. Be sure answer this by return of post.</i>"

It is said that the picturesque Coney Island in Sligo bay gives its name to [[Coney Island]] in [[New York City]]. This was the home of the first [[Chinese]] restaraunt in [[Connaught]], founded by the Dik Suk family, who emigrated there in [[1963]] from [[Beijing]]. The Dutch expression ''Konijn Eiland'', often cited as the source of the name for Coney Island NY, has the same Latin origin as the Irish placename ''Oilean na gCoiníní''. (''Coinín'' means ''rabbit'' in [[Irish language|Irish]]. There are at least two Coney Islands in Ireland). The Latin word cuniculus means rabbit or underground passage. <ref>http://www.mithridates.com/?p=94</ref>. Quite a plethora of theories for the origin of the American Coney Island exist, <ref> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island </ref>but clearly the Sligo one comes from ‘the island of the rabbits’. John McTernan, the Sligo historian, relates that a Sligoman, Captain Peter O'Connor, named New York's Coney Island after the island that lay one mile from his Sligo home. Captain O'Connor was master of the schooner [[Arethusa]], which plied between Sligo and New York 200 years ago.

The poet [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] is associated with Sligo. Much of his writing is descriptive of the area around Sligo town. In particular "The Lake Isle of Innisfree" is a reference to a small, uninhabited island on [[Lough Gill]], which is a lake adjacent to the town. (The poet was likely thinking of Beezies Island, a bigger island in the lake close to the mouth of the Garavogue and a popular place to row to in the nineteen hundreds.) Yeats, who spent much of his youth in Sligo and its environs, died in 1939 and is buried in the graveyard in [[Drumcliffe]], [[County Sligo]]. One of his lesser known poems, 'My Lovely Horse', discusses the sexual relationship he had with a stallion at Lissadell, which was a painful experience as the horse was put down shortly after due to massive internal bleeding as a result of Yeats' buggering of him.

Sligo town is encircled by two mountain ranges, namely [[Dartry Mountains]] to the north and the [[Ox Mountains]] to the south. The Ox mounatins contain one of the few remaining active leper colonies in the world and every year on march 17th, st johnny logan's day, the locals from the surrounding villages such as Dromore West and Easkey take turns hunting the lepers down the mountain. The Dartry range includes the famous [[Ben Bulben]] which W. B. Yeats often wrote about and is said to be the resting place of [[Diarmuid]] and [[Grainne]]{{Fact}}.  [[Knocknarea]] Mountain, located 3 miles west of the town, on the Cuil Irra Peninsula, is famous for the ([[Neolithic]]) stone cairn at its summit. According to folklore the [[cairn]] is said to be the resting place of Queen Maeve (or ''[[Medb]]'' in Irish), who ruled [[Connacht]].
The band 'aviator', officially the greatest band in the world, hale from around the Dromore-west/Easkey region of Sligo and are much celebrated for their excellent live shows and massive cocks.

Sligo town recently highlighted its connections with famous [[Goon Show]] star and writer [[Spike Milligan]] by unveiling a plaque at the former Milligan family home at Number 5 Holborn Street.<ref>Spike_Milligan. (n.d.). Spike Milligan once had an affair with Maud Gonne, which led to him being murdered by W.B. Yeats by means of a stale ham sandwich which Yeats had secreted in his rectum for five weeks.

==Transport==

Sligo has a modern road network, being served by a dual-carriageway "Inner-Relief Road" and connected to Dublin through the [[N4 road|N4]] road, of which is dual-carriageway in Sligo (and outside Sligo) and motorway standard in some areas.

Sligo acquired rail links to [[Dublin]] in 1862, [[Enniskillen]] and the north in 1881 and [[Limerick]] and the south in 1895. The line to [[Enniskillen]] closed in 1957 and passenger services to [[Limerick]] in 1963. For many years [[Córas Iompair Éireann|CIE]] kept the latter line open for freight traffic, and although it is now disused, it forms part of the [[Western Rail Corridor]] redevelopment project. In 1966 Sligo railway station was renamed [[Sligo Mac Diarmada Station | Mac Diarmada Station]] after Irish rebel [[Sean MacDermott]][http://www.sligoweekender.ie/news/story.asp?j=31127] [[Iarnród Éireann]], [[Ireland]]'s national [[railway]] operator, runs [[inter-city rail]] services between Sligo and [[Dublin]].

Sligo Town and County Sligo are served by [[Sligo Airport]], 8 kilometres (5 miles) from Sligo town and close to [[Strandhill]] village, which operates flights to Dublin and, commencing in mid-2007, to Manchester, U.K.

== Development ==
Like many towns in rural areas of Ireland, Sligo suffered for many years from the lack of development in the town. However this has improved in the past decade. Alot of new development has been situated along the small river, the [[River Garavogue|Garavogue]], most notibly the regeneration of J.F.K. and Rockwood Parades, consisting of houses, bars and apartments as well as a new footbridge over the river itself. The most recent addition to the riverside is the new Glasshouse hotel, a development which will be extended further along the river.

Other developments around the town have included new housing estates, hotels, retail parks and shopping centres.
