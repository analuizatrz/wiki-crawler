'''Margao''' {{audio|Margaon.ogg|pronunciation}} ([[Konkani]]/[[Marathi]]:मडगांव), is also called '''Margão''' and '''Madgaon'''. It is [[Goa]]'s second largest but busiest town, the commercial capital of the state, and the administrative headquarters of [[South Goa]] District and of the [[Salcete|Salcete Taluka]]. 

'Margao' is considered as the Commercial Capital Of Goa. And Located in the Central Region of Goa, is the Place Most Suitable for Staying, Business, Entertainment, and Fun.

The name may be pronounced as 'Maudgao' in [[Konkani]], the local language.  Margão is the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] form, and the form Margao is also common. It is derived from ''Mathagram'' which means a place with a [[matha]]. 

Nestled on the banks of the [[River Sal]], Margão is amongst the oldest recorded towns in Goa. Margão is famous for the huge [[Portugal|Portuguese]] style mansions which dot its landscape. It is also one of the fastest growing cities in Goa and includes several suburbs including [[Aquem]], Fatorda, Gogol, Borda, Comba, Davorlim and Fatorda.

== Transport ==

The Margão Railway station is Goa's biggest and most important as it is a railway junction positioned at the intersection of the [[Konkan Railway]] and the [[South Western Railway]]. All trains passing through Goa stop here, and it is the gateway to south Goa.  Hence Margão is used more commonly as a transit stop rather than as a tourist destination, by many people who either head off down south to [[Palolem]] (38 km) or to Benaulim and Colva which are about six kilometers away.

''Town Square''

This town square boasts of two gardens - Municipal Garden and the Aga Khan Market - which are a perfect place to enjoy peace and beauty. Moreover, there are other attractions in the square in the form of statue of Luis de Menezes Braganca and a Public library. The library is housed in the Municipal Building and has books in various languages - Hindi, Marathi, Konkani, English and Portuguese. You can just sit in and read a book of your choice with no one to disturb you. Though the library is open from 9 am to 1 pm and then from 3 to 6.30 pm, the reading hall itself is open from 8 am to 8 pm. If you just want to have a look at the books or refer them, you will not even need to pay up.

''Church Square''

This is another hotspot for visitors to Margao. Also known as the Largo da Igreja, the Church Square has the Church of Holy Spirit as its prime attraction. The church was initially constructed by the Jesuits in 1564, however very soon, the army of Adil Shah marched in and destroyed it. Repairs were carried out much later and took around 30 years to complete. Today, the church is considered one of the best example of the Indian Baroque. Both the interior and exterior of the church is worth seeing.

Another attraction of the Church Square is the Sat Burnzam Ghor or the House of the seven gables. This ancestral home of Eurico da Silva has drawn tourist for a long time now. However, do not look out for seven gables because there are only three remaining now. You can visit the house between 9 am to 12 in the noon and then from 4 to 7 pm.

''Monte Hill''

This is a good place from where you can have a good look at the Salcett taluka. There is a chapel, Monte Chapel from where you catch your glimpses of Salcett countryside. You can reach the chapel by a motorcycle taxi.

''Few Other Churches and Temples''

There are two churches and two temples which you can visit during your stay at Margao. The first of these is the Grace Church with a rare crucifix of the resurrected Christ. The image of Christ here is covered by a sheet, however, the crown of thorn is absent. The church is open from 7 to 10 in the morning and 4 to 7 in the evening. The second one, St Sebastian Chapel is known as the Pandava Chapel. The reason for this becomes quiet evident when you find a group of ancient caves situated right behind the chapel. The caves are under the care of ASI these days. The chapel has been recently elevated to the position of a church. The church is open from 9.30 in the morning to 1 in the afternoon and then again from 4.30 to 6 in the evening.

''Rachol Seminary''

This Seminary can be visited if you are in a mood to travel a bit. This seminary is located at a distance of 8 km from the town itself and is perched at the top of a hillock. The history of church reveals a lot. Evidence suggest, that there was a Shaivite temple here initially. However, later on a Muslim fort was constructed on the same place. Still later, the fort fell into the hands of the Portuguese who built a church here in the year 1521. The remnants of the fort can be seen in the form of the moat and a gate. The Portuguese established a monastery here to train Goan Jesuit priest as to how they should spread Christianity.

This is situated at a distance of around 10 km from Margao and has the Mario Miranda house as its prime highlight. Loutolim was conceived as and represents the village life of Goa as it was in the bygone era. There are huge lifesize figures, stone sculpture and large foot print that serve as a dance floors. There is also a restaurant where you can get a taste of the exotic Goan cuisine.

The mansion was constructed by the affluent Braganza family in the 16th century. It is a two storey structure with 28 windows seen from the entrance itself.

== History ==

Margão in pre-Portuguese times was one of the important settlements in Salcete and known as ''Matha Grama'' (the village of Mathas) as it was a temple town with nine Mathas in temple schools. Most of the inhabitant were [[Brahmin]]. It was then famous for its many outstanding and beautifully built temples, and long before the Portuguese came it had a university with a library. During the Portuguese conquest in 1543 Hindu temples were demolished and Catholic churches were built in their place. Almost all traces of Hindu settlements were wiped out. The first church to be built in Margão, and its replacement in 1579, were destroyed by raiders along with the seminary that had been built along side. The present church was built in 1675.

The initial settlement of Margão grew from the site of the Holy Spirit church. The original temple here was demolished and the temple [[Irrigation tank|tank]] filled up to be replaced by the church and church grounds that came up in its place. While the western side developed as a market place the settlement grew on the eastern side, that is, the Borda region. The settlement grew with the church at its core and extended outwards.

Margão's importance as an administrative and commercial area grew with the increasing dependence of the surrounding towns and villages; leading to the administrative centre with the town hall at its centre being built in the south. The commercial market became attached to it and was hence called ''maud-gao'' or the market town of Goa, and since then the city has grown towards the east.

The Holy Spirit main square is defined on one side by the church with its baroque architecture and the parochial house, and on the other side by the palatial mansions of affluent elite Catholics, positioned in a row. The ''Associação das Communidades'' building and the school being the odd exceptions. They add to its character and sense of scale. They have a maximum height of two stories, and ''balcões'' (singular: ''balcão'') and ''varandas'' facing the square. Parallel to the church square is the commercial street (old market). There is also a landscaped area next to the church called ''Praça da Alegria'' (meaning: joy square).
