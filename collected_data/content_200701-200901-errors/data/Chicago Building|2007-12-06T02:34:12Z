The '''Chicago Building''', built in 1904-1905 at 7 W. [[Madison Street]], [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], by architectural firm [[Holabird & Roche]], is an early and highly visible example of the architectural style known as the [[Chicago School]]. The building's features characterize this style through the use of large "Chicago windows", metal frame construction, distinctive bays, and [[terra cotta]] cladding.  The combination of the north side projecting bay windows, and the east side rectangular "Chicago windows" with movable sashes is representative of the two typical [[Chicago School of Architecture]] window types.<ref name=emp/>  The building is prominently located on the southwest corner of State Steet and Madison Street, with visibility increased by an offset in the alignment of [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]]. The building is a critical component of a grouping of significant structures, including [[Carson Pirie Scott]] and the former Mandel Brothers Store, at what was once labeled the "World's Busiest Corner."  The building was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] on [[March 26]] [[1996]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/C/ChicagoBldg.html|title=Chicago Building|publisher=City of Chicago Dept. of Pl. and Devpmt., Landmarks Div.|date=2003|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> In 1997, it was converted to a [[dormitory]] for the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].<ref name=emp>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=chicagobuilding-chicago-il-usa|accessdate=2007-06-28|date=2007|title=Chicago Building|publisher=Emporis}}</ref>
