'''DevilDriver''' (initially called '''Deathride''') is a [[death metal]]-influenced [[groove metal]] band from [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]]. They were dubbed by [[Phil Anselmo]], the former [[Pantera]] leadman and current [[Down (band)|Down]] lead singer, as the next Pantera.[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=78978] The band are also becoming known for their signature large [[circle pit]]s, much like [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]]'s "[[Wall of death (moshing)|Wall of Death]]".

==Biography==
The group was started by  Dez Fafara and Evan Pitts. Evan saw Dez one morning in a diner in California. The rest of the members were recruited over time. [[Dez Fafara]] is the former frontman of the band [[Coal Chamber]], who broke up prior to his term in DevilDriver, for reasons still hotly debated by many to this day. After the demise of Coal Chamber, DevilDriver became his main focus. Their debut album, the self-titled [[DevilDriver (album)|DevilDriver]], was released on [[October 23]], [[2003]] under [[Roadrunner Records]]. Dez wanted to focus more on the extreme side of music, influenced by [[black metal|black]], [[Death metal|death]], and [[thrash metal]]. This is more apparent on their second album, [[The Fury of Our Maker's Hand]], where one can hear traces of [[Scandinavian death metal]], specifically with the guitar work.

Their second album, ''[[The Fury of Our Maker's Hand]]'', was released in 2005 and was generally well-received by fans and critics alike, even garnering a 4K review from rock magazine [[Kerrang]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrun.com/artists/Devildriver/showphoto.aspx?photoID=10838|title=Kerrang DevilDriver Review Scan}}</ref> 

The band went on numerous tours in support of the album, including stops in the [[United States]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]] in support of bands such as [[In Flames]], [[Fear Factory]], and [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], as well as the Burning Daylight Tour, their first headlining.

On [[October 31]], [[2006]], DevilDriver re-released ''The Fury of Our Maker's Hand'' with three additional studio tracks and three live recordings of previously released material. The special edition also contains a DVD of all of their music videos to date.

Recently, DevilDriver wrapped up the recording sessions for their third album (which was released [[June 16]] and [[June 19]] [[2007]] in Australia and the United Kingdom respectively, and is set to be released on [[July 31]] in the United States), entitled ''[[The Last Kind Words]]'', at Sonic Ranch studios outside El Paso, Texas and promoted it by playing at the British rock festival [[Download Festival]] at [[Donington]] alongside headliners [[Linkin Park]], [[Iron Maiden]], and [[My Chemical Romance]].

"Horn of Betrayal" was debuted from ''The Last Kind Words''. It was played on May 16th on Sirius Satellite's Hard Attack channel.

The entire completed album leaked onto the internet in mid June, 2007.

On July 28th, 2007, the band announced on their [[MySpace]] that they would join [[Ozzfest]] on August 2nd. Stating that they would play at 3:30 in the afternoon, it can be determined they are taking the second stage non-rotating spot left vacant by recently departed [[Mondo Generator]]. DevilDriver will be starting there UK Tour in October 2007

==Genre==
DevilDriver's genre is subject to heavy dispute between fans. Lead singer [[Dez Fafara]] once said in an interview that the band did not want to be pigeonholed to any particular single genre, and that they get inspiration from many different styles of music.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} The band are mainly regarded as [[groove metal]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}}
