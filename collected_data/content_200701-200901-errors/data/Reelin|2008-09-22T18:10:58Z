'''Reelin''' is a [[protein]] found mainly in the [[brain]], but also in the spinal cord, blood and other body organs and tissues. Reelin is crucial for regulating the processes of [[Neural development#Neuronal Migration|neuronal migration]] and positioning in the developing brain.
Besides this important role in early development, reelin continues to work in the adult brain. It modulates the [[synaptic plasticity]] by enhancing [[Long-term potentiation|LTP]] induction and maintenance.<!--

Reelin is implicated in pathogenesis of several brain diseases. Significantly lowered expression of the protein have been found in [[schizophrenia]] and psychotic [[bipolar disorder]], but the cause of it is uncertain as studies show that [[Reelin#Psychotropic_medication_and_reelin_expression|psychotropic medication itself affects RELN expression]] and the epigenetic hypothesis aimed at explaining the changed levels<ref name="urlSchizophrenia Research Forum: Current Hypotheses"/> has received some contradictory evidence.<!--

[[Image:Reeler_lamination.png|thumb|right|250px|Normal and [[Reeler]] mice brain slices.]]
Mutant mice provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of the development of the [[Central nervous system|CNS]]. Useful spontaneous mutations were first identified by scientists interested in motor behavior, and it proved relatively easy to screen [[littermate]]s for mice that showed difficulties moving around the cage. A number of such mice were found and given descriptive names such as reeler, weaver, lurcher, nervous, and staggerer.

The "[[reeler]]" mouse was first described in the [[1951]] by [[Douglas Scott Falconer|D.S.Falconer]].<!--

The downstream pathway of Reelin was further clarified using other mutant mice, including [[yotari]] and [[Scrambler mouse|scrambler]]. These mutants have phenotypes similar to that of reeler but have no mutation in reelin. It was then demonstrated that the mouse ''disabled homologue 1'' ([[DAB1|Dab1]]) gene is responsible for the phenotypes of these mutant mice, as Dab1 protein was absent (yotari) or only barely (scrambler) detectable in these mutants.<!--

--> Targeted disruption of Dab1 also caused a phenotype similar to that of reeler. Pinpointing the [[DAB1]] as a pivotal regulator of the reelin signaling cascade started the tedious process of deciphering its complex interactions.

There followed a series of important findings linking reelin's genetic variation and interactions to schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, autism and other highly complex dysfunctions. These and other discoveries, coupled with the perspective of unraveling the evolutionary changes that allowed for the creation of human brain, highly intensified the research. As of 2008, some 13 years after the gene coding the protein was discovered, hundreds of scientific articles address the multiple aspects of its structure and functioning.<!--

Next comes 8 repeats of 300-350 amino acids. These are called ''reelin repeats'' and have an [[Epidermal growth factor|EGF]] motif at their center, dividing each repeat into two subrepeats, ''A'' and ''B''. Despite this interruption, the two subdomains make direct contact, resulting in a compact overall structure.<!--

==Function==

The primary functions of Reelin are the regulation of corticogenesis and neuronal cell positioning in the prenatal period, but the protein is also implicated in a number of other processes, and the research is ongoing.

Reelin is found in numerous tissues and organs, and one could roughly subdivide its functional roles by the time of expression and by localisation of its action.

A number of non-nervous tissues and organs express reelin in the developing organism, with the expression sharply going down after the organ had been formed. The role of the protein here is largely unexplored, because the knockout mice show no major pathology in these organs. In the adult organism the non-neural expression is much less widespread, but goes up sharply when some organs are injured.<!--

--> The exact function of reelin upregulation following an injury is still being researched.

On the other hand, reelin's role in the growing CNS is more important and more explored. It promotes the differentiation of progenitor cells into [[radial glia]] and affects the orientation of its fibers, which serve as the guides for the migrating neuroblasts.<!--

Mammalian corticogenesis is another process where reelin plays a major role. In this process the temporary layer called preplate is split into the marginal zone on the top and subblate below, and the space between them is populated by neuronal layers in the inside-out pattern. In such an arrangement, where the newly created neurons pass through the settled layers and position themselves one step above, is a distinguishing feature of mammalian brain, in contrast to the evolutionary older reptile cortex, in which layers are positioned in an "outside-in" fashion. When reelin is absent, like in the mutant reeler mouse, the order of cortical layering becomes roughly inverted, with younger neurons finding themselves to be unable to pass the settled layers. Subplate neurons fail to stop and invade the uppermost layer, creating the so-called superplate in which they mix with [[Cajal-Retzius cell]]s and some cells normally destined for the second layer. 

[[Image:Pone.0001454.g007.jpg|thumb|280px|Increased reelin expression changes the morphology of migrating neurons: unlike the round neurons with short branches (C) they assume bipolar shape (D) and attach themselves (E) to the [[radial glia]] fibers that are extending in the direction of reelin-expressing cells.

There is no agreement concerning the role of reelin in the proper positioning of  cortical layers.

The protein is thought to  act on migrating neuronal precursors and thus controls correct cell positioning in the cortex and other brain structures. The proposed role is one of a dissociation signal for neuronal groups, allowing them to separate and go from tangential chain-migration to radial individual migration.<!--

--> Dissociation detaches migrating neurons from the [[glial cell]]s that are acting as their guides, converting them into individual cells that can strike out alone to find their final position.

In the adult nervous system, reelin plays an eminent role at the two most active neurogenesis sites, the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus. In some species, the neuroblasts from the subventricular zone migrate in chains in the [[rostral migratory stream]] to reach the olfactory bulb, where reelin dissociates them into individual cells that are able to migrate further individually. They change their mode of migration from tangential to radial, and begin using the radial glia fibers as their guides. In the adult dentate gyrus, reelin provides guidance cues for new neurons that are constantly arriving to the granule cell layer from subgranular zone, keeping the layer compact.<!--

The main action of reelin is apparently conducted through the two members of [[:Category:low density lipoprotein receptor gene family|Low density lipoprotein receptor gene family]], [[VLDL receptor|VLDLR]] and the [[ApoER2]].

The intracellular adaptor [[DAB1]] binds to the VLDLR and ApoER2 through an NPxY motif and is involved in transmission of Reelin signals through these lipoprotein receptors. It becomes phosphorylated and apparently stimulates the [[actin]] cytoskeleton to change its shape, affecting the proportion of integrin receptors on the cell surface, which leads to the change in adhesion. Phosphorylation of DAB1 leads to its [[ubiquitination]] and subsequent degradation, and this explains the hightened levels of DAB1 in the absence of reelin.<!--

===Alzheimer's disease===
According to one study, reelin expression and [[glycosylation]] patterns are altered in [[Alzheimer's disease]]. In the cortex of the patients, reelin levels were 40% higher compared with controls, but the cerebellar levels of the protein remain normal in the same patients.<ref name="alz">{{cite journal |author=Botella-López A, Burgaya F, Gavín R, ''et al'' |title=Reelin expression and glycosylation patterns are altered in Alzheimer's disease |journal=Proc.

DNA methylation patterns are often changed in tumours, and RELN gene could be affected: according to one study, in the pancreatic cancer the expression is suppressed, along with other reelin pathway components.<!--

== Psychotropic medication and reelin expression ==
As reelin is being implicated in a number of brain disorders and its expression is usually measured posthumously, assessing the possible medication effects is important. 

According to the epigenetic hypothesis, drugs that shift the balance in favour of demethylation have a potential to alleviate the proposed methylation-caused downregulation of RELN and GAD67. In one study, closapine and sulpiride but not haloperidol and olanzapine were shown to increase the demethylation of both genes in mice pretreated with l-methionine.<!--

--> Valproic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, when taken in combination with antipsychotics, is proposed to have some benefits. But there are studies conflicting the main premise of the epigenetic hypothesis, and a study by Fatemi et al shows no increase in RELN expression by valproic acid; that indicates the need for further investigation.

Fatemi et al. conducted the study in which RELN mRNA and reelin protein levels were measured in rat prefrontal cortex following  a 21-day of [[intraperitoneal injection]]s of the following drugs:<ref name="Reelin_book_2008"/>
