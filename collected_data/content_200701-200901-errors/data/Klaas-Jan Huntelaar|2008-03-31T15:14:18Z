H. en K. (football club Hummelo and Keppel) where he played for the next six years.<ref name="officialbio"/> Huntelaar was scouted as a youth talent by [[Go Ahead Eagles]], however, the distance required to travel prohibited him from joining the team from [[Deventer]].<ref name="officialbio"/> Soon after he was scouted by [[De Graafschap]] where on [[April 6]], [[1994]] he signed his first youth contract, aged eleven.<ref name="officialbio"/> During his first two years with De Graafschap, Huntelaar played as a left back, a left winger, an attacking midfielder, and even as a goalkeeper; only in his third year was he deployed as a striker.<ref name="officialbio"/> In the 1997–98 season, the now 14 year old Huntelaar was the first striker for the C-team at De Graafschap, and scored 33 goals in 20 matches.<ref name="officialbio"/> The following season saw him promoted to the B1 team, and in the 1999–00 season he became top scorer of the B1 league with 31 goals.<ref name="officialbio"/> His goal-scoring abilities drew the attention of [[PSV Eindhoven]], who signed him in June 2000.<ref name="officialbio"/>

Huntelaar is a [[striker]] who plays as a centre forward, or an "out-and-out" striker, rather than as a supporting striker. He has a good technical ability and can score goals with either foot.<ref name="goal.com"/> In an October 2007 interview Huntelaar stressed the importance of fitness to his game: ''"You have to work on every area but I would say that physical fitness is absolutely essential, especially in big games. I need to stay sharp and keep my speed up over 90 minutes, from the kick-off right through to the final whistle. That's fundamental."''<ref name="FIFA interview">{{cite web | title= Classy Huntelaar thinking big | publisher=FIFA.com | url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=609374.html |date=[[2007-10-01]]| accessdate=2007-10-19 }}</ref> He has been compared in playing style to [[Marco van Basten]] and [[Fernando Morientes]].<ref name="goal.com"/><ref name="UEFA profile">{{cite web | title= Huntelaar class shines through | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/Kind=512/newsId=383257.html |date=[[2006-01-13]]| accessdate=2007-10-15 }}</ref> Strikers have traditionally found it very difficult to succeed at Ajax, and Goal.com columnist Wout Stravers has praised Huntelaar for avoiding ending up at the "Amsterdam striker cemetery".<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title=

==Career==
===PSV===
In his first season at PSV, Huntelaar quickly established himself as a prolific goalscorer for their A1 youth team under coach [[Willy van der Kuijlen]] (the all-time top scorer in the Eredivisie with 311 goals), scoring 26 goals in 23 games to become top scorer in the youth league.<ref name="officialbio"/> In his second season at PSV, Huntelaar was added to [[Guus Hiddink]]'s senior team, but failed to secure a place in the starting line-up. He made his first team debut as a [[Substitute (football)|substitute]] for [[Mateja Kežman]] on [[November 23]], [[2002]] in a 0–3 away win over [[RBC Roosendaal]]. This turned out to be his only [[Eredivisie]] appearance for the club.<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title=

===SC Heerenveen===
After Huntelaar turned down the opportunity to sign a new contract with PSV, [[Friesland|Frysian]] club [[SC Heerenveen]] moved in to sign him for a transfer fee of €100,000.<ref name="goal.com"/> The player has since explained his decision not to renew his contract with PSV, saying ''"I was there for two years and when I turned 18 I was loaned out to De Graafschap, where I'd played between the ages of 10 and 16, and then to AgoVV. When I went back to PSV the second time, I wasn't playing and the club didn't offer me anything specific. I just wanted to play and work on my game."''<ref name="FIFA interview"/> Heerenveen chairman [[Riemer van der Velde]] described what the club expected from the player: ''"He is a young, scoring striker who has undergone a good development last season. He will have to prove himself on a higher level, but I expect that he can benefit us greatly. If Huntelaar can score fifteen goals like [[Gerald Sibon|Sibon]] did last season, we can't complain".''<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Heerenveen en PSV eens over Huntelaar | publisher=Friesch Dagblad | url=http://www.frieschdagblad.nl/index.asp?artid=19009 |date=[[2004-06-29]]| accessdate=2007-10-17}} '''Dutch:''' "Het is een jonge, scorende spits die zich afgelopen seizoen goed heeft ontwikkeld.

In the [[Eredivisie 2006/2007|2006–07 Dutch league]], Huntelaar continued scoring, getting 21 goals in the league as Ajax once again finished second.

===Netherlands national team===
Huntelaar participated in the [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship]] for the Netherlands under coach [[Louis van Gaal]]. The striker scored two goals in the tournament before the Dutch were eliminated in the quarter finals by Egypt.<ref name="officialbio"/>

[[Image:Klaas-jan-huntelaar6.jpg|thumb|Huntelaar in 2007.]]
Huntelaar was part of the preliminary [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch squad]] prior to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], but was not chosen in the squad for the tournament itself. Coach [[Marco van Basten]] explained that he felt Huntelaar would benefit from more experience and from playing at the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2006|UEFA Under 21&nbsp;football championships]] in [[Portugal]] with [[Foppe de Haan]]'s [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands U21 squad]], going as far as to say that it was up to Huntelaar to "show us there that by not selecting Huntelaar we did not do the right thing".<ref>{{nl}} {{cite web | title= Huntelaar en Castelen niet naar Duitsland  | publisher=VoetbalOnline| url=http://www.voetbalonline.nl/ecNewsitem.asp?id=46667 |date=[[2006-05-14]]| accessdate=2007-09-16 }}</ref> While Holland went on to score just three goals in four games goals at the World Cup in Germany, the youth side did a lot better in the U21 championship. Huntelaar was the top-scorer of the Under 21 tournament with four goals as the young Dutch were victorious in the tournament. He scored a powerful strike in the semi-final against France and a brace in the final against Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web | title= uefa.com's Team of the Tournament | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/Under21/news/Kind=1/newsId=427313.html |date=[[2006-06-06]]| accessdate=2007-09-16 }}</ref> Huntelaar was named as one of the strikers in the [[2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship#Player awards|UEFA Team of the Tournament]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Huntelaar thrives in Dutch triumph | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/history/season=2006/intro.html |date=[[2006-06-01]]| accessdate=2007-11-15 }}</ref>

Huntelaar's status as a rising star was confirmed when Marco van Basten decided to select the striker as his starting striker in the Dutch National squad's friendly against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on [[August 16]], [[2006]]. Huntelaar paid immediate dividends in his debut for the senior squad by scoring two goals, and making two assists, in Holland's 4&ndash;0 victory.<ref>{{cite web | title= Republic of Ireland 0-4 Holland | publisher=BBC Sport | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4795339.stm |date=[[2006-08-16]]| accessdate=2007-09-16 }}</ref> Huntelaar was the fist player to score on his debut for the Dutch national squad since [[Dick Nanninga]] did so in 1978.<ref name="officialbio"/> However in his next seven caps he did not manage to add another goal, and due to the return of [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] to the team and the presence of other strikers like [[Robin van Persie]], [[Dirk Kuyt]], and [[Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink]], his chances in the team have been limited. After being left out of the squad for a number of games, he was recalled to the squad in October 2007 for the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] qualifying games against Romania and Slovenia.<ref>{{cite web | title= Huntelaar and Robben recalled | publisher=Sky Sports | url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11906_2782526,00.html |date=[[2007-10-05]]| accessdate=2007-10-06 }}</ref> Due to the suspension of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Huntelaar was in the starting line-up against Slovenia, scoring his first competitive international goal in a 2&ndash;0 win.<ref>{{cite web | title= Netherlands near finals goal with win | publisher=UEFA.com | url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/fixturesresults/round=2241/match=83696/report=rp.html |date=[[2007-10-17]]| accessdate=2007-10-18 }}</ref> He scored his fifth and sixth goal for the national team on [[March 26]], [[2008]] in a friendly match against Austria.<ref>{{cite web | title=  Huntelaar caps superb Dutch fightback | publisher=CNN | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/03/26/dutch.austria/ |date=[[2008-03-26]]| accessdate=2008-03-26 }}</ref>
