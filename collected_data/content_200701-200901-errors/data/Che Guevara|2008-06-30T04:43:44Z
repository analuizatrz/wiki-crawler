'''Ernesto "Che" Guevara''' (<!-- Note: Please do not change birth date without discussing on talk page first. -->[[June 14]],<ref name=birthdate/> [[1928]] – [[October 9]], [[1967]]), commonly known as '''Che Guevara''', '''El Che''', or simply '''Che''', was an [[Argentine]] [[Marxist]] [[revolutionary]], politician, author, physician, military theorist, and [[guerrilla]] leader. After his death, his stylized image became an ubiquitous [[countercultural]] symbol worldwide.

As a young medical student, Guevara travelled throughout [[Latin America]] and was transformed by the endemic [[poverty]] he witnessed. His experiences and observations during these trips led him to conclude that the region's ingrained economic [[economic inequality|inequalities]] were an intrinsic result of [[monopoly capitalism]], [[neo-colonialism]], and [[imperialism]], with the only remedy being [[world revolution]]. This belief prompted his involvement in [[Guatemala|Guatemala's]] social reforms under President [[Jacobo Arbenz]], whose eventual [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|CIA-assisted overthrow]] solidified Guevara’s radical ideology.

Later, in [[Mexico]], he met [[Fidel Castro]] and joined his [[26th of July Movement]]. In December 1956, he was among the revolutionaries who invaded Cuba under Castro's leadership with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban [[dictator]] [[Fulgencio Batista]].  Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents, was promoted to ''Comandante'', and played a pivotal role in the successful guerrilla campaign that deposed Batista.<ref>[[#refCastrosbrain1960|''"Castro's Brain"'']] 1960.</ref> Following the [[Cuban revolution]], Guevara oversaw the revolutionary tribunals and executions of suspected [[war criminal|war criminals]] from the previous regime. Later he served as minister of industry and president of the national bank, before traversing the globe to meet an array of world leaders on behalf of Cuban [[socialism]]. He was also a prolific writer and diarist, with one of his most influential works being a manual on the theory and practice of [[Guerrilla Warfare (book)|guerrilla warfare]]. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to incite revolutions first in an unsuccessful attempt in [[Congo-Kinshasa]] and then in [[Bolivia]], where he was captured with the help of the [[CIA]] and executed.

Both notorious for his harsh discipline and revered for his unwavering dedication to his revolutionary doctrines, Guevara remains an admired, controversial, and significant historical figure. As a result of his death and romantic visage, along with his invocation to armed [[class struggle]] and desire to create the consciousness of a "new man" driven by "moral" rather than "material" incentives <ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm Socialism and man in Cuba], by Che Guevara, First Published: March 12 1965, Source: The Che Reader, Ocean Press, 2005.</ref>; Guevara evolved into a quintessential icon of [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] inspired movements, as well as a global merchandising sensation. He has been venerated and reviled in [[Additional materials on Che Guevara|a multitude]] of biographies, memoirs, books, essays, documentaries, songs, and films.

Ernesto Guevara was born on <!-- Note: Please do not change birth date without discussing on talk page first. -->[[14 June]], [[1928]]<ref name=birthdate/> in [[Rosario]], [[Argentina]], the eldest of five children in a family of [[Basque people|Basque]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.<ref>Che's last name ''"Guevara"'' derives from the [[Castilian Spanish|Castilianized]] form of the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''"Gebara"'', a habitational name from the province of [[Álava]].</ref>  Growing up in a family with [[leftist]] leanings, Guevara was introduced to a wide spectrum of political perspectives even as a boy. Though suffering from the crippling bouts of [[asthma]] that were to afflict him throughout his life, he excelled as an athlete. He was an avid [[rugby union]] player and earned himself the nickname "Fuser"&mdash;a contraction of "El Furibundo" (raging) and his mother's surname "de la Serna"&mdash;for his aggressive style of play.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 28.</ref> Ernesto was also nicknamed "Chancho" (pig) by his schoolmates, because he rarely bathed, and proudly wore a "weekly shirt".

Guevara learned [[chess]] from his father and began participating in local tournaments by the age of 12. During his adolescence and throughout his life he was passionate about poetry, especially that of [[Pablo Neruda|Neruda]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Antonio Machado|Machado]], [[Federico García Lorca|Lorca]], [[Gabriela Mistral|Mistral]], [[César Vallejo|Vallejo]], and [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]].<ref>[[#refHart2004|Hart 2004]], pg 98.</ref> He could also recite [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling's]] ''[["If"]]'' and [[José Hernández|Hernández's]] ''"[[Martín Fierro]]"'' from memory.<ref>[[#refHart2004|Hart 2004]], pg 98.</ref> The Guevara home contained more than 3,000 books, which allowed Guevara to be an enthusiastic and eclectic reader, with interests including [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]], [[André Gide|Gide]], and [[Jules Verne|Verne]].<ref>[[#refHaney2005|Haney 2005]], p. 164.</ref> He also enjoyed reading [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]; as well as [[Anatole France|France]], [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[H.G.

These included composing analytical sketches of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Aristotle]], along with examining [[Bertrand Russell]] on love and patriotism, [[Jack London]] on society, and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] on the idea of death. [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] ideas also fascinated him as he quoted him on a variety of topics from [[Dream interpretation|dreams]] and [[libido]], to [[narcissism]] and the [[oedipus complex]].<ref>([[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 37-38)</ref>

In 1948, Guevara entered the [[University of Buenos Aires]] to study medicine. While still a student in 1951, Guevara took a year off from his medical studies to embark on a trip traversing [[South America]] by motorcycle with his friend [[Alberto Granado]], with the final goal of spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo [[Leper colony]] in [[Peru]], on the banks of the [[Amazon River]]. Guevara used notes taken during this trip to write an account entitled ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries]]'', which later became a ''New York Times'' best-seller,<ref>NYT bestseller list: [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/books/bestseller/0220bestpapernonfiction.html #38 Paperback Nonfiction on 2005-02-20], [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E5D6123DF934A35752C1A9629C8B63&scp=5&sq=motorcycle+diaries+Ernesto+%28Che%29+Guevara&st=nyt #9 Nonfiction on 2004-10-07] and on more occasions.</ref> and was adapted into a 2004 [[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)#Awards|award-winning]] film of the [[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|same name]].
 
Witnessing the widespread poverty, [[oppression]] and disenfranchisement throughout Latin America, and influenced by his readings of [[Marxist]] literature, Guevara began to view armed revolution as the solution to social inequality. By trip's end, he also viewed Latin America not as separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide liberation strategy. His conception of a borderless, united [[Hispanic America]] sharing a common '[[mestizo]]' Hispanic America was a theme that prominently recurred during his later revolutionary activities.  Upon returning to Argentina, he completed his studies and received his medical diploma in June of [[1953]].<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 98.</ref>

{{Cquote2|After graduation, due to special circumstances and perhaps also to my character, I began to travel throughout America, and I became acquainted with all of it. Except for [[Haiti]] and [[Santo Domingo]], I have visited, to some extent, all the other [[Latin America|Latin American]] countries. Because of the circumstances in which I traveled, first as a student and later as a doctor, I came into close contact with [[poverty]], hunger and disease; with the inability to treat a child because of lack of money; with the stupefaction provoked by the continual hunger and punishment, to the point that a father can accept the loss of a son as an unimportant accident, as occurs often in the [[Lumpenproletariat|downtrodden classes]] of our American homeland. And I began to realize at that time that there were things that were almost as important to me as becoming famous for making a significant contribution to medical science: I wanted to help those people.|Che Guevara, 1960 <ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1960/08/19.htm Ernesto Che Guevara: On Revolutionary Medicine] Speech to the Cuban Militia on August 19 1960.</ref>}}

On [[July 7]], [[1953]], Guevara set out again, this time to [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]. In December 1953 he arrived in [[Guatemala]] where President [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]] headed a democratically elected government that, through [[land reform]] and other initiatives, was attempting to end the ''[[latifundia]]'' system. Guevara decided to settle down in Guatemala so as to "perfect [him]self and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary".<ref>[[#refGuevaraLynch2000|Guevara Lynch 2000]], p. 26.</ref>

In Guatemala City, Guevara sought out Hilda Gadea Acosta, a Peruvian economist who was well-connected politically as a member of the left-leaning [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA). She introduced Guevara to a number of high-level officials in the [[Arbenz]] government. Guevara also established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to [[Fidel Castro]] through the [[July 26]], [[1953]] attack on the  [[Moncada Barracks]]  in [[Santiago de Cuba]].<ref>[[#refRadioCadena2006|Radio Cadena Agramonte 2006]].</ref> During this period he acquired his famous nickname, due to his frequent use of the Argentine interjection "[[Che (Spanish)|che]]", which is used in much the same way as "hey" or "pal".<ref>[[#refCormier2002|Cormier 2002]], p. 80.</ref>

Guevara's attempts to obtain a medical internship were unsuccessful and his economic situation was often precarious.<!--<ref name=precarious>Anderson 1997, pp. 139&ndash;141.</ref>--> On [[May 15]], [[1954]] a shipment of [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] infantry and light artillery weapons was sent from [[Communist]] [[Czechoslovakia]] for the Arbenz Government and arrived in [[Puerto Barrios]],<ref name=usdepstate>[[#refUSDeptState2008|U.S. Department of State 2008]].</ref><ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 144.</ref> prompting a CIA-sponsored coup attempt.<ref name=usdepstate />  Guevara was eager to fight on behalf of Arbenz and joined an armed [[militia]] organized by the Communist Youth for that purpose, but frustrated with the group's inaction, he soon returned to medical duties. Following the coup, he again volunteered to fight, but soon after, Arbenz took refuge in the Mexican Embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country. After Hilda Gadea was arrested, Guevara sought protection inside the Argentine [[consulate]], where he remained until he received a safe-conduct pass some weeks later and made his way to [[Mexico]].<ref>[[#refTaibo1999|Taibo 1999]], p. 74.</ref>

The overthrow of the Arbenz regime cemented Guevara's view of the United States as an [[imperialism|imperialist]] power that would oppose and attempt to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries. This strengthened his conviction that Marxism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions.<ref>[http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch24x.html Che Guevara 1960-67 by Frank E.

Guevara arrived in [[Mexico City]] in early September 1954, and renewed his friendship with Ñico López and the other Cuban exiles whom he had met in Guatemala. In June 1955, López introduced him to [[Raúl Castro]] who subsequently introduced him to his older brother, [[Fidel Castro]], the revolutionary leader who had formed the [[26th of July Movement]] and was now plotting to overthrow the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]]. During a lengthy conversation with Castro on the night of their first meeting, Guevara concluded that the Cuban's cause was the one for which he had been searching and before daybreak he had signed up as a member of the 26J Movement.<ref>[[#refTaibo2003|Taibo 2003]], p. 93.</ref>

Although he planned to be the group's medic, Guevara participated in the military training with the members of the Movement, and, at the end of the course, was called "the best guerrilla of them all" by their instructor, Colonel  [[Alberto Bayo]].<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 194.</ref> The first step in Castro's revolutionary plan was an assault on [[Cuba]] from Mexico via the ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]],'' an old, leaky cabin cruiser. They set out for Cuba on [[November 25]], [[1956]]. Attacked by Batista's military soon after landing, many of the 82 men were either killed in the attack or executed upon capture; only 22 found each other afterwards.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 213.</ref> Guevara wrote that it was during this bloody confrontation that he laid down his medical supplies and picked up a box of ammunition dropped by a fleeing comrade, finalizing his symbolic transition from physician to combatant.

[[Image:Cheincolor.jpg|thumb|right|150px|<small>In his trademark olive green military fatigues, [[June 2]], [[1959]]</small> ]]

Only a small band of revolutionaries survived to re-group as a bedraggled fighting force deep in the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains, where they received support from the [[urban guerrilla]] network of [[Frank País]], the 26th of July Movement, and local country folk. With the group withdrawn to the Sierra, the world wondered whether Castro was alive or dead until early 1957 when the interview by [[Herbert Matthews]] appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''. The article presented a lasting, almost mythical image for Castro and the guerrillas. Guevara was not present for the interview, but in the coming months he began to realize the importance of the media in their struggle. Meanwhile, as supplies and morale grew low, Guevara considered these "the most painful days of the war."<ref>[[#refDePalma2006|DePalma 2006]], pp. 110&ndash;111.</ref> 

At this point Castro promoted Guevara to ''comandante'' of a second army column. However, Guevara's first idea to hit an enemy garrison at Bueuycito did not go as planned. When his men were late to arrive, he began the attack without them. He told a sentry to halt, but when the sentry moved, Guevara decided to shoot. However, his gun jammed, as did the gun of the young rebel who was with him. Guevara fled under a hail of bullets, which in turn brought a hail of bullets from the rebels in the hills, and the barracks surrendered before Guevara repaired his tommy gun. As Guevara said, "My survival instincts took over."<ref>[[#refGuevara1996|Guevara 1996]], Attack on Bueycito. (See reference to "El Viscaíno" on page 186.)</ref>

As Guevara reconsidered his tactics, he imposed even harsher disciplinary treatment. Deserters were punished as traitors, and Guevara was known to send execution squads to hunt down those seeking to escape.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 269&ndash;270.</ref> As a result, Guevara became feared for his brutality and ruthlessness.<ref>[[#refCastaneda1998|Castañeda 1998]],  pp. 105, 119.</ref> During the guerrilla campaign, Guevara was also responsible for the [[execution]] of a number of men accused of being [[Informant|informers]], [[Desertion|deserters]] or [[Espionage|spies]].<ref name="execution-squads">[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 269&ndash;270, 277&ndash;278.</ref> 

Guevara was also instrumental in creating the clandestine radio station ''[[Radio Rebelde]]'' in [[February]] [[1958]], which broadcast news to the Cuban people and statements by the 26th of July movement, and provided radio telephone communication between the growing number of rebel columns across the island. Guevara had apparently been inspired to create the station by observing the effectiveness of [[CIA]] supplied radio in Guatemala in ousting the government of [[Jacobo Arbenz]].<ref name="radio">[http://www.swl.net/patepluma/central/cubain/rebel1.html  Revolution!

[[Image:Che SClara.jpg|thumb|150px|right|<small>After the [[battle of Santa Clara]], [[January 1]], [[1959]]</small> ]]

In late [[July]] of [[1958]] Guevara would play a critical role in the [[Battle of Las Mercedes]] by using his column to halt a force of 1,500 men called up by Batista's General Cantillo in a plan to encircle and destroy Castro's forces. Years later, [[USMC]] Major Larry Bockman, would analyze and describe Che's tactical appreciation of this battle as "brilliant".<ref>[[#refBockman1984|Bockman 1984]].</ref> As the war extended, Guevara led a new column of fighters dispatched westward for the final push towards [[Havana]]. In the closing days of December [[1958]], Guevara directed his "suicide squad" in the [[Battle of Santa Clara|attack on Santa Clara]], that became the final decisive military victory of the revolution.<ref>[[#refCastro1972|Castro 1972]], pp. 439–442.</ref><ref>[[#refDorschner1980|Dorschner 1980]], pp. 41–47, 81–87.</ref> Radio Rebelde broadcast the first reports that Guevara's column had [[Battle of Santa Clara|taken Santa Clara]] on New Years Eve 1958. This contradicted reports by the heavily controlled national news media, which had at one stage reported Guevara's death during the fighting. Batista, upon learning that his generals were negotiating a separate peace with the rebel leader, fled to the [[Dominican Republic]] the next day on [[January 1]], [[1959]].

On [[January 8]], [[1959]], Castro's army rolled victoriously into Havana.

During the rebellion against Batista's dictatorship, the general command of the rebel army, led by Fidel Castro, "introduced into the liberated territories the 19th-century penal law commonly known as the Ley de la Sierra".<ref>[[#refTreto1991|Gómez Treto 1991]], p. 115.  "The Penal Law of the War of Independence ([[July 28]], [[1896]]) was reinforced by Rule 1 of the Penal Regulations of the Rebel Army, approved in the Sierra Maestra [[February 21]], [[1958]], and published in the army's official bulletin (Ley penal de Cuba en armas, 1959)" ([[#refTreto1991|Gómez Treto 1991]], p. 123).</ref> "This law included the death penalty for extremely serious crimes, whether perpetrated by the dictatorship or by supporters of the revolution. In 1959, the revolutionary government extended its application to the whole of the republic and to war criminals captured and tried after the revolution. This latter extension, supported by the majority of the population, followed the same procedure as that seen in" the [[Nuremberg Trials]] held by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after [[World War II]].<ref>[[#refTreto1991|Gómez Treto 1991]], pp. 115&ndash;116).</ref> To implement this plan, Castro named Guevara commander of the [[La Cabaña Fortress]] prison, for a five-month tenure ([[January 2]] through [[June 12]], [[1959]]).<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 372, 425.</ref> Guevara was charged with purging the Batista army and consolidating victory by exacting "revolutionary justice" against traitors, ''chivatos'', and Batista's war criminals.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 376.</ref>  Serving in the post as "supreme prosecutor" on the appellate bench, Guevara oversaw the trials and executions of those convicted by revolutionary tribunal. Raúl Gómez Treto, senior legal advisor to the Cuban Ministry of Justice, considered removing restrictions on the death penalty to be justified in order to prevent citizens themselves from taking justice into their own hands.<ref>[[#refTreto1991|Gómez Treto 1991]], p. 116).</ref> 

It is estimated that several hundred people were executed on Guevara's orders during this time.<ref>Different sources cite different numbers of executions. [[#refAnderson1997|Anderson (1997)]] gives the number specifically at La Cabaña prison as fifty-five (p. 387.) while also stating that as a whole "several hundred people were officially tried and executed across Cuba" (p. 387.). This is supported by [[#refLago|Lago]] who gives the figure as 216 documented executions across Cuba in two years.</ref>

On [[June 12]], [[1959]], as soon as  Guevara returned to Havana, Castro sent him out on a three-month tour of fourteen countries, most of them [[Asian-African Conference|Bandung Pact]] members in Africa and Asia. Sending Guevara from Havana also allowed Castro to appear to be distancing himself from Guevara and his [[Marxist]] sympathies, that troubled both the United States and some of Castro's 26th of July Movement members.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 423.</ref> He spent twelve days in Japan (July 15&ndash;27), participating in negotiations aimed at expanding Cuba's trade relations with that nation. During this visit Guevara also secretly visited the city of [[Hiroshima]], where the American military had [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|detonated]] an [[Little Boy|atom-bomb]] fourteen years earlier. Guevara was "really shocked" at what he witnessed and by his visit to a hospital where A-bomb survivors were being treated.<ref>[[#refNiwata2007|Niwata 2007]].  Guevara requested that the Japanese government arrange for him to visit Hiroshima. When they refused, he covertly left his Osaka hotel to visit Hiroshima by night train, along with his aide Omar Fernández.</ref>

Upon returning to Cuba in September [[1959]], it was evident that Castro now had more political power. The government had begun land seizures included in the agrarian reform law, but was hedging on compensation offers to landowners, instead offering low interest "bonds", which put the [[U.S.]] on alert. At this point the affected wealthy cattlemen of [[Camagüey]] mounted a campaign against the land redistributions, and enlisted the newly disaffected rebel leader [[Huber Matos]], who along with the anti-Communist wing of the 26th of July Movement, joined them in denouncing the "Communist encroachment."<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 435.</ref> During this time [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] was offering assistance to the "Anti-Communist Legion of the Caribbean" who was training in the Dominican Republic. This multi-national force comprised mostly of [[Spaniards]] and Cubans, but also of [[Croatia]]ns, [[Germany|Germans]], [[Greece|Greeks]], and right-wing mercenaries, were plotting to topple Fidel Castro.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 435.</ref> 

These developments prompted Castro to further clean house of "counter-revolutionaries", and appoint Guevara chief official at the National Institute of Agrarian Reform INRA and later President of the National Bank of Cuba BNC, while allowing him to retain his military rank.<ref>Guevara was appointed Director of the Industrialization Department of the National Institute for Agrarian Reform on [[October 7]], [[1959]], and President of the National Bank of Cuba on [[November 26]], [[1959]].</ref>  At first glance it seemed a strange choice for the important position, Guevara had been promoting the creation of self-sufficient industries since his days in the Sierra Maestra. Guevara was expecting the U.S. to invade, and the Cuban population to then leave the cities and fight as guerrillas, although Guevara's hopes for armed uprisings elsewhere were failing.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 438&ndash;439.</ref> 

[[Image:Che-mao.jpg|thumb|left|200px|<small>Guevara being received in [[People's Republic of China|China]] by [[Chairman Mao]], at an official ceremony in the Government palace, November 1960.</small>]]

In 1960 Guevara provided first aid to victims when the freighter ''[[La Coubre explosion|La Coubre]]'', a French vessel carrying munitions from the port of Antwerp, exploded twice while it was being unloaded in Havana harbor, resulting in well over a hundred dead.<ref>[[#refCubanArchives|Cuban Information Archives]].</ref> It was at the memorial service for the victims of this explosion that [[Alberto Korda]] took the famous photograph now known as [[Che Guevara (photo)|''Guerrillero Heroico'']].

Guevara desired to see a diversification in Cuba’s economy, as well as an elimination of material incentives, in favor of moral ones. Guevara viewed capitalism as a “contest among wolves” where “one can only win at the cost of others”, and thus desired to see the creation of a “new man and woman”.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm Socialism and man in Cuba] by Che Guevara, March 1965</ref> An integral part of fostering a sense of “unity between the individual and the mass”, Guevara believed, was volunteer work and will. To display this, Guevara "led by example", working "endlessly at his ministry job, in construction, and even cutting sugar cane" on his day off.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/p_guevara.html PBS: Che Guevara, Popular but Ineffective]</ref> During this time he also wrote several publications advocating a replication of the Cuban revolutionary model, promoting small rural guerrilla groups (''[[foco theory]]'') as an alternative to massive armed insurrection.

Guevara did not participate in the fighting of the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], having been ordered by Castro to a secretly prearranged command post in Cuba's western [[Pinar del Río Province|Pinar del Río province]], where he fended off a decoy force.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 506.</ref> He suffered a bullet grazing to the cheek during this deployment, however, when his pistol fell out of its holster and accidentally discharged.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 507.</ref> In August 1961, during an economic conference of the [[Organization of American States]] in [[Punta del Este]], [[Uruguay]], Che Guevara sent a note of "gratitude" to U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] through [[Richard N. Goodwin]], a young secretary of the White House. It read "Thanks for Playa Girón (Bay of Pigs). Before the invasion, the revolution was shaky. Now it's stronger than ever."<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 509.</ref>

Guevara played a key role in bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear-armed [[ballistic missile]]s that precipitated the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962. During an interview with the British Communist newspaper The ''[[The Morning Star|Daily Worker]]'' a few weeks after the crisis, Guevara still fuming, stated that if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 545.</ref> Sam Russell, the British correspondent who spoke to Guevara at the time came away with "mixed feelings", calling him "a warm character" and "clearly a man of great intelligence", but "crackers from the way he went on about the missiles."<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 545.</ref>

In December 1964, Che Guevara traveled to New York City as head of the Cuban delegation to speak at the United Nations. He also appeared on the [[CBS]] Sunday news program ''[[Face the Nation]]''<ref>[[#refSnow2007|Snow 2007]].</ref> and met with a range of people from U.S. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]],<ref>[[#refHart2004|Hart 2004]], pg 271.</ref> to associates of [[Malcolm X]]. Malcolm X expressed his admiration, by declaring Guevara "one of the most revolutionary men in this country right now", while reading a statement from Guevara to a crowd at the [[Audubon Ballroom]].<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 618.</ref> 

On [[December 17]], Guevara left for [[Paris]] and embarked on a three-month tour that included the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[United Arab Republic]] ([[Egypt]]), [[Algeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Benin|Dahomey]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]] and [[Tanzania]], with stops in [[Ireland]] and [[Prague]]. In [[Algiers]] on [[February 24]], [[1965]], he made what turned out to be his last public appearance on the international stage when he delivered a speech at an economic seminar on Afro-Asian solidarity.<ref>[[#refGuevara1969|Guevara 1969]], p. 350.</ref> He specified the moral duty of the socialist countries, accusing them of tacit complicity with the exploiting Western countries. He proceeded to outline a number of measures which he said the communist-bloc countries must implement in order to accomplish the defeat of imperialism.<ref>[[#refGuevara1969|Guevara 1969]], pp. 352&ndash;59.</ref> Having criticized the [[Soviet Union]] (the primary financial backer of Cuba) in such a public manner, he returned to Cuba on [[March 14]] to a solemn reception by Fidel and Raúl Castro, Osvaldo Dorticós and Carlos Rafael Rodríguez at the Havana airport.

Two weeks later, in 1965 Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished altogether. His whereabouts were a great mystery in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself. His disappearance was variously attributed to the failure of the [[industrialization]] scheme he had advocated while minister of industry, to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials disapproving of Guevara's pro-[[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] stance on the [[Sino-Soviet split]], and to serious differences between Guevara and the pragmatic Castro regarding Cuba's economic development and ideological line. Castro had grown increasingly wary of Guevara's popularity and considered him a potential threat. Castro's critics sometimes say his explanations for Guevara's disappearance have always been suspect. 
[[Image:CheinMoscow.jpg|thumb|left|150px|<small>Walking through [[Red Square]] in [[Moscow]], November 1964</small> ]]
The coincidence of Guevara's views with those expounded by the Chinese Communist leadership was increasingly problematic for Cuba as the nation's economy became more and more dependent on the Soviet Union. Since the early days of the Cuban revolution, Guevara had been considered by many an advocate of [[Maoism|Maoist]] strategy in Latin America and the originator of a plan for the rapid industrialization of Cuba which was frequently compared to China's "[[Great Leap Forward]]". According to Western observers of the Cuban situation, the fact that Guevara was opposed to Soviet conditions and recommendations that Castro pragmatically saw as necessary, may have been the reason for his disappearance. However, both Guevara and Castro were supportive publicly on the idea of a united front.

Following the Cuban Missile Crisis and what Guevara perceived as a Soviet betrayal when [[Khrushchev]] withdrew the missiles from Cuban territory, Guevara had grown more skeptical of the Soviet Union. As revealed in his last speech in Algiers, he had come to view the [[Northern Hemisphere]], led by the U.S. in the West and the Soviet Union in the East, as the exploiter of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. He strongly supported Communist [[North Vietnam]] in the [[Vietnam War]], and urged the peoples of other developing countries to take up arms and create "many Vietnams".<ref>[[#refGuevara1967a|Guevara 1967a]], p. ???.</ref>

Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara's fate, Castro stated on [[June 16]], [[1965]] that the people would be informed when Guevara himself wished to let them know. Still, rumors spread both inside and outside Cuba. On [[October 3]] of that year, Castro revealed an undated letter purportedly written to him by Guevara some months earlier: in it, Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution, but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight for the revolutionary cause abroad. Additionally, he resigned from all his positions in the government and party, and renounced his honorary Cuban citizenship.<ref>[[#refGuevara1965|Guevara 1965]].</ref> Guevara's movements continued to be a closely guarded secret for the next two years.

In 1965 Guevara decided to venture to West Africa and offer his knowledge and experience as a guerrilla to the ongoing [[Congo Crisis|conflict in the Congo]]. According to Algerian President [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], Guevara thought that Africa was imperialism's weak link and therefore had enormous revolutionary potential.<ref>[[#refBenBella1997|Ben Bella 1997]].</ref> Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] who had fraternal relations with Che dating back to his 1959 visit, saw Guevara's plans to fight in the Congo as "unwise" and warned that he would become a "[[Tarzan|Tarzan]]" figure, doomed to failure.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 624.</ref> Despite the warning, Guevara led the Cuban operation in support of the Marxist Simba movement, which had emerged from the ongoing [[Congo Crisis]]. Guevara, his second-in-command [[Victor Dreke]], and twelve other Cuban expeditionaries arrived in the Congo on [[April 24]], [[1965]] with a contingent of approximately 100 [[Afro-Cuban]]s joining them soon afterward.<ref>[[#refGalvez1999|Gálvez 1999]], p 62.</ref><ref>[[#refGott2004|Gott 2004]] p. 219.</ref> They collaborated for a time with guerrilla leader [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], who had previously helped supporters of the slain [[Patrice Lumumba]] lead an unsuccessful revolt months earlier. Disillusioned with the discipline of Kabila's troops, Guevara would dismiss him, stating "nothing leads me to believe he is the man of the hour."<ref>[[#refBBCNews2001a|BBC News January 17, 2001]].</ref>

South African mercenaries, led by [[Mike Hoare]] in concert with Cuban exiles and the CIA, worked with the Congolese army to thwart Guevara. They were able to monitor his communications, and so pre-empted his attacks and interdicted his supply lines. Despite the fact that Guevara sought to conceal his presence in the Congo, the U.S. government was aware of his location and activities: The [[National Security Agency]] was intercepting all of his incoming and outgoing transmissions via equipment aboard the ''USNS Valdez'', a floating listening post which continuously cruised the Indian Ocean off [[Dar es Salaam]] for that purpose.<ref>"The intercept operators knew that Dar-es-Salaam was serving as a communications center for the fighters, receiving messages from Castro in Cuba and relaying them on to the guerrillas deep in the bush<!--Is this all a quotation?--> ([[#refBamford2002|Bamford 2002]], p. 181).</ref>

Guevara's aim was to export the Cuban Revolution by instructing local Simba fighters in [[Marxist]] ideology and [[foco theory]] strategies of [[guerrilla warfare]]. In his ''Congo Diary'', he cites the incompetence, intransigence and infighting of the local Congolese forces as key reasons for the revolt's failure.<ref>[[#refIrelandsOwn2000|Ireland's Own 2000]].</ref> Later that year, ill with [[dysentery]], suffering from asthma, and disheartened after seven months of frustrations, Guevara left the Congo with the Cuban survivors. (Six members of his column had died.) At one point Guevara considered sending the wounded back to Cuba, and fighting alone until the end in the Congo, as a revolutionary example; however, after being urged by his comrades and pressed by two emissaries sent by Castro, at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to retreat. A few weeks later, when writing the preface to the diary he kept during the Congo venture, he began: "This is the history of a failure."<ref>[[#refGuevara2000|Guevara 2000]], p. 1.</ref>

Guevara was reluctant to return to Cuba, because Castro had made public Guevara's "farewell letter" &mdash;a letter intended to only be revealed in the case of his death&mdash;wherein he severed all ties in order to devote himself to revolution throughout the world.<ref>[[#refCastaneda1998|Castañeda 1998]], p. 316.</ref> As a result, Guevara spent the next six months living clandestinely in Dar es Salaam and Prague. During this time he compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience, and wrote drafts of two more books, one on philosophy and the other on economics. He also visited several Western European countries to test his new new false identity papers, created by [[Intelligence Directorate|Cuban Intelligence]] for his later travels to South America. Throughout this period Castro continued to importune his return to Cuba, but Guevara only agreed to do so under the basis of preparing a revolutionary effort somewhere in Latin America, and that his presence on the island would be secret.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

==Bolivia==
[[Image:CheinBolivia1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|<small>In rural [[Bolivia]] shortly before his death, 1967.</small> ]] 
Guevara's location was still not public knowledge.  Representatives of [[Mozambique]]'s independence movement, the  [[FRELIMO]], reported that they met with Guevara in late 1966 or early 1967 in Dar es Salaam regarding his offer to aid in their revolutionary project, which they ultimately rejected.<ref>[[#refMittleman1981|Mittleman 1981]], p. 38.</ref> In a speech at the 1967 [[May Day]] rally in Havana, the Acting Minister of the armed forces, Major [[Juan Almeida]], announced that Guevara was "serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America". The persistent reports that he was leading the guerrillas in Bolivia were eventually shown to be true.

At Castro's behest, a parcel of jungle land in the remote Ñancahuazú region had been purchased by native Bolivian Communists for Guevara to use as a training area and base camp. 

Training at this camp in the Ñancahuazú valley proved to be more hazardous than combat to Guevara and the Cubans accompanying him. Little was accomplished in the way of building a guerrilla army. Former [[Stasi]] operative [[Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider]], better known by her ''[[nom de guerre]]'' "Tania", who had been installed as his primary agent in [[La Paz]], was reportedly also working for the [[KGB]] and is widely inferred to have unwittingly served Soviet interests by leading Bolivian authorities to Guevara's trail.<ref>[[#refSelvage1985|Selvage 1985]].</ref><ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 693.</ref>

[[Image:Vallegrande location.png|thumb||160px|right|<small>Map of Bolivia showing location of [[Vallegrande]].</small> ]]
Guevara's guerrilla force, numbering about 50 and operating as the ELN (''Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Bolivia''; "[[National Liberation Army of Bolivia]]"), was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian regulars in the difficult terrain of the mountainous [[Camiri]] region. In September, however, the Army managed to eliminate two guerrilla groups in a violent battle, reportedly killing one of the leaders. 

Guevara's plan for fomenting revolution in Bolivia appears to have been unsuccessful because it was based upon three primary misconceptions:
*He had expected to deal only with the Bolivian military, who were poorly trained and equipped. However, Guevara was unaware that the U.S. government had sent the CIA and other operatives into Bolivia to aid the anti-insurrection effort. The Bolivian Army would also be trained, advised, and supplied by [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] including a recently organized elite battalion of [[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]] trained in [[jungle warfare]] that set up camp in [[La Esperanza]], a small settlement close to the location of Guevara's guerrillas.<ref>[[#refUSArmy1967|U.S. Army 1967]] and [[#refRyan1998|Ryan 1998]], pp. 82–102, ''inter alia''.  "U.S. military personnel in Bolivia never exceeded 53 advisors, including a sixteen-man Mobile Training Team (MTT) from the [[8th Special Forces Group]] based at Fort Gulick, Panama Canal Zone" ([[#refSelvage1985|Selvage 1985]]).</ref>

*Guevara had expected assistance and cooperation from the local dissidents which he did not receive, nor did he receive support from Bolivia's Communist Party, under the leadership of [[Mario Monje]], which was oriented toward Moscow rather than Havana.
*He had expected to remain in radio contact with Havana. However, the two shortwave transmitters provided to him by Cuba were faulty; thus the guerrillas were unable to communicate with and be resupplied, leaving them isolated and stranded.

In addition, Guevara's known preference for confrontation rather than compromise, which had previously surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba, contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local leaders in Bolivia, just as it had in the Congo.<ref>[[#refGuevara1972|Guevara 1972]].</ref> This tendency had existed in Cuba, but had been kept in check by the timely interventions and guidance of Fidel Castro.<ref>[[#refCastaneda1998|Castañeda 1998]], pp. 107–112; 131–132.</ref>

[[Félix Rodríguez (Central Intelligence Agency)|Félix Rodríguez]], a [[CIA]] operative, claims that he headed the hunt for Guevara in Bolivia.<ref>[[#refRodriguez1989|Rodríguez 1989]], p. ??.</ref> On [[October 7]], an informant apprised the Bolivian Special Forces of the location of Guevara's guerrilla encampment in the Yuro ravine. They encircled the area, and Guevara was wounded and taken prisoner while leading a detachment with [[Simeón Cuba Sarabia]]. Che biographer [[Jon Lee Anderson]] reports Bolivian Sergeant Bernardino Huanca's account: that a twice wounded Guevara, his gun rendered useless, shouted "Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead."<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p.733.</ref> 

Guevara was tied up and taken to a dilapidated schoolhouse in the nearby village of [[La Higuera]]. Early on October 9, the day after his capture, [[René Barrientos|Barrientos]] ordered that he be killed. The executioner was [[Mario Terán]], a sergeant in the Bolivian army who had drawn a short straw after arguments over who would get the honor of shooting Guevara broke out among the soldiers. To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the story the government planned to release to the public, Félix Rodríguez ordered Terán to aim carefully to make it appear that Guevara had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army.<ref>[[#refGrant2007|Grant 2007]].  René Barrientos has never revealed his motives for ordering the summary execution of Guevara.</ref> 

Moments before Guevara was executed he was asked if he was thinking about his own immortality. "No," he replied, "I'm thinking about the immortality of the revolution."<ref>[[#refTime1970|Time Magazine 1970]].</ref> Che Guevara also allegedly said to his executioner, "I know you've come to kill me. Shoot, coward, you are only going to kill a man."<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 739.</ref> Terán hesitated, then pulled the trigger of his semiautomatic rifle, hitting Guevara in the arms and legs. Guevara writhed on the ground, apparently biting one of his wrists to avoid crying out. Terán shot him again, this time hitting him fatally in the chest &ndash; at 1:10 pm, according to Rodríguez.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 739.</ref>

His body was then lashed to the landing skids of a helicopter and flown to nearby [[Vallegrande]] where photographs were taken, showing a figure described by some as "Christ-like" lying on a concrete slab in the laundry room of the Nuestra Señora de Malta hospital.<ref>[[#refAlmudevar2007|Almudevar 2007]] and [[#refGott2005|Gott 2005]].</ref>

A declassified memorandum dated [[October 11]], [[1967]] to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] from his senior adviser, [[Walt Rostow]], called the decision to kill Guevara “stupid” but “understandable from a Bolivian standpoint.”<ref>[[#refLacey2007a|Lacey 2007a]].</ref> After the execution, Rodríguez took several of Guevara's personal items, including a watch which he continued to wear many years later, often showing them to reporters during the ensuing years.<ref>After the Cuban revolution, seeing that Guevara had no watch, his friend Oscarito Fernández Mell gave him his own gold watch. Sometime later, Che handed him a piece of paper; a receipt from the National Bank declaring that Mell had "donated" his gold wristband to Cuba's gold reserve. Guevara was still wearing his watch, but it now had a leather wristband ([[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 503).</ref> Today, some of these belongings, including his flashlight, are on display at the CIA.<ref>[[#refKornbluh1997|Kornbluh 1997]].</ref> After a military doctor amputated his hands, Bolivian army officers transferred Guevara's cadaver to an undisclosed location and refused to reveal whether his remains had been buried or cremated.

On [[October 15]], Castro acknowledged that Guevara was dead and proclaimed three days of public mourning throughout the island.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 740.</ref>  On October 18, Castro addressed a crowd of almost one million people in Havana and spoke about Guevara's character as a revolutionary.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 741.</ref>

[[Image:Che Guevara - Grab in Santa Clara, Kuba.jpg|thumb|200px|left|<small>Che Guevara's Monument and Mausoleum in Santa Clara, Cuba.</small>]]

While researching his biography ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', author [[Jon Lee Anderson]] happened to discover the hidden location of Guevara's burial. Thus in 1997, the skeletal remains of a handless body were exhumed from beneath an air strip near Vallegrande, identified as those of Guevara by a Cuban forensic team at the scene, and returned to Cuba. On [[October 17]], [[1997]], his remains, with those of six of his fellow combatants, were laid to rest with military honours in a specially built mausoleum in the city of Santa Clara, where he had won the decisive battle of the Cuban Revolution.<ref>On [[December 30]], [[1998]] the remains of ten more guerrillas who had fought alongside Guevara in Bolivia and whose secret burial sites had been recently discovered by Cuban forensic investigators were placed inside the "Che Guevara Mausoleum" in Santa Clara.</ref>{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Also removed when Guevara was captured was his diary, which documented events of the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia.<ref>[[#refGuevara1967b|Guevara 1967b]].</ref> The first entry is on [[November 7]], [[1966]] shortly after his arrival at the farm in Ñancahuazú, and the last is dated [[October 7]], [[1967]], the day before his capture. The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely due to discovery by the Bolivian Army, explains Guevara's decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to re-establish contact, and describes their overall unsuccessful venture. It also records the rift between Guevara and the Bolivian Communist Party that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally expected and shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace, due in part to the fact that the guerrilla group had learned [[Quechua]], unaware that the local language was actually [[Tupí-Guaraní]].{{Fact|date=April 2008}} As the campaign drew to an unexpected close, Guevara became increasingly ill. He suffered from ever-worsening bouts of asthma, and most of his last offensives were carried out in an attempt to obtain medicine.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

The Bolivian Diary was quickly and crudely translated by ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine and circulated around the world.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} There are at least four additional diaries in existence&mdash;those of Israel Reyes Zayas (Alias "Braulio"), Harry Villegas Tamayo ("Pombo"), Eliseo Reyes Rodriguez ("Rolando")<ref>[[#refSelvage1985|Selvage 1985]].</ref> and Dariel Alarcón Ramírez ("Benigno")<ref>[[#refRamirez1997|Ramírez 1997]].</ref>&mdash;each of which reveals additional aspects of the events.

Forty years after his execution, Che's life and deeds still remain a contentious issue.

Some view Che Guevara as a hero,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/20/magazine/20bolivia.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin Che's Second Coming?] by David Rieff, November 20 2005, New York Times</ref> for example [[Nelson Mandela]] referred to him as "an inspiration for every human being who loves freedom" while [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] described him as "not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age."<ref>[[#refMoynihan2006|Moynihan 2006]].</ref> Guevara remains a beloved national hero to many in Cuba, where his image adorns the 3 $ [[Cuban Peso]] and school children begin each morning by pledging "We will be like Che."<ref>[[#refPeoplesWeekly2004|People's Weekly 2004]].</ref> In his native homeland of Argentina, where high schools bear his name,<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN1446436420080614?sp=true Argentina pays belated homage to "Che" Guevara] by Helen Popper, Reuters, June 14 2008</ref> numerous Che museums dot the country which in 2008 unveiled a 12 foot bronze statue of him in his birth city of [[Rosario]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7455196.stm Statue for Che's '80th birthday'] by Daniel Schweimler, BBC News, June 15 2008</ref> Additionally, Guevara has been [[Sanctification|sanctified]] by some Bolivian [[campesinos]] as "Saint Ernesto", whom they pray to for assistance <ref>[[#refSchipani2007|Schipani 2007]].</ref> 

Conversely, others view him as a spokesman for a failed ideology and as a ruthless executioner. [[Johann Hari]], for example, writes that "Che Guevara is not a free-floating icon of rebellion. He was an actual person who supported an actual system of tyranny."<ref>[[#refHari2007|Hari 2007]].</ref> Detractors have also theorized that in much of Latin America, Che-inspired revolutions had the practical result of reinforcing brutal militarism for many years.<ref>[[#refLlosa2005|Vargas Llosa 2005]].</ref> He also remains a hated figure amongst many in the [[Cuban exile]] community, who view him with animosity as "the butcher of La Cabaña."<ref>[[#refDRivera2005|D'Rivera 2005]].</ref>

Moreover, Guevara has [[ironically]] been subsumed by the capitalist consumer culture he despised. The primary variable of this phenomenon has been a [[monochrome]] graphic of his face, which has become one of the World's most universally [[Merchandising|merchandized]] images,<ref>[[#refBBCNews2001b|BBC News May 26, 2001]].</ref> found on an endless array of items including: t-shirts, hats, posters, tattoos, and even bikinis.<ref>[[#refLacey2007b|Lacey 2007b]].</ref> Yet, Guevara also remains an iconic figure both in specifically political contexts<ref>[[#refBBCNews2007|BBC News 2007]].</ref> and as a wide-ranging popular icon of youthful rebellion.<ref name=myth>[[#refOHagan2004|O'Hagan 2004]].</ref>
