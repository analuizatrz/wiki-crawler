'''"Glycerine"''' is a [[1995]] single by the rock band [[Bush (band)|Bush]] from their debut album ''[[Sixteen Stone]]''.

The video for Glycerine was notable for being shot in a very short time period when the band was on tour in the United States.  The video was shot so quickly because the band's visas had expired.  In spite of being very simple and unadorned, the video was highly acclaimed and won several awards, including the [[MTV Video Music Award - Viewer's Choice]] from the 1996 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

The song is also well known for being performed live during a heavy storm at the 1996 MTV Spring Break. 

Glycerine is also featured on [[Buzz Ballads]] soundtrack, offered by musicspace.com (2006).

Glycerine came 5th in Australia's Triple J Hottest 100 in 1996.

The song was also featured in the season 4 premiere of CBS's [[Cold Case]] entitled "Rampage".
