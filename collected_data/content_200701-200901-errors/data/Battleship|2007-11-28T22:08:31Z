A '''battleship''' is a large, heavily [[armour|armored]] [[warship]] with a main [[artillery battery|battery]] consisting of the largest [[calibre]] of [[gun]]s. Battleships are larger, better-armed and better-armored than [[cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s.

Battleship design continually evolved to incorporate and adapt technological advances to maintain an edge. The word ''battleship'' was coined around 1794 and is a shortened form of ''[[ship of the line|line-of-battle ship]]'', the dominant warship in the [[Age of Sail]].<ref name ="OED">"battleship" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 4 Apr. 2000</ref> The term came into formal use in the late 1880s to describe a type of [[ironclad warship]],<ref name = "Stoll">Stoll, J. ''Steaming in the Dark?'', Journal of Conflict Resolution Vol. 36 No. 2, Jun 1992</ref> whose design culminated in the 1890s with the generation of ships now known as [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s.  In 1906, [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] heralded a revolution in battleship design, and for many years modern battleships were referred to as [[dreadnought]]s.

Battleships were a potent symbol of [[navy|naval]] dominance and national might, and for decades, the battleship was a major factor in both [[diplomacy]] and [[military strategy]].<ref name = "Sondhaus">Sondhaus, L. ''Naval Warfare 1815–1914'', ISBN 0-415-21478-5</ref>  The global [[arms race]] in battleship construction in the early 20th century was one of the causes of [[World War I]], which saw a clash of huge battle fleets at the [[Battle of Jutland]]. The [[Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament|Naval Treaties]] of the 1920s and 1930s limited the number of battleships but did not end the evolution of design. Both the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis Powers]] deployed battleships of old construction and new during [[World War II]].

Nevertheless, some historians and naval theorists question the value of the dreadnought.<ref>O'Connell, Robert L ''Sacred Vessels, the Cult of the Battleship and the Rise of the US Navy'', pub Westview Press, 1991 ISBN 0-8133-11116-0 </ref> Apart from Jutland, there were few great dreadnought clashes. Despite their great firepower and protection, dreadnoughts remained vulnerable to much smaller, cheaper ordnance and craft: initially the [[torpedo]] and the [[naval mine]], and later [[aircraft]] and the [[guided missile]].<ref name = "Lenton">Lenton, H. T.: ''Krigsfartyg efter 1860''</ref> The growing range of engagement led to the battleship's replacement as the leading type of warship by the [[aircraft carrier]] during World War II; battleships were retained by the [[United States Navy]] into the [[Cold War]] only for [[fire support]] purposes. These last battleships were removed from the U.S. [[Naval Vessel Register]] in March 2006.

==The ship of the line==
A [[ship of the line]] was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship on which was mounted a [[artillery battery|battery]] of up to 120 [[smoothbore]] [[gun]]s and [[carronade]]s. The ship of the line was a gradual evolution of a basic design that dates back to the 1400s, and apart from growing in size it changed little between the adoption of [[line of battle]] tactics in the early 17th century and the end of the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.<ref name = "OED" />
[[Image:TheNapoleonAtToulonIn1852ByLauvergne.jpg|thumb|''[[Le Napoléon (1850)|Le Napoléon]]'' (1850), the first steam battleship]]
The sheer number of guns fired [[broadside]] meant that a sailing battleship could wreck any wooden vessel, smashing its [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] and [[mast (sailing)|masts]] and killing its crew. However, the effective range of the guns was as little as a few hundred yards, and the battle tactics of sailing ships depended entirely on the wind.

The first major change to the ship of the line concept was the introduction of [[steam power]] as an auxiliary [[marine propulsion|propulsion system]]. Steam power was gradually introduced to the navy in the first half of the 19th century, initially for small craft and later for [[frigate]]s. The [[French Navy]] introduced steam to the line of battle with the 90-gun [[Le Napoléon (1850)|''Le Napoléon'']] in 1850<ref>"Napoleon (90 guns), the first purpose-designed screw line of battleships", ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship (p39)</ref> &mdash; the first true steam battleship.<ref>''"Hastened to completion Le Napoleon was launched on 16 May 1850, to become the world's first true steam battleship"'', ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship (p39)</ref> ''Napoleon'' was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of {{convert|12|knot|km/h|0}}, regardless of the wind conditions: a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement. The introduction of steam accelerated the growth in size of battleships. France and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] were the only two countries to develop fleets of wooden steam screw battleships, although several other navies made some use of a mixture of screw battleships and paddle-steamer frigates. These included [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]], [[Sweden]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Denmark]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]].<ref name ="Sondhaus"/>

==Ironclads==
{{main|Ironclad warship}}
[[Image:LaGloirePhotograph.jpg|thumb|The French [[French battleship La Gloire|''La Gloire'']] (1859), the first ocean&ndash;going [[ironclad]] warship.]]
The adoption of steam power was only one of a number of technological advances which revolutionized warship design in the 19th century. The ship of the line was overtaken by the [[ironclad warship|ironclad]]: powered by steam, protected by metal armor, and armed with guns firing high-explosive [[shell (projectile)|shells]]. 

====Explosive shells====
Wooden-hulled ships stood up comparatively well to solid [[lead shot|shot]], as shown in the 1866 [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|battle of Lissa]], where the old Austrian steam battleship ''Kaiser'' ranged across a confused battlefield, rammed an [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] ironclad and took a pounding of several 300&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|pound]] shots at point blank range. Despite losing her [[bowsprit]] and her foremast, and being set on fire, she was ready for action again the very next day.<ref name="Wilson">Wilson, H. W.: ''Ironclads in Action - Vol 1'', London, 1898, p. 240</ref> By contrast, guns which fired explosive or incendiary shells were a major threat to wooden ships, and these weapons became widespread in the 1840s. In the [[Crimean War]], the [[Russian Black Sea Fleet]] destroyed a flotilla of wooden Turkish ships with explosive shells at the [[Battle of Sinop]] in 1853. Later in the war, French ironclad floating batteries used similar weapons against the defenses at the [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)]].<ref name = "Lambert">Lambert, Andrew: ''Battleships in Transition'', pp. 92–96</ref>

====Iron armor and construction====
[[Image:Hms warrior.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS ''Warrior'' (1860)]], the Royal Navy's first ocean&ndash;going ironclad warship.]]
The development of high-explosive shells made the use of iron [[armour|armor]] plate on warships necessary. In 1859 [[France]] launched [[FS Gloire (1858-1883)|''La Gloire'']], the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She had the profile of a ship of the line, cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most of her journeys, ''La Gloire'' was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor.<ref>Gibbons, Tony: ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Battleships'', pp. 28–29</ref> ''Gloire'' prompted further innovation from the [[Royal Navy]], anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead. 

The superior armored frigate [[HMS Warrior (1860)|''Warrior'']] followed ''La Gloire'' by only fourteen months, and both nations embarked on a program of building new ironclads and converting existing screw ships of the line to armored frigates.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 30–31</ref> Within two years, Italy, Austria, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and Russia had all ordered ironclad warships, and by the time of the famous clash of the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] and the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] at the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] at least eight navies possessed ironclad ships.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/>
[[Image:LeRedoutablePhoto.jpg|thumb|The French [[French battleship Redoutable (1876)|''Redoutable]] (1876), the first battleship to use steel as the main building material<ref>Gibbons, p. 93</ref>]]

Navies experimented with the positioning of guns, in [[Gun Turret|turret]]s (like the USS ''Monitor''), [[centre-battery|centre-batteries]] or [[barbette]]s, or with the [[naval ram|ram]] as the principal weapon. As steam technology developed, masts were gradually removed from battleship designs. By the mid-1870s steel was used as a construction material alongside iron and wood. The French Navy's [[French battleship Redoutable (1876)|''Redoutable'']], laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876, was a central [[artillery battery|battery]] and barbette warship which became the first battleship in the world to use steel as the principal building material.<ref>Conway Marine, "Steam, Steel and Shellfire" (p. 96)</ref>

==The pre-dreadnought battleship==

[[Image:HMS Agamemnon (1908) profile drawing.png|thumb|Diagram of [[HMS Agamemnon (1906)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']], a typical late pre-dreadnought battleship]]

By the 1890s, there was an increasing similarity between battleship designs, and the type now known as the 'pre-dreadnought battleship' emerged. These were heavily armored ships, mounting a mixed battery of guns in turrets, and without sails. The typical first-class battleship of the pre-dreadnought era displaced 15,000 to 17,000&nbsp;[[ton]]s, had a speed of {{convert|16|knot|km/h|0}}, and an armament of four {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns in two turrets fore and aft with a mixed-caliber secondary battery amidships around the superstructure.<ref name = "Stoll"/> An early design with superficial similarity to the pre-dreadnought is the British [[Devastation class battleship|''Devastation''-class]] of 1871.<ref>Gibbons, Tony: ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Battleships'', p. 101</ref> However, it was not until the 1890s that the widespread adoption of steel construction and hardened steel armor meant that a turret-ship could combine heavy armament and protection with high speed and good seakeeping.

The slow-firing {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} main guns were the principal weapons for battleship-to-battleship combat. The intermediate and secondary batteries had two roles. Against major ships, it was thought a 'hail of fire' from quick-firing secondary weapons could distract enemy gun crews by inflicting damage to the superstructure, and they would be more effective against smaller ships such as [[cruiser]]s. Smaller guns (12-pounders and smaller) were reserved for protecting the battleship against the threat of torpedo attack from [[destroyer]]s and [[torpedo boat]]s.<ref>War at Sea in the Ironclad Age, Richard Hill, ISBN 0-304-35273-X</ref>

The beginning of the pre-dreadnought era coincided with an attempt by Britain to re-assert her naval dominance. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted. Expensive naval projects were criticised by political leaders of all inclinations.<ref name = "Sondhaus"/> However, in 1888 a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain's navy should be more powerful than the two next most powerful fleets combined was also enshrined. This policy was designed to deter France and Russia from building more battleships, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with more and better pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.<ref name = "Sondhaus"/>

In the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th, the escalation in the building of battleships became defined by conflict between Britain and [[German Empire|Germany]]. The German naval laws of 1890 and 1898 authorised a fleet of 38 battleships, a vital threat to the balance of naval power.<ref name = "Sondhaus"/> Britain answered with further shipbuilding, but by the end of the pre-dreadnought era, British supremacy at sea had markedly weakened. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, twice as many as France and almost as many as the rest of the world put together. By 1897, Britain's lead was far smaller due to competition from France, Germany, and Russia, as well as the development of pre-dreadnought fleets in Italy, the [[United States]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].<ref>Kennedy, p. 209</ref> Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, [[Norway]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]] all had second-rate fleets led by [[armored cruiser]]s, [[panzership|coast service battleship]]s or [[monitor (warship)|monitors]].<ref>Preston, Anthony: ''Jane's Fighting Ships of World War II''</ref> 

Pre-dreadnoughts continued the technical innovations of the ironclad. Turrets, armor plate, and [[steam engine]]s were all improved over the years, and [[torpedo]] tubes were introduced. A small number of designs, including the American [[Kearsarge class battleship|''Kearsarge'']] and [[Virginia class battleship|''Virginia'']] classes, experimented with all or part of the 8-inch intermediate battery superimposed over the 12-inch primary. Results were poor: recoil factors and blast effects resulted in the 8-inch battery being completely unusable, and the inability to train the primary and intermediate armaments on different targets led to significant tactical limitations. Even though such innovative designs saved weight (a key reason for their inception), they proved too cumbersome in practice.<ref>Preston, Anthony. (1972) ''Battleships of World War I'', New York City: Galahad Books</ref>

==The Dreadnought era==
{{main|Dreadnought}}
In 1906, the revolutionary [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']], created as a result of pressure from Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John A. Fisher]], made existing battleships obsolete. Combining an 'all-big-gun' armament of ten 12-inch (305[[millimetre|mm]]) rifles with unprecedented speed and protection, she prompted navies worldwide to re-evaluate their battleship building programmes. While the concept of an all-big-gun ship had been in circulation for several years, and the Japanese had even laid down an all-big-gun battleship, the ''Satsuma'', in 1904,<ref>Gibbons, p.168</ref> ''Dreadnought'' sparked a new [[arms race]], principally between Britain and Germany but reflected worldwide, as the new class of warships became a crucial element of national power.

Technical development continued rapidly through the dreadnought era, with step changes in armament, armor and propulsion. Ten years after ''Dreadnought'''s commissioning, much more powerful ships, the '''super-dreadnoughts''', were being built.

===The origin of ''Dreadnought''===
[[Image:Vittoriocuniberti001.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Vittorio Cuniberti]]
[[Image:IJN Satsuma.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese battleship Satsuma|''Satsuma'']], the first ship to be designed and laid down as an "'all-big-gun" battleship; she was also the largest battleship in the world at the time of her launch.]]

In the first years of the 20th century, several navies worldwide experimented with the idea of a new type of battleship with a uniform armament of very heavy guns.

General [[Vittorio Cuniberti]], the Italian Navy's chief naval architect, articulated the concept of an all-big-gun battleship in 1903. When the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' did not pursue his ideas, Cuniberti wrote an article in [[Jane's Fighting Ships|''Jane's'']] proposing an "ideal" future British battleship, a large armored warship of 17,000&nbsp;tons, armed solely with a single caliber main battery (twelve 12-inch {305 mm} guns), carrying {{convert|300|mm|in|0|sing=on}} [[belt armor]], and capable of 24 [[knot (speed)|knot]]s (44 km/h).<ref>Cuniberti, Vittorio, "An Ideal Battleship for the British Fleet", ''All The World’s Fighting Ships'', 1903, pp.407–409.</ref>

The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s battleship [[Japanese battleship Satsuma|''Satsuma'']] was the first ship in the world designed (1904) and laid down (1905) as an all-big-gun battleship, although she was never armed up to specification due to shortages of the British 12-inch [[Armstrong Gun|Armstrong gun]]s. ''Satsuma'' retained triple-expansion engines, though her sister ship [[Japanese battleship Aki|''Aki'']], completed in 1911, used turbines.

An American design, [[USS South Carolina (BB-26)|''South Carolina'']], authorized in 1905, also makes the claim for "first dreadnought", but she and her sister, ''[[USS Michigan (BB-27)|Michigan]]'', were not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines, but had superior layout of their main battery, dispensing with <i>Dreadnought</i>'s wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.
[[Image:Jackie Fisher.jpg|thumbnail|upright|[[Jackie Fisher]]]]

The [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905) provided operational experience to validate the 'all-big-gun' concept. At the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]] and the [[Battle of Tsushima]], pre-Dreadnought fleets exchanged 12-inch volleys at ranges of 7,600–12,000 [[yard|yd]] (7 to 11&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]), beyond the range of the secondary batteries. It is often held that these engagements demonstrated the importance of the {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} gun over its smaller counterparts, though some historians take the view that secondary batteries of the pre-dreadnoughts were just as decisive as the larger weapons.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/> None of this was lost on [[First Sea Lord]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Sir John A. "Jackie" Fisher]]. As early as 1904, Fisher had been convinced of the need for fast, powerful ships with an all-big-gun armament. If Tsushima influenced his thinking, it was to persuade him of the need to standardise on {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/> Fisher's concern was [[submarine]]s and [[destroyer]]s equipped with torpedoes that outranged battleship guns, making speed imperative for [[capital ship]]s.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/> Fisher's preferred option was his brainchild, the [[battlecruiser]]: lightly armored but heavily armed with eight {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns and propelled to a remarkable {{convert|25|knot|km/h|0}} by [[steam turbine]]s.
[[Image:HMS Dreadnought (1911) profile drawing.png|thumb|[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']]|left]]

It was to prove this revolutionary technology that ''Dreadnought'' was laid down in 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns, had an 11-inch armour belt, and was the first large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centreline (one forward, two aft) and two on the [[wing turrets|wings]], giving her at her launch twice the [[broadside]] of anything else afloat. She retained a number of 12-pounder (3-inch/76 mm) [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy enough for her to go head-to-head with any other ship afloat in a gun battle, and conceivably win.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 170–171</ref>

''Dreadnought'' was to have been followed by three [[Invincible class battlecruiser|''Invincible'']]-class battlecruisers, their construction delayed to allow lessons from ''Dreadnought'' to be used in their design. While Fisher may have intended ''Dreadnought'' to be the last Royal Navy battleship,<ref name ="Sondhaus"/> the design was so successful he found little support for his plan to switch to a battlecruiser navy. Although there were some problems with the ship (the wing turrets strained the hull when firing a full broadside, and the top of the thickest armor belt lay below the waterline at full load), the Royal Navy promptly commissioned another six ships to a similar design in the ''[[Bellerophon class battleship|Bellerophon]]'' and ''[[St. Vincent class battleship|St Vincent]]'' classes.

===The dreadnought arms race===
In 1897, before the revolution in design brought about by ''Dreadnought'', the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building, a lead of 26 over France and of 50 over Germany.<ref>''The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery'', Paul M. Kennedy, ISBN 0-333-35094-4, p. 209</ref> In 1906, the Royal Navy now had a lead of one: ''Dreadnought''. The new class of ship prompted an arms race with major strategic consequences. Major naval powers raced to build their own dreadnoughts to catch up with the United Kingdom. Possession of modern battleships was not only vital to naval power, but as with nuclear weapons today, represented a nation's standing in the world.<ref name = "Sondhaus"/> Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Austria and the United States all began dreadnought programmes; and second-rank powers including Turkey, [[Argentina]], Brazil and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.<ref>''The First World War'', John Keegan, ISBN 0-7126-6645-1, p. 281</ref>

==World War I==
{{main|Naval warfare of World War I}}
[[Image:British Grand Fleet 2.jpg|thumb|[[British Grand Fleet]] during [[World War I]]]]

The First World War was an anticlimax for the great dreadnought fleets. There was no decisive clash of modern battlefleets to compare with the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. The role of battleships was marginal to the great land struggle in France and Russia; and it was equally marginal to the [[First Battle of the Atlantic]], the battle between [[U-boat|German submarines]] and British merchant shipping.

By virtue of geography, the Royal Navy could keep the [[High Seas Fleet|German High Seas Fleet]] bottled up in the [[North Sea]] with relative ease. Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would likely result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly fields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds.<ref>''The First World War'', John Keegan, ISBN 0-7126-6645-1, p. 289</ref> 
[[Image:Hochseeflotte 1.jpg|thumb|German [[High Seas Fleet]] during [[World War I]]]]
The first two years of war saw conflict in the North Sea limited to skirmishes by [[battlecruiser]]s at the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight]] and [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] and raids on the English coast. In the summer of 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on German terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets in the [[Battle of Jutland]]: an indecisive engagement.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 88–95</ref> 

In the other naval theatres there were no decisive pitched battles. In the [[Black Sea]], engagement between [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the [[Battle of Moon Sound]] at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] was in a sense the mirror of the North Sea: the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by the British and French blockade. And in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]].

The course of the war also illustrated the vulnerability of battleships to cheaper weapons. In September 1914, the potential threat posed to [[capital ship]]s by German U-boats was confirmed by successful attacks on British cruisers, including the sinking of three British armored cruisers by the German submarine [[Unterseeboot 9 (1910)|U-9]] in less than an hour. Sea mines proved a threat the next month, when the recently commissioned British super-dreadnought [[HMS Audacious (1912)|''Audacious'']] struck a mine. By the end of October, the British had changed their strategy and tactics in the North Sea to reduce the risk of U-boat attack.<ref>Massie, Robert. ''Castles of Steel'', London, 2005. pp127–145</ref> While Jutland was the only major clash of battleship fleets in history, the German plan for the battle relied on U-boat attacks on the British fleet; and the escape of the German fleet from the superior British firepower was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers closing on British battleships, causing them to turn away to avoid the threat of torpedo attack. Further near-misses from submarine attacks on battleships and casualties amongst cruisers led to growing paranoia in the Royal Navy about the vulnerability of battleships. By October 1916, the Royal Navy had essentially abandoned the North Sea, instructing the Grand Fleet not to go south of the [[Farne Islands]] unless adequately protected by destroyers. 

The German High Seas Fleet, for their part, were determined not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines; and since the submarines were needed more for raiding commercial traffic, the fleet stayed in port for the remainder of the war.<ref>''The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery'', Paul Kennedy, ISBN 0-333-35094-4, pp. 247–249</ref> Other theatres equally showed the role of small craft in damaging or destroying dreadnoughts. The two Austrian dreadnoughts lost in 1918 were the casualties of torpedo boats and of [[frogman|frogmen]]. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] capital ships lost in Gallipoli were sunk by mines and torpedo,<ref>[[HMS Majestic (1895)|HMS ''Majestic'']] and [[HMS Triumph (1903)|HMS ''Triumph'']] were torpedoed by ''U.21''; [[HMS Goliath (1898)|HMS ''Goliath'']] was torpedoed by the Turkish torpedo boat ''Muavenet''.</ref> while a Turkish pre-dreadnought was caught in the [[Dardanelles]] by a British submarine.

==The inter-war period==
The inter-war period saw the battleship subjected to strict international limitations to prevent a costly arms race breaking out.

For many years, [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] simply had no battleships. The [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]] required that most of the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in [[Scapa Flow]], [[Scotland]]. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were [[scuttling|scuttled]] by their German crews on [[21 June]] [[1919]] just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any [[capital ship]]s.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', p. 118</ref>

While the victors were not limited by the Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were crippled after the war. Faced with the prospect of a naval arms race against the United States, Britain was keen to conclude the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan.<ref>Kennedy p 277</ref> The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the [[Geneva Naval Conference|First Geneva Naval Conference]] (1927), the [[London Naval Treaty|First London Naval Treaty]] (1930), the [[Second Geneva Naval Conference]] (1932), and finally the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on [[1 September]] [[1939]] at the beginning of [[World War II]], but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 124–126, 139–142</ref> The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched from 1919&ndash;1939 than from 1905&ndash;1914. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British [[N3 battleship]], the first American [[South Dakota class battleship (1920)|''South Dakota''-class]], and the Japanese [[Kii class battleship|''Kii''-class]]&mdash;all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor&mdash;never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as '''treaty battleships'''.

===Rise of the aircraft carrier===
[[Image:Ostfriesland bombed by Mitchells team p19.jpg|thumb|Bombing tests which sank SMS ''Ostfriesland'', September, 1921]]

As early as 1914, the British Admiral [[Percy Scott]] predicted that battleships would soon be made irrelevant by [[military aviation|aeroplanes]].<ref>Kennedy, op. cit., p. 199</ref> By the end of World War I, aeroplanes had successfully adopted the torpedo as a weapon.<ref>From the ''Guinness Book of Air Facts and Feats ''(3rd edition, 1977): "The first air attack using a torpedo dropped by an aeroplane was carried out by Flight Commander Charles H. K. Edmonds, flying a [[Short Type 184|Short 184]] seaplane from HMS ''Ben-My-Chree'' on [[12 August]] [[1915]], against a 5,000 ton (5,080 tonne) Turkish supply ship in the [[Sea of Marmara]]. Although the enemy ship was hit and sunk, the captain of a British submarine claimed to have fired a torpedo simultaneously and sunk the ship. It was further stated that the British submarine E14 had attacked and immobilised the ship four days earlier.

However, on 17 August 1915, another Turkish ship was sunk by a torpedo of whose origin there can be no doubt. On this occasion Flight Commander C. H. Edmonds, flying a Short 184, torpedoed a Turkish steamer a few miles north of the Dardanelles. His formation colleague, Flight Lieutenant G. B. Dacre, was forced to land on the water owing to engine trouble but, seeing an enemy tug close by, taxied up to it and released his torpedo. The tug blew up and sank. Thereafter, Dacre was able to take off and return to the ''Ben-My-Chree''</ref> A proposed attack on the German fleet at anchor in 1918 using the [[Sopwith Cuckoo]] carrier-borne torpedo-bomber was considered and rejected&mdash;but it was not long before such a technique was adopted.

In the 1920s, General [[Billy Mitchell]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps]], believing that air forces had rendered navies around the world obsolete, testified in front of Congress that "1,000 bombardment airplanes can be built and operated for about the price of one battleship" and that a squadron of these bombers could sink a battleship, making for more efficient use of government funds.<ref>[http://www.afa.org/magazine/June1996/0696mitchell.asp Boyne, Walter J. (1996). ''The Spirit of Billy Mitchell''. Air Force Magazine Online: Journal of the Air Force Association. Retrieved on [[October 6]] [[2007]].]</ref> This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell was nevertheless allowed to conduct a careful series of bombing tests alongside Navy and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] bombers. In 1921, he bombed and sank numerous ships, including the "unsinkable" German World War I battleship [[USS Ostfriesland|''Ostfriesland'']] and the American pre-dreadnought [[USS Alabama (BB-8)|''Alabama'']].

Although Mitchell had required "war-time conditions", the ships sunk were obsolete, stationary, defenseless and had no damage control. The sinking of ''Ostfriesland'' was accomplished by violating an agreement that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of various munitions: Mitchell's airmen disregarded the rules, and sank the ship within minutes in a coordinated attack. The stunt made headlines, and Mitchell declared, "No surface vessels can exist wherever air forces acting from land bases are able to attack them." While far from conclusive, Mitchell's test was significant because it put proponents of the battleship against naval aviation on the back foot.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/> Rear Admiral [[William A. Moffett]] used public relations against Mitchell to make headway toward expansion of the U.S. Navy's nascent aircraft carrier program.<ref>Jeffers, H. Paul (2006).

===Rearmament===
[[Image:HMS Nelson (1931) profile drawing.png|thumb|Diagrams of the British [[Nelson class battleship]] of the inter-war period]]

The [[Royal Navy]], [[United States Navy]], and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] extensively upgraded and modernized their WWI-era battleships during the 1930s. Among new features were tower height and stability such that optical rangefinder equipment for gunnery control could be used. Some British ships received a large block superstructure nicknamed the "Queen Anne's castle", such as in the ''[[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|Queen Elizabeth]]'' and ''[[HMS Warspite (03)|Warspite]]'', which would be used in the new conning towers of the ''[[King George V class battleship (1939)|King George V]]'' fast battleships. The Japanese rebuilt all of their battleships, plus their battlecruisers, with distinctive "[[pagoda]]" structures, though the ''[[Japanese battleship Hiei|Hiei]]'' received a more modern bridge tower that would influence the new ''[[Yamato class battleship|Yamato]]'' battleships. The U.S. experimented with tripod and later caged masts, though after [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] some of the most severely damaged ships such as ''[[USS West Virginia (BB-48)|West Virginia]]'' and ''[[USS California (BB-44)|California]]'' were rebuilt to a similar appearance to their [[Iowa class battleship|fast battleship]] contemporaries. Optic fire-control systems were rendered obsolete by radar, which was effective beyond visual contact and was effective in complete darkness or adverse weather conditions.<ref>[http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_fire.htm CombinedFleet.com]</ref>

Even when war threatened again in the late 1930s, battleship construction did not regain the level of importance which it had held in the years before World War I. The "building holiday" imposed by the naval treaties meant that the building capacity of dockyards worldwide was relatively reduced, and the strategic position had changed. The development of the [[strategic bomber]] meant that the navy was no longer the only method of projecting power overseas, and the development of the [[aircraft carrier]] meant that battleships had a rival for the resources available for capital ship construction.
[[Image:RNVittorio Veneto.jpg|thumb|200px|Vittorio Veneto]]
In [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], the ambitious [[Plan Z]] for naval rearmament was abandoned in favour of a strategy of submarine warfare supplemented by the use of battlecruisers and [[Bismarck class battleship|''Bismarck'']]-class battleships as commerce raiders. In Britain, the most pressing need was for air defences and convoy escorts to safeguard the civilian population from bombing or starvation, and re-armament construction plans consisted of five ships of the [[King George V class battleship (1939)|''King George V'']] class. It was in the Mediterranean that navies remained most committed to battleship warfare. France intended to build six battleships of the [[Dunkerque class battleship|''Dunkerque'']] and [[Richelieu class battleship|''Richelieu'']] classes, and the Italians two powerful [[Littorio class battleship|''Littorio'']]-class ships. Neither navy built significant aircraft carriers. The U.S. preferred to spend limited funds on aircraft carriers until the [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota'']] class. Japan, also prioritising aircraft carriers, nevertheless began work on three mammoth [[Yamato class battleship|''Yamato'']] class ships (although one of these was later completed as a carrier).<ref name = "Lenton"/>

At the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish]] navy consisted of only two small dreadnought battleships, ''España'' and ''Jaime I''. ''España'' (originally named ''Alfonso XIII''), by then in reserve at the northwestern naval base of El Ferrol, fell into [[Spain under Franco|Nationalist]] hands in July 1936. The crew aboard ''Jaime I'' murdered their officers, mutinied, and joined the Republican Navy. Thus each side had one battleship; however, the Republican Navy generally lacked experienced officers. The Spanish battleships mainly restricted themselves to mutual blockades, convoy escort duties, and shore bombardment, rarely in direct fighting against other surface units.<ref>Gibbons, p.195</ref> In April 1937, ''España'' ran onto a mine laid by friendly forces, and sank with little loss of life. In May 1937, ''Jaime I'' was damaged by Nationalist air attacks and a grounding incident. The ship was forced to go back to port to be repaired. There she was again hit by several aerial bombs. It was then decided to tow the battleship to a more secure port, but during the transport she suffered an internal explosion that caused 300 deaths and her total loss. Several Italian and German capital ships participated in the non-intervention blockade. On [[May 29]] [[1937]], two Republican aircraft managed to bomb the German pocket battleship [[German battleship Deutschland|''Deutschland'']] outside [[Ibiza]], causing severe damage and loss of life. [[German battleship Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] retaliated two days later by bombarding [[Almería]], causing much destruction, and the resulting [[Deutschland incident|''Deutschland'' incident]] meant the end of German and Italian support for non-intervention.<ref>Greger, René: ''Schlachtschiffe der Welt'', p. 251</ref>

==World War II==
German battleships&mdash;obsolete pre-dreadnoughts&mdash;fired the first shots of World War II with the bombardment of the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] garrison at [[Westerplatte]];<ref>Gibbons, p. 163</ref> and the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|final surrender]] of the Japanese Empire took place aboard a United States Navy battleship, the [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']]. Between the two events, it became clear that battleships were now essentially auxiliary craft, and [[aircraft carrier]]s were the new principal ships of the fleet.

Still, battleships played a part in major engagements in [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|Atlantic]], [[Pacific War|Pacific]] and [[Battle of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean theatres]]. In the Atlantic, the Germans experimented with taking the battleship beyond conventional fleet action, using their pocket battleships as independent commerce raiders. Although there were a few battleship-on-battleship engagements, battleships had little impact on the destroyer and submarine [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|Battle of the Atlantic]], and aircraft carriers determined the outcome of most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific War.

In the first year of the war, battleships and battlecruisers defied predictions that aircraft would dominate naval warfare. [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and [[German battlecruiser Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] surprised and sank the aircraft carrier [[HMS Glorious|''Glorious'']] off western [[Norway]] in June 1940.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 246–247</ref> The vulnerability of unescorted carriers to attack by other ships meant that carriers almost always had escorts, so this engagement marked the last time surface gunnery sank a fleet carrier. In the [[Attack on Mers-el-Kébir]], British capital ships opened fire on the French battleships harboured in [[Algeria]] with their own heavy guns, and later pursued fleeing French ships with planes from aircraft carriers.

===Taranto and Matapan===
[[Image:Tirpitz early.jpg|thumb|Tirpitz]]
In late 1940 and 1941, a range of engagements saw battleships harassed by carrier aircraft.

The first example of the power of naval aviation was the British air attack on the Italian naval base at [[Battle of Taranto|Taranto]] that took place on the night of 11&ndash;12 November 1940. A small number of Royal Navy aircraft attacked the Italian fleet at harbour, succeeding in sinking one Italian battleship and damaging two others. Importantly, the attack forced the Italian navy to change tactics and seek battle against the superior British navy, which resulted in their defeat at the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]].

===Bismarck===
{{main|German Battleship Bismarck}}
The battleship war in the Atlantic was driven by the attempts of German capital ship [[commerce raider]]s&mdash;two battleships, the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] and the [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']], and two battlecruisers&mdash;to influence the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|Battle of the Atlantic]] by destroying Atlantic [[convoy]]s supplying the United Kingdom. The superior numbers of British surface units devoted themselves to protecting the convoys, and to seek-and-destroy missions against the German ships, assisted by both naval and land-based aircraft and by sabotage attacks. On [[24 May]] [[1941]], during its attempt to break out into the North Atlantic, the commerce raider [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] engaged the British battleship HMS [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|''Prince of Wales'']] and the battlecruiser [[HMS Hood (51)|''Hood'']]. Due primarily to the <i>Bismarck</i>'s superior range-finding and accuracy, it soon sank ''Hood'' with a hit to her magazines. ''Bismarck'' and ''Prince of Wales'' hit each other three times, the damage compelling the German battleship to withdraw.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 228–229</ref>  While the <i>Bismarck</i> was heading for home, the Royal Navy continued to hunt it, and eventually an attack by [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] [[biplane]] torpedo-bombers from the aircraft carrier [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|''Ark Royal'']] disabled <i>Bismarck's</i> rudder. This enabled Royal Navy battleships, cruisers and destroyers to close in for the kill.

===The Pacific battles===
[[Image:USS Pennsylvania moving into Lingayen Gulf.jpg|thumb|right|[[USS Pennsylvania (BB-38)|''Pennsylvania'']] leading battleship [[USS Colorado (BB-45)|''Colorado'']] and cruisers [[USS Louisville (CA-28)|''Louisville'']], [[USS Portland (CA-33)|''Portland'']], and [[USS Columbia (CL-56)|''Columbia'']] into [[Lingayen Gulf]], [[Philippines]], January 1945]]
In many of the crucial battles of the Pacific, for instance [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] and [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. The primary tasks for battleships in the Pacific became shore bombardment and anti-aircraft defense for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's ''Yamato'' class, which carried a main battery of nine 18.1-[[inch]] (460 [[millimetre]]) guns and were designed to be a principal strategic weapon, were seldom given a chance to fulfill their potential. They were hampered by technical deficiencies (slow battleships were incapable of operating with fast carriers), faulty military [[doctrine]] (the Japanese waited for a "decisive battle", which never came), and defective dispositions (as at Midway).

====Pearl Harbor====
Before hostilities broke out in the Pacific Theatre, extensive pre-war planning centered around dreadnoughts. The [[Royal Navy]] could not achieve parity with the estimated nine Japanese [[capital ship]]s in Southeast Asia, since doing so would leave only a handful of ships to use against Nazi Germany. However, Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was optimistic about the improving situation in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean and [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|allocating two ships]] to the defence of [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]] was seen as a compromise. Furthermore, the U.S. Navy later agreed to send its [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] with its eight battleships to Singapore in the event of hostilities with Japan.<ref>[http://www.forcez-survivors.org.uk/sinking1.html The sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse (Forcez-survivors.org)]</ref>

On [[7 December]] [[1941]] the Japanese launched a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Five out of eight U.S. battleships were quickly either sunk or sinking, with the rest damaged. The Japanese thus neutralized the U.S. battleship force in the Pacific by an air attack, and thereby proved Mitchell's theory, and showed the vulnerability of warships lying at anchor, as at Taranto. The American aircraft carriers were however at sea and evaded detection. They in turn took up the fight, eventually turning the tide of the war in the Pacific.

The [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of the British battleship ''Prince of Wales'']] and her escort, the battlecruiser HMS ''Repulse'', further demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack, in this case while at sea without air cover. Both ships were on their way to assist in the defense of Singapore when Japanese land-based [[bomber]]s and [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] found and sank them on [[10 December]] [[1941]]. ''Prince of Wales'' has the distinction of being the first modern battleship sunk by aircraft while underway and able to defend herself.<ref>Axell, Albert: ''Kamikaze'', p. 14</ref>

====Midway====
Commonly understood as a victory of carriers, [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] showed up deficiencies in Japanese operational planning. [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Yamamoto]], considering them his most valuable units, kept his battleships far to the rear, in line with traditional practice. This placed them too far away to assist [[Chuichi Nagumo|Nagumo]] (and they would have been too slow to keep up with him in any case). Yet, when Nagumo's carriers were sunk, Yamamoto lost an opportunity to salvage something. Carriers, for all their evident potency, were virtually defenseless at night, and [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Fletcher]] might have been dealt a crushing blow by [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] the night of 6–[[7 June]], had Yamamoto stayed closer.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin'', ''passim''.</ref>

====Guadalcanal====
Initially, when the U.S. entered the war in December 1941, it had no battleships available in the Pacific Theatre. Eight of them were sunk or crippled at Pearl Harbor and were sent home for repairs and reconstruction; they would not have been able to keep up with the carriers in any case. The new [[fast battleship]]s of [[North Carolina class battleship|''North Carolina'']] and [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota'']] classes were still undergoing trials. ''North Carolina'' and ''South Dakota'' were ready by summer of 1942 and provided crucial anti-aircraft defense during the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Eastern Solomons]] and [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz Islands]] carrier battles.

[[Image:Yamatotrials.jpg|thumb|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], seen in 1941, and her sister ship [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']] were the largest battleships in history.]]

By contrast, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had the advantage of a dozen operational battleships early in the war, but chose not to deploy them in any significant engagements. The [[Fuso class battleship|''Fusō'']]s and [[Ise class battleship|''Ise'']]s, despite their extensive modernization and respectable speeds, were relegated to training and home defense, while the [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato''s]] and [[Yamato class battleship|''Yamato''s]] were being saved for [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|"Decisive Battle"]] which never came to fruition on Japanese terms. In fact, the only Japanese battleships to see much action in the early stages were [[Kongō class battlecruiser|''Kongō'']]s, which served mostly as carrier escorts due to their high speed.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 262–263</ref>

During the later part of the [[Guadalcanal campaign]] in fall 1942, Japan and the U.S. were both forced to commit their battleships to surface combat, due to the need to carry out night operations, and because of the exhaustion of their carrier forces. During the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal#First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.2C November 13|First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], battleships [[Japanese battleship Hiei|''Hiei'']] and [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']] were driven off by a force of U.S. cruisers and destroyers. Several USN ships were lost and others were crippled, but they inflicted critical damage on ''Hiei'', which was abandoned after being subject to repeated air attacks that made salvage impossible. The following evening, at the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on [[15 November]] [[1942]], the United States battleships [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']] and [[USS Washington (BB-56)|''Washington'']] fought and destroyed the surviving ''Kirishima''.

It was also at Guadalcanal that battleships demonstrated the other primary use to which they would be put, delivering devastating fire against [[Honiara International Airport|Henderson Field]].

====Leyte Gulf====
[[Image:Yamato1945.jpg|thumb|''Yamato'' under air attack, March 1945]]
At the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], heavy aircraft losses made the carriers ineffectual and forced the Japanese to finally commit their dreadnoughts, both old and new, to the upcoming [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Campaign]]. The objective in this "decisive battle" was to stop the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] from capturing the [[Philippines]], which would cut off the Japanese oil supply and render their navy useless. The [[Battle off Samar]], on [[25 October]] [[1944]], proved battleships were still lethal. The American [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]] of "Taffy 3" had a narrow escape from under the guns of Japanese battleships [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], [[Japanese battleship Kongō|''Kongō'']], [[Japanese battleship Haruna|''Haruna'']] and [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] and their [[cruiser]] escort. American destroyers and aircraft attacked the battleships, enabling the American task force to disengage. Inexplicably, the Japanese disengaged as well, despite being near their intended target - the American amphibious landing forces at Leyte.

At Leyte Gulf, on [[25 October]] [[1944]], six battleships, led by Admiral [[Jesse Oldendorf]] of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|U.S. Seventh Fleet]]{{Fact|date=October 2007}}<!--check the date it changed from PacFlt--> sank Admiral [[Shoji Nishimura]]'s flagship [[Japanese battleship Yamashiro|''Yamashiro'']] and would have sunk [[Japanese battleship Fusō|''Fusō'']] if it had not already been broken in two by destroyer torpedoes moments earlier during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf #Battle of Surigao Strait|Battle of Surigao Strait]]. This engagement marked the last time in history when battleship faced battleship. It was also the day after an engagement further north (the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf #Battle of the Sibuyan Sea|Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]]) in which [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']], sister ship to ''Yamato'', was sunk by aircraft long before she could come within striking range of the American force.

===Soviet and Finnish battles===
[[Image:Marat-in-Gdynia.png|thumb|Soviet battleship [[Russian battleship Petropavlovsk (1914)|''Marat'']] moored in [[Gdynia]] prior to WWII. ''Marat'' was sunk in [[Kronstadt]] harbor by a 1,000 kg aerial bomb but three of four main turrets continued to operate against the invading Germans]]
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-[[Finland|Finnish]] [[Winter War]], the Soviet battleships [[Battleship Petropavlovsk (1914)|''Marat'']] and [[Russian battleship Gangut (1909)|''Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya'']] made several attempts to neutralize the Finnish coastal batteries in order to implement a full naval blockade. The Soviets inflicted little damage on the Finnish positions, and the defenders hit back, claiming at least one hit on ''Marat''.<ref>Appel, Erik: ''Finland i krig 1939–1940'', p. 182</ref> During the German assault on the Soviet Union, the Soviet battleships served as convoy escorts during the evacuation of [[Tallinn]], and as floating batteries during the [[siege of Leningrad]].<ref>Linder, Jan: ''Ofredens hav'', pp. 50–51</ref> The dense German and Finnish minefields and the submarine nets effectively restricted Soviet traffic in the [[Gulf of Finland]], forcing the larger vessels to remain at port.<ref>Linder, Jan: ''Ofredens hav'', pp. 50–51</ref><ref>Brunila, Kai: ''Finland i krig 1940–1944'', pp. 100–108, 220–225</ref> The German [[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka]] pilot [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] eventually sank ''Marat'' at her moorings on [[23 September]] [[1941]]. Still, the vessel was able to serve as a battery for the remainder of the siege. The Soviets later refloated ''Marat'' and both it and ''Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya'' served until the 1950s.<ref>Greger, René: ''Schlachtschiffe der Welt'', pp. 201</ref>

===Fire support===

{{main|Fire Support}}
With the German capital-ship raiders sunk or forced to remain in port, shore bombardment became the focus of Allied battleships in the Atlantic. It was while covering the Allied [[Operation Torch|invasion of Morocco]] that the [[USS Massachusetts (BB-59)|''Massachusetts'']] fought and disabled [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] battleship [[French battleship Jean Bart (1940)|''Jean Bart'']] on [[27 October]] [[1942]]. Six battleships came together as part of [[Operation Neptune]], in support of the [[Battle of Normandy|D-Day landings]] in June 1944. D-Day also saw the humble sacrifice of two obsolete dreadnoughts, which were sunk as part of the breakwater around the Allied [[Mulberry harbour]]s.

===Aerial defense===
[[Image:Kamikaze zero.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[kamikaze]] (just left of center near the top border), a [[A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zero]] in this case, about to hit the [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']]]]

The [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']] off the coast of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] in 1941 demonstrated that even the most modern battleships could not hold off aerial attacks without air cover. Afterwards, an aircraft carrier's [[combat air patrol]] proved to be the most effective form of defense against enemy bombers; nonetheless a modern [[fast battleship]] could provide a vital point defense against attackers that broke through the fighter screen. The ''North Carolina'' and ''South Dakota'' demonstrated just that in the battles of the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Eastern Solomons]] and [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz Islands]], respectively, with ''North Carolina'' downing between 7 and 14 planes, while ''South Dakota'' shot down between 26 and 32. The battleships' presence was crucial during these 1942 battles, as the U.S. were still months from being able to realize their material advantage, with too few planes and ships to interdict enough of the skilled Japanese pilots.

By 1944, Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]] had arrayed his forces. The first line of defence was a radar-vectored [[combat air patrol]], and any attackers who managed to get through would face anti-aircraft fire from a line of screening battleships and cruisers. This exacted such a heavy toll on the Japanese during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea#Japanese raids: The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot|Battle of the Philippine Sea]] that they failed to cause any significant damage to their targets, the aircraft carriers.<ref>[http://www.combinedfleet.com/btl_ps.htm Battle of the Philippine Sea (CombinedFleet.com)]</ref> Circumstances were vastly different from 1942 as the Japanese aircrews were inexperienced, and they were up against veteran U.S. pilots as well as many new carriers and battleships.

====AA guns====
At the outbreak of World War II, most battleships had large anti-aircraft batteries. The battleships used the same light AA guns (the Allies used autocannons such as the [[Bofors 40 mm gun]] and [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]]) as those on smaller ships, but in greater number. The later development of [[proximity fuse]]s and [[radar]] vastly increased the effectiveness of these batteries. 

Post-WWI battleships, particularly British and American, had discarded the [[casemate]]s in favour of turret-mounted dual purpose secondary batteries ([[5"/38 caliber gun|5-inch]] or 6-inch calibre). Secondaries were initially designed to deal with rushing destroyers and torpedo boats, but there arose a need for heavy anti-aircraft armament as the potency of aircraft grew, particularly torpedo planes. The rationale was that it is unlikely that a battleship would be simultaneously facing both destroyers and aircraft, but it would take up too much space to have separate types of guns to deal with both threats. Both weapons had similar calibres and so they could be merged into a single battery type, and the turret mountings were less susceptible to flooding and had a better firing arc than casemates. The space saved from combining the two types of guns added to simplification of supply, increased deck armour coverage, stowage of other equipment, more light anti-aircraft batteries, and other needs. 

The [[Nelson class battleship]], incorporating many concepts from the [[G3 battlecruiser]], was the first design to include a dual-purpose secondary battery, useful against both surface and airborne attacks. Compared to light AA they had a slower rate of fire, but they had a greater range and sufficient punch to knock enemy planes out of the sky. This proved a crucial defense against Japanese [[kamikaze]]s in the latter years of WWII. They could also fire into the sea to create waterspouts that slapped low-flying torpedo planes with tonnes of water. Battleships could mount many more of these DP batteries than cruisers or carriers.

German vessels such as the ''Bismarck'' class possessed dedicated secondary anti-ship batteries as well as dedicated heavy anti-aircraft batteries, rather than adopting the dual-purpose secondaries like the British or Americans. ''Bismarck'' for instance had a battery of twelve 5.9&nbsp;inch (150&nbsp;mm) cannon and another sixteen 4.1&nbsp;inch (105&nbsp;mm) battery was mounted to deal with air threats. The cannon could be used against ships only, as they could not be elevated to fire on high-level targets. This tended to complicate ammunition supplies, take up more space, and reduce the numbers of both guns (reducing the anti-ship ''or'' anti-aircraft broadside). The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] suffered similar problems to the Germans', as their secondaries were too slow to track aircraft.<ref>[http://www.combinedfleet.com/127_50.htm Japanese Naval Ordnance (CombinedFleet.com)]</ref>

The Japanese even used the "San Shiki" (the Beehive) Model 13 anti-aircraft shell for the main gun armament of the [[Yamato class battleship]]s, which would have in theory functioned as a super-sized "shotgun", though this was not considered a success.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/wwii/Japanese.navy/jap_yamoto_bat.txt |title=Jap Yamoto bat |accessdate=2007-10-15 |format=txt |publisher=Ibiblio.org }}</ref>

====Armour====
In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Jutland]] and post-WWI era, designers began drawing up [[vehicle armour|armour]] schemes that protected against ordnance dropped by aircraft or submarines. The five ships of the American [[Tennessee class battleship|''Tennessee'']] and [[Colorado class battleship|''Colorado'']] classes had considerably improved underwater hull protection over previous battleships, as the result of extensive experimentation and testing. The proposed [[G3 battlecruiser]] was planned to incorporate a thoroughly tested torpedo defense scheme, which was later used in the ''Nelson''-class. Not surprisingly, as many WWI battleships did not have such a protection system, they fared poorly against such weapons, which in WWII were increasingly being delivered by submarines and aircraft.

Battleships had an armoured belt for underwater protection against torpedoes or shells which hit below the waterline. From the lessons of Jutland, the protection scheme incorporated a sophisticated torpedo defense system (TDS).<ref>[http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_underw.htm Best Battleship: Underwater Protection (CombinedFleet.com)]</ref> By adopting a turbo-electric drive, this allowed a wholesale rearrangement and fine subdivision of the machinery spaces, while simultaneously narrowing them and permitting more space outboard for a layered system of voids, liquid-filled tanks and thin armored bulkheads.<ref>[http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-071.htm A Survey of the American "Standard Type" Battleship (navweaps.com)]</ref> By contrast, "thin-skinned" cruisers and carriers relied only on numerous compartments to prevent flooding from spreading. Some were upgraded with [[Anti-torpedo bulge|anti-torpedo blisters]], though these were much inferior to the battleship's armoured belt. During [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], TDS and damage control counterflooding saved [[USS West Virginia (BB-48)#7 December 1941|''West Virginia'']] from nine torpedo hits, while [[USS Oklahoma (BB-37)|''Oklahoma'']], which lacked it, capsized after just three.

During the attack on [[IJN Yamato|''Yamato'']], according to a PBS documentary, U.S. torpedo bombers were taught to aim for either the bow or the stern, where the protective belt did not extend. In order for torpedo planes to make their runs successfully, it was the job of fighters to strafe the battleship to suppress the AA guns, and for dive bombers to wreak havoc on the upper decks, destroying AA weapons and fire control systems. Pilots were also instructed to focus on one side of the ship, causing massive flooding which was difficult to counteract, leading to the ship capsizing. A bow hit was deadly, since the onrushing water from the battleship's high speed could wrench the hole open wider and collapse compartment bulkheads, which was why <i>Yamato</i>'s sister, [[IJN Musashi|''Musashi'']], foundered at [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Sibuyan Sea|Sibuyan Sea]].<ref>[http://www.combinedfleet.com/eclipkong.html The Loss of Battleship KONGO: As told in Chapter "November Woes" of "Total Eclipse: The Last Battles of the IJN - Leyte to Kure 1944 to 1945". (CombinedFleet.com)]</ref> The stern attacks are best demonstrated by the cases of ''Bismarck'' and ''Prince of Wales''; the rudders and screws were similarly vulnerable.

As the armour decks of battleships were also of sufficient thickness, the [[Fleet Air Arm]] planned to release their armour-piercing bombs from a certain height in order to penetrate <i>Tirpitz</i>'s armor during [[Operation Tungsten]].<ref>[http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_armor.htm Best Battleship: Armor (CombinedFleet.com)]</ref> As the British pilots did not release their ordnance from the optimal altitude, ''Tirpitz'' suffered extensive damage to her upperworks but her deck armor remained intact.<ref>[http://www.bismarck-class.dk/tirpitz/history/tiropertungsten.html Tirpitz: The History (www.bismarck-class.dk/tirpitz/history/tiropertungsten.html)]</ref> While the [[suicide attacks|suicide air attacks]]&mdash;the so-called kamikaze&mdash;struck many U.S. battleships, none were seriously damaged due to their thick armor. ''Kamikaze'' were much more successful against lesser-armored ships.<ref>Axell, Albert: ''Kamikaze'', pp. 205–213</ref>

There were limits to the battleship's protection scheme, since it could not keep pace with the quicker developments in ordnance. For instance, the TDS in the [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota'']] and ''Iowa'' battleships were designed to absorb the energy from an underwater explosion equivalent to 700 pounds (317 kg) of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] &mdash; the Navy's best guess in the 1930s about Japanese weapons. But unbeknownst to U.S. Naval Intelligence, the Japanese 24-inch (60 cm) [[Type 93 torpedo]], carried a charge equivalent to 891 pounds (405 kg) of TNT. And no amount of armour that could be practically incorporated would have saved the [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] from the massive 12,000 lb (5.4t) [[Tallboy bomb|Tallboy]]s dropped by RAF Lancaster bombers during [[German battleship Tirpitz#Operations Paravane.2C Obviate and Catechism|Operation Catechism]].<ref>Tamelander, Michael: ''Slagskeppet Tirpitz''</ref><ref>Jacobsen, Alf R.: ''Dödligt angrepp''</ref>

====Coordination and waves====
In a well-planned attack, fighter planes strafed the battleship to suppress the AA guns, while dive bombers used their armour-piercing bombs to cause topside damage and havoc. The fighters and dive bombers, however, were diversions in order to allow the torpedo planes to deliver their ordnance.

Battleships were able to sustain more punishment and had fewer vulnerable spots than cruisers and carriers, so it was difficult to rely upon scoring a critical hit (the cases of the ''Bismarck'' and ''Prince of Wales'' are considered exceptional). Instead, the way to defeat battleships was by attrition, inflicted accumulating damage, by overwhelming them with repeated waves of attacks. This is best demonstrated at the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]; at the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of the Sibuyan Sea|Sibuyan Sea]] where the super-dreadnought ''[[IJN Musashi|Musashi]]'' eventually succumbed to her damage, after being beset by waves of U.S. carrier aircraft and with her being the primary focus of their attacks. The U.S. planes would have accomplished less if they spread out to attack the rest of the ships in Kurita's powerful force. By contrast, the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Surigao Strait|October 24 air attack]] on Nishimura's southern pincer did little damage, even though both of his [[Fuso class battleship|battleships]] were slow WWI-era dreadnoughts and his force had far fewer screening ships, as he only faced a single wave from U.S. carriers ''[[USS Franklin (CV-13)|Franklin]]'' and ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]''.

====Innovative Attacks====
The [[Axis Powers]] implemented some unconventional methods. The Italians used with success their tested method of having [[frogman|frogmen]] delivering explosive charges to the ships, and managed to sink [[HMS Valiant (1914)|HMS ''Valiant'']] and [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] in the shallow waters of the harbor of [[Alexandria]], putting them out of action until 1942. Other more or less successful Italian methods included [[human torpedo|manned torpedoes]] and small [[MTM|motor assault boats]], which were filled with explosives, aimed at the target, sped up to full speed, while the pilot catapulted himself out from the dashing craft.<ref>Taylor, A. J. P.: ''1900-talet'', p. 139</ref>

The Germans developed a series of stand-off weapons, ''e.g.'' the [[precision-guided munition|guided bomb]] [[Fritz X]], which scored some early successes. On [[9 September]] [[1943]], the Germans managed to sink the Italian battleship [[Italian battleship Roma (1940)|''Roma'']] and severely damage her sister ship, the [[Italian battleship Littorio|''Italia'']], while they were underway to surrender. The first one hit ''Roma'' amidship between 90 mm AA gun mounts, piercing deck and side, then exploded, halving her speed; the other one hit above deck between turret #2 and the conning tower. It caused an explosion that threw the turret outboard and affected the boilers, starting a major fire that detonated the main magazines. 1353 lives were lost; only 596 survivors, most badly burned, were rescued. Among those killed was the Italian Commander in Chief of Naval Battle Forces, [[Carlo Bergamini (admiral)|Admiral Carlo Bergamini]]. One week later, the Germans scored another hit with a Fritz X on the British battleship [[HMS Warspite (1913)|''Warspite'']]. The bomb penetrated six decks before exploding against the bottom of the ship, blowing a large hole in her. The ship took in a total of 5,000 tonnes of water, lost steam (and thus all power, both to the ship herself and to all her systems), and had to be taken in tow. She reached Malta but was out of action for the next 12 months.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 190–191</ref> 

The British further developed their ability to sink battleships in harbour with minisubs and very heavy bombs dropped by strategic bombers. The last active German battleship, [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']], lurked until late into the war in Norwegian [[fjord]]s protected by [[anti-submarine weapon]]s and shore based anti-aircraft guns. She was severely damaged in September 1943 during [[Operation Source]], a daring covert attack by [[X class submarine|British mini-subs]]. After several air strikes, including [[Operation Tungsten]] which was made with carrier aircraft, ''Tirpitz'' was finally sunk in harbour by [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] heavy bombers carrying massive [[tallboy bomb]]s. During that action, codenamed [[German battleship Tirpitz#Operations Paravane.2C Obviate and Catechism|Operation Catechism]], two of the bombs penetrated her armour, one holing her portside and the other starting a fire that eventually detonated her magazines and blew off her Caesar turret, causing her to capsize and killing 1000 of the 1700 men aboard.<ref>Tamelander, Michael: ''Slagskeppet Tirpitz''</ref><ref>Jacobsen, Alf R.: ''Dödligt angrepp''</ref>

==The Cold War==
[[Image:Atombombentest Crossroads-Baker.jpg|thumb|[[Operation Crossroads]] Event Baker explosion]]

After World War II, several navies retained battleships, but it became clear that they were not worth the considerable cost. During the war it had become clear that battleship-on-battleship engagements like Leyte Gulf or the sinking of the ''Hood'' were the exception and not the rule, and that engagement ranges were becoming longer and longer, making heavy gun armament irrelevant. The armor of a battleship was equally irrelevant in the face of a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]], and nuclear missiles with a range of {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} or more could be mounted on the Soviet [[Kildin class destroyer|''Kildin'' class destroyer]] and [[Whiskey class submarine|''Whiskey'' class submarine]] by the end of the 1950s.
 
The remaining battleships met a variety of ends. [[USS Arkansas (BB-33)|USS ''Arkansas'']] and [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] were sunk during the testing of nuclear weapons in [[Operation Crossroads]] in 1946. Both battleships proved resistant to nuclear air burst but vulnerable to underwater nuclear explosions. The Italian [[Italian battleship Giulio Cesare|''Giulio Cesare'']] was taken by the Soviets as reparations and renamed ''Novorossiysk''; it was sunk by a German mine in the [[Black Sea]] on [[29 October]] [[1955]]. The two [[Andrea Doria class battleship|''Doria'' class]] ships were scrapped in the late 1950s. The French [[French battleship Lorraine|''Lorraine'']] was scrapped in 1954, [[French battleship Richelieu|''Richelieu'']] in 1964 and [[French battleship Jean Bart|''Jean Bart'']] in 1970. The United Kingdom's four surviving [[King George V class battleship (1939)|''King George V'' class]] ships were scrapped in 1957, and [[HMS Vanguard (1944)|''Vanguard'']] followed in 1960. All other surviving British battleships had been scrapped in the late 1940s. The Soviet Union's ''[[Battleship Petropavlovsk (1914)|Petropavlovsk]]'' was scrapped in 1953, [[Sevastopol (disambiguation)|''Sevastopol'']] in 1957 and [[Soviet battleship Gangut|''Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya'']] in 1959. Brazil's ''Minas Gerais'' was scrapped in 1954, and her sister ship [[Brazilian battleship Sao Paulo|''São Paulo'']] sank en route to the breakers during a storm in 1951. Argentina kept its two [[Rivadavia class battleship|''Rivadavia'' class]] ships until 1956 and Chile kept [[Chilean battleship Almirante Latorre|''Almirante Latorre'']] (formerly HMS ''Canada'') until 1959. The [[Turkey|Turkish]] battlecruiser ''Yavuz'' (formerly the German [[SMS Goeben|''Goeben'']], launched in 1911) was scrapped in 1976 after an offer to sell it back to Germany was refused. Sweden had several small coastal defense battleships, one of which, [[HMS Gustav V|''Gustav V'']], survived until 1970. The Soviets also scrapped four large incomplete cruisers in the late 1950s, whilst plans to build a number of new [[Stalingrad Class Battlecruiser]]s were abandoned following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953. There were also several old ships of the line still used as housing ships or storage depots. Of these, all but HMS ''Victory'' were sunk or scrapped by 1957.
[[Image:Missouri missile BGM-109 Tomahawk.JPG|thumb|right|[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] launches a [[Tomahawk missile]].]]

The [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa'' class battleships]] gained a new lease of life in the U.S. Navy as fire support ships. Shipborne artillery support is considered by the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] as more accurate, more effective and less expensive than aerial strikes. [[Radar]] and computer-controlled gunfire could be aimed with pinpoint accuracy to target. The U.S. recommissioned all four ''Iowa'' class battleships for the [[Korean War]] and the [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']] for the [[Vietnam War]]. These were primarily used for shore bombardment, ''New Jersey'' firing seven times more rounds against shore targets in Vietnam than she had in the Second World War.<ref>History of World Seapower, Bernard Brett, ISBN 0-603-03723-2, p. 236</ref>

As part of [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[John F. Lehman]]'s effort to build a [[600-ship Navy]] in the 1980s, and in response to the commissioning of ''[[Soviet battlecruiser Kirov|Kirov]]'' by the Soviet Union, the United States recommissioned all four ''Iowa'' class battleships. On several occasions, battleships were support ships in [[carrier battle group]]s, or led their own battle groups in a [[battleship battle group]]. These were modernized to carry [[Tomahawk missile]]s, with ''New Jersey'' seeing action bombarding [[Lebanon]] in 1983 and 1984, while [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']] and [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|''Wisconsin'']] fired their 16&nbsp;inch (406&nbsp;mm) guns at land targets and launched missiles in the [[Gulf War]] of 1991. ''Wisconsin'' served as the [[Tomahawk missile|TLAM]] strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of [[Operation Desert Storm]] and fired a total of 24 TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. This will most likely be the last combat action ever by a battleship. The primary threat to the battleships were Iraqi shore based surface-to-surface missiles; ''Missouri'' was targeted by two [[Iraq]]i [[Silkworm missile]]s, with one missing and another being intercepted by the British destroyer [[HMS Gloucester (D96)|HMS ''Gloucester'']].

All four ''Iowas'' were decommissioned in the early 1990s, making them the last battleships to see active service. USS ''Iowa'' and USS ''Wisconsin'' were, until fiscal year 2006, maintained to a standard where they could be rapidly returned to service as fire support vessels, pending the development of a superior fire support vessel.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/bb-61.htm|title= Iowa Class Battleship|accessdate=2007-03-18 |publisher = Federation of American Scientists|format= |work= }}</ref> The U.S. Marine Corps believes that the current naval surface fire support gun and missile programs will not be able to provide adequate fire support for an [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] or onshore operations.<ref>The USMC has revised its Naval Surface Gunfire Support requirements, leaving some questions as to whether or not the [[Zumwalt class destroyer]] can meet the Marine qualifications.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fas.org/man/gao/gao95160.htm|title= Naval Surface Fires Support|author = United States General Accounting Office|accessdate=2007-03-18 |publisher = Federation of American Scientists|format= |work= }}</ref>

==Today==
[[Image:USS Texas BB-35.jpg|thumb|The American [[USS Texas (BB-35)|''Texas'']] (1912) is the only preserved example of a Dreadnought-type battleship that dates to the time of the original HMS ''Dreadnought''.]]

With the decommissioning of the last ''Iowa''s, no battleships remain in service (including in reserve) with any navy worldwide. A number are preserved as [[museum ship]]s, either afloat or in dry-dock. The U.S. has a large number of battleships on display: [[USS Massachusetts (BB-59)|USS ''Massachusetts'']], [[USS North Carolina (BB-55)|''North Carolina'']], [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|''Alabama'']], [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']], [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|''Wisconsin'']], [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']], and [[USS Texas (BB-35)|''Texas'']]. ''Missouri'' and ''New Jersey'' are now museums at [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Camden, New Jersey]], respectively. ''Wisconsin'' is a museum (at [[Norfolk, Virginia]]), and was recently removed from the [[Naval Vessel Register]]. However, pending donation, the public can still only tour the deck, since the rest of the ship is closed off for dehumidification. The only other true battleship on display is the Japanese pre-Dreadnought [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']]. A number of ironclads and ships-of-the-line are also preserved, including [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], [[HMS Warrior (1860)|''Warrior'']], the Swedish [[Regalskeppet Vasa|''Vasa'']], the Dutch [[HNLMS Buffel|''Buffel'']] and [[HNLMS Schorpioen|''Schorpioen'']], and the Chilean war trophy, [[Huáscar (ship)|''Huáscar'']]. The earliest ancestor of the battleship still on display is the 16th-century English war vessel ''[[Mary Rose]]''.

==Battleships in strategy and doctrine==<!-- This section is linked from [[Pennsylvania class battleship]] -->
===Doctrine===
Battleships were the embodiment of [[sea power]]. For [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] and his followers, a strong navy was vital to the success of a nation, and control of the seas was vital for the projection of force on land and overseas. Mahan's theory dictated that the role of the battleship was to sweep the enemy from the seas.<ref>Massie, Robert K. ''Castles of Steel'', London, 2005. ISBN 1-844-134113</ref> While the work of escorting, [[blockade|blockading]] and raiding might be done by [[cruiser]]s or smaller vessels, the presence of the battleship was a potential threat. (This came to be known as a "[[fleet in being]]".) Mahan went on to say victory could only be achieved by engagements between battleships<ref>Mahan, A.T., Captain. ''Influence of Sea Power on History, 1660–1783''. (Boston: Little Brown), ''passim''.</ref> (which came to be known as the "decisive battle" doctrine in [[Imperial Japanese Navy|some navies]]), while ''[[guerre de course]]'' (developed by the ''[[Jeune Ecole]]'') could never succeed.

Mahan was highly influential in naval and political circles throughout the age of the battleship,<ref>Kennedy, op. cit., p2, p200, p206 et al.</ref><ref name="Sondhaus"/> and it called for a large fleet of the most powerful battleships possible. Mahan's work developed in the late 1880s, and by the end of the 1890s it had a massive international impact,<ref name = "Sondhaus"/> in the end adopted by many major navies (notably the British, American, German, and Japanese). The strength of Mahanian opinion was important in the development of the battleships arms races, and equally important in the agreement of the Powers to limit battleship numbers in the interwar era.

A related concept was a "fleet in being": the idea a fleet of battleships could simply by its presence tie down superior enemy resources. This in turn was believed to be able to tip the balance of a conflict even without a decisive battle. This suggested even for inferior naval powers a battleship fleet could have important strategic impact.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/fleet-in-being.htm "Fleet In Being", Globalsecurity.org, retrieved 18 March 2007]</ref>

===Tactics===
While the role of battleships in both World Wars reflected Mahanian doctrine, the details of battleship deployment were more complex. Unlike the [[ship-of-the-line]], the battleships of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had significant vulnerability to torpedoes and mines, weapons which could be used by relatively small and inexpensive craft. The [[Jeune Ecole]] school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s recommended the placing of [[torpedo boat]]s alongside battleships; the boats would hide behind the battleships until gun-smoke obscured visibility enough for them to dart out and fire their torpedoes.<ref name = "Sondhaus" /> While this concept was vitiated by the development of smokeless propellant, the threat from more capable torpedo craft (later including submarines) remained. By the 1890s the Royal Navy had developed the first [[destroyer]]s, small ships designed to intercept and drive off any attacking torpedo boats. During the First World War and subsequently, battleships were rarely deployed without a protective screen of destroyers.

Battleship doctrine emphasised the concentration of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force to be able to bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, [[airship]]s, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of [[radio]], [[direction finding]] and [[traffic analysis]] would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.<ref>It could presage an enemy sortie, or locate an enemy over the horizon. Beesly, Patrick. ''Room 40'' (London : Hamish Hamilton)</ref>) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques,<ref>Beesly.</ref> seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.

===Strategic and diplomatic impact===
The presence of battleships had a great psychological and diplomatic impact. Similar to possessing [[nuclear weapon]]s today, the ownership of battleships made a country count for something.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/>

Even during the [[Cold War]], the psychological impact of a battleship was significant. In 1946, USS ''Missouri'' was dispatched to deliver the remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and [[Greece|Greek]] waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the [[Balkans|Balkan]] region.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/missouri-iv.htm|title= USS Missouri|accessdate=2007-03-18 |publisher= Naval Historical Centre|format= |work= Directory of American Fighting Ships}}</ref> In September 1983, when [[Druze]] militia in [[Lebanon]]'s Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS ''New Jersey'' stopped the firing. Gunfire from ''New Jersey'' later killed militia leaders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/battleships/newjersey/bb62-nj.html |title= USS New Jersey|accessdate=2007-03-18 |format= |work= Directory of American Fighting Ships}}</ref>

===Value for money===
Battleships were the largest and most complex, and hence the most expensive warships of their time; as a result, the value of investment in battleships has always been contested. As the French politician Etienne Lamy wrote in 1879, ''The construction of battleships is so costly, their effectiveness so uncertain and of such short duration, that the enterprise of creating an armored fleet seems to leave fruitless the perseverance of a people''.<ref>Quoted in[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JIW/is_4_58/ai_n15927771/pg_5 Net-Centric before its time: The Jeune École and Its Lessons for Today] Erik J. Dahl U.S. Naval War College Review, Autumn 2005, Vol. 58, No. 4</ref> The ''[[Jeune Ecole]]'' school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s sought alternatives to the crippling expense and debatable utility of a conventional battlefleet. It proposed what would nowadays be termed a [[sea denial]] strategy, based on fast, long-ranged cruisers for commerce raiding and torpedo boat flotillas to attack enemy ships attempting to blockade French ports. The ideas of the ''Jeune Ecole'' were ahead of their time; it was not until the 20th century that efficient mines, torpedoes, submarines, and aircraft were available that allowed similar ideas to be effectively implemented.<ref>Dahl, ''op cit.''</ref>

The determination of powers such as the [[German Empire]] to build battlefleets with which to confront much stronger rivals has been criticised by historians, who emphasise the futility of investment in a battlefleet which has no chance of matching its opponent in an actual battle.<ref name ="Sondhaus"/> According to this view, attempts by a weaker navy to compete head-to-head with a stronger one in battleship construction simply wasted resources which could have been better invested in attacking the enemy's points of weakness. In Germany's case, the British dependence on massive imports of food and raw materials proved to be a near-fatal weakness, once Germany had accepted the political risk of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] against commercial shipping. Although the U-boat offensive in 1917–18 was ultimately defeated, it was successful in causing huge material loss and forcing the Allies to divert vast resources into [[anti-submarine warfare]]. This success, though not ultimately decisive, was nevertheless in sharp contrast to the inability of the German battlefleet to challenge the supremacy of Britain's far stronger fleet.

The problem for a maritime nation that does not maintain a balanced fleet, with at least some ability to contest a set-piece battle, is that it surrenders the use of the sea for its own purposes, whether economic or military. In addition, such a nation lacks the ability to interdict enemy shipping movements which are protected by a sufficient escort. Such a strategy exposes the nation to blockade or even, in the worst case, invasion. In addition, while a navy optimised for sea denial operations may maximise its potential against a stronger opponent, it will be at a disadvantage against nations of similar strength of its own, but which have invested their resources in a more conventional fleet. For this reason, maritime nations which are unable to compete with the dominant naval power have usually sought to achieve an accommodation with that power, thereby allowing them to resource a balanced fleet with which to deal with their more direct rivals. Examples of this strategy are the French [[Entente cordiale|''entente'']] with Britain in the decade preceding the First World War; and the British withdrawal in 1921 from its [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|alliance with Japan]], in order to avoid a confrontation with the United States.<ref>According to Norman Friedman, ''American policy generally'' <nowiki>[after the First World War]</nowiki> ''was to deny Japan either hegemony over East Asia or the close connection with Britain which would have presented difficulties in the event of U.S.-Japanese hostilities. Thus the Anglo-Japanese treaty was dissolved as part of a multilateral series of guarantees negotiated in tandem with the Washington Treaty'' (Conway's ''All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906–1921'', p.222).</ref> <!--actually Britain still had the larger navy up until about 1942--><!--I (John Moore 309) have added opened a discussion on this on the Talk page ("Was the U.S. much more powerful than the UK in 1921?"-->
