'''West Virginia University''' is an institution of higher learning based in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States of America|USA]], with the off-site campuses of [[West Virginia University at Parkersburg]] in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]], [[West Virginia University Institute of Technology]] in [[Montgomery, West Virginia]], [[Potomac State College of West Virginia University]] in [[Keyser, West Virginia]].  Since 1989, WVU has been governed by the [[University of West Virginia]] [[Board of Trustees]].

WVU was founded in [[1867]] as a [[land-grant university]] with the help of the [[Morrill Act]], and was originally the '''Agricultural College of West Virginia'''. The university changed its name in [[1868]].  Enrollment for the Fall 2005 semester was 26,051.

The university offers 178 majors in 15 colleges and has produced 25 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]]{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, including [[David C. Hardesty, Jr.]], WVU president [[2007|as of 2007]].  The university has also produced 29 [[Goldwater Scholar]]s, 16 [[Truman Scholar]]s, five members of ''[[USA Today]]'' 's All-USA College Academic First Team, and two [[Udall Scholarship]] winners.

==Libraries==
[[Image:WVRHClogo.gif|right|150px]]
The [[West Virginia and Regional History Collection]], the world's largest collection of West Virginia related research material, is located in the Wise Library on the Downtown Campus.  According to the university{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, the collection includes over 4,500,000 [[manuscript]] documents, 30,000 books, 15,000 pamphlets, 1,200 [[newspapers]], 100,000 [[photographs]] and prints, 5,000 maps, and 25,000 [[microfilm]]s, [[oral histories]], films and [[folk music]] recordings. It is often called simply the "West Virginia Collection." 

The university co-publishes, with the [[United Association for Labor Education]], ''[[Labor Studies Journal]]''.

==Campus==
The Morgantown campus is split into three sub-campuses. The original main campus, typically called the Downtown Campus, is located in downtown Morgantown. The Evansdale Campus was constructed in the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]] about a mile away on a high rise above the [[Monongahela River]]. The third is the Health Sciences Campus.

== PRT System / Campus Transportation==
{{main|Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit}}
Because of the issue of WVU's split campuses (Downtown, Evansdale, Health Sciences) one of the major icons at the school is the [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit|Personal Rapid Transit]] system that links them.

In 1974, [[Boeing]] began construction on the major PRT project in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], designed to shuttle students between WVU's three campuses. The school's original main campus, the Downtown Campus, is located in the valley of the Monongahela River. The Evansdale Campus, developed in the 1950s and 1960s, is on a high rise directly above the river, taking it out of the flood plain, but still in the valley. Because it proved impossible to develop any more valley land, WVU expanded to a separate parcel a couple of miles away on the other side of a ridge (today's Health Sciences Campus).
[[Image:Mountaineer.jpg|thumb|left|WVU Mountaineer Mascot statue at the Mountainlair Student Union.]]
The WVU PRT began operation in 1975. There was an interruption in service during the 1978/1979 school year to allow system expansion from the Engineering station to new stations at the "Towers" dormitories and the WVU Medical Center. During this time, WVU provided bus service between the campuses.  The PRT handles about 16,000 riders per day (as of 2005), and uses approximately 70 vehicles.

The system has five stations (Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical) and a 4 mile (6 km) track. The vehicles are rubber-tired and run along electrified rails. [[Steam]] heating keeps the elevated guide way free of snow and ice. Most students habitually use it. This system was not sold to other sites because the heated track has proven too expensive.  The system will occasionally break down, yet it is usually only for about ten minutes.  Otherwise, it reliably transports students between Downtown, Evansdale and the Health Sciences campuses. In order to board the PRT, one may either pay a nominal fare, or swipe their Mountaineer Card, an ID that also acts as debit plan, library card and unlimited transit pass. The cars are blue with gold trim and the school logo, as well as the school name printed on the front of each. Inside, the seats are light beige [[fiberglass]] and the interior carpet is brown. Each car has eight seats, and an overall advertised capacity of 20 people.

The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] named the WVU PRT one of the top 10 engineering achievements of 1972, and in 1998 The New Electric Railway Journal picked the WVU PRT over [[PeopleMover|Walt Disney World's monorail]] as the greatest people mover in the United States. 

In 2006 WVU received the distinction of being dubbed one of the best workplaces for commuters a recognition bestowed jointly by the US Department of Transportation, and US Environmental Protection Agency.

Each autumn during the annual Mountaineer Week celebrations, a special PRT car is brought in front of the [[MountainLair]] [[student activity center|student union]] where students participate in the "PRT Cram".  The purpose of the event is for student organizations to organize groups who attempt to squeeze as many people into the PRT car as possible.  A record was set in 2000, with 97 people.

Additionally, students may utilize one of the university operated buses to get around town. The university buses operate in most of the main areas of campus daily as well as the community bus service Mountain Line which operates all day, evening and until the early morning hours. Students may use their Mountaineer Card (student ID) to ride the Mountain Line bus for free. The Health Science Center also operates a shuttle service to help students, visitors and patients to get to and from the Health Science Center campus. Many non-university, private student housing communities in the area also operate a shuttle to campus/town and back to the housing community.

==Residential Education==
[[Image:Boreman Hall South.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Boreman Hall]], one of the oldest residence halls on campus.]]
The Residential Education (ResEd), enacted in 1995, works to promote "student success by easing the transition from high school to college and to personalize the freshman experience".<ref>[http://admissions.wvu.edu/undergraduate/discover/resident_faculty.asp WVU Admissions Dept.]</ref>  During the Move-In or Welcome Weekend, returning upperclassmen sometimes volunteer to help the new students and are known as Residential Education HOTSHOTS. They help carry items, give directions, and answer questions. Although a campus-wide plan, ResEd and Operation focuses on the university's 14 [[residence halls]].  Each hall is assigned a Resident Faculty Leader (RFL, pronounced riffle) who oversees programming and lives in a house (usually next door to the hall) where students hold Hall Council meetings and other events. Each hall is also assigned a Residence Hall Coordinator (RHC) who works with the RFL  and is responsible for daily operations, including enforcement of hall regulations.  Along with these two positions is are Resident Assistants (RA), student who have lived in the residence halls for at least one year and are each responsible for the daily operations of one floor.  Many residence halls offer peer tutors. 

== Athletics ==
{{main|West Virginia Mountaineers}}
The school's sports teams are called the Mountaineers and compete in the [[Big East Conference]], a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I.  The school has teams in 13 college sports and has won several national championships, including 13 [[NCAA Rifle Championship]]s as of 2007.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Mountaineer sports were started in 1891 when a group of students organized the first football game at the school.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Notable athletes from West Virginia University include Stan "The Man" Boskovich, [[Jerry West]], [[Sam Huff]], [[Rod Hundley|"Hot Rod" Hundley]], [[Rod Thorn]], [[Joe Stydahar]], [[Jeff Hostetler]], [[Major Harris]], [[Dan Mozes]], [[Jerry Porter]], [[Kevin Pittsnogle]], [[Marc Bulger]], [[Avon Cobourne]], [[Mike Vanderjagt]], [[Todd Sauerbrun]], [[Pacman Jones|Adam "Pacman" Jones]], wrestlers [[Greg Jones]], Nate Carr and Mike Mason, [[Georgann Wells]] (first female player to register a dunk in a collegiate basketball game),<ref>[http://www.wvculture.org/HISTORY/sports/wellsgeorgeann02.html ''Morgantown Dominion Post'' (Dec. 23, 1984): "Wells Encores With School Scoring Mark" (unbylined), via West Virginia Division of Culture and History]</ref> [[Amos Zereoue]], [[Quincy Wilson]], [[Chris Henry]], [[Mike Gansey]], and [[Steve Slaton]].

==Student newspaper==
{{main|The Daily Athenaeum}}
''The Daily Athenaeum'', nicknamed "The DA", is the 10th-largest newspaper in West Virginia{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. It generates income through advertisement sales. The paper began in 1887 as a a weekly [[literary magazine]], with production taken over by newly formed  journalism school in the [[1920s]].  In 1970, the paper split from the school of journalism and became an independent campus entity governed by the Student Publications Board. The ''DA'' was voted as the ''[[Princeton Review]]'s'' 10th-best college newspaper in the United States in 2005 and 15th in 2006.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==School Traditions==
===Flying WV===
[[Image:Goldoutline115w.gif|right|The "Flying WV"]]
The logo of the university is known as the "Flying WV.

===The Mountaineer===
The Mountaineer was adopted in [[1890]] as the official school mascot.  A new Mountaineer is selected every year by the school's senior honorary, The Mountain.  The new Mountaineer is given a custom tailored outfit and carries a traditional rifle which is fired to mark the opening of sporting events.  Male mascots traditionally grow a beard and wear a coonskin cap.

==="Take Me Home, Country Roads"===
The [[John Denver]] song "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]" is commonly played at most home sporting events as well as other occasions on campus.  In 1980, Denver helped to dedicate the new Mountaineer Field at Milan Puskar Stadium, and led the crowd in a sing-along of the song. It then became a tradition, after a victory, for fans to stay in the stands and sing it along with the football team.<ref>''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' (month n.a., 2006): "102 More Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate"</ref>

===Mountaineer Marching Band===
[[Image:sugar bowl06.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Pride of West Virginia at the 2006 Nokia Sugar Bowl]]
The WVU Marching Band, nicknamed The Pride of West Virginia, was formed in 1901 as an all-male [[ROTC]] band. It performs at every home football game and makes other appearances on- and off-campus throughout the year.

During its traditional pre-game performance, the band enters [[Milan Puskar Stadium|Milan Puskar Stadium at Mountaineer Field]] from end-zone tunnels to a spirited, 220-beats per minute "run on" cadence. The band plays several university songs and favorites including: "Fight, Mountaineers," "Mountain Dew," "Simple Gifts" (from ''[[Appalachian Spring]]''), "West Virginia University's Alma Mater," "The Star Spangled Banner," "Country Roads," and "Hail West Virginia!" The band also forms several iconic images during its pre-game show including the [[#Flying WV|Flying WV]], WVU, expanding circles, and an outline of the state of [[West Virginia]]. Each season's pre-game show is similar but unique. 

It is one of the few college marching band to include a male baton twirler.<ref>[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4324/ WVU news release] on Mountaineer Band twirlers</ref>

In 1997, the WVU Band was awarded the [[Sudler Trophy]] by the [[John Philip Sousa Foundation]].

===Fight song===
"Hail, West Virginia" is the university fight song.  It was composed by WVU alumni Earl Miller and Ed McWhorter in 1915.  The lyrics were written by Fred B. Deem, who later became a lawyer in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]]. The Mountaineer Marching Band performs the second verse of "Hail, West Virginia" as part of its pre-game performance at [[West Virginia Mountaineers|Mountaineer]] football games.

===Carpet roll===
In 1955, Fred Schaus and Alex Mumford devised the idea of rolling out an elaborate gold and blue carpet for Mountaineer basketball players to run out on during pre-game warm-ups. In addition, Mountaineer players warmed up with a special gold and blue painted basketball. The university West continued this tradition until the late 1960s. Former Mountaineer player [[Gale Catlett]] reintroduced the carpet when he returned to West Virginia in 1978 as head men's basketball coach.
