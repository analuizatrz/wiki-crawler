A '''Cobra probe''' is a device to measure the [[pressure]] of a moving [[fluid]]. In this kind of instrument, there are two [[yaw]] direction tubes which are chamfered and [[silver]] soldered symmetrically on the two sides of a pitot tube. It is otherwise similar to the other kinds of [[yawmeter]]s.
